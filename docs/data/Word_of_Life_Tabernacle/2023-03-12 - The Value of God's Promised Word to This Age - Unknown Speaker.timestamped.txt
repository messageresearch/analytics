[51:42] amen
[51:44] Amen to love the Lord this morning
[51:47] amen it's such a blessing to be in the
[51:49] house of the Lord Ezekiel chapter 33 and
[51:52] verse 30. Ezekiel 33
[51:55] 30
[51:58] good to see each and every one of you I
[52:00] want to say happy anniversary to Gabe
[52:03] and Millennia as well God bless you this
[52:05] morning thank you for being in church
[52:06] this morning I I remember what that one
[52:09] year anniversary was like and and uh we
[52:13] um you know you made it that's a
[52:15] milestone and may there be many many
[52:16] more of those I I think the Lord puts
[52:19] you together that's just my thoughts on
[52:21] it but I feel like he did by the gay but
[52:22] does so much for you over the last
[52:24] couple of years and we all should be
[52:26] grateful shouldn't we for what God's
[52:28] done for each and every one of us
[52:30] Ezekiel 33 30 he says also thou son of
[52:34] man the children of thy people still are
[52:37] talking against thee by the walls
[52:40] and what that means talking against c
[52:42] means talking about you the walls and in
[52:45] the doors of the houses and speak one to
[52:46] another everyone to his brother saying
[52:49] come I pray you and hear what is the
[52:52] word that cometh forth from the Lord
[52:54] and they come into thee as the people
[52:55] cometh they sit before thee is my people
[52:58] and they hear thy words but they will
[53:00] not do them for with their mouth they
[53:03] show much love but their heart goeth
[53:05] after their covetousness
[53:07] and lo Thou Art unto them is a very
[53:09] lovely song of one that hath a pleasant
[53:11] voice and can play well on an instrument
[53:15] they hear thy words but they do them not
[53:17] say God help me that I would never be
[53:19] this way
[53:20] he said and when this cometh to pass
[53:22] Lord will come
[53:24] he said then shall they know that a
[53:26] prophet have been among them
[53:29] pray the Lord would add his Blessing to
[53:30] the word you may be seated
[53:32] this morning
[53:34] as we found out last week we we know
[53:37] that our adversary is defeated we know
[53:40] he's powerful but he is defeated we know
[53:43] that he is uh he is mighty in his
[53:46] abilities and in his stature and in his
[53:49] position but is not mightier than God
[53:52] and therefore greater is he that is in
[53:54] you than he that is in the world right I
[53:57] heard a story about a man who was at the
[53:59] zoo and and he watched this zookeeper
[54:02] walk into a cage of a wild cat and he
[54:05] just walked right in he had nothing but
[54:06] a broom in his hand that he'd go over to
[54:08] that wild cat just laying there and he
[54:10] walked over to him he just poked him
[54:11] with that broom and and the Wildcat
[54:13] snarled at him and he and pretty soon he
[54:16] just got up and left went laid down
[54:17] somewhere else after the Zookeeper came
[54:19] out the man said my said you're brave he
[54:22] said I I tell you what you're up you're
[54:25] the most Brave man I've ever seen I
[54:26] can't imagine getting in a cave with a
[54:28] wild cat the man said no not really he
[54:30] said really he's he's really old and he
[54:33] has no teeth
[54:35] so he said I wasn't as Brave as what I
[54:38] appeared that's the way we are with the
[54:40] Devil the devil had his teeth taken away
[54:43] the sting was taken out of death he has
[54:45] no ability to to come and I think
[54:48] sometimes we treat him as if he's some
[54:49] some great thing and he does he is
[54:52] powerful but not when it pertains to us
[54:54] he has no ability to destroy us because
[54:58] God upholds Us by his spirit and by his
[55:01] word we're so thankful for that today
[55:04] so but we find that Satan has been
[55:06] successful in this age and as I was
[55:09] reading a quota brother randoms it got
[55:11] me thinking about this this morning he
[55:14] has been successful in the area of
[55:16] deception he has taken away the value of
[55:20] the promised word of the age and we find
[55:23] that's the way it was with Ezekiel that
[55:25] the people were gathering they
[55:27] understood the value of a prophet of the
[55:30] Prophet they they could hear the
[55:32] prophet's words but there was no value
[55:34] to the word that he was speaking he said
[55:37] they hear it but they don't do it and
[55:39] and so we find that that happens in
[55:42] every age that he said oh it's beautiful
[55:44] but they don't actually do it and so now
[55:46] brother Branham says this about
[55:48] Lucifer's success in this age that we
[55:51] live in he said now he said he would
[55:53] exalt himself above the most high he
[55:55] would Ascend above the clouds and the
[55:57] Stars he would sit there like God and be
[55:59] above the most time and he has succeeded
[56:02] in carrying out his threats
[56:06] he said he has certainly had a marvelous
[56:08] success in carrying out his threats by
[56:11] the people letting him
[56:13] right he can't do it to you unless you
[56:16] let him but he said the people letting
[56:18] him explain away in every age the value
[56:22] of God's promised word to that age
[56:27] I want us to notice this very closely
[56:29] today and and that's where I want to
[56:31] take my my sermon title the value of
[56:33] God's promised word to this age what is
[56:37] that what is the value of the promised
[56:39] word to the H well I think to know the
[56:41] value of something you you must
[56:43] determine what it is
[56:45] and and then you got to see you know if
[56:47] it's something that's coming from
[56:49] someone if you were bringing me a gift
[56:51] or something I would look first to see
[56:53] what it is and then I would I would want
[56:55] to know how do you handle it because I
[56:57] know if you think it's valuable then
[57:00] you'll handle it in a way that that
[57:02] projects value
[57:03] does that make sense so if God sends me
[57:06] something I want to know that it's
[57:09] valuable and then I want to know as I
[57:11] receive it I want to know that uh that
[57:14] it's been handled in a way that that
[57:16] tells me it has value and then we we
[57:18] want to see what it does once we open
[57:21] the box so to speak once we receive the
[57:23] Revelation once we once we live
[57:25] according to the word of this age once
[57:27] we once we begin to manifest it what
[57:29] does that do for us
[57:31] so what is God's promised word to this
[57:34] age it may be different than what we
[57:35] think because I think sometimes we think
[57:38] about that and think well God's promised
[57:40] word to this age is Malachi 4 and I
[57:42] would say that that's the beginning of
[57:44] it but yet there's a promised word to
[57:46] this age today because that promise has
[57:49] already been fulfilled so let's go to
[57:51] Isaiah chapter 46 and verse 9. and
[57:54] Isaiah says this about the word of God
[57:56] he said Remember the former things of
[57:58] whole he said for I am God and there is
[58:01] none else I am God and there is none
[58:04] like me or do you believe that this
[58:06] morning he said declaring the end from
[58:09] the beginning
[58:10] he said there ain't nobody else that can
[58:12] do that who declares the end from the
[58:14] beginning from ancient times the things
[58:17] that are not yet done he said saying my
[58:19] counsel shall stand and I will do all my
[58:24] pleasure whatever God ever wanted to do
[58:27] he does
[58:29] we were listening to a song Peter and I
[58:32] were it's a new song that's called the
[58:34] The Reckless Love of God and we were
[58:36] talking about that word reckless because
[58:38] nothing God does can be Reckless
[58:42] right it's literally impossible for God
[58:44] to be Reckless
[58:46] because he said my counsel shall stand I
[58:48] would he's not boasting he he cannot
[58:51] being an infinite all powerful almighty
[58:54] God he cannot fail or aren't you glad
[58:56] for you serve a god like that today he
[58:58] cannot fail he cannot let his people
[59:01] down the old song we used to see is God
[59:03] could do anything but fail
[59:05] he is not reckless in his love he's not
[59:08] reckless in his deeds or his words he's
[59:10] not taking a chance on you
[59:12] are you with me this morning he's not
[59:15] taking a chance on you he owns you you
[59:17] belong to him he's going to keep you all
[59:20] the way through you're gonna make it
[59:21] because he said you were going to make
[59:23] and in the deepest darkest moment of
[59:26] your life he said I was there with you
[59:28] he said where will I flee from his
[59:30] presence well I go into hell behold Thou
[59:33] Art there
[59:34] no matter where I go that's you're there
[59:36] you were always there in the deepest
[59:38] darkest moments of my life
[59:42] amen he said for and Isaiah 55 10 first
[59:45] the rain cometh down and the snow from
[59:48] Heaven returneth not thither but
[59:50] watereth the Earth and maketh it bring
[59:52] forth and Bud that it may give seed to
[59:54] the sower and bread to the eater so
[59:57] shall my word be that goeth forth out of
[1:00:00] my mouth it shall not return unto me
[1:00:02] void but it shall accomplish that which
[1:00:05] I please it shall prosper in the thing
[1:00:08] where to I sent it
[1:00:10] amen so we know then that Isaiah is
[1:00:13] saying the word of God is a seed and and
[1:00:17] every seed brings forth of its kind in
[1:00:19] its season I want us to look this
[1:00:21] morning at Noah I want us to look at the
[1:00:25] story of Noah and what the promised word
[1:00:27] was to his age so we can see and type
[1:00:31] what the promised word to our age is now
[1:00:33] in Noah's age in Genesis 6 13.
[1:00:37] God said to Noah the end of All Flesh
[1:00:40] has come before me
[1:00:41] for the Earth is filled with violence
[1:00:43] through them behold I will destroy them
[1:00:45] with the Earth so there's several parts
[1:00:47] to the prophecy that he's going to give
[1:00:50] to them now he's telling him and see the
[1:00:53] message that's why we have to we have to
[1:00:55] declare the whole counsel of God we've
[1:00:57] got to preach all of the message
[1:00:59] right because there's different parts
[1:01:01] for different people
[1:01:03] there's different parts for the pride
[1:01:06] for the foolish virgin for the world for
[1:01:08] the worldly church and then a different
[1:01:10] part for us now now he he said the end
[1:01:13] of All Flesh has come before me that's
[1:01:14] something he's going to do this is a
[1:01:16] promised word for that age the Earth is
[1:01:19] going to be destroyed verse 14 makes the
[1:01:22] an ark of gopher wood this is a promised
[1:01:24] word yes
[1:01:25] right for the age he said room shut down
[1:01:29] making the ark shall pitch it within
[1:01:31] without with pitch and this is the
[1:01:33] fashion which thou shall make it of the
[1:01:35] length of the Ark shall be 300 cubits
[1:01:37] the breadth of it 50 cubits the height
[1:01:38] of it 30 cubits Windows Thou shalt make
[1:01:41] to the ark he didn't just tell him make
[1:01:44] an ark and then leave it up to him what
[1:01:46] what kind of Arc to make
[1:01:48] right because he might have looked back
[1:01:49] at him and said God what's an ark
[1:01:53] right build an ark what's an ark
[1:01:56] right they didn't have no no ocean
[1:01:59] they didn't even have any rain
[1:02:01] it just there was just nothing there
[1:02:03] they weren't sailing he wasn't a sailor
[1:02:05] he didn't go down to the Jolly Roger and
[1:02:07] find himself a crew of sailors no God
[1:02:10] called Noah a farmer
[1:02:12] and he said build an ark
[1:02:15] and this is what how you build it yeah
[1:02:17] well now he said a window thou shall
[1:02:19] make in the ark and a Cupid Shuffle
[1:02:21] finish it above and and the door of the
[1:02:23] Ark says I sat in the side drive with
[1:02:25] lower second and third stories that
[1:02:27] shall make it and behold I even I you
[1:02:30] bring a flood of waters upon the earth
[1:02:31] now watch you that the ark that's the
[1:02:33] promised word of God the flood the
[1:02:35] promised word of God for the age he said
[1:02:37] I bring a flood of waters upon the Earth
[1:02:39] To Destroy All Flesh we're in is the
[1:02:41] Breath of Life from under heaven and
[1:02:42] everything that is in the Earth shall
[1:02:44] die but with thee shall I establish my
[1:02:47] Covenant and thou shalt come into the
[1:02:49] ark
[1:02:50] now he's this is still the promised word
[1:02:52] for the age
[1:02:54] but now he's saying there's coming a
[1:02:56] time when you're going to have to come
[1:02:57] into the ark he said thou and thy sons
[1:02:59] and thy wife thy wife and thy Sons wives
[1:03:02] with thee so now Noah built this Ark
[1:03:05] this boat and his family had to get in
[1:03:08] and ride out the storm until the art
[1:03:11] until the water is receded they believed
[1:03:14] and went in so once the ark was built
[1:03:17] the focus then was no longer on building
[1:03:19] the ark
[1:03:20] because there come a moment when the
[1:03:22] last nail was hammered in
[1:03:26] do you understand where I'm going this
[1:03:27] morning there come a time on the last
[1:03:29] snail was hammered in and the Ark is
[1:03:31] complete
[1:03:32] they just had to go in
[1:03:34] right so he said I'm gonna make a
[1:03:36] covenant with you and they could have
[1:03:37] said Oh Glory to God he's going to make
[1:03:39] your Covenant with us glory to God we
[1:03:41] see the ark right here built already
[1:03:42] built in front of us
[1:03:44] and by the way it's important that you
[1:03:46] understand that the ark is built
[1:03:49] that the vessel that will carry you to
[1:03:53] Eternity is already built the word that
[1:03:57] will carry you to a Rapture has already
[1:03:59] been given the last nail has already
[1:04:02] been put in
[1:04:04] or what kind of a people are we to be
[1:04:06] this morning the last nail is already in
[1:04:09] the ark
[1:04:10] Noah's standing there he's used his
[1:04:12] Henry lays down his hammer
[1:04:14] lays down his nails
[1:04:17] down the wood
[1:04:19] says it's time to go in
[1:04:23] verse 7 and don't went in and his son
[1:04:26] sent his wife and his son's wives with
[1:04:28] him into the ark because of the Waters
[1:04:30] of the flood if there ever was a day
[1:04:33] that we needed to go in that today is
[1:04:36] that day you say what we need to go in
[1:04:37] because we see the problems before Noah
[1:04:39] ever saw rain
[1:04:41] it said he went in because of the Waters
[1:04:43] of the flood why would he go in because
[1:04:45] he knew it was the promised word for the
[1:04:47] age
[1:04:48] the word promised there would be water
[1:04:50] he didn't see no water but he still went
[1:04:53] in to save himself from the water
[1:04:56] oh Church you may see say well the
[1:04:58] world's continuing on like it always has
[1:05:00] but remember there's water coming in
[1:05:02] this time this gauge it'll be fire
[1:05:04] there's Fire coming on the earth it's
[1:05:06] time to go into the word
[1:05:09] are you with me now
[1:05:11] so now the word for Noah's day does not
[1:05:14] work for today now we know that if I
[1:05:17] come up here and said I have a
[1:05:19] revelation from God we're going to build
[1:05:21] an ark
[1:05:22] and I got you all together and we get we
[1:05:24] started having work parties every week
[1:05:26] and I just got it's going to rain it's
[1:05:28] gonna rain every time I come up here I
[1:05:29] preach it's gonna rain and then we start
[1:05:31] building boats we all get ready for it
[1:05:33] to rain but that's not the promised word
[1:05:34] for this age it's scripture
[1:05:37] but it's not the promised word for this
[1:05:39] age
[1:05:40] yeah right we have an ark
[1:05:42] we have something to go into
[1:05:46] now brother Brandon says this he said
[1:05:48] let no man by his Creed deceive you he
[1:05:50] said you stay right in the promise of
[1:05:52] God the word of God he said of that word
[1:05:54] if it's a word for this day God
[1:05:56] vindicates it so he said if he doesn't
[1:05:58] it's not the word for this day
[1:06:00] he said the word that fell on the day of
[1:06:02] Pentecost will not work this day
[1:06:05] he said no sir that was for Pentecost
[1:06:07] this is for the bride or the home of the
[1:06:08] Bride we got something different
[1:06:10] he said and in other places he says we
[1:06:13] have that plus
[1:06:14] right yeah we've been restored back to
[1:06:16] Pentecost but we're not stopping there
[1:06:18] the word for our age is Rapture let me
[1:06:21] just come out if you're wondering what
[1:06:22] it is Rapture this is the rapture age
[1:06:25] that's the part of the word again
[1:06:27] they're in the word of the hour there's
[1:06:29] many things there was a prophet that was
[1:06:31] to come there's a bride that's to be
[1:06:32] made ready but here we are at the other
[1:06:34] end of it
[1:06:36] with the art completed yeah
[1:06:39] yeah and now we just have to make a
[1:06:40] choice are we going to go in
[1:06:42] I believe the bride will
[1:06:46] now watch
[1:06:48] he said we got something different the
[1:06:50] Pentecostals represented that again
[1:06:51] we're in the bride age
[1:06:53] he said no more than the word of Noah
[1:06:54] would work in the days of Moses no more
[1:06:56] than Moses law would have worked in the
[1:06:57] time of Paul here he said he tried to
[1:06:59] tell him you were dead to that you
[1:07:00] cannot have that
[1:07:02] so now that's the overwhelming the
[1:07:05] overwhelming push of this hour the
[1:07:07] overwhelming theme
[1:07:09] and we we will we will continue to uh to
[1:07:13] preach the whole word of God because
[1:07:14] that's the age we live in as a
[1:07:15] restoration of the entire word but the
[1:07:17] overwhelming theme is rapture
[1:07:20] oh don't let that get old to your church
[1:07:22] don't let that become a well that's the
[1:07:24] way it was back in the 70s that's the
[1:07:26] way we were back in the 80s or the 90s
[1:07:28] but today if there ever was a time that
[1:07:31] the overwhelming seed ought to be we're
[1:07:33] going home it's today
[1:07:35] that's right
[1:07:38] and
[1:07:39] now we find that
[1:07:42] that this age has a certain word a
[1:07:46] promised word
[1:07:47] but the brown stated in the times no
[1:07:49] it's time to see no he said in the times
[1:07:51] Noah's seed word
[1:07:55] he didn't learn this in Bible College by
[1:07:57] the way
[1:07:58] you want a word of knowledge
[1:08:00] you're fixing to have one
[1:08:02] Noah's seed word erected a floating
[1:08:05] transformation from the Earth to the sky
[1:08:12] that may not mean much to you but that
[1:08:14] means a lot to me God gave a word to a
[1:08:17] prophet yeah
[1:08:18] yeah and that word became an ark
[1:08:24] and that Ark carried them across the
[1:08:27] water listen that's the hour you and I
[1:08:29] are living in today we're not waiting on
[1:08:31] an arch to be built but no exceed were
[1:08:34] erected a floating transformation
[1:08:38] Hallelujah
[1:08:39] he said it sounded crazy to the people
[1:08:41] to have a little cult like Noah had
[1:08:43] that's what they called it and he told
[1:08:46] them said thus saith the Lord God has
[1:08:47] spoken there is coming a rain he said
[1:08:51] science and the educated and religious
[1:08:52] of that day said look at that old quack
[1:08:54] he is getting old his mind is slipping
[1:08:56] see but he was right because he was a
[1:08:59] Vindicated prophet and then at the end
[1:09:01] time his message was truly Vindicated
[1:09:04] you realize what the Ultimate Showdown
[1:09:06] the ultimate Vindication of this message
[1:09:07] is the change of our bodies
[1:09:11] Hallelujah
[1:09:13] he said what would he do
[1:09:15] he said he transformed from the Earth to
[1:09:18] Glory by an ark of the word that he was
[1:09:22] preaching
[1:09:25] oh God it was transformed from Earth to
[1:09:29] Glory by an ark of the word
[1:09:32] that he was preaching
[1:09:33] now say this that we don't have to add
[1:09:36] any more to that Ark
[1:09:38] it's done
[1:09:40] right dark's finished
[1:09:42] that's not the promised word of this age
[1:09:44] in the sense that it's coming
[1:09:45] it's the word of this age but the
[1:09:47] promised word of this age the promise
[1:09:49] yet to be fulfilled is the change of the
[1:09:51] body
[1:09:52] amen I'm getting ready for it aren't you
[1:09:56] now look he said when the
[1:09:58] so he said the snow that Noah's word was
[1:10:01] an ark now when the New Testament began
[1:10:04] began the promised word of that day was
[1:10:07] John's Ministry I may know that
[1:10:10] at the very beginning it was John's
[1:10:11] Ministry
[1:10:13] until John John's Ministry came
[1:10:16] and then once he came he made everything
[1:10:19] ready that was the promised word of that
[1:10:21] age
[1:10:22] but the people of that day had to go on
[1:10:25] in
[1:10:25] order to be saved
[1:10:28] right John chapter 3 and verse 30 John
[1:10:31] said he must increase but I must
[1:10:34] decrease right so now and we've preached
[1:10:36] about that before but the promised word
[1:10:39] of this age now what age do we live in
[1:10:41] today it's the coming of Malachi 4 we
[1:10:44] know that of Luke 17 30 brother Branham
[1:10:47] identifies that as the promised word of
[1:10:48] this age
[1:10:50] that that was coming but we're not
[1:10:51] looking for it anymore
[1:10:53] and we're not looking for an opening of
[1:10:56] the word
[1:10:57] if we are we've literally missed the
[1:10:59] boat
[1:11:01] all right yeah because the ark's been
[1:11:04] built
[1:11:06] and now in our age what are we looking
[1:11:08] to do we're looking to go in
[1:11:11] so now he said now it's the Rapture of
[1:11:13] the Bride that's the portion of the word
[1:11:15] for this day that's left to us so we've
[1:11:18] got to go in now but the writer said if
[1:11:19] I was a young man and looking for a wife
[1:11:21] to be married and here's to the girl
[1:11:23] that met every qualification I thought
[1:11:25] took to make a woman he said why morally
[1:11:28] she was the queen and lovely and a fine
[1:11:30] personality a real Christian everything
[1:11:32] that I could think of to make me a good
[1:11:35] wife he said no matter how much I say
[1:11:37] she's perfect she's exactly right she
[1:11:40] isn't mine till I accept her and the
[1:11:43] responsibility of her being my wife
[1:11:46] uh it threw me back brother Gabe I was
[1:11:49] thinking this week about you and
[1:11:50] Millennia and you forgive me for this
[1:11:52] but I was thinking back to that meeting
[1:11:54] that we had when Millennia came and and
[1:11:56] Gabe standing over there by himself and
[1:11:58] we're trying to get him to go talk to
[1:12:00] her
[1:12:01] right because unless you talk nothing
[1:12:03] can happen
[1:12:07] now I know we got young people in this
[1:12:09] church that have never spoken a word to
[1:12:10] one another
[1:12:11] but if you don't talk you can't ever be
[1:12:14] friends
[1:12:15] and if you're never friends nothing else
[1:12:16] can ever happen
[1:12:19] and you might say well I I'll just hang
[1:12:22] around this person you got to open your
[1:12:23] mouth
[1:12:25] right and tell her I you know I I think
[1:12:29] you're you're a nice girl and I'm a nice
[1:12:30] guy and maybe we should talk some more
[1:12:33] with your parents permission
[1:12:37] so no matter how perfect she is
[1:12:40] and follow her around all the camps and
[1:12:42] all the services and everywhere you can
[1:12:44] follow her all around no matter how
[1:12:45] perfect she is until you say something
[1:12:47] until you until you until you enter in
[1:12:50] until you make an advance of some kind
[1:12:52] until you take on a responsibility of
[1:12:54] some kind you're never going to have a
[1:12:56] relationship
[1:12:57] are you hearing me today he said that's
[1:12:59] the same thing the message is you might
[1:13:02] say it's right or this side or the other
[1:13:04] and say I sympathize with that I believe
[1:13:06] it's the truth but you've got to accept
[1:13:08] it and it's got to become a part of you
[1:13:10] and you a part of it
[1:13:13] that's right excuse me for yelling at
[1:13:15] you this morning
[1:13:16] it's got me stirred up in fact I'm
[1:13:18] thinking ahead and I'm stumbling over my
[1:13:20] words
[1:13:21] but it's just so good the word is so
[1:13:23] good
[1:13:23] God is so good to us
[1:13:26] it's now he said you've got to accept it
[1:13:28] it's got to become a part of you he said
[1:13:30] when you marry this certain woman that
[1:13:32] you've chosen you are one then
[1:13:34] you are one then and that's the way you
[1:13:37] are with Christ when you see him
[1:13:39] manifested and made real then you're a
[1:13:41] part of him and he is part of you and
[1:13:44] together you're part of the message
[1:13:47] he said well how can I become it how can
[1:13:49] I get in the message how can I become a
[1:13:51] message believer you've got to become a
[1:13:53] part of him and he's got to become a
[1:13:55] part of you
[1:13:57] I'm just saying I believe the message or
[1:13:59] going to a message church or wearing
[1:14:00] long long skirts and and long dresses
[1:14:03] it's not that at all but it's actually
[1:14:05] you becoming a part of the word
[1:14:09] that's right
[1:14:11] see in in
[1:14:14] John's time the focus had to turn from
[1:14:17] the prophet to the prophecy
[1:14:21] and that happened in our day
[1:14:24] brother Brown said when he was debating
[1:14:25] with the priests across the river
[1:14:28] speaking of John they said God built
[1:14:30] this altar God told us to do this Moses
[1:14:33] is the prophet We Believe Moses the
[1:14:35] sacrifice will never be done away with
[1:14:37] I can hear John answer back and said
[1:14:39] have not you read in the scripture what
[1:14:40] Daniel the Prophet said the daily
[1:14:42] sacrifice will be done away with and
[1:14:44] that hour has arrived
[1:14:47] huh he could stand there and say this is
[1:14:49] the promised word for the age
[1:14:51] right he said have you not read what
[1:14:53] Isaiah said in the 40th chapter the
[1:14:54] voice of one crying in the wilderness
[1:14:56] prepare the way of the Lord he said
[1:14:58] there's two prophecies for me yeah he
[1:15:00] said another thing did you not recognize
[1:15:01] our Prophet 400 years ago Malachi in the
[1:15:04] third chapter said behold I send my
[1:15:06] messenger before my face to prepare the
[1:15:07] way don't you know this fulfills
[1:15:09] prophecy prophecy was being fulfilled
[1:15:12] at about that time
[1:15:15] the prophet turned and said behold there
[1:15:18] comes the Lamb of God that takes away
[1:15:21] the sin of the world see so many people
[1:15:23] missed the turn they saw the first part
[1:15:25] building Ark that's coming to flood and
[1:15:27] they said let's all go get ready let's
[1:15:29] let's do it but there was a turn
[1:15:31] the people had to go in
[1:15:34] about that time the prophet turns and
[1:15:36] behold there comes the Lamb of God that
[1:15:38] takes away the sin of the world now
[1:15:39] what's the attraction it's changed from
[1:15:41] the prophet to his prophecy
[1:15:45] reality
[1:15:47] now when you attend to play I don't know
[1:15:50] how many of you have attended to play
[1:15:51] but we most of ours have been hillbilly
[1:15:54] place in Silver Dollar City
[1:15:57] but they have lights
[1:15:59] and you know there'll be one person
[1:16:01] maybe on the stage he'll come out he'll
[1:16:03] introduce
[1:16:04] or he'll come out and set up the scene
[1:16:06] or maybe it's a dramatic play I know we
[1:16:08] watched Moses and
[1:16:10] and we watch Jonah over in Branson and
[1:16:13] when he'd come out the spotlight would
[1:16:15] be on him just him everything else is
[1:16:16] dark
[1:16:18] right and and the spotlight's on him
[1:16:20] he's standing there in the spotlight
[1:16:22] and he's having a conversation with god
[1:16:24] or he's setting up the next scene
[1:16:26] and suddenly
[1:16:28] everything goes black
[1:16:31] and it's for a purpose to redirect your
[1:16:34] attention because when everything goes
[1:16:36] black then you're looking for where the
[1:16:38] spotlight Falls next
[1:16:39] and the spotlight doesn't stay on that
[1:16:41] actor as he goes behind the curtain
[1:16:43] right he's going to step behind the
[1:16:45] curtain
[1:16:46] and what they do is misdirection what
[1:16:48] they'll do they'll open up something
[1:16:49] over here
[1:16:50] and all of a sudden the light will shine
[1:16:52] over here on the left side or over here
[1:16:54] on the right side and there will be
[1:16:55] either another actor or maybe even the
[1:16:57] same actor but he'll be in different
[1:16:59] clothes and he'll have it he'll he'll be
[1:17:02] wearing a brother Brandon would say in a
[1:17:04] different mask
[1:17:05] and he's standing over here on the other
[1:17:07] side he's doing something different what
[1:17:09] was it the spotlight does not continue
[1:17:11] to look for the previous actor that has
[1:17:13] stepped behind the curtain but the
[1:17:15] attraction changes to the current act
[1:17:17] now listen when brother Branham left us
[1:17:20] the spotlight did not go on any preacher
[1:17:22] yeah
[1:17:25] because brother Brown's job John's job
[1:17:28] was to introduce the bridegroom
[1:17:30] brother man's job was to introduce the
[1:17:32] bride yeah
[1:17:35] oh now look what he did he stood there
[1:17:37] in the spotlight and he preached to us
[1:17:40] then he preached to us he preached to us
[1:17:42] at Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[1:17:44] and he preached us to get us ready for
[1:17:47] our husband get us ready he preached us
[1:17:49] the mysteries of God and the full word
[1:17:51] of God he stood there in the spotlight
[1:17:52] and God took him off the scene
[1:17:55] he stepped behind the curtain and it
[1:17:58] went black
[1:17:59] huh and every Minister pops up so I'm
[1:18:02] going to be the yeah
[1:18:03] yeah the next one in the spotlight but
[1:18:05] when he comes out the way the play is
[1:18:07] written it's not a preacher it's not a
[1:18:10] minister it's not a church
[1:18:13] what steps out from behind the curtain
[1:18:15] The Pride herself
[1:18:18] Hallelujah because now she's been
[1:18:20] introduced to the bridegroom
[1:18:24] the attraction changes
[1:18:27] the current Act
[1:18:29] this is the prophecy for our age I don't
[1:18:32] know how I could say it any clear first
[1:18:34] Thessalonians 4 16 for the Lord himself
[1:18:36] shall descend from heaven with a shout
[1:18:38] that part is done
[1:18:42] that part has been finished
[1:18:45] he is descended
[1:18:47] with the voice of the Archangel with the
[1:18:49] Trump of God the dead in Christ Church
[1:18:50] shall rise first then we which are alive
[1:18:53] and remain shall be caught up together
[1:18:55] with them in the clouds to meet the Lord
[1:18:57] in the air that's the part we're at
[1:19:00] that's the current Act
[1:19:02] that's where the spotlight is
[1:19:05] he said so shall we ever be with the
[1:19:07] Lord
[1:19:08] now again the ark had to be finished at
[1:19:10] some point you just can't keep adding to
[1:19:12] it
[1:19:13] you know you can you can make it look
[1:19:15] pretty
[1:19:15] you can go and add some Frills and and
[1:19:18] polish it make it look better
[1:19:20] but you but it's just it is what it is
[1:19:24] it's the way God made it it's the way he
[1:19:27] wanted it to be
[1:19:29] but now when we begin to look at that we
[1:19:31] begin to see well if this promised word
[1:19:33] of the age come to us and it has value
[1:19:36] how is it handled
[1:19:38] when it was brought to us we could look
[1:19:41] at that in Noah's Ark we could say how
[1:19:42] did he build it well he built it
[1:19:43] according to the instructions from God
[1:19:46] he built it just exactly the way God
[1:19:48] said build it
[1:19:50] and so now how is it handled and because
[1:19:54] it matters when someone brings you
[1:19:56] something of value in order to convince
[1:19:58] you if I had if I had something of value
[1:20:01] in my house and I brought it to you and
[1:20:05] I just carried around like this and set
[1:20:06] it down on the counter and tossed it to
[1:20:08] you I said that thing's worth a million
[1:20:10] dollars
[1:20:12] huh we better not be
[1:20:16] right
[1:20:17] makes you scared to hold it and you
[1:20:19] doubt me
[1:20:20] because I don't have a million dollars
[1:20:22] sitting on the shelf
[1:20:24] right and you know if I had something
[1:20:25] that was worth a million dollars it'd be
[1:20:27] under locking key
[1:20:28] it would be protected it would be cared
[1:20:31] for
[1:20:33] you when God sent a prophet in this age
[1:20:35] you come in a certain Manner and he
[1:20:38] handled the word in a certain way
[1:20:40] and so we see that it happened in Paul's
[1:20:43] time Paul when he come to the
[1:20:45] Corinthians he said I'd rather when I
[1:20:47] came to you came not with Excellency of
[1:20:49] speech or of wisdom declaring it unto
[1:20:51] you the testimony of God for I
[1:20:53] determined not to know anything among
[1:20:55] you save Jesus Christ in him Crucified
[1:20:58] My focus was on the value of Christ in
[1:21:01] him only
[1:21:04] right he left off everything else all
[1:21:06] his Pharisee teaching he didn't drag
[1:21:08] that forward in the message
[1:21:10] but he said I forgot everything I
[1:21:12] learned and everything was about the
[1:21:14] value
[1:21:16] all right if this bottle of water was
[1:21:18] worth a million dollars sometimes I feel
[1:21:20] like it is
[1:21:21] I bet you do too and I'm drinking out of
[1:21:23] it
[1:21:26] was really hot and the bottle of water
[1:21:28] is worth a million dollars
[1:21:30] what would I do with it how would I
[1:21:32] handle it what would I do I make sure it
[1:21:35] didn't get broken I'd make sure that it
[1:21:37] didn't spill out
[1:21:38] better handle it carefully
[1:21:43] he said I I've got all my focus on it
[1:21:45] you ever seen a kid walk through the
[1:21:46] house you don't go get something and
[1:21:49] they walk to the house told Peter go get
[1:21:50] a pair of scissors the other day here he
[1:21:51] comes running with it
[1:21:53] I said
[1:21:54] you don't need to do that
[1:21:56] your mama taught you better
[1:22:00] because he was the valuable thing not
[1:22:02] the scissors
[1:22:03] you ever seen a kid you come go get
[1:22:04] something to get it you're like not like
[1:22:06] that
[1:22:08] treat it with some respect
[1:22:11] it's worth something you ever done that
[1:22:14] you know you have an old suit you don't
[1:22:15] care what you do with it you just throw
[1:22:16] it over the side somewhere and get
[1:22:18] crumples up you get a new one that you
[1:22:20] just had to pay for
[1:22:22] right and you walk some of y'all wear
[1:22:24] suits I guess still somebody does
[1:22:26] but you take an old suit or an old pair
[1:22:28] you got that what do you do you hang it
[1:22:30] up you make it real nicely for the first
[1:22:31] week or two yeah
[1:22:33] yeah why it has value
[1:22:36] oh God
[1:22:37] how much more value out the people of
[1:22:39] God and the word of God have to us
[1:22:44] and look
[1:22:45] you'd be careful not to break it yeah
[1:22:48] yeah we need to be careful not to break
[1:22:49] one another
[1:22:52] God help me with that I I learned to be
[1:22:55] pretty hard-nosed as a child but I have
[1:22:58] to be careful not to break people you
[1:23:00] can push people till you break them
[1:23:02] and you've broken a valuable thing
[1:23:05] right right and so Paul said I I just my
[1:23:08] focus was on the message
[1:23:10] I was with you in weakness and in fear
[1:23:12] and in much trembling my speech and my
[1:23:14] preaching was not with enticing words of
[1:23:15] man's Wisdom but in demonstration of the
[1:23:18] spirit and the power that your face
[1:23:20] should not stand in the wisdom of men
[1:23:21] but in the power of God
[1:23:23] and so we find the messenger of this age
[1:23:25] he did not point to himself but he held
[1:23:28] something precious
[1:23:30] the promised word for the age
[1:23:33] and he says this he said I want you to
[1:23:35] know this is sure and you that listen to
[1:23:37] this tape you might have thought today I
[1:23:39] was trying to say that about myself
[1:23:40] because he preached on the anointed ones
[1:23:42] at end time he said being that I was
[1:23:44] packing this message
[1:23:45] he said I have no more to do with it
[1:23:47] than nothing no more than just a voice
[1:23:49] in my voice even against my better
[1:23:50] judgment I wanted to be a Trapper but
[1:23:52] it's the will of my father I declare to
[1:23:54] do and determined to do he said I wasn't
[1:23:57] the one that appeared down on the river
[1:23:58] in other words don't get the value mixed
[1:24:00] up the values and what I'm carrying
[1:24:05] and why do we value brother Reynolds so
[1:24:07] much because he did have value what was
[1:24:09] his value
[1:24:10] his message
[1:24:13] right that's his value it's his message
[1:24:16] you can't separate one from the other
[1:24:18] and we'll get into that in just a moment
[1:24:19] but the message and that's why a person
[1:24:22] who preaches the word has to live the
[1:24:23] word
[1:24:25] a person let me take a little bit
[1:24:26] farther there should be the bride ought
[1:24:28] to live the word because you packed
[1:24:30] something of great value
[1:24:33] it shouldn't be thrown out with the
[1:24:34] world it shouldn't be done just any old
[1:24:36] way when you live just any way you want
[1:24:39] to but there's value to it
[1:24:41] you have value today
[1:24:43] he said I wasn't the one that appeared
[1:24:45] down the river I was only standing there
[1:24:46] when he appeared I'm not the one that
[1:24:48] performs these things and foretells
[1:24:49] these things it happens as perfect as
[1:24:50] they are I'm the only one that's near
[1:24:52] when he does it I was only a voice that
[1:24:54] he used to say it it wasn't what I knew
[1:24:57] it's what I just surrendered myself to
[1:24:59] that he spoke through it isn't me he
[1:25:02] said it wasn't for seven things all know
[1:25:03] it was the manifestation of the son of
[1:25:05] man it wasn't the angel his message it
[1:25:07] was the mystery that God unfolded it's
[1:25:10] not a man it's God the angel is not the
[1:25:13] son of man he was the messenger from the
[1:25:15] son of man the son of man is Christ he
[1:25:18] is the one that you're feeding on you're
[1:25:20] not feeding on him man a man his words
[1:25:22] will fail but you're feeding on the
[1:25:24] unfailing body word of the son of man
[1:25:28] yeah he recognizes the value of what he
[1:25:31] was saying
[1:25:33] I I will say this
[1:25:36] as a minister I need to be careful not
[1:25:38] to
[1:25:39] place the value of my words over the
[1:25:41] value of a prophet's words
[1:25:45] as if my words were more important
[1:25:47] important they may be important
[1:25:50] but we have a message
[1:25:52] first Peter 4 and 10
[1:25:55] says this he said as every man hath
[1:25:57] receive the gift even so Minister the
[1:25:58] same one to another as good stewards of
[1:26:01] the manifold grace of God
[1:26:03] so you've been given a great gift
[1:26:05] you realize what a gift it was in that
[1:26:07] age for those people to find out that
[1:26:09] Gentiles could be saved
[1:26:13] what a gift that that was
[1:26:16] here they've been walking in darkness
[1:26:18] carrying clubs on their back and doing
[1:26:19] all kinds of things that were ungodly
[1:26:21] and everything else and Paul comes
[1:26:23] preaching a message and said this gospel
[1:26:25] that you've heard about this Moses that
[1:26:27] you've heard about these prophets that
[1:26:28] you've heard about this wasn't just for
[1:26:30] the Jews
[1:26:31] [Music]
[1:26:33] this was for you
[1:26:35] and you don't have to jump through a
[1:26:36] bunch of Hoops and be circumcised and do
[1:26:38] a bunch of rituals and have a bunch of
[1:26:40] feast days and stuff and nonsense like
[1:26:42] that creeping back around the message we
[1:26:44] don't do those things why are we because
[1:26:46] this gospel we got the Revelation he
[1:26:48] said it was a great gift
[1:26:50] great gift come what's dropped right in
[1:26:52] her lap
[1:26:54] oh my great gift can you imagine how
[1:26:56] they felt I'll tell you what I felt the
[1:26:58] same way when I I when I would have been
[1:27:01] in a denomination probably he'll Wesley
[1:27:02] and holding this person today but this
[1:27:04] message come by my family's way and when
[1:27:07] it come by my way it changed the
[1:27:09] trajectory of my life a great gift has
[1:27:11] been given to me and as every man hath
[1:27:14] received the gifts
[1:27:16] even so Minister the same one to another
[1:27:25] right this message is not just honey
[1:27:28] or fishing and those things are great I
[1:27:29] love to well I don't talk about hunting
[1:27:31] but I
[1:27:33] I'm patient with y'all
[1:27:35] but I love talk about fishing
[1:27:37] that's not the word of the age
[1:27:40] yeah that's not the promise we're the
[1:27:41] age as every man hath to receive the
[1:27:44] gift
[1:27:44] Minister the same you you were born
[1:27:47] again by the word of this hey do you
[1:27:49] realize that your new birth is not a
[1:27:50] Baptist New Birth or a Methodist New
[1:27:52] Birth it's a word birth
[1:27:54] and so the fact that you were born again
[1:27:56] you received the baptism of the holy
[1:27:58] ghost that comes from the word of this
[1:27:59] hour
[1:28:01] and so whenever we testify about our new
[1:28:03] birth what are we doing we're
[1:28:05] ministering one to another
[1:28:07] as good stewards of the manifold grace
[1:28:10] of God
[1:28:13] when's the last time you fellowship with
[1:28:15] someone around the message of the hour
[1:28:16] think about I'm not talking about
[1:28:18] you know arguing about a bunch of stuff
[1:28:20] bunch of depth and stuff that you don't
[1:28:22] even understand I'm talking about the
[1:28:24] goodness of God
[1:28:26] when you just realize how good God has
[1:28:28] been to bring you this message
[1:28:31] he said If any man speak
[1:28:37] that's the way we should value the words
[1:28:39] that we say in the pulpit
[1:28:42] if it was the word of God if any men
[1:28:44] Minister let him do it as of the ability
[1:28:46] which God giveth that God in all things
[1:28:48] may be glorified through Jesus Christ to
[1:28:50] whom be praised and Dominion forever and
[1:28:52] ever first Peter 5 1 the elders which
[1:28:54] are among you had a sword who am also an
[1:28:56] elder and a witness of the sufferings of
[1:28:58] Christ also partaker of the glory that
[1:29:00] shall be revealed he said feed the flock
[1:29:02] of God which is among you taking the
[1:29:04] oversight thereof not by constraint but
[1:29:06] willingly
[1:29:08] and we've talked about that yeah I can't
[1:29:09] make you stay here but willingly because
[1:29:12] you want to be here not for filthy look
[1:29:14] or money but I've already mind
[1:29:17] neither is being Lords over God's
[1:29:19] Heritage but being examples to the flock
[1:29:22] you see this the value of this message
[1:29:31] in my Ministry it isn't about me
[1:29:34] it's not in any other Church
[1:29:37] well if you come to our church that's
[1:29:38] not what this message is
[1:29:40] this message cast down denominationalism
[1:29:43] well our church is the best one in the
[1:29:45] message the the one that has the most
[1:29:47] Spirit the one that has the most word
[1:29:48] and people fight and fuss about it and
[1:29:50] getting competition about who has the
[1:29:52] most of this and the most of that I tell
[1:29:53] you it's time we turn back to the
[1:29:55] message of the hour and said this is
[1:29:56] about a word that come in our day to get
[1:29:58] us ready for a Rapture this isn't about
[1:30:01] me it's not about you
[1:30:06] are you with me now
[1:30:08] and yet
[1:30:09] when you surrender to it you say well it
[1:30:12] is about me in the sense that I have to
[1:30:14] carry it I have to become one with it
[1:30:16] now now watch as we say that now the
[1:30:20] messenger had such great value
[1:30:22] the message rather had such great value
[1:30:23] that God purified the messenger before
[1:30:25] he could even bring it
[1:30:27] he spoke to him said don't ever smoke
[1:30:28] drink
[1:30:30] you know the story don't defile your
[1:30:32] body in any way you've got a work to do
[1:30:33] when you get older
[1:30:35] yeah right and then we come into the
[1:30:38] third poll he told him he said you're
[1:30:39] about to cross Jordan you got to be more
[1:30:41] sincere
[1:30:43] more sincere than what you are
[1:30:46] yeah why would why would he tell him
[1:30:47] that why would he rebuke him in his in
[1:30:49] his visions
[1:30:50] you don't don't explain it
[1:30:52] he said no one will know about it he
[1:30:54] said it'll just be it'd be that third
[1:30:56] poll why did he do that he had to handle
[1:30:58] it with such care
[1:31:00] oh God because it wasn't about the man
[1:31:03] it was about the message
[1:31:06] see now brother Brown said when the word
[1:31:07] of the Lord comes to a true servant he
[1:31:09] must go regardless of circumstances or
[1:31:13] regardless of difficulties he must go
[1:31:15] anyhow
[1:31:17] whether he's prepared
[1:31:19] whether he feels like it whether he
[1:31:21] wants to whether whatever more he must
[1:31:24] go anyhow
[1:31:26] it's God speaking and he must carry this
[1:31:31] message
[1:31:33] that's the way we ought to be when we
[1:31:35] come to the house of God
[1:31:36] a messenger who comes you come with a
[1:31:38] message and song or a message in a
[1:31:41] messaging and a word a message and I and
[1:31:44] as a preacher or a message to the little
[1:31:46] children or whatever that it is you come
[1:31:48] with a message you come with this
[1:31:49] message
[1:31:50] you represent this message you've been
[1:31:52] sitting here in the audience you
[1:31:54] represent this message
[1:31:56] right in your congregation that
[1:31:58] represents the message and whether you
[1:32:00] feel prepared or whether you feel like
[1:32:02] it or whatever more you must go you must
[1:32:04] go anyhow
[1:32:05] why are you representing more than
[1:32:07] yourself you represent the message
[1:32:10] it's God speaking
[1:32:13] yeah and I don't get to just handle it
[1:32:14] any way I want to right
[1:32:18] I got to take it seriously because it's
[1:32:21] the word of the Lord right he said he
[1:32:23] must carry this message he never goes
[1:32:25] for foolishness he never goes for money
[1:32:27] he never goes for popularity
[1:32:30] well if everybody likes what I had to
[1:32:32] sing then I'll sing You Should Never
[1:32:33] sing
[1:32:36] because that's not what it's about
[1:32:38] if everybody likes what I had to preach
[1:32:40] and I'll preach if it if I get a bunch
[1:32:42] of likes on Facebook if I get a bunch of
[1:32:44] likes on YouTube if everybody comes to
[1:32:46] church that Sunday then I'll preach then
[1:32:48] I'll see that's not what it's about
[1:32:50] he's you have the word of the Lord you
[1:32:53] don't go for popularity he only goes in
[1:32:55] the name of the Lord for one thing he's
[1:32:56] got a mission he's sin of the Lord
[1:32:59] and listen to this he is the word of God
[1:33:02] because he's carrying the word of the
[1:33:05] Lord
[1:33:06] that is the true prophet of the Lord
[1:33:11] that's different from a Baptist with his
[1:33:13] message in the sense that
[1:33:15] he's saying well I Jesus saves
[1:33:18] but but I don't have much standard for
[1:33:21] my own life
[1:33:22] because all I have to do is believe and
[1:33:24] go in
[1:33:25] but a true Messenger
[1:33:27] says Jesus saved and I Jesus says and I
[1:33:30] am saved
[1:33:32] Jesus sanctifies I am Sanctified Jesus
[1:33:35] fills with the Holy Ghost I am filled
[1:33:37] with the Holy Ghost
[1:33:40] are you with me now yeah
[1:33:43] so we all carry this message we all do
[1:33:46] what value do we give it
[1:33:49] now when we talk about the message a lot
[1:33:51] of times we talk about
[1:33:52] we talk about stuff
[1:33:54] we talk about things
[1:33:56] I got thinking about this I have
[1:33:57] Nostalgia does anybody ever else here
[1:33:59] get stricken with nostalgia
[1:34:02] would you bear with me in my Folly for
[1:34:04] just a moment
[1:34:06] I put some things under the pulpit today
[1:34:10] I got all kinds of stuff
[1:34:14] you haven't seen this side of me before
[1:34:18] you know when the message come to us how
[1:34:19] did it come
[1:34:21] in book form
[1:34:23] tape form
[1:34:25] some of y'all know I don't have a reel
[1:34:27] to reel but Joel's got one somewhere but
[1:34:28] I you know we had an old reel-to-reel
[1:34:31] players I've seen them I've listened on
[1:34:33] them if you ever listened on a reel to
[1:34:34] Real Player so many of you have wasn't
[1:34:36] that wonderful wasn't a wonderful
[1:34:37] experience
[1:34:41] it's scratchy and
[1:34:43] it's hard to hear
[1:34:45] right but it was the message
[1:34:48] it had value right
[1:34:51] I remember when we used to get the
[1:34:52] message like this remember this wait by
[1:34:55] the way we've got a complete set on most
[1:34:56] of tapes and they're going into boxes
[1:34:58] now if you want some I don't know what
[1:35:00] you would play them on but if you want
[1:35:02] some we've got them complete set of
[1:35:03] tapes back there and we're putting them
[1:35:04] in boxes because we're gonna redo that
[1:35:07] room but look
[1:35:08] that's the way they came you remember
[1:35:09] that it was brown looked like the 80s
[1:35:13] that's when it was made
[1:35:15] right and before that you know we had a
[1:35:18] complete set to it brandsville we had a
[1:35:19] pirated set we
[1:35:21] ours was stolen food but it was it was
[1:35:23] good
[1:35:27] had a little words written on I check
[1:35:29] those out many times
[1:35:31] I I told the kids melody told me I was
[1:35:33] telling her about tapes she said we were
[1:35:34] boxing them up she said what's a tape
[1:35:36] player
[1:35:37] and she said what do you play these on
[1:35:38] how do you get these on a computer I
[1:35:40] said you don't I said it's a tape player
[1:35:42] and she said what's the tape player and
[1:35:44] I said believe it or not when these
[1:35:46] other kids were little I had a tape
[1:35:47] player in my car
[1:35:49] and I carry these tapes and these are
[1:35:51] the ones we have the most of back there
[1:35:52] you remember when these come out
[1:35:53] filtered tapes
[1:35:55] right you could get these tapes and and
[1:35:57] and we got a box of these in in a box
[1:36:00] every month I don't know how many of you
[1:36:01] were on the tape list but we got a box
[1:36:03] every month and I can I'll never forget
[1:36:06] it the mailbox our house was a quarter
[1:36:08] of a mile from our house because you had
[1:36:09] to go down this Gravel Road and all the
[1:36:11] way at the end of the gravel road is the
[1:36:12] mailbox so we'd stopped there when we
[1:36:14] went out or when we come in so you'd
[1:36:16] stop there and I remember we checked the
[1:36:17] mailbox every day whenever we knew that
[1:36:19] there was a tapes coming
[1:36:21] because when you got it then you got to
[1:36:22] go through and see it and it started in
[1:36:24] 65 and you listen to every one of them
[1:36:26] and you went through and nobody else did
[1:36:28] this did they but
[1:36:29] a few of y'all did we listened to every
[1:36:31] one of them and then they come through
[1:36:32] and the next box would come had great
[1:36:34] value to us
[1:36:36] I couldn't go I didn't know if the
[1:36:38] preachers around me were preaching
[1:36:39] something if I hadn't heard it I didn't
[1:36:41] know if it was true or not
[1:36:43] because we didn't have a way of
[1:36:44] searching it I'm only 37.
[1:36:47] am I 37 or 38 37 thank you
[1:36:52] foreign
[1:36:54] but but you know we didn't have any way
[1:36:57] of searching it and so we we had I
[1:36:58] remember when I first started preaching
[1:37:00] uh we we come out like this we come out
[1:37:03] with with books
[1:37:05] so I had a whole stack
[1:37:08] the books
[1:37:09] like this
[1:37:12] and before that we had brother mammel's
[1:37:14] book sister Fritz back there you go
[1:37:16] check her hand later and tell her thank
[1:37:17] you because a lot of the books that we
[1:37:19] have sister Fritz sat down on the tape
[1:37:21] player
[1:37:22] and listen to it and typed it out
[1:37:25] and listen to it and typed it out
[1:37:28] huh that's how it got there
[1:37:31] somebody had to do it there were others
[1:37:34] that did it as well but somebody had to
[1:37:36] right somebody had to do that you had
[1:37:39] these old books like this and I would
[1:37:40] take a whole stack of them and that's
[1:37:41] how I do it I'd Mark the page highlight
[1:37:43] I still got something I've highlighted
[1:37:45] you marked the page you fold it like
[1:37:46] that you highlight you read the quote so
[1:37:48] you weren't preaching very much broadly
[1:37:51] because you couldn't get to very much
[1:37:52] you can only get to a little bit so we
[1:37:55] brought that and I hope I'm not boring
[1:37:56] you this morning but the word had value
[1:37:58] to us
[1:38:01] remember the song books we still got
[1:38:03] both the song remember these
[1:38:05] we even sang the message you know
[1:38:08] some of them aren't too doctrinally
[1:38:10] correct either we still sang them
[1:38:14] they had value
[1:38:16] right we got quote books we put together
[1:38:20] I remember the golden nuggets book I
[1:38:21] tried to find that I've got that
[1:38:22] somewhere if I think it's back there but
[1:38:24] I we had the golden nuggets and we read
[1:38:26] the gold nuggets that really helped me
[1:38:28] but JP is a young man the golden nuggets
[1:38:30] book because I learned that's the first
[1:38:31] time I'd heard of the opening of the
[1:38:32] word because the brother put it together
[1:38:34] in there and just quote so he put
[1:38:36] together but it was just what he put
[1:38:38] together you couldn't look you had
[1:38:39] brother manless's books and things
[1:38:41] church the church age book you remember
[1:38:42] when it was hardcover and now we have a
[1:38:44] new edition of that uh they finally come
[1:38:46] from tapes to CDs
[1:38:48] we got a bunch of those back there too
[1:38:51] and some of you still have a CD player
[1:38:53] we had with the the table come out and
[1:38:55] before that it was fully abused you
[1:38:57] remember that I remember the old dos
[1:38:58] program that they first rode and you had
[1:39:01] a old computer you had to wait on it to
[1:39:02] come up and then it added a dot matrix
[1:39:04] printer and it would print out the quote
[1:39:06] boy I thought that was technology
[1:39:09] right
[1:39:10] now we can search the message
[1:39:13] that value
[1:39:15] it was precious
[1:39:17] now I wonder sometimes if we didn't put
[1:39:19] more value in this
[1:39:21] and this I mean the physical thing that
[1:39:23] we did on what was said on it
[1:39:28] right because this will pass away
[1:39:31] just like this will
[1:39:33] but brother random tells a story about a
[1:39:35] postage stamp you've all heard it he
[1:39:37] tells the story about a postage stamp he
[1:39:38] said here was a man that had a postage
[1:39:40] stamp I got stuff all over the place
[1:39:42] here's a man that's got a postage stamp
[1:39:44] or a little boy he said he found it he
[1:39:46] realized it was old so he takes it down
[1:39:47] to the Antique shop the guy gives him a
[1:39:49] dollar for it and he is perfectly happy
[1:39:52] now we can buy an ice cream cone right
[1:39:54] so he goes down and buys an ice cream
[1:39:56] cone the man at the at the antique shop
[1:39:58] realizes it has value he sells it for 25
[1:40:01] 000 the next man sells it for 250 000.
[1:40:05] and brother Brandon said it wasn't a
[1:40:07] piece of paper
[1:40:09] to the boy it was just a piece of paper
[1:40:11] to some of us it was just a supernatural
[1:40:14] book or a quote book or or a tape
[1:40:18] it's just a tape but the tape wasn't the
[1:40:21] value
[1:40:23] brother bear said the value was not the
[1:40:25] postage stamp the value was what was
[1:40:27] printed on it
[1:40:32] you realize the value of the word for
[1:40:34] this age was not in tapes and books but
[1:40:36] it was what was printed on it but I'll
[1:40:37] say this
[1:40:38] where are we at what what has happened
[1:40:40] to us because I think sometimes we
[1:40:42] because how we handled it remember how
[1:40:44] we handled these
[1:40:47] if you do remember how you handled the
[1:40:49] message
[1:40:52] and now we've got it on our phones or on
[1:40:54] our devices and I've got all the message
[1:40:55] on here I got boxes and boxes of tapes
[1:40:58] back there it's all on here
[1:41:00] but what value do I place on it now
[1:41:03] when this left that I take did I lose
[1:41:05] the value for the word
[1:41:07] God help us today
[1:41:10] how you handle the word shows the value
[1:41:13] you place on it
[1:41:17] you're fighting fuss about it
[1:41:19] yeah all it is is my my group or my no
[1:41:24] it's the word of the age
[1:41:26] it's getting out of here
[1:41:28] it's an ark
[1:41:30] God built an ark in our day
[1:41:34] and it wasn't this this is flimsy this
[1:41:37] is plastic that's not the ark but the
[1:41:39] ark is the word that was on it
[1:41:43] and where is that ARC today where is it
[1:41:45] at where is that word it's right there
[1:41:48] it's right here it's in our hearts
[1:41:51] but let me tell you today unless you get
[1:41:53] it off of this you can never get it in
[1:41:55] your heart unless you listen to it
[1:41:57] unless you becomes a part of you I'm
[1:41:58] afraid we're turning our Focus so much
[1:42:00] and we're like well you know it's all
[1:42:01] about us it's all about the churches and
[1:42:03] things that's good but it's about this
[1:42:05] message
[1:42:07] this message still has value in this day
[1:42:10] this is all I have to preach this is all
[1:42:12] that I have this is all that we are as a
[1:42:15] church if it wasn't for this message we
[1:42:17] might as well go out and be Baptist
[1:42:18] because it's a lot easier we might as
[1:42:21] well go out and be Pentecostals it's a
[1:42:22] lot easier we could be something else we
[1:42:25] could have praise and worship we can do
[1:42:26] all the other things that we do but this
[1:42:28] word has value let's fight for that
[1:42:31] let's protect it let's stand up with it
[1:42:33] let's believe it
[1:42:35] good
[1:42:40] let's handle it right
[1:42:43] God forbid that I would handle that word
[1:42:48] in a less than careful way
[1:42:50] because the word the people see is not
[1:42:52] what's on here
[1:42:54] not even what's preached over the
[1:42:55] internet
[1:42:56] but it's my life
[1:43:00] because what happens when you walk into
[1:43:02] the Promised word of this age
[1:43:03] you become a part of that promise to
[1:43:07] work yeah
[1:43:09] as long as the Arc was being built they
[1:43:11] weren't a part of it
[1:43:13] right as long as it was as long as they
[1:43:15] were getting ready get all the stuff
[1:43:16] ready animals were coming in but when
[1:43:18] they walked in
[1:43:20] they become part of it
[1:43:24] that's what you've got to do young
[1:43:25] people don't let this value this message
[1:43:27] be of no value to you
[1:43:29] walk into it
[1:43:31] walk into it this message will last you
[1:43:33] say well if the Lord didn't come when we
[1:43:35] thought he would I don't know it might
[1:43:37] be tomorrow it might be another 50 years
[1:43:39] but if it's another 50 years the value
[1:43:42] of this message will only have increased
[1:43:49] in this day
[1:43:51] this day man say what they want to say
[1:43:52] by AI technology
[1:43:55] and they can present to you a voice that
[1:43:56] sounds like brother Brandon's but it's
[1:43:57] not
[1:43:58] I don't want to scare you but you better
[1:44:00] know this word
[1:44:03] they can make it sound like anything oh
[1:44:05] I put my trust in the tapes I put my
[1:44:06] trust in a man men will fail you any man
[1:44:09] will
[1:44:10] put your trust in the word because
[1:44:12] brother branham's book was this book his
[1:44:14] court book was this one
[1:44:17] this was his quote book and everything
[1:44:19] and the things that he preached come
[1:44:20] back to this
[1:44:22] we're going to talk about that a little
[1:44:23] bit this afternoon
[1:44:25] I've used up my time but I've got just a
[1:44:26] few more minutes hang with me
[1:44:29] I know his family walked into that Ark
[1:44:31] they were sealed away
[1:44:33] from destruction
[1:44:35] they were sealed out of death and into
[1:44:37] life
[1:44:39] brother said we find out when a man
[1:44:40] comes sent from God ordained of God with
[1:44:42] the truth thus saith the Lord the
[1:44:43] message and the messenger are one and
[1:44:44] the same
[1:44:45] now you've heard this a lot people take
[1:44:47] this and say well well brother Brandon
[1:44:49] his message are the same well that's
[1:44:50] true but look where he goes with it he
[1:44:52] said because he is sent to represent
[1:44:54] thus saith the Lord word by word so he
[1:44:56] and his message is the same he said a
[1:44:58] denominational man under denominational
[1:45:00] auspices he in the churches it's the one
[1:45:03] he said a theologian under theology made
[1:45:04] by some denomination he and his
[1:45:06] messenger one Church of theology a
[1:45:08] theologian he said then when a man comes
[1:45:10] with us saith the Lord he and the
[1:45:11] message is one and when Elijah come with
[1:45:14] us saith the Lord he and his message
[1:45:15] became one
[1:45:16] he said just as Jesus when he come he
[1:45:18] was the word Saint John 1. so the word
[1:45:20] of God and the messenger the age was the
[1:45:21] self thing sell same thing all the time
[1:45:23] he said that's right Jesus was the word
[1:45:25] that was prophesied up he was what the
[1:45:27] prophet said would happen of urgent
[1:45:29] shall conceive and bear this child he
[1:45:30] said way back in the beginning God told
[1:45:32] them said the woman said shall Bruce the
[1:45:33] Serpent's head he was her heel all these
[1:45:36] prophecies have been given David crying
[1:45:37] all the rest of the prophets down to the
[1:45:39] age of speaking of him he was that word
[1:45:40] manifested he said now do you see where
[1:45:42] I'm trying to get to you he said I spoke
[1:45:45] with you pretty plain this morning don't
[1:45:47] you see
[1:45:48] the authority
[1:45:50] of the Living God
[1:45:52] in the Living Church
[1:45:55] Hallelujah the bride
[1:45:58] the sick are healed
[1:46:01] the dead erased up why because this is a
[1:46:04] supernatural message
[1:46:08] and the supernatural message come back
[1:46:10] it wasn't Wordle we thought it was just
[1:46:12] well he's together I can remember
[1:46:13] gathering in living rooms and listening
[1:46:15] to the message of the hour and listened
[1:46:16] to it it had such great value to us but
[1:46:18] listen the value in it was in the power
[1:46:20] of it that the power would add the same
[1:46:22] power it was on the message would come
[1:46:24] on us
[1:46:26] the sick or healed the dead erased up
[1:46:28] the cripples walk the blind sea the
[1:46:30] gospel Goes Forth in its power for the
[1:46:32] message and the messenger are the same
[1:46:34] the word is in the church in the person
[1:46:37] he said oh the devil is howling about
[1:46:39] this
[1:46:40] oh this is from Christ The Mystery of
[1:46:42] God revealed he said the manifested
[1:46:43] truth of the promise of the word in her
[1:46:45] alone
[1:46:46] have you ever thought about that what
[1:46:48] great value that this has because this
[1:46:50] word is not in every group it's not an
[1:46:52] every woman if we can say it that way
[1:46:54] it's not in every church but it's in you
[1:46:57] Hallelujah and he said the promise of
[1:47:01] the word in her alone he said they don't
[1:47:02] have the answer when Jesus comes why
[1:47:04] didn't those Pharisees he said if I cast
[1:47:06] out Devils by the Finger of God who do
[1:47:08] you cast them out by see he stood alone
[1:47:10] and his church stands alone
[1:47:13] she is not hooked with nothing but he
[1:47:15] was identified by God being the body
[1:47:17] that God dwelt in and the church is
[1:47:19] identified by his body doing the same
[1:47:21] thing
[1:47:22] she is his body the manifested truth of
[1:47:25] his promised word for the last days
[1:47:29] I tell you what is the value
[1:47:32] of the promised word for the age
[1:47:36] promised word for the age is you
[1:47:42] remember when they went in the argument
[1:47:43] was the ark well they were building the
[1:47:45] ark when they went in the promised word
[1:47:46] for the age was Noah and his family
[1:47:50] the message the message in the messenger
[1:47:52] became one
[1:47:54] and we become one with this message
[1:47:58] she is his body
[1:48:00] the manifested truth of his promised
[1:48:03] word for the last days
[1:48:04] and she and she alone
[1:48:07] stands by it
[1:48:09] don't let Satan beguile you like he did
[1:48:11] Eve
[1:48:13] yeah you get on the internet and start
[1:48:14] looking at things people have said about
[1:48:15] the message and how
[1:48:17] but this message changed me
[1:48:20] I don't believe this message because of
[1:48:23] some argument that somebody argued me
[1:48:24] into it this message changed me
[1:48:30] it made me different I'm not who I was
[1:48:33] and because of that I know this this
[1:48:35] message is right

[1:48:53] healing it's giving us salvation oh my

[1:48:58] are the manifested word of God for our
[1:49:00] day we are the word of the hour
[1:49:03] Hallelujah she is the word of the hour

[1:49:08] the devil is howling that's why he's
[1:49:10] howling that's why he's mad don't you
[1:49:13] realize that's why he's trying
[1:49:14] everything he can to take you down to
[1:49:16] take down this message

[1:50:05] great organizations to set up something
[1:50:06] to close her up they'll never do it
[1:50:11] let me tell you let me tell you
[1:50:12] something some of those organizations
[1:50:13] that are trying to close up churches are
[1:50:15] inside the message but they'll never do
[1:50:18] it
[1:50:19] there will be somebody who'll preach the
[1:50:21] word
[1:50:22] they'll never do it she'll be taken up

[1:51:13] to meet her headship her Redeemer her
[1:51:16] husband or king or Lord or lover her
[1:51:18] savior in the provided meaning
[1:51:24] heart is sealed in
[1:51:26] stepped it to the ark
[1:51:28] and the door closed behind us
[1:51:31] why because he places Great Value why
[1:51:33] did he send the promised word for the
[1:51:35] age because he plays such great value on
[1:51:38] you
[1:51:42] he gave himself for us
[1:51:45] so that we can be God's promised word
[1:51:48] to this age
[1:51:51] did you bow your heads with me for just
[1:51:52] a moment
[1:51:54] the spirit of the Lord is here this
[1:51:55] morning
[1:51:58] I could have kept preaching
[1:52:03] I was here this morning
[1:52:04] [Music]
[1:52:08] I'll say this the anointing Falls when
[1:52:12] we when we Elevate the word of God for
[1:52:14] our day
[1:52:16] when we fight when we fuss when we
[1:52:18] when we talk about our denominations it
[1:52:20] goes away
[1:52:22] but the presence of God shows up
[1:52:25] Elevate the promised word of the age
[1:52:29] I wonder what what value that word has
[1:52:31] to you today
[1:52:33] is there enough value in it to make you
[1:52:35] raise your hands and worship
[1:52:38] is there enough value in it
[1:52:40] to make you want to live right
[1:52:43] make you want to do right
[1:52:46] make you want to walk in front of the
[1:52:47] people with such carefulness
[1:52:50] such such a spirit of a peace and
[1:52:54] godliness
[1:52:55] because you wouldn't want to do anything
[1:52:58] to give a bad name to this message I
[1:53:00] know some of you live like that I know
[1:53:02] many of you do
[1:53:03] I say God help me today
[1:53:06] I want to live so carefully even when I
[1:53:08] don't feel like it because I carry the
[1:53:10] message
[1:53:12] even when I don't feel like it I
[1:53:14] remember how carefully I carried those
[1:53:15] tapes in that box as a young man back up
[1:53:18] that Gravel Road
[1:53:19] how much more carefully ought to carry
[1:53:21] the word or the hour in my heart
[1:53:24] oh God
[1:53:26] oh God granted today Heavenly Father
[1:53:29] Lord Jesus how we love you today
[1:53:31] oh God would you just make it real to us
[1:53:34] today make this word a reality in our
[1:53:37] lives God may we never fall back into a
[1:53:41] negligence Lord or a vaccin condition or
[1:53:43] some kind of an idea where we think well
[1:53:45] you know I don't I don't really mean
[1:53:47] that much but oh God as long as I have
[1:53:49] breath let me preach it as long as I
[1:53:51] have a voice let me shouted to the down
[1:53:53] the house stuff Lord let me say I have
[1:53:56] been delivered by this message it
[1:53:58] changed me
[1:53:59] I have been healed because the message
[1:54:02] was not the words of a man but it was
[1:54:04] the unfailing body word of the son of
[1:54:06] man it was more than just word only
[1:54:08] although it was the word alone not mixed
[1:54:11] with anything else but it was more than
[1:54:13] just word it was the Dynamics it was the
[1:54:16] mechanics and it was the Dynamics

[1:54:21] the Dynamics are here now Lord we
[1:54:23] believe that today pardon we pray that
[1:54:26] Lord in this moment as as the presence
[1:54:28] of the Lord is here maybe each one heart
