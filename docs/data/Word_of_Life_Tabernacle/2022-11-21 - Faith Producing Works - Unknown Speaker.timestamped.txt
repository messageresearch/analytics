[31:06] just take your time just just take your
[31:07] Liberty amen all right Genesis chapter
[31:10] 22 and verse 1.
[31:12] and it came to pass after these things
[31:14] that God did tempt Abraham and said unto
[31:16] him Abraham and he said behold here I am
[31:20] and he said take now thy son thine only
[31:23] son Isaac whom thou lovest and get thee
[31:26] into the land of Moriah and offer him
[31:28] there for a burnt offering upon the
[31:30] mountains which I will tell thee of and
[31:33] Abraham rose up early in the morning and
[31:34] saddled his ass and took two of his
[31:36] young men with him and Isaac his son
[31:38] enclaved the wood for the burnt offering
[31:40] and Rose up and went unto the place
[31:41] which God had told him then on the third
[31:44] day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw
[31:46] the place so far off and I want you to
[31:48] notice they had traveled three days
[31:50] and then he looked and he saw the
[31:52] mountain where the Lord had told him to
[31:54] take Isaac
[31:55] and Abraham said to his young men abide
[31:57] ye here with the ass and I and the lad
[32:00] will go Yonder and worship and come
[32:03] again to you
[32:04] I love the faith of Abraham here
[32:07] I and the lad will go
[32:09] and I and the lad will return
[32:12] and now he knew what he was going there
[32:14] to do
[32:15] but he would call things
[32:17] that were as though they were not the
[32:19] faith of Abraham and Abraham took the
[32:21] wood and the burnt offering and laid it
[32:22] upon Isaac his son and he took the fire
[32:24] in his hand and a knife and they went
[32:26] both of them together and Isaac spake
[32:27] unto Abraham his father and said my
[32:29] father and he said here my my son he
[32:32] said behold the fire in the wood but
[32:34] where is the Lamb for a burnt offering
[32:36] and Abraham said my son God will provide
[32:38] himself a lamb for a burnt offering so
[32:41] they went both of them together and they
[32:43] came to the place which God had told him
[32:45] of and Abraham built an off an altar
[32:47] there and laid the wood in order and
[32:50] bound Isaac his son and laid him on the
[32:52] altar upon the wood you may be seated
[32:55] may the Lord add His blessings to the
[32:56] word tonight
[32:58] I just love the story of Abraham here
[33:01] because
[33:03] it is showing you the faith that he had
[33:05] in the midst of a trial
[33:08] and they had waited on this sun for 25
[33:12] years and they had they had he had to
[33:15] believe God for this so they had to wait
[33:16] all this time to get a son and then when
[33:19] they have this son he gets up I believe
[33:21] brother Branham says he might have been
[33:22] around 12 to 14 years old so they have
[33:25] this son they raise him up and he's a
[33:26] little teenager now or a preteen and and
[33:29] God says take him up to this mountain
[33:31] and offer him as a sacrifice now
[33:34] I'll be honest with you if the Lord told
[33:37] me to take my son and offer him as a
[33:38] sacrifice I don't know that I could do
[33:40] that thankfully he hadn't done that to
[33:42] me but Abraham knew that the same God
[33:46] that brought Isaac in the first place
[33:49] after all he was a promised son there
[33:52] was nothing that he could do to have
[33:54] that child but God restored them back to
[33:56] where they could have a child so God
[33:58] gave it to him and the only way he could
[34:01] keep that son was by obeying the will of
[34:03] God that's what he had to do his whole
[34:05] life but
[34:07] Faith was speaking when it looked like
[34:09] the works were against the promise and
[34:11] brother Bram talks about this and and
[34:13] and now if you believe God gave you this
[34:15] son and and by him you would father
[34:17] Nations and would you take him to an
[34:19] altar and sacrifice his life and brother
[34:21] Brandon goes on and and he said see
[34:22] Abraham's Faith was not in the works but
[34:24] in the promise that he kept the word and
[34:26] believed God then God would make the
[34:28] promise come to pass even if it looked
[34:30] like it would be impossible God
[34:32] Specializes in the things thought
[34:34] impossible brother Branham says this he
[34:36] said there's one thing to teach
[34:38] something there's another thing for God
[34:40] to confirm it and say it's the truth
[34:42] there's one one thing to say something
[34:44] it's another thing to do something it's
[34:47] not hears it's doers show me your faith
[34:49] without your works and I'll show you my
[34:51] faith said Paul by my works if you
[34:54] believe it you'll act upon it that's it
[34:57] then your faith becomes works I would
[35:00] like you to notice that the works don't
[35:03] produce the faith the faith produces the
[35:06] works and and if you watch Abraham here
[35:09] he said now when the little boy was born
[35:10] he said God proving that after Abraham
[35:12] had held on for all these years when he
[35:14] was about 12 years old God said now
[35:16] Abraham I'll show the world that you got
[35:17] faith in me I've made you a father of
[35:19] many nations and this boy in him I'm
[35:21] going to call the seed from Isaac and I
[35:24] say this that I want you to take Isaac
[35:26] out here and kill him he said the only
[35:28] hope that he had was in Isaac the only
[35:30] hope he had in his seed coming forth was
[35:33] in Isaac he said so I imagine Abraham
[35:35] couldn't even tell Sarah that he was
[35:37] going to take this fine little 12 or 14
[35:39] year old boy down here a little curly
[35:41] hair hanging down around his shoulders
[35:43] and his only child both of them getting
[35:45] up in middle age again remember they had
[35:47] already gotten old once but they were
[35:49] going back again he said both of them
[35:51] get back in middle age again and he said
[35:52] well how could they do it take that he
[35:55] said I couldn't tell poor Sarah so he
[35:57] got all the wood together and put it on
[35:58] the mule got a couple of servants and
[36:00] noticed he went three days journey and
[36:01] then he looked afar off as the Bible
[36:03] said there and then he saw the mountain
[36:05] which he was to go to offer Isaac for
[36:07] sacrifice he said now ordinary man can
[36:09] walk anyhow 25 miles a day
[36:12] I'm not ordinary
[36:15] ordinary man can walk 25 miles a day I
[36:18] can maybe do five I don't know brother
[36:21] Stewart could probably do 20. maybe he's
[36:22] in shape and and so ordinarily in those
[36:25] days when you go in your car everywhere
[36:27] you go but he said them they they were
[36:28] used to walking and he went three days
[36:30] journey he was at least 75 miles back
[36:33] there when he looked and saw the
[36:34] mountain afar off probably another 25
[36:36] miles so Abraham was told to take this
[36:38] child a hundred miles from home to go
[36:41] sacrificing now that's a that's a big
[36:43] that's a big task that Abraham's going
[36:45] to do here and so he looks often it's
[36:48] probably another 25 miles
[36:49] he said now he's hundreds of miles from
[36:52] civil as civilization
[36:53] he said and then when he comes close to
[36:56] the mountain he said to the servants he
[36:59] took the wood brother Brandon says the
[37:01] perfect type of Christ in God he said he
[37:03] laid the wood on Isaac's shoulders took
[37:05] the fire in his hand and took it took it
[37:07] this he said look at this now he said
[37:09] you stay here and the lad and I are
[37:10] going the honor to worship the lad and I
[37:13] shall return He said Glory I just had to
[37:16] let that come out you got to let it come
[37:19] out and it'll hurt you he said Glory I
[37:21] just had to let that come out look how
[37:23] did he do it he said the Bible said he
[37:24] had received him as one from the dead
[37:26] knowing that God could raise him up from
[37:28] the dead how is he going to come back
[37:30] Abraham you're going to kill him how's
[37:32] he going to return with you but he took
[37:34] God's word knowing that God had promised
[37:36] him that through Isaac God was going to
[37:39] do something he didn't know what but it
[37:41] wasn't his business to know what just
[37:44] walk on he said it's not your business
[37:46] to know what's next but it's your
[37:48] business to stay with the word of God he
[37:50] said well how's God going to heal me I
[37:52] don't know but walk on any out he said
[37:54] how am I going to tell my mother tonight
[37:56] that I got saved I can't tell you how am
[37:58] I going to tell my associates I receive
[37:59] the Holy Spirit and born again he said I
[38:01] can't tell you walk on he said Keep
[38:04] moving on lay aside everything and move
[38:07] on towards Calvary and that's what
[38:09] Abraham was doing here he had no idea if
[38:11] the Lord was actually going to provide a
[38:13] lamb but he said his word told me he
[38:15] would so I'm going to go on anyway he
[38:17] already told you he would heal you so
[38:19] walk on anyway he already told you he
[38:21] would give you the Holy Ghost walk on
[38:23] anyway walk on into the promises of God
[38:25] and every one of them are yours
[38:28] he said How's God going to heal me I
[38:30] don't know how's he going to save me I
[38:32] don't know I can't tell you he said walk
[38:34] on just keep going on move on right
[38:36] towards Calvary he said on they went up
[38:38] the Mountainside this little boy with
[38:39] the wood on his shoulder a type God
[38:41] giving his only begotten son in years to
[38:43] follow but God's showing there that he
[38:47] what he would do he said oh I just love
[38:49] it when he got up to the top of the hill
[38:51] he found a big rock for the Altar and
[38:53] laid the wood built the fire little
[38:54] Isaac said father he said here I am my
[38:56] son he said here's the wood here's the
[38:58] altar here's the fire but where's the
[39:00] lamb for the bird offering he said oh
[39:02] that down that old patriarch's heart he
[39:04] was trembling with the knife sticking on
[39:06] his side to take his own son's life he
[39:08] said God will provide himself a lamb for
[39:11] the offering it's not my business to
[39:13] argue about it or this that or the other
[39:15] he said God will provide he made the
[39:18] promise did he make a promise that you
[39:20] would receive the Holy Ghost after you
[39:22] were baptized then it don't matter how
[39:24] it comes when it comes it will happen he
[39:26] said thine thy house shall be saved if
[39:28] you hold on to that promise it may look
[39:30] like it's not going to happen but it
[39:32] will happen
[39:34] well that'll make somebody happy today
[39:36] it will happen you say well my children
[39:38] have went so far it looks like they
[39:40] could never come back my families went
[39:42] down so far I'll tell you sometimes I
[39:44] think to myself I've got siblings out
[39:46] there sometimes to me looking through
[39:48] the Human Side it looks like they could
[39:49] never come back but Looking Through The
[39:51] Eyes of Faith there is already been a
[39:53] land provided and God said you just go
[39:56] right on forward you keep moving on and
[39:59] God will provide a lamb for that
[40:01] situation every time he'll provide a
[40:04] lamb he said he made the promise he said
[40:06] brother I'm paralyzed I've been in this
[40:08] hand paralyzed how can I when I haven't
[40:10] seen for years I'm blind I don't know he
[40:13] said that God made the promise he said
[40:15] you get that down in your heart he said
[40:16] are you Abraham's seed how many
[40:18] Abraham's seed we have here today are
[40:20] you Abraham's seed he said now listen he
[40:23] said let that Faith come into you
[40:26] Abraham's seed notice when he takes this
[40:28] little boy buying hands in his feet he
[40:31] said Isaac never said a word obedient
[40:34] unto death just like Jesus was at the
[40:36] cross remember Isaac didn't fight until
[40:39] because he believed what his dad told
[40:41] him God's going to provide a lamb Isaac
[40:43] didn't struggle and say well no you're
[40:45] not going to sacrifice me no he was
[40:47] willing just like Christ was willing and
[40:49] he and his father had to be willing as
[40:51] well
[40:52] his father had to be willing to take him
[40:54] to the Cross his father had to be
[40:56] willing to put the wood on his shoulders
[40:58] and say go up here because there's going
[41:00] to be a type and God will provide
[41:02] himself a sacrifice he said notice he
[41:05] said he takes a little boy binds his
[41:07] hands at his feet Isaac never said a
[41:08] word obedient unto death just like Jesus
[41:11] At The Cross laid him up on the altar
[41:13] pulled out the knife the tears may be
[41:16] rolling down his cheeks and laid his
[41:18] hand on his little head brushed back his
[41:20] curls and pulled back his knife just
[41:23] like this raised his hands to plunge the
[41:25] knife into his own son's throat think
[41:27] about it
[41:28] he was willing
[41:30] he said it just like that he said he
[41:33] pulled back to the knife because God had
[41:35] told him to do it just about that time
[41:37] he got ready to act upon God's
[41:38] commandment and the Holy Spirit grabbed
[41:41] his hand and said Abraham stay your hand
[41:43] I know you love me
[41:45] he lets that test come upon you and you
[41:47] get like you just well I'm just going to
[41:49] keep marching on I'm going to keep going
[41:51] on you get down there to where it seems
[41:53] like you can't go any farther without
[41:54] something coming and taking your place
[41:56] and God says I know you love me here I
[41:59] am to provide a lamb for you and he said
[42:01] about that time right over behind him a
[42:03] ram hooked in the wilderness with his
[42:05] horns Bleed It Out he said Hallelujah he
[42:09] said Hallelujah means praise our god
[42:10] what was it Abraham loosed his son
[42:13] remember he was loosed because of a lamb
[42:15] that was provided he was loosed and
[42:18] freed because God had already provided a
[42:20] lamb why according to the promise of God
[42:23] he said what was it Abraham loosed his
[42:25] son went over and got this Ram
[42:27] burnt and burnt him as an offering
[42:29] instead he said I want to ask you
[42:31] something friends he called the name of
[42:33] the place Jehovah Jireh the Lord will
[42:35] provide himself a sacrifice he said
[42:38] where did that Ram come from he was a
[42:40] hundred miles from civilization and
[42:42] beside that the ram couldn't have been
[42:43] there the wolves and lions and things
[42:45] could have eaten he said in another
[42:47] thing it's up on top of the mountain
[42:48] where there's no water remember this is
[42:50] an impossible situation and this is an
[42:52] impossible time when there shouldn't
[42:54] have been a ram up there there shouldn't
[42:56] have been a sacrifice made Abraham was
[42:58] told to go to a place where it looked
[43:00] like God couldn't keep his promise but
[43:02] he kept it anyway
[43:03] it looked like he couldn't do it there
[43:05] but God always keeps his appointments
[43:08] and he'll show up on time every time he
[43:11] said there's no water where did the ram
[43:13] come from he said Jehovah Jireh the
[43:15] Creator spoke the lamb into existence he
[43:18] is there at all times he is there at all
[43:22] times when you don't feel him he's there
[43:24] anyway when it looks like it's dark or
[43:26] the Mountain's too high he said I will
[43:29] be with you even in you until the end of
[43:31] the world and I'm here to tell you if
[43:33] you can just believe and step out on
[43:35] that abrahamic faith God will never
[43:37] leave him he'll never lose one of your
[43:39] children he'll never let you go he'll
[43:42] always bring you back to the place that
[43:43] he called Mariah and say I have provided
[43:46] for myself I have provided myself a lamb
[43:49] and he will take your sins he will take
[43:51] everything away from you why because it
[43:53] should have been you it should have been
[43:55] Isaac that was slain but why he couldn't
[43:58] let Isaac because he was the father of
[43:59] all the nations he couldn't let Christ
[44:01] not raise again because Spirit had to
[44:04] come back to the church the spirit had
[44:07] to come back he couldn't he couldn't
[44:08] leave him in the grave he couldn't leave
[44:10] him there why because he said I will
[44:12] never leave you comfortless so he had to
[44:14] send a comforter which is the Holy
[44:16] Spirit to the church
[44:18] do you believe it tonight he said he's
[44:20] the lamb that come into existence in one
[44:22] minute and die at the next minute see
[44:25] there's the real name of God it should
[44:27] have been Isaac but God had to use a
[44:29] lamb for a type he said he said he is
[44:32] there at all times the lamb that come
[44:33] into existence one minute died the next
[44:35] he said one man taking God's word god
[44:38] providing the thing and he's still
[44:41] Jehovah Jireh tonight that'll provide
[44:43] the sacrifice every time that a man or
[44:47] woman will take his word every time if
[44:49] you'll take his word he will never fail
[44:51] you he will never leave you comfortless
[44:54] he said I will come to you and I believe
[44:56] he's done it for you tonight I look
[44:58] around and I see lives change sitting
[44:59] here in the church Beck should have been
[45:01] out here in the world and Living For The
[45:03] Devil but you're sitting here tonight
[45:04] because God provided a lamb for you and
[45:07] you took the comforter and he
[45:09] rejuvenated you he changed you from the
[45:11] nature that you had and now you can't
[45:13] help but live for him why because the
[45:15] comforter has come the comforter is here
[45:17] tonight right and he's here to change
[45:19] every situation what was it it was a
[45:21] sacrifice on Calvary but then when he
[45:23] went into the grave and he conquered
[45:25] death hell in the grave and then when he
[45:27] come up he sent his Spirit here tonight
[45:29] there's no reason to doubt there's no
[45:31] reason to feel like you're in a
[45:33] vaccinating cold condition but it's your
[45:35] time to take a hold of the promises of
[45:37] God it's your time to say this is my
[45:40] time this is my fight this is my
[45:43] children this is my church I'm not going
[45:45] to let go until I can see God in his
[45:47] full manifestation
[45:49] Abraham was Fearless in his testimony
[45:52] brother Brandon said he talked about all
[45:54] the greats
[45:55] he said Abraham and Daniel and Noah and
[45:57] all of them they were Fearless in their
[45:59] testimony
[46:00] there wasn't nobody could tell him that
[46:02] God wasn't going to come through for
[46:03] them because they were Fearless in their
[46:05] testimony and Faith was expressed
[46:08] through the works
[46:10] think about it
[46:12] it showed that Abraham really had the
[46:14] faith
[46:15] when he went up there and he was willing
[46:17] to sacrifice when you're sick and we've
[46:21] had a lot of sickness going around
[46:22] but when you're sick it's hard for
[46:25] people to see that you actually have
[46:26] faith
[46:27] because you're sitting there and and
[46:29] you're just run down and and they're
[46:31] looking at you oh you don't have faith
[46:32] but when the healing comes nobody can
[46:35] deny the works
[46:36] if you don't believe me believe the
[46:38] works that I do and those Works aren't
[46:39] Just for Jesus they're not just for the
[46:42] apostles they are for you every one of
[46:45] you you say well why did I get over this
[46:47] cold a little quicker why didn't God
[46:48] keep me from getting covered why did he
[46:50] keep me getting cancer remember it looks
[46:53] like it's about ready to take your life
[46:54] but God has provided a lamb it looks
[46:58] like he's about to take you out but God
[47:00] was always standing there remember he's
[47:02] got the Angels sitting up here on the
[47:03] side and every one of them are just
[47:05] looking waiting and at the moment when
[47:07] it looks like you're just going to fall
[47:09] off the cliff they're standing there to
[47:11] catch a hold of you and God will never
[47:13] leave you you say well I love God and I
[47:15] have faith in God as long as things are
[47:17] going well that's not when God's going
[47:19] to show his his works but his show his
[47:21] works when it looks like you're going
[47:23] down when it looks like you have to give
[47:25] up it looks like I'll tell such a
[47:28] testimony sister Stephanie I love to see
[47:30] you in church because I can see where
[47:32] God is bringing you through and the
[47:34] trials that you've been through and
[47:35] you're still here anyway that shows
[47:38] there's faith in there every one of you
[47:40] been through something you say well it
[47:42] looked like I should have give up 20
[47:43] years ago or 30 years ago it looked like
[47:46] I shouldn't have been here tonight but
[47:47] you are here why because there's
[47:49] abrahamic faith in there even when you
[47:51] don't see it even when you don't feel it
[47:54] he's there to bring you through anyway
[47:56] even when it looks like all hope is gone
[47:58] I serve a God who specializes in things
[48:02] thought impossible
[48:05] in John 14 12 he said verily verily I
[48:07] say unto you
[48:08] he that believeth on me the works that I
[48:10] do shall he do also and Greater Works
[48:13] than these shall he do because I go unto
[48:15] my father and whatsoever you shall ask
[48:18] in my name that will I do that the
[48:21] father may be glorified in the son he
[48:24] said if you shall ask anything in my
[48:27] name I will do it so see you've got to
[48:31] believe that it'll happen and then you
[48:33] can cry out in the name of Jesus and it
[48:35] will happen if you have the faith to
[48:37] believe it so see it doesn't happen The
[48:39] Works don't come over here and I can't
[48:41] come down here with no faith at all and
[48:43] you start healing people and say I'm
[48:45] going to cast out Devils I'm not sure
[48:46] it'll happen no it'll never happen but
[48:48] if you believe it'll happen then it will
[48:51] happen it's not you that's doing it but
[48:53] if you can receive the faith within you
[48:55] then God Will Make The Works come to
[48:57] pass in your life but remember the faith
[48:59] has to be there first and then the works
[49:01] will follow he said the works will
[49:03] follow so if you go on down here brother
[49:05] Brandon said your faith is what God sees
[49:07] in you your works is what other people
[49:10] see in you
[49:12] so the people will see the works but God
[49:15] sees the faith they didn't see Abraham's
[49:17] Faith until they realized that God could
[49:20] produce a son
[49:21] then they're like oh Abraham's got faith
[49:24] and over here he takes his son up to be
[49:26] sacrificed well I and the lad will
[49:28] return
[49:29] but I'm taking him up to sacrifice him
[49:31] had he actually died up on the mountain
[49:34] it would have showed that Abraham didn't
[49:36] have the faith for his testimony
[49:38] because Abraham had the faith then it
[49:41] came to pass because he had the faith
[49:43] for the son in the first place he had
[49:45] the son and it came to pass but you have
[49:47] to have the faith and then the works
[49:49] will follow he said in the works is what
[49:52] other people see in you faith is what
[49:54] God sees in you so remember I may not
[49:56] see the works of God in your life but
[49:58] God sees the faith that you have and
[50:00] when you need that faith it will make
[50:02] something come to pass I believe there's
[50:04] people sitting here that's got children
[50:06] that are out there backslid I believe
[50:08] the faith that God sees in you is going
[50:10] to bring them children back to the Lord
[50:12] I believe it I may not see the works I
[50:16] may never see the works but I believe
[50:18] the faith is in you
[50:19] and I believe it's going to happen I may
[50:21] not know I may not even have the faith
[50:23] for your children but you do because if
[50:25] you're sitting here and you had faith
[50:27] enough for your own salvation and faith
[50:29] enough for the Holy Ghost then the
[50:31] children are coming home every one of
[50:33] them will be there he said I won't leave
[50:35] for one of them I won't lose a one of
[50:37] them oh I hope you hear me tonight
[50:38] church God is not going to leave you
[50:40] comfortless but the Holy Ghost came to
[50:43] show you that whatsoever you have need
[50:45] of every promise in the book is yours it
[50:48] wasn't just for Abraham it wasn't just
[50:50] for Isaac but it's for you because we
[50:52] had a provided lamb in our day who died
[50:55] to take away the sins of the world and
[50:57] he said I'm not looking at the sins no
[50:58] more but I'm looking at the blood and I
[51:01] see you as a perfect sinless spotless
[51:04] bride of Jesus Christ
[51:07] thank you so is faith that doesn't
[51:09] produce Works anyone has a right to
[51:11] doubt your testimony
[51:13] he said now do you hear it before we
[51:15] start the prayer line he's going into a
[51:17] prayer line he said if your faith
[51:18] doesn't produce works
[51:20] you can't make anyone believe that
[51:21] you're healed
[51:23] he said say well I don't know see yeah
[51:25] sure I got all the faith in the world he
[51:28] said you don't
[51:29] because if you are God if you got faith
[51:32] then works is married to Faith
[51:36] so the works will happen if you really
[51:38] have faith they're married together he
[51:40] says he said their husband and wife one
[51:43] identifies the other
[51:45] he said let that let's think of Abraham
[51:47] for just a few minutes
[51:49] he said Abraham got that Holy Union
[51:51] incomplete he got the whole thing
[51:53] together he called things contrary to
[51:56] his faith as though it was not
[51:59] now and he acted on the same principle
[52:01] now I hope you hear this just for a
[52:03] minute brother Branham goes into this
[52:04] and I just love this because it really
[52:06] breaks down the faith in the works and
[52:09] he said and acted on the same principle
[52:11] I can imagine he said after about 25
[52:12] years somebody come by and said
[52:15] father of Nations huh Abraham you said
[52:19] your name was Abraham which means father
[52:20] of Nations just how many children do you
[52:22] have right now Abraham
[52:24] he said that didn't stumble him one bit
[52:28] somebody come up and told you you're not
[52:30] healed of cancer what about that
[52:31] what about that God you serve that
[52:34] shouldn't stumble you one bit
[52:36] well why are your children out here in
[52:38] the world and backslidden that shouldn't
[52:40] stumble you one bit
[52:42] not one bit come on because they're
[52:44] coming back if you believe they're
[52:46] coming back one way or another they're
[52:48] going to make it if you believe
[52:50] and he said that didn't stumble him a
[52:52] bit he said the Bible said he staggered
[52:53] not
[52:54] at the word of God through unbelief he
[52:56] went right ahead making ready keeping
[52:57] all the booties ready in the bird eye
[52:59] and everything he was going to have the
[53:01] baby that's all even Sarah said you know
[53:03] what's going to happen you're going to
[53:05] have the baby but I tell you the way
[53:07] we're going to do it Hagar is my maid
[53:10] and I'm going to give her to you because
[53:12] polygamy was legal in them days and
[53:13] she'll have the baby and I'll take the
[53:15] baby myself but Abraham didn't believe
[53:17] that nope he wouldn't do it but Sarah
[53:19] was inspired to do it so God told
[53:21] Abraham go ahead listen to her but he
[53:23] said yet this is not what I promised you
[53:25] see man tries to make their own way and
[53:28] we try to we try to make our own path
[53:29] but remember God's already provided a
[53:31] way and a lamb he's already provided a
[53:34] perfect sacrifice he's in that watch he
[53:36] called anything contrary goes on he said
[53:38] and his body then dead Sarah's womb the
[53:41] same he was an old man 100 years old
[53:43] Sarah was 90 years old now notice the
[53:46] deadness of Sarah's womb where the
[53:48] deadness of this body wasn't even
[53:49] brought under consideration listen to
[53:51] this for the promise that he should be
[53:54] at the heir of the world was not to
[53:56] Abraham
[53:58] or to his seed through the law but
[54:01] through the righteousness of faith for
[54:04] it was by the by the law heir of faith
[54:06] is made void and the promise is not
[54:08] effect
[54:09] so if you're living under the law the
[54:11] promise is not effect he said because
[54:13] the law worketh wrath and where there is
[54:15] no law there is no transgression listen
[54:17] to this now why against hope
[54:20] all hopes was gone he said oh every time
[54:23] I go to feeling a little blue here's the
[54:25] chapter I turn to Romans 4 he said as it
[54:29] is written I have made thee a father of
[54:30] Nations before him whom he believed even
[54:34] God who quickeneth the dead and called
[54:36] those things which were not as though
[54:37] they were God said so brother Graham
[54:39] says see who against hope believed in
[54:41] hope that he might become the father of
[54:44] Nations now brother Bradham actually
[54:45] says hope is the enemy of God
[54:48] if it's in that way now there is there's
[54:49] there's different hopes there where
[54:51] there's there's the there's there's two
[54:52] different hopes and we won't go into
[54:53] that because I don't have time
[54:55] but the Hope can be the enemy of God
[54:57] well I just hope it happens but you
[54:59] actually have to believe it's going to
[55:00] happen and not just speak it that's a
[55:03] good start that's a good start but you
[55:05] have to go forward and not just speak
[55:07] good things but you actually have to
[55:08] bleed from your heart what the world
[55:10] hears you say is not necessarily going
[55:12] to matter it's what they see happen to
[55:14] you and he said he said he considered
[55:16] not his own body or the dentist and he's
[55:18] staggered onto the promise of God
[55:19] through unbelief but with strong giving
[55:21] glory to God at a hundred years old look
[55:25] his body now dead Sarah's womb dead it
[55:28] wasn't even considered when it's
[55:30] revealed to him that bed is not even
[55:32] considered you're paralytic or whatever
[55:34] you are isn't considered the wheelchair
[55:37] is not under consideration for the
[55:38] little boy he may be paralyzed or
[55:40] whatever it is he said it's not under
[55:41] consideration remember the sickness is
[55:43] not even under consideration when you're
[55:45] believing
[55:46] I don't care how bad the cancer got I
[55:48] don't care how bad my body feels I
[55:50] believe God's going to heal me anyway I
[55:52] believe he's already done it I'm just
[55:53] waiting on the works to be made manifest
[55:55] he said but the doctor said he'll never
[55:57] get out of here the doctor said she'll
[55:58] never come that's not even considered
[56:00] look I'm an old person I'm getting
[56:01] middle-aged not even considered we are
[56:03] the children of Abraham he said
[56:05] Hallelujah not as Isaac was but his
[56:08] Royal seed through Jesus Christ by the
[56:12] faith that he had Abraham's seed coming
[56:14] forth in the last days to shine like the
[56:17] stars
[56:18] you're coming forth as Abraham's seed
[56:21] with the same Faith with the same
[56:23] promise
[56:24] the same thing Abraham had you are not
[56:27] smaller than Abraham you are not a
[56:29] Lester the Abraham you are the Royal
[56:31] Seed of Abraham with a perfect sacrifice
[56:35] he said by faith that he had Abraham's
[56:37] seed coming forth like the stars
[56:39] Abraham's children he said and he didn't
[56:41] consider his own body now Dad we don't
[56:43] consider the deadness of our body we
[56:45] don't consider I know brother JT is in
[56:47] the hospital right now and if he happens
[56:49] to watch us I hope he can hear don't
[56:51] consider the feeling of your own body
[56:52] don't look at what the stroke did to you
[56:54] but look to the promise that healing is
[56:56] the children's bread
[56:58] he said God said he would do it why he
[57:01] was revealed to him remember faith is a
[57:03] revelation Peter had the faith and it
[57:06] was a revelation to him and brother
[57:07] Branham goes into that with Peter and he
[57:09] talks about how he was a Believer and he
[57:11] knew who he was by what faith he had to
[57:13] have faith to know who he was he said
[57:16] when it's revealed to you he said you
[57:18] can't make it happen it's got to be
[57:20] revealed to you then you don't even
[57:22] consider anything else how impossible it
[57:24] is don't consider what the doctor said
[57:26] you don't consider what your mama said
[57:28] or what your papa said or what the
[57:30] preacher said or what anybody else said
[57:32] you just consider what God Said and what
[57:36] he said is always right it may not be
[57:39] what I'll tell you I might stand right
[57:40] up here tonight and I could say
[57:42] something that would be wrong and I
[57:43] wouldn't do that intentionally but I
[57:45] could mess up and say something wrong
[57:46] but what God says and what his word says
[57:49] will always be true and it will always
[57:52] stay till the end it will hold you you
[57:54] didn't hold on to the word of God but
[57:55] that word will hold you and it will keep
[57:57] you and it will keep your family and it
[57:59] will keep your children's children I'll
[58:01] tell you it's time that we start having
[58:03] the faith of Abraham and start believing
[58:05] and acting like the children of God
[58:07] there's no reason to be beat down and
[58:09] acting like we're forsaken because
[58:11] you're not forsaken the comforter has
[58:14] come the faith is now producing The
[58:16] Works in the bride of Christ Greater
[58:19] Works shall you do greater work see one
[58:22] place he said more but greater I believe
[58:24] greater in this age it looks like
[58:26] there's nothing there's not a literal
[58:27] Jesus walking around that can lay hands
[58:29] on you the best thing we can do but the
[58:32] word said they shall lay hands on the
[58:33] sick and they shall recover the same
[58:36] faith in that is just as powerful as if
[58:39] you could touch the literal Corporal
[58:40] body of Jesus Christ why because it's
[58:42] faith in his word
[58:44] it's faith that does it
[58:46] he said he considered not his own body
[58:48] it wasn't even brother consideration oh
[58:50] my that just shakes me the body's dead
[58:52] or the deadness of Sarah's womb we're
[58:54] not even brought and we're not even
[58:56] brought under consideration
[59:00] so Where Your Children Are Tonight
[59:03] should not even be brought under
[59:05] consideration
[59:07] they're so far out there
[59:09] I don't even know I don't believe they
[59:11] could ever come back in my human
[59:13] I'm thinking up here with the with the
[59:15] mentals in the mind and you're thinking
[59:16] well they went so far maybe maybe
[59:18] there's children that could be the the
[59:20] turtle lesbian or gay and all these
[59:22] things and and you're like they can
[59:23] never come back God couldn't save that
[59:25] oh yes he can because he made a promise
[59:28] that thy and thy house shall be saved he
[59:31] said if you believe and accept the
[59:33] baptism of the Holy Ghost This Promise
[59:35] is unto you and to your children and to
[59:38] them that are far off remember the faith
[59:41] that Abraham had was to Isaac and to his
[59:44] seed but the faith that we have came
[59:46] directly from Christ himself when he
[59:48] sacrificed himself remember it was
[59:51] Christ that died so that you wouldn't
[59:53] have to die you could live forever and I
[59:56] believe that's the way it is tonight you
[59:58] don't have to taste death because a
[1:00:00] Rapture is coming and there's a promise
[1:00:02] of it and all you have to do is believe
[1:00:04] for it and God will make it come to pass
[1:00:07] he said he goes on and brother Graham
[1:00:09] talks but but I believe that the signs
[1:00:11] are following the bride if you don't see
[1:00:13] him
[1:00:14] you just don't see the faith that God
[1:00:15] sees
[1:00:16] God sees the faith you're seeing the
[1:00:18] works but God also sees things that
[1:00:21] you'll never see remember Abraham told
[1:00:23] them
[1:00:31] told his servants to stay
[1:00:34] so they didn't actually see the
[1:00:36] testimony right they didn't see the
[1:00:39] testimony but Abraham was there
[1:00:42] the lab was provided and the promise
[1:00:44] came to pass and it wasn't made of a
[1:00:46] spectacle or a show
[1:00:48] but God made it happen anyway he may be
[1:00:51] working in your children's lives and you
[1:00:52] can't even see it he may be working on
[1:00:55] somebody that that looked like they've
[1:00:57] never been in church in their life and
[1:00:59] he's working on them and you don't know
[1:01:00] when they'll be sitting here they could
[1:01:02] be called to be a preacher they could be
[1:01:03] called to be a deacon they could be
[1:01:05] called to be a Sunday school teacher God
[1:01:07] can use anybody he wants to as long as
[1:01:10] you just let God work and quit trying to
[1:01:12] get in the way because God is always on
[1:01:15] time his word is always true and he will
[1:01:19] bring everyone back that was ever
[1:01:21] ordained to be there so what we have to
[1:01:22] do is quit worrying and quit thinking
[1:01:24] about it all the time you can pray for
[1:01:26] him that's right commit him to God but
[1:01:28] God's going to take care of it God's
[1:01:30] going to do the work you say well I
[1:01:32] doubt sometimes I do too I look at
[1:01:34] situations and I see from the human side
[1:01:36] of it but I don't see what God sees and
[1:01:39] God sees the faith in that person God
[1:01:41] sees the faith in that mother that's
[1:01:42] been praying all night God sees the
[1:01:44] faith in that father who has done his
[1:01:46] best God sees every prayer he knows
[1:01:49] every tear that falls and he's going to
[1:01:51] bring that child back home you say why
[1:01:53] are you preaching on this tonight it's
[1:01:54] not really in my notes about the
[1:01:55] children coming back but I feel
[1:01:57] compelled to do it because somebody
[1:01:58] needs to quit doubting about their
[1:02:00] children somebody needs to just believe
[1:02:02] for it somebody needs to believe for
[1:02:04] their family when it don't seem like it
[1:02:06] don't seem possible but sister Stephanie
[1:02:09] she may have looked like she couldn't
[1:02:10] come back but she's here today and I
[1:02:12] don't mean to single you out but I see
[1:02:13] your parents sitting there praising the
[1:02:15] Lord and I know that they're happy but
[1:02:17] they prayed for you and the prayers
[1:02:19] worked and the prayers will work for you
[1:02:21] and you and you every one of you the
[1:02:24] prayers will work they don't ever one go
[1:02:26] out they never go out void but the
[1:02:28] children are coming back
[1:02:30] thank you Lord the children are coming
[1:02:32] back I don't know how I don't know I
[1:02:34] don't know what it'll take but they're
[1:02:36] coming back anyway you say well I maybe
[1:02:37] you're maybe you're a younger person and
[1:02:39] you're looking at your your parents
[1:02:40] maybe they're the ones that need to come
[1:02:42] back they can come back too all you have
[1:02:44] to have he said die in thy house shall
[1:02:46] be saved he didn't say the younger
[1:02:48] couldn't have faith for the older and
[1:02:49] the older could have faith for the
[1:02:51] younger but if you can have the faith of
[1:02:53] Abraham then every one of them is coming
[1:02:55] back
[1:02:56] God won't lose one of them
[1:02:59] if we don't stagger at the promises of
[1:03:01] God on we're not going to lose one of
[1:03:04] them
[1:03:05] what did Abraham do
[1:03:07] you staggered not at the promise of God
[1:03:10] the impossibilities
[1:03:12] he staggered not at the impossibilities
[1:03:15] oh yeah just go ahead and think about it
[1:03:18] you say well
[1:03:19] it's just it's just impossible
[1:03:21] my family is impossible maybe your own
[1:03:24] life you feel like it's impossible to
[1:03:25] move forward into the Holy Ghost you say
[1:03:28] well I I've went as far as I can go and
[1:03:31] it seems like I just can't go any
[1:03:32] farther can you take God at his word can
[1:03:35] you believe God that the Holy Ghost is
[1:03:37] yours it's a promise to you well I did
[1:03:39] not get it when I got baptized why
[1:03:41] didn't I get it the next year or the
[1:03:42] year after five ten years I don't know
[1:03:45] why but God is holding on to you because
[1:03:47] you're still here and God is going to
[1:03:50] get you one way or the other and he's
[1:03:52] going to bring you in and fill you with
[1:03:54] the Holy Ghost whether you feel like it
[1:03:56] or not
[1:03:57] he said what would a man 75 years old
[1:03:59] with a 65 year old wife do if they went
[1:04:02] to a doctor and said we want to make
[1:04:03] arrangements at the hospital we're going
[1:04:05] to have a baby brother Bill can I pick
[1:04:07] on you for a minute buddy
[1:04:09] Hey Brother Bill and sister Karen went
[1:04:11] down to the hospital
[1:04:12] and they said
[1:04:17] we want to make arrangements we're going
[1:04:18] to have a baby
[1:04:20] when's the baby due
[1:04:21] nine months I don't know it's coming we
[1:04:24] just want to reserve a room you know
[1:04:25] we're a little we're getting a little
[1:04:26] old
[1:04:27] well I know I know you don't get very
[1:04:29] many customers like us but but here we
[1:04:32] are
[1:04:33] and they would probably take you down to
[1:04:35] the insane institution you know brother
[1:04:37] Brandon said they would do that to
[1:04:38] Abraham
[1:04:40] but if God told you to do it
[1:04:43] then you'd do it anyway right no matter
[1:04:45] how crazy the world says you are you do
[1:04:46] it anyway
[1:04:48] and so brother Graham says what would
[1:04:49] the what would the hospital do
[1:04:52] he said 25 years later they went back
[1:04:54] and said doc
[1:04:55] you still holding the hospital open for
[1:04:57] us
[1:04:59] now you were 75 years old the first time
[1:05:01] now you're 100 going back down there
[1:05:03] and in 25 years you're going to be more
[1:05:04] than 100.
[1:05:06] you're gonna go down there
[1:05:08] doc
[1:05:09] walking there on your cane I imagine it
[1:05:12] 110 or whatever you'll be you'd probably
[1:05:14] have a cane at that point
[1:05:15] you walk in there doc
[1:05:18] doc we're we're still holding out we're
[1:05:20] gonna have that baby
[1:05:21] can you imagine the reaction
[1:05:24] you'd make the news for sure
[1:05:27] we're going to have a baby
[1:05:29] you keep the hospital open
[1:05:31] he said see it makes you act funny
[1:05:33] your decisions are odd to the world
[1:05:37] but it's a Believer no matter how
[1:05:40] strange it seems
[1:05:42] I love that you're a Believer no matter
[1:05:44] how strange you see
[1:05:46] if you go to work and they call you
[1:05:47] crazy for the way you dress and the way
[1:05:48] you act you're a Believer anyway I don't
[1:05:50] care what they say when you go up they
[1:05:52] can call you gone
[1:05:53] you're gonna be gone you're gonna be
[1:05:54] leaving it don't matter what they say
[1:05:55] you're going to be looking down and
[1:05:58] they're going to be sitting here and the
[1:05:59] bombs are going to be falling
[1:06:00] and you're gonna be up there
[1:06:02] and and think about it they were
[1:06:05] laughing at you
[1:06:06] and now you're really you're up On
[1:06:08] Eagle's Wings because the faith of
[1:06:10] Abraham was in you
[1:06:12] he said it makes you act funny but no
[1:06:14] matter how strange it seems the Bible
[1:06:15] said he was fully persuaded that God was
[1:06:18] able to perform what he said he would do
[1:06:22] now God was able to perform that he said
[1:06:25] that ought to be the achievement now I
[1:06:28] hope you hear this part that ought to be
[1:06:30] the achievement of every believer this
[1:06:34] afternoon
[1:06:35] God is able to keep every word that he
[1:06:39] said he would do
[1:06:41] God doesn't lie to people
[1:06:43] if he said he would heal you
[1:06:45] then he already did
[1:06:47] if he said he would save you in the
[1:06:50] finished work if he said thy in thy
[1:06:53] house shall be saved just believe it if
[1:06:56] he said he said forsake all and follow
[1:06:58] me it may not look like a good decision
[1:07:01] do it anyway and watch God go to bat for
[1:07:04] you watch God show up what it looks like
[1:07:07] he shouldn't be there watch God show up
[1:07:09] on the mountain when there's nothing
[1:07:11] around you and there's no life anywhere
[1:07:13] and it's just dead and there's a desert
[1:07:16] and you're looking down and you're like
[1:07:18] Lord I don't see nothing and you step
[1:07:20] down there and you go to sacrifice your
[1:07:22] son and God has come on the scene and he
[1:07:24] said go ahead Abraham he said just pull
[1:07:26] that hand back and take his life and he
[1:07:28] goes to do it and what happens next yeah
[1:07:31] guess who shows up guess who keeps his
[1:07:34] word the same God that always has and
[1:07:37] always will
[1:07:40] he'll never leave you
[1:07:42] that's where the comforter is so
[1:07:44] important
[1:07:45] peace of God
[1:07:47] the comforter has already come
[1:07:50] he's already come I will send the
[1:07:53] comforter which is the Holy Ghost he
[1:07:55] will come to you he will comfort you he
[1:07:58] will keep you in the time of trouble
[1:07:59] when it looks like that you can't go any
[1:08:01] farther and the midst of Trials and it
[1:08:04] looks like the mountain is too high
[1:08:07] your faith can pick up that mountain
[1:08:10] and move it and throw it into the sea
[1:08:12] because of the faith of Abraham now I
[1:08:14] would like to present this to you
[1:08:16] you may not feel like you have that
[1:08:19] faith
[1:08:19] but have you faced the mountain that
[1:08:21] needs moved yet
[1:08:23] if there's no other way
[1:08:25] then the faith is there to move the
[1:08:28] mountain
[1:08:28] if there's no other way then God made a
[1:08:31] way for the children of Israel to get
[1:08:33] through the sea there was no way around
[1:08:35] it they had to go through it if your
[1:08:38] situation is so dire that there's no
[1:08:41] other way sometimes God will say well
[1:08:42] maybe you need to look ahead and check
[1:08:44] out the word maybe there is another way
[1:08:46] but when there is no way God makes a way
[1:08:49] when there is no path God opens the sea
[1:08:52] when the Mountain's too high he can
[1:08:54] tunnel through it he can move the
[1:08:56] mountain he can move whatever he has to
[1:08:58] do because God is still God I hope you
[1:09:01] can see it tonight the god of Abraham
[1:09:03] the god of Isaac the god of Jacob is
[1:09:06] still God he's still here among us today
[1:09:08] he didn't change he said I am God and I
[1:09:11] change God he never changed he never
[1:09:13] gives up he keeps on keeps on keeping on
[1:09:16] because he's God and remember when he
[1:09:19] sent the holy ghost that was the
[1:09:21] comforter that would be in you
[1:09:23] and with you
[1:09:25] so when you feel like God's Not There
[1:09:28] that's just a false feeling from the
[1:09:30] Devil
[1:09:31] because God is not just with you he's
[1:09:34] not riding in the car with you he's in
[1:09:36] you
[1:09:37] you are the Bride of Jesus Christ that
[1:09:40] God has called and therefore you can do
[1:09:43] the same works that Jesus did because
[1:09:45] the works that Christ himself did he
[1:09:48] said you would do well I just don't see
[1:09:49] him brother Joel I don't see him have
[1:09:51] you looked at your own life and thought
[1:09:53] that that was the greatest miracle that
[1:09:54] could ever happen have you ever looked
[1:09:56] back and said that's where I was that's
[1:09:59] what I should have been but here I am
[1:10:01] I'm serving God today because he brought
[1:10:04] me out of the Maori clay because he put
[1:10:06] my feet on the Rock and he said you are
[1:10:08] my child and I'm not going to lose you
[1:10:10] he said Abraham take your son up there
[1:10:13] but you're not you're going to come back
[1:10:14] with him see Abraham knew he wasn't
[1:10:16] going to kill the child he just didn't
[1:10:18] know how long God was going to let it go
[1:10:19] before he had to pull that hand back and
[1:10:22] he was willing to kill the son knowing
[1:10:24] that God could raise him up because he
[1:10:26] had already received him as one from the
[1:10:28] dead so if God could bring him out of
[1:10:30] the deadness of a womb once he could
[1:10:32] bring him out of the death again and God
[1:10:34] will never leave you in a dead dry cold
[1:10:38] condition but he will give you the Life
[1:10:40] of Christ in you all you have to do is
[1:10:42] believe it all you have to do is believe
[1:10:44] it you have to walk out on it take it he
[1:10:47] said walk on don't stop that's what
[1:10:50] happened to the children of Israel they
[1:10:51] stopped but the promises were just ahead
[1:10:53] but it looked like they couldn't get
[1:10:55] there because the Giants were in the way
[1:10:57] it looks like you can't get across
[1:10:59] because the Giants are in your way it
[1:11:02] looks like the children can't come back
[1:11:03] because they've went too far but those
[1:11:05] are just Giants and we're more than able
[1:11:08] to take the land because we have the
[1:11:10] Faith of Our Father Abraham and because
[1:11:12] Jesus Christ himself has come down and
[1:11:15] in you today has sent the Holy Ghost to
[1:11:17] do the same works it's not my flesh that
[1:11:19] can do the works it's not even the
[1:11:21] physical touch but it's faith in the
[1:11:23] word that if I lay my hands on you you
[1:11:25] shall recover it's not my hands to do
[1:11:27] the healing it wasn't the woman that
[1:11:29] touched Jesus it wasn't a physical touch
[1:11:30] that did the healing but what it was was
[1:11:32] her faith in the promised son that had
[1:11:35] come it is not just the it's not your
[1:11:37] faith and your pastor you say well if
[1:11:39] you lay hands on me I can get healed
[1:11:41] remember that is true but it's not his
[1:11:43] physical hands that do it it is the
[1:11:45] promise coming to pass that if he lays
[1:11:48] his hands then you shall recover it's
[1:11:50] not just the physical of it but it is
[1:11:52] the god making his Works come to pass by
[1:11:56] your faith it is for Faith producing the
[1:11:59] works works is Faith expressed
[1:12:03] faith is not works expressed
[1:12:06] works or faith expressed
[1:12:09] and he goes on he talks about being
[1:12:12] funny and acting funny for the bill we
[1:12:14] went through this he said that ought to
[1:12:16] be the achievement of every believer
[1:12:17] this afternoon I don't care what the
[1:12:18] denominations say
[1:12:20] days of Miracles has passed all this is
[1:12:23] telepathy it's fortune telling it
[1:12:26] doesn't matter to me what they say
[1:12:29] I still believe
[1:12:32] is that your testimony today I don't
[1:12:34] care what this church down the street
[1:12:36] says I don't care what they say on the
[1:12:38] line about the message that I follow
[1:12:40] come on somebody
[1:12:42] else I don't care what they say I don't
[1:12:44] care if they call this a false prophet
[1:12:45] I've seen the works I've seen the works
[1:12:48] of Abraham I've seen The Works in his
[1:12:50] ministry show me your works
[1:12:53] show me what you've done he said how can
[1:12:55] you believe it if the works didn't
[1:12:56] happen I'm not going to go believe some
[1:12:58] TV evangelist that tells me they have a
[1:12:59] gift of God if they can't stand there
[1:13:01] and just like Abraham turn as the man
[1:13:04] that visited Abraham and gave him the
[1:13:06] promise he had to turn around and put
[1:13:08] his back to the tent and in our day an
[1:13:10] angel came and did the same thing in a
[1:13:13] man and he turned around and he
[1:13:14] discerned the people's thoughts if that
[1:13:16] don't build your faith and give you the
[1:13:18] faith of Abraham brother I don't know
[1:13:20] what will because we have seen the same
[1:13:22] sign Abraham saw
[1:13:25] same sign that came to Abraham has come
[1:13:28] to you
[1:13:29] think about it no other age saw that you
[1:13:33] said Jesus was here that's right he was
[1:13:34] the son of God that came but in just a
[1:13:37] mortal man
[1:13:38] that could stand there in the Pulpit
[1:13:40] just like I am he can stand here right
[1:13:42] now and he could turn and look this way
[1:13:45] and with his back he could call out any
[1:13:47] person in this room if he had never met
[1:13:50] you before and tell you exactly what's
[1:13:52] wrong with you where you live he could
[1:13:55] tell you your family's history
[1:13:57] you that was not a man that was God
[1:14:00] showing his Works in our day that he
[1:14:03] said I'm just showing you that the word
[1:14:05] is true he was only here to show you
[1:14:08] that what he promised would come to pass
[1:14:10] and remember it wasn't a man that we
[1:14:12] worship it's not just the band of 50 60
[1:14:15] years ago that was walking around on the
[1:14:17] earth that's not what we worship but the
[1:14:19] god that showed himself visible to the
[1:14:21] people it was God that showed himself a
[1:14:24] sign he was producing the same works of
[1:14:27] Jesus and that's why we followed him
[1:14:29] Jesus said if you don't believe me
[1:14:31] believe the works that I do because the
[1:14:33] works will show see Abraham had he made
[1:14:35] the claim I'm going to have a son
[1:14:39] and I'm going to call his name Isaac
[1:14:41] had he had that child with the other
[1:14:43] woman
[1:14:45] it wouldn't have been a a promise of God
[1:14:48] well I I had a child but it wasn't with
[1:14:50] Sarah like that like it was promised
[1:14:53] well then I can't believe the works that
[1:14:55] you do Abraham
[1:14:56] because your faith didn't produce the
[1:14:59] works that you said it would do
[1:15:00] but this faith will and that's the
[1:15:03] beauty of the story is that the faith
[1:15:06] did produce exactly what Abraham said it
[1:15:09] would produce
[1:15:10] and when brother Branham came in this
[1:15:12] day
[1:15:13] he he knew what the word said
[1:15:16] and he produced exactly what the word
[1:15:19] said he would do
[1:15:21] now I have to believe the message
[1:15:24] because I believe the word
[1:15:26] and the word shows me that the message
[1:15:27] was to come and so I have to believe it
[1:15:30] it's not following a man or a
[1:15:32] personality there's many of them you
[1:15:34] could follow
[1:15:35] yeah and I can I can show you many of
[1:15:37] them they would say well brother Branham
[1:15:38] was a was a real prophet of God but we
[1:15:40] don't believe his words what nonsense I
[1:15:43] mean you didn't know who Jesus was until
[1:15:44] he did the works right had Jesus never
[1:15:47] done a single Miracle you say well he's
[1:15:49] still been God I've heard the song but
[1:15:51] you wouldn't have known he was God
[1:15:53] and had he not done the works he
[1:15:55] couldn't have proved he was gone
[1:15:58] but he did the works that was promised
[1:16:00] of him and so did Abraham and so will
[1:16:04] you because you have the same promise
[1:16:07] it didn't have to stop with brother
[1:16:09] Branham now that was a gift where he
[1:16:11] could turn his back but the promise of
[1:16:13] of believing the promise of laying your
[1:16:16] hands on the people the promise of going
[1:16:19] into all the world and preaching the
[1:16:20] gospel and these signs shall follow them
[1:16:22] that what
[1:16:24] believe they had to have faith with no
[1:16:27] faith you're not a believer
[1:16:29] so if you have faith in God then you are
[1:16:32] a Believer then the works will follow
[1:16:34] and it's not just any works but it will
[1:16:37] be the same works that Jesus did it'll
[1:16:40] be the same Works made manifested
[1:16:41] Abraham's day it'll be the same Works
[1:16:44] made manifest right in our day because
[1:16:46] I've seen men that were dying with
[1:16:47] cancer that have still they're still
[1:16:49] going I'll take brother Ron Spitzer I
[1:16:51] was listening to him the other night the
[1:16:52] man was supposed to have been dead
[1:16:53] several years ago and he's still
[1:16:55] preaching the gospel today I can show
[1:16:57] you where a sister I believe I believe
[1:17:00] her I can't think of her name right off
[1:17:01] the bat but I could tell you particular
[1:17:03] testimony brother Joe Adams told you
[1:17:04] about it when he was here she was ate up
[1:17:06] with cancer they gave her just maybe a
[1:17:08] month or two to live but God
[1:17:10] miraculously took every cell of cancer
[1:17:12] out of her body
[1:17:13] you say well why isn't it happening to
[1:17:15] me you are the greatest Miracle of all
[1:17:17] of them because brought you from
[1:17:19] something he took you out of where you
[1:17:21] were and you're still here tonight
[1:17:24] you say
[1:17:26] if you could only see where I was
[1:17:29] see where I was 10 years ago
[1:17:31] there's no way I could see myself
[1:17:33] standing here tonight preaching to you
[1:17:35] if you could see where I was if you
[1:17:38] could see if I could look back at every
[1:17:40] one of your lives
[1:17:42] maybe you would never want us to see
[1:17:43] your life I heard a preacher say if if
[1:17:46] you could look through 10 years ago at
[1:17:49] what you were looking at on the internet
[1:17:50] and your social media accounts he said
[1:17:53] oh you'd want to burn that you wouldn't
[1:17:55] want to see that but God brought you
[1:17:57] through that because why he said greater
[1:18:00] is he that is in you than in he that is
[1:18:02] in the world greater is he that is in
[1:18:04] you than than pornography greater is he
[1:18:07] that is in you than the things on the
[1:18:08] internet that you shouldn't be looking
[1:18:10] at greater is he that is in you than the
[1:18:13] sickness that has tried to overtake you
[1:18:14] greater is he that is in you than all
[1:18:18] the Devils that Satan has every angel
[1:18:20] that Satan is gone he's got him coming
[1:18:22] down here trying to take our young
[1:18:23] people he's got him down here trying to
[1:18:25] take out our old people he's got them
[1:18:26] trying to take our families out of
[1:18:28] church what is it God trying to God is
[1:18:31] showing you today that you can't
[1:18:32] overcome by the faith but Satan's over
[1:18:34] here doing everything he can because he
[1:18:36] knows the end is near and he knows
[1:18:38] there's going to be a bride that will
[1:18:40] overcome all things and he said that
[1:18:42] bride is on the earth now I believed him
[1:18:44] I believe that things have happened that
[1:18:46] has to happen I believe that this
[1:18:47] generation is the generation that's
[1:18:50] going to see the finality of it all and
[1:18:51] you're going to see God come back you're
[1:18:53] going to see a man a literal body of
[1:18:55] Jesus come back and take you home with
[1:18:57] him
[1:18:58] brother Brandon said Believers believe
[1:19:00] that
[1:19:01] yes he said the literal body is coming
[1:19:03] back he said in Believers believe that
[1:19:05] I've got the quote in here he said
[1:19:06] Believers believe that he said that's
[1:19:09] the reason I do believe that when that
[1:19:11] bride is called out and elected and said
[1:19:13] in the Book of Life there will come a
[1:19:15] sound from heaven that'll take such a
[1:19:17] baptism of the Holy Spirit into that
[1:19:20] bride it'll take her from the earth in a
[1:19:22] rapturing Grace I love how he says
[1:19:24] because Grace is going to take you out
[1:19:27] of here Grace is going to take you home
[1:19:29] God promised it don't care how many
[1:19:31] science and how many astronauts they
[1:19:33] signed up and everything else and how
[1:19:35] many millions of miles they can see I
[1:19:37] don't care nothing about that there's a
[1:19:39] heaven and there is a literal Jesus
[1:19:41] Christ and there will come in a body
[1:19:43] form to receive his church to himself no
[1:19:46] matter how old the story no matter how
[1:19:48] it seems it can't happen it's still the
[1:19:50] truth and God said so he said that's
[1:19:53] what Believers believe
[1:19:55] that's what Believers believe there is
[1:19:58] coming a time when you don't have to be
[1:20:01] in this body no more brother Bill it
[1:20:03] could happen right now it could happen
[1:20:05] in the morning when you wake up and you
[1:20:07] look in the mirror and you're like oh my
[1:20:09] goodness I'm 20 years old again but it's
[1:20:11] going to happen it sounds like a story
[1:20:13] but it's gonna happen he said you would
[1:20:16] be turned back just like Abraham and
[1:20:17] Sarah that same Faith that's in you is
[1:20:20] going to turn you back like they were
[1:20:21] and it's going to take you in a Rapture
[1:20:23] just as sure as I'm standing here it's
[1:20:25] going to take you home
[1:20:28] he said that's what Believers believe
[1:20:31] we are believers today right
[1:20:33] so Believers believe what that the
[1:20:35] literal Body of Christ
[1:20:37] is coming back
[1:20:40] he said God's God said I'm the Lord
[1:20:42] heals all thy diseases
[1:20:43] I am God and I change not
[1:20:46] God is word and if God don't change how
[1:20:50] is the word going to change he said I am
[1:20:53] God and I change not the scripture says
[1:20:55] that God said it himself and if he
[1:20:57] cannot change
[1:20:59] then he is the word in the beginning was
[1:21:02] the word the word was with God the Word
[1:21:05] was God the unchangeable word and the
[1:21:10] Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us
[1:21:12] he said yes sir God raised up bodies all
[1:21:14] down through Moses Ezekiel Jeremiah and
[1:21:17] Isaiah Elijah's all down where his word
[1:21:20] temporarily come but the full word was
[1:21:23] made manifest in This Man Called Jesus
[1:21:26] Christ
[1:21:27] the full word was manifested there he
[1:21:30] said which he was God God in the
[1:21:33] fullness of the godhead bodily he said
[1:21:34] there he was made flesh he said I
[1:21:36] believe that every word so again a
[1:21:39] Believer believes that
[1:21:42] when God said I am the god that heals
[1:21:44] all thy diseases Believers believe that
[1:21:47] if God said thy in thy house shall be
[1:21:49] saved Believers believe that
[1:21:52] if he said by his stripes you are healed
[1:21:57] Believers believe that
[1:21:59] there's nothing can make you not believe
[1:22:01] that
[1:22:02] sickness can come
[1:22:04] right all kinds of spirits can come upon
[1:22:07] you and try to make you disbelief that
[1:22:08] pull you this way and pull you that way
[1:22:10] but greater is he that is in you and
[1:22:13] Believers believe that
[1:22:16] he said Christ was God's word may
[1:22:18] manifest
[1:22:19] I'm out of time I'm sorry Christ was
[1:22:21] God's word made manifest he died gave
[1:22:23] his life that he might send the spirit
[1:22:24] take his body up and send the spirit
[1:22:26] back
[1:22:27] he said pay the redeeming price he said
[1:22:29] if we'll believe it
[1:22:31] that's it right there if you believe it
[1:22:33] he that believeth on me the works that I
[1:22:36] do then come the Holy Spirit upon the
[1:22:38] same word of God now you say where do
[1:22:40] you throw it upon the Bible then the
[1:22:42] Bible has got to be in you the word is a
[1:22:45] seed as long as it's laying here it
[1:22:47] won't do nothing as long as it's laying
[1:22:49] here it won't do nothing he said but
[1:22:51] when it comes in here and when it comes
[1:22:54] in the heart then it begins to manifest
[1:22:57] by the Holy Spirit The Works of God I
[1:23:00] hope you can see this today and I I I
[1:23:02] may be pushing this in Russian a little
[1:23:04] bit here but but if you can just
[1:23:06] remember the works of God are coming and
[1:23:07] they're being made manifest not by you
[1:23:09] but by the holy spirit in you making the
[1:23:12] works manifest it's the faith in you
[1:23:15] that is producing The Works he said
[1:23:17] power comes humility comes all your
[1:23:20] know-it-all is gone you become nothing
[1:23:22] Christ becomes alive you die he lives
[1:23:26] there it is cause he died I live he said
[1:23:29] and when he lives again and when excuse
[1:23:31] me and when I die he promised me life
[1:23:34] and I died out to myself I died after
[1:23:37] this nature the sticky nature is always
[1:23:39] going to be there fighting but I died
[1:23:41] out to self in my thinking to take on
[1:23:43] his faith he said so and he lives again
[1:23:45] he said by taking his word his seed put
[1:23:48] his seed in here by faith and believe it
[1:23:51] and it produces exactly what the Bible
[1:23:54] said
[1:23:55] and it always will it will always
[1:23:58] produce everything the word says because
[1:24:01] it is a word seed that has been put on
[1:24:04] you inside of you and the Holy Spirit
[1:24:07] Waters the seed and brings it to life
[1:24:09] and brings to pass every promise of God
[1:24:13] thank you Lord he said we've went and
[1:24:14] made schools in Bible schools I'll hurry
[1:24:16] seminaries built fine buildings he said
[1:24:19] certainly that was not the commission he
[1:24:21] said that's all right I can't say
[1:24:22] nothing evil against him they played
[1:24:24] their part but he said but that wasn't
[1:24:25] the commission the commission was going
[1:24:27] to all the world and preach the gospel
[1:24:28] preaching the gospel was to demonstrate
[1:24:31] the power it had to be I love that
[1:24:35] demonstrate the power it had to be he
[1:24:37] says it had to be what's the next verse
[1:24:39] and these signs shall follow them that
[1:24:41] believe that's the manifestations the
[1:24:45] demonstrations are the works that the
[1:24:48] word made positive I love that the word
[1:24:52] made this so positive to us as we heard
[1:24:54] this morning and the word has come he
[1:24:57] said the word is preached signs of the
[1:24:58] word confirms the word to be true if it
[1:25:00] doesn't it doesn't come from the heart
[1:25:02] of faith it doesn't anchor in the heart
[1:25:04] of Faith he said did not Jesus say that
[1:25:06] some sowed seeds and when they did it
[1:25:08] fell by the wayside and the birds
[1:25:09] gathered someone in Stony ground and
[1:25:11] Riches of the earth choked them out like
[1:25:13] the Briars and so forth and didn't he
[1:25:15] say some went over and brought forth the
[1:25:17] hundredfold see you must first let the
[1:25:20] word fall in the right type of faith and
[1:25:22] then that Faith produces what the word
[1:25:25] says I love that the word will produce
[1:25:28] what the faith says all of it tonight
[1:25:32] the demonstrations are the words I'm
[1:25:33] going to skip down here and try to close
[1:25:35] I apologize way too many notes he said
[1:25:38] John the Baptist expressed his faith by
[1:25:40] his works when he said there stands one
[1:25:42] among you just think of that Saint John
[1:25:44] I got the scripture John 1 26 he said he
[1:25:47] said they said the Messiah is coming
[1:25:49] he said what's the matter with you we've
[1:25:50] been looking for him for 4 000 years see
[1:25:52] they didn't believe it but John did
[1:25:54] because he believed he was the one to
[1:25:55] four run it so many could say well I
[1:25:58] don't be the rapture's taking place but
[1:25:59] we see the Forerunner of that time so we
[1:26:01] know this is the day
[1:26:03] he said he said we've been looking for
[1:26:05] him for 4 000 years he said he's
[1:26:07] standing among you now
[1:26:09] he said so is he tonight
[1:26:13] I love it he's standing here tonight
[1:26:16] the old song Reach Out And Touch the
[1:26:18] Lord as he passes by I'll do one better
[1:26:20] oh yes look down into the heart of faith
[1:26:22] and realize he's right there in you
[1:26:25] he expressed his faith by his Revelation
[1:26:27] because it was revealed to him
[1:26:29] that he would baptize the Messiah
[1:26:31] you see the faith of Abraham you see
[1:26:34] every god-called man overcame and their
[1:26:38] testimony came to pass because of faith
[1:26:40] in the word and so will it happen today
[1:26:45] he says I'm going to start I'm going to
[1:26:47] try to close here I promise he said
[1:26:49] Abraham staggered not but he grew
[1:26:51] stronger all the time because he
[1:26:52] believed by faith
[1:26:54] what God would do
[1:26:55] job knew what he had done Jehovah's
[1:26:58] built Jehovah's bidding he knew that he
[1:27:00] had done Jehovah's bidding he had faith
[1:27:01] in what he done because Jehovah required
[1:27:03] it he said can we just do that Jehovah
[1:27:06] required a burnt offering for his sin
[1:27:08] and job not only for himself but for his
[1:27:10] children God had made a burnt offering
[1:27:12] he said that's all God he said oh you
[1:27:14] say that's all God required
[1:27:16] he said well he said I wish that's all
[1:27:19] he required today he said it's less than
[1:27:21] that
[1:27:22] oh my it's just faith in his word
[1:27:25] and he said if you make his word
[1:27:28] you're absolute as musicians go ahead
[1:27:30] and come if you make his word you're
[1:27:33] absolute now I'd like to just say that
[1:27:34] one more time we're not making a man an
[1:27:36] absolute we're not making a group an
[1:27:39] absolute
[1:27:40] but if you make the word of God you're
[1:27:42] absolute
[1:27:43] then you can have any Divine promise in
[1:27:49] the Bible and you can tie your soul to
[1:27:52] it
[1:27:53] I'm going to tie my soul to it tonight
[1:27:55] I'm going to stay here
[1:27:57] I'm gonna hold on and I'm going to keep
[1:28:00] looking forward I'm not staying over
[1:28:02] here on this side of the river I don't
[1:28:04] care how many Giants are over there to
[1:28:06] fight me I'm going anyway
[1:28:09] if God tells me to take everything I've
[1:28:11] got and try to sacrifice it
[1:28:13] I know that he'll provide another way
[1:28:16] and he'll do the same for you tonight
[1:28:18] you say my faith is weak
[1:28:21] well
[1:28:22] you don't have to have the weak faith
[1:28:25] you can just believe God
[1:28:27] and when your faith gets weak
[1:28:30] cry out to him Lord raise my faith
[1:28:33] in you
[1:28:35] give me that abrahamic faith and I
[1:28:38] believe it's there
[1:28:40] so when you cry out to him
[1:28:43] then God will make that Faith produce
[1:28:45] The Works do you believe that tonight
[1:28:46] can we stand together
[1:28:50] is your soul tied to the absolute the
[1:28:51] word tonight
[1:28:54] that I believe you can take hold
[1:28:56] thank you Lord Of The Wings of Faith do
[1:28:58] you know that song Wings of Faith if we
[1:29:00] try to sing that if there's a need here
[1:29:02] tonight if you have anything you need
[1:29:04] just come up here we still believe in
[1:29:06] laying hands on the sick
[1:29:07] the promise of God that you shall
[1:29:10] recover and we believe it tonight don't
[1:29:13] you can you bow your heads with him for
[1:29:15] just a moment
[1:29:17] heavenly father as we bring this to a
[1:29:19] close
[1:29:21] Lord if nothing else is said I pray Lord
[1:29:23] that that you would just
[1:29:26] show the people
[1:29:28] that it's not something they have to
[1:29:29] work into
[1:29:31] but it's the faith inside that will
[1:29:33] produce the works on the outside
[1:29:37] and Lord if there's one here tonight who
[1:29:39] needs
[1:29:39] their faith to be raised in you
[1:29:43] I pray that she would just anoint them
[1:29:44] tonight with the faith
[1:29:47] that Abraham had Isaac had
[1:29:49] [Music]
[1:29:51] and then the very lamb that we look to
[1:29:53] today as a perfect sacrifice is coming
[1:29:56] our day
[1:29:57] and he sent his Spirit to the church so
[1:29:59] that we could have the faith
[1:30:01] then not one of our children would be
[1:30:03] gone
[1:30:04] not one of our family has to go by the
[1:30:06] wayside
[1:30:07] but we just hold to the promises of God
[1:30:09] every one of them
[1:30:12] and lean on the word of God
[1:30:15] and God's word
[1:30:16] will bring to pass the works that he
[1:30:19] promised in this day
[1:30:21] if there's one in here that would want
[1:30:22] to put your hand up to him
[1:30:25] and ask Lord raise my faith
[1:30:30] there's a mountain in my way
[1:30:32] there's something in front of me that I
[1:30:34] just can't conquer
