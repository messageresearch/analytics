up the opportunity to worship oh God tell you how great you are how wonderful Lord you are in our lives and what you've done for us Lord on this Father's Day we thank you for the fathers that are here we thank you most of all that you are our father oh God we're so grateful for that today Lord I pray that you had anoint your word today I pray you'd meet every need somehow supernaturally Lord I I'm not a prophet I don't know the needs that are on these people's hearts but Lord you know today Lord you sent a prophet Ministry in our age that we could see that you know you knew the secrets of the art the sign of the Messiah our generational God we're so thankful for that Lord we believe that you're coming soon Lord we believe that we're already it's already begun the process the Lord has started one of these days we'll see our loved ones and we're so looking forward to that moment of that time I pray you'd bless us now we thank you for all that you've done for us we ask you to bless us in Jesus name amen amen John chapter one we're going to read from John 1 and 18. John chapter 1 verse 18. we'll read that one verse and I'll let you be seated thank you for being here today on Father's Day it's good to see all of you here and a few visitors that we have good to have you today Gavin good to see you today and brother Malachi back there and each one of you that have come and we've got some missing this morning as well but Joel's out preaching so remember him uh almost like having my own kid out there preaching the gospel you know and Joel's my brother but I really do appreciate brother Joel and I'll say that while he's not here so you don't get too too excited but the Joel just means a lot to me and um and so our our father passed away some years ago so I'm the um I'm not the oldest left in the family but maybe the one that sometimes the people they look to you know as a dad and I think well you know I couldn't fill that role but I thank the Lord for for what he's done in our lives and he gives us fathers that that we uh we didn't know we didn't know what to do without one but he gave us fathers to our lives he'll do that for us uh I wanted to say about sister Jewel I I knew her for some time and what a blessing she was in our lives and here recently she had been sending us little little uh coloring drawings that she had done she wanted to make sure she stayed in touch and she'd send us and that meant a lot to us that she had done that and I know she was a part of the church here for a while and we're just so grateful that she's gone on to meet her reward and no more suffering no more pain we're thankful for that and praying for the family as well amen John chapter 1 and verse 18. says no man has seen God at any time and I would say it like this this morning if you were looking for God as a Heavenly Father how would you you were looking for a father figure it says no man has seen God at any time how would you know what that Father Figure would be he said the only begotten son which is in the bosom of the father he hath declared him so we know what a father is because of the son amen God bless you can be seated I want to speak to you on seven attributes of fatherhood seven attributes of fatherhood there's some attributes of God that only a father reflects and there's certain parts of the life of a dad or father that are are a representation of God to his children and that God I remember when I was very young my father was God to us in the sense that he represented the strength in the family and he represented uh what we believed and he represented his word was the final Authority and so it meant something to have a father in my home and yet sometimes you know as as we get older I told you my dad passed away some years ago and and but God's given me other father figures that have filled that place and my brother JT is here this morning but the JT's been like a dad to me and I'm not afraid to tell you that brother JT because he's been that that figure for me for many years now and since I was a young man and and God gave me that God gave me a pastor brother Ivy I was there for 10 years and brother Ivey now we've at times disagreed like a father and son would but but God gave me brother Ivey for that time as a father figure and God will do that for you maybe your your father has gone on but we always need somebody to look up to and and people men in our lives I encourage you young people find a man in your life that you can look up to that you can emulate and yet many times we don't meet our dad's expectations I don't want to take a show of hands here today but I think if I did that well I didn't meet my dad's expectations in my life or I didn't always meet his expectations it it might be pretty close to a hundred percent and sometimes because of our failing as as children and sometimes because of the expectations of the dad maybe we're just a little bit too broad and and and we kind of do that don't we as dads we tend to expect a lot of our children I heard a story about the baseball player Keith Hernandez that uh he he was an All-Star he won numerous Gold Glove Awards and he was a he was a lifetime 300 hitter if that means anything to you as a if you're a baseball uh fan uh he was he was a really good guide one of the most valuable player award really good player and he talked about one day he called his father and and he says Dad he said I have a lifetime 300 batting average he said what more do you want and his father replied he said but someday you're going to look back and say I could have done more and we want to push our children a little bit don't we and and yet if you look at that in the reverse sometimes we don't always see the best reflection of a heavenly father in our own fathers and let's just be honest about it today it's Father's Day a day to honored fathers sometimes we don't see the best reflection and it's important that we recognize that Although our fathers are a reflection of God they are not God and they will make mistakes they're humans and the thing is as we grow up and we get older we make mistakes too and so we don't see the best reflection and I know many children especially Sons they become so discouraged because they don't see that reflection in their dad and so they begin to get discouraged and and they begin to they begin to turn away from the things of God because Dad was a Believer but this is what he did and I want to encourage you today don't do that but look to God who who your heavenly father who's perfect who does everything the way it ought to be done and and look at him don't look so much at us or even at me or or another father that would be here this morning look to God because he is our heavenly father sometimes we need to remind ourselves that God is different from our father in Hebrews 12 and 9 it says furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us and we gave them reverence shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the father of spirits and live said for they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure and we don't like to admit that but so much of the discipline that we do as dads we try to be just right in doing that but so much of it is based on how we feel and what mood we're in God never does that but but here he said they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure but he for our prophet that we might be partakers of his holiness and so you might look at that and you might say well as we said to begin with I I don't see how I could ever know God I I don't see how I could ever see what kind of father that he is and and though I feel his spirit and I know I know him in the word but how would I see him well he was revealed by the son no man has seen God at any time but the only begotten son which is in the bosom of the father he hath declared him he was in the bosom of the father there's a revelation of the godhead in that very statement that he was in the bosom of the father he hath declared him brother said he first was god Jehovah and out of him he said let's just picture now it's a little drama so you can get it let's see coming out of space where there's nothing let's make it a little white light like a Mystic light like a Halo and that was the logos that went out of God in the beginning that was the son of God that come out of the bosom of the father he said that was what was in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us in the beginning was God and then out of God came to logos a part of God that went out of God and God being the only Creature if we could say it that way the only being that can divide himself without making less of himself right and so God he he his son the son come from the bosom of God Oh my he declared God because he was God Hallelujah and so that word he declared God that's I interpret I I expound I explain I make a declaration he declared him how did he declare him by his life and by his words and so he he even came in his father's name you'll find that in John 5 43. he declared that he was one with the father in John 10 and 30. he said I and the father are one in Isaiah 9 6 it was promised that he would actually be called the father he said For unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father the Prince of Peace try to get a trinitarian to explain that to you today it's difficult because he is the Everlasting father yet he is the son now brother random says I used to think years ago that maybe God was angry with me but Christ loved me he said but come to find out it's the same person and Christ is the very heart of God he said I come from the bosom of the father come from his innermost being Christ is the very Heart Of God all that God was he poured into Christ so if we see what he revealed the father asks if he can we can see what he was we can see what he intends us to be and it would help us I think as fathers because we begin to realize that this is what we're supposed to be these are the attributes God once displayed in fatherhood but it would also help us as sons and as daughters we'd begin to see what kind of a god what kind of a father that we have because he is our father and I want to say first this morning as an attribute of God that your heavenly father is patient your heavenly father is patient now this is my worst flaw somebody said amen loudly this is my word all that Dad said amen this is my worst flaw a lack of patience and so many times I I find myself because to me to be on time is one of the the fruits of the spirit it's right up there with joy peace and and if you're not on time you won't have joy or peace you know and yet one of those other fruits is long-suffering or patience but to be on time of the day to me I I I've been late for maybe a handful of things in my life and I remember all of them they were traumatic experiences right and it doesn't matter what it's for I I don't like to be late I show up by the Daryl Ward laughed at me when he was here one time because he said I've never uh I've never seen the pastor for regular service two hours early when he didn't have to preach and but it's just the way I am I'm geared that way I got to be early my grandpa was that way Grandpa Pruitt he he said if you if tell me you're going to be there at 10 o'clock you show up at 10 05 you lied to me that's that's just the way that he was but God is patient aren't you glad that he is she got he's not like us sometimes I I get so impatient with my family but God's not like that Matthew 5 43 you have heard that hath been said Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate that enemy but I say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you now he's telling us to act in a certain way because our father in Heaven acts that way he's declaring the attribute of the father to us and really this attribute is patience with people because God could wipe them all off the earth now if you had the power to wipe everyone off the Earth you might have already done it if I had the power I might have already done it if I could speak things in and out of existence just on a whim I might have already used that Authority but God does not oh my God suffers long oh my and so what he does he says if you're this way if you love your enemies if you do good to those who will never change you think about that for a minute it's not that you're doing good to people hoping that they'll change but Jesus was doing good to those who he knew would never change it was not in an effort to change them it was an attribute of who he was oh my and because he was the son of the father are you with me now Matthew 5 45 that you may be the children of your father which is in heaven for me he maketh the son to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth Reign on the just and on the unjust I think people who leave church or who backside of her who are not sure of their Christian faith they they tend to question this the most why does God allow bad things to happen to good people and conversely why does he allow good things to happen to bad people why do people that are bad win sometimes and people that are good lose many times and we don't comprehend the extreme patience of God of an immortal being who who has no time limits who can be wherever he wants to be at any moment in history who does not live in time we we cannot wrap our minds around that and so we think well well and that's where David stood one day and he said Lord why do you allow these things to continue why do you allow bad things to continue to happen to people and David stood there and he and he's wandering he's wrestling with that but then he said I saw their end and you realize there is coming a day that L wrongs will be made right there's coming a judgment day there's coming a time when things shall be said in order they'll be right but it's the patience of God that allows us to live right now and allows the flowers to bloom and the sun to come on the earth and the things to happen the way they do the the thing is not you know when you look at when you look at the world really the question we should be asking is not why is there so much suffering in the world but why is there so much good because we've done everything we can to mess it up we've done everything as a human race we've done everything wrong and yet the heavenly father he suffers with us now he doesn't just suffer with the good he doesn't just suffer with the elect he suffers with those who knowledge so many young people grow up in church and become hurt because they get hurt by church people and they don't understand why God suffers with those people why does why why do they get anointed why can they sing why can they come to church why can they act like that in church and then they hurt me why are they able to do that and I've watched so many pastors kids so many young people and I say to my own children you just have to you just have to recognize the sovereignty of God and realize there is a day coming there is a Time coming when things will change there is a day coming when things will be perfect but it's not today and it won't it maybe not won't be in our lifetime but it's coming and so what do we do we love those that hate us and do good to those who don't do good to us he said for if you love them which love you what reward have you you do not even the public is the same if you salute your brethren only that's nonsense well I can only be good to people in my church where did that come from oh that's against the scripture if you salute your brethren only what do you more than others if you're only kind to those who who are good people or go to church with you what the Sinners do that what do you more than others do not even the public and so be therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect in other words be be mature be be complete be be a son of your father as Earthly fathers it's easy to get impatient but God blesses even those who are not his for a Time God has a family how many believe that today he has a right to have a family he has elect that are his their children I believe you're his children this morning you're his children his elect his elector is he has a right just like I have a right to have a family right he has a right he's a father he has a family and he has children but now those children there's others that are not his children huh is that right there's some that are not his children there's some there's some that are on the Atlanta The Book of Life that are there because they've repent and give their hearts to God but they're not his elect there's others who are uh just against God they're uh they're they're just uh they're they're just have a wrong seed and they're just never going to serve God and yet The Sun Shines on all the rain falls on all and hardship even comes to the believer and to the elect and it's difficult for us to understand but God is patient he's patient the Bible says the Lord is not slack concerning his promise some men count slackness but it's long-suffering to us word aren't you glad that he is not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance he was patient with Cain who had a different father but he gave him a second chance he was patient with Esau could have received the birthright but he sold it he blessed Ishmael made him a great nation even though Ishmael would always persecute Isaac this is what he says about himself the Lord passed by before Moses and proclaimed the Lord the Lord God merciful and gracious long-suffering abundant in goodness and Truth keeping Mercy for thousands forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin aren't you glad that he does and that will by no means clear the guilty visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children upon the children's children unto the third and to the fourth generation he is patient but I'm glad he's also patient with the elect I'm glad he's patient with the elect because many times we don't get it we don't understand we're just like children we just don't understand and our perfect Heavenly Father you know you look at our own fathers I remember one time my dad got all upset dad would get upset if you couldn't do things right or wouldn't do things right and and he wanted things done a certain way and we were stretching barbed wire one time down in the farm and and you take a barbed wire if you buy cheap barbed wire it tends to snap when you stretch it to its full extent and we had uh we had a one of those things that would would make it stretch and and as we were going down there we'd string it out and then we'd stretch it and it'd snap and my older brother was doing that and he did that twice and snapped both times and dad got so mad you know and uh don't don't get a Halo above your head you probably have two at some point and it wasn't Sam's fault it was the Jeep barbed wire and that was proved later because Sam got Sam got upset and he walked back up to the house and wasn't very long here come dad walking back up it snapped on him too yeah because our fathers aren't perfect but when Jesus look how he dealt with Peter Peter he was so long suffering and patient with Peter see Jesus always did things right he always did things right he was never wrong in in his criticism or in his in his encouragement he was never wrong in those things and yet Peter over and over again stuck his foot in his mouth and said the wrong thing at the wrong time and and over and over again Peter he even denies Jesus three times and Jesus knowing that he would oh he knew that you would backside he knew that you would fall but he loves you anyway and he's Before Peter ever backslid he looked at him and he said he said when you get converted strengthen your brethren he said I prayed for you oh aren't you glad that he prayed for you too he said not only them but also those who come under their word amen he prayed for you and he said when you're converted go strengthen your brethren what was he doing display the attribute of the father showing us who the father was if he can be that patient with us shouldn't we be patient with our children your heavenly father it's not only patient he's observant sees he sees I can't count the times that I failed to see or failed to observe until it was a little bit late and then it caused a hurt sometimes we do that we just don't see the big picture so many people are not self-aware they just can't look at themselves and see you know my family would be better if I didn't do that and yet they think it's a good quality or the church would be better if I didn't do that but but they can't see that because we're not observing many times but God sees everything [Music] he sees you in fact he says when you when you do alms in other words when you give money away when you give money away to charity or give somebody something let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth that thing almost may be in secret and thy father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly he sees what you do not just in church but at home and he knows everything you do he said in Matthew 10 29 are not Two Sparrows sold for a farthing and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your father but the very hairs of your head are all numbered I'm glad for that today see you not there for you're more value than many sparrows he sees you he sees everything again in Isaiah 40 21 1 he said have you not known have you not heard hath it not been told you from the beginning have you not understood from the foundations of the earth it is he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth now this was before even that they knew that the Earth was round science thought probably that the Earth was flat or at least it wasn't it wasn't a ball But Here Comes God speaking of the prophet Isaiah and it says he it is he that sent us on the circle of the Earth because if he sits on the circle of the earth he can see it all and the inhabitants thereof or as grasshoppers that stretches out the heavens as a curtain spreaded them out as a tent to dwell in he sees every thing again in Psalms 11 4 says the Lord is in his holy Temple the Lord stone is in heaven his eyes behold his eyelids try the children of men he sees you he sees you even before you can see him before you can recognize him well I'm so glad for that today even before you make a mistake he sees it even before you came to him he saw you and he showed that he expressed that through Jesus ministry when Nathanael come to him and he began to speak to nathaniels to behold an Israelite and whom there's no God and Nathanael said unto him when SnoWest thou me and Jesus answered and said unto him before Philip called thee when thou was under the Fig Tree I saw thee I saw thee Oh do you believe he sees you today do you believe that he sees you today that ought to that ought to stir us up a little bit I don't make us because when many times we look at this and think oh it's a bad thing that he sees the snow he knows anyway he knows what's going on he knows the depths of our of our sin and our depravity and everything else but he also sees us he knows us he knows that what we need he knows our needs he knows our our down sittings our Uprising everything that we have need up through the day he knows when we're in trouble he knows when we're afraid he knows everything about us that ought to stir us up a little bit we have a father who never misses one thing oh God oh I want to be that kind of a father but being human it'd be impossible for me to see everything but he sees everything and he sees me he also sees even the non-elect and they keep going back to that but it just shows us the bigness of God when they come to him he responds right and that's why it's so hard for some people to understand and say well only the elect filled the presence of God that's just not true I've been in many places worshiping in denominational churches where I felt the presence of God and it's the same presence that we feel because he honors it when people sing when they worship when they come to him he honors that it's the same rain that falls on the just and the unjust but the brown is making an altar call and he says this many many times in the message but here he said God bless you Sister back there he sees you he said if you believe me to be his servant when you raised your hands with a sincere heart oh my God when you raised your hands with a sincere heart the recording angel sticks your name right on the book now actually the elect child of God he my name was on the book before the foundation of the Earth right but if this is a person whose name wasn't there but he says that when he sees you oh don't be afraid to come to him today you may say well I'm not the elect I've done too much wrong I've done this out of the other but you come to him let him do the dividing let him do that part come to him all that will come to me he said let him that comes to me I give up his heavy burdens I'll give him rest me all you that are weak all you that are weary and heavy laden and I will give you rest all that are weary and heavy laden amen even those who are not attacked he sees and puts her name down oh my well I don't believe we should ever quit calling for sinners and witnessing the sinners we should never we should never neglect baptizing people and and witnessing the people and being the church because we don't just impact the elect but he sees even the not elect he sees how we treat them we're going back to Ishmael I said that he saw or Ishmael he treated Ishmael right he was the son of Abraham he told Abraham he said because he's your seed but he wasn't the elect seed right but because he was your seed he said I'll make a great nation out of him and he is a great nation he became a great nation a great people and and Islam Today it still is a thorn in the sight of Israel but God made them that and and there was a time when when Hagar was there and she began to get she began to get uh worried because Sarah began to persecute her you remember the story and she had gotten pregnant and Sarah realized she'd made a mistake and she gets upset at hagorn blames Hagar for her mistake and she sends Hagar out in the wilderness Hagar is the Egyptian Hagar is is not God's perfect will it's not that was through Sarah the seed would come through Sarah and yet God saw the Affliction of Hagar and he saw her out there in the desert and here she was out in the desert and as she's out in the desert and she's and she's she's getting to a place where she's not going to live anymore she's just not going to make it she can only make it so long the angel of the Lord appeared to her it was God speaking to her and called out to her and began to tell her go back to Sarah you're going to be okay the child that's born of you is going to live you know the story and at that time she she began to call on God she may have never known God before she may have never accepted him but in that time she began to call on God and she called the name of the Lord that's spoken to her thou God sees me thou God seized me for she said have I also here looked after him that seeth me she was also seen by God don't let the devil put in your mind say well maybe you're not feel like maybe God don't care about you he cares about those who care he cares for those if you care enough to raise your hand if that's all you can get out this morning it just erased your hand he cares about that if you come to the Altar and your heart is broken and you're worried about things in life he cares about that if you're worried about your family he cares about that if you've got something going on in your life he cares for you oh my your heavenly father is also forgiving he said if you forgive men their trespasses of your heavenly father will also forgive you mean so much to me God help me to be a forgiving father Jesus displays this over and over again in his ministry in his life never more than on the cross we stood there and we've preached on it but he stood there said father forgive them for they know not what they do and he's not speaking because they would ask for forgiveness they would go ahead and crucify him they wouldn't recognize his benevolence they they were not the seed of God they in fact he said you're of your father the devil he had already identified who they were and yet he prayed for those same people not because of who they were but because it was an attribute of God forgiveness is it was part of him father forgive them and then you see when the Holy Ghost came on on the people and it began to come on on the people of God they became forgiving and you see you see the uh you see the one that was down there and he began to pray to God and he was being stoned Stephen as he was being stoned you see him being stoned and Paul is standing there and this attribute of God that was on the cross was also in Stephen and he said father they don't know what they're doing he wasn't doing it because it saved to him it didn't maybe make no difference to them but there was an election of God standing there holding the coach at that time and he saw something in Stephen that maybe he didn't recognize for many years but he could go back to that moment and say at that moment I realized God cared he forgives if he could forgive why can't we Branham talked about the lady in the cafe you've all heard the story I don't mean to belabor the point this morning we talked about the lady that that was standing there and or was sitting in the seat he said he went in this Cafe because everything else was closed and here was people drinking and people a policeman playing a slot machine and it grieved his heart the kind of music that was being played he grieved his heart he didn't understand what was going on and he walked in there and he began to forget judgmental and critical so many of us do that today we get judgmental we get critical we don't realize we're hurting people not helping them but standing there was a judgmental attitude a critical attitude why is this music being played why are these people doing like they're doing here's the law standing there breaking the law here's a woman sitting there with several men and probably got pain all over her face and everything else I know he's sitting there thinking like that he has a vision and he sees he sees the Earth and he sees it rotating and he sees the uh he sees Jesus standing there and he sees in the type of division he sees the father and here he said Jesus was standing there and he had a book and had his name he said then it was everything he'd ever done that was wrong and he said here he was on the earth he said I saw myself doing things that were wrong he said and as I did it he said it would come up he would fly up to the father he said but through it's like a bumper he said like a bumper on a car there was a mist of blood that covered the Earth and that blood covered over all the Earth and and he said every time he would hit that blood it would it would come back on Jesus he said he'd Flinch and hit him and he flinched and he'd write down on it pardoned and he asked he said is that the sins of the world he said no that's your sin that's your sin he said I come out of the vision I realized I couldn't be critical of her and he went and led her to the Lord in that place told her about the vision letter to the Lord don't you realize that he's today he was what was he doing displaying the attribute of the father he forgives and brothers said every time when Jesus was standing there he'd take that page you wrapped pardon on in his own blood and he'd throw it in the sea of forgetfulness that's where my sin is today that's where your sin is why couldn't we forgive somebody else especially our children your heavenly father caring don't seem like it's about attributes of fatherhood you expect Manliness but these are manly attributes attributes of your heavenly father your heavenly father is caring he said behold the fowls of the air because if so not neither do they reap nor gather into barns get your heavenly father feedeth them are you not much better than they which of You by taking thought can add one cubit to a stature in other words you you can't make yourself taller even though you'd want to well I think you thought for Raymond consider the lilies of the field how they grow they they don't they told not neither do they spin yet I say unto you that even Solomon and All His glory was not arrayed like one of these wherefore if God's so clothed the grass of the field if he's that good of a provider that he provided water for a fish to swim in and a fish to swim there and he provided have you ever noticed the way the ecosystem works and different animals feed off one another you ever thought about that he provides the he provides the grass for the deer and he provides us a deer for me right at least if somebody else kills it I had a dream last night that I killed a deer I just remembering that I woke up I had a dream I killed deer out of season and brother Harvey was helping me cover it up we'll just let that pass it may not be a spiritual dream foreign brother Bill you're gonna have to get after me but he cares if he's that good of a provider he can provide the fish for me to fish he can provide the he can provide clothes for the lily that's what he said he can provide things for The Sparrows to eat if he can provide bugs and all the different things that work together and if you take any one of them out the ecosystem would come crashing down but it all works together why because of the provision of a of an all-knowing God an all-caring God if he closed the grass to the field how much more shall he clothe ye over ye of little faith the Bible says that he cast out Devils with his finger how many know that today he cast out Devils at his finger Luke 11 20 if I with the Finger of God cast out devils no doubt the kingdom of God has come upon you but brother Randall said notice when he went after the lost sheep that's you and I it wasn't his finger he took the lost sheep and put it over his shoulders he said how he cares for a lost sheep one that's straight out of some of them formal ungodly places in the desert and Wilderness out there he goes and gets him puts him over his shoulder seals him full of the Holy Ghost and sends him back to the fold he said the devil's just no more to Jesus he just kicks him out with his finger and goes on but the lost sheep he goes and hunts him up and lays him over his shoulder holds his legs like this and the most powerful part about a man is across his shoulders you know that lays it around his neck and cross his shoulders and here he comes packing him through the Wilderness what is it he cares shouldn't we care for our children number five your heavenly father giving he's giving boy got quiet but he's giving if a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father will he give him a stone if you ask a fish will he for a fish give him a serpent think about it if you shall ask an egg will he offer him a scorpion a little boy comes up to you and oh this is going to be great fun I'm going to give him a I'm gonna give him a stone instead of bread you don't think like that you give your son said if you've been being evil know how to get give good gifts into your children see you give and you might gripe about it you might complain about it you might worry about them but if you being evil know how to give good gifts into your children how much more shall your heavenly father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him oh Hallelujah he said look how your Earthly parent before you came here before they knew you was coming made ready for your coming just think of that now your Earthly parents which an Earthly parent is only a type of a Heavenly parent if we know how to give good gifts to our children how much more does your heavenly father know how to give good gifts to his children they prepared you're coming but listen he is preparing you're coming there yeah he said let not your heart be troubled you believe in God believe also in me in my father's house I love that I love that in my father's house are many mansions many mentions brother Brown said many types of Tabernacles if it were not so I would have told you I'd go to prepare a place for you but the father he said knew that you would be here prepared everything for you before you got here your first coming here he had it ready for you when you got here isn't that marvelous to think of what he done he said but remember these are only temporal gifts and type we know that Moses and building the Tabernacle in the wilderness preparing it he said he made all things after the order of what he saw in heaven so the Earthly things only expressed what the Eternal things are and if this Earth that we live in today being so great as we love it and love to live and breathe the air and feed the flowers and things he said if that this here is the expression one that's dying is only expressing one that's Eternal when you see a tree struggling pulling trying to live that means there's a tree somewhere that doesn't have to do that when you see a man struggling to live somebody in the hospital or in a sick bed or in an accident struggling and the death rattles in their throat pulling and crying and screaming for Life what does that mean there's a place somewhere there's a body that doesn't struggle and scream for that it just doesn't do it he said now they're only temporal gifts to us these things that we have here in the Earth are temporal gifts God gave them to us he said only expressing that there is one where it's the Eternal one that's what Jesus has gone away to prepare the Eternal one for us he said I go to prepare a place for you shouldn't you want to give good gifts to your children I'd say as a father the greatest gift we could give our children is our time your heavenly father is merciful he's merciful Luke 6 36 be you therefore merciful as your father also is merciful judge not and you shall not be judged condemn not you give forgiven give and it shall be given unto you I love this good measure in other words give you a little extra like you are going to a store that you frequented and the person wants to treat you right and back when they had to take it out of a flower sack and they they put the flour in your own vessel or or something that you brought they'd put in there but they didn't just give you flour they didn't just give you sugar but they gave it to you with a good measure they didn't try to cheat you press down compacted together shaken together so it would settle so they could put more in and running over amen he said shall men give unto your bosom if you give people give like that to you for with the same measure that you meet with all that shall be measured to you again the merciful obtained Mercy he said blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain Mercy he had mercy on The Sinner in Matthew 9 and 10. he says it came to pass as Jesus said it meet in the house behold many Republicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples and when the Pharisees saw it they said it to his disciples why eateth your master with publicans and sinners but when Jesus heard that he said unto them they that be whole need not a physician but they that are sick but go you and learn what that meaneth I will have mercy and not sacrifice I have not come to cause the righteous but Sinners to repent repentance but the brand them again at an altar call he said little children many of them put their little hands up God be merciful to them many of the old in the middle age they put their hands up the teenagers put their hands up they're wanting mercy God I'm so glad to know that the first revelation of Christ is Mercy the second Revelation is judgment listen to me as fathers we need to approach our children that way our first revelation ought to be Mercy we shouldn't be looking for reasons to condemn we shouldn't be looking even with our brothers and sisters we shouldn't be looking for reasons to find fall our first revelation has to be Mercy his first revelation was Mercy his second was judgment he said oh God thank you for those who have taken Mercy tonight Mercy's Road blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain Mercy blessed are they do hunger and thirst for righteousness they shall be filled and finally your heavenly father is great great oh my I think we sing that sometimes without really thinking about it he's great John 10 29 Listen to How Great he is My Father which gave them to me is greater than all Hallelujah he's so great but Brother David I can't even remove myself from his Mercy amen that's great I think of that song often prone to wonder how how I feel it prone to leave the Lord I love here's my heart now take conceal it seal it for thy courts above the lyric runs through my mind constantly because I think Lord I'm prone to wander seal my heart feel me and I don't say that because I don't have the Holy Spirit but I realize this is a body of Flesh and every day I need to be refilled by the Holy Spirit I need to be refilled me but he is greater than all no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand no man is able quit looking at what people think about you your God is great your father is great what was he doing he was revealing the greatness of the father he was bigger than the storm how many believe that today bigger than the hunger of the five thousand bigger than death itself at the grave of Lazarus big enough to take care of you and me glory to God he's a big God but the brand called him a big father eagle we've talked about that recently but I come back to it today it just seems like it fits in he said I can see the big father Eagle as he's walking around over the nest he loves to look at his children I love that I do that I like to look at my children even during church I see what they're doing and I put my glasses on to see it but I love to look at my children I like to see how they grow I like to know that they're around I don't like them to be too far away why because they're they're a reflection of being and no matter you know there's something about being a father that there's Mercy in that because no matter how bad you mess up if you've got good kids you can always look at that and say I got good kids hey man somebody he said he loves to look at his children oh my how he loves to look at them how do they look look just like he does Oh my he said they're not hybrid they're not half buzzard and half Crow and something else they're Eagles hey man he knows it's children

More Than This should he do because I go to the father amen Oh my he said these signs shall follow my eaglets amen they'll do just as I do if my spirit's in him they'll do the works that I do if they don't do the works I do it's because my spirit's not in them he said God wants English he wants Messiah he wants men and women who have signs and wonders anointed ones he wants a church that's filled with the Holy Ghost do you believe that today a church reflecting him the same yesterday today and forever God didn't die he just born the kingdom got his Messiah it's in it every word he says they say Amen to it that's right yes sir they look like him act like him they believe it got the conductor moving right on out with signs and wonders following that's the messiah messiah lives tonight he

great God I'll be honest with you I want so badly to display all of those attributes in my life as a father with your head's bow and your eyes closed today but I know that I can't in perfectness I strive to but only by his Spirit living in me will I ever become observant and caring big big enough to be little but the man talked about the king of England that come by and everybody was crying the King was coming through it meant something to him I don't mean anything to us but to those people that did here come the king buying there was a little girl standing there she got all ready and she
