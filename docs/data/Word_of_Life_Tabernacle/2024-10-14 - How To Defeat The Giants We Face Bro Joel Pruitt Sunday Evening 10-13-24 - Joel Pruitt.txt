forgiven tonight can you say amen and who the son is set free is free indeed amen if you have your Bibles that'll be all the singing we'll do tonight we'll get right into it and I'll try not to hold you long you kids you hold me to that if you want to and I don't have many notes and that's usually dangerous because then I get to go off script and next thing you know I'm brother Logan we'll get you out of here in time to go to work tomorrow I promise so we'll uh but it's good to have you each one of you here you young people I want to try to kind of uh speak to you all tonight and and maybe if I can stay on somewhat of a thought here maybe you can get something out of it and I hope it'll bless you if you have your Bibles uh 1st Samuel chapter 17 1 Samuel chapter 17 if I could title this tonight it would be how to defeat the Giants we Face how many's ever faced a giant or an obstacle or a trial or a test whatever you want to call I'm sure every one of us have faced it and if you haven't you're getting ready to so let's just read about it here for a minute we'll just go 15 verses on this one uh chapter 17 verse one and now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle and were gathered together at shoka which belongeth to Judah and pitched between shoka and azika and and ephes deim and Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together and pitched by the valley of Ella or elaw and set the battle in Array against the Philistines and the Philistines stood on a mountain on the one side and Israel stood on a mountain on the other side and there was a valley between them and there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines named Goliath of gath whose height was six cubits and a span and he had a helmet of brass upon his head and he was armed with a coat of male and the weight of the coat was 5,000 shekels of brass and he had Greaves of brass upon his legs and target of brass between his shoulders and the staff of his spear was like a Weaver's beam and his Spear's head weighed 600 shekels of iron and one bearing a shield went before him and he stood and cried un the armies of Israel and said unto them why are you come out to set your battle in Array am not I a Philistine and you Servants of Saul choose you a man for you and let him come down to me and if he be able to fight with me and to kill me then will we be your servants but if I Prevail against him and kill him then you shall be our servants and serve us and the Philistines said I defy the armies of Israel this day give me a man that we may fight together when Saul and all of Israel heard those words of the Philistine they were Philistines they were dismayed and greatly afraid now David was the son of eph of Bethlehem Judah whose name was Jesse and he had eight sons and the man went among them for an old man in the days of Saul and the three eldest sons of Jess he went and followed Saul to the battle and the names of his three sons that went to battle were elab the firstborn and next unto him abinadab and the third sheema and David was the youngest and the three eldest followed Saul but David went and returned from Saul to feed his father's sheep at Bethlehem and may the Lord add His blessings you may be seated and so tonight I want you to notice that uh Saul uh Saul was a was a big man too we find find out that Saul was maybe 7 foot tall he was a big man but then Goliath comes in the camp or or is on the other side of the hill and we'll say there's a valley between them and so you've got the armies of the Lord on one side and you've got Goliath and this Army on the other side and you've got the go you got Goliath that is defying the armies of the Living God this is the armies these are the people these are the people that have been through some things they've seen all kinds of stuff happen they they they they know that God is on their side but they're scared because this giant excuse me so big and this giant is so so large and and and maybe he don't even know if they can take him and and and Saul is scared to death of him Saul doesn't know what to do he's a big man he's got the armor he's got he's got everything that the world would say you would have to have to to defeat this Goliath but but what he didn't have was courage and what he didn't have was what he didn't have was a calling on his life and and it wasn't his time to shine you might say and so Saul didn't know you know Saul didn't know what to do Saul just thought maybe maybe this would be a a time where we just have to just lay down and let him win maybe this is just too much maybe this Giant's just too big for us brother trip you know what it's like to be big and and so maybe it's just too maybe this Giant's too big to hit and uh but I say he's too big to miss tonight you know so what we need to do is quit looking at these giants like something we can't overcome and realize that every giant that is put in your way God has already went before you in battle and is already has already won the victory for you but he's there to test you but you see David had been tested before and David had already had to overcome a bear and a lion and and the same God that brought him through those Temptations and the same God that brought him through those battles would be the same God that would cause him to stand there in the face of a Goliath and and thank you buddy and Peter's new to this so he just forgot it's okay I do it on about every service anyway so what but what we find out is that that that that David was not scared because he had already witnessed the power of God before can somebody can young person say Amen to that so David was not scared David did not have fear because he had already seen what God could do now in this day I would say our young people have got it greater than any other generation in one sense that you have seen more in your day and know that God is real better today than they've known for thousands of years since he walked here in flesh himself you would not know that God is as real as he is right now because we've seen him we've seen him Vindicated we've seen God do things through a prophet of God and we we've seen these things there's no reason to be scared because if God through David could take out the bear and if God through David could take out the lion then God could come through a ruddy little boy named David and stand in the face of that Goliath and and defeat Goliath why because there was no fear in him so so what do we have today what do we fight today I would say it like this we we fight different things we fight depression and we fight fear and we fight complex and and we fight bitterness in our spirits and and many times there's peer pressure young people fight peer pressure you want to look like somebody else or you go to school and you want to fit in with the cool kids but that's just a Goliath in your way don't give in to that Goliath you were born for such a time as this to defeat that devil that's trying to take you out remember that the Goliath would like for you to surrender to him but we are not going to surrender to nor Goliath tonight but we are going to overcome why because we've seen what God has done and the god that has done something once will do it again can you say amen I believe that God is more than able in this day brother bandham talks about it like this and he says he says could you imagine a great Army on one side of the hill and a great Army on the other side of the hill and he said the armies on the opposite sides were Philistines versus Israel was so many more and they had the Challenger over there by the name of Goliath and he was many times bigger than any other man and he was making this Challenge and all of Israel with their training was scared of him and God chose a little Ruddy warty looking guy by the name of David with a little sheep skin coat on him and a slingshot packing in his hand to slay that giant and take over God uses simple things that seems ridiculous in the side of the world and he does that to show his great power can you say Amen so God didn't use Saul because he was big and mighty and had the he had all the armor on and he didn't use the whole Army no he used one man and I can say this afternoon if if we can get one young person on fire for God then I believe God can come down and start a Revival in our church if if we could just see one old person get on fire for God then I say we can see Revival in the pews again and if we can just get one person on fire for God there's not one giant that can stand in your way can you say Amen but David this is what brother Ben was trying to quote this morning and I wouldn't tell him because I didn't want him stealing my whole sermon but David had to fight Goliath before he could become a king but before he could ever fight Goliath he had to go through some trials he had to face a bear and he had to face a lion because in those instances he knew that God would then deliver him out of the hands of this Philistine that would try to defy the armies of the Living God see if he had done it before he could look back and say God's already been here before God's already done it once and if he did it one time he can do it again can you say Amen so I would say it like this and but but he had to be a shepherd He had to be a a simple man brother Brandon would preach a message called God hiding himself in Simplicity and I believe God is hiding himself in Simplicity again today we may not have the bigest churches and we may not have the fanciest uh fanciest dressed people in the church and maybe we don't have the greatest maybe the greatest things going on the greatest programs for our youth but I will say this that God is hidden in this little group of people here today God is hiding behind your skin here today God is veiling himself from the wise and prudent and he's revealing himself through for you young people here this afternoon sir but I want to just deal with a few things you're going to fight I want to deal with just a few things that you young people are going to deal with are you with me all right let me hear a big amen out of my young people amen all right well that was all right I heard Stuart my young person this afternoon all right so but here's something and brother brand deals with this and it might feel like we're getting off subject just for a minute but I want to deal with something here because here's something I see in the youth that I think we need to we need to pray about and we need to make sure that we don't let this get us down but depression and fear depression and fear depression gets on our young men depression gets on our young sisters and the next thing you know that the devil moves into that with that depression and he causes you to think things that are just unspeakable things and he makes you want to just give up and and you know whatever it is but we don't want to ever give in to the Goliath can you say Amen so brother brandom is is speaking on this tape and and turning the thoughts and he says depression fear I know what this uh the sister speaks to brother Brandon poor little thing she said she's never seen peace in her life he said sleep and and brother BR tries he says it's the same thing that I and he starts to deal with brother Brandon would deal with depression and stuff as well he said she can't sleep she's nervous there's tension and brother brandham prays like this he said dear God bear me record I've told the truth he's he's already preached the message he said how I feel for this little woman he said I pray God that you'll send to her tonight that streak of Faith from above that knows that you are obligated to your word now God is obligated to keep his word so if you read something in the Bible or you hear something in the message God is obligated to back that up in his word so you young people if you want to put your faith in anything put your faith in the word of God that you have been given in this hour there's nothing else that can that can take away or take the place of this word nothing else is going to save you nothing else is going to heal you but if you'll go back to the promise of healing and the promise of Salvation in the word then in those promises you can have faith for your salvation and for your healing and and to defeat every demon of depression and fear and so brother R goes on down he says now look sister you believe me now if you can start from right here by the cross from this night deny you got it go on saying I haven't got it no more and it will leave you so if that Goliath is standing in your way and it says well you're just depressed and you're not worth it you're not you're not going to make it you're scared to death let me tell you you talk back to that devil and say you're nothing but a bluff and you are nothing but a Goliath and I I tell you in the name of the Lord you have no rights on my property you will not defy this body of the Living Lord Jesus Christ on the Earth today that devil has no right over you so we'll deal with fear for a second he says today people are something on the order like that does on on the days when the disciples Was Out on the Ocean and one night a storm came up and there wasn't nothing all hopes was gone that they that they would ever be saved and and and he seen him come walk him come walking on the water now their ship was water logged and the the sails was broke and the oares was gone and they were holding one another and screaming they were scared to death they had fear and he said they looked out there and they seen him come walking on the water and was scared of him their only hope and they were afraid of the only thing that could save them if that ain't a true picture of today he said they thought it looked spooky they thought it was a ghost now he said they cried out for fear it's a spirit it looked too like it looked too spiritual he said that's the same thing it is today but if you just do like they did when they cried out they heard that voice coming fear not it is I Be not Afraid brother R says be of good courage so when that devil of fear when that Goliath named fear tries to stand in your way you can stand there and you can talk to that devil called Goliath and we can call him fear right now and you can say fear has no hold on me I'm no longer a slave to it because the devil has no right on this property of God's can you say Amen you young people don't need to worry about fear you don't need to have fear am I going to make it is the rapture coming yes the rapture's coming the word is true and don't worry about being left behind Just Surrender Your Life to Jesus Christ and just get the baptism of the Holy Ghost if you haven't been baptized I say get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ St a take a step of faith and let that devil of fear leave you in the name of Jesus can you say Amen so young people if you deal with fear let it go can you say amen Amen Let it go Let The Fear go let the depression go because those are just goliaths that come they look too big they look too hard but is anything too hard for God I say nothing is impossible to them that believe let's go down to complexes here for just a minute brother brandom said I love this quote it really struck me when I read it men just educate themselves till they educate themselves away from one another all fellowship's important they get complexes you don't get no complex by the blood of Jesus Christ you get love can you say Amen sir he said that's that you get love not a complex that I'm a little bigger than somebody else a little better than somebody else and know a little more than somebody else that's a complex that gets on you and sometimes you get a complex well I don't fit in to the youth group or I don't fit in because they they they have nicer clothes than me or I I don't fit in because maybe I'm just too old or I'm too young but let me go and tell you something it don't matter about what the world thinks of you you fit into God's economy why you're a Son of God you're a daughter of God you don't have to worry about what nobody else says don't worry about what that Goliath says he's going to boast and he's going to tell you you're not big enough buddy but he's not big enough to take you out because God that is in you is greater than any giant that you'll ever face brother trip the the god that is in you the God you know the god you serve is greater than any Goliath that can come and try to take you out why because God did not give you that spirit of fear but he gave you a spirit of overcoming he gave you a spirit of winning the battle he already went before you in battle I say it's time to lay down fear it's time to lay down anxiety it's time to lay down complexes that are keeping people from the house of God can you say Amen what I found is complexes will end up ruining you and your walk with God about the time you get an experience with God and then the Devil comes by and he's got to try to get you out of fellowship with God so he gives you a complex can you say Amen but I like what he said the blood of Jesus Christ you get love you get love not a complex can you say Amen every one of us in this building we come from different backgrounds we look different some of you are saying thank the Lord for that we're not related and some of you are saying thank the Lord for that but believe it or not we are all one family united under the blood of Jesus Christ and and whether you like me or not you're going to have to spend eternity with me if you're also under the same blood well can you say amen I I I'm not going to hold you too long tonight if you'll just back me real fast all right but complexes what are complexes it's it's it's all the devil yeah it's all the devil so we find out that David David had every right to have a complex can you say Amen come on David is a ruddy little ugly Shepherd boy let me go over here to the boys and talk to them and tell them how ugly they really are we'll say David looks like uh who wants to be David come here buddy I saw your hand first come here come here all right look at this trip you're obviously Goliath come on are you scared of him no why why are you not scared of him well that's not the answer I was looking for but hey that's okay but just imagine this man coming up to you and he's got a spear and a big yeah great big spear scary isn't it and you don't have nothing but a slingshot do you have a slingshot at home you do I figured you would so you got a slingshot and this is Goliath but man he's got armor he's got I mean he's got brass he's got he's got fingers this long and he's just a huge guy just big isn't he it's big intimidating you're nothing but a Shepherd boy that lived on a farm with your family don't get a complex buddy you're nothing but a Shepherd boy that lived on this farm and and you come down on the hill one day and you're just bringing food to your brothers because they're trained and they're not bigger than you really but they were smarter but your brothers are down there fighting in the Army and you're chosen to come down in this Army and and and and you hear this Goliath over here and he is saying what kind of low down people you are because you're a Shepherd you're a nobody and he thinks he's big stuff he thinks he's all that he don't know you're about to cut his head off so this man is over there making his boast and he's calling you all kinds of bad names and yeah and you're just oh you're scared maybe but what you realize is you realize that one time you encountered a bear and you encountered a lion and by the grace of God you killed both of them and you were still here to tell about it so when this Goliath over here is boasting and all the armies of the Living God who who have seen Miracles before are scared to death they're scared to death because they just don't know how to take on this Goliath but there's a young man over here that has already seen the work of God he has seen the supernatural of God I hope somebody's following me here today he knows who he is because God has already chosen him him for such a time as this and so he's standing here and he's like well I want to go fight that Goliath I want to go fight that Goliath so he goes down and he gets five smooth Stones do you know why he got five tell me just because okay F AI t h what does that spell faith and maybe because Goliath had four brothers he's going to take them all out you imagine four of these guys I bet the other ones were smaller Goliath was probably the Bigg he was the champion of this other Army and you just imagine that the Lord tells you don't fear go ahead and just just take that slingshot get five smooth Stones now the first one was going to kill him but why did he get five because he was in obedience to the word of God I would like to say this if he'd just picked up one and said I'm a good enough shot no he couldn't boast in himself he was boasting in what God had already done for him he wasn't saying I'm big enough no he wasn't big enough to take on this guy but God in him was so great that it didn't matter no weapon that he has formed against him was going to prosper he had the weapons he had the training but this man had God on his side can somebody say Amen you young people don't have to be scared Goliath was the one that needed to be scared he might have looked big and he might have been trained but God is bigger than any Goliath you will'll ever face so when you come up to when when this when this big scary monster comes up and and the next thing you know he he looks like he's armed and the devil's coming against you we we can name we're going to name him now we got we got fear and we've got anxiety and all these things are huge big strong heavy all these things are coming against you do you run away scared no you take the word of God fi t h there we go got the five fingers up that time you take your faith in God's word and you can defeat every complex everything that would ever come against you you don't know much about it now but when you get older the devil's going to try to fight you he's going to try to fight you in your mind he's going to try to fight you in a lot of ways but don't you ever worry and have fear because the same faith that you have as a young man right now that accepted the Lord Jesus Christ is the same Faith that's going to defeat every devil that comes against you can you say Amen you can go ahead and sit down for a minute I might use you again but we'll see where we're at every devil that is coming against you is too big is too big for you to fight but the power of God in you I hope you're hearing me now the power of God in you is bigger than any demon that would try to come against you so you can name your devil you can pet your devil you can tell him you're just fear I've got anxiety why are you claiming that nonsense oh come on somebody when I tell you what when the devil puts that on you don't you dare claim it brother brand just told a story about a lady he said go confessing that that fear is gone go confessing that anxiety is gone go go confessing that depression is gone don't sign for that box of rattlesnakes but send it back to the devil and say you know what God has already given me the spirit of David he was a mighty warrior and God has Ro Raised Me Up for such a time as this God has given me the spirit of overcoming in a time when it looks like young people are going to fall but I'm not just a sta a statistic I am an overcomer I'm a David I'm a warrior I'm going to fight this battle and we're going to win can you say Amen you young people don't have to be scared just because the devil tells you you can't make it in this hour because because things are just too hard for you that's the devil talking to you just because the devil says you've got fear don't you listen to that devil that says you got fear say I believe God and His word I am not going to be fearful here's one here that we don't deal with very often but bitterness bitterness anybody here ever had bitterness don't raise your hand I'll use you bitterness brother BR talks about it like this and just a little story about bitterness it's a very short quote he said each one of you just confess all your wrong confess all your unbelief and say Lord Jesus maybe I belonged to church once I went to church but I was never satisfied there was something another oh my I might have shouted I might have spoke with tongues I might have joined Church all those things are fine I have nothing against that but that's not what I'm talking about I'm talking about the love of God that's really down here it's really down there that's the Holy Spirit that's it and you want that how many want that tonight you say well I've already got the Holy Ghost every one of you need a refilling because you're not going to get on on one experience You' got to have refilling after refilling after refilling and if you've really got it you're going to desire refilling after refilling after refilling you're not you're not going to be satisfied with yesterday's Revival you're going to want to live in the present you're going to want Revival after when you start to feel your soul get a little dry when you start coming to church and you're not feeling like you in love with God like you used to be it's time to find yourself either at the altar or praying there at your seat or getting back into the word again you young people I'm telling you I think we've let ourselves go too far sometimes we have a good camp meeting experience but I say let's not let that Revival fire die at camp meeting let's not let that Revival fire die because we're because we're sitting at our home church again no let you say well well we don't have the service is exciting let me go and tell you something go ahead and be excited there ain't nobody here going to stop you and if they do we'll cast that devil out we'll cast that devil out that's trying to hold you back if you feel to Shou in church Shou in church if you feel to raise up and say Amen real loud I say go right ahead it ain't going to hurt me or brother Ben or brother Stewart we'll say go right ahead why because we want you to have freedom in the house of God to believe God on his word and to go ahead and pull on the gift of God you don't have to be 20 years old or 30 years old you could be a 10y old and when Jesus touches your heart to say Amen just go ahead and say a great big amen you don't even have to wait I know sometimes there's things preached when you're young you don't understand I know that it happen I still don't understand everything so there's things all the time I'm like huh that's why I'm get in a bald spot I'm scratching my head all the time you young people though you know you know that there's things you may not understand but some of you that are real young your parents are trying to teach you to love Jesus your parents are trying to teach you when you get to a certain age and you know there's baptism is a requirement baptism is not optional just saying baptism is a requirement now when you're baptized that's when the Lord works on you and tells you to be baptized I say run right while you can go tell somebody I want to get baptized don't wait don't put that off let that desire in your heart let it be fulfilled let's let's follow the word when you want to follow the word that's the time to follow the word that's the time to get an action while the while the fire is lit go ahead and and do that don't don't wait don't put it off and don't let somebody talk you out of it can you say Amen but I would say it like this nobody could talk David out of going down there because he'd already seen too to much he had already been in the presence of the Lord a couple times and so he knew that this next time was going to be no different so when David walks down there he didn't let his complex of being little hold him back he didn't let his complexes of of who he was from his family was all out there in the Army but he was left at home tending the Sheep he was a sheep herder you could say he was a nobody he didn't belong down there with the armies that were trying to fight for the Living God they he didn't belong with the armies a good armies he didn't belong with them why because he was just a ruddy little boy he did he had no training but he had training that they didn't know about well can you say amen he had training that maybe the world wouldn't say was training but he had training from God himself because he had been with God he had been in the presence of God and so he knew how to defeat the Devils when they come fighting him so I would say young people when the devils are coming after you don't you let the devil overtake you in that situation remember the devil is not too big to defeat that's right I know sometimes we get to thinking that the devils are just too big and we well bitterness is just there bitterness is for my family and and many times I will say that many times us parents need to watch out because what we do our bitter spirits come right down on our children and our our our fear comes right down on our our children and our complexes come right down on our kids and and all this depression it's passed down from generation to generation but somebody's got toak break the cycle somebody's got to stop that cycle from just going around and the next thing you know my kids have got it your kids have got it my grandkids my great grandkids no I say now is the time to stop the cycle of death and get back into the atmosphere of God where you know you can defeat the giants that are coming after you yes sir so all these things are just the devil now I know it's simple if you wanted to hear something deep you should have been here for this morning you're not going to hear tonight but some of you young people I think I I think that's one of the things that get you the worst you you you don't feel adequate enough you don't feel great enough you don't feel big enough maybe I don't you don't feel big enough to be part of the service let me go and tell you something you are the Church of today not just the Church of Tomorrow you are the big listen you're a big part of the church you you create an atmosphere when you sit here and you you you start to just stand there and you you soak up the word that's being preached listen that does my heart good I know it does these other brothers when they can see young people that are getting into the services and and are starting to receive from the Lord because if there's a deacon for tomorrow then somebody's got to be a deacon if there's other preachers raised up somebody's got to be preachers and you young ladies listen don't feel left out you young ladies somebody's got to be a preacher's wife and somebody's got to be a Deacon's wife and somebody just got to be a mother to children that could be taught about the message of the hour and and listen your your responsibilities in many ways are much bigger than the boy's responsibilities because you grow up and and if the if your husband if you ever get married I'm I'm not saying you ever will and hopefully you don't but if you ever get married you want to don't look at me like that make sure your dad approves well she rolled her eyes at me hadn't had that happen since I looked at trip but you know what think about it if you grow up when you grow up you will grow up not if when when you grow up you may you may marry a preacher God forbid your daddy's a preacher you know don't you it's pretty real yeah it's pretty rough I know yeah you know yeah you're not GNA marry preacher buddy we don't believe in we don't we don't we don't believe in women preachers you're okay you're all right but hey I mean but serious and I'm I'm I'm trying to keep this light for the kids is that okay is that okay I'm just trying to talk to them today because listen I think sometimes we got to get down here and and be able to communicate with them to where they understand that God is not a god that is a far off but God can live in a heart just like this one right here God can live in a heart God can live in a this little boy right here may be the youngest right here the smallest but look look at that there's a great big God on the inside of that young man and inside of that man is a big enough God to defeat any devil that ever comes on his way I I don't care what the devil's done to you I don't care what your family has done don't you say he well don't don't I'm not going to say don't listen to your parents but I'm going to tell you if your parents start telling you well grandpa had this kind of this fear and Grandpa was anxious and Grandpa was this I'm going to just tell you right now you do not have to sign for that because you do not have to have those things from your grandparents pass down to you I say it's time us parents start saying we are not going to let depression come through me down to my children we are not going to let complexes stop me from receiving what I need from God and we're sure not going to let it stop me and make my children have to suffer the same way I'm suffering listen you I I don't say that there these are not real Devils these are real Devils Goliath was a real being Goliath was a real enemy Goliath was something real and he was big I'm not I'm not denying that what I'm saying is the god in David was bigger than that scare tactic that the devil tried to throw at the armies of the Living God that was just a fear tactic that was just something to scare the armies of God but see God was greater God was G and bigger God already knew they would send Goliath out but he already had a Shepherd boy being prepared listen you may not look like much you may not have an office in the church and you may just feel like a nobody but let me go ahead and tell you something if God has ordained for you to be something God will use you in the way that he wants to use you you young sisters don't you ever feel like God's not going to use you he's got great things planned for your life you young Brothers God's got great things planned for your life he don't want you to be scarred by the things of the world he wants you to have a testimony that I did not go out I did not fall away but I stayed right here with the message of the hour and I believe in everything that God said you're not in this message you're not in this message because your parents are here God put your parents in the message so that you could be here you're not just here by chance God knew God knew that your God knew your mom trip needed to be in church that's why you're here today you say well well it's because my parents know God had to put them in a place so that you could be in your place well can you say amen God had to put you by Bill in your place so that so that your kids could be in their place and don't look at the circumstances of how big the devil is that is trying to hold that over your kids because God is greater than every devil that is trying to hold your kids back you young people well come on somebody you are not just going to make it just barely you are Overcomers you are people that are going to overcome these Devils somebody's going to overcome Temptation somebody's going to overcome these things why because the spirit that was in Christ and raised him from the dead it will Quicken your body is it important to accept Jesus Christ I say it is because if you accept his Spirit then you can defeat those same Devils he was tempted in all like manner he even spoke to the Devil Himself and when he was sitting up there he used the same he used something that the weakest Christian brother random said could use on the devil it was an example made for the weakest as Christian how many knows what that was that he could defeat the Devil by the word of God he didn't have to jump through hoops he didn't have to listen I believe in jumping and screaming and hollering and I wish somebody would do it sometimes and maybe it'll be me I don't know don't don't condemn me if I do if I do I promise it's the Lord my watch is telling me my time's up it can't be we'll just turn that off I'm on almost done but listen listen let's just let's just bring this down for a minute the devil is going to try to tempt you let's talk to these older young people some of you sitting three rows back sometimes the devil's going to deal with these young men in ways I'm GNA say this to some of you Elders there's there's things that you did not experience that these young men have experienced or will experience that's just the truth of it we're living in an age of Technology where there's phones there's computers there's there's things that some people just didn't even know existed until 20 years ago or 30 years ago I didn't I'm only 31 years old and did you know that I didn't have a cell phone until I left home at 17 18 however old I was and and it was a flip phone but it had a cty board no it didn't have a c board I had I got one of those that slid open and had a cord board on it I thought it was high-tech and guess what we had at home for a computer we had dial up internet when I met my wife online I mean when I started talking to her online didn't meet her online I met her at to wedding she caught the bouquet at my brother and sister-in-law's wedding yeah it was awesome I was like that's the one that's it but but you know what happened was we had dial up so I would send a message on Facebook Messenger this is a long time ago you know I mean I'm we're going to be married 13 years in two days so it's a long time ago but but I would send a message and it would take 15 minutes to be delivered because you'd sit there and you'd see this bar go like this and I'd sit there and watch it you talk about Insanity all for a girl you know I mean just wanted to talk then I found out I could talk to her on the phone that made a little easier but where I lived I had to put my cell phone on top of my dresser in a certain position where it get one bar and it wasn't actually mine it was dad's and so you know he he wanted at a certain time so I could only so anyway bless your heart I got problems but listen church I never thought my kid would tell me in church I got problems but you know what you'll do a lot of things and you're going to do but even now now it's nothing like that now everything's instant everything's instant you've got instant messaging you've got WhatsApp and Facebook and Instagram and Snapchat and youve got all these all these things and I'm listen I'm not saying any of those things are bad but if they're used wrong and remember the devil is in is in this end time the devil wants us to be so smart that and he can use these tools to get into our minds he can use these tools to hurt our young people I'm just going to take five minutes is that okay but that's the devil trying to use something maybe good to harm you you young people have not experienced these young little young ones up here haven't experienced that and I know I've got a 12-year-old and they you know we've talked about a phone and all that but God forbid you know I mean what are they going to get into and the problem is the devil listen it's not always bad kids either you say these are angels I agree these are some of the best kids ever but what I'm just telling you is that that the devil is there trying to get our kids attention you think everything on the internet's good then some of you Elders need to take a look don't really but you but our young people man that's the devil that's a Goliath in our end time that nobody else has ever had to face but it is a real devil but it's not something you have to bow down to it's not something you have to even fear why because we we just put that devil down we cut its head off and we say that devil is not going to defy this body that devil is not going to overtake this young person that devil is not going to make me do things oh come on somebody the devil is not going to win this battle it's just the devil the devil is in a lot of things things but I want you to know that God is in you and if you'll just let God be in you then listen I you know your parents when they tell you no that's God in them a lot of times telling you no that'll make you think before you say I don't agree with my parents that might be God speaking to you because many times God has given the a spirit of wisdom to your parents and and sometimes your parents are just speaking from Pure experience I know I don't want you to do that because I've been there right sometimes that's just a parent speaking sometimes the parents just got to be just tell a kid no there ain't no explanation because you don't need to know and when you get old enough to find out then that's between you and the Lord but right now it's a no you know so anyway that's okay I thought I'd get some amens out of that but nobody wants to be told no do they nobody want brother brother Logan you ever tell your kids no all the time sometimes it feels like that's all you know wonder why my kid learn no before before any other word that's his first word was no it's because that's what we're telling him all the time is no no stop no no no should have named him Noah no no trip you're told no no even now I bet you get told no guarantee it yeah you ever get told no yeah I know you do I just got told on phone quit telling people no all right listen what you're going to find out is the devil is there to say well you won't surely die it'll be okay just this one time but listen I just want to tell you this this is from my heart just for a second what you're going to find out is when the devil gets you to do something then you have condemnation in your heart you feel bad about it because you're really a good kid and maybe you're even saved maybe you even got the holy ghost but you've messed up because the devil has has has tempted you into something listen that does not mean you're lost don't you ever let somebody tell you you're lost if you if you've been baptized you hold on to that promise of the Holy Ghost I don't care what Temptation the devil pulls towards you or throws at you listen you don't have to be lost young people God has not given us the spirit of fear but he's given us the spirit of an overcoming he's given us the spirit to defeat the Devil he's given us he's given us the ability through him that he's already won the battle he's already won the war all you've got to do is stay in his presence and stay under the blood of Jesus Christ don't let you don't let no devil come and tell you that you're not good enough to make it in this Rapture I say every one of you young people when the Lord comes back you're going to be there you're not going to be left behind you're not going to be I don't care what the devil says I don't care what anybody tries to tell you if some preacher stands up there and says you might be lost I say you tell that preacher I've already went with Jesus and I've been baptized and I'm holding on to a promise I am not going to be lost hold on to that testimony young people I'm not going to be lost I I've got a desire in my heart God has placed you in in this time in this church in that seat for such a time as this when it looked like you shouldn't have been here you're here anyway when it looked like David should have never fought Goliath he went down anyway why because it was God's man and God's provided time and God's provided Place God's provided way and the next thing you know that devil could not withstand what David had oh come on some somebody ought to just go with me here for a second David had something bigger than the devil he had faith in God David had something bigger when he was back there on the back side of the desert or out there with the Sheep he learned something that those men down in the Army never learned he learned that God could overcome the spirit of a bear and God could overcome the spirit of a lion and God could God could take him as a as a nobody and make him a king but before he could ever become a king he had to face Goliath and before you can ever reach your full potential as a Christian then remember you may have to fight Goliath and every son that comes to God must first be tested and tried you're going to face Goliath you're going to face the bear you're going to face the lion but you're not going to be defeated because you are one of God's chosen people people for the hour don't you worry about nothing don't you worry why it don't matter listen there there's peer pressure peer pressure there's all these things I I I say it like this we need to speak to the giant we need to speak to the giant that's in your way and say giant I'm GNA cut your head off why because that giant has no right to defy the armies of the Living God he has no right to defy the young people in the message of the hour he has no red over us and we are more than able to take the land we are more than able to take Goliath we are more than able to be set on the throne as Sons and Daughters of God and Kings and Priests listen we're more than enough for what the devil's got we have the answer to the devil's question in this hour We're Overcomers can you say Amen how many in here's ready to say I'm not going to bow down to depression I'm not going to bow down to anxiety I'm not going to bow down to the devil that would give me bitterness in my heart I'm not going to bow down to the devil called fear I am not going to bow down to Goliath but I'm going to take my slingshot and I'm going to take the word of God and the faith in my heart to use it and I will defeat that Goliath every single time can you say Amen don't you worry don't you fear the God I know is more than able the God I serve is big enough to defeat Goliath the God I serve is big enough he's greater than any problem he's greater than any Goliath he's greater than any problem he's greater than any complex he's greater than any fear he's greater than the bitterness in your family tree he's greater can somebody say Amen he's greater than depression he's greater than fear my God Is Bigger Better and greater than any of these things that's my God peer pressure tries to take our young people out but my God Is Bigger peer pressure tries to tell your young sisters to cut the hair and wear pants but my God is greater you just tell them that I serve a God and I have given him my life and listen I'm not you don't have to go out and start telling people how bad they are no you just tell that devil that speaks to you listen this is what God's done for me and I'm a daughter of God I don't have to look like the world I don't have to act like the world I don't have to live like the world I am an overcomer in an age where everybody looks crazy everybody looks like they're just falling apart or insane but let me go and tell you something God has got some young sisters that are raised up to look like Godly young people in this hour he's got some young men that are not going to be a bunch of Ricky but they're going to stand up and say I'm going to stand for this message I'm going to stand for the word of the hour I'm not going to let no devil take me out and make me look like some pervert out here on the street but God has given you the ability to overcome every devil that would try to take you out can you say amen amen I want to just give you one more before we close I'm sorry I've went over but you knew I was going to do it and you still showed up brother R says it like this and this will be my last quote and I will close David know the anointing oil was on him didn't make any difference to him he said that Philistine will be like the bear and the lion so here I come sir he said he he predicted it before it happened what did he do he killed the bear he killed the lion he knocked the lion down and and then he he took slingshot and he took a knife and and the bear in The Lion he killed the lion with a knife and that same thing he done to Goliath he knocked him down with a rock and pulled up his sword and cut his head off right there before what did he predict before it happens and he said you will be as they are go David didn't go out there and say I might die I'm going to take out a great big life insurance policy because this may be my last fight no he went down there and said this Goliath this demon is gonna be just like them other demons and it cannot stand in the face of an almighty God that demon cannot take me out oh come on somebody brother Brandon said it like this he said he said he spoke the word that it would be and then went forward to make it fulfilled he said oh brother he spake and took over the situation that day if there ever was a time that man should speak it's now I would say young people if there's ever a time that you could speak to that devil and tell him get out of here you have no rights on my property you have no right to stay here you have no right to settle in my mind and make me depressed I don't want to see a bunch of depressed young people I want to see some young people that are on fire for God I want to see some young people who are in the house of God and say Lord I want what you have for me I'm not worried about what the other Church said I'm not worried about what nobody says they can laugh at me they can make fun of me the workers my my co-workers can laugh at me my family can laugh at me but I'm going on with my Jesus just the same you can falsely accuse me you can just go ahead and do whatever you want to do to me but when the rooll is Called Up Yonder my name is on that roll and you will not see me down here in destruction with all those that are laughing and mocking and making fun but I will be changed in the moment in the twinkling of an eye I have the faith of David I'm a warrior like David I may not always feel like it but I'm saying with faith in my heart that every Goliath in your way tonight cannot stand before you because you are more than able you are more than enough you are you are you are somebody being used by a mighty God and he has went before you in battle can you say amen I wonder if you can stand to your feet tonight musicians come I'm sorry I held you along but that's just on my heart I don't want to see young people with fear I don't want to see young people with depression I don't want to see young people with complexes that they're not good enough for you know listen complexes are hurting too many of our kids comp complexes are are ruining young people I'm no longer Slave To Fear all kinds of things are coming against us but greater is he did you know the Bible said there would be weapons formed against you but they will not Prosper you young ladies know that there's going to be weapons there's going to be demons come against you there's going to be devils of fear anxiety depression peer pressure I'm not good enough my friends don't like me that's no reason to give up on God there no reason to give up on God God loves you and God knew you before you were ever formed in your mother's womb and he called you to be here today you know that you young men God didn't put you here for no reason he has a purpose for your life why do we want you to live Godly live holy it's not just to show off and say we have the best looking young people that's not it at all we want to tell you what the word says because God is going to raise up preachers come on somebody God's going to raise up these young men to be Davids these are going to be young men that are going to they're going to be like Samson they're going to take a they may take an old whatever they got in their hand they may take just the one word of God is all they've got all they know but they can defeat an army of demons with just an old draw bone of a mule you young people don't have to be scared God died for you he came down in the flesh so that he could die for you Jesus Christ is your savior and if you'll accept him if there's a young person that hasn't been baptized I'll say this and I know you parents would agree with me so I'll just say it if you haven't been baptized you need to make that decision if you if you feel it in your heart to be baptized don't wait I know your parents won't make you wait they want you to be baptized because then after you're baptized you've got a promise of the Holy Ghost and it's a whole lot easier to fight these Devils with the Holy Ghost because then it's not you it's something on the inside of you that raises up like David I'm not scared of that giant no more I'm not scared why because God had already taken this young man and used him and then a prophet would anoint this young man to go out to battle he looked and the father might have picked his other Sons first and said well this one's bigger this one's better this one's older he's wiser but God just wanted somebody he could use God wanted somebody who wasn't scared of the Goliath if God wanted to he could have just come down himself if God wanted to he could have used Saul but he came in a simple way because he knew there would be some simple humble people that needed to know that they too could fight Goliath can you say Amen you young people if you have a desire on your heart if you want to be prayed for I'll pray with you if you just want to kneel at the altar you can if you want to just pray right where you're at in the seat you can pray but if I leave you with anything if you have depression in your life or maybe some family member has told you well it runs in the family speak to that devil of depression not to the family member but the devil of depression and tell that tell that devil of depression you're not going to live in this house you're not going to live in this young lady you're not going to live in these young men you're not going to live in these young sisters back here why because depression has no right in your property fear complexes the root of bitterness none of this none of these things has a right in our young people can you say Amen so I wonder if you just bow your heads for a moment and if you have any of these things worried about what kids at school say worried about what somebody talks about you worried about if somebody somebody just thinks you're crazy thinks you're weird just be like a David and say it don't matter if if the world's armor doesn't fit it doesn't matter because I'm going to defeat that devil that's coming after me anyway if you just close your eyes bow your heads you young people just for a few moments just pray in your own way Heavenly Father you see these young people here today Lord I just spoke with what's on my heart I hope Lord that there would be one of these young people today that would just hear the word Lord and Lord I don't want this age of pressure and anxiety to take out any of our young people but Lord I pray Lord tonight that they would make a decision that this is that they're going to take the way with the Lord's despised few or they're going to take the way with the Lord's the the Lord's way they're going to walk in the word that they've been so they've been so attentive to tonight and Lord I pray that you would just move on these young people if there's one that hasn't been baptized I pray Lord you would just speak to their hearts Lord Jesus so that they would be baptized and Lord these young people that have been baptized I pray that you would just F them with the Holy Ghost Lord Lord may this be a night where they
