32. it's always good to be in the house of the lord and we know that the master of the wind aren't you glad for that tonight amen luke chapter 12 and verse 32. i want to title this this evening how to live in the world and it's not evident from the title what i want to say but i just kind of these things have been on my heart and i'd studied on these things before this election and then some of the things that have happened you know um you never know what world you're going to wake up in from one day to the next but aren't you glad you know who's in charge we know who the king is amen we may not know who the president is going to be but we know who the king is tonight and so we're grateful for that i want to read luke 12 32 fear not little flock for it is your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom amen aren't you glad for that promise tonight i pray the lord would add his blessing to the word you may be seated i think jesus understood what we forget sometimes that his disciples his the people who he had called out the church called out of the church would be an extreme minority in the world that they lived in an extreme minority to the point where they couldn't affect politics very much and they wouldn't be very considered you know when when they go and look at the different groups and how to pander to the different groups in politics they don't look much at christians and then what they do they look at denominational christians they don't look much at message people they don't look much it they didn't look much at jesus disciples what they thought about things or or whether or not they were happy with the way the things were going and jesus knew that he knew that they would be hated by the existing world order not because they were bad people but because they were his sheep right and so there would be this conflict between the world order and that's what i mean by how to live in the world that's the cosmos the world order the uh the way things are in the world we have to live in that and we want the best for that we want to see the best come from that and yet knowing that there's going to be a conflict because we don't belong to this world we're in this world but we're not of it we don't belong to it and and so there's a persecution that comes by the world order that continues to this day you go go back to the founding of this country it was originally founded because a little flock of separatists fled the persecution of the english church and they became known to history as the pilgrims pilgrims because they just went from one place to another seeking a city a place a country where they could be have freedom to worship god and that's not why this country exists today this country for the most part people want freedom to do what they want not freedom to worship god but that's why they will come out to begin with and and so someone said that a fugitive is one who is running from home a vagabond is one who has no home a stranger is one away from home but a pilgrim is on his way home so we're pilgrims tonight this isn't home we need to remember that jesus knew the corn of wheat had to fall on the ground and die as we talked about sunday and he knew he would have to leave his disciples in the midst of this world order would be against him and so he tells them this in john 14 19 he says yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but you see me because i live he said you shall live also so he uses that word cosmos the world the world order the orderly arrangement of things and brother branham says this about that and i won't read very many quotes tonight i've only got i think two because i've got so many scriptures so we want to try to get really dig into the scripture this evening but brother branham says a little while in the world he said there's a greek word cosmos which means the world order he said it'll sink every world order must sink every nation that's dominated by satan always has been he said and always will be he said outside of israel when they become a nation now branham always ties that back to luke chapter four and verse five where the devil says took jesus up into a high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time and the devil said unto him all this power will i give thee and the glory of them he said for that is delivered unto me notice what the devil says and brown said jesus didn't say anything to him about it he just let him talk because this was the truth at that time but jesus knew he was coming into power but now he said all this power will i give thee in the glory of them for that is delivered unto me and to whomsoever i will give it and you wonder why they have trouble counting the votes right you think about it the devil is is in the details if you say it that way right i mean he's involved in that and because he is the head of the world order and the bible even talks about how that one nation will fight against another nation but the brown said the demons over one nation will become jealous of the demons over another nation will actually fight against one another and we're actually seeing that in in our nation that there's two spirits in the nation today they're fighting with one another right but we're not part of that and yet we recognize it's there yet we participate because again there could be one world order that's better for us to live in than another but god has control over which one it will happen right because he sees better than we see now so he said all that's delivered unto me and to whomsoever i will give it so you say the devil counts the votes in luke 4 and 7 that next verse he said if thou therefore will worship me all shall be thine in other words he might say i i rule the cosmos by permission by permission it was given to me and i i i'm going to allow you to rule it but god had to allow him to rule it because as powerful as the devil is he's not powerful enough to do anything without permission from god you know that that's we need to keep that in mind sometimes because you look at the things that have went on this year and how everything seems like falls apart around us and remember no matter how powerful the devil is he's not more powerful than god and he said greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world he always wins that battle right and so god has to allow it in psalm 75 5. he said lift not up your horn on high speak not with a stiff neck don't get arrogant he said for promotion cometh neither from the east nor from the west nor from the south but god is the judge he put us down one setteth up another in the hand of the lord there is a cup and the wine is red is full of mixture he pours out the same but the drugs thereof all the wicked of the earth shall bring them out and drink them so he said what's coming to them they'll get that but sometimes god allows an evil government to come for his own purposes so we have to remember that god allows the governments that exists the world order that exists and you know we go down we don't like to pay taxes i don't know anybody that really loves to pay taxes and i don't know anybody that really loves to to uh obey some of the laws that they put on us that are kind of petty and some of them are useful some are good but some of them are kind of petty but we do it anyway we live in this world and as long as they don't contradict the word of god we have to go along with that and we'll get into that later but god could cast that government out and bring in another one but he might not cast out a good gov or an evil government bringing a good one he might do the reverse god might allow that right and because for his own purposes look at what he did you know israel was god's people and israel sinned against god and if you look at their captivity with nebuchadnezzar nebuchadnezzar was chosen by god to take israel in captivity you go look in the book of jeremiah and he talks about how he was chosen by god to do that but in daniel chapter 2 and you can read the whole thing maybe later but in daniel chapter two nebuchadnezzar is having his dream of these gentile world orders and daniel says this he said he changes speaking of god he changes the times and the seasons he removeth kings and setteth up kings he giveth wisdom unto the wise and knowledge to them that no understanding god does that nebuchadnezzar had a dream of a tree that lifted up to the heavens and it was so beautiful and an angelic being he calls a watcher comes down and cuts it says cut it down and why is that in daniel 4 17 nebuchadnezzar is telling his dream he said this matters by the decree of the watchers and the demand by the word of the holy ones to the intent that the living may know that the most high ruleth in the kingdom of men and giveth it to whomsoever he will and set us up over at the basest of men whereas god can bring someone out of out of nowhere and make him president make him king make him a ruler right god does that and nebuchadnezzar got lifted up and he warned him daniel warned him it would happen but he got lifted up and he walked out one day and looked around and said well things look pretty good i'm a great king and a voice spoke to him and said you're going to lose your mind and he lost his mind for a season lived like an animal out in the desert just so god could remind him who was in charge and we don't know that nebuchadnezzar was ever a christian at times he sympathized with daniel and put him up over the other princes and things but he he was never a godly man he still worshipped his idols and those things but god used him right and god can do that and and we can extrapolate that down to more than just governments more than just presidents but even you you've had maybe a boss at some point in your life that was a real help to you or someone that gave you a lot of trouble god allowed them to be there and you think of the story of david how that the man just happened to be the other side of the road and was throwing rocks at him and he said maybe maybe god told him to do that huh maybe the lord told him to do that and brother branham went through a similar experience and we go through that sometimes maybe god allowed us to be in the situation that we're in but remember it's he's got it in control see his election doesn't doesn't have you don't have to count no votes he already counted the votes and then when we were elected by god he already knew you before the foundation of the world he don't have any more counting to do he doesn't have to wait and and see who's going to win we know who's going to win so he said fear not little flop you look at belshazzar and darius who come in after nebuchadnezzar and belshazzar was giving the party as we know and then the the hand coming wrote on the wall and in daniel 5 18 daniel is interpreting it to him he says oh thou king the most high god gave nebuchadnezzar thy father a kingdom and majesty and glory and honor and for the majesty that he gave him all people nations and languages trembled and feared before him he says whom he would he slew and whom he would he kept alive whom he would he set up and whom he would he put down so he was a powerful king one of the most powerful kings that had ever been up to that time but god let him do that god let him do that but when his heart was lifted up and his mind hardened in pride he was deposed from his kingly throne and they took his glory from him it was driven from the sons of men his heart was made like the beast as well and was with the wild asses they fed him with the grass like ox and his body was wet with the dew of heaven he knew that the most high god ruled in the kingdom of men and that he appointed over it whosoever he will so nebuchadnezzar said i can set up whoever i want to he wasn't just a king the title for those kings was the king of kings so they called themselves the king of kings because they weren't just a king they were the king over an empire but here he said god appoints over at whomsoever he will and thou his son obelisar has not humbled thine heart though thou knowest all this but it's lifted up thyself against the lord of heaven they brought the vessels of his house before thee thou and thy lords and concubines have drunk wine in them and he talks about it and he says whose are all thy ways has not glorified in verse 24 he said then was the part of the hand sent from him and this writing was written and this is the writing that was written me nae mine tikel of farsin and this is the interpretation of the thing mene god numbered thy kingdom and finished it god counted some votes he says your weight in the balance is verse 27 aren't found wanting my kingdom is divided and given to the medes and persians and then belshazzar evidently decided he was going to prevent this from happening by making daniel rich and powerful and he did he made him the third ruler in the kingdom in verse 29 but in verse 30 and that night was are the king of the chaldean slain that night and darius the median took the kingdom being about three score and two years old if you go back and look at that's when the medes and persians come in when cyrus come in and darius come in and they come in you know the walls of babylon were so high that nobody could even overcome them and history says that the babylonians laughed and continued their party when cyrus come to the gates and what he did is he just went through the water duct and come into the city who gave him the wisdom to do that god did right he stole the election we could say it that way right and i want us to take note because these things have happened before right we don't know what's going to happen tomorrow who's going to be president even and all those things you don't know what's going to happen but god knows hey man aren't you glad that he knows you don't know tomorrow you might you might be struck with some disease you might have some problem you might have an accident of some kind god forbid that that would happen but but you might you don't know what what tomorrow holds but you know who holds tomorrow and i know that all things work together for the good and then to love god who are called according to his purpose do we really believe that tonight amen so darius become king and cyrus was a king in isaiah 45 and 1. i love this is 150 years before cyrus took babylon and he says this he said thus saith the lord to his anointed desires whose right hand i have holden in other words i gave him his power to subdue nations before him i will loose the loins of kings to open up up before him the two leave the gates and the gates shall not be shut where the gates of babylon were closed to him but he just went in a different way god gave him the ability to do that he said i will go before thee make the crooked places straight i will break in pieces the gates of brass cuttings under the bars of iron i will give you the treasures of darkness hidden riches of secret places that thou mayest know that i the lord which called thee by thy name and the god of israel listen for whose sake for jacob my servants say and israel might elect amen i have even called thee by name i have surnamed thee though though has not known me so 150 years before he ever took the city he said i know who you are and it's going to be my power that allows you to do that he said i am the lord there's none else there's no god beside me i girded thee though that has not known me that they may know from the rising of the sun and from the west that there is none beside me i am the lord and there's none else do we believe that tonight he said i form the light and create darkness i make peace and create evil that word is calamity it's not that god creates sin but but he allows calamity to come i the lord do all these things amen you say well that's the old testament but look and there's a new testament example of god intervening in a king's life in acts chapter 12 verse 21 herod the king you know it's strange that herod was allowed to do what he did to jesus and god didn't do anything the kings were allowed to do all the things pilate was allowed to do what he did nothing happened to him right away but now here a little while later he comes up and sits on his throne and begins to speak and then people gave a shout saying it's the voice of god not of a man which is a dangerous thing it's idolatry in verse 23 and immediately the angel the lord smote him because he gave not god the glory and he was eaten of worms and gave up the ghost but i love this next verse but the word of god grew and multiplied here's a king that was there god he served his purpose and he became arrogant and god brought him down right he was there he served his purpose become arrogant god brought him down but the word grew and multiplied and somehow while we're still here with isaac there has to be a people who can take advantage of that and say i'm not here i'm not subject in the sense of this political system doesn't own me but i'm going to use this as an opportunity as brother branham prayed if god gives us a few more years then let's take that to win souls for christ and if he doesn't then it's the end right now the devil so the devil is under permission but god does this he will he's not he doesn't have to seek permission from anybody not even us and we know that this nation this world order that we're in today this american world order will come down just like herod come down like nebuchadnezzar come down like belchers are come down darius come down all these others come down because this is the final of those gentile if you think about it the iron in the clay that's the the finality of the gentile world order is smitten by the stone that was made without hands daniel 2 42 let's just go there he said as the toes of the feet were part of iron part of clay so the kingdom should be partly strong and partly broken and whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men but they shall not cleave one to another even as iron is not mixed with clay and you remember random talked about khrushchev and eisenhower eisenhower means iron khrushchev means clay they won't cleave to one another but listen they're they're a world power together capitalism and communism together right is a world power a world order today and in the days of those kings it says in the days of these kings so the god of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed and the kingdom shall not be left to other people but it shall break in pieces now think about that brother brown sees the fulfillment of that and the iron and the clay and the toast and the and daniel says the kingdom won't be left to other people so we're living in the last gentile world order this is it right the kingdom won't be left to other people but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms and it shall stand forever for as much as i saw us that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands that break in pieces the iron the brass the clay the silver and the gold the great god hath made known to the king what shall come to pass thereafter and the dream is certain and the interpretation thereof sure amen it's got to happen and we could approach that many different ways the beasts and all these things the image to be all of these things we could approach that but we'll leave that alone for tonight now so the communist capitalist system these two systems come together the church and the state whatever you want to call it comes together and it never cleaves to one another but it will be destroyed together right and brother madam even talks about one destroying the other now paul teaches us what our attitudes towards these gentile powers will be because these are the powers that rule today what should our attitude be towards the powers that be i'm going to get into brother jt's favorite scripture romans chapter 13. years ago i was doing a series on romans and barack obama had just been elected as president i believe and uh brother jt wasn't too happy about that if i remember correctly and and i preached on this and this this romans chapter 13 and he would always remembered that and i don't know why but he said let every soul be subject under the higher powers now so again how do we live in this world well he tells us how to live in this world what should our reaction be specifically to a change of powers or to a continuation of powers to whoever the powers are so he says there there is no power but of god the powers that be that's the powers that exist now are ordained of god right that is literally powers is the word means literally the existing order of things so paul legitimizes the authority and civil matters of that existing government that existing government was pagan rome now there's times you can't obey the current powers i just want to get into this because i think it's important there's some things you just can't do right if they tell us we have to bring two men here and allow them to marry here in the church we can't do that right we can't do that there's things that we can't do but there is everything that we can do we do why because the bible tells us to do that now brother branham are actually i looked at this in in history and it was not that there was a question that whether they should obey a magistrate but what they were saying is should they ever obey a power they were not saying well there's sometimes they do forces to do things that aren't right but they were saying we're christians why should we ever obey a roman power right and the apostle says yes we should because god has made government necessary he was arranged and ordered by his providence and there was something else going on during that time in history that during that time one emperor followed another in rapid succession you think we've got it bad now you ought to go back to first century rome right because one they had the stability of the uh the relative stability of the um the republic for so many hundreds of years longer the republic of rome lasted much longer than our democracy has and then at the end of that it just became dog-eat-dog the strongest man wins so whoever could kill the most people literally that's how they did it whoever could kill the most people actually become the emperor now you talk about a bad a bad time and there were all kinds of people in all kinds of ways trying to overthrow the government so you think politics are bad now back then everybody carried a dagger one to kill caesar right and so they're always there's all kinds of palace intrigue everything is going on the jews are in the romans and all the other ethnic groups out in the in the empire all want to override one another and paul says don't be a part of that the powers that be are ordained of god don't try to change the government right now he's not saying don't vote and get that out of the way real quick but don't try to go out and change the government by force and so there was a prevalent disposition in that time to rebel against tyranny because the emperor claudius had been put to death by poison caligula was put to death in a violent manner nero was a tyrant and amidst these agitations crimes revolutions the apostle wanted to guard christians from taking an active part in those political affairs don't be a part of that now we're coming to a place in this country where if if the country continues like it is people are mad enough that each other there could be civil war don't be a part of that see it's what he says the powers that be ordinated of god we don't go to overthrow the government right now seven years after paul wrote this the great persecution under nero began and there was a roman uh historian named tacitus and he was a young boy living in rome during the time of the persecutions and he wrote this and there had been a fire a great fire in rome and and there was a rumor that nero himself set rome on fire because he wanted to build his palace there which is what he did but he because he was charged with that he decided to charge the christians with that and during that time paul is living in rome under house arrest so he begins to charge the christians with these crimes and and historians believe that's when paul had his head cut off because he was one of the christians the leader of the christian so it would be a great thing for them to do that and so this roman historian began to write and he wrote this he said in their very deaths they were made the subjects of sport he's speaking of the christians they were covered with the heights of wild beasts and worried to death by dogs or nailed the crosses or set fire to when the day waned burnt to serve for the evening lights that's history nero who was the power that was the power that existed took christians stuck him on a pole covered him with tar and burnt them as lights in his garden that's hard to believe isn't it you know it could be worse thank god for the country that we do have huh not to say it couldn't get worse here but look i i really believe we're going home we're not going to go through that again we're going home now he would do that and he would stand there and and make support of them and even actually go out and kill people himself he was he was probably he's in the running for the worst leader of any kind in history paul lost his head to him a few years after this is written and paul says let every soul be subject to the higher powers and make you think won't it whoever therefore resisteth the power resisted the ordinance of god they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation he said for rulers are not a terror to good works but to the evil without them be afraid of the power do that which is good and i shall have praise are the same he said free is the minister of god to thee for good but if thou do that which is evil be afraid he beareth not the sword in vain he's the minister of god or avenger execute wrath upon him that doeth evil again in most cases if you follow the law you'll be left alone but not all because christians must suffer persecution he said wherefore you must need to be subject not only for wrath not because you get in trouble but also for conscience sake not because you might get a ticket but because it's the right thing to do he said for this cause pay your taxes so he says pay you tribute that word means taxes also he said they are god's ministers attending continually upon this very thing render therefore to all their dues tribute to whom tributes do custom to whom custom fear to whom fear honor to whom honor you look at that and think how can you respect a man like that but you know what paul did paul used the political system that existed the powers that be to promote the gospel he walked on the roads right that was during that time was the safest time in history until the last 100 years to travel because they built the roads and the army stood at the walls and they kept people robbers and things so paul was able to travel freely not only that but when he went into jerusalem and got into trouble he appealed to caesar that was his political right as a roman citizen he said i'm a citizen i'm appealing to caesar for what purpose not to free himself nero wasn't the kind of man that had pity on people he appealed to caesar he appealed to nero specifically because he wanted to preach the gospel to him think about that and so we we have to change our mindset from just being affected by politics to actually using the opportunity that we have to preach the gospel whatever that is if we're given freedom let's use it while we have it because we may not have it forever let's take advantage of this and and make sure that we're doing everything we can so that this gospel is preached in all nations now and again it doesn't mean that one might be better than another brother brandon mentioned three presidents you would be honored to have come to your house he mentions dwight eisenhower john kennedy lyndon johnson i have my own views about who's better out of that bunch and the latter two john kennedy linda johnson history says they weren't very good people just just as moral morally they were very not very good people but brother brown said if they come to your house and you were an american you would honor that he said though you might differ in politics again one might be far better than another you might vote for one over the other brother branham said he did just like augustus would have been better than nero nobody in their right mind would vote in nero right no christian is going to go if he had a vote if he had an ability to affect in any way he's not going to vote in nero but they're still run by the devil by permission from and ordained by god aren't you glad he's got it all in control you see we're not subject to the world order because we're its subjects we're subject to the world order because it is ordained by god or allowed by god to be we're not of this cosmos jesus said this about his disciples he said in john 17 9 i pray for them i pray not for the world the world order and i pray for them aren't you glad he prayed for you don't you feel good sister victoria when somebody's praying for you but he said i pray for them not only them only but those who believe on me through their word he said i pray for them i don't pray for the cosmos but for them which thou has given me for they are thine hallelujah these are special these may be insignificant to the world but they're special listen to me church you're special to god you may be insignificant to the world you may be insignificant at work you may be insignificant even in the church but you're special to god these are special he said all mine are thine and behind her mind and i am glorified in them he said and now i am no more in the world i'm not subject to this world order but these are in the world so he's leaving he's committing himself to death burial and resurrection he said and i come to thee holy father keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me that they may be one as we are you know the sermon brother brandon preached that on oneness john 17 12 while i was with them the world i kept them in thy name those that thou gavest me i have kept and none i like that regardless what the world order did none of them is lost but the son of perdition that the scripture might be fulfilled none would be an insult to his character to accuse him of losing one of the elect he never loses politicians like to be winners jesus never lost john 17 13 says now i come out to thee and these things i speak in the world that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves speaking of that little flock he said i have given them thy word and the world hath hated them because they are not of the world even as i am not of the world why do they hate you because you're not a part of that cosmos you're not a subject of that cosmos verse 15 i pray not that thou should have taken them out of the world but that thou should escape them from the evil so in other words they're going to have to live here they're going to have to pay their taxes they're going to have to vote or they have the opportunity to vote if it's a democracy don't take them out of the world let paul demand his right as a citizen to appear before the emperor don't take them out of the world keep them from the evil oh my brother branham did say this and questions answers on the seals he they told him are asking the question should evangelists continue on the field he said in this hour of course what they mean certainly by all means don't change a thing he said if jesus is coming in the morning preach today like it was going to be 10 years from today he said but live like it's going to be at this hour and this is what i want to get to he said don't get scrupled up now that's what i'm trying to warn you about see just don't be odd peculiar don't change nothing jesus said don't take him out of the world he said but if you're doing something wrong or doing evil repent see come back to god continue on your evangelistic service just as you always did again what did paul do he used the world order that existed to promote the gospel john 17 16 they are not of the world even as i am not of the world sanctify them through thy truth thy word is truth in other words set them apart for service verse 18 as thou hast sent me into the world even so have i also sent them into the world notice he didn't send them out of the world he sent them into the world right and that's why i think it's a mistake when people hide from the community we're sent into the world for good or bad there's nothing we preach here that the world can't know or can't hear all right that's what paul believed paul goes to the foremost center of learning in that day maybe the oxford university of the day was mars hill in athens and he walks up there and he begins to preach to those people about an unknown god why because he even quoted some of their own poets to him because there was nothing that paul said he may have been persecuted for it sure sure you'll you'll get persecution for it but there's nothing that we have what we have they need right we don't have to hide it from them go off build a church somewhere way out in the woods where nobody can find us and with no windows and clothes off to everything no what we have the world needs and so i want to take every opportunity and people question sometimes what we do but i want to take every opportunity that i have to present christ to the world and for you maybe that'll just be the way you live but present christ to the world use this system if you have to work if you have to do that i know sometimes we have to do things that aren't that aren't perfect we wish we didn't have to work as much as we did sometimes maybe you have to work instead of and you wish you could be at church sometimes you wish you could do certain things but use the political system don't let it come and bring you away from the word but use it to promote the gospel walk up there to pay those taxes with a smile on your face it's hard to do isn't it i may not preach that way after this next year and get my tax bill but it's easier to preach oh at the end of the year instead of in april he becomes subject to the world order for the purpose of redemption that's what he did now think about this for a moment i know it's kind of slow and dry tonight you forgive me but what did jesus do jesus come down into the cosmos made himself subject to the world order even the very fact that he was born in bethlehem was because caesar ordered the whole world to be taxed made himself subject census was going on account of the people and he made himself subject to that come down on the body in a form of a baby out himself to be subject to the powers that be and even when they ask him what you have to pay your taxes he said yes this sermon is not about paying taxes brother helen forgive me but but he took the remember he got the fish he had peter fish and he pulled the fish out of the sea it's got a coin in his mouth he said whose image is on it he says caesar's give to caesar what's caesar's give to god what's god's the second part is what we have to really remember but he said i sent them into the world he sent us into the world he came into the world he said as you have sent me into the world i have sent them into the world to what to become subject to the world order for the purpose of redemption amen i've sent them into the world to be a public testimony they won't react like the world does their candidate loses they don't go burn buildings huh they don't react like the world does they don't they don't involve themselves in the things of the world but they're they're a shining light a city set on a hill that cannot be hid their lives will be a public testimony he said like mine was amen like jesus was paul told agrippa when he come and stood before him as he was on his way to caesar it was like an appeals court before you would go on to to the emperor and in acts 26 26 he said for the king knoweth of these things before whom also i speak freely for i am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him for this thing was not done in a corner brother branham taught us and you can go look up the quotes but he said it's not shut up inside somewhere the whole world knows these things are going on he said the world is known the episcopalians the catholic the lutheran the denomination they knew that there's a god that works in his word in this day he said and keeps his signs and wonders moving it's not he said shut up in a corner another place he said oh it's not done in a corner he said it's only darkened conscience he said that's why the scientists couldn't even see that that was the face of christ they had to turn it a different direction they said what is it but they couldn't see and it was evident to us because a prophet come and made it evident right but he said it wasn't shut up in a corner they know but their conscience is darkened but they have to hear matthew 24 14 this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world and all the world order for a witness unto all nations and then shall the income don't be saddened by the world order use it as an opportunity to preach the gospel we don't have to be ashamed to publicly live and preach what we believe not ashamed paul says of the gospel of christ for the power of god and the salvation to everyone that believeth world order in acts 5 29 tried to command the apostles not to speak in jesus name and they said this he said we ought to obey god rather than men now watch here's something different when do you not obey the powers that be when they try to get you to quit preaching the gospel these governments have their place but jesus is king when is he going to be king he's already king amen he was already king he was king when he was laying in a manger he was king when he was on the cross he was king when he was laid in the grave he was king when he rose again but one day he was sit on the throne on the earth sit on the throne of david he'll be king in the earth and every kneel bound every tongue will confess luke 1 32 speaking of him when he was born he said he shall be great shall be called the son of the highest the lord god shall give unto him the throne of his father david and he shall reign over the house of jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end aren't you glad for that kingdoms come and go they always have they always will political systems rise and fall 10 years 20 years we'll be talking about something completely different as far as political systems go but look it looked like it was all over it looked like when he died and his disciples ran away it looks like in some ways it's all over today looks like there's not much going on it may even seem to some that the word has failed but he said not one word would go out void what has he come to tell us today fear not little flock there won't come a day when the king will come there will be no power but his he puts up with this right now but he said he's got a cup in his hand and he's gonna he's gonna feed the wicked the dregs out of the cup revelations 11 15 here we find when the seventh trumpeting angel sounds the seventh angel sounded there were great voices in heaven saying the kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our lord of his christ and he shall reign how long forever and ever not for four years not for eight years not for 25 years forever and ever listen brother brown says in revelation chapter 5 he said hallelujah one of these days the kingdoms of this world will fall and the legal owners will come in one of these days amen the legal owners will come in who's he talking about fear not little amen it's your father's pleasure it pleases god to give you the kingdom when it pleased god to give nebuchadnezzar the kingdom he gave it to him and then he took it from him when he plead when it please god to give cyrus the kingdom he'd give it to him he took it from him he pleased god to set up one kingdom or another one political system or another but now he said fear not little flock because it pleases him to give you the kingdom he won't take it away from you but you'll be there with him aren't you glad aren't you glad we're not bound just to this political world system to this order don't get too caught up in it i say that remind myself as well don't get too caught up in it whether one wins tomorrow or the other or next week or whenever all the lawsuits end when it all shakes out god had his hand in it we believe that let's bow our heads together musicians come heavenly father we thank you for your word thank you that you bring such an assurance to our lives and our hearts that you are completely in control that all is well and we have heard a message that has come and and spoke peace to our hearts fear not little flock for it is your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom i pray lord that you would we would take that to heart tonight that you would stamp it deeply on our hearts may we not be worried or afraid lord though we care we we do care we
