[51:13] want to please you in everything that we
[51:16] do we ask it in Jesus name amen amen God
[51:20] bless you turn with me to John chapter
[51:22] 18.
[51:24] John chapter 18 and verse 33
[51:30] I'll try not to hold you as long as I
[51:32] did last week
[51:35] Joel said amen
[51:40] John 18 33
[51:43] then pilate entered into the Judgment
[51:45] Hall again
[51:47] and called Jesus and said unto him art
[51:50] thou the king of the Jews
[51:52] Jesus answered him say it say a style
[51:54] this thing of thyself or did others tell
[51:56] it be of me
[51:58] there's a there's a sermon right there
[52:00] for the Joel
[52:02] for the steward Act
[52:04] are you saying this of yourself or did
[52:06] you just hear it
[52:08] and pilate answered am I a Jew
[52:11] thine own nation and the chief priests
[52:14] have delivered thee unto me
[52:17] what hast thou done
[52:18] Jesus answered my kingdom is not of this
[52:21] world yes if my kingdom were of this
[52:24] world then would my servants fight that
[52:26] I should not be delivered to the Jews
[52:28] but now is my kingdom not from its
[52:31] pilate therefore said unto him art thou
[52:33] a king then Jesus answered thou says
[52:36] that I'm a king to this end was I born
[52:39] and for this cause came I into the world
[52:41] that I should bear witness unto the
[52:43] truth
[52:43] everyone that is of the truth heareth my
[52:46] voice pilate saith unto him what is
[52:48] truth when he had said this he went out
[52:51] again unto the Jews and saith unto them
[52:53] I find in him no fault at all I can say
[52:57] Amen to that today he's all together
[52:59] lovely you may have your seats
[53:02] a blessed reading of the word
[53:05] we talked last week I used this text in
[53:08] a different way as we talked about truth
[53:11] and and what the truth was and how we
[53:14] are set free by it and we found out that
[53:17] the truth was actually what God had in
[53:20] his mind of us before the foundation of
[53:23] the world and so we could take that and
[53:26] say that the truth is our word body
[53:29] that's what's true about us and this
[53:32] body is the LIE right so the word body
[53:35] is the truth though this body is the lie
[53:38] and so we found that out but I want to
[53:40] turn a different direction this morning
[53:43] as as I was beginning to think about
[53:46] Pilate and and about Jesus as they were
[53:48] standing there together and they're
[53:50] facing one another and what they
[53:52] represented and and they actually
[53:55] represented two a different and distinct
[53:58] kingdoms that couldn't be farther away
[54:01] from each other that in the way that
[54:03] they were in their manner in their
[54:05] manner of uh of uh of government that
[54:09] they had because one was a kingdom of
[54:11] God and the other one was the kingdom or
[54:14] the Empire of Rome
[54:16] and these two kingdoms still exist today
[54:19] that we still have a kingdom of God and
[54:22] we still have a Roman Empire that runs
[54:26] all the way to the end we find that out
[54:27] in in Daniel's uh in the
[54:29] Nebuchadnezzar's dream uh that Daniel
[54:31] interpreted how that the uh the iron and
[54:34] the clay ran mixed all the way down to
[54:36] the feet and so we know that that Roman
[54:39] agenda about Roman idea is still here
[54:42] today that manner of government that
[54:45] that worldly system that uh that does
[54:47] things a certain way and yet there's a
[54:50] way that God does things and we want to
[54:52] make sure that what we're doing we're
[54:54] doing things according to the way God
[54:56] does things and not things according to
[54:58] the way the Roman system does
[55:01] so we find that piling pilot is an
[55:04] interesting figure he he represents the
[55:07] highest Authority in the known world at
[55:09] that time he represents the Roman
[55:12] Emperor Tiberius who was the highest uh
[55:15] the highest Authority and he come in in
[55:18] tiberius's name to bring uh to bring his
[55:22] kingdom to bring the Roman Kingdom into
[55:25] Judea and then we find on the contrast
[55:28] on the other side that Jesus actually
[55:30] come in his father's name and he come to
[55:34] bring the the kingdom of God to the
[55:37] people of God and yet the way that they
[55:39] would go about it would be very
[55:40] different now pilate was born in Italy
[55:44] probably in Rome uh he was not Roman by
[55:47] ancestry he was probably a Sam Knight
[55:50] which is a actually a tribe that was
[55:53] there in Rome they were the last tribe
[55:54] to really challenge the supremacy of
[55:57] Rome on the Italian Peninsula but
[56:00] actually the Sam Knights say it wouldn't
[56:03] have been born into Roman nobility and
[56:05] so pilate had had to work his way up in
[56:08] Roman politics he and he had to learn
[56:11] the hard way that decisions had to be
[56:14] based on on power decisions were based
[56:18] on might the person with the with the
[56:20] biggest stick the person with the
[56:22] largest ability to bring forth to a
[56:25] situation was the person who won in the
[56:28] ancient world
[56:29] and that's still true today
[56:31] in the world that we live in the people
[56:33] with the most money the people with the
[56:35] biggest crowd the the denominations that
[56:37] consolidate power they're the ones who
[56:39] control things the governments that are
[56:42] superpowers the governments that can
[56:44] bring power to Bear but that is not the
[56:47] way the kingdom of God operates and it
[56:49] shouldn't be the way we operate here in
[56:51] the church yes sir
[56:54] so the the Sam Knights say they were a
[56:56] people who had fought the Romans and
[56:58] then had been assimilated into Roman
[56:59] culture one of pilate's ancestors
[57:02] probable ancestors was uh gavius Pontius
[57:05] who was the one who defeated the Romans
[57:07] at the caudine forks I don't know if
[57:09] you've heard of that battle is the
[57:11] greatest defeat that the Romans ever had
[57:13] they were actually so caught into uh
[57:16] into that place that they couldn't get
[57:18] out of it and had to lay down their arms
[57:20] it was a humiliating defeat by the
[57:22] Romans but that Roman system the reason
[57:25] the Romans won was not because they were
[57:27] more powerful or or even had more men or
[57:29] more money but they had great willpower
[57:31] they didn't care to slaughter thousands
[57:33] of men it didn't bother them to what
[57:36] what they did they were they were amoral
[57:39] in that way they just didn't they it
[57:40] didn't bother them at all so they would
[57:42] just keep coming back and keep coming
[57:44] back and keep coming back and that's
[57:46] just the nature of the Roman system and
[57:49] so and they didn't the Romans didn't
[57:51] really build anything I I know you
[57:52] didn't sign up for a history lesson
[57:54] today but I want to give you an insight
[57:57] into the culture of the world that we
[57:59] live in that's the culture of today yeah
[58:02] yeah and so the Romans didn't really
[58:03] build anything they just perverted other
[58:05] people's stuff
[58:07] the Romans weren't shipbuilders but they
[58:09] beat Carthage in the sea by by uh by
[58:12] building the new types of ships and and
[58:15] new weapons on the ships and and so the
[58:17] Romans was always adopting things they
[58:19] adopted Greek culture and even Greek
[58:22] gods just changed them to Roman names
[58:24] and they were that's the way they did
[58:26] things can't you see how the Roman
[58:28] Catholic Church did the same thing when
[58:30] they saw the power of Christianity and
[58:32] they saw how the people were becoming
[58:34] Christians and it was taking over that
[58:36] that Roman Spirit got involved in it and
[58:39] saw it as a way and even Constantine
[58:40] said I saw a dream or a vision and it
[58:43] said conquered by this and he saw a
[58:45] cross and it was a Roman idea that they
[58:48] could take over the world using
[58:49] Christianity they had no problem with
[58:51] that they would use whatever they could
[58:54] to have power
[58:55] so now uh this Pilot's ancestor gave his
[59:00] Pontius was the one
[59:01] who defeated the Romans there the
[59:04] general that defeated the Romans
[59:06] and he had mercy on them
[59:08] and it was not a thing you could do with
[59:10] the Romans yeah
[59:11] he let them go and and he famously he
[59:14] stripped their weapons from them and
[59:16] made them pass under the the Yoke and
[59:19] and they went back to Rome but 30 years
[59:22] later they captured him
[59:24] and when they captured him they executed
[59:26] him
[59:28] because they they understood the
[59:30] application of power
[59:32] and so pilate knowing the story as being
[59:35] one of his ancestors and and he would
[59:37] have understood that only Power only the
[59:41] application of power works and and I
[59:43] want you to understand that's the way
[59:45] the world is today people understand
[59:46] that you do what you can do yeah yeah
[59:48] not what you should do
[59:50] and that's the way our government works
[59:52] that's the way many churches work that's
[59:54] the way denomination works we should
[59:56] never work that way because we're under
[59:58] a different Kingdom
[1:00:00] we don't do stuff just because we can
[1:00:03] we do it because it's right
[1:00:05] because it's the word of God
[1:00:08] and
[1:00:09] so we're looking to another kingdom now
[1:00:13] uh the Romans
[1:00:15] didn't become Rome by showing Mercy
[1:00:19] and Pontius was the family name the
[1:00:21] pilot named pilate uh came from his his
[1:00:24] or his father's ability with the javelin
[1:00:26] pilate means a good with a javelin
[1:00:28] basically
[1:00:30] and so he would have been a warrior
[1:00:33] he would have been born into a big house
[1:00:36] when he was born a great party would
[1:00:38] have been thrown how different that is
[1:00:41] from when Christ the King was born
[1:00:44] he was born into a Manger in a stable he
[1:00:47] was born to a poor family but pilate
[1:00:50] would have been born into a big house
[1:00:52] he would have been surrounded by
[1:00:54] Splendor even though his family wasn't
[1:00:55] one of the top families but he would
[1:00:57] have been surrounded by the Splendor of
[1:00:59] what they called The Eternal City he
[1:01:01] would have been all growing up of its
[1:01:03] temples and government buildings and he
[1:01:05] would have been born into a family with
[1:01:07] high expectations that would have
[1:01:09] required him to do his best to lead the
[1:01:11] family into becoming senators or or even
[1:01:14] marrying into the Imperial family and so
[1:01:17] he would have been born with a
[1:01:18] expectation to succeed
[1:01:20] he had to make it and I think sometimes
[1:01:24] we we have to be careful what
[1:01:26] expectations we put on our children
[1:01:28] because if we give sometimes we want
[1:01:31] them to succeed so badly but remember
[1:01:33] this is a Roman system
[1:01:36] right we want them to succeed I want my
[1:01:38] children to succeed I want them to go to
[1:01:40] school and be doctors and lawyers and
[1:01:42] everything else but I want them more to
[1:01:43] succeed in the gospel
[1:01:45] I'd rather that they become preachers
[1:01:47] I'd rather they become singers I'd
[1:01:49] rather they attended the house of God
[1:01:50] Faithfully than be somebody that becomes
[1:01:53] some great person in the world
[1:01:55] so we've got to get our priorities
[1:01:57] straight
[1:01:58] so now he did his best to maybe to do
[1:02:02] what he could to become what his family
[1:02:04] wanted him to be
[1:02:06] when he was 18 he probably went into the
[1:02:08] military women as an officer because of
[1:02:10] his family name
[1:02:11] when he was back in Rome after
[1:02:13] campaigning he would have been in a
[1:02:15] social class which would have allowed
[1:02:16] him to be rich enough to own a summer
[1:02:18] home and a winter home
[1:02:21] he became a member of the praetorian
[1:02:23] guard and they were fanatical bodyguards
[1:02:26] who worshiped the emperor's deity
[1:02:28] we know that he was a close friend of
[1:02:30] the head of the Guard who had a an
[1:02:32] influence with the emperor Tiberius so
[1:02:34] he had a connection to power
[1:02:37] he was about 30 years old or at least 30
[1:02:40] when he was appointed Governor probably
[1:02:42] in his 30s when he came to Judea him and
[1:02:44] Jesus would have been about the same age
[1:02:48] unlike Jesus we know he was married
[1:02:50] because his wife told him don't have
[1:02:52] anything to do with this just man
[1:02:55] he had a cruel streak
[1:02:57] he was hated by the Jews for in Luke
[1:02:59] Chapter 13 and verse 1 it says they were
[1:03:02] present at that season some that told
[1:03:03] him of the galileans whose blood pilate
[1:03:06] had mingled with their sacrifices
[1:03:08] and what he had done is actually he
[1:03:10] disguised men as Jews and he put them
[1:03:13] out with the Jews when the Jews began to
[1:03:14] protest as they often did something he
[1:03:17] was doing he had them take out their
[1:03:18] knives and just knife him
[1:03:20] and hundreds of Jews fell and so that's
[1:03:23] why he said he mingled their blood with
[1:03:24] the sacrifice even on the temple porch
[1:03:27] he understood military power and
[1:03:29] political power
[1:03:31] he would have arrived in Judea in about
[1:03:33] 26 A.D I got thinking about that almost
[1:03:36] exactly 2 000 years ago here in a couple
[1:03:38] years
[1:03:39] ready to project the power of Rome to
[1:03:43] the unruly Jews
[1:03:45] the the Romans were very racist when it
[1:03:48] comes to the Jews say they didn't want
[1:03:50] to be called Jews that's why pilate
[1:03:51] exclaims to Jesus am I a Jew
[1:03:54] he said am I a Jew he didn't want to be
[1:03:56] called to Jew Jew was a low life Jews
[1:03:59] always making trouble the uh you see the
[1:04:01] hear the uh the Romans obeyed orders
[1:04:04] they were a very militaristic people a
[1:04:07] very obedient people when it come to
[1:04:08] obeying orders
[1:04:10] and so his kingdom represented power it
[1:04:14] represented War it represented cruelty
[1:04:17] and force and that's why when it comes
[1:04:19] in it's in its fullness when it's
[1:04:21] manifested in the Antichrist that's why
[1:04:23] the tribulation period one of the
[1:04:25] reasons it'll be so awful is because he
[1:04:27] manifests himself fully in that
[1:04:29] dictatorial that's what he is
[1:04:32] right and even in the church that's what
[1:04:34] come down to the Roman Church and but it
[1:04:37] was not an original idea
[1:04:39] it originated in the scripture actually
[1:04:41] with nimrod Nimrod remember Romans the
[1:04:44] second Babylon I hope I'm not moving too
[1:04:46] fast this morning but I want to lay this
[1:04:48] foundation so we can go somewhere today
[1:04:51] but in nimrod's time the Bible says Kush
[1:04:54] began Nimrod he began to be a mighty one
[1:04:56] in the Earth
[1:04:57] he was a mighty Hunter before the Lord
[1:04:59] and what that word mighty one means is a
[1:05:02] he began to be a mighty man or or a man
[1:05:05] that was greater than everyone else
[1:05:08] he began to be the great one and
[1:05:10] remember when it comes to this Kingdom
[1:05:12] that we live in there are no great ones
[1:05:15] right but there are no big eyes in
[1:05:17] little use but when it comes to that one
[1:05:20] to that Kingdom of nimrod there was a
[1:05:22] great one he was a great one and he
[1:05:25] founded Babel Romans the second Babylon
[1:05:29] and brother Branham says this about it
[1:05:30] he said now there's nothing in the Bible
[1:05:32] that would type our modern organizations
[1:05:34] except Babylon that's the only type in
[1:05:37] the Bible of our modern organization
[1:05:38] organized religion because it was
[1:05:40] founded by Nimrod in a forced Unity
[1:05:42] amongst religious people
[1:05:44] we want Unity we want Fellowship we we
[1:05:47] want all that's why we have these
[1:05:49] meanings and things we want to have
[1:05:50] Fellowship we want people to be able to
[1:05:52] Fellowship freely but it can't be forced
[1:05:55] not even in the local church you can't
[1:05:57] force Unity yeah
[1:05:59] yeah right because that's a Roman idea
[1:06:01] now he said he said it was founded by
[1:06:05] Nimrod a forced unity and that's what
[1:06:06] the Creeds in our denominations do today
[1:06:08] Force Unity you either belong to this or
[1:06:11] you're out he said we're coming now so
[1:06:13] we can see to a forcing all into one
[1:06:15] great Unity of it but that is a
[1:06:17] mechanical made advice by a man and it
[1:06:21] cannot stand it is not God's will it is
[1:06:24] not God's program no matter how people
[1:06:26] try to say it is it's not it can't be
[1:06:28] what is God's program God calls an
[1:06:31] individual God calls a man God calls the
[1:06:33] pastor God calls it evangelist but he
[1:06:35] doesn't call a system
[1:06:38] yeah
[1:06:39] that's good are you with me so far
[1:06:41] I know it's not a shouting message but
[1:06:44] maybe we can stir up our spiritual
[1:06:46] gastronomics this morning as as brother
[1:06:48] Brandon would say you know if you get to
[1:06:50] eat in something good you get to eat
[1:06:52] something good it begins to it begins to
[1:06:54] make you feel good when you begin to eat
[1:06:56] good on the word it begins to make you
[1:06:57] feel good
[1:06:59] hey man you start you can say something
[1:07:01] about it
[1:07:02] so brother Brandon said it's just
[1:07:04] impossible for it to be God wouldn't put
[1:07:07] his name in such a thing as that that
[1:07:10] denies his word how can God live in
[1:07:12] something that denies his own word he
[1:07:14] cannot
[1:07:15] do that
[1:07:17] so pilate only understands Force that's
[1:07:20] his kingdom yeah yeah we don't get
[1:07:22] people to come to church by force
[1:07:24] so the brand have talked about the
[1:07:26] people in Arizona he was having a hard
[1:07:27] time getting them to come to go to
[1:07:29] church some of them still today he has a
[1:07:30] hard time getting them to go to church
[1:07:32] but but here he was having a hard time
[1:07:35] and and but they were going to
[1:07:36] denominational churches and
[1:07:38] and when they would go they would want
[1:07:40] to sign them up he said I went to some
[1:07:42] of them the first day you're there
[1:07:43] they'll approach you join our church
[1:07:45] if you don't do it you're not welcome
[1:07:48] right and that Spirit still exists if
[1:07:50] we're not careful it's not like we're
[1:07:52] you know with the bride can't be
[1:07:53] deceived
[1:07:55] but there's times that we become misled
[1:07:57] by denominational ideas
[1:08:00] and this idea that well if you're not in
[1:08:03] our church you don't count
[1:08:05] preach where does that come from it
[1:08:08] comes from a Roman system it comes from
[1:08:10] the other Kingdom yeah
[1:08:12] yeah right because really all God's
[1:08:14] people count and we should care for all
[1:08:17] of God's children we shouldn't care for
[1:08:18] the elect and the non-elect we should
[1:08:20] care for our church and other churches
[1:08:22] we should care for the people of God
[1:08:25] we should care not because we can you
[1:08:27] say well we can't change the elect to
[1:08:29] non-elect that or not elect to elect
[1:08:30] that's true but we can care for people
[1:08:32] because it's Who We Are
[1:08:34] that's just who we are we we care for
[1:08:36] people we love people
[1:08:39] but well it's not a fourth thing he said
[1:08:41] join our church if you don't do it
[1:08:42] you're not welcome see he said it's a
[1:08:44] force thing it's forced upon you and
[1:08:46] that's Babylon but in Christ you come in
[1:08:49] by election not by force you believe
[1:08:52] that this morning your heart pulls you
[1:08:55] in
[1:08:57] so now the system of force filtered down
[1:09:01] into the early church
[1:09:03] and very quickly the Bible says in
[1:09:05] Revelation 2 15 that has so hast thou
[1:09:08] also them that hold the doctrine of the
[1:09:10] Nicolaitans which thing I hate
[1:09:13] nickel means to conquer Leo which means
[1:09:16] the laity nicolaitan means to conquer
[1:09:18] the laity now why is this such a
[1:09:20] terrible thing it's terrible because God
[1:09:23] has never someone say never
[1:09:25] he has never placed his church in the
[1:09:27] hands of an elected leadership which
[1:09:30] moves with political mindedness
[1:09:35] oh my
[1:09:37] God now people move with political
[1:09:38] mindness but God won't place his church
[1:09:40] in the hands of that yeah
[1:09:42] I'm glad the message is the way that it
[1:09:44] is and every church is Sovereign in
[1:09:46] itself
[1:09:47] I'm so glad brother Brown said this
[1:09:49] message would never become a
[1:09:50] denomination there may be many
[1:09:52] denominational spirits but it'll never
[1:09:54] become a denomination why because we're
[1:09:56] not deaf we don't want that Roman system
[1:09:58] we don't want we don't want that elected
[1:10:00] leadership that moves with political
[1:10:02] minders we want men of God who know how
[1:10:04] to pray men who know how to get in touch
[1:10:06] with God men who know how to how to
[1:10:08] stand before the people with humility
[1:10:10] and with a transparent life
[1:10:14] so now
[1:10:15] you remember God chose David the people
[1:10:17] chose Saul yeah
[1:10:19] yeah right and the People's Choice
[1:10:20] always moves with political mindedness
[1:10:23] but now he has placed his church in the
[1:10:25] care of God ordained Spirit-filled word
[1:10:28] living men amen who lead the people
[1:10:31] through feeding them the word
[1:10:34] not by force
[1:10:36] but through feeding them the word
[1:10:40] he is not separated the people into
[1:10:41] classes so that the masses are led by a
[1:10:44] holy priesthood
[1:10:46] right so when we talk about a
[1:10:48] transparent life my life has to be
[1:10:50] transparent
[1:10:51] so does yours
[1:10:54] right
[1:10:55] We Are Holy people
[1:10:57] not just the holy pastor
[1:11:00] right
[1:11:01] and we're all holy by the blood of the
[1:11:03] Lamb
[1:11:04] but we're supposed to be transparent I
[1:11:06] don't mean that you have to tell
[1:11:07] everything that ever happened to you
[1:11:08] what I mean by that is the way you live
[1:11:10] at church is the way you live at home
[1:11:12] right you're not a sinner at home and a
[1:11:14] Christian at church but you're a
[1:11:16] Christian seven days a week
[1:11:19] it's true the leadership must be holy
[1:11:21] but then so must be the whole
[1:11:22] congregation yeah further there's no
[1:11:24] place in the word where priests or
[1:11:26] ministers or such mediate between God
[1:11:29] and the people come on now nor is there
[1:11:31] a place where they are separated in
[1:11:33] their worship of the Lord
[1:11:35] they are not separated in their worship
[1:11:37] of the Lord
[1:11:38] I've got to worship with you if I never
[1:11:41] worship with you then what happens is
[1:11:43] I'm not getting I'm not giving any
[1:11:45] worship to God I have a responsibility
[1:11:47] not just to preach to you but to worship
[1:11:50] with you
[1:11:51] and it's one of the great things that
[1:11:53] happens to ministers or even the song
[1:11:55] leaders at times and people is we forget
[1:11:58] to worship with the people we're not
[1:12:00] just Leading the People In Worship but
[1:12:01] we're supposed to worship with the
[1:12:03] people
[1:12:06] we're to worship with the people we are
[1:12:09] also in need of of healing sometimes we
[1:12:12] are also in need of salvation of our
[1:12:14] children we are also in need of the
[1:12:16] power of God to move through we need to
[1:12:18] hear that we're the elect of God we need
[1:12:20] to hear that we're we're the pride of
[1:12:22] Jesus Christ we need to hear that yeah
[1:12:24] As Leaders we need to hear that yes
[1:12:26] oh my because we have to we worship with
[1:12:29] the people not separated in our worship
[1:12:32] God wants all to love and serve him
[1:12:34] together
[1:12:35] nicolaitanism destroys those precepts
[1:12:38] and instead separates the ministers from
[1:12:40] the people that makes the leaders
[1:12:42] overlords instead of servants
[1:12:45] so now this Doctrine actually started as
[1:12:46] a deed in the first stage it appears
[1:12:48] that the problem lay in two words elders
[1:12:50] presbyters and overseers Bishops I I
[1:12:52] want to go through this it might get a
[1:12:54] little dry for a minute but I I want you
[1:12:55] to understand how it come in that early
[1:12:57] church he said those scripture shows
[1:13:00] there are several Elders in each Church
[1:13:02] some began Ignatius among them to teach
[1:13:04] that the idea of a bishop was one of
[1:13:06] preeminence or authority and control
[1:13:08] over the elders now the truth of the
[1:13:10] matter is the word Elder signifies who
[1:13:12] the person is
[1:13:14] while the word Bishop signifies the
[1:13:16] office of the same man
[1:13:18] right so a pastor would be a an elder
[1:13:20] and a bishop but there are other elders
[1:13:23] because in Elders the man he said Bishop
[1:13:26] is the office of the man
[1:13:28] Elder always has and always will refer
[1:13:30] simply to a man's chronological age in
[1:13:33] the Lord
[1:13:35] right so you know you can't just tell by
[1:13:37] how old a person is but but how long and
[1:13:40] and how faithful they've been to that to
[1:13:42] the things of God so that could be an
[1:13:45] elder so he's not an elder because he is
[1:13:48] elected or ordained but because he's
[1:13:50] older
[1:13:51] well that's simple isn't it
[1:13:53] he is more seasoned trained not a novice
[1:13:55] reliable because of experience
[1:13:58] long-standing proof of his Christian
[1:14:00] experience
[1:14:01] he said but no the Bishops did not stick
[1:14:03] to the Epistles of Paul but rather they
[1:14:05] went to Paul's account of the time he
[1:14:07] called the elders from Ephesus to my
[1:14:08] lead us in Acts 20 and verse 17 the
[1:14:10] record States Elders were called verse
[1:14:13] 28 they were called overseers or Bishops
[1:14:14] these Bishops no doubt politically
[1:14:16] minded and anxious for power and
[1:14:18] insisted that Paul had given the meaning
[1:14:20] that overseers were more than the local
[1:14:22] Elder with official capacity only in his
[1:14:25] own church
[1:14:26] why because why do they do that
[1:14:29] why would they trade the freedom of the
[1:14:31] spirit and the way that the move of God
[1:14:33] was operating you realize there were
[1:14:35] people in that age that saw a move of
[1:14:37] God understood they saw people rejoicing
[1:14:39] in Freedom they saw the Devils cast out
[1:14:41] they saw the power of God moving in such
[1:14:44] a mighty way in that early church and
[1:14:45] they said we got to fix this
[1:14:47] yeah
[1:14:49] yeah
[1:14:50] right I said this oh we need some more
[1:14:52] leadership well we need a little less
[1:14:54] Freedom we need more we need more
[1:14:57] control we need a little more don't you
[1:14:59] realize that same spirit is alive today
[1:15:01] although we would never allow that to
[1:15:03] come in among us we need the freedom of
[1:15:05] the worship of God we need the spirit of
[1:15:07] God we need the local church to be
[1:15:09] Sovereign but we don't need the local
[1:15:10] church to become a cult either or some
[1:15:12] little place where we withdraw from the
[1:15:14] world and we and we and we have to tell
[1:15:16] the pastor has to tell us what clothes
[1:15:17] to wear on Sunday I'm so glad that's not
[1:15:20] my responsibility my responsibility is
[1:15:22] to feed you the word and when I feed you
[1:15:24] the word your responsibility is to go
[1:15:26] live It Go manifest it all right
[1:15:30] huh
[1:15:31] no power over that
[1:15:33] just to preach the word
[1:15:36] though but they wanted men with official
[1:15:38] capacity that could impose discipline
[1:15:40] when the Holy Ghost is supposed to
[1:15:41] discipline the church
[1:15:44] and God had leadership God does have
[1:15:46] leadership he has Elders he has a way
[1:15:49] right he does have men who are called to
[1:15:51] be in that position
[1:15:52] but if we do it differently than the way
[1:15:55] he did it it becomes Roman why would
[1:15:58] they do that because they were inspired
[1:16:00] by that Spirit yes
[1:16:02] that culture was all around them that's
[1:16:04] right
[1:16:05] that's right right why was pilate who he
[1:16:07] was he was just a part of that culture
[1:16:09] that was just the culture that he was in
[1:16:11] and so it didn't seem weird to him at
[1:16:14] all
[1:16:15] to make judgments based on politics
[1:16:19] right that was the right thing to do
[1:16:21] Romans they they looked at the wisdom of
[1:16:23] a Man based on how successful he was
[1:16:25] yeah not whether he made the right
[1:16:28] decision or not right but how successful
[1:16:30] he was and so pilate made a decision
[1:16:33] based on his own success to try to
[1:16:36] further his own his own kingdom or his
[1:16:39] own government there as he was a
[1:16:41] representative of that Kingdom of Rome
[1:16:43] but we today we make decisions based on
[1:16:45] furthering Our Kingdom
[1:16:48] and what about what is it our kingdom is
[1:16:50] Never furthered by wrong means
[1:16:54] and what that what I mean by that is
[1:16:56] it's not furthered by doing things the
[1:16:58] wrong way
[1:16:59] to reach a desired result no you do
[1:17:02] things the right way and God will take
[1:17:04] care of the results
[1:17:06] yeah right you never do the wrong thing
[1:17:08] the right way we find that David failed
[1:17:10] in that bringing the ark back and you
[1:17:11] all know that story I'm gonna get in
[1:17:13] trouble if I don't get back to my notes
[1:17:15] now
[1:17:16] to them a bishop was now one with
[1:17:18] extended authority over many local
[1:17:20] leaders such a concept was neither
[1:17:22] scriptural nor historical even a man of
[1:17:24] the Statue of polycarp lean towards such
[1:17:26] an organization that's what started as a
[1:17:28] deed in the first stage was made a
[1:17:29] literal Doctrine and so it is today
[1:17:31] Bishops still claimed power to control
[1:17:34] men and deal with them as they desire
[1:17:35] placing them where they so will in the
[1:17:38] ministry this denies the leadership of
[1:17:40] the Holy Ghost
[1:17:41] who said separate me Paul and Barnabas
[1:17:44] for the work wherein to I have called
[1:17:46] them this is anti-word and Antichrist
[1:17:50] what was it a kingdom of power
[1:17:53] that come and filter this way down
[1:17:55] through the church
[1:17:56] but this other this prisoner
[1:17:59] the king who was standing there pilate
[1:18:02] was not a king he was a governor but
[1:18:04] there was a king standing there
[1:18:06] and the King that was standing there
[1:18:09] represented a far different Kingdom
[1:18:12] then pilate did he was born in a manger
[1:18:16] he didn't have a place to lay his head
[1:18:19] he had 12 followers and one of them was
[1:18:22] the devil and the other ones didn't have
[1:18:24] the Holy Ghost
[1:18:25] couldn't follow him correctly
[1:18:28] he couldn't even keep his own his own
[1:18:30] followers in line
[1:18:32] and so the world looked at him as a
[1:18:34] failure
[1:18:35] the world said he can't even he run
[1:18:37] everybody off when he said eat my flesh
[1:18:39] and drink my blood his church is only 12
[1:18:42] people and one of them is the devil
[1:18:45] right they said he's a failure but they
[1:18:47] didn't realize he represented a
[1:18:48] different Kingdom
[1:18:50] oh God help us today we get wrapped up
[1:18:53] in numbers we get wrapped up in ideas we
[1:18:55] get wrapped up in in stardom we get
[1:18:57] wrapped up in social media and we think
[1:18:59] the most likes means that but the most
[1:19:01] liked things are sometimes the most vile
[1:19:03] things
[1:19:04] the most liked things are sometimes the
[1:19:07] hormones what gives the word of God why
[1:19:10] because they it's the will of the
[1:19:11] majority but we have to find the will of
[1:19:13] God
[1:19:15] and Jesus did nothing except the father
[1:19:17] showed him
[1:19:18] yeah we find this example of a different
[1:19:20] Kingdom shown in the way Jesus interacts
[1:19:23] with his disciples
[1:19:24] when James and John come up to him under
[1:19:27] that influence of a Roman system where
[1:19:31] there were great ones who would be put
[1:19:33] up in magistrates and civil Authority
[1:19:35] they come to Jesus and they said they
[1:19:38] said when when you when you come into
[1:19:40] your kingdom we want to be on the right
[1:19:41] hand and the left actually they had
[1:19:43] their mother do it
[1:19:46] which is a
[1:19:48] Spirits don't die
[1:19:53] but you know her mom you'd want your
[1:19:55] children to have that privilege right
[1:19:57] and Jesus didn't rebuke them but he'd
[1:19:59] come back he said you're not thinking
[1:20:01] right
[1:20:02] you're not thinking right because now
[1:20:03] everybody else gets mad
[1:20:05] right because everybody else is in the
[1:20:07] church the little church is all upset
[1:20:09] you say well you know this must not be
[1:20:11] must not be a Church of God if we ever
[1:20:13] have problems in the church where did
[1:20:15] you hear that from
[1:20:17] there was dissension in the early church
[1:20:19] there was dissension among the disciples
[1:20:21] the only place were ever recorded that
[1:20:24] they were in one Accord in one place is
[1:20:26] when they were in the upper room
[1:20:28] and as soon as they left and started
[1:20:30] doing the work they still disagreed oh
[1:20:32] but I'm so glad we can agree on the big
[1:20:34] things I'm so glad we have an atonement
[1:20:36] we can Fellowship around there's
[1:20:38] something we can we can agree on
[1:20:41] but it's not going to be every little
[1:20:42] thing and what kind of pie that we eat
[1:20:43] or something like that so when they
[1:20:45] begin to be all stirred up about it when
[1:20:47] the ten heard it they were moved with
[1:20:49] indignation against the two Brethren why
[1:20:51] because they wanted those spots
[1:20:55] huh oh I can't believe you've elevated
[1:20:58] him to this office I wanted that office
[1:21:02] and they were moved with indignation
[1:21:04] against them but Jesus called them unto
[1:21:07] him and said you know that the princes
[1:21:09] of the Gentiles exercised dominion over
[1:21:11] them and they that are great exercise
[1:21:13] Authority upon them the princes of the
[1:21:16] Gentiles that's the Roman Kingdom
[1:21:18] but it shall not be so among you
[1:21:21] but whosoever would be great among you
[1:21:23] let him be your minister that word is
[1:21:26] servant or slave
[1:21:29] whosoever it actually is the same word
[1:21:31] for deacon
[1:21:32] go look it up whoever will be great
[1:21:34] among you let him do the work of a
[1:21:36] deacon
[1:21:37] who the original deacons served tables
[1:21:41] they waited tables that's what they were
[1:21:43] they were created for the office of the
[1:21:45] deacon was first created to help and
[1:21:46] they've got many other jobs we thank God
[1:21:48] for our deacons but he said if you want
[1:21:49] to be great be a deacon in other words
[1:21:51] be somebody who's helpful somebody who's
[1:21:53] there somebody who's always available
[1:21:55] you want to be great in the kingdom of
[1:21:57] God don't want to don't try to be some
[1:21:59] big thing where everybody can see you
[1:22:00] working but try to be something that'll
[1:22:02] help the people of God on the inner
[1:22:05] workings of the church
[1:22:07] whoever will be great let him be your
[1:22:09] minister
[1:22:10] whosoever will be your Chief among you
[1:22:13] let him be your servant
[1:22:14] even as the son of man came not to be
[1:22:17] ministered unto but to minister and to
[1:22:20] give his life a ransom for many oh if he
[1:22:22] could give his life if that's why he
[1:22:24] came why can't we give our life today
[1:22:25] but the random taught us that eternal
[1:22:27] life was living for others if his life
[1:22:29] was living for others as I just listened
[1:22:31] to Brother Brad and preached out the
[1:22:32] other day and I began to think oh God
[1:22:34] how much eternal life do we have because
[1:22:36] eternal life he said is living for
[1:22:38] others if eternal life is living for
[1:22:40] others let me live for others like you
[1:22:41] did Lord let me live sacrificially let
[1:22:44] me live with all of my heart let me live
[1:22:46] with all of my being let me live for the
[1:22:47] people of God yes sir and I've got
[1:22:51] responsibilities here at the church but
[1:22:53] I've got responsibilities to those on
[1:22:54] the outside too I want to help you if I
[1:22:57] can I want to help you if I can I think
[1:23:00] we all ought to be that way we all we
[1:23:02] ought to want to help one another
[1:23:04] huh
[1:23:06] well all I do is take care of children
[1:23:08] you're helping somebody yeah
[1:23:10] yeah well the brown talked about a good
[1:23:11] doctor how there would be a reward for a
[1:23:13] good doctor yeah
[1:23:14] who helped people
[1:23:16] be a reward for people to help children
[1:23:17] there'll be a reward for people help in
[1:23:19] the church
[1:23:20] it would be a reward for Sunday school
[1:23:22] teachers and there'll be a reward for
[1:23:24] helpers and there'll be a reward for
[1:23:25] people who cook and it'll be a reward
[1:23:27] for people to provide oh my
[1:23:29] God why because that's part of the
[1:23:31] kingdom and we don't do it expecting a
[1:23:33] quid pro quo which is a Latin term
[1:23:35] because it comes from that system yeah
[1:23:38] yeah you give something and I give it
[1:23:39] back you give something and I get
[1:23:41] something that's not what we do this
[1:23:42] ain't politics this ain't Republicans
[1:23:44] and Democrats it's the Church of God
[1:23:46] it's the kingdom of God and the kingdom
[1:23:48] of God operates on the move of the
[1:23:50] spirit of God not on the who gets what
[1:23:53] that's right
[1:23:56] are you still with me this morning
[1:24:01] so good to see that young man on the
[1:24:02] front row my goodness
[1:24:04] he's dressed almost like me too
[1:24:06] I just wish I had that tie
[1:24:09] Matthew 5 and 1.
[1:24:11] seeing the multitudes he went up into a
[1:24:14] mountain
[1:24:15] when he was set his disciples came unto
[1:24:17] him
[1:24:18] his kingdom was different
[1:24:21] he opened his mouth and taught them
[1:24:23] saying blessed are the poor in spirit
[1:24:27] that word poor is beggarly
[1:24:29] needy
[1:24:31] blessed are the beggars
[1:24:34] he says not the natural Beggars but the
[1:24:35] spiritual beggars
[1:24:38] the spiritual beggars blessed are the
[1:24:41] beggars in spirit the beggars in spirit
[1:24:44] are people who have needs
[1:24:46] in their spirit and they come to the
[1:24:47] house of God they don't come walking in
[1:24:49] and say oh what can I do today to make
[1:24:51] myself great to make my name great to
[1:24:53] help my my family great rise up in the
[1:24:56] in the church to help my my people rise
[1:24:58] up and myself rise up that's the way
[1:25:00] they come they say Lord today I have a
[1:25:02] need today I got a sickness today I got
[1:25:04] family that's in need today Lord would
[1:25:06] you bless my pastor because I know that
[1:25:08] by the preaching of the word you can
[1:25:10] heal my diseases I know that by the
[1:25:12] laying on of hands I can be healed my
[1:25:14] family can be healed they can be saved
[1:25:16] and so the spiritual Beggars come to
[1:25:18] church that way they come to church like
[1:25:20] the woman who washed his feet and said
[1:25:22] is there is there something I can do
[1:25:23] just to help you Lord Jesus I want to do

[1:25:43] being by being a good person you got to
[1:25:45] the top and Rome by lying and cheating
[1:25:47] and doing everything you could to make
[1:25:49] it to the top you scratched and clothed

[1:26:09] can't I my mind won't allow me to think
[1:26:12] of what some of y'all have been through
[1:26:14] when it comes to tragedy with your
[1:26:15] families and I'm not trying to to work
[1:26:18] you up emotionally and thinking about
[1:26:19] that but it's just a fact it's just a
[1:26:21] reality
[1:26:22] but blessed are they that mourn
[1:26:25] those are the ones that are going up
[1:26:27] yeah
[1:26:28] yeah those are the ones that are rising
[1:26:30] in this Kingdom this is the way up how
[1:26:33] to win friends and influence people and
[1:26:34] the people of God be a spiritual beggar
[1:26:37] be a mourner
[1:26:40] blessed are the meek
[1:26:42] for they shall inherit the earth that
[1:26:43] word means those with self-control
[1:26:48] oh God help us today
[1:26:50] those with self-control
[1:26:52] those with Temperance is what is called
[1:26:54] in Peter that's what brother Graham says
[1:26:56] it's not it's not not drinking
[1:26:57] Temperance is self-control
[1:26:59] it's that word for Meek blessed are the
[1:27:02] ones with self-control blessed are they
[1:27:04] which do hunger and thirst after
[1:27:07] righteousness
[1:27:08] for they shall be filled are you hungry
[1:27:11] didn't you come to church hungry today
[1:27:13] is there something in your heart oh God
[1:27:15] I want righteous I want peace Lord I
[1:27:17] want righteousness I want I want my
[1:27:19] family to be right I want my I want

[1:27:23] God if you come hungry blessed are you

[1:27:28] thirst after righteousness for they
[1:27:30] shall be filled blessed are the merciful
[1:27:33] for they shall obtain Mercy again here
[1:27:36] pilate's ancestor had been merciful and
[1:27:38] it got executed for it so he had been
[1:27:41] taught that he couldn't be merciful
[1:27:44] God it only led to a downfall but now
[1:27:47] Jesus stood before him and Jesus would
[1:27:49] even give his own life out of Mercy
[1:27:52] God so loved the world that he gave his
[1:27:54] only begotten son that that as many
[1:27:56] believed on him will not perish but have
[1:27:57] eternal life don't you realize it was
[1:27:59] merciful he loved the world he loved
[1:28:02] those of his own and even those who were
[1:28:04] outside the economy of God we have a
[1:28:06] merciful god
[1:28:08] right many outside the economy of God
[1:28:10] will be saved because God's a merciful
[1:28:13] god
[1:28:14] because they they accept him in some way
[1:28:17] or they give a cup of cold water I had
[1:28:19] was a man drove up this morning
[1:28:21] to the church and I happen to be here
[1:28:23] and I was opening up the front door and
[1:28:25] he drove them to the the Portico out
[1:28:27] there and he had two bags of vegetables
[1:28:30] squash it looked really good squash and
[1:28:33] stuff like that and he dropped them off
[1:28:34] he said my neighbors don't want these he
[1:28:36] said I thought I'd give them to the
[1:28:37] church I guess he lives somewhere around
[1:28:39] here I said well you that'd be welcome I
[1:28:42] said we'll we'll take him and use them
[1:28:43] he said you want something next Sunday
[1:28:44] morning I said if you're coming by drop
[1:28:46] some more off
[1:28:49] and I thought of that when he said that
[1:28:51] because he may not ever do anything else
[1:28:52] he looked a little sketchy to be honest
[1:28:54] with me with you but but when he was
[1:28:56] walking out there I thought you know
[1:28:57] that may be the only thing he ever does
[1:28:58] but he gave a cup of cold water and when
[1:29:00] he did God will bless him for that he's
[1:29:02] a merciful god
[1:29:04] he's a merciful god
[1:29:06] and don't you think we ought to have an
[1:29:08] attitude that allows people to be
[1:29:10] merciful to us we ought to have an
[1:29:12] attitude that doesn't just run people
[1:29:13] off and get mad at people and get angry
[1:29:15] every time fly off the handle every time
[1:29:17] something goes wrong we need to be
[1:29:19] careful and you say Well they're not
[1:29:20] bright they may not be but they may be
[1:29:22] someone who needs Mercy
[1:29:25] they may be there because of your
[1:29:27] attitude towards them
[1:29:32] blessed are the pure in heart for they
[1:29:35] shall see God
[1:29:37] oh my don't you want heart Holiness not
[1:29:40] just that word Holiness but heart
[1:29:41] holiness
[1:29:43] blessed are the peacemakers for they
[1:29:45] shall be called the children of God
[1:29:47] peacemakers didn't do much in Rome
[1:29:50] Rome was a warrior Nation
[1:29:52] and he said blessed are the peacemakers
[1:29:55] blessed are they which are persecuted
[1:29:57] for righteousness sake for theirs is the
[1:30:01] kingdom of Heaven
[1:30:04] none of these things would get you ahead
[1:30:07] in Roman society
[1:30:10] the Bible says that in Luke 9 46 that
[1:30:13] the disciples again would begin to
[1:30:15] reason among themselves which of them
[1:30:17] should be greatest
[1:30:19] and Jesus perceiving the thought of
[1:30:21] their heart took a child and set him by
[1:30:24] him and said unto him whatsoever
[1:30:27] whosoever shall receive this child in my
[1:30:30] name receiveth me
[1:30:32] and whosoever shall receive me receiveth
[1:30:35] him that sent me
[1:30:36] for he that is least among you all the
[1:30:39] same shall be great
[1:30:41] verse 49 of John answered this don't you
[1:30:45] see this influence of this other Kingdom
[1:30:46] on the disciples
[1:30:48] John comes down and says Master we saw
[1:30:51] one casting out devils in thy name and
[1:30:53] we forbade him because he followed not
[1:30:55] with us
[1:30:56] we're going to earn some brownie points
[1:31:00] Master right after he showed him the
[1:31:02] example of a little child yeah
[1:31:05] Master won't tell you a story well I
[1:31:07] went down to that other church and I
[1:31:08] told them what for yeah
[1:31:10] yeah I told them they weren't in the
[1:31:12] message they don't do stuff like we do
[1:31:14] it yeah
[1:31:17] yeah fussing and fighting and carrying
[1:31:19] on they were casting out devils in my
[1:31:21] name they claimed to believe the message
[1:31:22] and they weren't doing anything like
[1:31:24] what we do
[1:31:26] they weren't with us they weren't of our
[1:31:28] tribe they weren't following and you
[1:31:29] would think that any sincere person
[1:31:31] casting out Devils the name of Jesus
[1:31:33] would have followed Jesus
[1:31:35] you'd have thought that they would but
[1:31:37] Jesus doesn't question their motives
[1:31:40] why because he was teaching a lesson to
[1:31:42] the disciples
[1:31:44] and he said unto them he said uh he said
[1:31:47] Jesus said unto him forbid him not for
[1:31:50] he that is not against us is for us
[1:31:54] hey
[1:31:55] that's why we don't go out trying to
[1:31:57] make enemies
[1:31:59] I don't walk around trying to make
[1:32:02] enemies that's not our job to make
[1:32:04] enemies our job is to preach the gospel
[1:32:09] forbid him not he is not against us as
[1:32:11] far as verse 51 that came to pass when
[1:32:12] the time was come he should be received
[1:32:14] up he steadfastly set his face to go to
[1:32:16] Jerusalem and he sent messages before
[1:32:18] his face and they went and entered into
[1:32:20] a village of the Samaritans to make
[1:32:21] ready for him yeah and they did not
[1:32:23] receive him because his face as though
[1:32:25] he would go to Jerusalem
[1:32:27] so the Samaritans had a party spirit
[1:32:29] because he was going up to the festival
[1:32:31] he told him I said well if you're going
[1:32:33] to that meeting you can't come to ours
[1:32:38] let's bring it on home
[1:32:41] you go to that meeting you know why what
[1:32:42] are you doing over here at our meeting
[1:32:44] we don't want you down here and they did
[1:32:47] not receive him because his face was so
[1:32:49] he would go to Jerusalem and when his
[1:32:50] disciples James and John saw this well
[1:32:53] they don't learn very quick do they
[1:32:55] they said Lord we'll thou that we
[1:32:58] command fire
[1:32:59] to come down from heaven
[1:33:02] him even as Elias did
[1:33:06] oh the the innocence of Youth you know
[1:33:09] did you think that through James and
[1:33:11] John
[1:33:13] did you think that through you're going
[1:33:15] to kill innocent children you're going
[1:33:17] to kill you're going to destroy people
[1:33:20] because they didn't treat you right
[1:33:24] oh my
[1:33:25] he turned and rebuked them
[1:33:28] and said you know not what manner of
[1:33:30] spirit you are of
[1:33:32] you see you're operating under the
[1:33:33] influence of the Kingdom but not the
[1:33:36] kingdom of God
[1:33:37] this would be a different kind of
[1:33:38] Kingdom I'm hurrying as we get close to
[1:33:40] the end now they were so used to the
[1:33:42] other Kingdom he had to speak to them in
[1:33:44] Parables he said the kingdom of heaven
[1:33:45] was like a mustard seed in Matthew 13 31
[1:33:48] he said that the least become the
[1:33:50] greatest but also by the Bible says folk
[1:33:52] of the false church because the roots
[1:33:54] would come down when it become great
[1:33:55] then the birds nested in it yeah
[1:33:58] the Kingdom of Heaven he said it was
[1:33:59] like 11 in Matthew 13 33 the kingdom of
[1:34:02] heaven was like treasure hidden a field
[1:34:04] it's a strange Kingdom
[1:34:06] the Kingdom of Heaven is like a merchant
[1:34:08] seeking goodly pearls the Kingdom of
[1:34:10] Heaven is like a net cast into the sea
[1:34:12] so he's telling them there's good and
[1:34:13] bad
[1:34:15] right there's good and bad there's some
[1:34:17] people you have to you'll go to church
[1:34:19] with that may not be seed of God there's
[1:34:21] others that are real true blue but
[1:34:23] you'll you'll congregate together and
[1:34:25] love one another
[1:34:26] and care there will always be two Vines
[1:34:29] he said don't wait until the end the
[1:34:31] tares will be there till the end
[1:34:34] and not everybody in Word of Life
[1:34:36] Tabernacles going into Rapture I'm sorry
[1:34:37] to say that my prayer is that everybody
[1:34:39] would my faith is that everybody would
[1:34:41] but the chances are not everybody will
[1:34:45] but I'll say this I want you all to go
[1:34:47] I'm gonna do my very best that you all
[1:34:49] would go
[1:34:51] because I'm going
[1:34:53] all right and that's the attitude we all
[1:34:55] want to have I'm going yeah I'm one of
[1:34:58] those that's going but the Kingdom of
[1:35:00] Heaven is like a merchant seeking goodly
[1:35:01] pearls the kingdom of Heavens like a net
[1:35:03] cast into the sea it gathers everything
[1:35:05] yeah
[1:35:06] but the lobsters crawl back and the
[1:35:08] Crawfish crawl back
[1:35:10] and the and the lobsters and everything
[1:35:12] else crawl back all the other things
[1:35:14] that are there all the crabs and
[1:35:15] everything else but there's some fish in
[1:35:17] there too and the fish are kept by the
[1:35:19] fishermen
[1:35:21] amen
[1:35:22] Matthew 13 51 Jesus gets done with all
[1:35:25] that and he says have you understood all
[1:35:27] these things
[1:35:28] they said yes sir
[1:35:31] it was like the people standing there by
[1:35:33] the island when he preached when he
[1:35:35] preached future home they said yes 1500
[1:35:37] miles this way that's 1500 miles from
[1:35:39] Jeffersonville and
[1:35:41] foreign
[1:35:42] people are so carnal sometimes yeah yeah
[1:35:44] we get so carnal sometimes so did you
[1:35:47] understand what I told you
[1:35:49] they said oh yeah we understand
[1:35:52] he said unto them therefore
[1:35:54] they didn't understand
[1:35:56] but he told him he said therefore every
[1:35:58] scribe which is instructed under the
[1:36:00] Kingdom of Heaven it's like unto a man
[1:36:03] that is a householder which bringeth
[1:36:05] forth out of his treasure things new and
[1:36:08] old
[1:36:09] so oh my that that's that's where we're
[1:36:12] at today a householder the kingdom of
[1:36:14] God here we have a message here we have
[1:36:17] and we're we've got within us we're a
[1:36:19] householder brother Steward every one of
[1:36:21] us are we have the ability to bring out
[1:36:23] new things and old things that will
[1:36:25] benefit us that will help us you know
[1:36:27] when someone would come to a
[1:36:28] householder's house and he'd want to
[1:36:30] show them oh this is my new chair here's
[1:36:32] here's my new fireplace you like the way
[1:36:35] that we did it if you hadn't been to
[1:36:36] somebody's house in a while or if you
[1:36:37] hadn't been somewhere to church they
[1:36:39] would show you all around and show you
[1:36:40] what the church was like show you what
[1:36:42] the house was like and that's what we do
[1:36:43] with the kingdom of God do you not know
[1:36:45] about faith I'll show you Faith do you

[1:37:02] wedding fee I don't have time to go into
[1:37:03] all this today maybe we'll get to it at
[1:37:04] some point
[1:37:06] in a future date
[1:37:08] then he set his face to go to Jerusalem
[1:37:11] and they thought surely in Jerusalem
[1:37:13] they would crown him a king
[1:37:16] this is it boys
[1:37:18] gonna get rich
[1:37:22] make some money now
[1:37:24] we're going to be the biggest group of
[1:37:26] them all
[1:37:28] and Jesus didn't go to Jerusalem
[1:37:31] to wear a crown of gold
[1:37:33] he went to Jerusalem to wear a crown of
[1:37:35] thorns
[1:37:39] the Bible says for the joy that was set
[1:37:41] before him
[1:37:42] because in this Kingdom this kingdom is
[1:37:44] a kingdom not a kingdom of instant
[1:37:46] gratification but a kingdom of delayed
[1:37:48] pleasure
[1:37:50] a kingdom of delayed Joy there's more on
[1:37:52] the other side than there is here
[1:37:54] brother Bill that's why I said blessed
[1:37:56] in the sight of the Lord is the death of
[1:37:58] his Saints why because you realize they
[1:38:00] got more over there than they do here
[1:38:02] that we live for another world don't get
[1:38:04] caught up in this world
[1:38:06] don't let it take over your mentality
[1:38:08] your idea the way you treat people
[1:38:10] there's another world out there much
[1:38:12] more real than this world
[1:38:18] no Kingdom of this Earth
[1:38:21] started by a king who hands himself over
[1:38:24] to the enemy
[1:38:26] to be executed
[1:38:28] but this one did
[1:38:31] you see the culture of this kingdom is
[1:38:33] sacrificed it's a kingdom of lambs but
[1:38:35] the premium says God is a holy God when
[1:38:38] a man is born of the Holy Spirit he's a
[1:38:39] candidate he's not only that but he's a
[1:38:41] king he's a prince he's from another
[1:38:43] Nation his kingdom is above he's filled
[1:38:46] with God's power God's presence the
[1:38:48] woman that does that puts on clothes the
[1:38:50] man lives decent and true to his wife
[1:38:51] the wife lives true and decent to the
[1:38:53] husband why they're influenced by the
[1:38:55] kingdom of heaven
[1:38:57] they want nothing of the world their
[1:38:58] affections are set on things above
[1:39:00] they're finished with the things of the
[1:39:01] world how many say I'm finished with the
[1:39:03] things of the world they're new
[1:39:04] creatures in Christ they're holy live it
[1:39:06] not them holy he said but the Holy
[1:39:08] Spirit governs them they don't have
[1:39:10] their own mind the holy spirit moves in
[1:39:12] them that's the reason they act crazy to
[1:39:14] the people of the world because they've
[1:39:16] moved by a spirit of another kingdom why
[1:39:18] do you do what you do why do you come to
[1:39:20] the house of God on a Sunday morning and
[1:39:22] sit and listen to the word you're moved
[1:39:24] by a spirit from another kingdom
[1:39:27] oh that's good hey man A lot of times
[1:39:30] women say to me brother Branham it's my
[1:39:32] American privilege if I want to dress
[1:39:33] the way I want to dress that's right men
[1:39:35] say if I want to take a sociable drink
[1:39:36] they sell it out there there's no law
[1:39:38] against it that's my American privilege
[1:39:39] that's right but as a Christian you'll
[1:39:41] forfeit your American rights if you're a
[1:39:43] lamb if you're a goat you won't but if
[1:39:45] you're a lamb you'll forfeit your rights
[1:39:46] because you're of another kingdom
[1:39:49] the dove is leaving you oh don't you
[1:39:51] want him leaving you today
[1:39:53] amen
[1:39:55] he said we don't tell them they have to
[1:39:56] do it
[1:39:57] we just give him the pattern
[1:40:00] tell them what the Bible says oh my and
[1:40:02] if they're born of a Heavenly Spirit
[1:40:04] then their spirit is no more
[1:40:05] Americanized it's no more germanized
[1:40:07] it's Heavenly eyes we're the kingdom of
[1:40:09] God because we're in another kingdom a
[1:40:11] kingdom of God we're decency Holiness
[1:40:13] and power exist
[1:40:15] we have access to our King how many
[1:40:17] believe that today we have access to our
[1:40:19] King we have an interview with him
[1:40:21] whenever we want to call upon him we
[1:40:24] have no other intercessors no other
[1:40:25] mediator between the king and us but
[1:40:27] that one man Christ Jesus
[1:40:29] pilate needed a a patron he needed
[1:40:32] somebody that's the way Roman society
[1:40:34] worked literally if you wanted an
[1:40:35] appointment in the military you had to
[1:40:37] go to a great man's house and just sit
[1:40:39] there yeah and wait on him take notice
[1:40:41] of you but that's not the way the
[1:40:43] kingdom of God works
[1:40:45] he took notice of us before the
[1:40:47] foundation of the world
[1:40:48] and we are not subject to the whims of
[1:40:51] some ruler here in the Earth but there's
[1:40:53] one mediator between God and man the man
[1:40:55] Christ Jesus
[1:40:57] no one else put us in no one else can
[1:40:59] take us out
[1:41:01] we are living in a kingdom
[1:41:03] it's called in the chronology of the
[1:41:04] Bible the Messianic Kingdom in other
[1:41:07] words were the Messiah rules in every
[1:41:08] life in his Dominion ruling the lives of
[1:41:11] his people called out people from every
[1:41:12] Walk of Life Gathering them together in
[1:41:14] a group and calls it his church his
[1:41:17] called out ones
[1:41:18] he says again that's what makes it so
[1:41:19] much different to the world you're from
[1:41:21] above you're born how many how many are
[1:41:23] born again today you're born you're a
[1:41:25] citizen of another kingdom you believe
[1:41:26] it that's what the Holy Ghost is to make
[1:41:28] you a citizen of the kingdom of God and
[1:41:31] if you're a citizen of the kingdom of
[1:41:32] God how does it make you act like God
[1:41:34] does in his kingdom he said now what
[1:41:36] does God do in his kingdom it's Holiness
[1:41:37] righteousness purity of thought purity
[1:41:40] of mind power and love amen going to the
[1:41:43] Lost Healing The Sick performing
[1:41:45] Miracles doing great things then to the
[1:41:47] world you look crazy and they say them
[1:41:49] guys are off at their head but you're a
[1:41:51] citizen of the Kingdom
[1:41:52] hey man what is it it's a kingdom of
[1:41:54] lambs
[1:41:57] it's a kingdom of lands what'd he say
[1:41:59] fear not little flock
[1:42:00] fear not little flock it is your
[1:42:03] father's good pleasure to give you the
[1:42:05] kingdom
[1:42:07] you must come into the kingdom as a lamb
[1:42:09] the only way Jesus could take on his
[1:42:12] kingship the only way he could take on
[1:42:14] his authority is by going to Calvary
[1:42:16] he had to become a lamb in order to
[1:42:19] become a lion
[1:42:20] when John signed he say he saw the lion
[1:42:22] of the tree he said the lion of the
[1:42:23] tribe of Judah have prevailed and he
[1:42:25] looked for a lion but he saw a lamb a
[1:42:28] lamb is it had been slain why was it a
[1:42:30] sacrificial lamb is the entrance to the
[1:42:32] kingdom he said I'm the door of the
[1:42:33] Sheepfold don't you realize you are a
[1:42:35] little flock you're sheep you're Lambs
[1:42:38] and it is God's good pleasure it is your
[1:42:41] father's good pleasure to give you the
[1:42:43] kingdom as a lamb
[1:42:46] oh my
[1:42:49] God imagine what it must have been like
[1:42:51] the representative of Rome yeah
[1:42:54] standing
[1:42:56] oh my
[1:42:57] with his Regal robes on him
[1:43:00] his white toga his tunic
[1:43:04] standing there it would be so clean that
[1:43:07] someone could be killed for stepping on
[1:43:09] it
[1:43:11] he had not touched an unclean person he
[1:43:14] was shaved he was hair was cut
[1:43:16] he was standing there a representative
[1:43:18] of Roman power and Roman Authority yeah
[1:43:22] standing there with all of his might
[1:43:25] with the symbols of Rome behind him the
[1:43:27] great the great lines of Rome the great
[1:43:29] Eagles Insignia of Rome
[1:43:31] behind him
[1:43:34] and they dragged a little man
[1:43:36] in front of him that didn't look like a
[1:43:38] leader so brother Brandon said about him
[1:43:40] they didn't look like a leader they
[1:43:42] dragged him in front of him and he had
[1:43:44] been beaten he'd been up all night
[1:43:46] as they dragged him from trial to trial
[1:43:48] six different trials that they dragged
[1:43:50] him to
[1:43:52] in 24 hours they dragged him to the to
[1:43:54] the trials and they began to beat him
[1:43:55] and they begin to do all those things to
[1:43:57] him and they brought him before Pilate
[1:44:00] standing there bleeding
[1:44:02] standing there quiet
[1:44:04] and the representative of Rome
[1:44:07] says are you a king
[1:44:10] are you a king
[1:44:13] he said you're testifying that
[1:44:16] oh my
[1:44:18] God they stood and faced one another
[1:44:20] pilate knowing that he would be recalled
[1:44:23] to Rome and lose his authority if the
[1:44:25] Jews rioted again
[1:44:27] three times while he was there the the
[1:44:30] Jews rioted
[1:44:31] and when they would Riot they would
[1:44:33] actually they would actually send
[1:44:35] letters because he had superiors in
[1:44:37] Syria that would send letters back to
[1:44:40] Rome and they would say pilate's not
[1:44:42] doing a good job and pilate had worked
[1:44:44] all of his life
[1:44:45] to reach this point he'd been Governor
[1:44:47] now for three or four or five or six
[1:44:49] years he'd been Governor he was only
[1:44:52] governor for 10 years but that's
[1:44:53] actually a long time by Governor
[1:44:55] standards but he had done everything
[1:44:57] that he could do
[1:44:58] to remain in power so when he got back
[1:45:01] to Rome he could have a great estate a
[1:45:03] great retirement
[1:45:05] he did everything that he could do to
[1:45:06] remain in power and he was not going to
[1:45:09] let this even though his life warned him
[1:45:10] even though he knew him being a heathen
[1:45:13] but he knew that Jesus wasn't guilty
[1:45:17] he had a decision to make
[1:45:19] all of his life he made decisions based
[1:45:21] on power what would he do now
[1:45:25] here he stood the representative of the
[1:45:27] Roman system the representative of the
[1:45:29] Kingdom of Heaven
[1:45:31] they stood facing one another
[1:45:33] that is still the case today yes
[1:45:36] brother Branham taught us that he said
[1:45:38] the crucial hour is here again
[1:45:41] what is it crucify them crucify him
[1:45:44] we can't all make them all methodists we
[1:45:46] can't make them all Baptists we can't
[1:45:47] make them all Oneness and make them all
[1:45:48] Trinity we can't make them all this out
[1:45:50] of the other but we can have a council
[1:45:51] or you disagree as far as the East is
[1:45:53] from the West the whole thing is wrong
[1:45:54] it's a satellite to Rome
[1:45:57] it's part of that it's why they operate
[1:45:59] the way that they do oh Church
[1:46:02] that's that system it's not the people
[1:46:04] it's not the people's good people in
[1:46:06] there but they're under a Roman system
[1:46:08] pilate was probably a pretty good guy
[1:46:10] deep down but he's been raised under
[1:46:12] this Roman system
[1:46:15] so now as an individual I'm going to ask
[1:46:16] you
[1:46:17] what will you do with this anointed word
[1:46:20] you stand in Pilot's Hall this morning
[1:46:22] you stand with the with with the choice
[1:46:25] to follow the word
[1:46:27] and to keep the word alive or to crucify
[1:46:30] the word
[1:46:31] every day we stand in those Straits
[1:46:34] as an individual he said I'm going to
[1:46:36] ask you what will you do with this
[1:46:37] anointed word which is the Christ the
[1:46:39] word that was promised for this day you
[1:46:41] as an individual pilate never got it off
[1:46:44] his hands you know that he screamed
[1:46:46] cried every scheme he could do he failed
[1:46:48] to do it
[1:46:49] pilate finally made a decision because
[1:46:52] the tumult of the people cried and
[1:46:53] crucified he wanted to let him go
[1:46:56] he wanted to get right with God yeah
[1:46:59] yeah but he waited yeah
[1:47:02] yeah he waited just a little bit too
[1:47:03] long
[1:47:04] he said crucify him
[1:47:06] I'll have another opportunity but he
[1:47:08] never would
[1:47:09] and the thing is he lost his governance
[1:47:12] over that
[1:47:13] he thought he'd prevent a riot and in
[1:47:15] just a few short years there was another
[1:47:16] Riot and he ended up back in Rome and
[1:47:18] then being exiled they believed to
[1:47:20] France
[1:47:21] and brother Branham said that there was
[1:47:22] still a pool that bubbled blue in
[1:47:24] Switzerland actually there's a mountain
[1:47:26] called palatis which is the mountain
[1:47:28] that uh that that they say that pilate
[1:47:30] died on and there's a pool of water that
[1:47:32] bubbles blue at a certain time of year
[1:47:34] or so the legend goes because that's
[1:47:36] where pilate committed suicide mother
[1:47:38] said he never could get the blood off
[1:47:40] his hands
[1:47:41] never could get it off his hands he
[1:47:43] couldn't even be a successful Governor
[1:47:45] why because he had chosen he had chosen
[1:47:47] the Roman system
[1:47:49] he never did get it off his hands he
[1:47:52] screamed and cried never scheme he could
[1:47:53] do but brother Brown said he is on your
[1:47:55] hands it works this time the Bible is
[1:47:58] preached the Holy Ghost has identified
[1:48:00] it any sinful man he said I Dare You To
[1:48:02] Say It Isn't So the Holy Ghost in these
[1:48:04] last days and the words that's been
[1:48:06] spoke said it would come to pass
[1:48:08] and here it is right before us don't try
[1:48:11] to do it he said don't let your end be
[1:48:13] like pilate he should have accepted him
[1:48:15] in his heart that's the only way you can
[1:48:17] get him off your hands is to take him in
[1:48:19] your heart
[1:48:21] oh my
[1:48:23] God all that is left
[1:48:25] a Pontius Pilate is a single Stone
[1:48:30] with his name on it
[1:48:32] that is all the physical evidence that
[1:48:35] they found of Pontius Pilate who had
[1:48:37] such great dreams is a single Stone
[1:48:42] to let us know he actually existed
[1:48:44] or let them know don't believe the word
[1:48:48] few small coins
[1:48:50] with this picture on them
[1:48:53] but the kingdom
[1:48:55] kingdom of God
[1:48:57] the kingdom of heaven
[1:49:01] he said what's left of Jesus Kingdom you
[1:49:04] are
[1:49:07] you are
[1:49:09] and one day we will crown him king of
[1:49:11] kings and Lord of lords there's coming a
[1:49:14] day when he will rise up in power and
[1:49:16] majesty and he'll and he'll rule with a
[1:49:18] rod of iron
[1:49:20] but on this Earth We're still Lambs
[1:49:22] we're still a kingdom of lambs
[1:49:25] we're still a kingdom that follows our
[1:49:28] King the kingdom of the wolf and the
[1:49:29] eagle is broken apart and gone if you go
[1:49:31] to Rome today and look at the Coliseum
[1:49:33] or look at the other buildings you'll
[1:49:35] find they're broken down
[1:49:36] and they're only a monument to what was
[1:49:40] if the Lord carries someday a miracle be
[1:49:42] in that same position yes we think we're
[1:49:44] so great we can stand behind this
[1:49:46] American System but if you look in the
[1:49:47] context of History we're a Young Nation
[1:49:50] and we're going down faster than other
[1:49:52] nations did this the end of this country
[1:49:55] is nothing but but but but debris and
[1:49:58] and smoke and Flame even the whole Earth
[1:50:01] itself will be burnt off the elements
[1:50:04] will melt with fervent heat that's the
[1:50:05] end of the world
[1:50:07] but the kingdom of the Lamb will be
[1:50:09] Eternal the kingdom of the Lamb is the
[1:50:11] same yesterday today and forever yes
[1:50:13] when the angel come to Mary as I'm
[1:50:15] closing musicians go ahead and come the
[1:50:17] angel come to Mary and he spoke to him
[1:50:19] and said his name will be called Jesus
[1:50:20] said he shall be great it shall be
[1:50:22] called the son of the highest the Lord
[1:50:24] God shall give unto him the Throne of
[1:50:26] his father David yeah and he shall reign
[1:50:29] over the house of Jacob forever and of
[1:50:31] his kingdom
[1:50:33] there shall be no end well I'm so glad I
[1:50:37] serve an eternal Kingdom they called
[1:50:39] Rome the Eternal City but Rome can't
[1:50:41] even keep its garbage picked up they
[1:50:42] call Rome the Eternal City but it's just
[1:50:45] a filthy place with all kinds of sin in
[1:50:47] it but there is a city amen that he's
[1:50:49] going to prepare for you and I there is
[1:50:51] a sea that'll settle down on this Earth
[1:50:53] one day and we're going to be a part of
[1:50:55] it we're going to be Kings and Priests
[1:50:56] amen
[1:50:59] Hallelujah
[1:51:01] what will you do with this Jesus called
[1:51:03] Christ what will you do with the two
[1:51:05] kingdoms what will you be influenced by
[1:51:07] Bow your head's with me
[1:51:10] what will you let your life be run by
[1:51:13] prejudice
[1:51:15] hate
[1:51:18] it's like for somebody
[1:51:20] a desire to get ahead
[1:51:23] doing everything you can to move up
[1:51:26] there's some admirable qualities to that
[1:51:28] when it comes to our American System
[1:51:31] getting ahead
[1:51:32] a man that doesn't work shouldn't eat
[1:51:36] it has to work
[1:51:38] and he has to Humble himself to be able
[1:51:41] to do that to work we shouldn't eat
[1:51:44] maybe people can't get ahead
[1:51:47] but many people find ways to it's a good
[1:51:50] thing it's a good thing to be a
[1:51:51] self-made man
[1:51:53] you can't do that in the Kingdom
[1:51:55] of the Kingdom of Heaven
[1:51:57] we don't even get to pick our field of
[1:51:59] service
[1:52:00] [Music]
[1:52:01] we don't
[1:52:03] we just do what the what he tells us we
[1:52:06] try to do it our own way we end up
[1:52:09] in trouble
[1:52:11] the king is merciful today
[1:52:14] aren't you glad he's a merciful King
[1:52:16] maybe you've not been as much a lamb as
[1:52:18] you should be I I know every every day I
[1:52:20] I talk to God say Lord make me a lamb
[1:52:23] make me a lamb it's easy to get caught
[1:52:25] up in yourself whatever ability that you
[1:52:27] have person doesn't have to have much
[1:52:29] ability to be extremely proud of it
[1:52:32] don't get caught up in that
[1:52:35] let your life be a surrender to God
[1:52:40] become a child of the Lamb
[1:52:42] still I don't understand the message I
[1:52:44] don't understand everything about it
[1:52:45] just surrender to the lamb
[1:52:47] let Christ the holy spirit in you guide
[1:52:49] you and lead you he will lead you into
[1:52:51] all truth
[1:52:53] let him work in your life would you do
[1:52:55] that this morning Heavenly Father
[1:52:58] Lord Jesus we pledge allegiance to you
[1:53:01] today
[1:53:02] oh God we want to be influenced by the
[1:53:05] kingdom of the Lamb
[1:53:07] not by the kingdom of Rome
[1:53:10] not by the kingdom represented by Pilate
[1:53:13] but the kingdom represented by you Lord
[1:53:16] oh God
[1:53:18] the Roman Emperor wouldn't come all the
[1:53:20] way to Jerusalem to project his power
