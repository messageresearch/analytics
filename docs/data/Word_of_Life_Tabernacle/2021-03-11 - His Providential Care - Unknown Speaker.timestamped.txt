[35:52] meet every need we're not depending on
[35:54] my strength or the strength of the

[36:01] be able
[36:02] to overcome every obstacle in our lives
[36:05] father i pray we've not found your mind
[36:08] lord and
[36:09] followed you completely i pray you

[36:13] lord jesus if there's anything lord
[36:15] between us
[36:16] god would you take it out today we want
[36:18] to worship you with
[36:19] all of our heart lord as brother stewart
[36:22] already pray lord that we
[36:23] get put all of our effort all of our
[36:25] heart into it
[36:26] lord you deserve so much more than what
[36:28] we could give
[36:30] or we couldn't repay you for what you've
[36:32] done for us but we could
[36:34] worship you with all our heart and all
[36:35] of our mind all of our strength and
[36:38] we thank you for that tonight lord i
[36:40] pray you to help us lord in each one of
[36:42] these situations lord these needs i
[36:45] i pray that you would just move in a
[36:47] supernatural way
[36:48] lord as only you can't and i believe
[36:50] that you will
[36:52] i pray you'd grant it now and that's the
[36:54] service tonight move me out of the way
[36:56] god
[36:57] speak to your people i i believe you
[36:59] still do that lord
[37:00] and so i pray you would do it tonight
[37:02] ask in jesus name
[37:04] amen amen and god bless you turn with me
[37:09] if you would to exodus chapter 3
[37:13] verses 7 and 8. it's good to be in the
[37:15] house of the lord tonight
[37:18] but john it's good to see you tonight
[37:20] good to have every one of you
[37:21] for the sam's good to see you on a
[37:22] wednesday night and it's always good to
[37:25] be in the house of the lord
[37:27] and i want to break away from our
[37:29] marriage series tonight to speak on his
[37:32] providential care
[37:34] and this is something that so you'll
[37:36] know i'm not preaching at you it's
[37:38] something i've actually preached before
[37:39] but
[37:40] but we do know that god has a way of
[37:43] speaking directly to our hearts doesn't
[37:44] he
[37:46] and i believe that he meant and
[37:49] intended for you to be here tonight
[37:52] and he intended for me to be here
[37:54] tonight and if he wanted us to be here
[37:57] and then
[37:58] arranged all of history for us to be at
[38:01] this moment
[38:02] then there has to be a reason for that
[38:05] and maybe sometimes we don't want to
[38:07] hear something but we still need to hear
[38:09] it and
[38:10] and that would be the case for every one
[38:12] of us tonight and
[38:13] i trust it'll be a blessing to you
[38:15] exodus chapter 3 and verse 7 keep
[38:17] us in your prayers we'll be uh headed
[38:19] out of town for a few days
[38:20] i'm going to a camp we're going to take
[38:23] peter to a youth camp and
[38:24] and i'm going to take my family up there
[38:26] and and spend a few days with brother
[38:28] wendell martin and them and
[38:30] and you just be praying for us and
[38:32] believe that the lord will
[38:34] help the young people there and i
[38:35] believe the lord will help you here but
[38:36] the steward will be preaching sunday
[38:38] morning
[38:39] and uh so i'm sure you'll be looking
[38:41] forward to that
[38:42] in exodus chapter 3 and verse 7 and the
[38:44] lord said
[38:45] i have surely seen the affliction of my
[38:47] people which are in egypt
[38:50] and i've heard their cry by reason of
[38:52] their taskmasters
[38:54] for i know their sorrows
[38:58] he says i know he didn't have to guess
[39:02] at it he knew
[39:03] he heard and then verse 8 and i am come
[39:06] down to deliver them out of the hand of
[39:08] the egyptians because
[39:10] he knew he cared and because he cared
[39:14] he came down amen
[39:17] to deliver them out of the hand of the
[39:19] egyptians and to bring them up out of
[39:21] that land
[39:21] into a good land in a large into a land
[39:24] flowing with milk and honey
[39:26] and to the place of the canaanites and
[39:28] the hittites and the amorites and the
[39:30] perizzites
[39:31] and the hivites and the jebusites i pray
[39:34] the lord would add his blessing to the
[39:35] word you may be seated this evening
[39:42] his providential care webster
[39:45] in 1828 defined providence
[39:49] as the act of providing or preparing for
[39:52] future use or application
[39:55] he said foresight timely care
[39:58] particular particularly active foresight
[40:01] foresight accompanied
[40:03] with the procurement of what is
[40:04] necessary for future use
[40:07] or with suitable preparation
[40:10] he says in theology the care and
[40:12] superintendence which god
[40:14] exercises over his creatures
[40:17] he that acknowledges the creation and
[40:19] denies the providence
[40:21] involves himself in a palpable
[40:23] contradiction
[40:24] from the same power which caused a thing
[40:26] to exist
[40:28] is necessary to continue its existence
[40:33] and so the idea of a god who could be
[40:35] powerful enough to make you and not
[40:37] powerful enough
[40:38] to provide for you every day in your
[40:41] life
[40:42] doesn't the two things don't mesh it
[40:44] doesn't line up
[40:46] there has to be he has to be able
[40:50] to provide for you and just treat this
[40:52] like it's sunday morning for a minute if
[40:54] you will
[40:55] i think everybody ought to come to
[40:57] church like it's sunday morning all the
[40:59] time
[41:00] it's just me you know we didn't come
[41:02] here to play church
[41:04] we don't come here to uh to just hear
[41:06] something nice and go home we come here
[41:08] to worship god
[41:09] and we believe that the one we worship
[41:11] is a real god
[41:13] he's a real god he's not somebody who
[41:15] can't intervene on our behalf he's not
[41:17] somebody who
[41:18] just sits back there and doesn't care he
[41:20] cares
[41:22] and he wants us to care as much as he
[41:25] cares
[41:28] now psalms 24 and 1 tells us that
[41:32] the earth is the lord's
[41:36] and the fullness thereof and that word
[41:38] fullness
[41:39] means the entire contents of the earth
[41:43] the earth if i would say this bottle of
[41:45] water is mine and the fullness thereof
[41:47] that means everything in it
[41:49] is mine the water is mine every molecule
[41:52] of it
[41:54] everything is mine the earth is the
[41:57] lord's and the entire
[41:59] contents thereof the world and they that
[42:02] dwell
[42:03] therein brother branham says this he
[42:06] said you were all
[42:07] pre-planned by god and that's hard for
[42:11] us to understand sometimes you go tell
[42:13] that
[42:13] to the to the israelites who had lived
[42:16] under 400 years
[42:18] however many of those years they were in
[42:20] bondage there in egypt after all those
[42:23] years of bondage try to tell them
[42:25] that god pre-planned it but he did the
[42:30] cup of iniquity of the amorites but sam
[42:32] had to fill up
[42:33] and i don't understand that why did he
[42:35] have to wait until
[42:36] hundreds had died thousands had been
[42:39] beaten and
[42:40] and cruelly with taskmasters and all
[42:42] that brother david how
[42:44] how why did he have to wait i don't i
[42:46] don't know i don't understand
[42:47] but god does
[42:51] god understands god knows exactly why
[42:54] we're in the situation that we are
[42:55] tonight
[42:56] whatever that situation is whatever
[42:59] condition you find yourself in in life
[43:01] god knows he knows if there's money in
[43:05] your bank account or lack thereof
[43:07] he knows and he cares if if you're
[43:09] having trouble in your relationship if
[43:11] you're having trouble
[43:13] with a church or whatever it is that
[43:15] you're having trouble with
[43:16] he knows god knows
[43:19] because if he didn't know he couldn't be
[43:21] god
[43:23] he just wouldn't exist as god he
[43:24] couldn't be all-knowing and not know
[43:26] and if he knows then he cares
[43:30] he says i know what you're going through
[43:32] he's and brother baby says you're all
[43:34] pre-planned by god nothing happens by
[43:36] chance with god
[43:37] he knows all about it it's all
[43:39] pre-planned planned for many generations
[43:41] back
[43:42] so that you could be here tonight
[43:46] so we could say that god provided
[43:49] you with the things you would need and
[43:52] he provided the earth with you
[43:56] right because we are not just blessed by
[43:59] the providence of god we are the
[44:01] providence of god
[44:04] have you ever thought about that god
[44:06] meant for us to be in the earth where we
[44:08] are
[44:09] he meant for us to be and go to church
[44:12] where we go to church
[44:13] he meant for us to be in the family that
[44:15] we're in
[44:17] and we wonder about that don't we god
[44:20] why would you put me in my family
[44:22] god bless you all you that are watching
[44:24] tonight man why would you put me in my
[44:26] family
[44:28] huh why would you make me the way i am
[44:30] there's a reason for that
[44:33] god intended for you to be exactly who
[44:36] you are
[44:39] do we really believe that tonight he
[44:42] puts you in a particular place
[44:44] not just to receive providence but to be
[44:47] providence to actually he actually
[44:50] hardened pharaoh's heart
[44:53] for the israelites sake amen
[44:56] god allows you to be there and even
[44:59] david went here
[45:00] was a man who was david was walking out
[45:02] of the city and a man started throwing
[45:04] stones at him and spitting on him
[45:06] and he said maybe the lord told him to
[45:07] do that
[45:09] god allowed it to happen listen if we
[45:12] really believe that god allows things to
[45:13] happen we wouldn't get so upset when it
[45:16] happens
[45:20] when it actually happens we get angry or
[45:23] somebody cuts us off on the road
[45:26] some we have a little problem with our
[45:27] spouse or somebody else and and we get
[45:30] angry think why
[45:30] why was i why did that have to happen to
[45:32] me brother robert why was why me
[45:34] but god allowed that to happen
[45:37] for a purpose and it's not fatalistic
[45:41] because he wants us to care
[45:43] he wants us to work he wants us to do
[45:45] but at the same time he had everything
[45:48] exactly where he wanted it to be look at
[45:49] the at the story of jonah
[45:51] jonah is running from god as hard as he
[45:53] can go a man running from the presence
[45:55] of the lord
[45:56] and god already knew he would run knew
[45:58] what the condition of his heart would be
[46:00] and used it for his own glory
[46:03] amen you think god is surprised by a
[46:05] situation with
[46:06] i'm just going to preach tonight you
[46:07] think god's surprised by a situation we
[46:10] find ourselves in
[46:11] he's suddenly worried about the world
[46:13] that we're in in 2021
[46:14] he suddenly doesn't understand he said
[46:16] well my pastor
[46:18] fears for my family's this or this is
[46:20] going on i don't understand no he
[46:21] he already knew about it he already
[46:24] understood exactly where you would be
[46:25] and why you would be and what you're
[46:27] doing here but he puts you here for a
[46:29] reason
[46:35] so you are both what god provided for
[46:37] and what he has provided
[46:40] matthew 6 25 says therefore i say unto
[46:44] you take no thought for your life that's
[46:45] to take no anxious
[46:47] thought take no anxious thought we were
[46:49] talking about this gabe on sunday take
[46:51] no anxious thought for your life
[46:53] don't worry about it what you shall eat
[46:56] or what you shall drink nor yet for your
[46:58] body what you shall put on
[47:00] it's not the life more than meat and the
[47:02] body than arraignment
[47:04] he's saying let him provide for you let
[47:06] him be that that one who cares for you
[47:09] he said behold the fowls of the air for
[47:11] they so
[47:12] not neither do they reap or gather into
[47:15] barns yet your heavenly father feedeth
[47:17] them
[47:18] are are you not much better than they
[47:20] notice the language that he uses he said
[47:22] are you not much
[47:24] better you are much better
[47:28] and so he he doesn't he's not saying
[47:31] that god's just going to feed you like
[47:33] he does the fouls of the air
[47:35] right he's not leaving you on that level
[47:38] he's moving you up with the jt into
[47:40] another level
[47:42] where he's you gonna he's gonna care for
[47:44] you in a way
[47:46] i want you to watch this because it's
[47:47] providential god doesn't care for
[47:49] everyone in the same way
[47:52] that's true i got you thinking but it's
[47:55] true
[47:58] he cares for egypt and israel
[47:59] differently
[48:02] right he cares for esau and jacob
[48:04] differently
[48:07] brothers but he cares differently
[48:10] right and we'll read it in a moment but
[48:13] god cares differently
[48:15] for different levels and so it's just
[48:16] like me i care
[48:18] differently i care for you because this
[48:20] is the church that god has called me to
[48:22] and i'm responsible for it i i have to
[48:25] be
[48:26] i'm responsible for that i'm not here to
[48:28] play church
[48:30] right we're not here to if i want to be
[48:32] a pastor i have to be a pastor
[48:34] i can't i can't just play church because
[48:36] i'm responsible
[48:38] and so i have a different level for you
[48:40] of care than i do for somebody else
[48:44] i let the church down the road do
[48:45] whatever they want to whoever that is
[48:47] they may do things better or worse but
[48:49] that's not my responsibility
[48:52] this is my responsibility this is your
[48:55] responsibility too
[48:57] just on a different level you understand
[48:59] so you wouldn't have the care
[49:01] the same level of care that i would but
[49:02] you still have a level of care
[49:04] for the church that you wouldn't for
[49:05] some other church
[49:08] that's right i have a level of care for
[49:10] my children
[49:12] that i don't necessarily have for your
[49:13] children and i love your children
[49:17] but i have a different level of care i
[49:18] have responsibility for my own
[49:21] i have a right to have a family you have
[49:23] a right to have a family
[49:25] god had a right to have a family
[49:28] and you're his family so he said how
[49:31] much
[49:32] more would he care for you how much
[49:34] better are ye
[49:36] than sparrows he's not just caring for
[49:38] you like he does the sparrow he does
[49:40] care for the sparrow
[49:41] he does know every time one falls to the
[49:44] earth
[49:45] but how much more amen
[49:49] how much more does he care for you than
[49:52] he does for the sparrows
[49:55] listen he said which of you by taking
[49:58] thought can add one cubit into his
[49:59] stature and
[50:00] he goes on to talk about these things
[50:02] but he's telling you you cannot
[50:05] provide in that way for yourself because
[50:08] you can't change who you are and if
[50:10] there is not
[50:11] a god who cares for you providentially
[50:14] then you have no way of changing your
[50:17] outcome
[50:19] in other words if god doesn't care
[50:22] you caring doesn't make a difference
[50:26] right unless he cares me caring doesn't
[50:30] make a difference
[50:31] i could shout i can stream if god
[50:33] doesn't care
[50:34] no matter how much i petition him how
[50:36] much i lay myself down to him
[50:38] then it doesn't matter but if he cares
[50:40] for me
[50:42] hey man i believe he does tonight church
[50:44] i believe he cares for each and every
[50:46] one of us
[50:47] then if he cares for me then he watches
[50:49] he sees every time i fall to my knees
[50:52] he sees every time i cry out to him he
[50:54] sees every
[50:55] stress that i go through every problem
[50:57] that i have every time i get in trouble
[50:59] he sees all of it and he knows when i'm
[51:01] sick he knows what i'm hurting he knows
[51:03] everything about me because he cares
[51:08] for me and then so my
[51:11] caring can have an effect
[51:14] because he cares listen
[51:19] malachi 1 2 says i have loved you saith
[51:21] the lord
[51:23] yet you say wherein hastel loved us
[51:26] the children of israel in egypt might
[51:27] have said that where what good does it
[51:29] do
[51:31] to be the elect the jews down through
[51:34] history have kind of made a joke out of
[51:35] it that
[51:36] we're the elect of god that means we
[51:37] suffer like no one else it means we're
[51:40] persecuted like no one else
[51:42] what are the benefits of being the elect
[51:45] well the benefit is the way he
[51:47] cares for you and it doesn't mean that
[51:50] he's just gonna make everything easy for
[51:52] you
[51:53] listen church we're living in the
[51:54] smallest amount of time
[51:56] eternity is so much so much more than
[51:59] what we have here
[52:02] if he has to put us through a time here
[52:03] to get us ready for eternity
[52:05] if he has to put us through a hard
[52:07] hardship here to get us ready for over
[52:09] there he'll do what it takes he's not
[52:11] afraid
[52:12] he's not going back down why he'll allow
[52:14] things to come into your life
[52:15] sickness or something else to come in
[52:17] you say why did i have to go through
[52:18] that
[52:19] well you did because he cares
[52:22] and he cares for you in a way that is
[52:24] not just
[52:25] caring about your life here but about
[52:27] your life beyond the grave
[52:32] this is the smallest part we get focused
[52:34] on temporary things
[52:35] so much until until we're consumed with
[52:37] him but this is the smallest part
[52:40] he cares enough to send exactly what we
[52:43] need
[52:44] malachi 1 3 he says i love jacob in
[52:47] verse 2 and he says
[52:49] i hated esau in verse 3. how did he hate
[52:52] esau brother branham talks about that
[52:55] he loves him less in the sense that it's
[52:57] not a hate like we would have like we'd
[52:59] hold a grudge against him
[53:01] but he hates him in the sense that there
[53:02] was such a divide
[53:04] between the way he cared for jacob and
[53:06] the way he cared for esau
[53:09] right god set up the events that
[53:12] even when jacob was a shyster
[53:16] even when he went think about this the
[53:20] providence of god
[53:22] allowed esau to go out hunting one day
[53:25] and the day to be a certain temperature
[53:28] and the game to run a certain distance
[53:30] and everything to happen in such a way
[53:32] so that esau would get
[53:34] hungry because jacob had to have the
[53:37] birthright
[53:40] so the providence of god knowing jacob
[53:42] would be a shyster
[53:43] knowing who he would be and it didn't
[53:44] make it right but god still provided for
[53:47] him
[53:50] so the providence worked in esau's life
[53:52] in what you would say it's a negative
[53:54] way
[53:54] and that's why he says i hated esau laid
[53:57] his mountains in his heritage waste for
[53:58] the dragons of the wilderness
[54:00] i let him i let him do things that i
[54:02] would never let jacob do
[54:07] are you with me now i i treated him in a
[54:10] way i would never treat jacob but i
[54:12] treated jacob in a way that i would
[54:13] never treat him
[54:15] you see they could not figure out god's
[54:17] love
[54:19] they thought that love meant no
[54:20] suffering they thought that love meant a
[54:22] baby with parental care
[54:24] but god said that his love was elective
[54:28] love
[54:30] now watch he said the proof of his love
[54:32] is election
[54:34] and no matter what happened his love was
[54:36] proven truly by the fact that they were
[54:39] chosen
[54:40] unto salvation
[54:43] but now because he chose you he doesn't
[54:46] stop there
[54:47] as an impersonal god who chose you and
[54:49] then leaves you
[54:51] but he continues to care for you
[54:54] right and so brother brown said he cared
[54:57] for his elected people
[54:59] in the days of the destruction of egypt
[55:02] it's that next slide he cared for his
[55:04] elected people in the days of the
[55:05] destruction of egypt
[55:06] they was down there in egypt and become
[55:08] slaves now again
[55:09] they were down there for years and if
[55:12] you'd have asked them how do you care
[55:14] how does he care for us remember
[55:15] when they first heard the message things
[55:17] got worse
[55:21] many times when you start trying to do
[55:22] something for god when the church starts
[55:24] turning the right direction
[55:25] the devil gets mad things start getting
[55:28] worse
[55:29] for a while it's going to because
[55:32] because and so they they hear the
[55:34] message and immediately it just causes
[55:36] them hardships they got to make bricks
[55:37] without straw
[55:38] immediately they got problems huh why
[55:42] because he cared
[55:46] he said well if he cared i'd have money
[55:47] in the bank account not necessarily
[55:50] if he cared he would he would have i'd
[55:52] have a good job not necessarily
[55:57] it's because he cares that you are where
[56:00] you're at
[56:00] now whether that's to wake you up
[56:08] and make something out of your life
[56:13] they needed to be there for that long
[56:15] for a reason
[56:16] and the cup of the iniquity of the
[56:18] emirates had to be full god had his own
[56:20] purposes all along
[56:21] but there had to be they had to reach a
[56:23] place
[56:24] to where amram and yokabad were down
[56:26] there praying all night
[56:30] brother brown tells the story and how
[56:32] that they had to want
[56:33] a deliverer they had to care god had to
[56:37] bring them to a state of care to where
[56:39] they cared
[56:41] enough to be delivered realize church
[56:44] that many times that's what god's doing
[56:45] in our life is he's actually bringing us
[56:48] to a place
[56:48] where we care enough to be delivered
[56:53] where we don't come to church the way we
[56:55] always came to church
[56:57] we don't just sit like we always said
[56:59] but we care enough
[57:03] god help us tonight to be delivered from
[57:05] our present condition
[57:08] to be what god wants us to be
[57:12] i watch people and then excuse me but
[57:15] they get in the worst messes of life
[57:18] and then they pity themselves say well
[57:19] god doesn't care about me
[57:22] and so they become more like they are
[57:25] and if they were halfway christians they
[57:27] become more like that
[57:30] see if that got you into that place it's
[57:33] not going to get you out of it
[57:36] god brought you to that place because he
[57:38] wants you to care he wants to create in
[57:40] your care
[57:41] don't you see that tonight church he
[57:43] wants us to care
[57:44] i've noticed that it's in my days of
[57:46] desperation i've noticed this for years
[57:48] when i really begin to get down to
[57:50] business with god there's something i
[57:51] don't understand
[57:52] that's when god really anoints me that's
[57:54] when god moves in my life
[57:56] because he he wants me to care
[57:59] and so it allows things to happen so
[58:01] that i'll care and it's not that i don't
[58:03] care at the other times but that needs
[58:04] to be a desperation in my life
[58:10] so brother mayor said he cared for his
[58:12] elected people in the days of moses he
[58:14] cared for the people he sent them what
[58:16] a prophet amen
[58:20] he said is that right and he separated
[58:22] his people from the unbelieving world
[58:24] from the coming judgment of that day
[58:28] he said well he hadn't done nothing for
[58:30] me lately wait a minute
[58:32] did you hear the same message i heard
[58:38] what did it mean to you
[58:42] was it just a man talking out there
[58:44] somewhere
[58:45] was it just another preacher when the
[58:48] going got rough did you give up on it
[58:50] or was it a call to your heart and your
[58:53] soul
[58:54] that that showed you that god cared so
[58:57] much
[58:57] that he wanted to deliver you out of
[58:59] denominationalism
[59:01] he wanted to separate you from those who
[59:02] would go down with the mark of the beast
[59:05] he wanted to make a difference and
[59:06] establish a connection where he could
[59:08] say
[59:09] i loved him so much it was just if i
[59:11] hated the others
[59:16] amen said did he do it he cared when
[59:19] egypt had heaped their sins so high
[59:21] until god had to send judgment because
[59:24] he had already told abraham
[59:26] and i will deal with that nation
[59:29] so instead of pouring out his wrath upon
[59:31] all of them he sent his care to them
[59:35] he sent his comforter to them he sent
[59:38] his word to them
[59:40] he cares he wants you to care
[59:44] he wants me to care but he already cares
[59:49] he cared enough to send his word that
[59:52] would separate us
[59:53] from the world not just in how we dress
[59:57] or how we look or how we have church but
[59:59] it would separate us
[1:00:02] in judgment so that we would be judged
[1:00:05] here
[1:00:06] we would not be judged over there
[1:00:10] so he deals in many ways more strictly
[1:00:12] with us here because we're his children
[1:00:17] amen so we receive correction
[1:00:21] so he sent his word to them deuteronomy
[1:00:23] 11 and 10 and i've read this to you
[1:00:25] before it's one of my
[1:00:27] my favorite old testament scriptures
[1:00:28] because it's just such an example of the
[1:00:30] difference between egypt
[1:00:32] and canaan but he said for the land
[1:00:34] whither thou goest and to possess it as
[1:00:36] not as the land of egypt from which you
[1:00:38] come out
[1:00:39] without soweth thy seed and water spit
[1:00:40] with thy foot as a garden of herbs
[1:00:43] so he's telling them he said there's a
[1:00:45] land of providence
[1:00:47] and it's better than a man-made system
[1:00:51] can i go a little bit farther and say
[1:00:52] the land of providence is better than my
[1:00:54] man-made system
[1:00:56] or yours whatever your
[1:00:59] your idea of what your life should be
[1:01:02] his
[1:01:02] land of providence is better
[1:01:06] than your man-made system
[1:01:09] right your plan the land that you go to
[1:01:12] possess is the land
[1:01:13] he says of hills and valleys right we've
[1:01:16] talked about that before it drinketh
[1:01:18] water
[1:01:18] the rain of heaven so if there's no rain
[1:01:21] it's dry
[1:01:22] it depends dependent on the ring
[1:01:26] where egypt was a society that had built
[1:01:29] the greatest civilization in the world
[1:01:31] based on a man-made
[1:01:32] system that would water the
[1:01:36] the crops whether there was rain or not
[1:01:39] that would create an oasis in the desert
[1:01:42] so that the people would always have
[1:01:44] water
[1:01:44] to protect against times like we hear
[1:01:46] about in joseph where there was a famine
[1:01:48] in the land
[1:01:50] but they protected against that by
[1:01:51] building canals and building
[1:01:53] all these these waterways so that they
[1:01:55] could irrigate the land
[1:01:58] and so they weren't dependent you know i
[1:02:01] found that
[1:02:02] when we lived in pigott that and the
[1:02:05] stewart could correct me i may be wrong
[1:02:06] about this but
[1:02:07] the way i understood it that the farmers
[1:02:09] down there
[1:02:10] the worst thing they could have is too
[1:02:12] much rain because
[1:02:14] in the ground you know soggy and stuff
[1:02:16] it cost them more money if it got real
[1:02:18] dry but they still watered the crops
[1:02:21] the crops didn't go without water
[1:02:23] because you're pumping water out of all
[1:02:25] the drainage canals and out of the
[1:02:26] mississippi river whatever that it is
[1:02:28] the water the crops are always going to
[1:02:30] get water it's a man-made system
[1:02:33] but this land they would go to is a land
[1:02:34] where they would be dependent on the
[1:02:36] reign of heaven
[1:02:38] so he says in verse 12 he said it's a
[1:02:40] land which the lord thy god
[1:02:43] careth for
[1:02:48] amen he cares for
[1:02:51] the land
[1:02:55] he cares for our land today the promises
[1:02:58] he cares
[1:02:59] he keeps the promises watered in our
[1:03:02] life
[1:03:03] as long as we care right
[1:03:07] that's that's what a prophet of god
[1:03:09] taught us now he said for the eyes of
[1:03:11] the lord thy god are always upon it
[1:03:13] from the beginning of the year even
[1:03:16] until the end
[1:03:17] of the year his eyes are always
[1:03:21] upon it and what does that mean what
[1:03:23] does that care mean and it shall come to
[1:03:24] pass if you shall hearken diligently
[1:03:27] if you hearken diligently unto my
[1:03:29] commandments see this thing's just not
[1:03:30] automatic
[1:03:32] there's not a district presbyter
[1:03:34] somewhere turning on the spigot
[1:03:40] there's something that we've got to do
[1:03:41] we've got to be ready to have church we
[1:03:44] got to be ready to worship god
[1:03:47] we're not waiting on somebody to send us
[1:03:49] excuse me a message at a certain time
[1:03:51] and we just sit here and receive it
[1:03:54] but i'm waiting to hear from god what's
[1:03:56] my job what's brother stewart's job with
[1:03:57] aaron's job what is their job is to
[1:04:01] it's to wait on god and we prepare
[1:04:05] but we prepare according to that
[1:04:07] inspiration that we get
[1:04:09] believing that god has given that to us
[1:04:11] for a reason
[1:04:13] you don't take that lightly you don't
[1:04:16] take that half harley's diligently
[1:04:17] we hearken diligently to to hear from
[1:04:19] god because we believe that god has a
[1:04:21] better idea
[1:04:22] of how to care for the people then some
[1:04:25] sermon on youtube
[1:04:27] some sermon somewhere else god has a
[1:04:29] better idea
[1:04:30] so we look into the word we don't look
[1:04:32] to man's opinion we look to the word
[1:04:33] because god knows how to give us exactly
[1:04:36] what we have need of
[1:04:40] excuse me tonight i'm getting a little
[1:04:41] bit
[1:04:43] but you just you just pray for me i
[1:04:46] i want to see god move i believe we've
[1:04:49] seen god move
[1:04:51] but there's always more listen if we
[1:04:54] step back
[1:04:55] if we push back if we let ourselves be
[1:04:57] pushed back by the world
[1:04:58] and just become like everybody else and
[1:05:00] just drift along with the time
[1:05:02] anything goes it don't matter whether
[1:05:03] you come to church or not it doesn't
[1:05:04] matter whether you
[1:05:05] whether you believe the word or not what
[1:05:07] do you do what a prophet said don't
[1:05:08] matter anymore
[1:05:09] if you get to that place you'll have the
[1:05:11] same results that everybody else does
[1:05:13] when they go to that place
[1:05:15] because this is a land that relies on
[1:05:17] rain from heaven
[1:05:18] and so what did he say he said i will
[1:05:20] give you if you hearken diligently
[1:05:22] i will give you the reign of your land
[1:05:23] in this new season
[1:05:25] amen if you serve him with all your
[1:05:27] heart with all your soul verse 14
[1:05:29] i will give you the reign of your land
[1:05:31] and its two seasons the first strain
[1:05:33] and the latter rain that thou mayest is
[1:05:35] gathering thy corn and thy wine in that
[1:05:36] oil
[1:05:37] he said you can have that stimulation of
[1:05:39] revelation you can be fed by the word of
[1:05:41] god
[1:05:41] but you've got to hearken diligently to
[1:05:43] the word to do that
[1:05:45] when brother stewart comes and preaches
[1:05:46] sunday morning you've got a heart
[1:05:48] condition you've got to be willing
[1:05:49] to reach out i'm not rebuking you i'm
[1:05:51] just saying that's what we have to do
[1:05:53] i've got to do it you've got to do it
[1:05:55] and sometimes god will put you in a
[1:05:56] straight
[1:05:57] you know he'll break down your body
[1:05:58] he'll do something to put you in a
[1:06:00] straight
[1:06:00] where you have to listen to him
[1:06:06] sometimes i have to get stirred up a
[1:06:07] little sometimes i think god uses people
[1:06:09] just to make me a little bit upset
[1:06:13] because he wants me to dig he wants me
[1:06:16] to repent he wants me to move
[1:06:21] it's true brother you said god don't do
[1:06:23] that he did it for brother branham
[1:06:26] he wanted him to move so he showed him a
[1:06:28] vision and said if you
[1:06:29] if you remain here this is what you're
[1:06:30] going to do you're going to knock that
[1:06:32] man
[1:06:33] over the hill that comes up there that
[1:06:35] ricky said bypass your troubles
[1:06:39] god will do that too for you aren't you
[1:06:42] glad for a god who cares
[1:06:46] listen brother branham says if they're
[1:06:48] ready to confess and repent and believe
[1:06:50] and accept god cares
[1:06:54] but you got to care first he said you've
[1:06:57] got to accept what he sent you
[1:07:00] so in other words before you can receive
[1:07:02] his care
[1:07:04] you've got to accept what he sent you
[1:07:08] you just stop there for a moment see
[1:07:11] people don't really doubt the gift they
[1:07:14] doubt the giver
[1:07:19] because if brother joe gives me a gift
[1:07:21] even if he throws it at me
[1:07:24] no matter what the delivery is i expect
[1:07:27] it to be a good gift
[1:07:28] because brother joe is a good giver now
[1:07:31] myself
[1:07:32] i'm not a very good giver i love to give
[1:07:34] but i'm not good at it
[1:07:36] you've met people like that i'll
[1:07:38] probably give you something you don't
[1:07:39] need
[1:07:40] so you're probably going to get a gift
[1:07:41] card
[1:07:44] and so but you begin to expect a level
[1:07:47] of gift
[1:07:48] from a person who's a good giver and so
[1:07:52] see when you brother branham talked
[1:07:54] about how you had to have respect for an
[1:07:56] office
[1:07:57] you're not having respect for the person
[1:07:58] you have respect for the office the
[1:08:00] person's in
[1:08:04] and you've got to believe i can't help
[1:08:06] you if you don't at least believe
[1:08:07] that i'm hearing from god even if it was
[1:08:10] god speaking through a donkey
[1:08:14] you understand it if you've got to make
[1:08:15] me a donkey in your mind
[1:08:18] to have god speak through me then so be
[1:08:20] it
[1:08:22] right because you can't get nothing
[1:08:26] unless you have respect for the office
[1:08:28] because
[1:08:29] the problem you have is really not with
[1:08:31] the gift it's with the giver
[1:08:35] and people who constantly complain about
[1:08:37] the gift
[1:08:39] if you give somebody a gift for the
[1:08:41] howard and they just constantly complain
[1:08:42] about it
[1:08:43] what are you going to think every time
[1:08:46] you see them they complain about it
[1:08:50] what are you going to what are you going
[1:08:51] to expect you say well
[1:08:53] i'm not they're not upset at the gift
[1:08:56] it's me
[1:08:58] it's the giver you understand people are
[1:09:01] not
[1:09:01] when they reject ministry they're not
[1:09:03] rejecting ministry they're rejecting
[1:09:05] the one who because it we read the quote
[1:09:07] saturday sunday afternoon
[1:09:08] god said in the church
[1:09:13] you're not rejecting the gift you're
[1:09:14] rejecting the giver
[1:09:17] oh god and you've got to trust him
[1:09:19] enough
[1:09:21] to not prepare the way before you and
[1:09:23] say well i'll come to church if
[1:09:25] everything's just right no
[1:09:27] you've got to respect and love him
[1:09:28] enough that you'll come to church if
[1:09:30] everything's not right
[1:09:32] because you believe somehow that god is
[1:09:35] going to bring rain
[1:09:38] somehow god is going to provide see god
[1:09:42] has a way of providing in the desert
[1:09:44] if you're in the land right that's what
[1:09:47] he did
[1:09:48] for elijah what did he do for elijah it
[1:09:50] was in the middle of a desert
[1:09:51] god said go up to the brook cherith and
[1:09:53] he was provided for
[1:09:55] and the ravens brought him food
[1:09:59] the ravens brought him a sandwich why
[1:10:01] did they do that he could expect that
[1:10:03] because
[1:10:03] god was going to take care of him he was
[1:10:05] where god wanted him to be
[1:10:08] god told him to go up there so god would
[1:10:10] provide for him while he was there
[1:10:12] don't you realize god puts you where you
[1:10:14] are today
[1:10:15] he allowed you to be where you are today
[1:10:17] than if he's big enough to allow you
[1:10:18] to be where you are in your life today
[1:10:20] he's big enough to speak through whoever
[1:10:22] is speaking
[1:10:28] it's got to be
[1:10:34] i remember they were always his people
[1:10:37] and the land had already been provided
[1:10:39] the opportunity to be cared for was
[1:10:41] there
[1:10:43] to be cared for by jehovah
[1:10:46] but how many times did god's people turn
[1:10:49] to idolatry
[1:10:51] even though they had the opportunity to
[1:10:54] be cared for by god
[1:10:58] the fact listen why do people turn so
[1:11:01] readily to idolatry
[1:11:02] because the fact that they made the idol
[1:11:04] when it ought to make them realize
[1:11:07] that it's not a real god because you
[1:11:10] made it
[1:11:13] but the fact that they made it makes
[1:11:16] them comfortable with it
[1:11:20] because with god you never know what he
[1:11:23] might do
[1:11:27] he might make you get out of your
[1:11:28] comfort zone
[1:11:31] he might make you like he does the
[1:11:33] little eagles when he pulls all the all
[1:11:34] the bark and everything out of the nest
[1:11:36] he might make you uncomfortable
[1:11:38] why because he's god he cares enough the
[1:11:41] mama eagle cares enough that she's
[1:11:43] willing to
[1:11:43] pull out all the little twigs all the
[1:11:45] rabbit fur everything that's there
[1:11:47] he's willing he cares enough she cares
[1:11:49] enough to pull all that out
[1:11:51] so that they'll be uncomfortable but so
[1:11:53] they'll go
[1:11:55] because they need to fly on their own
[1:12:00] and if we don't know that after all that
[1:12:02] we've been through in life and in the
[1:12:04] message of the hour after all these
[1:12:05] years since brother branham passed away
[1:12:07] we should know god wants us to fly
[1:12:12] he wanted us to fly listen they were
[1:12:15] still god's people but they had to
[1:12:17] remain in his care
[1:12:19] in order to benefit from it
[1:12:23] so brother branham says if you're ready
[1:12:25] to confess
[1:12:26] and repent believe and accept god cares
[1:12:28] but you got to care first
[1:12:30] you've got to accept what he sent you he
[1:12:33] said he so cared for them that they'd be
[1:12:36] sure
[1:12:36] there would be no mistake
[1:12:39] that they'd be sure that there would be
[1:12:41] no mistake
[1:12:43] listen he vindicated his prophet
[1:12:47] by a sign of a pillar of fire i love
[1:12:50] this
[1:12:51] to let the people see that it wasn't
[1:12:53] just this man walking along here
[1:12:56] but that it was god right above him
[1:13:00] and he was the one who was leading the
[1:13:02] way
[1:13:07] you see satan would attack this age so
[1:13:09] much with science that god would send
[1:13:11] even scientific vindication
[1:13:13] and show us in it with our where we
[1:13:16] could see it
[1:13:19] what god did other ages didn't have that
[1:13:23] but we were able to see why because that
[1:13:25] was the attack satan was making on this
[1:13:27] age
[1:13:27] god isn't real god doesn't care god
[1:13:30] he's somewhere else he's a god of
[1:13:32] history but god said he's praise the
[1:13:34] present tense god
[1:13:35] he said i'm a present tense god and he
[1:13:37] come down and showed himself
[1:13:39] vindicated his prophet for that reason
[1:13:42] to show that he cares god cares he said
[1:13:44] for people who cares
[1:13:46] god cares for those who care for him
[1:13:51] so he vindicated this man and proved
[1:13:53] that he was god's servant
[1:13:54] by sending them a pillar of fire to lead
[1:13:57] them to the very land aren't you glad
[1:14:00] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:14:02] forever
[1:14:04] he cares when you care but you got to
[1:14:07] care first
[1:14:09] he said you got to prove that you care
[1:14:14] so sometimes you have to come to church
[1:14:16] even though you may not get much out of
[1:14:17] it
[1:14:20] sometimes you've got to prove that you
[1:14:22] care
[1:14:23] sometimes you've got to be willing to to
[1:14:26] realize i don't know
[1:14:27] everything lord you know more than i do
[1:14:32] you got to prove that you care
[1:14:36] sometimes god will let it seem and
[1:14:38] brother adam even says this i don't have
[1:14:40] a quote tonight but he talks about how
[1:14:42] that god will make the church even seem
[1:14:44] to be against you
[1:14:47] to see if you care
[1:14:52] are you willing to push past that
[1:14:55] because you don't come here
[1:14:58] just to have a good time
[1:15:02] i don't come here brother sam just just
[1:15:04] so you can hear me preach
[1:15:06] i'd much rather hear somebody else
[1:15:07] preach but i come here because i want to
[1:15:10] i i want to worship god i want to do
[1:15:14] what he called me to do
[1:15:16] and if i i was called to be in the
[1:15:18] pulpit and so be it if you were called
[1:15:19] to be in the pew so be it
[1:15:21] or what chair or whatever you're sitting
[1:15:22] in but god called you to do that and to
[1:15:25] be that
[1:15:26] i'm not here just to have a good time
[1:15:27] and everybody pat me on the back
[1:15:29] and everybody say i did oh you did a
[1:15:31] wonderful job
[1:15:32] no if i never get an opportunity and
[1:15:34] i've said this before
[1:15:36] but i believe in my heart god help me
[1:15:39] remain this way
[1:15:40] if i never have the opportunity to
[1:15:41] preach again if this is my last sermon
[1:15:44] lord i don't want to be some some kind
[1:15:46] of a man that you can't use and throw
[1:15:48] away
[1:15:49] if you're wanting to do that if that's
[1:15:51] his desire is to use me for a while
[1:15:53] and then throw me away i have to be
[1:15:55] willing to be done that way
[1:15:59] or you can't use me in the first place
[1:16:05] i just have to be available and i
[1:16:07] preached to you
[1:16:08] about how the simon stood there when the
[1:16:10] cross of jesus when jesus was carrying
[1:16:12] his cross
[1:16:13] up the via dolorosa and here was simon
[1:16:15] standing there by the side of the road
[1:16:17] he didn't know why he was there but he
[1:16:19] was available
[1:16:21] and that's they say the number one
[1:16:22] ability is availability he was available
[1:16:25] and when the body of christ failed when
[1:16:28] the body of christ was so weak
[1:16:30] that it couldn't get back up you
[1:16:31] remember god didn't fall god knew what
[1:16:32] he was doing
[1:16:33] but god in his providence called simon
[1:16:36] to be right by the side of the road
[1:16:38] at the very intersection where the body
[1:16:39] of christ would grow to its weakest
[1:16:41] and just to pick up the cross and carry
[1:16:43] it for a while
[1:16:45] and if that's what god wants me to do if
[1:16:47] that's the only time he ever uses me
[1:16:49] let me be available
[1:16:53] are you with me or not if we have an
[1:16:54] attitude like that lord if you never use
[1:16:56] me if you prepare me for 30 years to
[1:16:58] preach one sermon
[1:16:59] let me be standing by the way because i
[1:17:01] don't do it for myself
[1:17:03] i do it for god
[1:17:07] you got to prove that you care and then
[1:17:08] god can use you
[1:17:12] i've watched that over the years if i
[1:17:15] get discouraged and disgruntled
[1:17:16] well i'm not being used to nothing sit
[1:17:18] back and kind of drag my feet
[1:17:20] that's what i got but if i prepare for
[1:17:23] that sermon like was the end of my life
[1:17:27] like it was the last day and i go preach
[1:17:29] those five people like was the last
[1:17:30] god was going to do something more for
[1:17:32] me he was going to use me more
[1:17:34] why because i cared
[1:17:37] but you got to care first you got to
[1:17:38] prove that you care
[1:17:42] amen god help us tonight
[1:17:45] do we care enough or we want to have
[1:17:47] church but do we care enough
[1:17:49] to have church when things aren't going
[1:17:51] the way we want them
[1:17:53] to be at church to be in the house of
[1:17:55] god to read the word regardless of how
[1:17:57] we feel
[1:17:58] do we care that much he cared that much
[1:18:03] excuse me i won't yell at you sunday
[1:18:06] because i won't be here
[1:18:08] just pardon me for a moment
[1:18:11] he dragged his body
[1:18:14] through 24 hours of being awake
[1:18:20] something like i think it was like nine
[1:18:21] trials that he went through
[1:18:23] through the day all the different ones
[1:18:24] that tried him sent him back to another
[1:18:26] one
[1:18:28] called him a liar spit in his face foss
[1:18:31] accused him
[1:18:35] took a a a crown of thorns and put it on
[1:18:38] his head
[1:18:40] took a a whip with 39
[1:18:44] or with the lashes a count of nine
[1:18:45] tailing and whipped him with 39 stripes
[1:18:48] until the flesh was torn from his bones
[1:18:51] and the bible says
[1:18:52] his bone my bones they stare at me
[1:18:57] he cares so much that he put up with it
[1:19:00] and the bible says who for the joy that
[1:19:02] was set before him
[1:19:08] what was the joy for joe to be with me
[1:19:13] to be with you he cared so much
[1:19:18] that he allowed himself to be beaten
[1:19:22] i'll go through it for the sake of
[1:19:26] my bride that's what he did
[1:19:30] for our benefit up for his own
[1:19:33] for our benefit for the joy that was set
[1:19:35] before him
[1:19:36] endured the cross despised the shame was
[1:19:38] stripped naked
[1:19:39] and hung before the public as a criminal
[1:19:43] mocked and spit on his clothes were
[1:19:44] gambled on
[1:19:48] because he cared
[1:19:52] that we should ask ourselves the
[1:19:54] question do we care
[1:19:56] enough because again we couldn't repay
[1:19:59] them there's no way none of us humanly
[1:20:01] it couldn't be done humanly we couldn't
[1:20:05] experience that and go through that we'd
[1:20:06] break at some point
[1:20:10] because we're born in sin shape and
[1:20:12] iniquity but god didn't cause us to go
[1:20:14] through that but just the little trials
[1:20:16] and the momentary test that he calls us
[1:20:18] to go through if we could just care
[1:20:19] enough
[1:20:21] to go through that
[1:20:24] and when we're reviled not to revile
[1:20:26] again
[1:20:28] and when we're cursed to threaten not
[1:20:34] we care enough to be like jesus
[1:20:38] hebrews 12 1 says therefore we ought to
[1:20:41] give the more earnest heed to the things
[1:20:43] which we have heard
[1:20:45] lest at any time we should let them slip
[1:20:46] why go back to hebrews chapter one
[1:20:48] he talks about how christ was better
[1:20:51] than the angels
[1:20:53] his word was more steadfast than the
[1:20:56] angels
[1:20:57] and he says because of this therefore we
[1:21:00] ought to give them more earnest heed
[1:21:04] because we don't do this because people
[1:21:06] will love us
[1:21:09] and i love to hear a good word just as
[1:21:10] much as anybody does but that's not why
[1:21:12] i do it
[1:21:14] if it ever becomes why i do it then it's
[1:21:16] of no benefit
[1:21:18] there's plenty of people doing it for
[1:21:20] the money there's plenty of people doing
[1:21:22] it for the fame
[1:21:25] god wants somebody will serve him
[1:21:27] because it's the
[1:21:28] it's what they're called to do and it's
[1:21:31] what they love to do
[1:21:34] we ought to give them more earnest he
[1:21:36] said for the word spoken my angel was
[1:21:37] steadfast
[1:21:38] and every transgression and disobedience
[1:21:40] received a just recompense of reward
[1:21:42] he says how shall we escape if we
[1:21:45] neglect
[1:21:48] not if we despise it do away with it but
[1:21:50] if we neglect
[1:21:52] so great of salvation he cares
[1:21:56] so much for us how shall we escape if we
[1:21:58] neglect to care
[1:22:00] for him which at the first began to be
[1:22:02] spoken by the lord and was confirmed
[1:22:04] unto us
[1:22:05] by them that heard him
[1:22:10] excuse me if i sound just a little bit
[1:22:12] too evangelistic tonight but i think
[1:22:15] i needed this sermon if you didn't
[1:22:20] how shall we escape if we neglect
[1:22:26] you see everybody's looking for comfort
[1:22:28] today everybody wants comfort
[1:22:30] and you see that i've seen that here in
[1:22:31] america when i come back from overseas
[1:22:34] and come back into america everything's
[1:22:35] comfortable things aren't like that
[1:22:37] everywhere
[1:22:39] and i appreciated the comfort i'll be
[1:22:41] honest with you
[1:22:42] even our little little planes are more
[1:22:44] comfortable than the ones
[1:22:46] you ride on overseas
[1:22:49] and even our small airports have more
[1:22:52] amenities
[1:22:53] than theirs we like comfort
[1:22:56] especially in this nation
[1:22:59] but where do we find our comfort
[1:23:01] everybody's looking for it
[1:23:03] but see if we really understand how much
[1:23:06] he cares
[1:23:07] it becomes a comfort to us knowing that
[1:23:10] he provided a messenger to us
[1:23:13] that becomes a comfort to us he said
[1:23:17] well so-and-so doesn't like me and
[1:23:18] so-and-so doesn't but you provided a
[1:23:20] messenger with a message
[1:23:23] behold i send you elijah the prophet
[1:23:29] he didn't stop there he provided me with
[1:23:32] a church to go to
[1:23:33] he's provided with people with me with
[1:23:35] people that love me
[1:23:36] even some of you will sit and listen to
[1:23:38] me preach
[1:23:39] that's more than i deserve
[1:23:42] he cares so much
[1:23:46] and it's a comfort to us because we know
[1:23:48] if he cares for us than that then he
[1:23:50] cares for our finances he cares for our
[1:23:52] everyday life he cares for everything
[1:23:54] that we go through
[1:23:58] hebrews 2 and 4 god also bearing them
[1:24:01] witness both with
[1:24:02] signs and wonders with diverse miracles
[1:24:03] and gifts of the holy ghost according to
[1:24:05] his own will
[1:24:06] in other words he says if we neglect so
[1:24:08] great of salvation this salvation didn't
[1:24:09] just come with word only
[1:24:11] but it come in power and demonstration
[1:24:12] of the spirit
[1:24:14] and it still does today
[1:24:19] do we care enough to respond to the
[1:24:20] gospel
[1:24:25] and just do what it says
[1:24:29] brother says when he was here on earth
[1:24:30] as i say he cared for the people so much
[1:24:32] till he healed their sick
[1:24:33] comforted their hearts told them about a
[1:24:35] place where he could go and prepare for
[1:24:37] them
[1:24:37] would come again to receive them unto
[1:24:39] himself
[1:24:40] he cared for them notice he cared so
[1:24:43] much until when he
[1:24:44] knew he must leave us in order to bring
[1:24:45] this great thing to us he said i'll not
[1:24:47] leave you comfortless
[1:24:48] but i will send the holy spirit he shall
[1:24:50] continue my care for you
[1:24:53] until he returns brother brown says
[1:24:56] there's no one cares like jesus
[1:24:58] knowing that his body is a high priest
[1:25:00] and a mediator of work that he's doing
[1:25:01] now
[1:25:02] that body must be in the presence of god
[1:25:04] at all times for intercession
[1:25:06] that god cannot see the sinner's sin he
[1:25:08] sees only the blood of his own son
[1:25:11] abraham and knowing that he sent back
[1:25:14] the holy spirit
[1:25:15] to continue to comfort his people does
[1:25:18] he care
[1:25:20] certainly he cares
[1:25:23] that presence that you feel tonight that
[1:25:25] that's stirring in your soul
[1:25:26] he cares enough to send that to you
[1:25:30] certainly he cares he was a comfort when
[1:25:33] he was here on earth as a man
[1:25:35] god made flesh god representing himself
[1:25:37] and expressing himself through a man
[1:25:39] christ jesus who promised that the works
[1:25:41] that i do so you do also
[1:25:42] i'm going to the father and going to
[1:25:44] send back the holy spirit which will be
[1:25:45] me in spirit form
[1:25:47] i'll be with you and dwell in you amen
[1:25:51] you care enough to comfort us like that
[1:25:54] now look
[1:25:55] when he come to the earth he comforted
[1:25:56] us the world is in a bad place today
[1:25:59] because they have no comforter
[1:26:05] and you know what i'm talking about some
[1:26:08] of you have been there many of you have
[1:26:10] there's no one to comfort and so people
[1:26:14] look for an idea or theology or doctrine
[1:26:16] or something
[1:26:18] that'll ease the nagging of their mind
[1:26:24] but he cares so much he didn't just send
[1:26:27] us a theology he sent us a person
[1:26:31] he said in ecclesiastes 4 1 that he said
[1:26:34] behold the tears
[1:26:35] i considered all the oppressions that
[1:26:36] were done in the sun and behold the
[1:26:37] tears of such as were oppressed
[1:26:39] and they had no comforter on the side of
[1:26:41] their oppressors there was power
[1:26:43] but they had no comforter we see that in
[1:26:46] the world today
[1:26:48] but he didn't leave you that way you
[1:26:51] experience the same problems the world
[1:26:53] does
[1:26:55] at times we are oppressed at times we
[1:27:00] we we feel the weight of the darkness of
[1:27:03] this world
[1:27:04] but he didn't leave you to deal with
[1:27:06] that alone
[1:27:08] you see jesus when he was here he said
[1:27:09] the spirit of the lord is upon me
[1:27:11] because he hath anointed me to preach
[1:27:12] the gospel to the poor
[1:27:14] he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted
[1:27:17] to preach deliverance to the captains
[1:27:19] the recovering of sight to the blind
[1:27:20] to set at liberty them that are bruised
[1:27:23] to preach the acceptable year
[1:27:25] of the lord did you notice that how he
[1:27:28] did that ministry
[1:27:29] was he actually went out among the
[1:27:32] people
[1:27:33] and he cared for the people the bible
[1:27:37] says he was moved with compassion
[1:27:40] and yet there were a few
[1:27:43] that he cared for in a special way
[1:27:48] how did he do it well stewart he with
[1:27:50] his presence
[1:27:52] right he himself showed up
[1:27:55] at a pool called bethesda
[1:27:59] went through the 5 000 or more people
[1:28:01] that were there waiting at the water's
[1:28:03] edge
[1:28:03] and it comes down to one man and said do
[1:28:05] you want to be well
[1:28:07] do you care enough to be well he tells
[1:28:11] his disciples how much needs go by
[1:28:12] samaria
[1:28:13] and he go up makes his way to samaria
[1:28:15] and sits on a well
[1:28:16] at a certain time of day knowing that
[1:28:18] his disciples wouldn't understand
[1:28:20] he sends them into the village to buy
[1:28:22] food and so he sits there and waits
[1:28:24] on a harlot
[1:28:28] a woman who was no good who had six
[1:28:30] husbands
[1:28:33] five husbands the one she was with
[1:28:35] wasn't hers and so she was sitting there
[1:28:37] or he was sitting there waiting on her
[1:28:39] that's his providential care he loved
[1:28:43] her so much so that ought to make us
[1:28:44] excited tonight
[1:28:45] because don't you realize you're in that
[1:28:47] same place i'm in that same place he
[1:28:49] loved
[1:28:50] you so much that he come by hardy i
[1:28:52] don't know why the message come to hardy
[1:28:54] arkansas
[1:28:55] but god saw he cared so much that he
[1:28:57] provided you with a message right here
[1:28:59] in the place where you are he provided
[1:29:01] you with a church to go to
[1:29:02] he cared so much that he sat down by
[1:29:04] your will where you went to draw water
[1:29:07] and get whatever comfort you could find
[1:29:09] and he cared so much to find you
[1:29:10] in a shoe factory he cared so much to
[1:29:12] find you in a church home
[1:29:14] he cared you so much maybe you were in a
[1:29:16] cult maybe you were in a denomination
[1:29:18] but he cared so much that he found you
[1:29:19] anyway
[1:29:22] hallelujah amen
[1:29:25] he cared so much that he found me found
[1:29:28] you would you care back
[1:29:30] can you care back is there something in
[1:29:31] you does it create a care in you
[1:29:34] he cared for the woman at the well he
[1:29:35] cared for legion
[1:29:38] he had a need to cross over because
[1:29:40] there was a man there
[1:29:42] who needed to be delivered he cared
[1:29:46] he said how do we know he cares his
[1:29:48] presence is proof
[1:29:50] that he cares and how much more present
[1:29:54] can he be
[1:29:56] than he is in this day when a mighty
[1:29:59] angel come down in revelation 10
[1:30:02] with an open book and put his feet on
[1:30:04] the land and on the sea
[1:30:08] how much more could he care than to show
[1:30:11] you that he's present
[1:30:13] hey bed amen listen he said he would
[1:30:16] send us
[1:30:16] another comforter in john 14 and 16 and
[1:30:20] verse 17 said even the spirit of truth
[1:30:22] in the world cannot receive because it
[1:30:23] seeth him not neither knoweth him
[1:30:25] but you know him free dwelleth with you
[1:30:26] and shall be in you verse 18 he says i
[1:30:29] will not leave you comfortless that word
[1:30:31] is orphanos
[1:30:32] it or orphaned it i will not leave you
[1:30:34] without parental care
[1:30:38] we don't like to leave our children even
[1:30:39] as they get older
[1:30:41] we like to stay kind of close by
[1:30:45] leave our son at camp but we don't like
[1:30:46] to be that far away
[1:30:52] god said i don't want to be far away
[1:30:53] from you
[1:30:55] i don't want to be a distant god i care
[1:30:59] for you so much i will not
[1:31:00] leave you without my care
[1:31:05] so it's more than just he does care
[1:31:08] that's how he carries his election but
[1:31:09] it's also
[1:31:11] a care of a father that gives us
[1:31:15] but the random says the people try to
[1:31:17] get together in this
[1:31:18] insane social life
[1:31:23] i wonder if he was prophesying about
[1:31:24] facebook
[1:31:26] and twitter and youtube and instagram
[1:31:30] the people try to get together in this
[1:31:32] insane
[1:31:34] social life he said don't tell me the
[1:31:37] world's not insane
[1:31:38] doing the way it's doing it sure is
[1:31:40] certainly it's a neurotic world
[1:31:42] and by the grace of god is the only way
[1:31:44] we'll escape it
[1:31:46] he said notice in this social life the
[1:31:48] people has come to a place
[1:31:50] that they socialize little clans and
[1:31:52] they get into there and think we're
[1:31:54] better than the next group see
[1:31:56] he said and it's just done that way and
[1:31:58] now we find all those things is because
[1:32:00] people are trying to find comfort
[1:32:03] they're trying to find something he said
[1:32:04] remember
[1:32:05] if you haven't heard anything else i've
[1:32:07] said tonight remember this
[1:32:08] remember your comfort is your religion
[1:32:14] if your comfort is everybody speaking
[1:32:16] well of you that's your religion
[1:32:19] if your comfort is what the world thinks
[1:32:21] that's your religion
[1:32:24] if your comfort is how many likes you
[1:32:25] get on facebook then
[1:32:27] facebook is your religion
[1:32:30] your comfort is your religion and you
[1:32:33] make those things your religion see
[1:32:36] so what a pity and realizing that death
[1:32:40] lays right before you you need a better
[1:32:43] comfort than the lights on facebook
[1:32:50] no matter what we go through in life
[1:32:51] it's still just a vapor
[1:32:55] it appears for a little while and it
[1:32:58] vanishes away
[1:33:01] brother branham says this he says we try
[1:33:03] to find comfort by saying
[1:33:05] i don't have to listen he said no that's
[1:33:08] true you don't have to listen
[1:33:11] but if you are predestinated to eternal
[1:33:13] life
[1:33:14] you will listen to it and you'll rejoice
[1:33:16] to it
[1:33:18] hallelujah i want to be one that
[1:33:21] rejoices to it
[1:33:24] amen i realize that the tear and the
[1:33:26] wheat both rejoice
[1:33:28] but they both rejoice
[1:33:31] i realize there's fake out there there's
[1:33:33] a fake dollar bill but brother branham
[1:33:35] told us that a fake was a
[1:33:36] reason to believe that there's a real
[1:33:40] amen there's got to be something real
[1:33:43] we try to find comfort by saying i don't
[1:33:45] have to listen
[1:33:47] it's true you don't have to listen but
[1:33:48] if you're predestined to eternal life
[1:33:50] you will listen to it and you'll rejoice
[1:33:52] to it
[1:33:53] it's your comfort it's the thing that
[1:33:55] you've longed for all your life
[1:33:57] it's that pearl that you're ready to
[1:33:59] forsake everything
[1:34:01] amen you want it because you know it's
[1:34:03] god's loving care for you
[1:34:04] it's something to settle the sin
[1:34:06] question to settle the unbelief
[1:34:08] to settle everything to you if you want
[1:34:11] it
[1:34:12] you don't have to live life wondering
[1:34:15] what's right
[1:34:16] embarrassing and ashamed if you want it
[1:34:21] you can settle it but i don't you don't
[1:34:23] realize what i've been through brother
[1:34:24] ben you don't realize how many people
[1:34:26] have hurt me
[1:34:27] you're still serving the god of excuses
[1:34:32] but there's a real and a living god
[1:34:37] we'll settle everything for you if you
[1:34:38] wanted
[1:34:40] but the random says this and i'm closing
[1:34:42] in just a moment
[1:34:43] jesus cared on us for the message of
[1:34:45] today to bring these same things to pass
[1:34:48] as he said
[1:34:49] until he died and rose again to send
[1:34:51] them by the holy spirit the comforter
[1:34:53] to show his ministry today that he's
[1:34:56] still alive
[1:34:58] he cared enough won't we care he said
[1:35:01] that's the thing won't we care he died
[1:35:04] for this ministry think about this he
[1:35:07] died
[1:35:08] in order that the holy spirit could be
[1:35:10] here in this day
[1:35:11] to show these things what did he do he
[1:35:13] ascended up on a high
[1:35:14] and then he gave gifts unto men he
[1:35:17] died in order that the holy spirit could
[1:35:19] be here in this day to show these things
[1:35:21] and he reserved that one that gift of a
[1:35:23] prophet and that elijah ministry to come
[1:35:26] at the end time
[1:35:27] why because he cares he died in order
[1:35:30] that the holy spirit could be here in
[1:35:32] this day to show these things
[1:35:33] he cared for you he cared to bring it
[1:35:35] here he cared to make the statement
[1:35:38] he cared because he loved you he cared
[1:35:41] enough to do it to send the holy spirit
[1:35:42] to this
[1:35:43] he said to make this ministry today
[1:35:46] he said that's how he proved he cared in
[1:35:48] that day because he come to vindicate
[1:35:49] what god said he would be
[1:35:51] that's the reason the woman recognized
[1:35:53] him she said i know when messiah cometh
[1:35:54] he's a prophet messiah cometh he'll tell
[1:35:56] us these things see he cared enough
[1:35:58] about the word of god
[1:35:59] to vindicate it to her he said now he
[1:36:02] sent the holy ghost and in this day of
[1:36:03] intellectual conception
[1:36:05] and he might by the same holy spirit
[1:36:07] prove through us
[1:36:08] that he's still the messiah prove it in
[1:36:10] the same way hallelujah
[1:36:12] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:36:14] forever he said now the question is do
[1:36:16] you care
[1:36:17] what do you think about it it's here
[1:36:19] it's been proven over and over
[1:36:21] do you care not to believe it do you
[1:36:22] care not to confess your sins that
[1:36:24] you're wrong
[1:36:25] confess your unbelief and accept it you
[1:36:27] care not to accept it
[1:36:29] he cared enough to die and rise again to
[1:36:30] bring it to you do you care enough to
[1:36:32] accept it
[1:36:35] amen he cared enough to conquer every
[1:36:37] enemy for you do you believe that
[1:36:38] tonight
[1:36:40] amen musicians go ahead and come we're
[1:36:42] closing he cared enough
[1:36:43] he cared enough to conquer every enemy
[1:36:45] from you and all you have to do is be
[1:36:47] sincere and believe it
[1:36:48] he conquered death that ain't nothing
[1:36:50] for me to conquer it's already conquered
[1:36:53] sickness ain't for me to conquer it
[1:36:54] ain't for christ to conquer it's already
[1:36:56] conquered
[1:36:57] i just have to care enough to believe it
[1:36:59] he said are you afraid of what somebody
[1:37:01] else has told you
[1:37:02] are you afraid of the doctor's diagnosis
[1:37:04] are you afraid of what the church will
[1:37:05] say to you
[1:37:06] are you afraid to stand there total
[1:37:07] total the devil say i've confessed my
[1:37:09] sins
[1:37:10] i've laid aside everything i believed
[1:37:12] every word here i am lord
[1:37:15] you realize what that woman at the well
[1:37:17] had to do she didn't have to go
[1:37:19] apologize for somebody else
[1:37:20] she went and preached the gospel in her
[1:37:22] own way you understand she went and
[1:37:24] testified
[1:37:25] to a bunch of men that she'd recently
[1:37:27] been living with
[1:37:30] god help us today but she cared so much
[1:37:34] about what a uh what a the son of god
[1:37:37] come to tell her
[1:37:39] about the word for that day that she
[1:37:41] went and testified to him anyway
[1:37:44] and brother brown said she cared about
[1:37:45] the word and she cared about her people
[1:37:49] do we care enough about the word and
[1:37:50] enough about our people
[1:37:53] to be at the house of god to confess our
[1:37:56] sins
[1:37:58] i don't care what anybody else thinks
[1:37:59] i'm going to serve god
[1:38:01] no matter what i've been no matter where
[1:38:03] i've been no matter what i've done or
[1:38:05] someone else has done
[1:38:07] here i am lord i believed every word
[1:38:09] created me a care
[1:38:11] you cared for me i care for you
[1:38:16] first peter 5 and 6 says humble
[1:38:18] yourselves therefore under the mighty
[1:38:19] hand of god
[1:38:20] he may exalt you in due time casting all
[1:38:23] your care upon him
[1:38:26] for he careth for you
[1:38:30] hey man let's bow our heads together
[1:38:33] if you could just play something softly
[1:38:35] mr mary
[1:38:38] [Music]
[1:38:43] he cares enough and i had to think today
[1:38:48] yesterday and i actually had prepared to
[1:38:50] preach this
[1:38:52] a couple of weeks ago
[1:38:55] and we had a snowstorm and i didn't
[1:38:57] preach it and then
[1:38:59] i was looking over it this week and
[1:39:02] it just becomes such a burden on my
[1:39:04] heart and i said lord this must be the
[1:39:05] time
[1:39:06] that you wanted this to preach i don't
[1:39:09] know why i don't pretend
[1:39:11] to know i'm always a little amused when
[1:39:13] people think i'm preaching at them
[1:39:14] because i don't have that much control
[1:39:16] over what i say
[1:39:17] [Music]
[1:39:21] sometimes i don't i stand up here and i
[1:39:23] think god why'd i say that
[1:39:27] he has to be able to speak because he
[1:39:30] cares
[1:39:32] i just have to be the the conduit and
[1:39:34] the
[1:39:35] something that can plug in a microphone
[1:39:38] he can speak through
[1:39:40] yes i study and i prepare and i put all
[1:39:42] the notes up here
[1:39:44] but god has to move through that i could
[1:39:46] read all those notes in 20 minutes
[1:39:48] believe it or not
[1:39:51] god has to care enough to speak to our
[1:39:55] hearts
[1:39:58] god has to do that
[1:40:02] he won't care he does care but
[1:40:05] we can't receive the benefits of that
[1:40:07] care unless
[1:40:08] we care would you just in your heart
[1:40:13] tonight here in the building and those
[1:40:15] of you that are watching that i know
[1:40:17] you can't come on wednesday night it's
[1:40:18] just too far
[1:40:20] for many
[1:40:24] maybe you've worked all day and you're
[1:40:25] tired and it's been hard to listen
[1:40:29] but he cares for you
[1:40:31] [Music]
[1:40:34] if you just take a moment and realize
[1:40:36] how much he cares
[1:40:37] [Music]
[1:40:39] he cares enough to give you what you
[1:40:40] need not what you want
[1:40:44] to provide for you what you have need of
[1:40:49] whether that's a
[1:40:51] a great speaker or a poor one
[1:40:54] whether it's a mighty man or a valor or
[1:40:59] a timid man hiding in a in a well that
[1:41:02] god called the mighty man of valor
[1:41:06] whatever it is god cared enough to send
[1:41:08] it to you
[1:41:08] [Music]
[1:41:10] god cared enough to inspire me to preach
[1:41:12] he cares enough to inspire you to hear
[1:41:14] and he cared enough for you to come to
[1:41:15] church even when it's hard and maybe
[1:41:17] you've done it for year after year after
[1:41:19] year after year but he still cares
[1:41:21] he still wants to move in your life he
[1:41:23] still wants to make you different he
[1:41:24] wants to make you better
[1:41:26] the shame is not in falling down the
[1:41:28] shame is in not getting up
[1:41:30] everybody falls down everybody makes
[1:41:32] mistakes
[1:41:34] but if we won't get up that's on us
[1:41:36] because he cared so much to send us the
[1:41:38] message of the hour
[1:41:39] a deliverance message so that we could
[1:41:41] be god's people here in the end time
[1:41:44] would you just return that care to him
[1:41:46] in your hearts tonight lord
[1:41:48] lord created me a care created me a care
[1:41:53] lord if there's something if i've gone
[1:41:54] calloused if i'm
[1:41:56] if i'm not as as warm as i should be to
[1:42:00] the gospel
[1:42:02] if i've grown cold in my relationship
[1:42:05] with you and maybe that's caused me
[1:42:07] to grow cold in my relationship with
[1:42:08] others because the bible says because
[1:42:10] iniquity shall abound the love of many
[1:42:12] will grow cold
[1:42:14] sin causes that if i could just
[1:42:17] be warm again if i could just if i could
[1:42:20] just
[1:42:20] care again if there was just something
[1:42:22] in my heart
[1:42:24] that would supersede the emotions of the
[1:42:26] flesh and supersede the tiredness and
[1:42:28] supersede that say lord
[1:42:31] you cared for me i i care for you
[1:42:35] you created me a care lord
[1:42:36] [Music]
[1:42:38] i pray you granted heavenly father lord
[1:42:41] jesus
[1:42:42] i'm placing myself here on the altars
[1:42:44] these people here on a wednesday night
[1:42:47] lord let this be our prayer meeting
[1:42:50] tonight god
[1:42:52] you cared enough for us to send us a
[1:42:55] message of this
[1:42:56] day you cared and i thought i could
[1:42:58] think back and look over my life
[1:43:00] and see different ministries you cared
[1:43:01] enough for me to send a minister by my
[1:43:04] way and preach to me and i'm so grateful
[1:43:06] they weren't perfect men but you cared
[1:43:08] enough to send somebody by my way
[1:43:10] so that they could preach the truth i
[1:43:12] don't want to try to manipulate it lord
[1:43:14] i don't want to try to
[1:43:15] change it let it come lord if it hurts
[1:43:17] it hurts
[1:43:19] oh god created a care for the word of
[1:43:22] god
[1:43:22] created me a hunger for the things of
[1:43:24] god
[1:43:26] a desire to be in the house of god
[1:43:29] i want to lord because i know i get what
[1:43:32] i want
[1:43:33] and what i want is you most of all lord
[1:43:36] would you just create that in my life in
[1:43:38] my heart
[1:43:39] i pray you'd grant it lord i know
[1:43:42] god that there'd be many battles ahead
[1:43:45] to fight
[1:43:47] but we're getting awful close whatever
[1:43:50] battle lays in front of us
[1:43:52] i'm sure this world won't get any better
[1:43:54] it just keeps getting worse and worse
[1:43:56] but oh god whatever battle is left there
[1:43:59] to fight
[1:44:00] sometimes it's scary sometimes it feels
[1:44:02] like it's giants
[1:44:03] sometimes it feels like the sons of anak
[1:44:06] are growing up everywhere
[1:44:07] and there's just so many heads so hard
[1:44:09] to chop off but god if you could just
[1:44:12] if you could just let us grab the sword
[1:44:14] of the word and begin to chop lord
[1:44:16] if you could just anoint the ministry to
[1:44:18] grab the sword of the word and begin to
[1:44:20] chop against the devil
[1:44:21] that's what you want lord you want us to
[1:44:23] give us give it your
[1:44:25] our all you gave it your oh lord i'm so
[1:44:28] grateful for that
[1:44:30] creating us a care that it doesn't
[1:44:32] matter whether we're
[1:44:34] whether we're used and abused and thrown
[1:44:36] aside
[1:44:38] we'll still love you we'll still serve
[1:44:40] your people
[1:44:42] because that's what you want more than
[1:44:45] anything else
[1:44:47] you don't want sacrifice it's not how
[1:44:49] many sermons i could preach
[1:44:51] you want obedience oh god
[1:44:54] if obeying you means that this is the
[1:44:57] last sermon i ever preached god forbid
[1:44:59] that it would be
[1:45:00] if it was if that's what obeying you
[1:45:02] meant let me obey you lord

[1:53:28] we sing this as we go
[1:53:40] the way it's got to be
[1:53:54] there's no room left in me
[1:54:01] all those wasted
[1:54:04] hours and minutes they're yours now
[1:54:10] from the start to the finish
[1:54:13] i need more
[1:54:25] [Music]
