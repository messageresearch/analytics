[46:21] one we're going to won't be here on
[46:24] Sunday brother Joe Reynolds will be here
[46:26] we we will have two Services the Lord
[46:28] willing uh but brother Joe's going to be
[46:31] preaching and so I'm sure you're looking
[46:33] forward to that and some if you get a
[46:35] chance to go to to Oklahoma we'd sure be
[46:38] glad to have you up there as well at
[46:40] brother windows and pony Oklahoma
[46:42] looking forward to that meeting James
[46:45] chapter 4 and verse one from whence come
[46:47] Wars and fightings among you maybe you
[46:51] had a a war to get to church tonight and
[46:55] it was a little bit of a fuss
[46:58] and was hard to
[46:59] come where does that come from he said
[47:02] come they not hence even of your lust or
[47:04] your desires that war in your members
[47:07] said you lust and have not you kill and
[47:09] desire to have and cannot obtain you
[47:12] fight and War yet you have not because
[47:15] you ask
[47:16] not you ask and receive not because you
[47:19] ask amiss that you may consume it upon
[47:22] your lust it gets pretty hard here in
[47:25] verse four you adulter adulterers and
[47:28] adulteresses know ye not that the
[47:30] Friendship of the world is enmity with
[47:32] God whosoever therefore will be a friend
[47:35] of the world is the enemy of God do you
[47:37] think that the scripture saith in vain
[47:39] the spirit that dwelleth in US Le
[47:41] lusteth to Envy I love verse six but he
[47:46] giveth more grace wherefore he saith God
[47:50] resisteth the proud but giveth Grace
[47:53] unto the humble and this is a great
[47:56] verse for verse 7 submit yourselves
[47:59] therefore to God resist the devil and he
[48:03] will flee from you I pray the Lord would
[48:06] add his Blessing to the word you may be
[48:07] seated I want to speak to you tonight on
[48:10] submission submission the word
[48:12] submission in the Greek is not uh to be
[48:16] conquered by an enemy and to give up
[48:19] that's not what submission is submission
[48:22] is
[48:23] voluntary it is a military term it means
[48:26] I put in a lower rank or I rank under I
[48:30] subject I put into subjection I
[48:33] subordinate myself I put myself into
[48:38] subjection so James is telling us you
[48:40] need to put yourself in the proper
[48:43] relation to God and then you begin to
[48:46] resist the devil and he will flee from
[48:48] you there's got to be something bigger
[48:50] than our thoughts there's got to be
[48:52] something bigger than what we think it's
[48:54] got to be there's got to be a higher or
[48:56] there's got to be an absolute there's
[48:58] got to be a reality of something that we
[49:01] can submit ourselves to and we find
[49:03] ourselves in in a great battle of of
[49:06] life and we find ourselves uh needing uh
[49:09] needing to to win that battle and we
[49:11] must win that battle the only way we can
[49:13] do that is by submitting ourselves to
[49:16] those that are above us and I'll say
[49:19] what I'm preaching about tonight is not
[49:21] submitting yourself to a man but
[49:23] submitting yourself to Jesus Christ who
[49:26] is our Major General and he's the one
[49:28] that's going to make help us make it
[49:30] through do you believe that tonight he
[49:32] he is the one that we submit
[49:34] to when uh General uh Eisenhower was in
[49:38] the second world war Eisenhower was a
[49:41] death jockey he he spent all of his time
[49:44] behind a desk he was never Under Fire
[49:47] actually until after he was a fourstar
[49:50] general he he never fought in the ranks
[49:52] he never he never come up that way
[49:54] Patton was very different Patton had
[49:57] fought and he had he'd come up the hard
[49:59] way and he he'd been right there with
[50:01] his men and he had much more experience
[50:04] in the field and Eisenhower did but when
[50:07] it come time to invade France to go on
[50:09] into Germany Patton had to submit
[50:12] himself or subordinate himself to
[50:15] Eisenhower not because Eisenhower had
[50:18] better ideas or or because Eisenhower
[50:20] was a greater person or because he was
[50:23] smarter or anything else you know why he
[50:25] submitted to him he had one more star on
[50:29] his shoulder than Patton did and we do
[50:32] not submit ourselves to God because
[50:34] because we understand God we don't
[50:36] submit ourselves to God because
[50:38] everything makes sense we don't submit
[50:40] ourselves to God because we can figure
[50:43] it all out we don't do that we submit
[50:45] ourselves to the word which just
[50:46] submitting ourselves to God and the
[50:48] reason we do it is because he outranks
[50:51] us he know he he he is God because of
[50:55] who he is that's why Patton submitted
[50:57] himself or subord himself subordinated
[51:00] himself to Eisenhower is because of who
[51:02] Eisenhower was and we ought to submit
[51:06] ourselves to God not because we
[51:08] understand what he's doing because many
[51:10] times we won't understand right we'll go
[51:13] through things that are seem like seem
[51:15] like torture and seem like there's no
[51:16] explanation and and I thought about the
[51:19] Joe was coming to preacher Sunday and
[51:21] how I think it's been 5 years since
[51:24] cherith passed away and I I I think
[51:26] about that tonight and I thought there's
[51:27] no explanation for that right you you
[51:30] don't understand it there's no way to
[51:32] wrap your mind around it why a
[51:34] 16-year-old girl would would pass away
[51:36] like that but yet we submit ourselves to
[51:39] God we said Lord though he slay me yet
[51:42] I'll trust him though though I don't
[51:45] understand what's going on in my life
[51:46] though it may look like it's a strange
[51:49] happening yet I know he outranks me and
[51:52] he outranks me for a reason if he made
[51:56] you that means he's got one more star on
[51:59] his shoulder than you've
[52:01] got now look he's got he he outranks me
[52:05] he outranks you he outranks
[52:08] prophets he outranks all of us so we
[52:12] submit though we do not understand
[52:15] always we voluntarily submit to God and
[52:20] fight our battles that way now Paul when
[52:23] he begins to talk about submission I
[52:24] want to lay a little bit of a groundwork
[52:25] here tonight
[52:27] but Paul said that the Jews had not
[52:29] submitted to the righteousness of God in
[52:32] Romans 10:3 for they being ignorant of
[52:35] God's righteousness and going about to
[52:37] establish their own righteousness we've
[52:39] all known people like that that's
[52:41] legalism that's what the Jews were
[52:43] trying to do he said have not submitted
[52:46] themselves unto the righteousness of God
[52:49] so they're they're trying to in their by
[52:51] their own efforts to secure God's favor
[52:54] and there's no submission in that we're
[52:56] to submit to God and Paul tells us also
[52:59] in 1 Corinthians 16:15 we're to submit
[53:02] to those who God is
[53:03] using in verse 15 he said I beseech you
[53:06] Brethren you know the house of stefanus
[53:08] that it is the first fruits of aayah and
[53:11] that they have addicted themselves to
[53:12] the ministry of the Saints I I wish that
[53:15] was written about me I really do I I
[53:17] want that to be my family I I want that
[53:19] to be us as a church that we've addicted
[53:21] ourselves to helping the Saints which is
[53:24] what Ministry is and verse 16 says that
[53:27] you submit yourselves unto such so if
[53:31] you see someone that is giving their
[53:33] lives for the gospel it's okay to be
[53:36] subordinate to that person listen to
[53:38] that person and and find out if there's
[53:39] a way you can help that person because
[53:41] they're doing that not of themselves but
[53:44] God has led them to do that and so he
[53:46] says to and to everyone that helpeth
[53:48] with us and labor so in other words it's
[53:50] not just to the pastor or somebody else
[53:53] but also those that help now we're to
[53:56] sub submit to the law of the land and
[53:58] this going to get touchy real quick but
[54:00] but we are supposed to submit to the
[54:03] law somebody said
[54:06] amen the Bible says submit yourselves to
[54:08] every ordinance of man an ordinance is a
[54:12] law for the Lord's sake whether it be to
[54:16] the king of supreme or unto Governors
[54:18] unto them that are sent by him for the
[54:20] punishment of evildoers and for the
[54:22] praise of them that do well he said for
[54:25] so is the will of God that was
[54:26] well-doing you may put to silence the
[54:28] ignorance of foolish men as free he said
[54:31] not using your Liberty for a cloak of
[54:33] maliciousness best the Servants of God I
[54:35] watched a a young man here this week get
[54:38] uh I saw it on the internet where he got
[54:41] uh stopped a young athlete he got
[54:43] stopped and and he couldn't figure out
[54:46] why they took him out of the car and put
[54:47] him on the ground well the truth is they
[54:50] did that CU he would not
[54:52] submit right he refused to roll his
[54:54] window down so they dragged him out of
[54:56] the car and everybody saying oh it's
[54:57] it's something bad going on some evil
[55:00] cops doing that no he just refused to
[55:01] submit to a lawful Authority and as
[55:05] Christians we have a
[55:06] responsibility to submit to lawful
[55:09] Authority now look brother Brandon's
[55:12] speaking about fire marshal laws and and
[55:15] he says this if we will not obey Caesar
[55:18] it's doubtful that we'd obey
[55:20] God that's pretty strong isn't it as
[55:23] long as Caesar's laws don't interfere
[55:25] with Gods he said we must must obey God
[55:27] first right we must obey God first but
[55:31] when when we can obey Caesar's law
[55:33] because it doesn't conflict with the law
[55:34] of God we obey Caesar's law random dealt
[55:37] with this in relation to game laws and I
[55:39] know it's the wrong time of year to talk
[55:40] about this but but maybe we should go
[55:44] ahead and and brother brand said this
[55:46] certain brother BR was talking about a
[55:47] young man he went squirrel hunting with
[55:50] I think this was Charlie Cox I'm not I'm
[55:52] not sure I think that's who he's talking
[55:54] about here brother brandom took six
[55:56] uh that he took six squirrels that day
[55:59] because that was the limit this young
[56:01] man this certain person said I got nine
[56:03] he said a chrisan boy fine kid I said
[56:05] you done wrong you did wrong I said if I
[56:08] come to this country preaching to you
[56:09] boys you people here the thing that's
[56:11] right he said I've got to live that
[56:13] example Christianity Christianity ain't
[56:16] what you say it's what you live what you
[56:17] do how many can say Amen to that today
[56:20] it's an example you're the salt of the
[56:22] earth again we're just kind of giving a
[56:24] background for where I want to go
[56:25] tonight night but he said then the law
[56:28] says Jesus said you give Caesar them
[56:29] things that belong to Caesar you break
[56:31] that speed law out there he said what
[56:33] are you doing you're doing wrong you sin
[56:36] give Caesar what's Caesar's and God
[56:38] what's Gods I don't always understand
[56:39] the speed law I don't understand why
[56:42] it's 55 out here at the highway when it
[56:44] ought to be lower because uh because of
[56:46] the trucks and things going down that
[56:48] Hill I don't understand that but we obey
[56:49] the law right there's places I don't
[56:52] understand why it's 55 when it should be
[56:54] 75 amen
[56:56] that's right but we obey the law right
[57:00] now look I I know I know that's the one
[57:02] thing you can preach and everybody's
[57:04] guilty but brother Brandon said well you
[57:06] say well the law is wrong I can't help
[57:08] what wrong it is he said it's wrong to
[57:10] break jesus' commandment and if you
[57:12] don't give Caesar the thing that Caesars
[57:14] and you did what Jesus told you not to
[57:15] do and the transgression of the law is
[57:17] sin and and I like this he continued on
[57:20] he said we're all guilty we do
[57:22] it right he said but when you see
[57:25] yourself wrong
[57:26] stop it the words don't do it on purpose
[57:30] submit yourself to the to the law of the
[57:32] land he said people are watching you
[57:33] people won't go to church but they'll
[57:35] read you and see what you do or see your
[57:37] name in the
[57:39] paper right Romans 131 let every soul be
[57:43] subject to the higher powers for there
[57:46] is no power but but of god the powers
[57:49] that be are ordained of God you young
[57:52] people you children need to listen to
[57:54] this the powers that be whether they're
[57:56] parents whether they're School teachers
[57:57] whether they're deacons in the church
[57:59] those powers are ordained of God in
[58:01] other words God allowed them to be there
[58:04] because he could remove them in an
[58:05] instant if he wanted to so he said
[58:08] whosoever therefore resisteth the power
[58:10] resisteth the ordinance of God and they
[58:12] that resist shall receive to themselves
[58:14] damnation he said for rulers are not a
[58:16] terror to good works but to the evil wil
[58:19] thou then not be afraid of the power he
[58:21] said do that which is good and thou
[58:22] shall have Praise of the same for he is
[58:25] the minister of God to thee for good but
[58:28] if thou do that which is evil be afraid
[58:31] for he beareth not the sword in vain for
[58:32] he is the Minister of God Revenger to
[58:35] execute wrath upon him that doeth evil
[58:37] he said wherefore you must needs be
[58:39] subject that's the same word submit you
[58:41] must needs be in submission he said not
[58:44] only for wrath but also for conscience
[58:48] sake in other words because it's the
[58:49] right thing to do not just because of
[58:51] the
[58:52] penalty and you say brother man why are
[58:54] you preaching on this well Paul told
[58:56] Titus to preach on it Titus 3:1 he said
[58:59] put them in mind to be subject to
[59:01] principalities and powers to obey
[59:04] magistrates to be ready to every good
[59:06] work to speak evil of no man to be no
[59:08] Brawlers but gentle showing all meekness
[59:10] unto all men I think it's about time we
[59:12] preach the Full Gospel right you won't
[59:15] get as many amens or shouts preaching
[59:16] something like this but it's still the
[59:18] truth right we we know that there's a
[59:21] headship in the home wives are to submit
[59:23] to husbands Ephesians 5:2 two wiv submit
[59:26] yourselves unto your own husbands as
[59:28] unto the Lord for the husband is the
[59:30] head of the wife even as Christ is the
[59:31] head of the of the church and he is the
[59:33] savior the body therefore is the church
[59:36] is subject unto Christ so that the wives
[59:37] be to their own husbands in everything 1
[59:40] Peter 3:1 likewise you wise be in
[59:42] subjection to your own husbands that
[59:44] word subjection again is submission he
[59:47] said that if any obey not the word they
[59:48] also may be without the word be won by
[59:51] the conversation of the wi so the
[59:53] husband's an unbeliever he said even if
[59:55] you never never tell them the word they
[59:57] can be won by the way you act according
[1:00:00] to the word he said well they behold
[1:00:03] your Chase conversation coupled with
[1:00:04] fear fear there is not a terror but it's
[1:00:08] a respect yes brother Brandon follows
[1:00:11] that up and I always use this because I
[1:00:12] think it's an important quote brother
[1:00:15] brandom says a man's not supposed to use
[1:00:16] that authority over over a woman just
[1:00:18] because he's her ruler so he has
[1:00:21] Authority but he's not supposed to use
[1:00:24] it he's not supposed to use it in that
[1:00:27] way right just because he's her ruler it
[1:00:31] has to be an agreed thing submission is
[1:00:35] voluntary right and so it's got to be
[1:00:37] it's got to be going both ways now look
[1:00:39] he said if your wife he said God is her
[1:00:41] ruler above you brother he said if your
[1:00:43] wife is doing something wrong he said
[1:00:45] you got a right to tell her and she's
[1:00:47] supposed to listen to you but you
[1:00:49] haven't got got no right to beat her or
[1:00:51] drag her around or do those things he
[1:00:53] said no he said God Made Men a help make
[1:00:55] not adore can we say Amen to that
[1:00:57] tonight remember she was your sweetheart
[1:01:00] she should always be that oh God help us
[1:01:02] as men tonight to keep that word we want
[1:01:05] to see the word manifested in every way
[1:01:07] in our lives let that word be manifested
[1:01:09] husbands love your wives as Christ love
[1:01:12] the
[1:01:13] church if we want them to manifest
[1:01:15] submission we need to manifest
[1:01:18] loving he talks about servants to
[1:01:21] Masters so I move real quickly off of
[1:01:24] that we he talks about servants to
[1:01:26] Masters in 1 Peter 21:18 servants be
[1:01:29] subject to your Masters be subm in
[1:01:32] submission to your masters with all fear
[1:01:35] not only to the good and gentle but also
[1:01:37] to the froward words you're going to
[1:01:39] have bosses that aren't any
[1:01:41] fun you're G to have bosses a frow word
[1:01:44] man is a
[1:01:45] jerk whenever you see forward in the
[1:01:47] Bible that means he's a
[1:01:49] jerk that's right that's basically what
[1:01:52] it means it's a biblical term it's a
[1:01:54] it's or it's a it's a King James term
[1:01:56] for jerk and and sometimes bosses are
[1:01:59] jerks but you're supposed to still
[1:02:01] subordinate yourself to them my pastor
[1:02:04] used to tell me and and it was great
[1:02:06] advice he said your job is to make your
[1:02:08] boss
[1:02:09] Rich he said if you think like that you
[1:02:12] you you'll you'll be okay that's your
[1:02:14] job and so uh so we have to we we have
[1:02:18] to subordinate ourselves to what's going
[1:02:20] on in the company what's going on at
[1:02:22] work he he tells the younger to submit
[1:02:25] to the Eld he said likewise you younger
[1:02:27] submit yourself unto the Elder and I'll
[1:02:30] let you decide who's younger and who's
[1:02:32] Elder he said younger submit yourself
[1:02:34] subordinate yourself to the Elder he
[1:02:37] said yay all someone say
[1:02:39] all now here here's an interesting uh
[1:02:43] scripture he said all of you be subject
[1:02:46] one to another so in other words
[1:02:48] subordinate your interest to the
[1:02:50] interest of somebody else he said
[1:02:53] eternal life is living for others how
[1:02:55] many believe that tonight so subordinate
[1:02:58] your interest oh what kind of a church
[1:02:59] could we have if we submitted ourselves
[1:03:02] one to another subordinated our interest
[1:03:04] one to another he said all of you be
[1:03:07] subject to one another and be clothed
[1:03:09] with humility for God resisteth the
[1:03:11] proud and giveth grace to the humble he
[1:03:14] talks about the church in Ephesians 5:21
[1:03:17] right before he talks about he talks
[1:03:19] about women and submitting to their
[1:03:21] husbands and how men should treat their
[1:03:24] wives he says submitting yourselves one
[1:03:26] to another in the fear of God brother
[1:03:28] random interprets that this way he said
[1:03:30] submit yourself congregation submit
[1:03:33] yourself to your pastor Pastor submit
[1:03:36] yourself to your congregation he said if
[1:03:39] a little click Rises up he said don't be
[1:03:42] on either side submit yourself to the
[1:03:45] whole
[1:03:47] congregation right congregation maybe a
[1:03:50] good example of that would be if we were
[1:03:52] going to build a new building and we
[1:03:53] took a vote and the church voted it down
[1:03:56] right I wouldn't I wouldn't suddenly get
[1:03:58] with those who agreed with me and try to
[1:04:00] overturn it right that's not my job my
[1:04:03] job is to submit myself to the will of
[1:04:05] the congregation right that's what he
[1:04:08] told us to do submit yourself
[1:04:09] congregation he said if you start in a
[1:04:11] click submit yourself to your pastor in
[1:04:14] the fear of God oh church and you say
[1:04:17] well why would I do that because God
[1:04:18] said
[1:04:20] to right and at some point it's got to
[1:04:22] become that it's got to be obedience
[1:04:24] because he's God yes all right are you
[1:04:27] with me
[1:04:28] now we're told that prophets submit to
[1:04:32] prophets right prophets just don't get
[1:04:35] to do what they want to do preachers
[1:04:36] just don't get to do what they want to
[1:04:38] do they have an area of authority and if
[1:04:40] they move outside that area of authority
[1:04:42] they're under someone else's
[1:04:44] Authority right if I go to brother
[1:04:46] wendles this weekend and preach a
[1:04:48] service I don't get to pick how many
[1:04:50] services I preach or or what kind of
[1:04:52] color the carpet's going to be or or
[1:04:54] whether they put Gatorade water on the
[1:04:56] pulpit or how loud the sound system is I
[1:04:58] don't get to pick that why because I
[1:05:00] subordinate myself to the the pastor
[1:05:04] that's there brother brandom talks about
[1:05:05] that in several places I didn't bring
[1:05:07] the quotes brother brandom actually
[1:05:08] talks about that we submit ourselves one
[1:05:10] to another I'm there I'm not there
[1:05:12] promoting our church I'm there to help
[1:05:14] his church and when he comes here he's
[1:05:16] not here to to promote his church he's
[1:05:19] here he's coming here to help us and and
[1:05:21] that way we all help one another right
[1:05:24] so we find that in that that Jesus is
[1:05:27] our example how many believe that
[1:05:29] tonight Jesus is our example in these
[1:05:31] things he submitted to his Earthly
[1:05:34] parents in Luke 2:51 it says he went
[1:05:36] down with them and came to Nazareth and
[1:05:38] was subject unto them that's that word
[1:05:41] submit but his mother kept all these
[1:05:44] sayings in her heart and and here's a
[1:05:46] remarkable scripture in 1 Corinthians
[1:05:48] 15:28 and if you ask for an explanation
[1:05:50] of this I may not be able to give you
[1:05:52] one or at least one that'll satisfy you
[1:05:56] but listen what he says about Jesus when
[1:05:57] all things should be subdued unto him he
[1:06:01] said then shall the son also himself be
[1:06:04] subject unto him that put all things
[1:06:06] under him that God may be all in all so
[1:06:10] even the son right which is the body
[1:06:13] Jesus is subject to God that's what he
[1:06:17] said in fact when he was here he said I
[1:06:18] do nothing L the father tells me right
[1:06:21] right and so we must submit ourselves to
[1:06:25] God
[1:06:26] and I know you're sitting there maybe
[1:06:28] thinking and and and I thought this is
[1:06:30] what occurred to me well
[1:06:31] how how would I submit myself to God
[1:06:35] well it begins in our thoughts we've got
[1:06:39] to subordinate our thought life to his
[1:06:43] thoughts and that could be uh
[1:06:45] subordinating oursel to the way way we
[1:06:47] dress the way we act the way we talk it
[1:06:50] could be subordinating oursel to his
[1:06:51] idea of what we are we could say I'm a
[1:06:54] loser but what does God say we can say
[1:06:56] I'm a sinner but what does God say we
[1:06:59] can say I I'm I'm never going to make it
[1:07:01] but what does God say submission is is
[1:07:04] subordinating yourself to the word of
[1:07:07] God I may not feel like I'm saved but I
[1:07:10] come God's provided way I know I'm saved
[1:07:12] not because I have a good feeling not
[1:07:14] because I shouted and run the aisles but
[1:07:16] I I I know I'm saved because I know I
[1:07:19] follow his prescription I receive the
[1:07:22] baptism of the Holy Ghost I know I've
[1:07:24] been born again I'm can say Amen to that
[1:07:26] tonight I don't know that because I feel
[1:07:28] like it tonight right cuz I may not feel
[1:07:31] like it every
[1:07:33] night we subordinate our thoughts to his
[1:07:36] thoughts oh that's what we ought to be
[1:07:38] doing tonight subordinating our thoughts
[1:07:39] to the word now look we might come into
[1:07:42] church and say well you know I I I I
[1:07:45] think that church would be better if we
[1:07:47] do this or I think that it'd be better
[1:07:49] if we were more like the denominations
[1:07:51] but we subordinate oursel to the
[1:07:53] thoughts of God that he expressed
[1:07:55] through a prophet in our age what are we
[1:07:57] doing we're submitting to God's word
[1:08:01] we're submitting to God's program you
[1:08:04] might say well I I wish something was
[1:08:06] different but what do we do he said the
[1:08:08] weapons of our Warfare are not carnal
[1:08:10] But Mighty through God to the pulling
[1:08:12] down of strongholds he said casting down
[1:08:15] imaginations and every High thing that
[1:08:19] exalteth itself against the knowledge of
[1:08:21] God and bringing into captivity every
[1:08:24] thought to The Obedience of Christ what
[1:08:28] is that that's subordinating our
[1:08:31] thoughts to his thoughts it don't mean
[1:08:34] we don't have any thoughts just means
[1:08:35] they're
[1:08:39] subordinate if we pick one to follow we
[1:08:42] pick
[1:08:43] his oh my look there's there's
[1:08:49] power in
[1:08:52] submission how many have heard the story
[1:08:54] of Georgie Carter yes Georgie Carter was
[1:08:58] one of the earliest miracles in brother
[1:09:00] bram's Ministry she was a woman who had
[1:09:03] TB there was no cure for it at that
[1:09:05] time and she had as actually as a little
[1:09:08] girl and and there are people you can
[1:09:11] find testimonies on the internet of
[1:09:12] people who knew her who who were not
[1:09:14] even Believers but who testified to that
[1:09:17] miracle and she was as a little girl she
[1:09:20] became bedridden and she was there as a
[1:09:22] young woman for nine years she was
[1:09:26] bedridden and she weighed somewhere
[1:09:28] between 40 and 60 pounds something like
[1:09:30] that and she was just a little sticks
[1:09:34] for legs and
[1:09:35] arms and she you know she was just
[1:09:38] barely hanging on and she couldn't get
[1:09:41] up she couldn't they brother brand said
[1:09:43] they couldn't even they had to lift her
[1:09:44] up to change the
[1:09:46] sheets because she couldn't even raise
[1:09:48] herself from the bed brother Brandon
[1:09:51] went and prayed for her he actually
[1:09:53] prayed for her twice and there's a long
[1:09:54] story associated with that but when he
[1:09:57] prayed for her the second time she got
[1:10:00] up out of her bed and she walked to the
[1:10:04] piano and began playing the piano and
[1:10:06] brother Brandon would tell that story he
[1:10:08] said she's my piano player at the mtown
[1:10:10] Baptist Church which is a little church
[1:10:12] that brother brandham come to one day
[1:10:14] and knocked on the door and there was no
[1:10:15] one there brother brandham actually
[1:10:17] opened a church in miltown Indiana and
[1:10:20] become the Midtown Baptist Church but
[1:10:22] that church that was there the building
[1:10:25] was already already there but he he
[1:10:26] reopened it but but here that miracle
[1:10:29] that happened it brought many people
[1:10:32] brought many people to God and some of
[1:10:35] them he said ask about Georgie Carter
[1:10:38] how did she walk brother brandom because
[1:10:40] he said it was impossible for her
[1:10:42] physically to walk how did she walk I
[1:10:45] said the power of the Living God held
[1:10:49] her up she just come listen
[1:10:53] submitted to the power of God
[1:10:56] now come on church sometimes we we
[1:10:58] wonder what's wrong why we don't get
[1:10:59] anything out of the services we wonder
[1:11:01] why sometimes the service seems like
[1:11:03] service after service say well I I have
[1:11:05] this need and I never got anything and
[1:11:06] maybe we're just holding on like Abraham
[1:11:08] and it could be but maybe we're just
[1:11:10] haven't completely submitted ourselves
[1:11:12] to the will of God yet right and if it
[1:11:16] is that maybe tonight could be the night
[1:11:18] you see it doesn't have to be a great
[1:11:19] big uh Revival or a meeting but tonight
[1:11:22] could be the night that I just fully
[1:11:24] submit myself to the word of God and
[1:11:26] when I do look what can happen I can
[1:11:28] have power that I didn't have to raise
[1:11:30] myself up Sir she had the power to raise
[1:11:34] herself up simply because she
[1:11:36] submitted to the power of God he said
[1:11:40] that's what's the trouble friends he
[1:11:41] said at night time when you see me your
[1:11:43] brother under Vision that's nothing else
[1:11:45] in the world but submitting myself to
[1:11:48] the Holy Spirit oh church when you look
[1:11:51] at that great gift and or great thing
[1:11:53] that was in brother brandom's life and
[1:11:54] you look at the calling that he had he
[1:11:56] said the only way I can operate that is
[1:11:57] by submission he said you that sick can
[1:12:01] submit yourself how many sick we got
[1:12:03] here tonight you got some illness in
[1:12:05] your body there's there's several of you
[1:12:07] I I think all of all of us old people
[1:12:09] could say that we're sick most of the
[1:12:11] time but but that's he said he said you
[1:12:14] sick people he said can submit yourself
[1:12:16] to the holy spirit so completely that
[1:12:20] you'll forget your
[1:12:22] sickness Hallelujah you can comp
[1:12:25] completely submit yourself to the Holy
[1:12:28] Ghost and no Affliction can hold
[1:12:33] you you thought I was going to talk
[1:12:35] about husbands and wives tonight didn't
[1:12:37] you I'm talking about submitting to God
[1:12:40] you can so completely oh church that's
[1:12:43] what I want to be every time I'm in the
[1:12:44] Pulpit every time I come and talk to
[1:12:46] somebody every time I get up in the
[1:12:48] morning I want to be brother Jeremy I
[1:12:50] want to be so full of the holy spirit so
[1:12:52] submitted to his will wherever he tells
[1:12:54] me to go I'll go whatever he tells me to
[1:12:57] do I'll do let me submit subordinate my
[1:13:00] own thoughts my own thinking to the
[1:13:02] thoughts of God he said you can be so so
[1:13:06] submitted to the Holy Ghost no

[1:13:10] by the power of the Holy Ghost you're
[1:13:11] well you give your testimony everything
[1:13:13] else you're healed by the power of the
[1:13:15] Holy

[1:13:25] Gamble and do things like that you'd say
[1:13:28] I can't give them up brother
[1:13:30] brandom huh you sit there at night late

[1:14:10] presence of God and you can submit
[1:14:12] yourself to God and yield your whole
[1:14:14] self to God and watch what takes place

[1:14:22] what's going on in the church submit
[1:14:24] your yourself to God one time and watch
[1:14:29] what takes place he said there's no
[1:14:31] secret in it it's not a Hocus Pocus see
[1:14:34] we don't have to work ourselves up into
[1:14:35] a frenzy we don't have to get all
[1:14:37] excited and run around the church that's
[1:14:39] wonderful if we do but let's do it
[1:14:41] because God's moving not not to try to
[1:14:43] make God watch us or see us no he
[1:14:45] already sees us he already cares he's
[1:14:48] already looking at your condition he
[1:14:50] just wants you to submit yourself to his
[1:14:53] word hallelujah he said that's the whole
[1:14:56] thing there's no secret in it it's not a
[1:14:57] Hocus Pocus the only thing it is is
[1:15:00] submit yourself to
[1:15:03] God hallelujah he said listen friends
[1:15:06] don't come saying well now if I feel
[1:15:08] real
[1:15:09] cold at one time they thought that was a
[1:15:11] sign of the Holy Spirit what it is is
[1:15:13] the air conditioner
[1:15:16] here well the Harvey's real cold right
[1:15:18] now I
[1:15:21] imagine but that's not because
[1:15:24] necessarily because because of the Holy
[1:15:25] Spirit you say the Holy Spirit could do
[1:15:26] that absolutely but that's not what we
[1:15:28] look for you come saying well if I feel
[1:15:31] real cold and if I get it the way sister
[1:15:33] got it he said that way sister got it
[1:15:35] don't you look for it that way you just
[1:15:38] come with a pure heart believing that
[1:15:40] Jesus Christ is the savior and you've
[1:15:42] accepted him and you believe God will
[1:15:45] keep his word and you're looking to
[1:15:46] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:15:48] he'll give it to you how many believe
[1:15:50] that tonight he'll give it to you if
[1:15:52] you're looking to receive it you say
[1:15:54] Lord I I'll just anyway you pour it into
[1:15:56] me just so I get the Holy Ghost that's
[1:15:59] all I want is the baptism of the Holy
[1:16:01] Ghost give me something that will take
[1:16:03] this selfishness away give me something
[1:16:06] that will take all this fear and
[1:16:07] doubting away he said my Lord don't make
[1:16:10] me he said if you make me shout I've
[1:16:12] seen others shout and didn't live it
[1:16:13] don't make me speak with tongues Lord
[1:16:15] I've seen others speak with tongues and
[1:16:16] didn't live it but Lord put something in
[1:16:19] me that'll live in me that'll make me
[1:16:20] walk every day as a Christian is that
[1:16:22] your desire tonight he said that'll make
[1:16:25] me love my enemies yeah all right if you
[1:16:29] can't love your enemies it's a lack of
[1:16:30] the Holy Ghost
[1:16:32] yeah right that's right you say well I I
[1:16:35] got the Holy Ghost I know I was baptized
[1:16:37] the Holy Ghost but you need a refilling
[1:16:38] then till you love your
[1:16:41] enemies said that'll make me speak good
[1:16:43] of those who speak evil of me that'll
[1:16:46] make me ready to repent of anything that
[1:16:48] I do wrong come right up and confess it
[1:16:51] I'll say I'm wrong forgive me God he
[1:16:54] said that's the kind of Spirit you want
[1:16:55] isn't it he said yes sir make me humble
[1:16:58] when my pastor sees something wrong in
[1:17:00] me he walks around and says now brother
[1:17:01] or sister you ought not do these things
[1:17:04] make me humble say yes my brother you
[1:17:07] help me now to pray I don't want that
[1:17:09] kind of spirit on me he said you don't
[1:17:11] want that kind of a spirit do you you
[1:17:13] don't want to go around with a puff up
[1:17:14] saying well huh he had no business
[1:17:16] telling me I know where I'm standing oh
[1:17:19] he said oh when you do that friends you
[1:17:20] can see right then you're not you're out
[1:17:22] of the will of God you can see you're
[1:17:23] wrong to begin with why you didn't
[1:17:26] subordinate yourself to
[1:17:29] God you say Lord I can't see it but
[1:17:32] maybe there's something
[1:17:35] there I'll go check it out right you
[1:17:38] don't have to you don't have to uh do
[1:17:41] things that aren't in the word of God
[1:17:42] but submit yourself to the
[1:17:44] word right he said why not be humble and
[1:17:48] submit yourself to the Holy Spirit some
[1:17:49] of our young folks you know sometimes
[1:17:52] you just have to be told and there's no
[1:17:54] other way to know unless somebody tells
[1:17:56] you and you can't get mad at somebody
[1:17:58] for telling you right that's the only
[1:18:00] way you're going to know you have to
[1:18:02] learn right and so I would say just look
[1:18:04] at it like this Lord help me to be
[1:18:05] humble help me not to to to respond in a
[1:18:09] way that that that well I think well I
[1:18:12] just discount that that was just that
[1:18:13] guy but Lord help me to help me to
[1:18:16] examine myself and see is there's
[1:18:19] something there why not be humble and
[1:18:21] submit yourself to the Holy Spirit yes
[1:18:23] I'm going to lock armed with the whole
[1:18:25] Church of the Living God I'm going to
[1:18:28] move on with the whole Church of the
[1:18:30] Living God I'm going to move
[1:18:33] on Hallelujah brother BR said God could
[1:18:36] ever get a man or woman today in this
[1:18:37] Tabernacle or anywhere else that's us
[1:18:40] tonight anywhere else that'll pay no
[1:18:42] attention to what's going on around them
[1:18:44] but submit themselves to the Lord as an
[1:18:47] individual
[1:18:48] unit right then that don't matter what
[1:18:50] everybody else does but for me in my
[1:18:53] house I'm going to submit myself to the
[1:18:56] word of God that's what Abraham had to
[1:18:58] do when lot left him when everybody
[1:19:00] around him left him he said I'm going to
[1:19:02] submit myself to the word I believe even
[1:19:04] though the years get longer and longer I
[1:19:06] believe I'm going to have a baby cuz God
[1:19:08] said so he submitted himself to the word
[1:19:11] and that was identified as faith in his
[1:19:13] life he said God could ever get a man or
[1:19:16] woman in this Tabernacle or anywhere
[1:19:17] else that'll pay no attention what's
[1:19:19] going on around them is submit
[1:19:20] themselves to the Lord as an individual
[1:19:22] unit God will lead the same man to today
[1:19:25] that he led then he said he proves that
[1:19:28] he's with us hallelujah what we need
[1:19:31] today is a humble submitted life submit
[1:19:36] yourself church when we when somebody
[1:19:39] criticizes us where our first our first
[1:19:41] answer isn't to hit back at them but to
[1:19:43] say Lord help me to examine myself and
[1:19:46] see is that right if it's not I'll just
[1:19:48] let it go but if it is right help me to
[1:19:51] correct myself because I want to be
[1:19:53] right said well I'll wait and find out
[1:19:56] what this is and he said what he said I
[1:19:58] mean back up a little bit he said submit
[1:20:00] yourself don't don't squeeze yourself
[1:20:02] back don't do nothing but lead straight
[1:20:05] with the Holy Spirit what the spirit
[1:20:07] says do do
[1:20:09] quickly you know why because you may not
[1:20:11] ever get another opportunity to do
[1:20:14] it if the Holy Spirit leads you to do
[1:20:16] something do it
[1:20:17] quickly right make sure it's the Holy
[1:20:19] Spirit but if he leads you to do it do
[1:20:21] it quickly don't say well I'll wait and
[1:20:24] find out what this is and that is what
[1:20:26] the holy spirit says do go do
[1:20:29] it he said what if I hadn't went to
[1:20:31] Finland when the Holy Spirit called me
[1:20:32] over there what if I hadn't went to the
[1:20:35] hospital yesterday that little baby was
[1:20:37] laying there dying hadn't
[1:20:39] went and I love the fact that this is
[1:20:42] before brother brandham goes beyond the
[1:20:44] curtain of time but when he does they
[1:20:47] tell him this they said if you hadn't
[1:20:49] have went we wouldn't be
[1:20:52] here oh Church we don't realize what
[1:20:55] obeying the Holy Ghost can do just
[1:20:58] obeying the holy ghost in a service just
[1:21:00] to to say Amen to lift our hands to
[1:21:03] worship God to do what God says do maybe
[1:21:05] to come to an altar maybe you don't need
[1:21:07] to be saved maybe you don't even need to
[1:21:09] be filled but there's something in your
[1:21:10] heart drawing you to come to the Altar
[1:21:12] and you come what it might break open
[1:21:14] the whole service why because there's a
[1:21:16] power in obedience brother Brandon said
[1:21:19] obedience is better than sacrifice do
[1:21:22] what the holy spirit says do yes
[1:21:25] yes how many of us could use more peace
[1:21:27] in our
[1:21:30] lives well the rest of you doing good
[1:21:32] I'm going come to your
[1:21:35] house we live in a chaotic
[1:21:39] age listen what brother brandham says
[1:21:41] about that he said what a peaceful day
[1:21:43] it'll be for the brandham
[1:21:46] Tabernacle or any other church or any
[1:21:51] individual when they'll forfeit their
[1:21:53] rights
[1:21:55] to become a
[1:21:56] lamb come back to a lamb come back to be
[1:22:00] gentle come back to know nothing that's
[1:22:04] hard to do isn't it knowing everything
[1:22:06] we know about the message but knowled
[1:22:08] knowing the message is not going to get
[1:22:09] you in right you don't get a free go to
[1:22:12] jail free or get out of jail free card
[1:22:15] you go to jail free you can't get out of
[1:22:16] jail free you don't get a get out of
[1:22:18] jail free card get out of hell free card
[1:22:20] because you because you uh know more
[1:22:23] about the message message and everybody
[1:22:25] else that's not how it works the devil
[1:22:27] knows the scriptures all right he knows
[1:22:29] this message he wouldn't be able to
[1:22:30] twist it like he does all right he knows
[1:22:33] the message he knows the scriptures but
[1:22:35] what is it he can't submit himself to it
[1:22:38] oh church he said don't try to know
[1:22:40] nothing he said just walk me meekly
[1:22:43] quietly humbly gently and the dove will
[1:22:46] lead you he said but whenever you go to
[1:22:48] listening to that gossip whenever you go
[1:22:50] to getting that temper up when it's
[1:22:53] amazing what we I identify as godliness
[1:22:55] and it's not at all all right just
[1:22:58] temper yeah all
[1:23:00] right you so I had a man say one time
[1:23:03] said I'm like Moses I smoked the Rock
[1:23:05] and Moses didn't enter the promised land
[1:23:07] because of it
[1:23:09] too Jesus was the only one who ever did
[1:23:12] something like that he took the Whip and
[1:23:14] and fogged them but I've said it before
[1:23:15] I'll say it again if I tried to do that
[1:23:17] I'd be in the
[1:23:18] flesh there'd be somebody there I fogged
[1:23:21] a little bit
[1:23:22] harder than everybody else but Jesus
[1:23:26] didn't do that he did what the father
[1:23:28] told him to do he never sinned because
[1:23:31] he was perfect amen I'm not perfect and
[1:23:35] so I'm not going to blame it on God when
[1:23:36] I get
[1:23:37] mad are you are you listening to me now
[1:23:40] whenever you go to thinking you got a
[1:23:41] right to do this and do that the dove
[1:23:43] just takes their flight and goes on away
[1:23:45] he said then you don't have it anymore
[1:23:47] right that's a striking statement but
[1:23:50] your life is as if the Holy Spirit was
[1:23:52] not there it's not that he leaves you
[1:23:54] but brother brand said he waits in the

[1:25:11] subordinate to Christ old lamb walk

[1:25:44] and light he runs oh it's easy to get to
[1:25:47] church the next service why he let all
[1:25:49] his rights be shaved off oh church
[1:25:52] that's what we need you say well I want
[1:25:53] my rights no I want his rights I want to

[1:26:05] from shear it all off how cool and light
[1:26:07] he runs my my he's happy jumps around
[1:26:11] and has a big
[1:26:13] time it's hard church it's hard to to
[1:26:17] you said out here in the world I saw a
[1:26:19] person the world's gone
[1:26:21] crazy we saw a person riding a bike
[1:26:23] today and Peter told me he said that I
[1:26:25] couldn't tell if it was a man or a woman
[1:26:27] Peter said that's a boy he said he come
[1:26:30] to my class when I was in high school
[1:26:31] wearing a
[1:26:32] dress and I and my first thought I can
[1:26:35] honestly say today and sometimes it's
[1:26:37] not God forgive me but my first thought
[1:26:39] today was to have compassion on the kid
[1:26:42] probably Peter's
[1:26:44] age and I thought you know just the
[1:26:47] world that we live in they don't even
[1:26:48] have a
[1:26:51] chance and you know what could help them
[1:26:54] yeah but they won't listen to laugh you
[1:26:56] out of the
[1:26:58] room church we don't want to be like
[1:27:01] that so arrogant that we think we know
[1:27:04] what's best for us God knows what's best
[1:27:06] for
[1:27:07] us he knows what he knows it's best for
[1:27:10] us to lay down on the table but we fight
[1:27:14] it and that's how we end up in those
[1:27:15] kind of situations that's how the world
[1:27:18] ends up in that kind of situation not
[1:27:20] because they don't know not because they
[1:27:22] never heard the gospel many times but
[1:27:23] because because they refuse to submit to
[1:27:26] the gospel and the world has refused to
[1:27:28] submit to the gospel and I say today
[1:27:31] it'd be worse actually to be in church
[1:27:34] and be somebody maybe you look good on
[1:27:36] the outside but you got a hard heart I'm
[1:27:39] preaching to myself tonight but I I'm
[1:27:41] preaching to all of us you got a hard
[1:27:43] heart and you're unwilling to submit to
[1:27:45] God's word you'd be better off to be out
[1:27:48] there and have never
[1:27:50] known than to be in here and be hard
[1:27:52] about it all right I say God help us
[1:27:55] tonight yes I don't want to be hard I
[1:27:58] want to submit myself to God yes amen he
[1:28:03] said you become a he said Ma's happy and
[1:28:06] jumps around has a big time yes sir if
[1:28:09] you'll forfeit your rights that's what
[1:28:10] you get but you got to forfeit your
[1:28:12] rights let the word of God shave all the
[1:28:14] world off of you take all the habits of
[1:28:16] the world away you become a new creature
[1:28:19] in
[1:28:20] Christ brother BR said to know the
[1:28:22] word's not life but to know him is life
[1:28:25] to know him you don't have to be a
[1:28:27] scholar you have to be a submitted
[1:28:29] person I know and we're going to have a
[1:28:31] questions and answers at some point
[1:28:33] because I know some of the things I
[1:28:34] preach on is hard for the young people
[1:28:36] to grasp and I don't want it to be that
[1:28:38] way I want you to understand what I'm
[1:28:40] saying maybe sometimes I say things
[1:28:42] wrong I realize that I do that but if I
[1:28:44] do and you have a question just write
[1:28:46] that into me I'd be glad to try to
[1:28:48] answer that the very best that I can
[1:28:50] maybe we'll gather some of them up and
[1:28:52] answer them because other people may
[1:28:53] have the same
[1:28:54] question but but now he he talks about
[1:28:59] uh being submitted to Christ and to know
[1:29:01] him it's not what you know whether or
[1:29:04] not you can understand everything we
[1:29:05] talk about whether you know the ins and
[1:29:07] outs of the third poll whether you know
[1:29:09] the ins and outs of the Seven Seals
[1:29:11] that's not what gets you closer to God
[1:29:13] what gets you closer to God is actually
[1:29:16] your submission to the word of God it's
[1:29:19] what you do know so Mark Twain said he
[1:29:21] said it's not the parts I don't
[1:29:23] understand about the Bible give me
[1:29:24] trouble he said it's the parts I do
[1:29:26] understand right it's the ones we don't
[1:29:28] submit to that's what gives us trouble
[1:29:31] brother brandom said you have to be a
[1:29:33] submitted person when you submit
[1:29:34] yourself to Christ Christ is obligated
[1:29:37] to fill that vacancy that you poured out
[1:29:41] on the altar to him so don't think you
[1:29:43] won't have anything when you leave but
[1:29:44] he's obligated to feel that
[1:29:47] vacancy he said he's obligated to fill
[1:29:50] that vacancy that you poured out on the
[1:29:51] altar to him he's obligated to his word
[1:29:53] to do it I love this he will not fail
[1:29:56] you how many believe that tonight you
[1:29:58] can say I know he will never fail me he
[1:30:02] will not fail
[1:30:03] you Hallelujah he wants to partner with
[1:30:07] you he wants to be one with you brother
[1:30:10] Brown said the greatest thing I've ever
[1:30:11] seen in my life is just submit yourself
[1:30:13] to God and walk in the spirit see just
[1:30:16] day after day how he will lead you and
[1:30:18] do things the Bible says to be carnally
[1:30:21] minded is death but to be spiritually
[1:30:22] minded is life and peace because the
[1:30:26] carnal mind is enmity it's enemies of
[1:30:29] God it's enmity against God it's
[1:30:30] fighting with God right he said and it
[1:30:34] is not subject to that same word submit
[1:30:36] it's not in submission to the law of God
[1:30:39] neither indeed can be right so then they
[1:30:43] that in the flesh cannot please God yeah
[1:30:46] so how can I please God then how did
[1:30:47] Noah please God by faith yes how did
[1:30:50] Abraham please God by faith yes sir the
[1:30:53] BR said Abra if you can catch it he had
[1:30:55] faith in God which United the spirit of
[1:30:58] God with the Flesh of man right I love
[1:31:02] that it's so simple but faith is what
[1:31:04] unites the spirit of God with the Flesh
[1:31:07] of man he said there's where the faith
[1:31:10] come there's why he could be the Abraham
[1:31:12] SE said not all flesh but the uniting of
[1:31:15] spirit and flesh together god making
[1:31:18] himself tearing out rooting out all evil
[1:31:21] don't you want that tonight bringing in
[1:31:23] into submission the flesh the dust that
[1:31:26] he created and live with you as a
[1:31:31] partner oh church that's what I want
[1:31:34] that's what I want I want I want him to
[1:31:36] live with I I can't make it on my own I
[1:31:38] can't be in submission the carnal mind
[1:31:41] cannot submit itself to God but if I
[1:31:45] have his Spirit if I believe that that
[1:31:49] brings the spirit and the flesh together
[1:31:50] the uniting of the spirit and the flesh
[1:31:53] until I'm in submission until there's a
[1:31:55] control tower in my soul that tells me
[1:31:58] what to do and I learn to obey it even
[1:32:01] Jesus learned obedience by the things he
[1:32:03] suffered I wonder if we couldn't learn a
[1:32:05] little bit of
[1:32:07] obedience he come to the world sinless
[1:32:10] and he never sinned while he was in it
[1:32:13] oh church yet he learned
[1:32:16] obedience by the things he suffered I
[1:32:20] don't think we ought to kick too hard
[1:32:21] against the Pricks say Lord I submit
[1:32:24] myself to you I you said brother Ben you
[1:32:27] don't know what I've been through well
[1:32:28] none of us know really what the other
[1:32:29] ones been through right but we know who
[1:32:32] God
[1:32:33] is we know who Elohim is we know who the
[1:32:36] creator of the universe is and if we
[1:32:38] submit ourselves to him he'll take care
[1:32:41] of us yes it'll be
[1:32:44] okay as the musicians come in 1873 there
[1:32:47] was a lady by the name of Phoebe nap
[1:32:50] played a tune for Fanny Crosby who was
[1:32:52] blind
[1:32:54] she asked her she said 'what does this
[1:32:56] music say to
[1:32:58] you and Fanny Crosby was submitted to
[1:33:03] the spirit of
[1:33:05] God and she
[1:33:08] immediately and she remember she's blind
[1:33:11] she had it hard in life they her and her
[1:33:13] husband were both blind they lost a baby
[1:33:15] because they couldn't see and it got
[1:33:17] covered up by blankets and died that's
[1:33:21] tough be hard to get over that but she
[1:33:24] was submitted to the Holy Spirit and she
[1:33:27] said' whatat does this music say to you
[1:33:28] and Fanny Crosby immediately says
[1:33:30] Blessed assurance Jesus is mine oh what
[1:33:34] a foretaste of Glory Divine heir of
[1:33:37] Salvation purchase of God born of his
[1:33:41] Spirit washed in his
[1:33:44] blood what was that submission to the
[1:33:46] will of God for her
[1:33:48] life oh my one time she said if I could
[1:33:50] get my eyes back she said if I was
[1:33:52] offered my eyesight wouldn't take it
[1:33:55] because I wouldn't be who I am oh Church
[1:33:59] she looked at it as a blessing in the
[1:34:02] end perfect submission is the next verse
[1:34:05] perfect Delight visions of rapture now
[1:34:10] burst on my sight a blind woman but she
[1:34:12] was seeing with some other
[1:34:14] sense beyond the five senses beyond the
[1:34:17] Sens of sight Angels descending bring
[1:34:20] from above Echoes of Mercy Whispers of
[1:34:24] Love perfect submission all is at rest I
[1:34:29] in my savior am happy and blessed
[1:34:32] watching and waiting looking above
[1:34:34] filled with his goodness lost in his
[1:34:36] love and she cried out this is my story
[1:34:39] this is my song praising My Savior all
[1:34:43] the day
[1:34:44] long she could do that can't we do that
[1:34:47] tonight can't we submit ourselves as the
[1:34:50] scripture says to the father of lights
[1:34:52] and live
[1:34:54] you hold on to that Grudge you'll die
[1:34:57] hold on them rights you
[1:34:59] die you get too hot you won't be able to
[1:35:03] make it you'll just fall over but if
[1:35:05] you'll just let yourself be sheared of
[1:35:08] those things say this is my story I'm
[1:35:12] going to I'm determined to to repeat
[1:35:15] what God says about me no matter what
[1:35:17] circumstances going on in my life I
[1:35:20] wonder if there's anybody like that here
[1:35:21] tonight I I'm determined
[1:35:24] not to give in to the moly grubs I'm
[1:35:27] determined not to give in to what Satan
[1:35:30] is whispering in my ear I'm determined
[1:35:32] why perfect submission brings me to a
[1:35:36] place that I can hear from God and God
[1:35:39] will tell me you are my the heir of
[1:35:43] Salvation the purchase of God born of
[1:35:46] his Spirit washing his blood they we
[1:35:49] play that softly while we bow our heads
[1:35:52] together
[1:35:55] [Music]
[1:35:59] oh
[1:36:01] [Music]
[1:36:05] God looking at that boy today and I
[1:36:07] thought oh if I could
[1:36:08] only tell
[1:36:12] him there's a God who can change
[1:36:16] you but people don't they don't want to
[1:36:19] hear the fact it becomes hate speech if
[1:36:23] you tell them you need to
[1:36:25] [Music]
[1:36:29] change it becomes a a culture where the
[1:36:32] word of God is absent submission to God
[1:36:35] is rare but let me be the outlier
[1:36:39] tonight let me be one who can who can
[1:36:42] say I believe help thou my
[1:36:45] unbelief and I believe Lord that you
[1:36:48] want to unite yourself with me and in
[1:36:51] doing that I can be your servant and I
[1:36:54] can submit myself to others submit
[1:36:57] myself to church and and when you go to
[1:36:59] church I'm not telling you to submit
[1:37:00] yourself to me as a person but when you

[1:37:03] yourself to that church and that Pastor
[1:37:06] when you go into the deacons and the
[1:37:08] leadership of the church when you when
[1:37:10] you believe this message you're

[1:37:14] the message of the hour when you're a
[1:37:16] Christian you're submitting yourself to
[1:37:18] the leadership of Christ that's what we
[1:37:22] really want cuz everyone else can be be
[1:37:23] wrong but Christ will never be wrong
[1:37:26] always be right Heavenly
