ask in jesus' name amen how many's happy to be in the house of the Lord this afternoon amen good to see each and every one of you here and and I'll try to not hold you too long been took some of my time this morning so uh I'll try to be I'll try to be short well you can laugh it's okay last week he gave me extra time and I took it and tonight I'll try to give it back if you have your Bibles let's turn to Hebrews chapter 12 and verse one Hebrews 12 and 1 I hope y'all can help me today a little bit because I I need all the help I can get if you'll pull real fast I'll uh I'll try to I'll try to go fast and quit early and so if I go too long you'll know it's not my fault but yours so with that with that already said y'all y'all are really going to pull now I can just see it on your faces praise the Lord Hebrews chapter 12 and verse one wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which doth so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the Throne of God and in John chapter 4 very familiar reading John Chapter 4: 2 John 4:25 this is Jesus uh talking at to the woman at the well brother Brandon references this many many times and when I had this thought this evening come to me or yesterday when it came to me I was thinking uh I was thinking about this and what was she looking for when he appeared and Jesus would say it like this or the woman would say it like this the woman saith unto him I know that Messiah cometh which is called Christ when he is come he will tell us all things Jesus saith unto her I that speak unto thee am he and upon this came his disciples and marveled that he talked with the woman yet no man said what seekest thou or why talkest thou with her the woman then left her water pot and went her way into the City and saith to the men come see a man which told me all the things that ever I did is not this the Christ and if I could title this this evening what are you looking for you may be seated or what are you looking at what are you looking to every one of us are looking uh for something every one of us every one of us are looking at something if you're looking up here right now you're not looking at much but uh you know every every one of us are have we have to be looking at something we have to be looking forward to something and the Bible tells us there that we are uh we are looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith and if if you're looking at anything else I would say that you're looking uh in the wrong way you're looking at the wrong thing because in this day there's going to be distractions in this day there's going to be a lot of voices to distract you there's going to be a lot of uh different preachers there's going to be a lot of different things uh that will man something just happened to these mics I hope that's okay I don't know what happened but I just heard it ring up here real bad so y'all just bear with me I'm not sure what's going on in the back but it's uh it's hot right now so in this age of distractions that was a distraction Hallelujah that was a distraction I heard that thing ring so loud about blew my eardrum out in this age of distractions and so much entertainment you know we forget to keep our eyes is focused on Christ even in Christmas season uh you know we all I love this time of year for family and things like that it is a controversial time of year but you know it also is a time when you can really focus in on the birth of Christ and that's what we're supposed to do uh the world has made it with its tinsil and its glitter and it's about everything but Christ and yet and yet we are looking to what the main reason for Christmas was was not just a baby and a Manger but it was Christ that would come and become one of us can you say Amen so that we could actually uh that that we could actually take on his spirit and we could actually become him so he became us I believe it was brother Donnie that wrote the song he became me so that I could become him aren't you glad he became us aren't you be glad aren't you glad he became simple and humble and and just a baby just something that we could relate with us he was tempted in all like manner as we are but if you're looking to just the flesh you miss uh you miss everything about why he came he didn't come just to live he didn't come just to die but he came so that he could actually send his spirit and actually make a body on earth that could live out and do the very works that he did so we we've got to watch what we're looking for we've got to watch what we're what we're looking at and we don't want to ever get caught up and if you look at the messenger many times you look at the messenger and you forget to look at the message that he brought can you say Amen tonight amen we look at the messenger we think well the messenger did this and the messenger did that and we look at the Flesh of the man and we completely forget to look at what God was sending in our generation we're we're looking at the wrong thing so don't ever get your eyes on a man brother Brandon would say don't look at me but look to the message amen amen we believe that God doesn't doesn't send a a man to uh to to bring the message that wouldn't be worthy to bring it but yet uh many times we're looking at the wrong thing because we're looking at the mistakes of the man or we're looking at the humanity of the man but remember if you're looking at the humanity then even Jesus himself you could say he wasn't Divine because that woman would tell brother brandom said she said I could prove by the scriptures he wasn't Divine when he was Weeping at his friend's grave but brother Brandon would say it like this he said he was a he was a man when he was weeping for his friend but when he pulled them shoulders back and and he called a man that was dead four days from the grave that was more than a man so quit looking at the humanity tonight and start looking at the word when you start looking at the humanity you see faults and you see failures and you see men that can't live nothing listen without him we're nothing without him we can't stand here and preach the gospel without him your marriage is never going to make it without him your children can't be saved but we're looking to Jesus who is the author and the finisher of our faith and then we're not looking for something new in this hour but we're looking to the message that has already come to call out a bride come on Church we're looking to what a message has to the message that has come and that message just to call us and get us ready for something we're not looking to go back to 1963 or back to 1947 we're not looking to go back back and and have a Prophet come and reveal more things to us no it's already been sent it's already been revealed the message has come it's time we look at the message and get ready for the soon appearing of Christ can you say amen Amen brother Brandon would say it like this he said he said look unto me all the ends of the Earth and he was quoting Isaiah 45:22 and he said now when the Earth has come to its end or the system of the Earth has come to its ends let the people look unto him can you say amen and he said now you might say we have heard this generation after generation we've heard this for a long time he said that is true and it's been preached for a long time many ministers has taken this same text and thousands of them but here's the thing I want to ask you tonight for the next few minutes he said when you look the question is what do you see when you look what do you see when you do look he said that only depends on what you're looking for so if you're looking at all the men that have come and all the men that have gone and every all the men that have failed you or all the men that are going to fail you listen all you're going to see is failure but if you're looking to him you're to see a promise of a soon coming amen if you're looking to him you're going to see more than just a man that has failed you if you're looking to him you're going to see more than Humanity that can't even live nothing but what you're going to see is a man standing here tonight who is not here on his own ability but he is here because God has called me to stand here and preach the unsearchable riches of Christ and I'm going to tell you tonight it's not my ability that I can stand here and preach the gospel with but I can stand here and tell you it's all about him amen I'm not don't look to me I'm your brother I can fail you but look to him and he alone is worthy to reveal the word of your heart he alone is worthy of all the praise we can give him he alone is worthy to open the seals in our day he alone was worthy to give you what you listen church I think we need to go ahead and just tell him he's worthy of our praise tonight our young people he's worthy of our praise tonight he's not he's not listen he never failed you and he never will fail you he's never lost the battle so why would he lose one now I just go ahead and tell you we need to look to him all the ends of the Earth because he is coming he's coming back and I believe it with all my heart well the church just needs to get ready listen this morning what you was hearing was not a sermon just a just a just to preach a sermon but he was telling you amen we've got to line up with something in order to be ready for his soon coming amen we've got to hear those messages like that a pastor has to come in here and be a pastor why because those things are to get you ready for the Rapture that is coming are you looking for a rapture then the Rapture is ready for you listen we are to become the Rapture and be in the process of a Rapture and then we will be caught up to meet him right see we've let ourselves go ahead and say Well when that great event happens I'll be ready no we are becoming now Sons and Daughters of God we are now being placed we are now getting ready for a Rapture if you wait till then to get ready for the Rapture the Rapture is going to come and the Rapture is going to pass but I'm looking now for a Rapture I'm looking now for a body change what are you looking for tonight church I'm not looking for a new job or I'm not looking for a bigger church or more members but I'm looking for God to do what he already promised to do well can you say Amen tonight brother Randon would say it like this Moses lifted the serpent up and every who looks got healed it depends on what you're looking for oh yeah it depends on what you're looking for if you're not looking for the message to be right listen I want to just go ahead and say this while I'm here if you're looking for the faults and the mistakes in the message you're going to find faults and mistakes in the message if you're looking for fault F and mistakes in your pastor you're going to find faults and mistakes in your pastor if you're looking for faults and mistakes in the church members you're going to find faults in the church members well can you say man if you're looking for problems with somebody that sit next to you they got problems if you're looking for somebody if your brother David if you're looking at that person that's not there tonight but whoever would normally sit by you if you're looking for somebody and you start to look at them and you say well that person really needs what the preacher's preaching tonight you know I say what we're doing we're looking at the wrong thing I need I I need what God has for me in this service my my neighbor needs something but but more than anything it's me oh Lord standing in the need of prayer it's me it's not my brother it's not my sister but I need a renewing of my mind I need a renewing in my spirit I need a Revival in my life I need something to get a hold of me to where I can look to him again on and quit looking at the problems in the church or quit looking to the problems of the young people I come on somebody you you you look at all these young people just wait till they're 16 years old old then you can start talking about problems that's right but if you just look at the problems you never see the promise that that young person can become a real Christian that young person can become a preacher's wife or that young man can become a preacher but quit looking at the false and start looking at a promise welome the church say Amen tonight brother B was talking about Elijah he said I still believe God he said I focused in on the word and I know that to be truth nobody has ever been able to shake me from it yet and as long as god holds my heart right straight on that word I'll stay there he said Elijah one day when he was looking for something to come to bring to help the people he looked and he looked till the old man 80s something years old was too tired to climb the mountain and after he' been fasting and praying but God told him if they would repent something would happen what was he looking he sent his servant up and said go up and look look something is going to happen three and a half years yeah and a half three years and a half and no rain not a cloud not even a dew falling but said go look and gahaz he stood and looked and looked and he looked and he didn't see nothing and he he come back down and he said I didn't see nothing and he goes back up and and he and he looks again and he said I didn't see nothing and Elijah that little man sitting there that little bald head s bald head sitting there in the Sun and his whiskers and his beard white beard and them little bony looking arms cross his bony knees and he said Lord God as he began to pray he said go back again now what was he doing he was looking for God to take care of his promise now look look look he didn't he didn't care that there was no rain he didn't care that there was no clouds but he knew that there was a promise of one to come and so he kept sending the servant saying go look again it wasn't in vain why because he knew that it was going to come and so he was go on like this now brother B would go on and he would say now we got different ideas we change it every now and then oh my said everything but don't look at that don't look at what they're doing now look to what he said here look to the Bible you look and live brother that's the only way you can he said sister too come on now he said if you can't receive this experience and know that it's exactly the Bible with God himself then there's no he said there's he said it's Vindicated don't take no chance with it now he said what are you looking at this morning what are you looking at did you stop in the in the Hideous hectic day that we're living in what are you looking for God has placed everything somebody say everything God has placed everything the troubling of the water that first little move and people jumped in and the sign of the hand in the sky and Elijah said that cloud the size of a man's hand like a vapor what was it he kept believing I hear the sound of abundance of rain that cloud become two clouds and two clouds become a hill and a hill become a mountain and the mountain become another mountain and the first thing you know the whole skies were thundering rain was falling what was it he accepted what God had said now he didn't give up when it looked like it wasn't going to come but the rains are going to fall anyway I say don't give up on our young people when it looks like that God's not dealing with them I believe the rain is going to fall on our young people I believe the rain's going to fall in our church services again I don't think we need to wait on something to happen but I believe we just accept the promise that I will pour out my spirit and I'm here to accept the pouring out of his Spirit I'm here to have a good time in church whether the people want to have a good time with me or not listen let me go and tell you tonight church I'm here because of a promise to come together and he would be in our midst is he here tonight I say if two or three are gathered even if you don't feel him he's here I'm not looking to your feeling I'm looking to his word I'm looking to his promise I'm not looking to how I feel today I may not feel like preaching today but I'm here because he said get in the Pulpit young men and preach this gospel until the coming of the Lord so I'm going to do what a prophet said and you're going to go to church and you're going to hear the preaching of the Gospel why because that's what the prophet said to do look I'm not looking at the circumstances I'm not looking at the people have closed their doors and said we don't need Church no more I'm not looking at people said we don't need preaching no more I'm not looking to that I'm looking to what the word has told me to do I'm looking at the word has called me to do the word has called me to live a little higher than that the word has called me from the chicken pit I was in the word has called me from being a sick a sick bird out there in a chicken pin and he has called me to soar above all the problems that I can see with my eye I'm not going to get down there and associate with all them problems but I'm going to soar into the heavenlies and I'm going to go ahead and say you know what I'm going to pray for that brother that's Fallen instead of get over there like a bunch of chickens and pick on him what can you say Amen tonight I'm going to quit trying to put down my brother when I don't see something like he did I'm going to quit trying to to pick on somebody I'm going to start praying for them why I'm not looking at the circumstance I'm looking at the potential that that man is a promis Son of God I'm looking at the potential that that Pastor can be a pastor really on fire with God I'm looking at the potential that our young men that look like they're falling away are not going to fall away because they are one of God's children I'm looking at our young men here tonight and I can tell you with full belief and and faith in God that these men are not going to fall away but these are the Church of tomorrow these are the ministers if there's a minister tomorrow these are men of God if there's a if there's a tomorrow I'm going to goe and tell you tonight church we need to quit looking at the things that are bringing us down and start looking at things that are positive brother said don't look at these things like this always be looking at the positive listen I know there's Church problems that'll rise I know there's things that'll come up in this church I know there's things that'll come up in somebody else's church and you sure don't need to look at them well can you say Amen there's no reason for us to look at everybody else's problems there's no reason for us to look at my BR listen church this is just on my heart tonight but we get distracted by things that are going on around us that have no bearing on what but what we need that we don't even need to be involved in those situations but we get involved because we think that we can help them but the only person that can help them is Christ himself so I say tonight let somebody else over here if they're having a problem pray for them if they're having a bad day pray for him but ask for me in my house we're going to go to church and we're going to serve the Lord ask for me in my house we're not going to be caught up in the world of L to see him but we're going to serve God why because we're looking to a promise of his coming is that all right tonight what are we looking for what you're looking for is often what you'll get if you're looking for something good to happen in church something Good's going to happen in church come on if you're looking for a bad service you going have a bad service that's right that's true you heard Joel was preaching and you're thinking tonight it's going to be rough where it's going to be long quit thinking like that cuz nobody else wants that to happen either brother Brandon would say it like this he said remember you can only see him as you look at him through the word can the church say Amen you can look at him through a textbook or you can't look at him through a textbook you can't look at him through Creed you will see two or three gods and everything else in them Creeds but look at him through the word come on is that all right he said but look at him through the word and you'll see that he is Emmanuel God made flesh Among Us he said I am God and besides me there is none other is that all right tonight he is God and when Isaiah looked away from the world to see him he said I see a counselor a prince of peace the Mighty God the Everlasting father that's what Isaiah looked away and saw Daniel one time was standing there and he saw the end of the Gentile kingdoms that he saw the image that Nebuchadnezzar had dreamed and he saw how each one would succeed the other and as they come down and when he looked to see what was all going to happen at the end when he saw Jesus he was a stone hued out of the mountain without hands and that crushed the Gentile kingdoms Nebuchadnezzar throw three Hebrew children in the fiery furnace that believed in God and stood on his word and if they had to die forth they was going to stand anyhow and just a little thing of bowing their knees some other way but when he looked away and saw Jesus he was the fourth man that was in the fiery furnace and it kept all the heat off of his obedient servants oh sometimes we just need to look and he's right there amen we just need to look at Jesus and realize he's not that far away he's just as close as your right arm to you amen he's not just a Jesus that was with brother Brandon he's not just a Jesus that walked the shores of Galilee he's not just the Jesus that was in a Manger he's not just a Jesus that hung on the cross come on church but he's a Jesus that is here and he's living among us and he's dwelling inside of us and he's making you to act like sons of God and he's making you quit your lying and quit your stealing anden it's God and we need to start looking at him that is coming our day anden it wasn't a man that came in our day but it was Christ the word that came in our day so that we can become the very Sons and Daughters of God Amen it's the word living in us can you say Amen it's the word brother R would say Ezekiel Saw A Wheel in the middle of the wheel way up in the middle of the air he was the Hub to the wheel where where where every spoke is fastened to amen every spoke is fastened to the hub amen amen without that then it's a broken it's a Broken Spoke amen amen but if the spoke is connected to the hub then there's power there there's Authority there amen but if one of them spokes is out of alignment if one of them spokes is broken then there that that wheel is going to get all off balance and that's why you see people doing this and and and start teaching things around this time of the year and they have no balance to it what is it it's because they have got a spoke in the wheel that's been loosed but everything is tied to him every spoke is connected to him everything we teach is connected to the hub amen everything he is the wheel in the middle of the will he is the Hub that holds everything together amen listen church it's not my idea that's going to help you it's not brother Ben's idea that's going to help you but it is the word that is bringing everything into balance everything into focus it is not just a balance that you want to see am me a balance that you think brother brandom taught amen but it is a balance will because he is the center of that thing and if you're connected to him then nothing's going to shake you nothing can make you lose nothing can take you out why because you're connected to the whe in the middle of the wheel than I wish I could have preached on that I if I have thought of it I'd have had a sermon on that tonight amen he's the wheel in the middle of the wheel is that all right Amen brother bandom said the big wheel run by faith but the Little Wheel turned by the power of the Lord oh thank you Lord look he said that's who Ezekiel Saw when he looked away sir he man think about Noah's day when the people looked they saw a crazy old fanatic amen when the people looked what did they see this man is out here building a boat and it might be 100° and sunshine and not a single cloud in the sky but he's building it why because God said so am man he was connected to the wheel in the middle of the wheel you see what I'm saying tonight amen he wasn't worried about what the people said he was worried about what God said because God said he's going to get on that boat and be delivered amen and so we're not looking at what the world laughs at and says well you don't need to have that long hair you don't need to wear dresses or you don't need to quit your cussing or quit your smoking amen that's what the world tell you but what did God say about the situation man what did God tell you to do in this day are you connected to that word and that word is making you live out amen the revelation of this day well is that all right tonight amen we're looking at the we look at the children of Israel when they saw the Red Sea amen what did they see they saw death and destruction amen they saw Pharaoh's Army closing in they were looking at that but when when when Moses looked and saw that Pillar of Fire amen he looked at something greater than what they saw amen I see destruction but the bride doesn't see see destruction amen the bride is looking and she sees a Rapture what can you say Amen tonight church amen I I I tell you we need to quit looking at the Doom and Gloom we need to quit looking at who's going down and destruction and start looking at the bride that's going up amen we need to start looking and say you know what it don't matter it don't matter about this world because this world's going down anyway amen but I'm not going to stay here I'm not going to be here when this world is blown to Pieces I'm not going to be here when it turns to ashes but I'm going to go up with a bride because I'm looking for a Rapture and what are you looking for tonight church are you looking for a Rapture then there's a Rapture Ready for you anden there's a Rapture awaiting you to get ready for that Rapture amen I believe if if the bride knew who she was tonight we'd be in that Rapture right look can you say man that's what a prophet said if the bride could ever realize who she is if the bride could ever recognize who she is we'd be out of this place come on is that all right tonight so what are we looking for we're looking at the problems of the world we're looking at does this church do it or does that Pastor preach it or does this one do it listen church that that that has no bearing on me amen that has no bearing on my salvation amen I don't care what they do in that church but I'm worried about me and can I get ready I I we all get caught up in those things we all get caught up by looking at the other church and we all get caught up looking across the fence but who do we really need to be looking at I need to be looking at my life and seeing if it's lining up with his word amen because his word is what matters his voice is what matters anden he is the will in the middle of the wheel can you say Amen come on when the spies went over to see what it would take to take the land what they see they saw giants but two of them two of them remember a promise and they said we are more than able see they were looking at a promise despite the size of the Giants well come on somebody anybody ever faced any Giants in here anybody ever had any problems before come on anybody ever seen something that looked impossible if you look look at the promise that's what you need to look at and the promise will tell you nothing is impossible to them that believe so what we need to think about tonight is not not not looking at the at the things that are in front of us that are too hard to overcome but look at a promise that you're going to overcome amen quit looking at the looking at the size of the Giants and look to the promise that this is my land and I'm ordained to take this land I hope this is all right tonight I'm just I'm here to encourage you listen we're about out of this year but we got another year in front of us listen this could be 2020 right Lord help us oh no no just imagine the the end of 2019 everybody was preaching and they had no idea what was coming just think about it and then 2020 shows up and and there's a lot of churches today that are sitting empty because of that there's a lot of people that have never went back to church because they they got comfortable sitting at home in 2020 it was the devil all the time they got to looking and they got to looking at the things that were happening around them and it was just too much to overcome but this bride was looking at it and she was just getting closer and closer together don't let me sit out a church I want to get back to the house of God I remember the urgence of going back to church when we couldn't have church I wonder if we could get that again amen I don't want to look at maybe I'll have a reason not to go to church next week no I'm not looking for a reason not to go to church but I want to get back to the house of God because it's something on the inside of the Bride that wants to be in line with the word for the day oh yes amen it's not a reason listen you don't know what you're going to face in 2025 you don't know the heartaches you might listen I'm not trying to hurt you but listen you don't know what's around the corner you don't know what's tomorrow but if you're looking to a promise then it doesn't matter what you face tomorrow because whatever comes the promise is still true can you say Amen we say well I want my children to be saved in 2025 go ahead and make that promise tonight and say that's my promise amen go ahead and just tell the devil listen I'm not going to lose one child in the year of 2025 go ahead and tell them listen my finances I've been you know you can you can say how bad off you've been but go ahead and just tell the devil listen I I'm going to go ahead and be blessed in 20125 I'm going to go to church no matter how bad off I am I'm G to pay my ti I'm going to listen come on church sometimes you got to call that Devil's Bluff and just tell him he has no power and authority over me cuz I'm looking to a promise if you're looking to how bad off you are if you're looking to how bad things have been right if you're looking to symptoms then you can never see the Promise amen but Abraham didn't look at the symptoms he didn't he didn't even consider the age of Sarah and mean he didn't consider how bad things were going to get he didn't consider that there was no way out of this situation but what he saw was a promise that there would be a son and I would say in this day there was a promise of a spirit to come and I say the spirit is here and it's up to us to go ahead and just remember that it's our time to accept the spirit that was to come and go ahead be baptized ized amen if you're a young person tonight and you've been seeking baptism this is your time go ahead and get baptized and let the spirit that was in Christ come to you and if that spirit will dwell in you it will Quicken your mortal body so I'm looking for a church to that's going to rise up in the year of 2025 I'm looking for young people that are going to be close to the Lord in 2025 I'm looking for broken hearts to be mended in 2025 I'm looking for a church to be on fire in 2025 I'm looking for these young ladies to become Daughters of God in the year of 2025 I'm looking at my life and saying Lord let me be closer to you in the year of 2025 I'm not looking to fall farther from him I want to walk closer to him I want to hug closer to him why because he wants me to walk in his hand and I don't want to be over here pulling away and saying well well the the Rapture didn't happen last year it ain't going to happen this year I believe we're this close to it church I believe it's upon us I believe the Rapture is in you I think it's time we start lining up to it and saying I'm getting ready to leave this world I'm getting ready why because I believe in a promise of a Rapture than I believe in it how many believes in a promise of a Rapture and if you're not here to see it I believe your kids are going to be here to see it and if your kids aren't here to see it your grandkids are listen there's going to be somebody here to go in a Rapture somebody's going to be here in a Rapture so we might as well quit thinking that our kids aren't going to make it somebody is's going to make it come on if I'm not here to see it I want my children to raise up and say I'm going to stand for the same message and I'm going to be in a Rapture listen church when I I was listening to a person the other day and a southern gospel singer actually there just an interview and and they were talking about how much they did not believe in a Rapture and I'm sitting there thinking how how can you read the scriptures and not believe in a Rapture and they said that that was not that was not part that was just like one verse in the Bible and it really didn't matter and I'm sitting there thinking you know you're not going to see a Rapture come on not saying you're not saved but you you may have to go through the tribulation I'm not here to look for a tribulation I'm not here to go down in the ashes of America but I'm here to be caught up with a bride of like-minded faith that believes in an end time message listen I'm looking forward to my loved ones coming from the grave I'm looking forward to that Resurrection morning when I don't have to be here no more there's no sin there's no sorrow there's no sickness no more there's no more problems with your bills but I can see that my loved ones have been there and I believe I'm going in a Rapture yeah you can say what about your faults what about your failures what about this listen I ain't look to that because then none of us would make it come on I'm not looking at your faults brother Justin I can't look at you and say well you know brother Justin just couldn't make it because you know he missed a Wednesday night we all missed last Wednesday night by the way what none of us here but you know think about it people start pointing fingers at you and say well you know brother Justin you know he did this you know if if every one of us the best person in here had our lives put on that screen right now we'd be so embarrassed we'd walk out of this church every single one of the best Saints in the building and what about your thoughts boy you sure wouldn't want them on the on the on the board come on come on somebody you think this mind is converted no come on good that's good you think this flesh is converted no come on you're a lot better off than I am that's good come on somebody we're we're looking at everybody else and their problems and we forget about ourselves we're dragging around Humanity too amen come on somebody Amen brother Joe look at me you look look tonight don't look at the man but look at look at the man that that that is inside of brother Joe that has held him all these years All These Years brother Joe had stayed here in the house of God why it wasn't because the flesh always felt like because God called him to be here why because he's got children that's got to be saved and he's got grandchildren that needed to go to church and come on somebody I'm not just looking to the problems of a man or a woman but I want to see what God has in mind for that generation that is to come sister Stephanie you was brought back to the house of God for a reason and now you're seeing the fruits of it with your son in the house of God listen God has a purpose for us God has a reason for us to be here and I'm here to tell you tonight quit looking at the difficulties and look through the promise every one of us have got plenty to look at that's negative but let's just quit looking at it for for a little bit hey man you know sometimes we see we see how bad off things are and we look at and we look at our finances and don't look at your bank account right now after the holidays it's not a good idea amen they'll send you a letter if it's overdrawn but you know you look at you you look how much money you spent don't do that don't look at your credit card bill those are negatives but what you what you do is if you're always looking at negatives you become a negative being I want to lay this in here before we close come on if you're always looking and dwelling on negative thoughts you become a negative being that's right is that all right nobody wants to be around constant negativity right nobody wants to be in the same room as somebody that is always always saying how bad off it is for them now we know you struggle and some of you have struggled a whole lot more than me some of you have struggled more than others in this room that's true some of you have been through things I couldn't handle that's just the truth of it some of you have faced challenges I couldn't have made God didn't put me through those things because he knew maybe I couldn't handle it but he allowed you to go through it now the truth of it is if you're constantly dwelling on the negatives and you quit looking at the promise all you can see your whole life is nothing but one trial after another and you fail to see that God is the one that brought you out of every one of them come on well I just can't make it no you can't make it on your own quit looking to yourself and start looking to the one who's been leading you the whole [Applause] time I'm not looking to myself to make it in a Rapture I'm looking to the god that has promised that there would be a bride and she'd be ready at the time of rapture amen that's good yes let me get on down here where I can close y'all still with me amen you've been wonderful tonight I I hope I ain't taking too much time but let me just say this brother random said and he's talking to the people he said now you that are sitting here don't you dare look to any man yeah amen let me just say that again right he said don't you dare to look to any man come he said you look to Christ he is the one Glory but he promised in the last days that he would manifest himself in human flesh like he did there at Sodom now your flesh My Flesh let us just open our hearts and get our own thinking away and just let the word take its course tonight in us then I like this we'll see God's great gifts of his spirit manifested before us why don't we see more of God get yourself out of the way why don't we see Miracles get yourself out of the way why don't we have some services that that the go the God will really come and move in get yourself out of the way we can't work this up God is going to come any way he wants to whenever he wants to however he wants to he's going to save souls and bring back prodigals and raise up our young people to be a mighty Army of God I say I'm looking to the promise today I'm not looking to the failures of my past I'm not looking to the failures of your past I'm not looking to well come on somebody I'm looking at a promise and the promised land is here I'm resting on the message of the hour that is the promise Pro of the of God for me brother Brandon would go on like this brother Bron would saying friends don't look to me I'm your brother right that's I know that hurts some people that are always wanted to follow a man but he was not pointing you to him that's right he never one time said look at me look at brother random no he said Look to Him He was just one standing that was pointing to one that was to come come on Church listen I believe in the special man I Look to that man for I I I believe in I I like his opinions and I'll go ahead and say it like this if if he had Christmas I'll have Christmas but I'm going to go ahead and say it like this God didn't want me to just look at the humanity of the man but the man would stand there and say look to him that's right he said I'm just IM mortal a lot of people can't see that because of the great gift and the greatness of the man people cannot see the mortality of the man but he was just a moral and he was standing there he said I'm as helpless as any other man yeah that's right do we see that it was God through this entire message brother brandham couldn't stand there and discern the hearts of the people but God could do it through a man that would yield himself to the gift that was there amen if brother Brandon wouldn't have yielded himself brother Brandon would say it like this he said if a man won't yield himself then God will get somebody else to take that man's position hope this is all right tonight I'm almost done I'm almost out of time so I better be done he said I'm your brother I'm just Immortal I have to die like everybody else don't you listen to me but listen to what I've said what I said is the message come on we okay so far he said what I said is the message don't pay any attention to the messenger watch the message keep your eyes not on the messenger but on the message what it said that's the thing to look to so what am I looking to I'm looking to the message that is what's going to call me out of here brother brandom is not going to stand here and call me from the grave but the message will call me from where I was to where I will be amen and if the message is in me then guess what the voice of authority to call me from the grave is already on the inside of me and I believe that if I go down by way of grave there is something on the inside of me to resurrect me and if I'm here at the time of rapture then there is a voice on the inside of me that is going to call out come up high and I am going to leave this world and I'm going to go in a Rapture why it's not me it's not my voice but it is the message that I have ate and I have digested that message and I become one with that message I am a believer I believe in the message of the hour you say well is that important it is if you want to go on a Rapture are you looking to the message tonight you are if you want to go on a Rapture are you looking to some man's opinion of the message no I'm looking to the message that was brought by a Vindicated Prophet who would get himself out of the way and say don't look to me look to him oh thank you Lord Brother R said keep your eyes not on the messenger but on the message what it said that's the thing to look to I want to tell this story in closing you remember the story about the boy that was riding a bicycle on the plank and it was a contest come on and they'd give that boy a new swin bicycle if he could ride to the end and I I forget I think it was a 12 in for 100 yards 12 Ines across for 100 yards and brother BR would say there was boy after boy that would try to ride this plank and they would they would all get off one side fall off this side fall off the other and he said there was one boy that got on there and he said he he said he knew he was going to win this and and he said he said that little old boy there he just you know mama's boy like and none of them cared very much for him they all got on their time their numbers were called and they got on the board to ride each one fell off but this little boy boy you know what the world calls you sometimes they just want to call you names and the the world has tacked all kinds of names on this Church Holy Roller fanatic brandom mites whatever they want to call us I don't care what you call me but you're going to call me gone because I'm looking for a Rapture I don't care what you call come on church I don't care what you call me because one of these days I'm going to be looking down at this Canon fod that's called America or this Canon F that's called the Earth and I'm going to be caught up to meet my Lord in the air listen he said that he said that little boy He said Each one fell off but he said that little boy little boy wrode it right to the end never made a wobble and so all the boys got around him and said how did you do it he said I tell you here's what it was said I watched what you were all doing and I seen your mistake I hope this is okay but he said you were looking down like this trying to keep it on the board and I just watched the end and held steady well praise the Lord and he said I held steady there you are see he said that's the idea not what's right here but the end and keep steady keep looking to the Lord Jesus is what he said amen quit looking at the problems around you look to the end of this thing and stay steady sir is that okay tonight is that okay can we just start looking at the end look at the trophy that's at the end and quit looking at the distractions that are on each side of us trying to make us Fall Away amen more looking brother said more looking to the things musicians go ahead and come more looking to the things that are positive yeah I've used this quote in the ending of a lot of sermons and I just love it brother brandham is actually praying here and he said more looking to the things that are positive and forgetting the things that are in the past thank you Lord how many's willing to do that tonight am quit looking at your past and start looking to your future forgetting the things that are in the past and the negatives and the negatives yeah let me press towards the mark of the High Calling of Christ thank you Lord brother brandom says that's our desire isn't it I wonder tonight I've read this quote here before I wonder tonight if we couldn't just make that our prayer tonight if we could stand more looking to the things that are positive sir and forgetting the things that are in the past how many can do that the negatives there's a lot of negativity in your past but you don't have to look to that I failed as a parent quit looking at the [Music] negatives I failed as a husband quit looking at the negatives I failed as a wife quit looking at the negatives [Music] that's what a prophet said but more looking to the things that are positive can we do that tonight I wonder if we could say in 2025 with my hand up to the Lord I'm going to quit looking to the negatives in my past oh thank you Lord I'm going to forget those things well I can't forget brother Joel I'm going to forget those things and start thinking on the positive things and the mark of the high calling that I've been called to I'm looking at the prize I will not fall away in the year of 20125 listen I don't believe in New Year's resolutions but I believe it's a good time to renew our lives here tonight and say I'm not going to go back to the way I was I see the mistakes that I made last year I'm not going to make those by the grace of God I'm going to keep my eyes on the prize that is coming listen church I believe there's a future for this bride and I believe that future is a Rapture it's time we look for the positives and quit looking at the negatives well if we could bow our heads tonight could you just make that your prayer if you would just pray right there where you're at tell the Lord I'm sorry about all the negatives I'm looking at I'm sorry I'm looking at all the things that are holding me [Music] back I'm sorry for the the thing I made it but it's all about you oh great Lord I'm looking to you the author and the finisher of
