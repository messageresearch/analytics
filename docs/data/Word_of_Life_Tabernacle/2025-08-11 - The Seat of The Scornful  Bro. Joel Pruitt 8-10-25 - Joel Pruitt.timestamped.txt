[39:19] Oh, white as snow. Give him a hand of
[39:23] praise. Amen.
[39:26] Amen. Throw one in honor there. Sorry
[39:29] about that. Amen. I just love the words
[39:31] of that though. Amen. Amen. White as
[39:33] snow. Amen. Are you ready for the word
[39:35] of the Lord this evening? Amen.
[39:37] Certainly appreciate our brother Joel's
[39:38] sermon this morning speaking to our
[39:40] hearts. Amen. Just reminding us where we
[39:44] stand, what we believe in and and just a
[39:47] good reminder and a good builder for the
[39:49] youth. Amen. So, just looking forward to
[39:51] what the Lord has for us this evening.
[39:53] Amen. You have a need on your heart,
[39:54] just place that before the Lord as the
[39:56] word comes forth. Amen. Let's just
[39:58] worship him now and tell him, "Oh, hail
[40:00] King Jesus."
[40:03] Oh, hell king Jesus.
[40:10] Oh, hell
[40:12] man.
[40:15] Tell him tonight now. Oh, King
[40:19] of Kings,
[40:21] Lord of Lords. He's that bright morning
[40:26] star.
[40:30] Now it's through out
[40:35] eternity
[40:36] [Music]
[40:38] that I'm going to praise
[40:42] him.
[40:45] And forever
[40:48] more. I know that I amen. Amen. You
[40:54] believe it this evening. Sing it now.
[40:58] All hail King Jesus.
[41:02] [Music]
[41:05] Oh hell.
[41:12] be
[41:15] [Music]
[41:26] and throughout
[41:30] eternity
[41:34] I'm going to praise
[41:37] him
[41:40] and Forever
[41:43] more
[41:45] I will reign.
[41:49] One more time with all your hearts. Now
[41:51] let me hear you sing it.
[41:53] All hail King Jesus.
[42:00] All hail I manuel.
[42:04] [Music]
[42:07] He's the king of kings.
[42:11] Lord of lords,
[42:15] bright morning star.
[42:21] And throughout
[42:25] eternity
[42:28] I'm going to praise
[42:31] him.
[42:35] and forever
[42:38] more
[42:40] I will reign
[42:43] with him.
[42:45] How many believes that tonight? Amen.
[42:48] It's good to be in the house of the Lord
[42:50] again this evening and to sing praises
[42:52] to his name. Amen. All hail King Jesus.
[42:55] Amen. We don't have nobody to worship
[42:57] but him.
[42:58] &gt;&gt; Nobody deserves worship but him.
[43:01] &gt;&gt; I don't deserve it. Nobody deserves it.
[43:03] but he deserves all of the praise and
[43:06] the worship. Do you believe it tonight?
[43:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're just going that'd be all the
[43:09] singing for now. Let us go ahead and go
[43:11] right into the word. And if you have
[43:12] your Bibles, Psalm chapter 1 and verse
[43:15] one, just want to say it was a it was an
[43:17] honor for me to be able to stand here
[43:18] this morning and and speak to you
[43:20] people. You you you were you were
[43:21] wonderful. You amened and backed me and
[43:23] better than I deserved. I think you
[43:25] might have a me better than I was
[43:26] preaching, but I did enjoy it. And so,
[43:29] uh, if you can just do that tonight,
[43:30] we'll try to get out on time and and,
[43:32] uh, I did enjoy being with you this
[43:34] morning. Amen. How many's looking
[43:36] forward to what the Lord has for you
[43:37] this evening?
[43:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. I can't do nothing in myself, but
[43:40] I know that if he shows up, anything's
[43:42] possible.
[43:43] &gt;&gt; And that's what we want to just depend
[43:45] on tonight is depending on, we're
[43:47] depending on him this evening. If you
[43:50] have your Bibles there, Psalms chapter 1
[43:51] and verse one, blessed is the man that
[43:53] walketh not in the counsel of the
[43:55] ungodly, nor standeth in the way of
[43:57] sinners, nor siteth in the seat of the
[44:00] scornful. You may be seated. May the
[44:01] Lord add his blessings to the reading of
[44:04] the word this evening. Amen. If I could
[44:06] take a thought this evening, it would be
[44:07] in the seat of the scornful. And I know
[44:09] we've heard the story brother talks
[44:11] about he was in the seat of the
[44:12] scornful, and we'll get to all that at
[44:14] some point. But I do want to say
[44:16] tonight, I think too many of us are
[44:18] found in the seat of the scornful.
[44:21] &gt;&gt; Well, somebody say amen.
[44:23] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we come to church and we just
[44:24] decide to sit in the seat of the
[44:26] scornful. And sometimes I think we ought
[44:28] to we ought to change seats. Hallelujah.
[44:30] Amen. I think sometimes if you find
[44:32] yourself in that position, Amen. It
[44:34] would be a good thing to just go ahead
[44:36] and say, you know what, I'm not coming
[44:38] today to to be to to to pick on things.
[44:41] I'm not coming today. I'm not coming to
[44:44] see who's there and who's not there. I'm
[44:45] not coming to worry about how the
[44:47] service goes, but I'm here to worship.
[44:49] And if we're here to worship, then we
[44:51] can get out of the seat of the scornful
[44:52] long enough to actually worship. And I
[44:54] think that's important uh for the
[44:56] believers to do. Brother Brandon would
[44:58] actually say here, he said in the
[44:59] Psalms, David said, "Set not the sit not
[45:01] in the seat of the scornful and stand in
[45:03] the way of the ungodly." Say, "Don't put
[45:04] yourself in the way of the ungodly like
[45:06] that and sit in the seat of the
[45:07] scornful, making fun of them that are
[45:09] right and standing around saying it was
[45:10] a form of godliness. But he that
[45:12] delightth in the law of the Lord, he
[45:14] loves to do it. He shall be like a tree
[45:16] that's planted by the rivers of water.
[45:18] His leaves shall not wither, and
[45:19] whatever he does will prosper. It will
[45:22] come to pass just exactly. That's the
[45:24] kind of a church that God wants. Blind
[45:26] leaders of the blind making in these
[45:27] last days, scoffers coming in and so
[45:29] forth. So you'll see that blind leaders
[45:31] will cause scoffers to arise among us.
[45:34] Can you say amen? But but a real church
[45:36] will be like a tree that's planted by
[45:38] the rivers of water. Amen. you're not
[45:39] shaken by the thing that happens in the
[45:41] next service or or the way maybe you
[45:43] say, "Well, the uh well, you know,
[45:44] everything's out of out of cater today.
[45:46] We've got different musicians, different
[45:47] song leaders, different preachers." And
[45:48] and I I'll say that sometimes God lets
[45:51] those things happen to see how are you
[45:53] going to respond to those things. Amen.
[45:55] How many is willing to come and expect
[45:56] something from God? No matter who's
[45:58] standing in the pulpit, no matter who's
[45:59] singing, no matter who's playing
[46:00] instruments. Amen. What we we didn't
[46:02] come to see them anyway, but we came to
[46:05] receive from God. Can you say amen?
[46:07] Amen. So, so we've got people today and
[46:10] and you create scoffers in the church.
[46:12] You create people that are just scornful
[46:13] and they're they're picking at one
[46:14] another and they're they're always uh
[46:16] trying to to you know just always go
[46:18] after something in the church. You're
[46:20] too loud. You're too quiet. You're too
[46:22] you're just something there. You're just
[46:23] something wrong. Everybody some some
[46:25] people just everything's wrong. And if
[46:27] I'm not careful, Amen. the preachers get
[46:29] there too. You start looking at who's
[46:31] there and you start looking who's not
[46:32] there and the ones that aren't backing
[46:33] you and the ones that are backing you.
[46:35] And the truth is we get in the seat of
[46:36] the scornful too. But but what we need
[46:39] to do is when we come to the house of
[46:41] God to get out of the seat of the
[46:43] scornful and come and put everything
[46:45] aside and worship God in the way that
[46:48] he's worthy of it and in the way that he
[46:50] deserves to be worshiped. And so brother
[46:52] Brandon would go on like this. He said,
[46:53] "Oh church of the living God, believe
[46:55] this the truth. Here it is. When the
[46:57] true spirit of God moves upon the
[46:58] believer, whatever the scripture says,
[47:00] he'll say amen."
[47:03] &gt;&gt; He said, "Why? It's the Holy Ghost that
[47:05] wrote the Bible is in him pulsating his
[47:08] life.
[47:09] &gt;&gt; What can you say amen tonight? Amen. So
[47:11] you say why why should the church say
[47:13] amen? Why should the church response
[47:15] respond? It's because the Holy Ghost in
[47:17] you is responding to the word that is
[47:20] being preached.
[47:21] &gt;&gt; Is that okay tonight? And brother
[47:23] Brandon would go on like this. He said
[47:24] he don't care who is sitting around or
[47:26] what anybody else says. It'll always
[47:28] divvy with the word. There's there there
[47:30] is false. It's it's gourds. It's off of
[47:32] the wild vine. It's a great vine. Covers
[47:35] all the earth, but it's death. And a lot
[47:37] of that's been cast among the people.
[47:38] But remember, meal brings it back to
[47:40] life. Pluck it up and set it by a goodly
[47:42] place, which is Jesus Christ. Whatever
[47:45] his word is, let it be amen to you. Then
[47:48] the spirit of God, then spiritual joy
[47:51] will flow like a river. Somebody say
[47:53] amen. Amen. And I believe tonight if the
[47:55] spiritual joy is there, Amen. And if you
[47:58] put aside all the things that are
[47:59] distracting you and all the things that
[48:01] maybe you say, "Well, I've got a feeling
[48:03] against so and so." Make those things
[48:05] right and let's have church.
[48:07] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Too often we're
[48:09] sitting in the seat of the scornful and
[48:11] we sit there so long that we get used to
[48:13] it.
[48:15] &gt;&gt; We get used to being scornful. We We get
[48:17] used to picking at everybody and we get
[48:19] used to not being happy in church and we
[48:21] get used to Come on, church. Can you
[48:23] say, "Amen. Amen. You don't know what
[48:24] I'm going through and I don't know what
[48:26] you're going through." But when we come
[48:27] in here, we're on an even ground. Amen.
[48:29] We're worshiping God. We're saying amen
[48:31] to the word of God. What what is it? It
[48:33] is the Holy Ghost responding to the word
[48:35] that is being preached.
[48:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. It is it is something. It's a
[48:39] spiritual joy. He said, "That will flow
[48:41] like a river." He said it'd be like a
[48:43] man, a tree that's planted by the rivers
[48:44] of water. His leaves shall not wither.
[48:46] He'll not sit in the seat of the
[48:47] scornful or the unbeliever or the
[48:49] ungodly person that lives after the
[48:51] things of the world, but he'll bring
[48:52] forth fruits in its season. What kind of
[48:54] fruit? If you're planted in Christ,
[48:56] you'll bring forth spiritual fruit.
[48:58] Spiritual fruits of the Holy Spirit. The
[49:00] Holy Ghost lives in you. And so, so I I
[49:04] think we've got that settled tonight
[49:05] that if the Holy Ghost lives in you and
[49:06] the word is being preached, then
[49:08] something on the inside of you will just
[49:09] raise up and say,
[49:12] &gt;&gt; "It's exactly right." And so the and it
[49:14] means so be it. If the word is right, I
[49:17] think it deserves our attention.
[49:19] &gt;&gt; And I'm not saying you always have to be
[49:21] loud, but sometimes I I think there
[49:23] needs to be some response. Amen. Some
[49:25] some some sign of life. Can you say
[49:27] amen? Amen. I listen. I I know there's a
[49:30] lot of I just go ahead and get there. I
[49:32] think these are in my notes somewhere.
[49:33] You know, I think a lot of times we look
[49:35] at fanaticism and we're so scared to be
[49:37] fanatical that we can't even have
[49:39] church. We're so scared that we're going
[49:41] to become a Pentecostal that we won't
[49:43] Well, can you say amen? We've got all
[49:45] kinds of people trying to tell you, hey
[49:47] man, we don't want to we don't want to
[49:48] shout. We don't want to run. We don't
[49:49] want to because there's there's false.
[49:51] Yes, there's false. Yes, there's
[49:52] fanatics. Yes. But but but listen, there
[49:55] couldn't be that without the real.
[49:58] &gt;&gt; You know that.
[49:59] &gt;&gt; Did you know that every one of these
[50:01] people that are that are mimicking God
[50:03] and trying to and and and that in itself
[50:05] is a form of godliness? Even if they're
[50:07] shouting and speaking tongues, many of
[50:08] those are also a form of godliness. But
[50:10] they deny the power the word thereof.
[50:13] But if you've accepted the word, you
[50:15] don't have to worry about that because
[50:17] you're not you're listen, you're not
[50:18] you're you're not sitting over here just
[50:20] mimicking something, but you have the
[50:22] real thing. The skies are full of the
[50:23] genuine. We are full of the genuine. Can
[50:26] you say amen? The word is in you. Amen.
[50:29] The word has come to you and we ought to
[50:31] be so happy that we can't contain our
[50:33] amens in church.
[50:36] But what happens is we get sitting in
[50:37] the seat of the scornful. And in the
[50:39] seat of the scornful, you're always
[50:40] looking at something that's wrong.
[50:42] You're always under expectation of
[50:43] something bad happening or the preacher
[50:45] the preacher saying something that might
[50:47] deceive you. I want to just go ahead and
[50:48] give you the good news tonight. If
[50:50] you're the elected of God, you cannot be
[50:52] deceived.
[50:53] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm worried if we get too
[50:55] emotional, we we might become
[50:56] Pentecostals. I tell you what, brother
[50:58] Brandon would preach a sermon called Why
[50:59] I am a holy roller. I say, "Identify me
[51:02] with that." If you want to listen,
[51:04] church, he didn't come back for a dead
[51:06] bride, but there's got to be a living
[51:08] body on the earth.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[51:12] &gt;&gt; I think too many of us, we're just too
[51:14] scared. Fear has bound the people.
[51:17] &gt;&gt; Watch a pastor that's always preaching
[51:18] fear. watch the congregation get scared
[51:20] to death.
[51:22] &gt;&gt; Is that okay?
[51:24] &gt;&gt; They're always getting, you know, we we
[51:25] don't want to get we don't want to be
[51:26] like them and we we got to be careful
[51:28] with the altar calls. We got to be
[51:29] careful with the prayer lines and we
[51:30] Well, can you say amen, man? We got to
[51:32] be we got to be careful because we might
[51:33] become we might become Pentecostal or or
[51:36] our kids might get down here and they
[51:37] might start speaking in tongues or
[51:38] shouting. I say let it happen. I say let
[51:41] our kids have their revival. I say get
[51:43] the wet blankets off of them. Let's have
[51:44] church. If you get out of the seat of
[51:46] the scornful, you can have church, too.
[51:50] &gt;&gt; Well, is this okay so far? I know this
[51:52] is way different than this morning, but
[51:54] this is just on my heart. And if it's on
[51:55] my heart, that's all I can preach. And
[51:57] so, y'all just bear with me and say amen
[52:00] as much as you can because if the Holy
[52:01] Ghost is in you, the prophet said,
[52:03] you'll say amen. Hallelujah.
[52:06] And I was looking for that quote for a
[52:08] long time. And when I found it, I was
[52:09] just just almost said amen myself. I
[52:12] like well there's a quote that says if
[52:14] the Holy Ghost is in people they'll say
[52:16] amen. And brother Brandon would excuse
[52:18] me the Bible here in 2 Samuel chapter 6
[52:21] and verse 12 it goes like this. It was
[52:25] told King David saying the Lord blessed
[52:27] the house of Obedom and all that
[52:30] pertainth unto him because of the ark of
[52:31] God. So David went and brought up the
[52:33] ark of God from the house of Oed Edom
[52:35] into the city of David with glad David
[52:37] with gladness. And it was so that when
[52:39] they that bear the ark of the Lord had
[52:41] gone six paces, he sacrificed oxen and
[52:44] fatlings. And David danced before the
[52:46] Lord with all his might. And David was
[52:48] girded with linen ephod. And so David
[52:50] and all the house of Israel brought up
[52:52] the ark of the Lord with shouting and
[52:54] with the sound of the trumpet. Oh,
[52:57] somebody ought to say that sounds like a
[52:58] good time. With shouting with the sound
[53:00] of a trumpet. And as the ark of the Lord
[53:02] came into the city of David, Michael,
[53:04] Saul's daughter, looked through a window
[53:06] and saw King David leaping and dancing
[53:07] before the Lord, and she despised him in
[53:10] her heart. I wonder what seat she was
[53:13] sitting in.
[53:14] &gt;&gt; Sounds like the seat of the scornful to
[53:15] me, doesn't it? Now in verse 20, uh 2
[53:18] Samuel 6 and verse 20, David returned to
[53:20] bless his household. And Michael the
[53:22] daughter of Saul came out to meet David
[53:23] and said, "How glorious was the king of
[53:25] Israel today, who uncovered himself
[53:27] today in the eyes of the handmaids and
[53:29] of his servants, as one of the vain
[53:31] fellows shamelessly uncoverth himself."
[53:33] She's rebuking David now. And David said
[53:36] unto Michael, "It was before the Lord,
[53:39] which chose me before thy father,
[53:42] and before all his house, to appoint me
[53:44] ruler over the people of the Lord, over
[53:46] Israel. Therefore will I play before the
[53:48] Lord, and I will yet be more vile than
[53:50] thus, and will be based in mine own
[53:52] sight, and of the maid servants, which
[53:54] thou hast spoken of, and of them shall I
[53:56] shall I be had in honor." Therefore,
[53:58] Michael, the daughter of Saul, had no
[54:00] child until the day of her death. I want
[54:02] you to notice something. because she
[54:04] laughed at the spirit of God on David.
[54:07] &gt;&gt; God saw that as a curse.
[54:09] &gt;&gt; Listen, church, I you can make fun of
[54:11] what you can make fun of me all you want
[54:12] to. You can make fun of what we do all
[54:14] you want to, but don't make fun of the
[54:15] moving of the spirit. You say, "Well, I
[54:17] know it's fanaticism." You may not know
[54:19] it's fanaticism. Somebody may be
[54:21] screaming in the spirit and you say,
[54:22] "Well, I've seen them do that 10 times
[54:24] before." Well, this time might be the
[54:25] real thing. Amen. I say if Come on,
[54:28] church. You say, "Well, brother Joel's
[54:29] on his Pentecostal kick again." I am a
[54:31] little bit. And I'll tell you why.
[54:33] Because you know what we've got is we've
[54:34] got too many people trying to say they
[54:36] believe the message and then trying to
[54:38] preach a god of the Methodist church or
[54:40] the Baptist church and trying to take
[54:41] the altars out of the church and trying
[54:43] to take the prayer lines out of the
[54:44] church and trying to take the spirit of
[54:46] God out of the church. But I say if the
[54:48] spirit of God is here, then there'll be
[54:50] liberty in the house of God to worship.
[54:52] Yes,
[54:52] &gt;&gt; sir.
[54:53] &gt;&gt; We We don't need to work something up or
[54:54] make something happen, but we do need to
[54:56] have the freedom to worship God in the
[54:59] way that's called crazy.
[55:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. You you say, "Well, brother Joel,
[55:04] why would we ever want to do that?"
[55:05] Because he's worthy.
[55:09] &gt;&gt; When David when David saw the ark, he
[55:12] danced because it excited him that the
[55:14] ark was coming down the road. Amen.
[55:16] There was an excitement there. And I
[55:18] wonder if we could see that the word is
[55:20] being revealed again in our hearts. The
[55:22] the open book that's already here, it is
[55:24] in our hearts and we can see the
[55:26] message. That ought to make somebody
[55:28] happy. It don't sound like we got a
[55:30] right to be sad if we got the living God
[55:32] amongst us. No, we've got a right to
[55:34] shout. If anybody's got a right to
[55:36] shout, we got a right to shout. If
[55:38] anybody's got a right to scream out in
[55:39] the spirit, we got a right to scream out
[55:41] in the spirit. If God moves on you to do
[55:43] it, listen, we don't make it happen. You
[55:45] don't sit there and say, "Well, when the
[55:46] when the song gets to a certain part, I
[55:48] I'm going to start screaming her." No,
[55:50] no, no, no. But when the Lord moves upon
[55:51] you, when the Lord moves upon your
[55:53] heart, then you can dance like David.
[55:56] When the Lord moves upon you to say,
[55:58] says say amen. You ought to say amen.
[56:00] When the Lord move, come on, church.
[56:02] When the Lord moves you, then we need to
[56:05] be willing and able to move with the
[56:07] spirit of the Lord.
[56:09] &gt;&gt; There's no reason to hold back and say,
[56:10] "Well, well, they'll call me a fanatic
[56:12] or a Pentecostal. I I don't think that
[56:14] matters what they call us, church."
[56:16] They're they're going to call you all
[56:17] kinds of things. They're going to say
[56:18] you're old uh some old fogy and you and
[56:20] you dress like a you you dress like a
[56:22] Menite and they're going to call you all
[56:24] kinds of things. But can I go ahead and
[56:25] tell you something? You're going to face
[56:26] a lot of criticism. We might as well
[56:28] have fun doing it.
[56:31] &gt;&gt; Ain't no reason to let the devil steal
[56:34] your joy in the house of God.
[56:36] &gt;&gt; And there you say, "Well, so and so
[56:38] criticized me. So and so needs to change
[56:40] seats.
[56:43] &gt;&gt; They're in the seat of the scornful.
[56:45] &gt;&gt; They're sitting over there laughing at
[56:46] the spirit of God." Listen, I
[56:48] understand. I I I've told you it before
[56:50] and I'll tell you again. I know there's
[56:51] fanatics and I understand all these
[56:53] things, but don't let that scare you
[56:56] from the real genuine moving of the Holy
[56:58] Spirit in the house of God.
[57:00] &gt;&gt; And ain't nobody ever accused us of
[57:02] being Pentecostal. We We If you accuse
[57:05] us of being Pentecostal, you need to
[57:06] come sit through an afternoon service.
[57:10] Hallelujah.
[57:13] Brother Brandon would say it like this.
[57:14] He said, "When I first come," he said,
[57:16] he's going to testify. He said, 'When I
[57:18] first come amongst the Pentecostal
[57:20] people and seen them dance on the floor.
[57:21] He said, 'Th that was just too much for
[57:23] my self-style Baptist ways. He said you
[57:25] know I said look you here now dancing
[57:27] belongs out other type of people said
[57:30] not religious people I hear the music go
[57:31] to playing the people go to crying go to
[57:33] shouting after a while somebody start
[57:35] dancing I said well I I don't want to be
[57:37] critical but I I'm afraid to say
[57:39] something against God that wouldn't be
[57:40] right even in his way of even in the
[57:43] seat of the scornful
[57:44] &gt;&gt; he didn't want to criticize it
[57:46] &gt;&gt; but he sat there in his heart thinking
[57:48] that couldn't be right he said but you
[57:49] know I can't get that and said wish I
[57:51] could see that in the Bible and one
[57:52] night I was having teaching on a chart
[57:54] and the second coming of Christ. And
[57:55] from Louisville, Kentucky come a group
[57:57] of people over there with some young
[57:58] ladies and one of them was a piano
[58:00] player and the other one had symbols and
[58:01] a washboard. Yes. He had drums in the
[58:04] church that night if you're counting. He
[58:06] had symbols and a washboard and my they
[58:08] was making as much music out of that as
[58:10] a brass band. And and he said, "So I was
[58:13] teaching on the second coming and and
[58:14] then a few days before that I'd been up
[58:16] to Salem, Indiana, and there was some
[58:17] Pentecostal people just getting
[58:18] acquainted with them and they were
[58:20] dancing and going on. I got to running
[58:22] uh reference and I found out then that
[58:24] dancing the first time I noticed it,
[58:26] Miriam began to dance and I thought,
[58:27] well, that must be from God and the
[58:29] devil just patterned it off of that.
[58:30] Well, can you say amen? I I think the
[58:33] devil's taken a lot of our stuff and
[58:34] tried to make it look like it was the
[58:35] world's idea. But what they did, they
[58:37] stole it from us.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; He said he said, "Then the next I
[58:41] noticed that David danced when he saw
[58:42] the ark coming down the road." See, and
[58:44] I thought, my that's wonderful. And I
[58:46] noticed the king had made a a vow one
[58:48] time and he vowed that he'd sacrifice
[58:49] the first thing that come from his house
[58:50] and here come his daughter and and the
[58:52] daughter rejoicing, dancing. I noticed
[58:54] how dancing was victory. And I thought,
[58:55] well, maybe I just hadn't got enough
[58:57] victory. Maybe that's what it is. Maybe
[58:58] just a little bit of self has to die out
[59:00] yet. I wonder if we could say it here
[59:02] tonight. Maybe we just need a little bit
[59:03] of self to die out tonight where we can
[59:05] be free in the presence of God.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; You wonder who's looking at you and
[59:09] who's talking about you and who's going
[59:11] to who's going to rebuke you and who's
[59:12] sitting in the seat of the scornful and
[59:13] who's not. I want to tell you, you just
[59:15] get out of the seat of the scornful and
[59:16] worship God. Come on, church. When the
[59:18] word has come forth, it will move the
[59:21] believer because of the Holy Ghost on
[59:23] the inside of you.
[59:25] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon would go on like this.
[59:26] He said, "Maybe just a little bit of
[59:27] self has to die out." It wasn't long
[59:29] after that I was sitting there and I got
[59:30] through teaching on the second coming of
[59:32] Christ and know the spirit of God just
[59:33] taking our time moving and it was on a
[59:35] New Year's night. So, I'd been teaching
[59:36] about two hours. Now, he was teaching
[59:38] two hours and they were still having a
[59:39] good time. Somebody say amen. He said,
[59:41] "My tabernacle." So they was going to
[59:43] have a special and I believe got some
[59:45] folks from Louisville back there and
[59:46] some of them wrote a little note and put
[59:47] on there and said one had to play a
[59:49] special. Well I said come ahead. So they
[59:52] three or four ladies got up there and
[59:54] one got on the piano and she started
[59:55] playing there's going to be a meeting in
[59:56] the air and and when she started just
[59:58] raised up started the symbols and on
[1:00:00] this voice core and then heating the tin
[1:00:01] can. Well come on somebody.
[1:00:05] We're worried about what instruments we
[1:00:06] do have and he's got ten cans in the
[1:00:07] tabernacle.
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. He said he said voice core tin
[1:00:11] can. And he said, "My it got pretty
[1:00:12] good, you know." And he said, "I noticed
[1:00:14] there." Then after a while, there was a
[1:00:15] little girl jumped out on the floor
[1:00:16] there and started dancing up and down,
[1:00:17] jumping around. And here he was again.
[1:00:19] He said, "Oh, right in my own church.
[1:00:21] Here it is." He said, "Now sure," he
[1:00:24] said, "I'll get ruined for this." I kept
[1:00:26] watching her, and you know, I kept
[1:00:27] hearing here at this here in real the
[1:00:28] lady playing on that piano till I
[1:00:30] believe if there had been three or four
[1:00:31] decks of keys, she could have played
[1:00:33] them all. And she was playing this God's
[1:00:35] own son will be the leading one at the
[1:00:36] beginning of the air. and she had no
[1:00:38] more than than halfway got out of that
[1:00:40] until she'd be starting again. I
[1:00:41] thought, hm. And she just got real white
[1:00:43] in the face and her eyes closed and
[1:00:45] playing like that. I thought, say, I got
[1:00:47] to feeling pretty good. Got to patting
[1:00:48] my foot with that girl, you know. I
[1:00:49] thought, well, maybe that's just my
[1:00:51] Methodist foot anyhow. So, I started
[1:00:53] patting it a little bit, you know. And
[1:00:54] so, so, you know, it wasn't very long
[1:00:56] till I was out there with that girl
[1:00:58] dancing. Oh, come on, church. This is
[1:01:00] the prophet of God who was out on the
[1:01:02] floor dancing. And you want to criticize
[1:01:04] a move of the spirit in the house of
[1:01:05] God? Come on, church. What we've done is
[1:01:07] we've let some tradition of some man
[1:01:09] tell us we can't worship no more. But
[1:01:11] that's not what a prophet of God taught
[1:01:13] you.
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen?
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; And we've got we got the people so bound
[1:01:18] by fear that that that if they shouted
[1:01:20] in church, we'd probably have a deacon
[1:01:21] take them out. Or if they if they got to
[1:01:23] run in the aisles, we'd probably have to
[1:01:24] pull them in the office afterwards. I
[1:01:26] say, "Let God be God. And if the spirit
[1:01:28] of the Lord is here, let the liberty be
[1:01:30] in the house of God
[1:01:33] now."
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; He said, "Well, that's it." He said,
[1:01:35] 'You know, it wasn't very long I was
[1:01:36] dancing with that girl. Well, that's
[1:01:38] what it takes, isn't it? The victory. We
[1:01:40] need the victory here tonight. Just get
[1:01:42] away from self and let the Holy Spirit
[1:01:44] have the right away. Well, it said
[1:01:45] decently and orderly. It'll be decently
[1:01:47] in order. Just let it go and let the
[1:01:49] Holy Spirit. Come on, church. You want
[1:01:50] everything to be I've heard it sane and
[1:01:52] sensible. I've heard that preached time
[1:01:54] and time again. I want to go ahead and
[1:01:55] tell you what saint and sensible is.
[1:01:57] Lose your mind and get the mind of
[1:01:59] Christ.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; That's sane and sensible. Right.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, saint insensible ain't quiet. That's
[1:02:05] Methodist tradition. Sing insensible is
[1:02:07] losing your mind and letting him have
[1:02:09] his way however he wants to have his
[1:02:11] way.
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; Hope that's okay.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; Queen of Sheba, she had an expectation
[1:02:17] when she was coming and she was
[1:02:18] determined. There was something inside
[1:02:19] of her moving her and the deep was
[1:02:21] calling to the deep, something calling
[1:02:22] till she was thirsting and hungering for
[1:02:24] a taste of the righteousness of almighty
[1:02:26] God. And she would pull through anything
[1:02:27] to get to it. And finally, she arrived
[1:02:29] at the gate. Now, she didn't come to
[1:02:30] stay for just one night or sit in and
[1:02:32] wait till the pastor preached a little
[1:02:33] bit and said something was against her
[1:02:34] theology, then she'd pick up her hat and
[1:02:36] go home. No, no. That's that's sitting
[1:02:38] in the seat of the scornful right there.
[1:02:40] Amen. That shows, Brother Ram talked
[1:02:41] about that shows you're raising. If you
[1:02:42] get up and go out because the preacher
[1:02:44] says something a little against your
[1:02:45] theology, I want to go ahead and tell
[1:02:46] you something that that ain't message
[1:02:48] believers. That that's not us. We don't
[1:02:50] we don't get up and fly off the handle
[1:02:52] because the pastor said something that
[1:02:54] maybe you didn't like or didn't agree
[1:02:55] with. No. Go search the scriptures. Go
[1:02:57] study for yourself. Amen. We don't fly
[1:02:59] off the handle and and get in the flesh
[1:03:01] over something and say, "Well, well, I I
[1:03:03] didn't like that sermon that the pastor
[1:03:04] preached. If you just open your heart,
[1:03:06] maybe it was exactly what you needed."
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; Brother Joel, you're too hard. Give Just
[1:03:11] give me a little grace tonight. I'm
[1:03:12] going to try to get through it, okay? He
[1:03:15] said, "Just uh" he said she'd pick up
[1:03:16] her hat and go home. He said, "No." He
[1:03:18] said, "Uh, that shows poor raising to
[1:03:21] begin with." He said, "I don't like the
[1:03:23] way they conduct the services. I'll take
[1:03:24] my camels and turn back." She said,
[1:03:26] "I'll take my camels and turn back." No,
[1:03:28] Jesus never would have said about her
[1:03:30] what he did if she had had that
[1:03:31] attitude.
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; If you come to criticize, the devil is
[1:03:35] going to show you plenty to criticize.
[1:03:37] If you come to find fault, the devil's
[1:03:38] going to show you plenty of fault. Can
[1:03:40] the church say amen? The devil's going
[1:03:41] to show you plenty. But but if you come
[1:03:43] hungering and thirsting for God, and the
[1:03:44] angels of God will direct you to the
[1:03:46] spot to find it. Well, can you say amen?
[1:03:48] If you come hungering and thirsting, you
[1:03:51] will get what you expect. Amen.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; Every service you get what you expect. I
[1:03:57] I
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; Somebody ought to say, "Amen."
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; I know sometimes we come w and we're
[1:04:03] tired and and you're not expecting much.
[1:04:05] And I understand that. It happens to
[1:04:07] every one of us and and I understand
[1:04:08] that sometimes you you've had a bad day.
[1:04:10] And I understand all these things and
[1:04:12] and humanity gets in our way of a good
[1:04:14] service a whole lot of times. But I want
[1:04:16] you to know if you can ever just come
[1:04:17] under expectation that God's going to
[1:04:20] move for your situation, God's going to
[1:04:22] move for your children, God's going to
[1:04:23] move for your church, God's going to
[1:04:25] move in this service, God's going to
[1:04:26] heal the sick. Come on, church. God can
[1:04:29] do even the things that that are
[1:04:31] unexpected at times because what you did
[1:04:33] in your heart, you said, "Lord, I'm
[1:04:35] coming with humility. I'm coming with
[1:04:37] expectations that you are going to move
[1:04:40] on my behalf here tonight. Even when I
[1:04:42] don't feel like being in church, I know
[1:04:44] God can move on the situation that I
[1:04:46] have. Maybe there's something in your
[1:04:48] heart tonight where you say, "Well, I I
[1:04:49] I I I just don't I, you know, my
[1:04:51] family's gone or or maybe I I feel like
[1:04:53] I don't have the Holy Ghost or maybe I
[1:04:55] need a refilling of the Holy Ghost." I
[1:04:56] tell you what, all the you'll have some
[1:04:58] of them are sitting there, Brother Joel,
[1:05:00] we don't like the altar calls that
[1:05:01] you've been calling. We Well, I tell
[1:05:03] you, get out of the seat of the
[1:05:04] scornful. Maybe instead of condemning
[1:05:05] them, maybe you ought to join them once
[1:05:07] in a while.
[1:05:08] What you what you find out is if you
[1:05:10] ever get down there, you realize it's a
[1:05:11] humbling experience. It's not you don't
[1:05:13] just go to the altar just to make a
[1:05:15] show. You don't go to the through a
[1:05:16] prayer line just to make a show. Come
[1:05:18] on, church. But you're doing that
[1:05:20] because you're humbling yourself to the
[1:05:22] will of God. And if he tugs at your
[1:05:23] heart to go to the altar, don't let
[1:05:25] nothing stop you. Don't let no scornful
[1:05:27] person stop you. Don't let nobody that's
[1:05:29] sitting over there criticizing stop you.
[1:05:31] Listen, the critics ain't going to get
[1:05:32] you to heaven, but that tug on your
[1:05:34] heart will lead you and guide you into
[1:05:36] all truth. Amen.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon would go on like this.
[1:05:39] He said, "If you come to criticize, the
[1:05:41] devil is going to show you plenty." And
[1:05:43] he goes on like this. He said, "If you
[1:05:44] come with a a sar sarcastic criticism,
[1:05:47] whatever you expect to see, that's just
[1:05:49] what you'll see." He said, "If you come
[1:05:51] expecting to be just disappointed, that
[1:05:52] that's what you'll that's what you'll
[1:05:54] get." He said, "If you come to receive,
[1:05:56] you will be expecting to receive, and
[1:05:57] you shall receive just what you expect
[1:06:00] to receive." God always does that. He
[1:06:03] sworn to his word. And the church said,
[1:06:07] So if you come tonight expecting
[1:06:09] something from God, then God's going to
[1:06:10] give you something here tonight.
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; Listen, I don't know how any more plain
[1:06:14] to put it. But I can tell you, if you
[1:06:16] come under expectation for revival, you
[1:06:19] can have revival.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; If you come under expectation for God to
[1:06:23] move on your young people, God's going
[1:06:25] to move on your young people. If you
[1:06:27] come Well, can the church say amen? What
[1:06:29] what I'm telling you tonight is I'm not
[1:06:30] trying to work you up into into
[1:06:32] anything, but I'm telling you your
[1:06:33] expectations are wrong when you're
[1:06:35] sitting in the seat of the scornful
[1:06:37] because all you can do there is look,
[1:06:39] well, so and so went to the altar and
[1:06:41] maybe you should have went. So and so
[1:06:43] got prayed for. You know, I wonder what
[1:06:44] they're going through. I wonder what
[1:06:46] kind of demon they got on them. I I Come
[1:06:48] on, church. What we've done is we have
[1:06:50] we have we have started looking at
[1:06:51] everybody else's problems and we've
[1:06:53] started picking on people and how they
[1:06:54] worship. I say what we need to do is in
[1:06:57] the way that's called crazy. That's the
[1:06:59] way you need to worship God.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; I don't care if it's a message church
[1:07:03] calling you crazy. I don't care if it's
[1:07:05] the Baptist calling you crazy. I don't
[1:07:07] care who's calling you crazy. If it's
[1:07:09] crazy to the world, then I say it's
[1:07:10] probably good in the sight of God
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; because what what what man calls good is
[1:07:15] often not very good. What what God calls
[1:07:17] good is is very different than what we
[1:07:20] call good. But I want to say tonight,
[1:07:22] Brother Brandon would say like this. If
[1:07:23] you expect to come just to find
[1:07:25] something, the devil will sure show you
[1:07:26] plenty. He will. See, you get what you
[1:07:28] expected. He goes on. He said, he said
[1:07:30] there, he said, uh, I'm expecting
[1:07:31] tonight to see the Holy Spirit come and
[1:07:33] manifest itself in power pour out in his
[1:07:35] glory up in the building here. Many
[1:07:37] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:07:38] Sinners weep their way to Calvary. Sick
[1:07:40] be healed. All manners of signs and
[1:07:41] wonders because Jesus Christ has
[1:07:43] promised it. And I believe his promise.
[1:07:47] If you believe his promise, then you
[1:07:49] come with expectations. He said, "You'll
[1:07:51] only see what you're looking for. If you
[1:07:53] come here tonight looking for Christ,
[1:07:55] you'll see him." Can you say amen? If
[1:07:57] you come here tonight, he said, "If you
[1:07:59] come here to criticize, you'll have
[1:08:00] plenty on your hand to criticize."
[1:08:02] Depends on what you're looking for.
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; Now, he said, "Now, of everything that
[1:08:08] God has, the devil has a counterfeit."
[1:08:10] Now, we've talked about that already,
[1:08:11] but Brother Brandon tells about it here.
[1:08:12] He said, "You go and whatever you want
[1:08:14] to do, you'll find like these old dances
[1:08:15] that's of the devil. But God has a holy
[1:08:18] dance for the people." The Bible said
[1:08:19] so. He said, 'I was one of the greatest
[1:08:21] critics of that you ever seen.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God was.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; He said, "Till God told me just what to
[1:08:30] do." And he told that story earlier. I
[1:08:31] read in the quote, he said that Miam
[1:08:33] danced in the spirit and David danced
[1:08:34] when he had the victory. And oh, many
[1:08:36] times it was all through. It was
[1:08:37] victory. It was a dancing. It was holy
[1:08:38] dancing. For instance, in the Bible, if
[1:08:40] a dreamer dreamed a dream or a prophet
[1:08:42] prophesied, they had a plate called the
[1:08:43] German thumb. The German thumb and that
[1:08:45] went over the breast of Aaron. And when
[1:08:47] they went before this plate and spoke
[1:08:49] and them lights flashed on the plate,
[1:08:51] God would sanction it that it was the
[1:08:53] truth. Is that right? He said, "If it
[1:08:55] didn't speak on there, then it was
[1:08:56] wrong." Now look, the devil come around
[1:08:58] in a pattern of that and took a crystal
[1:09:00] ball. So, I want you to know that the
[1:09:01] devil's got a crystal ball to show you,
[1:09:03] well, this is what you're doing. Or the
[1:09:04] devil's got a worldly dance to tell you,
[1:09:06] well, this is what it looks like. Come
[1:09:07] on, church. The devil's got all kinds of
[1:09:09] impersonations of speaking in tonesues.
[1:09:11] But there is a real true speaking in
[1:09:12] tonesues.
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; There is a true. Just because there's a
[1:09:17] false $100 bill, you're still going to
[1:09:19] have a $100 bill in your pocket if you
[1:09:21] got one. You didn't start throwing away
[1:09:23] your money because there's counterfeit.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; Well, let's stay right here for a
[1:09:27] minute.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; You didn't go home and empty your cash
[1:09:32] drawers. If you do, give it to me. I
[1:09:33] could use it.
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; If you're going to get rid of a of a of
[1:09:37] stuff because the devil's got a
[1:09:39] counterfeit, get rid of all your money.
[1:09:44] Don't tell me you got love because the
[1:09:46] devil sure counterfeited that.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; The devil's got all kinds of things.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; But why is it that we want to do away
[1:09:53] with the move of the spirit out of the
[1:09:55] church because there's a counterfeit to
[1:09:56] it.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; There's a real
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; and the believers know that when the
[1:10:01] spirit of the Lord is moving you, we
[1:10:03] don't hold back and start criticizing.
[1:10:05] No, we say, "Be it unto me according to
[1:10:07] thy word.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; I'll take whatever he's got for me. If
[1:10:10] it makes me want to shout, then I'll
[1:10:11] shout. If it makes me want to dance,
[1:10:13] then we'll dance. If it makes me want to
[1:10:15] say amen, then the church can say amen.
[1:10:19] Listen, church, we've got all this stuff
[1:10:20] that's that's counterfeit and we're so
[1:10:22] scared of it and we're so fearful of it.
[1:10:24] I say cast down fear.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; Cast down reasoning. Cast down all these
[1:10:28] things. Amen. I I believe it was brother
[1:10:30] Matthew McGary spoke a sermon here. He
[1:10:32] said we he said, "Have you lost your
[1:10:33] mind?" And I'll say tonight, we need to
[1:10:35] lose our minds and take on that mind of
[1:10:38] Christ that that we don't start thinking
[1:10:39] like we used to think. We don't need to
[1:10:41] start thinking, well, you know what?
[1:10:43] When you get your own mind and your own
[1:10:44] intellectual thinking, you'll have a
[1:10:46] certain service going a certain way and
[1:10:48] you'll have certain people that have got
[1:10:49] certain problems and you don't want to
[1:10:50] be around them. And you'll start, well,
[1:10:52] can you say amen? Well, I don't want to
[1:10:53] hang out with them because they they
[1:10:55] they got all kinds of problems there.
[1:10:56] And I don't want to go to this meeting
[1:10:58] over here because the young people
[1:10:59] screamed or the shouted. I don't want to
[1:11:00] go to this youth camp. Well, can you say
[1:11:02] amen what it is? You're sitting in the
[1:11:04] seat of the scornful. If you get out of
[1:11:06] the seat, you'll see God move for you,
[1:11:08] too.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; He's no respector of persons. He don't
[1:11:11] want to just give it to one and not the
[1:11:12] other. No, the rain falls on the just
[1:11:14] and the unjust. But what we've decided
[1:11:16] is it just falls on the unjust. No, it
[1:11:18] falls on the just, too.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; It falls on the just and the unjust. So,
[1:11:24] the just can't have it no more. We got
[1:11:26] to dry up.
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; We're scared to death. We got
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord anyway. Is it is
[1:11:33] it is it true or not?
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; And what I'm saying is there's a spirit
[1:11:37] and I'm thanking the Lord that we have a
[1:11:39] church where we can preach freely and
[1:11:41] the people receive it. I love that. I I
[1:11:43] am I'm I love you people more than you
[1:11:45] can imagine. And I I haven't preached
[1:11:46] out a lot, but the few times I have, I a
[1:11:48] lot of times I just want to go home.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; And because, you know, you people are
[1:11:54] pretty easy to preach to. And I I
[1:11:55] appreciate that. And I I you know, I
[1:11:57] haven't been preaching very long. And I
[1:11:58] understand I I know my limitations and
[1:12:00] and all those things. And you guys still
[1:12:02] sit here. You you knew I was preaching
[1:12:03] this afternoon and you still came back.
[1:12:06] And so I love you for that. I really do.
[1:12:09] I think more of you than I ever did.
[1:12:12] But I want to tell you this. We got to
[1:12:14] be careful to let the spirit of a cold
[1:12:16] church, formal church come in here, too.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; Because the devil would like nothing
[1:12:20] more than the word of God being preached
[1:12:22] across this pulpit and the people sit
[1:12:24] there and get nothing out of it.
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; He don't care if it's being preached if
[1:12:27] the people aren't receiving it.
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; It's exactly right. He don't care if the
[1:12:31] preacher standing here and and and
[1:12:33] preaching exactly the word of God as
[1:12:35] long as the people don't catch what he's
[1:12:36] saying. And and so tonight you I know
[1:12:39] this morning was very different and and
[1:12:40] I enjoyed preaching this morning maybe a
[1:12:42] little more but tonight I feel like what
[1:12:44] we're fighting in this hour is even when
[1:12:45] the word goes forth it's a spirit of of
[1:12:48] Leodysia that's on us that you know we
[1:12:50] can move a little bit but we're
[1:12:51] lukewarm. We're not cold or hot. And I
[1:12:54] tell you that's the that that's the
[1:12:56] church that God said he would spew out
[1:12:57] of his mouth. He said you this is his
[1:13:00] words. He said you nauseate me. I don't
[1:13:02] want to be a church that nauseates God.
[1:13:04] I want to be a church that's on fire for
[1:13:06] God. Amen. He's pleased with our
[1:13:08] worship. He's pleased with the way we
[1:13:09] come to church under expectations.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; Are you still with me so far? Brother
[1:13:15] Brandon would go on like this. He said,
[1:13:17] he said, "The devil come around pattern
[1:13:19] patterned that and took a crystal ball."
[1:13:20] He said, "Now I wonder." He said, "You
[1:13:22] got your feet converted. You don't dance
[1:13:24] anymore out there for the world." He
[1:13:26] said, "Let's patter our feet to the
[1:13:27] Lord." He said, "As your hands
[1:13:29] converted, you don't steal anymore. Your
[1:13:31] lips are converted. You don't lie
[1:13:32] anymore. Just get Don't just" He said,
[1:13:34] "Just don't get religion in your head.
[1:13:36] get it all over you.
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; Well, that sounds like Pentecostal
[1:13:40] preaching, but I'd say amen to it.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; Because we don't just need a
[1:13:44] headnowledge religion. We don't just
[1:13:46] need a religion that makes us go to
[1:13:48] church because we feel that we're
[1:13:49] obligated to go to church. We need a
[1:13:51] religion that makes us want to go to
[1:13:53] church.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; We need a religion that makes us want to
[1:13:56] praise God in church. The preacher
[1:13:57] shouldn't have to pull for it or pump
[1:13:59] you for it. He shouldn't have to beg you
[1:14:01] to say, "Amen." I do it out of habit.
[1:14:02] I'm not really begging,
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; but the people respond anyway.
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; The people respond. Listen, I hope this
[1:14:10] is okay tonight. This is on my heart.
[1:14:11] Listen, we don't want to fall into the
[1:14:13] trap of the of the of the devil that is
[1:14:15] even using message quotes and saying,
[1:14:16] "Well, we got to stabilize the ship and
[1:14:18] and we've got to be sane and sensible."
[1:14:20] All they're trying to do is get you away
[1:14:22] from the blessings that God has given
[1:14:24] his bride.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; Trying to use quotes to do it.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; And they're taking them so out of
[1:14:29] context. We are a balanced people. We
[1:14:32] are a people that we know where we stand
[1:14:33] and we are anchored to the rock. We are
[1:14:35] a ship that's not going to be moved with
[1:14:37] every wave that comes around, but we can
[1:14:39] still worship.
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; See, you can still be anchored to
[1:14:44] Revelation and still have a good time in
[1:14:46] church.
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; I, you know, here we go. I I I remember
[1:14:52] as a kid uh in our church, we didn't
[1:14:54] have a lot of emotion. uh you know,
[1:14:56] didn't seem like and uh and so and then
[1:14:59] I ended up in a church uh for about 10
[1:15:01] years. They were real emotional for a
[1:15:03] while and then it kind of just died out
[1:15:04] and and the next thing you know it was
[1:15:06] so quiet in there like it's so quiet
[1:15:08] that when you hear the term you could
[1:15:09] hear a pin drop. You really could hear a
[1:15:11] pin drop at any point during the
[1:15:13] service. So So I I I've been in dead
[1:15:16] churches.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; You say, "Why are you calling them
[1:15:18] dead?" I'm telling you,
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; if the spirit of the Lord was there,
[1:15:21] there would be some liberty to say amen.
[1:15:23] But the last time I went, when I said
[1:15:24] amen to something, there was a preacher
[1:15:25] there said something. And I went and I
[1:15:26] said, "Amen." And and people, you've
[1:15:29] heard the quote where Brother Bram said,
[1:15:30] "Somebody say amen." And everybody start
[1:15:32] looking around at him. I I've I've
[1:15:35] witnessed that. And I'm I'm here to tell
[1:15:37] you.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; I'm here to tell you that's a dead
[1:15:40] church.
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; You said, "Well, you don't call me a
[1:15:42] dead church." You're a dead church if
[1:15:43] that's what you got going on. You need
[1:15:45] to get them people out of that dead
[1:15:46] mully grubs and get them back into the
[1:15:48] life of God again. You say, "Well, I we
[1:15:50] got the message. We got the tapes. We
[1:15:52] you might have all those things, but
[1:15:54] what you need is to fall in love with
[1:15:55] Jesus again and worship him like you've
[1:15:58] never worshiped before.
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; That's the truth anyway.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; And so people can do what they want in
[1:16:05] their church. But to you people here
[1:16:07] today, let's not fall into that. Let's
[1:16:09] not we don't want that condition. We
[1:16:11] don't want to We don't want Brother Joe
[1:16:12] when he comes back to be walking around
[1:16:14] checking for pulse.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; We don't need to be checking for pulse
[1:16:18] in our church. If you're checking for
[1:16:19] pulse, then there's something wrong. We
[1:16:21] need to be we need to be a lively group
[1:16:23] of people. There's listen, lively
[1:16:24] stones. And and listen, I I know there's
[1:16:26] a time where where there's teaching and
[1:16:28] I know there's a time where where it
[1:16:29] gets so somber and and I know there's
[1:16:31] been a time I've seen the spirit of the
[1:16:32] Lord move into a service and it's quiet
[1:16:34] and and I don't want to criticize that.
[1:16:37] I don't want to criticize that at all
[1:16:38] because that's just as real as the
[1:16:40] emotional side where everybody's jumping
[1:16:41] and running. It's just as real. So, we
[1:16:43] don't want to go one extreme here and
[1:16:45] one extreme there. No, we want
[1:16:47] everything that God's got for us. And so
[1:16:49] if the Lord moves in a service and and
[1:16:51] the people sit there and the Lord does
[1:16:53] nothing but move them to cry and and
[1:16:55] maybe some of them just sit there in the
[1:16:57] stillness of the moment, the Holy
[1:16:58] Spirit's just all over them and maybe it
[1:17:00] makes you not move a muscle, but that's
[1:17:02] very different than falling asleep in
[1:17:04] church.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; Is that okay?
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; Very different. It's very different for
[1:17:12] the sweet Holy Spirit to be sitting on
[1:17:14] somebody and the Holy Ghost just working
[1:17:17] all through them and they're quiet. It's
[1:17:20] a whole lot different than somebody come
[1:17:22] in there, fold their arms, sit in the
[1:17:24] seat of the critics and they'll tell you
[1:17:26] that somebody in the church didn't be
[1:17:28] like, "Man, them people wouldn't even
[1:17:30] clap their hands." I'm the song leader
[1:17:32] sometimes. I know exactly who don't clap
[1:17:34] their hands.
[1:17:35] But I'll tell you, you know what it is?
[1:17:38] Everybody worships different. There's
[1:17:41] some people, I won't tell you who it is
[1:17:42] in our church, but there's some people
[1:17:43] that can't clap and sing at the same
[1:17:44] time.
[1:17:46] I've told them just clap. No, nobody can
[1:17:49] hear you anyway, but just clap. But but
[1:17:52] you know, the truth of it is everybody's
[1:17:54] everybody's got different ways of
[1:17:56] worship. I don't care which way you
[1:17:57] worship. But I tell you what you got to
[1:17:59] do is worship.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; And I tell you what you don't want to do
[1:18:03] is is get Let me just go ahead and open
[1:18:06] up to you because I'm about out of time
[1:18:07] and I might as well just say what's on
[1:18:09] my heart.
[1:18:11] might as well do it. You know, this is
[1:18:13] my last service. This morning I had to
[1:18:14] come back and preach again, but tonight
[1:18:15] I can get out of dodge.
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; But you know what the truth of it is? We
[1:18:20] come under we come we we come to service
[1:18:23] sometimes and even myself if you're a
[1:18:26] song leader, song leaders will know
[1:18:28] this. Sometimes you sit there and the
[1:18:30] first thing you notice is the people who
[1:18:31] are not worshiping.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; You know what? You know what shows you
[1:18:35] that the devil's trying to get your eyes
[1:18:37] on that
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; because that it's true. I'm just opening
[1:18:39] it up and being honest with you. That's
[1:18:41] the first thing you see is you see the
[1:18:42] ones that it's why I said I know who
[1:18:43] don't clap because that's literally who
[1:18:45] I see first. I don't see who claps. I
[1:18:47] see who don't clap. And then I also you
[1:18:49] you'll see the ones that are singing
[1:18:51] with you and worshiping got their hands
[1:18:52] up. But but but what you really notice
[1:18:54] is the ones who don't worship.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; And you know what that is? That's me
[1:18:59] sitting in the seat of the scornful.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; That's just the truth of it.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; Now, how do you get out of that?
[1:19:05] Sometimes it sometimes it don't come.
[1:19:06] Sometimes I sometimes I rebuke you for
[1:19:09] not clapping or something, but but you
[1:19:10] know that's just me being stupid. I just
[1:19:12] got to grow. But but the truth of it is
[1:19:16] y'all have got a lot of grace on me and
[1:19:17] I appreciate that. But the truth of it
[1:19:19] is we can criticize one another, but we
[1:19:23] all need more of God.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; I can pick on I can find things in your
[1:19:29] life and you can find things in my life.
[1:19:31] We can we can we can sit there and we
[1:19:32] can just have a day picking on one
[1:19:34] another and how we worship and how we
[1:19:36] act. And listen, I don't want to pick on
[1:19:37] your worship, but I want us to all
[1:19:39] worship.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; And and I want to say this, if we're
[1:19:43] sitting there and and we're saying,
[1:19:45] "Well, they didn't raise their hands
[1:19:46] like they should." I you know what we
[1:19:48] could do? We could pray for people
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; and that might do a lot of good. But the
[1:19:52] main thing that I want to get to you
[1:19:54] today is let us get out of the seat of
[1:19:55] the scornful because you ain't doing
[1:19:57] nobody no good sitting there. It's time
[1:20:00] to change seats. It's time to get out of
[1:20:02] that seat and and quit coming to church
[1:20:04] looking for the ones I'm I'm preaching
[1:20:06] to myself, too. It's time to quit
[1:20:07] looking at the ones that don't worship.
[1:20:09] It's time Let you be the firehouse for
[1:20:11] God.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; Let you be the revival for God. And if
[1:20:14] you're on revival, you know, a wildfire,
[1:20:16] it kind of spreads. You get one person
[1:20:18] in church that likes to likes to shout a
[1:20:20] little bit and just let's let's loosen
[1:20:21] the presence of God. The next thing you
[1:20:23] know, somebody else might do it. I know
[1:20:24] somebody will criticize and say, "Well,
[1:20:26] they never did it before, but now
[1:20:27] they're doing it." Well, maybe they felt
[1:20:29] free to do it now all of a sudden.
[1:20:30] Listen, I ain't going to criticize how
[1:20:32] you worship, but we must worship God.
[1:20:34] The true worshippers must worship God in
[1:20:38] spirit and truth.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; I don't have any Bible that says that we
[1:20:41] can't worship on a certain time during
[1:20:43] the service or we can only worship at
[1:20:44] the end. Listen, I know there's a
[1:20:46] pattern to service and I know there's a
[1:20:48] church order, but I also have a quote
[1:20:50] that says you need to get out of order
[1:20:51] long enough to get saved.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; And we got some young people here that
[1:20:55] need to see God move in their lives. We
[1:20:57] got some old people here that need to
[1:20:58] see God moving in their lives. We got
[1:21:00] some people need the Holy Ghost. I don't
[1:21:02] want to see the wet blankets on our
[1:21:03] young people. I don't want to see them
[1:21:05] go through a time when the Holy Spirit
[1:21:06] moves on them to move and we've somebody
[1:21:08] sitting back behind them. Well, they're
[1:21:10] just going to the altar like they do
[1:21:11] every service. Let them go until they
[1:21:13] get something from God.
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; Every young person needs an experience.
[1:21:18] Let them go till they get their
[1:21:19] experience. And we ain't going to do no
[1:21:20] good if we're always telling them,
[1:21:22] "Well, you went last week. You don't
[1:21:23] need to go again." No. encourage them
[1:21:25] and let them say, "Listen, if you didn't
[1:21:27] get what you went for, go right on back
[1:21:29] again. The altar is always going to be
[1:21:31] open in this church here." Why? Because
[1:21:33] we believe that an altar experience
[1:21:35] still works.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; We absolutely do. We still believe in
[1:21:38] prayer lines. We still believe in laying
[1:21:40] hands on the sick. We still believe in
[1:21:42] somebody getting down to the altar and
[1:21:44] crying out to God, right? All all by
[1:21:45] themselves. We still believe in all
[1:21:47] these things. Why? Because God is not
[1:21:49] the author of confusion. And he placed
[1:21:51] these things in the church not to take
[1:21:53] them out, but he left them here so that
[1:21:55] we could have access to different ways
[1:21:57] of reaching the people. Listen, if it's
[1:21:59] an altar for you and maybe another
[1:22:01] person received the same Holy Ghost in
[1:22:03] their seat, don't criticize the one at
[1:22:05] the altar.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; Well, I received it right in my seat. I
[1:22:10] received it in my in my closet, my
[1:22:12] prayer closet. You may have. And another
[1:22:14] person might have got in a prayer line.
[1:22:16] Another person I'm just being honest
[1:22:17] with you today, church. We we we've
[1:22:19] decided how God's got to move for our
[1:22:21] young people and how God's got to move
[1:22:23] for our old people. But I say every one
[1:22:24] of us need a new experience with God.
[1:22:26] Every one of us need to cry out, "Lord,
[1:22:28] come by my way and refill me with the
[1:22:30] Holy Ghost."
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; Every one of us, if you're in the seat
[1:22:34] of the scornful tonight, I say, "Get out
[1:22:36] of the seat and worship God." Amen.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon was up there in the
[1:22:41] woods there and he you remember the you
[1:22:43] remember that uh you remember that that
[1:22:46] big eagle that come down there and and
[1:22:47] and and he was sitting there and he had
[1:22:49] this little he had this little uh what
[1:22:51] do you call it? a brown squirrel, I
[1:22:52] believe it was. And and he had a brother
[1:22:55] Bram calls him snickler fritz actually
[1:22:56] in the quote I brought out, but uh I
[1:22:59] don't know if that's what he was a pine
[1:23:01] squirrel, maybe. Was that what he was? A
[1:23:02] pine squirrel. And he's down there and
[1:23:04] he he's making all kinds of noise,
[1:23:06] chatter, chatter, chatter. You know,
[1:23:08] days of miracles has passed. Brother
[1:23:09] Brandham said, and he would just, you
[1:23:10] know, brother Brandon was interpreting
[1:23:11] that squirrel. Hallelujah. And he was
[1:23:13] telling us what he said. And days of
[1:23:15] miracles has passed and you know,
[1:23:16] there's no more divine healing and all
[1:23:18] these things. But you know, that that
[1:23:19] comes on the minds of some of us
[1:23:20] sometimes. We don't see healing like we
[1:23:22] want to. And and I thank God for the
[1:23:24] blessings in the meeting. We see people
[1:23:25] getting healed and it really raises your
[1:23:27] faith. It really does. But but sometimes
[1:23:29] if we're not careful, even us, even even
[1:23:31] believers will sit there, well, you
[1:23:33] know, it's all drying up. It's all and
[1:23:34] we focus on the negative so much
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; that we forget that there is a positive,
[1:23:39] that there will be a bride.
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; We forget that there is a positive.
[1:23:42] There's another generation raising up in
[1:23:44] this message. And yes, it's it's scary
[1:23:46] at times because you think, you know,
[1:23:48] it's going to fall on our shoulders to
[1:23:49] make sure that next generation gets
[1:23:51] everything they have have need of and
[1:23:53] and we don't run them off like the
[1:23:54] previous generations have been done.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; A lot of people sit in the seat of the
[1:23:59] scornful for all these years and have
[1:24:01] run off generations of message people.
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; I say it's time we stop that nonsense
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; and we start letting our young people be
[1:24:10] young people.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; I know. I know some of the old-timers
[1:24:14] around here are going to tell me I'm
[1:24:15] wrong on this, but I want you to know I
[1:24:17] I I grew up different than you did. You
[1:24:19] grew up different than they did, and you
[1:24:20] do not have the same devil of technology
[1:24:23] to fight that they do.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; You don't have it. Well,
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; I can I have five minutes?
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; Okay. Because I think I'm about five
[1:24:35] over already. But you think about it.
[1:24:38] These people are growing up with stuff
[1:24:40] that they have access to that you didn't
[1:24:41] even know existed.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, it's the same devil." It
[1:24:45] is, but it gets worse and worse and
[1:24:48] worse.
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; Every generation, it gets worse and
[1:24:52] worse. And that's why every generation
[1:24:54] has got to have their revival.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; Because the same God that saved you,
[1:24:58] Brother Bill, the same God that saved
[1:25:00] you, Brother Jeff, the same God, the
[1:25:02] same brother Danny, these elders sitting
[1:25:03] here, that same God is still able to
[1:25:06] save a young person. Amen.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; If he did it for you, he can do it for
[1:25:10] them. I know we're fighting a battle. I
[1:25:12] know that there's a that there's a lot
[1:25:14] against our young people, but greater is
[1:25:16] he that is in them than he that is in
[1:25:18] the world. And so I instead of
[1:25:20] criticizing the youth, what about
[1:25:22] saying, you know what, I'm going to
[1:25:23] start praying for them. I'm going to
[1:25:25] start getting down before the Lord and
[1:25:27] realizing they're fighting a battle I
[1:25:28] never fought. And I'm going to say,
[1:25:30] Lord, don't let me criticize the youth,
[1:25:32] but let me pray for them. And if they
[1:25:34] got to if they got to act like children
[1:25:36] a little bit, let them act like
[1:25:38] children. You you got to learn to crawl
[1:25:39] before you can learn to walk.
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; Y'all okay with me so far?
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; All right, we're just about done.
[1:25:47] Brother Brandham said he wants soldiers
[1:25:48] backbones, not wishbones. He wants
[1:25:50] somebody that's got spunk enough and
[1:25:52] spirit enough to stand up. And he said,
[1:25:53] "I saw God in that eagle there. He
[1:25:55] wasn't afraid. He wasn't a bit scared.
[1:25:57] He wasn't scared of that little of that
[1:25:58] little chatter that said the days of
[1:26:00] miracles in the past. I'm not scared of
[1:26:01] it either because I know that the word
[1:26:02] of God that I stand on is an unmovable
[1:26:05] rock. Amen. I know that what God has
[1:26:07] given us in this hour is a message that
[1:26:09] cannot be shaken from my heart. Can you
[1:26:11] say amen? And I know that if I believe
[1:26:13] this message with all my heart and I and
[1:26:15] I follow this message, then I'm not
[1:26:16] going to fall in some ditch of man-made
[1:26:18] theology and I'm not going to fall in
[1:26:20] this ditch over here of of anti-emotion
[1:26:22] or pro emotion only. No, but I'm going
[1:26:24] to stay with the word and the spirit
[1:26:26] because that's how a true worshipper
[1:26:28] worships God. And here tonight, if
[1:26:30] you're sitting in the seat of the
[1:26:31] scornful and you're laughing at those
[1:26:32] who danced and you're laughing at those
[1:26:34] who shouted, listen, I know that the
[1:26:36] devil's going to give you plenty to
[1:26:37] laugh at. But I want you to notice
[1:26:39] tonight that there's a lot of real going
[1:26:40] on in the message today. And I want to
[1:26:43] say that I've seen our young people in a
[1:26:45] prayer line and they'd lose themselves
[1:26:46] in that prayer line. You think for one
[1:26:48] minute I want to call that a devil? No,
[1:26:50] sir. I say that was the Holy Ghost on
[1:26:52] them. And and if they need if if it
[1:26:53] wasn't real that time, I'm going to be
[1:26:55] pulling for them to get it on the next
[1:26:56] time. Yeah.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; Well, that was just an emotion. I say
[1:27:00] let it let it be emotion if that's what
[1:27:02] it is. But I want you to know that the
[1:27:04] same God that give that gave it to the
[1:27:06] other one down at the other end of the
[1:27:07] line can give it to the one at this end
[1:27:08] of the line. Listen, it's not about
[1:27:10] who's who. It's not about what your name
[1:27:12] is. It's not about it's not about how
[1:27:14] old the young person is or how young
[1:27:16] they are. But God is no respector of
[1:27:18] persons. God will pour his spirit out on
[1:27:21] all flesh. But the bride knows what he
[1:27:24] wants done with his word. And the bride
[1:27:26] is going to be so stimulated by
[1:27:28] revelation that you don't see you you
[1:27:30] don't look through the eyes of the
[1:27:32] critics anymore but you actually see
[1:27:34] what God has for you through the lens of
[1:27:36] the word.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; Brother Random said he would talk to
[1:27:41] that eagle. He said he said I thought
[1:27:43] I'll just see how afraid he is. Fella,
[1:27:46] you know I could shoot you. When my
[1:27:48] voice rang out, he looked at me real
[1:27:49] close and rolled them big eyes.
[1:27:52] There was no fear.
[1:27:54] And I wanted to say tonight in closing
[1:27:56] because my time is passed up. I want to
[1:28:00] say tonight in closing, there is no fear
[1:28:04] in the bride.
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; Yes, Satan will try to give you fear.
[1:28:09] He'll try to give you anxiety.
[1:28:11] He'll try to make you look at people and
[1:28:14] think the worst about him.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; But this bride knows that there is no
[1:28:17] limit to what God can do.
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; The worst person in this building this
[1:28:20] afternoon can be saved, sealed, and
[1:28:22] delivered by God. the worst person in
[1:28:25] the building. Start looking down on one
[1:28:27] another. What you find is legalism
[1:28:30] always breeds hypocrisy.
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; I've always been good. I've always been
[1:28:37] I've always did everything right. And
[1:28:39] you've just you've been just as vile as
[1:28:42] the worst sinner in town.
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; If it wasn't for God's grace, where
[1:28:47] would any of us be?
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; His grace and mercy brought us through.
[1:28:51] Come on.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; I'm I don't have any right to criticize
[1:28:53] somebody that God's working on
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; because God may have them at the
[1:28:57] beginning of their journey and maybe I'm
[1:28:58] in the middle of my journey, but
[1:29:00] wherever we are, let's build each other
[1:29:02] up and get out of the seat of the
[1:29:04] scornful.
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; Is that okay today?
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; I know this has been kind of simple.
[1:29:11] This is what was on my heart. You can
[1:29:13] call us holy rollers. You can call us
[1:29:14] what you want to, but we know there's
[1:29:15] going to be a rapture.
[1:29:17] And all we want is those who are
[1:29:19] struggling to get on board.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; Overcome.
[1:29:23] You're you're not going to overcome by
[1:29:25] by running them down and running them
[1:29:26] out of the church.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; They're going to overcome a whole lot
[1:29:32] better sitting right here in the
[1:29:33] presence of God.
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Joel, who you talking
[1:29:37] to today?" I'm talking to me. It ain't
[1:29:39] right for me to stand here and think
[1:29:42] evil of the people of God when his
[1:29:44] thoughts of you were good thoughts.
[1:29:47] Right.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; It ain't right for me or anybody else to
[1:29:50] stand here and criticize God's elect
[1:29:53] when you were literally chosen
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; to be the greatest people on the face of
[1:29:57] the earth.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; And I say it don't just go for me, but
[1:30:00] it goes for every one of us. You can
[1:30:01] criticize all you want to. Amen. But it
[1:30:03] don't hurt nobody but you. the people
[1:30:05] that are going that they can look beyond
[1:30:07] the critics. But I want you to know
[1:30:08] tonight, let us all get rid of our
[1:30:10] critical spirits and let's get out of
[1:30:12] the seat of the scornful and pull
[1:30:14] together in this great army of God and
[1:30:16] shout when we need to shout and say,
[1:30:18] "Young people, if you need an experience
[1:30:20] that is a Pentecostal experience, then
[1:30:22] have your experience and the old people
[1:30:23] are going to pull right along with
[1:30:24] them."
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; If you ain't pulling for nobody else,
[1:30:27] pull for somebody else. Don't If you
[1:30:29] ain't pulling for yourself, pull for
[1:30:30] somebody else. You say, "Well, I I just
[1:30:32] don't feel like it anymore." then get on
[1:30:33] board for the rest of the people. I
[1:30:35] think our pastor preached it here last
[1:30:36] week. If you don't feel like there's
[1:30:38] anything left for you to receive,
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; do it for somebody else.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; When David couldn't build the temple,
[1:30:45] sir,
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; I believe that brother Ben said this.
[1:30:48] When he couldn't build the temple, he
[1:30:50] still made sir.
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; He still made the nails.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; If that's all I can do, then Lord, let
[1:30:54] me do it and let me get out of the seat
[1:30:56] of the scornful. Let's stand as our
[1:30:58] musicians come. You love the Lord
[1:31:00] tonight.
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; Has he been good to us?
[1:31:03] What do we deserve? Nothing.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; But what does he deserve?
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; All of our praise.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; We didn't deserve life, but here we are.
[1:31:13] We didn't deserve the message, but here
[1:31:15] we are.
[1:31:17] We're unworthy.
[1:31:20] Unworthy. Anybody else feel like that? I
[1:31:23] feel unworthy to stand in this pulpit.
[1:31:26] Every time I stand here, it crosses my
[1:31:29] mind that I shouldn't be in this pulpit
[1:31:30] because I'm unworthy.
[1:31:34] But can I go ahead and tell you
[1:31:35] something? You're unworthy. I'm
[1:31:38] unworthy.
[1:31:41] But the blood has covered every one of
[1:31:42] us.
[1:31:45] And where would I be if it wasn't for
[1:31:48] the grace of God? Brother Jared, where
[1:31:50] would you be if it wasn't for the grace
[1:31:51] of God?
[1:31:53] If it wasn't for grace, none of us could
[1:31:55] sit here and feel the presence of God we
[1:31:58] feel right here tonight. I want to tell
[1:32:00] you something, church. If you're sitting
[1:32:03] there and you still got that critical
[1:32:04] spirit on you, I say it's time to repent
[1:32:06] of that thing and lay it down at the
[1:32:08] altar tonight. Let us sing all with all
[1:32:10] of our hearts. Now, if you need to come
[1:32:11] to the altar, it's always open. God
[1:32:13] bless you. You only know. I'm glad you
[1:32:18] see. I'm glad you see
[1:32:22] through eyes
[1:32:24] of love.
[1:32:26] I was a hopeless case,
[1:32:30] an empty
[1:32:32] place.
[1:32:34] If not, oh, think about his grace here
[1:32:37] tonight. Amazing grace,
[1:32:42] how sweet the sound.
[1:32:46] I once was lost,
[1:32:50] but now I'm found.
[1:32:54] was a hopeless case,
[1:32:58] an empty
[1:33:00] place.
[1:33:02] If not, oh precious Lord,
[1:33:06] oh precious Lord,
[1:33:10] please take my hand.
[1:33:14] Won't you lead me on
[1:33:18] and let me stand?
[1:33:22] I was a hopeless case
[1:33:26] and empty.
[1:33:29] And when you realize it was all grace,
[1:33:31] it'll make it'll make you look at your
[1:33:32] brother and sister different, won't it?
[1:33:35] Won't it make you look at him different?
[1:33:38] When you realize it took grace for you,
[1:33:41] it took grace for me. Without his grace,
[1:33:43] none of us could be here today. But
[1:33:45] aren't you thankful for the grace and
