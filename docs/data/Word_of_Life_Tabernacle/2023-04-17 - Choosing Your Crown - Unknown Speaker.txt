just want to take a second to thank brother Ben for having me and and just a privilege and an honor to be here in the house of the Lord with you and hopefully we can say something and be a help to somebody tonight so Hebrews the 11th chapter for you while we're all standing we'll go right straight into the word tonight and certainly appreciate that fine meal we had between Services there appreciate all the effort that goes into the to doing that and I know the sisters get out there and get it all ready and then you know everybody eats and then they pick it all back up clean it up and I know how much work that is I appreciate that thank you so much I certainly enjoyed that Hebrews the 11th chapter and we'll start about the 32nd verse Hebrews 11 32. you just say Amen when you got that a couple of you didn't say Amen Hebrews 11 32. and what shall I more say for the time would fail me to tell a Gideon and a Barrack and of Samson and of jephth of David also and of Samuel and of the prophets who through faith subdued kingdoms brought righteousness obtained promises stop the mouth of lions quench the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong waxed Valiant and fight turn to flight the armies of the aliens women received their dead Rays to life again and others were tortured not accepting Deliverance that they might obtain a better Resurrection and others had a trial of cruel mockings and scourgings yay moreover of bonds and imprisonments they were stoned they were sought asunder they were tempted were slain with a sword they wandered about in sheepskins and goat skins been destitute Afflicted tormented of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens and caves of the Earth all uh and all and these all having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect man and over in second Timothy the third chapter while you're turning there let me just ask you this question Saints tonight that passage a scripture that I just read there to you does that sound like a group of people that had it easy does it sound like a group of people that everything was going their way all the time or does it sound like a group of people that never had to fight or never had to never had to push or never got caught in a trap or never had a hard day or anything like that or or does that sound like a people that had to push and strive and try and and and do all they could to try to move up just a little higher in the kingdom of God right second Timothy the third chapter 10th verse but thou has fully known my Doctrine manner of life purpose Faith long-suffering charity patience persecutions afflictions which came unto me at Antioch and Iconium at lystra what persecutions I endured but out of them all the Lord delivered me yea and all that will live Godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution can't we just bow our heads Heavenly Father we thank you tonight for this precious word and Lord we just ask oh God that you would Lord any man could open the pages of the Bible Lord but it takes you to openly understanding thereof and we ask oh God you open our understanding tonight Lord I just pray you anoint this service I ask oh God you would speak to us Lord and and I pray you'd minister to the needs here Lord I ask that you would walk up and down these aisles Lord and and Lord just speak to your people I pray oh God I ask that you would just anoint us father to to Lord as I speak Lord but not only that but it takes the everybody Lord anoint the ears Lord anoint or worship father just well Lord we can do all we can do but Lord it takes your presence Lord for us to move up into the kingdom of God tonight and we just pray you'd break to us the bread of life I ask you to Watch Over Me bind my lips before I'd speak anything unpleasing to you and we're committed into your hands now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and the church said amen and I want to talk on the text of choosing your crown tonight choosing your crown and and so I read that little portion of scripture to your Saints and uh uh and I'll just tell you if you're serving the lord the trials of life will come that's right yeah the tests will come yes true there's going to be hard times in your life if you're serving the lord the the Bible said that all that live Godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution right is that right Saints y'all women here in the United States all right everybody had too much pasta I guess we got too many carbohydrates circulated through our bloodstream tonight so let's uh maybe we can do some calisthenics do some jumping jacks or something but y'all stay with me tonight Sanson and so he said if you if the if you're serving the lord the trials of life will come all all that live Godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution amen and we find a great example of that in Hebrews 11 and and you you find that God's people are just you know we're going to have some tough times well look it's because we don't belong here this is not our home tonight amen if we pick this church up tonight and and we dropped it in the middle of Togo where brother Ben just came back from that then you're going to be uncomfortable there yeah you don't belong there you don't know what people are saying you don't know what to eat you know you don't know what might be going to attack you out of the Jungle is that right now you wouldn't be comfortable there because you don't belong there amen well we're Believers tonight but we don't belong here this is not our home we're pilgrims and strangers here tonight is that right and as long as you don't belong here there's a quote where brother Brandon says we're only here preparing to leave we're we're here with the purpose of getting out of here we're going through the preparation now to go home and as long as we're somewhere where we don't truly belong we're going to be uncomfortable Saints right trials will come tests will come yes yes is that right and you you know tonight in a church like this there's going to be people that's going through all sorts of different things all sorts of different trials and and I'll tell you this in this life you either coming out of a trial you're in the middle of a trial or you're going into a trial but the trials are going to come and we find people deal with all kinds of different things you can have people in this church tonight going through a trial of Faith you can have people that that the devil's eating away at they're trying to make them doubt whether this message is even the truth or not whether whether it's even right or not or or or or or maybe better yet if you're like me and you're so far gone that the devil's just kind of give up trying to do that that's what he will tell you is okay the message is right but you're just you're not good enough to live the message so then he tries to cast doubts that you're able to make it wait none of us good enough to live in Saints but he was good enough I'm counting on that tonight amen I can't live it in myself but he can live it through me is that right amen but you know you're gonna find that just there's just times in your life you go through trials you're going to find there's times in your life you might get into a disagreement with somebody yeah that's right you know and they can get pretty heated sometimes and sometimes you'll find people that used to be in your life but they're not there anymore it's like I've lost friends I'll just tell you I've had people that's in my life that used to be very close to me and are not there anymore Trials of life will come tests will come persecution will come right amen death will come it strikes all of us at one time enough you live long enough you're going to lose somebody that's important to you yes you're going to go through trials you might get sick in your body at some point you know you never appreciate being healthy until you have a sickness you have to deal with it and it can happen yeah our kids you might have a a dealt with a young person that's gone astray one of your children not acting right there's nothing that's helpless as a parent feeling when a child ain't acting right it's all you can think about it consumes your mind it bothers you it's always on your mind when you're when your children aren't doing right they're not doing well with the Lord or they're not they're not acting right and that sort of thing it bothers you as a parent it's a trial to go through as a parent come on somebody testify away yeah and so we go through these trials your marriage sometimes might take a hit sometimes your marriage is not what you want it to be as as a as a as a married couple you're going to go through ups and downs is that right that's right there's times where you're going to be doing better than you are at other times and sometimes people think you know that it's all going to be look that's Hollywood stuff what do you think it's oh come on yeah marriage is hard thanks it's tough sometimes it's trials you got to go through um and and if you think anything else you're being deceived it's it's a tough thing and sometimes we go through tough times in our marriage and it's hard to serve the Lord when your marriage isn't doing right it makes it difficult to serve the Lord as as to the best of your abilities when your marriage isn't what it's supposed to be I'll tell you your marriage might take a hit sometime at some point news flash again here Saints at some point and sometime somebody may say something about you that's just not true that's true people say things sometimes that are not true and and there's it's a helpless feeling also when when somebody said something about you that's not true it hurts yeah you know what even if it's proven out that hey that wasn't the case and it wasn't that was just a lie it still leaves a scar on you these battles and trials and tests that we go through from time to time they leave a scar on us and brother Brown talked about how they build up on you yeah and the longer you go the more things can build up in your life is that right somebody testify with it home well the rest that I've been preaching for years and I've become an old man and an old veteran preacher and I had a lot of hard battles come on somebody that's ever had a hard battle amen and maybe I'm all scarred and cut up on the inside from fights she said because my luck that the lord gave me was not back to kiss the babies and to marry the young and bear the old but it was a whole of two-handed sword at the Battlefront against the walls of paganism and demonology and the powers of darkness and fight it with the word of God till I seen the enemy defeated he said I've been cut deep many times yeah and say so I'll tell you you may not be brother Branham but your call to this same word tonight amen and this ain't no baby kissing religion we got here someone called to kiss the babies and if you believe this message very long there's gonna be some trials yeah there's gonna be some tests amen the devil didn't like this message and he don't like you for believing it and there's going to be time times when your life where you're going to be persecuted with what you believe there's going to be trials for what you believe look I'll go ahead and tell you they didn't call me to to try to find all the mistakes in the message what the prophet said and if you believe that there's going to be some tests there's going to be some trials the trials of life will come the devil don't like this message and he don't like you for believing it and you're called to this very same word yes yes I don't understand how we believe God protected the Bible why we couldn't believe that God protected a message yeah oh come on yeah it's good all right no one who wants it in time brother Brown says this I sex people people just fail to execute good common sense a lot of times let me tell you some states there's only one Jesus Christ tonight amen now God now to Jesus Christ sent a prophet to this age but that Prophet was a man he was a man like you and I yeah amen yeah yeah now brother Brown said I wasn't the one that appeared down on the river that's right that's right I was only standing there when he appeared yeah yeah come on I'm not the one that performs these things and foretells these things that happens as perfect as they are I'm only the one that's near when he does it yeah oh yes I was only a voice that he used to say it it wasn't what I knew it was what I just surrendered myself to remember I said I didn't know those things I just surrendered myself to it yeah now you may not be brother Branham but that's the same thing you got to do to serve the Lord amen if you're a Sunday school teacher you got to surrender yourself to teach Sunday school if you're a musician you gotta surrender yourself just just to play a musical instrument if you're a preacher you got to surrender yourself to preach the gospel right right and then if you shout amen you got to surrender yourself to shout amen come on Amen if you can praise the Lord you've got to surrender yourself to praise the Lord amen if you can clap Hallelujah you gotta surrender yourself to be able to clap [Applause] we had to surrender ourselves and he said that I Just Surrender myself he spoke through he said it isn't me it wasn't the seventh angel oh no it was the manifestation of the son of man it wasn't the angel his message it was the mystery that God unfolded it's not a man it's God the angel was not the son of man he was the messenger from the Son of Man why people can't get that straight beyond me the angel was not the son of man he was the messenger from the Son of Man it wasn't the angel his message it was the mystery that God unfolded it's not a man it's God the angel was not the son of man he was the messenger from the son of man the son of man is Christ he's the one you're feeding on you're not feeding on a man his words will fail but you're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man thank you Lord yes come on somebody yeah I don't want to give you confidence tonight we're not feeding on a man's word yeah yeah and when you believe it like that Saints there's going to be some scars yes there's gonna be some tests when you hold this two-edged sword it's gonna be some bath you don't hold a sword unless you're going to battle Saints you're going to be under attack there's a lot of them say they believe this word but what they really mean is they just want to listen to a tape yeah but I don't want to just hear a message I want to live a message I want to produce the results the message promised I don't want to say I believe it's I want to act upon what I say I believe if you believe something you act upon it right yes now he says he says Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the gates of hell can I Prevail against you now see Satan hates Revelation worse than anything else if you follow the crowd everything be all right if you do what everybody else is doing all the way everything will be fine but if you ever get a revelation and you stand on the word of God that's when Satan notices what's going on he said so that's when you see why Satan is so against the Book of Revelation anything that's revealed spiritual Revelation Satan is against that's why he's so against the ministry today because what is it the revealing of Christ oh now let the church go on with his great denominations and organizations and its little flowery messages and so forth he said let them go on Satan won't bother that that's right they don't have no troubles he said right everybody Pats them on the back but when there comes a time that God through the Holy Ghost reveals Christ back in the church with power and demonstrations of Healing The Sick and making signs that he said would follow the Believers come to pass then Satan turns over in his bed right yeah so so Brothers said as long as the church goes along dead everything's gonna be all right Satan's not going to bother that but if you let somebody in the church get a revelation yeah you let somebody in the church get a victory you let somebody stand up and shout a little bit you let somebody get excited about something you let somebody be a revelation of what God did for them in this day you let somebody recognize who they are and where they're placed at in the kingdom of God you let somebody start praising or shouting oh yeah you let somebody preach the gospel and heal the sick and do the signs and wonders that God said would happen then Satan turns over brother Branham he does something about it he says until that time Satan don't care how much Church you join he don't care how much but when Christ reveals to you that he's the son of God and the works that he did you do also you know who the you is here come on now you yeah come on yeah when you and it works that he did you do also not some other works but the same Works he that believeth on me Saint John 14 7 he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also do the same works and greater than this because Christ could not preach the baptism of the Holy Ghost direct quote here Saints Christ could not preach the baptism of holy ghost that would be greater he could not bring it to them because the Holy Ghost hadn't been given yet but when Jesus came and sacrificed his life and the Holy Ghost returned then they that's you could impart eternal life to the people that's you Saints that's who you are can impart eternal life unto the people that's the greater he said but the signs and wonders Jesus plainly said in Mark 16 go you into all the world preach the gospel to Every Creature out the art all the world how many Every Creature long as the gospel is being preached these signs shall follow them that believe yeah and when that becomes the Revelation brother you're near the kingdom then that's called the revelation of Jesus Christ that's in 60 if you want to look that up when you recognize who you are in the kingdom of God when you recognize these signs shall follow them that believe when you recognize that your Greater Works than this shall you do yeah yeah so if we take a good firm stand on every word there then and we believe what the Bible says there's going to be trials yeah yeah but we don't let these trials Define who we are yeah yeah we don't let these trials make us better or leave a scar to the point to where where you get cold and indifference and brother Brandon says I'm getting old I know that and each day I get a new ache and pain surely somebody can testify to that each day I get a new ache in pain every one of us do you might as well tell the truth and I thought God now look here it just dawned on me Saints when I after I got over 40. you know when you're young you think there's always time when you when you're young you think you always got tomorrow but but when you when you start to get on up there and you get to a certain point you realize you only got so many more days to serve him you only got so much more time to give there's only so many more sermons you can preach brother Ben there's only so much more time that you got that you can give to the Lord there's only so many more days in your life that you can serve and he says one of the most miserable things is to see a man or a woman who has never accepted Christ and just lived an old moss-backed church member meaner than Satan himself and to see him out there with a crab at Old Something well I'll tell you I don't believe any God never he said well that's the horriblest crown that Satan can Crown a life with so he said at mossback church member was meaner than Satan himself now let's stop right here for just a moment one of the worst things that can happen to a human being is to get a religious spirit see many times people are looking for the Holy Spirit but they get a religious spirit instead and a lot of times brother Randolph said you're so vile we're so vile in our self that God has to give us a new spirit before he can ever touch us with his holy spirit and so God gives us a new spirit but many people confuse the new Spirits with the Holy Spirit but that's just a new spirit that's just God's got to get us to a place where he can give us the Holy Spirit but the new spirit is not the baptism of the Holy Ghost and all too often people go on and get a religious Spirits rather than getting the Holy Spirit and brother Brown says it was a religious spirit that crucified Jesus he said it's a religious people that crucifies it's the religious people that was against the true Christ it's the religious prophets that was against Micaiah and it's the religious people of the day that's against the message of God oh that's true and he says I'm not so much talking about Catholicism and Baptist and Methodist I'm talking about people that's Holiness people write down these lines here amen yeah and he goes on he says don't ever underestimate Satan's power for deceiving don't you ever underestimate it he's as smooth as he can be and he talks how he talks about how Jesus and Judas was in the same church he talks about Cain and Abel being Brothers he talks about Esau and Jacob being Brothers is that right yeah and he talks about how there's a lie that Satan told Eve was 90 the truth ninety percent the truth and he says and and he said in the lie that you can tell he says how I have heard men bypass scriptures just to keep from hurting their theology yes yes amen a religious spirit it will get on somebody and cause them to bypass scriptures to keep from hurting their theology right right it's good he said but see if that part's right then this part's right let's put it together and make it fit through the whole Bible [Music] amen yeah and how we've seen the same thing today in this message where men will bypass different quotes different messages different paragraphs because it doesn't fit their dots well since we don't line up the quotes that fit our Doctrine we line up our Doctrine to print the quotes yes sir and I don't want to be offended at anything he said I want to believe whatever is said I just want to thank him for what he said but I'm not going to bypass part of the message so that it doesn't offend somebody's Doctrine yeah come on I don't want to have to skip over a bunch of quotes to make it say something that it doesn't yeah right or wrong Saints that's a religious spirit that does that yes you know people can get a religious spirit on I don't want to be around somebody like that when they get this super ultra religious spirit about them I want to be around people that's the same way every time I see them all right I I don't want to be one way at church in a different way at work and a different way at home I want to be the same man all the time I don't want to look I don't want to be up here preaching the gospel and my kids sitting in the Pew saying why won't you listen to that I wouldn't be the same man I don't want to be a different person and I don't want to get around somebody and get a a a Ultra religious spirit on me hey man where you you talk you talk to people and they get so sanctimonious and I want people to be real people be who they are oh my so we find then brother Brown says this now watch this brothers and sisters he says and I know someday I Gotta Die and he says I hope that God never lets Satan Crown me as an old crowded and different man and my wife an old nagging woman or your wife or you that way I pray brother that our lives will be crowned with the fruits of the spirit love and joy and long-suffering gentleness patience truth faith in the Holy Ghost so brother Brown talks about two different kinds of crowns here yeah yes there's the crowning of Satan that he would put on a man yeah that he would put on a woman and then there's the crowning of the Holy Spirit and we got a choice today of which Crown we choose Saints do we want to be crowned a crab it old and different religious Spirits or we want to be crowned with the Holy Spirit yeah come on that's our choice if you let Satan Crown you this is what you get you'll get complexes we talked about that this morning I'm not going back into complexes but we do know that the prophet dealt with complexes we know we deal with complexes and sometimes we don't deal with our own complex sometimes it's complexes that are passed down from generation to generation and if I if we find out it's also very easy for us to build our own complexes that's a crowning on our life of the devil that's right yes another crowning that he gives us is anxiety anxiety currently 31 this is pre-coved numbers 31 percent United States deal with anxiety symptoms pre-covet I'll tell you what it didn't get no better than Kobe now we find it's caused by pressure built up on the people and the prophet said it's just a built up pressure in this age that we're living he talked about people going down the road 90 miles an hour so they could stop and drink two hours before they got home it's just a pressure and you can feel the pressure when you go to Walmart you can feel the pressure when you're out in the grocery store you can feel pretty at work you feel the pressure in our homes we feel the pressure it's a pressure on the people today when you when you watch the news you can feel the pressure from that uh amen but also Saints you need to recognize anxiety that's a modern day problem now years ago people would get upset they would have stress and they would have tough times and and those type things but you never saw the anxiety that we see today it's it's everywhere today everywhere all the people it's a pressure on the people and and it's come along and it's increasing in numbers and more and more people are dealing with anxiety today no doubt there's people in this church tonight that deal with anxiety in their lives yeah that's true now I'll tell you something since you saw a big increase of it along about the time that this thing showed up come on breach oh you're meddling now preacher how long about the time since this thing here has become our God I'm on preach anything that we put ahead of the Lord becomes an idol to us is that right Saints anything that we put ahead of the Lord now I I was reading doing some research the other day and you know you find if people leave home and and they're coming to church and uh and they left their Bible at home they'd say well it's all right I'm just going to church and they come on but if they left home and they realized they left this thing yeah they'll be late for church because they're gonna turn around go back and get it right or wrong says this thing is it's just gotten a hold of everybody you know I travel a lot and I I watch people in the airports and so forth nobody talks to anybody anymore it's if you look across the airport almost a hundred percent of the people are staring at their phone [Music] right or wrong since and it ain't just kids either it's not just young people it's young people it's it's middle-aged people it's open it's everybody it's everywhere now there was a study done a University study and I'm gonna read this to you it says increasing evidence suggests that the negative effects of smartphone use might also extend into the realm of Mental Health problematic smartphone use compulsive or excessive could worsen symptoms of anxiety and depression huh research has found that some individuals experience intense anxiety when separated from their phones intense anxiety when separated from it y'all go ahead and get quiet anxiety symptoms been separated from and some even exhibit withdrawal-like symptoms like you're coming off a drug withdrawal-like symptoms if they can't check their device given these findings it's possible that certain forms of smartphone use could cause or worsen symptoms of mental illness the researchers found that smartphone use was in fact associated with symptoms of anxiety and depression as well as increased experience of stress the more participants use their smartphones the more likely they were to experience symptoms associated with these disorders and Report being stressed now brother George is not up here preaching to get rid of your smartphone tonight but I would ask everyone to examine your life examine how you're using it yes examine what it's doing to you yeah yeah is it a look I can take this phone and I can read my Bible on it I can take this phone and I can listen to the message of the hour on it I can take this phone in Tucson Arizona and I can find out what brother Ben's preaching on in Hardy Arkansas yes but I can also open up a world of Filth oh that's right I can let it consume my time yeah yeah I can let it take away from my family where my children are around I can let it preoccupy me so that I don't spend the time investing in my children I can let it take my attention away from other pressing matters I can I can disappear into a hole and not deal with the things that's right in front of me amen I'll tell you Saints think about the feeling you get when your phone is in your pocket and it's on vibrate and it goes off and you can't check it yeah that's true come on now it's happened to some of y'all in church here tonight some of y'all checked your phones tonight while you've been in church I know you have yes it's almost consuming oh I got a text or something somebody called me I wonder who it was yeah you know that the phones have been designed since a lot of people don't know this your phone if you don't pick it up and check it every so often will notify you of something yeah to make you pick it up it don't like to it's like it's just like a child it wants your attention that's true you set it down for a while and see if you don't start getting notifications on it it's designed that way and I'll tell you that will kill your prayer life if you're trying to pray with the phone in the same room Give It Up because if that if you're in prayer and that phone vibrates you can't think about the prayer anymore yeah and that's God's time Saints that's God's time that you're doing there you're taken away from God's time leave it in another room or something thanks this is right around and I say that I know this ain't shouting material but it causing anxiety amongst the people yeah it's anxiety when when you when you can't check it like you want to it's anxiety yeah then when you can check it the things that you see are getting us worked up yeah yeah if you're looking at the news look I can tell you don't have to look at the news I'll tell you it's all bad yes but now here's some good news right here but if you're looking at CNN or you're looking at Fox News or you're looking at it's all bad and then we're getting ourselves worked up but we're getting ourselves stressed out worried about what's happening Saints yeah other smartphone symptoms include poor cognitive ability and sleep it actually impacts your sleep quality thank you inability to communicate in face-to-face interactions now Saints I have seen people be in the same room and instead of talking to one another they'll text each other in the same room decrease productivity anxiety driven by social media and then also obviously accidents on the road now this social media aspect is another can of worms that kind of goes along with that but we find in many times that people uh watching social media now again I'm not saying brother George is saying not to have smartphones he's not saying not to have social media I'm saying question what it's doing to you yeah yeah and if it's more of a hindrance that it is a help maybe you need to back off a little bit but people tie their self-worth to how many likes they get on social media yeah come on people look at social media and they compare their life to it many times and those things aren't real yeah nobody's trusting their real life on social media right amen it's one of the crownings of the devil says it's it's it's it's anxiety it's it's depression it's all these things that the devil is trying to Crown on its complexes all of that it's all tied in together and you find 21 million diagnosed cases cases of depression in the U.S each year pre-covet numbers it didn't get any better during covet you find the devil will Crown you with anxiety he'll Crown you with complexes he'll Crown you with depression he'll Crown you with hard feelings sure let me give you another word for it it's called The Root of bitterness yeah the devil will Crown your life with hard feelings and it'll choke the Holy Spirit out of your life feelings will build up towards other people towards people in our family towards people in our church towards people we don't even know in some cases and it'll build up and Trump the Holy Spirit out of a lie he'll Crown you with emotional scars he'll cram you with temper now brother Brown said temper causes cancer he'll Crown you with worry brother Brown said worry also causes cancer worry also causes Amnesia he said yeah now Amnesia is what happens when a person forgets who they are yeah and when you spend your time a brother said something to me about that earlier when you spend your time worrying you're not focused on who you are you're a child of God tonight all things work together for your good what are you worried about level if it ain't going good praise the lord it's working for your goods if it's a tough time it's working for your good if it's hard it's working for your good all things work for your goods you know the the hardest trials I've ever had in my life or what put me right here tonight I wouldn't be here without them yeah without the trials I've been through I wouldn't be here tonight right God used those trials to push me and place me and take me where he wanted me right is that right thanks God uses trials for you I mean so when you're going through the trials praise the Lord it's working for your goods yes so look God's Prophet had to deal with these things we have to deal with these things Hey Brother Brown talks about one of the most horrible things was to see a man or woman constantly complaining he said he said I've always thought God keep me from it it weakens Faith all the time when we complain it weakens our faith all the time and he said you know as I get older each one of us we're going to get something happen and something happened and I know these little things are going to keep accumulating yeah yeah these trials yeah yeah these Stars as we get older they keep accumulating yes they keep building up and build up and build up and he says but I just think one of the most horrible things is for Satan to Crown someone's life a cram at old man or a woman you see I hope that thou don't get to that place I hope that I can bear it my burdens and get to a spot to where I want my life crowned with the glory of God his long suffering yes gentleness peace meekness and filled with the Holy Spirit yes and he talks about how one of the main things that's always bothered him was a nervous condition and he said he got real weary and he feel like nobody cared for him uh he said none of that is true yeah yeah all of us have got to a place to where we think nobody cares about us nobody cares for me everybody's nobody nobody loves me he said none of that is true right right rest assured denied those Saints God does not want you dealing with these things yeah God doesn't want you dealing with anxiety right he doesn't want you dealing with depression he doesn't want you dealing with complexes he doesn't want you dealing with the root of bitterness in your life God doesn't want that for us y'all believe that's not Saints say brother Brown said God don't want you to be frowning God wants you to be happy the human heart was made to be happy worry will cause cancer temper will cause cancer don't ever be upset he said just walk in his love knowing that you're walking in him and nothing can harm you yeah thank you Lord anxiety is not God's will for you depression is not God's will for you right right complexes are not God's will for you hard feelings are not God's will for you amen the root of bitterness is not God's will for you God's will is for you to be happy is that what he said Thank You Lord amen and the only way we can be happy tonight the only way we can live this life is by the Holy Spirit living through us oh yes now brother Brown talked about those Gentiles or not brother brand of the Romans the second chapter talks about those Gentiles Paul talking about it that that that we're living a law without living the law yeah yeah they were Gentiles and they had a set of laws that they had to obey uh the the Jewish people did but the Gentiles weren't under those laws but their nature by their nature they were just living that law right yeah why because it was on the inside is that right thanks It Was Written in their hearts Paul said yeah he said their conscience was bearing witness their thoughts that the meanwhile accusing or else excusing one another he said he said for when the Gentiles which have not the law do by Nature the things contained in the law they're just nature is that right Saints now the Bible says that when the spirit of Truth has come he'll guide you in all truth so don't tell me you got the Holy Spirit and living a filthy life because the Holy Spirit won't leave somebody to live a filthy life don't say you got the holy spirit because you because you listen to a tape yeah don't say you got the holy spirit because you believe the message all right across a bunch of Baptists that said they believed but they didn't have the Holy Spirit they didn't even know what he was talking about he said oh I believe the message I got it no no they asked brother Branham that come on he said they said brother Brown do our grandchildren hurt our children do they he said do they have to have the Holy Spirit or if they just believe the message of the hour is that enough said they got to come the same way you did people say oh I believe the message will believe in the message and receiving the Holy Ghost is two different things amen now people that have the Holy Ghost make mistakes people that had Holy Ghost are perfect but what the Holy Ghost does is put a desire in a Believer to feed on the things of God and if you have a desire the more desire you have defeat on the things of God the more Godly you will become yes oh yes now the prophet clearly explained this he said the new birth is a mystery to the people they can't understand it they don't know what they mean but they have they belittled it to bring it down they said well just because you believe something he said the Devils believe the same thing and tremble yeah it isn't what you believe it's what God has actually done yeah amen yeah yeah Saints the holy spirit is the answer the Holy Ghost is the answer to complexes the Holy Ghost is the answer to anxiety the Holy Ghost is the answer to depression the Holy Ghost is the answer to the root of bitterness thank you Lord it takes the Holy Spirit to sweeten our life yes amen now you can have the Holy Spirits and still have these things crop up in your life that's why we got to have baptism after baptism of the Holy Spirit yes that's why we got to have a re-baptism of the Holy Spirit a re-filling of the Holy Spirit you can't stop Saints you can't get it once and be done because these things continue to accumulate yes so it's a it's a daily process I Die daily a daily process of dying out to the things of the world dying out to sin dying out to complexes on a daily process of filling back up yeah with the things of God amen so we got to choose this morning we got to choose to choose peace and love and joy and Temperance and meekness and brotherly kindness Saints the holy spirit is what sets the church in order the holy spirit gives gifts in the church the holy spirit gives officers in the church it gives positions in the church it gives talents in the church it gives Ministries in the church you Lord and the Holy Spirit will make the word of God manifest too yes yes so we got to choose a crown this morning we want to be crowned with a cold formal crowded religious Spirits or do we want to be crowned with the sweetness and the virtues of the Holy Spirit we got that choice we even have a choice of what we think about we have a choice of what we think about true the Bible said Brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report if they're being adverts you if there be any praise think on these things so the Bible said we can choose to think on these things now you can't stop negative thoughts from coming but you can stop them from staying yes you can't stop something bad from coming across your mind but when it does you can recognize it and say I choose to think on the things that are right to think on the things that are lovely to think on the things that are honest to think on the things that are just to think on the
