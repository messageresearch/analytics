we can worship you it's just something about coming together with those who like precious faith who lord have fought many battles and maybe fallen many times but you lift us up lord to be what we could not be without you lord and to worship in a way that we could not worship without you we're so thankful for that today blessed be your name we pray lord that you would touch each and every heart tonight we don't want to take this service for granted that we know something we have to do we're commanded to do but lord we want to do it with all of our heart and i believe you can speak to us tonight through your word i pray you would do that tonight lord i don't know how it'll be but lord we we need you to speak to us how can we make it through life you just made that so real to my own heart this morning how can i make it lord through life unless i hear from you unless you speak to me lord father i pray you would speak today may there be no idol in the way or may every imagination be cast down and lord and we have a clear channel to speak to you and it father we thank you for what you've done for us today and continue to do in jesus name amen amen do you love him this evening amen isn't it good to be in the house of the lord amen david said i was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the lord and i know you've filled up with natural food but it's time to have some spiritual food and fellowship tonight and thank the lord for each one of you that could make it look good to see david back there and the shame was with us and every one of you you regular folk bless my heart coming to church really does mean something to be in the house of god when so many forsake the assembling of themselves together today but it means something to be in the house of the lord amen jeremiah chapter 7 and verse 16. and this is the scripture that brother branham used in christianity versus idolatry in fact he read this portion twice he said therefore pray not thou for this people god didn't mess with idolaters he said pray not thou for this people it reminds me of what brother branham said about this country that i don't pray for it anymore pray not thou for this people neither lift up cry nor prayer for them neither make intercession to me for i will not hear thee see us thou not what they do in the cities of judah and in the streets of jerusalem the children gather wood and the fathers kindle the fire and the women need their dough to make cakes to the queen of heaven to pour out drink offerings unto other gods that they may provoke me to anger my it was a serious thing idolater idolatry is a serious thing and it is yet today i pray the lord without his blessing to the word you may be seated but stuart i saw you slip into tonight and i was this was your service so just blaming on brother stewart if it doesn't go well we appreciate brother stewart i appreciate you coming back buddy this afternoon i know that's quite a drive where he was preaching away as we said this morning the term imagination comes from the latin verb imaginary it means to picture oneself to make an image and that's what idolatry is it's not that imagination itself is wrong but when we exalt imagination over the word it's wrong and it doesn't matter what the imagination is if it's not the word it's not right and that's what makes it so hard for people because we tend to love to tear down other people's idols it's one thing to tear down other people's idols but it's the idols in our own heart in our own imagination the things that we hold to but howard that are not right those are the things that are hardest to tear down huh it's hard because it's good to see it too tonight brother howard i didn't mean to single brother david out not you but but that's it's hard to we hold these things as as something that we should hold on to and not realizing that it's tearing us it's keeping us from god even we may have got it from our father i think of of the man in the bible who was told gideon who was told to go tear down the idols in his father's house and sometimes that has to be done it's the imagination that creates itself an image i'm just going to preach to you for a few minutes tonight so just listen quickly but it's the imagination of self that creates an image of what i want god to be but god is who he says he was and that should not be just a bad thing but it should be a comfort to us because if he's not who he says he is how can we trust him to be a healer how can we trust him to be a savior how can we trust him to be a deliverer but he is who he says he is in the word and because he reveals himself to us in the word brother sam we can have hope we can have confidence that he is god and he's the same yesterday today and forever i want to identify tonight some idols of imagination that folks have made and these are just ones i've seen you know when paul walks over in mars hill and he begins to look around he sees idols to jupiter and and idols to apollo and all the different idols he says you're too superstitious and it's not that you're trying to treat people badly but it's just you see idols and and they shouldn't be there and these are things that we all struggle with i think at some on some level the things we see today in 2020 one i think it is in 2021 things that we see i see idols of yesterday people make a god out of history or a god that only does things in history this happens too with people who've maybe been exposed to something that's very bad and very wrong and they make that something that controls their life maybe it's something that you did yourself and you just can't ever get away from that you've got to let history be history because as we said this morning he didn't reveal himself as the great i was he revealed himself as the great i am so they imagine that god has stopped being what he always was i've always been struck by the story and you can find it in the book of haggai i believe where here is jerubal he's built the temple and all these wonderful things that have come and the people have worshiped again in the land but it says that the old men cried when they saw the temple that had been built because there was nothing in their eyes compared to what it used to be because they could remember what it was in solomon's day but the prophet tells them he says don't despise the day of small things because god's doing something today he has to be because that's the kind of god he is he doesn't just do things yesterday he's doing something today and what is god doing today whatever that is i want to be a part of that i want to find out what god's will is and say lord whatever you're doing today let me be right there in the middle of your will amen i appreciate what you did yesterday like blind bartimaeus consent could sit there by the wall and he could remember what god did yesterday he could remember that there was a man who stood there by that same wall one day and it was a it was the angel of the covenant stood there with a drawn sword he would recognize the history of the place but he also believed that the same angel of the covenant if he stood there once by the wall of jericho he could stand there again and if he could deliver jericho and the walls would be walls could be shaken down and and rahab and her family could come out if he could do that then he can do that today do you believe that he's still the same yesterday today and forever amen i didn't eat too much so we're okay [Laughter] see they imagine that god stopped being what he always was i don't i don't need a god that isn't what he was i need a god who's the same as jesus christ hebrews 13 8 the same yesterday today and forever malachi 3 and 6 says for i am the lord i change not and because of this fact therefore because i am the lord and i change not you sons of jacob are not consumed amen see an idol you can make it into whatever you want it to be you can take that wood if you carved it you made it you can also change it if you made it out of uh the calf out of the gold or whatever you you can change it into something else it was an earring and then it become a calf but that's not you know it's one denomination it becomes another but my god never changes and he said because i changed not therefore you sons of jacob are not consumed because i don't change not only in a way that i keep my word but i keep my word for you amen he chose you and he doesn't change that choosing i want to look at a specific area we'll move right along to another one here this afternoon and it's by no means we don't have time to go through everything but just to kind of give us an idea what these idols might be an idol of yesterday god is not the same he doesn't brother branham would preach about it that how that in that day they would say the days of miracles are past and today people think that god doesn't work in the church the way he always did but that's not what god said this is what a prophet of god told us he said he said some in the church teachers apostles prophets gifts of healing working of miracles all those things are set in the church now if i set something in the church and i put it there and i don't take it out and it's not there what happened to it somebody else took it out right there's some elementary doctrine for you if i put it in the church and it's not there anymore somebody else took it out if god said it in the church and he didn't take it out who made that idol who crafted it who made it god don't do that anymore you better be careful of that huh said do you believe that he said i never did say where he said i never did say where they'd be set out of the church then who said it it wasn't a prophet of god he set them in the church for the perfecting of the church and to be in the church until he comes again that just ought to be enough for us we just believe the word all right but because people have worshiped a god of yesterday they can't see that he still has preachers he still has teachers he still has evangelists he still has gifts because that's the part and parcel of it you understand it all has to come together now he said they say oh he's still got teachers and evangelists and pastors he said but what about prophets and so forth now let me let me back up i missed that one he said now the bible said that god set in the church apostles prophets teachers evangelists and pastors he never did say where he set out of the church he never said it where he set out of the church apostles and prophets now remember in that day they were teaching a doctrine that there was no such thing as apostles and prophets anymore but they had pastors evangelists and teachers right and so brother branham says okay if you say there's pastors evangelists and teachers but there's no apostles and prophets number one if you have the authority to say there's pastors evangelists and teachers and then you have to also say there's apostles and prophets you can't take this part of it right because if you're if there's no apostles and prophets there's no pastors evangelists and teachers right he never said it out of the church and so he says they say oh he's still got teachers and evangelists and pastors what about prophets and so forth it's still just the same god doesn't change it all goes together right they say oh he's still got um he said god doesn't change i'm the future home of the heavenly bridegroom excuse me i'm a little nervous i know i'm in a hurry but i just want to get this to you this evening i'm thankful that many of you came back this afternoon because i want you to understand this you won't understand what i said this morning unless you understand this now he said in malachi 3 i am god and i change not the way he does it therefore if he's saved listen if he the first man he ever saved by the shed blood of an innocent one he'll have to save the next one and everyone he saves will have to be the same way amen he said if you healed a man at any time through the journey of life if he healed a man at any time through the journey of life let it be in the days of jesus the apostles the prophets whenever it was when the same conditions is met he's got to do it again see if you just believe in a god and god that changes or god that stops or god of yesterday then you're saying that god may not do it for me but if you believe in a god it's the same yesterday today and forever then if he did it for them and i meet those same conditions he will do it for me if god provided isaac with a wife if you're single need a wife god will provide a wife for you if god provided uh if god provided healing for bartimaeus's eyes if you're blind and you need sight then god will do it for you if you meet the same conditions whatever god did he still does we can't even look at the message of the hour and see all the people that were healed and all the wonderful miracles if he ever did it he still doesn't we just have to meet the same conditions now brother brown says now the first stage that he brings to us he said his plan of redemption is exactly exactly the same i think we already went through that i'm sorry i'm i'm nervous about the time and i'm taking more time because of it listen he says he don't change man changes time changes age changes dispensation changes but god remains the same he is perfect amen what a hope he said that ought to give the sick people if he ever healed a sick person if he ever healed a person he has to do it again when the same conditions is met if he ever saved a man he's got to do it on the same grounds he did it the first time if he ever filled a man with the holy ghost has he ever filled a man with the holy ghost he filled me then if he's ever filled a man with the holy ghost he is going he's got to do it again if if he comes on the same grounds if ever if he ever raised a man up from the grave he's got to do it the second time and every other time on the same principle hallelujah he doesn't change he said oh what i hope that gives me what is it not in some man-made theory something that groups of men have come together but his unchangeable word i'll read this one more and we'll go on to the next one he said now god is set in the church god not the organization of the achievement of man to make bishops and so forth presbyters he didn't say he'd have presbyters and bishops but god is set in the church first apostles that's missionaries secondarily prophets teachers pastors evangelists god set them in the church and every bugle will blow the same gospel another idol that i see today is the idol of cheap grace just hang with me for a moment i don't want to be harsh but it's an imagination today that people believe that god will not judge their actions by the word that somehow because jesus died for the sins of the world that i don't have to answer for my sins and i just get off scot-free and i can do what i want that's not what god did for us he didn't take those beatings so that you could just go on being who you were he shed that blood just so we could just continue in sin it prospers shall we continue in sin that grace may abound god forbid he didn't do that so we could just continue being who we are but he did it so that we could be changed we could be healed we could be whole amen it's not a god of cheap grace but the manifestation of god that people have created in their minds the idol that they've created as a god that just lets them do whatever they want to do the bible says love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him that's pretty strict didn't it but it's true for all of us god said be born again i remember some years ago being born again means to change when you were born the first time you changed you changed and then you grew being born again is not about just being born by the way you grow brother branham deals with that and you must be born again he talks about that it's not just an isolated event but it's something that as you go through life you grow you grow you grow you fed the word of god you keep growing you don't stay a baby and so as you grow when you when god said be born again he said he meant born again that's me but that don't mean you stay the same there's got to be a marked difference and i know we struggle with that especially as young people in the message i grew up in the message and growing up it's hard to tell what that difference is but there's got to be a difference in what you were and what you are when you're born again there's something that changes he said you don't mean a handshake or repeat of creed he said but everybody is scared of that new birth i'll use brother jt for example because and i've used it before but i remember years ago with steve and and his son was helping me move his stepson was helping me move he said you know he said dad he said dad always he said he said when he got saved i was talking to him about not coming to church and encouraging him to come back he said when dad got saved he changed well there's simple enough for you he said i don't want to be a hypocrite and i told him i said on some level we're all hypocrites in that in that sense because you can always talk yourself out of being saved right you're always going to do something that people are going to say is not right but he said i remember he was old enough to remember when he said when dad got saved he changed see he didn't drink no more he didn't carry on in lord like he used to he was a different man the day he got saved that's the kind of new birth we believe in god still does that if he ever did that he still does that when god said born again he meant born again he don't mean a handshake repeat of a creed he said everybody is scared of that new birth scared of that new birth but when god says born again he means born again the devil substituted a handshake for it or some kind of a psychic affair that would make you acknowledge yes i'm born again but your life tells what you are the life that's in you another place brother brandon said jesus said all the fathers give me will come to me no man can come except my father draws him all that comes to me i'll give him eternal life raise him up at the last day there's none of them lost he said i lose nothing because no man can pluck them out of my father's hand who gave them to me he said oh my look what this experience of a new birth this is what god wants it's not a cheap grace it's not an idol of a cheap grace but the god of the bible reveals himself as a god that doesn't lose what he saves do you believe that today the god who doesn't lose what he saves and he don't just let him do whatever they want to do but what does he do he changes the want to amen he said he that heareth my words and believeth on him this time he has eternal life and shall never come to the judgment but it's passed from death into life he said that's why this church believes in the security of the perseverance of the saints he said not in the baptist form not in the presbyterian form but in the bible form amen not according to a baptist imagination or a presbyterian imagination but in the bible form you say now brother branham i guess once in grace always in grace that brings a lot of dis inner woman listen to this has been born of the spirit of god old things have passed away all things have become new amen and he's been birthed and blessed by the eternal god they can no more perish than god himself can perish that's why i'm able to take communion not because i'm perfect but i change from death and to life hallelujah you have two if you've been born again but it's a god of cheap grace that doesn't change anybody that's it's an idol of imagination we have today this is the last one i'll deal with this evening but we have an idol of personal preference where we imagine whatever our personal preference is to be god's word or to be just as good as god's word and you see that in an extreme example with you know i'm made to be a man or a woman and then they just change it my personal preference god made you a man or woman he didn't make you to have a decision on that you understand and and we don't get to just change it but people bow at the idol of personal preference i can be what i want to be but that don't just that's not just in the world think about that in a spiritual sense god's word is true whether i like it or not we could come back down a little farther and say god's word is true whether i can live it or not it's not up to me anyway it's up to him but but the word is true now all of us have opinions that like noses everybody's got one all of us have preferences we all have prejudices now see here you thought i was going to name somebody tonight i told you i was going to be specific but when we really get to looking at these idols you know who they look like us that's the imagination we imagine we're okay oh god help us today but we're only okay if the word says we're okay we're not saved by feeling we're saved by the word of god we're born again by the word of god everybody has an opinion but that opinion becomes an idol when it begins to separate you from fellowship from believers when you worship that opinion so much that it will keep you from doing things you know god said to do you know he said to do it but you don't do it because well i got my feelings hurt huh that you made your feelings an idol over the word of god somebody will come with some doctrine or some opinion of man and i just talking to you tonight and then we'll go to communion but they'll come with something and some man will come out and say i believe you should have church 12 times on sunday bless god thus saith the lord you should have church 12 times on sunday well god bless you the word doesn't say that you say well bless god i believe that i believe that you've got to preach exactly 45 minutes you've got to do this that or the other and maybe they've got something they'll draw it from god's word doesn't say it are you with me now you know if you get to study and look and you realize most of those things are just personal preferences and people break fellowship over it and they separate from believers and they snipe at each other from church to church and place to place god didn't call us to do that we should all be able to take communion in essence together we're we're part of the body of christ not not just this church or some other church because i have a preference how i like to do things yeah there's things that i'd like to do and there's things that i have a preference you realize as a pastor i got to lay down my preferences all the time for the good of the church you know that if you're married you've got to lay down your personal preferences all the time there's things you'd rather be doing huh most of us men would hardly ever want to go shopping but she wants to go shopping so you lay down your preferences but if it becomes an idol it separates you from other believers what did they do you go back and look at it go back to judges chapter 17 find out when there's a man named micah who set up an idol in his house and then he has a priest who he pays ten shekels and a shirt go back and look it up he pays him 10 shekels in his shirt to tell him what he wants to hear and the bible said the priest was happy to get his ten shekels in a shirt because in that day everybody did what they thought was right in their own eyes so they he then set up an idol in his own house and they began to worship and they had these things and god and there was a blessing there in that house and some other people found out about it and they come and paid the priests more to come in their their camp and the very first thing that they did of course he was glad to go with them had a bigger congregation paid more and so he went with them and then after he went with them you'll find out in the next chapter the first thing they did was find an innocent city and destroy it the very first thing they did was try to destroy another church why i don't even know why this isn't in my notes i don't even know why i'm going here because it's an idol that a man has set up and made this to be truth and you find out it's not in the bible it's not don't come from the message of the hour oh they may twist some things around try to make it look but you can't it can't be supported by that so they support it by earnestness or by the fact well it it makes me feel good it works denomination works brother brandon told us that in the church age book it works it's not a good defense because the bride sometimes don't look like it works but god's word always works amen didn't look like israel had the best system of governance but god said it's mine that's the way i want it amen hey man he's still with me tonight we find out in mark chapter seven we'll read this and we'll get ready for communion mark chapter seven verse five there's a group called the pharisees and scribes and they asked jesus why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders eat bread with unwashing hands why did they not do our traditions you know the pharisees were better off to wash their hands it's always good to wash your hands but it's not the word right i'd rather go to the church that washed your hands and didn't right much rather but it's not in the word right it's not a commandment and so the disciples just grabbed corn and ate it didn't wash their hands and and he answered and said to them you know it's just a question but there's something about it he knows the secret of the heart he knows why you asked the question and jesus come on really strong he answered and said to them well is that well isaiah prophesied of you hypocrites and since written this people honoreth me with their lips but their heart is far from me i'll be it in vain do they worship me teaching for doctrines the commandments of men idol worship idolatry in the form of religion but they made it out of the message they made it out of moses message so it must be true but that's where exactly where it is it's out of the message because it's not even what moses said now look he said for laying aside the commandment of god you hold the tradition of men it's the washing of pots and cups and many other such like things you do he said unto them full well you reject the commandment of god that you may keep your own tradition and they'll fight you over their tradition something you can't back up on the word at all but a man will separate from fellowship fight people over it have a bitter spirit about it and it's a tradition something that doesn't matter be good to wash your hands but it's a tradition when it comes to the word for moses said he gives them an example he said moses said honor your father and your mother who so curses father mother let him die of the death but you say if a man shall say to his father and mother it is corbyn let us say a gift so in other words it's dedicated to god and so they say we it's a gift by whatsoever that might just be prophetess by me he should be free so what they would do is say mom and dad i'm tired of taking care of you i think a brother uh that's there tonight with his mother and and brother robert smith and i know it's hard sometimes to take care of your parents it's hard to care for your parents but we have responsibilities and here he would say it's a gift he said whatever you you want of mine i'll give it to you but then we're done huh what whatsoever thou might just be prophetess by me you can you can have the car you can have the house i'll buy you a house but no more and he said what they would do is you suffer him no more to do ought for his father his mother he's done that's it that's all he has to do he said you made the word of god of none effect through your tradition because the the purpose of moses saying on your father and mother was not so you could set them up financially and then leave them it was all through life god forbid that we would take this glorious message that we have and reduce it down to a set of traditions if you don't like it the way if you don't like how we do it then we just won't have no fellowship with you at all unless you do this and hear this preacher or follow this man or or have your service in a certain way you aren't in the message it doesn't come from the word does it come from the word you see god wants you for an image god don't want you to make an idol he wants you he wants me you're god's letter a written epistle god is in you manifesting himself through he don't want all your all your stuff but he said heaven is my throne earth is my footstool what house will you build me saith the lord what is the place on my wrist brother branham says you're god's letter he said if you can prostrate yourself before god and say god i'm a sinner come into me and then the holy spirit comes in and then you're a living idol of god a living representative of god walking around with god speaking through your lips to others that's what god wants paul speaks to the thessalonians he said for from you sounded out word of the lord not only in macedonia nakaya but also in every place your faith to god were to spread abroad so that we need not to speak anything he said we don't even have to tell the people about the gospel he said for they themselves show of us what manner of entering in we had unto you how you turn to god from idols to serve the living and true god it ought to be the testimony of your life you become the idol you become the image not an image you made but an image you live out how can you do that prostrate yourself before god not an idol but before god you lay before god you say god whatever you want to speak i want you to speak it whatever you have for me whatever part of the word i don't want tradition lord help me not to let this spirit of tradition come on me to the point where i dis-fellowship somebody because they don't do it my way we could talk about idols all over the place but i think this one hits close to home i know it does for me god help me that i can stay true to the word if god if god says it let me say it and then i know if i get in trouble he'll back me up on it i can take such a sure stand on god's word that if they say i'm going to throw you in the fire i'll say whatever you do god is able to deliver me but if he doesn't i'm not going to bow to your image i can take that strong stand on the word why because it is the word i can't take those stands on my own thoughts what i've imagined to be true would you bow your heads with me brothers if you come and prepare for communion if i could have a piano and organ player let's just talk to the lord for a minute i i know it's been cut up and i was nervous i don't like to make drag out these communion services i don't want to sound harsh ever god help me if i do that but we got to reach a point where we're just surrendered to the word i don't i do what i do because i know god said do it and i love to do what god says it just means so much to me to make him happy to please him i know it would please him some people don't get baptized because they got some hang up or something but if it would please him for me to go under the water be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ i'll do it lord if that's what you said if that's what'll make you happy if that's according to your word i'll do it if you can show me in the word i'm willing to be shown in the word if you can show me in the word where something that i preach something that i believe something i've taught is wrong show it to me i want to know i really do church i want to know if it's right we examine ourselves by the word not by what we think not by what we imagine not by our feelings whether we get our feelings hurt or not we don't go by that examine yourself by the word tonight lord you want me to take communion i'll do it lord may not make much sense to me but i'll do it you want me to wash someone's feet you said do it lord the church world don't do it today we still do why because god said you'll be happy if you do this we're bound to the word love slaves to god's word let's just examine ourselves for a moment and speak to the author of the word the word himself and just ask him to come and make any idol that we've set up anything that we've started to give more prominence than we give to the word let it be torn down in our lives heavenly father lord jesus we ask you to come and we thank you for the presence lord your presence that we feel here in this place i pray god as we examine ourselves tonight or it's we know we don't smoke and drink and steal and lie and run around with women we know better than that so many times just in the actions and the attitudes of our lives we make everything else so important we put all the importance on somebody's manner of doing things or we put all the importance on whether somebody give us a phone call or not i do it too lord i'm human but oh god help us to step past that tonight help me to step past the hurt help me to step past whatever i've gone through in my lord life realize i'm i want to live your word i want to do what your word says regardless if i feel like it or not oh god help us tonight we want to be completely loved slaves to the word lord we pray that whatever we do father is a pastor i know it's possible for me to do something that would be outside of the word or lead the people in the way that would be slanted somehow differently from the word i pray you would never allow it lord i pray you would hold me to your word i want to be so careful lord that when the time comes even if it looked right if it wasn't the word i wouldn't go for it lord i pray for each one of us so it's not just a preacher every one of us lord we've got to be committed to the word of god god says do it i'm going to do it no matter what the world says sure would be laughed that made fun of the idolaters of the ancient times laughed at your people israel but they had a pillar of fire they had a brass serpent they had healing in the camp the shadow of the king was there it'd be so with us lord may we recognize what we have i prayed granted lord help us to cast down every idol everything every high thing that would exalt itself against you lord speak to us tonight by your word [Music] speak to us lord even as we're taking communion may it be just a time renewal in our lives something that just just rejuvenates us father and brings us closer to you we pray in jesus name amen let's sing this together oh how he loves you and me thank you lord singing he loves you and me oh he gave his life what more could he give oh loves you and me let's read first corinthians chapter 11 and verse 23 for i have received of the lord that which also i delivered unto you and the lord jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this is due in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had stopped saying this cup is the new testament in my blood this do ye as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the lord let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily he hath the drink of damnation to himself not discerning the lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged when we are judged we are chastened of the lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat tarry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together into condemnation and the rest will i set an order when i come lord jesus i hold in my hands the bread father which represents your broken body i pray god that you would bless it lord and as this church lord partakes of the bread i pray god that in the spiritual realm that you'd cause us to come that much more closely together you were broken so that we could be whole and we thank you for that in jesus name amen lord jesus for the wine i pray lord that you would come and that you would take us lord as the elements pass through our bodies lord we know there's nothing in the element itself but in the act of taking in this act of obedience to your word lord and we know that there's healing lord as the elements pass through the body may there be a healing take place if there's one sick person here today that there would not be one when we leave i pray that you would grant it today we believe your word lord and we do it according to your word in jesus name amen amen god bless you the brother will direct you should come if you could play
