[43:08] 17 and there's I've got a several couple
[43:11] scriptures here to read so I'll try to
[43:13] get right through it here tonight Mark
[43:15] chapter 9:17 says and one of the
[43:17] multitude answered and said master I
[43:20] have brought unto thee my son which hath
[43:21] a dumb spirit and wheresoever he taketh
[43:25] him he teth him him and he foth and
[43:27] naseth with his teeth and pineth away
[43:30] and I spake to the disciples that they
[43:32] should cast him out and they could not
[43:35] he answered him and said oh faithless
[43:37] generation how long shall shall I be
[43:39] with you how long shall I suffer you
[43:42] bring him unto me and they brought him
[43:44] brought unto him brought him unto him
[43:46] and when he saw him straight way the
[43:48] spirit tear him and he fell on the
[43:50] ground and wallowed foaming and he asked
[43:53] his father how long is it a go since
[43:56] this came unto him and he said of a
[43:57] child and often times it casteth him
[44:00] into the fire and into the waters to
[44:02] destroy him but if thou can do anything
[44:05] have compassion on us and help us that's
[44:07] the way we have to come to Jesus isn't
[44:09] it and Jesus said unto him if thou can't
[44:12] believe all things are possible to him
[44:14] that believeth and straight way the
[44:16] father of the child cried out and said
[44:18] with tears Lord I believe help thou my
[44:23] unbelief that that portion of scripture
[44:26] has always got me just a little bit I
[44:28] believe but help thou mine unbelief and
[44:31] in James chapter 2 and ver14 James 2:14
[44:35] what doth it profit my brethren though a
[44:38] man say he hath faith and have not works
[44:41] can Faith save him if a brother or
[44:43] sister be naked and destitute of daily
[44:45] food and one of you say unto them depart
[44:47] in peace be ye warmed and filled
[44:50] notwithstanding you give them not those
[44:52] things which are needful to the body
[44:53] what doth it profit even so faith if it
[44:57] hath not works is dead being alone you
[45:00] may be seated may the Lord add His
[45:02] blessings to the word I was reading that
[45:05] scripture and and I was I was listening
[45:07] to a tape and I may have stolen my title
[45:09] from a message brother Brandon preached
[45:11] in 19 55 I believe it was faith in
[45:14] action and if you listen to that sermon
[45:16] brother brandham just I mean he just
[45:18] preaches his heart out and uh just
[45:20] really gets after it and preaches and
[45:22] and at the end he has a prayer line and
[45:24] the spirit of the Lord just moves in and
[45:27] uh as he as he so often did and because
[45:30] he knew where he stood he knew who he
[45:32] was he he had faith and that what God
[45:34] told him as a little boy was right and
[45:37] so you could see in a prayer line that
[45:39] was more than just a prayer line that's
[45:40] Faith and Action and so I was listening
[45:43] to that sermon and I got to reading some
[45:45] of the things that Jesus said about
[45:47] faith and and and the disciples would
[45:49] say about faith and and this quote stood
[45:51] out to me it's a little bit lengthy so
[45:52] bear with me for just a moment it said
[45:54] now Faith is not based based upon the
[45:56] shifting Sands of man's ideas if I come
[45:59] here and told you there was an angel of
[46:01] the Lord that was in the building and
[46:02] these things happening if I didn't have
[46:04] something to prove that to you you'd
[46:06] have a right to doubt it if I said God
[46:09] gave a gift to do a certain thing and
[46:11] you've seen it come right back around
[46:12] and fail he said you'd say that's wrong
[46:15] aren't you glad it never did he said but
[46:17] when it comes back and God proves it
[46:19] every time to be perfect then that's
[46:21] right God has proved it so that's the
[46:24] way we have to have faith to have a
[46:26] resting place so you have to have faith
[46:29] in something and many times we have to
[46:31] see something and feel something to to
[46:34] have the faith it shouldn't have to be
[46:35] that way but we really have to I mean if
[46:37] brother Brandon would have come along
[46:38] and never showed the first poll to us we
[46:41] would have no reason to believe the
[46:43] second and the third pull but he had to
[46:45] come along and show us something for us
[46:47] to have faith in what was to come and so
[46:49] he said he said if I had if if I come
[46:51] along and said I could do a certain
[46:53] thing and and it didn't happen then it
[46:55] would fail you'd say that's wrong but
[46:56] when it comes back and God proves it
[46:58] every time to be perfect then that's
[47:00] right God has proved it so that's the
[47:03] way we have to have faith in the resting
[47:04] place and he goes on down he says if
[47:06] you're going to get married and the
[47:07] woman that you'd marry or the the boy
[47:09] that you would marry you have to have
[47:10] faith to do that because that's the only
[47:12] way it's going to last you have to
[47:13] believe that who you're marrying is
[47:15] meant for you brother Justin on your
[47:17] anniversary you have to believe that
[47:18] that one is for you because if you don't
[47:20] then then you know it's going to be a
[47:22] long road if you're always questioning
[47:23] did I make the right decision no you
[47:26] believe you made the right decision you
[47:27] believe that's the one for you and so
[47:30] when you get married you have to have
[47:31] faith everything you do in life there
[47:32] has to have there has to be Faith
[47:34] involved everything you do the job you
[47:36] take you have to believe that job's
[47:38] going to provide for you you have to
[47:39] believe that job's going to be good for
[47:40] you you don't want to get into a
[47:41] miserable situation you have to have
[47:43] faith it all comes down to believing and
[47:45] having faith so in everything you do
[47:47] there's got to be Faith involved yes and
[47:50] so he goes on down and he said the only
[47:52] solid resting place for faith is on
[47:54] God's word can you you say Amen to that
[47:56] so I believe tonight if you really want
[47:58] to find a place to put your faith it's
[48:00] in the word of God we can put Faith in a
[48:03] man and the man will fail you you can
[48:04] put Faith in in in in a president and
[48:06] the president's going to fail you you
[48:08] can have faith in nothing but the word
[48:10] of God because all else will fail all of
[48:12] ground is sinking sand but the word of
[48:14] God stands sure and will last forever I
[48:17] believe that faith I is is got to be
[48:20] you've got to be sold out with faith to
[48:22] the word of God he said he said any
[48:24] faith that anybody wants to have the
[48:25] supernatural it must be placed first in
[48:28] the word of the Living God he said now
[48:31] how how it's been through the age how
[48:33] that when uh men of old in all ages when
[48:35] they would really find the word of God
[48:36] and could grasp it Faith went into
[48:39] action right away and he talks about
[48:40] Noah here and he said and Noah he said
[48:42] when God spoke to Noah and said the word
[48:45] of God came to Noah and told them to
[48:47] build an ark for the saving of his
[48:48] household and he said you know the world
[48:50] stood upright before the anian
[48:52] destruction and it wasn't leaning back
[48:54] like this to bring water and when God
[48:55] told Noah he said it's going to send a
[48:57] flood and a rain he said you know he had
[48:59] all kinds of critics he said but Faith
[49:01] doesn't look at the circumstances come
[49:03] on somebody Faith doesn't look at the
[49:05] circumstances Faith doesn't look at the
[49:07] critics but Faith looks at the word of
[49:09] God and he said Faith looks to What God
[49:12] Says and Faith doesn't try to reason
[49:14] Faith just takes it at its face value
[49:17] now he said there's two different kinds
[49:18] of what we call Faith today he said and
[49:20] I'm sorry to say this to my audience
[49:22] tonight but I'm pretty sure I'm tooo
[49:24] sure of this or or real sure of this
[49:27] that there's too much intellectual faith
[49:29] in the stead of being heart faith and I
[49:32] would say today intellectual faith will
[49:34] fail you but faith in the word of God
[49:37] will never fail because that is an
[49:39] eternal faith on an eternal word can you
[49:42] say Amen so what you if you realize
[49:45] today I just want to bring you down into
[49:46] the message here for a minute if you
[49:48] really understand the message and you
[49:50] really look into the message there is no
[49:52] reason to doubt this message even from
[49:54] an intellectual side amen you can't
[49:56] disprove the message of the hour but
[49:58] Satan uses intellectual faith in a
[50:01] person and what they'll do is they'll
[50:02] say well I I don't have any facts for
[50:05] this and I don't have any facts for that
[50:07] well I I can show you all through
[50:08] history we don't have facts for a whole
[50:10] lot of things but lay down your
[50:12] intellectual faith and take God at his
[50:14] word we don't have facts that Noah was
[50:16] there we don't have facts that a lot of
[50:18] things Jesus said happen happened but we
[50:20] believe it by faith in the word of God
[50:22] and then a prophet would come along in a
[50:24] day that we're living in and prove by
[50:27] the very same works that it really did
[50:29] happen you you can be Baptist and you
[50:31] have no proof that Jesus ever lived you
[50:33] could be Methodist and there's no proof
[50:35] that Jesus ever lived but in the message
[50:37] of the hour we have proof that Jesus
[50:39] Christ is alive because he did the same
[50:41] works that Christ did so today we should
[50:44] have more faith than anybody else
[50:47] because we've seen it we've heard it we
[50:50] have proof of it and yet there's still
[50:52] an intellectual faith that the Believers
[50:54] take a hold of that causes them to doubt
[50:58] think about it tonight there's still an
[51:00] intellectual uh aspect to our faith and
[51:03] Satan will get in there and try to make
[51:05] you doubt but if you'll take the word
[51:09] just like it's always been the program
[51:11] of God has never changed it never will
[51:14] change if somebody tries to change it
[51:17] you can look at that and say that's not
[51:18] with the word you may be my brother you
[51:20] may be my sister you you may be a friend
[51:23] but if you're off the words you're off
[51:25] the word
[51:25] that's all there is to it but you've got
[51:27] to stay with the Vindicated word of the
[51:29] hour and and he said see so many
[51:31] revivals are going across the country he
[51:34] said revivals are going across the
[51:36] country and people are claiming to be
[51:37] saved and great evangelist saying they
[51:39] had so many thousands saved and so forth
[51:41] he said I believe it's been and then you
[51:43] go back and find out those people don't
[51:45] stay he said what is it just an emotion
[51:48] in the meeting and they worked and they
[51:50] worked away many people in the meeting
[51:52] raised up and claim healing and walk
[51:54] away more by emot
[51:56] or more by psychic than they do by real
[51:58] Divine Healing of or divine revelation
[52:00] of healing he said and the first little
[52:02] pain strikes and they give up and say
[52:04] well I didn't get my healing now that's
[52:06] an intellectual Faith well I thought I
[52:08] got it I think I got it but I didn't
[52:11] feel good afterwards that's an
[52:12] intellectual Faith let's cast down that
[52:14] intellectual Faith tonight he said he
[52:17] said that's right cuz your faith he said
[52:19] he said but now now you really must
[52:21] believe with your whole heart 10,000
[52:24] pains would never make you give up come
[52:26] on somebody your faith is already went
[52:29] into motion then he said you're in
[52:31] action right there and I would like to
[52:33] say this if you come on the basis of the
[52:35] word of God and accept your healing and
[52:37] you've accepted your salvation if it's
[52:39] on the basis of the word don't let
[52:42] anybody talk you out of it because if
[52:44] somebody tries to talk you out of
[52:46] something that is a true experience with
[52:48] God you can look at that and say no
[52:50] that's an intellectual Faith that's
[52:51] Faith that's trying to take me out of
[52:53] out of the program of God but over over
[52:55] here I can look at the word of God and
[52:57] have perfect faith in a perfect word a
[53:00] and a perfect program because God is
[53:03] always doing the same thing the same way
[53:06] right so if you had faith for your
[53:08] salvation then you use that same faith
[53:10] for your
[53:11] healing well I'm saved I have no doubt
[53:14] about it but I just can't claim my
[53:15] healing the same Faith same Faith now if
[53:20] you can't have faith for your
[53:22] healing then you better check up on your
[53:24] faith for salvation when the battle gets
[53:27] hard and it gets tough yes don't be one
[53:30] of those that fall away because you just
[53:32] had a a feel-good emotion that you got
[53:34] saved or you thought you got saved no
[53:36] it's got to be a lasting Faith it's got
[53:39] to be something I I I tell you when them
[53:41] disciples went down and they started
[53:42] getting killed off every one of them
[53:44] stood true to their testimony they
[53:47] didn't back up what was it because it
[53:48] was faith that Jesus was really the son
[53:51] of God and today we've got to have the
[53:53] same Faith it's really just as as simple
[53:55] as that you've got to have faith in the
[53:57] word to believe the word if you don't
[54:00] have faith you're not going to see it
[54:02] and you're not going to believe it can
[54:03] you say Amen now brother Bram goes on
[54:05] down he talks about Noah some more and
[54:06] he said he said now God spoke to Noah
[54:09] and told him the
[54:11] impossible some people listen about
[54:13] their kids and say well you said my kids
[54:15] could be saved that's impossible no it's
[54:16] not impossible because God's always
[54:18] proved that the impossible is still
[54:21] possible With God all things are
[54:23] possible and he said when Noah he said
[54:25] he told him the impossible now there was
[54:27] no rain had never rained never was a
[54:29] cloud in the sky nothing but Noah knew
[54:32] that it was going to rain because God
[54:34] said so the weatherman didn't say so but
[54:37] God said so you know I I you all kinds
[54:39] of people can tell you that message
[54:41] ain't right the message ain't right the
[54:43] YouTube channels can can make their
[54:44] videos the message is wrong and he
[54:46] failed here and he failed there but God
[54:47] said it's right and I really don't care
[54:49] what nobody else says you say well how
[54:52] can you prove it because the word of God
[54:54] is is still doing the same thing that it
[54:57] did 2,000 years ago 4,000 years ago it
[55:00] has never changed that's how I know it's
[55:02] still God because a prophet came well
[55:05] why would you believe in a prophet
[55:06] because God always sent a prophet why
[55:08] would you believe a prophet's words
[55:10] because that's what we have in the Bible
[55:12] is a prophet's word we don't have
[55:14] anything else to rest our souls on but
[55:16] the word of God by a Vindicated Prophet
[55:19] that's what we believe here tonight
[55:21] because that is faith believing what God
[55:23] did he still does
[55:25] does why do you believe that the message
[55:27] is so real because it is exactly in line
[55:30] with the biblical program of God and if
[55:33] he never changed and if you believe he
[55:36] never changes then he sure can't change
[55:38] today that's brother Bram said Noah knew
[55:41] that it was going to rain because God
[55:42] said so now he was considered fanatic
[55:44] and so are we today you fit in a whole
[55:47] lot better if you go to a a nominal
[55:48] church right and you you you're you know
[55:51] maybe you're have a better name in
[55:52] society and but I I tell you we don't
[55:54] need a better name in Society what we
[55:56] need is a better name up there we need
[55:58] our name written down to where it
[55:59] doesn't matter about the the book of
[56:01] who's who or or I you know I've got a
[56:03] good status down here on Earth no that
[56:05] don't really matter not to the believer
[56:07] because this is just a temporary home
[56:09] but we're going somewhere we're going
[56:10] where there's peace where there's joy
[56:12] where it don't matter what your last
[56:14] name was it don't matter what your
[56:15] family history was come on somebody it
[56:17] don't matter what you did you're going
[56:19] to a place where you're completely
[56:21] redeemed and made whole and you're young
[56:23] again brother Bill you don't have to get
[56:25] up with them aches and pains no more but
[56:26] you're going somewhere where you can be
[56:28] changed back that's a word I want to
[56:30] believe in that's the word I'm going to
[56:32] rest my soul on because I can have faith
[56:34] in the word like that well how do you
[56:36] know it's true because one day there was
[56:38] a man named Enoch who had lived all them
[56:40] hundreds of years and he walked with God
[56:41] and one day he was changed and he wasn't
[56:43] seen here no more well how how could
[56:45] that be because it's going to happen a
[56:47] whole bunch more times I believe I'm
[56:49] looking at people here today who are
[56:50] going to walk out of this body and
[56:52] you're going to have a body change one
[56:53] of these days you say brother B bill for
[56:55] the bill can look and say well I'm
[56:56] getting old I may go by way of the Grave
[56:58] oh he may not he may be the first one
[56:59] out of here you never know he might he
[57:01] might wake up tomorrow in a new body we
[57:03] might wake up tomorrow at a new body the
[57:05] youngest person could have a body change
[57:07] by morning I think we ought to just have
[57:09] faith that if God did it once he can do
[57:11] it again I have faith for a Rapture
[57:14] because God already translated one and I
[57:17] believe he can do it for me see it's not
[57:20] just a myth it's just not something
[57:21] we're talking about it's something that
[57:23] God's actually done for us it's
[57:25] something God's proven in his word and
[57:27] if he proved his word then we need to
[57:29] have
[57:30] faith now if you really have faith then
[57:33] you'll prove your faith by your actions
[57:37] yes right now your actions won't prove
[57:39] your faith I can stand up here and say
[57:41] I'm a Christian I'm a Christian but if
[57:43] my actions don't prove it then I'm not a
[57:45] Christian you can say I have faith for
[57:47] my healing I have faith for my healing
[57:49] and you need to confess that even if
[57:50] your faith is weak you believe that I I
[57:53] I mean confess it until you do have the
[57:55] faith I'm not saying not to do that but
[57:57] what I'm saying is at some point if
[57:59] you've really got the faith it's going
[58:00] to take hold and you're going to get
[58:01] your healing and so hold on to your
[58:04] faith don't doubt because it doesn't
[58:06] happen right away but be strong giving
[58:09] praise to the Lord for your healing be
[58:11] strong giving praise to the Lord that
[58:13] your children are coming back come on
[58:15] somebody be strong in faith and put your
[58:18] faith in action so if you have believe
[58:21] the word of God then you're going to do
[58:24] what the word of God says right if you
[58:27] really believe it you're going to do it
[58:28] I that's just that's believing and
[58:29] acting that's what you do you say well I
[58:31] believe the message of the hour then
[58:32] well we have a message on tape we have a
[58:34] message in the books the preachers will
[58:36] stand here and we're going to preach at
[58:37] the best of our ability to tell you what
[58:39] it says then you got to put it into
[58:41] action it don't do you no good to hear
[58:43] at every service if you're never going
[58:45] to put it into action but I think we
[58:47] need to take a hold of the words that
[58:48] we've heard take a hold of what a
[58:50] prophet said and put our faith into
[58:52] action tonight I think we would be so
[58:54] much much farther up the road if we
[58:56] could really take hold of what we
[58:57] already know we want to know more
[58:59] revelation we want to know more and it's
[59:01] good we need to always trying to have a
[59:03] progressive revelation and I I think we
[59:05] need that I think we need to know more
[59:06] about the message and and I believe in
[59:08] the teaching and things like that I'm
[59:09] not against that but take what you
[59:11] already know and put that faith into
[59:14] action I think if we start there then we
[59:17] can add to these things let's start
[59:19] let's you know be faithful over the
[59:21] little things then God will make you
[59:22] ruler over much let's let let's take the
[59:24] little things the the little obedience
[59:26] thing put your faith in obedience to the
[59:28] word of God and watch God bless you well
[59:30] I need a new job well just believe for
[59:32] it pray for now if you say well I just
[59:34] want a new job and sit back and say well
[59:36] God you're obligated to give me one no
[59:38] that's not the way you come to God he's
[59:40] not obligated to give you nothing but
[59:42] you come in faith believing and saying
[59:44] Lord you know what I have need of come
[59:47] on somebody you know what I have you
[59:48] know I'm not going to make it if you
[59:50] don't heal me you know that I'm coming
[59:52] down to the end of my life if you don't
[59:53] heal me if you don't make this right if
[59:55] you don't heal my marriage you know it's
[59:57] not going to last that's how you come in
[59:59] faith believing say but Lord I know that
[1:00:01] if you've ever healed one person of
[1:00:04] cancer or diabetes or or anything else
[1:00:06] if you've ever healed one you can heal
[1:00:09] me even so be it unto me the three
[1:00:13] Hebrew children were standing there
[1:00:15] getting ready to go in the fiery furnace
[1:00:16] it was okay for them to say the Flames
[1:00:19] can't hurt me God is able to deliver me
[1:00:21] but they had to believe it they didn't
[1:00:24] go in kick it and screaming but they
[1:00:25] went right on in there believing their
[1:00:27] testimony they believe that what they
[1:00:29] said could really happen do you believe
[1:00:31] you could really go on a Rapture then
[1:00:33] get ready for it see your your action
[1:00:36] will prove if you really believe in an
[1:00:38] in a Rapture because if you really
[1:00:40] believe in it you're going to get your
[1:00:41] life just as close as you can to the
[1:00:44] word that came because if you if you're
[1:00:46] still living like the devil say well
[1:00:48] when when I start seeing the squeeze
[1:00:49] come on or come on somebody when I see
[1:00:52] brother brandom come back and start
[1:00:53] talking amongst his loved ones are I
[1:00:55] start seeing my loved ones come oh it's
[1:00:57] too late then church we got to get ready
[1:00:59] now we got to get ready now to see our
[1:01:02] loved ones because it is going to happen
[1:01:04] but you've got to get ready for it see
[1:01:07] that's putting your faith in action
[1:01:08] putting your faith off and say Well when
[1:01:10] it starts to happen I'll get right with
[1:01:12] God that's not the way we come to God we
[1:01:14] don't owe God doesn't owe us anything
[1:01:17] God doesn't owe you more time to get
[1:01:18] ready God doesn't owe you nothing but
[1:01:20] you owe your whole life to him can you
[1:01:23] say Amen God is not someone who we just
[1:01:27] we just use as an object to get what we
[1:01:29] want kind of like your kids do when they
[1:01:32] want something dad I need
[1:01:35] this
[1:01:37] right
[1:01:38] no dad I need this but I don't have the
[1:01:41] money for it can I have it Dad I really
[1:01:43] need you know I need I WHYY it's sitting
[1:01:45] there I need some more football
[1:01:47] cards I need a new phone I you know yeah
[1:01:50] already seven years old I need a phone
[1:01:52] no you don't need a phone but but you
[1:01:55] know that's the way God is he don't
[1:01:56] always give you what you
[1:01:58] want but ask him ask
[1:02:01] abundantly and ask in a way that he
[1:02:04] would actually want to give you
[1:02:05] something if they come to me and say hey
[1:02:07] you need to get me this I'm not going to
[1:02:09] get it you go to God and say hey can you
[1:02:12] come down here and you know raise my pay
[1:02:14] by $10 an hour already cuz I'm getting
[1:02:16] tired of living like
[1:02:18] this now he's put you where you are for
[1:02:20] a reason he's giv you what you got for a
[1:02:23] reason but what you need to do is really
[1:02:26] get in touch with God and and say Lord
[1:02:29] this is something I really need see the
[1:02:31] faith to move mountains don't just go
[1:02:32] out here and start rearranging the
[1:02:34] national parks but the faith to move a
[1:02:36] mountain is when there's a mountain that
[1:02:38] needs to be moved your faith can move it
[1:02:41] when there's a tree he said that needed
[1:02:43] to be moved and plucked up and set over
[1:02:44] here by the water if if you need it to
[1:02:47] happen if it's something you need to
[1:02:49] happen have faith that it will happen
[1:02:51] and it will happen because that's what
[1:02:53] you come to God but we don't come to God
[1:02:55] just just I I I want all this stuff that
[1:02:57] don't even that I don't really need and
[1:02:59] you know God wants to give you
[1:03:00] everything you want but he also knows
[1:03:02] what you need he knows what's best for
[1:03:04] you we don't always know what's best for
[1:03:06] us because we have no idea what tomorrow
[1:03:08] holds but he does so let's do what he
[1:03:12] wants to do and so staying with the word
[1:03:15] obedience to the word is Faith and
[1:03:18] Action I believe that if you obey the
[1:03:21] word that's putting your faith that you
[1:03:22] say I believe the message of the power
[1:03:24] put into action put it into action by
[1:03:27] obedience to the word it's just pretty
[1:03:29] simple it's pretty simple you that are
[1:03:31] sitting here on a Wednesday night you
[1:03:32] have you put your faith in action to be
[1:03:34] here tonight right you put your faith in
[1:03:37] action when you when you got up and
[1:03:39] opened your Bible this morning and
[1:03:40] prayed you were putting your faith into
[1:03:42] action that's right when you get down
[1:03:44] when you get home tonight and you sit
[1:03:46] there and you start to pray with your
[1:03:47] children or maybe you sit down and you
[1:03:49] start to read your Bible or or listen to
[1:03:50] a tape that's putting your faith into
[1:03:52] action it's more than saying I'm just a
[1:03:54] Christian when I'm at church but you got
[1:03:56] to be a Christian when you get home you
[1:03:59] got to be a Christian in front of your
[1:04:00] children or else they're going to
[1:04:01] realize someday that he wasn't really a
[1:04:04] Believer he was just a make believer now
[1:04:07] brother Bram said there's three kinds of
[1:04:08] Believers there's a Believer a make
[1:04:10] believer and an unbeliever and you know
[1:04:12] which one he said was the worst kind the
[1:04:14] make
[1:04:15] believer right so you know who a
[1:04:18] Believer is you can watch them you watch
[1:04:20] them they will do I mean they they do
[1:04:22] everything they can to do what they can
[1:04:25] what to to live the message of the hour
[1:04:27] to the word of God they'll do everything
[1:04:28] they can to live it now I guess you
[1:04:31] could say they could fool you it's
[1:04:33] possible that they could really live
[1:04:35] like that and then someday fall away I
[1:04:37] guess that's possible but you know what
[1:04:39] make believer is really the worst kind
[1:04:41] because you know sometimes they're real
[1:04:42] spiritual sometimes they tell you
[1:04:44] everything you want to hear come on
[1:04:46] somebody you never met nobody like that
[1:04:48] they tell you everything you want to
[1:04:50] hear because they're the most spiritual
[1:04:51] person in the church but then you go out
[1:04:54] here watch their life and they start you
[1:04:56] know running people down and cheating
[1:04:58] somebody and and all this kind of stuff
[1:05:00] that that's just a makeb believer that's
[1:05:01] what they are can they become a Believer
[1:05:04] I believe they can but they've got to
[1:05:05] get in line with the word of God and
[1:05:08] start putting that faith that they say
[1:05:09] they have into
[1:05:11] action because I don't mean this I don't
[1:05:14] mean to yell at you I did enough of that
[1:05:16] on Sunday but but I but I yeah somebody
[1:05:19] said that's true I heard you I heard you
[1:05:23] but uh listen I don't mean to yell at
[1:05:25] you tonight but I but this was a this
[1:05:27] thought really come to me really because
[1:05:29] I started looking at myself you know I
[1:05:31] can stand up here and I can preach to
[1:05:32] you and I can sing I can do whatever I
[1:05:34] want you know I can stand up here and do
[1:05:35] all that stuff but that that ain't going
[1:05:36] to save me coming to church ain't going
[1:05:38] to save you but if you're saved where
[1:05:41] are you going to be when the doors are
[1:05:43] open if you really are a holy ghost
[1:05:46] filled Christian you can't wait to be
[1:05:49] where other Christians are and you know
[1:05:51] when you say things like that all the
[1:05:53] people that can't make it and they have
[1:05:54] legitimate reasons they start feeling
[1:05:55] bad I don't mean to make anybody feel
[1:05:57] bad but if you can do what the word says
[1:06:01] do what the word says and I believe God
[1:06:03] will bless you for it I really do I see
[1:06:05] people out here tonight that are driving
[1:06:06] an hour on a Wednesday night I I say
[1:06:08] praise God for people that'll still put
[1:06:10] forth effort because they see it in the
[1:06:12] word and they want to do what the word
[1:06:14] said it's a whole lot easier not to do
[1:06:17] that but you know what it's going to be
[1:06:18] a whole lot better for you when you
[1:06:19] really put your faith in action then
[1:06:21] when you need something from God think
[1:06:24] about it if my kids actually are doing
[1:06:26] something for me and they're actually
[1:06:29] cleaning their rooms don't ever happen
[1:06:31] but if they do no they really do they're
[1:06:34] pretty good kids two two or three out of
[1:06:36] the four are and so they're pretty good
[1:06:38] kids but you know what if they really
[1:06:40] just start disobeying what I've asked
[1:06:42] them to do and then they start coming
[1:06:44] around asking for good
[1:06:47] gifts now my initial reaction is I say
[1:06:51] my kids are good and I got one crawling
[1:06:52] all over the place
[1:06:54] you know they'll embarrass you quicker
[1:06:57] than anything I
[1:06:58] promise but if but but really if they if
[1:07:01] they've just treated me real bad and
[1:07:03] they don't listen to me and then I then
[1:07:05] they come around and they want something
[1:07:07] brand new and they want to add to their
[1:07:08] toy collection that they already can't
[1:07:10] take care of now as a father it's
[1:07:14] probably best if I don't just give in to
[1:07:16] what they want but as a Christian come
[1:07:18] on somebody I I hope this is okay I'm
[1:07:20] not trying to preach at anybody this
[1:07:22] might all be for me tonight but as a
[1:07:24] Christian I can't go out here and live
[1:07:26] like the world 6 days a week come to
[1:07:29] church on Sunday and say Lord I need a
[1:07:32] blessing he don't work that way he wants
[1:07:35] you to give all that you've got for him
[1:07:37] I know he'll take what you give him but
[1:07:39] he wants more from you he wants more
[1:07:41] praise more worship he wants more of
[1:07:44] your time in prayer he wants to hear
[1:07:46] from you once in a while not just when
[1:07:48] you want to call him but he needs you to
[1:07:50] talk back once in a while say Lord here
[1:07:53] I am
[1:07:54] it's me
[1:07:55] again you know I think sometimes he may
[1:07:58] not know what you sound like cuz you
[1:07:59] don't talk to him
[1:08:00] enough but he wants you to talk to him
[1:08:03] too or sometimes maybe he just wants you
[1:08:05] to get quiet enough to listen to what
[1:08:07] he's got to tell you now I'm just saying
[1:08:10] that as a father I may change my mind
[1:08:12] when they're teenagers I may say the
[1:08:14] Lord would like to kill all the
[1:08:17] kids you know they get bad I know I all
[1:08:20] the parents are already warning me and
[1:08:22] I'm like yeah I'm sorry I'm do my best I
[1:08:24] don't know what I'll do when I get there
[1:08:26] you know we're we're always going to do
[1:08:27] better than everybody else until it
[1:08:30] comes around and it's our turn right
[1:08:33] well I've watched their mistakes I would
[1:08:35] never make that mistake and then God
[1:08:38] laughs gives you the worst kid you could
[1:08:41] even possibly think
[1:08:43] of I'm way off but here I
[1:08:47] go Moses or Noah was a
[1:08:52] fanatic he said most always when you
[1:08:54] find people that'll dare to take God at
[1:08:56] his word they're considered neurotics or
[1:09:00] Fanatics can you say amen he said that's
[1:09:04] right the real True Believer has never
[1:09:06] had the world to Pat him on the back
[1:09:09] it's always against him because he takes
[1:09:12] God at his word and God has never been a
[1:09:15] friend to the world in the way of the
[1:09:18] world uh friend of God I mean he said
[1:09:22] they're against God because they can't
[1:09:25] understand God so it it's it's a
[1:09:28] constant battle they're they're always
[1:09:29] fighting God whether they know it or not
[1:09:32] and so they're not a friend to God I
[1:09:34] think tonight we need to be a friend to
[1:09:36] God I want to put my faith in action so
[1:09:39] that I can believe his word do what he
[1:09:41] said and quit fighting against the
[1:09:43] program of God can you say
[1:09:45] amen he said and he said you'll never
[1:09:48] know God Only by
[1:09:51] faith and he said but no he moved with
[1:09:55] fear now that's not a fear as in I'm
[1:09:57] scared but in in a knowing that God was
[1:10:00] going to keep his word so he moved with
[1:10:02] fear knowing that there was coming a
[1:10:04] destruction and he built an ark because
[1:10:06] he had his faith rested upon God's
[1:10:08] Eternal Word no matter how much the
[1:10:10] people said it can't be done no matter
[1:10:12] how much science comb the globe and said
[1:10:14] there'll never be clouds up there
[1:10:15] there's no rain to come down if God's
[1:10:18] word said that it's going to rain it's
[1:10:20] up to God to make a way for the rain if
[1:10:23] God said so that settles it there's an
[1:10:25] old saying that says I if the prophet
[1:10:28] spoke it I believe it that settles it I
[1:10:29] I'll just put it like this I I hate to
[1:10:31] add to that but you know if if the
[1:10:33] prophet spoke it if God said it and the
[1:10:35] prophet spoke it I believe it I'll act
[1:10:37] on it and that'll settle it because you
[1:10:40] can say you believe it hey brother Bram
[1:10:42] said it's not enough to believe it go
[1:10:44] listen to the Token message it's not
[1:10:45] enough to believe it it's not enough to
[1:10:47] say I'm a Believer in the message of the
[1:10:48] hour but you've got to put your faith in
[1:10:50] action and if you really believe it your
[1:10:53] works will prove that you're a real
[1:10:55] believer come on somebody if you're here
[1:10:58] on a Wednesday night you can take it
[1:10:59] because you're saying I'm I'm here I'm
[1:11:01] putting my faith in action but when
[1:11:03] tomorrow comes around and Satan comes at
[1:11:05] you and you feel like you're just too
[1:11:07] sick to get out of bed that's the time
[1:11:09] to put your faith in action well you and
[1:11:11] I'm not talking about people that really
[1:11:12] get sick and you know you've got to have
[1:11:14] faith too but sometimes you just really
[1:11:16] can't get out of bed but what you got to
[1:11:18] do is remember that the same God that
[1:11:20] healed anybody and brought them off
[1:11:22] their sick bed can still do it for
[1:11:25] you we just got to believe we just got
[1:11:27] to have faith and and I don't have much
[1:11:29] time left so I'm going to get you out of
[1:11:31] here on time but but he said he said uh
[1:11:33] don't don't make no difference how it
[1:11:34] looks it don't reason it there we are in
[1:11:37] that intellectual Faith again don't
[1:11:38] reason the word of God don't reason with
[1:11:40] your faith intellectual faith will
[1:11:42] reason every time but and it'll try to
[1:11:45] Pro prove God wrong can you imagine
[1:11:47] trying to prove God wrong when he's made
[1:11:49] the deaf to hear and the dumb to speak
[1:11:51] and the blind to see and the dead to
[1:11:53] live again can you imagine trying to
[1:11:55] prove that wrong can you imagine trying
[1:11:58] to prove a a message wrong when the
[1:12:00] messenger came and literally stood
[1:12:03] before thousands of people and could
[1:12:05] tell somebody their name and their
[1:12:07] address and tell them who they were tell
[1:12:09] them what was wrong with them I knew a
[1:12:10] sister in Hot Springs I went to church
[1:12:12] with her for 10 years and she said that
[1:12:14] she was in California to meeting and
[1:12:16] it's on tape she let me listen to it she
[1:12:17] said brother brandham actually spoke to
[1:12:19] her she was I I forget how many rows
[1:12:21] back seven or eight back in a in a big
[1:12:23] colge see him there in California and
[1:12:25] she's sitting in the audience and
[1:12:27] brother brandom said sister I see you
[1:12:29] and he said now nobody else could see
[1:12:30] you where you're at because you were in
[1:12:32] your bathroom and you were getting
[1:12:34] dressed and there was a big uh big lump
[1:12:36] there on your side this woman didn't
[1:12:37] walk up to the front this woman didn't
[1:12:39] come in for prayer she had no prayer
[1:12:41] card and the family I knew every one of
[1:12:43] them I went her her brother-in-law was
[1:12:45] my pastor for 10 years and I'm here to
[1:12:47] tell you brother brandham had no idea
[1:12:49] who that family was but because he saw a
[1:12:52] vision you said I'm going to prove that
[1:12:54] man wrong no I'm going to tell you right
[1:12:55] now God already proved him right he can
[1:12:58] stand there and look at things that you
[1:13:00] could never know never seen I'm not
[1:13:02] lifting up a man but I'm saying God
[1:13:04] showed in this generation that he still
[1:13:07] had a Vindicated prophet he always had a
[1:13:09] Vindicated word I'm not here to try to
[1:13:11] prove it wrong I'm not here to bring up
[1:13:13] his mistakes well come on somebody you
[1:13:15] know when Abraham made mistakes and he
[1:13:17] actually doubted in the Old Testament go
[1:13:19] read what God said about him in the New
[1:13:21] Testament he said he staggered not at
[1:13:23] the promises of God so you know what if
[1:13:25] God can't see the mistakes I'm not here
[1:13:27] to bring them up I'm not here to talk
[1:13:29] about it what I'll tell you is this yes
[1:13:31] he was a man but God used that
[1:13:34] man God used that man to bring you a
[1:13:37] message that was Vindicated we need to
[1:13:39] lay down our intellectual Faith well was
[1:13:41] the cloud in this certain spot was
[1:13:43] brother brandom in the right place at
[1:13:44] the right time well oh come on somebody
[1:13:46] lay aside your nonsense and stay with
[1:13:49] the word that God has proven to be
[1:13:52] true well do we just not believe no I
[1:13:54] tell you what we wasn't there we don't
[1:13:56] know exactly what happened brother
[1:13:58] brandom says he wasn't even standing
[1:13:59] there but I'm tell you this if God would
[1:14:02] vindicate a lie then God is not even
[1:14:07] right God doesn't vindicate a lie but he
[1:14:10] Vindicated that Prophet come on somebody
[1:14:13] I I just feel to go here for a minute if
[1:14:14] it's okay but God Vindicated him not
[1:14:17] because he was a perfect human being but
[1:14:20] because he was God's chosen man for the
[1:14:22] hour now I want to just go here for a
[1:14:24] second he also said he would have a
[1:14:26] people on Earth who would do the Greater
[1:14:28] Works he would have somebody here doing
[1:14:31] the same works that he did now if you
[1:14:33] can just get your faith and put it in
[1:14:34] action you don't have to take a backseat
[1:14:36] to nobody what the prophet did you can
[1:14:39] do what Jesus did you can do what the
[1:14:42] apostles did well you can't just do it
[1:14:45] but you will do it because these signs
[1:14:47] will follow them that believe it didn't
[1:14:50] say it would follow the preacher it
[1:14:51] would follow the deacons it would follow
[1:14:53] this one or that one or this great
[1:14:54] evangelist no it would follow everyone
[1:14:57] that could believe on the word of God
[1:14:59] that's who it's going to follow so
[1:15:01] tonight if you put your faith in action
[1:15:03] you don't have to worry about your
[1:15:05] children no more can you say Amen if you
[1:15:07] put your faith in action you don't have
[1:15:09] to worry about you know about the way
[1:15:11] the church is going to go but you come
[1:15:12] here believing and praying for your
[1:15:14] pastor and praying for the ministers and
[1:15:16] praying for the singers and praying for
[1:15:19] yourself that you can get something from
[1:15:21] God see it's putting your faith in
[1:15:22] action it's not enough to come and sit
[1:15:25] and say Well I this is just going to be
[1:15:26] another service no this is a service
[1:15:29] where all things are going to be
[1:15:30] restored this is another service where
[1:15:32] I'm going to get a little bit closer to
[1:15:34] a Rapture and a body change I think
[1:15:36] that's the way we need to come to church
[1:15:38] come believing that our faith is going
[1:15:40] to take hold of the promises of God
[1:15:42] that's putting your faith in action can
[1:15:44] you say Amen tonight that's putting your
[1:15:46] faith where it needs to be it's not a
[1:15:48] faith that you say you have but it's a
[1:15:51] faith that God sees God sees your faith
[1:15:54] and he rewards your faith brother Bill
[1:15:57] can get up in the morning I don't mean
[1:15:59] to pick on you brother Bill you're
[1:16:00] you're my one of my favorites I'm not
[1:16:01] picking on you here but I I hate to keep
[1:16:03] calling him out but I know brother Bill
[1:16:04] Gets in pain a lot and and I know that
[1:16:07] he he tries to go down here and walk he
[1:16:08] walks around Walmart you get down there
[1:16:10] real early one morning you might see him
[1:16:11] down there but he gets down there and
[1:16:13] walks and I know sometimes he don't make
[1:16:14] it all the way around because he hurts
[1:16:16] he's trying to do it he's trying to walk
[1:16:18] he's trying to he's trying to do
[1:16:19] something to keep himself active and and
[1:16:22] I commend you for that if I'm your age
[1:16:23] and I can still walk I'm going to do the
[1:16:25] same thing maybe not Walmart but
[1:16:27] whatever's around at that time but but
[1:16:29] what what he's doing is when he gets out
[1:16:31] of bed in the morning he's going to have
[1:16:32] to defeat a devil because he hurts every
[1:16:35] time he gets out of bed sometimes he
[1:16:37] can't hardly breathe and he comes here
[1:16:38] to church you say why does he do it then
[1:16:40] because he's obedient to the word of God
[1:16:43] and that's putting his faith in action
[1:16:45] you think God won't reward that I I I
[1:16:47] believe this with all my heart I was
[1:16:48] preaching here a few months back and I
[1:16:51] got to preaching on the uh the Promises
[1:16:53] of God and how your children could come
[1:16:55] back to the Lord and I looked over here
[1:16:56] and I saw sister Karen and as soon as I
[1:16:59] looked at her the there was something
[1:17:01] come over me and said you don't have to
[1:17:02] worry about your kids you can just
[1:17:04] believe for it and they had a grandkid
[1:17:06] in trouble at the time it wasn't me come
[1:17:08] on church I'm just trying to say this
[1:17:10] because their faith actually touched
[1:17:11] Heaven during a service and it it was
[1:17:14] like a next service or the service after
[1:17:16] that that young man was was was was out
[1:17:18] of trouble well come on somebody and he
[1:17:21] come back saying I you know brother Bill
[1:17:23] actually came up to the altar that
[1:17:24] service and his heart he was crying and
[1:17:27] he said you just don't know the shape my
[1:17:29] children are in right now but I believe
[1:17:31] that same faith is the faith that saved
[1:17:33] you and the faith that's bringing you
[1:17:35] out here when you don't feel like coming
[1:17:37] that same faith is going to have every
[1:17:38] one of your children standing there
[1:17:40] waiting for you you say I don't I don't
[1:17:43] believe it what he does that's all that
[1:17:46] matters what about the condition of them
[1:17:48] tonight it don't matter what the
[1:17:49] condition is it don't matter how dark it
[1:17:51] looks but what I'm telling tell you is
[1:17:53] God keeps his word and if you just
[1:17:56] believe the word that's putting your
[1:17:58] faith in action he don't have to go out
[1:18:00] and tell his kids say say I know you're
[1:18:02] going to be saved so you can just live
[1:18:03] no no he's praying that they come right
[1:18:05] here and get the same experience that he
[1:18:07] got but what he's really believing is it
[1:18:09] doesn't matter if he ever sees that
[1:18:10] happen he knows he's going to see him on
[1:18:12] the other side because the Bible said it
[1:18:15] would happen thine thy house shall be
[1:18:17] saved don't worry about
[1:18:20] it that's just faith on that's just
[1:18:23] Faith do you realize that anyway to get
[1:18:27] to heaven yourself you got to have faith
[1:18:29] for your children to get there we know
[1:18:31] they got to have an experience for
[1:18:32] themselves we know they've got to be
[1:18:34] saved we know that all these things but
[1:18:36] if you really have faith for yourself
[1:18:39] that same faith will bring them to that
[1:18:42] same place and that's what we believe as
[1:18:44] Christians when you I've been to
[1:18:46] funerals where I've looked at family
[1:18:48] members and I'm like Lord how in the
[1:18:49] world could they make it I know the
[1:18:51] condition but I have to look to a
[1:18:52] promise that if I believed for them then
[1:18:55] I know they're going to be there I don't
[1:18:56] know what the last minute of their life
[1:18:58] was like come on somebody I've been to
[1:19:00] funerals where I I I don't know that I
[1:19:01] could preach them to heaven but I'll say
[1:19:03] this after reading the word of God I can
[1:19:05] say this it don't matter what happened
[1:19:06] to him I'm just believing that something
[1:19:09] happened on their deathbed to get them
[1:19:11] there well I don't believe in deathbed
[1:19:12] experiences well I don't put a lot of
[1:19:13] stock in myself but I'll say this if you
[1:19:16] believe you just believe that they're
[1:19:17] going to be there hold on to faith no
[1:19:19] matter what the circumstances look like
[1:19:22] well I believe as long as they're living
[1:19:24] cuz they got a chance no believe yes
[1:19:26] believe until you're not even around no
[1:19:28] longer to believe just keep believing
[1:19:30] believe for your family believe for your
[1:19:32] church you say well I want to see our
[1:19:34] church more more on fire for god well
[1:19:36] just start believing for it you become
[1:19:38] on fire for God I I want to see people
[1:19:40] you know really come more often and and
[1:19:42] F the pews well me too but listen I got
[1:19:44] to just believe it's going to happen I
[1:19:46] got to believe for those people see
[1:19:48] we're we're believing for each other
[1:19:49] we're loving one another we've got to
[1:19:51] have that love and this time when
[1:19:53] everything's so cold everything's so
[1:19:55] hard anymore but we've got to have a
[1:19:57] love for one another to have faith for
[1:20:00] each other and then we can put our faith
[1:20:02] in action we don't look around to see
[1:20:03] who's missing on a Wednesday night but
[1:20:05] I'm here because I'm going to put my
[1:20:07] faith in action I'm going to put my
[1:20:08] faith with your faith and we're going to
[1:20:10] believe for those who couldn't make it
[1:20:12] that God will restore them God will
[1:20:13] raise them up God will give them a
[1:20:15] desire whatever they need maybe God will
[1:20:17] heal them whatever it is to get them
[1:20:18] back in the house of the Lord I think
[1:20:20] about brother Harold there who's so
[1:20:21] faithful to the church too so faithful
[1:20:23] to the house of God and Satan come in
[1:20:26] and tried to take him out but you know
[1:20:27] what it don't matter because Satan's not
[1:20:30] going to win because we're believing for
[1:20:32] his healing we're praying for him and I
[1:20:34] believe your prayers matter I believe
[1:20:37] your your prayers can still Touch Heaven
[1:20:39] I believe you can be sitting there just
[1:20:40] like brother Bill was and sister Karen
[1:20:42] was and your heart for your children
[1:20:45] your heart for your loved ones sitting
[1:20:47] in this building tonight can still Touch
[1:20:49] Heaven and Heaven can come down and
[1:20:51] restore him back to where they need to
[1:20:53] be that's putting faith in action I
[1:20:56] believe that's what the church needs
[1:20:57] tonight now this is what's on my heart I
[1:20:59] hope it's okay but we need faith in
[1:21:02] action let's not talk about it let's do
[1:21:05] it let's put it in action let me get
[1:21:07] right down here to where I can close I
[1:21:09] I'm I'm out of time I'm I'm going to get
[1:21:11] right down here where I can close and
[1:21:12] we'll stop he said what we need today is
[1:21:15] some real genuine Faith put into action
[1:21:18] he said yes sir we need real Faith men
[1:21:20] who dare to put God's word to their
[1:21:23] heart and apply it to themselves he said
[1:21:25] you try to apply it to the generation
[1:21:27] gone by but the Bible says that Jesus
[1:21:30] Christ is the same yesterday and today
[1:21:32] and forever he's forever God and he
[1:21:34] never fails somebody say never he never
[1:21:37] fails he said he's forever God he's the
[1:21:40] same in principle he's the same in power
[1:21:42] and he's the same tonight that he was
[1:21:44] when he walked on the banks of Galilee
[1:21:46] and he appears nightly on this platform
[1:21:48] brother BR said he appeared nightly well
[1:21:50] Christ wasn't there oh yes he was he
[1:21:51] appeared nightly
[1:21:54] he said and he proves himself alive from
[1:21:57] the dead can you say man you don't have
[1:21:59] to take history about it it's right now
[1:22:02] present time fact that we see it now
[1:22:05] that's what a prophet said in 1955 but I
[1:22:08] believe we can apply that tonight if
[1:22:10] he's Jesus Christ then and he was
[1:22:12] forever then he's Jesus Christ now so I
[1:22:15] can stand here with confidence and say
[1:22:17] it tonight that Jesus Christ is standing
[1:22:19] on the platform here
[1:22:21] tonight that don't make me nothing but
[1:22:23] what it does is makes the word true and
[1:22:26] puts my faith in action I can believe
[1:22:28] he's here you can believe he's here
[1:22:30] because the word said he's here well you
[1:22:32] say well brother Bram didn't say he's in
[1:22:33] Word of Life and Hearty no but he said
[1:22:35] he's the same yesterday and today and
[1:22:38] forever and if we're Believers wherever
[1:22:40] two or three are gathered we are in his
[1:22:43] midst and he is in our midst so I would
[1:22:45] say this tonight if he's here anything
[1:22:47] you have need of put your faith in
[1:22:49] action tonight step out on it and
[1:22:51] believe it you know I believe brother
[1:22:53] Daryl Wards preached it and brother
[1:22:54] Brandon preached it too but he's he's
[1:22:56] still in the boat tonight I believe he's
[1:22:58] an ontime God he's still right among his
[1:23:00] people you don't have to worry about
[1:23:02] nothing because you've got a Vindicated
[1:23:04] word we don't have to wonder is this
[1:23:06] word true it's Vindicated to be true you
[1:23:08] don't have to wonder C can God still do
[1:23:11] the same thing he's proven to still do
[1:23:13] the same thing he's proven to still be
[1:23:15] alive tonight all we have to do is
[1:23:18] believe it and put the faith that we say
[1:23:20] we have in action how many Believers we
[1:23:23] have here tonight then take what you say
[1:23:25] you believe in and put it in action here
[1:23:27] tonight I challenge The church here
[1:23:29] tonight don't just say it don't just
[1:23:31] talk about it but believe it with all
[1:23:33] your heart and and really step out on
[1:23:35] faith and say Lord I I I need more of
[1:23:38] you I Lord I believe but help thou my
[1:23:41] unbelief Lord I believe everything you
[1:23:44] said but help thou my unbelief cuz
[1:23:46] Satan's going to come and he's going to
[1:23:48] try to talk to you and try to get you to
[1:23:50] have an intellectual faith and that'll
[1:23:52] never make a Rapture but you've got to
[1:23:54] have a perfect faith in a perfect word
[1:23:57] and you will take a hold of a perfect
[1:23:59] promise do you believe that here tonight
[1:24:01] if our musicians would come let's stand
[1:24:02] to our
[1:24:03] feet my time's up and I want to just say
[1:24:06] this in closing if I can get to it here
[1:24:09] he said the heroes of the Old Testament
[1:24:11] they had Faith they put it in action
[1:24:15] you've got them for an
[1:24:16] example he said you've got them for an
[1:24:19] example now we've got faith but he said
[1:24:22] you won't put it into action he said
[1:24:25] ride away on the powers of the Holy
[1:24:28] Spirit that's how we're going to get out
[1:24:29] of here that's how you're going to get
[1:24:31] out of here is a Rapture real yes
[1:24:34] intellectual faith will say prove it but
[1:24:37] a real genuine faith in the word of God
[1:24:38] says I believe it that's what we got to
[1:24:41] have here tonight I believe the word of
[1:24:42] God I believe everything he said well
[1:24:45] that was like brother brandom's opinion
[1:24:46] I'll take his opinion over about
[1:24:48] anything else you can give me because
[1:24:50] I'll take a Vindicated Prophet come on
[1:24:52] on somebody I'll take a Vindicated word
[1:24:55] I'm not the one who was standing here
[1:24:56] Vindicated but he was it didn't
[1:24:59] vindicate a human being what it did was
[1:25:01] vindicate that Jesus Christ could still
[1:25:03] do the same works today and I believe by
[1:25:05] the word that he spoke you can still do
[1:25:07] the same works that he did do you
[1:25:09] believe that tonight amen if there's
[1:25:11] somebody in here that needs needs to be
[1:25:13] prayed for the altar is open I just want
[1:25:15] you tonight I want you to leave
[1:25:16] encouraged that what you have is
[1:25:20] enough I need more faith no if You' got
[1:25:23] the gra if you got faith like the grain
[1:25:24] of a mustard seed just put that faith in
[1:25:27] action just put that faith in action
[1:25:29] well I I don't understand the Mysteries
[1:25:31] quite yet well just put the faith You'
[1:25:32] got in action do you believe that God
[1:25:34] sent a prophet put that faith in action
[1:25:36] do you believe that he came with thus
[1:25:38] sayith the Lord put that faith in action

[1:25:45] what I I if we just put the basic things
[1:25:48] in action do the basic things we know to
[1:25:50] do God will add to your revelation God
[1:25:52] will add to your to your to your stature
[1:25:54] God will do those things but let's just
[1:25:56] get the Holy Ghost and believe what we
[1:25:59] do know and let's believe that with all
[1:26:01] of our hearts amen let's bow our heads
[1:26:03] if you play something there amen let's
[1:26:05] just I I just want to read this as they
[1:26:07] play something by faith Enoch was
[1:26:10] translated that he should not see death
[1:26:12] yes and was not found because God had
[1:26:14] translated him for before his
[1:26:18] translation he had this testimony that
[1:26:21] he pleased God
[1:26:22] God now I read
[1:26:25] that excuse me mean to be a baby but
[1:26:29] when I read that I thought can I have
[1:26:30] that testimony before I before I'm
[1:26:34] changed that I pleased
[1:26:36] God that's what I
[1:26:38] want it it my Works aren't going to save
[1:26:41] me but can I please God with what I'm
[1:26:45] doing can I please God by doing what his
[1:26:50] word
[1:26:51] said that's what I want tonight because
[1:26:54] I believe just like Enoch was translated
[1:26:56] we're going to be
[1:26:58] translated and I want my testimony to be
[1:27:01] I pleased God not by my
[1:27:04] works but by faith in the word of God
[1:27:08] and my Works Pro that I really had that
[1:27:10] Faith amen do you believe that tonight
[1:27:13] how many wants that testimony I want to
[1:27:14] please God I want more of
[1:27:18] you I believe a translation's about to
[1:27:21] happen let's just get ready for
[1:27:24] it he said without faith it is
[1:27:26] impossible to please him for he that
[1:27:29] cometh to God must believe that he is
[1:27:31] and that he is a rewarder of them that
[1:27:33] diligently seek Him by faith Noah by
[1:27:36] faith Daniel by faith Moses by faith
[1:27:40] Joshua by faith brother Brandon By Faith
[1:27:43] put put a name there but now I want you
[1:27:46] to put your name there by faith brother
[1:27:48] Bill by faith sister Karen by faith
[1:27:50] brother Logan by faith brother d David
[1:27:52] he's still with us when he was in the
[1:27:54] hospital and we thought he might not
[1:27:55] come out with Co but he's still here why
[1:27:57] somebody had faith and prayed for him
[1:27:59] there's testimonies all over the
[1:28:00] building sometimes we forget how good
[1:28:02] God's been to
[1:28:04] us sometimes we need to look up and say
[1:28:06] Lord thank you for the good things
[1:28:07] you've given
[1:28:08] me we've got more faith than we think
[1:28:10] we've got there's been Greater Works
[1:28:13] done than what you think's been done but
[1:28:15] I want I I I just want to please you
[1:28:17] Lord for what you've already done I'm
[1:28:18] not looking I'm not looking for more
[1:28:20] works for myself I'm not looking for for
[1:28:22] you to do more for me I just want to do
[1:28:25] more for you and that's the kind of son
[1:28:28] that a father wants to reward that's the
[1:28:31] kind of daughter that the father wants
[1:28:33] to look at and say you know I want to
[1:28:35] give you something special because you
[1:28:38] love me and you've put your faith in
[1:28:40] action you really believe me you've
[1:28:42] proved that you believe me why was
[1:28:44] Abraham
[1:28:45] tried because he wanted to he wanted to
[1:28:48] show us as an example that somebody
[1:28:50] could withstand a test
[1:28:52] of their faith amen if you bow your
[1:28:55] heads with me Heavenly Father you see
[1:28:57] the church here tonight if there's one
[1:28:59] in this building Lord that would say I
[1:29:02] I'm struggling to put my faith in action
[1:29:04] I'm struggling to just believe what a
[1:29:06] prophet said I'm struggling to to do
[1:29:08] what the word
[1:29:10] says Lord God I pray you would just
[1:29:12] anoint us with a special
[1:29:14] anointing to withstand the spirits that
[1:29:17] are coming against us in this day of
[1:29:18] intellectual faith and intellectual
[1:29:20] knowledge is trying to rep place of real
[1:29:22] heartfelt Faith but Lord restore unto me
[1:29:25] the joy of my salvation restore unto me
[1:29:27] the faith for a Rapture restore unto me
[1:29:30] the good things that you've already
[1:29:32] given me Lord restore to me a a belief
[1:29:34] that that what you've done what you've
[1:29:36] promised you're able to keep I pray you
