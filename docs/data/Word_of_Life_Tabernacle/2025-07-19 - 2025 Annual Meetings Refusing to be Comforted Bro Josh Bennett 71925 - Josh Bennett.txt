Well, my wife's married to me for over 30 years, and she still don't know. So, it's all right. Everything will be fine. Amen. Well, uh, this is an old Pentecostal song, but I really think it fits the message a lot better than it does, uh, the Pentecostals. So, uh, you pray for me.

Come on. We stay standing for a minute. Brother Wendle's going to get ready to sing for us uh uh in he's got to sing every service and at least at least a song. And so we appreciate brother Wendle. Do did you do you love Brother Wendle? &gt;&gt; Amen. What a message last night. What can we say about last night? It was over the top. No. Wonderful. And uh we appreciate Brother Wendle. He uh he he's just been such a blessing here at the church, hasn't he? Amen. I want to say this as brother Wendle's coming. Today is a very special day. I don't think our pastor come out here because he was scared I would do this. But today, Brother Ben turns 40 years old. &gt;&gt; 40 years old. And he may never come out now, but uh but he we love our pastor. We're very thankful for his burden of fellowship here in the area. Amen. I see these meetings every year and it's exactly what he told me when he when he come in here. He said, "I want to see unity and fellowship and and and I believe that it's just y'all y'all all have made that possible by coming and showing up and fellowshipping and and just putting everything else aside. &gt;&gt; But uh Amen. loving one another and and just coming to hear the word of the Lord. That's what we come to do. Amen. And our pastor has had that burden. And we're thankful for a man who carries that burden of the people and who loves every one of you. And and even though he's old now, &gt;&gt; man, he he stands here. And some some of y'all are sitting there thinking, "Are you sure he's only 40?" Was overseas and somebody thought he was my dad, [Applause] you know. He told one brother, he said, "No, I'm 30." I think he was 37, almost 37. We went over there and he said, "I'm 37." And they wanted to see his ID. They didn't believe him. And uh I'm not sure that's right either, but he's claiming 40 and and and holding on to that. So, as brother Wendle sings for us this morning, you can be seated for a moment. Amen. Give the Lord a big hand as you're seated. God bless you. Praise the Lord. Amen. When it was dark in my heart, you brought life to me. A child of darkness became a child of light. [Music] &gt;&gt; When my soul was so dry, &gt;&gt; you and I needed drink. The waters of life you became to me. [Music] I am. I am. You gave to me. I am alpha. I am Omega. The in between. I am. I am. You said to me, I'll be what it takes to meet your need. [Music] &gt;&gt; You were the widow's cruise of oil. and oh Elijah's me. You were the shelter for Noah. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; A shepherd for the sheep and in the fire. You were the fourth man [Music] &gt;&gt; and a cloud by day. A fire by night for your children to lead the way. I am I am. You said to me I am Alpha. I am Omega. The in between. I am my arm. You said to me, I'll be what it takes to meet your need. [Music] I am. I am. You said to me, I am the bread of life standing. I am. I am. You said to me, I'll be what it takes to meet your need. I'll even go the way to Calary. [Music] Aren't you glad for that? Glory to God. Hallelujah. Thank you, man. Give the Lord another big hand. You can feel my cup, Lord. Feel my cup of tea. And we'll stand together. I'm going to turn it over to our pastor. And let's just sing this with all of our hearts now. Fill my cup. [Music] I love [Music] come and praise this thirsty my soul [Music] bread of heaven. Won't [Music] you fear? I want you [Music] and make me. Let's sing it like this now. Here's my cup, Lord.

I want [Music] my God. Fill it up and make me Let me get ready for the word this morning. I want to thank you for being here and being a part of the meetings. I recognized some people last night, but if I've missed you, I'm I'm sorry. One of the people I did miss was Brother Josh Bennett and his wife uh and his sons with us this weekend. Aren't you glad that Brother Josh was able to be with us? We're so happy to have them. such a privilege to have him. And we've been, my church has been telling me for a while, our church here has been telling me, "You've got to get Brother Josh out to preach." And &gt;&gt; I went to True Word Camp last year, and while we were there, uh, he preached a sermon out there that I think everybody ought to hear, young person and old, and it was just a marvelous, marvelous message. And after that service, I asked him to come and preach these meetings. So, he'd been scheduled for about a year just for this service this morning. So, it's just such a special treat to have brother Josh Bennett with us from North Carolina and we're just going to give him his liberty today. Let the word speak to us. We've got all day, &gt;&gt; so we might as well have church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you got a need today, I believe that need can be met. &gt;&gt; I had a brother testify to me last night. He said while the word was going forth Thursday night, he said he he said, "I I've dealt with depression for two and a half years." And he said during the service, he said, "I felt that lift and it's gone." &gt;&gt; He's still God. He can do that this morning. &gt;&gt; You don't have to live with that. &gt;&gt; He can do that for you. &gt;&gt; I uh my goodness, we're just looking forward to a good day in the Lord. If you need anything while you're here with us fellowshipping, uh, just ask me or brother Joel or one of the deacons. We'll be glad to help you any way that we can. I know some have to go home after this morning's service. Some more will maybe be coming in, but we're glad to have each and every one of you. Thank you pastors that have supported us. As brother Josh comes, could we sing that? Thank you, Jesus, for the grace that you've given us. Let's sing that. I want to say thank you Jesus. [Music] Oh my for the grace that you have given us. [Music] Though I can't repay from my heart. I'd like to say that I Oh, thank you. Could you lift your hands to him and sing it now? I want to say thank you. Oh, yes, Lord Jesus. Oh, for the grace that you have given us. Thank you, Lord. Although I can't repay from my heart, I'd like to say that I [Music] [Music] Jesus, [Music] what the gra [Music] from my heart like to say I thank you. Amen. How many believes he's worthy? Amen. I tell you, uh, we ought to be a thankful people. Amen. It's just good to be here and, you know, we're honored to be a part of these meetings and, uh, we sure, uh, love and appreciate. I look out and see uh uh some faces I maybe don't know, but I I see a lot of u good friends and old friends. And I was just thinking u um first time I come out here and preached in uh here at the church, I felt like a kid. I guess I probably was, but um you know and here we are all these years later and and uh so many things have happened through the years and but you know we're still here and God's still God and &gt;&gt; Amen. And and I tell you such a a comfort in our hearts to know that you know through all the storms &gt;&gt; he's never left us. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'm so thankful for that. But we appreciate Brother Ben. And today being his birthday, I I I just say uh you know, want to wish him a happy birthday. And u and he's catching up with me. So I mean, you know how old he is and I'm older than him, so we're getting old. But uh we um we sure appreciate him and his wife and the hospitality. And it is good to have my wife with me and I sure appreciate her coming. Amen. But we'll just get right into the word. You forgive me. I'm not very good at the formalities. Um but we uh we do love you. Amen. Maybe we could just bow our hearts together just before we look into the word. Lord Jesus, we just thank you for another opportunity that you've given us. And Lord, the services that we've had so far and the brothers that have ministered and Lord, the word that we have heard. Lord, it's just been tremendous. And Lord, there's a power in that word. Lord, I believe that even this morning, if we're hungry, the word is bread. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; God, I if we're sick, Lord, you said you sent your word and healed the people. &gt;&gt; Lord, if if there's somebody in bondage, your word is like a hammer. Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord, it can break the chains. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; Lord, I I believe that if we're in battle, and truly we're in a great spiritual warfare, but your word is a sword. So God, we know that Lord, whatever we have need of is in the word of God. And so Lord, as we take and we open the pages of this Bible, Lord, as the prophet said, anybody that has the ability to read can read the words, but Lord, we want the author of the book to come. Lord, we're inviting you just to come and Lord, you take and break the scriptures to us. And Lord, maybe we could have an experience here today like they had with you on the road as they was walking. And Lord, their hearts were troubled. And &gt;&gt; Lord, there they were slow of heart. But Lord, you Lord appeared to them and begin to walk with them. And Lord, you begin to open up the scriptures. Lord, reveal yourself through the word. And Lord, about the evening time, they constrained you to come in. And then you begin to break the bread. And oh God, their eyes were open and they knew you. And Lord, I pray God that that would happen here in this service even, God, that the word would be opened up to us. And Lord, that you would just come and do something like you did, Lord, before and we'd know you, Lord. And Lord, at the breaking of the bread. So Lord, we invite you to do that now. And Lord Jesus, we'll give you all the glory and the honor. And Lord, we thank you for all things in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen. If you turn with me uh this morning to the book of Jeremiah, I'd like to read from Jeremiah chapter 31. And I'm going to read from the 15th verse, a few verses there. And then also I'd like to read from um the book of Matthew in the second chapter of Matthew. and just a a simple thought, but um it's just uh what the Lord had laid upon our heart and I trust that it'll be a blessing to you. Um we um you know, God hides himself in simplicity and &gt;&gt; and uh he also reveals himself in the same. So I mean we're so thankful for that. Jeremiah 31:15. Thus sayeth the Lord, a voice was heard in Rama, lamentation and bitter weeping. Rachel weeping for her children. Refuse to be comforted for her children because they were not. And thus saith the Lord, refrain thy voice from weeping, and thine eyes from tears. For thy work shall be rewarded, saith the Lord, and they shall come again from the land of the enemy. There is hope in thine end, saith the Lord, that thy children shall come again, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, &gt;&gt; to their own border. In the book of Matthew in the second chapter, Matthew chapter 2 and verse 16, this is um a scripture around the birth of Christ. And we're actually going to see a fulfillment of the prophecy of Jeremiah here in Matthew chapter 2 verse 16. The Bible says, "Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was exceeding wroth, and is and sent forth and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently inquired of the wise men." Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet saying in Rama was there a voice heard lamentation and weeping and great mourning. Rachel weeping for her children and would not be comforted because they are not. &gt;&gt; Amen. As the Lord would just add his blessings, you can be seated. I'd like to take from these scriptures this morning and speak to you just for a few minutes on refusing to be comforted. &gt;&gt; And uh we see here in in the scripture the Bible speaking of uh Rachel weeping for her children. And of course um uh she this is u speaking of uh of you know an old testament uh a lady of the old testament which actually in the book of Ruth in Ruth chapter 4 uh the Bible says that all the people that were in the gate and the elders said that we are witnesses that the Lord make the woman that has come into thine house speaking of Ruth like uh Rachel and Leah, which two did build uh the house of Israel. Amen. And so the Bible actually attributes to Rachel and Leah uh uh that they actually built the house of Israel because we know that they were the mothers of of of the patriarchs. They were, you know, it was by their womb. And so, you know, and the scriptur is talking about how that Rachel uh refused to be comforted. And uh I'd like to just start by saying that as I looked, you know, of course that is speaking of of Rachel's own desire to have children &gt;&gt; and she was a barren woman and she had a desire to bring forth life &gt;&gt; and and and and speaking of that desire, but but as I was looking at the some of the meanings and the definitions of uh uh uh you know how you do when you start digging into the scripture, you want to find out, you know, what it actually means. Sure. &gt;&gt; And uh as I I found this u in in in a commentary and I hope it's all right to use it because I would like to uh build off of this, but it says that she refused to be comforted for her children because they were not. And and in like a passionate woman, she refused all arguments of comfort of comfort. In other words, she refused all arguments. In other words, I I maybe just put it like this that I believe actually she refused to be comforted by any argument. In other words, any you couldn't go and tell Rachel, well, you know, you just got to be satisfied the way things are. &gt;&gt; Or, you know, you're really not the woman. You're not you're you know, God will fulfill this through Leah or God will fulfill this through somebody else. Amen. And you just got to be satisfied. This is your portion. And you know, God has chose you for something else. Amen. But you see, Rachel refused any argument to bring comfort to her. Amen. Because she said, "I've got to have a child." &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible says in Genesis 30:1, "And when Rachel saw that she ha have she had bare Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister and said unto Jacob, give me children or else I die." &gt;&gt; Think about that. She said, "Give me children or else I die." Yeah. &gt;&gt; And Jacob's an anger was kindled against Rachel and said, "Am I in God'sstead who has withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?" And God remembered in verse 22 of the same chapter, "And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened unto her, and opened her womb, and she conceived and bare a son, and and said, God had taken away my reproach." And she called his name Joseph and said, "The Lord shall add to me another son." Amen. You see in this scripture, it was a desperation to bring forth life. Amen. And there's all kind of examples of this in the Bible. You see it in Sarah. You see it in Rebecca. You'll see it in Rachel. You see it in Tamar. And Amen. Even, you know, we know the story of Tamar and how that her her husband died before she was given seed. And and then, you know, according to the law, Amen. uh uh uh you know her father-in-law would give her another son and her her husband's brother would raise up seed in his place but we know how the story went to the place that you know even her father-in-law refused to give his last son to her. Amen. Because they kept on dying. Amen. But but you know uh she played a part of a harlot. But Amen. And think about what she done and and the actions that she done no doubt was if you look at it it's just wrong. But but the motive that she had was right. Amen. And the point of the thing is at the end of the story, the testimony was this. Even Judah said, "You're more righteous than I." Amen. Why? Because there was something in here. Listen friend, she wasn't after pleasure. Amen. She was wanting to bring forth life. Amen. She, Amen, was desiring. Amen. That she would have seen that she would bring forth something. Amen. Amen. She was going to bring forth life. And it was desperation. You see it, Amen. Again, in Hannah. Amen. Think about the story of Hannah in the Bible and how that you know there she was in a time that the that the that the tabernacle was being polluted and you know the ministry was failing and amen there was all kind of problems in the church but it was in that kind of a time. Amen. And Israel was in that kind of condition but there was a little woman. Amen. And she had a barren womb but she had a desire that she wanted to have a son. Amen. And listen friend her desire becomes so great. Amen. that she amen went to the temple. Amen. And she and she be to call on God to such a place that they thought she was drunk. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the kind of desire that Hannah had. Amen. And she be to pray in her desperation. Amen. Her prayer reached to God. Amen. And God remembered her. &gt;&gt; Is that right? Amen. You see what it is? Amen. She the these women in the scripture, Amen. They had a desire to bring forth. They they they wanted to have children. How you know because at the time when the Bible was written, Amen, it was actually a reproach unto a woman, amen, to not have a child. &gt;&gt; Amen. How different it is today. You know, it it's almost the complete opposite because Amen. You know, now it would be a reproach for a woman to have a child almost. And even brother Brandham talks about that in the invisible union. You know, he said today if you notice Jesus spoke of it and he goes to the scripture of Luke. Amen. in Luke 23 and he says, "And there followed him a great company of of people and women which also bewailed and lamented him. But but Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children. For behold, the days are coming that they will say, "Blessed are the barren and the womb that never bear and the paps that never gave suck." Just think of it today. Amen. The prophet said, "It's a degra, it's a disgrace for a woman to have a child." See, then they begin to say to the mountains, "Fall on us and the hills to cover us for for I if they do these things in a green tree, what shall they do in the dry?" Amen. Speaking of a day that would come when a woman wouldn't want to have children. &gt;&gt; See, they they'll take a dog or a cat, and I better just stop there and say, "Listen, hey, Amen. I ain't preaching against you dogs and cats. We all love animals, right?" Amen. Praise God. The prophet of God is saying, "Amen. Don't use that as a substitute." &gt;&gt; That's what he was against. Amen. Is a is a is a woman. Amen. That God put in her. Amen. To mother. Amen. To be a mother. Amen. But she's trying to substitute that. Amen. With something else. Amen. He'll go on to tell you why. They don't want to mess up their bodies. And they don't want to Amen. They They don't want to bear the reproach of that. Amen. Well, I might as well just say it. He was pointing all this out. Amen. To show you a spiritual condition of the church because a woman represents a church. Amen. And he was showing you. Amen. Listen. Amen. The these women of today, these modern w they've got their careers and they got their Amen. They don't want to mess up their bodies and they don't want no screaming snot young and hanging around. Amen. Because you know it's such a trouble to them. Amen. And he's saying that's the condition the same condition of the church. He said the church don't want none of them Acts 2:38 tongue talking, screaming, hollering youngans. Amen. But I'll tell you what he said. He said, "But that's the only kind that the word can produce." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh. Amen. You see the condition of the time that we're living in. Amen. But I want to say just as sure, Amen. As there was a Rachel in the Bible that refused to be comforted. Amen. She had the attitude, "Give me a son or else I die." Amen. There's got to be a bride somewhere that's got that same kind of testimony. Amen. We going to have life or we're going to die. Amen. We're going to have reality or we're going to listen. We ain't interested in religion. Amen. We are not interested in who can preach the best and who's got the biggest church and amen and all that kind of stuff. Amen. We want life. Amen. Give me life or else I die. Hallelujah. I believe there's still a bride somewhere that says, "Hey, we want real conversions in our church." We want a church, amen, with the reality of Christ that young people can still be saved. Amen. That lives can still be changed, that people can still be filled with the Holy Ghost. Listen church, I want to tell you, let's don't never get to a place, Amen, that we get to where, like the prophet of God said, Amen, that that there was a place in the church that they come to a spot that the only point, amen, of argument that they had was to debate doctrine &gt;&gt; and fuss over scripture and and try to figure out who was right and wrong. Listen, God never intended for his church to be that. We are not here to debate scripture and argue about quotes. We're here to be a living manifestation of the word of God. Come on, church. That, Amen, is an argument that will convince a sinner. Not how well you know the Bible, but how well the Bible lives in you. When they see something that's real, &gt;&gt; brother, that's what I want. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to be like Rachel and say, "Hey, give me life or else I die. &gt;&gt; I want something real. I want reality. Yes sir. The &gt;&gt; Bible even talks about Hannah how that the scripture says she was in bitterness of soul. She prayed to the Lord and wept sore. Amen. Brother Brown said in desperation he said we find out in James 5 the Bible said the effectual fervent prayer. &gt;&gt; See &gt;&gt; amen. It's desperation. The fervent prayer of a righteous man avaleth much. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And when a righteous man, a good man gets in travail. &gt;&gt; Amen. When you get in travail, &gt;&gt; Amen. In John 16, the Bible speaks in John 16:20, "Verily, verily, I say unto you that you shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice, and ye shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. A woman when she is in travail has sorrow because her hour is come. But as soon as she is delivered of the child, &gt;&gt; she rememberth no more the anguish for the joy that a man is born into the world. &gt;&gt; And you now therefore have sorrow, &gt;&gt; but I will see you again, &gt;&gt; and your heart shall rejoice, &gt;&gt; and your joy no man taketh from you. Friends, I want to tell you, I'd rather I'd rather be on that side of the scripture. &gt;&gt; Amen. In other words, listen, a lot of us, even right now, Amen. We're going through travail. We're going through sorry, you're going through hard times. Amen. I'll just say this. I believe I could probably say it this way. Amen. Of everybody that's in this building this morning. Amen. You're either in a trial or you just come out of one or you're getting ready to go into one. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because that's just where we're living at. This is Amen. That's Amen. in this life. Amen. We have trouble and it's actually promised us in the scripture to be that way. But we also have a promise, amen, that weeping endure for a night, but joy comes in the morning. And right now, you'll have sorrow, amen, but your sorrow is going to be turned into joy. And sometimes you get to feeling sorry for yourself and you look around and it seems like everybody else has got it good and and they're just getting by and everything's going good and you look at them and almost with envy. But I want to tell you, there's people on this earth today that are living their best life right now. And their best times is right now. But I want to tell you friends, amen, our best days, Amen. are not behind us. Amen. They're in front of us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And we may have sorrow this morning. Amen. But I tell you what, we may weep, but we shall rejoice &gt;&gt; cuz our sorrow be turned into joy. And &gt;&gt; as Jesus is preaching this, he goes straight to a woman in travail. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because you know that word in the Greek, it actually means to bring forth or to be delivered. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; To bear, to produce the fruit of the seed. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; A woman giving birth. And you know if you look at it in the English and the definition of the English word it means a painful labor. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; So the travail is a painful labor. &gt;&gt; I'll just say you know there's always pain to bring forth. How many knows that even the scripture says in Genesis 3:16 after the fall, he said unto the woman, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow &gt;&gt; and thy conception and in sorrow shall thou bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee. Amen. God is speaking to the woman that actually prophesying that that her sorrow will be multiplied. See, &gt;&gt; Amen. and in sorrow she would bring forth. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll say this, every birth, Amen. It is there's pain that goes along with it. &gt;&gt; I mean, know and brother Benham would would always type the natural birth with the spiritual birth. &gt;&gt; Amen. And a new birth comes under travail. &gt;&gt; See, that's what's wrong with our our modern, you know, Christianity. They want a Christianity with no suffering. Come on. Come on. &gt;&gt; People want authority and and they actually, you know, they would love to have even character as a gift &gt;&gt; and not a victory. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and people like to, you know, they've even made it. Amen. You know, a substitute of the new birth. Amen. by joining a church and &gt;&gt; just putting your name on a book and amen, you know, just coming up to an altar and repeating a sinner's prayer and amen and all those kind of things. And well, you know, you make a decision for Christ and you just walk down to an altar repeating the sinner's prayer, you're saved for all time and eternity. Come on. All right. &gt;&gt; You see, friends, and and and you know, a lot of us sitting here today would say, "Yeah, hey, that's Baptist uh that's Baptist theology and that's Billy Graham's idea and that's, you know, and we're putting it off on somebody." But I wonder sometimes if we haven't adopted some of the same ideas. Amen. And we got the thought that, you know, just believe God sent a prophet and you going to heaven and you just go to a message church and you going straight in the rapture. Church, I want to tell you that is a that is a deception. Amen. Because I can hear a prophet say, "This rapture is only for the Holy Ghost filled." And Jesus Christ said, "You must be born again." &gt;&gt; Even said, he said, "Here's the old sawdust trail." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; The mourner's bench down here for you. &gt;&gt; Stay here and moan and groan under labor pains &gt;&gt; until God comes down and fills you with the Holy Ghost. Amen. &gt;&gt; We all know the Bible teaches a new birth. And they've substituted handshakes and everything else for the new birth, but it'll never take the place of a new birth. &gt;&gt; It's got to be an experience, a born again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How many believes in a born again experience? &gt;&gt; Amen. It's got to be an experience, a born again. We all know that any kind of birth is a mess. When a baby's born, if it's on a floor, if it's in a shuck pile or in a pink decorated hospital room, it's a mess, &gt;&gt; but it brings life. &gt;&gt; And that's what a new birth is. It's a mess, but it brings life. It ain't a style or a put on or a declaration of creeds. It's the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And that's the secret of the real believing church born again. Oh, I know you get up from the altar crying and boohooing and squealing and slobbering, but it brings life. It'll take the starch out of you. It'll make something that Amen. It'll make you something that you ought to be. It takes all the world and the stiff neck out of you. And today, we like to just walk up and say, "I take Jesus as my personal savior." That'll never take the place of a new birth. When a men when men and women come to an altar and forget, amen, where they are and who's around them until they really die out and are born again. Amen. We need to get back to the all night prayer meetings. the power of the Holy Ghost back in the church again. That's what we need today is a good old-fashioned St. Paul revival. Amen. And the Bible and the Holy Ghost preach back in power. That's &gt;&gt; how many believe that's true. &gt;&gt; Say, "Oh, Brother Josh, this is a this is a special meeting on a Saturday morning. Why you preach something like this? Ain't no better time to preach it." &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, hey, we got visitors around here. We don't, you know, we we don't know people getting the wrong idea about us. I just believe it this way, friends. If you got truth, you ought to proclaim it. &gt;&gt; We I I feel I just feel inspired to say something right now. Amen. I believe that the devil has got some of us preachers at a place that we're almost ashamed of the message we believe. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. If we believe this message is the answer and it's got raptured faith in it, we ought to stand on the highest mountain. Amen. And proclaim it. Amen. We ought to do it on our jobs. You ought to do it in the school. Amen. Because it is the answer. It's Jesus Christ. The same yesterday, today, and forever. And I tell you this, amen. My heart is to help people. And I believe that I serve a God that can take a prostitute and make a saint out of her. That can take a drunkard. Amen. and make a a saint out of it that can deliver. Amen. A amen a drug addict. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I believe that. &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe that what God done for me, he can do for somebody else. And it's because I believe it that way that I preach it this way. Amen. Listen friends. You ain't got to accept a substitute. Why will we Amen. accepts a substitute when the sky is full of the real. If you want the Holy Ghost, you can have it this morning. If you want a real experience with God, you can have it. You can have it in these meetings. Amen. If you ain't born again, Amen. You ain't got to leave that way. If you know you ain't got the Holy Ghost, you ain't got to leave that way. Hallelujah. You can walk out of this service with a testimony. I know that. I know that. I know. Hallelujah. Amen. He didn't just save me. He filled me. And he lives in me. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Listen, friends will probably say, "We're not playing church." &gt;&gt; Christ is a church &gt;&gt; and and we are in Christ. &gt;&gt; And the mystical body of Christ, we're born into it. &gt;&gt; You can't join it. &gt;&gt; Come on. You can't join it. You got to be born into it. &gt;&gt; That's right. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "I've been I've been in the with the Brandham family for almost 55 years, and they never did ask me to join. &gt;&gt; I was born a Brandon." &gt;&gt; And that's the way you're a Christian. You're born a Christian. &gt;&gt; Not joined into it. You're born into it. &gt;&gt; And everybody is afraid of the birth. They got some nice clean way of taking a little hand and signing a little card or or a salt shake with some water in it. I don't even know what that is. But Amen. Amen. That's not a birth. A birth is a horrid thing. A birth is an awful thing. Amen. You don't want to give up. You don't want to do this. You don't want to do the other. Amen. But the tears, Amen, will wash that paint right off your face and make you a different person. If you're born again, it'll make a mess out of you. Amen. But when you'll come forth a new creature. Amen. They don't want that. They want some easy way. Amen. But there ain't no easy way. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; There ain't no easy. There ain't no substitute. &gt;&gt; Friends, this is exactly where we're at. Amen. They want a Christianity with no repentance. &gt;&gt; Amen. They want an altar with flowers instead of blood. &gt;&gt; Amen. They want to serve God without sacrifice. Amen. But I want to tell you something, friends. Amen. There ain't no easy way. Amen. And I I'll just say it as much as I can say it this morning. Amen. The God of the Bible is still the same God and he still requires the same thing. We heard it last night. Amen. Listen, Abel had to climb up and die on the same altar that his lamb did. And if you ever going to get where anywhere with God, you're going to have to do the same thing. You're going to have to get on the same cross. Hallelujah. Amen. You got your cross, too. And Jesus had to die as a sacrifice. But friends, we got to die to ourselves. [Applause] &gt;&gt; That we might be born again. &gt;&gt; There's no birth without travail. &gt;&gt; The earth is in travail. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; How many knows that's true? &gt;&gt; Brother said in the sixth seal, he said, "Look at it. Not only here but the world over the thing is polluted. &gt;&gt; Nature. Amen. He said the whole world is in birth pains. &gt;&gt; The world is trying. She's travailing. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; She's trying to bring forth a new world for a millennium. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; man. Is is that right? She said, brother R says she's in birth pains. &gt;&gt; How many remembers prophet talking about Israel in her birth pains? He said as she would get away from God, God has sent her a prophet. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he said that prophet would shake her into a birth pain. &gt;&gt; And that birth pain would shake her back to the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the prophet of God, Amen. It shows us that the world has been in birth pains. &gt;&gt; Amen. In the New Testament church, Amen. You see a birth pain under Martin Luther. There was a birth pain under John Wesley. There was a birth pain in 1906 Pentecost. And listen, God sent us a prophet in this last day. Amen. as a as a birth pain to shake us back to the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. He talks about how the whole earth is travailing. Paul would talk about it in Romans 8. &gt;&gt; Amen. Romans 8:22. For we know that the whole creation groanth and travaleth in pain together unto now. And not only they, but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit, even we ourselves grown within ourselves, waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of our body. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. What is Paul saying? That there's a groaning that is going on within a believer. &gt;&gt; I'll just say this, friends. If you're comfortable in this world, there's something wrong with your testimony. &gt;&gt; There's not a groan or a travail in your soul, not a cry in your in your heart that says, "Even so, come Lord Jesus. You need to come to you need to find an altar." &gt;&gt; I tell you what the problem is is we've Amen. We we've been we we're we're being rocked asleep with a lullabi of Satan &gt;&gt; in this leodysian age and and sin has been so presented to us. Amen. Until Amen. You know the Bible even talks about over in Daniel 7. Amen. That that that it talks about and I'm not trying to misuse scripture so don't misunderstand but I'm just giving you an example that the scripture says that that that that that one that would rise up that little horn will wear out the saints or wear down the saints. Amen. you just actually wear them out. Amen. And it's just a constant. Amen. Uh you know, when something wears you out, it's just something that's just constant, always just coming at you. And it just it just wears you down. And amen. Listen, that's the world you're living in. You can't even pump gas at a gas station. Amen. Without seeing amen a projection of Hollywood and the spirits, Amen. You can't go to Walmart. You can't go anywhere. Amen. Without sin being pressed and pushed on you. You know what the devil's trying to do? He's trying to put it in front of you so much that you'll get numb to it. &gt;&gt; You just get numb to it. You've seen it so much that it don't bother you no more cuz it's just all the time. I tell you what I think we ought to do. We ought to turn it on the devil and say, "Devil, the more I see it, the more I hate it. And the more you put it in front of me, the stronger my desire gets to get out of here. The only thing you're doing is making me more desperate. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. The whole creation is groaning and we ourselves. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Prophet said, "Oh, do you see it? &gt;&gt; All creation is grown." And Paul said, "Everything is growing. Look at these trees, how they struggle. &gt;&gt; Look at the flowers, how they struggle for life." Amen. Just Amen. for the frost to tear them down. Look at the trees. They struggle to hold their branches out a and sing the glories unto God. Amen. Everything, all nature, all animals, the birds. Amen. How he flies. Oh my. Everything is groaning. Amen. And we ourselves, Paul said, we grown too &gt;&gt; with them. &gt;&gt; For we're waiting on the redemption of our body. &gt;&gt; But now, Amen. They they did all those years until now. But now we have the earnest &gt;&gt; of our inheritance. &gt;&gt; Oh my. What do we have? We have the evidence that God lives. We have the evidence that God is with us. We have the evidence that God has not forsaken us. Amen. We are his and he is ours. Amen. Because in our bodies, we tabernacle the Holy Spirit of God that cries out, "Aba, Father, and there's nothing that can ever take away." Amen. We've anchored in Christ. The trees don't have it. Nature doesn't have it. Amen. But yet, it's still groaning. Amen. With the Amen. But because Amen. uh they haven't yet received the fullness because we haven't rather received the fullness of our adoption. Amen. But we have the earnest. &gt;&gt; Oh, I love that quote right there because the prophet of God said that tree out there is struggling and groaning. Amen. For the manifestation of the sons of God and it's doing it without the earnest. &gt;&gt; Come on, friends. The birds and all creation are groaning and they ain't got the Holy Ghost. I want to tell you something. If there's a tree out there that's trying to hold on to its leaves just so that it can praise God a little bit longer. If there's a bird that lives in this wicked world. Come on, friends. Don't you You can't tell me it's easy on nature right now. This is the hardest time that animal life has ever lived in. &gt;&gt; And their homes are being destroyed and amen. And their nests are being destroyed. Amen. They're constantly having to move and and deal with pollution and air pollution. But you know what? They get up just the same and sing the praises of God. Oh, come on, church. And if they can do that without the Holy Ghost, what about the Holy Ghost fil of God? Oh, everything might not be going your way, but what difference does that make? I got the earnest, amen, of the expectation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I say this, if a bird can sing, Amen. I believe I can, too. And if a tree will hold on to its leaves just so it can praise God a little bit longer. Amen. I amen will not forsake. Amen. To come to the house of God and give him praise. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because there's something groaning within. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Good preaching. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We're waiting on the fullness of our adoption. Glory. &gt;&gt; The fullness of our adoption. How many knows that's the change of your body? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The prophet said, "Oh, don't that make us old folks feel good?" &gt;&gt; Don't that make y'all Don't that make y'all Don't that make you old folks feel good? Hey, I'm telling you, I'm trying to hold on to as long as I can, brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. But he goes on to say, "It ought to make us all feel good." &gt;&gt; I tell you what, if you ain't old, just live a little while. You're going to get there. &gt;&gt; That's all you got to do is just keep on living. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you're going to get there. &gt;&gt; And you're going to start understanding what it's all about. Amen. But but the prophet of God said, "Don't that make you feel good?" It ought to make us all feel good waiting for this hour. We understand that this will take place at the first resurrection sea. Nature is groaning. We are groaning. Everything is groaning because we realize that there's something that's not right. And the only way that you can groan and wait for it is because there's been a new life come in here that speaks of a new world. Hallelujah. Why are you groaning this morning? Amen. Because there's something on the inside of you. Amen. That's crying. Amen. &gt;&gt; A burning desire in your soul. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, look at the travail that that Israel was under. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. at the time of the birth of Christ. You got to remember, brother Brown will talk about how that he said in birth pains all down through the ages, every prophet that come to Israel would throw into a birth pain. &gt;&gt; He said until she was finally delivered. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Of a manchild. &gt;&gt; He said the word made flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. And if you want to see a picture of that in Ro or in Revelations 12, the Bible says, "And there appeared a great wonder in heaven, a woman &gt;&gt; clothed with the sun, and the moon was under her feet, and upon her head was a crown of 12 stars, and she being with child cried travailing in birth and pain to be delivered." &gt;&gt; And there appeared another wonder in heaven. And behold, a great red dragon having seven heads and 10 horns, and seven crowns upon his head, and and his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and then cast him to the earth. And the dragon stood before the woman, which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as he was born. And she brought forth a manchild, who was to rule all the nations with a rod of iron, and her child was caught up unto God into his throne. &gt;&gt; If you want to know what that means, listen to what the prophet said. That was the Orthodox church standing there. The sun shining down. The doctrine of the apostles, the twel apostles. The moon was under her feet. The law and the shadow of things to come. The gospel light that's shining now. The law has faded away where the sun has come out. She was pained to be delivered. And she brought forth a manchild which was Christ Jesus and he was caught up to God. But but here it is. As soon as a dragon, amen, saw the woman ready to be delivered, he stood right there to devour his the child as soon as it was born. And when Jesus was born, the Roman emperor issued a proclamation to kill all the children from two years old and and down. Amen. He was trying to kill Christ Jesus, &gt;&gt; but God pulled the wool over his eyes &gt;&gt; and took him down in Egypt and hid him at Just like he did with Moses the same way. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Another place, Brother Brown said, "There's that red dragon. The devil, where's his seat at?" Not in Russia, in Rome. Amen. And the devil gave him his seed and his authority. Amen. Listen. And he goes on to say, "And the red dragon, amen, stood there before that woman. And as soon as a woman's delivered of the child, amen, he was there to devour that child as soon as it was brought forth." Amen. Now, amen. He said that was a Israelite church. Amen. And there the red dragon to devour her child which was Jesus as soon as he was born. Amen. Herod issued the proclamation. Amen. To kill all the children. The very things that same thing that Pharaoh done to catch Moses which was a type of Christ and slaughtered all the children. Amen. But they missed him &gt;&gt; because God knows how to hide them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said, "Oh, aren't you Aren't you glad you're hid? Oh, there's a hiding place. Amen. The Bible said, Amen, that we are dead and and and our lives are hidden God in Christ. Amen. The prophet of God said, Amen, that that's exactly what Herod was trying to do was the same thing Pharaoh was trying to do was to kill that seed, to stop the promise. &gt;&gt; But God knows how to hide his seed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. And God hid Moses. Amen. And God hid Jesus Christ. Is that right? And he said, "And you are here, too." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You are here, too. Listen, friends. What is this whole battle about? Satan's trying to stop the seed. &gt;&gt; But God knows how to hide his seed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I tell you what, there's still a hiding place today in Psalms 27. The Lord is my light and my salvation. Whom shall I fear? The Lord is the strength of my life. Of whom shall I be afraid? When the wicked, even mine enemies, and my foes come to eat of my flesh, they stumbled and fail. And though a host should encamp against me, and this, amen, my heart shall not fear, the war should rise against me. And this will I be confident. One thing have I desired of the Lord, that I will seek after, that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life. Hallelujah. For in a time of trouble, &gt;&gt; he shall hide me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He shall set me upon a rock. Listen friends, how many knows that's the background for the rapture according to the message of the hour. And we're living in a time of trouble. And Satan is trying to stop the promise. But I want to tell the devil this morning. You come too late. Amen. And God has done hid the seed. And there's a secret place. The prophet said the devil couldn't get to you if he wanted to. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; I I I'll just say this. &gt;&gt; You know, &gt;&gt; Christ was not born in a time of convenience. &gt;&gt; All right. That's true. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; And the circumstances were not, &gt;&gt; you know, think about it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. When Jesus Christ come to this earth, when when he was born, &gt;&gt; Rome was in power. &gt;&gt; Sure was. &gt;&gt; The people of God were in in a in a &gt;&gt; in captivity in a form of it, at least in &gt;&gt; under Roman rule. That's right. &gt;&gt; And and and there was trouble everywhere. &gt;&gt; And actually, even at the time when it got real close for him to be born, they they they taxed the whole Right. &gt;&gt; I mean, Caesar taxed the whole earth. &gt;&gt; Sure did. &gt;&gt; He sure did. &gt;&gt; You know, he done all that. I thought about that before. I thought, man, all them poor people having to pay taxes and travel and &gt;&gt; all the in inconvenience. I mean, it wasn't just Joseph and Mary that was being inconvenient. Everybody was being inconven. And all that was happening just so that the prophecy &gt;&gt; could be fulfilled &gt;&gt; because he had to be born in Bethlehem. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; And all this trouble and unrest and Amen. bad circumstances and everything. Amen. And here is Mary. Amen. Riding up on her camp on her on her donkey rather. Amen. And she's heavy with child on a great journey. By the way, brother Brown said here she was heavy with child on a great journey. And I got to thinking about that and I thought, think about that. Here we are. Amen. Listen friends. This ain't the most convenient time to be a Christian. &gt;&gt; This is not the most convenient time to live holiness. This ain't the most convenient time to believe what you believe. Amen. This ain't the most convenient time for there to be a rapture. Amen. For God to have a bride. Amen. But do you realize, friends, that all this was done that the word of God might be fulfilled. Amen. Listen, all the stuff you see around you. Amen. In the condition of the age that you live in ain't nothing but prophecy being fulfilled. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. And it ain't a convenient time. And here we are heavy with child and great burdens on our life and we're on a great journey. But church, I want to encourage you. We're on our way down to Bethlehem. Even our hour of deliverance is near. Come on, church. This ain't the time to give up. This ain't the time to look back. This ain't the time to give in. This ain't the time to compromise. I tell you what we need to do. Travail. Press on. Refuse to be comforted. Hallelujah. Let us be like Rachel this morning. Amen. And say, "I will not accept any argument." &gt;&gt; Come on. I I I'm just going to preach right here for a little while. Amen. I'm telling you. Amen. We got to come to a place as a bride of Jesus Christ that we quit letting people explain it away from us or put it down the road or point back to a time go in the past or sometime in the future. Listen, you got to start believing. We are the bride. &gt;&gt; We are that church. We are, Amen. the the bride of the last days that will bring forth Jesus Christ on the earth again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You're the overcomer of this age. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I ain't going to listen to no argument against you. Don't come tell me, Amen, that Mark 16 ain't for me. Don't come tell me that St. John 14:12 is not for me. No sir. Amen. Don't tell me. Amen. That's only for the apostles or that was just for one man or that was just for brother Brandham and we can't have it. Listen, I refuse to be comforted. I refuse to accept any argument. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's our promise. Amen. &gt;&gt; I refuse to believe, amen, that we can't have young people that can overcome in this age. &gt;&gt; I refuse to believe, amen, that we can't have a church that's full, amen, of the life of Jesus Christ. I refuse, amen, to believe &gt;&gt; that the God of this message is not still the same, amen, the same today. &gt;&gt; That's right. Good preaching. &gt;&gt; I I won't accept any argument. &gt;&gt; No sir. &gt;&gt; No sir. &gt;&gt; No sir. &gt;&gt; Good preaching. &gt;&gt; Brother Brother Windle read this quote last night. I was actually praying and I I'd asked the Lord, you know, hey, you you come to meetings and things and sometimes you have a lot of things you'd like to preach. And &gt;&gt; that was where I was at. You know, just so many things and you're trying to go through this thought and that thought and you're just praying and &gt;&gt; sometimes the thing God inspires you, you just say, "Man, I I really don't want to preach that and find yourself arguing with the Lord." And &gt;&gt; and but you'll find out like who was it? Jeremiah in the Bible, he said, "I found out God's greater than I am. It's like a fire shut up in my bones. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you know, I was just praying, God, lead me. Show me. Just let And I I come to church. I said, Lord, just let brother Windle say something &gt;&gt; that would give me direction that would let me know that your will is, you know, friends, I'll just be honest with you. &gt;&gt; You know, we've been in this thing for a while now, and &gt;&gt; I just come to a place of realize that good sermons don't really amount to a whole lot. It's finding the mind of God. &gt;&gt; I don't want to preach good sermons. I want to help somebody. &gt;&gt; When I get done this morning, if y'all thought, "Man, that guy's crazy." And man, I &gt;&gt; if just one person could be helped. &gt;&gt; That's all that matters to me. &gt;&gt; I mean, after all, the Bible said it's a foolishness of preaching. That's right. &gt;&gt; You know, brother, brother Windle come to a place in his in his message and just the whole direction, you know, of being desperate and things like that. And &gt;&gt; then he read this quote and I had this quote. I just been reading it before I come to church. And the prophet of God said, "We find out that the modern church, a modern world church, &gt;&gt; Amen." He said, "And and also there's a spiritual church, and they're both pregnantated &gt;&gt; to give birth to sons. &gt;&gt; One of them, a denominational birth, is going to give one of these days." Amen. At the World Council of Churches wi which will produce to the world the Antichrist through a denomination. That's exactly the truth. A I may not live to see it. I believe I will. But you young people remember that you heard a minister say that. Amen. It'll finally wind up. It's the mark of the beast when she forms the world council of churches and she'll give birth to her son, the antichrist. &gt;&gt; The other is pregnant by the word of God &gt;&gt; and will bring forth the body, the finished body of Jesus Christ, which is the bride. &gt;&gt; The body of Christ isn't finished yet. How many knows that a man and woman is one? Christ is one body. The word, the bride will have to be the rest of that body. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? Amen. &gt;&gt; So, if there's a bride that's pregnantated, &gt;&gt; I want to tell you something, friends. I I just feel to say this before I go on any further. Amen. Once you get to that spot, Amen. You ain't no changing it. &gt;&gt; Come on, buddy. &gt;&gt; You're going to travail whether you want to or if you don't. &gt;&gt; Travail will come on you. &gt;&gt; Come on, friends. I know they got stuff today and they can give a woman a shot and it can prolong it and it can stop labor and it can, you know, all that, but they they can only do that so long. &gt;&gt; After a while, she's going to have a child. &gt;&gt; Whether she wants it or not, it's coming. &gt;&gt; Amen. The the pains will come on her. The travail will come on. Come on, church. We ain't trying to fast our way into a rapture. Amen. The it's coming on us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because a seed is planted in you. You're already pregnantated by the word of God. And the labor pains is coming upon us. We shall be delivered. &gt;&gt; Do you believe it? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe it this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. I tell you this, there's only one comfort we will accept. Amen. We won't accept any argument. Amen. We won't accept any comfort. I mean, I can just imagine, oh, Jacob, coming down to Rachel and say, "Oh, Rachel, honey, I love you. It don't matter if you have any children or if you don't, I love you anyhow. Don't you know, I think you're so beautiful. I I worked 14 years to have you." Amen. You know, Amen. And he's trying to pat her on the back. You ain't got to have no children, baby. Hey, listen. Amen. You're my wife. You're my queen. Amen. But she would not re She refused that comfort. She refused to be comforted. She didn't let nobody tell you, "You're good like you are. You're pretty like you are. You ain't got to have that manifestation of the word. Amen. Just be a good church. Just be a good Christian. Oh, come on. Just be a good church member. That's all you got to do. That's good enough. Amen. She refused the argument. She said, "You give me a son or I'll die." And I believe there's a bride that's got the same attitude. You give me the word or I'll die. I'm going to tell you this. There was only one thing that comforted Rachel and that's when she took a son in her arms and she held the word, the manifestation of the word. Oh church, I want to tell you, there's only one thing that'll comfort this bride. It's the manifestation of the word of God in this hour. &gt;&gt; I tell you what'll comfort us. It's called thus sayith the Lord. That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what's going to comfort us. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let me let me try to &gt;&gt; I don't know what time I started. &gt;&gt; It's all right. &gt;&gt; But just a few more minutes &gt;&gt; because you think about, you know, &gt;&gt; I got to think about that woman in Memphis. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. Come on. &gt;&gt; And and and remember, God gave her a son. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And and and and God gave her that son. And brother Daryl, she you know, I just if y'all allow me, I'll just dramatize a little bit, but I'm not trying to add to the story. And I'm not trying to say it was that way. I'm just saying maybe it could have been this way. &gt;&gt; You know, her boy got sick and he was dying. Maybe some of the neighbors stopped by and said, "Hey, if there's anything we can do, &gt;&gt; you know, we we bring food or &gt;&gt; uh you know, if there's anything we can do, &gt;&gt; that's all right." &gt;&gt; And and and you know, they were trying to comfort her and &gt;&gt; and maybe you know, others stopped by and say, you know, honey, we're going to be praying for you. God give you grace to go through this. Looks like the Lord's going to take your boy home. And you know, and they meant well and then I'm not trying to say anything against that. and they they had good well good intentions and you know just trying to comfort her heart and you know well you'll see him again and you know and and you know but there was something in her heart she wouldn't she wouldn't accept the comfort &gt;&gt; she said God gave me this boy &gt;&gt; and you know what she did she went in this Bible and she found herself &gt;&gt; and she said Lord you showed me I'm that shinomite woman and my womb was barren but you gave me a son but now my son is sick and he's on his deathbed amen but If I'm that Shinomite woman, where's your Elijah? Hallelujah. Amen. In her desperation, Amen. Grounded a plane over in Memphis. And Elijah, amen, was guided by the Holy Spirit. Go right to her house. Come on, church. Why? Because she would not accept any argument of comfort. Amen. There was nobody could talk her out of it. Amen. Her revelation was God gave me the boy and God's going to heal the boy. Come on. I tell you, is there any mama in here feels like that this morning? Amen. Maybe you got waver children. If that woman in Memphis could believe for the healing of her son, why can't you believe for the salvation of your children? And I don't care where they are. I don't care what kind of Listen, they might be in drugs. They might be alcoholics. Amen. They might Come on, church. Amen. But if God gave them to you, Amen. Lay a claim on it &gt;&gt; and refuse to be comforted. &gt;&gt; What about that? that that that mother down there in Mexico. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; She had a little baby and the baby died that morning. &gt;&gt; And the doctor, Amen, already declared that baby dead. But that woman heard there was some meetings going on and and that the man of God, Amen, had come down there and there was great miracles taking place and that God had used him to raise the dead. Amen. And that woman, Amen, hey, she refused it. She refused to be comforted. She refused any argument against it. &gt;&gt; Amen. She pressed her way through and the prophet of God said 100 ushers couldn't stop her. &gt;&gt; She climbed right over the top of them. Amen. She was so desperate and kept pressing until even the prophet looked at her and said he turned and looked. I believe Jack Moore, one of them brothers standing there. He said, "You just go on down and pray for her. She ain't going to know the difference anyhow." In other words, even brother Bama's going to try to comfort her. Just go on down there, brother Jack. Go on down there and comfort her. Lay your hands on her. Just, you know, try to appease her a little bit. Amen. Comfort her. Just pray for the, you know, and he said, but about the time, Amen, that he said that, he turned and looked back over the audience. He said, wait just a minute. He said, you bring out that woman to me. He said, cuz he saw a little Mexican baby smiling. Hallelujah. A vision broke. The baby was healed. I want to say this is what when we get a church like the woman in Memphis and when we get a church like the mother in Mexico, I tell you what you're going to see. You're going to see backsliders restored. You're going to see the sick heal. You're going to see life changed. Hallelujah. Don't tell me it ain't it ain't a reality. I tell you it is. I tell you this is a testimony. My wife's sitting right back there. Amen. She's got brothers. She's got a bunch of them. She's got six. Amen. And cut two of them was in our church. Amen. But Amen. She had a a lot of her brothers was just living in sin. And Amen. Not even serving God. Amen. And I I watched her pray. Amen. And claim and pray. Amen. And and she just kept holding on. Amen. And and six, eight months ago, I don't even know how long it was. Amen. And one of her brothers, which was actually the one that Hey, we've been through like all y'all too. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; We've seen everything around this message. &gt;&gt; All kind of nonsense and hurts and church hurts and we've been hurt by preachers and &gt;&gt; brother. &gt;&gt; And these boys have been scarred by these things. &gt;&gt; And her one brother was so bitter. &gt;&gt; I mean, just, you know, bitter &gt;&gt; against the message. and &gt;&gt; and all of a sudden, God starts dealing that boy's heart. I don't I didn't even know it was happening. &gt;&gt; He's he's listening to tapes. &gt;&gt; Come on, man. &gt;&gt; Then one day, one of our other brothers told me, he said, &gt;&gt; he's listening to our services. &gt;&gt; And I'd been on a series in over in the book of Hebrews, and I've been preaching, and I'd already covered some of the verses, and and God started dealing my heart. And I thought, Lord, I done preached that. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean, we I need to move on. I'm slow enough as it is. I mean, I've been preaching in he Hebrews for two years already. And I need to move on. And and I I I and and I, you know, again, I found myself arguing with the Lord. Went to church that morning. I got to preaching and the Lord was inspiring me in certain verses there in Hebrews. And I got to preaching on the prodigal son. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And &gt;&gt; I turned and looked and there said her brother. Oh yes. &gt;&gt; And he ain't missed he ain't missed hardly a service since &gt;&gt; completely surrendered his heart to God. &gt;&gt; She had another brother and and and he was he's a good boy. Lived a good life, you know, but just, you know, didn't go to church. He served God. Ain't interested. &gt;&gt; Yeah. The next thing, right after our meetings we just had in June, one day he text me and he said, he said, "I don't know how to say this." He said, "But I got to be saved." &gt;&gt; He said, "I don't know how to do it." &gt;&gt; He said, "I just need you to tell me how to be saved." &gt;&gt; And I led that boy to Christ and just baptized him just two weeks ago. She still got another one out there. But he's coming too. I tell you what, that's what'll happen when you refuse to be comforted. I won't accept no argument against it. Hallelujah. Amen. I refuse to let anybody tell me anything different. If God said he'll heal me, he'll heal me. If God said he'll give me my family, that's what he's going to do. And I refuse any argument against you. Amen. I tell you what, I believe that was there's some Rachel's in the house of God. Hallelujah. Amen. And we refuse. Amen. We got the same attitude like Hannah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I might be barren, but God will open my room. The conditions might be getting worse. Come on, church. Amen. This ain't an our convenience, but the travail has come. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Do you believe it? [Music] &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you this in closing as the musicians come this morning. [Music] &gt;&gt; That's good, brother. &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "Amen. Thus sayeth the Lord, &gt;&gt; refrain thy voice from weeping." &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. and thine eyes from tears. &gt;&gt; For the works, for the works shall be rewarded, &gt;&gt; sayeth the Lord, and they shall come again from the land of the enemy, and there is hope in thine end, sayeth the Lord, thy children shall come again to their own border. Amen. I tell you, that's the only comfort that the bride of Christ will accept is the comfort of thus sayeth the Lord. Hallelujah. I will not be denied. I will not turn back. I won't be talked out of it. I might as well say it. I don't care how many books they write. I don't care how many websites they build. I don't care what they say about the message. I refuse to be comforted. Hallelujah. This message is rapturing grace. It's going to change my body. Hallelujah. And the only comfort I will accept is a manifested word. Brother, I tell you, your comfort is coming. Because one of these mornings between 6:00 and 9, a sweep is going to sweep over and the old is going to be gone and our bodies are going to be changed. There's going to be a resurrection, friends. And that is the comfort of this bride. Thus sayeth the Lord, brother Dale, your work shall be rewarded. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother Andrew, your work shall be rewarded. Yes. &gt;&gt; Listen, mama. Your work shall be rewarded. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; And your children shall come again. &gt;&gt; Can I show it to you in the scripture? &gt;&gt; As we as we just stand our feet, &gt;&gt; first Thessalonians 4:16. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; This is the bride's comfort. &gt;&gt; Come on, buddy. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; For the Lord himself. shall ascend from heaven with a shout. &gt;&gt; And the voice of the archangel and the trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Listen friends, don't tell me my comfort's already on the way. &gt;&gt; Because a shout is already happened. &gt;&gt; The Lord is already descending. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And as he's coming, he's bringing my comfort with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with him in the clouds and meet the Lord in the air. And so will we ever be with the Lord. Wherefore, comfort one another with these words. Come on, listen friends. I won't accept the comfort. Don't tell me I can't be a part of the bride. It ain't for me. It's not for my day. I refuse that. But if you want to comfort me, just start telling me this. The Lord has come. The message is here. Hallelujah. Rapturing grace has been given. Hallelujah. Comfort one another with these words. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Oh, let's try to sing, brother. I would not be denied. &gt;&gt; Amen. If we can try this morning. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When pains of death cease, oh my soul. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I would not be denied. Oh, I would not be denied. I would not be denied till Jesus came. He made me whole. I would not be denied. I shake up in the days of old. I wrestle with the Lord. And in stood with a courage bold, I stood upon his word. Oh, I would not be denied. I would not be denied. Till Jesus came, he made me whole. I would not be ding out. Oh, Satan said my Lord was gone and would not hear my prayer. Praise the work and the Lord. Oh, I would not be. You feel that way. He made me whole. I would not be denied. Oh, Satan said my Lord was gone and could not. [Music] [Applause] I would not be till Jesus came. He made me whole. I would not be. One more time with all my heart. Oh my [Music] good. [Music] Sing it one more time as a declaration. I would not be [Music] Jesus. He made me not. Give the Lord a great hand of praise. Hallelujah. I refuse to be talked out of it. Don't try to comfort me. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll bring forth life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This bride, you are the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, I told the church right after they elected the pope out of America, &gt;&gt; you know, they said they even the Catholic Church, you go study it. Yeah, I was, you know, reading all kind of news and articles building up to that and they said people are saying it's a it's a &gt;&gt; it's a long shot. &gt;&gt; There ain't no chance. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Even the Catholic Church said themselves, they said, "We'll never have a pope out of America as long as she's a superpower." &gt;&gt; Right. That's right. &gt;&gt; But Bible prophecy &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; See, that's what they didn't factor in &gt;&gt; was Revelations 13. And the prophet stood and looked at the prophecy and said, "According to the prophecy, there's a pope will rise up out of America." &gt;&gt; But friends, don't forget the rest of that. &gt;&gt; He said, "At that time, there'll be a church." Now, I'll tell you this. I don't know. I'll say this. &gt;&gt; There's never been a pope out of America. Now, there is one. &gt;&gt; We don't know if he's the Antichrist. I mean, how could we know that? But but there's a pope out of America. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Never happened before, and it's happened now. Come on. &gt;&gt; But I can say, well, I don't really know if that man is the actual man that will fulfill all the &gt;&gt; But I guarantee you one thing, &gt;&gt; the rest of that quote, &gt;&gt; he said, "At that time, there'll be a church so bound together by the love of God." &gt;&gt; Now, church, I don't know if that's the right man, but I know you're the right church. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I believe the prophecy is being fulfilled. And don't tell me if God can put a man in the in the Vatican and God can put Russia in her position and God can put a president in the White House. Don't tell me he can't put a bride in the rapture. &gt;&gt; We are that church. We are that church that will rise up with the power of God that'll speak the word. Amen. And lightning will flash. Listen friends, the thing that the prophet said, the thing that the scripture said, Amen. Don't put it off to another age. Don't let nobody talk you out of it. You're the people. &gt;&gt; You are &gt;&gt; the bride of Jesus. &gt;&gt; God bless you. I love you with all my heart. [Music] &gt;&gt; Enjoy the word of the Lord this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't God good to us? &gt;&gt; Amen. We're not going to we're going to worship for a little bit, but we are going to go ahead and pray for the food. And the food is will be ready just as soon as we leave here. Amen. Uh we don't want to uh don't forget this evening service 5:00 tonight. And uh also, Lord willing, there'll be a prayer line if there's room to have one. Amen. Brother Daryl Ward will be speaking for us tonight. Be praying for Brother Daryl. If you get some time today, amen, just say a say a prayer for Brother Daryl and maybe just pray for the service tonight as well. Man, I believe the Lord's going to move again. And the presence of the Lord is here right now in this service. And I believe if you've got a need on your heart, if you just hold you, just believe. Just claim it this morning. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; And he thought enough about us. He thought we was worth saving. &gt;&gt; He thought we were worth saving. I believe he's he thinks enough of us to take us to the rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we just love We love him with all of our hearts. I wonder, brother Andrew, would you come, buddy? And I'm going to have you pray for the food and and just if you want to just stay in worship for a little bit. Brother Kobe's going to lead us in some worship. God bless you. Let's just bow our hearts together. Heavenly Father, Lord, we thank you for the surge of the Holy Spirit we feel in this building this morning. Father, as your word was ministered in power and demonstration, Lord, we thank you for the truth, Lord. And we thank you that you've sent us a comforter at this hour, Father, to comfort our hearts, that you would not leave us fatherless, Lord. You would not leave us headless, Lord. You would not leave us in confusion, but Lord, you would send us a promise. Now, Lord, these things we've heard this morning, Lord, may it not be just another sermon. Father, may it not be just another good time in your presence, but Lord, Father, may it become strength as Abraham nursed from El Shadi, Lord. Father, may we nurse from the promises of God we've heard this morning. Nursing into our body the strength to bring forth this miracle, Lord. Father, I pray you bless your servant this morning. May you anoint him, Lord. May you, Father, restore everything to him that he's poured out here today. Father, as we prepare for the evening, I pray you would anoint your servant, Brother Daryl. Lord, Father, may you pour into him everything we have need of, Father. Lord, may faith be increased in the building this morning, oh God. That Lord, needs would be met here tonight, Father. Your will would be performed, oh God. Lord, may healing take place here tonight, Father. We are looking to you, the God of miracles, Lord, as we prepare to depart from this place today, Lord. Father, may we not leave here and leave you in this building, but may we take you with us, Lord. And Father, may we prepare our hearts for the service. Bless the food that's been prepared, Lord. Lord, bless the hands that have prepared and all the efforts and labors that's gone into it, Lord. May you reward the servants, Lord. May you give them their portion, Lord. I pray as they're serving your bride so faithfully here this weekend. Now, Father, we commit this meeting and this day in thy faithful hands. We love you and thank you for visiting with us this morning. In Jesus Christ's mighty name we pray. Amen. And amen. And don't forget choir practice at 2:30 for all who would like to sing.
