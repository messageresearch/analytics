means to be brought back to our original condition it means that or that we were yours before the foundation of the earth and because we were yours we could be brought back oh lord and we're so thankful for that today god so thankful for the proof of that in our life which is not any emotion or sensation but it is your your spirit living inside of us it is the literal life of christ living itself out and i'm so thankful of that tonight and and that life brings tears to our eyes and causes us to lift our hands and worship we're so thankful lord for that tonight i pray you bless each one we know that there's many needs represented here tonight i pray that you continue to comfort the family of those that have lost loved ones i i pray for those that are in need in their body or that you'd heal them tonight while the word is going forth lord i pray you do what only you can do and bring the word to its proper place we pray in jesus name amen amen god bless you tonight turn with me to jonah chapter 1 and verse 17 jonah 1 and 17. while you're turning there sister gene's memorial service will be at 3 o'clock on sunday so that's our regular service time so hopefully all of you can be there on sunday afternoon you say well maybe you didn't know her very well but she was a member of this church and a part of the body some of you went to church with her for a long time and and i'm sure you were good friends and i i counted her as a friend and and uh i believe that the lord took her home it was time for her to move on to a better body and so i'm thankful for that but we're uh sorrowful for those that have lost uh brother robert and and the family that have lost her i can't uh empathize with someone who's lost a mother because i still have mine but some of you know what they're going through right now and and so we we want to pray for them but memorial service will be three o'clock on sunday we're gonna have a dinner afterwards so like a potluck so if you could bring more than enough uh for you and your family and some of you ladies may want to get together on that but there will be some people here for the family there will be family it's a small family but there'll be some of them here and many friends i think and and so if you would bring some extra and just share that with them after the service we'd appreciate it now if you want to or need to have your meal in the fellowship hall in between that'll be fine but make sure you clean up after yourself if you do that could you do that i uh we're probably going to go out because i don't want to make my wife clean up after me twice on sunday in the fellowship hall it takes her a while sometimes we're here for quite a while on sunday nights cleaning up so if you could just uh just think about that on sunday maybe you'd like to go out and eat and then come back and have that meal with us after the service we want to celebrate the life of sister jean and uh and and welcome i'm sure she's uh she's been welcomed home already in that new body but we want to help that family as much as we can as well labor day weekend i want to have one service that weekend because i know some of you are going to be gone and you're going to be traveling so remember that labor day weekend we'll just have one one service and then that next day will be the holiday so you can get away wherever you're going jonah chapter 1 and verse 17. are you ready for the word tonight it says now the lord had prepared a great fish to swallow up jonah and jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights i pray the lord would add his blessing to the word you may be seated the word prepared in hebrew is appointed appointed god appointed a fish for jonah it tells us that the fish was not created on the spot but it was previously in the ocean and but god put it there so it wasn't as if it was uh did he just well created a fish he could have done that but he actually caused it to grow and and and to want to be in that area and and we don't understand sometimes how god works but that fish came about it came to that area to be jonah's the method of jonah's deliverance and yet jonah could have never dreamed that up he could have never imagined what it might have been what what might get him out of this situation as we said last week he just threw himself into the arms of god aren't you glad to have a god today that's big enough that you can you can throw yourself on his mercy you you can you can throw yourself on his grace and i'm so thankful of that tonight now and i'm trying to to hurry i've got a lot on my plate tonight but i'm not going to hold you so i just want to try to get through some of this now the nature of his deliverance was not a glorious thing and i want you to think about that tonight the nature of jonah's deliverance was not a glorious thing it was actually a very hard thing in fact it is a type of hell the fish's belly was so bad that it is a type of christ going and descending into hell and preaching to the souls in prison so the fish's belly was not a place that you'd want to go in you'd never pick that as the method of god's deliverance in your life i heard a story about a man who was dark one night and he was walking along a path and he fell off a cliff and he grabbed a hold of something he's hanging by one hand and as he's hanging there he he says help help can anyone help me and he hears a voice from above it says i am the lord i'll help you and the man says okay lord get me out of here he said okay if you want help let go the man thought about it for a minute and he says help help is there anyone else up there because sometimes we don't want what god wants we we don't like god's methods of delivering us but if you'll just trust him tonight any birth brother branham said is a mess any time you you come out of a trial you come through a struggle there's always going to be a whale's belly to go through but what are you doing while you're in there what's going on while you're in the wells valley we may think jonah was backslid we might we might look down on jonah a little bit for running from the presence of the lord but look what he did when he got inside the well's belly oh lord church that's the thing that we ought to look at tonight that's the thing we ought to examine in our own lives lord when i get into the belly of hell when i'm going through the darkest trial of my life what is it that i do during that time what what kind of what what is coming out of my life during that time the next few verses in jonah are remarkable jonah chapter 2 and verse 1 then jonah prayed oh i love this jonah prayed unto the lord his god out of the fish's belly think about it again we want to call him backslid but he's praying out of a fish's belly he's going through hell excuse me for being blunt with it like that but that's that's what it was he is in the darkest deepest part of the ocean and the place that he's in was a whale's belly now if you've been fishing very many times you've cut open a fish you know that a fish's belly is not pleasant it smells bad it's nasty it's got everything the fish ate in the last three or four days still in the belly i've cut open fish and found other people's bait in the fish cut open i've cut open fish and found live fish inside a fish's belly that just hadn't died yet they swallowed them whole you find all kinds of things when you cut open a fish's belly now this was just a big fish you realize god didn't prepare or at least we're not told that he did a special sanitized fish's belly for jonah to be in that would just make everything just right and everything pristine and you know sometimes that's what we want god to do for us are you with me tonight we want god to prepare well we well when i come to die it's just going to be so peaceful and everything's going to be right it's not always going to be that way when i go through when i get married or when i have children everything's just going to be just right and they're all going to follow me along when i get married i know some some guys when they go to get married they think well when i have a wife she'll always say yes sir and she'll always have dinner on the table at the right time god don't do it that way all the time moses got a wife one time that had a temper and god gave her to him because moses had a temper they were fit for one another and god was working on moses are you with me tonight so sometimes it's not the way we would want it to be he said well i must have married the wrong one no you got exactly what god wanted you to have jonah thought well this is a mess what am i going to do well i might as well give up might as well let go might as well just just forget about everything no that's not what he said he began to look to the lord when he was in the worst moment of his life he cried out to god he said lord i'm not in church i'm not in a good place i'm not in a in a fancy uh altar somewhere i'm not i'm not in a in a temple with gold and all these things but i still believe that you're my god i still believe you're a deliverer oh can you be like jonah tonight and say that i may be going through a hard time in my life but i still believe that you are the lord god jonah prayed unto the lord his god out of the fish's belly and said i cried by reason of mine affliction unto the lord and he heard me out of the belly of hell cried i and thou heardest my voice for thou has cast me into the deep now think about this he's still in the wells belly he's still in the belly of the fish he said you you delivered me look past tense i cried and you heard my voice for thou had cast me into the deep and he's not saying this after he got vomited up right he's saying this while he's in the whale's belly and that's why again i think brother branham as he begins to look at this story he realizes that we're giving jonah too hard of a time because jonah was really he was really in a place where where he should have given up he was in a place where he should have just get turned his back on god and many of you have been in places like that but he didn't but you know what there was something else too god proved his power to jonah while he was in the whale's belly because he gets down there and there's there's fish vomit there's no other way to say it all around him he's being digested in the fluid there's dead fish and just they can swallow a man he's eating some some crazy stuff and so it's all around him and he's looking at her everywhere he looks at swells about him and as he begins to look around he's in that place and he realizes something i'm still alive i'm still living i'm in a whale's belly but i'm alive are you with me tonight forgive me i'm just a little bit i i've got this on my mind on my heart and i'm i'm thinking i'm being too forceful with it but it's you just can't you just can't imagine being in these kind of a circumstances but yet when you're in those kind of circumstances when you're in that wells belly when you're going through the hardest moment of your life and you look at us but i'm still living i still believe in god the devil hasn't talked me out of the message of the hour he can't talk oh god doesn't that give you confidence brother danny when you realize what you've been through and what's been in the past you can look back at it and say the devil couldn't get me 40 years ago he couldn't get me 20 years ago he couldn't get me two years ago and he hasn't got me today i'm still alive i may be going through some things right now but i'm still living and jonah says hey i'm alive i might as well cry out to god haven't died it was proof of god's supernatural power a god that could keep me alive and put me in a whale's belly listen to me church a god that could keep you through your trial that could keep you alive even in the moment when you're going through your worst trial can deliver you out of it amen out of the belly of hell cried thou heard us my voice thou hast cast me into the deep in the midst of the seas the floods compassed me about all thy billows and thy ways passed over me and i said i am cast out of thy sight yet i will look again toward thy holy temple the waters compass me about even to the soul the depth closed me round about the weeds were wrapped about my head this wasn't a pleasant place to be i went down to the bottoms of the mountains the earth with her bars was about me forever yet hostile brought up my life from corruption oh lord my god when my soul painted within me i remembered the lord and my prayer came in unto thee into thine holy temple they that observe lying vanities listen forsake their own mercy he said but i will sacrifice unto thee he's still in the well's belly well brother ben maybe he got out and then he's right in this later he's still in the wells belly you will you'll see that in the next verse but i will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving i don't feel like it but i'm going to go to church and i'm going to worship god i got seaweed wrapped around my head but i'm going to turn towards the temple and i'm going to ask god for forgiveness i'm going to ask him for mercy and i'm going to believe that he's done it and i'm going to believe that i'm already walking out well i wonder if we could look at our trials like that he said but brother ben you don't realize what i've been through brother random over and over again told us he said none of us have symptoms like jonah had none of us can say i was in a whale's belly at the bottom of the deepest darkest sea with no hope out and yet i cried out to god oh if jonah could do it doing that and those symptoms of prophet who would run from the presence of god yet he was god's man if jonah could cry out why couldn't we cry out tonight say lord i want to offer my voice of thanksgiving i want to i want to lift my hands in praise because i've been in the belly of hell i've been in that place and i come out alive and i know you brought me out amen amen i'm gonna have to stop are you with me tonight hallelujah i just love the scriptures don't you i will pay that i have vowed salvation is of the lord and the lord spaking to the fish amen if you start worshiping god in that situation that you're in if you'd let your attitude become an attitude of the word in that situation that you're in you'll find out the situation begins to change yes because god spoke to the fish and it vomited out jonah upon the dry land and there wasn't ever a man who had more victory can you imagine what kind of a service that jonah had when he walked out on dry land he said well i guess i better go to nineveh praise god he's taking seaweed off his neck wiping muck off his arms and the fisherman watching him as he walks up on the shore i serve a god who can bring me out of a fish's belly i serve a god who brought me out of the belly of hell i serve a god are you with me tonight can anyone testify that tonight i serve that same god tonight a god who brought me out of the belly of hell a god who brought me through the darkest moments listen to me you don't have to give up and give in and say well i just might as well give in and do what the world does if living for god hasn't helped me you don't have to do that you can be like jonah and say i'm not going to give in i'm not going to be like every other young person i'm not going to fall like every other person that fell but i'm going to live for god i'm going to do what's right why because i know my god is a deliverer i know my god will bring me out on dry land oh jonah had church when he come out hallelujah i believe we ought to have church tonight we've been through some things and we come out on the other side you say we have yes every one of you individually has been through some things you're a human being you go through fiery trials but yet you come out smelling like a rose maybe like seaweed too but mostly like a rose the prophet go anywhere and preach anything at that moment now i want to focus now on that wells belly because that's where many of us are at different times in our life but the brandon said anything a fish after it eats it goes right down to the bottom feed your little goldfish and watch what happened they go right down at the bottom of the little container you got them in rest are little swimmers on the bottom they're little bellies foals so they're down there resting so when this big fish swallowed jonah he must have went down to the bottom to rest out of the waves and out of the storm he was looking around through the revival to see what he could find and the revival on the sea you know swish it up and down the winds so we found this preacher and swallowed him and went down to the bottom he said now here jonah down there in the belly of this whale with his hands and feet tied laying in the vomit of the well he said now i've often heard people say i was prayed for last night my hand is no better it's still crippled i still have the stomach ache my eyes i don't see good yet oh my he said then holler at jonah he said if anybody had a case of symptoms he ought to have had it if he looked this way it was whale's belly that way was well's belly everywhere he looked with whale's belly and his hands was tied behind him he was in the whales belly in the bottom of the seat he said probably 40 fathoms deep in the bottom of the sea he said now talk about symptoms he said and then you call him backslid yeah he said he was laying there in the vomit in the whale's belly seaweeds around his neck and if he looked this away it was whale's belly he looked that way as well everywhere he looked to his whales brother you talk about a case of symptoms he might have had it but you know what he said he said they're lying vanities i'll not no more look at them but once more will i look to your holy temple all for a people that could be like that tonight you might have made mistakes you might have run from the presence of god at some point in your life but today you're saying i'm not looking at my symptoms i'm not looking at these lying vanities that lying vanities in the original is empty nothings worthless idols now it's idolatry to elevate your symptoms over the word of god think about it it is idolatry to elevate your symptoms over the word of god the word of god says i'm the god that heals all thy diseases then if we say well but i have cancer or i have named the disease coveted whatever it might be and and that covid i can't get rid of that that's not included cancer i can't get rid of that and what's happening is that we're actually we're actually taking the word of the symptom over the word of the bible and when we do that we are worshiping idols that's what this is empty nothings lying vanities so we actually begin to worship our symptoms well you thought that's going to be real good tonight didn't you we start to worship the symptoms by promoting them well brother ben i can't feel good in church i can't serve god i can't worship god because i have this going on what are we doing you know we would never fall down in front of a portrait of william brown and we know better than that and worship and lay on her face and worship in front of a man we would never do that i trust that you wouldn't if you would you're you're an idol worshiper we would never fall down in front of a portrait of william branham but you fall down in front of symptoms fall down in front of in front of things that are going on in your life well i can't go to church because i don't have no money i can't live for god because i don't have this side or the other we're worshiping that symptom over what god said what did god say god said i'll take care of you i'll love you i'll live for you oh but for the men you don't understand tonight i just can't worship god because tonight i'm i i just feel bad aren't you elevating your feelings over what god said when he said come into my house with a with a voice of praise praise me on the on the symbols praise me on the drum praised me with a stringed instrument isn't that what he said yes sir so we're committed committing just as much idolatry as a person would laying on the floor in front of a picture of a man when we elevate our symptoms over the word right perhaps he was thinking of psalms 31 let's go back to the scriptures psalm 31 1 says in thee o lord do i put my trust let me never be ashamed deliver me in thy righteousness bow down thine ear to me deliver me speedily be down my strong rock for a house of defense to save me for thou art my rock and my fortress therefore for thy name's sake lead me and guide me pull me out of the net that they have laid privily for me for thou art my strength into thine hand i commit my spirit that's one of those scriptures david doesn't know what he's talking about but jesus jesus has the reality of that on the cross he said thou has to redeem me oh lord god of truth notice what he says in verse 6 i have hated them that regard lying vanities but i trust in the lord i will not worship worship empty nothings are you hear me tonight i will not worship empty nothings i will not worship human beings other than jesus are you with me tonight i will not worship churches i will not worship a pastor i refuse to worship an idol of stone or one of wood one of gold he said i hated them that regard lying vanities but also refused to worship a symptom i refuse to worship what's going on that's wrong in my life until all my thoughts are on it and all my attention is on it and all of my all my days are spent worrying about it and i don't have time to worship god i don't have time to read the bible because all i can do is worry about what's coming down the week and what i have to do tomorrow some of you are there right now and trust me i've been there i got a lot going on this week too i'm thinking about what's going to be tomorrow and the next day and the next day and the next day and i've got my calendars filled up for months and i get to look at and think lord how will i have the strength to do it but he's the strength giver he knows what he's doing please say amen to that today he knows what he's doing he said i've hated them that regard lying vanities but i trust in the lord i will not worship my symptoms i will not give regard that's what that word regard is i will not give regard in other words i will not i will not i will not give them a do omniscience i will not i will not see to give regard to an idol is if there's an idol there an idol worshiper has to give regard to it right he's got to walk by and say oh that's an idol i need to bow down but a man who doesn't believe in idols it don't mean nothing to him he's not going to bow down to it because it's an empty nothing and that's why paul says whatever you buy in the market don't ask how they got it he said if it was offered to an idol the idol is nothing it's an empty nothing except if your conscience feels bad or or somebody asks you about it then just don't eat it don't don't don't begrudge your brother if he's got a weak conscience but it's an empty nothing and many times the empty nothings of our life have filled our filled our life with trouble and filled our life with worry and it's just nothing all right brother ben you don't how can you call my trial of nothing he said all things work together for good i'm not trying to be obtuse tonight i couldn't think of another word i'm sorry i know that's too much for you brother joel but i couldn't think of anything else i'm not trying to be forward or uh i'm not trying to to beat you up but i gotta get to the point in my own life i don't regard empty nothings don't you want to get to that point i don't regard empty nothings my wife is not my god your husband is not your god the church is not your god another preacher is not your god i could let them rule my day but i refuse to are you with me now i can let them run my life but i refuse to i know it's hard but i will not worship empty nothings yes i want to worship god i'll live the word but if i do you know if i if i live right if i do right this person will leave me this boyfriend or this girlfriend you'll be better off without them and stay with the word i will not worship my symptoms i'll give regard to i will not give regard to empty nothings look at look at romans chapter four i'm gonna i'm gonna go down because i'm i need some time here i need to buy some time so we're gonna skip down uh to romans 4 19. he said being not weak in faith speaking of abraham he considered not he considered not he passed by the empty nothing of his own body now dead when he was about a hundred years old neither yet the deadness of sarah's womb he staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to god and being fully persuaded that when he had prompted what he had promised he was able also to perform therefore it was imputed unto him for righteousness amen even when he made mistakes even when he lied even when he did those things but yet it was imputed to him for righteousness because he refused to bow down to nothing's listen jonah had to count himself dead when he was alive remember he had to put himself in the ocean he also had to count himself alive when he was dead think about it for a minute when he was in control of his life god caused the storm to come along so that he would no longer be in control of his life and so he falls into the into the hands of god counts his life he counts though he's alive he counts himself as dead and now he's alive or he's he's he's dead as far as we know now you think about it you ever heard of schrodinger's cat that that's the idea uh the philosopher that said that well there's a cat in a box it's sealed up and when it's in the box because you don't know there's no way of checking on it you know it's going to die if it stays in there so it's dead already and yet it's alive so his his thing his thought was i've lost some of you his thought was that the cat is both dead and alive in the box gabe you correct me later if that's wrong but i believe that was hysteri the cat is both dead in the life jonas dead and alive in the belly of the well he can't get out so he's dead and alive right right when he was alive he reckoned himself dead oh god when he was dead he reckoned himself alive god is sorry you might as well yeah and so now brother branson said we look at our symptoms shame on us when jonah under them circumstances could look away from his symptoms he said he refused to look at them he said they're lying vanities i'll look towards your temple oh god give us men and women with rugged faith and we'll not look to symptoms or look at anything the devil hands you can we say amen to that tonight hand it back to him say i believe in the resurrection of jesus christ i believe in his all-sufficient power how many believers do we have here tonight i believe that his presence is here now i'm not looking for it tomorrow i'm not looking for it some other time but i believe his presence is here now to set me free from any bondage that satan put upon me and i look where he sits at the right hand of god ever living to make intercession for me what are you looking at tonight when jonah is in the belly of the well he's not looking at the vomit he's not looking at the whale's belly but he's looking by faith towards the temple amen he said you know you find so many people said you know you find so many people that rely upon symptoms well i was prayed for i got a crippled hand i was prayed for but i really believed god but my hand is no better it'll never be no better as long as you look at that hand he said see you're looking at the wrong thing you must look at his promise see we're watching our situation for signs of improvement and you're looking at the wrong thing brother ben i just don't see any sign of improvement so i'm just going to give up you looking at the wrong thing brother branham told the story about an old couple and i've got the quotes here but i i'll just tell it to save time but about the old couple that uh he had their son had diphtheria and brother branham has trouble getting in you remember he said they dressed him up like a member of the ku klux klan and some of these people by the way they're anti-william branham because he used that word of trying to tie him to the ku klux klan and he was just using the image of that that's what it looked like when he was dressed up to go in the hospital to pray for a dying boy but he had trouble getting in and they finally let him in and he said it had got into the heart and and was just beating so many times a minute and the instruments there proved that he couldn't recover you remember the story and he got an old father and mother there and brother branham said he said i got down beside the boy and i just prayed a common prayer oh my a common prayer and when he said amen he said the father and the mother hugged one another and they said and the father said oh mother isn't it wonderful thank you lord jesus for healing our boy the boy was just as bad as he ever was and they just wiped the tears from each other's eyes and just praise god he said and the nurse was standing there and she said i don't understand your religion she said how can you act like that and the mother of this child act like that that boy laying there dying he said the boy is not dying that wasn't brother branham was saying that he just standing there watching this is the man that the father of the child or the young man that was there and he said he's been she said well he's been in a coma three days and the machine shows that he can never come back again and the old father wiped his eyes and walked over put his hands on the young woman's shoulder and said child you're taught to look at that machine that's all you know about is watch that machine he said all the machine knows it's to tell what's going on here he said that's true you're looking at that machine but i'm looking at a promise that god made he said it depends on what you're looking at and he said today that boy is married and got two children see it just goes to show he said he laid like that another two or three days but he'd come right out and got well oh aren't you glad you don't have to look at the symptoms today he said see it just goes to show what you're looking at you've got to see what you're looking at he said don't look at your symptoms now remember this this was a miraculous thing he had to believe that he would be resurrected because you can't live in the belly of a well right right you just can't live like that but he had to believe he was it was a terminal condition that he had he went to the doctor and the doctor pulled up his chart and he said you're in a whale's belly you're going to die right you went to a preacher and the preacher looked at him and said you're in a whale's belly get out of here you're going to die you're in a wealth but nobody ever comes back from the whale's belly oh god no one ever come back from a whale's belly nobody was ever dead for three days and three nights in the bottom of the ocean nobody's ever been in the belly of hell and come out again but jonah was proof it could be done and jesus said a wicked and adulterous generation seeks after a sign but there won't be one given it except for the sign of the prophet jonah amen because the son of man will be in the belly of the earth for three days and three nights but he's coming up again and he believes the promise just like jonah did what did jesus believe brother madam said he had to believe his own word yes spoken by a backslidden preacher named david who stepped back there and said i'll not suffer my whole not leave my holy one and i'll leave my soul in hell and will not suffer my holy one to see corruption and we believe that one verse of scripture and come up oh my oh how many scriptures do we have to show that we're the bride that we're predestined of god that we are seated in heavenly places go read ephesians chapter one go read romans chapter four go encourage yourself in the word and then say lord i'm gonna believe this and not the echogram i'm gonna believe this and not the diabetes i'm gonna believe this and not what i'm going through at work i just i'm just preaching to myself too tonight we look at the promise like abraham jonah and jesus had that one thing in common i had to have faith for a resurrection so do we we lay our loved ones in in the ground you got to have faith in that moment for a resurrection i've never been so sure as when i bury a christian that i'll see a person again if i tell my brother my wife or somebody that i know that's reliable i tell them meet me at my house i'm not as sure that i'll see them as i am someone i'm laying in the grave that i know as a christian think about it because they might get in a wreck on the way they might have trouble they might end up in the hospital they might get to talking to somebody and forget but i serve a god that once that body is laid away and they go to that new body they can't help but come back are you with me now i'm more sure of that than i am that i'll be preaching here on sunday morning because we live in a world where anything could happen we don't know what'll happen next but i'm sure of one thing i'm going to see my loved ones again i believe in a resurrection that's what jonah had to believe in amen jonah 2 4 he said where did he look he said i'll look again toward thy holy temple i will look again in other words i will turn and look i'll turn away from the whale's belly somehow in the middle of the darkness and the vomit and the seaweed he remembered god's promise oh god what was that promise second chronicles chapter six i'm gonna skip some of this too because i'm almost out of time brother peter now look you can go read the whole chapter it's a wonderful chapter where he's dedicating solomon is dedicating the temple in in verse 21 he said hearken therefore unto the supplications of thy servant and of thy people israel which they shall make toward this place hear thou from thy dwelling place even from heaven and when thou hearest forgive yes if there be dearth in the land if there be pestilence if there'd be blasting the wind the east wind would come and just blast that country until it would it would take the the crops the fruit right off the trees and if there'd be blasting or mildew locusts or caterpillars if their enemies besiege them in the cities of their land whatsoever sore whatsoever sickness there be then what prayer or what supplication so ever shall be made of any man or of all thy people israel and everyone shall know his own sore and his own grief and shall spread forth his hands in this house then hear thou from heaven thy dwelling place i just love the way that's worded i believe the bible means what it says everyone has his own sore everyone has his own grief but when he'll spread his hands toward heaven he said i'll hear it i'll hear you amen he said then hear thou from heaven thy dwelling place and forgive and render unto every man according to unto all his ways whose heart thou knowest jonah knew god knew his heart people didn't think much of him right then because he ran from god's commission but god knew his heart oh god he said whose heart thou knowest for thou only knoweth the hearts of the children of men that they may fear thee to walk in thy ways so long as they live in the land which thou gave us unto our fathers if they sin against thee i think every one of us could look at this and we could say i've done that oh so i don't i don't commit any sin well i just make mistakes well that's true but you have you do things sometimes that the bible calls sin worry is one of them and we could go on from there oh god but the reason why it's just a mistake is because we have an advocate we have a blood that covers oh hallelujah we've been born again you don't see our mistakes but look he said if they sin against thee there is no man which sinneth not and thou be angry with them and deliver them over before their enemies and they carried them away captives into a land far off or near yet if they befake themselves if it comes to them in the land whether they are carried captive jonah is in the belly of a whale but the scripture still applied in the belly of the fish he's carried away captive he said and turn oh god well there's the key we forget to turn we forget the term brother branham said jonah turned towards the temple and turn and pray unto thee in the land of their captivity saying we have sinned we have done a myth have dealt wickedly if they return to thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity whether they have carried them captive and pray toward their land which thou gave us unto their fathers toward the city which thou has chosen toward the house which i have built for thy name then hear thou from the heavens even from that dwelling place their prayer and their supplications maintain their cause and forgive thy people which have sinned against thee you can go on and read the rest of that chapter but then in second chronicles 7 1 the next verse after that chapter he said now when solomon had made it into praying god began to prove what solomon was praying that he he would stand behind it how did he do it the fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices and the glory of the lord filled the house he saw him and said lord come and dwell in your temple and he came oh my and it was proof he would keep his word oh god brother brown said you know what he said he said there are lying vanities i won't believe them his symptoms what did he say once more well i looked to your holy temple turned over on his back and faced the best he could towards the temple don't give up because you don't know which way to turn jonah couldn't see the temple you know how bad your sense of direction would be if you were in complete darkness 40 fathoms deep hundreds of feet in the ocean in the belly of a whale your sense of direction is gone but jonah had enough faith to believe that the direction he was turning was the direction the temple was in and somehow it was listen to me you might have messed up you might have messed up this week you might have done something horribly bad you're afraid to tell anybody turn don't look at your symptoms don't look how you messed up turn i'm not going to do that no more i'm not going to think like that anymore turn turn repent that's what repentance is to turn from your evil ways he turned on his back and faced the best he could towards the temple when solomon dedicated that temple he prayed when the pillar of fire come in and went down behind the holiest of holy solomon prayed and said lord if your people be in trouble anywhere and look towards this holy place hear from heaven and he believed it and god did something he said i don't know what he done he might have put an oxygen tank in that whale's belly musicians go ahead and come my time's over he said i don't know what he done he kept him alive for three days and nights and delivered him at his course where he was supposed to go and jonah under those circumstances could believe in a prayer that was made by a man that later back said because of women as solomon believed on a temple that was built with the hands of men how much more are we tonight look to christ who is sitting at the right hand of god with his own blood making intercession upon our confession how we ought to believe it nothing no symptoms stand in the way i'm looking towards god's promise he said he would do it how many could say amen to that tonight amen can we stand together and just believe it amen i'm going to look towards your sin i'm not going to look towards the symptoms i'm going to look towards your word lord i'm going to look towards the word it reminded me of the third pole vision and i've preached it to you before but here come a woman in one side of the of that little room and when she come in she was crippled and she come out the other side well but the brown said she'd come out screaming at the top of her voice he said another woman asked her what happened she said i just don't know she said i couldn't tell you what happened she said i've been paralyzed for 20 years and i feel like i was never sick what happened we don't know what happened with jonah but somehow in the in the whale's belly somehow in amongst all the seaweed in the vomit he got a hold of god and god heard him and he spoke to the whale and it vomited him up into that revival the bible says he knows the way that i take when he hath tried me i shall come forth this gold get you by your heads with me tonight i did my best to keep it at 45 minutes and i just want you to take a little time now and reflect on your life and reflect on mine oh god oh god how we want to be in your will lord when we find ourselves in a whale's belly in the belly of the fish in the worst moment of our lives maybe you meant for us to be there when you have tried me lord i'll come forth as gold i won't look at my symptoms i'll look towards your promise you may be getting old but he promised a new body your kids may be acting in ways that you don't you just don't know how to get a hold of him you don't know what to say but he promised your children would be there look at the promise tonight don't look at the symptoms well i just can't worship i just can't for the men you don't understand i can't i can't do that don't look at the symptoms quit giving regard to empty nothings look at the temple the temple of god was at the right hand of god today making intercession for you and i if he could do that on a temple made of hands how much more could we do that with christ our redeemer hallelujah heavenly father oh we're so glad that you touched us god glad to be in your house tonight my heart rejoices nowhere we're sad lord that brother robert lost his mother and maybe there's other things that have caused us some some sadness in this day that we've gone through in this week but lord in this moment we're not looking at those things we will not regard empty nothings we're going to look at your temple lord we're going to look at your promise you promised lord that we could be there with our families you promised you would give us strength for the journey you promised lord that that we would be a glorious church without spot or wrinkle if you promised it lord i believe that you're able to keep your word if you could keep the word of solomon an earthly king standing there in an earthly temple made of hands how much more would you keep the word of your own body that you created here on the earth jesus christ who come and said not one of them will be lost oh we're so grateful for that today lord lord i pray you'd help each and every person here today everyone that's watching oh god may help them to look beyond their symptoms lord and just begin to worship you lord begin to cry out to you and say oh god i may have been in the belly of hell i may i may be in a whale's belly right now there may be all kinds of stuff all around me but i serve a god who is a deliverer i serve a resurrection power i serve one who raised jonah up and raised christ up one day he'll raise me up i believe it lord i believe it lord i'm not gonna i'm not gonna worship my symptoms but i'll worship you with all of my heart i pray you granted tonight thank you for this word lord lord not not me poor representation i wish i could say it right but lord this word that you've given us this message how we love it or this this light that shined on the scriptures in our day we didn't know what lying vanities were but a prophet come and told us we're so grateful today i pray that you'd bring us closer to you i pray you'd help us lord to always regard you and not the lying vanities not the empty nothings in our life would you grant that right now lord lord we love you lord if there's one
