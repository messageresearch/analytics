[25:29] we ask it in Jesus name Amen
[25:34] amen god bless you this evening it's
[25:36] good to be in the house of the Lord on a
[25:38] Wednesday night we're gonna read from
[25:41] lamentations chapter 3 verses 21 through
[25:44] 26 also Deuteronomy chapter 7 verses 7
[25:50] through 10 lamentations chapter 3 and
[25:53] verse 21 and then Deuteronomy 7 and 7
[26:01] you believe the Lord wants to speak to
[26:04] you tonight a man I believe that's why
[26:06] we're here is because he wants to speak
[26:09] to his children whose arm is not short
[26:12] but the Bible says that he's able to
[26:14] reach us where we're at him and we can
[26:17] touch the hem of his garment and I'm so
[26:19] grateful for that tonight I'm grateful
[26:22] for the work of the Lord among us I pray
[26:24] that just continue and that we'd
[26:26] continue to feel the presence of the
[26:28] Lord and the services and and just
[26:30] gather together and be one body look we
[26:32] talked about Sunday morning and in
[26:34] coming one Accord in one place and
[26:36] anything can happen
[26:37] amen lamentations chapter 3 and verse 21
[26:41] this I recall to mind therefore have I
[26:45] hope
[26:47] it is of the Lord's mercies that we are
[26:49] not consumed because his Compassion's
[26:52] fail not aren't you glad for his
[26:55] Compassion's today notice he says they
[26:58] are new every morning so we don't use up
[27:02] the quota of compassion today it'll be
[27:06] new again in the morning they're new
[27:09] every morning great is thy faithfulness
[27:13] he says the Lord is my portion saith my
[27:16] soul therefore will I hope in him the
[27:21] Lord is good unto them that wait for him
[27:23] to the soul that seeketh him it was good
[27:27] that a man should both hope and quietly
[27:29] wait for the salvation of the Lord
[27:33] and then Deuteronomy 7 and 7 the Lord
[27:42] did not set his love upon you nor choose
[27:45] you because you were more in number than
[27:47] any people for you were the fewest of
[27:50] all people but because the Lord loved
[27:53] you and because he would keep the oath
[27:56] which he had sworn unto your father's
[27:58] that the Lord brought you out with a
[28:00] mighty hand and redeemed you out of the
[28:03] house a bondman from the hand of Pharaoh
[28:05] king of Egypt know therefore that the
[28:08] LORD thy God He is God the faithful God
[28:12] which keepeth covenant and mercy with
[28:15] them that love him and keep his
[28:17] Commandments to a thousand generations
[28:19] and repay them that hate him to their
[28:22] face to destroy them he will not be
[28:25] slack to him that ate of him he will
[28:28] repay him to his face I pray the Lord
[28:31] without his blessing - the word you may
[28:33] be seated this evening in the 1840s a
[28:41] man of the name of John Getty left his
[28:45] church in Canada and took his wife and
[28:47] two small children to the South Sea
[28:50] Islands to begin a mission work there
[28:53] they went more than 20,000 miles over
[28:57] land and sea and they arrived in the new
[29:00] head
[29:00] reduce Islands was an island chain full
[29:04] of cannibals and just a few months
[29:08] before 20 members of a British ship had
[29:12] been killed and eaten just a few months
[29:14] prior to their arrival on the mission
[29:16] field they faced the difficulty of
[29:20] learning a language that had no written
[29:21] form the constant threat of being killed
[29:26] slowly at first a few converts came and
[29:29] then soon many more began to receive the
[29:32] gospel over the years Getty translated
[29:36] the entire Bible into their native
[29:38] language and planted 25 churches many of
[29:42] those years he never heard from home
[29:44] never got a penny for his Labor's but he
[29:48] pastored a church there for many years
[29:51] and there's a plaque there in the church
[29:52] today that says this says when he landed
[29:55] in 1848 there were no Christians here
[29:58] and when he left in 1872 there were no
[30:02] heathen now that's the faithfulness of
[30:08] God that God would send a missionary
[30:13] from 20,000 miles away and somehow put
[30:16] it on his heart to go to an island and
[30:18] the South Seas where the people ate each
[30:21] other and I read a travel blog on this
[30:26] because I just wanted but a Caleb to see
[30:27] if it was true and and the story that I
[30:30] had read and I read a travel blog about
[30:32] this that someone had went there
[30:33] recently and she talked about how that
[30:36] they had went into the country and onto
[30:38] those islands and they wanted to see
[30:40] beyond the the tourism of the island and
[30:42] see what it was really like they walked
[30:45] deep into the jungle because the people
[30:47] there had originally been deep in the
[30:49] jungles that's where they lived and as
[30:53] she walked she said I couldn't help but
[30:54] think about the history of those islands
[30:56] and I was curious as to why these people
[30:59] ended up moving out of the jungle and
[31:01] into villages closer to the ocean and
[31:03] she asked her her guide it was a man
[31:06] named Tom a native look that question
[31:09] and he responded by saying the
[31:11] missionaries came and gave us the good
[31:13] news
[31:13] we had to move out of the darkness into
[31:16] the light so they abandoned their gods
[31:20] they abandoned even their homes and and
[31:22] moved and and today it's one of the most
[31:27] Christian societies I guess that there
[31:29] is as far as nominal Christians is in
[31:32] that place because of the faithfulness
[31:35] of God and the faithfulness of a man to
[31:39] follow the will of God
[31:41] those two things go together
[31:43] faithfulness is an attribute of God it's
[31:46] something that God is it's not something
[31:49] God does if something God is he is the
[31:53] faithful God the scripture said it's
[31:56] that it is his trustworthiness that he
[31:59] keeps all of his promises and remains
[32:01] the same every time he is approached so
[32:05] that a prophet of God could tell us that
[32:06] if we come to God with the same attitude
[32:09] as someone else did in the scripture
[32:11] that will receive like they did that
[32:14] even though it's not here in a physical
[32:16] form yet he's here that we can we can
[32:18] touch God we can reach God in a way that
[32:22] would change us that would meet our
[32:24] needs that we can look back and identify
[32:25] ourselves with someone who met God
[32:28] before and we can see we can meet God
[32:30] today because he's the same yesterday
[32:33] today and forever
[32:34] it's his faithfulness I want to look at
[32:38] some ways that God is faithful to us he
[32:42] is faithful with Allen to forgive us
[32:47] first on what an eyes that if we confess
[32:50] our sins he is faithful and just to
[32:55] forgive us our sins and to cleanse us
[32:58] from all unrighteousness if we confess
[33:02] he is faithful we come God's provide
[33:06] away and there's no other way to get to
[33:07] it but by repentance there is no way to
[33:10] the new birth but by repentance but if
[33:12] we repent he is faithful he is not
[33:17] giving us something extra but he's being
[33:20] true to his nature it's justwell job
[33:23] being true to his nature to forgive and
[33:25] we are not always
[33:27] faithful to forgive but God is and I'm
[33:30] so grateful for that to cleanse us from
[33:33] all unrighteousness so he's true to that
[33:36] he's also faithful to sanctify us the
[33:39] Bible says in first Thessalonians 5:23
[33:41] he said the very God of peace sanctify
[33:43] you wholly and I pray God your whole
[33:46] spirit and soul and body be preserved
[33:48] blameless until the coming of our Lord
[33:51] Jesus Christ so we don't have to live
[33:54] like the world he's faithful to sanctify
[33:57] us he said faithful is he that calleth
[33:59] you who also will do it the same God
[34:05] that calls you since the word to cleanse
[34:07] you by the washing of the water of the
[34:10] word so he's faithful to sanctify as
[34:13] he's faithful to keep us in Hebrews
[34:15] 10:23 he said let us hold fast the
[34:18] profession of our faith without wavering
[34:20] for he is faithful that promised Amen so
[34:26] he says let's hold on to what we have
[34:29] because he is faithful not because we
[34:31] are faithful but because he is faithful
[34:33] and let us consider one another to
[34:37] provoke unto love and to good works so
[34:40] this is part of abiding in his
[34:42] faithfulness is to consider one another
[34:45] to provoke one another to love into good
[34:47] works not forsaking the assembling of
[34:50] ourselves together as the manner of some
[34:52] is I wonder what he would say today the
[34:57] manner of some is but exhorting one
[34:58] another exhorting one another and so
[35:03] much the more as you see the Day
[35:05] approaching he's faithful we are tempted
[35:12] first Corinthians 10 and 13 says there's
[35:15] no temptation taken you but such as is
[35:18] common to man he said but God is
[35:21] faithful will not suffer you to be
[35:24] tempted above what you're able so
[35:27] grateful for this but will with the
[35:29] temptation also make a way to escape
[35:31] that you may be able to bear it if you
[35:35] go back to the original Greek on this
[35:36] first Paul paints a vivid Word picture
[35:38] that it's as if he will not
[35:41] drop you in the ocean so far from land
[35:44] that you can't swim to it he will not
[35:47] put you in a place where if you're
[35:49] willing to swim that you'll be able to
[35:52] get to make land oh I'm so grateful for
[35:55] that and so if God put John Getty on
[35:59] those islands he would not put him in a
[36:01] place where he couldn't make it if he
[36:03] was faithful and so he's faithful in
[36:08] temptation he's faithful in second
[36:10] Thessalonians three and three he is
[36:12] faithful to protect us says but the Lord
[36:14] is faithful who shall establish you and
[36:17] keep you from evil we ought to remember
[36:20] that on these times of viruses and
[36:23] things going around
[36:24] he said he's faithful to protect us he's
[36:27] faithful to establish you to keep you
[36:29] from evil and as I'm looking at these
[36:33] things so I realized that and I won't
[36:36] hold you long tonight so you just have
[36:38] to listen fast but I realized that it is
[36:42] not just his faithfulness but as
[36:45] children of God we have to be faithful
[36:48] as he is faithful it's not so much
[36:51] faithfulness that's born in us although
[36:54] there is that and we'll see that in a
[36:56] natural way but as he is faithful we
[37:00] take on the image of that faithfulness
[37:02] we bear his we are faithful if he is
[37:06] faithful we see that and we become
[37:09] faithful like he is so faithfulness is
[37:14] not just an attribute of God but it's
[37:16] something you see with the Harve around
[37:17] the children of God it is a mark of a
[37:21] son of God or a daughter of God that
[37:24] they're found faithful the Jews when
[37:30] they talked about faithfulness believed
[37:32] that a man could you could understand
[37:36] God's faithfulness by looking at God's
[37:38] people and they taught told a story
[37:42] about how there was a rabbi who dwelt in
[37:44] a certain city and some men came by who
[37:47] had two measures of barley and they
[37:50] wanted him to preserve it for them and
[37:52] afterwards they forgot about it in the
[37:54] window
[37:55] and every year the rabbi took the barley
[37:59] and didn't just keep it but he sewed it
[38:01] and he reaped it and he thrashed it and
[38:06] he laid it up in his granary he did this
[38:09] for seven years and finally the men
[38:12] remembered we list some barley at the
[38:15] rabbi's house and they come by to get it
[38:18] and when they did they didn't get just
[38:21] the barley that they left but they got
[38:24] the barley they left plus seven years
[38:27] worth of increase that's faithfulness
[38:31] and they said let us take our treasure
[38:35] and with all that had produced for seven
[38:38] years and the Jews said this they said
[38:40] dust from the faithfulness of man you
[38:42] may know the faithfulness of God well
[38:45] Jesus talks about that how that how that
[38:48] the one servant hid his his talent in
[38:52] the dirt but there was another who went
[38:54] out and got ten other towns five other
[38:56] tell us whatever that it was and brought
[38:58] it with him what was it it's
[39:00] faithfulness faithfulness to not just
[39:03] not just keep what God gives us but to
[39:06] actually increase on that now I want to
[39:12] go to a story in the Bible tonight and
[39:15] this is probably not normal preaching
[39:18] for me but Lords been leading me just in
[39:21] different ways it seems like and I can
[39:23] tell that you're praying and just really
[39:26] seeking the mind of the Lord because the
[39:28] Lord has been taking me in a little bit
[39:30] different directions every week and I
[39:33] like that I liked when you don't have to
[39:35] struggle to know what to preach but we
[39:37] were I was thinking of the story of Eli
[39:40] in the Bible and that may not seem like
[39:43] a story of faithfulness but just hang on
[39:45] for a moment you I was the high priest
[39:49] in Israel before the time of the prophet
[39:53] Samuel and he was a descendant of
[39:55] Aaron's fourth son it's the mark and you
[40:00] I had two sons main hophni and Phinehas
[40:04] and you I was a faithful priest he did
[40:07] everything that he should
[40:08] except for work come to his sons now the
[40:15] Bible tells us in 1st Samuel 2 and 12
[40:17] that the sons of Eli were sons of Belial
[40:20] and if you go but the Bruce looked that
[40:23] up it literally means they were
[40:24] worthless they were just worthless so he
[40:30] had to two kids that were in the
[40:32] ministry followed the family business
[40:34] but they were worthless since they knew
[40:37] not the Lord who god help us and I've
[40:43] said this before and it's not director
[40:45] than anyone here because we have
[40:46] wonderful ministry but but if you're not
[40:49] saved
[40:50] don't try to preach I just feel in
[40:53] general because you really mess things
[40:56] up if you don't have the Holy Ghost it's
[40:59] not a good time to be preaching to
[41:01] others if you haven't settled whether
[41:04] you believe the message or not you don't
[41:06] need to be preaching to someone else
[41:08] that needs to be settled and these young
[41:12] men didn't know the Lord and the Bible
[41:16] if you go down you can read it at home
[41:18] to save time but we find that these men
[41:21] mishandled the priests portion that was
[41:26] supposed to be given just a portion of
[41:28] the sacrifice and they mishandled that
[41:31] they took more than their share and
[41:33] didn't properly care for the people so
[41:37] much so that in 1st Samuel 2:17 it says
[41:39] wherefore the sin of the young men was
[41:41] very great before the Lord
[41:43] four men aboard the offering of the Lord
[41:45] in other words there were people who
[41:47] would no longer come to make a sacrifice
[41:50] because of the way that these young men
[41:53] treated the gospel the way you could say
[41:57] it this way the way they handled the
[41:58] word was such that men would no longer
[42:01] come to hear the of the word of the Lord
[42:05] men abhorred the offering of the Lord
[42:08] and the Bible says that that sin was
[42:10] very great because they mishandled God's
[42:13] portion of this applies also to us those
[42:18] that are lay at the end to the clergy
[42:20] don't mishandled
[42:21] portion no mishandle God fortune there's
[42:25] there's a part of your life there's a
[42:27] there's a our income and I would go so
[42:30] far as to say this and especially for us
[42:33] ministers but it's true of all of us
[42:34] were stewards we're given a portion god
[42:38] allows us a certain ability or a certain
[42:40] gift to make money and or to do a
[42:42] certain thing or to to sing or to preach
[42:45] or whatever that it is God gives that to
[42:47] us that ability and we're stewards of
[42:50] that gift and we don't want to miss
[42:53] handle God's portion we don't want to
[42:56] miss handle loss cause if God gives it
[42:59] to me I want to do like the rabbi did I
[43:01] want to show it I want to I want to make
[43:03] sure there's an increase because it
[43:06] comes from God I've told you before but
[43:08] the Darrell Ward who I respect very much
[43:10] and way he's handled himself in the
[43:11] ministry he told me said if you're a
[43:13] ten-cent preacher he said he only give
[43:15] God five cents you Rob God a five cents
[43:20] it's not just a great preacher that
[43:22] would do that they'd say well he could
[43:24] have had a great ministry but even a
[43:26] regular preacher but it applies to us in
[43:28] the laity as well maybe more so in some
[43:31] ways don't miss handle God's portion
[43:35] first Corinthians four and one tells us
[43:38] that he said let a man so account of us
[43:41] as of the ministers of Christ and
[43:42] stewards of the mysteries of God
[43:46] stewards of the mysteries of God he said
[43:49] moreover it is required in stewards that
[43:51] a man be found faithful steward would be
[43:53] someone who had said over a man's house
[43:56] and if he's going to be over a man's
[43:58] house every year it's going to give a
[44:00] count for the way he handles the man's
[44:03] business and we are stewards in the way
[44:06] Paul puts it is of the mysteries of God
[44:09] they've been given to us no words and
[44:11] not to others
[44:13] they've been revealed to us and not to
[44:15] others this message has been given to us
[44:18] and not to many other people we
[44:21] understand that we believe it and if we
[44:23] believe it and we understand it were
[44:25] stewards of it we're responsible for the
[44:28] message do we realize that church we're
[44:32] responsible for it
[44:33] it's
[44:34] to us and we realize God is faithful but
[44:37] he'll have faithful children God is
[44:40] faithful but in our faithful ministers
[44:42] God is faithful but they are faithful
[44:44] people sitting in the pews God is
[44:47] faithful but we must be found faithful
[44:50] he is faithful to do all the things that
[44:54] we talked about then if he is faithful
[44:55] he said greatest died faithfulness then
[44:58] if we're gonna protect that deity as we
[45:01] say
[45:02] walk out and speaking to me God's
[45:04] speaking we must be found faithful and I
[45:07] realized on a Wednesday night that I'm
[45:09] completely preaching to the choir
[45:15] preaching on faithfulness on a Wednesday
[45:17] night is just completely preaching to
[45:19] the choir but you know I think it does
[45:22] us good as well because we're
[45:26] accountable for this message when we go
[45:29] to the grocery store were accountable
[45:31] for this message whatever whenever we
[45:35] have a business dealing we're stewards
[45:37] of the mysteries of God and so we can't
[45:39] just do business like everybody else
[45:41] does now and so he said it's required
[45:46] that a man be found faithful in 2nd
[45:49] Timothy 2:2 he speaking to Timothy's
[45:53] that said the things that thou has heard
[45:54] of me among many witnesses the same
[45:56] commit thou to faithful men who shall be
[45:59] able to teach others also so he's saying
[46:01] this faithfulness has got to be handed
[46:03] down from generation to generation if
[46:05] we're stewards of the mysteries of God
[46:07] each generation must be found faithful
[46:09] not just the generation before we can
[46:12] look back and say well so-and-so is
[46:13] faithful that's the reason I believe the
[46:15] message today someone was faithful to
[46:17] preach someone was faithful to get the
[46:19] message out someone today has to be
[46:21] faithful and so 1st corinthians 4 and 17
[46:27] he says for this cause have I sent unto
[46:29] you timotheus who is my beloved son and
[46:33] faithful in the Lord who shall bring you
[46:36] into remembrance of my ways which be in
[46:38] Christ as I teach everywhere in every
[46:41] church we need to keep that pattern of
[46:45] faithfulness be faithfully taught
[46:48] and teach others faithfully but the sons
[46:53] of Eli didn't do that somehow I did not
[46:56] communicate to them or perhaps he did
[46:59] attempt and do his best
[47:01] he wasn't silent but he didn't do enough
[47:06] in 1st Samuel 2 in 22 it says now Eli
[47:11] was very old and heard all that his sons
[47:14] did into all Israel how they lay with
[47:16] the women that assembled at the door of
[47:18] the tabernacle of the congregation and
[47:20] he said unto them why do you such thanks
[47:23] for I hear of your evil dealings by all
[47:26] this people nay my sons it is no good
[47:30] report that I hear you make the Lord's
[47:32] people to transgress verse 25 if one man
[47:36] sinned against another the judge shall
[47:37] judge him but if a man sin against the
[47:40] Lord who shall entreat for him
[47:42] notwithstanding they hearkened not unto
[47:44] the voice of their father
[47:46] because the Lord would slay them and we
[47:51] find then that Eli spoke up but he
[47:54] didn't take care of the problem
[47:56] because a man of God came later and
[47:59] rebuked him for it and in verse 29 he
[48:02] said wherefore kick you at my sacrifice
[48:04] than it might offering or did you just
[48:07] treat it like it's nothing
[48:09] why do you kick it why do you treat my
[48:12] offering like you do which I have
[48:14] commanded in my habitation and honors
[48:16] thy sons above me to make yourselves fat
[48:20] with the chiefest of all the offerings
[48:22] of Israel my people he was more faithful
[48:25] to his family than he was to God say God
[48:28] help us today God help us today see a
[48:32] man in authority is responsible for
[48:34] those he has authority over and he's
[48:37] responsible not only for what he does
[48:39] but for everything that they do it's
[48:43] true if the buck stops somewhere the
[48:46] buck stops there means you get all the
[48:47] credit and all the blame or maybe more
[48:52] likely none of the credit and all the
[48:53] blame but you do you get it that's where
[48:58] it stops and so that's the way it was
[49:01] with you
[49:02] I am and for Samuel 234 he said this
[49:05] should be a sign unto thee to come upon
[49:07] that two sons on hophni and Phinehas in
[49:10] one day they shall die both of them and
[49:13] I will raise me up with faithful priests
[49:16] that shall do according to that which is
[49:18] in my heart and in my mind I will build
[49:21] him a shirt house and he show up before
[49:24] mine anointed forever now if we're going
[49:28] to it in a moment but you'll find that a
[49:29] man named Zadok fulfilled this and the
[49:31] natural in the Old Testament that he
[49:35] become a priest to David and to Solomon
[49:39] but it was Christ who fulfilled it in
[49:42] the spiritual and I'm so glad that
[49:45] Christ is a faithful priest I'm so glad
[49:48] that our Lord is faithful even when even
[49:51] when I'm not even when you're not he's
[49:54] faithful and he was so faithful that he
[49:57] did everything that his father wanted
[49:59] him to do and he was completely led by
[50:03] his father he said I will raise me up a
[50:05] faithful priest that shall do according
[50:07] to that which you sent my heart and in
[50:09] my mind I will build him a sure house he
[50:12] shall walk before mine anointed for ever
[50:15] and so we find that as I said is a dog
[50:19] fulfilled this from the natural and
[50:20] first grant first Chronicles 24 3 David
[50:24] distributed them he said both say talk
[50:26] to the sons of eleazar and eleazar was
[50:28] was Aaron's second or third son ELISA
[50:34] was Aaron's third son he said in a
[50:37] Himalaya the sons of Islam are that was
[50:39] Aaron's fourth Silas to family trees to
[50:44] lines in the family he said according to
[50:47] their offices in their service so
[50:49] Solomon and then in 1st Kings 2 27 we
[50:53] find that Solomon thrust out a bias are
[50:56] from being preached unto the Lord now a
[50:58] bias are was the next son of Tamar he
[51:02] was the next in the line of descendants
[51:05] rather of is amar and he thrust him out
[51:08] that he might fulfill the word of the
[51:10] Lord when she spake concerning the house
[51:12] of Eli in Shiloh and you'll find
[51:15] that a by authority priest was a co
[51:19] priest was laid off but he fat was found
[51:21] unfaithful in anointing the King that
[51:24] David wanted to have anointed David
[51:27] wanted Solomon to be king that's who God
[51:30] wanted to be king but here abaya thought
[51:33] was unfaithful and went with another son
[51:35] of David so we find out that it was
[51:40] according to the word of the Lord which
[51:42] he spoke concerning the house of Eli he
[51:44] said it won't continue in your house and
[51:47] it says in 1st Kings 2:35 the King put
[51:50] benaiah the son of jr. died in his room
[51:52] over the host and laid off the priests
[51:54] of the King put in the room of a by
[51:57] authority become the high priest and I'm
[52:00] telling you this and because faithful
[52:04] fathers teach their children to be
[52:06] faithful unfaithful fathers teach their
[52:10] children to be unfaithful and I know it
[52:15] comes down a little harsh because you
[52:16] can't do nothing about how you were
[52:18] raised
[52:18] you can't raise yourself right but it is
[52:24] true that there's a constant pattern on
[52:27] down to the scripture that people break
[52:29] those cycles see that faithfulness has
[52:32] got to start somewhere it's got to start
[52:37] somewhere that somebody's gonna be
[52:39] faithful I'm gonna be faithful if my dad
[52:42] was not faithful my mother was not
[52:43] faithful if my if my siblings were not
[52:46] faithful I'm gonna be faithful but yet
[52:50] in life you see that you see a father
[52:52] who's faithful in his business dealings
[52:54] teaches his son to be faithful in
[52:56] business dealings a son or a father or a
[53:00] mother who's faithful in certain areas
[53:02] in the way that they conduct themselves
[53:03] you see the children are faithful in
[53:05] those areas and the same is true of
[53:09] unfaithful fathers unfaithful mothers
[53:12] it's true also faithful pastors
[53:15] unfaithful pastors true faithful deacons
[53:19] unfaithful Deacons faithful you could
[53:21] take it into every office of the church
[53:24] unfaithful people teach other people to
[53:27] be unfaithful
[53:29] and faithful people teach faithfulness
[53:32] we know this is true of Abraham because
[53:36] when God is speaking and he says I want
[53:39] to reveal this thing to Abraham I don't
[53:41] want to hide it from him
[53:42] I don't you want to know the heart of
[53:44] God I believe we have the heart of God
[53:46] revealed in this hour but why did he
[53:49] reveal it to Abraham he said for I know
[53:51] him that he will command his children
[53:53] and his household after him and they
[53:56] shall keep the way of the Lord to do
[53:59] justice and judgments that the Lord may
[54:00] bring upon Abraham that would she has
[54:02] spoken of him so Abraham was faithful to
[54:08] teach his children and so he could begin
[54:10] a generation he was the beginning of
[54:14] that faithfulness and he was called
[54:16] faithful Abraham Aaron was the high
[54:21] priest in the wilderness and his sons
[54:24] were priests as well under Aaron we find
[54:28] remember I said that Eleazar was the
[54:30] third son of Aaron and if Tamar was the
[54:33] fourth the first two of Aaron's sons if
[54:36] you'll remember brought strange fire
[54:38] before the Lord and they were actually
[54:42] consumed and Aaron's other sons and
[54:46] Aaron were not even allowed to grieve
[54:47] for them because they brought strange
[54:50] fire it was such a sin against God if we
[54:56] could only realize that today the way
[54:58] people handle the word it's such a sin
[55:00] against God to handle the word in the
[55:02] wrong way and that goes beyond just
[55:05] preaching false doctrine - but the way
[55:09] in which we handle the word goes to our
[55:11] lives as well if we handle the word with
[55:14] unclean hands it's a great sin against
[55:16] God if we handle the word with an
[55:19] unrepentant heart it's a great sin
[55:20] against God if we handle the word and
[55:22] get into false doctrine is a great sin
[55:24] against God so he said in Moses in
[55:30] Leviticus 1016 now we find that those
[55:34] are those two brought strange fire no he
[55:36] had to others and they displeased the
[55:38] Lord because in that timeframe in
[55:41] Leviticus 1016
[55:42] that Moses sought diligently to go to
[55:44] the sin offering behold it was barked
[55:47] now he left them instructions said boys
[55:49] whatever you do now remember your
[55:52] brothers just got burn up because they
[55:53] didn't follow instructions he said
[55:56] whatever you do leave take that goat off
[55:59] the fire before it burns up because you
[56:03] got to eat of it so you got to eat that
[56:07] sin-offering
[56:08] that's right and so he said whatever you
[56:12] do take it don't let it burn and guess
[56:16] what
[56:17] Moses starts looking for the goat
[56:19] where's the goat they look diligently
[56:21] for it and I can see Elly easier and
[56:25] it's the mark I shaking in their boots
[56:26] at this point because they left the fire
[56:29] going too long how could you make that
[56:33] mistake after seeing your brother's burn
[56:34] up but maybe it was during that time
[56:37] they were so shook up and just in the
[56:38] confusion of the moment that they failed
[56:41] to be faithful to the offering and Moses
[56:45] got angry about that and he says
[56:47] wherefore have you not eaten the sin
[56:49] offering of the holy place seeing it as
[56:51] must most holy and God has given it to
[56:53] you to bear the iniquity of the
[56:54] congregation to make atonement for them
[56:57] before the Lord said we sure job so you
[57:03] could find then now look those two lines
[57:05] the priests a bias on the side it was in
[57:08] that line of Eli with that had the
[57:10] hophni and Phinehas who are unfaithful
[57:13] in their duties and was taken away from
[57:16] them but also Zadok his father Eleazar
[57:21] was not faithful in his duties either so
[57:25] who you gonna turn to somebody's got to
[57:28] start it somebody's got to stand there
[57:33] and say I'm tired of getting rebuked by
[57:34] Moses every time we turn around just
[57:37] mess this up all the time I'm tired of
[57:40] him having to tell us every time to take
[57:41] the goat off somebody has to discharge
[57:44] the officers of a priest right open no
[57:50] matter how much they tried they could
[57:51] never do it the way God wanted it done
[57:53] why there was one coming
[57:55] there was a faithful high priest who was
[57:58] coming who could be touched by the
[57:59] feeling of our infirmities but now these
[58:04] were unfaithful but this cycle had to be
[58:07] broken somewhere what happened in
[58:09] eleazar's family well he had a son named
[58:11] Finny house Anthony Haase was a man when
[58:17] there was a plague in Israel you all
[58:18] know the story because of the doctrine
[58:20] of Balaam there been the intermarriage
[58:21] had come in and and and finish off
[58:24] season in his zeal he does something
[58:26] about it
[58:27] he's Stephanie he he just isn't willing
[58:31] to let it go on he wants to stop it and
[58:34] because he did something about it and I
[58:37] love the fact there was him and not his
[58:38] dad it was him and not the others it was
[58:41] here not even Moses did anything about
[58:44] it but there was a plague going on and
[58:46] pheenoh house said witch somebody's got
[58:48] to fix this so he does something about
[58:51] and listen to what God spoke to Moses
[58:53] and says about phineas he said the Lord
[58:56] spoken to Moses saying if any hostile
[58:58] son of Eleazar the son of Aaron the
[59:00] priest had turned my wrath away from the
[59:02] children of Israel while he was zealous
[59:04] for my sake among them that I consume
[59:07] not the children of Israel in my
[59:09] jealousy our church survived if you
[59:12] could only hear my heart if there'd be
[59:14] somebody that could be like Phinney
[59:15] hosts today that could stand up in our
[59:17] when when the world's gone crazy and
[59:20] when it seems like everybody mishandles
[59:22] the word everybody does things in the
[59:23] wrong way but there could be somebody
[59:25] that could stand up and say it's for me
[59:27] in my house we're gonna serve the Lord s
[59:30] for me we're gonna do this thing right
[59:32] we're gonna love people we're gonna
[59:34] treat people right we're gonna do the
[59:35] right things we're gonna preach the word
[59:37] the way it's written we're gonna stay
[59:40] with the message of the hour why because
[59:42] I don't want to be an unfaithful priest
[59:44] I don't want to be an unfaithful Stewart
[59:45] I want to handle them things that I've
[59:47] been given these mysteries of God with
[59:49] faithful hands somebody's got to do it
[59:54] he said in this hour when people are
[59:59] being lost all around us and people are
[1:00:01] leaving the message all around us
[1:00:03] someone has got to stand up and say not
[1:00:06] me not my generation
[1:00:08] the plague needs to stop somebody's got
[1:00:17] to be the reason they read somebody's
[1:00:21] got to be faithful numbers 25 and 12 he
[1:00:26] said wherefore say and this was an act
[1:00:30] of extreme you might say warfare and
[1:00:34] active violence if you could put it that
[1:00:37] way that he did but the scripture says
[1:00:40] in the days of John it says the Kingdom
[1:00:43] of Heaven suffereth violence and the
[1:00:45] violent take it by force and it's a hard
[1:00:48] scripture to understand but it means
[1:00:49] that those that are willing to do
[1:00:51] something those who are willing to be
[1:00:55] desperate about something those that are
[1:00:58] willing to stand up and be counted as
[1:01:00] children of God those are the ones who
[1:01:03] received the kingdom of heaven
[1:01:05] and so here someone was jealous for his
[1:01:08] God he said and he said behold I given
[1:01:12] to him my covenant of peace because he
[1:01:15] was willing to stand up because he was
[1:01:17] willing to go through the fire because
[1:01:20] he was willing to do what needed to be
[1:01:22] done he said I'll give him a covenant of
[1:01:24] peace and he shall have it and his seed
[1:01:28] after him it meant and Sadek was his
[1:01:32] seed after him that all these years
[1:01:35] later the pie priesthood would stay in
[1:01:38] the line of Islam are until one day
[1:01:40] God's Word came true and the line there
[1:01:44] was unfaithful kept being unfaithful but
[1:01:46] these are started with Finney house
[1:01:47] became faithful and remained faithful
[1:01:50] even generations later oh my I think
[1:01:55] it's time we started faithful
[1:01:56] generations some of you may be you're
[1:02:00] part of a faithful generation it's up to
[1:02:02] us to continue a faithful generation he
[1:02:08] was zealous for his God so he shall have
[1:02:10] it in a seat after him even the Covenant
[1:02:12] of an everlasting priesthood because he
[1:02:15] was zealous for his God and made an
[1:02:17] atonement for the children of Israel he
[1:02:20] broke the cycle
[1:02:22] and his descendants a dock maid Solomon
[1:02:25] King somebody is going to see us through
[1:02:31] there's gonna be somebody's gonna be
[1:02:33] ministers and lay people in churches
[1:02:35] that are gonna be present at the time
[1:02:38] hey man when our Lord returns to earth
[1:02:41] again if we could put it that way
[1:02:43] somebody's got to be found faithful he
[1:02:46] said well I find faith when I return
[1:02:48] somebody has got to be found faithful in
[1:02:51] the hour of the end and in order for
[1:02:54] that to happen
[1:02:55] somebody's got to break the cycle and
[1:02:57] begin faithful generations
[1:03:00] listen Christ had to come no man could
[1:03:08] be as faithfulness as Christ good God
[1:03:12] came down in flesh and was tempted so he
[1:03:16] could be counted as faithful high priest
[1:03:18] the Bible in Hebrews 2:17 says wherefore
[1:03:22] in all things it behooves him to be made
[1:03:24] like unto his brethren that he might be
[1:03:27] a merciful and faithful high priest in
[1:03:31] things pertaining to God to make
[1:03:34] reconciliation for the sins of the
[1:03:37] people now look when do we need him the
[1:03:42] most you know we think about great times
[1:03:46] and we went to these meetings this last
[1:03:48] week and just really enjoyed that in the
[1:03:49] presence of God we had a wonderful
[1:03:51] service Sunday morning just the presence
[1:03:53] of God was here but when do we need the
[1:03:56] mercies of God every morning every
[1:04:01] morning and see he said he come to be
[1:04:04] tempted so he could be a faithful high
[1:04:06] priest that we would know that in the
[1:04:11] morning he'll be there do you ever think
[1:04:14] about that
[1:04:14] in the morning he'll be there when I go
[1:04:19] to bed at night he'll be there if I mess
[1:04:22] up he'll be there
[1:04:24] if I fall he'll be there
[1:04:28] think about the faithfulness of God for
[1:04:31] a moment that he is a faithful high
[1:04:33] priest whenever I need healing he
[1:04:35] there whether there's a church service
[1:04:38] or not he's there when I'm down he's
[1:04:41] there David said if I make my bed in
[1:04:44] hell behold palette there if I rise up
[1:04:48] on leaves for the morning behold thou
[1:04:50] art there I can't go anywhere and lose
[1:04:54] him he's always with me he's always very
[1:04:56] faithful he's faithful so much so that
[1:05:02] he will not do something just to make a
[1:05:05] temporary thing in my life but he does
[1:05:07] what's best for me
[1:05:09] he's faithful and answering my prayers
[1:05:11] whether he answers from the way I think
[1:05:14] I should he should or not he still
[1:05:16] answered my prayers because he's a
[1:05:19] faithful high priest a faithful high
[1:05:22] priest in things pertaining to God to
[1:05:25] make reconciliation for the sins of the
[1:05:28] people the Bible says he's a faithful
[1:05:31] witness he says in Revelations 1:5 and
[1:05:35] from Jesus Christ to his be faithful
[1:05:37] witness and the first begotten of the
[1:05:40] Dead and the Prince of the kings of the
[1:05:43] earth and to him that loved us and
[1:05:45] washed us from our sins in his own blood
[1:05:47] what is it he remains faithful to the
[1:05:49] word and he's a faithful witness he said
[1:05:52] I died and rose again according to the
[1:05:55] Word of God he's a faithful witness of
[1:05:57] the resurrection he's a faithful witness
[1:06:01] he remains faithful to his word and the
[1:06:05] Bible says in Revelation chapter 19
[1:06:09] verse 11 it said I saw heaven open
[1:06:12] behold a white horse and he that sat
[1:06:16] upon him was called faithful hey man
[1:06:21] what that tells me is he'll be faithful
[1:06:24] with Isaac to the end to the end he's
[1:06:28] not gonna be just faithful to brother
[1:06:30] Brandon's generation and not to mine but
[1:06:33] when he comes back on a white horse he's
[1:06:35] still faithful he that said upon him was
[1:06:38] called faithful and true hey man he
[1:06:41] stayed true to the word because he was
[1:06:43] the word and then righteousness he doth
[1:06:45] judge
[1:06:47] and make so he's faithful and he
[1:06:51] comes back like he said he would hey Ben
[1:06:55] because he's faithful we believe in the
[1:06:59] literal coming of Christ because we
[1:07:01] believe he's faithful we believe in a
[1:07:04] millennial reign of a thousand years
[1:07:06] because we believe he's faithful to his
[1:07:08] word we believe that God sent a prophet
[1:07:11] in Malachi 4 because we believe God was
[1:07:13] faithful to his word we believe there
[1:07:16] would come a moment but the David one
[1:07:17] will change in a moment of twinkling of
[1:07:19] an eye because he's faithful to his word
[1:07:23] he's faithful but he's not the only one
[1:07:27] that's faithful listen to this
[1:07:29] Revelation chapter 17 and 14 it said
[1:07:32] these shall make war with the lamb and
[1:07:34] the lamb shall overcome them for he is
[1:07:38] Lord of lords King of Kings and they
[1:07:42] that are with him hey Ben I want to be
[1:07:46] one of those babe Ellen that are with
[1:07:50] him are called and we like that we like
[1:07:55] that we're the cult we have to be called
[1:07:58] her we can't be with him we are the
[1:08:00] called only those that are called or
[1:08:02] ride with him they are called their
[1:08:05] chosen only those that are chosen will
[1:08:07] be there with him and faithful faithful
[1:08:14] well the Brandon says this in the fourth
[1:08:16] seal and I purposely I could have read
[1:08:19] many quotes tonight but I purposely just
[1:08:21] to make this shorter so I wouldn't wear
[1:08:23] you out on a Wednesday night I purposely
[1:08:26] kept many of them out but this one I
[1:08:27] wanted to include he said those with him
[1:08:30] are in white horses also and they are
[1:08:36] called hey man
[1:08:38] the chosen before the foundation of the
[1:08:41] world and they are faithful to the word
[1:08:46] he said I like that one
[1:08:49] hey Ben he said cold chosen before the
[1:08:54] foundation of the world he said and then
[1:08:56] faithful to the word by their own
[1:09:00] choosing
[1:09:05] every morning when Jesus woke up when he
[1:09:09] was here on the earth you know what he
[1:09:10] did he chose to be faithful when the
[1:09:14] devil come and tempted him and showed
[1:09:16] him all the all the things that were out
[1:09:18] there and all the the kingdoms of the
[1:09:20] earth and said if you'll bow your knee
[1:09:22] to me how come he chose to be faithful
[1:09:24] see but he was God he made a choice to
[1:09:26] be faithful he went down there in the
[1:09:30] garden and he cried the Lord if it be
[1:09:32] possible let this cup pass from me but
[1:09:35] then he said nevertheless not my will be
[1:09:37] done but yours Lord he chose to be
[1:09:41] faithful brother Brown said we were
[1:09:42] called before the foundation of the
[1:09:44] world were chosen before the foundation
[1:09:46] of the world but we choose to be
[1:09:49] faithful I just want to I just want that
[1:09:53] to sink into our hearts today we choose
[1:09:56] to be faithful we choose to follow this
[1:09:59] example of faithfulness faithful to the
[1:10:02] word by their choosing all stimulated
[1:10:06] with new wine and all just riding right
[1:10:09] along coming down to meet him every day
[1:10:15] you wake up and you have a choice am I
[1:10:19] gonna be faithful to the word today
[1:10:21] whether I feel like it or whether I
[1:10:23] don't there may be an easier path but am
[1:10:28] I gonna be faithful to the word there
[1:10:30] may not feel like going to church but am
[1:10:35] I gonna be faithful are you with me now
[1:10:38] now I'm not faithful to a pastor I'm not
[1:10:41] gonna be riding on one of those white
[1:10:42] horses because I was faithful to a man
[1:10:44] I'm faithful to the Word of God I'm not
[1:10:50] gonna I'm not gonna be there because I I
[1:10:51] followed the footsteps of a prophet but
[1:10:54] I followed the footsteps of God I was
[1:10:57] faithful because he is faithful and I
[1:11:01] saw that example of faithfulness and it
[1:11:03] stimulated something in my life to be
[1:11:05] faithful so I made a choice every day
[1:11:09] every day we have a choice to remain
[1:11:12] faithful
[1:11:14] yet his faithfulness to us is such that
[1:11:17] when we are not faithful his
[1:11:20] faithfulness manifests itself in our
[1:11:22] life you think about the grace of God
[1:11:26] His mercies are new every morning and
[1:11:30] you wake up in one morning you don't
[1:11:32] read the Bible like you should you don't
[1:11:34] pray like you shouldn't maybe you do
[1:11:35] that for weeks maybe you do it for
[1:11:37] months or for years and I'll break this
[1:11:40] fear tonight it's just a small group so
[1:11:42] you don't tell nobody okay but preachers
[1:11:45] do that too they do that too you get in
[1:11:50] a rut where you just don't do what you
[1:11:52] should but he's faithful and even during
[1:11:58] those times when we are not he's
[1:12:00] faithful and so we keep plowing we keep
[1:12:04] planting seed like demanded in the
[1:12:07] Hebrides Highland we keep talking to
[1:12:09] people we keep inviting them to church
[1:12:11] we keep sowing the seed and tilling the
[1:12:14] ground whether it's hard or whether it's
[1:12:16] easy it doesn't matter he doesn't look
[1:12:18] at our success he looks at our
[1:12:21] faithfulness whether the church's fault
[1:12:24] of the church is empty have we been
[1:12:26] faithful whether we see a million souls
[1:12:30] saved or 1 have we been faithful I think
[1:12:35] of the story of a Scottish minister who
[1:12:40] preached he had a church and he preached
[1:12:42] a full year and that year only one soul
[1:12:45] come to Christ he was a young boy about
[1:12:49] 12 years old just a boy from the church
[1:12:53] one boy in the whole year came to Christ
[1:12:56] and all that year he he told he worked
[1:13:00] with the people and no one else came and
[1:13:02] the Deacons and the and the officers of
[1:13:05] the church come to him at the end of the
[1:13:07] year and they said this has been a bad
[1:13:09] year the church hasn't grown and he wept
[1:13:12] over it he said what am I gonna do and
[1:13:14] he was about ready to quit but somehow
[1:13:17] he found the strength to go on
[1:13:18] the boys name was Robert Moffat who
[1:13:22] became one of the fathers of African
[1:13:24] missions who converted thousand
[1:13:27] of souls in foreign lands to to God why
[1:13:32] because one little minister was found
[1:13:34] faithful there's a song that was written
[1:13:37] not long ago actually that says and I
[1:13:40] like the song he says I like to meet the
[1:13:42] preacher who prayed for the preacher who
[1:13:44] prayed for me I like to talk to the
[1:13:48] person who witness to the person who
[1:13:50] witness to me because somebody was
[1:13:53] faithful somebody was faithful to
[1:13:55] continue to live the message somebody
[1:13:57] was faithful so my kids have a chance to
[1:14:00] live for God because somebody and
[1:14:02] another generation was faithful this
[1:14:03] church has a chance or an opportunity
[1:14:05] rather to do what's right and live for
[1:14:08] God because somebody somewhere was
[1:14:09] faithful when it would be easier to just
[1:14:13] shut the doors and go home but
[1:14:16] somebody's faithful but that
[1:14:18] faithfulness that choice of faithfulness
[1:14:20] is not just something you did last year
[1:14:22] but it's something you have to do every
[1:14:24] day just like it's mercies are new every
[1:14:27] morning your faithfulness your resolve
[1:14:29] you've got to be resolved every morning
[1:14:31] you know how you do that you keep your
[1:14:33] my eyes off everything down here and you
[1:14:35] look at that white horse you say I'm
[1:14:37] gonna be one of those I'm gonna be one
[1:14:40] of those that come riding back with him
[1:14:41] on white horses I may not understand it
[1:14:44] or be able to explain it fully but I'm
[1:14:45] gonna be one of those it was called who
[1:14:47] was chosen and who chose to be faithful
[1:14:50] I'm gonna be one who was faithful it may
[1:14:55] take some Wednesday nights it may take
[1:14:57] some some Sundays I don't feel like it
[1:14:59] it may take sometimes when I testify to
[1:15:03] people and I don't think even should but
[1:15:06] I have to be faithful in Matthew 25 and
[1:15:12] 21 speaks of a faithful servant is that
[1:15:15] his Lord said unto Him well done thou
[1:15:18] good and faithful servant thou has been
[1:15:21] faithful over a few things I will make
[1:15:23] thee ruler over many things enter thou
[1:15:26] into the joy of thy Lord I've often
[1:15:32] wondered but the Branham said I like to
[1:15:35] hear him when he stood and stretched his
[1:15:38] arms that day
[1:15:39] and said coming to me oh ye that labor
[1:15:42] and are heavy-laden he said now that was
[1:15:45] past well done he said but well done my
[1:15:51] good and faithful servant is still in
[1:15:54] the future
[1:15:56] hey bad and as blessed as it would be to
[1:16:00] go back with Harvey and be able to hear
[1:16:02] him say coming to me it'll be so much
[1:16:05] more of a blessing to get there on that
[1:16:07] day and hear him to say well done well
[1:16:11] done if we enter if we go through life
[1:16:16] and we struggle and I know some of you
[1:16:18] do and I know sometimes you struggle to
[1:16:20] make to try to take God's portion even
[1:16:23] because you barely make a living I know
[1:16:25] you struggle sometimes even make it to
[1:16:27] the house of God maybe there's pain in
[1:16:28] your body and you struggling yet I find
[1:16:30] the people to go through the most
[1:16:32] sometimes are the most faithful but will
[1:16:36] you struggle to do that and I realize
[1:16:37] that but you're not doing it for me
[1:16:39] you're not doing it for these four walls
[1:16:42] in a building called a church but you're
[1:16:44] doing it because you want to be there on
[1:16:46] that day you're doing it because there's
[1:16:49] something inside of you his faithfulness
[1:16:50] in your life inspires you to
[1:16:52] faithfulness in yours just like the
[1:16:55] example that phen AHA said for his
[1:16:58] generations on down was an example to
[1:17:02] them to say not to be faithful so the
[1:17:04] example that Christ said is an example
[1:17:06] to us to be faithful you hearing me
[1:17:10] today right I struggle with it sometimes
[1:17:14] because you'll say why I just don't feel
[1:17:17] like it today well if you have a gift in
[1:17:20] your life and you only use it when you
[1:17:22] feel like it you're never gonna feel
[1:17:24] like it because the devil is gonna see
[1:17:27] to that
[1:17:29] and part of overcoming is overcoming
[1:17:33] when you don't feel like it well done my
[1:17:36] good and faithful servant
[1:17:37] I want to hear it I like it when you
[1:17:40] tell me well done it's a good sermon I
[1:17:43] just that's the flash but I like it
[1:17:45] the flesh likes to hear it brother
[1:17:48] Branham said he liked to hear it but
[1:17:50] then he also said is bad for you so
[1:17:52] now I like to hear it like to get those
[1:17:55] Pat's on the back I'm human but all how
[1:17:58] much more I want to hear well done if
[1:18:04] nobody ever says it again here if this
[1:18:05] is the last sermon I ever preached I
[1:18:07] want to hear well done my good and
[1:18:11] faithful servant he didn't say my good
[1:18:14] and prosperous servant my good and
[1:18:16] successful servant but my good and
[1:18:19] faithful servant he said I'm living to
[1:18:26] hear that said the musicians would come
[1:18:31] there was a hymn written back in the
[1:18:35] 1920s which was actually a poem I'm
[1:18:40] gonna read it as a poem tonight but it
[1:18:45] was written off of the text that we read
[1:18:48] as a man by the name of Thomas Chisolm
[1:18:51] was born in a log cabin in Franklin
[1:18:53] Kentucky in 1866 his family was dirt
[1:18:57] poor he was not able to acquire a very
[1:18:59] good education he went to a little bit
[1:19:02] of school but he never got past
[1:19:04] elementary school he became a preacher
[1:19:07] but he was too frail to continue in the
[1:19:09] ministry his body just wouldn't let him
[1:19:11] do it he made his living selling
[1:19:14] insurance seemed like a busted life
[1:19:20] seemed like a gift that just could never
[1:19:23] go anywhere but later in life he not out
[1:19:29] of any particular thing sometimes hymn
[1:19:32] writers and songwriters are inspired by
[1:19:34] something that happens like the story of
[1:19:36] it is well with my soul and that a door
[1:19:38] if ik thing happened to the man and he
[1:19:40] lost his family but this was not born of
[1:19:44] any particular thing but he just
[1:19:47] realized one day that every morning when
[1:19:49] he woke up God was faithful he said I
[1:19:54] realized every morning he's still there
[1:19:56] whether I'm failing in school or whether
[1:20:00] I'm failing as a preacher whether I'm
[1:20:03] failing as a hymn writer
[1:20:06] failing as an insurance salesman it
[1:20:07] didn't matter every morning he said God
[1:20:11] is faithful and he wrote these words he
[1:20:14] said great is thy faithfulness
[1:20:17] o God my father there is no shadow of
[1:20:20] turning with thee thou changest not thy
[1:20:25] Compassion's they fail not as thou hast
[1:20:30] been thou forever will be the course
[1:20:35] says great is thy faithfulness great is
[1:20:37] thy faithfulness morning by morning new
[1:20:39] mercies I see oh I have needed thy hand
[1:20:44] hath provided great is thy faithfulness
[1:20:47] Lord unto me but the harvest sometimes
[1:20:52] this hymn has gotten me through some
[1:20:54] really dark times in my life when I feel
[1:20:57] like everything's everything is going
[1:20:59] wrong and I get alone to myself and I
[1:21:02] wake up in the morning and somehow it's
[1:21:03] running through my head in spite of all
[1:21:05] the discouragement says morning by
[1:21:08] morning new mercies I see all I have
[1:21:12] needed thy hand hath provided great is
[1:21:18] thy faithfulness Lord unto me the last
[1:21:21] verse says pardon for sin and a peace
[1:21:24] that endureth that own dear presence to
[1:21:27] cheer and to guide strains for today and
[1:21:30] bright hope for tomorrow blessings all
[1:21:33] mine with 10,000 beside it's a good song
[1:21:41] but Thomas Chisolm wrote another song
[1:21:44] this have always been dear to my heart
[1:21:45] and I never connected the two until this
[1:21:47] week
[1:21:48] he also wrote a song and I'll just read
[1:21:52] the chorus it goes like this he said ode
[1:21:54] to be like thee Oh to be like thee
[1:21:57] blessed Redeemer purest how hard come in
[1:22:02] thy sweetness coming thy fullness stamp
[1:22:05] thine own image deep on my heart great
[1:22:11] is thy faithfulness but I want to be
[1:22:13] like that Lord your mercies are new
[1:22:17] every morning but I want to wake up
[1:22:19] every
[1:22:19] morning with resolve in my heart I'm
[1:22:22] gonna be faithful from now on I'm gonna
[1:22:26] be faithful I'm gonna let the image of
[1:22:29] Christ be so deeply stamped in my life
[1:22:31] until faithfulness can spring from it
[1:22:34] maybe so in our hearts today
[1:22:37] let's pray Heavenly Father we love you
[1:22:41] tonight we're so thankful for your mercy
[1:22:48] and your grace I don't always feel like
[1:22:53] preaching but Lord somehow you make a
[1:22:57] way we're so grateful for the times like
[1:23:01] Sunday when everything's so free and we
[1:23:04] feel your presence and other times it's
[1:23:07] hard it's gonna be all of us have been
[1:23:10] to services that are hard and you have
[1:23:12] to press through demons to even get a
[1:23:15] word through but Lord whether it's the
[1:23:19] good or the bad it doesn't matter you
[1:23:21] promised that you would be with us every
[1:23:23] day morning by morning your mercies are
[1:23:26] new and we're so grateful Lord we're so
[1:23:31] grateful we want to be like you Lord we
[1:23:36] don't want to be caught up in a cycle of
[1:23:39] unfaithfulness Lord we want to be like
[1:23:43] you we want to stand in this hour and be
[1:23:46] faithful to the word help us Lord
[1:23:49] because we know it will only be those
[1:23:51] who are faithful but you new heart
[1:23:54] somehow you knew before you call this
[1:23:56] and before do you chose us because you
[1:23:59] said not one of them would be lost
[1:24:00] somehow you knew that we would choose to
[1:24:03] be faithful we're so grateful Lord in
[1:24:06] those moments when we're not as faithful
[1:24:09] as we should be
[1:24:10] I pray you would help us Lord I pray you
[1:24:14] to help us to realize that your mercies
[1:24:16] are still there every morning that we
[1:24:18] wake up but the men how do you know that
[1:24:23] there's still mercy someone had asked me
[1:24:26] that question Lord I could say because
[1:24:30] every morning when I wake up there's
[1:24:31] mercy every day when I mess up in some
[1:24:37] way there's still mercy and if there's
[1:24:40] mercy for me there's mercy for someone
[1:24:42] else I may not know exactly how or why
[1:24:46] but I know somehow there's mercy if I'm
[1:24:49] able to make it
[1:24:50] surely God can save if he could save me
[1:24:54] the chiefest of sinners as Paul said if
[1:24:58] you saved the chief of sinners how much
[1:24:59] more just the rank-and-file sinner god I
[1:25:04] pray that you would just help us to
[1:25:06] recognize that in our lives recognize
[1:25:08] your mercy recognize your grace father
[1:25:11] even the grace to be able to preacher to
[1:25:13] sing or to talk her to walk the grace to
[1:25:16] be able to come to the house of God
[1:25:17] grace to be able to get up in the
[1:25:19] morning alright even though our bonus my
[1:25:22] ache and old age may creep on with some
[1:25:25] but Oh God we know you're faithful
[1:25:27] faithful to the end because you come
[1:25:30] back and you are faithful and true we
[1:25:33] thank you for that lord help us to
[1:25:36] remain faithful to the message of the
