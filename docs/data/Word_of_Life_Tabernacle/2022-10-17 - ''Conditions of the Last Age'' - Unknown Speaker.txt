it's it's certainly good to be here and I enjoyed that sermon this morning my goodness that was good did you enjoy it man sure out did himself and I know I give him a hard time but this is Pastor appreciation month and we appreciate our pastor and uh and I I on a serious note he's he's one of my favorites um so I really enjoy it you know it's uh one of my favorites that's horrible isn't it he's my favorite you know but uh no I I I'm thankful to have a brother that I can point to and say he stands right on the word of God preaches the truth stands by the message of the hour and I'm thankful for that thankful to be a part of it and uh thankful to be in the church here with each one of you you have been suffering with me for this month a year coming up here and speaking to you and there's been a a good blooper reel that's been created during that time and and y'all have put up with me I appreciate it brother West good to see you all and your family tonight God bless you if you could turn to Revelations chapter 3 and verses 14 we'll read through the 22nd verse there and unto the angel of the Church of the laodiceans write these things saith the amen the faithful and the true witness the beginning of the creation of God I Know Thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would that thou were cold or hot so then because Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth and because thou sayest I am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable poor blind and naked I counsel thee to buy of me gold try it in the fire that thou must be rich in white raiment that thou must be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with I save that thou mayest see as many as I love I rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and will sup with him and he with me to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and am sit down with my father and his throne he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches may the Lord add his Blessing to the word you may be seated and I would just like you to see there he tells you the condition that the church would be in at this time and he also tells you what you need to do to overcome that age and that Spirit of the age that we see and I think in this age you'll see that a form of godliness is rampant in the land and and what you'll see is there's a lot of church Hannity there's a lot of there's a lot of churches but what there is is a lack of the real moving of the spirit of God in the churches it is a form of godliness but they have denied the power thereof and what it is is their eyes have been filmed over by by a spirit of the age that is actually causing blindness throughout the whole land and you'll see people and they go to church and they just don't even understand I had a person tell me this week I believe she told me she was Methodist and and she was sitting there smoking a cigarette and telling me how you know she goes to Methodist because it's the closest church to her area but then you get to thinking they don't they don't go to church to hear the word they're going because they feel like they should it makes them a better person maybe but really what we're coming here for is not to just be a better member of society although that's good but we are here to to Really enter in and become an overcomer of this age because he said to him that overcometh will I grant to sit on the throne and we see brother Branham uh excuse me second Timothy 3 would say it like this verse one he said this snow also then in the last days perilous times shall come for men shall be lovers of their own uh excuse me I'm on a steel brother Andrew's line here and say dumb devil when I messed up on my tablet he said for men shall be lovers of their own selves Covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful Unholy without natural affection do we see that in the land today he said uh false accusers incontinent Fierce despisers of those that are good traitors heady high-minded lovers of Pleasures more than lovers of God having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof now here's the Commandment part from such turn away he says that that would be happening but we are called to be a little higher than that today it doesn't make us a better person we're all Sinners saved by grace but what we are is an overcomer of one of the greatest times of of all ages this is the greatest age to live in because we have been called to overcome that age and brother Branham says it like this he said he said we've enjoyed about a 15-year Revival which according to history is longer than any Revival has ever lasted to my knowing he said usually Revival lasts about three years he said then it gets scattered but believing that this is one of the last great revivals that the world will receive he said it's come in the last stage the way to see an age at the end of the Pentecostal dispensation he said and I believe the church is now going into its lukewarmness as the Bible predicted and he goes on down to say he said I'm even surprised in a church here he said you've got people that's so cold-hearted they can't even shed a tear no more he said they just become so indifferent it's a spirit of the age now remember we're not we're not wrestling against flesh and blood but against spirits and principalities of the air and that's what has come upon us now it's not so much our brother that's fighting us through our sister that's fighting us but it's the spirit of the age that's fighting us and it's trying to take hold of our lives and take hold of our children and what it is we've got to overcome that age if we're ever going to make it any farther and I was thinking the song that was saying there sister Carla one of my favorite songs I'm going to make it because the Bible already told me I could make it but there's a way to be an overcomer and we must get ourselves in tune with the word of God to overcome the evils of this age and brother Branham says in the message leadership 1965 he says now look every three years after a messages went forth from God he said they organized and this has been 20 years and there's no no organization he said and it won't see he said now the shuck has to pull away give the weed a chance to lay before the sun to ripen he said the message coming right back into the church again forming the body of Jesus Christ just like the original one that went into the ground he said now see the eternal life now he's likening that to a seed this he said Jesus was the first body and now the second one is another one but it's the Original Seed becoming a body of Christ now remember if a seed is planted if it has life in the seed it will bring forth the same life that Christ had here and so we go on down here he says he said sure he said the stock back here carried the life certainly it did he said but you see when it become the stalk and it was finished the organization the life went out he said right on into Wesley and went out he said in each one of them the life went out but he said don't look at the he said but don't look like the grain he said when the little pollen comes and and or the stock the pollen or the tussle he said it looks a whole lot like the grain but when it comes down to that shuck he said it's almost there he said and didn't Jesus say Matthew 24 24 the two would be so close it would deceive the very genes predestinated brother Brandon calls it he said the very elected genes he said if it was possible almost like the real thing and you'll see a form of godliness in the church that looks like the real thing but I'm here to tell you it's false anointed ones at the end time they're preaching false doctrines and they're trying to get you off into some left field or right field but the Bible has tell has told us a way to overcome and it's by the full word of God the pure unadulterated word of God for the age and a messenger came and he said if this he said this is the way here's the light follow this and he told us what to do and and how to have church as the Pastor said this morning he told us all these things but it don't do any good to hear it if we're sitting back saying well that's good but I'm not going to overcome because there's just too much going on in my life but it's time we quit making excuses and be the Overcomer in this age he said if it was possible almost like the real thing see in the last days he said it's wheat time now it's harvest time he said this is not Luther's age this is not even the Pentecostal age this is the bride age remember we are being called out of laodicea but we are not meant to stay like the laodicean church and the laodicean church will be the lukewarm and the backsliders and the ones that are just going off he said he would spew them out but we were not called to be spewed out we were called to overcome this age and as Overcomers there's a part we must play in this great thing in this great drama that God put out he said to him that overcometh will I do what grant us sit with me on my throne so we're not living necessarily in the laodicean age although we know that's the last age but we are to be called out higher than that so when you see a spirit of laodicea on the church remember it's because you haven't been called higher yet and that's not the messenger's fault because he came to do just that but it's our own fault for allowing the things of the world to Cloud over our vision and he said we need to be Anointed with ice have so that we can see clearly the things that we need to overcome in this hour now remember he said as Moses called a nation out of a Nation Christ is calling a church out of a church he said you see the same thing in type taking taking them to this glorious Eternal Promised Land he said now to refuse that person that's doing the calling Christ no matter if your Pentecostal Methodist Luther whatever you are he said nothing against them not at all but in this age now you've got to accept just like they did in that age the person of Christ Wishes the word you must accept the word of this age that's the only way you're going to overcome and the word is not just a dead letter but it is appointed word for you it is Anointed for the hour it will make you an overcomer if you just obey it in the beginning was the word and the words with God the Word was God the word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and and it goes on the same yesterday today and forever Hebrews 13 8. He said brother Branham says You must accept that person of eternal life that's how you overcome it won't do you any good to try to overcome on your own merits but you must have the person of Jesus Christ he said now what life Luther had was justification Wesley had sanctification the Pentecost had the restoration of the gifts coming back in it he said but now it's completing the body he said you see the three phases of it and out of that then when the Resurrection comes the life that lived in them lutherans that went out the life that lived in the Methodist that went out the life that went in the Pentecostals all of it will be raptured out of the ground in the body of the Bride to be taken in before Jesus Christ he said oh it's exciting it's the truth it is exciting time to be called out because no other age could say what we say now we have seen the seventh angel messenger we know it's the end time we know what he said was to call out a bride and all we have to do is line up to it it's so simple but we live in an age of a deception and so many things are trying to distract us from the things of God and people are you know going to church now even it's not just a message thing where people are dropping out of church this is the thing that's happened all over the world there's people that would rather stay and and you'll see that the the the TV churches and online churches are getting bigger and bigger and you'll see that the the audience there at the church is getting smaller what is it it's the spirit of the age and when you fall into that spirit it's an illusion that has got you blinded and I say it's time tonight for the ice have to be put on your eyes so you can see that the word is still right there's still a people that will gather in the house of God they're still a people that will overcome the age there's still somebody that'll wake up in this hour and say I have not been called to let Luther Wesley message or any of these other messages but I have been called to a higher calling I have been called to have I settled my eyes so that I can see the word of God for my day he said we've turned a corner we're looking towards heaven watching for the coming he said the cap of the pyramid as we would say is coming back The Church Must Be resurrected soon we must get ready it's time that the bride has made herself ready but we have been given something to be dressed by and that thing that we've been given to be dressed by is the word we will be dressed in his righteousness clothed in his and and and that we are ready then but remember you have to do something you say well I'm just going to sit here I'm going to go to church and maybe you'll do all the right things for a while but then you sit there and you dry up as a church member and you get cold and formal and go into a message church becomes just as much as the Forum is going to the Baptist Church or anything else but what we need is an overcoming church that are not satisfied in the doldrums but they are raised to something new there is a quickening power in the bride there is something in the bride that will make him enjoy the word of God what's the matter today the church is cold he said we're not the church we've been called out he said now you know what's the matter with the church it's been so cold until it's got a spiritual cold he said it'll take more than grease to Open the Eyes he was telling the story about when he would get sick and the little draft would come in the cold and and and I believe his uncle or someone would would kill Coons and they'd take that grease and they'd rub it on their eyes you know and doesn't that sound good rub that grease in their eyes to try to get the the matter and stuff out of their eyes and he was telling that story and he said but it'll take the oil of the Holy Spirit and the power of the resurrection of Christ to take the coldness away from the church you say brother Branham wanted a nice quiet church I'm here to tell you he said we need to get rid of the coldness out of the church if you go to a funeral home brother Joe you know the thin bodies don't move and that's because they're cold and they're dead but if you go somewhere where there's life then you'll see some movement there you'll see something alive and we are not in a funeral home today but we are called out to be a living body of Jesus Christ in this hour it's so cold it's got a spiritual cold and he says we need the resurrection of Christ to take the coldness away from the church and open their eyes that they might see the presence of the Lord Jesus let him open your eyes he's the Holy Spirit he said here tonight to grease up your eyes with God's Sav open your eyes he said you know what he said American people he said want to be entertained they want some little Hollywood star with kinky hair and dressed up like I don't know what to come out and make entertainment because that's what you see on television he said I'm just one old-fashioned preacher that believes that there's no cure but the blood of Jesus Christ he said I'm getting so sick and tired of this American Hollywood evangelism going across the country with diamond rings and short-haired women and going across just carrying on and beating the drums somewhere and jumping up and down it's a disgrace he said we need the old time Saint Paul's Revival and the Bible holy goes back in the church with some real good Holy Ghost Salve to open the people's eyes he said that is the truth open our eyes and I would say tonight in the message if we need anything it's our eyes to be open the word has come the word is open to us now open my eyes so I can see it in what has happened Christ has been knocking on the door and the world has shut the door on him but to you that will open the door and hear his voice you are the Overcomer today and he said we need the old the real truth he said open our eyes he said when the real thing comes along he said people's so blind he said they can't see it he said God has been so merciful to us people that's become it's become common to us God and all of our coldness and difference and he still sends his Mercy still sends his Mercy after church after people had come to church and and they're cold and and they're indifferent and we have a good service like we did this morning and we go out and and we let things in the world just get us away from God but remember if we can take what we heard this morning and put it in our homes too don't make it just at church but make it at your home too it's time we have a spiritual home this is what was a spiritual church if we have a spiritual home I believe that'll make a spiritual church if you prayed more in home then I believe the house of God would become more alive well I tell you it it comes to a point that we just think we're okay in our cold condition we think we're okay by by doing what what our parents did and and I was raised on a on a message pew at times and and different churches and and uh and I I not really a message was it but we were all over the place at times but I was in the message long enough to know that I could act a part of a message person if I wanted to if I went to a church that shouted I could stand up if I wanted to if I went to one it was dead I felt just as good because I didn't have to move but let me tell you something there's something about a real born-again believer that when the word Goes Forth you can't help but respond in some way that brother Branham didn't teach us to have a cold formal church and I get so tired of hearing that brother branham's Church wasn't dead that was the word of God coming forth out of that church there's nothing Dead about it it was made alive and quickening power coming across that Pulpit I can't help it if the people didn't respond I can't help but I wasn't there so I could stand up and shout a little bit I can't help that I couldn't say Amen to the prophet but I'm here to tell you I've been given a chance today and today is the day when I choose to stand up and say Amen to the word of God I choose to say I will not be defeated but I'm an overcomer in laodicean age there's been plenty that's failed there's been plenty that will fail but in this age you have been called to be an overcomer he said to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame he was tempted just like you are remember that you're not the only one that's been tempted you're not the only one that has had problems you're not the only person who's had struggles on Sunday mornings you're not the only person who's had to deal with sickness and maybe at times you've been broken couldn't hardly afford to get to church you're not the only one there's been a whole lot of us in that condition but I'm here to tell you today there is an overcoming power here for you in this age he said I will not leave you helpless but I will come to you in the hour of need he's always there he will never give up on you he said he's always he still sends his Mercy you say well I don't know if I can overcome I don't know if I can overcome this weekend because there's a football game on and I really got to go see it and I'll go to church next weekend and maybe the kids will be feeling a little better you know if we give the devil an excuse I'm not saying if your kids are home sick that's fine but if you give the devil a few excuses he'll always give you an excuse that's just the truth of it if you if you stay home for one reason at some point you've got to overcome something at some point you've got to say you know what I'm going anyway well it might hurt but it's the truth anyway why did we give in to the devil when we're called to be Overcomers why do we give in and say well it's it's okay it's okay to do this and and we don't actually have to go to church and we don't actually have to take our children to Sunday school and we don't actually have to respond to the word of God we don't actually have to do anything but the Overcomer will oh yeah we don't hey there's no law that tells me I got to be up here tonight but the Overcomer told me as I overcome this age and he said he said to you we're called to preach and I believed it and I went to the word and I found it in there and I'm just going to tell you whether I I may not be the best but I'm just going to do what God told me to do anyway come on you know we're not trying to be anybody else my name don't have to be in the book of who's who but but at least I've got a good one-liner going around the message and people are talking about me even if it is negative but you know what we get so out there thinking we if we're not the best we don't want to be nothing at all right you are the best you're the best you've been called to something and if all it is is an overcomer maybe you're not called to preach maybe you're not called to sing but if you've been called to be an overcomer that's plenty because that's a whole lot that's a whole lot more than your neighbor probably you go down the street and look at all them all them people standing out there on Sunday afternoon in their shorts and and sitting out there smoking a cigarette and you think about something you think they've never heard what you've heard they've never heard it they know nothing about it and if they did maybe they wouldn't accept it but you did because you heard an eagle scream in your hour you heard something for you you heard something that you knew was right and what wasn't it wasn't your flesh that agreed with it because by all accounts when the preacher gets up here he's going to say something that makes you feel bad in your flesh but we are more than conquerors we are Overcomers of this hour we've been born we've been born for for this as I've said before we were born for this season born for this time he said here's some time ago a man wanted to be inspired and he went down to the sea to be inspired and on his road down you've heard the story he met an old salt coming back an old sailor that lived on the sea born on the sea he said my good man we're goeth thou he said sir I'm going down to the sea to be inspired oh I want to smell the salty air I want to see the great ocean as it whips up its big Briny waves and see the reflection of the sky and it's blue water I want to hear the scream of the seagulls he said oh I'm sure I'll Be Inspired when I get to the Sea I've longed to see it all my life I've longed to see the sea and the old salt said to him well I was born on it and I've sailed the seven seas and I don't see nothing inspired about it he said why he was used to it and I wonder if in this age we haven't just become so used to it that way it's become common to us going to church is so common well we've heard it preached all our lives but it's become calm and it's almost like you preach it and it comes back at you like it didn't even sink in and you've preached these things and you wonder why why did they just go out there and it seems like this comes back to you it's because it's become common to the people but you know it's like buzzwords around the message well we don't want to use the buzzwords but listen if I said God sent a prophet that ought to make somebody happy if I said you're an overcomer in this age that ought to make somebody happy if I said you are more than a conqueror somebody ought to be excited about that if I said Jesus died on the cross and that's all I said somebody ought to be excited about it because he did it for you he did it for you so that you could overcome this age you say well it's become common in so many phrases because you know there's only 1200 tapes you know we're not it's not like we're just making more of them so you're going to hear the same thing sometimes but don't let it become common to you don't let you know the sir the brother Ben has been on a sermon for about five Sundays now we're on a series not a sermon it seems like but it's serious for five Sundays but listen we shouldn't let that become common well he's preaching there's he's preaching on uh preaching on uh you know a home to come back to for five Sundays I've heard it the first time I don't need to hear it the other four well maybe you need to hear the same one five times wouldn't hurt nobody and we've left the message you know sometimes we'll turn on a tape and and I'm guilty of this I used to do this all the time we turn on the tape just so it's play and say hey I listen to a tape today you ever done that anybody don't have to raise your hands but but you just turn on the tape hey I want to hear a tape and you just have it playing and it's just going and you didn't hear a word that was on it yeah somebody's done it I can't be the only one but you do it and and it's probably okay I guess but you know it really isn't doing you that much good you say well the atmosphere might be better and that's fine if that's what it does you know what some children sleep with the tape that's what I'm not condemning that what I'm trying to say is sometimes you need to sit down and actually hear what it's saying that don't hurt either you say well there's some tapes I don't listen to flashing red lights is one of them it don't hurt to listen to some of those hard messages once in a while because something's going to have to help you overcome this age something's going to tell you what you need to hear not what you want to hear but something's going to tell you what you need to hear and that's the matter that's what's the matter he said with the Pentecostal church and the rest of them today he said you're so used to seeing the powers of God and the glory of God he said in the goodness of God till you just don't pay any attention to it no more that's it he said it becomes a common thing and I wonder in the message the greatest message that could be sent to the church if we sit and we hear those tapes and when he says the Christian will go to church it we we need to let that sink in a little bit you'd say Well it hurts me just a little bit but we need to try to line up to that because if you can't overcome that how are you going to overcome the other evils that are coming you got to start somewhere and if I can't even overcome the little things how am I ever going to overcome the big things When sin comes in your life how are you ever going to overcome that if you can't overcome the Simplicity you say well brother Joel I've been revelated and and I need this and I need that but listen we need more than just little things we need something that will hold us we need to hear the the revealing of the word of God and we need to actually go in there and study it and understand what it's saying it's not just a a voice that goes out and it just goes into the air and it's not just I heard the voice today and and it was a good tape and and I went and sat for two hours and I did this that's okay but let me tell you something at some point you got to live it some point you got to overcome it it's okay to read your Bible you need to read your Bible brother Branham says a Christian reads his Bible and prays every day it's what we should be doing but I just go ahead and tell you to read the letters it's not going to do you no good until the quickening power comes in and makes you live in you those letters didn't do you no good but when the words come out of the page and come into you then it'll do something for you it'll make you live the word it'll make you live the word he said that's he said that's the problem it has become a common thing but I would like to just propose to you today I think it's time we took the message off the shelf and brought it into the heart took it off the tape and put it into your heart quit reading the Bible like it's just a history book but start reading it like it applies to you today the message of the hour it doesn't come just to just to bring it to make you feel good and I I know it I I love listening to the tapes sometimes I like to go listen just the stories because you think about the stories that are on the tapes and and you think about how how good they are and how it makes you feel you know you think about you can kind of get to know brother Branham a little bit and you get to know what he was like as a man and and I love those things I love that history side of it but brother at some point quit looking to the man and start looking to the word that he brought and the word that he brought will make you an overcomer this day the word that he brought will do something for you that'll change your life maybe you won't shout all the time but your life will change something will take place and remember he said that lukewarm and he said I will spew thee out of my mouth he would rather you be cold or hot and I don't want to be cold so why not be an overcomer today I think we overthink these things sometimes I think we get to thinking that overcoming is too hard but we're not the ones actually doing the overcoming because if we were doing it on our own there's none of us here that would be able to do it but there is a person of Jesus Christ who has come in this day now I'm not talking about a flesh man but I'm talking about a man that was revealed in a flesh man and he was revealed to you and me it was a son of man revealing the son of man that could make you an overcomer he was calling a church out of a church and he would call that church to come out uh Overcomer he would call them the Bride of Jesus Christ and I think that's the way it is today we have got so so into our own little forms and our own little circles in the message we think of a service in a certain way or or a preacher Don't Preach a certain way or we don't have things just in a certain order we think something's wrong and and something's off about the service but let me tell you something we're all trying to do the same thing overcome and stay with the word there will be conditions of a lukewarm and formal church but then there will be conditions of a rapture-ready church and I want to be in the condition of a rapture-ready church I don't want to be in the condition when the bombs start falling listen I don't want to be here he said and he said Abraham's group listen Abraham's seed won't be they won't be here when the first bomb he says in one place and I love the way he put it he said when they've got that lever pulled back and just as soon as they go to release it he said well be caught up and we'll look back on the destruction and I love how he said it because I'm not going to be here to see the nominal lukewarm Christians and I'm not going to see what they have to go through to make it you say well brother as long as I'm a Christian I'm going to make it you may be a Christian but I don't want to go through the things that are coming and just be a Christian I want to be an overcomer I want to be in the bride group that is caught up before those things hit the earth and brother tonight I think it's time that the church quit staying in this cold condition and the lukewarm condition and we'd be called to an overcomer today and be called to overcome these things of the world whether it's a lust Spirit whether it's a sports Spirit that's got you out of church or whether it's to stay home and watch your favorite show on TV whatever it is get over that thing and come up a little higher and come up into the things of God because what you feed on that's what you become and what you feel on is what you're becoming every day remember if you'll feed on the word you will become the very body of the word he said that's what he's making in this hour is a body of Jesus Christ today but you've got to overcome to do that this church is an overcomer and he'll always send Mercy he will always send Mercy I think that's the thing we need to know today is is we're not here on our own we're not by ourselves there is a there is a way to overcome this age we've seen the light that is shown on the message we've seen the scriptures revealed no other age could say that we see the opening of the word but we see the opening of the word no other age could say I'm going to overcome the last day uh the distress between nations the perplexity of times no other age can say they're going to overcome that but we can and I was listening to the layout of seeing Church age the other day brother was preaching and he said he was talking about the one that would come how many he's heard him talk about it and he's talking about the uh the messenger that would come to the laodicean church agent he doesn't call it call himself that but we know who it is just by what he said it would be and he said this man would be like the Elijah spirit and and he would be called and he would be come out and he'd be against certain things and he goes into detail on all this and but remember there would be a people that would hear what he said and he said there would be something he said the man didn't come he said just to make another church or to make another organization he said it didn't come just to build up another group of people but he said he'd come to call him out of the groups that were there and I loved how he said it and he went into detail about all these little things and and how the Overcomer would be and he said but the laodicean church age he said would be total chaos and destruction and things like that but he said the Overcomer in that layout of cnh would be the very body of Jesus Christ and I wonder if today you're looking around and you see the flaws of your neighbor you see somebody in the church that ain't doing just right they're trying to overcome just like you are I I'm trying to overcome just like you are I've got things in my life every day Satan tries to fight me but I'm trying to overcome just like you are and I'm not giving up till I do Satan can't hold me back I'm not giving up I'm not giving in to the age and the spirit of laodicea but I'm going to be called out and when I come into that bright age remember when you reach that Perfection that's when the church is going to be taken home you say well I can't be perfect but remember there is going to come a bride that will be perfected by the word you won't be perfected on your own merits you won't be perfected by what church you go to by some big church or organization well I go to the biggest church in the message and that's okay but that's not what you're going to be measured by there's cold people sitting in the big churches there's cold people sitting in the little churches there's lukewarm sitting all around but I'm here to tell you it could be a little church in Hardy Arkansas where there's somebody on fire for God there's somebody who has been called out and said I am an overcomer of laodicea I am more than just a church member I am more than a Baptist I'm more than a Methodist I'm more than a Catholic I'm more than just a message believer I am a message liver I'll leave it I don't just hear it I don't just say I do it I don't just say well I press play today and I'm okay no I'm gonna do what he said do and if I do what he said do then I'm doing what the word said to do remember brother Brandon didn't come with his own words but he come to open the very word to us we were blinded we didn't see but he came with the ice have so that we could see what we needed in this hour to overcome but we get cold we get formal we get on our own we think we're good enough that's the problem with the age everything's just good enough and it happens in workplaces it happens in family lives and we think we're good enough if our kids if we look in the room and they're praying before they go to bed and and we think well that's good enough but did you ever get them together and pray around an altar together and really pray through the little things are good good night prayers are good and and those are those are wonderful things but I wonder if we've ever had something come up in us the spirit come upon us and say there's something more you need to do with your family there's something more you need to do in your church it's not just good enough to go there and act like a Christian it's it's not just good enough to say well my kids went in there and they prayed and they said you know bless the Lord my soul to keep and that's good but if they ever got down and heard what it means to really pray through it's going to be required of this age you're not going to make it on what your parents did or your grandparents did you're not going to make it on what I do or what someone else is doing if we don't set a standard now for our children the churches are going to get colder and colder and they're going to get farther and farther I'm just talking to you right now but I'm just going to tell you this if we continue on that path of saying it's just good enough we brought him to church until they were 18. we drug them to church till he's 18. the reason you're dragging them is because they don't want to go and get what you got oh come on come on come on listen I'm just going to tell you when I started seeing people in the message with something something real when I started seeing people with something on fire when I started seeing the word work oh yeah then I wanted what they had if a parent can make it so in their home that they're living such a life that they don't have to beat their kids to the family Altar and you don't have to drag them to church but they want what you got they want to live like you're living there's a time in life where you have to be able to say you don't have to look at the preacher and do what he's doing but look at me in my life I'm an overcomer if I can overcome you can too come on we just get so cold and indifferent and brother Brandon tells us that and he goes on down and this message door to the heart if you get a chance go listen to door to the heart 1958 19 yeah uh March of 1958 door to the heart brother man talks about Jesus knocking on the door many of you heard this he's knocking he's knocking and you don't ever open it oh I know who's at the door I know who's telling me to do better I know who's calling me to be an overcomer but I just don't feel like it today if not now when if not now your children will suffer for it my children children will suffer for the decisions I make today and if that's the way we raise them church that's our fault brother Branham calls it parent delinquency because he says he says it's not the children because the way they were raised up remember you'll hear the stories in the Bible about the woman that was in prostitution and things like that and brother Brandon talked about her home life and attributed that to being the reason for the way she was I say it's time for the parents to take over in the home and to come and Overcomer ourselves so that our children will have a Fighting Chance it's time we quit saying it's good enough and we sent him off to school and and we sent him off to here and and then when they get home we're too tired and we go to bed and our children to see us once in a while and then they see us go to church and and then when we're there we don't enjoy it and and we sit there and we're just cold and we go back out and and they see these things kids are not stupid you know kids are actually pretty smart kids are watching every move you make every move you make and I'm here to tell you it's time we start living what we're preaching to them that goes for me too if my kids will sit here and they'll say Dad I heard you say a certain thing and I didn't do it at home let me tell you something I'd feel pretty guilty about that and you say you say brother Joel is everything perfect in your home oh Lord no I've got kids and a wife just like y'all she's the best yesterday was our 11th anniversary she's put up with me all those years I can't believe she's still married to me after I started preaching I tell you I've made her she don't even blush but I've made her blush more than I can count since I started but we've got to live what we preach [Music] get back on track Lord help me we've got to live what we preached to him that overcomes an overcomer what is an overcomer someone who doesn't give up if I run into an obstacle at my job and I just feel like I can't do it well there's ways to overcome the obstacle I can call somebody that knows what they're doing I can hire somebody who knows what they're doing yeah yeah or I can give up chances are you give up you ain't getting paid right it's just the truth of it you really think you're gonna inherit all things if you give up now you're not going to inherit nothing you want an inheritance we're talking about the inheritance of the children of Abraham we talk about the promises of God and we all want those promises and it makes us happy to hear about it but you're not getting them if you don't overcome something you have to go over have the children of Israel ever get to the land they had to overcome an obstacle they had to go through Giants to get there but we're more than able if we'll just take the word of God we've been given a sword and in this hour listen we've been given more than just uh what they had in the ages the the church ages they had just enough to overcome but today we've we've got more to overcome but we've got a lot more ammunition as well we've got a whole lot more than what they had you say they could preach justification and they would call out a people they'd preach sanctification and call that a people but we have been called to all things and we have been given a message of overcoming power overcoming all things overcoming every every every demon every devil that would come at you everything that you've got in your life you've been called to overcome that and remember David could have given up when he saw Goliath and I tell you I'm not of in my flesh but if there's a spirit on the inside man that says hey go ahead and fight that devil I've already seen him laying out there you know what remember we heard the other night it's a vision God had a vision of your life if you'll just keep on track if you're to stay with the word of God that's the vision for your life is the word of God but remember we've got to overcome and no doubt when David come out there and maybe he prayed before he went out but he saw that that Goliath standing out there and look at what's in his way I'll bet today you say well there there's a little something a little obstacle to overcome to get where I need to go in life but listen it may be a giant in your way it may be all kinds of things that you can't do on your own but I'm here to tell you God has given you more than just a slingshot he has given you his whole arsenal he gave you a shield and he gave you a sword and he gave you a helmet and he gave you these things so that you could be the Overcomer of the layout of CN age and you don't have to live under the spirit of that age no more because you've been called out and you've been put into a bright age you say well I'm still living in laodicea me too but I'm not living under that Spirit the spirit is all around me but it ain't taking my house me and my house I will we will serve the Lord as for me in my house ain't no Devil's gonna stop us from going to church as for me and my house there ain't nobody gonna keep me out of the order of God nobody's going to keep me from being an overcomer in this day why I I tell you I didn't come up here just to stand up here and preach to this afternoon but I come to tell you this is a time of overcoming for the church to him that overcometh who's going to overcome if you want who will it's time we're them we are the Overcomers and we think about it and you can look at any part of the Bible and people had to overcome something everybody had to overcome something you think the children of Israel had it easy go read your Bible again you think that the three Hebrew children had it easy none of us have had it that bad go read it again you think that Daniel had it easy but he tried to pray no they're not threatening to throw you into lines then if you pray and we still don't do it right but Daniel did it in spite of what was coming he knew the penalty for prayer and he did it anyway we are not penalized for praying we're blessed for praying if anything it'll bring situations under control but what do we do what we decide just to get frantic and and well let's go post on Facebook and tell everybody about our problems instead of praying about it we might as well pray first if it don't work at least you try but if you pray believe him something will take place situations will change Mountains will move you say well it took 25 years for Abraham but they still happened he held on to the promises of God but remember he had to overcome doubt you say Abraham never doubted the promise you think Satan didn't try to get him to if Satan didn't talk to him he talked to Jesus Satan's talking to everybody Satan's talking to you right now saying well I'm not good enough to be an overcomer in this day Satan's telling you well my family I just can't seem to get him into the house of the Lord or well pray for him but you've got to live it in front of them and that's what I think church if I could get this to you we've got to live the word brother Branham said live a life so loud that I can't hear your testimony I want to live so loud that the world can't even hear what I'm saying because they'll know before I speak that that's what I'm doing that's what I want you say are you there yet I'm trying I'm pressing every day to be an overcomer I'm still in this flesh I'm still fighting every day I'm still young I've still got things I I've still gotta the message you say have you heard every tape no I haven't heard every tape I I've listened to every tape but I haven't heard every tape I've listened to every tape there is but I've never heard every I hear things all the time that I've never heard before and then God sends a Ministry and he starts showing you things in the message you're like I listened to that tape yesterday and never heard anything like that on it and he's opened it up to you you say well why why is that why can't I just hear the tapes and do it because it wasn't God's provided way he sent humans and you have to be able to look past the veil of Flesh to hear what they're saying because if you're sitting there looking at the flesh man there's no way you could accept it I I've known good men in this message and I talked to people who knew him when they were kids and they said well if you knew they weren't a kid they were a rascal now and they tell you what you know tell you hey if you knew them you that you wouldn't listen to them hey I'm not looking at what they were I'm not even looking at what they will be but I'm telling you if they bring in the word of God God is Anointed the man for a season and I'm here to tell you that what we're doing is bringing you the full counsel of God we're not here pulling no punches we're not here trying to tell you well well you're an overcomer you can do this you can do that you can do whatever you want to do you're going to overcome this day you're going to do whatever you want to do but I'm here to tell you somebody's gonna raise up that is going to overcome despite the hard things that come about you say well I can't I just can't seem to do it yeah but maybe you're trying on your own quit trying on your own and really realize there's someone more powerful than you there's someone greater than you a greater than Solomon is here to change the situation in your life a greater than any of the church age Messengers is here a greater than a prophet of God is standing here you say how can you get any greater than that Christ himself is on the Earth today living through a body of Believers remember church this is not just I don't mean to yell at you and scream at you but I'm here to tell you I think we just need to start living the message of the hour and overcome this world and the spirit of laodicea because there's going to be those spirits and remember there'll be some that will grow up so close he said it'll look like the same thing it'll look so close it'll deceive the elected if it were possible but remember it's not possible to you little elect and don't think just because you're a seed of God you can sit back and die on the ground no if you have the Life of Christ in you you will blossom into the word of God you will grow into what God said you would be you say well well I I just I'm a seed of God I can do what I want to if if God planted an apple tree it will produce apples if he planted an oak tree it will come up and be a beautiful big oak tree but listen to me if you say well well I'm I'm just not I'm maybe I'm not a seed of God well that's the devil talking to you be an overcomer quit listening to the lies of the devil and overcome those devils in this age overcome the spirit of Lao to see you you say why are you saying overcome because it seems in this age it's harder than ever to get people just to get past the little things and to overcome the little obstacles brother there's coming a time when you're going to need to put your faith in action there's coming a time when you're going to have to overcome something a little bigger than what you're overcoming now so God has allowed these little trials to come he's allowed little testings in your life if you can't overcome them how's he ever going to give you something bigger to overcome you say brother I just can't do it I can't do it on my own brother you can but I'm going to tell you you can through the blood of Jesus Christ you'll never do it on your own but here you are today sitting here not because you come out of fear if you're coming out of fear to go to church well I'm going to get preached at or yelled at or whatever well you might but let me go ahead and tell you it's not that's not if you didn't want to come you won't get yelled at this don't come at all you never get yelled at the end but but there's a reason you come yeah because there is something on the inside that wants you to be there is a desire planted in your heart that wants you to be there there's a desire in me that says I don't want to just be another Christian I don't want to just be another message believer but I want to live what the message says I don't want to just be in laodicea in the daughters of the world but I want to be called out to a higher age and you say brother there's another age yes there's another age we're living it we're living it in laodicea there's a someone that's called out and we're soaring like eagles Rising above it all Rising above everything that's down here and we look down and we see the world and we see the ashes and we we see all the we see all the the gay couples and and we see all the the man that don't know he's a man and the woman don't know she's a woman we see all those things brother we're called up higher than that we can look down at that and say that could have been me but for the grace of God he put something in my life he changed me from what I was I was just a backslidden message kid but he made me out of something you say brother Joel are you boasted no I'm boasted on God who can do it for you too it's not just for me it's not just for my house but it's for you as well every one of you can be an overcomer every one of you can be an overcomer let's stand to our feet as musicians come overcoming is something you have to do but quit looking at your own merits look to the word we've been given something to hold us in this day it's not something that's grabbed our attention but they're staying power in this message of the hour do you believe that today they're staying power in it something it'll keep you through laodicea something that'll keep you and have you ready for a Rapture in this day there's something here today I believe there's a spirit on the land today that is trying to get a bride gathered together for a Rapture you said that's gathered in one place no gathered under the word of God gathered under the word of God I believe they're here today I believe there's men on the Earth today traveling trying to tell you little Eagle get out of that barnyard you say well I've already come out of the nomination yeah but you went back you went down there and you denominated your own idea around the message get out of that chicken pen too and come over here where the word of God is moving among his people we put ourselves in a cage when we don't need to be in a cage but I'm free and I thank God I am free I thank God he brought me out of this way I was I thank God he gave me new life I thank God for the message of the hour because it didn't make me sit down and become another church member but he quickened my life to the gospel and he made it so I could live it we should be the happiest people on the face of the Earth that we can live what we believe it's not just a a I have to do it but it's I want to do it I want to live the way he wants me to live I want the power that he gives not my own power where is thy strength on Samson it was a power from the Lord and it came right back on him remember the power of the Samson had was nothing until the power of the Lord came in the room you can't overcome until the power of the Lord comes in the room but if you get down on your knees and invite him in one time I challenge you to do it and see if the power of the Holy Ghost don't come and change the situations in your life it's time we do it with our heads bowed as they play something I challenge you tonight when you get home with your children if you can show them this is how we pray through this is this is what we're supposed to be doing we don't just turn on turn on a movie and say here kids just just do this you say have you ever done that yeah yeah who's who's not guilty I've done things in my life I'm not proud of it but I'm here to tell you there's an overcoming power here if we'll accept it I want to be more like Jesus I want to live the way he wants me to live I want to overcome this evil age and it's not just I want to but I know I can I know I can overcome in this day because he's given the power he's not just given a power but authority to the church to overcome all things that Satan would throw at us in this day if there's one here today that that needs a touch from the Lord just raise your hand to him and tell him Lord I've grown cold in my walk our home life is has grown a little cold [Music] We're still praying but there's just there's something about the spirits not moving like it should I'll raise my hand and say I need more in my life I need more in my life I need an overcoming power to come back in the home I can't make my kids overcome but I can set the example before him and show them what it means to overcome and that overcoming power that I can witness will work for my children and to my children's children and to them that are far off why because it's the same Holy Ghost same power that they had on the day of Pentecost if it changed them it'll change you with every head bowed and every eye I closed if there's a need just raise your hand if you could pray with me just now just ask the Lord to take us out of that cold situation the lukewarmness whatever it is in your life Lord I pray you would raise this church up out of that doldrums and conditions Lord bring us up higher today Lord I pray you would just move a mighty rushing wind across the audience now Lord Lord may we not leave the same people we came but may we recognize the overcoming power is already here and Lord may we just rise up through the newness of life in this age and we see Lord we are more than able to overcome not because of what we are but because the blood that covers Us Lord and Lord God when there's something wrong in our life I pray we quickly come back and repent quickly come to you Lord and may the Holy Spirit anoint something Lord to come up in his Lord and raise us to uh to a new life and a new way of living Lord I pray Lord we would be not be looked at the same but may the world look at us and say I see a Christian May the world says look at us and say I see an overcomer I see someone who is living the word for this hour I see somebody who prays through I see somebody who goes to church and takes their children and shows them this is the way this is how we do it it's not just the form it's not a form of godliness but it is a true Living God on the Earth today living through his bride I pray Lord for this church I pray for everyone that's sitting here Lord Lord through a message that was just all mangled up maybe Lord and not put together well but Lord I hope there's something that would be said here tonight Lord that would help the people overcome what they're going to face tomorrow and the next day and this week oh God I pray you will just send a fire through the church that would take out all the dross Lord and the worldly thinking Among Us Lord and move upon us like never before and may we be an overcoming Church may we be an overcoming bride of Jesus Christ in this age oh God I pray you would
