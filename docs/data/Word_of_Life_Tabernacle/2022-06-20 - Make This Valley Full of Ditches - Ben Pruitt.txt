fight for it lord to to walk on every promise that you've given us oh god to put footsteps of possession on every place where you would have us to be and where you would have us to go i pray you'd come now in your word tonight lord lord you would just move me out of the way and speak directly to your people oh how we need you lord we we can't make it without you we we don't want to go unless you go with us lord so as we enter into this part of the service oh god would your presence anoint the word lord would you just come down and reveal that the thoughts lord that you would have to say

begin to see a manifestation of the will of god in their life and healing salvation of the children and things i pray you'd grant it lord we thank you for all that you've done and we put this service in your hands tonight we ask it in jesus name amen amen hallelujah it's so good to hear you sing tonight i know you're excited to be here and so we want to go right into the word i don't have a lot of notes tonight and things in fact what i'm going to say comes from a sermon of brother branham's and i'm just going to preach it to you tonight i i don't have the quotes on the board but i'll have this some scriptures but you just bear with me tonight i felt this on my heart second kings chapter three and verse 16. second kings chapter 3 and verse 16 and he said thus saith the lord aren't you glad you can hear thus sayeth the lord thus saith the lord make this valley full of ditches what what an odd prophecy make this valley full of ditches i pray that the lord would add his blessing to the word you may be seated in a few weeks now we're going to have our meetings here at the church so begin to think about that and we're going overseas in the meantime in between now and then and we've got a lot on our plate oh how i would like to see an outpouring of the holy ghost yes sir we need it we we need the holy spirit some people think that we don't we need a move of the holy spirit in our lives and our homes and our worlds we live in we need him we we can't go off without him we need him we need him if we're going to go and be of any use in in egypt if we're going to be in use here if the word of the lord is ever going to become present we need an outpouring of the holy spirit and i'm not just talking about an emotional revival but a a movement of the spirit of god that could bring souls to a place where they ought to be that that could make us want to do the word of god that that gives us that action and that inspiration to begin to work and and to begin to do and and like i said you begin to want to be in church you begin to want to serve god with all of your heart and that's what's lacking so many times that even among christians it seems like that that fervent desire that burning of the spirit of god to to become more like christ to become more what he wants us to be it seems like it it's lacking and the devil does everything that he can to try to throw a wet blanket on us and try to make it where we can't hardly seem to worship and and it's a chore to raise our hands it's a chore to worship it it's a chore to sing but i tell you i want to be in a in a service where the freedom of god is there where the preacher can preach and and deliver his heart and we're the where the spirit of god can move and the people can raise their hands and and and worship and receive the word and where sinners would be convicted and and if there's something that's not right even in a church member that they'd make it right and and those are the kind of services that we need we don't need dried theology we don't just need that we need the spirit of god to move in our midst you believe you can do that tonight hey man i know it's a little bit different maybe for me to preach in in this way but it just was stirring my heart as i began to listen to a sermon that brother branham preached called make this valley full of ditches ditches now in second kings chapter 3 and verse 1 jehoram the son of ahab began to reign over israel and samaria in the 18th year of jehoshaphat king of judah and he reigned 12 years and he wrought evil in the sight of the lord but not like his father not to the degree that his father did and like his mother for he put away the image of baal that his father had made nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat which made israel to sin he departed not there from but the brown said he took the place of his father and he was a very wicked man he was still worshiping the idols of his mother jezebel and the first thing that brother branham brings to our attention if we go and if you go and listen to that sermon just a simple sermon brother branham talks about how that it was marrying out of their ranks is what caused that and you think about that as not being that big of a deal but it does matter it does matter and he tells us that he said it'll do it in our homes too he said if you marry among unbelievers you see what takes place he said you lose your victory when you marry among unbelievers and i think we could even take that a step farther and say when we when we wed ourselves to ideas when we marry or or give ideas that we give credibility to ideas that are not the word we we're supposed to be married to the word and when we marry outside of our of the word of god what happens is we're marrying out of our ranks we're yoking ourselves up with unbelief and we lose our victory when we do that and that's what king jehoram had done in verse six it says king jehoram went out of samaria at the same time and numbered all of israel and he went out and said to jehoshaphat the king of judah saying the king of moab hath rebelled against me wilt thou go with me against moab to battle and he said i will go up i must now are my people as thy people my horses says not horses and he said which way shall we go up and he answered the way through the wilderness of edom so the king of israel went the king of judah and the king of edom and they fetched the compass of seven days journey there was no water for the host and for the cattle that followed them you see they got all tied up in business i'm just gonna preach to you for a little while it's all right they got all tied up in business and didn't stop to consult god how many times have we done that and if we would just be honest today if we look back at the times in our lives when we found ourselves dry when we found ourselves backslid it's because we got caught up in business whether it was church business or whether it was business business whatever it was we got tied up in the busyness of life in in the business of life and when we did we stopped we don't we forget to stop and see lord do you want me to do this do you want me to be here do you want me so they left and they went out but they didn't pray about it oh my that seems like a simple thing as i told you this morning i'm very grieved sometimes that the lack of prayer even even in my own life and among us but among us as the people i know that we don't pray in public that's not what we're supposed to do and we're supposed to pray like he told us to our father which art in heaven we believe we have a god who hears our prayers so we pray in faith and yet and yet i'm grieved sometimes because i begin to wonder have we even prayed people will make life-altering decisions people will make decisions of things that will matter for the rest of their life and never even think to consult god you say but my life is predestinated yes it is you were predestined to pray you were predestined to seek the mind of god god gave you prayer as a weapon so that you could use it so you can again as i said this morning knock on the door and keep coming and keep knocking until the door comes open don't just presume to go and to do unless you prayed about it yes amen and so they got all tied up in business and i got to thinking about that have we prayed and i want to challenge you tonight as we go into this summer as we go into these services and the brothers that'll be conducting the services while we're gone and that's going overseas and then and then coming back to the meetings did we pray about it have we prayed about the meetings have we prayed about our services did we pray about the service tonight oh god have we prayed about it brother branham taught us he said when you come to the meeting if you're sick did you come and say now father i'm going down there i ask you to be merciful and let my faith be raised up to a place where i can believe your son and be healed yes you come to church like that yeah he said did you think to pray when you heard there was a meeting going on he said did you pray and go around get the neighbors and have little prayer meetings we forget those things and that's why we get in trouble yeah i know we don't again there's there's a balance to these things but i wonder sometimes sometimes i wonder if if i just played you the tape if you wouldn't get offended sorry you good people and i but i'm wondering myself sometimes sometimes i'll sit there and say brother branham i can't believe you said that but we still believe the message of the hour we still believe that it's true did we pray about it prayer still matters you say well i got something i need from god have you prayed about it have we prayed about it he said and we forget those things and so they went out seven days into the wilderness and we know that the church has been going for seven church ages and they never fetched no compass and he said it come to find out they got in trouble they went without consulting god and all the water supply was cut off now if the water supply is cut off there's a reason for it and i thank god that your spiritual people can understand these things tonight but i see when people you know they'll get in a rut and in a in a situation where they just sit and go to church and listen to the preaching and go home and go back to church and listen to the preaching and go home and there's never any move of the spirit there's never any move of god and i don't want to ever see us get stuck in that rut because when you get stuck in that rut it means you've left the water somewhere and you need to go back and find the water because i serve a god that that has a spirit that moves i serve a god that there's something exciting about it you say well it's not all about excitement no it's not but there's something exciting about the king of heaven coming down and the potential of god moving among us there's something that excites me about that and if it don't excite you to be going to heaven what does excite you if it don't make you happy to feel that the king of the universe has come down and is it's in your you're in his presence well it doesn't bother me what does doesn't get my attention what does because everybody says they're not emotional but they get their feelings hurt that's an emotion yeah sure what can move us yes what moves us i'm not talking about just an emotion but what can move you to a a closer walk with god what can move you to a place where you could cry out to god and you you won't stop until he answers you yes what can move a church to that place where the water supply is there again where we're where that tree planted by the rivers of water what can move us if the current condition doesn't make you pray what will if the world being the way it is doesn't make you reach out to god what will oh i believe we need to tonight oh my but the browner said that that was what was the matter with that those people that left is he said the water supply was cut off yeah and he said they were trying to carry the church on without the supernatural sure yeah trying to carry the church on just in the natural trying to pattern after the other churches of the world he said and that's the reason we're not having the blessings we used to have see we believe in the holy spirit has to be in everything we do we don't just sing the holy spirit is supposed to be there when we sing we don't just preach but the anointing of the holy spirit even if it's not a great emotion but there ought to be something there that moves you joked with joel i heard somebody say you got to run those lyrics through your brain i'm so glad i can say i'm one of them doesn't make you happy it ought to yeah if i'm singing i'm one of them you're wondering you wonder whether people really know what that means if it don't make you happy yeah i've been washing the blood of the lamb we could go on and on we've seen i'm so thankful i'm so glad for what god has done i'm so glad the lord has brought me out we could all those songs that we've seen and you look at it and people can sing it and it doesn't do anything it doesn't mean anything to them and you wonder you wonder are people really are they running the lyrics to their brain maybe it's not a brain problem maybe it's a heart problem maybe we've just gotten hardened to it we've become accustomed to it and say well god save me thank you for saving me no it means something when you've really been saved sure see we're not patterning after the churches of the world charles spurgeon also preached a sermon called make this valley full of ditches and he preached it much the way brother branham did if you go back and read it we still have the ability to read that today and i took just a little something that he said out of there he said we must have the aid of the holy spirit for ours it's not a mechanical religion sure if our worship consisted in the reading of forms appointed by authority oh my we could do exceedingly well without the assistance of the spirit of god yeah if that was our worship if we believed in the manipulations of priest craft and thought that after certain words and ceremonies all was done it would matter little to us whether we had the conscious presence of god if we could regenerate by water if all i had to do was baptize people it wouldn't matter if the holy spirit was there or not sure if that would save them if that alone would save them if we if all we had to do was baptize people applied by oil applied by the hands of apostolical succession we should have no particular need to pray for the holy ghost and if the utterance of certain words could turn bread into wine and spurgeon said this he said oh horrible dog man into the flesh and blood of the lord jesus christ we could wondrously well afford to dispense with the spirit of god see if there was a formula if let me update a little bit if listening to a tape was our religion we wouldn't need the holy ghost let me go a little bit further if listening to your pastor amen was enough amen you wouldn't need the holy ghost if all you had to do was attend church if it was a formula if i attend church if i pay my tithes if i do what's right then i'll make it to heaven if it was a formula we wouldn't need the holy ghost but we do need the holy ghost because it's not a formula but it's a life yeah all right hey are you with me tonight amen he said now i'm not going to keep you long tonight because i can't i just physically can't but the lord knows but we you know god god has a way of giving us what we need you believe that tonight he said if we we cannot thus deceive ourselves ours is not a religion of mechanics and hydrostatics it is spiritual it must be sustained by spiritual means if our religion were mere intellectualism we should only need a well-trained minister who had passed through all the grades of human learning who had who had made himself the best biblical criticism was able to instruct and eliminate our earnings our understandings and if we be men of judgment ourselves we could profit exceedingly well our faith standing in the wisdom of man the wisdom of man could easily be found and our faith could be confirmed but if my brethren our faith stands not in the wisdom of man or in the eloquence of human limbs but in the power of god then in vain do we make a profession unless the holy ghost dwelleth in our inner man oh we need him don't we we need him and even those who go off without him they recognize yes something's wrong that's right but they'll go off and they'll say well it must just must be a different hour must be no you went off without him the reason you don't have it is because you went off without him it's not because he's not still doing that he's a good father as we said this morning he gives his his inheritance goes to his children's children we we are those who can receive the baptism of the holy ghost so but in second kings 3 10 the king of israel said alas that the lord hath called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of moab so in other words let's let's blame it on god he's just not doing that anymore he don't work that way anymore but jehoshaphat said is there not here a prophet of the lord yes oh i love this let's find out what a prophet has to say about the situation yes is there not a prophet of the lord i would say well maybe it's supposed to be this way maybe god brought us out here just to leave us maybe the bride's not going to make it maybe there's not going to be a rapture is there a prophet of the lord are you with me tonight yeah is there a prophet of the lord here that we may inquire of the lord by him and one of the king of the israel's servants answered and said here is elisha the son of shephard which poured water on the hands of elijah now god always has a man let me believe that today god always has a man and he had a man named elisha now elisha had poured water he was a marvelous prophet he had a double portion of elijah's spirit and elijah was the old prophet he represented christ and elisha brother branham said represents the church the young prophet in second kings chapter two and verse one we find where elijah and elisha remember elijah goes and calls elisha away from his farm work and he goes and he follows him and it come to pass that the lord when the lord would take up elijah into heaven by a whirlwind that elijah went with elisha from gilgal and elijah said unto elisha terry here i pray thee for the lord hath sent me to bethel and elisha said unto him as the lord liveth and as thy soul liveth i will not leave thee so they went down to bethel and elijah said unto him we'll skip to verse four elijah said to him elisha terry here i pray thee the lord has sent me to jericho he said as the lord liveth and as i so liveth i will not leave thee so they came to jericho and you have to have an understanding when the prophet says something of what he's saying sure i'm sorry hon i'm going to take this off my wife told me not to take my jacket off tonight because my shirts wrinkled but y'all get over that i'm hot y'all not hot cause you're not working you come up here elijah said to elisha terry here now you know if people have quotes but is your does your quote fit the hour that you live in now think about it because he had a quote stay here yeah and a lot of people would have just stayed okay we'll stay here i got a quote for it but that's not what god wanted him to do right he was supposed to keep his eye on that prophet yeah right now he says stay here as the lord liveth as i so live with i will not leave thee so they came to jericho verse six and elijah said to him terry i pray thee here for the lord has sent me to jordan he said as the lord liveth and as i so liveth i will not leave thee and they too went on and verse 7 says in 50 men of the sons of the prophets went and stood to view afar of and they too stood by jordan so here's the here's the prophet here's the church here's the old prophet here's the new prophet which he said represents the church he said and elijah took his mantle and wrapped it together and smote the waters and they were divided hither and the others so that they too went over on dry ground and it came to pass when they were gone over so he sees him do this supernatural miracle he sees him do it but now watch he said the elijah said to elisha ask what i shall do for thee so they crossed the jordan you remember what i told you the other day brother brown sees the vision of himself standing on the map of israel he said i'm two-thirds of the way there remember in 1961 i'm two-thirds of the way there and there was the jordan but now we've come into the land of promises yes how many believe that today yeah we're in we're under the third pole we're under the opening of the word that's what we believe and so we're in the land of promises so elisha crosses over with elijah crosses over the jordan and then he said ask what i shall do for thee now notice he didn't say now here's what i'm going to do for you he said you ask amen but you've got to have a desire hold church we've got to have a desire to serve god we got to have a desire to hear the word we got to have a desire i want my kids to have a desire to come to church not because they're afraid daddy will beat them if they don't come not because they're afraid i'll i'll get on to them if they don't come but i want them to have a desire i want them to want to be in the house of god i want you to want to be in the house of god i know there's something inside of me though i'm tired and weary but i want to be in the house of the lord why is that for the herald it's something down on the inside god put it there but he wants you to express it ask what i shall do for thee before i'd be taken away from thee and elisha said i pray that you let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me oh my he said you've asked a hard thing nevertheless if you see me when i'm taken from thee it shall be so unto thee but if not it shall not be so enough he'd have stayed in guild golf he'd stayed in jericho he'd never seen him but the fact that he went with him crossed over jordan with him he didn't stay in his first poll or the second poll he went with him come on yeah amen and he crossed over jordan with him and now he's on the other side and he said you've asked a hard thing and it came to pass verse 11 as they still went on and talked behold there appeared a chariot of fire and horses of fire and parted them both asunder and elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven and elisha saw it and he cried my father my father the chariot of israel the horsemen thereof and he saw him no more he didn't come back the sons of the prophets thought he would and they waited on him but he didn't come back yeah he didn't come back he saw him no more he took hold of his own clothes and rent them in two pieces he took up also the mantle of elijah that fell from him and went back and stood by the bank of jordan oh i love it where all the promises lay yes that's what brother brandon said and he took the mantle of elijah that fell from him and smote the waters and he did not say where is elijah but he said where is the lord god of elijah and when also it spent in the waters they parted hither and the tether and elisha went over notice he said ask what you will and i'll do it yes and brother branham tells us in that sermon uh in the in the sermon that i was taking this from he tells them about the digging the ditches he wasn't afraid to ask elisha wasn't afraid that's why he was the man for the hour he wasn't afraid to ask he said i want a double portion of your spirit he said ask abundantly ask for great things believe for great things how many could do that tonight yes elijah took that man and walked down to the jordan stood there and the school of prophet said over there looking at him to see what he'd do and he took that mantle and doubled it back and forth and struck old jordan and said where is the god of elijah she divided one way and the other way a beautiful type of the church he said has come down through the lutheran age the method of stage the pentecost stage and now crossing the jordan yes amen notice when jesus and his disciples were about to go into the holy ghost dispensation he gathered them and he blessed them and and he said terry you in the city of jerusalem until you're endued with power from on high he told them that the things that i do show you also and greater this so you do and a double portion was promised there to the church and they went into the upper room and stayed until the day jesus was taken up and the same baptism the holy ghost that he had on him fell on the pentecostal people yes right that's the double portion and brother madam says this he said you people who claim to kiss the rim of the cup of the golden blessings of god we we claim a lot sure i'm just going to talk to you and we claim a lot we claim to be the bride the bride not a bride yeah we claim to be the bride yeah we claim to have the truth yes we claim to have an open book right we claim that the mysteries have been revealed that's what we claim we claim that the bible is the is the authority the word of god in our midst and that is completely open to us and that a power has been released upon us an anointing that we can do the greater works yes it's what we claim right that's what we claim we claim that and if we claim he said if you kiss the rim of the cup with the golden blessings of god who could sit still in such a day yes looks like a lot of people god help me who can sit still some of you are squirming in your seat but it ain't from joy man where's he going who can sit still in such a day see we're not shouting or rejoicing or or enthused about there being a pentecostal revival in 1906 we're not excited over speaking in tongues and all those things though those are wonderful what are we excited about we've we've kissed the rim of the cup with the golden blessings of god who can sit still in such a day hey man all they claimed to have was the restoration of the gifts but what we have is a restoration of all things yes yes sir that's what we have that's not what we're looking for it's what we have yes we have a double portion who could sit still when you have a double portion listen he said where is the god that was on jesus christ where is he that's what we can say today like elisha said where is the god of elijah we can stand there and say where is the god of william branham where is the god that was on jesus christ yes where is the spirit of god because he promised to send it back and he did where is he hey man he's going to make himself known i believe that where is he where is the god that was on jesus christ where is the one who knew the thoughts of the people's mind oh my and said the things that i do show you also and he said the baptism i'm baptized with you'll be baptized with the same in a double portion yes where is the god that was on jesus christ yes brother madam said he's here yes sweeping over this building right tonight yes yes sir oh do we realize that church can we recognize it we're not waiting on him to come where is the god of elijah he's here he's here on a sunday night he's here on a wednesday night he's here to meet your need do we believe that church he's here amen he's here sweeping over the building do we believe it the same holy ghost he said the trouble of it is you felt it yeah and you knew his presence is here but you're afraid to turn loose to it yes that's right if i think i'm pentecostal let them think what they want once you've tasted the grapes yes you can't go back and never be happy but the others went in because they tasted them with a spirit of doubt remember they all all 12 uh spies went into the land they all tasted the grapes but 12 of them or 10 of them rather came back with a bad report why did they come back with that report with an evil report because they tasted it but they didn't taste it in faith they didn't taste it thinking there's more where that come from they tasted and said well that was a good service but we better not go too far well that was pretty good but we don't want no we don't want no emotionalism around here that was pretty good but we don't we don't want to get into the word of the hour because we might get in trouble we might get it wrong how can we get it wrong when the holy spirit the writer or the author of the word is right here with us yes oh yeah many have gotten it wrong but why did they get it wrong they left him back there somewhere yes amen right the trouble is you're afraid to turn loose to it and then you begin to condemn something that you've never tried yeah sure you've never even turned yourself loose to it but you begin to condemn it second kings three and twelve joshua said the word of the lord is with him do we believe that today we still have a prophet the prophet of the hour william branham him in the word of the lord is with him so the king of israel and jehoshaphat and the king of edom went down to him and elisha said unto the king of israel what have i to do with thee get thee to the prophets of thy father the prophets of thy mother and the king of israel said unto him name but the lord hath called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of moab can't be no bride revival we're just going down can't do nothing about it and elisha said it's the lord of hosts liveth if it was just you too yeah i wouldn't look at you he said if it wasn't for the presence of jehoshaphat now remember jehoshaphat went down there with them he was backslid with them sure he went down there without the water but he was god's elect amen he was the king in david's line are you hearing me now the other one was a usurper a denominational usurper but here was the presence of the elect and so elisha said i wouldn't even speak i wouldn't even i wouldn't even regard you do you realize why the message came it wasn't just for them it was for us yes amen he said if it wasn't for jehoshaphat i wouldn't even regard you i wouldn't look toward thee nor see thee yes but now bring me a minstrel and it came to pass when the minstrel played that the hand of the lord came upon him now what about you people don't believe in music in the church what about that the minstrel began to play and spirit came on the prophet if music helped bring the spirit on a prophet it'll do the same thing tonight sure he said thus saith the lord make this valley full of ditches yes for thus saith the lord now there's a reason why you're going to make the valley full of ditches brother bran told told us in different places when he preached this sermon he said that elisha caught a vision of the rock that moses had in the wilderness yeah he said that rock was still putting out water yeah hallelujah and the problem was not a lack of water because the rock was still in the desert [Music] but the problem was they didn't have no vessels right they didn't have any ditches for the water to flow through right now watch the problem today is not a lack of water he said thus said lord you shall not see wind neither shall you see rain there's not another prophet coming not another great sweeping revival right but that valley will be filled with water yes yes oh i could preach for a while on that you're not going to see anything but he said don't despise the day of small things in an age when when it's not going to be a public show yeah but during that time yes oh my after you've gone on for seven ages and the church has gone without water but during that time there's still a rock yes in the desert and you won't see rain you you won't see any wind you won't see a thunderstorm but there'll be water in the ditches nothing you could drink in your cattle and your beasts and the spirit of the lord came on him began to look around he said thus saith the lord get out there and get to digging ditches you know why preaching is hard work it's not hard because you get to stand up here and talk to people that's not what's hard about it it's hard because you're digging you're digging ditches now i went up here the other day to the barbecue place down here to see if we still had a we're going to get some barbecue for the meetings one day at the meetings i won't tell you which day so you'll know you have to show up to all of it but we're getting some barbecue down here bob and sandy's i went down there and they just dug a fresh ditch and i've been studying on these things i've been up here praying and and just just just kind of looking at these things i didn't really write much down i just took everything i've said tonight just comes out that one book and and i i was beginning to think about and i went down there and they just dug a ditch across the top of that hill now if you've ever been up on that hill that's rocky man that's that's some hard digging and i got to looking at that and it was 100 degrees i got to think about danny and there was a there was a track or something sitting out there they'd been digging that with and i got thinking what if i had to dig that with a shovel number one you never dig that on top of this hill it'd just be nearly impossible you're digging in a dry country now the israeli desert was much like that it's a lot like the land around here it's really it's really rocky it's not a desert sand where you could dig in the sand but it's a really rocky hard kind of a place in that place where they were it's very difficult to dig it's like solid rock and so he's telling them he's not telling them to do an easy thing now remember they might have looked back at that and said lord elisha if we start digging our people are all going to be wore out they don't have no water anyway they got nothing to drink and they're going to be digging out there in the desert sun for hours digging ditches where there's no water you see the hard work of revival is done on sunday nights like this when you're digging it's done on wednesday nights when you don't feel like going to church but you go anyway yeah the the difficult work is done at home when you don't feel like pulling out your bible and getting your children around but you do it anyway the difficult work of revival is done when you're digging yes and so he said thus saith the lord go dig ditches yeah he didn't tell him to go find water water would already be there at the appointed time yes but go dig ditches now he promised us he said where two or three are gathered together in my name there am i in the midst yeah right in other words he's saying i'm already there because the two or three are there wherever they are i'm there right but you got to dig some ditches he said brother i'm telling you they went to digging now here's where it gets hard how's it going to come there ain't going to be no rain that's god's business to take care of that it's your business to dig ditches people have given up digging ditches yes i'm just preaching to you tonight people have given up digging ditches why they don't pray no more yeah they don't really seek the mind of god anymore they've given up digging ditches doing the hard work doing the sweaty work doing the work that makes you smell bad to the world they quit digging ditches and so when they quit digging ditches everybody just the church went on and the people went on but there's nothing there for the water to flow through right so you have a meeting and it just all runs off the top yeah the rock's there but there's nothing for the water because there's going to come a day when you're not in the meeting anymore you need the ditches to keep the water in you need a ditch to keep the water in and every time you go to a meeting you feel enthused and you go home but you haven't dug any ditches and so the water just runs off that's i don't want that to happen we're going to have some preachers in here and these brothers from here from the church are going to preach for you and then we're going to have a meeting and we'll be coming back from overseas i'm sure there'll be excitement and there'll be other brothers and people here but let us dig ditches now all right so we can see god come in our midst and it'll do something yes i'm tired of having a good service and going home and everything falls apart yeah i'm tired of seeing people come for a while and then begin to fade away and enthused for a while and begin to fade away but there's got to be something that has staying power there's got to be a water there's water in the desert start digging ditches and you begin to see it when you start doing the hard work with your family doing the difficult stuff yes that's when that's when god can fill up your ditch yes amen they went to digging and some of them said well i've got the digger but the deeper you go the more water you're going to have several times i was a kid i was going to divert a stream i remember we had a little stream running out there i think it was really a sewer but we played in it anyway a little stream running out there by the house and good worms come out of that we caught our fish and ate the fish it's two degrees removed from the sewer so we go out there and dig and that water come out of there and we we divert it but you know you you never dug a very deep hole because it's too much work and the water never stayed when the hot sun came it began to dry up why it's not deep enough but if you dig a ditch deep enough there will be water on monday water on tuesday water on wednesday some of y'all come to church on wednesday night the way you do because you haven't been digging ditches don't been done digging been going on there in the week and that's why what's the wednesday night sometimes so hard i know it's difficult sometimes i'm not getting on to your church but i just in my own heart i said lord help me to be a digger of ditches help me to be somebody that does the hard work i don't need the glory but let me get out there and sweat let me get out there in the heat let me get out there and do the praying let me get out there and do the and do the prep work let me get ready for the service let me dig the ditches hallelujah he said the water come out of that rock that rock has said that god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish a perishing people lived because of water from the smitten rock and he's a smitten rock to a perishing people the only hope of life that there is but brother madison the trouble of it is is you go to digging and the first thing you know you stick your shovel down and it you ever heard that sound clank oh no there's rock can you move [Laughter] unless you have to dig there well i just you gotta go get a jackhammer you gotta get something to break the rock why because you you got to have a hole for the water to be there what god wants is some ditches yes look but you dig down brother brown said the problem is you dig down you hit that rock it says pay ten percent yeah i'm not preaching on tithing tonight but that's what the prophet said that's the example he is dick 10 he said well i better just move on there believe that's deep enough you go hit that rock you start digging and you hit the rock and you hit maybe an old can or old piece of piece of metal been put in there from your childhood i said god don't move like that no more you're digging but you put that you begin to put that in and say well might as well just leave it there it'll keep the water from filling up sure you gotta dig that thing out you start digging the rocks you the problem is you'll only be blessed in this hour as much as you can receive the word you can only get a deep enough ditch as you can cope with the message of the hour so if you're doing things in your life that you know is wrong yeah sure the problems we have is not the things we don't know about but it's the things we do know about and if we're doing things and we try to justify them well i believe in grace and that's wonderful i believe in grace too but grace gives you the power to live the word and if you get to a place where you've dug down and you've hit that clink it's time to keep digging that's when you got to do the hard work that's when you need to get down to business with god and say lord if you said it i'm going to believe it i'm not going to question it i'm not going to doubt it i'm going to believe it you said for me to do it i'm going to do it you told me not to do it i won't do it it's that simple but things like that but the brand said oh dish pans and rocks and stones yes and he goes through in that hour and he goes through all kinds of different things the way the women dressed and and the way the people did he goes through all that and calls it names those rocks but i believe that you're spiritual enough people today that you can go yourself and find out what all those rocks are maybe it's a little doubt that you've allowed to stay in your in your mind yes maybe a little uh that that depressing depressing spirit that you you kind of dwell in that when you leave church and when you're not around the people of god you just kind of settle into that low and you just dwell there you need to get that rock out of the way those little spirits that come in and and and you don't really you know you think well there's no harm in it but brother branham preached against it yeah there's no harm in it but it's a rock and sometimes it thinks it's not even sin it's just junk yeah but brother batter said if you'll keep on digging brother and keep on digging dig them old doubts out dig them on dish pans and rocks and stones and things dig deep enough to throw it all out and get enough water flowing through there so you can get a good decent drink once in a while yes oh my he said you got to dig away from your church all right and what you can't let your church hold you back from digging ditches well everybody else does it doesn't make it right right everybody else does that same way that i do everybody else does the same things that i do don't make it right you got to dig away from your church dig away from this stick away from that dig into christ jesus i'm not telling you to do things that are that are just legalistic uh things that people have added to the word i'm talking about this dig down to you can cope with this dig into christ you see digging in the desert is hard work as we said you get sweaty and you get tired but i want to ask you tonight these musicians would come we'll close the service are you willing to dig and i had to come to terms with this myself this week because i don't like doing new things i like doing things other people have done because you see it at work you know i don't like making waves we're about to go to a part of the world that i'm very many people go to and we face some resistance and things some different things have happened and it's not a it's not a real comfortable place to be and i got to thinking about that but am i willing to dig and find out if it's the will of god am i willing to dig and i've just been digging down into that and what's stopping up the water and i would ask you tonight are you willing to dig i'm not telling you to do one thing or not do but are you willing to dig are you willing to cope with the word are there certain tapes you can't listen to because it bothers you have an evangelist come in once in a while and there's things that he says and maybe and it just oh you you just can't hardly take that it's a rock it's in the way you can't be blessed by the service because you've got a perception of something that's wrong see if it's the word or not throw away the rocks digging to christ are you willing to dig what's stopping up the water and all of us know him not all of us are the same level as far as we don't all emote in the same way we don't all have the same same response to the word but we ought to have a response are you digging enough what's keeping you from being able to enjoy the services you say well it's the song leader or it's the preacher or something else what's keeping you from being able to enjoy the presence of god you know he's here you felt him what's keeping you from being able to enjoy i know this is kind of an evangelistic service tonight but i just i want it to be that i want us to just really think and and just kind of dig down in our own hearts what's stopping it up is it worldliness is it social media what's stopping it up i'm on social media i've got several social media accounts and sometimes i gotta i gotta take them off and i'll tell you with this you got to get you got to dig down until you get the rock of pride out or the rock or the social media will come back and what i mean is it's hold over you because it's not the thing itself that's the problem the thing is you got pride praise god anyway joel did you have a message tonight what's stopping up the water the internet i tell you what i sometimes i'll catch myself i don't have my phone up here with me there's a reason for that it wasn't my phone the other day that was ringing it was brother john baducus he's on a different time frame than us people didn't realize he was in church but what what is it is it the is it internet because sometimes like i said i'll pick up my phone and i'll and i'll go to the bible app i'll go there for the purpose of reading something will pop up it's not nothing bad news i need to know that but did i need to know it as much as i needed my soul fed i'm just talking to you now as your pastor entertainment is is it a rock has it become a rock it keeps you because you your kids are so entertained that they're born in church what about an unforgiving spirit you're not gonna you're not gonna feel the blessings of god the way you should you're not gonna be able to carry it in those ditches if they're full of unforgiveness i'm inviting you tonight to dig that out sometime between now and the meeting sometime between now and the next service let's say get down to business with god whether it's tonight at the altar or tomorrow when you go to work you get down to business with god and you begin to say lord whatever is keeping the water from moving like it should let me get rid of it let me be willing to do the hard work of digging so that i can feel your presence again so that i can walk where you want me to walk so i don't have to sit in church and wonder if it's true or not let me feel the unction of the holy spirit again let me know what it is to have his presence within me moving and leading and guiding in my life lord i'm willing to dig is that your desire tonight to set your prayer i'm willing to do what it takes to have a ditch let them call me what they want to an old ditch digger that's okay i'll be an old-time christian that still believes in praying still believes in working not because i have to not because i could work my way to salvation but because he did so much for me and i want the presence of that rock that rock bought my freedom that rock gave me water it produced something in my life that began to life begin to come out and everything that i am i owe to the rock and if the ditches started to get stopped up let me dig it out let me do the hard work and i can't do it for you it's your pastor i wish i could you got to do the digging you got to do the praying but if you'll dig i promise you there's a blessing coming make this valley full of ditches so that when we have a meeting it won't all just run over the top people run and jump and shout and scream and that's wonderful but it won't just all just run over the top it's like that hill our lives are like that hill it'll all just run off it's full of rocks needs some ditches so you can keep some water around when you need it hallelujah let's bow our heads together it's my job to preach to you i don't get any reward for that but lord help me to dig maybe you can do that in your seat i if you want to come pray this alters for prayer we've got we got room we got ultra all the way around here it's built for that purpose people coming to pray [Music] if you want to pray you're welcome to come but i come down here myself and when i pray and i really get down to business with god many times i'll walk and i walked all across this platform on friday all across the front of the of the thing and i wasn't necessarily praying for you although i usually do when i come out here in the auditorium i come out here and pray for you but that's not what i did i said there's a lord help me dig help me dig as a pastor i get so busy sometimes and i get to going here and doing this and doing that lord help me dig so that every service whatever blessings would come out of that rock i'd have a ditch to put it in help me dig lord and i just began to repent of some things and get rid of some things and i know that if i had some some stones to get rid of maybe you've got something to get rid of tonight why don't you just let him go why don't you let yourself loose to the holy spirit and let him begin to move in your life whatever it is he wants you to do why don't you just do that sometimes we need a prayer meeting that prayer meeting i can't it's one thing to call it up here and i could but i want you got to pray for yourself at some point you're the only person that's got the pick and the shovel that can dig your ditch somebody's got to do it it might as well be you you're the one who can do it best you know what's there i believe the holy spirit is the discerner of the thoughts intents of the heart you just ask him lord help me get rid of everything so i can be blessed i don't want it so i can appear to be more holy to the people but i want to be blessed sorry i want your holy spirit to be able to flow through my life and i know i can't do that with certain things dwelling in my life lord help me let me get rid of it every thought every doubt of unbelief every every spirit would come against the word dig it out lord heavenly father that's my prayer tonight lord help us to dig i i feel like lord that you've helped me and i've done some of the hard work and dug and dug and dug today but oh god help these people or to pick up their shovels pick up their their picks and their and whatever tools that they have if they've got a great big backhoe maybe they need one maybe they can use it to begin to dig out the problems and the situations and the frustrations and the lack of trust the lack of the lack of ability to to really believe in what you have to say or to help them to dig it out today oh god we don't want to see one that the water would just run off of or we appreciate your spirit when you're here but lord we want to do the hard work so that when you come it wouldn't run off somewhere but that it could stay in our families it could be there when our children get sick it could be there when we have a need lord because we know you're the one who meets all of our needs we thank you for your grace today oh god we thank you for the grace that enables us to dig gives us the strength and the courage to get down and dig because the promise is there will be water lord and so we dig with faith lord not endowed in frustration but in faith today believing that the water will be there when the time comes oh god we pray you granted today we thank you for it thank you for this day and the things that you've done oh god as we continue through the rest of this service and we go into wednesday night and lord may we dig ditches lord

comes up to her and just kind of scares her wakes her up and walks away and it made the news it went viral because she'd been touched by the star and she waited all night until she was so tired that she fell asleep she had an expectation of what that concert would bring i wonder if we'd come to church like that sure brother banner said this holy ghost had the same effect that wine does on the
