thank you for bringing us together one more time on a sunday morning honor your resurrection lord it's not about us today it's about you fathers we come to worship you and offer our praise and our thanksgiving help us to get ourselves out of the way our own feelings what we want lord out of this service and me lord you provide us what we need today i pray god that you would just move me out of the way and speak somehow lord through lips of clay i pray lord that there would not be one person in your divine presence this morning that would not be changed lord and made a better christian lord than what they were when they came in father there's one loss this morning that would hear this that's here this morning or maybe that would watch the service lord i i pray especially for them today that backslider lord for that one that's not where they should be with you i pray god that you just reach down convict them of sin lord help them to understand lord how close we are to the end time and what time it is lord and what they should be doing father and and we thank you lord that you won't lose a one and we're thankful for that today father i pray you'd heal the sick lord where there's one that is in need i pray that you would touch their body father we know that you are a healer you are our healer you're the god who heals all of our diseases so we speak and claim that promise and apply that prescription today and believe lord that you'll do it ask these things in your precious name amen god bless you you can be seated this morning it's good to see everybody out this morning i want you to remember next week but aaron oglesby will be here we'll have two services at 10 o'clock at 3 o'clock aaron's a great minister of the gospel and a young man i say young he's probably older than me but but he's a great minister and we'll be glad to have him here this next weekend but that'll be our dinner as well we won't have church the wednesday night before thanksgiving so we'll do something try to do something special my wife will contact some of you about that i don't think we'll have a maybe turkey because you'll be eating that all week probably but but maybe something different but we'll have a church dinner if you can be here with us and and you trust i trust the lord will help us with that and help us to do that safely and then i've heard that some struggling still with coba and different things and you tell bill that we're praying for him and and i know that's a difficult situation with his wife being sick anyway and different ones struggling good to have all of you in the house of the lord this morning i mean isn't it good to be in the house of god and no matter what you come in here with you can you can lay your burdens down and just let god work today amen that's what we want to do um so remember that and coming up and then brother stewart will be speaking for us wednesday night so be here on wednesday night if you can to hear that amen the lord willing brother stewart will be here on wednesday night amen let's stand together again sorry to have you up and down luke chapter 15 verse 11. this might be a strange subject to preach to a church full of christian people but i think it'll apply in ways that maybe we didn't think of to our our lives and i preach by inspiration i don't mean that i don't have notes because i do take notes if i didn't have notes we'd be here a long time but i preached my inspiration the fact that i have to be inspired to the thought to preach something and and i was inspired to this this week and i don't know why but i believe that god has something for every one of us and so as the old saying is if the shoes don't fit don't wear it but if it does then we should put it on and the word of god always helps us to understand you know and many times when we look at these things we think thank god for your grace i was that prodigal i was that one who was lost and god found me in the pig pen and you're grateful for that today and i'm grateful for that and so you can have the love of god who can show you the love of god in your life and your in your heart luke chapter 15 and verse 11 he said a certain man had two sons and the younger of them said to his father father give me the portion of goods that followeth to me and he divided unto them his living and not many days after the younger son gathered all together and took his journey into a far country and there wasted his substance with riotous living when he had spent all there arose a mighty famine in that land and he began to be in want and he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country he sent him into his fields to feed swine and would feign have filled his belly with the husk that the swine did eat no man gave unto him and when he came to himself i love that when he came to himself he said how many hired servants of my father's bread enough and to spare and i perish with hunger i will arise and go to my father will say unto him father i have sinned against heaven and before thee and i'm no more worthy to be called thy son make me as one of thy hired servants and he arose and came to his father but when he was yet a great way off his father saw him hurt you glad for that today and had compassion and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him and the son said unto him father i have sinned against heaven and in thy sight and am no more worthy to be called thy son but the father said to his servants bring forth the best robe put it on him put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet and bring hither the fatted calf and kill it let us eat and be merry for this my son was dead and is alive again he was lost in his found and they began to be mary i pray the lord without his blessing to the word you may be seated this morning while driving along a country road after a rainstorm a man saw a farmer standing by a recently collapsed barn the driver stopped and asked him what happened and the farmer replied the roof fell in he said it leaked so long it finally rotted through the stranger asked the farmer he said why didn't you fix it before it got so bad and the farmer replied this way he said well when the weather was good there wasn't a need for it when the rains come it was too wet so finally it just fell in i want to speak to you today on a title of prodigal why not you know i want to look at the excuses that the prodigal must have made to maintain his standing outside the home until finally he came to himself and you know when we make excuses for our condition we become victims of circumstance and i've found and i think most of you would agree with this that the biggest difference between those who are happy and those who are unhappy in life is not his attitude not circumstances it's not so much what happens to you but it's your reaction to what happens to you right haven't you found that's what really gets you in trouble is when you react in the wrong way and and if you constantly let everybody else control you and and your attitude then you're never going to get anywhere in life it's always going to be the church it's always going to be the people it's always going to be the pastor it's always going to be those preachers or those people or that person or my family or my parents but if you could ever get to the point where i i believe i'm a creator a miniature creator i can create an atmosphere of positivity in my life i'm not bound to these circumstances around me i can overcome that and when when you get to that place then you quit making excuses for your life someone who said excuses are like moses we all have one the mother of a grade school wrote a note to her son's teacher once and the note read please excuse jimmy for being he says it was his father's fault she meant to say being late but it's probably appropriate please excuse jimmy for being if you're going to start making excuses you could jc just start making excuses for being alive right and you know i want to challenge that today and in my own life and then especially though to those who maybe would make excuses for not coming to church or not not believing the gospel maybe you're that person maybe you know someone like that maybe you maybe have children that are that way and they would come back but there's always some reason why they don't and i don't mean to be hard toward those people today because we all make excuses sometimes why we don't do what we know we should do but aren't you glad for the grace of god that one day you can come to yourself and say hey this i know this is where i'm supposed to be regardless of everything else around me now the parable that jesus tells of the prodigal describes two settings it describes on one side a happy home a loving father a fatted calf clean clothes a ring of significance on the other side of muddy field of pigs look at the contrast between the two a happy home contrasted with a field of pigs a citizen of a far country who he barely knows husk to eat instead of a fatted calf filthy rags to wear and no place to belong and the question that i have is not why would he go back but why would he stay in the pigpen why wait so long it seems like such a clear choice doesn't it on one side here he's in the mud and and he's feeding the pigs and he's wishing he could eat that food that he's feeding the pigs and here on the other side he's got everything that he a man could ever want and yet the very advantages that he has on this side i'll make this the good side so you all can be okay today those of you on the left are just in trouble you all be in the pig pen and over here is a happy home but on this side if we could just look at it like that he's got everything he ever wanted but all of those advantages when you have the wrong attitude towards them become just excuses and if you could imagine the kind of the thought that he would begin to think that these things that are advantageous to me are not really advantages they're really the reasons why i don't go back now the word prodigal means wasteful we it's come to mean someone who strays but it's not actually the meaning of it is someone who wastes his substance and how many people have we found that wastes the things that god gave them the talents the abilities the gifts that god gave them the ability and i it always strikes you when you see someone who was very gifted someone who's able to help in the church someone who's able to to preach or to sing or to do something like that and or maybe somebody who's gifted to make money and finances are different ways and yet they use it for the devil and they backslide and go out into the world and you look at that and say what a waste it is what a wasted life you see a young person that could be a preacher's wife or a young man that could be a minister of the gospel and you see them out taking drugs shooting up their veins and and their teeth rotting out and or maybe you see them in just some kind of job where they're working seven days a week and they don't have time for god they don't have time for the things of god and you look at that and think what a horrible waste that that is they may not realize it but they're wasting their prodigal they're wasting the substance that god gave them well i pray that we would never waste the opportunities that god gives us the abilities for the david and ability to sing and ability to play an ability to preach whatever that it is that you might have whatever that is there's a there's an ability there's a substance that you've been given by god and but see the prodigal son wanted his substance now so he could use it for himself and so he went into a far country and wasted it and that's what so many people do but if you could only realize that that kind of life is so unfulfilled because you might be able to do that and i've told you about my friend here recently and and he's been on my mind because he was a singer in church and a great musician and now today he sings in the bars and i look at him and think what a wasted opportunity but yet what an opportunity that he could have to to come back and and and to come out of that pigpen and yet the excuses are all there well my family was like this and my church was like this and my pastor was this a hard man and and so i just buried my talent and went on and did what whatever i wanted to do with it and not realizing that there was something so much greater that god wanted to do in his life but yet it's not too late as long as there's breath there's hope as long as there's breath there's hope and maybe you're sitting there today maybe you're at home and and you're wondering do i have hope is there hope for me i'm 50 i'm 60 i'm 80. there's still hope for you you don't have to waste the rest of your life if you're alive there's still something left for you to do prodigal why not why not i think we asked the wrong questions it should be such a no if you'll excuse the expression a no-brainer to come back to live for god not just to go to this church or another church but to go to church to have god in your heart to feel the the sense that your sins are forgiven by the salmon what would you trade for that no matter what you've done in the past no matter how far you've gone what would you trade for that understanding and that that knowledge and that that ability to believe that the blood has covered all of my sins and they've been put away in the depths of the sea of god's forgetfulness i don't have to i don't have to answer for those things anymore i'm not bound to drugs anyone i'm bound to alcohol i'm not bound to the things of the world i'm free today but when the prodigal was home his first excuse was probably that it was an unhappy home it was an unhappy home because for him he'd never been in the pig lot he'd been protected from the elements he didn't know hunger he didn't know what it was like to have to deal with those things and yet the very security which he had he took his bondage and the happiness he identified as hypocrisy and the father recognized his son's unhappiness but he doesn't try to force him to stay home and what this parable teaches us is something about the love of god because he doesn't he does not force him to stay home a forced religion is something that'll make you unhappy and god wants us to be happy the father gives his son his inheritance the younger of them in luke 15 12 said to his father father give me the portion of goods that falleth to me and he divided unto them his living brother branham says god does not force man to do anything you do it on your own free will he can warn you throw a barricade across your path but you walk your own self with your own decision in his presence to make him your savior the very fact that he gives you that choice it's proof of his goodness they tell me and excuse me i know it's a little bit different this morning i'm taking it kind of slow but i really want to make sure that we're following this today einstein believed in god because he knew that there had to be a beginning he was smart enough to know that things just didn't create themselves out of thin air there had to be something that began if you go back to the even the smallest atom or molecule but he struggled with the idea of free will and his theory was that if god is omniscient and passes judgment on men for exercising their own free will he passes judgment on himself he couldn't see the love of god all he could see was the god that allowed hunger and all the things all the killing and the things that are allowed and then judges man for doing those things he just couldn't accept that he couldn't accept an omniscient god would give free will but the very fact that god gives you that choice even knowing what you'll do with it but the very fact that he gives it to you it says love and i would like to present that to you today and if a person is gone you'd say well you know i wish that god would have kept me if he wanted me he should have kept me in church he should have kept me living for him no the fact that he gave you a choice is proves that he loves you and the fact that you're still there today and able to make a choice to come back is proof that he loves you the bible says the lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count sadness but it's long suffering to us we're not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance so he's not putting it off putting off judgment because he's slack because he's just negligent in his duties but he's putting it off because he loves you i like to think that a kentucky hillbilly understood what the great scientist einstein couldn't and that's the love of god he said it this way he said we know that if we could draw a picture of the love of god 10 million times more than the seas of this earth he said banked into one tube a few inches across he said would reach billions of miles beyond the stars and thinking of the pressure that there would be on the bottom of that tube what a word picture the love of god so great that it's it's like if you could put it in a tube it'd be billions of miles beyond the stars 10 million times more than the seas of the earth he said in the pressure there would be on the bottom of that tube how about water with all them billions of tons of pressure trying to press down and yet the love of god is searching our hearts tonight great powers of strength that he would like to find listen one little crevice amen to leak through he said to come into our lives and give us this great power and unction beyond even man's understanding see einstein couldn't see that all he could see was god judging men for things that he allowed them to do but a prophet of god stood there and said the love of god is so great that it's like the pressure at the bottom of that tube that's millions of miles long and the pressure that would be so great that it would press into every crevice that it could find isn't that how god deals with your life isn't that how he deals with mine that he actually presses himself the love of god is so so precious to us and it comes down and he pushes and presses himself into every crevice of our life until we find him when we're in need and when we're sick and when we're hungry and when we're when we need something in our minds when we're upset all of a sudden that that love of god pushes its way through when we're obstinate when we when we don't want to serve him when we don't do what we should do the love of god comes down anyway and people could just see that the love of god is there he's pressing but what keeps him back our own choice our own free will brother brahma expressed it this way he said father many are wayward they don't mean to be that way lord maybe some of them in here tonight drunkards he said maybe people that's done stepped over the line went on to immoral acts and done everything that's wrong like that but god you still love them or can you you just feel the pressure of that love it's coming down it did here's a man that's done everything wrong and done here's a woman that's done everything wrong look at the woman at the well look at the one who's caught in the act of adultery and here's that that pressure of god's love funneled down into a body called the son of god and when he come on the earth what did he do he just pressed into every crevice and every crack and everything that could possibly be don't you see him doing that in your own life huh he comes down and and tells them go and sin no more why he says everything was wrong like that but god you still love them he said no will you save them tonight lord excuse me will you bring that poor wandering backsider no matter if he's setting out light and condemned feels that maybe he's crossed the separating line no he hasn't your spirit's still calling as long as it calls you're wanting your wandering child to come home and here's what it is with the heart it's not that you sit there and you think well i've just done too much that's too bad there's no way that i can do it but remember when you feel like that you haven't crossed the separating line because if you had you wouldn't want it but the spirit's still calling he said as long as it calls you're wanting your wondering child to come home he's just that love of god is just pressing into that the crevices of your heart pressing in every way that he can don't you hear him calling can't you feel that in the service when you sit in the presence of god and yet we do so many things that are wrong we make so many mistakes we're prodigal we waste in so many ways and yet god comes down and just pushes into every little crevice of our heart as long as it calls you're wanting your wandering child to come home may sit there and think well he doesn't want me anymore but don't you see the very fact that you're able to even think those thoughts prude said he wants you proof said he loves you he said as long as it calls you're wanting wanting your wandering child to come home won't you grant it tonight father that the holy spirit bring conviction in the audience and bring many wandering children to thee for we ask it in his name paul expressed it like this he said the goodness of god leads you to repentance songwriter expressed it this way the love of god is greater for and tongue or pen can ever tell it goes beyond the highest star reaches to the lowest hell the guilty pair bowed down with care god gave his son to win his airing child he reconciled and pardoned from his sin that all love of god how rich and pure how measureless and strong it shall forevermore endure the saints and angels song no wonder einstein couldn't grasp it the love of god was so great that it couldn't even be grasped under the law couldn't even be understood until god wrapped himself in flesh come down and lived among us so the young man probably thought he had an unhappy home and didn't know didn't recognize how happy it was if he was making excuses he might make the excuse he had an unloving father and the farther away from home he journeyed the more he was convinced that if the father really loved him he wouldn't have let him leave your your mind place tricks on you because what will happen is you'll leave and then you'll blame god for letting you leave if well if he really loved me he'd have arrested me he'd have stopped me he wouldn't have given me this money so i could waste it he wouldn't have given me these talents so i could waste it if you really love me but you see the father knew that he would never love him like he should in his original condition are you hearing me today the father knew that the prodigal would never love him like he should he loved him but he knew the son would never love him back as long as he had that happy home as long as he had them nice clothes as long as he had that ring it was significant as long as he had all these things he would never love him back so he let him go so he would learn to love him and the bible says not many days after the younger son gathered all together and took his journey into a far country and there wasted his substance with riotous living and that's the natural reaction of the sinners to be so far away from god as to not feel conviction and yet as jesus said of the pharisees he said this people draw nigh unto me with their mouth and honor me with their lips but their heart is far from me it's possible to be close and be far away in your heart i would tell you this morning that i've never wondered as far as from church i've never left i've always went to church i've always tried to serve god in that way but i've wondered in my heart i think all of us could say that you can point back to a time when you wonder maybe you always knew the message was right and you always believe the bible you always believe the scripture but you've wondered in your heart the heart leaves first i've watched it over and over over the years a person doesn't just leave church their heart leaves first if the heart is right there's not much you could do to run a child of god out of church unless it was something wrong or ungodly or against the word but the heart leaves and once the heart leaves then the person leaves and you know they may go somewhere else for a while and but their their heart left and so they end up leaving completely i hate to see that not because they leave the church i i wish i could tell you this i wish i you know i wish i could explain it to you but my heart's just as happy when i see a sinner saved in another church as it is in ours i really believe that i'm not saying that with guile or trying to convince you of something but it's just the truth i uh we're in this together you know we put our rose-colored glasses on and think that well uh you know with somebody else's across the street that you know we can do without them but no we really can't there's not enough of us to fight amongst ourselves and so i'm i'm perfectly happy for somebody to come back but i hate to see somebody leave church they'd see somebody quit coming as often as they once didn't quit doing those things because you know that the heart leads first and you can watch it as they go and you can see the spirit of god calling to that person come home come back come home so many times we turn it down the heart leaves first before the son left home he must have convinced himself perhaps he convinced himself that the father loved him less than he did his older brother satan convinced steve of something like that when he said the serpent said to the woman you shall not surely die for god doth know that the day you eat thereof your eyes will be opened and you shall be as gods knowing good and evil in other words he said the only reason he doesn't want you to go is because he wants you to keep from fully experiencing the pleasure of life at first when the prodigal son left that must have seemed true right because there is as hebrews 11 25 tells us there is pleasure in sin for a season so it must have seemed true but even the season of pleasure is a slippery slope and psalm 73 and 18 tells us that speaking of those that continue on as if nothing had ever happened and yet they turn against god or they never they're wicked in their ways and it says surely thou had set them in slippery places thou cast him down into destruction an early american preacher named jonathan edwards preached a sermon called sinners in the hands of an angry god and he explained that even the natural forces of gravity pull the center towards hell it's like like they're standing on or they're up they're hanging in the air and they're going to come down it's just a matter of time in fact the sinner preaching that sermon is already in a condition of hell you know he's already if he's living that way he's already there and brother branham taught us that only the mercies of god hold them up and yet we say well god doesn't love me the prodigal son probably said the father doesn't love me but the fact that he let him go and let him live like that huh and he didn't didn't kill him didn't strike him dead didn't didn't persecute him let him go was proof that he loved him jonathan edwards uses this scripture deuteronomy 32 35 when he preaches that sermon he said to me belong with vengeance and recompense their foot shall slide in due time their foot shall slide in due time it's not a matter of if it's a matter of when and we can say it this way how can you say he doesn't love you if he hasn't already sent you to hell we don't realize what sin is just just the things that we've done today just the disobedience we've exhibited this week or this month is enough to send us to hell just being born the way we were born is enough to send us to hell yet you can't be lost if you're a son of god why the mercy of god the grace of god the power of god comes in and he saves you from that but therefore shall side and do time those that are destined to that will end up there there it's just a matter of time but it's his long suffering is his grace to even to them but especially to the elect that he doesn't judge us now but the blood covers our sins aren't you glad for that today we judge ourselves by the word now perhaps the prodigal thought that surely the father loved the other brother more what a mistake you see every day the father looked out for his welfare every night he prayed that he would come home you know when you're making excuses everything is an excuse right you've seen people that didn't want to be in a marriage right when you don't want to be in a marriage everything's wrong you may have loved the way she cooked him eggs when you wanted to be in that marriage but then one day i don't know why i'm going down this line but just hang with me for a moment but you may love those eggs when you really you know but all of a sudden you don't like them no more all of a sudden that nothing's right you pick at everything but be careful if you find yourself in that condition because you're on your way out right and you learn to love it if it's from somebody you love right the way that they look the way that they wear their clothes the way everything about them you love them if it's somebody that you love but when you lose that love you begin to pick at them begin to make excuses and i'm sure the prodigal son began to make an excuse about the food he got tired of eating the same old food now remember he he's already you look at all these advantages that he had and why would he say in the pig pen it's because he thought the father didn't love him he thought he was trying to hold him back from experiencing this true pleasure he thought that he was going to he was trying to keep him from being everything that he could be he thought his home was unhappy he thought the father didn't love him he thought that old fatted calf was boring how many people today have gotten bored with the message of the hour it's amazing how bored you can get by the preaching of the word when your heart's not right it's amazing how you don't want to hear the tapes tomorrow when your heart's not right it's amazing how you don't want to you don't want to listen you don't want to hear from god anymore you you get uncomfortable in a service where the worship's going on and where people are worshiping when you don't want to when your hearts are right why because it's just like i talked about the example of marriage it's like in a marriage when someone's doing something they shouldn't what happens they they don't even want to even do the little things the hugging and the kissing and all those things they don't want to do that because their heart's not right they want to be offended and so the the backside when they when they make excuses they want to be offended they look at these things and think well the food it's not what it's cracked up to be didn't help me none you see even god's children in the old testament got tired of manna which is ironic because it's perfect food no contaminants imagine trying to get fat on manna right you couldn't you couldn't get diabetes from it or high blood pressure because god made it it's angel food it's perfect and it just falls out of the skies all you got to do is go get it right i mean that's pretty easy right seems like people would be happy with manna you know but there's something about human beings that are never happy numbers 11 and 4 says the mixed multitude that was among them and remember when israel come out they come out with a mixed multitude of egyptians and other races that come out with them they didn't come out for the same reasons that the israelites did but they were there and they began to follow a lusting and the children of israel also wept so when the mixed multitude started it the children of israel started it and said who shall give us flesh to eat we remember the fish which we didn't eat in egypt freely the cucumbers and the melons and the leeks and the onions and the garlic now of all things that you could look back on and say well i wish i had more garlic you see the food that god provided wasn't spicy enough for him that's why people make up these false doctrines the food that god provided is not spicy enough for people and so so they make up something and they put some few ingredients in there that don't belong but god said what i had is perfect what i provided is right why would we want to go back to something else for the chicken why would we want to go back if you come out of denominations why would you want to go back to that the food that was provided for us is perfect food it's angel's food amen it's something that will keep us healthy until we get to the other side i mean they should have been able to look and say man these pair of shoes has lasted for a long time they should have been able to look so there's no diseases among us they should have been able to look at god's blessings but instead they said we want garlic we'd like to have some onions you know people get tired of going to church they get tired of hearing the preacher they get tired of the word of god they're not getting tired of the preacher they're getting tired of the word are you tired reading your bible it's the same old thing every time i look at it but don't you know if you look at it with a heart that's right every time you look at it it'll be something new but you get tired of it because oil don't have no garlic in it ain't no ain't no hollywood garlic in in the word of god can't find no no detective stories no nothing like that that we would you know we get to feeding on stuff and we say well if i just had some garlic if it just made me feel good sometimes it condemns me and i wish it just made me feel better but it's not hollywood garlic or onions or leeks or cucumbers or melons but it's god's provided food they said but now our soul is dried away there is nothing at all besides this manna just this angel's food we don't have nothing else to eat preacher keeps coming and preaching the message of the hour every service he comes and he preaches and he tells us about a prophet tells us about god what he did and what he said and he tells us all about the home that we're going to in a rapture and things like that we've been feeding on this for a long time we're getting tired of it but it's about time we begin to reacquaint ourselves with the manna and recognize there's something good in it the people speak against god verse numbers 21 5 and against moses wherefore he said have you brought us up out of egypt to die in the wilderness for there is no bread neither is there any water and our soul loatheth we're disgusted by this light bread imagine somebody becoming disgusted by the message people do our soul loatheth this light bread we're tired of hearing it we want something different the proverbs i love the way solomon puts this he said the full soul loatheth the honeycomb but to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet god help us to be hungry you see when the prodigal left he probably ate things he never had been allowed to eat before delicacies of egypt that fed the senses the garlic the onions the leeks starved the soul the fatted calf had become common to him he wanted something different brother branham speaks about it about the israelites in the canaan or in the wilderness he said oh this old light bread angel's bread well what do we care about this whole light bread our souls loatheth this stuff and everything is wrong everything is wrong well we could dwell on that for a moment have you ever been in that you ever woke up on a monday morning and everything is wrong well that's the way they woke up one morning everything was wrong our souls loathe with this light bread everything is wrong and this old man that falls out every night why we would rather have some garlic and leak out of egypt he said you see their hearts wasn't ready for the journey that's why they got bored their hearts wasn't ready oh church we're on a journey we're going home but our hearts have to be right to go to to really appreciate the things that we have their hearts wasn't ready for the journey to to really take advantage of what god has provided us for the journey our hearts have to be right brother brother said when a man or woman begins to complain about going to church they get so tired of going to church they're not ready for the journey so that's right there's something wrong somewhere oh god help us it can become old to all of us don't you know that you know if you're in the same place and you people talk about it becoming boring to listen to a preacher you ought to try preaching sometime man i love it when we have one of these brothers up here brother stewart did such a good job wednesday night or brother allen rather than but the stewards are going to preach wednesday night and they did they do such a good job i love it when somebody else preaches brother aaron's coming in this weekend i love that why because it feeds me because you get tired of of giving this good man out and never not not getting into yourself sometimes or maybe as much as we should be getting but see it it gets boring both ways but you got to keep your eye on the goal you got to recognize your heart you got to keep your heart right because if you don't keep your heart right as a minister you'll end up feeding people stuff you shouldn't be feeding them you'll end up feeding on stuff you shouldn't be feeding on right because you get so tired of going to church you get so tired of preaching you get so tired of singing you get so tired of all the things that are going on there say well we just do the same thing every sunday but if god wanted us to do that until he come wouldn't that be a small sacrifice for all that he's given us i don't say he does but if he wanted us to you say well everything's not exactly like we want it to be or if we only had a better this or better that or a better preacher or whatever than it is but remember if god wants this for us until the end time i say god help me to accept it help me to stay with it help me to put everything i got behind it because i'm going home i'm not just here for here i don't belong here i'm a pilgrim and a stranger on this earth i'm going out i'm leaving this pigpen i'm taking a journey to the sky so when a man and woman gets tired begins to complain about going to church they get so tired of going to church they're not ready for the journey when we complain about the food we've been provided we reinforce the excuse of the prodigals i don't mean so much my preaching you're welcome to complain about my preaching i'll be right there with you but you know when we get tired of the message we begin to complain about the restrictions that are placed on us as believers we don't realize we don't recognize this is our safety this is legalism this is inducing no this is our safety look at the world it's going crazy this is a place god has provided for us to be safe from these things but you begin to complain about it and if we're not careful we reinforce the excuses of the prodigals you know if i go by a restaurant if you travel much you know you may get on the internet see good reviews about a certain place you go by and you look at a restaurant especially if i want to go in and eat all mcdonald's are basically the same well not exactly but i went to mcdonald's in the philippines and bought a egg mcmuffin it tasted just like the ones we have here but home restaurants and ones where they have supposedly home cooking and if you ever went by one at dinner time or maybe on a friday night about six o'clock you drive by and there's one car and you're pretty sure that's the cook and it don't matter how good the reviews were who told you and let if there's some if there's another opportunity down the road you say well let's just go on to mcdonald's because if it was good the locals would know right people come by the church say well if the locals won't go people you know and people you take your own kids we teach them to dislike the message sometimes huh well if mom and dad don't care nothing about it why should i if all i hear around the table is just griping about one preacher or another what you know why should i care if all i hear is is how many bad things are happening and what the church did what they did wrong and how this one did this one wrong this one did this one wrong why would i go to church we're just reinforcing the excuse of the problems and you go and say lord save my children lord save us first that was free i don't know where that come from but the locals won't go why should i they won't feed on the word why should i but god help us we've got good food here you got good food here if all i did was just read scripture all morning there's good food there if these brothers get up here and preach there's good food they begin to preach about the word of god and inspire drawers it's good food if you'll just take advantage of it amen he probably got made excuses i won't keep you going all day i just got five of these this is number four so we're close to the end maybe you remember it was the differences you remember the differences it was the happy home the pig lot huh the loving father the citizen of a far country clean clothes filthy rags a ring of significance just over here he don't even belong all these things but he just uses these as excuses you know the prodigal was probably embarrassed by the clothes he had to wear those unfashionable clothes a new robe didn't seem so nice when it was different from everybody else's he didn't dislike them because they weren't nice and clean and warm but because they identified him with home he'd rather for some reason be identified with those in walmart clothes say two things about you what you think about yourself and what you want other people to think about you remember that and you know the world's gone crazy in that way physically but i want to look at more than just just natural clothes but many prodigals would come home if they just didn't have to wear those clothes and so some preachers get by with just not preaching it and the prodigals come and sit and they're happy but their heart's far from god why because if i'm going to come back i want to wear what he provides me to wear and again it speaks to your attitude and who you think what you think about yourself what you want others to think about you some might say well if my face looks so plain i would like to go to church but i can't appear in public without makeup if i let my hair grow what would people think you realize what a little thing that is over here is heaven and here is hell but i got a pretty face but see people don't think clearly that's why the prodigal son had to come to himself he had to wake up one day and recognize he's not thinking clearly over here just a night of pleasure over here is is his drunkenness and all these things and over here is life even you look at the life here that we live over here is peace and joy and love i could have that i could have my marriage right but i'll just go over here and gripe about it why you make excuses what somebody else is false the church's fault what would people think of me if i look like they did but the bible says many people when you speak of church they have a funny idea the world when they passed by the church he said the body of christ gathered together that's what he's calling the church he said they think of our women with some great long stringy hair with black dresses and everything they think of the men with long fingers dressed in black clothes and for some reason i see an undertaker in that where'd joe go he left me didn't he there he is long fingers dressed in black clothes always condemning them that's not joe he said to a good sense of the word that's true he said because the church is the peculiar people called out people i don't mean to have long fingers and dressed in black clothes but the fact that it's always condemning them that's true he said the reason it looks that way to that man who wants to judge the church in that condition now listen let me back up sometimes i read these too fast there's more food here sometimes you eat it too fast you don't get it he said the reason it looks that way to the man who wants to judge the church you realize that when people tell you use the excuse well i i feel judged if i go to church that they're judging the church by saying that they're judging that the church is that way all right talk about prejudging right so you say i don't want to go to church and people will judge me well what was that that's a judgment right then you just be honest with yourself and realize that's a judgment that i'm making a judgment that the church is going to treat me bad you don't know because you haven't been and the truth is the church don't treat you bad but the word is preached and sometimes you feel bad he said he's always he said the man who wants to judge the church in that condition is because the church is always pointing a condemning finger to everything he thinks is good and if he's a sinner he thinks sin is good the pleasures of life such as living in the world when the church stands up and condemns that thing it looks like a hideous animal to him but if he only knows he said it's god's only way of bringing salvation listen it's god's only way of bringing to salvation that's right expressing the word of god by the lips of his servants you're looking to say well it's so awful the church is so condemning that's not what the gospel is the gospel come to free us from condemnation look at isaiah 61 and 1 he said the spirit of the lord god is upon me because the lord hath anointed me not to condem but to preach good tidings unto the meek he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted they they see it as condemnation because of the way that they're living but he didn't send us for that he sent us to bind up the brokenhearted to preach good tidings unto the meat to proclaim liberty to the captives aren't you glad aren't you glad that he he said house of hell let loose in the name of jesus amen to proclaim liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are bound to proclaim the acceptable year of the lord the day of vengeance of our god to comfort all that mourn to appoint unto them that mourn in zion to give unto them beauty for ashes the oil of joy for mourning this doesn't sound like a bunch of people with long fingers and black clothes stringy hair what is the preaching of the gospel it's how you look at it giving beauty for ashes amen the gospel didn't give me a sad face and a long long hair and a long face to go with it but what did it give me it gave me joy the oil of joy for mourning the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness yes this gospel gave me clothes but it wasn't these clothes it was a garment of praise and i had a spirit of heaviness that's all i had to trade what a trade what a bargain but they might be called trees of righteousness the planting of the lord that he might be glorified the word heaviness in the scripture is often translated anxiety i i gave him my garment of anxiety my worry my fear about tomorrow he gave me a garment of praise can't get a better deal than that how much better the christian looks with salvation on you can see it but people are blind they just can't see it but i i beg you today if you could just see how much better you look with salvation on so much better than the filthy rags of man's morality that isaiah talks about in isaiah 64 6 but we are all it's an unclean thing and all of our righteousnesses are as filthy rags we all do pain as a leaf and our iniquities like the wind have taken us away you look so much better in white robes of grace you look so much better with peace on your face and joy love psalms 33 3 and 1 says rejoice in the lord are you righteous for praises comely for the upright it looks good on you psalms 147 one praise you the lord for it is good to sing praises unto our god it is pleasant and praises comely you know when you begin to worship god when you just really begin to let go and begin to worship god for what he's done you know what happens you begin to look better and i don't know about you but i need all of that i can get you may think i look stupid but god thinks i look good are you with me now the prodigal didn't see that he actually thought the clothes made him look bad he also had an excuse i just don't fit in and you know if he had access to the ring that the father gave him when he came back it probably didn't fit him as a child do you ever think about that he had to mature into it and the problem with so many people that are born in the message is that we feel like when we're young and trust me i know what i'm talking about because i was there and you grow up in the message and you see all the bad side of it so many times and you didn't come out of nothing you were born there right so you you're sitting there and you're thinking well what's in this for me and you begin to think that you begin to think that here's a ring here's a here's a that's my wedding band here's a supernatural you know election that i'm supposed to have and it don't fit i'm supposed to be elected and i want to go out and party here's your flesh right none of you all that were raised in the message you didn't think that way but i did i i want to be like one of the guys i want to be like that and that just don't seem to fit but one day i woke up i realized hey you know what i did i began reading the church h book i didn't have access to a lot of good preaching i went and heard the church age book and i began to read the church book and as i began to read it it fit me something about the way that he said something about what he said it was just something it wasn't it wasn't i didn't fall in love with a man but the word began to begin to grow in my life and i began to see that's me mama that's me that ring fits but see the problem is we try to make it fit when they're younger you're elected you're elected and the truth is it's not the flesh it's the seed and the seed's never blossomed yet and so it seems like it don't fit and so maybe as a child you thought well i didn't fit in around the church and maybe people are thinking that today i grew up in church but i don't just don't fit in every time i go i feel condemned don't you realize you got to grow into it and some of us are still growing into election i believe all of us are we're still growing into it the ring you feel like you don't fit in of course you don't because we're with an innumerable company of angels we're sitting in heavenly places we're talking about things here we are in life but stewart we're walking around you driving tractors or trying to hire people and fire them and and get mad at people and driving too fast and whatever else it is that you do and i painted brother stewart's life pretty good there didn't i huh that's life you know election don't seem to fit that huh let's pick on myself you eat too much every morning you wake up today i'm going to exercise today i'm going to get get it right today i'm going to do what's right and then you don't today i'm not going to worry and then you worry don't seem to fit does it you don't have to fit this amen that ring wasn't made for your flesh amen it was made for that something on the inside that's eternal you see the prodigal thought he didn't fit in in church but he had forgotten who he was he had forgotten what he was to grow to be one thing remained the same even though everything else changed he was always a son are you with me this morning he was always a son he was never not a son no matter how much it seemed like the ring didn't fit no matter how much he despised the clothes no matter how much he looked down and said oh none of these things are me he was still a son but the branhams tells us this he said backsliding is not lost he said i want somebody to tell me where backsliding is lost and prove it to the bible the backslider is not lost he's just out of fellowship you can't be lost how can it be lost he's a part of god he's a son he's a they're a daughter amen see he interpreted his not fitting in as meaning he didn't belong he just needed to change where it would fit maybe he went tried at all maybe his dad had the old ring waiting on a chance to give it to his son had it sitting up there on the shelf little boy who goes and tries it on say well that's never going to fit me but just wait a while just wait a while there are times when it seems like election doesn't fit but we're still sons our lives even may be contrary to the thought of us being his bride but it doesn't change who we are listen brother branham tells us you are wearing amen i love this you are wearing the wedding band the predestinated unmerited grace a wedding band of grace unmerited of your own god did it himself he knew you before the foundation of the world so he slipped the wedding band on you there that fits you amen it may not seem like it fits but it fits the real you it'll never fit the flesh you've got to bring this flesh under subjection to it he knew you before the foundation of the world so he slipped the wedding band on you there put your name on the book but isn't it strange he didn't realize this in his happy home he didn't know who he was but he had to go through this pig pen this time being in a far country to recognize who he was and we're talking this morning about david by how we travel through different things in life and go different places and you think why did i ever do that but he had to go through the pig pen joseph had to go to prison before he could go to the throne brother brown said you know when you get the holy ghost you attend a lot of obstacles many are the afflictions of the righteous but god delivereth him out of them all god brings you right up facing with it so he can show you his power and his goodness he said like i heard the story of the shepherd in jerusalem and broke his sheep's leg they said why you cruel shepherd why didn't you break the sheep's leg said well she didn't act like she loved me you get it this morning here's the love of god pressing down at every crevice trying to get to this young man and he acted like he didn't love god so god had to let him leave in this case he said he broke the sheep's leg she didn't act like she loved me so i thought i'd just break her leg so i'd have to give her some special attention then she'd love me from then on sometimes god has to lay you on your back with a sickness that the doctor says you're gonna die god could give you so he could give you a little special treatment so you'll love him a little more it's difficult to resist the purpose of god in your life acts 9 5 says this is paul on the road to damascus he's a new art thou lord the lord said i am jesus whom now persecutest it's hard for you to kick against the pricks you always were a son you just had to come to yourself luke 15 to 17 i'm closing in just a moment when he came to himself he said how many hired servants of my father's bread enough in despair and i perish with hunger i will arise and go to my father say unto him father i have sinned against heaven and before thee and i'm no more worthy to be called thy son make me as one of thy hired servants he realized how much better this was than this was it was so much better when i had a happy home it was so much better all of his excuses when he come to himself all of his excuses began to melt away and he said i realized this means something if i could just be a servant in that house i'd be better off i will arise and go to my father and will say to him father i have sinned against heaven and before thee and him no more worthy to be called thy son make me as one of the hired servants he realized his life could not be sustained where he was listen that's where every person has to get to that's the place where every one of us have to get to we got to realize that we cannot sustain our spiritual life in the condition that we're in there's got to be something that will keep that life alive in us he realized we can't live like this anymore there was a place he belonged prodigal why not why not he rose verse 20 came to his father when he was yet a great way off a great way off amen he may not have made it all the way back by himself he was a great way off but his father saw him and had compassion and ran amen aren't you glad he ran to you he ran and fell on his neck and kissed him and the son said to him father i've sinned against heaven and thy sight and them no more worthy to be called thy son but the father said to his servants bring forth the best robe put it on him amen put a ring on his hand that ring that didn't used to fit put it on him let him know he's elected let him know he can those those clothes fit him put shoes on his feet bring him to the fatted calf kill it that whole food that he didn't used to like bring it let's bring it in he likes it now he's come home let us eat and be merry for this my son was dead and is alive again he was lost in his found and they began to be merry you see this morning all of heaven is waiting to rejoice with you if you become prodigal in some way in your life all of heaven is waiting to rejoice your excuses will seem like nothing in the light of his compassion come home if you begin he will meet you your father will not leave you afar off we refuse to surrender when we think the journey is too long it's just too far to go back but come home if you start coming he'll come and meet you musicians go ahead and come sometime in the 1700s joseph harp was born in a christian home but he soon left to just begin living like a libertine in his own according to his own morals his own moral code he despised christianity he wrote a pamphlet addressed to john wesley who was the messenger of that day in the preeminent preacher in england at that time he titled it the unreasonableness of religion the unreasonableness of religion but he got to be around 50 years old and he began to realize maybe that religion wasn't so unreasonable he began to seek for god one day under george whitfield's preaching he finally got converted he found true salvation later in life he published a hymn book which including included his version of a song an old english folk song and i'll just read a couple verses from it it was his testimony he says i will arise and go to jesus he took it from the prodigal son will arise see there's got to be something in your heart when you wake up and you say i'll go i will arise and go to jesus he will embrace me
