[50:34] for us to have church over here on the
[50:36] highway I know it's difficult for you

[50:41] sure appreciate you being here and
[50:43] brother Jason allowing you to come
[50:45] Revelation 18 and verse one and then uh

[50:57] for the Youth but it'll be focused on
[50:59] them I want to speak to our older Youth
[51:01] and uh talk about finding the right ones
[51:04] so I'm sure you'll all want to be hear
[51:06] that and and so uh I know our older
[51:09] youth need to hear that maybe our
[51:10] younger youth as well as we've got
[51:12] several of them coming up and the
[51:15] earlier you teach them the better the
[51:17] easier it is later on to say Hey you
[51:20] know you know what the truth is so we
[51:22] want to teach them these things uh
[51:25] Revelation 18:1 after these things I saw
[51:29] another Angel come down from heaven
[51:31] having great power the Earth was
[51:34] lightened with his glory and he cried
[51:36] mightily with a strong voice saying
[51:38] Babylon the great is Fallen has fallen
[51:42] and has become the habitation of
[51:44] devils the hold of every foul spirit and
[51:48] a CA a cage of every unclean and hateful
[51:52] bird for all nations have drunk of the
[51:54] wine of the wrath of her fornication and
[51:56] the kings of the Earth have committed
[51:59] fornication with her and the merchants
[52:01] of the earth waxed Rich through the
[52:03] abundance of her
[52:04] Delicacies and I heard another voice
[52:07] from Heaven saying come out of her my
[52:10] people that you be not partakers of her
[52:13] sins and that you receive not of her
[52:16] plagues I pray the Lord would add his
[52:18] Blessing to the word you may be seated I
[52:20] appreciate brother Joel and brother
[52:22] Stuart holding the line for us last week
[52:24] and we're glad we got to give these
[52:26] young men opportunities and they really
[52:28] do a good job and even when it snows
[52:31] snow days are difficult because you got
[52:32] to decide whether to have church or not
[52:33] and the deacons uh do that and and uh
[52:37] with the input of the pastors we're so
[52:39] glad that we're have men that are able
[52:41] to do that and we were able to have
[52:42] church last week and this week and
[52:45] thankful for that I don't want youall to
[52:46] take any risk I uh would weigh heavily
[52:49] on me if somebody got hurt or something
[52:51] like that so y'all just be prudent in
[52:53] those things and so we understand if you
[52:55] can't get out or something like that
[52:57] it's good to be back with you I uh you
[52:59] know we were gone we're we're refreshed
[53:01] we're ready to uh start the year and and
[53:04] get rolling and uh just believe the
[53:06] Lord's going to be uh it's going to be a
[53:08] blessing to us this year and we can be a
[53:10] blessing as well to
[53:12] others on July 3rd
[53:17] 1964 while sitting at a shopping center
[53:20] in
[53:21] Jeffersonville brother Brandon was
[53:22] grieved in his heart at the immorality
[53:25] on display
[53:27] in his
[53:28] hometown he looked at the women and the
[53:30] way that they were and I think a lot of
[53:32] us would probably like to be transported
[53:36] back to
[53:39] 1964 and and see the way people dressed
[53:41] and things because it was a whole lot
[53:43] more decent than it is today a whole lot
[53:47] better than it is today but yet to
[53:50] brother Brandon being a prophet he saw
[53:52] what it was leading to and what it had
[53:55] become and he had lived over time uh a
[53:58] time when women were much more decent
[54:00] when men were much more decent he lived
[54:03] through that and he saw how it was going
[54:06] down he saw the spiritual implication of
[54:09] that he saw the way the church was it
[54:11] wasn't just the world but it was the
[54:14] church and he said while he was there he
[54:16] said I fell into a trance he said and
[54:19] when I did there was somebody with me I
[54:22] didn't see the person it was just a
[54:24] voice he said I looked and as I looked
[54:27] this way he said the bride will come in
[54:30] view for preview so he's standing there
[54:34] there's someone there with him he can't
[54:35] see him but there's another voice with
[54:37] him and it's like a review stand so it'd
[54:39] be like if the stand was here the people
[54:42] were coming from this way and passing by
[54:45] so he sees a group coming towards him he
[54:49] said I looked coming to me and I seen
[54:52] the most prettiest bunch of clean
[54:54] dressed women I ever seen in my life he
[54:58] said but each one of them look like was
[55:00] dressed different they all had long hair
[55:03] they were longer sleeves and skirts and
[55:05] so forth young women he said they look
[55:08] like kind of I'd say maybe 20 he said
[55:10] but when this bride she was looking the
[55:12] one was the one was talking to me and I
[55:15] were standing together her eyes he said
[55:18] she was the cleanest sweetest looking
[55:20] people I ever seen in my life look like
[55:22] it could have been a dozen or more
[55:24] breast it wasn't just a dozen of them
[55:26] but a dozen wide he said there was just
[55:28] in a group of them and she passed by
[55:31] sweetly with a with a air and her eyes
[55:35] up watching as she passed by he said oh
[55:40] she was beautiful now what I want to do
[55:42] today I want to contrast the bride and
[55:45] the church specifically the American
[55:48] church and I want to take a look at that
[55:50] just kind of look very deeply at this
[55:52] vision and see if we can't see the
[55:54] difference in what makes the difference
[55:56] between the two he said as she passed by
[56:00] he said now we shall review he said
[56:02] that's the bride he said now we will
[56:04] review the churches he said and they
[56:07] come I noticed them coming up and when
[56:11] they come up each one look like got
[56:14] worse so he begins to see the churches
[56:18] he said I never seen such a filthy bunch
[56:21] in my life remember there was one group
[56:24] of bride yeah and then there were many
[56:27] groups of
[56:28] churches and he said next I heard a
[56:31] noise when he said next I heard a noise
[56:34] and it said next he said Here Comes the
[56:37] American group I want you to notice that
[56:40] the church or the the nominal church was
[56:44] separated by national
[56:47] identity right each one of them was
[56:49] separated by this is the American this
[56:52] is the German this is the African church
[56:56] but the bride was not separated all
[56:59] right by national identity even though
[57:02] they wore their own clothing yes right
[57:05] they wore the clothing but he talked
[57:06] like there would be a German next to a
[57:08] Swedish next to an American and they
[57:11] were all walking together I think we we
[57:14] could stop there for a while and preach
[57:16] but I think we need to recognize that
[57:18] the bride they weren't trying to trip
[57:20] one another they weren't trying to outdo
[57:22] one another or try to walk differently
[57:25] from one another but they walking in
[57:26] Step together because they were the
[57:29] bride and I think it identifies the
[57:31] bride when we begin to see people walk
[57:34] together we need to be careful that we
[57:35] don't get to looking so difficult at the
[57:39] difficulty in each other's lives look at
[57:40] the problems look at the situation we
[57:42] get to look into those things You Better
[57:44] Watch What Happens eventually you begin
[57:46] to realize that oh I wish I had that
[57:49] again but you destroyed Fellowship by
[57:51] picking up things and and tearing things
[57:54] apart we don't want to ever do that we
[57:56] we want to see Fellowship continue and
[57:59] if I've got to do more than my part to
[58:01] see Fellowship continue let me continue
[58:03] to do that let me forgive people let me
[58:05] love people let me take care of people
[58:07] do everything that I can because it's
[58:09] not about me it's about the lamb it's
[58:11] about the bridegroom and we are his
[58:13] bride we are his bride right so I don't
[58:17] want to pick people apart that are part
[58:19] of that bride are you with me he said
[58:22] well you don't know who is and who isn't
[58:24] I'll just go out on a limb and say this
[58:25] not every everybody in this church will
[58:27] be bride but I want everybody in this
[58:30] church to be bride and everybody here is
[58:33] under the preaching of the word youve
[58:35] got an
[58:37] opportunity come on church to be in that
[58:40] and I don't know who is and who isn't
[58:42] but there's the opportunity and I
[58:43] believe where the message of the hour is
[58:45] preached There's an
[58:46] opportunity where that voice is being
[58:49] heard there's an opportunity yeah are
[58:52] you with me now yeah that that we could
[58:54] be a part of that group and I don't want
[58:56] to do anything to tear that group apart
[58:59] yeah yeah we don't want to separate by
[59:01] national
[59:03] identity come on we don't want to
[59:06] separate by race right we don't want to
[59:09] separate by Church
[59:11] identity we don't want to separate by by
[59:14] well I listen to this preacher I listen
[59:16] to that one every one of us under a
[59:18] messenger yeah I may have a disagreement
[59:20] with another Pastor another preacher but
[59:22] I'm under a messenger and under my
[59:24] messenger I become you become the bride
[59:27] becomes the final voice to the final age
[59:29] when are we going to recognize that
[59:31] church and realize it's not about us and
[59:33] our little kingdoms that we're building
[59:35] but it's about Christ come on it's about
[59:37] the word it's about that let me do
[59:39] whatever good I can do for those in the
[59:43] bride huh so it's not just about us we
[59:46] can't be selfish with what we have all
[59:48] right right it's not about just about us
[59:51] we want to be a help to those who need
[59:53] help in our area Beyond area and
[59:57] Hospitality begins at home right we we
[1:00:00] want to be a help to everybody that we
[1:00:01] can but I'm not just saying that this
[1:00:03] morning I want us to really think about
[1:00:05] it and really understand that what we're
[1:00:08] doing why we do what we do why we press
[1:00:11] the way that we press and why we It
[1:00:13] won't always be perfect and people won't
[1:00:15] always respond in a good way there won't
[1:00:17] always be a reciprocal relationship
[1:00:20] where people respond the way we respond
[1:00:22] it doesn't matter we're doing what the
[1:00:23] bride does bride don't persecute right
[1:00:26] yeah come on now
[1:00:29] preach the said elect don't persecute
[1:00:31] elect right yeah are you with me now
[1:00:35] yeah I can take we can take it a little
[1:00:37] bit further see elect doesn't persecute
[1:00:39] anybody if you are a persecutor you find
[1:00:42] yourself on the wrong side of
[1:00:45] History if you're a person that loves to
[1:00:47] stir things up and persecute people and
[1:00:50] look down on them and criticize them you
[1:00:52] find yourself on the wrong side of
[1:00:54] History Jesus didn't do that we don't do
[1:00:57] that we got to preach the truth we got
[1:00:59] to tell the truth and many times that
[1:01:01] separates us from from the world and
[1:01:04] from even people that claim believe in
[1:01:05] the message we we want the truth
[1:01:07] preached across the pulpit but we do not
[1:01:09] want to treat people bad we are not here
[1:01:12] to to build ourselves up or to cut
[1:01:15] others down to put ourselves on a higher
[1:01:17] plane we're here to preach the gospel to
[1:01:19] help somebody and as long as I can do
[1:01:21] that here I'll do that right here but if
[1:01:23] I get an opportunity to do it on the
[1:01:24] street I'll do it on the street
[1:01:27] we want to help somebody yeah right I
[1:01:29] want to tell you maybe you don't
[1:01:31] understand everything about the message
[1:01:32] or you don't understand everything about
[1:01:34] what we believe but we want to help
[1:01:37] you we we want to make sure if you're
[1:01:40] bride we want to make sure you have an
[1:01:41] opportunity right to be in this bride
[1:01:44] group yes sir you're one of us and we
[1:01:47] don't know who is and who isn't because
[1:01:50] sometimes those who are bride look like
[1:01:52] they're not yeah those who are not bride
[1:01:55] look like they are are come on now but
[1:01:57] God makes the difference and the proof
[1:02:00] is in the pudding and in the end you
[1:02:01] find
[1:02:02] out who wasn't who was and he said don't
[1:02:05] separate the tears until the time of the
[1:02:09] end the church was separated I didn't
[1:02:12] mean to say all that but by National
[1:02:15] Group the bride was
[1:02:18] not but the BR said now I am an American
[1:02:21] but this made me sick he said I'm not
[1:02:24] eloquent enough in mixed audience to say
[1:02:26] what was taking place and you you'll
[1:02:29] have to read between the lines when the
[1:02:32] women were coming the leader of them was
[1:02:33] a
[1:02:35] witch and he said they had a a half inch
[1:02:38] strap on
[1:02:40] top I you talk about vulgar a a lacy
[1:02:44] like a skirt a lace paper on the
[1:02:49] bottom and nothing on the
[1:02:52] back you talk about vulgar basically the
[1:02:55] way when women dress in public now I
[1:02:57] don't mean you Godly sisters but just
[1:02:59] women in
[1:03:01] general you got to turn your head
[1:03:03] everywhere you
[1:03:04] go each one had hair cut up real short
[1:03:08] frizzy looking things all over like that
[1:03:09] real shortcut hair full of makeup he
[1:03:12] said absolutely nothing but look like
[1:03:14] street
[1:03:15] prostitutes and they were walking with
[1:03:17] this paper and the vulgarity he said now
[1:03:19] the paper was what they was holding in
[1:03:20] front of them when they passed the
[1:03:21] review stand he said in the back of them
[1:03:23] to see the way they were going on their
[1:03:24] foremost their back part how they were
[1:03:25] acting I said is that the
[1:03:28] church oh my cuz brother Brandon was
[1:03:31] thinking of you know himself as being an
[1:03:34] American having been one of the leaders
[1:03:37] of the
[1:03:38] church in America he was he was the Ley
[1:03:42] and church age messenger not just to us
[1:03:45] but to the
[1:03:47] church right he was the messenger
[1:03:49] whether they remember he said Elijah was
[1:03:51] Jezebel's Pastor whether she wanted him
[1:03:53] to be or
[1:03:54] not right so he he was the pastor to the
[1:03:57] age and he's walk watching this as they
[1:04:00] walk along as they go forward as they
[1:04:02] pass the review stand I want you to
[1:04:04] understand today we're passing review
[1:04:06] stand and a prophet's not the only one
[1:04:08] standing there come on yeah but the the
[1:04:11] the the lamb God himself was standing
[1:04:14] there the voice behind the
[1:04:17] voice when they passor review stand he
[1:04:20] said you see the way they were going on
[1:04:21] their foremost their back part how they
[1:04:22] were acting I said is that the church
[1:04:27] there she went they were singing this
[1:04:28] here twist and roll songs you know ever
[1:04:31] what you call going down singing that
[1:04:32] going by I said is that the church not
[1:04:35] all not all that's called Christian
[1:04:37] music is Christian
[1:04:39] music right and yet we we believe that
[1:04:42] uh we believe that the music that we and
[1:04:44] people say what kind of music do you
[1:04:45] play in your church God honoring music
[1:04:48] we want to keep it that way music that
[1:04:51] brings the presence of the Lord and we
[1:04:53] won't put artificial legalistic limits
[1:04:56] on what we play or what we sing yeah
[1:04:58] come on now right we'll sing what honors
[1:05:00] God what he's pleased with are you with
[1:05:04] me now right we don't sing twist and
[1:05:08] roll right rock and roll booly woly as
[1:05:12] brother B calls it or whatever that it
[1:05:14] is singing that and going by he said
[1:05:16] well excuse me this morning but brother
[1:05:19] Ben you got drums in the church you must
[1:05:20] sing Boogie wogie no we
[1:05:22] don't if we did David did come on now
[1:05:27] right and and you you you die
[1:05:31] overseas all
[1:05:34] right right it's the truth if you ever
[1:05:37] go to Africa you would
[1:05:40] die CU they have a beat they honor God
[1:05:43] with that and there's a difference in
[1:05:46] that in the beat of the world there is
[1:05:48] one right we don't listen to that we
[1:05:51] don't want our kids listen to it even if
[1:05:52] it's called Christian but we want it we
[1:05:54] want what's right yeah amen and and
[1:05:56] that's every one of us has individual
[1:05:57] responsibility to that yes but listen
[1:06:00] it's not the music and I've heard this
[1:06:02] preach that well it's the music that
[1:06:03] separates the bride from the church no
[1:06:05] it's not because you could have the
[1:06:07] wrong music can be bride and the right
[1:06:09] music can be the
[1:06:10] church right because you can be bride
[1:06:12] and be out of line
[1:06:14] yeah
[1:06:16] right are you with me now good now now
[1:06:20] again he he said I was standing there in
[1:06:22] my heart I was crying and this witch he
[1:06:24] said it's nothing in the world she is
[1:06:26] that World Council of churches leading
[1:06:29] them right straight down the road where
[1:06:31] she was
[1:06:32] going he said they went off to the left
[1:06:34] and disappeared in chaos still beating
[1:06:36] this music and making real funny sounds
[1:06:41] and shaking their bodies one side and
[1:06:43] then the other side and then like that
[1:06:45] carrying on like that walking and I just
[1:06:47] started to bow my head and he said wait
[1:06:51] the bride must come
[1:06:53] again I want you to understand that the
[1:06:56] church had
[1:06:57] degenerated into this condition before
[1:07:00] God before the review standing brother
[1:07:03] Bram time look where they're at today
[1:07:06] and before the message came I've been in
[1:07:09] some of the Holiness groups that were
[1:07:10] there they were dying out the very few
[1:07:13] Holiness groups that survived were dying
[1:07:16] out and and and and unable to survive so
[1:07:19] they were constantly giving in the world
[1:07:21] giving into the world why are we
[1:07:23] different yeah come on now come on
[1:07:26] Church there had to be an Omega bride
[1:07:29] right he said the first bride was the
[1:07:31] alpha bride the a bride there had to be
[1:07:33] a z bride an end time
[1:07:35] bride amen he said I looked as they come
[1:07:39] again and they passed by sweet looking
[1:07:41] little ladies it was all looking right
[1:07:44] at me as they passed by remember it was
[1:07:46] a type because it's not going to be all
[1:07:49] women in the Rapture right ha
[1:07:51] to right so he's seeing he sing a type
[1:07:56] we know that uh you know you could
[1:07:58] someone said that there uh won't be any
[1:08:01] women in the first 30 minutes of heaven
[1:08:04] cuz the Bible said there'll be silence
[1:08:06] in
[1:08:07] heaven it's all right you can
[1:08:10] laugh for 30 minutes that's not Doctrine
[1:08:13] that's not true but can't believe that
[1:08:16] person said
[1:08:17] that he said they was all looking right
[1:08:19] at me these sweet ladies what were they
[1:08:21] of the Bride yeah are you with me now
[1:08:25] trying make you laugh I can't make you
[1:08:26] laugh I can't make you smile maybe I can
[1:08:28] make you cry here in a little
[1:08:30] bit he said I noticed each one was
[1:08:33] dressed differently and one in the back
[1:08:35] had kind of long hair hanging down had
[1:08:37] it rolled around like this might have
[1:08:39] been German or something like that and I
[1:08:41] watched them they weren't all the same
[1:08:43] but they were all in the same group come
[1:08:45] on are you with me now there was
[1:08:47] different churches different pastors
[1:08:49] different leader different situation
[1:08:51] maybe they had church a little bit
[1:08:52] differently but they were all part of
[1:08:54] the Bride yeah this American Church
[1:08:56] separated by denomination by Race by
[1:08:58] Nation but the bride didn't do that
[1:09:01] right yeah and it's about time we come
[1:09:03] to a place where we didn't do that
[1:09:05] anymore come on but we followed the
[1:09:08] sound of the voice of the age yes he
[1:09:12] said I watched them as they started
[1:09:13] leaving two or three of them in the back
[1:09:15] kind of get out of Step I was going to
[1:09:18] holler at them and they was trying to
[1:09:19] get back and step again and I've seen
[1:09:21] them just the vision just fade out and
[1:09:25] change from
[1:09:28] me I think if we saw the
[1:09:31] church the way God sees it yeah of
[1:09:35] course we would all want to be
[1:09:37] identified with that brid group how many
[1:09:39] can say Amen to that today I want to be
[1:09:41] part of that bride Group whatever it
[1:09:42] takes I don't want to be identified with
[1:09:45] the church with the modern Church am
[1:09:48] with the Babylonian church with mystery
[1:09:51] Babylon and her daughters I don't want
[1:09:53] to be identified with that it's why we
[1:09:56] maintain our separation we love them we
[1:09:58] we care for everyone we we should show a
[1:10:01] love for everybody but we will not
[1:10:03] become that yeah we don't want to be
[1:10:06] part of that why because we've been
[1:10:08] called out of that into something
[1:10:11] different oh church and if we saw the
[1:10:15] church the way God sees it it would not
[1:10:16] be an attractive thing but he said it
[1:10:18] was a vulgar thing he said I don't want
[1:10:20] to be a part of that I don't want to be
[1:10:23] identified with that and even even CED
[1:10:25] he said tears stopping in his heart
[1:10:27] because he could see that that group was
[1:10:29] going down he said God wouldn't marry
[1:10:31] somebody like
[1:10:33] that but but we want to be identified
[1:10:35] with the bridegroom now what does it
[1:10:37] take to be in the bride and I know
[1:10:40] people could preach all kinds of things
[1:10:42] say well the bride dresses a certain way
[1:10:44] and the bride listens to certain music
[1:10:46] and the bride does certain things and
[1:10:49] but those are
[1:10:51] results of being bride
[1:10:55] but you could be a part of that other
[1:10:57] church that other
[1:10:59] group and and do all those
[1:11:03] things right it's it's a it's it's what
[1:11:06] the difference between correlation and
[1:11:08] causation it's it's it didn't cause it
[1:11:11] wasn't you
[1:11:12] know the way you dress is not what makes
[1:11:15] you what you are
[1:11:17] amen right
[1:11:19] right you take a a sister that comes in
[1:11:22] and we've had some that come in and and
[1:11:25] come in from the world maybe they've
[1:11:26] always cut their hair and they quit
[1:11:28] cutting their hair but for a while it
[1:11:31] still looks
[1:11:32] cut but they're no less saved than
[1:11:34] anybody
[1:11:36] else
[1:11:37] right somebody coming off the street and
[1:11:40] you think well but but they're part of
[1:11:41] the Bride yeah they come they got maybe
[1:11:45] they had a hard life and done things
[1:11:47] they shouldn't have done with their
[1:11:48] bodies but yet yet they're part of the
[1:11:50] Bride just as wash and clean as anybody
[1:11:53] else is all right
[1:11:56] so you can't always look at the outside
[1:11:58] brother BR taught us you got to look at
[1:11:59] the Spirit he said I've seen a lot of
[1:12:01] women with long hair and long dresses
[1:12:03] and a long face to go with it and and in
[1:12:05] a place where you know you could be
[1:12:07] critical and or or or hateful or
[1:12:11] something like that you could be just as
[1:12:13] bad as somebody out there and so we
[1:12:16] don't want to be any of that we want to
[1:12:17] be loving and we realize we live in
[1:12:19] human bodies many times we make mistakes
[1:12:21] and and we do things that are wrong but
[1:12:22] we're thankful for the blood of Jesus
[1:12:24] because that's what makes us the bride
[1:12:27] is we've been washed by the bleeding
[1:12:28] word we've been washed by the
[1:12:32] blood yes sir right but a person might
[1:12:34] look
[1:12:35] like the church and be the bride yeah
[1:12:39] they just haven't seen the light yet
[1:12:40] come
[1:12:42] on and they might be bride that's gotten
[1:12:44] out of
[1:12:46] Step need to be called back because if
[1:12:50] that didn't happen we wouldn't need
[1:12:51] preachers that's right we wouldn't even
[1:12:53] need to listen to the message say well
[1:12:54] the message came and now we're all in
[1:12:56] the bride we're all okay no you still
[1:12:57] need the message yeah hear me this
[1:12:59] morning church I'm going to get to
[1:13:01] something after a while but you still
[1:13:02] need to hear the voice of a prophet you
[1:13:04] still need to hear and when you need to
[1:13:06] hear preachers that repeat that that
[1:13:09] tell you what a prophet said but you
[1:13:10] don't need to get away from the voice
[1:13:12] because the voice made a
[1:13:15] difference right made a difference in
[1:13:18] what we believe and what we live and Who
[1:13:20] We Are Made A Difference In Our Lives
[1:13:22] I'll tell you young people it'll make a
[1:13:24] difference in your life if you'll if
[1:13:25] you'll follow the voice of
[1:13:28] god good yes good the voice of God is
[1:13:33] not a company yeah it's not a it's not
[1:13:36] an organization it's not a church the
[1:13:39] voice of God is God himself the word are
[1:13:43] you with me now and he spoke through a
[1:13:45] prophet in our day that had the power of
[1:13:47] infallibility it was a mortal human man
[1:13:49] yall heard about it last week he spoke
[1:13:51] through a prophet but today he's
[1:13:53] speaking in and through the bride who
[1:13:55] were under their
[1:13:57] messenger the The Voice made a
[1:14:01] difference
[1:14:05] yeah so glad that it did yes because it
[1:14:09] gives me hope for
[1:14:11] tomorrow yeah
[1:14:13] good
[1:14:15] see I want to be I want to be very clear
[1:14:17] about this yeah you might say well I
[1:14:20] thank God for my pastor my pastor made a
[1:14:23] difference I'm glad you are thankful for
[1:14:25] your
[1:14:26] pastor but the pastor can only make a
[1:14:28] difference in your life in this age he
[1:14:30] can only preach
[1:14:33] you in he can only wash you by the water
[1:14:36] of the word
[1:14:37] as he is under the
[1:14:40] messenger sir right and the messenger
[1:14:43] could only do that as he was under the
[1:14:46] lamb the
[1:14:47] bridegroom the other voice that was
[1:14:50] speaking yeah are you with me now so it
[1:14:54] doesn't go back to difference in my life
[1:14:56] yeah is not
[1:14:58] do and and I met some good men and I
[1:15:01] know some good men there's some good men
[1:15:03] in this church and some good women
[1:15:05] wonderful people my mother's been a
[1:15:06] great influence in my life people in in
[1:15:08] the church have been a great influence
[1:15:10] in my life some of y'all ad meit more to
[1:15:12] me than what you even know
[1:15:15] amen but knowing you is not what made a
[1:15:19] difference in my life right right are
[1:15:22] you with me now you you you lived right
[1:15:25] and you shown the light and you were a
[1:15:27] billboard for God but that's not
[1:15:29] ultimately what made the difference what
[1:15:30] made you what you are for the best is
[1:15:32] the message of the hour it's the voice
[1:15:36] that God spoke the thing that God had to
[1:15:39] say I made a difference give me hope for
[1:15:42] tomorrow let me know that it's not we're
[1:15:44] not all going to hell in a hand basket
[1:15:46] forgive the language we're not all doing
[1:15:47] that but we're we're going to heaven
[1:15:49] we're going somewhere there's a city
[1:15:51] prepared for us there's a place we're
[1:15:53] going to it's What made a difference in
[1:15:55] my life and I want to give a testimony
[1:15:58] today that the voice made it what about
[1:16:00] you Church made a difference in our
[1:16:02] lives sir that's why I refuse to draw
[1:16:05] denominational lines and church lines
[1:16:07] and everything else it's this message
[1:16:09] that made the difference and whatever I
[1:16:11] can do to promote this message I'll do
[1:16:12] it yes
[1:16:15] amen I set in fellowship with great men
[1:16:17] in this message but they are not what
[1:16:19] made the
[1:16:20] difference every one of the greatest of
[1:16:22] them would tell you I I told Brother I
[1:16:24] was s with brother Tim fr the other day
[1:16:26] great man of God but I was sitting there
[1:16:28] with him and I told him I said this
[1:16:29] message is my life he told me he said
[1:16:33] this message is my life too yeah and we
[1:16:36] may have disagreements about things but
[1:16:37] this message is our
[1:16:39] life huh whether we're big or little
[1:16:43] or right whether we're skinny or fat or
[1:16:49] Joel's laughing how me the size of the
[1:16:51] church man
[1:16:56] no matter what we are the message made a
[1:16:59] difference I I just feel relaxed this
[1:17:01] morning able to preach my voice is Le me
[1:17:03] because I haven't preached in a while
[1:17:04] but but you know I I think about that
[1:17:07] but Justin why do you come to church
[1:17:09] because of the message you don't just
[1:17:11] come because of me but you believe what
[1:17:13] a prophet said yeah so you drive three
[1:17:16] hours to come to
[1:17:18] church come on Church you don't do it
[1:17:20] you'd do it if I wasn't here yeah yeah
[1:17:24] are you with me now I want to help you
[1:17:25] do it I want to be part of it but we got
[1:17:27] to get past personality we got to get
[1:17:30] past who's preaching we got to get past
[1:17:32] those things say Lord I believe I heard
[1:17:34] a voice calling me out of Babylon
[1:17:36] calling me away from the nonsense of the
[1:17:38] world calling me away from
[1:17:39] denominationalism and that voice called
[1:17:42] me by the message of the
[1:17:45] hour yes
[1:17:49] sir what is the
[1:17:52] bride the idea of a gentile Church being
[1:17:54] the wife of the Bride of the wife of
[1:17:56] Christ first introduced by Paul in
[1:17:58] Ephesians 5 we'll get to more of that
[1:18:00] maybe later today but Ephesians 5:23 the
[1:18:03] husband is the head of the wife even as
[1:18:05] Christ is the head of the church and he
[1:18:07] is the savior of the body yeah so Paul
[1:18:11] introduces the idea of Christ having a
[1:18:14] bride and John expands on this idea in
[1:18:18] Revelation where he said let us be glad
[1:18:20] and
[1:18:21] rejoice and give honor to him for the
[1:18:24] marriage of the Lamb has come and his
[1:18:28] wife has made herself ready the wife the
[1:18:32] bride the one who belongs to him and
[1:18:34] with him yes Revelation 21
[1:18:38] And1 he said I saw a new Heaven in A New
[1:18:41] Earth the first Heaven and the first
[1:18:43] Earth were passed away and there was no
[1:18:46] more
[1:18:47] sea been thinking about heaven lately
[1:18:49] I'm not that old
[1:18:53] but we we
[1:18:55] on vacation we went we walked up a
[1:18:57] lighthouse we went to Florida but not to
[1:18:59] the warm part the cheap
[1:19:03] part but we went up this
[1:19:06] Lighthouse and it said 177 steps does
[1:19:09] that sound like a lot to you all
[1:19:11] I sister Curtis is nodding yes 177 steps
[1:19:17] when it's straight up it's a
[1:19:19] lot and I found myself almost unable the
[1:19:23] only thing that kept me going up them
[1:19:25] steps was my
[1:19:27] pride that was
[1:19:29] it everything else I was out of breath
[1:19:32] my heart was beating out of my chest and
[1:19:34] let me tell you it was harder to come
[1:19:35] down than it was to go up because it was
[1:19:38] so it was so steep that I was going down
[1:19:41] like this whenever I walk down my back
[1:19:43] would
[1:19:44] hurt and I I I was down for a day or
[1:19:48] two I'm just telling you the
[1:19:51] truth and so I get down and I had to go
[1:19:53] to the the SUV and I felt like I was
[1:19:55] having a heart
[1:19:58] attack and I wasn't but I felt like
[1:20:01] that my heart's beating out of my chest
[1:20:03] my face is red my blood pressure's up
[1:20:05] and I sit down in the car and we start
[1:20:08] to leave and the kids are like kind of
[1:20:10] chuckling at me you know I said kids you
[1:20:12] wouldn't think this was funny if I
[1:20:17] died Church wouldn't think it was funny
[1:20:19] if I died and Joel was in charge
[1:20:22] and and I left and
[1:20:27] but you know I'm sitting there and and
[1:20:31] uh and I told my kiss said this it's not
[1:20:33] funny you know I you know you want
[1:20:35] people to to feel bad for you and of
[1:20:39] course they weren't huffing and puffing
[1:20:40] but
[1:20:41] they're underweight
[1:20:45] so anyway they they we we were driving
[1:20:48] along and my kids start preaching at me
[1:20:50] they said brother Ben brother Ben my my
[1:20:54] daughter called me Pastor
[1:20:56] Ben Pastor Ben she says she says I you
[1:21:00] know if we die we're going to
[1:21:04] heaven and and Peter's like yeah we're
[1:21:06] going to heaven we're you know you're
[1:21:08] going to you're going to make it said
[1:21:10] what are you worried
[1:21:12] about I shouldn't have told him about
[1:21:14] that life
[1:21:15] [Applause]
[1:21:17] insurance that's what they did they're
[1:21:19] like wait you know you really have to
[1:21:22] you really have to uh and they were
[1:21:24] talking me up out I said you know what
[1:21:25] you're right you're right I can't deny
[1:21:29] that and I've been thinking even before
[1:21:31] that about heaven and think about we're
[1:21:33] going somewhere that's real going
[1:21:35] somewhere beyond this land Beyond this
[1:21:37] place beyond this Veil somewhere where

[1:23:57] Jerusalem coming down from God out of
[1:23:59] Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for
[1:24:02] her

[1:24:06] Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of
[1:24:09] God is with men and he will dwell with
[1:24:11] them and they shall be his people and
[1:24:13] God himself shall be with them and be

[1:24:47] Alpha and Omega the beginning and the
[1:24:49] end I will give unto him that is a
[1:24:51] thirst of the Fountain of the Water of

[1:24:54] he that overcometh shall inherit all
[1:24:56] things I will be his God and he shall be
[1:24:59] my son but the fearful and unbelieving

[1:25:03] hor mongers and Sorcerers and idolators
[1:25:05] and all liars shall have their part in a
[1:25:07] lake which burneth with fire and
[1:25:08] brimstone which is the second death and
[1:25:10] there cometh to be one of the Seven
[1:25:12] Angels which had the seven vials full of
[1:25:14] the seven last plags talked with me
[1:25:16] saying come hither I will show Thee the
[1:25:18] bride the Lamb's wife what did he show
[1:25:21] them he showed them that City he showed
[1:25:23] him that City listen the bride are all
[1:25:26] of those who were chosen by God before
[1:25:28] the foundation of the earth to live in
[1:25:31] that City yes sir
[1:25:33] right can't nobody take you out of that
[1:25:35] group
[1:25:37] on because
[1:25:39] the to cut you out of the Bride out of
[1:25:42] the Bride would be to cut you out of the
[1:25:44] mind of God that's right amen and nobody
[1:25:47] can do
[1:25:50] that you don't church we can't affect
[1:25:54] God's thinking cuz he knows all things
[1:25:57] he always knew all
[1:26:01] things good he showed him our future
[1:26:05] home brother brandom speaks of that he
[1:26:07] said oh what will it look like did you
[1:26:10] ever think now bride what will it look
[1:26:12] like let's think about that for a minute
[1:26:14] he said it's prepared and designed by
[1:26:17] the Divine
[1:26:19] architect the the Divine
[1:26:22] architect you know that was that famous
[1:26:24] architect his his name is slipping my
[1:26:26] mind right now but he was the one who
[1:26:28] built waterfall the different houses
[1:26:29] that had the that were integrated into
[1:26:31] nature somebody knows his name but I
[1:26:33] can't think of it but it's the it's the
[1:26:36] uh the guy who who built his homes were
[1:26:39] so beautiful but and they're relics
[1:26:41] today they're built I think in the 60s
[1:26:43] and 70s but that Frank Lloyd
[1:26:46] Wright and they built his homes and they
[1:26:48] were so beautiful and the architect he
[1:26:50] was so celebrated as an architect but
[1:26:51] you know they got
[1:26:53] problems there's mold in them houses
[1:26:56] yeah because he integrated them with
[1:26:58] nature right and nature means Nature's
[1:27:01] problems and so rain gets in them water
[1:27:03] gets in them there's mold in them so the
[1:27:05] most beautiful houses in the world are
[1:27:07] also some of the least functional oh
[1:27:10] yeah but this city yeah was
[1:27:13] not Hallelujah was not designed by an
[1:27:18] architect with human
[1:27:19] failings because even the greatest
[1:27:21] architect in the world has human failing
[1:27:25] right if you've ever built a house you
[1:27:26] know when you get to the end of it
[1:27:27] there'll be something you don't like
[1:27:29] about it even though you may have
[1:27:31] designed it but there's something about
[1:27:32] it that you don't like because there
[1:27:34] just something that you weren't able to
[1:27:36] do because of finances or maybe maybe
[1:27:38] you wanted this here and the the Builder
[1:27:40] made it a little different or didn't
[1:27:42] come out of the vision like you expected
[1:27:44] it to but imagine if you had all the
[1:27:46] money that there was and you had all the
[1:27:48] time that there was and you had all the
[1:27:51] uh the knowledge that there was what
[1:27:53] kind of a house for the Joe would you
[1:27:55] build for your wife what kind of a house
[1:27:57] would you build oh church for you to
[1:27:59] live in with your wife and for you to
[1:28:01] have a home what kind of a place would
[1:28:03] it be yeah if you had everything at your
[1:28:06] disposal
[1:28:08] yes come on church and the Divine
[1:28:12] architect had all things at his disposal
[1:28:15] yes and what did he do he prepared a
[1:28:17] place right he said I go to prepare a
[1:28:20] place he has designed it with tender
[1:28:23] hands for his beloved
[1:28:26] bride what's it going to look like he
[1:28:29] said could you imagine a man marrying a
[1:28:31] wife that's
[1:28:33] abble that Abel's there I'm still
[1:28:35] waiting to build my wife a
[1:28:37] house but could you imagine a man
[1:28:39] marrying a wife that's able how he
[1:28:41] builds and puts every little thing just
[1:28:44] exactly to her touch have you ever been
[1:28:46] I I'm just preaching freely this morning
[1:28:48] y'all just bear with me come off
[1:28:50] vacation relaxed
[1:28:54] but we were up at the Laura Engles
[1:28:56] Wilder house a few years ago up at
[1:28:58] Mansville Missouri if you go in her home
[1:29:01] she was really short and I guess he was
[1:29:03] short too and he was a custom builder
[1:29:06] and so they built everything like like
[1:29:07] it's for
[1:29:08] midgets so all the counters are low and
[1:29:11] the furniture is low it's all custom
[1:29:13] built he built it all for
[1:29:16] her like was built for children you're
[1:29:19] in a house but it's like a kid's
[1:29:21] house don't I know what you're
[1:29:26] thinking after after church tell Brother
[1:29:28] David what you were
[1:29:31] thinking and and so they she they built
[1:29:34] it all just for her and I thought about
[1:29:37] that I thought that's what he did for us
[1:29:39] yeah individually sir right because I
[1:29:42] may not like what you like but he built
[1:29:44] it Hallelujah for
[1:29:47] me just for me I don't know what Riley's
[1:29:51] will have in it you know Riley's house
[1:29:52] you know it might be a beautiful home
[1:29:54] with deer antlers and bare skin rugs and
[1:29:58] yours might be different from that there
[1:29:59] might be different kinds of houses you
[1:30:02] know one with a big kitchen one with no
[1:30:03] K I don't know but in that City he
[1:30:05] designed that entire city amen

[1:30:23] to find that spot you know that's
[1:30:24] special to us maybe in the woods maybe
[1:30:26] driving along the road and there's a
[1:30:28] certain spot that just beautiful you
[1:30:30] wish you could live there you wish that
[1:30:32] things could you know you could just
[1:30:33] capture that moment in time but he has
[1:30:36] done that for you and he put a spot
[1:30:38] right there for
[1:30:39] you now Oh my he said exactly to her
[1:30:44] touch just what she would like how the
[1:30:48] Divine architect has designed the new
[1:30:50] city where he will live with his bride
[1:30:53] just to her touch no wonder the Apostle
[1:30:56] said eyes is not seen Ear Has Not Heard
[1:30:58] neither has ever entered the heart of
[1:31:00] man the Divine architect has designed
[1:31:03] this for his beloved don't let nobody

[1:31:29] yeah for you
[1:31:31] right said oh what a place it must be
[1:31:36] when divine nature a Divine architect
[1:31:39] has designed it for a Divine
[1:31:43] attribute if you're the bride there's
[1:31:45] something in you that was in God's mind
[1:31:47] before the foundation of the earth
[1:31:49] that's what a Prophet come to tell us

[1:31:53] world how awful things were he come to

[1:34:06] churches all those who claim to be the
[1:34:08] wife of Christ but like Israel claim to
[1:34:10] be his wife yet continually flirted with
[1:34:12] idolatry the church does what she
[1:34:15] wants not what he
[1:34:18] commands Bible tells Isaiah 4:1 in that
[1:34:20] day seven women shall take hold of one
[1:34:22] man saying we will eat on a bread and
[1:34:24] wear on apparel only let us be called by
[1:34:26] thy name to take away our reproach yeah
[1:34:29] the brandom sees that as a prophecy of
[1:34:31] the immorality of our day the same thing
[1:34:34] he was grieved by when he saw the vision
[1:34:36] and how he saw it as a type of the
[1:34:38] church it's a lean Church in Revelation
[1:34:41] 3:14 the angel of the Church of the
[1:34:43] leans right these things sayth the amen

[1:35:18] right we were all a part of that ly age
[1:35:21] brother the Paul but a voice come by our
[1:35:23] way a voice amen hallelujah reach the
[1:35:27] jungles of Africa reach out to brother
[1:35:29] Paul in his testimony how a voice

[1:35:35] what you believe today cuz something
[1:35:37] called you
[1:35:38] out an angel come and lighten the Earth
[1:35:40] and then you heard a voice from Heaven
[1:35:42] come out of her my people sir
[1:35:49] good brother brandom sees that church
[1:35:52] especially the American group
[1:35:54] he feels sick
[1:35:56] inside he said I stood there in his
[1:35:58] presence I thought oh God is a minister
[1:36:01] that's the best we could do oh he said
[1:36:03] you know how how you feel I thought God
[1:36:06] hide me if I could just get away from
[1:36:08] here if all that we've done that's what
[1:36:10] we have to produce if that's what he
[1:36:13] said then when them women pass by all
[1:36:14] doing all kinds of rocks and things and
[1:36:16] short hair painted faces as they pass by
[1:36:19] like that supposed to be virgins to
[1:36:21] Christ when she passed by like that I
[1:36:23] turned my head you know with this
[1:36:24] holding in front of me it was
[1:36:26] disgraceful the back of them and there
[1:36:28] they was going like that and I turned my
[1:36:30] head to weeping like that I said I
[1:36:33] couldn't stand it in there him standing
[1:36:36] there and me
[1:36:37] no oh my a minister of the church and
[1:36:40] that's what I had produced for him his
[1:36:43] boss was standing looking over his
[1:36:45] shoulder he said here's the
[1:36:50] church I said oh God I can't look at it
[1:36:54] let me die let me fade away as soon as
[1:36:56] it went out every time one of them would
[1:36:58] come they go out to a certain place and
[1:36:59] then drop off just hear the sound of it
[1:37:02] as it went
[1:37:04] away where he was sitting on the review
[1:37:07] stand as they were passing by he said in
[1:37:09] one place he said they went up a little
[1:37:10] null little Hill and then dropped off
[1:37:12] the other side they thought they were
[1:37:15] going up
[1:37:18] yeah but a prophet could see they were
[1:37:20] going down right
[1:37:24] but this is not the end of the story I'm
[1:37:26] so glad it's not there had to be an
[1:37:29] Omega bride he said then I heard
[1:37:31] something like hward Christian Soldiers
[1:37:33] I looked and here come that sainted
[1:37:34] bunch of little girls just exactly the
[1:37:36] way they was all correctly dressed their
[1:37:38] hair hanging way down on their back
[1:37:39] smooth clean marching like this to the
[1:37:41] step of the Gospel she was the word they
[1:37:45] looked like one out of every nation I
[1:37:47] was looking at as they passed by and
[1:37:48] seen them pass by instead of going down
[1:37:51] they started going up and noticed one of
[1:37:54] them trying he said two or three of them
[1:37:56] trying getting out of line he said in
[1:37:59] several places he said they were trying
[1:38:00] to get back in line but they were
[1:38:03] watching that other group yes be careful
[1:38:06] getting your eyes on
[1:38:07] politics be careful getting your eyes on
[1:38:09] what's going on in the world on your
[1:38:11] neighbors on even neighboring churches
[1:38:13] keep your eyes on the word keep your
[1:38:16] eyes on the message right he said I
[1:38:19] noticed two or three of them trying to
[1:38:20] get out of line I screamed stay inine
[1:38:23] line the vision left me I was standing
[1:38:26] in the room screaming stay in line
[1:38:30] listen if you go back to Isaiah chapter
[1:38:31] 4 Isaiah 4:1 is the one we read a lot of
[1:38:34] times where he talks about how that
[1:38:36] seven women would take a hold of one
[1:38:39] man but in Isaiah 4:2 it says in that
[1:38:42] day shall the branch of the Lord be
[1:38:44] beautiful and glorious when in the same
[1:38:47] day the seven women take hold of one man
[1:38:50] and say I want your name but I don't
[1:38:52] want you to affect my life
[1:38:54] in that same day there will be a branch
[1:38:56] of the Lord that'll be beautiful and
[1:38:57] glorious and the fruit of the Earth
[1:38:59] shall be excellent and comely for them
[1:39:00] that are escaped of Israel it shall come
[1:39:03] to pass that he that is left in Zion and
[1:39:05] he that remaineth in Jerusalem Shall be

[1:39:18] and shall have Purge the blood of
[1:39:19] Jerusalem from the midst by the spirit
[1:39:21] of judgment by the spirit of burning
[1:39:22] said of the B how are you tying that
[1:39:24] together a prophet did go listen to
[1:39:26] Future home he takes that scripture and
[1:39:28] says that's the

[1:39:38] bride
[1:39:40] yeah the bride's relationship with him

[1:40:26] darkness and Tempest and the sound of a
[1:40:27] trumpet and the voice of Words which
[1:40:29] voice they heard they that heard and
[1:40:30] treated the word should not be spoken to
[1:40:32] them anymore oh but we love the voice
[1:40:34] that we heard why it was the voice of
[1:40:37] Grace oh Church listen they they could
[1:40:40] not endure that which was commanded if
[1:40:42] so much as a beast touched the mountain
[1:40:43] they should be stoned or thrust through
[1:40:44] of the dart and so terrible was the
[1:40:46] sight that Moses said I exceedingly fear
[1:40:48] and Quake but you are coming to Mount
[1:40:50] Zion how many have come to Mount Zion
[1:40:51] today you come to mount un to the city

[1:41:11] just men made perfect to Jesus the
[1:41:14] mediator of the New Covenant to the
[1:41:15] blood of sprinkling that speaks better
[1:41:18] things than
[1:41:21] Abel oh my
[1:41:24] the bride is those who in the mind of
[1:41:27] God never did it in the first place yeah

[1:41:41] you the word died for you yeah right
[1:41:43] what was it is the word manifested in a
[1:41:45] body of Flesh that hung on
[1:41:47] Calvary the bride was Washed by the word
[1:41:51] and Ephesians 5:25 said husbands love
[1:41:53] your your wives even as Christ also
[1:41:56] loved the church and gave himself for it
[1:41:59] that he might sanctify and cleanse it
[1:42:01] with the washing of Water by the word
[1:42:04] that he might present it to himself a
[1:42:06] glorious church not having spot or
[1:42:08] wrinkle or any such thing but that it
[1:42:10] should it be holy without blemish how
[1:42:12] does he wash it by the word how do you
[1:42:15] know which group you belong in come on
[1:42:17] now think about it for a minute how do
[1:42:19] you know yeah CU you might have lived
[1:42:22] over here with that American church
[1:42:24] group and live like they
[1:42:26] do it's real quiet but I think you're
[1:42:29] listening you might have live like that
[1:42:31] for a long
[1:42:32] time but you got something in your heart
[1:42:35] it's calling you to a different life
[1:42:37] come on yes how do you know that you
[1:42:39] belong over here yeah where the table
[1:42:42] spread yeah the Feast of the Lord is how
[1:42:45] do you know you belong in that
[1:42:47] City listen what Jesus said in John 17:6
[1:42:51] he said I have manifested name un to the
[1:42:54] men which thou gavest me out of the
[1:42:56] world thine they were and thou gavest
[1:42:59] them me and they have kept Thy word amen
[1:43:04] listen to what Jesus tells Peter Peter
[1:43:06] may not have felt like he was part of
[1:43:08] the elect cuz he made so many mistakes
[1:43:11] on
[1:43:12] now you may not have felt like you're
[1:43:14] part of the elect but this is what Jesus
[1:43:16] tells him he says when you're converted
[1:43:18] not if you're converted
[1:43:21] amen hallelujah he said the devil would
[1:43:24] like to take you and sift you like wheat
[1:43:26] but when you're converted go strengthen
[1:43:28] your brethren oh that's the kind of
[1:43:30] faith we ought to have whatever God gave
[1:43:32] to him he will not lose them he said
[1:43:35] thou gavest them me they have kept Thy
[1:43:37] word he said now they have known that
[1:43:39] all things whatsoever thou has given me
[1:43:40] are of thee for I have given unto them
[1:43:43] The Words which thou gavest me and they
[1:43:45] have received them and have known surely
[1:43:47] that I come out from thee and they have
[1:43:49] believed that thou did send me this was
[1:43:51] the difference look at the Vision the
[1:43:54] American church and all the churches of
[1:43:56] the world were behaving according to the
[1:43:58] voice that come from Babylon the voice
[1:44:00] of attraction to Babylon the voice of
[1:44:02] Hollywood the voice of the of the world
[1:44:04] that we live in today that's how they
[1:44:06] were behaving listen church but the
[1:44:09] bride yeah Hallelujah they had their
[1:44:13] eyes on the messenger and the and the
[1:44:16] one who was standing behind
[1:44:20] him what did they hear they heard a
[1:44:23] different voice the American Church
[1:44:25] their dress their attitude their music
[1:44:27] all of it result of being led by the
[1:44:29] World Council of churches led by men and
[1:44:31] man's ideas the bride had no visible
[1:44:34] leader did you notice
[1:44:37] that what but the leader was standing
[1:44:39] here
[1:44:40] by
[1:44:42] hallelujah amen so there was a prophet
[1:44:45] who was a leader but he was removed from
[1:44:47] that group why he had he passed away he
[1:44:49] says maybe this will be after I'm gone
[1:44:51] yeah right so he's removed from that
[1:44:53] group and here comes the bride
[1:44:55] by and there seems to be no visible
[1:44:57] leader men might try to make themselves
[1:45:00] a leader but the leader is the word and
[1:45:03] each one of them are watching the
[1:45:05] message yeah to God they're watching for
[1:45:09] Hallelujah watching the voice of the
[1:45:11] messenger what are they watching
[1:45:12] listening for it as they go by this
[1:45:15] other group didn't listen for it they
[1:45:16] didn't watch what they just went on but
[1:45:17] this group's watching him he said their
[1:45:19] eyes were on me they were watching me
[1:45:21] and here they were watching as they went
[1:45:22] by but he said a few of them got to look
[1:45:24] at at that other
[1:45:25] group and they fell out of Step you know
[1:45:28] how you will if you're walking in a
[1:45:29] certain beat and there's another beat

[1:46:22] you better be careful you get become a
[1:46:27] cynic get a critical spirit on you

[1:46:33] water of the word now look at that look
[1:46:35] at the message yes look at what's being
[1:46:38] preached yeah what's being preached
[1:46:40] that's what we're coming to the people
[1:46:41] aren't always going to be doing exactly

[1:46:44] message's fault right come on don't look
[1:46:47] at the people look at the word look but
[1:46:49] he said what they didn't realize is
[1:46:50] there was a there was a brass serpent in
[1:46:52] the camp the shadow of the king yeah
[1:46:54] there was stuff going on but don't look
[1:46:56] at that look at the lamb who's standing

[1:47:00] message from the
[1:47:01] lamb messenger told you he said don't
[1:47:03] look at me look at
[1:47:05] him
[1:47:07] amen good
[1:47:09] look there were two with two distinct
[1:47:12] voices watching the bride preview the
[1:47:14] voice of a prophet the voice of Elohim
[1:47:17] Revelation 18 that we already read after
[1:47:19] these things I saw another Angel come
[1:47:20] down from heaven having great power and
[1:47:22] he Earth was lightened with his glory he
[1:47:24] cried mightily with a strong voice
[1:47:26] saying Babylon the greatest fallen and
[1:47:28] become the habitation of devils the hold
[1:47:29] of every foul Spirit the cage of every
[1:47:31] unclean hateful bird brother penom
[1:47:33] taught that was his ministry he said
[1:47:36] come out of her God sent a mighty angel
[1:47:37] or messenger and his light wasn't in a
[1:47:40] corner it scattered over the Earth come
[1:47:42] out of her what her and her sisters too
[1:47:45] to lighten the Earth and call these
[1:47:46] people out of her he said now you know
[1:47:48] that's the truth the messenger was sent
[1:47:49] from heaven to call God's people out of
[1:47:51] Babylon and his light like of the Earth
[1:47:53] the great Holy Spirit he said notice
[1:47:55] this is the angel of Light remember the
[1:47:57] last Angel it's the angel in the church
[1:47:58] age of Lea it's the Lea messenger that's
[1:48:01] the last because the very next chapter
[1:48:03] is the 19th Chapter which say the coming
[1:48:05] bride yeah and this in the scripture the
[1:48:07] last angel that came to bring light
[1:48:08] before the coming of the Bride to go
[1:48:09] meet Christ was the Le to see in church
[1:48:11] age he said what was the Le to see in
[1:48:12] church age messenger calling them out of
[1:48:14] Babylon he said look churches caught in
[1:48:17] her cage with her with their dogmas
[1:48:18] denying the word and accepting dogmas
[1:48:21] again he said notice this is the last
[1:48:23] messenger for the coming of Christ in
[1:48:24] the 19th Chapter of Revelation the
[1:48:26] messenger's voice he said if we notice
[1:48:28] when he gave his voice on the earth
[1:48:30] there was a voice echoed again in heaven
[1:48:33] he said the fourth verse the 19th
[1:48:34] Chapter the messenger on the Earth was
[1:48:35] so inclined with God until when he spoke
[1:48:38] it on the earth God echoed the same
[1:48:39] thing out of Heaven what is that fourth
[1:48:41] first translation what does it mean it's
[1:48:43] God's voice speaking to his
[1:48:45] predestinated people what is it you saw
[1:48:47] past the flesh you saw past a man with w
[1:48:50] w with fults and failures and you saw
[1:48:51] there was a voice there that was eternal
[1:48:54] that spoke to your heart
[1:48:56] yeah you heard the voice of
[1:48:58] predestination yeah he said God's voice
[1:49:00] speaking to his predestinated people
[1:49:01] saying come out of her just exactly what
[1:49:03] the voice was he's got people all out

[1:49:34] corners and hope nobody notices that

[1:54:40] somebody just lays out in sin and
[1:54:42] Corruption but they're trying their best
[1:54:43] to get
[1:54:46] back get back in line with what the word
[1:54:48] says a man ought to be what the word
[1:54:50] says a woman ought to be amen people
[1:54:52] ought to be watching about that church
[1:54:55] that just went out into chaos the front
[1:54:56] one's never the back ones just two or
[1:54:58] three of them kind of stepped out a
[1:54:59] little bit to the right hand side looked
[1:55:02] like was trying to get back in line as
[1:55:03] they went
[1:55:05] by Hallelujah you might have lots of
[1:55:08] problems you might have a horrible past
[1:55:11] you might have been caught watching that
[1:55:12] other group influenced by music and
[1:55:14] dress and all the nonsense of the world
[1:55:17] Hollywood
[1:55:18] Showmanship but you're not one of them
[1:55:19] to go back you're the bride yeah you
[1:55:22] come from the mind of God because the
[1:55:24] voice calls you back and you've been
[1:55:25] washed by it you got to be washed to
[1:55:28] live in that City that's why but that's
[1:55:29] why I Don't Preach Doom and Gloom yeah
[1:55:31] come on I Don't Preach we're the only
[1:55:33] ones who have it right in the message
[1:55:35] come on now cuzz that's nonsense how am
[1:55:38] I going to produce a bride out of my
[1:55:40] Ministry in every nation I can't do it
[1:55:43] it wasn't up to me but there's a hundred
[1:55:46] other pastors like me a thousand maybe
[1:55:48] maybe 10,000 I don't know but they're
[1:55:50] out there preaching the word the best of
[1:55:51] their yeah they make mistakes yeah
[1:55:53] sometimes I get involved in things they
[1:55:54] shouldn't get involved in but there's
[1:55:55] still preaching a word going out that
[1:55:58] when the bride hears it they it'll be
[1:55:59] Washed by the Water of the word I am not
[1:56:02] discouraged by the state of the message
[1:56:04] come on I'm not discour you can point to
[1:56:06] me all the wrong things that have been
[1:56:08] done and all the things that have
[1:56:09] happened and I'll say there's been lots
[1:56:11] of bad things happened to the Baptist
[1:56:13] too but the Baptists aren't going up
[1:56:15] they're going down are you with me now
[1:56:17] there will be some saved out of
[1:56:18] tribulation but that's not what we're a
[1:56:20] part of we're a part of the those who
[1:56:22] are going up into heaven right you can
[1:56:25] show me all the bad things you want to
[1:56:26] show me I'm not I'm not an ostrich I'm
[1:56:28] not sticking my head in the sand but I
[1:56:30] tell you what I'm looking at a promise

[1:56:34] can take the land and we will take the
[1:56:36] land come on church we ought to be we

[1:58:17] wanted to and he doesn't want to but he
[1:58:20] couldn't cast you out because how could
[1:58:23] he be
[1:58:25] yeah oh come on Church how could he be a
[1:58:28] true husband a true groom with the stain
[1:58:31] oh my of a divorce from a bride he
[1:58:34] wouldn't listen to him so he had to put
[1:58:36] her away he would not do it even the
[1:58:38] Jews he comes and takes a Remnant blinds
[1:58:41] them for our sake he will not be a
[1:58:43] husband who lost his wife he will church
[1:58:47] but he redeems her he pays the price
[1:58:51] 100% on his
[1:58:53] part I'm going to have a
[1:58:56] bride
[1:58:57] [Music]
[1:58:59] hallelujah
[1:59:00] hallelujah and the proof of who we are
[1:59:03] is our response to that
[1:59:08] voice what you look down with the
[1:59:11] chicken pen I'm closing musicians go
[1:59:12] ahead and
[1:59:13] come you look down in the chicken pen
[1:59:15] and you see a a barnyard full of
[1:59:21] birds full of birds they're all
[1:59:25] birds you got different kinds of
[1:59:27] chickens different
[1:59:29] denominations full of
[1:59:31] birds but there was one who was an
[1:59:34] eagle he was born an eagle he's always
[1:59:38] been an eagle he doesn't know he's an
[1:59:40] eagle because he's never met an
[1:59:44] eagle but they're all in that one
[1:59:47] group they're all headed for the
[1:59:49] slaughterhouse to become Fried Chicken
[1:59:53] ghost chickens in the
[1:59:54] [Laughter]
[1:59:56] sky they're all headed for Colonel
[1:59:59] Sanders just trying to lighten you
[2:00:02] up all headed for church for the
[2:00:05] tribulation period sir now we think
[2:00:08] seriously now they're all headed towards
[2:00:10] that that's right but down amongst this
[2:00:14] group good and bad and
[2:00:17] indifferent is a bird that's eating
[2:00:20] chicken food
[2:00:22] acting like a
[2:00:24] chicken ping the ground like a chicken
[2:00:27] trying to cluck like a
[2:00:28] chicken but he's different he's always
[2:00:32] been different something about him's
[2:00:35] different what makes a difference he
[2:00:38] don't know that he's different until one
[2:00:41] day oh church one day his mama knew she
[2:00:45] laid another egg and so she goes looking
[2:00:48] for
[2:00:49] him and she calls out she look down
[2:00:52] there and she can see what he can't see
[2:00:55] amongst all that bunch of chickens
[2:00:56] there's an
[2:00:58] eagle he's brown at this stage like the
[2:01:01] other chickens he hasn't gotten his
[2:01:04] white his white oh church he he hasn't
[2:01:06] got maybe there's a chicken maybe some
[2:01:08] of your some of your kids you look up so
[2:01:10] well they're just a bunch of chickens
[2:01:11] but the eagle looks kind of like a
[2:01:12] chicken when he's young but as he gets
[2:01:15] older the difference begins to
[2:01:17] materialize and they look like a chicken
[2:01:20] but but and this little boy this little
[2:01:22] chicken probably thought he was a
[2:01:22] chicken but one day she come across she
[2:01:25] saw that he was there and she
[2:01:29] screamed she
[2:01:30] screamed when she screamed he heard it
[2:01:34] and he said I recognize that voice he
[2:01:37] still look like a chicken act like said
[2:01:39] Mama what must I do she said just chop
[2:01:41] up on the post he said well I got up
[2:01:43] here what did I do spread your
[2:01:45] wings she had to be taught by the word
[2:01:48] the eagle had to be taught to be an
[2:01:50] eagle to fly like a Eagle but it was
[2:01:52] always an eagle in the mind of the mama
[2:01:55] eagle and Christ had in his mind a
[2:01:58] bride which one is the eagle which are
[2:02:00] the chickens scream and you'll know
[2:02:02] preach the word and you begin to see the
[2:02:04] Eagles line up to
[2:02:05] it Hallelujah he had his mind a bride
[2:02:09] who choose to follow his voice he chose
[2:02:11] that bride and prepared a place for
[2:02:14] her as I talked about my children and
[2:02:17] they reminded me this is not the
[2:02:19] end one day it will be
[2:02:22] but the word reminds us that death is no
[2:02:24] big deal it's taking us out of this old
[2:02:26] pest house into his father's he said my
[2:02:30] father's house a completely different
[2:02:33] picture a completely different I hope I
[2:02:35] haven't bored you this morning but don't
[2:02:37] you love him aren't you glad you heard a
[2:02:41] scream come out from among the chicken
[2:02:43] maybe you're not all the way what you
[2:02:45] ought to be but you heard a
[2:02:47] voice there's a reason for that keep
[2:02:49] climbing keep moving keep trying to get
[2:02:51] back back in line we'll keep preaching
[2:02:54] it we'll keep spread promoting the
[2:02:56] message we'll keep pointing to pointing
[2:02:59] to the voice behind the voice not
[2:03:02] pointing to ourselves but poin to what
[2:03:04] God did in our day because that's what's
[2:03:06] going to wash us is the message of the
[2:03:08] hour don't you bow your heads with me
[2:03:10] this
[2:03:12] morning maybe the devil's tried to tell
[2:03:14] you you're you're not good enough and
[2:03:17] you'll never make
[2:03:19] it just let the word walk was you of
[2:03:22] that this

[2:03:26] bin but you're an
[2:03:29] eagle say come out from among Babylon
[2:03:32] babylon's a way of thinking a way of
[2:03:34] [Music]

[2:03:40] going to church he said but come out
