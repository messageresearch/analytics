[0:00] and so now the word of God has to be the
[0:04] I am today
[0:07] the I am right now not the I am of
[0:10] yesterday not using something that would
[0:12] just be able to justify me for the day
[0:14] before yesterday and now I can use today
[0:16] as an excuse no because he's the I am
[0:19] he's always present amen
[0:23] verse 3 Acts chapter 1 verse 3 and it
[0:26] says to whom he has shown himself alive
[0:28] after this Passion by many infallible
[0:31] proofs
[0:33] being seen of them 40 days speaking to
[0:36] the things speaking of the things
[0:39] pertaining of the kingdom of God excuse
[0:42] me
[0:49] I'm going to make a little parenthesis
[0:51] there
[0:52] speaking of the things pertaining to the
[0:55] kingdom of God
[0:58] speaking of the things pertaining of the
[1:01] Promised Land
[1:03] the kingdom of God
[1:05] the kingdom of God is within us
[1:09] the kingdom of God is God's word being
[1:12] manifested in me and you
[1:14] and so why is it that we're atmosphere
[1:17] creators why is it that this word
[1:19] actually has to produce a divine
[1:21] presence it's because we're partaking of
[1:25] that nature and now it's no longer
[1:28] myself
[1:29] but it's the word and myself able to be
[1:32] able to to be lived in today
[1:36] hey man
[1:38] and it says and being assembled together
[1:39] with them commanded them that they
[1:41] should not depart from Jerusalem so now
[1:43] he's given them a promise
[1:45] but wait for the promise of the Father
[1:47] which saith he ye have heard of me
[1:50] for John truly baptized with water but
[1:52] ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost
[1:54] not many days hence
[1:56] when they therefore were come together
[1:58] they asked him saying Lord will thou at
[2:01] this time restore again the Kingdom of
[2:04] Israel
[2:07] how many times in our mind do we always
[2:09] think about this
[2:11] this this
[2:14] Kingdom as being this this another
[2:17] another world
[2:19] you know the kingdom of God is within us
[2:24] and so as we're starting to know the
[2:26] word of God we're starting to know of
[2:29] his kingdom
[2:31] because his kingdom is his word remember
[2:33] it was everything in the beginning in
[2:35] the garden I kept everything in
[2:36] perfectness
[2:37] it was the word it was the obedience to
[2:39] the word it was the word that was being
[2:41] obeyed that kept everything in order
[2:44] everything and it's perfect in its
[2:46] perfect creation right
[2:49] and
[2:51] and so it says but ye shall receive a
[2:54] power verse 8.
[2:56] after the Holy Ghost has come upon you
[2:59] and he shall be witness says unto me
[3:02] both in Jerusalem in all Judea and
[3:05] Samaria and to the uttermost part of the
[3:08] Earth
[3:09] what was Joshua was he a witness of what
[3:12] he's saying
[3:15] was he testifying of the goodness that
[3:17] he was able to experience in this land
[3:19] where he was partaking of the fruit that
[3:22] he was eating
[3:23] he came back and he said come and see
[3:27] let me show you something I'm gonna I
[3:29] I've seen this I ate of this land he
[3:32] testified of his goodness he knew that
[3:35] what he was partaking of was nothing
[3:37] well but what the word had promised amen
[3:42] and when he has spoken these things
[3:44] while they beheld he was taken up and a
[3:46] cloud received him out of their sight
[3:48] and when they looked steadfastly towards
[3:51] heaven he went up behold to two men
[3:54] stood by them in white apparel which
[3:57] also said ye man of Galilee
[4:00] why standing gazing up into heaven the
[4:04] same Jesus which is taken up from you
[4:06] into heaven
[4:08] shall so come in like manner
[4:11] as ye have seen him go into heaven
[4:16] and so we understand that even even our
[4:19] generation
[4:21] we've seen Christ himself descending
[4:25] coming down in this messenger and he was
[4:28] able to show the true identity of what
[4:32] this land possesses Saints
[4:34] he was the he was the first brother that
[4:36] came to maturity in this generation it
[4:39] was the message of the Lord on this
[4:40] prophet's mouth
[4:42] in his attitude
[4:44] in his atmosphere in what he was that
[4:47] made him who he was but he was the
[4:49] dedication to the word it was dedication
[4:51] in prayer it was a dedication just like
[4:54] he was a Believer like me and you
[4:56] he was believing the word just like me
[4:59] and you were
[5:01] and
[5:05] I know these are new these are not new
[5:07] things these are just things that we're
[5:08] just bringing to your remembrance
[5:10] but
[5:12] second Peter chapter 1 verses 10 to 12
[5:15] says where wherefore the rather brethren
[5:18] give diligence to make your calling an
[5:21] election sure
[5:22] for if you do these things ye shall
[5:25] never
[5:26] fall
[5:29] understanding in what Vision we're
[5:31] walking in
[5:33] understanding in what is carrying us
[5:37] understanding that is just not man's
[5:39] abilities to try to figure this stuff
[5:41] out yeah
[5:43] it's not something we figure out it's
[5:45] something that we experience and
[5:47] something that we actually know and God
[5:50] comes in my life personally that I've
[5:52] let go of this human ability and I've
[5:54] let go of this thing and I've let go of
[5:56] all these things that this was trying to
[5:58] press against me because the devil will
[6:00] always come and try to He he'll he'll
[6:03] come and tempt you I I know he does
[6:04] because he does it to me too
[6:06] but if we don't constantly stay in the
[6:09] word and keep that as a distraction
[6:12] now we get caught up into that stuff
[6:15] it says
[6:17] and if you do these things you shall
[6:20] never fall right for so an entrance
[6:22] shall be ministered unto you abundantly
[6:25] into the Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord
[6:29] and Savior Jesus Christ praise the Lord
[6:33] wherefore I will not be negligent to put
[6:36] you always in remembrance of these
[6:38] things though you know them
[6:42] and be established in the present truth
[6:45] and so we understand that it was by the
[6:48] preaching of the gospel because faith
[6:50] comes by hearing
[6:52] and so as we're feeding on this word now
[6:55] as we're partaking of this divine nature
[6:59] we're partaking of a land now that we're
[7:02] we're going to
[7:04] and so now
[7:06] we understand that
[7:09] just to bring it to to my train of
[7:12] thought and all of this the Lord just
[7:14] blessed me with brother Branham
[7:16] talking about this in the conflict
[7:18] between God and Satan 19 and 62. this is
[7:21] where I caught my inspiration and it's
[7:22] just amazing to see how
[7:25] God himself
[7:29] used the word himself
[7:32] to make sure that the promise would come
[7:35] to pass
[7:36] that's why the bride can't fall right
[7:40] because it's not me and you doing
[7:41] anything
[7:43] if we came from eternity and we're going
[7:46] back from eternity then it's Eternal
[7:47] Word eternity carrying us all the way
[7:50] through praise God
[7:52] amen
[7:54] and so
[7:55] I want you to
[7:58] understand that this word is greater
[8:01] than just us professing where's message
[8:03] believers
[8:05] there has to come a point in our life
[8:07] where we stand for what we say
[8:10] there has to come a point in my life
[8:12] where now I'm not just depending on a
[8:15] vocabulary that I'm using that I've grew
[8:17] up in but now there's a life that's
[8:19] being lived before this human flesh and
[8:23] now I can be an atmosphere creator
[8:28] where I can provide comfort
[8:30] where I can have peace
[8:32] and so if we're eating of this fruit
[8:34] because these are promises
[8:37] okay let's just pretend that I'm eating
[8:39] out of a grape the promise of joy
[8:42] I'm enjoying
[8:44] the promise of joy
[8:46] now now I'm actually experiencing the
[8:50] promise of joy and peace and this land
[8:53] that we can tap into and now uh take
[8:55] these promises of the Lord as something
[8:58] physical for us because that's what will
[9:00] change this body we have to have a
[9:02] transformation of this body right
[9:04] because it's corruptable
[9:07] and we have to get it to be
[9:09] Incorruptible to be pleasant in the
[9:10] front of the Lord right and so that
[9:12] means my carnal mind my carnal think it
[9:14] has to has to be gone away with
[9:17] brother bam says this
[9:19] in into the conflict between God and
[9:21] Satan he says
[9:24] then one day came The Greatest Warrior
[9:26] of all
[9:27] the Lord Jesus the son of God and he
[9:31] said there is a land where a man don't
[9:33] die
[9:35] in my father's house is many mentioned
[9:38] if it wasn't so I would have told you I
[9:41] go
[9:42] and prepare a place and return to
[9:46] receive you
[9:47] now
[9:49] he's the prophet that comes speaking of
[9:52] a land just beyond the river of Jordan
[9:55] all right it says even though you got
[9:57] your forms even though you got your
[10:00] families you're blessed of God but yet
[10:04] have to die
[10:06] but yet
[10:08] there's a land Beyond where you don't
[10:11] die oh my it says he came to kadish
[10:14] Barney or Calvary
[10:16] the Judgment seat again where the
[10:19] penalty of sin that caused men to die it
[10:21] was meant at Judgment at Candice Bernina
[10:23] everybody knows what happened at barnia
[10:25] he paid the penalty of sin died crossed
[10:29] Jordan the Jordan of death and Rose up
[10:33] on the third day now he said coming back
[10:37] he said feel me
[10:39] he says a spirit don't have Flesh and
[10:42] Bones like me you got something to eat
[10:44] he says he ate fish and bread and he was
[10:48] with them for 40 days proving like
[10:51] Joshua that the land was there this is
[10:56] what the prophet says here it says he's
[10:58] the evidence
[10:59] of the Land There Saints he says now he
[11:03] said all that will believe this
[11:05] come on it says go into all the world
[11:08] preach the gospel to Every Creature he
[11:12] that believeth and is baptized shall be
[11:14] saved he that believeth not
[11:18] shall be damned okay and now he's
[11:20] bringing it to present tense it says now
[11:23] under their Pentecost he sent back the
[11:27] earnest of this place the Assurance the
[11:30] evidence that this land is real just
[11:33] like Joshua brought it brought back the
[11:35] evidence that Jesus brought the evidence
[11:38] of the Holy Ghost
[11:41] now we reckon ourselves dead
[11:44] we're buried with him in baptism and his
[11:48] death it says
[11:51] it says we are buried with this bad okay
[11:54] and we raised with him in the
[11:56] resurrection and now we are in
[12:00] come on already now going to it says
[12:04] we're now
[12:05] we're raised oh my says we are now not
[12:09] will be we are now tonight sitting in
[12:13] Heavenly places how in Christ Jesus not
[12:17] we will be some other time we are now
[12:19] the church don't realize who they are
[12:21] see we are now right this minute
[12:27] sitting in Heavenly places in Christ
[12:30] Jesus assembled together
[12:33] because he's always been about his word
[12:37] he's always been about himself having a
[12:41] union
[12:43] with the believer with his elect
[12:46] it was a personal relationship from the
[12:48] beginning if the musicians can come
[12:51] we're going to start winding down here
[12:53] but we understand
[12:57] that we've had the opening of the word
[13:00] in our generation
[13:03] the Lord came and showed himself in our
[13:06] generation
[13:07] just like he showed himself through all
[13:10] of these remembrance as a scripture
[13:12] testimonies that we've read in the
[13:14] scripture the word of God the promises
[13:16] that were said
[13:17] and now we understand that
[13:21] you know I was talking to brother then
[13:23] to brother Ben the other day and we were
[13:25] just talking about how you know the
[13:28] prophet
[13:29] there come a point in his life where
[13:32] you know you can hear it even on tapes
[13:34] on him testifying where he was talking
[13:36] about
[13:37] living into this other dimension more
[13:40] than he was living into this fleshly
[13:42] dimension
[13:43] [Music]
[13:45] and we realize that the more we live
[13:48] into the dimension of the word
[13:51] the more we feed on this land
[13:55] that we're going into
[13:58] the more we start being this
[14:02] land that we're inheriting
[14:05] brother bam says this in modern events
[14:07] are made clear by prophecy in 1965.
[14:12] but the real ordained of God
[14:15] the real Gene
[14:18] the real germ
[14:21] a soul of God that was in God before the
[14:26] foundation of the world I don't know
[14:28] sayings that makes Meeks feel special
[14:31] something Rings within my heart when he
[14:33] talks about something like that because
[14:34] that just it just makes me so sure
[14:38] that there's something inside of me that
[14:41] just pulls back to that word the way
[14:43] that he describes it it says remember
[14:46] view that's really got the spirit of God
[14:49] in you tonight
[14:52] you were here in Christ
[14:54] because he was the fullness of the word
[14:59] he was the fullness of the godhead
[15:01] bodily
[15:03] he was in Christ reconciling the world
[15:07] to himself
[15:09] do you believe that it says look he was
[15:12] in Christ
[15:14] then if you were in God now this is how
[15:17] the prophet puts it it's so simple
[15:19] then if you were in God a gene a word an
[15:25] attribute from the beginning
[15:27] then you walked with him here on Earth
[15:31] you talked with them on Earth you
[15:35] suffered with him on Earth
[15:38] you died with him at Calvary you Rose
[15:42] with him again and now
[15:46] you're sitting
[15:49] in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus
[15:51] communing with him
[15:54] the word
[15:57] as he feeds into your soul
[16:00] that man shall live
[16:04] by every word that proceedeth out of the
[16:06] mouth of God
[16:08] but after you become a Christian the
[16:10] prophet says
[16:12] then you are fortified by the word
[16:16] and any promise in the word
[16:19] it says few didn't know I was going to
[16:22] say that you are when you become a
[16:26] Christian your place behind the word of
[16:29] God see now there's your Fortress safety
[16:33] praise God every promise that is yours
[16:37] the only thing that you have to do is
[16:39] reach out and get it and go right with
[16:43] it how do you know it's going to work I
[16:45] don't have to know what's going to work
[16:46] explain to me I don't have to only thing
[16:49] I know is that God gave his children the
[16:52] best attack that he could have given him
[16:54] and the best attack with them that and
[16:56] it says and that's the word because he
[16:59] knows the working of the enemy
[17:03] because the enemy will always try to
[17:05] deceive the very elected if it would be
[17:07] possible by one word
[17:10] but we know that there was a record of
[17:12] this war that had never failed
[17:15] there was a record that we can go and
[17:18] reflect to and know that he's always
[17:20] been a wonderful
[17:23] he's he's never he's never been beaten
[17:25] by anybody
[17:27] he's an almighty God Amen let's just all
[17:30] stand
[17:32] but
[17:33] I want you tonight to
[17:38] just be honest with ourselves
[17:42] you know
[17:43] um
[17:50] there's nothing that we can hide from
[17:52] the Lord
[17:55] there's nothing that we can
[17:57] try to
[18:00] You Know cover up
[18:03] because if anybody knows and if anybody
[18:07] needs to know
[18:11] and so it's very important sometimes to
[18:13] be honest with ourselves and just
[18:16] just say Lord
[18:18] is my life
[18:20] lined up with the word
[18:24] Lord let me be my worst critic father
[18:28] maybe I just
[18:31] [Music]
[18:34] I don't spend much time in Reading I
[18:36] don't spend much time in testifying I
[18:40] don't spend much time with witnessing
[18:44] foreign Lord maybe you can get my heart
[18:47] to be on more on fire for you Lord
[18:50] [Music]
[18:52] you know
[18:54] as we're taken of these promises that he
[18:57] had given us
[18:58] [Music]
[19:01] as we're reaching into this land that
[19:03] he's provided for you that's full
[19:06] of milk and honey
[19:09] it's sweet
[19:11] it's Pleasant
[19:13] there's an atmosphere there that when
[19:15] you partake of that atmosphere you no
[19:18] longer become the same person
[19:22] the more you meet
[19:26] you meet the more of him
[19:28] he is in here
[19:30] the more of the word that we have in our
[19:34] life
[19:35] the more of God we are we have in our
[19:38] life
[19:39] brother bam says this in my closing
[19:41] statement you know I hope that you were
[19:43] encouraged tonight
[19:45] he says
[19:47] now what is the word of God
[19:50] [Music]
[19:52] the word of God is God himself
[19:56] so God gave the believer himself amen
[20:00] [Music]
[20:02] it's God himself
[20:05] he gave the believer himself
[20:08] to attack the Enemy by in other words
[20:11] he's the father and the word is God
[20:16] then the word is our father
[20:19] we're born by the word and he's standing
[20:23] in the Forefront for his children
[20:28] he says
[20:33] amen there you are
[20:35] standing out there for his children
[20:38] and then he's asking this question and I
[20:40] want you to just be honest with yourself
[20:43] what are you scared about
[20:44] [Music]
[20:46] what is your worry
[20:50] what are you scared about
[20:55] the prophet says this it says the
[20:57] Rapture sure
[20:59] they're coming is sure
[21:01] every blessing that has been promised is
[21:05] ours
[21:06] and belongs to us
[21:12] if we add faith
[21:15] if we start seeking for more of God
[21:20] the more of God
[21:23] we can be exposed in this true genuine
[21:26] word in this generation
[21:29] showing
[21:31] that this word
[21:33] lives
[21:34] let's just bow our heads
[21:36] Heavenly Father
[21:39] Lord You Know My Heart Lord and you know
[21:41] that
[21:43] Lord this was just burning on My Heart
[21:45] Lord
[21:47] Lord I hope that whatever was said was
[21:49] encouraging to your bride Lord It's a
[21:53] privilege for me to sit here Lord and
[21:55] Lord just speak of these things to your
[21:58] bride the Bride of Jesus Christ the one
[22:01] that's spotless the one that's without
[22:03] wrinkle Lord
[22:05] we are here Lord all together in one
[22:08] mind and one Accord knowing Lord that it
[22:10] was your word that led us all the way to
[22:11] this point
[22:12] and so Lord I pray now Lord that as
[22:16] there's a heart
[22:19] maybe there's somebody individual and
[22:22] our myths tonight
[22:24] that just wants to have a closer
[22:27] relationship with you
[22:29] maybe there's
[22:32] more desire to get closer into a
[22:35] presence Lord that we can create Lord
[22:38] we're tired of just saying Lord that
[22:40] we're just message Believers Lord
[22:43] Lord I want this life inside of me Lord
[22:46] to just be able to reflect Christ so
[22:49] much Lord where I would be able to die
[22:52] out to myself daily die out to my own
[22:55] thoughts and my own ideas and put all
[22:57] these things aside to understand Lord
[23:00] but there's nothing that man could live
[23:03] by but it's by your true unadulterated
[23:05] word of God
[23:07] and so Lord I would rather have your
[23:09] word on my lips than any other word Lord
[23:11] Jesus
[23:12] Lord
[23:14] we thank you for taking us in Heavenly
[23:16] places in Christ Jesus Lord
[23:18] Lord we're so thankful Lord that as
[23:21] we're dwelling in that presence now
[23:23] we're able to expose and and reflect
[23:26] that atmosphere Lord I pray that you get
[23:28] us closer to you Lord I pray that you
[23:31] encourage us Lord Lord that you continue
[23:33] to be with us as even we depart and we
