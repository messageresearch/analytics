move lord and in every situation and i pray that you would do that tonight we thank you for who who you are lord and for coming down among us and just being you lord and settling down in among us just to speak to us and to be with us and to heal and to to save and to work we thank you for that you are a living god that you don't you're not dead you're still alive today and you're the same yesterday today and forever and we thank you for that we praise you in jesus name amen amen do you love him tonight amen second corinthians chapter 11 and verse 1. ii corinthians 11 and 1 and then we'll read from ephesians 5 and verses 31 and 32 once again i want to continue on my thought of the mystery of marriage and i want to talk tonight about the first fall and i want you to think spiritually because every one of us are we believe we want to be at least the bride of christ and so there's a mystery here that we can know second corinthians chapter 11 and verse one would to god you could bear with me a little in my folly and indeed bear with me for i am jealous over you with godly jealousy for i have espoused you to one husband that i may present you as a chaste virgin to christ i just realized brother jt the other day how incredible this scripture is what he's saying is that it is possible for you and me to be presented as a chaste virgin to christ as though we had never done it in the first place amen what a wonderful thing and he says but i fear lest by any means as the serpent beguiled eve through his subtlety so your mind should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in christ for if he that cometh preacheth another jesus whom you have not we have not preached or if you receive another spirit which you have not received or another gospel which you have not accepted you might well bear with him and then ephesians chapter 5 and verse 31 says for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother shall be joined unto his wife they too shall be one flesh this is a great mystery but i speak concerning christ and the church pray the lord with his blessing to the word you may be seated this evening it's good to have all of you here tonight the first spring was wonderful as we said last week it was a paradise it was eden which means pleasure everything was new and the couple was in love and spring is a wonderful time but beware the long days of summer because a dry summer leads to a fall ever since that fall it's been winter for mankind but there will be another spring don't you love spring it's that time of year when when life is renewed when everything's new and fresh and and wonderful and every one of us experienced that in our marriage i'm sure every one of you that is married have experienced that every one of us that have been birthed into christ that have been married to the word we also have experienced that we know what it's like for that newness and that freshness of the relationship even though that first honeymoon was one that they didn't have to leave and that first place that they were was perfect yet somehow it in in the time and we don't know how long that it was but somehow during that time it it led to a fall and they didn't see it coming but it came anyway how did that happen adam and eve had never had a fight never got mad wouldn't they never went to bed angry not speaking to one another for days they'd never done that they never fought over who did the dishes never got upset about one doing more work than the other one never had that problem at all it was perfect everything was just the way it should be there was no reason for them to be dissatisfied with what they had and i just want to stop here and say today there's no reason for us to be dissatisfied with what we have in christ there's no reason for us to be dissatisfied with the message of the hour there's no reason for us to be dissatisfied with what god's given us in this day to be dissatisfied with our with our brothers and sisters to be dissatisfied with the word of god there's no reason for that and yet many people are many people are looking for something else looking for another opportunity looking for another messenger looking for another time looking for something great to come but i'm here to tell you today we're living again in a place where we can be restored back and it's been restored in our soul and it's leading us to a place where there's another eden coming again we're going right back to that place as i said last week we're not going back to just to pentecost we're not just going back to that we're going back to eden again and to go back to eden again we have to have the message of the hour amen so that we can be presented as a chaste virgin to christ now there's no reason for us to be dissatisfied with that but somehow adam and eve got separated long enough for the serpent to come in the honeymoon was over how did that happen the serpent first of all was cunning the bible says now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the lord god had made this is why paul said you might bear with him you might bear with him because he's convincing because he's got something that sounds good i'm so i'm so grateful for the fact that this end time bride will not fall because you remember paul had to say that to a generation of people that seed had to fall into the ground and die right and i believe the warning applies to us as individuals today but this end time bride will not fall right because there's uh he's saying to them i fear that you would bear with him but now there's been something take place what's happened and i'm getting ahead of myself but if we've been sealed away brother madam called it the womb being sealed you can't receive seed from anywhere else right and that what does that make you do it makes you want to work for him that much more but you've been sealed away you can't be deceived in this hour why not it's a very practical thing why because the message of the hour has come and because that word it wasn't just words on a book or in a book or on a tape but it's something that come in your heart you met christ the word of the hour and it become your life and so you might be misled from time to time but you will never be deceived like eve was you can't be because that's not the age we live in but paul says you might bear with him because he's so cunning now brother branham said oh boy that guy's a smart man you might say that about someone that guy's a smart man not very many people say that about me but maybe brother joe or some of y'all somebody will say that's a smart man he said well that don't mean a thing sure ahab was a smart man belter chazar was a smart man he said satan was the most cunning and crude subtle he said none of you could withstand him none at all thank god for revelation today because by our natural intellect we would we would become just like the world we would be as deceived as the world is by our natural intellect he said well i know the message i know what a prophet said with your own intellect alone none of you could withstand him none at all amen because that's the kind of a of a deceiver that he is ezekiel 28 and 12 tells us about satan and remember the serpent was anointed by satan to anoint eve with unbelief right and and so now we have satan indwelling the serpent he comes down and dwells the serpent and he anoints him to anoint eve with unbelief so that she'll believe what he has to say over the word of god so ezekiel 28 12 son of man take up a lamentation upon the king of tyrus remember the king of tyrus is a it's a type if you will or a figurehead that stands for the for satan for lucifer he said they're saying to him thus saith the lord god thou sealeth up to some full of wisdom perfect in beauty he said thou has been in eden the garden of god every precious stone was that covering he goes through all the stones and the workmanship of thy tabriz sun of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou was created thou art the anointed cherub that covereth and i have set thee so i was upon the holy mountain of god thou was walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire you talk about somebody had experience he had it somebody that that had been there and done that he wasn't know johnny come lately he wasn't a novice it wasn't somebody just got flashed in the pan no he was somebody who knew what he was doing he was someone who was who was created as being in that special place that he could he could almost believe that he was god oh church don't you realize that with great power comes great responsibility and here he had he was anointed in this way he said thou art the anointed cherub that covereth and i have set thee so though it's upon the holy mountain of god thus walked up and down the midst of the stones of fire that was perfect in thy ways from the day that thou was created never made a mistake never did anything wrong until iniquity was found in thee you see he believed satan because he was believable he was credible what he said made sense but it wasn't the word right he made sense and many times we reject doctrines out of hand or things because they don't make any sense and we should because god makes sense right we should we should apply common sense brother branham puts it in a kind of a rather funny way once he says that people need to have their brains baptized and go look it up but but it's true you can apply common sense to these things but be careful with it it's got to stay with the word because satan's gospel also makes sense and we'll reject something that doesn't make any sense but satan's gospel makes sense if you sit around it long enough and listen to it long enough and hear it you begin to even think brother branham and i don't have the quote with me but brother branham talks about driving down the road and listening to the radio he said and listen to these people talk about how that there was no creation all these rocks and these things have been here for millions and millions of years brother branham talks about that doubt coming in his own mind while he's driving down the road hearing that why because satan's wisdom makes sense sure it does it makes sense it's something that he doesn't just come up with something it's something that's a makes real sense and he's credible he's somebody that is credible and he uses credible men great men but we've got to say with the word above everything else if it's not the word it's not the word regardless of how much sense it makes now the serpent came and he was credible he was he was believable and he preached the word right he didn't come and bring a book of mormon right he didn't come to even and present to her uh some kind of uh book of islam or a quran or something like that what did he bring the bible the word that they had for that day he commented and brought the word of that day to them and he began to explain to her why things weren't exactly like she thought they were so back to genesis 3 1 he said unto the woman yeah if god said you shall not eat every of every tree of the garden now watch as god said that yes god said that but god said more than that right now in the amplified version it says now the serpent was more crafty subtle skilled and deceit than any living creature in the field which the lord god had made and the serpent they've gotten princess satan said to the woman can it really be that god has said you shall not eat from any tree of the garden can it really be that god has said do you really think that god would say something like that so he's attacking her he's not saying it's not so but he's saying is this what god said how does that make sense he appeals to a reason now [Music] preaching the word but the random says this and satan's eating he said oh you say but wait a minute we preached the word he said look back here at my text tonight satan was the one that preached the word to eve first god has said now no he not only preached the word he misquoted the word right and and how did he misquote it by leaving some of it out right and and so brother branham says this he said remember in the beginning he said the one only fortified that god gave adam and eve was to stay behind his word he said he didn't just not to didn't tell her it wasn't so he just misquoted one little phase of it now look what god had told adam and eve in the beginning in genesis 2 16 the lord god commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it and the day that thou eatest of thou shalt surely die now watch how god begins this he declares the whole thing of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat in other words you can do everything else but don't touch that but he begins it with of every tree of the garden now made us freely eat he reminds them of their privileges and then tells them what not to do right that's what god does but satan only quotes the negative part right satan quotes the negative part and see he will never remind you of how good you have it and you can apply this to a marriage you can apply this to a church as we said his job is to make you dissatisfied he'll never remind you how good you have it he'll only point out the negative he did not give her the full quote and that's why it's so important that we believe all the word psalms 40 and 7 speaking of the messiah coming of christ it said then said i lo i come in the volume of the book it is written to me not just in part of it in the volume of it in the whole in the entirety of the book luke 24 25 then he said unto them o fools and soul of heart to believe how much all that the prophets have spoken and brother branham emphasizes that all to believe all you've got to believe all and so he says and paul takes credit for that in acts 20 26 you know in his ministry he said wherefore i take you to record this day that i am pure from the blood of all men i have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of god there's nothing i held back because i might lose a taxpayer right because somebody might not like it i i declare it unto you all the counsel of god god help us today declared unto you all the council of god amen now the job of the ministry is to present the whole gospel now that gospel has to be rightly divided or rightly portioned and what that means is that we emphasize the importance or the application of the word for our day because there was a time when noah built an ark and that's still the word of god but today we live in a different day so we preach in the light of the hour we emphasize the importance of the gospel in our day that's rightly dividing the word rightly dividing it making it like a like a steward would give a portion to this one and a portion to that one and a portion to that one god gave a different portion to every age so in second timothy 2 14 he says if these saints put them in remembrance charging them before the lord that they strive not about words to no prophet now y'all just bear with me for a moment but we've got to be careful with this as message believers we're not careful we strive about words to no profit and the bible says the servant of god must not strive must not strive and so we you we strive about words and we've talked about that before there are some things that are essential there's some things that aren't right and those things that are non-essential that if you got it all figured out you wouldn't be any better off right than what you are today and what happens is you strive about those words and so he told he's speaking to timothy he said remind the preachers that they don't strive about the words to no prophet but to the subverting of the hearers in other words it takes them away from the gospel from the simplicity of the gospel and it becomes an over-reliance i don't want to sound like i'm mad at anybody when i say this because so i'll say it with a smile tonight and put on my joel osteen for a moment but we have that xm radio in our in our truck they had a trial free trial on there and and joel osteen has his own channel on there and you can just hear him smiling on the radio but he said don't strive about words to no prophet but to the subverting of hearers and it becomes an over reliance on dates and over reliance on uh you disagreeing with me over a certain date or a certain event or a certain word that brother branham said maybe something brother said that that to us is unexplainable and you attempt to explain it in such a way and create a doctrine out of it and when we don't know what it means because he didn't tell us what it meant but it's striving about words no prophet and it's the first people takes them away from the kingdom of god so he tells timothy study to show thyself approved unto god a workman that needeth not to be ashamed rightly dividing the word of truth he said but shun profane and vain babblings profane and vain babbling i love the king james version it's so so illustrative in in one word in one place he calls it paul calls it vain janglings vain babbling somebody just knocking a bell or or it's making noise but there's nothing coming out un-profane and vain babblings they will increase into more ungodliness if you get too far into yourself as a minister or as an individual in the message and believe it or not this applies to marriage too don't spend all your time on stuff that don't matter right and this is a trick that the enemy used to only present part of the word and then begin to expound on it with stuff that wasn't there right and and pretty soon he had eve in his in his grasp but beware of ministries because notice what satan did he only took the negative side beware ministries that only find fault with the message with the messenger or with the ministry or with the church you could say with what we have if all you can do is find fault that's what satan did that's what balaam does right if if my ministry is just finding fault with other ministries nobody gets fed the only thing that gets helped is my ego right i don't mean to be straight but we understand it there's many times we'll have preachers through all kinds of different preachers and i'm the ones that have come i'm so thankful god has allowed them to preach to us things that really mattered and good things but sometimes you'll hear different things as you go through life and you've heard many different things from different preachers but but remember that someone is always a complainer someone that's always finding bad things out in everybody there's plenty of bad to point out and sometimes you've got to point it out you've got to declare the whole gospel right but someone who only looks at the negative side and fails to see the promises of god will only increase ungodliness it won't help it just make it worse satan is a complainer the bible says he's the father of liars i believe he's also the father of complainers and complaints he's never happy in an eden in a church and i don't have a problem with that y'all are the least complaining people on the face of the earth and i appreciate that i probably complain more than you all but so i'm not preaching at you i'm just saying this is true satan is a complainer and he begins to complain to eve and pretty soon she probably began to complain too right isn't that what the mixed multitude did when they come out of egypt the mixed multitude of said fell to begin to desire the things they had in egypt and they began to complain and pretty soon the israelites began to complain too why because complaining spreads from one to the other and so satan began to complain the serpent was complaining he began to complain and pretty soon she found herself dissatisfied with what god had done see satan's never happy in an eden except his own he's not happy in a church that's governed by the word he's not happy in a marriage discovered by the word so he's gonna find a way to pick it apart and brittany's probably got her pitchfork out now but directed up here but we should not constantly find fault with one another especially in marriage because when you find fault with one another constantly you'll make a fall out of eden or a fall in eden among couples who stay together it's been proven by a survey that they did that five out of every 100 comments made about each other were put downs five out of a hundred i think i presented this to you before but just it'll bear repeating again brother adam i'm sorry every time you come to church i preach on marriage couples who would split later 10 out of every 100 comments were insults they don't seem like very much difference but if you it's double the number 5 out of 100 for couples who would stay together 10 out of 100 and the thing is the gap magnifies as you go on the people who complain more complain even more as the marriage goes along and pretty soon couples heading downhill were flinging five times as many cruel comments as happy couples somehow in eden and don't ask me to explain how this happened because that was a pretty nice place you'd think that if you could take someone to paradise and and live there that that that would be a pretty good place to be and to make your marriage work but somehow in eden it didn't work somehow in eden married life grew dull and adam and eve grew far enough apart that eve stopped to listen to the serpent you see they had to be separated long enough because remember eve presented it to adam alone the serpent was with her alone as married people but this applies spiritually as well be wary of being separated married life was meant to be different from single life if you're going to continue with your single life after you get married there's a problem there some of you that have been married a long time don't you don't have anything left that you need to work on but you know that this is true that if you continue to live like you did when you were single you wouldn't be married still and somehow adam was gone i don't know why he was gone he probably had a good excuse for being gone after all he was a miniature god had a good job he could go out and speak to the trees and and talk to all of them and everything would be just fine but he wasn't there i'm not blaming him for it it's just somehow he wasn't there a man has to work to provide for his family but your job will never be as important as your family not even this job i have to remind myself of that sometimes because we do lay everything down for the gospel and i believe that but i've i had this in my notes and i took it out but i guess i do i was meant to say it because i'm reminded of it but i i've been reminded by elder ministers and every time i talk to an older pastor or or an older evangelist every time they give me the same piece of advice spend time with your family spend time with your family and someone will say it this way don't do what i did and i've been given that advice multiple times by elder ministers because it's a temptation that we have to do what feels like it's god's work and not be with our family even if you have to spend more time at work than you do with your family which sometimes you have to do your job is still not more important than your family moses to illustrate this we'll go back to the law a lot of things about the law that made sense this was common sense for that day and time they lived in moses deals with divorce in deuteronomy 24 he talks about a bill of divorcement and then he says this in verse 5 he said when a man has taken a new wife he shall not go out to war neither should he be charged with any business which sounds like he was free to do whatever he wanted but he but he said he should be free at home one year and he has something he's tasked with it doesn't mean he didn't work because he'd have to work to bring in the crops and whatever they normally did but he said he won't have any public business the first year because his job is going to be to cheer up his wife which he have taken do you know that was a biblical job requirement for a husband make your wife happy well i'm not getting any responses from that that's what it says he'll cheer up his life for one year and some of you all are saying thank god we're not under the law but there's a reason for that there's a very practical reason for that if he gets married and immediately goes out to war then his wife spends the first year all the time wondering where he's at they don't get to know one another they don't get to and we see that today so many people get married and then immediately begin to work each one their own 60 hour a week and sometimes it has to be done i'm not begrudging your work but i'm just saying if you can spend time together because it matters in making your wife happy wesley said that that business was any public office or employment which would cause an absence from or neglect of his wife one year that their affections may be firmly settled so there may be no occasions for the divorces last mentioned see honeymoons only last for a couple of weeks and you got to get down to the business of life but even in the business of life remember you got to learn to know one another to love one another and how to make each other happy the bible keeps reminding men to be happy with their wives i don't find a place where ever reminds women to be happy with their husbands but it keeps reminding men to be happy with their wives proverbs 5 18 let thy fountain be blessed and rejoice with the wife of thy youth rejoice in ecclesiastes 9 and 9 live joyfully with the wife whom thou loveth all the days of thy life of thy vanity when she had given the unto the son all the days of thy vanity for that is thy portion in this life and in thy labor which thou taketh under the sun in the new testament in first peter 3 7 paul or peter puts it this way he said likewise your husbands dwell with them according to knowledge i this illustration of that i heard brother branham talking today about walking with his wife while shopping and talking about how it wore his feet out and it was kind of a comical image to think about a prophet of god following his wife around while she's shopping because i identify with that i've been there and done that most of you probably have as well but here a prophet of god had to do that why to make his wife happy and the thing is if it works it won't be just one person trying to make the other happy because all that would bring his arrogance on one side but you both are trying to make each other happy but it's the men many times we forget to do it and that's why the bible keeps reminding us to do it he says well with them according to knowledge so brother branham following along letting his feet get wore out when he could have been home studying for us putting on an apron as we've heard many times and and doing those things was brother branham's brother branham dwelling with his wife according to knowledge right remember there was a time where the brandon was going to go west but he waited because his wife wasn't ready to go and and so there's things you've got to give grow with them according to knowledge giving honor to the wife is unto the weaker vessel as being heirs together of the grace of life that your prayers be not hindered because if you're not happy together your prayers will be hindered see marriage is not about me being happy it's about me making someone else happy and when you go into it this will make me happy you go into it for the wrong reasons and again this has a spiritual application so we're going to come around in just a moment but brother branham and christ has revealed in his own word says i see four or five of them young men young wives fine women he said i knew how them boys loved their wives so i said to them here is the way to test it here's the way to test how if you love your wife he said if your wife before you were married he said now you go back and say this married life you've just been dreaming you were married you really wasn't married but you dreamed you were and you woke up and you went and talked it over with your girlfriend and said you know i dreamed that we were married we had children we were living happy and waiting for the coming of the lord and everything and then this girl would say to you you know i love another man better than i love you i could be happier with the other man remember he said this is how you know if you really love that woman could you from your heart love her well enough to say god's blessings rest upon you my dear go with this other man. now he's not telling you to do that right he's given us an example an allegory if you weren't married and she said she would be happier with someone else could you say go with this other man now here's why he said now check that each of you men or your women see well if your love is correct you would do that listen for you are interested in her welfare you want to make her happy he said what he said you know you could have her you can live with her she's your wife she will be she'll marry you but she won't be happy she would be happier he said and then if you love her then you want her to be happy and brother madam takes that and you can go read the rest of the quote brother takes it in the spiritual realm and he says if god told me i couldn't go to heaven if that would make him happy i'd be willing to go to hell you see how non-self-centered that is in this culture of self-idolatry i was watching the other day of a a little thing where they walked through i've been walking on a treadmill i've been gaining weight ever since it's a meeting more but i'm walking on a treadmill every day and as i'm walking i'm looking at the pyramids of egypt and and this the guide walks you through and shows you the pyramids and he shows you all the things that they were constantly making images of themselves the pharaohs were you don't see any images of the common people the slaves of the of the builders or anything like that but the pharaohs images are all over egypt they've been there for five thousand years all over the place images of themselves the the selfies of the day and i got thing about that i thought we're all pharaohs today everyone has an ego to take care of and they post it on their social media their walls of their tombs they posted inscriptions and told how they defeated this certain king in assyria and the guy said it's a funny thing because actually in assyria there's an inscription that looks much the same about the same battle and it says they won so it's just like today you can't believe what you read on social media see it's all about that this idolatrous self-worship age it's all about me but god says i want it to be about about me you see god if you think about this god made it all about us so that we could make it all about him he condescended came down gave up his royal station wrapped himself in a body of flesh come down on a sneak in manger with the animals and he'd come down there so that he could make it all about me to make me happy pretty bad but he knew the ultimate goal the bible says he endured the cross despising the shame for the joy that was set before him because he knew if he would do that for me that i would turn back and i would love him because i was his child amen he said so if you love her you want her to be happy if you love god you want him to be happy every once in a while you run into someone that refuses to be happy what do you do about that paul tells us a brother sister's not under bondage in such cases he doesn't mean you get divorced and remarried but he's saying that if someone is just unhappy and leaves let him leave because god has called us to peace you can go read the whole quote and i've probably read it to you before if not i will at some point my brother random questions and answers number one he talks about a question from a man that whose wife wanted a divorce and he said now if she is one of god's elected she will come to him if she's not she's not worth worrying about he said then that sounds harsh doesn't it but it's the truth he said then if it does he said if you worry it's not worth worrying about he's not saying he shouldn't be concerned he shouldn't care but it's not worth worrying about he said if you worry it'll break your health down that's what satan wants to do he said he's working i know at you if we could just see where the enemy is trying to attack us on every level he said so you just commit the whole thing to god and go right on serving god just as happy as you can be live to make someone else happy but if that person that you live to make happy won't be happy you go be happy in christ genesis 3 2 let's go on the woman said to the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden so she recognizes he misquoted the word she should have walked away but she says we we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden so it wasn't a lack of knowledge that kept that made her fall she knew what god said but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden god has said you shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it lest you die and the serpent said unto the woman you shall not surely die and the way he puts that is surely god didn't mean that you shall not surely die can it be that god has said surely not but the brother says not surely that i see how he quoted it around he said oh we believe the days of miracles is fast now watch what brother adam takes it to the serpent that he comes down now in a spiritual realm he comes down and he tries to tell us oh we believe the days of miracles has passed and let me just just drop this in because i think it's important but we we don't believe in cessationism we don't believe that the days of miracles is past we don't believe the days of the fivefold ministry is past whatever you want to call the gifts of ephesians 4 11 and we don't believe that the gifts of the spirit are past because if we believe any of that then we cannot believe that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever right so that's church of christ doctrine you hear that from message people they just they they're still in dwelt in that church of christ doctrine or whatever it is it comes from them it didn't come from god it didn't come from brother branham the bible doesn't say that brother brown doesn't say it anywhere so brother brown says oh we believe the days of miracles has passed see how he quoted it around we don't believe there's such a thing as people receiving the holy ghost like they did on pentecost he said oh anyway you're baptized it doesn't make any difference see the devil see his tactics say well why does it make a difference because god said it did he say well surely god won't care god does care and if you deliberately walk over his word he cares enough to keep his word so he cares aren't you glad he cares about his word you see if god could let someone go on something like that if there could be a jot or tittle pass away it would mean that the promises may not be true right if he could let one thing of the word pass away without being true then it would mean that the promises to us are also may not be true you realize the confidence we could have in him today that he keeps every word amen well i'm so glad that he does i can't keep it you can't keep it but he keeps it and i have to say amen to every word amen now he said oh anyway you're baptized it doesn't make any difference see the devil sees tactics well if the doctor told you you can't get well that settles it he said now not discrediting disbelieving the doctor the doctor is working on the line of scientific you hear so much today about fall the science listen what he's saying the doctor is working on the line of scientific and the doctor has done everything he can to save the person's life and it can't be saved because there's nothing else he knows to do he's at the end of his wits the man is honest he said but now the tree of knowledge is all right he said but when you go as far as it'll go then step off on the tree of life and just keep on going brother david you've experienced that you know what that's like to walk down the tree of knowledge they can do so much for you but you got to step on the tree of life everybody let god take care of the rest he can do it church you believe that tonight walk as far as you can on the tree of knowledge and just keep on going on the tree of life amen he said it'll just work so far amen verse 5 says for god does know that on the day you eat thereof then your eyes shall be open you shall be his gods knowing good and evil so he says god's hiding something from you he's keeping something back he hasn't given you everything he hasn't told you everything but he told them what they needed to know to remain in eden he said but if god hath known the day you eat though of your eyes will be open you should be as gods knowing good and evil what was he doing he was establishing himself know this is real important so prick your conscience for a moment before we close he was establishing himself as the one the only one who could tell her what god really meant by what he said he's the only one who can really tell her how many false doctrines have started the same way because a preacher said i'm the only one that can tell you there's two ways you can do that you can say i'm the only one that can tell you you can say everybody else is wrong if god is not telling me everything who am i going to turn to what was he doing he was establishing his own ministry above the word now watch that he was establishing his own knowledge in the heart of eve to make her want to have this knowledge that only he could give he said if you'll listen to me you'll be like gods they already were they already were but he said if you'll listen to me you'll be his gods now listen brother brown said then if eve lusted for knowledge it was sin he says when we lust for knowledge we want a phd lld it's sin to do so he said that's strong statements but that's the truth no matter how strong it is it's still the truth to lust for knowledge understanding now remember he's talking about the word of god he's not talking about learning how to how to stitch a a body together as a doctor or surgeon or something like that he's talking about when it comes to the word of god to us for knowledge understanding the thing of it is he said today he said we don't try to establish the word of god in the people's hearts we're trying to establish ourselves churches are trying to establish the doctrine of the church in a person's heart and that's why they get so mad when somebody goes to another church because he's rejected the establishment of that but a person doesn't have to go to my church to have christ established in his heart you understand so churches are trying to establish the doctrine of the church in a person's heart what does the catholic church do if you bring it in they're going to cost you they got ritual they got ceremony what is that for they'll even tell you the rosary beads all of that it's to establish the doctrine of the church and the people's heart all of these ceremonies all these images is to establish the doctrine of the church now watch he said we are commanded to establish the word of god amen i don't have to have anything else here to have church no image no pictures no piano no organ but i have to have the word you understand we could do without everything else but we must have the word we are commanded to establish the word of god paul said i didn't come to you with enticing words of man that your faith might rest up in the knowledge of man but i come to you in power in manifestations of the holy ghost that your faith might rest in god he said there you are what does it do this message didn't come as an intellectual theory it comes showing us that god was real that he was the same yesterday today and forever do we believe that tonight and he's the same on a wednesday night this year's on sunday morning he's the same yesterday today and forever in every moment of our life and every trial of our life he's still the same thank you lord amen he can we're going back to eden church aren't you looking forward to it i went through a little time today i was driving in my truck and my mind flashed back and when i was a 17 or 18 year old preacher driving to preach somewhere and i got thinking about how much i enjoyed those days but i'd work as much as i had to because i wasn't married and then i'd go out and preach somewhere and i just enjoyed that so much and i got to spend so much time in prayer and in the word of god i got to thinking about that jt and thinking about how things have changed but i got to think about it i thought i still have the same feeling in my heart there's still something in my heart that burns for god a passion i may not be able to say it as quickly as i once did or as with as much fervor as i once did but i still got the same passion in my heart and for just a moment i felt like a young preacher again let me tell you there's a there's an end that we're going back to there's a place i can't recreate that again in my life but we have a promise that there's an eden there's a paradise that we're going back to hey man there's a place where there's nothing that can hurt or destroy no harm a place that will fit just exactly and be and manifest exactly what we should be amen oh don't you love him tonight oh he's real church if we could just enter in and and realize that the goodness of god god begins to speak to us and talk to us from the word oh it means so much listen i said man mustn't establish yourself read that again man mustn't establish yourself we find it he said amongst let god do something for a person and send him out you find every man trying to impersonate it see they're trying to establish themselves every man says i did this me i mind my denomination me this establishing themselves he said what are we preaching about ourselves or the kingdom of god god help me today what are we preaching about i could stand up here and just just tell you stories about myself and sometimes i do you know you gotta open up a little bit to the people but the thing i want to establish is not what i did or what's happened in my ministry but it's christ the word what are we preaching about ourselves of the kingdom of god he said establish the word of god take out the unbelief and establish the kingdom of god in a man's heart and the kingdom of god cannot be established in a man's heart unless god made that man thus in other words you can't be an impersonation of christianity or an impersonation of some other preacher god made the man that thus he said and remember the deceitful part men think that it's right he said there's a way that seems right into a man every intellectual being seems right every intellectual being seems right he said i told you a few sundays ago when i stood by my dying baby and satan's standing there and said there's your daddy died in your arms the other night there's your wife laying down on the morgue here's your baby going and you ask him to answer you and he pulled a shade down over you he said yet he's a good god and you said he was a healer he said you who are standing for what she said was right you're wrong he said oh every reason every mental faculty had to agree that it was right and he was right that much he was right that much so was he right when he told eve your eyes will be open and you'll know right from wrong you'll be as gods that way knowing right from wrong because god didn't let them see themselves yet that they were naked so they knew they would know right from wrong and he was right but you see it was contrary to the word of god so does ministers and seminaries learning man-made theology it may seem right it may be a good understanding of the thing but it's wrong he said we don't have to understand it he didn't say we wouldn't understand it but we don't have to we believe it because god said it so and that settles it forever he said the whole thing very bad that's the way to believe it we can understand things about this message we thank god for the understanding we have but we believe it regardless of what we understand genesis 3 6 when the woman saw the tree was good for food that it was pleasant to the eyes that a tree to be desired make one wise she took her the fruit their oven did eat they've all slowed to her husband with her and he did eat one by one he knocked down every objection that she had mentally she stood there vulnerable to his advances why because she didn't stay behind the word and the eyes of them both were opened and they knew they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons and as brother branham like to say if an apple did that let's pass the apples again brother branham said compare this now how much alike that man and his wife both in god's eating that one stitch of clothes on them and knew it not why didn't they know it for they revealed to their senses of nakedness by the holy veil of the holy spirit they could look right at each other and they didn't know that they were naked they were veiled with the holy spirit of holiness they were veiled he said god's veil yet today can look and not lust now this is important he said they turn their head how do they look and not lust by turning their head i had someone tell me from a church around here actually one time counseled a man that i was dealing with who had a problem where he had such a a lust spirit on him he would go by the swimming pool during the day and sit there and watch been years ago another place another time no one that you know but someone around in this area had told him said well if you get the holy ghost you could look at that all day and it wouldn't bother you listen what he said god's veil today can look and not lost they turn their head that's how they look and not lust because if they look at that long enough they'll lust right but god's veil will make you turn your head it's a holy veil see god he said they were both one was man and the other one was woman they did not know they were naked because the holiness of god kept their eyes veiled notice he said god hid their conscience from sin by the holy fail listen my brother ties that to the new birth he said wish we had some time to lay on that a few minutes he said look here for he the worshiper once purged hebrews the worshiper once purged has no more conscience of sin sin has passed from him amen he said i heard brother neville say this morning someone might have been asking him why didn't i preach on the holy ghost why didn't i do this here it is the holy ghost is the action in you you can say it this way it's what makes you tick it's the maidspring it's what makes you tick it's the action in you amen the holy ghost is the action in you it's a life not an emotion not some sort of fleshly evidence but it's a person it is a person jesus christ the word of god established in your heart to quicken every word of this age hallelujah then if god said that they'll cast out devils they'll speak with new tongues they'll drink any deadly thing and won't harm them what does that do that's a word for this age right because that goes all the way to the end right that's a word for this age then we'll do that but we'll also fulfill every word for our age right not just not just that we'll fulfill every word for our age why because the spirit in us does that through us he said watch the holy ghost in action he said not so much in demonstrations but in action what it does according to the word amen amen it's a person that does according to the word musicians go ahead and come i'm going to stop here but notice the simplicity of the gospel what does it do it brings us back to eden again how does it do it by establishing the person of christ the word in the heart of the people it tears out every other image every other self-created idol if god's willing i'm going to talk about that sunday morning but every idol that man has created every idol you create remember man always created idols in his own image but here it can be torn down and every stronghold that everything that exalts itself against the knowledge of christ by the simplicity of the gospel is torn down is cast down every stronghold of the enemy every complex to bring us back to eden again by establishing the person of christ the word of the heart of the people you see this bride will not fall satan will not get to her to make her fall but christ the word has already come but you see the importance of the opening of the word it makes you sealed away you're not waiting on another prophet to come you're not waiting on something else to happen you've been sealed away hey man you can't fall like the other ages did why because there's something inside of you old seed that holds on oh i'm so glad that he's done that for us today aren't you doesn't that make you happy amen makes you feel like you're in eden for a moment again hallelujah amen amen g give me a g chord amen oh come magnify the
