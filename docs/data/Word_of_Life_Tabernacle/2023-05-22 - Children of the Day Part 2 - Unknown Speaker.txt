whatever needs that there are I pray that you would meet those needs today and speak directly to your people oh God help me today Lord I want so badly to to get out what's on my heart but Lord only you can allow that to be done I pray that you do it today Lord we surrender everything to our our voices our our thoughts our our innermost being oh God everything that we are we ask you to come fill us with Revelation oh God heal the sick touch those that are in need we pray in Jesus name foreign first Thessalonians chapter 5 and verse 5. first Thessalonians 5 5 and then we'll read down through verse 8. portion of what we read this morning he says you are all the children of light and the children of the day we are not of the night nor of Darkness therefore let us not sleep he's saying it's pretty simple isn't it but he's saying we don't sleep because it's not night time we're not going to sleep spiritually he said let's do others but let us watch and be sober for they that sleep sleep in the night and they'd be drunken or Drunken In the Night let us who are of the day and again as we talked about this morning we're not just in the day we're not just we don't just see the day we are of the day we are the sons of Light the sons of the day be sober putting on the breastplate of faith and love and for a helmet the hope of Salvation I pray the Lord would add his Blessing to the word you may be seated this evening we left off this morning the the mighty angel of Revelation 10 has come down and and put his his feet one foot on the land and one on the seat and it signifies that all things someone say all things all things are under the authority of the word he is the word in Revelation 19 it tells of how when he comes back as King in the third coming as he comes at the end of the tribulation period he said I saw heaven opened and behold a white horse and he that set upon him was called faithful and true or are is he faithful today is he true there's no songs that I call you Faithful and that's what we want to say tonight he said he was called faithful and true and righteousness he just judge and make war his eyes were as a flame of fire on his head were many crowns and he had a name written that no man knew but he himself and he was clothed with the vesture dipped in Blood and his name is called the word of God he's identified by being the word of God Amen and the armies which were in heaven followed him upon light horses clothed in fine linen white and clean so he shows himself as in this hour as the one who has supreme authority supreme authority but the realm says this about the the cloud that came that was more it was a sign of something a symbol of something the cloud picture that we have was more just saying well God is with his Prophet well that's true but that's not what it was all about it was Christ presenting himself to this age and it really doesn't matter how the cloud got up there although I believe it was the supernatural Cloud but it really doesn't matter whose face was in the cloud it was Christ and and he turned it to the right and the spirit told him to turn it to the right when he did he actually saw the face of Jesus Christ in the cloud and so the cloud then he said there he is with them Angels the message which was the seven breaking of them Seven Seals that revealed serpent seed and all these things here he says it shows it is his very covering it's his supreme authority supreme authority he is supreme and he is wigged or covered the Bible said he changed his countenance he changed himself in the word the word immoral Faith he said which means a Greek actor that plays many parts today is one thing and the next ACT is something else so in this hour he changed his mask he said he was God the father and one act God the son in another act and God the Holy Ghost in This act he said say see there he is his word is still Supreme Hallelujah he said we're living in the last days so he is the supreme authority of Our Lives could we could we acknowledge that today that he is the word and he is the supreme authority of Our Lives that means that he is has jurisdiction over every area of our life I I I'm working to preach tonight you're gonna have to preach with me he he has jurisdiction what that means is you know if you've got a traffic ticket you might have to find out what jurisdiction it was in to find out where to pay the ticket right you might have to go to Cherokee Village or he probably did if you drove through there you probably got a ticket but you might have to go wherever it is that's you I'm sure Stuart has a lot of experience and pain traffic tickets so you know you get your yeah your jurisdiction you have to look and see who's responsible but what he's saying by coming in this hour as the son of man by coming by the word coming in our hour what's he saying he's saying I have jurisdiction over every area he put his feet on the land and on the sea and he said I've got jurisdiction over your family I've got jurisdiction over your home I've got jurisdiction over the church I've got Authority overthought your life I've got authority over sickness I've got to throw don't you realize church that's where you stand today that's who you are today hey man he has supreme authority he has jurisdiction in that wonderful brother JT this word just means so much to me he has supreme authority over every area he has authority over every stroke he has authority over heart disease he has authority over blood pressure he has authority over depression he has jurisdiction over every other area of your life and he has given you Authority to be an overcomer hey man do you believe that today the Bible says as many as received him he gave power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name so he delegates his authority to you in Matthew 18 and 18 where verily I say unto you whatsoever you shall bind on Earth shall you be bound in heaven shall be bound in heaven whatsoever you shall loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven don't tell me you can't live a Christian Life don't tell me it's too hard it's not too hard why because he's given you the authority to do that he said again I say unto you if two of you shall agree on Earth that's touching anything someone say anything how many have to get you to repeat it all so you'll hear it but he said if two of you shall agree on us touching anything that they shall ask it should be done for them of My Father which is in heaven forward two or three we got more than that here tonight we're two or three are gathered together in my name there am I in the midst of them who the authority of the word the final judge Hallelujah that's good a winner doesn't have to does not have to worry about the judge he knows he won so if he's got a fair judge he's got a fair person at the end that's going to judge the results listen you and I have already won by the cross of Calvary we've already won so the judge comes in this hour to tell us you're a winner Hallelujah and so he separates the good from the bad and and the elect and the non-elect and he comes in rightly divides the word let's see how we live in so I want to ask you this morning this evening rather what is under your feet what is under your feet remember you're the body of Christ and the mighty angel had his feet on the land and on the seat now first and we alluded to it this morning but I want to dig into it a little bit and I won't hold you that long this afternoon but the first thing is you have authority over apostate religion you have authority over apostate religion look at Revelation Chapter 13 Verse 1. we'll just go through it look it up in the in your Bible if you have one on your phone if you brought if that's the way you look at your Bible but look it up so you can so you'll have it there Revelation 13 and 1. excuse me he said I stood upon the sand of the sea and saw a beast rise up out of the sea having seven heads and I'm not sick I just don't have a voice I might jump with a Joe I talk too much today me and brother Joe both don't have a voice for the same reason now he said having seven heads and ten horns so a beast rise up notice out of the sea upon his horns ten crowns upon his head's the name of blasphemy and the Beast which I saw was likened to a leopard and his feet were as the feet of a bear and his mouth is the mouth of a lion and the dragon gave him his power and seat and great Authority we could go into what that Beast was and how in verse three he said I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death his deadly wound was healed Pagan Rome became papal Rome all the world wandered after the Beast and even the ten crowns are the ten horns all those things that that went from the went into the Holy Roman Empire and all that still exists today in the form of the European Union and now and but it's just a it's a successor of that and but it's still a Roman system now he said who and they worshiped the dragon which gave power to the Beast and they worshiped the Beast saying who is likened to the Beast who is able to make war with him there was giving to him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemy he said power was given unto him to continue 42 months and he opened his mouth and blasphemy against God to blaspheme his name in his Tabernacle and then the dwell in heaven it was given unto him to make war with the Saints and to overcome them power was given him over all kindreds and tons and Nations and all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in the Book of Life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world he said If any man have an ear let him here he that lead us into captivity shall go into captivity either kill us with the sword must be killed with the sword here's the patience of the faith of the Saints but listen to me if you're the children of the day if you have heard the voice from heaven this Beast is under your feet Hallelujah the apostate religion of the end time is not going to overcome you it will not overcome those who have their name written in the Lamb's Book of Life who will not be deceived oh that that's not just me saying that it's not a hopeful statement but the the message of the hour the mighty angel came down and spoke through a prophet and said you cannot be deceived the word of the hour says you are the electrical you cannot be deceived watch said for their shall arise false Christ and that doesn't mean you won't be misled from time to time but he'll always correct you yes and watch he said there shall arise false Christ and false prophets shall show great signs and wonders and so much that if it were possible I love that they shall deceive the very elect 13 and 22 for false Christ and false prophets shall rise and shall show signs and wonders to seduce if it were possible even the elect it's not possible oh thank God for that I thank God for that it's not me that keeps me sane it's not me that gets me straight on the word but it's so it's coming under the influence of the mighty angel in our day coming under the influence of the word in her day this this message is more than just a prophet this message is more than just a man it's more than just somebody standing there and speaking things but it's God himself came down and showed himself to be alive yes to give us Authority isn't that wonderful you won't be deceived he said I heard Billy Graham say the other day in a message he said the elected has already deceived he said no no the election ain't going to be deceived no they won't be no church members will come on now but not the elected they was chosen from the foundation of the world they cannot be deceived oh aren't you glad for the word of the hour listen to what he's telling you he said you can't commit adultery you're already pregnant he's talking spiritually now you can't commit adultery you're already pregnant or he can't take a hold the womb of life is close to anything else you're already his by predestination that seed has come to life oh man that wonderful brother JT one day God got a hold of you and the womb was closed up yeah okay hallelujah oh that makes me feel good tonight the womb was closed up with Isaac you can't even eat anything else that's right but the womb has been closed up you may come through your mind but it can't stay there Hallelujah you're already his by predestination that seed has come to life no world can get in yeah I'm so glad for that today John 17 and 6 Jesus said of those his disciples he said I manifested thy name notice how positive this is I haven't manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world thine they were and thou gave us them me and they have kept Thy Word he said now they have known that all things whatsoever thou has given me are of Thee for I have given unto them The Words which thou gave us me I've given unto them the words what was it the entrance of light the entrance of the word it's the entrance of light I have given unto them The Words which thou gave us me and they have received them and have known surely that I come out from thee and they have believed that thou did send me he said I pray for them oh I love that I pray not for the world but for them which thou has given me for their time and all mine are thine and thine are mine and I am glorified in them now I am no more in the world but these are in the world and I come to thee Holy Father keep through thine own name Those whom thou has given me that they may be one as we are he said while I was with them in the world I kept them in my thy name those that thou gave us me I have kept think about that for a minute I know I'm hard to listen to tonight it hurts my ears too but oh my I have kept them through thine own name oh isn't that a wonderful testimony I have kept them he says and none of them is lost but the son of perdition that the scripture might be fulfilled now that's under your feet you don't have to worry about it and I'll say this why is why waste your time looking at everything on the internet and and looking at all these others see people just looking around at all the different theologies that are out there and stuff why waste your time with it I don't say you can be deceived by it I say why wasted your time doing it the scene is already entered into the womb and it's produced fruit in your life why would you why would you waste your time looking at all this other stuff the scripture the scripture has been fulfilled and you have been found to be the ones who cannot be deceived so now that is under his feet now watch the second thing let's look at back at Revelation 13 again Revelation 13 verse 11. he said I'll beheld another Beast coming up out of the Earth and he had two horns like a lamb and he spake as a dragon and he exercised this all I can't say that word he exercised all the power of the first Beast before him and causeth the Earth and then which dwell therein to worship the first Beast whose deadly wound was healed now this second beast comes up and the people perhaps thinking that they're worshiping something else but they're actually worshiping the first Beast they're actually worshiping a Roman Catholic system do you realize where we live right the people who worship this culture this American culture are actually worshiping the same Beast that was that come up out of the sea the same one or the same it's the same it's the same devil behind it now watch but it's it's a power the Beast is a power now he he exercised the power and he does great wonders verse 13 so that he make his fire come down from heaven on the earth in the side of men and deceiveth them that dwell on the Earth by the means of those Miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the Beast saying to them that dwell on the earth that they should make an image to the Beast which had the wound by a sword and did live so instead of worshiping the Beast they worship the image a Protestant denomination are you still with me now right and he said and he had power to give life unto the image of the Beast that the image of the Beast should both speak and caused it as many as would not worship the image of the Beast should be killed and he calls with all both small and great rich and poor free and bond to receive a mark in their right hand or in their foreheads that no man might buy or sell save he that had the Mark or the name of the Beast or the number of his name he said here is wisdom let him that hath understanding count the number of the Beast for it is the number of a man and his number is 603 score and six now watch brother Branham takes this 13. how many knows that brother Branham types the beasts to the or the America to the number 13. right he said it's in the 13th chapter of Revelations and he said it's a woman so he said 13 was was the 13th chapter of Revelation and it's a woman and it's America right so brother Brown types that to the culture there's more going on than what we realize right there's more going on than what we realize there there's a culture that we live in a world order which we call the cosmos which is the order of things the way things are done in the world there's a reason why we don't do things just because the world does them right because there's a world order there is a cosmos that that works and we have to work within that but we're not of that so now watch brother random talks about it he said now he said TV programs he said oh make female Flesh and Blood said they're not Gods they're not goddess but it sets America in exactly order to fulfill the scripture he said America's number is 13. America's Shrine is a woman always it's on her money it's on everything he said now it certainly brings him to a time that excuse me we're going to have an American goddess two not too far away he said you can see the handwriting on the wall he said look out on the street start downtown and just see it's a display of women how did they make themselves with clothes on that honest-to-goodness a woman not to be ashamed to stand in her dressing room like that amen he said walking out upon the street so tight little bitty clothes on out on these bathing beats just with these little he said bikinis or whatever they call it on such things as that and not knowing that in them is a spirit of evil when many of them singing choirs that's what Jesus said would take place but in them is a spirit of evil today they were these yoga pants in public and you think about it it don't make sense it's insanity public nudity we don't believe in public nudity right especially on somebody old enough to know better but now it's a spirit of evil on the age right and so now brother Brandon again he said so remember Jesus said as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be at the coming of the son of man we see everybody will agree the world is in a Sodom condition he said I picked up a Los Angeles paper here not long ago and I think it's homosexuals on the increase of 20 or 30 percent in Los Angeles each year increasing that much he said oh it's horrible and our government and everywhere everything just become a pervert he said that have we seen the Fulfillment of that well we've got a people in a high up in the government that uh 65 year old uh man that dresses like a woman and what's weird is it where's the dress and the women won't wear dresses now and so it says brother said the homosexuals on the increase in the government everywhere just become a pervert the whole thing the whole system church and everything else is perverted it's in a perverted age I want you to understand what you have authority over in this age right you don't have to be ruled by that first John 2 15 says love not the world neither the things are in the world that's the the cosmos the way the world does things the world order they do things a certain way we are not to be ruled by that just because everybody else does something doesn't go to church don't mean we have to not go to church just because everybody else lets their kids dress a certain way or dresses themselves a certain way don't mean we have to we are not bound by that we have we have come under the influence of the mighty angel of the word in our day nation is ruled by feminism you see that today I think I I don't have to repeat even of what a prophet said to say that you can see that just by looking out there it's ruled by feminism it's become so far now until it's turned in on itself towards feminism of men pretending to be women which doesn't make any sense it's women who want to be men and men who want to be women and it's not just a few places it's everywhere it's a power there's a power out there that's causing this you understand that it's it's not a little thing why in the world would sane people even worldly people why would you think they would do that why would they give in to that it's a power it's a power and it'll eventually take over completely now watch um brother Branham in the 20s and 30s he saw the flapper movement raise up and he said it one time he got up and showed his church he said this is the god of America the goddess of America and he preached as a sermon later on he calls it painted face Jezebel now he'd have to call it painted face Ahab it's a ridiculous age Church aren't you glad you got power over that we were and just being real with you tonight we were excited when Disney plus come out a few years ago because we thought well all the old cartoons would be on there and stuff we watched we were a kid we thought that'd be good that's not what it is exactly at least that's not only what it is we thought it'd be a source of clean cartoons almost you know what there was a their uh president of Disney uh was somebody by the name of Carrie Burke a couple years ago and she made a statement she said their goal was to have 50 of their characters to be lgbtq 50 percent was their stated goal as a company it's why would you do that 50 of the people aren't that way but they will be if they keep it up gifts shows that we let our kids watch uh when or maybe we watched when we were kids and they revive them you know and they come up in DuckTales and stuff like that Transformers got homosexuality on it I saw the other day where a famous Hollywood actress she come out and said all my children are queer wonder what the odds of that are I don't mean to be be harsh today but but we need to know what time we're living in this is the darkness that's out there every corporation is bowed down to it you're about to have pride month I get so sick of the media during this time of year because they spend a whole month celebrating perversion yeah celebrating an Abomination and every group I saw or even Ford put out an ad with two trucks and I made one of the trucks a pride truck nonsense and it's everywhere you try to boycotting this and you know I've seen a bunch of Christians come out and boycott that beer that that certain beer that had a had a trans person that first spokesman and I thought you know what that's strange Christians shouldn't be drinking in the first place wouldn't do my us much good the boy caught it but every political party all of them have bowed down to it every denomination is bowed down to it every organization oh there's a few that on the friends just try to fight it but it's overwhelming but you don't why don't you because you've heard a voice from heaven Hallelujah aren't you glad for the message of the hour You Heard a Voice from heaven come out have you heard that voice today come out of her my people come on be not partake of reflection it doesn't mean go off in the woods somewhere in the wilderness and make yourself scarce from the world although that sounds like a good idea sometimes but that's not what he's talking about come out in your thinking come out in the way you do things come out of your Association come out and be separate they seem like they have everything going their way it may seem like they're winning all the battles but you have authority by the word that stuff doesn't have to come in your home right yes sir it doesn't have to come it doesn't have we'll follow the word it doesn't have to come in our churches it doesn't have to we have authority by the word yeah yeah we know this is the time when time shall be no more there's no more delay space of time that he comes in It's Time it's time to recognize what hour we're living in he heard a voice from Heaven saying come out there will be an overcomer in this age let me believe that today somebody's got to do it right somebody's got to preach it somebody's got to live it don't you want to be one that lives it don't you be one want to be one if you're a preacher you'll preach it you said but if you're if you're not a preacher live your sermon amen let you be not partaker of her plagues he said I heard another voice from Heaven come out from her my people be an upper taker of her plagues there will be an overcomer the Bible says you are of God Little Children You are of God your children of the day he said have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world you're not helpless aren't you glad for that we're not victims we're not just Sitting Waiting on the World to come crashing down around us we've been given Authority the world may come crashing down but it will not come nigh our dwelling are you hearing me today Jericho is going to come crashing down but it will not crash down on you the world's gone crazy but you don't have to you've heard a voice from heaven you're not helpless you've been given Authority authority over the end time you'd be surprised and shocked how that thinking filters its way infiltrates anything into message circles the culture of this day you get young people that'll stream a certain sermon at a certain time and yet they're serving the devil yeah and have perversion everything else in their life but they think they're okay and and it's just it's just the spirit of the age But You Heard a Voice from heaven people go to church and shout and dance and everything else but I want to know that you overcome the spirit of the age that's what we need Church well it's good to have shouting and dancing but we need to know that there's an overcomer somewhere there's a young person somewhere who overcomes there's an elder somewhere that overcomes you're not helpless Authority Daniel 11 says such as do weekly against the Covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries but the people that do know their God shall be strong and do exploits if you go back to the original I preached on that one time if you go back in the original that word exploits is actually in italics in the King James version because it actually said they will be strong and they will do what that means is that they will actually perform what they were intended to perform they'll be a husband they'll be a wife they'll be a preacher there'll be somebody who's what God called him to be they will be strong and they will do the things and nobody thought they could do I want you to notice something to have five more minutes and then we'll close there's two places in Revelation that talk about a sea of glass if you ever notice that Revelation chapter 4 and verse 6. it said before the throne there was a sea of glass like under Crystal in in other words completely transparent oh I love that in the midst of the throne and round about The Throne are four beasts full of eyes before and behind but the brand of like exists to the the Brazen sea in the temple it was a brass sea and it was a place of judgment brass spoke of judgment he made a brass serpent the sin was the sign of sin already judged I'm skipping ahead here on on the quotes he said brass represented Divine judgment even Elijah looked at the sky and said the sky looks like brass Divine judgment Upon A rejected Nation he said and now we're at the labor and you notice this in Revelation chapter 4 the slaver these people who were standing there oh my this slaver was empty and was as clear as Crystal why this church had already been redeemed somebody overcomes in this age there was a sea of glass they were standing on that was clean Hallelujah your brother he said brother man you don't know what I've done in the past but the sea of glass that you're standing on when you come under the influence of this Mighty Angel when you hear the voice of predestination the sea of glass is completely clean Lord of God now look there's another see blast but look but look at this one real quick but the Miranda says we're at the labor as clear as Crystal church have been redeemed he says this invisible Union you're standing completely you never sinned at the first place God don't even know nothing it's in the sea of forgetfulness you never did do it you were accused of it by the accuser but really from the beginning you were predestinator to be a son and daughter of God you're standing there washed your old book of divorcement is put away it's dead absolutely out of existence even in the mind of God crystal clear haven't you ever wanted to be like that with God you are in this hour you're an overcomer by the blood of the Lamb look Revelation 15 2 another sea of glass I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire and then the god in the victory over the Beast over its image over his Mark over the number of his name stand on the sea of glass having the hearts of God but Branham taught us this was the this was the foolish virgin or the church that goes to the tribulation brother Brandon says how do we come he said we got to come this Gentile Church to this word sea of glass water of the word he said listen to this we have to recognize the word the way it's written foreign you realize you can't be purged by a seed of discrepancy but you've got to recognize the word the way it's written and come to it he said even those even those foolish virgin have to recognize the word and come to it God recognize the word the way it's written not how you can twist it not how I can twist it to make it fit our own theology but the way it's written yeah yeah then the sacrifice is received and filled with the holy ghost from the inside shining through the light of that age and and in Revelation 15 3 said they sing a song of Moses the servant of God the song of the lamb saying great and marvelous how thy Works Lord God Almighty just endure thy ways Thou King of saints who shall not fear thee O Lord and glorify thy name for thou only aren't holy for all nations shall come and worship before thee for thy judgments are made manifest brother Brandon said they were Washed by the same Waters that you're being washed by now hearing the word you don't realize what it means to sit in the house of God and hear the word of God you don't realize what it means to get into the message of the hour when you hear the word you're being Washed by the Water of the word you're being washed now amen they were Washed by the same Waters that you're being washed by now hearing the word and the faith and power of Jesus Christ being the almighty he said it's the whole Revelation at the beginning the whole thing's wrapped up for the revelation of who Jesus Christ is that's why they said who shall not fear thee and glorify thy name amen now watch you are the overcomer how did you overcome well the Bible says by two things by the blood of the Lamb aren't you glad for the blood of the Lamb and the word of your testimony you're going to have a testimony you're going to have a testimony he's not going to leave you just with the blood of the lamb but you're going to have a testimony what's it going to be it's going to be I was an overcomer I was an overcomer my feet came over pornography My Feet stepped on stepped on the depression my feet stepped on sicknesses my feet overcame old age them one of these days sister Karen one of these days these bodies will be changed and we're gonna say my feet walked on all of these things why because I am the body of Jesus Christ I am Mrs Jesus Christ aren't you excited about that today doesn't that mean something to you doesn't that do something to your heart when you say I am the Bride of Jesus Christ I am Mrs Jesus Christ I overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of Our Testimony Hallelujah by the word of my testimony I overcame my testimony yeah I love they love not their lives unto the death but the prayer until the musicians go ahead and come oh I wish I'd have had voice but God knows he makes every service just what it ought to be you got to stand in the water of the word to be washed and that what brother Branham tells us he said how are you going to be washed if you won't stand in the water of the word huh it's hard sometimes to come to church I know it is it's hard to drag your kids that you're being washed you've been washed by the water of the word so all the old ideas are going away all the old sins all the things of the past are all being washed away and as you are washed you're standing there with all things under your feet and you look down there's nothing there anymore just a sea of crystal God you say when brother Ben now those tribulation Saints have to stand on a sea of glass mingled with fire then because they have to be judged but you and I are judged here by the supreme authority by the wigged one who came down and you are saved now you are an overcomer now you stand now on a sea of glass at the opening of the seals at the word cut becoming flesh you stand on a sea of glass nothing there oh God I say thank you for making me your pride thank you for making me your child I'm standing there spotless Guiltless as though I never did it in the first place standing on the sea of glass with nothing between me and God you bow your head with me for just a moment you got to stand in the water of the word to be washed like that nothing else will do don't ever accept anything but the word of God it's the only thing that'll wash you it's the only thing that can change your life just acknowledge that it's true you're still a human being stand on a sea of glass you don't stand on a sea of glass mingled with fire because you've accepted the Judgment of God in your life you've been judged here so you don't have to be over there aren't you glad for that today holy thank you Lord Heavenly Father Lord we don't want anything but your word or we've overcome the the apostate religion we've overcome the culture of this age Cosmos
