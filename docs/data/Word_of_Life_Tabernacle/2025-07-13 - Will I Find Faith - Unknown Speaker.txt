Uh just as just just if you can if you can't, then we'll put them in storage and and we hope you can find them again. But, uh but if you can just take anything that that you want to take with you because we have to rearrange it to fit people in here and so it'd be very different uh for the meetings. So, uh we are looking forward to a good time in the meetings, aren't we? &gt;&gt; Amen. There's no service this evening. Uh if you want to stay and offer your services for help uh taking out seats, cleaning out the fellowship hall and all that, we will feed you dinner or you if you brought your own lunch, stay, eat with us if you want to.

I believe if we just be in prayer for the meetings, I believe God can really do some good things for us. But, if you have a friend or a loved one that don't go to church or don't know the Lord, maybe it'd be a good time to bring them during the meetings. Amen. Let's sing this. My hope is in the Lord.

What is that? Redemption. You can stand today and worship and say I am redeemed. If anybody asks me just what I am, I am redeemed. Hallelujah. Oh, thank the Lord. Amen. Aren't you glad for his presence this morning? It good to see each one of you, Sister Amber. My goodness, you look just like your mom. And my goodness, it's been a while since I've preached and Sister Amber was in the audience. I remember preaching to her 20 years ago when we were both a lot younger and and uh we sure appreciate having you today. God bless you each one for being here. Let's bow our heads together. Heavenly Father, oh, we're so thankful to be your children this morning, Lord. So thankful for that keeping power, Lord. Though we Lord, though we were lost in the pawn shop, yet you brought us out, Lord. You We were in your hand. We're so thankful for that. We belong to you. I pray, God, that you'd just move this morning in a mighty way, Lord. May there not be one person leave here, Lord, in the same condition that they came in, but may they leave better, Lord. Myself as well, Lord. I I want to I want to be better. I want to do more. I want to have more fervor, Lord. More desire, oh God. Pray you'd grant it today. More revelation of your word. Pray that you'd move now. Lord, if there's any sick among us, I pray you'd heal those that are sick. Lord, touch everybody, every heart. We pray in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen. I bless you this morning. Amen. Isn't God good to us? &gt;&gt; Luke chapter 18 and verse one. I want to say thank you in advance for all the hard work uh to get ready for the meetings and then the meetings themselves that y'all are the best folks in the world at doing those things. And so we thank you for that. And we just believe the Lord's going to bless us mightily in the meetings and we thank you for for being here for that and for being here today. Luke chapter 18 and verse one, he spake a parable unto them to this end that men ought always to pray and not to faint, saying, there was in a city a judge which feared not God, neither regarded man. And there was a widow in that city, and she came unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary. and he would not for a while. But afterward he said within himself, "Though I fear not God, nor regard man, yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming, she weary me." And the Lord said, "Hear what the unjust judge saith. And shall not God avenge his own elect who cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them? I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth." I want to take that for a text this morning. Will I find faith? God bless you as you have your seats this morning. Brother Brandham picks up uh on that in a sermon titled the anointed ones at the end time and he he says here's the question if you follow in that line in this hour he said will it be finished will I find the faith will Malachi 4 be fulfilled in this time restore the faith of the children back to the faith of the fathers the original the word notice he says the faith of the children. Let's read Malachi 4 and verse 5. He said, "Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord. And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse." He He says, "Turn the heart." Brother Brandham says, "Turn the faith." The heart the faith. And we know to turn back is to restore. If you would to go back to an original condition is literally to restore. And but brother Brandon puts the word faith in there. Again, he does that all through the message, all through his ministry. He said the messenger of this age was to come in the power of Elias. He said that he was to restore the faith of the children back to the fathers. Bring the Pentecostal remnant that's left back to the true apostolic faith. The Pentecostal remnant that's left back to the true apostolic faith. Now, brother Random is is taking this from Jude 3 where Jude says, "Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you the common salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints." So, he's telling him there is a faith that was once delivered to the saints. He said, "I want you to contend for that." And he says, so brother Brandham ties that to Malachi 4. He said he will restore the faith back that was lost. Now Malachi 4 is not a restoration of doctrine to the head. &gt;&gt; It is not a restoration of doctrine to the head. And I think that's what we've made it many times. We've made it an intellectual thing that well if I understand it. I want to tell you this morning. You may not understand everything about the message. You may not understand everything how to put it all together. But I tell you this this morning, if you believe it, it'll have the same benefit as if you completely understood it. And I believe the bride of Christ can understand, but yet those things you don't understand yet will be revealed to you because of faith. If you don't believe, it doesn't matter how much you know, you will never accept it. But if you can believe, then understanding can come to you. Now Malachi 4 again, it's not a restoration of doctrine to the head. It's not it's not a if that was the case, he would have just sent a theologian. If all he wanted was doctrine restored, he would have sent a theologian. If all he wanted was a was a uh restoration of understanding, he would have sent a wellspoken man. But he sent a Kentucky hillbilly. He sent somebody who who had visions and saw miracles and things happened in his ministry. What for? It was a restoration not of the head, but of the heart. And &gt;&gt; he had to get our attention by the sign so we could be led to the word. &gt;&gt; So, brother Rand said, "This messenger in Malachi 4 and Revelation 10:7 is going to do two things. This is very important. I've read this to you many times, but I want us to understand it." Sometimes I feel like a broken record up here, but but it it it matters. &gt;&gt; This is very important to our salvation, to what we believe. He said according to Malachi 4, he will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers. Two, he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelation 10, which are the revelations contained in the seven seals. So, we're not looking for seven thunders to come. Those revelations have been revealed to us. He said, "It will be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn the hearts of the children to the Pentecostal fathers." &gt;&gt; So it will restore the faith &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; of the children. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Till you could believe. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So the signs of his presence as we talked about Wednesday night, it brought us to our attention. The first poll, the second poll brought our attention to the third pole, right? &gt;&gt; Which then they they increased our faith to believe the word which was the presence of God itself. So the signs of his presence caused us to believe the presence of God itself that it was here. Now the angel taught brother Brandham remember the third pole uh uh vision that he had. He had a vision of catching fish which I like. I I think that's pretty good vision right there. just the fact that he was catching fish. And so the vision was that he would uh he would uh he would fish and he said the first pull he said it it it didn't hardly pull up any kind of fish at all. It was just so small. The second pole, but brother Brandham tried to explain it. He said, "Don't do that." He got his line all tangled up. He said, "But on the third pole," he said, "That's where you catch your rainbow trout. That's where you catch your big fish is on the third pole." So the angel told him, "Don't set the hook &gt;&gt; until the third pole." All right. &gt;&gt; In the first poll, he said, "Show the lure." &gt;&gt; The second pole, show the lure. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. In the third pole, set the hook. &gt;&gt; The sign attracted my attention. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. I My attention was attracted by the sign of the hand. My attention was attracted by the by the revealing of the secrets of the heart. But it was the word that set the hook in me. The word is what caught me. The word is what made it where I can't turn back. where I can listen. I was not I am not the hook is not I'm not hooked by just miracles. I'm not just hooked by those things, but I'm hooked by the word itself. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Don't set the hook until the third pull. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; The B says this. He said many people will sponsor a healing meeting. Many will come to a healing meeting through a song festival. But when it comes to a poor lost soul to get saved, there's not many people interested in that. &gt;&gt; He said, but that's the main thing. divine healing and seeing festivals and so forth. He said, as brother Bossworth used to say, it's the bait on the hook. You show the fish the bait, not the hook, &gt;&gt; right? And that's just the thing to get the people to listen a while &gt;&gt; until you can really present to them your message. &gt;&gt; God has did that. Listen, in every age, through every age, there's always been a healing campaign. And if it's a genuine healing campaign, behind the campaign always is a message. There never is a sign given just for a sign. It's forerunning a message. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm glad that God still uses bait on the hook. &gt;&gt; I want you to understand, we still don't fish &gt;&gt; with a hook and no bait. &gt;&gt; When we fish, we still have bait on the hook. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham never stopped fishing with bait, if we could put it like that. He always continued to have miracles and signs and wonders in his ministry even during the opening of the word. Now why does brother Brandham do that? Because there are still people who need to be attracted that way. In fact ourselves many times just in our flesh and in our spirit we we need to be our our attention to be caught. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Right. So we can receive the word. &gt;&gt; Why do we have a song service the way we do and we try to make it where the presence of the Lord is here with us? Why do we want to come together in in the atmosphere of faith? Because we want our attention to be caught &gt;&gt; so we can hear the word. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Everything else has got our attention, but the bait catches our attention so we can hear the word. Are you with me so far? &gt;&gt; So, so there has to be a you know, and it had to come at the third pole. You remember if you go listen to perfect faith, Brandon talks about how Jesus had perfect faith because he knew who he was. Yeah, &gt;&gt; he had confidence in who he was, &gt;&gt; right? That he was God in flesh, &gt;&gt; he said he had confidence in what the word says he was, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And he said you can have confidence in what the word says you are. &gt;&gt; What does the word say? You are a believer. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; He said, "And these signs shall follow them that believe." &gt;&gt; So you can have confidence in what the word says you are. But why did we need the third pole to have this uh perfect faith? Why did we need that? Why are those two things tied together? Why did we need the message of Malachi 4 to be restored back to faith? We needed it. Oh my. Because in order to come to perfect faith, we had to have a word that would bring us to that. There had to be something. And we were attracted. We were brought in. But there had to be a word that would restore our hearts back to make us recognize who we are. &gt;&gt; Oh my. I had to recognize I was not the son of John and Sharon Puit. But brother said, I'm not the son of Charles and Ella Brandom. I'm a son of God. I come from God. Why did he preach to us election and predestination? All of these things, the seed of God, the gene of God, because we had to know who we are. &gt;&gt; And when with this message, we ought to have more faith than we've ever had. There shouldn't be less faith today than there was in by gone days. We should have more faith because it tells us who we are. And this is the only way you can have perfect faith is when you have confidence in who you are. &gt;&gt; People aren't attracted by a naked hook. I remember some years ago, you might if you're fishing with just the hook, you might catch the wrong kind of fish. &gt;&gt; We were might catch an old shoe out there. I was in Bass Pro years ago and they had a fishing exhibition. They had a great big tank in there and and this guy's up there. He said, "I want to show you something." He said, "These hooks will catch more fish than other hooks." So, he had red hooks and boy, he sold me because, you know, I've used red hooks for years because that guy took a red hook, he took a regular hook and put it down there and them little fish just swam around. But when he put the red hook down there, boy, they they they were attracted to it and they bit that red hook with nothing on it. Thought, well, that's interesting. But they were all bluegill. And I found out that if you want small fish, use a small bait &gt;&gt; and use a use you could use just a hook, right? There's spots where you can go. If you get a nest of bluegill, you can throw almost anything in there and catch one. Some of you fishermanmen know that's right. &gt;&gt; But if you want a trophy fish, &gt;&gt; you got to use bait that'll catch it. &gt;&gt; If you go up to this river, I've never caught a walleye on the Spring River because I've never fished for one. I've always fished for trout and I have a good time catching trout, but there's big walleye in that river that I've never caught because I didn't have the appropriate bait to catch it. &gt;&gt; You still can't catch the elect without the bait. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; And you may catch other things, but you got to fish for what you're looking for. If you want believers, you got to fish with something positive. You got to have something to attract believers on the hook or or the believer's never going to bite. &gt;&gt; Right? I if you go up here and fish, we fish for rainbow. I'm getting way too in the weeds on fishing because I haven't been fishing in a while. But I if you go up here and fish for rainbow trout, you won't catch very many brown trout. You got to change your bait and catch the kind of fish that you're looking for. Are you with me now? If you go fishing for bluegill, you need to change your bait to catch largemouth bass. Listen, in order to catch the elect, there had to be a a bait that would attract the elect &gt;&gt; because there's a capacity in the elect to believe that these signs are true, that they're they're a reality to us. &gt;&gt; We believe in a cloud. We believe in a pillar of fire. We believe in healing. We believe in the secrets of men's hearts being revealed. There's something inside of us to believe. We may not understand it all. We may not be able to explain it all, but there's something in our hearts. We believe. How many can say that this morning? I'm a believer. I believe God's word is true. I believe if he said I can be healed, I can be healed. If he said my children are saved, that they are saved. &gt;&gt; Why? Because I'm a believer. &gt;&gt; I can't explain to you why, but I'm a believer. Why do I believe it's we're going to make it? Why do I believe we're going in a rapture? Because I'm a believer. &gt;&gt; God's word said so. So now, so I have to have a revelation. The third poll brings to me a revelation that I'm a believer. I'm a son of God. And then I can then I can go on into perfect faith. Now we've been caught. &gt;&gt; Right. I think what all of us I believe this message of the hour, we can say that I've been caught. &gt;&gt; I can feast on the third pole. I don't just need the bait. I I I've got I've been caught. I've been taken into the boat onto the shore. But the bait still attracts us. I know a lot of people say, "Well, I don't need bait no more. I don't need to see nothing. &gt;&gt; I just believe. Okay. &gt;&gt; If that was true, you'd never ask for prayer. &gt;&gt; Right? Brother Brandham said if you had perfect faith, you'd never have to come in a prayer line. &gt;&gt; Right? Because you just you just believe where you're at. &gt;&gt; But Brother Brandham himself still come had prayer lines and went through them. That's &gt;&gt; right. Why? Because we're human, &gt;&gt; right? But people say, "Well, I've been caught. I I believe the message. And in this maturity of where we are, we don't really need emotion anymore. We don't really need good services. We don't really need the power of God. We don't really need those things. What about your children? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; How are they going to be caught? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So, I don't need that. You may not. &gt;&gt; I don't need to cry. I don't need I've already settled things with God and What about your children? I believe we all still need it. &gt;&gt; But what about your children? What about the young people? How's the next generation going to come along? &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; How's it going to happen? It's got to be they've got to be attracted to the message the same way you were attracted to the message. &gt;&gt; There's got to be a reality in their lives. There's got they got to see something real. Listen, our young people are not going to not going to remain in the message of the hour and be filled with the Holy Ghost because we tell some story of something that happened a hundred years ago and what our forefathers taught. But there's got to be a living reality of the unfailing presence of God right here in our lives. Something that'll grab a hold of us, Jaden. Something that'll grab a hold of us. Something that'll move us. Some that'll make us different because we still struggle. Listen to me. If you say, "Well, we don't need preaching no more." I tell you who does need preaching. People that are struggling with pornography. People that are struggling with with a w with with lust, people that are struggling with with ungodliness in their life, people that are struggling with temper, people that are strugging. They need the gospel. They need the power of God. They need the presence of God because they're human beings &gt;&gt; because of what we were. But God knew what kind of bait it would take to attract the fish to the place where we could receive the word in its fullness. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. Well, you don't ever do need to do youth meetings. You don't need to do anything. You don't need no no program for the youth. No Sunday school. We'll just we'll just leave them alone. Let them become what they are. We got a perfect word now. They'll become something. &gt;&gt; Will see the third pole is not a doctrine. It's faith. &gt;&gt; It's a belief. &gt;&gt; It's believing something. It's not knowing something. It's believing something. Brother Brandham had a prayer line, the sermon, perfect faith, and he said this at at the close of it, he said, "This is coming into that third pole." A prayer line. &gt;&gt; This is coming into that third pull. &gt;&gt; I'm believing it. He said, "Now, I want to ask you a sincere question. You that pass through the prayer line, can you actually believe and feel now?" &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. that there's something happened in you since you've had hands laid on you. Raise your hand. He said if that's if you believe it, he said, then raise your hand. They've come through the prayer line, had hands laid on just like we do now. &gt;&gt; Just like you would if you come up for prayer today or when we have a prayer line in the meetings like the brothers would pray for you just like where did we learn to do that? We learned from a prophet, &gt;&gt; right? To lay hands on the sick and form a line and do those things. We learned that from a prophet. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And so he said, "If you've had the hands laid on you, raise your hand." He said, "There it is. This is what we've waited for." &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; He said, "Now this is not This is just starting to bloom now." He said, "I did this for a purpose. I'm working out something." See, he said, "It's taking this charge of faith and going right back to begin and come in." He said, "See, to kind of raise faith in a bracket where you've never noticed it that way before." So on our way on the journey to perfection of faith, on our journey to perfection of maturity, on our journey to a body change, we we'll still have prayer lives. We'll still have church. We'll still we'll still worship God. We'll still love God. Why? Because our faith needs to be increased. It needs to be raised to a point where one morning we're going to see a change in our bodies. &gt;&gt; See our loved ones begin to come in. &gt;&gt; We still need it. And now, brother Brandston, it's just starting to bloom. He said, "Not a faith, but a perfect faith. Build it up in here." And watch a perfect God with a perfect heart &gt;&gt; keep a perfect promise &gt;&gt; by his perfect word, which I love the way the prophet put it. He said, "Which is sharper than a two-edged sword and a discerner of the thoughts of the heart." What we're coming now to the perfection because the people has to come to this. &gt;&gt; Yes. to what? To going through a prayer line and just believing. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And in that sermon, Brother Brandham said, he said, he said, if you come through the prayer line, he said, if you had perfect faith, when you come through, that hands were laid on you. He said, when you leave, you leave shouting and rejoicing because you know that God did something. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; And not everybody's loud, but everybody's can rejoice and thank God for what they receive. And so, what he's doing, what is he doing? He's showing us that perfect faith wasn't going to be some esoteric some kind of a a thing out there that was unreachable. But he's saying well he's saying there there is perfect faith that can operate even during a prayer line. Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Even during a prayer line because the people can come have hands laid on them and believe. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If you don't believe the hands are not magical. &gt;&gt; Old hands and young hands. Brother Brandham called it dirty hands. Come on. &gt;&gt; That's what he called his own hands. When he laid them on the people, he said, "My own dirty hands." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Human hands, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Flesh hands on the people. There's nothing in the hands. &gt;&gt; But what is the power of it? The power of it is God said they'll lay hands on the sick and they shall recover. And when people believe that and walk through prayer line, what are they? They're healed. Why? Because of their faith in it. They believe it. We're just doing what God said to do. We're not following what somebody else said to do. We're doing what God told us to do. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; So, I think people, you know, you're looking for some kind of say, "Well, there's something miraculous about the prayer line itself." Well, it's very natural. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. Ordinary men. &gt;&gt; Natural people. Yes, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; Just very natural. Laying hands. See, what what good would that do? What good does it do to take communion? Wash your feet. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Right. At some point, we can spiritualize all of that. But he told us to do it. &gt;&gt; Why did he tell us to do it? Because it's something we can put our faith in. He knew we we were human beings. &gt;&gt; We need something we can put our hands on. Something we put our faith in. &gt;&gt; As the little boy said, we need a God with skin on him. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; So, Brother Brandon said, "We come into that perfect raptured faith." He said, "That's what's holding it away right now is waiting for that church to come into that perfect raptured faith looking for it." You say, "Well, I got perfect raptured faith." Why aren't you raptured? Come on. &gt;&gt; Because when we come to that, we'll be raptured. &gt;&gt; But the message is bringing us to that. &gt;&gt; He said, "It means a lot of shaving down for me. It makes a lot for you, but together means a lot for you. But together, we'll make it by the grace of God." How many believe that today? &gt;&gt; There'll be a lot of shaving down, a lot of unbelief that's got to be stripped away. But let me stand there in faith and believe. Lord, I believe your word is true. I believe my children will be saved. I believe things are going to be okay. Yes. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon said, "I want to get you built up now." It's another sermon, spiritual food in due season. He said, "I want to get you built up now in the holy oracles of God in thee." Faith, the faith of this hour, &gt;&gt; the faith. It's going to take more faith than ever was in any age. &gt;&gt; For this has to be rapturing faith be taken up. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He said, "So, we want you to believe tonight in all." Someone say, "All &gt;&gt; all that you have seen." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Heard the word that you've heard preached. the signs and wonders that you've seen done. What are we talking about? Faith is increased. Faith becomes by hearing the word. Faith is increased by signs and wonders. What is it? Faith. We want you to believe in all. We want you to believe in the what you've heard. We want you to believe what you've seen. We want you to accumulate all that together in your heart &gt;&gt; and consider it whether if that be God or not. &gt;&gt; And when you decide that it's God, when you proclaim it, oh that's the Lord. Listen, then God can move for you &gt;&gt; in the same way. When you look in the scripture and say here, maybe you have a a a problem in some way in your body. You look at the scripture and see where God healed somebody like that. You can look at that and say, "I believe that was God that did it." And when you believe, your faith can be quickened for your own healing. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Oh, it works just that way in the church. When you see somebody else healed, it gives you faith to believe. That testimony gives you faith to believe. I believe I can be healed. I can believe I can be saved. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? Faith is the foundation of everything. &gt;&gt; Yes. Nothing works &gt;&gt; without it. &gt;&gt; Very good. &gt;&gt; You got to believe. &gt;&gt; And perfect faith doesn't come by intellectualism. Neither does it come by emotionalism. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Not by workup, but by the message. &gt;&gt; The question is, will I find faith? &gt;&gt; See, the Pentecostals had faith. And you might say, "Well, brother Ben, the Pentecostals had faith." Sure they did. But they didn't have mustard seed faith. &gt;&gt; Remember the apostles said to the Lord, "Increase our faith." Luke 17:5, the Lord said, "If you had faith as a grain of mustard seed, &gt;&gt; come on." &gt;&gt; You might say, "This sack of my tree, be thou plucked up by the root, be thou planted in the sea, and it should obey you, &gt;&gt; church, I don't think we recognize what happened in our day." &gt;&gt; Look, he said, "If you had mustard seed faith, identifies that as pure faith, it can't be mixed." &gt;&gt; If you had a pure word producing a pure faith, &gt;&gt; are you with me now? &gt;&gt; Right. But what happened in our day was a restoration of the purity of the word. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And what happened during that time? Brother Brandham spoke &gt;&gt; to the psychamine tree, &gt;&gt; if you will, to the little fish, &gt;&gt; right? But why did he do that? Why tell about a little fish being restored to life? &gt;&gt; What's the point of that? It's showing us that the mustard seed faith was back. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Come on. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. See, if you had mustard seed faith, the original restored unmixed faith, the spoken word would be in operation. And so God showed us in operation. Now, what happened in our day? God identified the third pole as the spoken word and the open book. Opening of the book was the manifestation of sons back to an Eden condition where Adam could speak to the tree and tell it to move and it would move, &gt;&gt; right? He could speak and children would come. He could speak and all those things would happen. But he fell and took uh the permissive will of God, &gt;&gt; right? Went out with his wife to save his wife &gt;&gt; and and that way the the attributes of God could be expressed. But yet we're coming back. So what is this message? It's the restoration of the manifestation of sons back to an Eden condition. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; So you know, I know people would will hear that and I know this is heavy and deep this morning. So you just grab a hold of what you can. Again, it's not important so much what we understand, but what we believe, &gt;&gt; right? But but if you can understand this morning that the we're we're the this message took us back to that and then your next question might be well I spoke to my refrigerator and it didn't open. There was no more milk there than it was before. What happened? Right? You might say well I you know I went down I know people who kind of took this and they said well I'll just start speaking to things. They were always talking about you know brother Brandon had one fish and they had 15 you know and and stuff like that. Now, I'm not mocking that God could do that. We believe in the spoken word, but the word was manifested in that way for a reason, &gt;&gt; right? It wasn't just random, &gt;&gt; but it was done for a reason. Why aren't we just speaking everything in our lives? &gt;&gt; We don't have the character yet &gt;&gt; to handle that. &gt;&gt; But there is something that we'll speak. &gt;&gt; I hope you're hearing me now. &gt;&gt; I want to get into this and I don't know if I'll have time to finish this today. If I don't, I'll pick it up after the meetings. But so we aren't speaking everything. We're just speaking what we're inspired to speak. &gt;&gt; So brother Brandham has asked the question because somebody realized that hey brother Brandham was able to speak the word. You know this Christian life is a little bit hard. You know it's difficult to be an overcomer. But brother Brandham if you have the spoken word what if you could just speak us into a rapture condition. &gt;&gt; Right? They asked him that question. They said, "It seems entirely possible for you to speak the word and one would be completely and fully restored, placed entirely ready for the rapture and the resurrection, the son of man. This is so or is it not?" And you would do this if properly pressed upon, would you not? Right? So they said, "Well, is it true that you could do it?" Brother Random acknowledges, they reference Luke 21:36, "You escape all these things that should come to pass, stand before the son of man." They were they like, "Well, hey, there's an easy way, &gt;&gt; right? All right, brother Brandham could just speak and we could be ready for a rapture. No more praying. No more calling out to God. Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; Oh, church. &gt;&gt; People still think that. But but it's an overcoming, an individual overcoming in our lives. &gt;&gt; Right. But brother Brandham didn't discount it. In fact, he said that that's true. It's possible. Right. But then he explains it. He rephrases the question. &gt;&gt; Yeah. He says, not polishing up what you said, but making it a little clearer. He said, because of the spoken words and things like that, he said about all of you here witness to squirrels and all these other things that's been done. But did you notice that was sovereignly given? I never asked him, Lord, let me do this, speak these things in like that, do these things there. I never asked him that. He by his own divine will came to me and said, you go do this. &gt;&gt; He said, I wasn't asking one thing about it. Moses never asked to go down to Egypt, but it was God that sent him down to Egypt. &gt;&gt; So, Brother Brandham taught us that the spoken word operated by the inspiration of God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And he said it was when the people would say the right thing and then it would operate. &gt;&gt; But you remember all the spoken word that Brother Brandham spoke, the the different times that he spoke the word, every time it was God inspiring, maybe somebody would say the right thing and then a prophet would speak it, right? And then the person would be healed or the fish would be raised or the squirrels would be in their place. &gt;&gt; But then watch what happens now when it come to Hattie. Right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; There was a difference. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. It didn't operate the same way. &gt;&gt; Because now it was she said the right thing. Brother Brandham spoke it. But that wasn't the end of it. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandon said that's the first time it operated on a human being. in a human being was had he right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Why? Because it wasn't brother Brandham speaking her kids back. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Come on. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; He preached the message that made it possible. &gt;&gt; There was an atmosphere there that made it possible. It was a prophet of God standing there and said, "Speak what you will." &gt;&gt; Oh, I hope you're hearing me today. It wasn't a prophet of God standing there and saying, "Now, your sons are going to be he going to be saved or your sister's going to be healed." But what was it? It was her. Yeah, &gt;&gt; it was in the heart of Hattie right &gt;&gt; because he finally got somebody. Brother Br said it came from a poor widow woman's heart. &gt;&gt; God knowing that she'd asked the greatest thing could be done. Don't you realize what God's doing in this hour. The prophets already spoke the message. We've already said the right thing. Said we believe it. The prophet's already spoken. Now what are we waiting on? There's got to come an inspiration in us to ask for the right thing. Yes, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; Oh my. There has to be a bride who ask for the right thing. And so Jesus comes down and said, "Will I find faith?" &gt;&gt; Like Hattie Wright had. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; She was a widow. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So here's Luke 18. Jesus is coming down and he's telling the story of the unjust judge. Remember, it's an extreme example. Here's a widow. Here's an unjust judge. Here's a widow with no property rights, she her case is not valid in court, &gt;&gt; but because she just complains. &gt;&gt; She just keeps coming. &gt;&gt; Every Monday when he shows up to work, she's knocking on the door. &gt;&gt; If they had telephone back in, she'd be calling every five minutes. &gt;&gt; Judge, you need to do something about my situation. &gt;&gt; Come on. And so in Luke 18:6, they said, "The Lord said, "Hear what the unjust judge says." Listen, the judge, what did he say? He said, "She's I'm not going to give her this on the merits of her case, but because she keeps coming and asking." So, she didn't ask for the right thing necessarily, &gt;&gt; but it was just out of opportunity. It's the word that that's used in the scripture. In other words, it's just out of her coming over and over and over again. &gt;&gt; Right? So now think with me through this. He said, "And shall not God avenge." He said, "Hear what the unjust judge sayeth. Shall not God avenge his own elect which cry day and night unto him? Though he bear long with them?" &gt;&gt; He said, "I tell you, he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth." Now, what was she crying for? She was a widow crying for her rights as a widow. &gt;&gt; Yes. Right. &gt;&gt; Right. But she was still a widow. &gt;&gt; When the judge gave her the the request, she was still a widow. And so I think that might be a tight if you think about it like this of the rain falling on the just and the unjust. Like Jesus uses this extreme example that there's a widow who has no rights. Here's a judge who is not just &gt;&gt; and she's still got what she asked for. &gt;&gt; But you're not going you're not a widow going to an unjust judge. You're the bride going to the king. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, how much more &gt;&gt; would he avenge the elect or give them what they asked for? &gt;&gt; If they would ask, if they would cry. &gt;&gt; So, she would be basically given the right to glean, which was the widow's rights in that day, maybe to live on the property because that's all the potential that she had. She did not have the potential of redemption. No longer having the ability to bear children. perhaps an older woman. She didn't have the didn't have the ability to bear children or the potential to become maybe uh to to be redeemed and so she just got what she asked for. That still works even on the just and the unjust. Many times even a a sinner will ask for something and get it because they believe &gt;&gt; because they have faith. And Christians sometimes are because of condemnation they they don't believe like they should. And a sinner don't know any better than just to believe and they'll receive it. That's &gt;&gt; right. Right? So we that's why we pray for healing even for sinners. &gt;&gt; Right? But we pray that they would first be saved &gt;&gt; and come to Christ. But we do pray for healing for sinners. And God will heal a sinner. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Even in their sin, &gt;&gt; he absolutely will. &gt;&gt; And yet because it's based on faith. See, Matthew 7:7 tells us, "Ask and it shall be given you. Seek you shall find. Knock and it shall be open unto you. For everyone that askketh receiveth. He that seeketh findeth. To him that knockketh it shall be open. That's not limited to the elect, but it does work for the elect. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. Brother said they've never been able to scientifically find a better way for a baby to get what he wants besides crying for it. &gt;&gt; You know, they can't educate him to grunt. &gt;&gt; Well, it would make it a lot easier back in the nursery, wouldn't it? They'd just go, "Oh, he wants to be fed." You know? But I don't know about your kids, but I remember my kids, they screamed, especially Esther. Esther screamed constantly. And And it just like I I got stopped one time, one one or two o'clock in the morning. We were going through Donovan, Missouri, coming home from church at Brother Ivy's before we moved over there. We were coming home from church and that little girl was screaming in the back seat and I got stopped going through that town going about 15 miles over the speed limit because I wanted to get home. And the policeman walked up to the door and he opened the window and he heard that screaming. He said, "Y'all slow down. Have a nice night." And walked away. Evidently, he had children. But you know what? She got what she wanted. That's the only way she knew. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? It's the only way. God never had a better way for Christians, for believers to get what they desire than to ask for it, &gt;&gt; cry for it. &gt;&gt; All right? &gt;&gt; He said they can't educate him to grunt. And they can't educate him to talk that quick. But you know how he gets it? He just takes God's provided way for it. &gt;&gt; He cries for it, yells and kicks and screams till he gets it. &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; Again, brother said, a man get up on say chew his chewing gum real well and said, you know, father, I'm here tonight. If you want to give me the Holy Ghost, all right, I'm here. If you want to heal me, I'm sitting here. But if you don't, why? All right. It's your will, Lord. &gt;&gt; We do that way too many times. &gt;&gt; He said he's done wrote the will out here in the Bible. &gt;&gt; This is your will. &gt;&gt; This is his will right here. But you say, "If you want me to have it, I'll have it. But nevertheless, if you don't, well, it's all right." He said, "You'll never get nowhere." &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; But let that one get there and cry out &gt;&gt; like Buddy Robinson. He stopped in the middle of the cornfield. He tied up his mule. And Lord, if you don't give me the Holy Ghost, when you come back, you'll find a pile of bones laying right here. I'm going to stay here till I get it. That's business. Listen to me, church. If we could get down to business with God and say, "Lord, I'm going to receive the Holy Ghost. I'm going to receive salvation. I'm going to receive my healing. If we could ever get down to business like with God like that, things would change." &gt;&gt; The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man avaleth much. Brother said, "God always recommends to his people, his believing children, to always go in his provided way." Someone say, "Always." &gt;&gt; Always. &gt;&gt; That don't change, church, because we're elect. Well, I'm caught. I'm a rainbow trout. I'm elect. But it don't change. You still need to be in Holy Ghost services. You still need to cry out to him. You still need to ask him for what you have need of. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said, "Peter, if that's God's idea, he wants you to cry out." Peter started out walking on the water. He thought he was getting along. All right, sir. &gt;&gt; See how big I'm doing. I This is almost an allegory for the Christian faith. You know, all of us do that. You know, we start out, oh, I got saved. I got filled with the Holy Ghost. I went to camp, these young people, and I felt so good. Here you go, walking on the water. &gt;&gt; And then you get to looking at the waves. &gt;&gt; That's a big one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Somebody says something about you, somebody does something wrong to you, hurt your feelings. You get sick. You get hurt. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Preacher hurt. Church hurt. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; He said, "Well, I'm just there's too many ways." He said he started sinking. He didn't say, "Well, I guess it failed." See, we look at the faith of Peter while he's walking on the water and then we look at him as a failure. Peter wasn't a failure because he sunk in the water. &gt;&gt; Because he didn't stay there. &gt;&gt; That's right. Come on, church. You might have made some mistakes. You might have had a past. You might have been through some things, but you didn't stay there. &gt;&gt; Peter was walking on the water one day and he sucked just like any mortal man would sink because he lost his faith. But in that moment, he didn't stay there, but he cried out, "Lord, save me." &gt;&gt; And that eternal hand reached down and picked him up again. I believe that eternal hand is right here this morning to pick that up you up and reach down into your situation. He's still here this morning to do the same thing. You don't say, "Well, I guess it failed." But reached right down. He cried out, "Lord, save me." That eternal hand reached down and picked him up again. Why? He cried out. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm so thankful. We can still cry out this morning. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Believe his word. &gt;&gt; He said, "God recommends this way also to his baby children to cry, his believers to cry for what they want." That's right. Cry for him for your needs. He said, "Don't listen to intellectual speeches." Somebody say, "Well, now I tell you this baptism of the Holy Spirit, they talk about this divine healing, that kind of stuff." I tell you, it isn't today. I can explain it. That's not for today. Listen, a real genuine baby of God won't pay no attention to that. He will scream and yell and kick up his heels until he gets a vindicated answer back from the promise of God's word. &gt;&gt; Man don't live by bread alone, but by every word that comes out of the mouth of God proceeds from the mouth of God. &gt;&gt; He said he cries and cries till that word of promise is vindicated. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Huh? Don't give up. If there's something in your heart, you want to see a salvation. Maybe somebody you've went to church with, somebody you love, you want to see that, don't give up. Cry out for it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Until the word of promise is vindicated. I love our children because they have the faith to come to the altar. If they don't get what they're looking for, come again. They'll come again. Come again. What is it, church? I I don't criticize them for that. It's because they have faith to believe God, you're going to do it. If you didn't do it last time, you'll do it now. They're not jaded by the past and and burn over and hardened by circumstances, but they're tender to the things of God. We all ought to be that way. If we got a need, let's ask for it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Talk to God about it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Said he lives on what the Lord says for him to live by and he stays there until it happens. Cries, kicks up his heels, and just stays at it. &gt;&gt; But there got to be something in you to do that. something in the elect to cry for the right thing. &gt;&gt; Like there was in Hatty, right? &gt;&gt; To ask for the right thing, to speak the word for the right thing. See, Luther cried out for justification. Wesley for sanctification. Pentecost for gifts. But our cry is for rapturing faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, we want we we want those things. We want we must have justification. We must have sanctification. But oh God, in this day, the my heart's desire and I believe yours is as well. I Lord, I want to see a body change. &gt;&gt; There's got to be a bride who gets so hungry and so thirsty for the things of God. Say, Lord, I I'm not satisfied with just signs anymore. I'm not satisfied with I believe in signs. I believe in signs of your presence, but I want you. I want to be in your presence. I want to be there. &gt;&gt; I want my body to be changed. &gt;&gt; So, our focus in this day is our hunger and thirst. After the open book, after the message of the hour, the quickened word in our day, this widow cried for her property and received it. But she was still a widow. But there's a people who will not be a widow, &gt;&gt; will be a bride. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; In 2 Kings chapter 8, there's another widow spoken of, and it's this widow is actually the Shounomite woman. You remember the story that how she Elisha uh come to her and and they couldn't have children and then her her son was born and then the son died and Elisha she come running to Elisha and and he said the Lord's hid from me what's wrong and she come up to him he said is everything okay and she said all is well &gt;&gt; but you know when you go through something it don't mean you'll never go through anything else &gt;&gt; that's right &gt;&gt; right there'll always be trials and trouble And in 2 Kings chapter 8, this Shounamite woman and her son actually were in a condition where they had to leave the land because of a famine. It came to pass and and Elijah Elisha warns them to leave the land and come back after a certain number of years. And so it came to pass after seven years, seven years in that the woman returned out of the land of the Philistine. And she went forth to cry to the king for her house &gt;&gt; and for her land. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Now evidently her husband had passed away or he would have been the one asking but now she was a widow. Look now the king talked with Ghesi the servant of the man of God saying tell me I pray thee all the great things that Elisha done. So as she is coming to ask &gt;&gt; the mind of the king has already been placed on her situation. &gt;&gt; I love that. And it came to pass as he was telling the king how he had restored a dead body to life. Behold the woman whose son he had restored to life cried to the king for her house and for her land. And Gaza said, "My lord, oh king, this is the woman, &gt;&gt; and this is her son whom Elisha restored to life." &gt;&gt; When the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king appointed unto her a certain officer, &gt;&gt; sir. Glory to God. Saying, "Restore all that was hers and all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the land even until now." &gt;&gt; So with her, there would be a more complete restoration because she would not just receive a widow's portion, but she had a son who could inherit. So she would receive a greater portion of the inheritance. He said, "Restore all that was hers. restore all the fruits of the field, all the gifts of the spirit, all of these things back to her, sir. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; She had more standing than the other widow because she had a son who could inherit. She wasn't coming before an unjust judge. She was coming before a king. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You see the contrast? &gt;&gt; She could not inherit, but the property would be passed to her son. &gt;&gt; Very good. &gt;&gt; But now when she got done, she'd still be a widow, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Right. I I think you could look at that and say, "Well, that's like the church age believer, right? She It's not time yet." &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Now, look, her potential is limited because she can cry for what she has a right to, what her son has a right to, but perhaps she's too old to have any more children. But there's a couple other widows that are spoken of in the scripture I want to look at this morning just briefly before we close. And they're named Naomi and Ruth. Yeah. Right. You've heard the story. Hey, homiey's a Jewish widow with the same rights as any other widow, right? But Ruth is a Moabitis. &gt;&gt; Now, she is in worse condition than any of these other widows cuz she's not. &gt;&gt; She doesn't have natural rights herself. She's not even a Jew. &gt;&gt; She's not even an Israelite. &gt;&gt; But she was married to a backsliding believer. &gt;&gt; But that marriage has ended. Her old husband is dead. &gt;&gt; She is marriage material. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And she has the potential to bear children. And the Bible tells us in Ruth 2:3 that she went and gleaned in the field after the reapers. That's what a widow would do. &gt;&gt; And she happened to light on a part of the field belonging to Boaz who was of the kindred ofc. And Boaz takes notice of her. There had perhaps been many widows in his fields, &gt;&gt; but he noticed her because he saw her character. &gt;&gt; He told her that later. He said, "I've seen the way you did. I've seen what you how you followed and how you how you helped Naomi and how you stayed with the word." &gt;&gt; And so he notices her and he tells her, "Stay in my field." And he instructs his servants to drop handfuls on purpose. You remember &gt;&gt; brother Brandon said that was that little that re revelation that he dropped from time to time. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And finally the time came for wheat harvest. Remember Ruth came in the field into the land at the time of barley harvest. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But the time now had come for the wheat harvest. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And at the time of the wheat harvest, there would be a threshing floor and a place where the tears and the wheat were separated. &gt;&gt; Come on. And so I'm just telling it to you to save time this morning. We could go read it all, but &gt;&gt; she was instructed by Naomi at that time, &gt;&gt; at the time of the latter rain, at the time of the wheat harvest, and &gt;&gt; at the time, oh my, when the sun was at his full street, she was instructed, "Go down to the threshing floor and submit yourself to Boaz." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And the Bible says it came to pass at midnight that the man was afraid. So he just wakes up in his sleep. You know how you feel like somebody's in the room? &gt;&gt; And he turned himself, and behold, a woman lay at his feet. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he said, "Who art thou?" And she answered, "I am Ruth, thine handmmaid." And she asked for a remarkable thing. Yes, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; She said, "Spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmmaid, for thou art a near kinsman." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; She was asking him to marry her. Yes, &gt;&gt; now. Don't you girls get any ideas here? &gt;&gt; I It's a man man that should ask, right? But look at Ruth. She has such a desire and she's been instructed by Naomi &gt;&gt; to go lay herself down in the most vulnerable position she could be in. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because if he rejects her, she'll be a a an ill woman, a a woman of ill faith. what she did would have been wrong &gt;&gt; with anyone but her husband. &gt;&gt; Listen, you weren't meant to submit to pastors and preachers, and you weren't meant to submit to men. You were meant to submit to the word. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; To lay yourself down, say, "Well, my pastor's my husband. This one's my husband. This is the one I believe in. This is the This is my absolute." To lay yourself down to any man would be a would be a would be actually committing adultery &gt;&gt; on him. Come on now. &gt;&gt; She laid herself down there and she said, "Spread your skirt for you're a near kinsman. You can redeem me." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. You &gt;&gt; cover me with your presence, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; So, what what am I saying now? Here was a widow with potential to have children, and she said she cried out to the her husband, &gt;&gt; not to an unjust judge, &gt;&gt; not even to a king, &gt;&gt; but to her husband, &gt;&gt; the one who would be her husband. And she cried out, &gt;&gt; "Spread your skirt over me. Give me the baptism of the Holy Ghost." &gt;&gt; Cuz I know you're the only one that can redeem me. &gt;&gt; So he says, "Will I find faith?" &gt;&gt; In other words, will the message be will it happen? Will Malachi 4 happen? Will faith be restored where a bride could lay themselves down at the foot of the word? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I hope hope I'm not making it too &gt;&gt; opaque for you this morning. And I want you to be able to see. I want you to be able to see what I'm saying. Listen, it's not we lay ourselves down at his feet and we're we're we may we were a widow. Our old husband's dead, but but we got a new husband. We got somebody who will redeem us. And we were not meant to submit to any other thing. We were only meant to submit to the word. &gt;&gt; So she says, "Give me the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Marry me." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; She asked for the right thing. &gt;&gt; She didn't come crying for money. &gt;&gt; Right. She didn't come crying. I know, but Joel's getting tired. It's time to time to go eat. But listen to me for just a minute. It isn't time. She didn't cry out for money. This isn't the time to cry out just for gifts. &gt;&gt; Listen to me, church. We want him. &gt;&gt; Gifts come with him. &gt;&gt; Revival comes with him. We are not crying out just for good services. We want the word. &gt;&gt; We want him. Yes, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Give me the Holy Ghost. I want you. I want the personal the the the the life of Jesus Christ on the inside of me. I don't want just what Pentecost had. I don't want just what Luther had. I want the word. I want the fullness. Give me life. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; She didn't ask him for what he had. She asked him for him. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Her focus was not on gifts or trinkets. &gt;&gt; It was solely on Boaz. Right. &gt;&gt; He sent Ruth home to rest, &gt;&gt; goes to the gate of the city to make his claim. &gt;&gt; I was told one time, never have a vote on anything that you're not sure of the outcome. Somehow she had the faith to be sure that Boaz would answer her prayer, that he would give her all of him. &gt;&gt; Are you with Benel? He goes to the gate of the city &gt;&gt; and after he gets done, you remember the story how the there was one the nearer kinsman had to reject his claim. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And here come that one uh and he said, "I can't take it." Cuz remember what what Boaz told him? He said, "I'll redeem Naomi." But boy said, "To get Naomi, you got to marry Ruth." &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And the devil said, &gt;&gt; "I can't do that." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The devil said, "I can't redeem her." Listen, you had drugs and alcohol and and all kinds of things of the world, but that they couldn't redeem you. Denomination couldn't redeem you. But this message is not about a man. It's not about a church. It's not about a preacher. It's about the Christ of Boaz who came down in our day and said, "I'm going to give you the Holy Ghost. I'm going to fill you with my presence. I'm going to restore a faith in you &gt;&gt; that you can ask for me." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. &gt;&gt; Boy, I said to the elders, to all the people, you are witnesses this day. I have bought all that was Ic all that was chilons and mealons of the hand of Naomi. So that was Naomi's husband, her two sons. Naomi could live there, but she couldn't inherit. She was just a widow. The Jewish church would never be the bride. But it would actually be the bride who comes &gt;&gt; who lays herself down at the feet of the word that will cause the Jewish church to come to salvation. &gt;&gt; The Jewish believer to come to salvation. Look, the Jewish people could never do that. They didn't have that potential, but the bride did. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He said, "Moreover, Ruth the Moabitis, the wife of Melon, have I purchased to be my wife." You realize that's what he's done for you today. To raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren and from the gate of his place. You are witnesses this day. Listen, she wasn't a widow no more when he married her. When he took her and married, her name was no longer Ruth the Moabitas. Ruth the widow. She was Ruth the wife of Boaz. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And her cry was a cry of maturity. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Redeem me. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; All right. And that act of redemption become complete. We know it was complete because the marriage produced a son. &gt;&gt; It produced a change of her body. And Boaz took Ruth and she was his wife. And when he went into unto her, the Lord gave her conception and she bare a son. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So I want to ask you today, will he find faith? So you can say it this way. Will there be an air? Will there be a rapture? &gt;&gt; The rapture depends on there being a people that have faith for it. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; We've already read that. &gt;&gt; So, there has to be a people with rapturing faith. Will that happen? &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon Mate distills that so simply. Will Malachi 4 be fulfilled? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, if we see Malachi 4 has been fulfilled, Revelation 10:7 has been fulfilled, Luke 17:30 has been fulfilled, what can we believe today? What can we believe about our Boaz? We can believe that he's led us right to our husband. We can believe there will be an air. We can believe there will be a body change. &gt;&gt; The answer is emphatically yes. &gt;&gt; There will be someone cry out for the right thing. &gt;&gt; If there's been a secret wedding taking place &gt;&gt; right here, brother said the wedding takes place here. We go to the wedding supper. But there are people on the earth manifesting the fullness of redemption. If there was an Elijah, a vindicated prophet, there must be a bride. &gt;&gt; Listen, for Hadty Wright's miracle to work, &gt;&gt; there had to be a voice of a prophet, &gt;&gt; and there had to be the voice of a widow woman. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. That ought to sir. &gt;&gt; God wants to hear our voice &gt;&gt; speaking the word back to him. I believe I'm saved. I believe I'm healed. I believe I'm the bride. Amen. &gt;&gt; Not just the prophet speaking the message, but us speaking it back. Not something different, but the same message he brought. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon said, "He will be God's mouthpiece, speaking of the prophet, and he, as it declared in Malachi 4:6, will turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers. He will bring back the elect of the last day, and they will hear a vindicated prophet, give the exact truth as it was with Paul. He will restore the truth as they had it. And those elect with him in that day will be. Someone say will be. Will be the ones who truly manifest the Lord and be his body and be his voice. Hallelujah. Come on, Hattie. Right. You got a right to speak for your children. Come on, Ruth. You got a right to speak to your husband. You got a right to the Holy Ghost. You got a right to the things of God. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Well, I'm weak. I'm a housewife. I'm this. I'm that or the other. My kids are sick. They You got a right. &gt;&gt; Oh, you don't know what I've done or what I've been through. You got a right to speak. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said, "Lu and Wesley were the voice of God in their day. I just feel his presence here this morning with us." &gt;&gt; He said, "When the Methodist failed, God raised up others." &gt;&gt; So, has it gone on through the years until in this last day, &gt;&gt; there is. Amen. &gt;&gt; Again, &gt;&gt; hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Another people in the land. &gt;&gt; So if a prophet identified as here, can we say it's here this morning? &gt;&gt; Who under their messenger &gt;&gt; will be the final voice &gt;&gt; to the final age. Revelation 10:11, he told John, who was the type of the bride after the opening of the book, he said, "Thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings." Revelation 22:17, "The spirit and the bride say, come." &gt;&gt; Let him that heareth say, "Come." Let him that is a thirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely. Musicians come. As we close, there is a bride on the earth today. &gt;&gt; And that bride is the final voice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, do you believe it this morning, church? &gt;&gt; Do you believe? If you can believe it, listen, brother, I'm going to tell the people if you can believe it. He said the angel told him if you can get the people to believe you, &gt;&gt; cancer won't even stand in the way. &gt;&gt; If you get the people to believe you, any We've seen sickness heal. We've seen everything that every miracle possible that could happen has happened right around us. &gt;&gt; We've seen these things. &gt;&gt; Then if we could believe for that, can you believe this morning as the widow woman, as the woman who's come now to be married, no longer a widow, can you believe this morning that he will find faith? &gt;&gt; Can you believe that if the rapture happened right now, that you'd be ready for it? &gt;&gt; Do you have the kind of faith to say, "I know I'm going to be there. My life may be troubled right now. I might have circumstances that drag me down. I might even at times have doubted. Listen, you say, "Well, I doubted one time." Listen, it was it was Abraham and Sarah sitting there. Abraham doubted so much she laughed at the promise, but she still had the son. Why? Because the Bible said a Sarah herself received faith for the promise. &gt;&gt; Oh, church, it's a gift that God gives us. Aren't you glad to know there will be a bride? Will I find faith? The answer is emphatically yes. Yes, he has found faith. Yes, there is a bride. I'm not pumping you up this morning. I'm trying to get you to believe in what you are. &gt;&gt; Trying to get you to believe Jesus could cast out the epilepsy devil because he believed in who he was. &gt;&gt; We got to believe. That's what this opening of the word came to do to help us believe in who we are. &gt;&gt; I believe I'm that woman that can ask. I'm that bride that can ask. If you need the Holy Ghost this morning, you ask him. &gt;&gt; You lay yourself down. Submit yourself to the word. &gt;&gt; Yes. Here I am at your feet, Lord. Hallelujah. You're not a You're not a widow seeking an unjust judge. There's been a marriage ceremony take place. You're a bride asking her husband and he will give good things, good gifts to his children, to his wife. Aren't you glad for that today? Let's bow our heads together. [Music] I I hope it hasn't been too hard for us to follow. Hope we can understand today. I Oh, church. If you could just believe in what you are, you think, well, I got to do this. I got to do that. I got to jump through these hoops. I've got to I've got to I got to set my life up just right. And every time you do that, everything falls apart. And you think, well, I messed up. Now I can never be right. If you can believe that you are the bride of Jesus Christ, you can have what you asked for this morning. What do you have need of today? I believe you can meet that need going into the meetings so we can be a help to somebody else. I believe we can meet our needs can be met this morning. The sick can be healed. We can have faith to believe. I'm not a loser. I'm not what the devil says I am. I'm not some kind of a a strange person or a cult. I'm I'm a member of the bride of Jesus Christ. I believe. I trust you, Lord. Oh, I pray you'd grant it today. Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, as we preach the word, Lord, I pray there'd be faith in the building, Lord, that people would know that you are God. You're the same yesterday, today, and forever. I trust you, Lord. Lord, I trust you for salvation. Lord, my own salvation, though I've been saved filled with the Holy Ghost every day, Lord. Lord, I make sure my own salvation. And I pray God, I thank you for let for something that we can trust, Lord, that we can lay down at your feet, trust you, oh God, give our all to you. I thank you for that, Lord. I pray you'd help us to do that. Or if there's one here who's not surrendered fully to you, I pray that they would do that today. If there's one here, maybe a child, maybe a young person, an old person, Lord, maybe they've lived a life of sin and and they realize they're a sinner. May they come to you this morning and recognize there is a savior. Oh God, help them to know who who they are. That they may be in the pawn shop, but you're you're there at the counter. You paid the price. Let them accept it, Lord, and be caught up by your hand. Pray you grant it, Lord Jesus. We love you and we thank you for all that you've done and what you're continuing to do. I pray for these meetings, Lord. I pray that you'd just be an outpouring of your spirit. I pray Lord for the people that'll work so hard. I pray you give them strength and Lord for the for the ministers that'll come. I pray their focus would be on the word Lord and they'd preach the word with all their heart to help the people Lord. And I pray when we're done, Lord, that we can rejoice together, Lord. We don't know, maybe before the meetings come, we'll go into rapture and that would be wonderful, Lord. If we get to Thursday night, let us rejoice in this place as if we were already there. I pray you'd grant it, Lord. Oh, we love you, Lord. We thank you for all that you've done. I pray that you'd move now in the audience. Move among these people that you speak to each one in their hearts. We pray by your word. Jesus name. Amen. Thank you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm so happy. &gt;&gt; Oh, could you just sing it now? Oh, cuz I've accepted the word of the Lord. The revealed word. Oh, can we stand together and sing it? The revealed. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord. word that was spoken by the prophet of Malachi. &gt;&gt; If you have a need today, the altar's open. Be glad to pray with you. Oh, can't you see?

Don't you love him? &gt;&gt; I I hope the revelation of the word does something for you. &gt;&gt; I hope it does for all of us. There's something in our hearts we cry out for, Lord, help me to know who I am. &gt;&gt; I'm an eagle. I I wasn't a chicken pin, but I don't belong in a chicken pin. I belong to you.
