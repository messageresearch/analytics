This old house I'm living in is needing [music] repair. the windows [singing] [music] and the shutters letting in the cold [singing] cold [music] air.

Can you give the Lord one more hand of praise tonight? [applause] Amen. Are you looking forward to the word of the Lord this evening? Amen. I believe if you're under expectation, you'll get what you expect. Do you believe that? Amen. A prophet taught us whatever you expect is what you get out of a service. If you come looking for something to criticize, you'll find plenty to criticize because we're all human beings in this building here tonight. Amen. But aren't you glad he's with us? Amen. I love what brother Shawn reminded us of on Sunday. Amen. He said he said the message he said the message of brother Brandham was to come and declare that he is here [music] present among us and if we remember that he's the great one. We're all under him. There's no big eyes or little U's. We're all [music] we're all under him. We're all on the it's all at the ground is level at the foot of the cross. Aren't you thankful tonight? Amen. That there has been something great done in our lives and that we have a desire to be here and to hear the word of the Lord. So, as our pastor comes, I want you to be under expectation that if you have a need tonight, he can walk right down your aisle and into your seat [music] and he can do whatever you have need of. Brother Bill, he can raise you up, buddy. He sure can. Amen. I see several among us that have needs on your heart. Just hold your need on your heart tonight. Amen. I know God can meet every need. Do you believe it? Amen. Let's sing this with all of our [music] hearts now. Reach out and touch the Lord [music] as he goes [singing] by. And you'll [music] find he's not too busy to [singing] hear your heart's cry. Oh, [singing] he's [music] passing by this moment. your needs to supply. [music] Oh, [singing] reach out and touch the Lord as [singing] he goes by. Well, can you reach up? Reach [music and singing] up and touch the Lord as he [music and singing] goes by. And you'll find he's not too [singing and music] busy to hear your heart's [music] cry. [singing] Oh, he's passing by this moment, [music] your [singing] needs to supply. Just reach [music and singing] up and touch the Lord as he Oh, one more time with all your hearts now. Oh, reach out and touch [music] the Lord. [singing] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Oh, you're fine. He's [singing] never too busy [music] to hear your heart [singing] cry. Oh, he's there. Sing by this [music] moment. [singing] Do you believe it tonight? He's to supply. [music] Oh, reach [singing] out and touch the Lord as [singing and music] he goes by. Let's bow our heads while they continue to play. Heavenly Father, we're so grateful to be your children, Lord, to be able to gather together with those of like precious faith. It's the most wonderful [music] thing, Lord. As the prophet taught us, it ought to be a thrill to us to gather together. And it is, Lord, we thank you for that. [music] I I pray that you just move in every situation, Lord. You know what every need is, every [music] heart, what's on it. Pray you'd move me out of the way, Lord. Lord, I I [music] realize I'm insufficient in myself to get across what you put on my heart, but I know that you're able, Lord, and I've seen you many times do it before. Won't you meet us here again, Lord, by [music] the well? Lord, discern the secrets of our hearts tonight by your word. We'll give you the thanks and the praise in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Ephesians chapter 1 and verse 6. Ephesians 1 and 6. We'll go right back into our series on the book of Ephesians. I trust that you've enjoyed uh so far. We haven't gotten very far. We're just down to verse six. But uh just the Lord has been blessing us and I I've really enjoyed preaching it. So good to have each and every one of you here tonight. Our look it's like our regular Wednesday night crowd. Some are missing. Praying for those that are sick and in need tonight and I'm able to be here. Good to have uh Brother Wayne here tonight and playing the guitar. It's just a wonderful uh wonderful thing. I uh watch our older generation as they get older. And you know, one thing you can say for them, they were faithful to the house of God. And I appreciate that. And I hope some of our younger ones emulate that in their lives because we wouldn't have a church if it wasn't for some of you older folks that just really were faithful to the house of the Lord. And so, it's good to see each and every one of you. Ephesians 1:6 says, "To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved." He hath made us accepted in the beloved. I pray the Lord would add his blessing to the word. You may be seated this evening. That word accepted is uh I'll pronounce this wrong but herto. It's to bestow favor on someone to give someone a benefit out of favor and kindness. It's grace. &gt;&gt; It's what the word is from grace. So he has made us accepted means he has given us grace or he has made us grace. If that makes sense to you. The only other place in the New Testament that that word is used is Luke chapter 1 and verse 28 where the angel come to Mary and said hail thou that are highly favored. That word high that those words highly favored is the same Greek word that means to have grace. You've been given grace. And and uh I I believe that it's not just Mary that was given grace to carry the word, but you and I have been given grace today to be the word and to have the word birthed in our hearts. So he said, you have been accepted in the beloved. And we know that he is the beloved. You know, I've always kind of taken that verse wrong. It's amazing, brother Herald, as we go on in in life, we we learn things, don't we? We we learn things we never knew. And I've always taken that beloved as being accepted among the saints or accepted in the church. But that's not actually what it is at all. It's actually being accepted in Christ because the beloved is Christ. And yet we are beloved by being in Christ. So we are included by grace in his beloved. That's what it means to be accepted. Romans 9:25 said quoting Isaiah as he said also also in Isaiah I will call them my people or Hosea rather I will call them my people which were not my people and her beloved which was not beloved. So he said I'm going to call you beloved. You were not beloved. You were not you were not what he was but because of him he said I'm going to call you beloved. Paul tells the Thessalonians in 1 Thessalonians 1:4 that they were the beloved. And and he said, "We know this because of what God did uh through his ministry to reach them." And uh and he says it like this. He said, "Knowing, brethren, beloved, your election of God." Aren't you glad to be elected of God? Aren't you glad to be of the beloved? He said, "We know your election." Now look how we know it. 1 Thessalonians 1:5. For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power and in the Holy Ghost and in much assurance as you know what manner of men we were among you for your sake. So he's saying that we know that you are elected. We know that you are beloved or that you are accepted in the beloved because of what God did to find you. I there's a great revelation there. God through a prophet. He did many mighty works in our day to find you. He said, "Behold, I send you Elijah the prophet before the coming the of the great and dreadful day of the Lord." What was he doing? It was our gospel coming not in word only, but also in power to find us, proving that we were the elected. He sent a pillar of fire because we are the beloved of God. That was grace to us. He sent a an Elohim message. He sent a a son of man ministry so that we could know that we were the elected of God. Oh, that ought to make us shout all over the building tonight. &gt;&gt; I know you're tired on a Wednesday night and you've BEEN WORKING, BUT THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THAT. BROTHER GABE, ought to mean something to you that THAT THAT WE KNOW WE'VE BEEN ACCEPTED BY GOD BECAUSE HE'S DONE SO MANY GREAT WORKS IN OUR AGE. And not just with brother Brandham, but we've seen the miraculous in our lives. And why do WE SEE THAT? BECAUSE HE LOVES YOU. You're the beloved of the Lord. You're accepted in the beloved. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's an assurance of election. Say 2 Thessalonians 2:13 says, "But we are bound to give thanks always to God for you, brethren, beloved." I love that. Brethren, beloved of the Lord, because God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth, where to he called you by our gospel to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ. So he called you to be accepted in the beloved. We are beloved in him as Mary was beloved. We are accepted in the beloved, greatly blessed, highly favored. How many believe that tonight? You say, "But I'm sick tonight." but you're greatly blessed. I'M SICK TONIGHT, BUT YOU'RE HIGHLY FAVORED. OH, IT DON'T MATTER WHAT CONDITION OF LIFE THAT WE'RE GOING THROUGH. WE'RE NOT ACCEPTED BY OUR CONDITION OF LIFE. WE'RE ACCEPTED in the beloved. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And and so, Brother Brandham comments on this scripture, and I'm so thankful for a word prophet in our day. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Where he says, "Wherein has made us acceptable by the person &gt;&gt; beloved, which is Christ, made us accepted. How? By him. &gt;&gt; How do we get into him? By one spirit. All baptized &gt;&gt; into him. So if you have the Holy Spirit today, you are accepted. You've been given grace, highly favored in the beloved, which is Christ. &gt;&gt; Now, I think one of the worst things that a believer can have is an inferiority complex. &gt;&gt; Right? And we get that though sometimes, don't we? We we we get where we don't fit in. We don't, you know, I I don't because of my background or because of something I've been through or because of uh way things have happened in my life, we get an inferiority call. And I'm just going to preach to you a little bit tonight. And because I feel this myself that maybe you didn't get to go and do everything that everybody else got to go and do as a young person. Maybe you were in sin. Maybe you were raised in a home where things were wrong. Maybe you were raised in a church that didn't believe in the Holy Ghost and the move of God and you didn't get to do what everybody else got to do and and so now you're older and you feel kind of inferior and I said, "Well, if I had if id have come this way, if I'd have been raised different in a different church or in a different environment, BUT GOD BROUGHT YOU UP THE WAY HE BROUGHT YOU UP for a reason." AND HE BROUGHT YOU BY THE PATH THAT HE BROUGHT YOU BY FOR A REASON. Do we believe that tonight? AND WE ARE NOT ACCEPTED BECAUSE OF OUR BACKGROUND. WE ARE NOT ACCEPTED BECAUSE OF WHERE WE COME FROM OR WHAT WE'VE DONE OR OUR EFFORTS EVEN IN THE CHURCH. WE ARE ACCEPTED IN THE beloved tonight. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He He is accepted by one spirit. He's accepted us into him. So, we should not feel inferior. Our histories might be different, but our future is the same. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. Brother Bill, I could look around at each one of us. every one of us and see different histories &gt;&gt; and history might have been yesterday &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; our histories might be different but our future is the same &gt;&gt; if we have been accepted in the beloved oh we we ought not be rejected by the church &gt;&gt; right and yet sometimes we are &gt;&gt; but the answer to that is not h not to have an inferiority ity complex or to get a complex about it or to feel bad about it or pull off by ourselves and sit IN OUR HOME AND AND NOT GO TO CHURCH AND not listen to people, not do No, THE THING TO DO is to just REALIZE I'M ACCEPTED IN CHRIST. I DON'T HAVE TO BE ACCEPTED BY THE PEOPLE. I DON'T HAVE TO OH, COME ON, CHURCH. MY MINISTRY, LISTEN. UH I HAVE TO I HAD TO COME TO A PLACE IN MY MINISTRY. I REALIZED IT WAS NOT GOING TO BE ACCEPTED BY EVERYBODY. I'M NOT GOING TO MAKE EVERYBODY HAPPY, BUT I'M ACCEPTED IN THE BELOVED AND THAT'S ENOUGH. LET ME DO EVERYTHING I CAN DO. SURE, I'LL MAKE MISTAKES. SURE, SO WILL YOU. EVERY ONE OF US WILL. SURE, WE'LL FAIL SOMETIMES. BUT WE ARE NOT ACCEPTED BECAUSE OF WHAT WE DO. WE'RE ACCEPTED BECAUSE OF WHO HE IS. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WE'RE BY ONE SPIRIT, WE'VE BEEN BAPTIZED INTO ONE BODY. HOW MANY BELIEVE THAT TONIGHT? &gt;&gt; WE ARE ACCEPTED. BEHOLD, HALLELUJAH. Because of who he is, we don't HAVE TO FEEL INFERIOR TO NOBODY. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. RIGHT. That's good. Hallelujah. Look at all the churches that Paul wrote to. They were all different. &gt;&gt; I sent Joel a scripture today where Paul told the Corinthian church, he said, "I robbed other churches, took wages from them to come to you." He wasn't happy with them. &gt;&gt; That word rob's pretty strong. &gt;&gt; He wasn't happy with what they were doing, but they were still saints. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? They all come up different ways and come from different backgrounds, but they were still saints of God. &gt;&gt; They were all different. He had to deal with them differently, but they were accepted in him. Ephesians 1:7, in whom we have redemption through his blood. And we're going to come back to this idea of accepted in just a moment. But he said we have redemption through his blood. So this is how we are accepted, the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace. But Brandon said, "How can you preach predestination of God's fordaining and setting unless there's a sin atonement somewhere?" &gt;&gt; So there's got to be a sin atonement for us to preach predestination, &gt;&gt; right? And that's just the truth, church. I can't make it without predestination and an atonement, &gt;&gt; right? And and I can't make it without an atonement. even the predestinated and the fore ordained and even the the called and and whatever it is that you are you you must have an atonement for you to be able to make it. Brother Brandon said, "Why is it?" I know some people don't believe they've ever made a mistake, but Brother Brandham says differently. PAUL TAUGHT DIFFERENTLY. Each day, &gt;&gt; someone say, "Each day, &gt;&gt; you do wrong." &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about running around with women. I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT DOING things that are, you know, uh just anti-word and antichrist. I'm talking about just living. &gt;&gt; Right. Each day you make a mistake. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. EACH DAY YOU DO WRONG. BUT IF YOU'RE BORN AGAIN, man or woman, hallelujah, as soon as you MAKE THE MISTAKE, GOD KNOWS YOU'RE SORRY FOR IT. You would stand in the presence of President Roosevelt OR ANYONE ELSE, AND SAY, "I'M WRONG. GOD, FORGIVE ME FOR this thing." Hallelujah. He said, "You notice that sins from verse 7 that sins s i n s a sinner is a sinner. He he does not commit sins." &gt;&gt; Brother Bram told us not to not to think to be too hard on the sinner for drinking. Right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It's just what sinners do, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Right. We don't not too hard on them for doing drugs. That's what sinners do. &gt;&gt; Christians don't do that. Sinners do that, &gt;&gt; right? But but he said he said he does not commit sins. But the church commits sins. &gt;&gt; Right. Does wrong, gets a wrong thought, &gt;&gt; a wrong impression, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; You you can be led wrong. &gt;&gt; Right. You can be misled. You can be uh temporarily deceived if I can put it like that. The elect won't be deceived, but you can be temporarily misled, &gt;&gt; right? You you brother put it this way. He said wrong impression makes scruples, &gt;&gt; WOBBLES LIKE A LITTLE CHILD WALKING, TRYING this is a beautiful picture trying to learn how to walk. He just don't know how to walk good yet cuz he's a little boy. But we have a hand that reaches down and gets us and steadies US AND SAYS, "MAKE THIS STEP THIS WAY, SON. &gt;&gt; MAKE THIS STEP THIS WAY, SON." I REMEMBER WHEN Peter was really, really young and he and he was just learning TO WALK AND WE'D WATCH HIM, you know, and how you do it. We don't do that no more. You know, now if he falls in the living room, we all laugh. But there was a time when Peter would, you know, we sit there and I'd sit on one side, one couch, and she'd sit on another chair and and we'd watch Peter as he begin to walk by. Your kids were special to you. You were with them all during those times, &gt;&gt; right? And you you you were there when they don't even remember. You remember. And I remember sitting there and he just beginning to learn to walk. And when he made one step, it's like you did so good. You didn't sit there with a belt. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Oh, come on, church. I know you didn't. You You didn't sit there with a belt and whoop him because you didn't make two steps or five steps or whatever. &gt;&gt; No, you did everything YOU COULD TO ENCOURAGE THAT CHILD. &gt;&gt; MAKE ANOTHER STEP. MAKE ANOTHER STEP. THAT'S THE WAY WE OUGHT TO TREAT PEOPLE WHO COME TO THE HOUSE OF GOD. MAKE ANOTHER STEP. LORD, HELP US to do that. Make another step. If they if they're if they're willing to say, "I'm a sinner. I NEED HELP." THEN HERE'S A HAND THAT CAN REACH DOWN AND HELP YOU. &gt;&gt; Got to recognize they're a sinner. But if they're willing to do that, &gt;&gt; here's a hand. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He said, "You don't pick us up and spank us cuz we make a mist made a mistake. &gt;&gt; He doesn't beat us to death because we're trying to walk. &gt;&gt; He loves us like we love our children." &gt;&gt; A real real daddy wouldn't whip his child when he's trying to walk. If he falls down on the floor, reach right down with a big strong hand. PICK HIM UP. TAKE BOTH HANDS A HOLD OF HIM AND SAY, "THIS is the way you do it, son. Walk like this." That's the way God does his church. Reaches down, gets him in his arm, picks him up, and say, "Walk like this, son. Here, DON'T SAY IT LIKE THAT. TALK IT LIKE THIS. I DON'T CARE WHAT THE CHURCH SAYS, WHAT this says, what that says. YOU SAY IT LIKE THIS." He said, "If my word preaches it, you stay right with it. Walk with it. STAY RIGHT WITH IT. DON'T CARE WHAT everybody else says. STAY RIGHT WITH IT. WALK LIKE THIS. THIS IS THE way you make your steps. Our sins, an atonement love FOR OUR SINS. OR WE NEVER HAVE A CHANCE. HOW MANY CAN CAN FELLOWSHIP WITH THAT THOUGHT TONIGHT? IF IT WASN'T FOR AN ATONEMENT LOVE, WE WOULD NEVER HAVE A CHANCE. HOW WE COULD JUST anchor on them words. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, that's enough right there. I know you say, "Brother Ben, I've heard it before." But I think we need to run it through our brain and let it get down into the soul AND BEGIN TO REALLY BAPTIZE US WITH THE REVELATION OF THE FACT THAT HE'S WANTING US TO LEARN TO WALK AND HE'S HELPING US WALK. &gt;&gt; That's atonement. &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I think sometimes we struggle with being accepted in the beloved because we've not really accepted but we are accepted. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See if we know we are accepted in him and he is &gt;&gt; the beloved word beloved is agape by the way &gt;&gt; brother Brand was that great divine attribute of God called love. Right? &gt;&gt; And we've been baptized by one spirit into the body. Why can why would we condemn ourselves or anyone else for that matter? Jesus &gt;&gt; happened to be there when the woman was caught in adultery and you know he knew her heart. Maybe she was in a situation that she didn't want to be in, but she was there. And and maybe maybe she did. Maybe she did want to be in it. She didn't want to be in it after they started stoning her or getting ready to. But &gt;&gt; they drug her out. And outside of the town and they were going to use it as a way to tempt Tim because they knew he &gt;&gt; he always took up for sinners. And &gt;&gt; so they drug outside the town. They said, "Jesus, you know what? Do you say about her that she was caught in the act? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So her past was very recent. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And you know person can be accepted in the beloved in a moment. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. You say but brother Ben I carried in something to the church. Well you might have got the Holy Ghost sitting here. You said that's impossible. No it's not because that's how it happened in Cornelius's house. &gt;&gt; While they heard the word they received the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Right. and become accepted in the beloved. So, you know, things like that can happen. And here was a woman sitting there or down on the ground where they'd thrown her. And Jesus of course said, "He that has s sin," he first he writes on the ground. He says, "He that has sin or no sin," he said, "ccast the first stone." And the oldest ones was the wisest. So, they left first. And then the younger ones finally realized, "Hey, you know, we got problems, too." And they left. And pretty soon it was just her and Jesus. And the truth is he was the only one that could condemn her and he wouldn't. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; Oh, church. &gt;&gt; But we we we want to be accepted, but what we want to do is be accepted by him. See, they were never going to accept her, &gt;&gt; but he would. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; he would. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; She just had to be willing to give up her life of sin. He said, "Go and sin no more." &gt;&gt; Right. She had to be willing to give up her life of sin. She couldn't stay the way she was. She couldn't fight him. &gt;&gt; But she was there as vulnerable as she was. And and he with the only opinion that mattered. And what did he do? By the message, he revealed his thoughts to her. &gt;&gt; Oh, I hope you can see it tonight. WHAT HAS HE DONE IN OUR AGE? WE WERE CAUGHT IN SIN. WE WERE A WOMAN CAUGHT IN ADULTERY. And he HE WROTE SOMETHING TO US. SEE, HE SPOKE SOMETHING TO US AND HE SAID, "GO AND SIN NO MORE." AND WE WERE ACCEPTED IN THE BELOVED. &gt;&gt; We were accepted in him. See, even if you're the most recent convert in the church, you're still accepted in the beloved one, Christ Jesus. Like I said, if you receive the Holy Ghost coming through those doors, right? If you if YOU RECEIVED IT WHILE THE PREACHING WAS GOING ON, &gt;&gt; you are still accepted &gt;&gt; in the beloved. &gt;&gt; Brother B says, "SOMETIMES YOU PREACH HARD." I KNOW I do. I'VE GOT TO SOMETIMES SOMETIMES WE'VE GOT TO SAY THINGS THAT ARE HARSH. SOMETIMES WE GOT TO WE GOT TO REMIND people of sin because we WANT THEM TO REPENT BECAUSE WE KNOW IF THEY CAN REPENT, THEY CAN GET TO JESUS. WE KNOW IF THEY REPENT, THEY CAN BE ACCEPTED IN THE BELOVED. WE KNOW IF THEY CAN LET GO OF THEMSELVES, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; They can be made whole. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon said, "Preachers are called prophets and teachers and evangelists and pastors." So where they receive the Holy Ghost and then a gift to do these things with it, but God don't have any little bitty children or great big children. They're all children to him. That's exactly right. And you're rightly positioned. It's sitting right now in heavenly places in Christ Jesus with every power. How many believe that tonight? &gt;&gt; That's where I belong. &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Brandon, I'm the least in the church. I'm just a little bitty fellow." But remember, when he ascended on high, you are raised with him. &gt;&gt; You're in the body and you're with Christ right now, seated in heavenly places. If you're the skin on the bottom of the feet, every devil is underneath you. [applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Do we believe that tonight? &gt;&gt; Amen. the church. He said, "Where the head is, the body is with it. And if we be buried, died, buried in Christ, and we're raised with him in his resurrection and set in heavenly places in Christ Jesus with every fire of hell under us. NO MATTER HOW LITTLE you are, every devil is under you." Why? Our great conqueror has conquered every sin, everything, every sickness, even death itself. That's right. We are more than conquerors in him. Do you believe you're accepted in the beloved? Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I want to deal and forgive me for being uh teaching a little bit tonight, but I want to deal with this idea of not being accepted by people. You know, Paul was predestined to be who he was. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And he was accepted in the beloved once he was born again. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But he was accepted by God before he was accepted by the church. And you say, "Why?" Because they are human. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And Paul was a bad guy. &gt;&gt; Acts chapter 9 verse1 Saul was breathing out threatenings and solder against the disciples of the Lord went unto the high priest and desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues. By the way, if you're questioning why did you go to Paul's? Cuz brother Brandham does an adoption. Said that if he found any of this way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound unto Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; This man was going to be the messenger to the Gentiles. But you couldn't approve it right then. the angel to the first church age, one of the seven stars in his hand. And that's what he was going to be, but you couldn't have proved it to nobody there. And brother Brandon, he says this about that. He I'm actually using the context of that sermon brother Brandon preaches. He said, "How do you know that that old bootleger down here is not predestinated to life? How do you know that old street walker you won't even speak to? How do you know a little handshake and invite her to church wouldn't make a saint of God out of her yondering glory? How do you know she's not? He said, "That's what we don't know." So, we don't know who is or who isn't, but that's our duty. Like a fisherman threw a net in the sea and pulled out. He brought frogs and fish and lizards and water, spiders and everything else, but some of them was fish. He didn't know. He just cast a net. That's what we do. He said, "Watch Paul." &gt;&gt; See, God gets a hold of him. Now, and we have to say, God really got a hold of him. He knocked him off of his high horse and knocked him off there in the sand. And he he he saw a light and heard a voice. He said Paul Saul Saul, why persecutest thou me? And he's laying there in the sand. He said, "WHO ARE YOU, LORD?" HE SAID, "I'M Jesus whom thou persecut us? It's hard for you to kick against the pricks." And he recognized who it was. AND HE GETS DOWN there and God REALLY GETS A HOLD OF HIM. But yet he was not accepted by the church. Look at Acts chapter 9 and verse 10. There was a certain disciple at Damascus named Ananas. And to him said the Lord in a vision, Ananas. And he said, "Behold, I am here, Lord." And the Lord said unto him, "Arise, and go into the street, which is CALLED STRAIGHT, AND INQUIRE IN THE HOUSE of Judas, for one called Saul of Tarsus, for behold, he prayth." Now, Ananas was a prophet. And brother Brandham said, the Lord spoke to him and said, "There's a man coming down the road over yonder. He's just as blind as a bat, and his name is Saul. Saul of Tarsus." He said, "Lord, I've heard great things. Don't send me. I'm a little man. Don't send me after him. He goes on talking to the Lord and then he said, Lord, but this man's a terrible man. He said, but behold, he prayth. Now, YOU'LL GO DOWN THROUGH A CERTAIN STREET AND YOU'LL COME TO A FOUNTAIN. YOU PASS THAT FOUNTAIN ON THE LEFT AND YOU GO DOWN, THERE WILL BE A WHITE HOUSE. GO UP AND KNOCK ON THE DOOR. HE JUST LAYING THERE IN THE HALL. THAT'S AS far as they ever got him. HE SAID, "LAY YOUR HANDS ON HIM. TAKE HIM DOWN TO THE river of Damascus and baptize him in the name of Jesus cuz I tell you what I'm going to do. He's going to have to suffer many things for me for he's my messenger to the Gentiles. WHAT WAS IT? GOD HAD ACCEPTED HIM. BUT HE HAD TO REVEAL THAT TO ANANAS. &gt;&gt; And Ananas went his way and entered into the house and put HIS HANDS ON HIM AND SAID, "BROTHER SAUL, &gt;&gt; but I want Come on, CHURCH. THAT'S A MORE DIFFICULT THING TO DO THAN WE REALIZE." &gt;&gt; RIGHT, brother Saul. &gt;&gt; But he wasn't out. He wasn't looking for Christians to persecute anymore. &gt;&gt; Are you WITH ME NOW? LIFE HAD CHANGED. GOD GOT A HOLD OF HIM. THE PILLAR OF FIRE MADE A DIFFERENCE IN HIS LIFE. AND WHEN IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE, you can tell. &gt;&gt; And here this here here it made such a difference. It changed him so much. And he walked UP TO HIM AND PUT HIS HAND ON AND SAID, "BROTHER SAUL, GOD WAS WORKING ON BOTH ENDS OF THE LINE. THE LORD EVEN Jesus that appeared unto thee in the way AS THOU CAMEST HATH SENT ME THAT THOU MIGHTEST RECEIVE THY SIGHT AND BE FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST." &gt;&gt; Now Ananas got it right. He was brother Saul &gt;&gt; tuned to be brother Paul. &gt;&gt; But the rest of the church was still suspicious. He said, "Brother brother, but you you they could do one or two things about that, right? You either trust that you are accepted in the beloved or you can get hurt, &gt;&gt; right? I don't know why God put this on my heart tonight, but you just you just suffer with me for a moment." And and I'm, you know, even even to myself, you know, you sometimes you feel like you don't fit in and [clears throat] you feel awkward in social situations and you feel awkward at church and awkward among God's people and preachers feel awkward around preachers and some of them pull away and they quit fellowshipping and they just kind of sit by themselves and everybody's wrong. But what if we just trusted him &gt;&gt; that we're accepted in him and just did our best in front of the people &gt;&gt; to try to love him. Now when Saul was come to Jerusalem, he is saved to join himself to the disciples. But they were all afraid of him. &gt;&gt; Why, brother Ben? Were they under some kind of spirit? Did they not have any love? No, they were human &gt;&gt; and he'd killed some of their children. stoned help helped while they stoned STEPHEN AND AND DRAGGED SOME OF THEM INTO into jail and everything else. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Believe not that he was a disciple. But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles and declared unto them how he'd seen the Lord in the way that he'd spoken to him how he'd preached boldly Damascus in the name of Jesus. So he told him, "His life's been changed. We we've seen it changed. We've seen God. There's evidence of grace in his life. GRACE THAT SAVED HIM, THAT unmmerited favor that made him accepted in the beloved. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Paul himself said it this way. 1 CORINTHIANS 15:9, "FOR I AM THE LEAST OF the apostles, and I'm not meat to BE CALLED AN APOSTLE BECAUSE I PERSECUTED THE CHURCH OF GOD." OH, THAT'S THE ATTITUDE THAT WE OUGHT TO HAVE. LISTEN, I'M NOT WORTHY TO BE in the bride OF JESUS CHRIST, BUT HE CALLED ME. MY MY MY RECOGNITION OF MY UNWORTHINESS DOES NOT GIVE ME A A COMPLEX OF INFERIORITY. BUT I RECOGNIZE IF HE CALLED ME, HE MUST HAVE SOMETHING FOR ME TO DO. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; GOOD. &gt;&gt; He said, "But by the grace of God, I am what I am. And his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain, but I labored more abundantly than they all." He said, "It wasn't even me that did it. Yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; When somebody really gets saved from a background like that, what happens to them? They they want to do everything they can to please God, &gt;&gt; right? And turn that thing around and try to do everything they can for God. And God uses that many times. He used that with Paul. We know he used that with Stephen. PAUL LATER IN HIS LIFE SAID, "THERE'S A CROWN waiting for me." A crown. If you look at that WORD CROWN, IT'S STEFANOS A CROWN. Brother Brandon said he was thinking about Stephen when he talked about how HE WAS READY TO GO. It's better for me to leave and go on. Cuz he was thinking about Stephen already being there and he'd finally get to meet him and SIT DOWN WITH HIM AND TALK TO HIM. OH GOD, CAN YOU IMAGINE THEM SITTING TOGETHER ON THE OTHER SIDE WHEN IT WHEN HERE SAUL HAD CONSENTED TO HIS DEATH, BUT OVER THERE? &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; OH CHURCH, OVER THERE THEY GOT TO SIT DOWN TOGETHER in the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, I guess the only thing we can do is just trust God &gt;&gt; and love one another and forgive &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; one another. Paul dealt with rejection not at the just at the beginning but at the end of his ministry reached a time when it looked like he was just washed up. &gt;&gt; In 2 Timothy chapter 4 and verse 5, he tells Timothy, "Watch on all things. Endure afflictions. Do the work of an evangelist. make full proof of your ministry. For I am now ready to be offered in the throne or the time of my departure is at hand. I have fought a good fight. I have finished my course. I've kept the faith henceforth. It was laid up for me a crown &gt;&gt; of righteousness which the Lord the righteous judge will give me at that day. Not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing. Right. &gt;&gt; But if you read this, &gt;&gt; you know, brother Brandham tells us in I believe it's in my new ministry or present state of my present stage of my ministry. I believe is the sermon that it's in. But brother Brandham talks about this and he it's almost like he's typing Paul to himself. Some of the things he's going through, how he was rejected and it almost seems like Paul is one minute he's triumphant and next minute he's really pitiful. Because then in verse 9 he said do thy diligence to come shortly unto me for Deus hath forsaken me having loved this present world departed unto Thessalonica Christians to Galatia Titus unto Dalatia listen they may have had good reason to go some of them Deus we know left for the world brother Brandon said he left for the church the worldly church he still said he was a Christian but he didn't just didn't follow Paul anymore &gt;&gt; we've seen some like that too. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But but and and and he just didn't follow the message, right? And and so but he he claimed to be a Christian. Deus has forsaken me, but he said Titus left as well and Christians only Luke is with me. Luke was Paul's personal physician. And brother Brandham said the people use that against him because if he's a divine healer, why does he have a personal physician with him? &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; Human beings misunderstand one another. Right? Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; Take Mark and bring him with thee. Now, here's some misunderstanding. If you go back to Barnabas, we've talked about it before. Barnabas and and Paul split up. Had a bitter split up and and and bitterly disagreed over whether Mark was fit for the ministry. &gt;&gt; Right? And and all this time later, Paul writes back and says, "By the way, I need Mark. &gt;&gt; He's profitable to me for the ministry." SOMEONE WHO PAUL had rejected. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; Because you know, AND I'M SURE MARK, he could have had a complex about that. But you know what he did? He went and found Paul. Went went to Paul's side. 2 Timothy 4:13, the cloak that I left at Trrowass with carpass when thou comest bring with thee. So he only had one coat and the books, but especially the parchments. He had some things to write to the Corinthians. You know, he was just going to Alexander the coppermith did me much evil. The Lord reward him according to his works. Of whom be thou ware also for heath greatly withstood our words. &gt;&gt; Oh, this is pitiful. And my first answer, no man stood with me, but all men forsook me. &gt;&gt; That's pitiful. &gt;&gt; Paul standing there and said, "Everybody left." &gt;&gt; But you know what? Jesus experienced that. He didn't get a complex about it. He just told Peter, "When you're saved, when you're converted, strengthen your brothers." &gt;&gt; No man stood with me. Oh man. Oh my. Look, but all men forsook me. I pray God it may not be laid to their charge. That's a different Paul than what was breathing, threatening, and slaughter, isn't it? &gt;&gt; Look at him in verse 17. Notwithstanding, I just want to get this thought before we close tonight. I won't hold you long. NOT WITHSTANDING, THE LORD stood with me. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; WHAT WAS HE REALIZING? I MAY EVERYBODY MIGHT HAVE LEFT. I MIGHT BE LAYING SICK IN A in a in A DUNGEON AND NOT ABLE TO DO WHAT I WANT TO DO, BUT YET THE LORD STOOD WITH ME. HALLELUJAH. THE LORD STOOD WITH ME AND STRENGTHENED ME. OH, SOMETIMES YOU JUST GOT TO GET DOWN BETWEEN YOU AND GOD AND SAY, "LORD, I KNOW YOU CAN STRENGTHEN ME. I KNOW YOU'RE HERE WITH ME. I KNOW YOU'LL NEVER LEAVE ME. YOU'LL never forsake me." Amen. &gt;&gt; The Lord stood WITH ME AND STRENGTHENED ME THAT BY ME THE PREACHING MIGHT BE FULLY KNOWN AND THAT ALL THE GENTILES MIGHT HEAR. I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion. Look at verse 18. Look how quickly THE VIEW CHANGES FROM TELLING US WHAT HE HE WAS OPEN AND HONEST WITH US. TOLD US WHAT HE WAS GOING THROUGH. BUT YET THE VIEW CHANGES. HE SAID, "AND THE LORD SHALL DELIVER ME." I WONDER HOW MANY OF US THAT ARE GOING THROUGH SOME THINGS WOULD SAY THE SAME THING TONIGHT. THE LORD [screaming] SHALL DELIVER ME. DON'T THERE'S NO REASON TO GET DESPONDENT. THERE'S NO REASON TO BE IN DEFEAT, BUT YOU YOU KNOW IF HE IS WITH YOU AND YOU'VE BEEN ACCEPTED IN THE BELOVED LIKE PAUL WAS ACCEPTED IN THE BELOVED, I KNOW HE'S WITH ME. OH, COME ON, CHURCH. I KNOW IT'S WEDNESDAY NIGHT, BUT WE OUGHT TO REJOICE IN THAT FACT. THE LORD IS STANDING WITH ME. AND THE LORD SHALL DELIVER ME FROM EVERY EVIL WORK. YOU OUGHT TO PUT THAT ON YOUR REFRIGERATOR. NO MATTER WHAT THE DEVIL DOES TO YOU, NO MATTER WHAT THE DOCTOR HAS TO DO, NO MATTER WHAT ANYBODY ELSE SAYS, THE LORD SHALL DELIVER ME FROM EVERY EVIL WORK. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [laughter] &gt;&gt; NO MATTER WHAT PEOPLE SAY, NO MATTER WHAT THE BOSS SAYS AT THE JOB, NO MATTER WHAT THE KIDS DO AT SCHOOL, NO MATTER WHAT ANYBODY ELSE DOES OR SAYS, THE Lord will deliver me &gt;&gt; and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom. Hallelujah. to whom be glory forever and ever. But the friend said, "Paul's lost his ministry." That's what Deeus must have thought. Why didn't if he had a gift of healing, why didn't he go up there and heal that buddy that has stood by him so faithful? He said, "I've left him up there sick. I ain't got no coat. I want you to bring me that coat along. Be careful. That copper smith just ruined the meeting in the city. Had to leave the town. He put me in jail. Imagine demon said, "What kind of a preacher has this turned out to be?" He said, "Brother, they got a lot of them demon spirits in the world today. They don't know what it's all about." No need trying to explain it to them because they won't get it anyhow. But a servant of Christ follows the footprints. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandon brings up a dream that Tony Zable had. He was a deacon there at the tabernacle. and he saw a dream that he was he saw a man standing I believe clothed in black and he went to him singing songs. He went to him and he realized he was his first pastor. And then he pointed him a little bit further down the road and he comes to the next man and he said he was singing songs and he said that was his second pastor. He said and then I saw another man dressed in what brother Brandham calls overalls. And sometimes in the message, Brother Random calls overalls jeans and jeans overalls. But in that place, he called him overalls. And he he looked up there and he said there was a man didn't look like a preacher, right? But he said he got a little closer. He realized it was me standing up there. He said he climbed up till he got to me and said, "I got him by the arm and led him on up till I got top of the hill. There was a wilderness to go through." And I said, "Tony, I must leave you here." &gt;&gt; Yeah. Now remember Jesus said, "I will never leave you." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; But brother Brandon was a man, &gt;&gt; right? And there's a point in our life, and I want you young people to understand this. And that's what brother Brandon is teaching us in leadership at the end of his life. He's telling us that brother Herald, a man can lead you so far. A PASTOR CAN LEAD YOU SO FAR. BUT SOME OF YOU ELDER PEOPLE, YOU know this is true. YOU CAN BE LED SO FAR, BUT BUT BUT THERE'LL ALWAYS BE A FRAILTY in a human being. There will be places they can't go with you. &gt;&gt; THERE'LL BE MOMENTS and seasons where they just can't. We wish they'd live forever. Wish our parents would live forever, but they can't. &gt;&gt; WE WISH OUR OUR LOVED ONES WOULD OH, AND HOPEFULLY everyone here will live to the see the coming OF THE LORD. BUT IF TIME GOES ON, WE REALIZE THAT NONE OF US LIVE FOREVER on this earth. &gt;&gt; Right? This mort mortal must put on immortality. We've got to be changed to live forever. &gt;&gt; AND SO THERE COMES A POINT WHERE BROTHER RAND SAID, "I'M going to have to leave you here. I brought YOU THIS FAR, BUT I'M GOING TO HAVE TO LEAVE YOU. I'M GOING GO, WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH A WILDERNESS ALONE. &gt;&gt; HE SAID, YOU MUST WALK SOME OF THIS BY YOURSELF. &gt;&gt; BUT YOU'RE NOT ALONE. &gt;&gt; COME ON. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WHEN YOUR PASTOR CAN'T BE THERE WHEN BROTHER JOEL CAN'T BE THERE, BROTHER STEWART AND ONE OF THE PREACHERS, LISTEN, HE SAID, "I'LL STILL BE THERE." &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [screaming] HE SAID, "I'LL BE WITH YOU AND EVEN IN YOU to the end of the age." &gt;&gt; He said, "You must walk some of this by yourself." And he said, "Brother Brandon, what can I do from here on?" I said, "Come here, Tony. Look down there. Oh, church. YOU SEE THEM BAREFOOTED TRACKS WITH BLOOD IN THEM. I said, "That's what I've followed all the way. JUST STAY ON THAT." THAT'S THE ONLY THING I KNOW TO POINT MAN TO. NOT TO A CREED or a sensation of some sort, but to those bloody footprints that leads TO THE BIBLE, THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST. OH GOD, LET ME POINT PEOPLE AWAY FROM THE ARM OF FLESH AND TO THE BLOODY FOOTPRINTS THAT EACH ONE OF US CAN follow &gt;&gt; and make it home because we are accepted not in the preacher or in the church but in him. &gt;&gt; See Paul said, "Be ye followers of me even as I also am of Christ." Those bloody footprints. Brother Brandham got a complex he thought no one listened to him. There's a pretty common thing for a preacher and you know and then he went to Or Robert's headquarters in Tulsa. He's already going through it and gets up there and sees that big building and I he said I was standing there. I got real melancholy. I got thinking, God, each one of the brothers said they've seen the ministry you gave me. It started them on the field. I said to that, I'm grateful we're all working for one big place up there called heaven. I said, I'm thankful for that. But I said, I suppose maybe you could couldn't trust me. This wasn't the Lord, by the way. This was brother Brandham &gt;&gt; because God did trust him. &gt;&gt; He held him in his hand. &gt;&gt; That ministry was held in the right hand of Christ. But he but this is the man talking. &gt;&gt; I suppose maybe you couldn't trust me. You knew I wouldn't be able take up money like that and I wouldn't have the intelligence to know what to do with it if I took it up. And I said, I guess it just happens to be that way. I was standing there kind of felt a little choked in my throat. He said, I just say this the truth. He said, I heard a voice just as plain as you hear me. Said, but I am your portion. Yes. &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I said, "Thank you, Lord. I'll go anywhere, any place, at any time. I want to do what you would have me to do." And thanking God. You realize Brother Brandham couldn't have done what he did if he'd had Oral Roberts building. I think I got the pictures of that. That was the building as it stood there in the 60s. I don't know how well you can see it. It's off of an old postcard, but it's a beautiful or a great big huge building. At the time, it was covered in concrete diamonds. They [snorts] made to look like diamonds. They just went over the top and making it making it huge and large and impressive. One of the most impressive buildings in Tulsa. And but right, I'm standing in that marble foyer. And I wish I'd have brought the pictures of the interior of this place. Now, go to the next slide. I think there's a picture. This was this year they were actually taking off the marble exterior because it's falling apart. And you CAN GO ONLINE AND FIND PICTURES of of the inside that it's completely rusted and molded and and and decayed and nobody does anything in it. AND BROTHER BRANDHAM STOOD IN THAT BUILDING AND SAYS, 'WELL, I MAYBE GOD DON'T TRUST ME. BUT GOD BUILT A MINISTRY WITH WILLIAM BRANDHAM that would last SOMETHING THAT IN HARDY, ARKANSAS, WE'RE QUOTING TONIGHT BECAUSE HE DIDN'T GO FOR THE BUILDING. BUT GOD DID TRUSTED HIM WITH SOMETHING GREATER THAN A BUILDING. GOD DIDN'T TRUST HIM WITH MONEY OR A BUILDING, BUT HE TRUSTED HIM WITH HIS BRIDE. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; TO BE THAT ELEER THAT WOULD CALL OUT REBECCA. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; TRUSTED SERVANT. &gt;&gt; WE DON'T ALWAYS KNOW WHAT'S COMING. WE MAY LOOK AT SOMEBODY'S LIFE ON INSTAGRAM OR FACEBOOK OR SOMETHING ELSE AND SAY, "WELL, MY LIFE ISN'T MUCH. I DON'T HAVE VERY MUCH GOING FOR ME." WE MAY LOOK AT ANOTHER CHURCH OR SOMETHING ELSE AND SAY, "WELL, WE DON'T HAVE VERY MUCH COMPARED TO THEM." DON'T LOOK AT WHERE YOU'RE AT RIGHT NOW. LOOK AT WHETHER OR NOT YOU ARE ACCEPTED IN THE BELOVED. AND IF YOU ARE ACCEPTED IN THE BELOVED, YOU ARE YOU ARE ONE OF HIS. HE'LL BE WITH YOU ALL THE WAY. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I love this. Hebrews 13:5 as we close the musicians come. Paul says, "Let your conversation, let your lifestyle be without covetousness." It's like he's speaking right to brother Brandham in that situation and speaking to us tonight. Let let your lifestyle be your manner of life be without covetousness. Don't don't want what other people have, right? Because God gave other people what they have for a reason. Be content with such things as you have. That's so hard, isn't it? Especially in this age when you could get a credit card, you know, and buy it. Brother Caleb, I I don't want to embarrass you, but I watched Brother Caleb's family when [snorts] they came here a few years ago and when I first came and [music] Caleb was living in the fellowship hall at the time and he upgraded or maybe downgraded and moved out to a little trailer I know one thing I I wouldn't have dared to do that. And yet yet I you know if we had to that we'd do it but that didn't seem like much. And finally built a little house nice little house. They've got a nice little place there and not very big. But Caleb, you don't know how rich a man you are because [snorts] your family stayed, huh, in that little trailer. Didn't complain that much that I remember as I remember it. [music] They stayed there and hauled water, you know, did the things that But what the treasure was that you got people who are with you during that time. So Paul says, don't don't let your conversation let your lifestyle be without covetousness. So you don't want what somebody else has cuz what you have is enough, &gt;&gt; right? And it's it it's of such extreme value because how many people I look at this church and I know all of us have been through things in one way or another. Whether you're here recently, come recently or in the past, but you've been through some things. All of us have. All of us have a history. We've got a background. And you MAY LOOK AT SOMEBODY ELSE AND COMPARE YOUR LIFE WITH SOMEBODY ELSE AND SAY, "WELL, BUT THE VALUE OF IT IS THAT ALL THIS TIME HE NEVER FORSOOK YOU." LOOK WHAT HE SAYS. IF YOU'RE YOU CONTENT WITH WHAT YOU HAVE, HE HAS SAID, "I WILL NEVER LEAVE thee nor forsake thee." And I'm marveled at the fact that Caleb and Sophie could live there and then do what they've done with the church and move on from that and do what they did. And I thank God and them kids are so blessed to have parents like that. And I'm not just bragging on them. Every one of you know in your own lives, YOU PUT UP WITH THINGS AND and deprivation because you want to be in the house of God. YOU WANT, OH GOD, [laughter] AND AND AND YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH SOME THINGS, BUT YET THAT YOU SAW GREATER VALUE. SEE, MOSES LOOKED BEYOND THE TREASURES OF EGYPT, AND HE SAID, "I COULD HAVE A GOOD JOB. I COULD BE THE KING AND PRINCE OF OF EGYPT AND BASICALLY THE king of the earth at that time." BUT HE SAID, HE SAW CHRIST. HE LOOKED AT THE unseen and saw THE WORD WAS MORE IMPORTANT. AND THERE'S SOME THINGS MORE IMPORTANT THAN MONEY. THERE'S SOME THINGS MORE IMPORTANT THAN A GOOD JOB. THERE'S SOME THINGS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THOSE THINGS. I believe in having a JOB. I BELIEVE IN MAKING MONEY, but some things are more important. And remember, when you get to the lowest point of that, he said, I will never leave you or forsake you. And what value is there? If there's value in a wife and a family that won't, are you with me now? That'll put up with those things in order to achieve a better life. HOW MUCH TIME DID HE HOW MANY TIMES DID HE PUT UP WITH YOU WHEN YOU WERE IN SIN AND YOU WERE LOST AND YOUR HOUSE DIDN'T LOOK VERY GOOD AND THINGS didn't look like they were very you there wasn't much going for you but he said I won't leave you [snorts] verse six so that we may boldly say [gasps] oh we there ought to be hands up all over the building right NOW THE LORD IS MY HELPER AND WE CAN SAY AMEN TO THAT TO THE LORD IS MY HELPER I DON'T KNOW HOW WE MADE IT, EVEN WHERE WE MADE IT. BUT THE LORD IS MY HELPER. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Some of y'all, I won't call your name, but some of y'all got married and I thought, well, I don't know if that I don't know if y'all can make it, but the Lord is my helper. &gt;&gt; Some of us have been THROUGH SOME THINGS. WE DIDN'T THINK WE'D MAKE IT, BUT THE LORD IS MY HELPER. HE WALKED WITH ME IN A MOMENT WHEN THE PASTOR COULDN'T AND NOBODY ELSE COULD, BUT HE WAS RIGHT THERE WITH ME. OH, WE OUGHT TO REJOICE IN THAT TONIGHT. WE MIGHT BOLDLY SAY TONIGHT AND REJOICE IN THIS FACT, THE LORD IS MY HELPER. I WILL NOT FEAR WHAT MAN SHALL DO UNTO ME. I I WILL NOT HAVE A COMPLEX ABOUT NOT BEING ACCEPTED BY PEOPLE BECAUSE the Lord is my helper. I'VE BEEN ACCEPTED IN THE BELOVED. WE have redemption through his blood. Hallelujah. Let's follow those bloody footprints leading us home. Would you bow your head with me tonight? And oh God, excuse me for getting personal tonight, but I just I love each and every one of you tonight. Every one of you. I've seen some of the things you come through and I know that he's here [music] with you and able to help you so that you can boldly say, "The Lord is my helper and I will not fear what man shall do unto me." Oh, he's here tonight. If you [music] if you want to just throw your hand up to him and say, "Lord, I know you're my helper. I want to worship you in that. I want to thank you for that. I've come a mighty long way. You brought me through many things and the people that you gave me have stuck with me. I'm so thankful. I'm so grateful, Lord, that you brought me such a mighty long way [snorts] to stand here in your presence and say, "I know I will never be forsaken [music] by you." Heavenly Father, we love you tonight and we thank you, oh God. I thank you tonight for your mercy and your grace and your [music] goodness. I pray that you'd walk with us, Lord. Help us to follow those bloody footprints. We've been through some things, but you're the one who brought us through. We've seen the hard side of life, but you're the one who made it made it real and kept us during that time. I pray that you'd help us tonight. Keep us. We thank you for it, Lord. I pray that you'd move in a mighty way, Lord, that your presence would be with these people, that you'd help them, Lord, as they think back on their lives, Lord, and think of what you brought them through. Maybe there's someone here that's never received the baptism of the Holy Ghost. May they realize tonight and come to that revelation and that baptism, oh God, that they would know that they are accepted in the beloved and that's enough. Lord, we thank you for that in Jesus name. Amen. Oh, when he reached, &gt;&gt; aren't you glad he reached way down for me? Hallelujah. Oh, I'm so glad to reach way down. &gt;&gt; What have he done for you tonight, church? You might as well worship him for a minute. What has he done for each and every one of us? Oh, I was lost and undone without God [singing] for his son when he reach &gt;&gt; down for me. I was nearing despair. Let's sing that now. &gt;&gt; Oh, I was nearing [singing] despair. Do you remember what that was like when he came [singing] to be there and he showed me Hallelujah that I Hallelujah could be free. &gt;&gt; Oh then he [singing] lifted my feet. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He gave me glory. [singing] &gt;&gt; Why don't you stand and give him praise tonight? Give me prayer. The altar's open. Now his hand for me. [singing] Sing it now with all your heart.

[singing and music] Oh, I was lost and undone without God without God or [singing] his son or his son. When he reached [singing] down his hand for me. &gt;&gt; Since the Lord gave me peace. &gt;&gt; Oh, since the [singing] Lord gave me peace. Heavenly joy never cease. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, I give [singing] all my life unto thee. [music] &gt;&gt; Oh guide my feet, hold my [music and singing] hand, oh grant with thee, I stand. [singing and music] Oh, you reach down his hand for me. &gt;&gt; Sing that chorus down with all your heart. Oh, I'm glad he reached &gt;&gt; down your hand for me.
