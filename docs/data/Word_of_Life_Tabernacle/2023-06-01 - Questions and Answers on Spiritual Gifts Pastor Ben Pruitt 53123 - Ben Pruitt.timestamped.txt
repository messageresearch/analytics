[43:24] Heavenly Father we're so grateful to be
[43:26] in your house tonight and the Lord just
[43:28] stand here with those of like Precious
[43:31] Faith who've been bought by your blood

[43:36] grateful for that today Lord and Lord we

[43:49] word of the hour I pray that you'd help
[43:51] us Lord and all that we do Lord maybe
[43:54] there's some need represented here
[43:55] tonight that I wouldn't know I pray
[43:58] you'd move me Lord out of the way and
[43:59] speak directly to that need tonight or
[44:02] whatever kind of service we need to have
[44:05] Lord we submit that to you tonight and
[44:07] we trust you we believe that you'll do
[44:10] it and you'll work in the way that only
[44:12] you can will give you the praise and the
[44:14] glory and the honor for that in Jesus
[44:16] name
[44:18] amen
[44:19] amen God bless you this evening we're
[44:23] going to go to Ephesians 4 7 Ephesians 4
[44:27] verses 7 and 8.
[44:30] I want to just answer a couple of
[44:32] questions actually we have five
[44:34] questions if we get to them all tonight
[44:36] and then we'll be done on the gifts I
[44:40] hope it's been a blessing to you there's
[44:42] a purpose to it and and uh you know
[44:45] sometimes you you come to church and you
[44:48] think well I'm not going to get anything
[44:49] out of this service and that's usually
[44:51] the case but if you come expecting that
[44:54] God can move things around to to speak
[44:58] directly to you then that that'll be the
[45:02] case as well and so how many are
[45:04] expecting the Lord to speak to them
[45:05] tonight amen God bless you Ephesians 4 7
[45:09] but unto every one of us
[45:12] that's all of us
[45:14] is given Grace according to the measure
[45:17] of the gift of Christ
[45:20] wherefore he saith when he ascendeth
[45:23] ascended up on high he led captivity
[45:25] captive and gave gifts unto men I pray
[45:29] the Lord with that is blessing to the
[45:30] word you may be seated
[45:33] brother Branham taught us in in
[45:35] questions and answers that he said the
[45:37] reason we do this is to kind of find out
[45:39] what's on the hearts of the people
[45:41] and I will say this not very many people
[45:44] ask questions but the ones that do
[45:46] generally ask questions that everybody
[45:48] else was thinking as well I know it's
[45:50] hard with questions because uh a lot of
[45:53] times the questions the good questions
[45:55] that you have you forget about them you
[45:57] have them while the sermon's going on
[45:59] and then you forget about them later so
[46:01] if you've forgotten the question want to
[46:03] ask me later that'll be fine as well but
[46:05] maybe the question that someone else had
[46:07] will help you as well tonight he said I
[46:10] think that's very good for a pastor to
[46:11] give out this
[46:13] and then he finds out just about what
[46:15] the people's thinking about if they'll
[46:17] write their questions they have
[46:18] something he said I think every one of
[46:19] us is Duty bound to expel our thoughts
[46:22] to our pastors and their there's a
[46:24] lesson here on communication that we
[46:27] it's not just a one-way Street I know I
[46:29] get to stand up here and talk to you all
[46:31] the time but you do get to talk back
[46:34] just not during the service but you you
[46:36] do get to talk back you have a right to
[46:38] question and to ask questions with an
[46:41] honest heart and that don't mean that
[46:43] you're dumb or or you're ignorant it
[46:46] just means that you want to learn and so
[46:48] there's no such thing as a stupid
[46:50] question uh if we could say it that way
[46:52] he said we're Duty bound to expel our
[46:55] thoughts to our pastors and our
[46:56] spiritual leaders and so forth and
[46:58] anything that we see that so we can make
[47:00] everything run smooth and fine for the
[47:02] kingdom of God's sake so I want to get
[47:04] to the first one tonight was on healing
[47:06] and we all need healing don't we we live
[47:10] in bodies that need to be healed and we
[47:12] we touched on this on gifts of healing
[47:15] during uh during the series on the gifts
[47:19] if you want to go back and listen to
[47:20] that
[47:21] but the question was this they shall lay
[47:23] hands on the sick and they shall recover
[47:25] does the person who is sick have to
[47:27] agree slash want to be healed or is it
[47:30] on the faith of the anointed one praying
[47:33] and I think the simple answer to that is
[47:36] healing is based on your faith the faith
[47:39] of the individual being prayed for but I
[47:42] want to dig into that just a little bit
[47:44] if you'll give me some time tonight to
[47:46] dig into that that uh you know we
[47:49] believe in laying hands on the sick
[47:51] because in Mark 16 and 18 it says they
[47:54] shall take up serpents if they drink any
[47:56] deadly thing it shall not hurt them they
[47:58] shall lay hands on the sick and they
[48:00] shall recover
[48:01] Jesus was asked to do this most famously
[48:05] in Mark 5 22 there cometh one of the
[48:08] rulers of the synagogue Jairus by name
[48:10] when he saw him he fell at his feet and
[48:13] besought him greatly saying my little
[48:15] daughter lieth at the point of death I
[48:17] pray thee come and lay thy hands on
[48:19] Earth that she may be healed and she
[48:21] shall live that was where his faith was
[48:25] he said if you can come and lay your
[48:27] hands on my daughter she's going to be
[48:30] well but he had to have faith to ask
[48:33] so it's the faith of the person that's
[48:36] asking you can't just go lay hands on
[48:38] people that don't want it
[48:40] right and that's why many people the the
[48:43] point of a prayer line is not to it's
[48:45] not to get excited it's not to shout and
[48:49] yet you you would if you really
[48:50] understood what was taking place that
[48:52] you met the conditions of the Bible
[48:55] and but but it's because you come with a
[48:57] need on your heart and it may be a
[48:59] little thing I've taught my children
[49:01] that if there's a prayer line they need
[49:03] to go through it
[49:05] and there's a reason for that because
[49:06] there's always something that we need
[49:09] there's something and it may be
[49:11] something well I'm not as close to God
[49:12] as I want to be but if there's an
[49:14] opportunity I've taught them go go
[49:16] through the prayer line and and and I do
[49:19] it myself every time we have a prayer
[49:20] line I don't know if you all realize it
[49:22] but most of the time I will actually go
[49:24] through the prayer line at the end
[49:26] because I want to I want to participate
[49:29] in that I've got needs too I I've got
[49:31] things that I don't want hands laid on
[49:33] me that that don't make you a sinner
[49:35] don't want to have hands laid on you it
[49:38] means you have faith for healing
[49:41] so Jairus had faith and yet there's an
[49:43] even greater Faith than that
[49:45] now brother Branham said he said if he
[49:48] speaking of Christ was standing here
[49:49] right now wearing this suit he'd
[49:52] probably have to get one that was
[49:53] smaller
[49:55] but if he was standing here wearing this
[49:57] suit
[49:57] he could not heal you unless you
[49:59] believed him
[50:02] I like that
[50:03] he could not heal you
[50:05] Jesus could not just stand there and
[50:07] heal people
[50:08] they had to believe in fact the Bible
[50:10] says there was many that were not healed
[50:12] because of their unbelief I say Lord
[50:14] help me to believe
[50:16] help me to believe
[50:18] now he said he could tell you what was
[50:20] your trouble a lot of things like that
[50:21] but he couldn't heal you because he's
[50:23] already done it by his stripes we were
[50:25] healed let me believe that tonight is
[50:28] that right he said already over he said
[50:29] it's done done I like that it's done
[50:33] done every person he said now listen
[50:35] close this week I've tried to get you
[50:37] now he's moving towards something else
[50:39] he said I've tried to get you to see the
[50:41] greater way of doing it he said now
[50:43] there was a Jew one time that said come
[50:45] lay your hands on my daughter and she
[50:46] shall live and that was a Jewish custom
[50:48] laying on of hands but the Roman the
[50:51] Gentile said I'm not worthy that you
[50:53] come under my roof just speak the word
[50:56] when you see his word made manifest he
[50:58] said not only with me but with you he
[51:01] said and this is how it works now he
[51:03] says my faith in a gift
[51:05] so you want the person that's praying to
[51:09] have faith in what they're who they are
[51:11] right brother said Jesus had perfect
[51:13] faith in who he was and that's why he
[51:16] could cast The Devil out of the
[51:17] epileptic child
[51:19] right he had perfect faith in who he was
[51:21] he said the devil doesn't get scared at
[51:23] screaming and hollering and shouting he
[51:25] gets scared when he sees a life
[51:27] he sees the life oh that's the kind of
[51:29] life that I want he sees a Life coming
[51:32] and and he saw that Jesus knew who he
[51:35] was and so he stood there knowing who he
[51:37] was was able to do what the disciples
[51:39] could not do so but he said he hadn't he
[51:42] he said it's not made manifest not only
[51:44] with me but with you my faith in a gift
[51:46] your faith in the god that sent the gift
[51:49] and see it working between us he said
[51:52] that's God
[51:54] he said I just wish I could get that to
[51:56] every one of you see if your pastor lays
[51:58] hands on you you've got to have faith
[52:00] that in your pastor that he's a man of
[52:03] God but but I can't just that alone
[52:05] won't do it you got to have faith in God
[52:07] that there's something Supernatural
[52:09] something more than your pastor and then
[52:12] when you have hands laid on you then you
[52:14] can go and say hey I've come according
[52:16] to God's word God's word said that was
[52:19] more than a pastor that was God's word
[52:21] that said I could be healed I would be
[52:24] healed
[52:25] so now I I have to have confidence in my
[52:28] own life or I can't lay hands on you and
[52:31] believe for your healing
[52:33] right brother Branham dealt with that he
[52:34] couldn't pray for the baby because he
[52:36] had lied on the phone you remember the
[52:37] story
[52:39] so if you're going to pray for somebody
[52:40] you need to have confidence in your own
[52:42] life
[52:43] that you that that you're going to pray
[52:45] for that person but then on the other
[52:46] side it's in the faith of the person
[52:49] that's where really the healing gets
[52:51] because sometimes there could even be a
[52:53] man that didn't have that wasn't living
[52:56] right could lay hands on somebody and
[52:58] that person could still get healed
[53:01] and the reason for that is because of
[53:03] the person's faith
[53:05] now he said I wish I could get he said
[53:09] every one of you to see every one of you
[53:11] if I could only get this little group to
[53:12] see that he said there'll be another
[53:14] Pentecost happen right now if I could
[53:16] get you to really comprehend what it is
[53:19] let's go look at at the Centurion for a
[53:22] minute see how see how he did it because
[53:25] this is that greater thing that Brandon
[53:27] said he was trying to get the people to
[53:30] he said when Jesus was entering into
[53:31] Capernaum there came unto him a
[53:33] centurion beseeching him and saying Lord
[53:35] my servant laugh at home sick of the
[53:37] palsy grievously tormented
[53:40] and Jesus says unto him I will come and
[53:43] heal him
[53:44] he offered
[53:46] to come to the house
[53:48] and I'll be honest with you I'm not
[53:49] turning that down
[53:51] Jesus said I'll come and heal him hey
[53:54] let's have the prayer line
[53:56] but the Centurion doesn't understand
[53:58] their customs
[54:00] right he's kind of like the people we
[54:02] dealt with in Egypt or something we deal
[54:04] with overseas they don't understand and
[54:06] so they just believe
[54:08] he's like he said well you know you're a
[54:12] man of authority he said Lord I'm not
[54:14] worthy that that has come under my
[54:16] roof and see my television
[54:19] I just made that part up
[54:22] he said but speak the word only
[54:26] I like that
[54:28] he said I'm not a guy
[54:31] I'm not worthy to have you come under my
[54:32] roof but speak the word
[54:34] see he's not bound by tradition
[54:37] he doesn't expect God to move in any
[54:39] certain way
[54:41] you don't believe we don't understand
[54:43] the power that's in that if we could
[54:46] come expecting God to do whatever God
[54:47] wants to do that on a Wednesday night he
[54:50] could heal the sick he could he could
[54:52] cleanse the leper he could he could
[54:54] restore the fallen on a Wednesday night
[54:56] on a Sunday morning on a regular service
[54:58] if we could just expect God even not
[55:01] even in church
[55:02] if we could expect God to move on the
[55:05] job
[55:06] see he said you don't have to be here
[55:08] right
[55:10] he said speak the word only my servant
[55:12] shall be healed for I am a man under
[55:13] Authority having soldiers under me and I
[55:16] say to this man go and he goeth to
[55:18] another come and he cometh unto my
[55:20] servant do this and he doeth it
[55:22] and when Jesus heard it he marveled
[55:24] and he said to them that followed verily
[55:26] I say unto you I have not found so great
[55:29] faith no not in Israel
[55:32] because they had a custom of laying on
[55:34] of hands but this was this was greater
[55:37] and yet it does not do away with laying
[55:38] on of hands it's something we need
[55:41] because I'll be honest with you I need
[55:43] sometimes I don't have as much Faith as
[55:45] I should have and I need I need to I
[55:49] need you to help me I need I need you to
[55:51] I need you to agree with me
[55:54] and that's what laying on of hands is
[55:57] that's you and me agreeing
[56:00] and putting our faith together
[56:02] so brother Brandon called it a Jewish
[56:04] custom because it's Deuteronomy 34 9
[56:07] Joshua the son of none was full of the
[56:09] spirit of wisdom for Moses had laid his
[56:11] hands upon him he laid his hands upon
[56:13] him and what what he was doing he was he
[56:16] was sanctioning him
[56:18] see Moses didn't put the spirit of
[56:20] wisdom in Joshua but he was sanctioning
[56:23] the spirit that was there there's a new
[56:24] testament parallel with Timothy Paul
[56:27] said stir up the gift that's in you he
[56:29] said by that by he said which was given
[56:31] you by prophecy and the laying on of
[56:33] hands of the Presbytery or the elders
[56:35] and brother Brandon said they weren't
[56:37] giving him the gift because gifts and
[56:38] callings are without repentance but they
[56:40] were they were sanctioning the gift
[56:43] the gift had to be sanctioned and what
[56:46] we're doing is it gives you confidence
[56:48] because I'm sanctioning the word that is
[56:52] true I'm saying it's true you're saying
[56:54] it's true and we agree together
[56:56] right and that's why laying on of hands
[56:59] works
[57:00] because I believe it and you believe it
[57:04] so and so again it's it takes both but
[57:07] you have to have faith you have to have
[57:09] faith where it doesn't do any good and
[57:11] and so you can't convey an office to
[57:13] someone by laying on of hands you can
[57:15] only sanction the office they have from
[57:17] God brother Brandon says I come not to
[57:19] heal the sick he said I come to pray for
[57:21] God's sick children God heal for sick
[57:23] the sick is already healed but anyone
[57:25] knows that he said I didn't come to save
[57:27] the lost I come to tell the Lost are
[57:29] already saved if they'll just accept it
[57:32] have come to tell those who have been
[57:34] saved and once this evidence that
[57:35] they've got the assurance and tasted the
[57:37] Heavenly gifts from across Jordan Yonder
[57:39] as Hebrews 6 said they would but made
[57:42] partakers of the Holy Ghost and tasted
[57:43] Heavenly gifts he said now if you're
[57:45] sick tonight I say to you that one that
[57:47] I'm talking about when he died at
[57:49] Calvary right there the stripes across
[57:51] his back and the sight of God purchased
[57:53] your healing you are already healed
[57:56] and he goes on he talks about the
[57:58] Pentecostal group who believed in gifts
[58:00] giving gifts by laying on of hands and
[58:02] how they made that mistake he said we
[58:04] might recognize them and our hands on
[58:06] them as Paul did Timothy there to
[58:07] sanction it he said knowing that he the
[58:10] gift was in him they've seen it work he
[58:12] said they'd just give him the right hand
[58:13] to Fellowship like to bring him into the
[58:16] service of God
[58:17] he said and that's listen that's the
[58:19] only thing we do
[58:20] by laying our hands on the sickness
[58:22] there's no miraculous power
[58:24] in the hands of the person
[58:28] right do we all understand that
[58:30] there's no power in that
[58:32] the power is in the faith of the person
[58:36] but we're sanctioning that
[58:39] so he said that's the only thing we do
[58:40] by laying our hands on the sick when
[58:42] they're sick because Jesus said these
[58:44] signs shall follow them that believe he
[58:46] said the people that believed would lay
[58:48] their hands on the sick as a sanction
[58:50] that they believed it
[58:53] all right so it's the exact same thing
[58:55] we do with deacons when we ordain
[58:56] deacons they're we're not we're not uh
[58:59] we can't we can't make them something
[59:01] God didn't make them
[59:03] ordained preachers we can't make them
[59:05] something God didn't make them but we're
[59:07] sanctioning the gift that's already
[59:09] there
[59:10] he said he said now the people that
[59:13] believed would lay their hands on the
[59:14] sick the people that believed would lay
[59:17] their hands on the sick and as a
[59:19] sanction that they believed it now the
[59:21] Bible said these signs shall follow them
[59:23] that believe if they lay hands on the
[59:25] sick they shall recover that's exactly
[59:26] right he said now that's under
[59:28] conditions if you believe it
[59:31] he said now I believe this God's proved
[59:34] it to you I believe it he said you see
[59:36] he manifests his word to show that it is
[59:39] his word
[59:40] so he's telling the people and this is
[59:42] when brother branham's in the prayer
[59:43] line about to begin the prayer line in
[59:44] perfect Faith he said he manifests this
[59:46] word to show you that it is his word a
[59:49] scripture fulfillment so brother Brandon
[59:51] has already been through the discernment
[59:53] he's discerned the hearts of some of
[59:55] those that sat in the audience so he
[59:57] said I believe this I believe God's
[59:59] proved his word to you he said now you
[1:00:02] believe he said when you passed by he
[1:00:05] said will you do it and and so that's
[1:00:06] how they received their healings by
[1:00:08] agreeing with him and then he laid his
[1:00:11] hands on them now
[1:00:13] if you had the same confidence
[1:00:17] when he believed the word written about
[1:00:19] himself
[1:00:20] if you had that same kind of confidence
[1:00:22] when you come through a prayer line or
[1:00:24] come and ask your pastor to pray for you
[1:00:26] or someone else to pray for you you
[1:00:28] would leave there shouting the victory
[1:00:31] that's what brother random said he said
[1:00:33] you would leave shouting because you
[1:00:35] believe it's done
[1:00:37] amen amen so it's in your faith
[1:00:42] so now the second question is more on on
[1:00:45] the line of Deliverance
[1:00:47] in a in a mental health issue
[1:00:50] who worships the demons can they be
[1:00:52] delivered by the prayers of the Bride or
[1:00:54] do they have to want Deliverance
[1:00:56] now this is this one
[1:00:59] I had to think about this one
[1:01:02] because a person without any mental
[1:01:04] faculties could not worship I don't
[1:01:06] believe they could worship a demon if
[1:01:09] they'd never had any mental faculties
[1:01:11] because you have to worship god with
[1:01:14] your body Soul and Spirit with your
[1:01:16] heart with your mind and you would have
[1:01:19] to worship a demon you would have to
[1:01:20] willfully worship you can't worship
[1:01:22] something uh in that sense I don't
[1:01:25] believe that you could worship that
[1:01:26] demon accidentally right you don't have
[1:01:29] to worry about that by the way say
[1:01:31] something would happen and you would
[1:01:32] lose your mind say all of a sudden well
[1:01:34] now I'm worshiping a demon you're not
[1:01:36] gonna you're still saved
[1:01:38] even if even if you lose your mental
[1:01:40] faculties I proved that half the time
[1:01:43] you know but you're still saved even if
[1:01:45] you're not smart praise God
[1:01:48] but you're saved even if you if you had
[1:01:50] a mental health issue but
[1:01:53] I don't believe that you could worship a
[1:01:55] demon in that condition but it would be
[1:01:57] like a child you understand a child they
[1:02:00] can't have faith for themselves but you
[1:02:03] have to have faith for them so that's
[1:02:05] different when you lay hands on a child
[1:02:07] a small child someone that's not come to
[1:02:09] the age of accountability that child up
[1:02:12] to a certain age State they can't even
[1:02:14] talk yet they can't have faith for
[1:02:15] themselves they can't understand the
[1:02:16] scripture but that's up to you and I
[1:02:19] right the same with someone who had a
[1:02:21] mental health issue
[1:02:23] now
[1:02:24] were they where this is taken from is
[1:02:27] the maniac in Portland you remember the
[1:02:29] maniac and Portland come in front of
[1:02:31] brother Branham it's a great story it
[1:02:33] comes in front of brother Branham in
[1:02:34] that great meeting and gotten out of the
[1:02:36] insane institution and he comes before
[1:02:38] brother random he says I'm going to
[1:02:39] knock you into Yesterday basically and
[1:02:42] and he comes up there and when he comes
[1:02:44] and brother Brandon said brother Brandon
[1:02:46] said he loved him
[1:02:48] and he tells us that in in the uh love
[1:02:51] and the sermon on love he said he loved
[1:02:52] him and he did not fear him but he said
[1:02:54] you'll fall over my feet
[1:02:56] right and the maniac fell over his feet
[1:02:58] and they asked him they said is is he
[1:03:01] delivered and he said no
[1:03:03] he said he worships the demon
[1:03:06] and but listen the way the way he says
[1:03:08] that he said I said no sir he worships
[1:03:10] that spirit
[1:03:12] see he said he'd bring it right back to
[1:03:14] him because he thinks he's right
[1:03:17] so in other words if you put him in his
[1:03:19] sound mind he would he because he
[1:03:21] worshiped that demon before he got sick
[1:03:25] that's what put him in that condition
[1:03:27] he'll worship it again
[1:03:29] now there's there's cases like that
[1:03:31] where a person say could get delivered
[1:03:33] of alcohol or drugs or a sexual
[1:03:35] addiction they worship that demon and it
[1:03:38] got a hold of him that demon can be cast
[1:03:40] off of them in a service
[1:03:43] right and really be cast off
[1:03:46] but that person if they worship that
[1:03:48] devil they'll go right back to it
[1:03:50] now we don't know that but brother
[1:03:51] Branham being a prophet knew that that
[1:03:54] this man worshiped that demon so you
[1:03:56] could cat he said I could cast It Off
[1:03:59] the one brother random couldn't cast to
[1:04:01] The Devil out but it was that he would
[1:04:03] go right back to it
[1:04:05] as soon as he because he thinks he's
[1:04:07] right
[1:04:08] we need to align our thoughts to the
[1:04:10] word don't we
[1:04:12] we need to come to the word amen so so I
[1:04:15] think in a mental health issue to answer
[1:04:17] the question uh I think yes they could
[1:04:20] be delivered by the prayers of the Bride
[1:04:22] for someone who'd always been that way
[1:04:23] you would pray for healing for that
[1:04:25] person and and we wouldn't know if they
[1:04:28] if they worship that demon if that's the
[1:04:30] way that they are you just pray for
[1:04:31] people and you believe that God's able
[1:04:33] to overcome any situation
[1:04:37] now
[1:04:39] now and he's able he's able to heal
[1:04:41] mental as much as he is physical how
[1:04:43] many believe that tonight
[1:04:44] we live in an age where mental health
[1:04:47] has become a real issue
[1:04:49] especially with young people and and we
[1:04:51] see it here in the church he said well
[1:04:53] that don't bother us we know we're
[1:04:54] Christians that's not true we still live
[1:04:57] in this world where those little dots of
[1:04:59] light and all that blackness
[1:05:02] and there's a mental health crisis in
[1:05:04] the world and we see it come right in
[1:05:05] the church
[1:05:07] and and I don't want to condemn you for
[1:05:09] that but there's a the scripture we
[1:05:12] believe in healing so let the doctors do
[1:05:14] what they can do I I think there's
[1:05:16] situations where a person could take
[1:05:18] medicine or do something I wouldn't
[1:05:19] condemn them for that at all I would
[1:05:22] never do that because sometimes you got
[1:05:23] to get your mind right to be able to
[1:05:24] even even accept the gospel so there's
[1:05:27] situations where you would have to take
[1:05:29] medicine or even even have somebody to
[1:05:32] talk to in counseling or something like
[1:05:33] that but always remember put your faith
[1:05:36] in God
[1:05:37] and and when that counseling contradicts
[1:05:40] the word go with God
[1:05:42] not with the counseling
[1:05:44] we have more of that than what people
[1:05:46] realize it's just the age that we live
[1:05:48] in
[1:05:49] so the third question was on Prophecy
[1:05:53] prophecy what what is prophecy a sign of
[1:05:57] to the believer these are good questions
[1:05:59] what is prophecy a sign of to the
[1:06:01] believer well I would say it's a sign of
[1:06:04] God's presence it's a sign that he's
[1:06:06] there and they take that from First
[1:06:08] Corinthians 14 22 wherefore tongues are
[1:06:11] for a sign not to them that believe but
[1:06:13] to them that believe not but prophesying
[1:06:16] serveth not for them that believe not
[1:06:18] but for them which belief so tongues are
[1:06:20] assigned to the unbeliever what is
[1:06:23] prophecy a sign of it's a sign to the
[1:06:24] believer it's a sign of God's presence
[1:06:26] but Branham says this I love this quote
[1:06:28] he said I can show you where God put
[1:06:31] gifts and Power in the church I want
[1:06:33] somebody to put your finger on a
[1:06:35] scripture show me where he took it out
[1:06:38] I love that where he took it back from
[1:06:41] the church it's a super sign to the
[1:06:44] believer
[1:06:45] I'm glad you asked this question because
[1:06:47] it caused me to find this quote it's a
[1:06:50] super sign to the believer that we've
[1:06:52] passed from death into life because we
[1:06:55] feel the Holy Ghost and see it working
[1:06:57] on our lives changing us from what we
[1:06:59] were to what we are now so prophecy is a
[1:07:03] sign is assigned to the believer of his
[1:07:06] presence the super side but the random
[1:07:08] said when we see any of these gifts
[1:07:10] operating in that manner now
[1:07:14] prophecy and discernment let's talk
[1:07:16] about this for just a moment this is the
[1:07:18] fourth question kind of goes with the
[1:07:19] last one
[1:07:21] what is prophecy and how does it differ
[1:07:23] from discernment now I I talked about
[1:07:25] this in in one of the in the in the uh
[1:07:29] when I talked about prophets uh prophets
[1:07:32] prophecy and a prophet but when I talked
[1:07:35] about that I didn't deal as much with
[1:07:37] the gift of Prophecy as I did with a
[1:07:39] prophet and that was on purpose
[1:07:41] and we found you remember what we found
[1:07:43] out that there's a major prophet and
[1:07:46] then there are preachers a modern day
[1:07:48] preacher is a prophet
[1:07:50] right an inspired preacher inspired
[1:07:52] speaker is a prophet but what is the
[1:07:55] difference between that and discernment
[1:07:56] that's a good question Discerning means
[1:07:59] to judge we talked about that under
[1:08:01] discernment but let's bring the two
[1:08:03] together to discern a spirit is to judge
[1:08:06] whether it's right or not
[1:08:08] so discernment is not what brother
[1:08:11] Branham was doing the gift of
[1:08:13] discernment in First Corinthians 14 as
[1:08:17] far as I can tell
[1:08:18] that is not the same thing as what
[1:08:21] brother Branham was doing when he stood
[1:08:24] up and and used his gift he called it a
[1:08:27] gift of discernment but it was the word
[1:08:29] Discerning the thought sentence of the
[1:08:31] heart does everybody understand that it
[1:08:33] was a major prophet
[1:08:36] standing there and doing that but to
[1:08:39] discern the gift of discernment is to
[1:08:40] discern between Spirits judge whether
[1:08:43] something is right or wrong
[1:08:45] so a spirit of Prophecy
[1:08:47] is to be judged by discernment
[1:08:50] a spirit of Prophecy is to be judged by
[1:08:52] two or three that has discernment before
[1:08:54] it can ever be given to the church
[1:08:56] so prophecy is inspired foretelling
[1:09:00] of a future event
[1:09:02] or in the case of a minister forth
[1:09:05] telling of the word the Bible says the
[1:09:07] spirit the testimony of Jesus is the
[1:09:09] spirit of Prophecy so it's foretelling
[1:09:12] of a future event some something that's
[1:09:14] not in the scripture or in the case of a
[1:09:16] minister something in the scripture
[1:09:17] foretelling of the word
[1:09:20] so we have the gift of Prophecy today we
[1:09:23] believe that
[1:09:24] but what brother Branham did was unique
[1:09:27] was absolutely unique
[1:09:29] this was more than a gift of discernment
[1:09:31] this was more than a gift of Prophecy so
[1:09:34] how would a gift of Prophecy operate
[1:09:37] itself in this in the church well it
[1:09:39] would be that the prophet would speak
[1:09:42] inspired
[1:09:44] and he would say
[1:09:46] brother Joe next week's gonna have
[1:09:48] trouble at his work he needs to watch
[1:09:49] out there's going to be some extra work
[1:09:52] he's going to get tired and he's going
[1:09:54] to run off the road and it's like he
[1:09:55] needs to watch for that there's going to
[1:09:56] be a certain thing to happen today we we
[1:09:58] almost ran into a wreck and uh somebody
[1:10:02] had a wreck there in Mountain Home at
[1:10:04] the at the intersection and so maybe the
[1:10:06] gift would say well there's going to be
[1:10:08] a wreck there and you need to not be
[1:10:09] there at a certain time that's a gift of
[1:10:11] Prophecy
[1:10:12] you say can God really do that
[1:10:13] absolutely you can
[1:10:16] but now if a gift if a prophet stood up
[1:10:18] and said in the church and said thus
[1:10:20] saith the Lord the Lord is coming
[1:10:22] well that's good but that would be a
[1:10:23] preacher that would do that that's the
[1:10:25] job of the preacher it might be inspired
[1:10:28] but it's not his job to do that it's the
[1:10:30] job of the preacher because I can stand
[1:10:31] here and say thus saith the Lord the
[1:10:33] Lord is coming
[1:10:34] and if you're qualified to preach trust
[1:10:37] me I'll use you
[1:10:39] to preach because we need all the
[1:10:40] preachers we can get but we'll stand up
[1:10:42] here and say thus saith the Lord the
[1:10:44] Lord is coming that we can say that from
[1:10:46] the scripture so that would be prophecy
[1:10:48] as well but it would be forth telling of
[1:10:50] the word so do you understand that
[1:10:52] prophecy would be something direct to
[1:10:54] the people of God
[1:10:57] so and that's different from discernment
[1:10:59] discernment is is actually it's whether
[1:11:01] the prophecy is true or not and what but
[1:11:04] whatever the Branham had was Discerning
[1:11:06] the thought sentence of the heart and
[1:11:08] the Corinthians 14 gift of discernment
[1:11:10] is nothing like that it's it's as far as
[1:11:12] I can tell simply the ability to judge
[1:11:14] between Spirits right and wrong
[1:11:16] so now the last question was on dreams
[1:11:19] and Visions because this is something we
[1:11:21] didn't cover we're divisions and dreams
[1:11:24] fall under the nine spiritual gifts are
[1:11:27] you still with me tonight
[1:11:30] this is a good question because I didn't
[1:11:32] cover this at all
[1:11:33] uh how many of you dream
[1:11:38] some people don't dream most people
[1:11:39] dream
[1:11:41] but some people don't dream at all
[1:11:42] there'll be people say well I saw a
[1:11:44] dream once when I was a kid or maybe I
[1:11:46] never saw one
[1:11:48] uh how many of you have ever seen a
[1:11:49] vision
[1:11:51] there's a few of you that have seen a
[1:11:53] vision now the Bible tells us that he
[1:11:56] said your old men shall dream dreams
[1:11:57] your young men shall see Visions as a
[1:11:59] result of the outpouring of Joel 2 28
[1:12:01] this is scripture as a result of the
[1:12:03] outpouring of the Holy Spirit uh that
[1:12:05] there would be uh at Pentecost that
[1:12:07] there would be people that would dream
[1:12:09] dreams and see Visions in a spiritual
[1:12:11] way now I'll say this most of the dreams
[1:12:13] that we dream are not spiritual
[1:12:16] at least I'll speak for myself there
[1:12:19] right right
[1:12:20] and so we have to be careful to to know
[1:12:23] the difference and and I'll it's
[1:12:25] difficult it's very difficult it's why
[1:12:27] we don't leave the church by dreams
[1:12:30] they can be helpful but that's not the
[1:12:32] primary method of leading the church and
[1:12:34] I'm gonna show that to you in just a
[1:12:36] minute now in in uh brother said there's
[1:12:39] a difference between dreams and Visions
[1:12:40] dreams is when you go to sleep Visions
[1:12:42] is when you don't go to sleep he said
[1:12:44] we're born that way the ordinary human
[1:12:46] being when he dreams it's in his
[1:12:48] subconscious and his subconscious is way
[1:12:51] away from him so his senses is active as
[1:12:54] long as he's in his first conscience so
[1:12:56] what he has to do he has to go to sleep
[1:12:58] in order for that subconscious to get
[1:13:01] close enough for him to be able to dream
[1:13:04] right that's the average first that's
[1:13:05] the way I am I don't have to sleep for
[1:13:07] long I can be I can I can go to sleep if
[1:13:10] I take a five minute nap I Dreamed a
[1:13:12] five minute dream
[1:13:13] so that's I dream every every moment I
[1:13:16] think that I've ever been asleep I've
[1:13:17] been dreaming and that's just the way it
[1:13:19] is why I know they're not all spiritual
[1:13:23] but it's just the way that I sleep but
[1:13:25] dreams is when you go to sleep Visions
[1:13:28] he said when you don't go to sleep he
[1:13:30] said and so since this is active as long
[1:13:33] as he's in his first conscience he said
[1:13:34] in this conscience you're normal he said
[1:13:36] you see taste feel smelling here but
[1:13:39] when you're in your subconscious asleep
[1:13:41] you don't have neither see taste feel
[1:13:43] smell or here by the way I found out
[1:13:45] something the other day somebody asked
[1:13:47] said why doesn't everybody ever dream
[1:13:48] about cell phones
[1:13:50] think about it I don't know if you've
[1:13:52] ever seen a dream that involved a cell
[1:13:54] phone but I I don't guess anybody ever
[1:13:56] has you don't ever dream you have them
[1:13:57] in your hand all the time you never
[1:13:58] dream about them
[1:14:00] it's interesting
[1:14:01] it's like it's another conscience
[1:14:03] but
[1:14:04] that's not gospel it's just
[1:14:08] it
[1:14:10] and boy I got you thinking didn't I if I
[1:14:13] ever if I ever dreamed a dream involved
[1:14:14] a cell phone
[1:14:15] that's what they say in this conscience
[1:14:18] you're normal he said you taste feel
[1:14:20] smell and hear see taste fill smelling
[1:14:21] here but when you're in your
[1:14:22] subconscious of sleep you don't neither
[1:14:24] see taste feel smell or hear but there's
[1:14:26] something when you dream that you return
[1:14:28] back to this conscience so you you go
[1:14:30] back and you relive some things he said
[1:14:33] there's a memory that you remember
[1:14:34] something you dreamed about years ago he
[1:14:36] said the ordinary human being is that
[1:14:38] way but when God predestinates something
[1:14:40] this subconscious is not away from here
[1:14:43] to the Seer but both Consciousness is
[1:14:45] right together
[1:14:47] and the Seer in a vision doesn't go to
[1:14:49] sleep he's still in his senses and sees
[1:14:52] it
[1:14:52] he said I was explaining that for some
[1:14:54] doctors the other day and they raised up
[1:14:55] and said marvelous never even thought of
[1:14:57] such a thing he said when I was taking a
[1:14:59] wave test which I think what he's
[1:15:01] talking about is an EEG he said he said
[1:15:03] when I was taking a wave test and they
[1:15:05] said they had never seen anything like
[1:15:07] that said well said there's something
[1:15:09] happens to you I said I I told it he
[1:15:11] said that's it exactly so they could
[1:15:13] actually see brother Brandon's brain
[1:15:16] responding to the vision that's
[1:15:18] interesting isn't it
[1:15:19] so the two Consciousness sit right close
[1:15:21] together he said it's nothing I could do
[1:15:23] he said don't make me no more than no
[1:15:25] anybody else it's just God made it that
[1:15:27] way see the dreamer is no more than one
[1:15:29] that Don't Dream It's just the way it is
[1:15:31] the one who sees Vision God just made
[1:15:33] them a certain way
[1:15:34] he said you don't go to sleep he said
[1:15:36] stand here on the platform talking to
[1:15:38] people you hear me going divisions and
[1:15:39] come back he said when I'm riding in a
[1:15:41] car with you anywhere else to tell you
[1:15:43] things that's going to happen and never
[1:15:44] fails now here's a major prophet and
[1:15:47] here's the difference in someone that
[1:15:48] just has a vision because you could
[1:15:50] right that's part of that's scriptural
[1:15:52] to have a vision
[1:15:54] but here's a major prophet it never
[1:15:56] fails
[1:15:58] right he said has anybody ever seen it
[1:16:00] fail
[1:16:01] the congregation says no no sir it can't
[1:16:03] fail it won't fail as long as it's gone
[1:16:07] he said notice right on the platform
[1:16:09] thousands before tens of thousands of
[1:16:10] people even in other languages I can't
[1:16:13] even speak he said still it don't fail
[1:16:15] it's God
[1:16:17] you see brother Branham I don't want to
[1:16:19] be careful and say this but we've seen a
[1:16:21] lot of people that act spiritual I had a
[1:16:24] preacher's kid the other day and someone
[1:16:25] who's been raised in a pastor's home he
[1:16:27] told me he said he said you know he said
[1:16:29] I asked my dad he said why is it that
[1:16:31] it's always the spiritual ones that
[1:16:33] cause the most trouble
[1:16:37] uh but you know I will say I I you know
[1:16:41] when you move in the spiritual realm
[1:16:42] you're nervous you're excitable and so
[1:16:45] that could be a real thing but it does
[1:16:48] seem like that but but brother Brown
[1:16:49] didn't have to act spiritual
[1:16:51] you'd have to let people know that he
[1:16:53] was spiritual he was spiritual he was a
[1:16:54] prophet it's just what he was he was
[1:16:57] never not a prophet
[1:16:59] he always was a prophet just like you
[1:17:02] were always a Christian
[1:17:03] you were predestined to be a Christian
[1:17:06] aren't you glad for that nothing could
[1:17:08] take that away from you
[1:17:09] uh a real preacher nothing will take
[1:17:12] that gift away from their life right
[1:17:14] that's what they are it's just who they
[1:17:16] are
[1:17:17] so he said when you uh hear a prophet
[1:17:20] Rising he said this got all the answers
[1:17:22] to every gimmick now listen to this that
[1:17:24] you can bring up remember he's not a
[1:17:26] prophet
[1:17:27] so brother Brown didn't have to put on
[1:17:29] pretend to know things he didn't know
[1:17:31] he said today they've got to know
[1:17:33] everything when you're going to have a
[1:17:35] toothache when you're going to have a
[1:17:36] tummy ache everything else tell you all
[1:17:38] about it he said that isn't the nature
[1:17:40] of our God he said watch the prophets
[1:17:42] watch Jesus in other words watch their
[1:17:44] life he talked about how Jesus only did
[1:17:47] what the father told him to do
[1:17:49] and how Paul uh was there and here he
[1:17:52] will disgrace prophet of God yet he only
[1:17:54] had one code and he wasn't going down
[1:17:56] there finding gold in the ground but yet
[1:17:58] Jesus found a coin when he needed it or
[1:18:01] told Peter where to find it but yet it
[1:18:03] wasn't something you just command but
[1:18:06] you do what God tells you to do
[1:18:08] he said now he said I do not believe
[1:18:10] there's anything that he's spoken all
[1:18:11] these years of my life I spoke to the
[1:18:13] people boy come to pass he said many
[1:18:16] people has come with dreams he's Let Me
[1:18:17] by his grace interpret for the people
[1:18:19] and he has come with dreams and with
[1:18:21] problems I was unable
[1:18:23] to interpret
[1:18:24] now think about this for a minute you
[1:18:26] think sometimes you have dreams that are
[1:18:27] strange
[1:18:28] or some dreams the prophet of God was
[1:18:30] unable to interpret
[1:18:33] I'm glad he was honest with us
[1:18:36] he said I was unable to interpret he
[1:18:38] said but I haven't tried to introduce to
[1:18:40] you people a gimmick that has all the
[1:18:42] answers I've tried to be honest and to
[1:18:45] tell you what was truth and I could only
[1:18:47] tell you if he told me and then as it
[1:18:49] come to me then I could tell you
[1:18:51] we got to be careful when we say thus
[1:18:53] saith the Lord we've got to be careful
[1:18:55] when we say the Lord told me a member of
[1:18:58] Pentecostal preacher Stan the pulpit and
[1:19:00] say I hear you Lord and you tell them
[1:19:01] take another offering
[1:19:03] it's always had to do with money
[1:19:06] therefore that when God speaks it needs
[1:19:09] to be something that's real
[1:19:12] people need to have confidence in US
[1:19:14] in our lives to be able to hear from us
[1:19:17] he said I haven't tried to introduce you
[1:19:20] to people at gimmick has all the answers
[1:19:21] I had to be honest and tell you the
[1:19:23] truth he said but I want to warn you he
[1:19:26] said in this day that we're living in
[1:19:27] there's many not saying anything against
[1:19:29] people when you see a person that's got
[1:19:31] the answer to everything that's contrary
[1:19:32] to the word
[1:19:34] he said Jesus said there was many
[1:19:35] leopards in the Days of Elijah but only
[1:19:37] one was healed in the many years the 80
[1:19:39] or more than Elijah lived one leper was
[1:19:41] healed many widows in the days of Elisha
[1:19:43] he was only sent to one
[1:19:45] we find out there's many things that God
[1:19:47] does he doesn't reveal to his servants
[1:19:49] and no servant is greater than his Lord
[1:19:52] he said and then God will not share his
[1:19:54] glory with nobody
[1:19:56] we need to stay humble don't we
[1:19:59] and we need to do that and he's talking
[1:20:01] about dreams he's talking about Visions
[1:20:02] but when we're spiritual we need to stay
[1:20:05] humble with that
[1:20:06] we need to stay humble with that I know
[1:20:08] that you do I'm not rebuking anybody
[1:20:10] tonight I I just want to warn Us in that
[1:20:12] way that we get we want the spirit of
[1:20:14] God to move
[1:20:16] huh we need to stay humble with that
[1:20:20] we need to make sure we recognize where
[1:20:21] we're at
[1:20:23] who we are we're Servants of God
[1:20:26] when a servant becomes a place he tries
[1:20:28] to take the place of God then God takes
[1:20:29] his life and moves him away somewhere or
[1:20:31] something he said we must remember that
[1:20:33] he said now on those visions and
[1:20:35] interpretations I cannot tell now listen
[1:20:37] I cannot tell the interpretation of a
[1:20:39] dream until I see exactly my vision what
[1:20:42] the dream was but some people always
[1:20:43] know the answer to your dream
[1:20:46] the prophet didn't
[1:20:50] right and and so the uh for me I can
[1:20:52] tell you what I think it means but if
[1:20:54] you come and ask me the interpretation
[1:20:55] of a dream I really can't tell you what
[1:20:57] it means unless I see it
[1:21:01] right and then I can tell you I don't
[1:21:02] have that gift at least I've never done
[1:21:04] that
[1:21:05] right so that's and maybe you can do
[1:21:08] that but I'd have to see it
[1:21:10] to know what it was because how could
[1:21:11] you know I knew the interpretation
[1:21:13] unless I had also could tell you what
[1:21:14] the dream was
[1:21:15] right that's what the Bible says he said
[1:21:18] now he said I see exactly my vision what
[1:21:21] the dream was many of you know you've
[1:21:22] told me your dream would not even tell
[1:21:23] at all when I saw the dream come back to
[1:21:25] me I turned around and told you there's
[1:21:26] much of it left out and then tell you
[1:21:29] what you left out of it you know that's
[1:21:30] right he said then the things that you
[1:21:32] didn't tell me like Nebuchadnezzar said
[1:21:34] how can how you if you can't tell me
[1:21:36] what I dreamed then how would I know you
[1:21:37] got the interpretation of it but he said
[1:21:39] but all these Impressions we mustn't
[1:21:42] take them and say thus saith the Lord we
[1:21:44] mustn't do that we must have a direct
[1:21:46] voice
[1:21:48] an answer from God before we can say
[1:21:50] it's God
[1:21:52] and he said not an impression not a
[1:21:55] sensation no matter how much it's
[1:21:57] pulsating
[1:21:58] right you feel that pressure to to speak
[1:22:02] but you better be careful before you say
[1:22:04] thus saith the Lord
[1:22:07] he said you might say I believe it could
[1:22:08] be this way but when you speak thus
[1:22:10] saith the Lord it's not you he said
[1:22:13] watch on the platform have you ever seen
[1:22:14] it fail thus saith the Lord is perfect
[1:22:18] never has failed and as long as it is
[1:22:21] thus saith the Lord
[1:22:23] it can't fail
[1:22:26] oh I love that now and I'm closing here
[1:22:29] but just hang with me now Joseph's dream
[1:22:32] you remember Joseph's dream Joseph
[1:22:34] Mary's fiancee
[1:22:36] his dream
[1:22:38] went that he had the angel come and
[1:22:40] spoke to him in a dream directly
[1:22:43] it wasn't in any kind of a uh it wasn't
[1:22:45] in any kind of a symbol like many times
[1:22:48] we see dreams and symbols but and and
[1:22:51] well I've had dreams I I had a dream
[1:22:53] before my dad passed away that he was
[1:22:55] passing away before we knew anything was
[1:22:56] wrong with him he's a 50 something year
[1:22:58] old man it shook me up so much I called
[1:23:00] my mother to see if there's anything
[1:23:01] wrong a few weeks later we found out he
[1:23:03] had cancer incurable cancer and uh but
[1:23:07] God does that but I I couldn't have even
[1:23:09] interpreted my own dream it just it's
[1:23:11] just what it was
[1:23:13] it is what it was and but
[1:23:16] but that's a secondary method
[1:23:19] of speaking you know brother Branham
[1:23:20] taught us that
[1:23:22] when Joseph saw that dream he said it's
[1:23:24] because there was no prophet
[1:23:27] so there was a secondary method by dream
[1:23:29] of speaking to him and that's why it was
[1:23:32] so clear he couldn't have been in the
[1:23:34] symbol because there was no Prophet to
[1:23:35] interpret it
[1:23:37] I saw a secondary method
[1:23:39] dreams is a secondary method
[1:23:41] gifts are a secondary method
[1:23:44] think about it God does it God does it
[1:23:47] but the primary way that God speaks
[1:23:51] is by the word
[1:23:54] the word is the urum and thumb
[1:23:57] or as the the old hillbilly said to use
[1:24:00] them and thumb them
[1:24:04] the use them and thumb them you'll get
[1:24:06] it after a while
[1:24:08] that's the word
[1:24:10] the urm and thumb of the lights the
[1:24:13] flash the lights and testimonies the
[1:24:16] human thumb that that that's what gifts
[1:24:19] are judged by we don't judge the word by
[1:24:22] the gift we got this as a gift by the
[1:24:24] word
[1:24:26] oh my I want you to watch something
[1:24:28] brother Branham said this will kind of
[1:24:30] wrap it all up for what we've what we've
[1:24:32] talked about
[1:24:33] First Corinthians 13 says this when that
[1:24:35] which is perfect has come
[1:24:37] that which is in part should be done
[1:24:39] away with he says to all these little
[1:24:41] things of jumping up and down like a kid
[1:24:42] and trying to talk in tongues and all
[1:24:44] these other things he said well that
[1:24:46] which is perfect and we do have today
[1:24:48] someone say today
[1:24:51] we do have today by God's help the
[1:24:54] perfect interpretation of the word with
[1:24:58] Divine vindication
[1:25:00] this is not a secondary source
[1:25:05] or a secondary method
[1:25:08] we sell the word way short and I want to
[1:25:11] say this as we close this on gifts that
[1:25:13] we we sell the word way too short this
[1:25:17] is not a secondary method this is God's
[1:25:20] primary method
[1:25:22] of speaking to his children we have
[1:25:25] today by God's help the perfect
[1:25:27] interpretation of the word with Divine
[1:25:31] Vindication then that which is in part
[1:25:33] is done away with when I was a child a
[1:25:35] Spike as a child I understood as a child
[1:25:37] but when I become a man I put away
[1:25:40] childish things
[1:25:41] you say why can't we have what the
[1:25:43] Pentecostals had let that age die
[1:25:47] let's be the bride
[1:25:49] we don't want what the Pentecostals had
[1:25:51] we want what true Pentecost had we want
[1:25:54] the reality of it we want all of it we
[1:25:57] want the gifts yes but we want the word
[1:25:59] we want the person of Jesus Christ right
[1:26:01] in our midst
[1:26:03] he's here that's what the revelation of
[1:26:05] the son of man was that's what it was so
[1:26:07] sister brother Andrew Glover over over
[1:26:09] the weekends we were supporting him in a
[1:26:11] meeting and he was preaching about the
[1:26:13] revealing of the son of man that's what
[1:26:15] it was brother Brandon's Ministry was to
[1:26:17] tell us he is here
[1:26:19] he is here when I become a man I put
[1:26:22] away childish things that he is here in
[1:26:24] the flesh
[1:26:26] amen
[1:26:27] we have thus saith the Lord
[1:26:30] how many know that the book came open
[1:26:33] what does that mean
[1:26:35] Psalms 103 3 he tells us who forgiveth
[1:26:38] all thine iniquities who healeth all thy
[1:26:40] diseases we have a message called
[1:26:41] perfect faith
[1:26:44] the perfect interpretation of the word
[1:26:46] thus saith the Lord
[1:26:49] I hope you hear me now a perfect Faith
[1:26:51] reveals the book is open on that
[1:26:54] scripture
[1:26:56] Isaiah 26 3 that will keep you in
[1:26:58] perfect peace do you need peace today do
[1:27:01] you need the the your mind to quieten
[1:27:03] down do you need some things to begin to
[1:27:05] come right for you he said that will
[1:27:06] keep him in perfect peace whose mind is
[1:27:09] stayed on me because he trusted in thee
[1:27:11] listen to me I'm telling you thus saith
[1:27:13] the Lord go listen to a sermon called
[1:27:15] letting off the pressure
[1:27:17] yeah
[1:27:19] the Divine interpretation of the word
[1:27:22] with Divine vindication
[1:27:26] Hallelujah Romans 8 28 are you having a
[1:27:30] problem with things not working out in
[1:27:31] your life
[1:27:34] think about it for a minute where this
[1:27:36] isn't a secondary source
[1:27:38] this is a reality when's the last time
[1:27:40] you went and took advantage of it
[1:27:44] it's the opening of the book
[1:27:47] right we know that all things work
[1:27:49] together for good to them to love God to
[1:27:52] them were the called according to his
[1:27:53] purpose you want to know what that means
[1:27:55] go to Invisible Union of the Bride
[1:27:58] where he said you never did it in the
[1:28:00] first place
[1:28:05] thus saith the Lord
[1:28:07] I could say that with confidence
[1:28:10] right
[1:28:11] Jeremiah musicians go ahead and come
[1:28:14] Jeremiah 29 11. we could go all through
[1:28:16] the scripture
[1:28:18] he said for I know the thoughts that I
[1:28:19] think towards you
[1:28:21] saith the Lord thoughts of peace and not
[1:28:23] of evil to give you an expected end how
[1:28:25] many believe that today go listen to
[1:28:27] Future home
[1:28:29] just saith the Lord
[1:28:32] amen
[1:28:33] oh Hallelujah
[1:28:36] First Corinthians 15 51 what did I say
[1:28:38] when he got done with the gifts he
[1:28:39] starts moving them towards the rapture
[1:28:42] he said behold I show you a mystery we
[1:28:44] shall not all sleep but we shall all be
[1:28:47] changed in a moment in the twinkling of
[1:28:49] an eye at the last Trump for the trumpet
[1:28:50] shall sound the dead shall be raised
[1:28:52] Incorruptible we shall be changed go
[1:28:54] listen to The Rapture thus saith the
[1:28:57] Lord he said the message was a shout
[1:29:02] we're already in the process of the
[1:29:04] rapture
[1:29:05] I was at brother Aaron McGarry he's
[1:29:07] preaching earlier in the year and the
[1:29:08] thought just come to me I said you know
[1:29:09] we're not we're not we're in the process
[1:29:12] of it I said it's like you're at a theme
[1:29:13] park you're on the roller coaster and
[1:29:15] it's already started
[1:29:17] you can't get off now
[1:29:19] I'm so glad of that those who are
[1:29:21] supposed to be on or on
[1:29:23] we're already on the ride we're not
[1:29:25] getting off it's already rolling the
[1:29:28] shout's already taking place that's
[1:29:30] saith the Lord
[1:29:32] or if we could have the gifts offering
[1:29:34] tonight and I'll bless my heart to have
[1:29:36] many gifts operating in the service but
[1:29:38] don't you realize here's something even
[1:29:40] beyond the gifts that we have that is
[1:29:42] clear that we can see thus saith the
[1:29:45] Lord is here
[1:29:50] book is open
[1:29:52] the promise has been manifested I'll
[1:29:54] tell you it's not believe it and live
[1:29:57] believe it and live
[1:29:59] oh but brother Ben you don't know what
[1:30:01] I'm struggling with believe it and live
[1:30:03] thus saith the Lord we have it for our
[1:30:05] age
[1:30:06] amen let's bow our heads together
[1:30:11] I'm looking forward to that change
[1:30:17] time's about up here on this Earth
[1:30:21] glad I have thus saith the Lord
[1:30:24] I'm so glad I'm not
[1:30:27] I'm not still wondering I remember what
[1:30:29] the Holiness Church was like that my dad
[1:30:31] come out of and I can remember them
[1:30:35] struggling with whether it would be
[1:30:36] pre-millennial or post-millennial or
[1:30:38] whether it would come on a white cloud
[1:30:40] or a white horse
[1:30:42] whatever that it was they were always
[1:30:44] wondering what age they were living in
[1:30:46] some thought they were able to see and
[1:30:48] some thought they weren't any ages at
[1:30:50] all
[1:30:51] they just wondered and they they guessed
[1:30:54] at it
[1:30:55] but we're not living in the age of
[1:30:57] guessing
[1:30:59] we're living in the age of Revelation
[1:31:03] an eagle come in our day and that was
[1:31:05] not a man that's see Christ coming down
[1:31:08] and speaking through a man
[1:31:11] we now have the the perfect Revelation
[1:31:14] you might struggle with that he said
[1:31:15] brother Ben how can you say that it's
[1:31:17] perfect I'm not telling you that the man
[1:31:19] was perfect
[1:31:21] but when Moses said
[1:31:24] when Moses told the people he said take
[1:31:27] the lamb strike the little of the
[1:31:29] doorpost that was thus saith the Lord
[1:31:32] and the message was perfect Moses wasn't
[1:31:34] but the message was
[1:31:36] that's the age that we live in today
[1:31:38] we've been told thus saith the Lord
[1:31:41] there was a human being that gave it but
[1:31:45] that just hides God hiding behind skin
[1:31:47] just like he's hiding behind your skin
[1:31:49] today the the message is thus said the
[1:31:51] Lord let's walk in it the Sith the Lord
[1:31:54] I'm gonna have my children are coming
[1:31:56] home thus saith the Lord
[1:31:58] thus saith the Lord I'm Healed thus
[1:32:01] saith the Lord I I've been forgiven thus
[1:32:03] saith the Lord I am at perfect peace
[1:32:06] today thus saith the Lord
[1:32:08] he's promised it to me I believe it amen
