us tonight and we thank you for the promise of your word that we're two or three are gathered together i will be in their midst i repeat that often lord but i really believe it tonight and i trust that you would be here to move me out of the way and speak through me lord father i just want to focus on a few things tonight but maybe you could even move me away from that to speak directly to something that's going on i know that you can do that maybe someone that's sitting here someone watching lord they would hear the word in a new way in a new light lord and i pray you granted tonight thank you for the message of the hour that illumines and shines light lord on the scriptures that we read and the things that we do we thank you for that thank you for the hour that we live in on all things that you do for us and give you the praise and the glory and the honor for it in jesus name amen amen god bless you turn with me if you would to revelation chapter 10 and verse 4. revelation 10 and 4. i want to deal with the breach again tonight and i just trust it'll be a blessing to you we're going to have a practice for the musicians sunday afternoon after lunch so some of us will be eating at the fellowship hall if anyone else wants to eat there that'd be you'd be welcome to join us i don't want to ever leave that out i know people sometimes want to bring their food and you'd be sure welcome to do that but then we're going to be practicing with the musicians and and singers here getting ready for the meetings coming up third about 30 days from now we'll be having meetings here at the church and so we want to prepare our hearts for that but not only that but every service every service is so important and thank god for the musicians that we have we've been blessed beyond our measure as far as a local church to have on the musicians we do but we want to do the best we can for the lord that's not all of our desire so we'll just kind of have a musician appreciation day next this sunday so and then um brother robert wilson had just got back from africa and messaged me today and the sides that you saw before service if you were here a few minutes early the sides on the back wall were from africa where he just got back from ghana and we helped support sponsor that trip him to be able to go and so i wanted to thank you for that and i was supposed to be on that trip but i felt led to stay here and and i believe it was the right thing to do but my heart is still with him i've only been to africa one time but it's such a part of my life and part of my heart you'd have to see it have to experience that to to know what i'm talking about but it's um i'm always burdened for those people and so it's good to see him be able to go there very few missionaries have been able to go overseas but just now if you're starting to get out so let's be praying for for that that god will be able to move and and many more souls will be won to the kingdom just one would be worth it we talked about sunday that when that last one comes in we get to go home that budget for mercy is is extended to that last one and we get to go home and then it's all over and i'm so grateful so grateful we get to be have a part in that whether it happens here over there or some other church it doesn't matter we're still a part of that being the bride at the end time we're we're the light of the hour god's shining through us and so we thank god for that and so thank you for your faithfulness and giving and praying for those things revelation chapter 10 and verse 4 and when the seven thunders had uttered their voices i was about to write and i heard a voice from heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered and write them not and the angel which i saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever and created heaven and the things that therein are and the earth and the things that there are and the sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer verse seven but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets i pray the lord would add his blessing to the word you may be seated we'll get right into it tonight and i want to kind of bear down on this a little bit as we're going through it because it's important and so you forgive me if i seem slow or repetitive but i believe it's very important and i know some of us many of us understand this but most of us probably don't understand it like we should and so we need to these are the things that have been given to us in this day this this isn't uh uh skim milk this is meat of the word and so i'm thankful we can eat the meat right amen amen so brother branham tells us he said there's seven seals on the book and these seven seals has the book sealed the book is absolutely sealed he said do you see it he said the book is absolutely a sealed book until the seven seals is broken he said it is sealed up with seven seals and now he makes his statement he said now that's a different from the seven thunders see this is seven seals on the book so how are the seven seals and the seven thunders different i told you i was going to kind of bear down on this because i think it's important that we understand it now there were seven thunders that were that were uttered in revelation 10 and he said that's different from the seven seals but we know that brother branham taught us and we went through it last wednesday night that the thunders were those truths revealed in the seals to put it just a little bit differently but that's that's what he was saying now and so we've got to look at that now a thunder in the bible is the voice of god and maybe this will help us understand a little bit better it's a voice of god when god speaks in the old testament and new testament it's a thunder a thunder it's it's as if in the old testament says if god is so great that he can't just speak and and people really understand or comprehend what he said it's a thunder all right it's it's so loud so big so wonderful that it's hard for us to comprehend what it is until it's revealed right so a thunder is an unrevealed truth or we can say it this way an unrevealed voice of god a voice of god existing in its unrevealed form it's a thunder it's noise we could say or it's a mystery right it's a mystery and so job 40 and 9 uh it's this is actually god speaking to job he says has sound arm like god can style thunder with a voice like him no one can it's god's voice a thunder and if you go to psalms 29 and maybe sometime you can read it um and i won't read the whole psalm tonight just one verse but you'll find that the voice of the lord is spoken seven times in psalms 29 it says over and over again the voice of the lord the voice of the lord the voice of the lord and it tells us the results of the voice of the lord speaking what it does and i'll say this when the voice of the lord that thunder speaks it means something it's not just a head knowledge somewhere but it's something that will affect the earth it'll affect the bride it'll affect the people and so brother branham even said that it'll be those divinely revealed mystery truths that will literally turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers see what god says means something and so these mysteries are not it's not as if we have a plan of salvation that is separate from the mysteries it is the book of redemption the mystery is not a mystery of another book it's a mystery of this book right it's mysteries hidden in this book and so god spoke but people didn't understand what he said right so god had to sit in a prophet amen but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel you have to forgive me tonight i don't have any notes what you see is what i'm seeing up here but it's but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel and when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished and that's the age we live in and it's important for us not to just know these things but to recognize that it happened that the book came open because then we know we have access to every part of the book right that thunder that's been revealed that's something that's known and when it's known it's something that can take effect in our lives it means something the god of glory said the voice of the lord is upon the waters the god of glory thundereth the lord is upon many waters so a thunder is the voice of god in in john 12 28 and brother branham deals with this in the first seal but in john 12 28 jesus said father glorify thy name he said then there came then came there a voice from heaven saying i have both glorified it and we'll glorify it again now jesus knew what he was saying right but then the next verse speaks of how the people therefore that stood by and heard it said that it thundered it thundered brother brown said they didn't understand it but he knew what it said right and so and others said an angel spoke to him so this was a thunder in revelation 6 and 1 when the seals began to come open he said i saw when the lamb opened one of the seals i heard it as it were the noise of thunder god said something amen god said something and one of the four be saying come and see and brother branham says then he said when the lamb took the book and broke that first seal he said god spoke from his eternal throne listen god spoke to say what that seal was to be revealed amen that was the thunder what the seal was does that make sense now and i don't want to put too much of my own interpretation here i want to stay right with what a prophet said but i think it ought to be plain to us and i try to be very careful it's one of the reasons i'm not using my own notes here because i'm trying to be very careful in saying what the prophet said but it's got to be a revelation to us is that right he said he said god spoke from his eternal throne to say what the seal was to be revealed but when it was placed before john it was in a symbol he said when the thunder remember a loud clapping noise of a thunder is the voice of god he said that's what the bible says a clap of thunder they thought it was a thunder but it was god he understood it for it was revealed to him amen amen you realize what age we live in we understand what god said people knew god said it they said an angel spoke to him a thunder but jesus understood what he said and we're living in a time when we understand that what these mysteries that have been hidden and down to the ages we understand what god said amen amen you realize that the importance of this message without this message you don't have that right without this message we are still in a denominational age and even if we acknowledge that the messenger came but we don't believe that he did his job and open the seals and as the book is open then we still are in a denominational age we have to be because that's what ends the denominational age amen y'all forgive me i'm running this myself today we're going to go back and start singing again so there has to be a voice from heaven that we can understand aren't you glad we can understand it today aren't you glad you can know it so we find that he says when he he under he understood it let me see if back in the right place they thought it was a thunder but it was god he understood it was revealed to him see he said it was a thunder he said and now now watch what he says in revelation 10 4 he said when the seven thunders had uttered their voices notice their voices they said something god said something but it wasn't understood john understood it because he was going to write it but what did what did he tell him he said i heard a voice from heaven saying unto me seal up those things seal them up seal up the thunder so the seal is the mystery of it it's the mystery the thunder is what god said right and so when the seal is broke you understand what god says amen that ought to be just where we can grab ahold of it tonight seal up those things write them not now brother branham in the unveiling of god and we read the more of this quote last wednesday night but he said it's all revealed in there you'll find out what he was talking about in there but stewart what's the bible it's all revealed in there and the seven seals opened up the revelation of what that was so the seven seals open up the revelation of the scriptures it has to come from the scripture because this is the book of redemption right this is the book of redemption and brother baptism said it was the revelation of that new testament book of redemption there's some things that we don't know there's some things we haven't because it pertains maybe to israel or to some other time but for us we know he calls it the book of the revelation of the new testament right and so but that what was given to us for this gentile age we know it now and it's more than just a theory and we don't have to preach it as a theory but we know god heals the sick right we know that he raises the debt we know that it didn't gifts didn't cease right because of what a prophet said you see the danger in getting away from that when people begin to get away from that and they say this cease over here and this stopped over here but god never said that you see a prophet come to open up the book so he says it's all revealed in there and the seven stills opened up the revelation of what that was again he said the mysteries and souls that are in prison now the mysteries was in the seven seals when these seven seals was opened that opened up the entire bible amen so it didn't just open up because yes the thunders is a revelation behind each of the seals what god said the reality of it not in reality form is what brother adam calls it not just the mystery form but it's not just that it was the whole bible this field was on the whole book right so it's not just that the white horse writer was the antichrist you understand but it's all the mysteries of the book right and so it opened up the entire bible and brother branham talks about how it was unfolding and you not only understand the mind of god or how that happens but you look at how it unfolded in brother branham's ministry there would come a time when marriage and divorce needed to be understood there come a time when christ is the mystery of god revealed all these things were understood as it unfolded all through his ministry and so it began even before the seals things began to open up and brother branham talks about that how it he said it's been opening up little by little and finally it was open and and god was done with it now he said the seven seals it was still with seven mysteries it was sealed with seven mysteries the seals were the mess with the mysteries once the steel is broke then you know what god said you know the reality of it and these seven seals held the entire mystery of it the entire mystery of the bible so you couldn't understand any of the bible i hope you're with me and you say well what about the part well they got some things right many things and brother madam addresses that many things they got right in fact the seventh angel didn't even have a certain mystery but he was going to tell us what was right and what was wrong but without that ministry we can't tell what's right and what's wrong and that's why you get people too far off of the message and pretty soon they got a cow eating grass on top of a tree somewhere you've got to stay with what a prophet said right and so these seven miss seals held the entire mystery of it now again and i said i was going to cow down on this a little bit to use one of brother branham's phrases i'm not really sure what cow down means but maybe some of you elderly folks could interpret that to me i've never really looked that up i don't know what cow down means but i think it means to to focus on one thing but since the opening of those seven seals he said of those angels just behind the mountain yonder this has become a new book it's the things that's been hit and now we can see it all through the book i mean you can go find the seals in uh in gideon's story of gideon you can go find about the six eight and the seventh uh the one that come the prophet that come and all those things you can find that in there you can find it in the psalms you can find it all through the bible you know when when a when a an opening or something is revealed to the people that's that's what they see when the holiness movement come on i've been reading about the history of the holiness movement before the pentecostal movement when the holiness those old itinerant holiness preachers that didn't have any education they would go out and preach holiness and they saw holiness in every scripture in the bible they preached sanctification from the story of the man that that got his eyes healed by jesus spit on in the clay and and put it on his eyes and told him to go wash and they said well that was the second blessing sanctification they saw it everywhere holiness was everywhere why because that was their anointing that's what they had revealed to them amen so we can take any scripture of the bible and show and show you and point it all points back to what the opening of the word and the whole book is open to us now so we can preach on any of it it's wonderful it doesn't just bind us to one thing say well we've got to say this just this way but it's the whole book that's been opened this has become a new book he said it's the things that's been hid it's being revealed as god promised in revelation 10 he would do it are you glad god keeps his promises amen he said in the book will not the seals will not be released until the message of the seventh angel he said and now we're back in the breach again so he's just talked about how that the angel or the seal and the thunder's two different things it's not the same thing because the seal is the mystery the thunder is the voice of god that spoke he said but the book will not the seals will not be released until the message of the seventh angel he said so we are presuming we the whole world was presuming but the genuine revelation of god will be made perfect and but alan what's interesting he didn't leave it up to be me to make it perfect right where will it be made perfect not with the ministry he didn't leave it up to the ministry to make it perfect but in in that sounding what's sounding the sounding of the seventh angel's message you don't leave it up to us to perfect the message are you with me now and we don't have to finish it up and perfect it no we're living it amen we become that's our our goal that's what we have to do is become the word now so he said so we are presuming but the genuine revelation of god will be made perfect in that sounding vindicated truth you may not understand it i may not understand all of it but i'll say this it's perfect you say well i know things brother brandon said sure he did sure he did he was human he was a man that's not what was perfect but during that sounding amen the revelation from god would be perfect remember i read you the other night the angel was never wrong amen never wrong hallelujah now he said that's exactly what the word says the mystery should be finished at that time he said this seven seal book remember it was closed here in the fifth chapter and read the tenth chapter it's opened so something had to happen he said he said now we're going to see what the book says about to become open he said it is not made known until the lamb takes the book and breaks the seals and opens the book he says see the lamb has got to take the book this had to take place in our generation he said it's it he said now remember no man in heaven no man in earth no man pope bishop cardinal state presbyter whoever he is can break them seals or reveal the book but the lamb so again that trick question i told you who opened the seals a lot of us just we'd say well brother branham did no he didn't the lamb opened the seals and the seals were broke and then he gave it to the prophet and we'll get to that in the breach how that he he said because it has to be revealed to the prophet surely the lord god will do nothing amen except he reveals it to his servants the prophets so it had to come to him but it was the lamb that opened the seals and then hands it to the prophet he said now he said whoever he is can break them seals i've done that again but and so we see the lamb is the one who does it the lamb he said and we have probed excuse me we have probed and presumed and stumbled and wondered and they said and that's the reason we're all in such a confusion i i may excuse me i may preach sunday about i i've got it on my heart if the lord lets me i'm going to preach a sermon title are we there yet you've heard that from your kids right and we wonder sometimes we probed and presumed and stumbled and wandered and that's the reason we're all in such confusion we don't have to do that anymore and there's no reason to make a mystery out of out of a revelation right cover it back up there's no reason to do that we're there we made it he said but that's the reason we're all in such a confusion he says but with the divine promise that this book of redemption will be perfectly opened by by who by the lamb how would it be opened it would be perfectly opened perfectly open i'm so glad god doesn't do anything halfway aren't you excuse me it'll be perfectly open by the lamb my vanity's getting me in trouble i'm just going to take this jacket off you forgive me now he said and the seals rove will be loosed by the lamb in the last days where when would it be loosed in the last days in which we're living now that's when it'll be done now we believe we've seen that now he said and it's not made known until the lamb takes the book and breaks the seals because remember the book was being holded he says in the hands of him that sat upon the throne the book was held by the original owner remember we preached about that what that means is it's redeemable amen it's redeemable but a redeemer still had to come you were redeemable but a redeemer had to come had to step out the lamb had to take the book sometime it had to happen and i'll say this it can't just exist in theory none of the truths of this message can just exist in theory if it's just in theory then it has no effect on our lives if just christ died for you in theory it just has no effect on you you know it happened but that doesn't make you a christian knowing it happened doesn't make you a christian but it's it's a revelation to you personally that it happened for you and you've taken advantage of that you've been washed in that blood and because you've been washed in that blood you're a part of the opening of the word you're a part of all these things that's taken place not something that happens abstractly or in another time or another place but it's something you experience yourself hey man you're a book that's been opened and next time the lord willing that we speak on this i'll get to brother brown talks about how that the seal of the holy ghost seals you to your destination it's a seal and one day it'll be broke huh and when it's broken find out what was in there amen that it wasn't just been through it that everybody thought well maybe he won't make it maybe he maybe he's not maybe they've done too many bad things but the seal was there and when the seal is broken it shows what was there who you really were so you're a shield book amen amen no one can break that seal but the lamb hallelujah thank you lord the lamb was the book was being held in the hands of him that set up on the throne i promised myself i was gonna go slow tonight so but i don't really have that much tonight so we'll move on in another service but look he said the lamb comes to him that sits upon the throne and takes the book out of his right hand he said takes the book oh that's deep he said we'll try to solve it out if we can by the help of the holy spirit now we're depending on him and we're depending on him to hear it aren't we and we will see later it is at the end time when time has run out now he says he goes on he says no denominations has a right for interpretation of the book no man has a right to interpret it it is the lamb who interprets it if we were just relying on brother branham's knowledge to interpret the book we'd be in trouble because no man has a right to interpret it lamb who interprets it i love this though he said the lamb interprets it and the lamb is the one who speaks it i said that's not skim milk now again brother brandon's voice was not the voice of god his literal voice you understand that we know that god spoke through that man and it wasn't brother branham who who spoke it was the lamb amen so we can have confidence in it church though the the man may be fallible but the lamb spoke it hallelujah amen and so you'll never convince me that well you say well this is wrong and this is wrong this is wrong but the lamb spoke it the lamb spoke it it's got to be right my understanding of it may not be right but it's it's got to be right there's got to be a truth there that can be understood so the lamb is the one who speaks it and the lamb makes the word to be known by vindicating and bringing the word to life you can know something but the lamb is the one who makes it live in your life the lamb does that the lamb opens the book the lamb reveals what's on the inside he's the one who opens the seals now he said exactly notice and it's not revealed until he said this book is not revealed i love this until the church ages and denominational ages has run out why do we keep trying to recreate denominations denominational ages are over denominational agents has run out god don't work in that system anymore as i said there may be good people out there but god don't work in that system anymore that system has rejected god it's been indicted it's just like that jewish system had had been indicted and and the veil was rent to show there was no blood there and the mercy seat had moved to christ on the cross so in this day the denominational age has run out there's no more mercy there where's the mercy at the mercy is in the one amen the lamb who's in his bride amen i said that that's deep and maybe hard to understand but you are god's mercy budget for the age that we live in the book isn't revealed until church ages and denominational ages has run out and there is time no more see it's only revealed after church ages and denominational ages has run out he repeated himself he said that's the reason the thing is in such a scruple tonight he said see they pick up a little doctrine and they run off here to one side and say this is it now people still do that in the message but it'll never be blessed by god there was a time when luther picked up the little dog the doctrine of justification and run to one side with it and this is it and it was it that's where god was moving god don't do that today why the whole books open and so when we run to one side and we can do that individually i'm not just preaching to me or other preachers or to someone out here in another church but to us each one of us individually we tend to take a little doctrine and make that most important in our lives that's the most important thing and the truth is we can't run off here to one side we've got to stay in a balance because if we pick up a little doctrine and run off to one side of one or to the other god won't bless that he said another one picks up another doctor runs off this side and said this is it and see we have to stay in the middle of the road and the middle of the road is not the middle between truth and error the middle of the road is the middle of truth right because you can become extreme in truth if you don't stay in the middle of the road but the truth you never want to go into error on either side why there's no reason to ever go in the ditch but you stay in the middle of truth and brother brandon said you won't get run over because it's a one-way street and so he said that's that's how they build the denomination each one builds the denomination under it because you gotta have some support for his doctrine can't you just see that so clear he picks up a little doctrine he runs off and builds a denomination a support system under his doctrine right and so he builds a group of people who will agree with him a bunch of preachers that can get along with him and they all fellowship together we shouldn't be doing that as message believers huh well we all agree with one another we become a an echo chamber and a yes man see we we that's not what we need we need somebody to tell us the truth brother branham got in trouble because all the preachers around him were telling him yes go for it brother branham you can do it brother branham go read the vision that he had he was trying to explain those first poll in that second poll and they said you can do it brother branham brother brown said that's why the third poll would be a complete secret it wouldn't be they wouldn't be able to do it to get to it he said because the devil would drive the wheels off of his car if it wasn't something that was a secret and so and so many people missed it because of that but it was made known to us i'm so glad for that but now each one builds a denomination under their doctrine and he said we got hundreds of denominations they built a support system and and they delineate by their teaching who's in and who's out and you say well you know this one one way is to say well we're all the same and another way is to say that i'm not the only one but then you could say because we're not all the same we know that's a lie but then you say well i'm not only the only one but if you get to preaching that everybody else is false then you are the only one right by default and the truth is if all this message produced was one church somewhere where the only person that ever could understand brother branham's message is standing in the pulpit we got a problem we got a problem that's not what the message produced see there's bride in a lot of different churches probably not everybody in every church maybe not many in every church two or three here two or three there but i want to be that one don't you i want to be the bride from this church but the church don't go in the rapture and each one builds a denomination under it until we got hundreds of denominations but still and all of it to see the confusion that people are wondering what is truth he said if that isn't just the condition today but then he promises that when that time has finished out there will be the sounding of the seventh angel's voice amen and then the book will be revealed at that time he said now don't say nobody then people ain't saved back there you know brother branham was less judgmental towards denominational people than we are towards message people it's true brother would always say it was the system all right he said but the mysteries that they couldn't understand oh my look what now see they couldn't understand how that god could be three and yet one how many understands that tonight even the children can understand that my my daughters even understood what it meant to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ but that was it was one of those mysteries one of those things god said that people didn't understand and so they all almost all got it wrong how that the scripture can say baptize in the name of the father son and holy and turn around and say baptized in the name of jesus oh so many things how can eve eat an apple and cause the wreckage of the whole world you see what that was eve what the bible just says that they partook of the fruit all right it doesn't tell us what happened how do we know what happened the seals have been revealed right that's that's the difference in it the seal is the mystery the revelation is the opening of the mystery amen and he said see how can these things be but those mysteries are promised to be revealed in the end time say why would god do that god did it on purpose and we could get into that because of election and jesus said he said thank you father that you've hid these revealed it to babes he told him he said blessed are your eyes because you can see amen in revelation i said he that hath the ear let him hear what the spirit says to the churches and in daniel he says that the wise would understand amen but he said seal up these things until the time of the end what what is it these mysteries are promised to be revealed when in the end time the time that we live in he said it's little loose ends little loose ends now hang on because i'm almost i'm closing in just a moment so you just hang with me these great warriors has come on the scene irenaeus martin polycarp the different ones luther wesley but the branham called them great warriors great warriors how they have come and just lived long enough to kind of bring a light and shine it but they left many things in darkness many things in darkness let me tell you church we have nothing to be ashamed of in the message of the hour you understand things that other people have been probing and looking at for years and i've read you some of what the old commentaries have said and how they said there must come someone who god would use to reveal that at the end time there must be somebody they understood that and now today people don't even care but all through the ages they understood these warriors of the faith but they didn't live long enough to see it but what was it each one come and as they go went through their life they brought just a little light and shone it but they left many things in darkness but you and i live in a time of complete light if you want to walk in it amen you only have to be as dark as you want to be are you whipping out many people in the lutheran age in the western age wish they could understand wish they could see but like jesus told the disciples that many people many prophets good men wanted to see what you see but now you only have to be in as much darkness as you will yourself to be in you can walk in light we can know how to have our homes right we can know how to have the right kind of services we can know how to have the holy ghost moving in our lives we can know how to be right with god we can know all the things all the mysteries of god have been revealed and all those things that have been revealed have fed into what we are today and what we believe and what we become as the bride and so we walk in light when we want to be in light if we walk in the light as he is in the light amen that's where we have to that's our challenge today stay in line with the word walk in the light but they left many things in darkness that's not where we live along came the pentecostal age like the lutheran age and they run out on limbs but still all right don't say they wasn't right they were he said they were but there is loose ends left that can't be explained what we say last wednesday night the loose sins was those those lines on the ship that had to be secured so the boat could sail amen there's loose ends left that can't be explained he said why the seals hasn't been broke to thoroughly reveal what these things are so the loose ends are tied up now no more loose ends for me to go find no more loose ends for you to go find all i got to find how they were tied up hey ben amen they're there so i can enjoy it i don't have to build it i don't have to put it together i can enjoy it are you with me now but so many times we're still trying to build it we're trying to justify we don't have to justify the message brother branham god identify that god vindicated that we don't have to justify a prophet let's just move on into what the prophet had to say he had a message and the message wasn't just something a prophet wanted to say it wasn't just something a man wanted to say but the message come from god it would be the revealing of those seven thunders which was the entire mystery of what god said that couldn't be understood down through the church ages but can be understood understood today aren't you glad for the hour that you live in you don't live in darkness anymore you live in light amen and how does that come down to our lives you don't live in darkness anymore you don't have to live in darkness in your homes you don't have to live in darkness in the church we have light we have light in our age even listen you say well brother brown didn't say anything about this there are certain things there was no internet back then but we have light amen so that as we come across a situation amen we know that our god's going to be able to say that giant we know that there'll be there's something in that word that will influence our thinking listen if you stay in the word there's something in there that will influence your thinking about things that didn't even exist in 1960s huh think about it they didn't have pornography they didn't have all these things but it's the word that's been revealed that influences how we handle these things amen amen why because the light come on we can see what's in the house we can go as brother brown talks about going into the arcade and he's not talking about a room full of games but he's talking about a place with goods like a walmart we can go into the walmart and look up on the shelf and find everything we want everything we ever desired is at the walmart that's the age we live in god just brought us the scriptures down and put all the promises at reach where we could reach them amen amen i got to stop he said but then in the last stage all those mysteries are to be solved and handed out amen sold and handed out who were they handed out to hallelujah they were solved and handed out first they were handed to the prophet and then it was handed to the bride amen what happened to the book that the here come the mighty angel and he gave john the book he said eat it up amen the mysteries are to be solved and handed out and the seals are to be opened by the lamb and revealed to the church and then time is no more no more denominational age no more delay no more weight any person that tells you we're waiting on anything is in error you know that's right the only thing waiting on is us to come to it and that last one to come in it's waiting on the human side not on his side amen these things have been solved and handed out and time is no more no more wondering no more probing no more making a little denomination going out here somewhere and separating ourselves from all the other believers god didn't call us to do that god didn't make me the pastor of this message i've been called the pastor here and if i don't do a good the right kind of job for here god will take me out of the way because he loves you but he called me the pastor here he made me a light to an age but i'm so glad we had one but i'm a light to my world you're a light to your world and whoever god gives you whoever god would let you be an influence on you just have to live that word in front of that person and let that book be opened in your life let that seal begin to come out of your life this is what a christian is amen he said how wonderful he said then this book the book then is a book of redemption amen he said and we'll bring in later musicians go ahead and come we'll bring in later how the 144 000 is brought in and so forth he said all right that's jew and even in brother branham's time you'll find where brother branham is and you can you can take that off now you'll find where brother branham is responding to people said we need a prophet we need a prophet to come brother brown is responding to that and said he already come you'll find out what you've been hollering for has already happened he said but they missed the awakening of the bride he said in what they're looking for is to the jews but we know where we're at we don't have to be shaken we don't have to be moved we can move amen by the holy spirit amen do you believe that tonight amen you say well brother ben that wasn't that wasn't very good i beg to differ there's enough word in there to change your life not because i said it but a prophet come and told us these things and the lamb broke the seals amen and he's still hoping he's still working in your life to break the seal on your life to manifest out of you the works of a christian to make it real the thunders had to become more than just a thunder had to be a reality and the word had to become a reality in every one of our lives let's power heads together thank you for your patience tonight i trust the lord will continue to lead us if we do continue and i believe we will on this at some point i trust the lord will continue to bless us brother allen supposed to be speaking next wednesday night lord willing so we'll get to hear him again do you love the lord amen maybe there's something you'd just like to talk to god about tonight let's just take a moment to do that lord jesus we love you and we thank you for all that you've done the things you've said oh god i want to manifest that word in my life i don't want it to be just a theory lord even every time i study these things you just open things up even while i'm standing here in the pulpit with no notes just quotes and scriptures and i'm looking at these things and as they're coming up i it just strikes my heart even though i've looked at it for days over and over and over and listened to it but yet it just strikes my heart in a different way because you're the only one who can open the book to our lives we thank you for that tonight bring revelation where it's needed lord bring a reality of your word to our lives [Music] lord if there's something we've come short and i pray you'd forgive us lord we we want to be accurate representations of your word in this world that we live in we don't want to be just like everybody else the whole world is reading about that holiness movement they even acknowledge that it's dead they don't understand why it died don't understand that they they got they made a denomination and didn't continue on with the word oh god may we never do that maybe you just keep unfolding yourself we know you'll be doing that down to the ages may you continue to do that in our lives i pray you would unfold sweetness lord not arrogance lord as we learn these things sometimes we become we get to thinking about what we know but lord it's not what we know it's who we know the message was all done and all the thunders and all the things were revealed the seals were open it just displayed you in a real way when it was opened in a prophet's life he'd become more humble and more sincere oh god may it be that way in every one of our lives and we become more humble more sincere more loving to one another may we never try to build a denomination on a doctrine lord may we just follow the word you know we're going home lord and we're it's almost here are we there yet i believe we're close i pray you grant it now we thank you for your word thank you for all that you've done for us thank you for your blessings that we have in this church may we
