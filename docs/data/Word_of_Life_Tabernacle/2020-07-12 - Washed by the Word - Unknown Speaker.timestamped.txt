[40:09] brother jt and sister cleat is back

[40:14] didn't think it'd be possible for you to

[40:16] out driving coming on a wednesday night
[40:18] didn't seem possible did it
[40:20] but you're here and sometimes all it

[40:39] and if you need something i i know that
[40:41] he's here to
[40:43] to give it to you tonight ephesians
[40:44] chapter 5 and verse 25
[40:46] husbands love your wives even as christ
[40:49] also loved the church and gave himself
[40:53] for it that he might sanctify and
[40:56] cleanse it with the washing of water
[40:59] by the word that he might present it to
[41:02] himself
[41:03] a glorious church not having spot or
[41:07] wrinkle or any such
[41:08] thing but that it should be holy
[41:12] and without blemish i pray the lord
[41:15] would add his blessing to the word you
[41:17] may be seated this evening
[41:23] there are a few things that feel as good
[41:26] as being clean
[41:29] and cleanliness cleanliness is more
[41:32] than a good feeling it's necessary
[41:36] that's kind of a recent discovery in
[41:38] history
[41:40] for years people didn't understand why
[41:43] you needed to be clean and you'd think
[41:45] that would be something that we would
[41:47] we would just get as human beings but
[41:50] i read a story a while back and i think
[41:54] i've used it before but it struck me
[41:56] today
[41:58] in 1818 there was a man by the name of
[42:01] ignaz
[42:02] simel vice he was a doctor and he was
[42:05] born into a world of dying women
[42:09] the finest hospitals in the land at that
[42:11] time
[42:12] lost one out of six mothers you think
[42:15] about that
[42:16] one out of six was the mortality rate
[42:20] for
[42:20] dying in childbirth
[42:23] one out of six mothers a doctor's daily
[42:26] routine
[42:28] usually began in the dissecting room
[42:31] where he performed autopsies that's how
[42:34] he started his day
[42:36] and from there he made his way to the
[42:37] hospital to examine expectant mothers
[42:39] without ever
[42:40] pausing to wash his hands
[42:45] i just didn't know and after a while dr
[42:49] dr simon vice began to see a correlation
[42:52] between the two
[42:53] i've been touching these dead bodies and
[42:56] performing autopsies and then i go
[42:58] and and he noticed that the midwives had
[43:00] a much better success rate
[43:02] than the doctors did and so he began to
[43:06] keep
[43:06] track of it and after a while he
[43:08] realized
[43:09] he didn't know why but he realized if he
[43:11] washed his hands
[43:14] that the mothers would live
[43:17] that seems like such a simple thing but
[43:20] if he just washed his hands they would
[43:22] live
[43:24] if he could just do that and so he
[43:26] washed with a chlorine solution and
[43:29] after 11 years of delivering babies he
[43:31] lost only
[43:32] 184 mothers out of 8 000 and some babies
[43:36] about 1 in 50. he spent most
[43:40] of the rest of his life lecturing and
[43:41] debating with his colleagues
[43:44] and he argued that this is a direct
[43:47] cause
[43:48] and that's the cause of the fever that
[43:50] they would get
[43:51] was he said i've shown how it can be
[43:53] prevented
[43:55] i've proved what i've said and he's
[43:57] speaking to the other doctors he said
[43:59] but while we talk
[44:00] gentlemen women are dying he says i'm
[44:03] not asking anything world shaking
[44:05] i'm asking you to wash
[44:10] wash your hands he says it this way for
[44:13] god's sake wash your hands
[44:18] no one believed him doctors and midwives
[44:22] have been delivering babies for
[44:24] thousands of years without washing and
[44:27] so
[44:27] they weren't going to listen to a little
[44:29] hungarian man
[44:30] and he wasn't going to change them now
[44:33] it actually drove him
[44:34] insane at the age of 47
[44:38] some of ice died insane his wash basins
[44:41] discarded his colleagues laughing in his
[44:43] face
[44:44] the death rattle of a thousand women
[44:46] ringing in his ears
[44:50] see if they would just wash they could
[44:52] have saved them
[44:56] and the truth is that if we don't wash
[44:58] in the water of the word
[45:00] we may not die but others will
[45:04] if we don't handle the word with clean
[45:07] hands
[45:08] death comes so if you
[45:11] as we want to talk tonight about being
[45:13] washed by the word
[45:15] the first reason that we must be washed
[45:17] by the word is to prevent
[45:20] death
[45:23] and i read further in the life of dr
[45:26] simovision there was a man a friend of
[45:29] his a doctor who realized that he was
[45:32] right
[45:34] and he was felt so guilty over
[45:38] having went all through his career not
[45:40] washing his hands
[45:42] and even his own niece had died because
[45:45] he didn't
[45:46] wash his hands he realized he was right
[45:48] and he killed himself
[45:50] because he couldn't handle the the pain
[45:53] and
[45:53] of knowing that he he was the one who
[45:56] did it and all it would
[45:57] it would have taken was to be washed and
[46:00] be clean
[46:02] and he could have saved their lives
[46:05] pilate felt like that one time and he
[46:08] knew he was responsible for the death of
[46:10] an innocent man
[46:12] he knew he was going to be responsible
[46:14] so he had water brought
[46:16] he got in the water and he began to wash
[46:18] his hands he says i'm not responsible
[46:21] but he couldn't wash off the the stench
[46:24] and the guilt
[46:27] of having the blood of jesus on his
[46:30] hands
[46:31] he couldn't wash the guilt from his life
[46:34] brother branham put it this way in a
[46:36] sermon called what shall i do with jesus
[46:38] called christ he said
[46:40] like pilate stood with the same thing he
[46:42] said give me some water
[46:43] i'll wash it off my hands to prove when
[46:45] he returned back he still had to pass
[46:47] the judgment
[46:48] it didn't excuse him he tried to say
[46:50] well if i can't get him off
[46:52] my hands i'll put him on caesar's hands
[46:55] and it backfired right back to him
[46:58] it does to you too as an individual
[47:01] what are you going to do not what mother
[47:04] did what papa did what the pastor does
[47:07] what brother branham does it's on your
[47:09] hands
[47:13] he said what are you going to do about
[47:15] it with this jesus called christ
[47:17] because you've got blood on your hands
[47:20] and it's the blood of god
[47:22] he said now what are you going to do he
[47:24] said be guilty of the crucifixion
[47:27] you can crucify him accept your creed or
[47:29] whatever you want to
[47:30] say well well i'll just pass on off i
[47:33] won't have nothing to do with none of
[47:34] this church stuff
[47:36] you can't do that he's on your hands
[47:40] that's right he said he'll you say i'll
[47:42] just forget the whole thing
[47:45] you can't do it it's still in your hands
[47:48] well i'll just say my pastor taught me
[47:49] this it backfires right back to you
[47:56] if there was no blind sheep there would
[47:58] be no
[47:59] blind leading the blind it works both
[48:02] ways
[48:04] nobody to give credibility to the blind
[48:06] leaders
[48:07] if the sheep wouldn't blindly follow
[48:11] he said you can either receive him or
[48:12] reject him just either way you want to
[48:15] do it
[48:16] it backfires right back to you you see
[48:19] to be washed
[48:20] in the water of the word brother jt is
[48:21] to be freed from the guilt
[48:23] of the blood of christ
[48:28] i needed to be freed from the guilt of
[48:30] the blood of christ
[48:33] and to refuse to be washed just to
[48:34] crucify him
[48:36] afresh that's why if you know better and
[48:40] you know what
[48:41] it's the right thing to do and you go
[48:43] away anyway if you come right up to the
[48:45] borderline
[48:46] you walk the other direction you refuse
[48:48] to be washed
[48:50] by the water of the word of this hour
[48:52] you walk away from him the bible says
[48:54] you crucify him afresh
[48:57] put him to an open shame now
[49:01] in the old testament there were waters
[49:02] of separation
[49:04] in numbers chapter 19 and verse 9 it
[49:07] says that a man that is clean shall
[49:09] gather up the ashes of the heifer that's
[49:10] the red heifer and i
[49:12] encourage you to go read that chapter if
[49:13] you get a chance
[49:15] when we're out of the service he said
[49:17] lay them
[49:18] up without the camp in a clean place and
[49:21] it shall be kept for the congregation of
[49:23] the children of israel
[49:25] for water of separation it is a
[49:28] purification for sin
[49:32] now brother branham in a thinking man's
[49:35] filter goes into a pretty detailed
[49:36] explanation of this and i want to kind
[49:38] of take you through this and
[49:40] excuse me for reading but i believe it's
[49:42] important
[49:44] he said notice in exodus 19 he said i
[49:46] want you to read it when you go home and
[49:47] you have more time he said notice
[49:49] when israel had committed sin first they
[49:51] took a red heifer
[49:52] which had never had a yoke on her neck
[49:54] that means she was never yoked up with
[49:55] anything
[49:56] she had to be red the color red as an
[49:58] atonement color
[49:59] he said you know science knows that if
[50:01] you take red and look through red to red
[50:03] it's white look through red it red it's
[50:05] white
[50:05] he looks through the red blood of the
[50:07] lord jesus red sins will become as white
[50:09] as snow red through red he said and the
[50:12] heifer was killed in the evening time of
[50:14] the whole congregation of israel
[50:16] and there was put seven stripes of her
[50:18] blood upon the door
[50:19] where the whole congregation had to
[50:21] enter a type of the seven church ages by
[50:24] the blood
[50:25] and her body was taken and burned it was
[50:27] burnt with the hoof with the skin with
[50:28] the intestines with the dung
[50:30] everything was burnt together and it had
[50:32] to be picked up by a clean man that's
[50:34] the ashes of it
[50:36] it had to be picked up by a clean man it
[50:38] had to be put in a clean place
[50:40] outside the congregation he said
[50:42] therefore if israel could only see the
[50:44] type
[50:45] this word of god must not be handled by
[50:47] dirty hands of unbelief
[50:51] because if you handle it with dirty
[50:52] heads you kill the patient
[50:55] you understand he said well that applies
[50:56] to you preacher but no it applies to
[50:58] every one of us
[51:00] every one of us has to handle the word
[51:02] in our lives every one of us is
[51:04] responsible to the people that we meet
[51:06] and excuse me for being maybe
[51:09] you you think well brother ben if you
[51:12] just
[51:12] if you just preach something to make a
[51:14] shout but you know this ought to make a
[51:15] shout
[51:16] because i couldn't clean my own hands
[51:21] if i've got clean hands to handle the
[51:23] word with without it's not anything i
[51:24] did
[51:26] i had to go through the waters of
[51:28] separation
[51:30] i had to pass through by those seven
[51:31] stripes i had to
[51:33] i had to take the ashes and put them in
[51:36] the water and walk through
[51:37] and go in into the holy of holies
[51:42] and receive the spirit the life of that
[51:44] when the blood cell was broken the life
[51:46] left the bloodstone to come back on me
[51:48] and to be able to do that
[51:50] to be able to receive that there it had
[51:52] to be him that did it
[51:54] i couldn't do that for myself i couldn't
[51:58] clean it for myself
[52:00] but see i can't clean my own hands
[52:01] someone how much water
[52:03] no matter how much of a chlorine
[52:04] solution no matter how much germ x i
[52:06] might use i can't clean
[52:07] my hands of the blood of christ
[52:11] it has to be by his spirit
[52:15] i have to be washed by the word
[52:18] see and he said this word of god must
[52:22] not be
[52:22] handled by dirty hands of unbelief
[52:26] it's got to be a clean man and if he's
[52:28] clean he had to come through god's
[52:30] filter
[52:32] amen a clean man clean hands had to be
[52:34] kept in a clean place
[52:36] not a place where jezebels and ricky's
[52:37] and everything for taking
[52:39] take to communion and things when
[52:41] they're running around with wives and
[52:42] husbands and all kinds of filth going to
[52:44] dances and parties
[52:45] wearing bobbed hair and shorts and
[52:46] everything else call themselves
[52:48] christians just to be kept in a clean
[52:50] place
[52:51] handled with clean hands and then when
[52:54] israel sinned and recognized that they
[52:56] had done wrong
[52:56] then they were sprinkled with the ashes
[52:58] of this heifer upon them
[53:00] that was the water of separation of
[53:02] purification for sin
[53:04] he said notice here it is and when
[53:06] israel before they could come into
[53:08] fellowship in the worship
[53:09] they had the first pass through the
[53:11] waters of separation
[53:13] justification by faith cometh he said by
[53:16] hearing
[53:16] hearing the word amen
[53:20] he said then they entered into the
[53:22] congregation under those seven stripes
[53:24] the blood
[53:24] to show that something died and went
[53:27] before them for their sin
[53:29] they were separated by hearing the word
[53:31] the waters of separation and then
[53:33] entered into fellowship so it wasn't
[53:36] enough just to hear
[53:37] but it had to be take it took faith to
[53:40] believe the word and faith comes
[53:42] by hearing of the word of god you had to
[53:44] hear it in order to have the faith
[53:46] to come in to it right now they entered
[53:50] into fellowship now the only place that
[53:51] god met a man
[53:53] was behind that order he wouldn't meet
[53:55] him anywhere else
[53:57] he had to come behind that order god
[53:59] only met israel in one place
[54:02] and god only meets you today in one
[54:04] place
[54:05] and that's in jesus christ
[54:09] amen and he used the word
[54:12] the waters of separation and his blood
[54:15] was shed for all
[54:16] seven church ages and then by the holy
[54:19] spirit we enter into that fellowship
[54:21] which is only given to the church he
[54:24] said
[54:24] oh how great he is now this is something
[54:27] that
[54:29] if you would just go over that and
[54:30] ponder that and look back at the quotes
[54:32] that we've just read
[54:35] and let it speak to you you begin to
[54:37] realize what a great thing god has done
[54:39] for us in this day
[54:42] that we don't have to just come in and
[54:44] hear the word or go through the waters
[54:46] of separation where we can come all the
[54:47] way
[54:48] in to the holy of holies
[54:51] into fellowship with god which is
[54:54] only given to the church
[54:57] now you go back to the old testament and
[54:59] during that time
[55:01] they had to go through these waters of
[55:02] separation but there was no way
[55:04] to be really clean
[55:08] now think back what that must have been
[55:10] like you knew you were guilty
[55:13] but no way of being really clean
[55:18] without a sacrifice without christ's
[55:21] death on the cross
[55:23] we have no way of being clean we've got
[55:26] bloody hands you realize that unless you
[55:30] accept that
[55:32] what he did for you on that day you
[55:34] cannot clean your hands
[55:38] you can't get them clean enough no
[55:39] matter how many churches you go to
[55:41] no matter how many places you run to no
[55:43] matter how many good deeds that you do
[55:45] no matter how much you come and you pay
[55:46] your tithes to do the things that are
[55:48] right but if you don't ever
[55:49] accept what he did for you and line up
[55:52] to that word that he's given you in this
[55:53] hour
[55:54] you can't ever get your hands clean
[56:00] and you can go back and find a man as
[56:02] great as david
[56:04] and david longed to be clean
[56:07] but he could not under that
[56:10] testimony of the blood of bulls and
[56:12] goats he could only
[56:13] look forward to being clean
[56:17] he could only look forward to what we
[56:19] enjoy without him to be able to
[56:21] to stand here under that fountain and be
[56:24] able to be constantly
[56:25] consistently cleansed he couldn't do
[56:28] that
[56:29] david said wash me thoroughly
[56:32] he longed for it he's to wash me
[56:34] thoroughly from my iniquity
[56:36] in psalms 51 2 and cleanse me
[56:39] from my sin for i acknowledge my
[56:42] transgressions my sin is ever before me
[56:45] verse seven he said purge me with hyssop
[56:47] and i shall be clean wash me
[56:50] and i shall be whiter than snow he says
[56:51] i know you can do it god
[56:54] but he could not see the fulfillment of
[56:57] that
[56:58] until christ's death on the cross no
[57:01] matter how great of a man that he was
[57:04] had a heart after god's own heart but he
[57:07] couldn't
[57:08] once he had sinned he was you stuck
[57:11] it can only be covered put off to
[57:13] another time
[57:15] but now it can be done away with
[57:20] and in zechariah 13 1 it speaks of a
[57:22] time
[57:23] when the jewish nation you go back and
[57:25] read chapter 12
[57:26] how that they will speak one to another
[57:29] and they'll say where did you get those
[57:31] wounds and he'll say in the house of my
[57:32] friends
[57:35] and it's the day of atonement and then
[57:37] in zechariah 13 1 says in that day there
[57:40] shall be a fountain open
[57:42] in the house or to the house of david
[57:45] in that day when in that day of
[57:47] atonement when they realize what they've
[57:49] done
[57:50] when that 144 000 elected jews begin to
[57:53] realize what they did
[57:54] in that day there will be a fountain
[57:57] open oh my
[57:58] you talk about the grace of god after
[58:02] they've rejected him for
[58:03] for thousands of years there will be a
[58:05] fountain open for to the inhabitants of
[58:09] jerusalem for sin
[58:10] and for uncleanness you say well what
[58:13] would that fountain be it'll be christ
[58:15] it'll be christ it'll have to be amen
[58:18] the same water that we're washed with
[58:20] today that provides cleansing to us will
[58:22] provide cleansing to them
[58:24] but i want to tell you that today
[58:26] there's a fountain open
[58:28] in the house of david in the spiritual
[58:31] house of david to the spiritual
[58:34] to the spiritual seed of abraham there's
[58:36] a fountain opened today
[58:38] to the inhabitants of spiritual
[58:40] jerusalem there's a fountain opened
[58:41] today to the bride
[58:43] for sin and for uncleanness
[58:47] we have to be washed
[58:50] you see we need to be washed to prevent
[58:52] death
[58:53] we need to be washed also to abide in
[58:55] the vine
[58:56] and to bear fruit
[59:00] when we are born again the waters of
[59:02] separation we pass through that and
[59:04] it cleanses the soul it never has to be
[59:08] washed again
[59:11] and yet there's trouble because
[59:15] we're caught in a body of flesh and a
[59:18] great man like apostle paul
[59:20] could cry out and say oh wretched man
[59:23] that i
[59:23] am who shall deliver me from these dead
[59:26] bodies
[59:27] right this decaying body the body of
[59:30] this death
[59:32] i'm like a doctor going up in the
[59:33] morning and touching all the dead bodies
[59:35] and then coming down
[59:36] trying to deliver a baby
[59:40] who should deliver me from the body of
[59:42] this dead how can i get
[59:43] clean because i touch the world every
[59:46] day
[59:49] every everywhere i walk there's there's
[59:52] problems and
[59:53] and everywhere i go i make mistakes and
[59:55] everywhere you say well
[59:57] preacher you don't sound like much of a
[59:58] christian no i am a christian
[1:00:01] but we still make mistakes and you do
[1:00:03] too
[1:00:05] if you don't think you do that's your
[1:00:06] mistake
[1:00:10] right but you know you're saved
[1:00:13] you were there you went through the
[1:00:15] waters of separation
[1:00:17] you walked through you you've been to
[1:00:18] that fountain you drank from those
[1:00:21] waters
[1:00:22] but now you find yourself unclean
[1:00:25] you feel unclean though your soul has
[1:00:27] been washed
[1:00:29] you feel unclean we find ourselves
[1:00:32] needing to be washed
[1:00:33] why is that it was after the last supper
[1:00:38] jesus and you will find it in john
[1:00:40] chapter 13. he says
[1:00:42] he loves his disciples and he loved them
[1:00:44] to the end i love
[1:00:45] that but it goes on down the aisle how
[1:00:49] he washed their feet and
[1:00:51] how they ought to do that and then in
[1:00:54] john 13 8 peter
[1:00:56] he comes to peter he goes and he washes
[1:00:58] all the feet of the disciples he comes
[1:01:00] to peter
[1:01:00] and peter says not me i said you'll
[1:01:03] never wash my feet
[1:01:05] see there's a certain pride in
[1:01:07] exaggerated humility
[1:01:12] you'll never wash my feet i can't take
[1:01:15] communion that you know i can't do that
[1:01:17] i
[1:01:17] never have done that i've been in the
[1:01:18] church 40 years never taken it not going
[1:01:20] to do it now
[1:01:21] it's pride
[1:01:25] you wanna know how you can take
[1:01:26] communion repent
[1:01:30] that's all i can do
[1:01:34] you wanna know how you can be how you
[1:01:36] can be worthy to watch the saints feet
[1:01:39] to take communion
[1:01:40] to live for god repent
[1:01:44] that's all it takes repent turn from
[1:01:47] your sin
[1:01:48] make things right but there's a pride in
[1:01:49] that you won't wash my feet
[1:01:53] and jesus said if i wash thee not thou
[1:01:55] hast no part with me
[1:01:59] and so simon peter being the man that he
[1:02:02] was it was all or nothing
[1:02:04] but hurry we talked about the other day
[1:02:06] simon peter didn't see any gray area
[1:02:08] black and white and so he says
[1:02:12] he says well he said if you if if you
[1:02:15] have to wash me
[1:02:16] he said not just my feet wash my hands
[1:02:19] and my head
[1:02:21] every part of me that don't have clothes
[1:02:23] on wash me
[1:02:26] and jesus said he that is washed don't
[1:02:28] need to need it's not safe to wash your
[1:02:30] feet i was putting arkansas language in
[1:02:32] there
[1:02:34] you don't need to wash the rest of his
[1:02:36] body
[1:02:38] but it's clean every wit he said you're
[1:02:41] clean but not all he said you're clean
[1:02:43] you're clean but let me wash your feet
[1:02:48] he said he knew who should betray him
[1:02:49] therefore said he you're not all clean
[1:02:52] so judas couldn't be cleaned by the word
[1:02:55] even though he had all the miracles and
[1:02:58] the signs
[1:02:59] that the rest of them did he wasn't
[1:03:01] clean
[1:03:03] he walked with them he was called to
[1:03:05] preach just like they were
[1:03:07] he was ordained by jesus himself to go
[1:03:10] out and perform miracles but he wasn't
[1:03:11] washed
[1:03:13] he wasn't cleaned oh my
[1:03:17] now so as they walk they would get their
[1:03:19] feet dirty your soul is clean to the
[1:03:21] word but your feet need to be washed
[1:03:23] my feet need to be washed and if we
[1:03:26] refuse i think spiritually now if you
[1:03:28] refuse
[1:03:29] to have your feet washed you have no
[1:03:31] part in christ
[1:03:35] jesus explains this further in john
[1:03:37] chapter 15 in verse 1
[1:03:38] he says i am the true vine my father is
[1:03:40] the husbandman
[1:03:42] every branch in me that beareth not
[1:03:44] fruit he taketh away
[1:03:46] every branch that beareth fruit he
[1:03:48] purgeth it
[1:03:50] that it may bring forth more fruit he
[1:03:51] cleans it he cleanses it
[1:03:54] he prunes it you would think that
[1:03:58] he would just purge the ones that
[1:03:59] weren't bearing fruit no he takes them
[1:04:01] away
[1:04:02] but every branch that bears fruit you
[1:04:04] say well i'm doing good
[1:04:06] time for a purging
[1:04:10] we've been through that haven't we well
[1:04:13] i'm doing pretty good i've got
[1:04:14] everything going good and everything
[1:04:16] seemed like it's smoothed out
[1:04:17] time for a purging
[1:04:20] time for a purging and and so
[1:04:23] what he says is i'm gonna take out
[1:04:26] whatever is not right
[1:04:27] so you can bear more fruit you bore
[1:04:30] fruit in your life he said but now i'm
[1:04:32] going to purge out that which is not
[1:04:34] right so you can bear more fruit
[1:04:36] so he says now you are clean
[1:04:39] through the word which i have spoken
[1:04:42] unto you
[1:04:44] it doesn't say you're clean because you
[1:04:45] shouted you're not clean because you
[1:04:47] spoke in tongues you're not clean
[1:04:48] because you cast out devils you're clean
[1:04:50] through the word you're clean to the
[1:04:53] word amen
[1:04:55] and and the word actually cleanses you
[1:04:58] not just once but every day
[1:05:03] now verse four he said abide in me and i
[1:05:06] in you as the branch cannot bear fruit
[1:05:08] of itself except to abide in the vine
[1:05:10] no more can ye except you abide in
[1:05:13] me i am the vine you are the branches he
[1:05:15] that abideth in me and i in him
[1:05:17] the same bringeth forth much fruit for
[1:05:20] without me you can do
[1:05:22] nothing if a man abide not in me
[1:05:26] is cast forth as a branch and has
[1:05:27] withered men gather them and cast them
[1:05:29] into the fire and they are burned
[1:05:31] if you abide in me and my words abide in
[1:05:33] you
[1:05:34] you shall ask what you will and it shall
[1:05:36] be done unto you
[1:05:38] herein is my father glorified that you
[1:05:41] bear much fruit so shall you be my
[1:05:43] disciples listen
[1:05:45] you want to be able to speak and things
[1:05:47] happen you have to go through the
[1:05:48] purging time
[1:05:51] you want to be able to to ask what you
[1:05:54] will and all of us do
[1:05:57] you got to go through a washing time you
[1:06:00] got to stand
[1:06:01] under the fountain and let your life be
[1:06:04] washed
[1:06:04] all of your life you will be pruned and
[1:06:07] purged
[1:06:09] he doesn't leave you and come back later
[1:06:11] but he abides with you and you abide in
[1:06:13] him
[1:06:15] you abide in the vine he purges and you
[1:06:18] don't understand
[1:06:19] we don't understand why sometimes
[1:06:21] someone will be left in a nursing home
[1:06:23] for years
[1:06:24] i don't understand that but joe i don't
[1:06:26] understand why
[1:06:27] a man be a christian all this life or a
[1:06:29] woman to be a christian all her life and
[1:06:31] she gets down to the end and her
[1:06:35] she's so decrepit and and not able to
[1:06:37] hardly move and
[1:06:38] unable to take care of herself almost a
[1:06:40] vegetable why does god allow them to
[1:06:42] live
[1:06:44] you want to explain a mystery explain
[1:06:46] that one we don't know
[1:06:48] but there's something god is doing
[1:06:52] he's purging he's doing something
[1:06:56] forgive me for being personal but when
[1:06:58] my dad had cancer
[1:07:00] and i watched him there dying he's been
[1:07:01] a healthy man all of a sudden he gets
[1:07:03] cancer
[1:07:04] a year later he's gone at the age i
[1:07:07] believe in 57
[1:07:09] and he's there in the hospital and i
[1:07:10] watched him
[1:07:12] and at that point and you all know what
[1:07:14] this is a person can suffer so much that
[1:07:17] you're relieved
[1:07:18] when they pass and that's the way it was
[1:07:21] my first feeling and i almost felt
[1:07:23] guilty about it because
[1:07:24] i felt that i was relieved by the fact
[1:07:26] that he passed away because he just
[1:07:28] wasn't suffering anymore
[1:07:30] but i didn't understand the suffering
[1:07:32] part and understand that if you're going
[1:07:34] to die
[1:07:35] and you're not going to be raised up
[1:07:36] then why not just why not just go
[1:07:40] but see what what happens is god as long
[1:07:43] as there's life
[1:07:44] there at all he's able to work even if
[1:07:47] it's on a subconscious level
[1:07:49] even if they can't talk or speak or
[1:07:51] somehow he's working
[1:07:53] somehow he's purging he's still using
[1:07:55] that
[1:07:56] if for nothing else than to remind us
[1:07:58] this is not our home
[1:08:01] and if there were no pain here we would
[1:08:03] never be ready for another side
[1:08:05] but because we've gone through 2020
[1:08:07] because we've gone through
[1:08:09] the things that we've had we've had to
[1:08:10] fight through the pain and our bodies
[1:08:12] maybe are not what they used to be
[1:08:13] you begin to realize there's a better
[1:08:15] place
[1:08:16] there's a place where there is no pain
[1:08:19] there's a place where i won't have to
[1:08:21] slow down until i stop there's a place
[1:08:23] beyond this place
[1:08:26] amen i read today forgive me for
[1:08:29] digressing from my notes but
[1:08:30] it's wednesday night so i read today
[1:08:34] that
[1:08:35] the people who were most scared they did
[1:08:37] a survey if
[1:08:39] if you thought you were likely to die
[1:08:42] from covet 19 and the people most scared
[1:08:46] are people my age
[1:08:48] the people my age think they're likely
[1:08:51] to die at a rate
[1:08:53] that people over 65 are actually likely
[1:08:56] to die at
[1:08:58] and the people over 65 have a pretty
[1:09:00] good idea
[1:09:01] about what rate the rate that they
[1:09:03] picked was just about right
[1:09:06] but the people my age put it actually
[1:09:08] worse than theirs
[1:09:10] you think why why would that be you know
[1:09:13] there's something that's going on
[1:09:15] where we don't realize we haven't been
[1:09:18] through enough
[1:09:21] to realize how hard life is
[1:09:25] and so we think this happens we're going
[1:09:27] to die
[1:09:29] and i don't mean to belittle anyone
[1:09:31] because i know there have been people my
[1:09:32] age died of that and i come through it
[1:09:34] and god blessed me and i i don't want to
[1:09:36] belittle that at all but
[1:09:38] but you realize that people my age just
[1:09:40] haven't been through enough
[1:09:42] once you've been through enough you say
[1:09:43] you don't understand i could die any day
[1:09:46] paul says that you know you take that
[1:09:47] scripture it works two ways
[1:09:49] he says i die daily we know he dies
[1:09:51] spiritually but he's also talking about
[1:09:53] the fact that he was submitted to that
[1:09:56] he's saying every day i go i could get
[1:09:58] stoned i could i've been thrown
[1:09:59] i've been thrown shipwrecked so many
[1:10:01] times i've been beaten he says
[1:10:03] every day i'm subject to death every day
[1:10:06] i'm ready and i'm prepared and he said
[1:10:08] for me
[1:10:08] to live is christ to die is gain
[1:10:11] he'd been through enough that he knew it
[1:10:13] didn't matter god was going to have his
[1:10:15] will god was going to do what he was
[1:10:16] going to do
[1:10:18] and at some point we have to come to
[1:10:19] that place we're going to be pruned
[1:10:21] we're going to be purged
[1:10:23] we're going to be cleansed
[1:10:27] and the soul doesn't need that the soul
[1:10:29] he's not putting our soul
[1:10:30] through that he's he's forming our
[1:10:33] character
[1:10:35] but our soul is saved we're perfect in
[1:10:38] his sight
[1:10:39] but job was perfect in his sight and he
[1:10:41] said hey devil here you go
[1:10:47] oh my now look he says
[1:10:50] hearing my father glorified that you
[1:10:52] bear much fruit so shall you be my
[1:10:54] disciples
[1:10:56] and again he doesn't leave you and come
[1:10:57] back later you abide in the vine so you
[1:10:59] have to be washed
[1:11:01] in order to bear fruit
[1:11:04] if you're not washed if you don't allow
[1:11:06] yourself to be washed by the word
[1:11:08] you will get dirty to a point where you
[1:11:10] have no testimony
[1:11:14] and people around you begin to see
[1:11:15] that's not what a christian does
[1:11:17] because you've refused to walk in the
[1:11:19] light you've refused to walk in the word
[1:11:21] you've refused to be
[1:11:22] corrected by the word and so your feet
[1:11:25] get dirty
[1:11:28] and you've seen it people that were real
[1:11:30] christians you knew they were a
[1:11:31] christian but
[1:11:32] something happened in their life and
[1:11:33] they just refused any longer to be
[1:11:35] corrected by the word and so they begin
[1:11:37] to wander
[1:11:38] their feet begin to wander god has a way
[1:11:41] of bringing us back doesn't he
[1:11:43] aren't you glad for the mercies of god
[1:11:49] we needed to be washed thirdly because
[1:11:51] we're going to be the wife of a king
[1:11:54] we're going to be the wife of the king
[1:11:57] and the wife of the king before she
[1:11:59] could come to the king had to be washed
[1:12:02] you find that in the story of esther
[1:12:03] that they washed your purifier for 12
[1:12:06] months
[1:12:07] before she could come to the king
[1:12:10] and ezekiel in the old testament uses
[1:12:12] very vivid imagery
[1:12:14] to speak of the wife of jehovah
[1:12:16] constantly backsliding
[1:12:19] and it's just what you know as a wife
[1:12:22] israel wasn't a very good wife and the
[1:12:25] prophets point that out
[1:12:27] they were constantly if we could put it
[1:12:29] in the modern vernacular
[1:12:30] cheating on god committing adultery is
[1:12:33] the biblical term
[1:12:34] which i think we ought to use more often
[1:12:37] they were constantly
[1:12:38] committing adultery on god with other
[1:12:42] gods in ezekiel 16 8 if you go back and
[1:12:45] read the first few verses he talks about
[1:12:47] how
[1:12:47] that he found them like like a baby
[1:12:49] they've been born and cast away
[1:12:52] and uses the vivid imagery they were
[1:12:54] there in their own blood and
[1:12:56] and they hadn't even been cared for as a
[1:12:58] baby and he comes and he takes that
[1:13:00] little baby
[1:13:01] and he finds it he washes it
[1:13:04] and he cleans it up and he puts it and
[1:13:06] he takes care of it and lets somebody
[1:13:08] take care of it and then
[1:13:09] after a while it grows up and and in
[1:13:12] verse eight he said now when i passed by
[1:13:14] thee and looked upon thee behold thy
[1:13:15] time was a time of love in other words
[1:13:17] you were of an
[1:13:17] age where you could be married and he
[1:13:20] said and i spread my skirt over thee
[1:13:22] which that was
[1:13:23] the idiom for for being married he
[1:13:25] engaged to them
[1:13:27] cover thy nakedness yeah i swear unto
[1:13:29] thee
[1:13:30] enter into a covenant with thee saith
[1:13:32] the lord god
[1:13:33] thou became as mine
[1:13:37] then i washed thee with water
[1:13:40] yea i thoroughly washed away thy blood
[1:13:43] from thee
[1:13:45] and i anointed thee with oil
[1:13:50] all the uncleanness that they had done
[1:13:52] all the things that they'd been caught
[1:13:54] up in they were just like any other
[1:13:55] people
[1:13:56] they were just as prone to idolatry as
[1:13:58] any other people but god picked
[1:14:00] them up and he took care of them and
[1:14:01] then they grew to a certain age he
[1:14:03] married to them he said you're my wife
[1:14:06] you belong to me i'll take care of you
[1:14:08] he washed him with water
[1:14:10] he anointed them with oil he said i
[1:14:12] clothed the also embroidered work and
[1:14:14] shodzy with badger skin
[1:14:16] and i girded thee about with fine linen
[1:14:18] i covered thee with silk i decked you
[1:14:20] with ornaments i put bracelets on the
[1:14:22] hands a
[1:14:23] chain on my neck he's using this vivid
[1:14:25] imagery of a
[1:14:26] of an eastern wife that would be getting
[1:14:28] ready
[1:14:30] for a wedding he said thus without
[1:14:32] decked with gold and silver and thy
[1:14:34] rainbow was a fine linen and silk
[1:14:35] embroidered work
[1:14:37] that is to eat fine flour and honey and
[1:14:39] all
[1:14:40] that was succeeding beautiful thou just
[1:14:43] prosper into a kingdom
[1:14:45] thyroid now went forth among the heathen
[1:14:47] for thy beauty
[1:14:49] for it was perfect through my comeliness
[1:14:52] which i had put upon thee saith the lord
[1:14:54] god
[1:14:55] say you were beautiful because i made
[1:14:56] you beautiful
[1:14:59] don't ever forget that i got two
[1:15:00] beautiful girls i got three beautiful
[1:15:02] girls sitting back here but
[1:15:04] my two little daughters you're beautiful
[1:15:07] but you're beautiful because god made
[1:15:08] you beautiful
[1:15:11] if as a church we have any beauty it's
[1:15:13] because god made it that
[1:15:18] he said and it went all through the
[1:15:20] heathen it was
[1:15:21] perfect through my commonliness which i
[1:15:22] had put upon thee saith the lord god
[1:15:25] but thou didst trust in thine own beauty
[1:15:28] and place the harlot because of thy
[1:15:30] renown
[1:15:32] and poured out thy fornications on every
[1:15:34] one that passed by
[1:15:36] as it was
[1:15:40] that you just didn't settle for one god
[1:15:42] every one that come by you grabbed hold
[1:15:43] of it
[1:15:45] every time there was an opportunity to
[1:15:47] go and find another god you found them
[1:15:52] they refused to be washed
[1:15:56] they just stayed there like those
[1:15:58] doctors that refused to hear
[1:16:00] and and people died because of it
[1:16:03] but they just refused to be washed
[1:16:07] but see god wasn't going to leave it
[1:16:09] like that
[1:16:11] you're going to have a bride eve refused
[1:16:14] to be washed by the water of the word
[1:16:16] but he was going to have a bride
[1:16:19] would not refuse and so israel
[1:16:22] continually refused to be washed by the
[1:16:23] word but he would have a bride
[1:16:25] who would not refuse to be washed
[1:16:29] brother branham deals with that in the
[1:16:30] invisible union of the bride of christ i
[1:16:32] know you know these things but
[1:16:34] i want to just bring it to our
[1:16:35] remembrance tonight he said he
[1:16:37] the bridegroom took away your shame
[1:16:41] brought you out of the field where you
[1:16:43] were washed the blood off
[1:16:44] of you aren't you glad he did amen
[1:16:48] he took away your shame put it in the
[1:16:50] sea of forgetfulness by the washing of
[1:16:52] the water the word and the blood of life
[1:16:54] he said that's what the bible said your
[1:16:57] first husband that you were married to
[1:16:58] the world
[1:16:59] the anointed bridegroom which for
[1:17:01] ordained you has washed you
[1:17:03] by the washing of the water he said by
[1:17:06] the church
[1:17:07] he said no that don't sound right does
[1:17:09] it you might find that in the almanac
[1:17:11] but not in god's bible
[1:17:13] you're washed not by the church but by
[1:17:15] the washing of the water by the word
[1:17:18] in the word he said see you are standing
[1:17:22] completely justified as though you never
[1:17:25] did it at the beginning
[1:17:28] amen hallelujah
[1:17:31] oh they thought you know if we
[1:17:34] recognized that the blood was on our
[1:17:35] hands that we could say now
[1:17:37] i never did that
[1:17:40] i never handled the word that way
[1:17:41] because he said you didn't do it in the
[1:17:43] first place
[1:17:45] very bad he washed us
[1:17:48] he said put in the sea of forgetfulness
[1:17:52] amen he said and you are standing
[1:17:53] completely justified as so
[1:17:55] you never did it at the beginning said
[1:17:57] this is my message to the church now
[1:17:59] as we go off the air in just a minute
[1:18:01] you're standing if you're standing on
[1:18:03] god's word and with god's word
[1:18:05] every amen now notice what he says
[1:18:08] watch closely we want to be standing
[1:18:11] completely justified don't we
[1:18:14] then where do we have to be standing on
[1:18:17] god's word and with god's word
[1:18:22] the one goes with the other in order to
[1:18:25] be standing completely justified
[1:18:28] as though we never did it at the
[1:18:29] beginning
[1:18:31] amen we have to be standing on god's
[1:18:33] word and with god's word
[1:18:35] every amen every jot every tittle
[1:18:42] that's why it matters what we believe
[1:18:45] matters what we say behind this pulpit
[1:18:50] every man every jot every tittle because
[1:18:53] that's where we stand
[1:18:55] we got to stand on something how do you
[1:18:56] know you're justified if you can't
[1:18:58] believe the word
[1:19:00] if you can't stand on the word how can
[1:19:01] you ever have your sins forgiven
[1:19:04] you're trying to trust on the
[1:19:05] benevolence of a god
[1:19:07] that you're not sure if he'll really
[1:19:09] forgive you or not
[1:19:11] but we have an assurance that we know
[1:19:13] our sins are forgiven why
[1:19:15] because the word says it is not because
[1:19:18] we cried at altar and i i got nothing
[1:19:20] against that i i'll be the first one
[1:19:22] there many times
[1:19:23] i'll be the first one there but that's
[1:19:25] not how we know that we're saved
[1:19:28] we don't know we're saved because we
[1:19:30] jump or we shouted or we went through
[1:19:31] the prayer line or whatever it was
[1:19:33] we know we're saved because the word
[1:19:34] says
[1:19:39] the word says if we believe and are
[1:19:40] baptized we'll receive the gift of the
[1:19:42] holy ghost if we repent and are baptized
[1:19:44] the word says that then if i follow that
[1:19:47] prescription i pass through those waters
[1:19:49] of
[1:19:49] separation i've i've went into the holy
[1:19:52] of holies i've been there i've seen
[1:19:53] that's the kind of glory i'm standing on
[1:19:55] a rock
[1:19:57] you can't talk me out of that i can't
[1:19:59] talk you out of that
[1:20:01] i'm there and there might be times i
[1:20:03] need to have my feet washed there might
[1:20:05] be times i get dirt on me there might be
[1:20:07] times i get a bad attitude
[1:20:08] there might be times i get to mess with
[1:20:10] something i shouldn't be messing with
[1:20:12] but i know
[1:20:12] i can come right back to the water and i
[1:20:15] will not refuse to be washed because i'm
[1:20:17] his bride
[1:20:19] i will not refuse to stand in the word
[1:20:21] and on the word because i am his bride
[1:20:25] every child every child where are you
[1:20:26] standing he said i'm trying to tell you
[1:20:29] pull away from them shucks see you can't
[1:20:32] stand by them shucks and denominational
[1:20:34] systems
[1:20:36] and be on every word of god he said pull
[1:20:39] away from them shucks get out here in
[1:20:40] the wheat
[1:20:41] where you can get right before the sun i
[1:20:45] hear the coming
[1:20:46] of the combine very bad
[1:20:51] let me stop for just a moment listen
[1:20:55] people excuse me i'm losing my breath
[1:20:58] because i'm fat as i've told you before
[1:21:01] but you pray for your pastor
[1:21:04] that's some dirt i need to wash off
[1:21:09] somebody said amen
[1:21:13] he said he said get out in here in the
[1:21:16] wheat where you can get right before the
[1:21:17] sun i hear the coming of the combine
[1:21:19] you see some people's had to read that
[1:21:21] to get my train of thought back
[1:21:23] some people's religion is as flimsy as
[1:21:26] the next service well i'm not sure that
[1:21:30] i'm washed
[1:21:31] so i got to go to church to find out if
[1:21:33] i'm a christian
[1:21:35] and i believe in going to church more
[1:21:37] than anybody but i don't have to go here
[1:21:38] to find out i'm a christian
[1:21:40] i'm a christian because god says i am
[1:21:44] i'm a christian i'm his bride because he
[1:21:47] says i am
[1:21:48] and it doesn't rest on me going to
[1:21:51] enough meetings
[1:21:53] it doesn't rest on me no i want to go to
[1:21:54] meetings because i want to fellowship
[1:21:55] with god's people
[1:21:57] i want to hear god's word but my
[1:21:58] salvation don't rest on that
[1:22:00] my salvation doesn't rest on anything of
[1:22:02] this world
[1:22:04] your salvation does not rest on you
[1:22:06] going to this church as opposed to
[1:22:07] another one
[1:22:10] it's no more to you if you put your
[1:22:12] salvation in the church you're no
[1:22:13] different than the catholic
[1:22:15] who puts his salvation in the catholic
[1:22:16] church
[1:22:19] and so what but people are so flimsy
[1:22:22] to the point where you feel like they
[1:22:25] have you have to be re-saved and
[1:22:26] re-saved we ought to be able to hear the
[1:22:28] word straight
[1:22:29] and not have to be re-saved but we can
[1:22:32] hear the word we can say
[1:22:34] it could just let it wash us i don't
[1:22:36] have to redo the repentance that i've
[1:22:38] done in my life but let me be washed
[1:22:40] lord
[1:22:41] i can say amen to the word even if it's
[1:22:43] hard
[1:22:45] because i'm not deliberate i'm not going
[1:22:47] out here and just doing what the word
[1:22:48] says don't do
[1:22:50] right if i do that i'm not a christian
[1:22:54] he said well that's awful bold to say
[1:22:55] that it's the truth
[1:22:58] i sure don't have any influence of the
[1:23:00] holy spirit of my life if i can just
[1:23:01] walk down the road
[1:23:02] and do everything the word says don't do
[1:23:04] it just ignore it i've got blood on my
[1:23:06] hands
[1:23:07] i need to be cleansed
[1:23:10] but a christian can make mistakes but
[1:23:13] you come back
[1:23:15] you don't like if you're used to being
[1:23:17] clean you ever met
[1:23:19] somebody who hadn't been taken a bath in
[1:23:21] a long time
[1:23:23] you know if you go overseas forgive me
[1:23:25] but
[1:23:26] people are just different they just
[1:23:28] don't have the facility to take a bath
[1:23:30] every day
[1:23:31] and so you might walk up to somebody
[1:23:32] wearing a really nice suit and this
[1:23:34] really smells bad
[1:23:37] really smells bad why because they're
[1:23:39] just not used to it
[1:23:41] or they've gotten used to it they me i
[1:23:44] need a shower
[1:23:46] every morning i don't feel clean
[1:23:50] see as a believer you need to wash
[1:23:53] you need to be washed by the water of
[1:23:55] the word or you just don't feel clean
[1:23:56] there's something about it you're used
[1:23:58] to that
[1:24:00] amen and so brother brother says i hear
[1:24:03] the coming of the combine
[1:24:04] he said you're standing complete amen
[1:24:09] justify don't don't let anybody tell you
[1:24:11] that the bride is waiting on another
[1:24:12] prophet or another message to come
[1:24:14] because he said you're standing complete
[1:24:17] justified like you never did it in the
[1:24:19] first place
[1:24:21] hallelujah you're standing completely
[1:24:24] you never sinned at the first place
[1:24:25] god don't even know it's in the sea of
[1:24:28] forgetfulness hallelujah
[1:24:30] you never did it you were accused of it
[1:24:32] by the accuser
[1:24:33] but really from the beginning you were
[1:24:35] predestinated to be a son and daughter
[1:24:37] of god
[1:24:38] you're standing there washed your old
[1:24:40] book of divorcement is put away
[1:24:42] and it's dead absolutely out of
[1:24:44] existence even in the mind of god
[1:24:48] hallelujah you're the virtuous bride of
[1:24:51] christ
[1:24:53] washed in the blood of christ precious
[1:24:55] virtuous sinless
[1:24:57] son of god standing
[1:25:01] oh my we ought to be able to shout about
[1:25:02] something like this
[1:25:05] oh my he said standing
[1:25:09] with a pure unadulterated bride word
[1:25:12] that he washed by the water of his own
[1:25:14] blood
[1:25:15] that it become flesh and manifested that
[1:25:18] he might take you which were
[1:25:19] predestinated in the bosom of the father
[1:25:21] before the beginning
[1:25:22] the same as he was he was that great
[1:25:25] attribute of god called
[1:25:27] love whatever you are
[1:25:31] you're a servant of god whatever god
[1:25:34] wants you to do where your place
[1:25:36] is god placed in the church
[1:25:39] some apostles prophets teachers pastors
[1:25:41] he placed that by virtue of his own
[1:25:43] predestination
[1:25:44] you were that to begin with
[1:25:47] amen your first wedding was an old
[1:25:51] it was you've never done it in the first
[1:25:52] place because there's only one thing
[1:25:54] could do it that would be god come down
[1:25:56] himself
[1:25:57] took your place in a form of the son of
[1:25:59] god jesus christ
[1:26:01] washed you by the water of the washing
[1:26:03] of the water by the word
[1:26:06] amen the word not the denomination the
[1:26:09] word washed you
[1:26:13] the devil's telling me i'm overdoing it
[1:26:15] tonight but you know what
[1:26:17] i said last wednesday night i want to
[1:26:19] give the devil a black eye we've been
[1:26:20] doing it
[1:26:22] we've been doing it you're fighting
[1:26:25] every
[1:26:25] you know they say right now there's one
[1:26:27] third of all people who
[1:26:29] regularly went to church before this
[1:26:30] happened for the coven 19 thing come on
[1:26:33] don't go to church anymore
[1:26:36] and if you talk to denominational
[1:26:38] pastors they'll tell you most of them
[1:26:39] will never come back
[1:26:42] thank god that you've got a desire to be
[1:26:43] in the house of god
[1:26:45] there's something there and i know we we
[1:26:47] want to be careful we want to do
[1:26:48] everything that we can to be safe
[1:26:50] but there's something inside of you you
[1:26:51] want to be in the house of god
[1:26:53] why because you're his bride you want to
[1:26:56] be washed by the word he said but if you
[1:26:58] won't stand
[1:26:59] in the water of the word how are you
[1:27:00] going to be washed
[1:27:02] you're still as spotted as eve was
[1:27:06] and this is why i asked the question
[1:27:07] sunday do you want to be well
[1:27:09] because if you want to be well you have
[1:27:11] to stand in the word
[1:27:13] you got to stand under the water of the
[1:27:15] word and let it wash you let it correct
[1:27:17] you oh lord i i didn't realize

[1:27:41] let me get rid of those things let me be
[1:27:44] washed by the word
[1:27:46] if i can't believe for my healing let
[1:27:48] the words of healing wash over me until
[1:27:50] i can believe again
[1:27:52] if i can't believe if i if i stand there
[1:27:55] because sin is unbelief
[1:27:57] and if i'm if i'm standing there let me
[1:28:00] be washed until i believe again

[1:29:24] sin you can't be washed by the word
[1:29:26] standing in a place of doing things you
[1:29:27] know is wrong
[1:29:29] you can't be washed by the word you have
[1:29:30] to submit yourself to the word
[1:29:33] it's not the things that you don't know
[1:29:35] it's the things you do know
[1:29:38] the things that i do know then we go
[1:29:41] through life
[1:29:43] and get dirty but the word is there
[1:29:48] and we don't have to worry about going
[1:29:50] to an old cistern to wash in
[1:29:53] we got good water and
[1:29:56] artesian well we don't have to worry
[1:29:59] we've got the good stuff
[1:30:01] doesn't make you feel better when you
[1:30:02] got the the branded uh
[1:30:04] germ-x i never thought they've come up
[1:30:06] with so much of that stuff now some of
[1:30:07] it
[1:30:07] don't smell very good some of it's got
[1:30:10] you know but you get
[1:30:11] the good stuff i got stuff some stuff
[1:30:14] back in my office i don't like to share
[1:30:16] and sister carl you may have left it
[1:30:19] back there but it's that
[1:30:20] that essential oils and i've kind of
[1:30:24] thought bad about that but this it's
[1:30:26] hand
[1:30:27] sanitizer that's made from essential
[1:30:28] oils that smells good
[1:30:31] that's the good stuff huh
[1:30:34] i got the good stuff and you know we
[1:30:36] we've got the good stuff
[1:30:38] we don't have to settle for the off
[1:30:40] brand we don't have to settle for a
[1:30:42] broken cistern
[1:30:45] why would we settle for some teacher out
[1:30:47] here somewhere trying to show us
[1:30:48] something we've had something been
[1:30:50] proved by god to be real
[1:30:53] why should we settle for some some false
[1:30:55] thing that comes up in the message and
[1:30:56] something come along and the wind blows
[1:30:59] this way and blows that way no
[1:31:00] i'm going to stay under the word i want
[1:31:02] to be washed
[1:31:05] the old pentecostals used to say
[1:31:06] musicians come the old pentecost did you
[1:31:09] say i want to stay under the spout where
[1:31:10] the glory comes out
[1:31:12] you ever heard them say that i want to
[1:31:14] stand on the spout where the glory comes
[1:31:16] out
[1:31:17] could i put it this way as the bride of
[1:31:19] christ i want to stay under the word
[1:31:22] i want to stay under that spout of the
[1:31:23] word to be washed
[1:31:26] by the water of the word you wanted
[1:31:29] evidence of the new
[1:31:30] birth it's a willingness to stay under
[1:31:32] that headship of the word to be washed
[1:31:34] by the word
[1:31:35] jesus said if i don't wash you you have
[1:31:36] no part in me
[1:31:40] esther says whatever you want me to wear
[1:31:42] i'll wear it
[1:31:43] look at her willingness look at mary she
[1:31:45] said be it unto me
[1:31:47] according to thy word
[1:31:51] whatever you have for me i want to
[1:31:52] fulfill that in my life
[1:31:55] and why does he do this he does it for
[1:31:58] the purpose of presenting to himself
[1:32:01] a sinless bride what a privilege
[1:32:05] to preach in this day i got thinking
[1:32:08] about this with alan today and i just
[1:32:10] it just it really got to me because i
[1:32:13] thought what a privilege to preach in
[1:32:14] this day
[1:32:15] because we preached sometimes to the
[1:32:16] eternal lost
[1:32:18] we know that but we also preach to a
[1:32:20] bride that can't fall
[1:32:24] and paul in that first church age
[1:32:25] preached to a bride that would fall
[1:32:28] preached to a bride that had to go go
[1:32:30] into the ground like a seed had to fall
[1:32:32] into the ground so it could be restored
[1:32:34] but we preached to a bride
[1:32:35] somewhere there's a bride i believe
[1:32:37] we're here tonight i believe this is a
[1:32:39] part of that bride
[1:32:40] somewhere there's a bride who will not
[1:32:41] fall from her position who will not fall
[1:32:44] into into into ungodliness who will not
[1:32:47] fall
[1:32:48] into unbelief but who will be restored
[1:32:51] all the way back
[1:32:52] who has been restored all the way back
[1:32:55] who's washed in the blood of the lamb
[1:32:59] aren't you glad you serve a god like
[1:33:01] that
[1:33:03] would you bow your heads with me
[1:33:07] what a privilege to preach in this day
[1:33:10] to be able to preach to you it's a bride
[1:33:14] who can be washed
[1:33:16] i don't have to worry about a hotbed
[1:33:18] plan or something
[1:33:20] i'm hurting your feelings every time i
[1:33:21] stand up here but i i know i've been
[1:33:23] washed by the word
[1:33:25] and i know you've been washed by the
[1:33:27] word you're willing to be washed by the
[1:33:28] word
[1:33:30] so you just if it's the word you take it
[1:33:32] if it's just me you leave it alone
[1:33:34] because you're his bride you're his
[1:33:37] bride
[1:33:39] i'm so grateful for that it gives me
[1:33:40] great courage and confidence to preach
[1:33:44] ought to give every one of us great
[1:33:45] courage and confidence to live
[1:33:48] to live our lives every day
[1:33:52] it may not be a hundred percent but i
[1:33:55] can be washed
[1:33:58] all i got to do is go down and find the
[1:34:00] fountain and i know where it's at
[1:34:02] i've got the good stuff i don't have to
[1:34:05] worry about
[1:34:06] going to some denomination from
[1:34:07] denomination to denomination from place
[1:34:09] to place
[1:34:10] i've got the good stuff don't have to
[1:34:13] worry about finding the best preacher
[1:34:15] the best
[1:34:15] the biggest church i've got the good
[1:34:18] stuff the message of the hour
[1:34:20] washes me daily the message of the hour
[1:34:23] that i've received
[1:34:24] it comes in my heart and begins to move
[1:34:27] through me and wash me
[1:34:28] from everything of the world and the
[1:34:31] things that i go
[1:34:32] through is just a purging in my life
[1:34:35] and sometimes it's hard it's almost
[1:34:36] impossibly hard
[1:34:38] i watch what some of you have been
[1:34:40] through and i think it's almost
[1:34:41] impossibly hard
[1:34:43] how could you sit here today i don't
[1:34:46] know i don't know what i would do if i'd
[1:34:48] been through what you've been through
[1:34:50] but i know this that he is able to keep
[1:34:53] you
[1:34:55] and paul says i i know in whom i have
[1:34:57] believed
[1:34:59] you've been through impossibly hard
[1:35:00] times
[1:35:02] but you sit here tonight because you
