feel the presence of the Lord we'll go ahead and change the order of the service over to our pastor brother Ben let's sing it song if we could I pledge allegiance to the lamb I have heard how Christians long ago they were brought before the time is home they were told that he was spare their lives they would renounce but the name of Christ the Son of God they would not deny like a great and generic why why I can almost hear the status here together [Music] the Lamb with all my strength with all I am I will see to honor his command I pledge allegiance to the course again [Music] with all I am I will seek to honor his command for I pledge the land now the years have come years have gone now the years have come and the years have gone oh but the cause of Jesus it still goes on our time has come our time has come to count [Music] to embrace the cross oh the one by one let us live our lives Allegiance [Music] [Music] [Music] oh with all my strength with all I am I will see to honor this is the man pledge allegiance The Lamb aren't you glad you're glad to have a lamb to pledge allegiance to this morning amen let's bow our hips together and father we're so grateful to be in your house this morning we couldn't thank you enough for the wonderful blessings that you've given us Lord of life and of Liberty to be able to worship together we're so grateful for that today I pray you bless each and every one that are here Lord listening this morning I pray that it would be more than just words that are spoken but Lord may it become a revelation in our hearts Lord your word is so important to us so we cherish it so much Lord so we put aside this moment of the day in just a few moments to forget about everything else and and let you speak to us Lord I pray you do that in a supernatural way this morning maybe there'd be someone that's sick this morning or in need or or just just needs to be encouraged in some way I pray you would do that by the ministry of your word Lord as we're gathered together for one purpose and that's to worship you with all of our hearts Lord I pray that would be done you would accept our worship today in Jesus name we ask it amen amen amen Psalm chapter 37 and verse 5 and then we'll read also from John 16 33. Psalm 37 5 and John 16 33 these scriptures were just going around in my mind all week I couldn't get away from it so I just have to to deal with this this morning and maybe just kind of different but uh kind of throw a curveball this morning but I trust it'll be a blessing to you I'm going to talk about the secret to cheerfulness the secret to cheerfulness Psalm 37 and 5 commit thy way unto the Lord trust also in him and he shall bring it to pass and then John 16 33 so these things I have spoken unto you that in me you might have peace in the world you shall have tribulation but be of good cheer I have overcome the world aren't you glad for that today amen God bless you you can have your seats cheerfulness is the quality or state of being noticeably happy and optimistic the quality or state of being noticeably happy and optimistic noticeably Charles Dickens said that cheerfulness and contentment are great beautifiers and famous preservers of good looks you can tell when somebody's cheerful it's different in a small way from happiness or joy because cheerfulness is what shows on the outside and say well I have joy on the inside but yet it matters what we are displaying on the outside as well cheerfulness is happiness that lasts and joy that shows itself and it's a pleasant disposition it's not just someone that's laughing all the time or or cutting up or telling jokes that that could be somebody who's really hurting and yet they do that to cover that up but cheerfulness is just a pleasant disposition it it ought to be our our default position our fallback position as Believers that we are not unhappy but we're happy we're not uh we're not the opposite of cheerfulness is melancholy we're not melancholy but we're actually in a state of cheerfulness and I know this is a hard a hard world that we live in to be able to keep that that kind of a mindset it's difficult because the world is there's so many reasons to be unhappy and I'll just tell you this this morning some of us are born with a little rain cloud a little black cloud following us around I remember the old cartoon of of uh of Eeyore the little donkey that would walk around and there's a little Cloud just just raining on him that's all that there was and wherever he was it rained and and whatever bad might happen it would happen to him and and some people are just that way I I will say this that I I'm born kind of with that under that state where it just seems like so I'm preaching it myself this morning seems like if something bad could happen it's going to happen to me and and it seems like that in fact my nickname growing up was Eeyore uh because it just seemed like I was always preparing myself for the worst for the salmon just always that way and it was just always something coming but I've had to fight that in my life and I want to tell you this is where you have to fight today there's got to be a place in your life where you you pick up your sword and say I'm not going to be just what I am or what the circumstances of my life dictate me to be I'm gonna be different I'm going to live according to the word and so a cheerfulness Jesus is telling his disciples be of good cheer be encouraged be be happy all the time have that as your default now there will be times when you'll be Melancholy but your everyday attitude is one of cheerfulness and someone has said that the eyes of the cheerful and of The Melancholy Man are fixed on the same creation but very different are the aspects which it Bears to them so in other words The Melancholy Man when he looks at a situation in life or just looks at the world in general everything is uh is is looking bad everything is looking wrong I I remember that uh a story someone told him that there was two kids that born in the same house and and they were very uh one was very optimistic and one was very negative and so they were born in the same house and and they called in a psychologist they said how how can we fix this he said well he said I'll tell you what we'll do he said we'll we'll give uh we'll take the one he's got his own room he said we'll take him he said we'll just take a bunch of that stuff out in the barn and said uh he's real positive so we'll tell him that he's getting some present we'll take a bunch of that stuff out of the barn and we'll put it in his room it'll just be a big pile of it and and uh in his room and and then he'll learn that there's nothing there and so he'll learn to correct that where he's not not just always over over positive and said well the other one what we'll do is we'll take in his room we'll put a great big pile of toys because he won't be expecting that so they did that and they they went in the room and they go in the room where the boy is that uh that got the great big uh pile of toys and he's in there just crying and a weeping he said I just know somebody else got more than I did and and I just know that these toys are going to be broken and they're just all going to go away and there's a catch to it somewhere and they went in the other room and here's this boy he's just a digging in this pile of dirt and he said uh with all this he said there must be a pony somewhere your State of Mind matters right so many people go into life with that you could give them everything yeah and they just never feel like it's enough and we don't want to be like that and but when you're cheerful very little bothers you now you know this is right I know this is right when your Melancholy everything bothers you and spiritual people are sometimes the most Melancholy I'll say this that brother Branham dealt with that and and it's people who have a an insight and a spiritual realm they're Melancholy people gifted people many times are are Melancholy and yet the The Melancholy or the depression that they go through the things that they go through that's not a spiritual attribute it's not a it's not part of the gift it's just something that's there they're made a certain way and they're more sensitive to things and I found musicians uh forgive me musicians here this morning we've got wonderful musicians but musicians tend to be more uh easier to how can I put this without without offending the musicians but musicians tend to be easier to offend than other people people are real musicians and it's just they they're more High Strung they're more tuned to that kind of a thing and it's that's just the way that they're built but when you look at that you begin to realize it's not a spiritual attribute and so if you're that way it doesn't make you more holy to be that way being sad does not make you holy right amen it doesn't make you more Godly it doesn't make you even recognizing all that's going wrong in the world doesn't make you more uh oh I I I'm up on the news and I understand all the bad things that are happening that does not make you more spiritual than somebody who doesn't look at it at all but it what it takes is it takes faith faith is what we operate off of we don't operate off emotion we don't operate off of the sensation we operate off of faith in the word that's where we're supposed to operate and the only way you can do that is to have the right kind of attitude towards the word now sometimes Melancholy is caused not all the time we'll get to one of the other reasons in a moment but sometimes Melancholy is caused by a lack of faith in the atonement and we know that that was true of Cain remember when Cain came before and I just want to use this to illustrate this morning I'm not calling you Cain so that's just the Melancholy talking but Cain was a man who he went to offer sacrifice and and he didn't have a revelation of the blood and so he went and he he worked hard and he cut he got his best fruits and his best vegetables and all the produce that he could find and he dug it up you know like many people do they think well if I get this certain understanding I would dig up this certain understanding this certain thing and and then God will accept me and and so he goes and he brings it out there and they have church to gather him and Abel and he realizes at some point Abel's getting blessed the fire of God is consuming what's on Abel's altar but it's not it's not touching his and so he begins to get really upset he begins to get Melancholy and and the Lord asked him he says why why is your countenance falling why are you visibly distressed why are why is your accountant as well why are you angry and the reason was because he he had trusted in his works that they would be able to get him uh that God would be pleased with them and I want us to be careful today because we do not trust in our works that'll make you sad every time that'll give you a Melancholy attitude when you trust well I go to church I pay my tithes those things are good we want you to do that but that's not what we trust in we don't trust in the fact that we have long dresses or long hair or the men do we don't cuss we don't chew we we want to live holy lives but we cannot put our trust in that because every time it's going to fail us you're going to look at that altar someday and you're going to look at yourself done it all and I'm still unhappy I'm still bitter and I'm still don't want to come to church I got to drag myself to church because you're just trusting and some people who you know you fall into sin and I would say that all of us at some point have backslid you backside you do something you shouldn't do and you fall into sin and and you come out of that and then you put your trust in well I'm better than I was but I'm telling you that's a mistake this morning because the next time you have a bad attitude or something comes along or or you fall in some way your trust is going to be shattered and there will be a moment when you when you in your life where you get to where you can't put confidence in almost anything it just seems like everything is out of control and it seems like the word isn't working the way it's supposed to in your favor there's going to be those times and the truth is we just don't understand the mind of God we don't think like God does we can't we can't operate in that sphere and we don't understand it's for our good we can't comprehend it and so it makes us Melancholy because we put our trust in the fact that things were working yeah but we don't put our trust in the fact that it works our trust in the fact we had a good service we don't put our trust in the fact that we came to church are you with me now but we put our trust in only in the blood of Jesus Christ listen to what he told Cain if thou doest well shalt thou not be accepted so now he said if you had had a revelation you would have brought the right sacrifice but the right sacrifice was not what you could do with the work of your hands it was blood so brother Brandon talking about that he said my he said so what we got to worry about yeah why are you walking along with a long face like to eat oats the bottom of a churn most of us have never experienced that like you got a bad sandwich at McDonald's they didn't give you all the fries said why he said my smile we're happy we're Christians and God has ordained us so and has given Christ for us and it begins to explain how we did not seek God yeah come on God sought us and he uses a scripture in John 6 44 no man can come to me except the Father which has sent me draw him and I will raise him up at the last day he said so now whether we live whether we die whether the world stands whether it doesn't whether the people thinks this or that there's only one alternative that we should have that's worship God and be just as happy as we can be believe him for everything he said because life or death or nothing can separate us from the love of God that's in Christ and there will be with him in his presence forever see a man who trusts in his works is still condemned because somehow he knows that God doesn't accept it but a man who trusts in the blood of Jesus Christ is free from condemnation the Bible says there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit right and brother Branham likened it to an eagle that would watch over their young ones he said the mama Eagle would fly up on on the side of the hill and here in the valley would be the little egress and and they had rode down there on her wings and and they were just down there having a Pentecostal Revival tumbling and and moving he said why aren't they scared some wolf could come out some cougar could come out some Predator could come out and try to a coyote could come out of the Wilderness and try to attack them and he's watching this scene taking place watching through binoculars and he said but what he didn't realize at first he said he saw that mother eagle and he realized she could get to them faster than any predator yeah so they had nothing to worry about she would never leave them in a place I hope you hear me this morning that she could not get to them faster than any predator listen to me that Christ will never lead you or leave you in a place where you cannot he cannot get to you faster than any predator faster than the enemy oh my the Bible says that the enemy is like a roaring lion seeking whom he made the power but this also says resist the enemy resist the devil and he'll flee from you amen so they're sitting there they're tumbling over each other they're being watched though while they're there so they can be carefree they can be happy they can have an attitude an attitude of cheerfulness there in the valley oh my an attitude of cheerfulness because because they know who's watching over them oh wonder about us today within this church service if we could have an attitude of cheerfulness because we know who's watching over us he said he's watching over you tonight he said just have a good time that's what he wants you to do be happy don't go along with a great long face he said be happy rejoice in the spirit there's no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus that won't not after the flesh but the spirit no condemnation to them that's in Christ Jesus that's laid aside every weight and the sin that so easily beset them amen listen again he said you can't fail do we need to get our eyes off our works he said you can't fail well um well if I don't the spirit of God might not move if we don't all if we don't all do exactly as we should we don't we we don't serve God like that you don't serve God out of fear we should want to show up to church early not because somebody makes us we should want to come to the house of God not because somebody got a gun to our head forced us to come to church it should be a desire there yeah because he said you can't fail there's no failing in it it don't rest upon what I do it rests upon what he did it's already finished the believer once anchored in Christ Jesus coming through the door back there now watch he said he's coming through the door put on this highway he said you can't get any way but straight up to God with it you've been on a one-way Street you know what one-way street is you're going one way you can't turn around it's one way he said this is a one-way Street the believer once anchored in Christ Jesus coming to the door back there put on this highway you can't get anyway but straight up to God within angels to take care of you he said God made a way of this yeah when he's seen in the beginning in our first parents fall he seen the Covenant he made with Adam he tried to hook the ladder into him and it failed he said then there's nothing else he could hook it to but to bring down his own son and hook it to him so it can't fail now he said so what are we worried about what are we stewing about come on now why we go along with a great big long face let's look up in grin look up and not only grin but laugh not only laugh but raise up holy hands everywhere giving praise and glory to God for his promises is yea and amen not yes and no not yes and no but yes he said there's no no in it yes our foundation stands sure the foundation of God laid in Zion the Cornerstone there we are can't slip can't side can't move oh my every time the Devil comes after you and tries to tell you look look what look what you're doing look what you are look look what's going on in the world I can't say it I can't side I can't move thus saith oh I hope you hear me today God sent a prophet in this day to tell you you can't slip you can't side you can't move [Applause] I break out of this Melancholy once in a while oh my he said then we come into the door through Christ put on here he said oh we may have our ups and downs along I mean we have ups and downs the rest of y'all aren't human y'all are angels we humans have ups and downs Oh my he said that's true in our sicknesses and troubles yeah but remember there's a great company of angels all along the road pair thee up at any time glory to God do we really believe it do we really believe it if you really believe it it creates an atmosphere of cheerfulness in your life because you know you're sitting there playing in the grass but he can get to you before anything bad could happen you are not going to go if you die and leave this earth that doesn't that doesn't build pressure for the remnants and letting off the pressure he said you don't even get under pressure because you're going to die he said because if you die you're just going home to be with him oh my it's not to get a hold of you say well I'm old and I'm under pressure yes I I feel that sometimes believe it or not I feel like well about half my life is over it makes you Melancholy but when you begin to dwell on the Promises of God he said you can't die he didn't believeth on me shall never die do we believe it today amen said he's there he promised it Hallelujah and he had to make a way of it you aren't always going to be cheerful things are going to make you sad yeah yeah and there's a time to grief it's time to cry there's a certain healing in that but you can't live that way right you just can't live your life like that sometimes Melancholy it's not sometimes it's not a lack of trust in the promise sometimes it's caused by change change in your life and I think all of us experience this well I know we all do the Bible says a merry heart maketh a cheerful countenance but by sorrow of the heart the spirit is broken and so there's Sorrows that come that make us sad sometimes and and changes that come and things many times that we don't even understand that we're going through because we go through Junctions in life and and I want you to listen closely because this will come this will come and and many times Well I we don't want it we're human beings we don't want to be foolish about these things we need to understand why there's times of life that we go through that's going to cause us pain and and it's going to cause a smelling call it's going to cause a sadness and it's just part of it and it's how we deal with that because that can break you just just life itself we'll break you if you let it you don't have to be born under any certain sort of curse for life to break you you could be born in the best home have the best raising the best family and life itself will break you unless you have confidence in God all right there's got to be a faith and a confidence there because there's going to be bad things happen life is suffering it is pain and I've told even my kids especially Peter lately I said you've got to embrace a little bit of pain in your life you've got to be willing to to push through and that's what we see so much of this in this generation it seems like kids and young people they're not willing to push through the pain to get the reward there's going to be pain sometimes you're going to be sick and you got to go to work anyway yeah yeah sometimes you're going to be you're going to hurt and you've got to you've got to get up and move on sometimes you're going to be in a moment how do you do it yeah I remember when my dad passed away and let me just be real personal to you for a moment but when dad passed away it was hard on us he died too young he died there were so many unresolved issues in so many ways and you all some of you have had family members like that that have passed away and you wonder some things have been different had they gotten older had they been able to live and I remember that one of the things that upset me is that everybody come in so there's like 300 people at the funeral and all these people that barely knew knew us but they were there because Dad got out a lot and he was very very uh gregarious very open to people and and so he uh he had a lot of people at the funeral and they come in and Mom's booking motel rooms and and uh and cooking for people and she don't know what I'm going to say this morning I didn't plan this if she's doing all that and I remember getting a little upset about that but you know what it helped her she's just doing what she normally did you know we did the day of the funeral we went into town we used to go to the to the rec center the community center and play ping pong the day of the funeral we went into town before the funeral and and did that and Mom sat there with us and watched us boys play ping pong that's what that's what we did that sounds cold doesn't it but we were just doing life sometimes you just have to move on you can't you can only take so much broker there'll be a time to grieve but you can only take so much and it does make you Melancholy it makes you sad when things happen still when I think of my father it brings just a touch of sadness and yet I believe my faith is strong enough that wasn't a perfect man but I believe I'll see him one day my faith is strong enough that one day I'm going to see him and I really believe that and how could I get through life listen Paul says if we don't believe in the resurrection we are of all men most miserable but if we do believe no matter what's happened for the steward no matter what the situation you might have you might have somebody that that just all your life you wish a relationship had been better but then they passed on you think how can I fix it but all the knots that we tie over here will be untied over there somehow we'll understand each other yeah he said well is everybody going to make it no not everybody's gonna make it but I believe for my family I believe for those in my family I believe for those in this church I believe for you that you're going to make it are you with me now I don't want one of you to be lost what am I doing I'm taking the example of Jesus Christ who said not one of them is lost except the Son of Perdition yeah not one oh my shouldn't we shouldn't we take that same attitude I believe my family will be saved it was hard to be cheerful when you go through something like that yeah it's difficult but sometimes you just need to do what you would normally do just have the attitude you would normally have it'll be okay how do you write you know you know Hattie right the most Supernatural story that we have in this message is how do you write to me more than the raising of the Dead because here's a widow woman who speaks herself and to me she's a type of the Bride operating under the word the third poll of brother Brandon's Ministry was the opening of the word and it was identified by the fact that she could she's the woman stood there with a woman stood there and said he said what do you want you speak it and it'll be and she asks for the right thing but had he had a sister named Edith and Edith had been sick all of her life in fact in that story brother random tells about Edith and how he said here's your sister she's been sick all these years if you say it should be well yeah but she was Edith was an interesting case brother Brandon said there was nothing wrong with her physically outside of infantile paralysis so she had had she'd become crippled when she was about six months old and so he tells that and she couldn't even move her limbs apart and he said she screamed and cried all of her life nearly he said to we prayed for him many years ago and she's been happy ever since until about a year ago so she had been going through some something in her life and and she's she's you'd think that just her condition because she's completely crippled and invalid you'd think that alone would be enough to not make her cheerful but it wasn't it wasn't right so much so that so much so that uh they noticed the family noticed when she lost it when she quit being happy she quit being cheerful and I would present you this morning that it's not what you're going through that's making you unhappy as much as it is what's around you or how you respond to what's around you yeah now look well I know it's difficult to think of but think about it one of the happiest people I've ever known was a young man named Tommy Thomas who couldn't even speak but he my grandpa had him there and he he was a foster child and they adopted him I believe they adopted him and he was sitting there in the living room and and in a wheelchair he couldn't even speak all he could do but when Grandpa would come in the room his eyes would light up he couldn't make he just makes sounds but he gets so excited when my grandpa come in the room he was a happy young man he's about my age I think he's passed away now but he was from from birth he was very very sick but he couldn't even speak he couldn't maybe understand the way we understand but he was happy he was cheerful cheered you up to be around him you don't have to be well to be cheerful I know that's hard and you know it's not just we look at somebody with all kinds of illness you know but you take some of us guys you know we get the man flu I'll just talk about us because we can take it but we get down a little bit I do this I do this on Mondays you know after you get you know you get kind of tired and you preach through a little illness and a little sickness and you get grouchy Joel gets grouchy after a church man he's so pleasant in church but you you just see him after he preaches and just grouchy it's all good just just bite your head off you know and and I do that too I do that constantly just just as soon as I get come down out of the anointing and you'll get you feel bad and and yet it's not you know we could break out of that we don't have to do that and again everybody's going to be unhappy sometimes but but we can't stay like that we gotta move on because there's another service coming there's more people to talk to you some of y'all know what that's like but you don't have to be well to be cheerful you can feel bad and still be happy now brother Branham when you talk about Edith he said she was going through menopause he said in other words the changing of her life he said her nerves her in such tremendous condition the lady has got on her mind that she's dying she's just not going to live just from one hour to the other he said you know healthy strong women have a terrible time sometimes have to take shots of hormone and on institutions take shock treatments everything during that time but the way they treated things back then the human being has two changes of life they have to change from a boy to a man from a girl to a woman about 16 17 years old let me just dwell on that for a minute because I have a 16 year old sitting back there running the video happy that he's in the back right now I don't understand him he don't understand me and when I was a child when I was 16 my dad didn't understand me and I didn't understand him and his dad didn't understand that's just the way it is he didn't want to go to work the other day he'd been working some and he didn't want to go to work and so he he called he said he wasn't gonna go to work and that morning I got him up at 6 30 in the morning and we went for a run I haven't done that in years but we went we went to we both collapsed yes sometimes you just don't understand each other sound like a terrible father don't I he said about seeing 17 years old they get like a bunch of just fly by nights you just they don't know what they're going to do but we went through that too yeah all right he said and if you can just suffer with them during that age ain't that the truth if you can just suffer with them because they are suffering and they don't know why and they're not cheerful yeah they don't know why they're not cheerful but it's just you just suffer with them he said I got a daughter in that age right now Rebecca pray for her he said in Billy oh every one of us we come through that little frantic age and so we must suffer with them realizing it's something that they have to go through he said and now Edith with this changing of the seven years every seven years your life changes he said so the seven times seven you see it makes it kind of hard he said that's a complete change it bothers the women he said men usually get kind of a funny carrying on during that time and sometimes leave their wives he said but women are unfertile after that and he said we all go through that we must remember that it's things that we must bear with one another and understand those things so what she needed now was to be cheered up but what I want to get to is listen to what brother Brandon prescribes for Edith he said little Edith has gotten this condition and she's lost much weight and she looks bad and I tell you some night he said not all of you together but just a little trip down and I'll be honest with you I'm the worst at doing this some of you guys just remind me but you know what if you want if you need somebody to visit it's okay to ask I'm not going to look down on you because you asked you are not bothering me if you ask I'll be at your door if you ask I promise you that I'll be there if I can be at all but it don't hurt you to ask you say well you should anticipate it yes but sometimes human beings get busy right it's just what we do we got other things on our mind but it's okay to ask I I'd implore you to do that if you're sick if you're in need you're not bothering me give me a phone call let me know if you need help let me know what's going on so we can help so we can pray at least and but he said little you just got this condition and he said I'll tell you not all of you together but just a little trip down he said they set up with her day and night a little trip down there from this Tabernacle in the different Tabernacles the sister Tabernacles here when did we start only caring for the people in our church where did that come from these are brothers and sisters I got things on my mind right now people that I know relationships have been broken and different things it's on my mind constantly I want to make that right I want to help them in some way I want to see what I can do they don't go to my church they'll never help me in any way but I want to help them I don't want to help you most of all my first responsibility is here but wherever we can be a help let's be a help it's not all the pastor's job it's not all the deacons jobs it's us we're a body Let's help one another he said a little trip down there from this Tabernacle and the different Tabernacles the sister Tabernacles he said here some of you people go down and see the Wright family I'm sure they would appreciate it just go down set with them a little while talk to them shake their hand if no more than a little friendly visit he said we forget that so easy you know and when it comes to our own home then we appreciate it we must remember others appreciate it too and the right family I'm sure would appreciate that he said I know you would have done it if you'd know this condition existed but you didn't know it so therefore I was telling you this morning for it so if you don't know it you can't do anything about it but he said go visit the right family and try to cheer Edith up he said now don't tell her she looks bad you don't need them kind of visitors come on boy you look awful today just come to tell you that you know just be honest sometimes even a preacher you need somebody to visit it's got something good to say sometimes every time somebody shows up at the door oh it's a problem oh but see he said tell us don't tell her she looks bad tell her she looks good she's going to be fine sometimes we just need to hear that Peter you're gonna be okay different ones when you're going through some things you're gonna be all right you're gonna be okay tell her she looks good she's going to be fine say well I don't want to lie well just speak spiritually then everybody looks good to God yeah he said she is our sister he said well it should be all right if we just keep holding on for her yeah that's what we're here for you she is our sister and we're here to hold on in these times for that child we're not here just to be blessed not about just us he said well the preacher wasn't up to my my standards today so I'll just sit back and be a little critical of that maybe if you'd come to church with the right attitude and it got behind the preacher and and really really started saying amen and raising your hand in worship and maybe things would have been different it's a body move well the singer is not what I think you know what you ought to do get behind it get behind it complain about it especially if you're not the one responsible for changing it boy I got quiet in there we need to cheer one another up there's reasons we we do what we do she see here here Edith you just need to cheered up so that's what we're here for she's our sister we're here to hold on in these times for that child you got children we need to hold on for our children need to hold on for our family members I'll say this I may not be the most the best person to call when you need somebody to help maybe it'll be somebody else in the church and I want to be there for you that's my job to be there for you but there may be other people that are more skilled in some things than what I am that's okay this isn't a one-man operation it's not a dictatorship you don't need me to make it in the Rapture you need the word and God called me to preach the word but if I die of a heart attack tomorrow you'll get somebody else that preaches the word because you're the people of God are you with me now well if I could just have the pastor pray for me sometimes we just need to pray for one another see we we need to show Mercy he said he said we're here to hold on to these times and he said I want somebody to hold for me and pray while I was going through my trials you want somebody for yours Paul tells us to show Mercy with cheerfulness show Mercy with cheerfulness to go to be an attitude of cheerfulness ourselves so we can help somebody else who's not Mark Twain said the best way to cheer yourself up is to try to cheer somebody else up that is the truth see God cares about your attitude even when you give the Bible says God love is a cheerful Giver that's cheerful Giver I think of a title this the secret to cheerful listen I haven't gotten that to that yet but the secret to cheerfulness is to trust that he's alive yeah now this is what this is what Jesus is telling them he's saying in Mark in John 16 he says I'm going to go through some things and and we're going to have we're going to have a a real we're gonna you're gonna have a real tough time I'm going to leave you but be of good cheer yes what a time to tell him that you know sometimes we want we want people to commiserate in our suffering you need to weep for me you need to be there you need to he knew they would all leave him and he still cared about them more than he did about himself he said you're all going to leave me but be of good cheer go read it that's what he said we'll get to it if we have time look at look at Mary Magdalene what's the secret to being cheerful it's not to know your pastor it's not to have everything going right but the secret to being cheerful is to know that he's alive and that he is with you amen see many times our trust in the word gets shaken by events that happen in life and we would never maybe admit that but there's some tragedy happens in our life and our actual trust in the word gets shaken because and we don't even maybe recognize it but we're less optimistic we're less we're we're anticipate the Rapture last week because of things that have happened we're just we just don't want to buy in we're afraid to just buy in because if I did I would have to give up these little temporary happinesses that I that I've created for myself but our trust has been shaken look at Mary Magdalene when she goes to the tomb and she goes up look at her attitude and she goes she's crying she's weeping she's been shaken by the events of the week but when she finds it and he speaks to her and she identifies himself as who he is what does she do she runs back and says he's not here he's risen from the dead she runs back she was the first one to carry the gospel of the good news of the resurrection of Jesus Christ look you aren't cheerful many times we're not cheerful because we we don't recognize in the way that we should his presence with us he's there when you're going through the battle he's there during the change of your life he's there when you're a teenager he's there when you're in church he's there when you're on the job he's there when you're at home he's there when you make mistakes he said I'll never leave you never means never it's not never with a clause not never with an out not never with fine print but he said now I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you after his resurrection you still with me this morning just got a few more minutes but the Joel will preached to us tonight looking forward to hearing that after his resurrection Jesus were near cleopas and his friend they were walking home we've told the story many times but Jesus walks up to them he says why are you so sad why are you so sad but what what manner of communications are these as you walk in her sad they thought he left their trust in the resurrection and the presence of Christ have been shaken listen to me Church oh God you realize what God did for us in this age he showed himself in the form of the son of man why did he do that why did he come in the son of man Ministry to show us a resurrection sign he says I'm alive so you can be cheerful are you with me now so I can be cheerful he says I'm alive I'm with you why are you so sad oh my God is there are you a stranger around here look look all that's happened they explained to him I'm skipping down here they explained to him all that had happened but look at verse 21 but we trusted we trusted past tense that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel and beside all this today is the third day since these things were done and the fact is that was the very day they should have been looking for it but it didn't happen the way they thought it would happen they said oh there's some people went down that the tomb was empty but we don't know what that means somebody probably stole him away yeah yeah I'll say this events signs without Revelation don't mean much the picture of the pillar of fire without a revelation of what it means doesn't mean much the picture of the cloud without a revelation of what it means doesn't mean much the open Tomb the empty tomb without a revelation of his presence didn't mean much their trust had been broken oh my he said unto them o fools and so of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken and he began to he began to expound to them all through the prophet's hell that he was supposed to come and then he showed the sign of the Resurrection something he did before he was alive before he died to show that he was still living you see knowledge of his resurrection did not make them cheerful only when he revealed himself to them personally in the word and walk back to Jerusalem that night was way easier than the walk down to Emmaus had been Hallelujah sometimes the walk when we're walking we're hearing the word it's hard you're struggling in church even your kids are making noise or you're sitting there with a headache or you've got problems going on and the walk down is hard but if you can ever get the Revelation he's with you he's here then it changes things [Applause] verse 1 of John 16. Jesus Is Telling Me said I'm going to leave you yeah they said I'm speaking these things to you you should not be offended so they're going to persecute you they're going to put you out of the synagogues whoever kills you will think he does God of service these things they'll do it to you because they've not known the father nor me but these things have I told you when the time shall come you may remember that I told you of them and he said let them say this things at the beginning because I was with you but now I go my way to him that sent me and none of you asked me whether go a cell but because I've said these things unto you notice sorrow hath filled your heart nevertheless I tell you the truth it is okay foreign foreign [Music] behind their tears there would have been a cheerful to stare foreign [Applause] that he was doing that to forgive them of their sins if they'd have known that from this moment on his Spirit would come back and live with them if they'd have known that they would have been way more cheerful than what they were but they all ran away because they had sorrow in their hearts they didn't know the outcome but you know the outcome today you know why he went to the Cross you know why he went to the Grave you know why this message had to be persecuted you know why the denominations had to reject it there's an incoming if you can just see Pastor you'd be cheerful today we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye [Applause] good Hallelujah he says I got a lot of things to tell you if you can't bear them now but when the spirit of truth comes he will guide you into all truth oh my that a way different attitude at Pentecost than what they had in the garden verse 16 says a little while you won't see me again a little while you'll see me because I go to the father and they didn't understand they said what's going on what is this that he says we can't tell what he's saying and Jesus knew they wanted to ask him about it and said to them do you inquire among yourselves what I said a little while you should not see me again a little while you shall see me verily verily I say unto you you shall weep and Lament but the world shall rejoice oh God Rejoice because he was hung to a cross Rejoice because they'd done away with him you should be sorrowful but your sorrow shall be turned into Joy what's gonna do it when they had got the revelation that he was alive this is going to be done for a moment and hear who can turn on the light I can't promise you that everything's going to be easy look at job he went through the hardest trial maybe that a man could go through lost all of his children lost his wife lost everything his his friends were all accused him of secret sin and he's sitting there on an ass sheep scraping his boils but what does God do for him God never does explain to him why he went through what he went through he never does tell him why what does he do he said he caused him to have a revelation and see a vision I know my redeemer lives at the last day he'll stand on the earth though the skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh I shall see God he gave him a revelation of the Resurrection it's going to be dark for a minute there's a man here who can turn on the light he said a woman when she's in travail has sorrow because her hour has come but as soon as she is delivered to the child she remembers no more the anguish for joy that a man is Born Into the world and you now therefore have sorrow but I will see you again your heart shall rejoice your joy no man taketh from you and in that day you shall ask me nothing now what he's saying is you're not going to ask me you're going to ask the father in my name oh my in my name he said whatever you ask the father in my name he will give it to you see Jesus came in the father's name when we ask in the name of Jesus we're asking in the father's name well he said whatever you asking the father in my name he will give it to you hitherto have you asked nothing in my name ask and you shall receive that your joy might be full right and they said oh we understand now we got it all right we're going to be happy now he said do you believe now behold the hour comes yes now come that you should be scattered every man to his own and shall leave me alone yet I'm not alone because the father is with me can you imagine if he'd been Petty like some of us are they left me in my hour of need can't deal with them again he loved them more than anybody he just knew the limits of humanity that's right oh God it's good he recognized that they were human beings they couldn't handle it who am I but these things have I spoken unto you these things is that in me you might have peace in the world you shall have tribulation but be of good cheer I have overcome the world how could he die brother said while it was going along the road they were so discouraged Peter got his fishing pole put it on his back in a can of worms and started down to the Sea and said I just guess I'll go fishing cleopas and his friend said come on let's go on back to Jerusalem go back to our city where we come from to Emmaus I don't know I can't make it how could a person like that said today God's servants has misunderstood the same way he said the true gospel is misunderstood the same way even his disciples didn't understand him he talked to double talk they never could understand him because he talked to Heaven he talked to things they couldn't understand people still they don't understand what a prophet spoke because sometimes he was speaking as a prophet and they couldn't understand that's what brother Brandon means if I double talks it sometimes it was the man speaking sometimes it was God he said right at the last they said Lo now we believe and know that no man has to teach you for God shows you what to do and Jesus said do you now believe after all this time do you now believe but how could that Divine person see they'd failed to know the word of God so there was nothing to do but fulfill their desire to know I love that how can he make them cheerful yeah oh God he had to fulfill their desire to know it ought to make us happy when we come to the house of God because we have a desire to know is he still alive is he still the same yesterday today and forever and when we come together we are the proof of his resurrection and we look around at one another and we say yes sir sister Jackie she'd been through some things but she's a proof of his resurrection there's this mother Stewart she's been through some things but she's he's a proof of his resurrection what is it by coming together don't you see why hate and hates the Assembly of the Saints we're not just celebrating the resurrection of Christ we are the proof of the resurrection of Christ Hallelujah we are the proof of his resurrection we didn't drag ourselves to church we're here because God is inside of us he's living himself out through us we are the proof of his resurrection so when we come to the house of God he fulfills our desire to know Hallelujah Hallelujah he said they turned down the road walking along disheartened oh some women had been up to the Grave they said he wasn't there but they didn't believe that so they just went on down the road so discouraged and if you notice he said it's when you're discouraged that's when the devil can really pour it on you that's what he gets you if you come to the church and say well I don't know I don't know whether I'll get any better or not I've been prayed for twice so my you might as well go home that's all but when you can cast that aside God don't want you to be frowning God wants you to be happy the human heart was made to be happy worry will cause cancer temper will cause cancer don't never be upset just walk in his love knowing that you're walking in him and nothing can harm you there's nothing going to harm you there's neither Powers things present things future hey man we're in him nothing can separate us from him we're in him and we can never come in by our own will he by choice elected us and brought us into him so it's his business to take care of what he took himself no man conflict him from my father's hands because he's the greatest of all of them it's the father who takes care of it who's got any more power than God he said so what kind of a power have you got over you to take care of you what's watching over you today church it's the eagle who can fly higher than any other bird who can come faster to your hour of need than any other any other animal you know any other power of the air what kind of a power have you got over you to take care of you the whole power that created the universe took the solar system and blew like that every Star went to its place and he watches over you it's a kind of a father that we have I won't read all that I've got here because it's just a little bit in second Timothy you can go read it it's verses three second Timothy chapter one verses three through ten verses 3 through 12 actually but he tells Timothy he says Timothy tended to be a little timid a little fearful lived under that cloud he said I I want you to stir up the gift of God to sing you God's not given us a spirit of fear but a power and of love and of a sound mind he said don't be ashamed of the testimony yeah yeah don't be ashamed it was hard in that day your best friends in prison the prophet you follow is in prison we get embarrassed sometimes because the prophet we follow gets gets degraded online people laugh and make fun and mock their prophet of that age was in prison yeah didn't even have two coats to wear he said but be a partaker of the afflictions don't be ashamed and that word ashamed is interesting it means to not be cheerful the opposite is cheerfulness oh my God don't be ashamed don't don't be Melancholy because I'm in jail don't be ashamed of me oh my he said he said I'd be a partaker of the Gospel he says because he saved us according to his own purpose and Grace he said and I'm appointed a preacher for that reason and verse 12 said for the witch cause I also suffer these things nevertheless I am not ashamed you go look at the root word in the Greek it's I am not unhappy I am not saddened I am not melancholy even though I'm in prison I'm not ashamed for I know whom I have believe in and I'm persuaded that he's able to keep what I've committed unto him against that day commit your way into the Lord trust in him he'll bring you out I found in the meetings that we had in Togo and I've always marveled at this I thought there was nothing you could do to make them less cheerful I've seen them pile up in buses and and wearing clothes that maybe we wouldn't wear it and eating food that we definitely wouldn't eat not have any restroom facilities and the people are happy you can tell they're happy you can you can see it in the audience they're happy because they smile they're happy most of their songs are joyful songs Happy songs and I'm so amazed by that always it just overwhelms me and and it makes me realize that it's not what you have that makes you happy it's not what you're going through that makes you happy or that makes you cheerful have that constant feeling of everything's okay it's not what you're going through but I found there was something that would dampen their Spirits a little bit you know what it is not being able to go to church Fritz got her hand up back there she knows a little bit what that's like yeah we need to pray for our elders yeah they're not always able to be here that's what made Iran happy made him unhappy is just the ability the lack of an ability yeah to go to church and when I went covet had been so strong in that country actually the disease hadn't been strong the fear of it yeah was so strong they wouldn't let them come together right and the government used that to come against them and the people were when I first started preaching to them they were not like they usually were but after a couple Services it began to break and the spirit of God began to move again and things began to be different and I noticed I told the young man that was with me I said it was different I told Brother John it was different he said well we haven't been able to meet together like this and the people are still afraid that the government will come in and beat them for coming together but when they realized they were going to be able to worship together all of a sudden the joy come out it just come out and they begin to shout and dance and worship and I began to realize it's not what you have it's being able to gather together and with the other members of the body and the resurrection that that brings in your heart yeah he's alive it proves to you he's alive I know some of you aren't always able to come but I'll say this you're with us in spirit you still know because there is a church on the earth this church we're not going to close where I refuse to close down and bow to an Orthodoxy that says you can't have church no more and it doesn't matter anymore I say we need to keep the church doors open because we're proving the devil wrong every time we come to the house of God and even those of you have to be at home and they're sick or whatever you know that until a church operating somewhere there's a body of Believers meeting he is alive the one thing that's been constant from the very beginning of the church was the people Gathering Together proving his resurrection how should we get a musicians go ahead and come brother Branham this really struck me at the end of the door inside the door he's preaching a hard sermon to him he said we offer to you the Adoration of our heart we praise thee with all that's in US we lift our hearts we lift our hands we lift our voice we lift all that we are Lord into thy presence receive us O Lord we consecrate ourselves in hell to thee take this great ransomed Church of the Living God sanctify it father fill it with the Holy Spirit May the spirit of God sweep over this building now I love the way he put this drunken the people oh God drunken the people yes give them the joy of the Lord yes that they'll be filled with the Holy Ghost like they were on the day of Pentecost that from this hour on they'll go forth the power of God to every church and to every person that they may be filled with the goodness of God that the power of God might operate through everybody Every Soul that people ask he said May the people be on the streets tomorrow testifying glorifying God men and women at their work giving praises to God the Hours come Lord he said we're looking for your coming at any moment let us not stand with shamed faces oh God let us be filled with thy goodness and thy spirit granted Lord as we offer you our art in prayer oh would that be our desire today oh let's bow our heads together let's just lift our hands to him with our heads bowed let's just talk to him for a moment oh Heavenly Father oh how we love you today we thank you for your

you'd move in a mighty way Speak Lord speak as only you can spoken through word Lord now speak in your spirit or that inner voice that voice of predestination that tells us that the word is true I pray you'd speak now Lord Lord and move and our midst let us rejoice and be happy Lord over what you've done for us asking asking you hey amen amen don't you love him today oh let's sing it like we
