that he said here he got it all over it got all sticky he said and then when he went over to his where his mama was she didn't come to the meeting so if someone didn't come to the meeting and you get

good in our soul that we return again tonight to begin another of those old-fashioned revivals where Sinners call out for mercy where the backslider makes things right with God again don't you want to see that the and the Holy Spirit is the main person in the meeting that's what we want isn't it the holy spirit is the main person in the meeting who takes hold and rules and brings to us the bread of life through the word he says and we pray that he'll minister to us night after night in this revival heal the sick and the needy sanctify every believer and get Glory out of these efforts that we put forth There It Is God bless you I I that's my prayer could you stand with me tonight and we'll go right into the meeting you just pull on the word of the Lord and I'm sure God's got something for you

Amen I in reminder the Bible it says our God has ears that he can hear he has a voice that he can speak he has eyes that he can see amen and the greatest thing about it is he's not an impersonal God but he's a personal God and amen I know he's the god of Abraham the god of Isaac the god of Jacob he's the God of all the Patriarchs in the Bible but I believe he's ever one of ours tonight I believe

of God that's here tonight God bless you all in your Ministries and I know we've not come here tonight to be seen or to be heard but we've come here to worship Him Amen in the power of his resurrection and I I believe he's here tonight to do exactly what his word said he would do don't you amen just before we open the word let's just borrow hearts together tonight for a word of prayer and let's just ask him to come how many would have a special need up on your heart something you would desire the Lord to do for you amen I believe he's here to do that tonight maybe you just turn lay your hands on someone next to you brother to brother sister to sister husband to wife and godly order and let's just join our faith together tonight as Believers and let's invite him to come and you just help me pray here tonight Heavenly Father Lord as we come into these meetings here on this Thursday afternoon Lord we realize that we're not here alone tonight dear God but Lord there is a building full of angels there's a supernatural host that has come into this building tonight to do exceedingly and abundantly Lord above anything that we can ask or think Lord your Prophet has taught us that we're not here Lord by accident but Lord there was an angel that medicine led us to the seat that you would have us to sit in tonight and Lord I know these things or it may look impossible situations sicknesses and bodies but Lord in this atmosphere all things are possible so Lord tonight I on the first night of this meeting we lay our hands upon one another as a sign of unity as a sign of Brotherhood Lord and father we rebuke every enemy out of hell that will try to hinder these meetings it will try to hinder the supernatural I pray oh God that you would send the angel of God or to come into this building tonight dear God and drive out every enemy Lord and father May there come a Unity May there come a power oh God lord the loss could be saved the empty could be filled Lord this sick could be healed Lord I know that day on Calvary you defeated every disease you defeated every sin so tonight Lord we're laying our lives at the altar of your word and we're asking you send the fire of God to come in these meetings this week Lord anoint our brothers Lord as they're laboring before you to find the mind of God for these Services I pray Lord that that consuming fire would consume every one of them Lord that they would stand here o God and Minister the things that would be edifying to your body now Lord we pray a special blessing upon our brother being upon this Assembly of God father may you and anoint him Lord may you give him Lord the desires of their heart for what they've put forth for these meetings for every church here that's represented I pray oh God you would bless them in a supernatural way and we'll be sure to give thee all the praise all the honor and all the glory for it to do that wonderful name in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we pray and all the believer says a man and amen God bless you this evening if you have your Bibles we want to turn to the Book of Psalms the 34th chapter The Book of Psalms the 34th chapter we're going to look there and also in the Book of Mark the 10th chapter in Psalms 34 and verse 6 I'm just going to read one verse um it would just open our thoughts here for this evening in Psalms 34 and verse number six you love the Lord tonight amen David here says this poor man cried and the Lord heard him and saved him out of all of his troubles amen this poor man cried and the Lord heard him and saved him out of all of his troubles in The Book of Mark the 10th chapter in the 46th verse I want to read a portion of scripture there I know that you all know these verses by heart it's the story of blind Bartimaeus sitting at a powerful testimony in Bon Bartimaeus life amen in Mark 10 in verse number 46 the Bible here says and they came to Jericho as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people blind Bartimaeus the son of Timaeus Sat by the highway side begging and when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth he began to cry out and say Jesus thou son of David have mercy on me and many charged him that he should hold his peace but he cried the more a great deal saying thou son of David have mercy on me now brother Bram says it like this on this next verse Jesus Stood Still brother Brahm said his faith stopped Jesus in his tracks and he commanded him to be called and they called the blind man sent unto him be of good Comfort rise he calleth thee and he casting away His Garment Rose and came to Jesus and Jesus answered and said unto him what will the thy should do unto thee and the blind man said unto him Lord that I might receive my sight and Jesus said unto him go thy way thy faith hath made the whole and immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus in the way amen we ask the Lord this evening to add the blessings the reading of his word as you can have your seats here this afternoon amen we thank the Lord for the reading of the word of God Amen and from those passages of scripture tonight if the Lord would help me for just a few moments I want to speak to you here on a thought and if I would title this tonight I want to speak to you on the power of your pull the power of your pool now uh maybe to take a context out of that I would like to say this amen that you operate the gift amen the power of your pool but you operate the gift now when you look at this word pool Webster says it means to exert force on someone or something so as to cause movement towards oneself it is an act of taking a hold of something and exerting Force to draw it towards one so amen when you're pulling on something it's not something casual it's not something amen that you just do out of out of habit or but it's actually you're putting forth an effort to get a hold of something you're putting forth an effort he meant to pull on something it is a force a man that is drawing on someone or something amen into a particular direction or course of action I believe tonight amen that our God is a god of action I don't believe he's a god a man that works on feelings he don't work on emotions he don't work on sensation amen but he works upon the basis of his word and the prophet God said as a Believer we're not in the where we are in the hand of God right amen then the prophet says every True Believer is in the hand of God and they can draw from his love and his power Amen to receive the full benefit of all that God is to the believer amen what God gives the messenger and How He blesses and uses the messenger is an example to all believers amen of his goodness and care to all amen the members of his body amen than what he was to Paul is what he is to every believer what he wants to Columbus is what he is to every believer what he was to William Branham amen is what he is to every believer of this end time word amen because it's not be eyes and little U's and this and that amen but it's on the basis of the word of God that he said I'll never leave thee I'll never forget take me but I'll be with me even in thee until the end of the world that we're not coming to these meetings to draw from the Flesh of a Preacher we're not coming to draw from the personality of a Preacher amen but we are here tonight to draw amen from the love of God from the goodness of God from the mercy of God from the grace of God they said whatever is in God is in his word amen because he is his word and he's the same yesterday today and forever if you need healing you're not going to draw it from the Flesh of Andrew Glover you're not going to draw it from the Flesh of brother Dale or brother Wendell amen but if you'll start pulling on the word amen then the god of action will come into the building as the supernatural God that he is and he will manifest himself in every Divine promise that his word said he would do now when you start thinking about drawing from God Amen whatever we draw from God Amen is coming from an unseen resource amen but it's coming through Christ amen whatever we draw from God is coming from The Unseen amen but we're drawing it through the channel amen of the spirit of God then the prophet would tell you everything that is real amen is unseen he would say go buy me some love you can't do it can you it'd say go buy me some peace she can't do it amen because the things that are seen amen are temporary but the things that are not seen are Eternal and we are not the children amen of a sin God Amen of Science and education amen but we are the sons and daughters of Jehovah and he is an unseen God but he has sent a message in this hour and the invisible God has been convincible into this generation amen not by our feelings not by our music amen but by the preaching of the unsearchable riches of Jesus Christ the son of God has come into the building and you know he's here because your faith declares he's here whether you feel him or not your faith declares him whether your body testifies of it I know some of y'all sitting here tonight and you're sick in your body amen your body is not declared he's here amen I know some of you are here and you're low in your spirit but your spirit is not declaring he's here amen but you're here because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the feeling that he that is in the senses of the human amen our God is an unseen God and he's known by faith he's known by the super sense amen whenever Jesus Come into town amen it was hard on his body amen he was tired his body was wore out brother remember said you know as he went along amen the people drew God out of him amen the people drew God right out of him he said see what they done was they drew their desires from him was Jesus brother Tim was on the earth they were pulling on him and then they were drawing on him and what they were doing is they were drawing their desires amen out of him listen there's only one God who can meet your expectation there's only one God who can meet the desire of your heart and his name is Jesus Christ and he's here tonight in the power of his resurrection to do exactly what his word said he would do yes sir he is here and my faith declares he's here brother Josh my feelings don't but my face to us and if my faith declares him then greater is my faith in my soul than the feeling in my body greater is the faith in my soul than the feeling in my body amen come on Church greater is the faith in your soul I know some of y'all shouldn't be sitting here tonight amen but you're here and then you should have been gone a long time ago amen but you're sitting here tonight do you know why you're sitting here as a testimony amen that there's nothing the devil could do Amen to conquer the faith of God that has been restored to the message of Malachi 4. yes sir amen when I think about God come in the building I heard the prophet say today he said when the supernatural comes in he said the supernatural will change amen the course of the meeting I don't know what y'all want but I'll tell you what I want amen is I want the supernatural Amen to come in this building so strong that you cannot see me you cannot hear me only thing you can see amen is to fail that's the Mighty God is chosen in this hour to unfold himself through yes sir that word that power hour amen is real and you're drawing from it you're not drawn from your favorite preacher you're not drawn from the personality of a man you're drawing from the word now I got to thinking about this the power of your pull and just a simple illustration I I got to thinking about one time as a kid my grandfather he took me over to a sawmill and we went over there and there was a piece of a log we took over there but the man and they laid that log out on the table and the guy said he ever he told me he said young man you ever seen a law cut I said well I've seen it with a chainsaw he said have you ever seen a log song cut along and I said no ain't never seen that he said well you're fisting too and he laid that log down took a saw and he laid it across the top of that log and he got on one side and another guy got on the other side and what this guy done was he pushed that saw amen and there was a guy pulling that saw and then the other guy would push it back and then he would push it back and before long the other guy on the other hand he got up and walked away and did something different and a few minutes that guy was pushing then he was running around there and pushing it back amen what happened amen with two it was getting done amen but with one it was taking more time it was taken more effort it was taken more ability amen but when the two were working together they meant to accomplish the natural task hey then then there was a power amen when two was working together the prophet of God said that revivals only come amen by the Holy Ghost he said he's the one who brings the Revival we cannot do it we can only make the effort amen and God has to bless the effort and I trust that he will amen so there's one up here tonight preaching and there's a whole church out there pulling amen but let me tell you that's not enough they've been to get the spiritual past done we can preach to life we can preach till our tonsils fall out and you can pull to your physically wore out amen but unless the Holy Ghost amen will come down upon the effort and he will move upon the face of the people then it's just another mean I'm just another preacher but if the spirit of God Amen we're coming to the building he will heal every sickness he will forgive every sin he will deliver every captive he will move by the power of the Holy Ghost because he's God you know what we're gonna do we're gonna preach and you're going to pull and God's Gonna bless I said somebody gonna preach and somebody's gonna pull and the Holy Ghost is gonna bless because we can put forth the effort but it's going to take him to bring the results see what happens he is amen is you've got to get your spirit in condition to work with the atmosphere you've got to get your spirit in condition to receive the word and not resent the word the prophet said if you've got a resenting audience then the Holy Spirit won't even reveal he said no you gotta have something that is working together he said they were in one place one Accord and then there came a sound from Heaven as a Russian Mighty Wind see no matter how much I pray and lay their day and night studying and praying before the Lord and I would walk down there maybe the anointed on me I would walk up here and feel that resentment see it just screams him right away he will not reveal nothing but when you walk down here and you're under the anointing and you feel your audience under the anointing then that's when the Holy Spirit begins to work and he begins to move and he begins to do great things for us I'm on church if he's not here nothing's going to get done that's an old song we used to sing if God don't do it it ain't gonna get done and that's real here tonight if God don't do the healing and ain't gonna get done if God don't do the saving it ain't gonna get done if God don't do the revealing and ain't gonna get done but I be clear to you tonight that he is here and he's hearing the power of his resurrection to do exactly what he promised you he would do when two or three would gather together in my name he said there I will be in their midst then your faith with my faith and the blessing of the Holy Spirit upon that faith will literally operate the work of God see he's already given us the blessings it's a finished work amen we're not working on it we're not adding to it it's already finished so what does he do he sends his spirit amen and we operate the work of God by the energy of the Holy Spirit now that word operates a powerful word it means to control amen the functioning of something so if you're operating something you're controlling the way it works you're controlling the you're controlling the benefit or you're unlocking things in it and the prophet of God 1951 he introduces the term amen the operation of the Holy Spirit he said the Holy Spirit that was up on the church at Pentecost has come right down to the age has come right on down to the age to the Luther of the Baptist the Methodist and right on down amen into this age here now come on let's go ahead and say what a prophet said he said there's been seven Gentile successive churches amen but in the end time there was to come the Capstone Ministry which would be the stone amen that the builders rejected it would be the headstone it would be the Capstone and the prophet of God said it would be a triumphal entry of that Capstone and it would be for the perfecting of the Bride has it dawned on you Church we're not at the bottom of the pyramid we're not way halfway up to Pyramid amen but we've climbed to Luther we've climbed too Wesley we've climbed two Pentecost and we have spent amen into the Perfection of the word itself listen friends amen this is our age and a prophet said there will be a bright age well here we are so we might as well enjoy it amen there's a bright age with a bright anointing with the bright lights it's bright time if there's ever been a time for the bride to enjoy the benefits that she's pulling from an unseen resource Now's the Time to enjoy it if there's ever been a time Amen to break out of all the religious ideas and problems and situations and pull now's the time to do it because he's the same Holy Spirit he said when people's Faith amen will get up into a place they'll get the blessings to realize it's theirs then the same operation of the holy spirit will be operating in the church like it did back there it will be just the same other places said may we commit ourselves to God for the operation of the Holy Spirit another place he says God in his Mercy through the operation of the Holy Spirit he reveals spiritual truth the word itself amen so the the spiritual Revelation can only come into your life by the operation of the Holy Ghost now you know what that is that's Isaiah 7 when he said behold a virgin shall conceive and she shall bring forth a son prompt of God said what was that that was a super sign it was God the word amen manifested in flesh he said in May Our Lives be so fitted with word that the word will become flesh Among Us and will give the people Faith Amen to draw from their account in heaven well glory to God May the word come Among Us in such a powerful way brother man that it will raise the people's Faith to a level that you will draw from your account in heaven listen friends if you're waiting on somebody Amen to deposit the funds in your bank account then there's a waiting period and you cannot draw no benefits but if the funds are already in there well I feel like preaching if the funds are already in there then you don't have to wait amen come on Church you don't have to wait till somebody to process the check you don't have to wait till somebody deposits the money if the funds are in there and you come to acknowledge that there's enough money in the bank to cover the purchase then you're not going to be reserved you're going to draw from the benefits of your bank account well that's an Earthly bank account but what about the Heavenly bank account whether there's unlimited funds if you need Joy it's in your account if you need healing it's in your account if you need a breakthrough it's in your account if you need the Holy Ghost it's already in your account we just gotta break out of this Earthbound chatter chatter chatter and step into a realm with god with the Unseen God becomes the Unseen visible guest Among Us him well I feel like preaching here tonight I'm talking about somebody that's not going to sit back and let the devil hands you a rain check and say come back tomorrow night and come back Saturday morning and come back oh no we gonna get it tonight we gonna get it tonight we're gonna get our healing tonight we're going to get our answer tonight we're going to get our Miracle tonight we ain't gotta wait it's already in the account [Applause] well I feel like shouting on Mountain amen when the word recognizes you when you recognize the word Jesus said it'll be account a long time ago the funds are already in there now what is happening then is in these Services you're calling out you're calling out for a withdrawal from the account you know if there's no deposit then there's no withdrawal right no deposit no withdrawal no money no purchase but that day on Calvary he settled everything and deposited into every single one of your accounts the only thing it's gonna take to get it out of your account and get it into your body is the pool of faith when your faith gets up to a level to believe God for the promise you will literally draw amen that deposit into your account into your flesh well God have mercy amen amen God in his Mercy before the little babies born what's he doing is craving for some vitamin and the mother's word speaks forth and says Dad I want a cantaloupe or I want a watermelon I want something another he'll never he'll do everything he can because he wants his child to be born as perfect as he can be he said now that's a natural father he said but what about your spiritual father he's more ablor to get it see he's a Creator now think how able he is Amen to prepare us a body to live like his own glorious body if we want to live now listen at these words there is something in us there is something in us that is calling to live and there is something in us that is calling us to do rights then watch God will call somebody on the platform or the poop head he says that will preach the absolute truth why see it shows that if you're a real child of God you begin to cry out God taken away from me circumcised me from this sea take these things away from me why are you crying that out because it's needed for your heavenly home see if you can see that you've got to be a real wordbride of Christ the only thing that will inhabit Heaven is the word that's why the prophet said that heaven consists of the word come on Church Heaven consists of the word see then we're living in the time when we shouldn't be immature we should be mature we're living in the time we're maturity should be the fruit on the vine it should be the fruit in our lives come on Amen we're not about your immature babies we're Sons and Daughters of God that have been manifested by the by the word of God and the age we're living in listen we're living in the time amen when the spirits are coming to a head those two Spirits from Genesis amen are coming to maturity he said see that first is the true Spirit and the second is the false spirit amen now watch this the idea then has been introduced if we're if we're if we're moving along if that's okay the idea has been introduced amen that there is a true and a false faithful Ministry now I'll go so far with you on that that there's a lot of preachers ain't got no business in the Pulpit I'll go that far with you amen but don't you let a hypocrite amen squash the ability of God Amen to save a man and fill him with the Holy Ghost and use him for his honor and Glory I know there's been a lot of Hypocrites and there's going to be a lot more amen but turn your eyes off of the falls and Look Away to Jesus one time and watch God come on church I'll just say this if God can use Andrew Clover he can use anybody sitting here tonight I was as lost as lost could be I was as undone as undone could be but God who is rich in Mercy amen came on the scene because there was something in my soul that was calling out for a deposit from my heavenly bank account [Applause] amen now where the Devil comes in is he comes in and attempts to identify amen a true faithful Ministry and a false faithful Ministry but let's not take what I think you think or anybody else thinks let's take what a prophet said and the prophet of God will show you that the identifying characteristic of a true Ministry is second Timothy the fourth chapter amen preach the word preach the word that's the only thing that belongs in a puppy it is the word foreign myself but it's the truth anyhow your feelings and opinions do not belong in the Pulpit my ideas are the way I think things ought to be does not belong in the puppy the only thing that belongs in the puppet is the safest seventh angel because it's the truth it's been Vindicated by God the whole church it was Vindicated in the heavens it's been Vindicated on the earth and now it's being Vindicated In the Flesh of the Bride of Jesus Christ and there ain't enough devils in hell to stop it the word will prevail this word will prevail it'll Prevail over your feelings it'll Prevail over our ideas preach the word it says you'll be instant in season out of season you reprove you rebuke you exhorts with all long-suffering and Doctrine that's what the prophet said in your soul is calling out for it's calling out for the absolute truth and the only thing that's the absolute truth is the word see then the true faithful ministry will stand behind the pulpit and they will preach the absolute truth they will not take them put a pair of gloves on when they see makeup come in the church they will not put a pair of gloves on when they see short skirts and well we might as well preach it it's revival time they're not going to back up and take a back seat because half the church got televisions they're going to stand with a word and they're going to rebuke him Spirits because there's a bride that's got to be birthed out of this confusion and step into the promises of God [Applause] come on Church somebody's going to Manifest this message some young girl is going to live clean some young boy is going to live above reproach why not you why not now why not this generation I'll tell you what we've done we put these things so far in the future we can't even see him no more but I wouldn't have gone somebody cannot would get up and put your walking shoes on and go get it out of the future and bring it into the present that's not an invincible Army coming she's here that's not an overcomer coming he's here there's not a real word round of cash coming she is here tonight [Applause] now the prophet of God said it very plain he said what Jesus said if you continue in what my word then are you my disciples indeed and ye shall know the truth somebody say the truth ye shall know the truth if there's something calling out in your soul for it brother Vernon there's somebody God's going to send the pulpit to preach it come on church if there's something in your soul tonight crying out for something if God has become old now if God's big enough to hang the moon and the stars to create the galaxies then don't tell me he's not big enough to come into the middle of a meeting and take a two before preacher in his hand and take him off of his notes and take him out of his Direction and lead him right down your Avenue because there's a word concerning you there's a body change concerning you there's our apps are concerning you and brother M says this he said now you shall know the truth the truth shall make you free he says what is the truth what is the truth we asked that to lay out a sin today we get a lot of answers wouldn't we buddy what is the truth I'll tell you what a prophet said he said Thy word is the truth we've just settled what is truth the word is the truth I'm gonna preach you for a second because I'm going to say what a prophet said he said I do not come as a fanatic I do not believe in fanaticism I will not stand for it I know you don't believe in it either you believe in the truth and the truth will always speak for itself that ought to make your picture shout and choose home right there the truth will always speak for itself that's right you never have to strain truth truth will always be truth [Applause] you never have to put a strainer on the truth so you can filter things out it's really not a part of it if it is the truth it was the truth in the alpha it'll be the truth of the Omega if it was the truth in Genesis it'll be the truth in Revelation if it was the truth in 47 it'll be the truth in 65. if it is the truth in heaven it'll be the truth on the earth somebody's gonna manifest the truth I'm not crazy I'm not beside myself I'm a free man I've been freed by the truth and the truth will make you free oh yeah it's like well brother Andrew I don't know well I know what a prophet said he said tell the truth the first time you can tell it the same every time [Applause] I know we got about your Chimney Corner Store he's been hatched out and been held over people for 50 years but if it's not in the Bible and it's not in the message then you are not subject to Bow your need I know we've had a lot of doctors around us that said they knew the truth on the Deep things of the message and all they knew was enough to bind the people of God and put him into prisons and put him into concentration camps but this is the hour of Jubilee this is the hour of Liberty where the word of God will come into a church and it'll free the Believers yes sir now brother said here it is I don't want to hurt you I don't I don't want to shake you or jerk for hide from you but I wish to preach the truth that's one thing about it brother amen the truth will make you it'll never make you popular but the truth will make you honest [Applause] brother Bo the truth will never make you popular but the truth will make you honest and he said that's one good thing about it and you'd rather be honest and be popular I don't know about y'all but I ain't got nothing to lose cause I ain't nobody somebody said well he's something big have you forgot who you're talking about you're talking about a boy on the back side of the hills of East Tennessee that God called me and Sanctified me and fill me with the Holy Ghost and anything I have today is to the glory of God you know what we need to do we need to lose the fear of taking a stand for truth because of some spirit we've done we've got so powered down we can't even take a stand no more I remember I tell you where it come from it came from Ahab it did not come from Elijah because Elijah was a son of Truth and this bride is following the Elijah Malachi 4 and she is a church of Truth she will only respond to the truth [Applause] she will only respond to the truth that's why you get upset preaching ideas and you shut the church down but you start saying what a prophet said and a fire comes in and an anointing comes in and a Revival breaks out because we're Eagles and we gotta have the truth [Applause] I say give me the truth or don't give me nothing I'd rather be honest than be popular I'd rather be honest what about it young people would you rather be honest than popular yeah sometimes to live this message you got to be unpopular your word born child and you're a part of the Bride you will forfeit your rights as a lamb to be led by the dove now you say preacher you're getting pretty strong in this area I am because I happen to be living at the same time you are and it's the time when the spirit of Truth has come that's why we cannot rely Allen respond to just anything the only thing we can respond to is truth because Jesus said how be it when he the spirit of Truth has come he will guide you into all truth he will not speak of himself well we might as well preach here for a second a true Holy Ghost filled preacher ain't gonna get up and take two hours to tell you how great he is man I'm here I'm also preach I told somebody today I said you know we got some preachers testify and when they get done testifying brother Danny I wonder if God was even in the building but come on now cause it's all about them and their Ministry and their but let me remind you tonight this ain't about me and it ain't about you it ain't about for the window brother Daryl brother Penn any of these preachers here tonight it's about Jesus Christ it's about entertaining the spirit of truth that has come into this generation Amen to release us from the prison house to release us from the bondage of sin when he the spirit of Truth has come he will guide you into all truth he shall not speak of himself whatsoever thinks he shall hear that shall he speak notice this and he will show you things to come he rather rather Madeline he will show you things to come in other words that word come is of persons who come from one place to another in other words it's used both of the persons arriving at the same place so if you say Amen brother Andrew is going to pick me up and he's going to take me down to McDonald's well if I was at McDonald's I was in your future so I left your future come into your presence and I've picked you up and I transported you oh God I transported you from your present to your future don't you see what this message is it's your future it's not your past and it's not even your present it's your future when he the spirit of Truth has come he will have come from your future into your present thank you and he will show you the things it is to come watch this he will come forth he will show himself he will find a place or influence then we have just identified the source of influence in the bride it's not coming from the things we're going through it's not coming from the attitude oh God it's not coming from the atmosphere of our local churches and all the problems what we're under the influence of has come from our future hey brother banish come from our future then what has happened our future has come into our presence to lead us out of our presence what are you getting that preacher the father of God said the spirit of God always comes to the word now listen if I was in your future and I come into your present and I begin to tell you things you ask me brother Andrew what was in my future I could stand there brother and I could tell you brother Joe what was in your future because I'd been there but if I'd never been there it would have been a guess about what's in your future but because I had been there I was able to record it on 1100 books and tapes and tell you what was in your future and this message is none other than the spirit of Truth which was prophesied to come into this generation and to lead you into the future home to lead you into the Rapture to lead you in the things that are to be come on Church get up off the ass Heap we're going home the spirit of Truth has come into our future to lead in goddess oh Hallelujah he said many people they open their hearts to the wrong thing you get a spirit all right but many times there's contradicts the word saying the days of Miracles just passed that did not come from your future there is no such a thing as Divine Healing that did not come from your future he said remember that's a devil pretty plain any brother Tim that's a devil under the disguisement of Christianity he said God help us when we get down here a little bit that you can see it's an evil spirit in the disguisement of Christianity but it isn't the spirit of Christ because the spirit of Christ comes to the word are you ready for this every time he cannot deny his own word see then what is the word of God the word of God is a vision and division will have a speaker which will be a preacher which the prophet of God said that word must come out of a preacher who's lining up with that word see then when the word is preached not what the preacher thinks what the preacher says when the word is preached the word identifies whether you're a Believer or not the prophet of God said they were speaking of Pharisees they were children until the word was preached but when the word was preached and Vindicated then they become Sinners for rejecting the thing that they know was right and witness we know thou art a teacher come from God no man can do these things if God was not with you so when Brotherhood says this he's admonishing preachers to stand for and with the Full Gospel I know we got a whole house full of preachers here have I got any preachers that'll say I'll stand with the Full Gospel I I'll stand with the Full Gospel I will stand with the Full Gospel and I will stand for the Full Gospel let them said then be a man who believes it to be the absolute truth that is a direct Challenge from a word Prophet if we're going to be preachers of this end time message then let's quit let things go and let things by let's be a man with this message and declare it as the absolute now I know I know that little devil runs around and says well you got to be careful if you say the message is the absolute well you may but I don't to be careful but I don't the message is the absolute I said it I meant it I stay listen look at me do I look like an idiot I know brother random was a man I know I was born of Charles Hill random I don't need to spend 20 years studying the message to identify William Branham was a fleshborn man of natural parents I know that but I'm not looking at that man because that man is a flesh man but only inside of him was the spirit of Truth and what he said was the truth and what he preached was the truth and what we say he said is the truth come on Church somebody gonna preach it and somebody gonna believe it and one of these days we're going to ride it right out of time into eternity I know what I'm talking about this message is the truth it's the absolute truth and if it's the absolute truth you ought to give everything you got to it you ought to give your family your come on Church you ought to give your career you ought to give your Wednesday nights and Sunday mornings listen what you bring identifies what you think what you bring identifies listen I don't have to ask you what you think about this message what you bring to a service identifies what you think about it if you bring an old sorry rotten attitude that identifies what you think about it if you bring an old sorry poor pity for me that identifies what you think about it but my Bible said in this bride will be the voice of gladness will be the voice of Joy she will replace the spirit of mourning and the environment of heaviness for the spirit of Praise I think it's time to bring back our praise I think it's time to bring back a sacrifice of praise under this message you say preacher I'm sacrificing I feel good tonight no you're not amen you're not sacrificed when you feel like doing it but when you don't feel like doing it and it hurts your body come on brother Bo I hope you don't mind hey man our brother stood back there and if you've seen this man split you think you ought to be in a hospital tonight ain't nobody brought a sacrifice of praise in the house of God because he identifies I didn't have to ask Bo what he thinks about this message just his being here tonight identifies what he thinks about come on Church I'd have to ask you through all the trials and all the situations you've been through what you think about this message just you're a man and your Hallelujah and you're blessing me the name of the Lord identifies what you think about the message that you're following now you didn't have to ask those main jobs what they thought whether they brought gold frankincense and myrrh which the problem of God said gold was deity frankincense was service and murder was anointing for death he said their gifts testified they believed he was the Lamb of God brother Roy to take away the sins of the world Amen and to testify he was deity in service to die oh he said if you really believe this message then you'll identify it with everything that's within you to believe it to be the truth now I know that devil might as well get out of here tonight because he's outnumbered he's outnumbered there's a pool of faith in here the word is being preached and there's a pool of Faith probably God said see now God has come in the midst of the people and their faith has drawn out Supernatural Words which is explaining to them their life of what they have done what they must do and what will be who else could do that but the spirit of Truth Shreveport 56 he said now they're pulling the people you people is the one I have not one thing to do with that it's just the gift of God see I yield myself to it and you can draw from it yourself you out there in the meetings you can sit and begin to pray to God and watch him turn right around and say something to you see it'll tell you you was praying about and what you asked for that's the power that's in these pews he didn't say brother Wendell that's the power on the poop head he said that's the power and the pews the power in this Pew tonight is the power Amen to pull on God and pull him right into your Pew and city right down next to you and tell him what you have need of oh yeah how many seen it done he said let me see your hands why see sure that's you doing that it's not me then that takes it off of who's preaching that takes it off of the preacher's personality and puts the emphasis back where it should be on the word the word is the discerner of the false and intent people say well brother so-and-so's in town I could get a miracle amen if the Holy Ghost is in town you can get a miracle brother so and so can be in town but if the Holy Ghost ain't here it's just another meeting but if the Holy Ghost will come if the supernatural will break out you'll get an answer to your question yes sir you know why because as that word Goes Forth that absolute truth that you're calling for amen what the devil don't want you to do is he does not want you to tap into the hidden power he does not want you to tap into the hidden power which will break his hold over your life come on the problem God said it's going to take the word to win the case are you with me it's gonna take the word remember first time as an attorney went down there Dr Davis boohoo cried around carried on the the older attorney come down said pitiful's job I've ever heard he said well I thought it's pretty good he said listen it's gonna take some long to win the case and the part of God I love what he says brother Wendell he says I come down here to tell you it's going to take some long to win the case because I know it's in you to be a real lawyer now think about that it was in him to be a real lawyer so somebody cared about him to tell him what was in him could be manifested come on he said it's not your emotions that's going to break the law or break the case it's going to take some law well we might as well preach we're here it's not going to take our emotions to break the atmosphere open it's going to take the word anointed with faith he is the word he is the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit is in us which is the word which is making the promise manifest so then the spirit quickens the word now watch this he said when that word goes out there something's got to happen he said just like David and Goliath he said when David went out there he went out there with a slingshot he said and that slingshot was f-a-i-t-h it was j-e-s-u-s it was g-r-a-c amen it was five smooth stones that David picked up to whip Goliath he said no when he went out there he said he went out there with a word the promise and the power to sling it he said that's what we need today is a man that will take God's word with the power of the Holy Ghost behind him Amen to press it out there and watch it come to pass you know what I say I say thank God for men of God that won't come out in the pulpit and start preaching and come up with a little bit of opposition and pull back and closer Bible and say come back we'll try tomorrow night but they'll stand there and they'll leave that word and delay that word though there's nobody saying amen they'll keep on laying that word because they know the word will break the atmosphere and a miracle will come into manifestation you know what we're going to do we're going to press that word out there every Devlin Hills trying to stop us right now but we're going to press it out for anyhow because we have been anointed hey y'all know what's happening right now I'm pressing out there and you're pulling I'm pressing out there and you're pulling and then you're pushing back and I'm pulling you hear what's happening we're working together not to cut along but to cut the devil's head off we're working together not to cut along but to cut that niggle's head off and bring a liberty well now that's God's Army that's God's Army his word of fire is all dressed his army with the ever presence of himself in there he's going with us how many say thank God for the absolute truth preached thank God for the absolute truth preached sometimes it hurts but thank God sometimes it cuts to the Bone but thank God sometimes it steps on our toes but thank God now now if you look here you I'm moving along very quickly I pray I have just a few more minutes because that word's got to come forward somebody say come forth now when I what I found amazing is in Revelation one when you get time to read it John will actually write about to patna's Vision y'all familiar with it and in that patmosphere he will actually reveal to you or describe what he saw in the Sevenfold personage of Jesus Christ and I want to say this to you I want to I want to show you two two folds of that personage the fourth one was his voice was as the sound of many Waters his voice was as the sound of multitude speaking what is it it's the Judgment for these are the voices of the multitudes of witnesses who by the Holy Spirit All Through the Ages have testified to Christ and preached its gospel it will be the voice of every man rising in judgment Against The Sinner who would not take the warning now watch this the voice of the seven Messengers will be heard loud and clear so don't don't tell me that the voice of the seventh angel will lose its influence the voice of the seventh angel will be heard and it will be heard loud and clear but don't stop there read the rest of the quote he said and those faithful preachers who preach the saving power of Jesus who preach the water baptism who preached the power of the Holy Ghost who stood with the word brother Matt more than they stood with their own lives he said they will be heard because the voice of Jesus Christ by the Holy Ghost was in them you know what I say to you men of God we thank you for preaching the word of God [Applause] the word will stand against the enemy but exactly like it is on the day of judgment he said when the Roar of multitudes condemns you for not having paid heat air it was too late he said take heed this very hour he said listen to his voice it's the voice of his servants as it calls to repentance in life so as the word is going forth It's a calling word it's a summoning word it's a beckoning word it's a drawing word the word is calling you to come up higher Revelation 4 1 the word is calling you to come up higher he said the voice of his servants as it calls to repentance in life so when the pull of faith comes in the building I'm going somewhere when the pull of faith comes in the building amen the word will be preached and you will pull on that word and the voice of God will come out of that man of God as he preaches that word now can I can I go a step further then the six-fold amen description of this personage was that there amen was a two-edged sword the six-fold description was there was a two-edged sword the fourth fold was a voice rather being the six-fold was a two-edged sword oh God the power of your pull is connected to a voice which a prophet connected to a sword you know what he said he said I was up in the mountains of Sabino Canyon and there I was praying and he said while I was praying he said a sword struck my hand he said a sword struck my hand now y'all say the message you know when he was up there praying he was believing it was his end he was saying God take care of my wife and babies this is my end he said but then a voice said it's not your end it's only your beginning it's your ministry it's the third pool oh God are you hearing me did you hear my title The Power of your pool you thought I was talking about your voice you thought I was talking about how loud you can scream I'm talking about the pool that you're under it's the power of your pool come on Church your pool's not the first pull your pool's not for second pull you're 30. who is the third pole which was the opening of the word which was the revealing of the son of man which was the manifestation of the presence of Jesus Christ I wish I was out in the field right now I'd cut up are you hearing me Church the voice of the third pull it's not in a tomb and Jefferson meal it's not in a grave in Jerusalem but for boys of the third Pool isn't Hardy Arkansas tonight okay it's in the bride it's in the bride that's why the devil don't want me to preach it because the third pose in me that's why the devil don't want you to lay minutes because the third pulls in you but somebody's gonna preach it and somebody's gonna amen it and somebody is gonna pick up the sword [Applause] oh it's a two-edged sword brother whether they're on that two edges Lord what does it do it cuts a coming and a going back to it is this all right I'm about to preach myself right out of here the two-edged sword it'll cut a coming and going foreign so as it's going out and it's coming back it's cutting away as it's going out it's cutting Devils as it's coming back it's cutting down come on Church of the Living God it's time to quit sitting there and looking at your enemy it's time to pick up the sword and cut that devil's head off the power of your pool it's the word pool it's performing we're into it was sent for it is the word and it is full of power it is the same Spirit somebody say the same spirit that was in Jesus the word is present again in the church come on as they pulled on God they pulled through Jesus brother Wendell they pulled their desires out of Jesus but it was coming from God because God was in Jesus said watch us that last time that last stage is the last sign it's trying to head the people off from judgment for they rejecting the word and are now already coming to judgment crucifying him and fresh now I know people make statements like well if I had the choice what would I take word or Message Bible or message well I just I'm here so I'm preaching so just give me celebrity in my opinion that's a dumb argument come on that should have been a stronger Amen in my opinion that's a dumb argument it's a dump we we all match well if I was here I'd want a bible message are you are you crazy come are you crazy have you forgot what the prophet said he said the same pedophile that was there when the Bible was being wrote is the same pedophile that's here while the Bible is being interpreted come on church amen they're not two separate entities they are the self same thing a messenger is one with his message and may I pronounce to you tonight that Jesus Christ the son of God is this message he is this message you cannot separate this message from Christ this message is Christ it's Christ and you know what I gotta tell you it'll always be Christ because whenever truth is truth brother hell it'll always be truth I'm turning the corner we're going to go eat whatever it's truth it's always truth so when you're in the valley it's still the truth when you're on the mountain brother it's still the truth when you're sick it's the truth when you're well it's the truth when your church is full it's the truth when there's trouble in the church it's still the truth there is no conditions of time that will change the quantity and quality of an eternal message somebody shout out it's the truth oh shout it I can't believe it it's the truth it's the truth when I feel like it's the truth it's the truth when I don't feel like I say what are you doing I'm running back devil back to Hillary come from this message is the truth [Applause] what a prophet said is the truth I care if it hurts me or you it's the truth anyhow [Applause] it's the word in action it's the word that has never failed in the mouths of believing Christians are you ready for this and in this last stage in this last stage in this last stage that word is here stronger and greater than it's ever been in the true word right that word brother Ben is here greater it's here stronger it's here more powerful than it's ever been and where is it it's in you it's in your pool I said it's in your pool oh God I wish I was a preacher right now it's in your pool it's in your pool it was in the first pool that Hattie got him two boys but in the third pool she got her two boys in the third pool the tumor let's meet his body in the third pool the fish come back alive in the third pool a prophet went beyond the curtain of time in the third pole he opened your future well I feel I feel like praising God it's my pool I'm gonna enjoy it brother when I'm gonna enjoy it I'm gonna preach it I'm gonna amen it and I'm gonna manifest it yeah brother Carter I met people I've met people they're smart enough to no let me say this they're uneducated enough to say they'd be where they are without a prophet wow now y'all just got to forgive me but again it's not a very smart statement because I tell you what you should be without a prophet you'd be you'd been confused Babylonian [Applause] you'd be a confused Pentecostal but God deposited a profit into your bank account [Applause] God deposited to Malachi 4 into your bank account God deposited Luke 17 30 into your bank accounts God deposited John 14 12 into your bank account God deposited Mark 16 into your bank account God deposited to Revelation 5 into your bank account he deposited Revelation 10 into your bank account he deposited revelation 22 into your he deposited to Revelation 18 into your bank account and somebody's going to draw from it brother being somebody's going to pull from it somebody is going to draw the cash dividends well I'd be where I'm at without a prophet no you wouldn't you'd be a blindly out of sin on your way to hell but God rich and mercy allowed a profit to come across your path and open your eyes to see that what he said his word is is what he always will be I'm going to show it to you because you wouldn't be where you are without a prophet I know there's a lot of preachers running around and they get a few little services and a good little education about the message and they think they can go beyond the profit well listen here buddy it won't be long and you'll be wrecked up on the side of the road and any church that lays aside what a prophet told will become a meaningless Gathering of people but if a prophet is in the church they say by the end of the Prophet stand how dare you say the Holy Ghost is dead brother Dale the Holy Ghost is not dead you know why because the prophet said the prophet is the Holy Ghost then pray tell me Church who is the spirit of Truth who is the seventh angel anointing it's coming from the spirit of God now you say preach you're getting out there well actually I'm not because under this message I'm close with this point under this message I feel like it under this message there was a faith that was activated under this message brother ram calls it a living faith he directly connects Jude 1 3 which says I contend for the faith of Jesus Christ rather Seth he directly connects that Amen to to a living faith and says the faith of Jesus Christ the son of God is a living faith he said that my gift is given to stimulate Faith you know what faith was made to do Faith was made to increase Faith was made to grow Faith was made to expand come on church I know the Bible says Brother David I know the Bible says that Faith the size of a grain of a mustard seed we'll move them out I know that brother Josh you know that amen but let's go a step further God did not intend for our faith to remain in a mustard seed size if he did he would have never sent Malachi 4 if he did he would have never opened your eyes to the quickening power of Romans 8 chapter and the 11th verse that if the same spirit that raised Jesus from the dead will dwell in your body he will also Quicken your Immortal body church God sent the Holy Ghost brother Harvey to increase your faith now not one time it was insane form at one time it was in mustard grain Farm but now it's growing let me prove it to you from the Bible Luke 17 the Apostle said Lord increase our faith brother random changes the word increase to stimulate and says this stimulate the faith of the people that they might see God's willingness to heal them see because there will be a church that will be a great church and it will be full of faith God sent these things down to stimulate Faith to bring out Faith to prove what faith is why so faith can operate y'all agree with me right now Faith is operating while I'm preaching [Applause] brother faith is operating right now while I'm preaching in this building faith is working I'm not laying my hands on you brother Daryl but faith is I'm not playing I know it's the first night and I gotta I gotta get this horse in the barn but listen to me Faith is operating faith is at work faith is working faith is moving listen church this is not a feeling meeting this is a faith-based meeting this is not a personality meeting this is a faith-based mean this is a meeting we're so oh God gotta go ahead and preaching when we got some local pastors that's been labored in their churches and we've got a place to come this weekend and join our faith together and let Faith arise and the enemies of God be scattered this is a body move but the faith of Jesus Christ the faith that was dead has been resurrected [Applause] now I'm gonna close with this and you are in position to pull you weren't before a Prophet come you say well preacher bless God I knew how to pull I pulled Pentecost then how come you went home said you had a good sermon and the preacher didn't even get to preach foreign s you put on the music but you didn't pull on the word because you cannot know how to put on the word unless a prophet positionally places you and gives you the ability by the spirit of God to pull on that word listen without this Prophet you're going to keep passion through prayer lines come on Church Without this Prophet you're going to keep making routine trips to the altar but with the prophet he is not just bringing you to the altar he's not just bringing you through a prayer line but he's positionally placing you under a Joshua anointing to pull on the Unseen God let me prove it to you in the when the problem of God said to these diseases and affliction is 1950 he said there I was first meeting Miami Florida I promise I'm closing it first meet Miami Florida he said he was having a fast line brother Daryl you prayed probably thousands of them amen fast lines he said now there were thousands there to be prayed for he said but while I was praying he said there was one little girl come through one little girl one little girl there was one little girl there was one little girl come through he said and I noticed she had a tooth missing she had braces around her hip and she had braces down her legs he said when she comes through brother man he said I she caught my attention he said when I looked at her I said little sis God bless you may the Lord Jesus heal you and she walked on through with the braces he said a few minutes later here come little girl back around same little girl he said I realized she didn't have no faith little girl didn't have no faith he said I realized she didn't have no faith he said so what I've done brother Tim was I pulled her out of the prayer line and I positionally placed her behind me he said oh God I put her behind me brother Wesley he said and I told her you take your hand and you hold the hymn of my coat and you stand there and you pull on the Hem of my coat he said and while you're pulling he said pray he said you help me pray for these sick people rather being she didn't have no faith for herself how's she going to help a prophet pray for sick people but a prophet who was anointed with the spirit of Truth he knew what was in her future oh God he knew what was in her future he knew what was in her future so he took the time and the preparation years and he positionally placed her and he said they would come through I'd say Lord Jesus and I'd feel her Heavenly Father Heavenly Father I'd feel her he said every now and again brother Jeff I turn around I tell you still praying she stay still praying he said all of a sudden I felt it he said all of a sudden I felt it pump pump he said up up up he said my faith okay he said as her faith raised he said my faith turned to a perfect Faith he said I realized she knew it was hers he said I turned around I said little sis you believe now don't you she said oh yes I do he said take off him crutches and you go walk you go walk in the name of Jesus Christ brother Her Mama come over there and said don't you do it he said if she's ever gonna walk she's gonna walk right now and Church of the Living God how long have we been sitting underneath these tapes how long have we been going to meetings if there's ever been a time to take off for crutches and start walking Now's the Time to do it if this God's ever gonna walk Now's the Time to walk walk in power walking Authority once you stand your feet and get God praise [Applause] if there's ever been a time to walk now's the time to do it if there's ever been a time to pull on the word now's the time to do it [Applause] you couldn't do it a few years ago but when a prophet positionally placed you when a prophet placed you and a prophet taught you how to pull he said you pull he said as you pull your faith will operate that gift there we go Church 11 God I don't know I'm about to explode in here right now do you see who you are do you see where you stand [Music] a prophet put you in position now come on Church your crutches may not be from a crippled condition but you know what every one of us it got crutches only got flesh brother all we got flesh and we got bars of bone and you know what they are they're crutches they're braces here but you keep on pulling on this word you keep on pulling on this Eagle food you keep on laying underneath this absolute truth and service by service by service your faith is going [Music] [Applause] take by take by take by tape your face going [Music] that Rapture and faith is getting so big in you [Music] you're literally going to pull a body change [Music] you're literally gonna pull a body change out of the Unseen Realm some more [Music] stand in the mirror and you're going to see loved ones appear behind you now listen brother remember says it very plainly says the gift comes on me he said but you use it the gift comes on me but you use it you know Church I believe here tonight I believe what a prophet said he said the best way to get anything from God is to cry out for it can I say this to you if you can give me Psalms 34 6. it's very it's very astounding to me the Bible says this polar man cried poor mankind brother Ben do you see what I see this poor man cried and the Lord heard him who to hear Brother Joel that poor man and saved him who's that him that poor man out of all of his who's that he is that poor man troubles but what if I told you tonight you're not that poor man some of y'all was looking at me pretty funny right now what if I told you there was a poor lady in Kentucky who had nothing and they come by and did a welfare check owner [Music] and they come in and they said ma'am you're sitting here poor poor son he's over in Kentucky or over in India they said really they said yeah they said do you not hear from me she said well he's busy but but every month he sent me the most beautiful postcards every month he sends me the most beautiful pictures they said well let's take a look at him so they went over on the shelf and they got one over off and they opened it up and

years ago they said no them are not postcards them are MoneyGrams for a year she had been sitting there as a poor woman they've been collecting money grams and didn't even realize it till God sent a gift by her way and they took those money cards and they laid them out and wrote them said when they got done counting jaw she was the richest woman in the entire County come on church if a poor man can get a hold of God if a poor man can be seen from all these troubles then what about the richest people on the face of the Earth tonight this Sprite is not a poverty stricken bride she is the
