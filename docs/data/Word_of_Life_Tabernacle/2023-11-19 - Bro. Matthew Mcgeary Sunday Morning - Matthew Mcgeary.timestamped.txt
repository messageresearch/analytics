[50:48] read in our Bibles here uh in Matthew
[50:51] chapter 25 before we do I do bring
[50:53] greetings from our pastor Brother David
[50:55] meiri and the Saints there at Christian
[50:57] Life Tabernacle in Bedford Texas the
[50:59] scripture would read like this in
[51:02] Matthew chapter 25 and verse uh 1
[51:05] through 7 it says then shall the Kingdom
[51:08] of Heaven be likened unto 10 virgins
[51:10] which took their lamps and went forth to
[51:12] meet the bridegroom and five of them
[51:16] were wise and five were
[51:18] foolish they that were foolish took
[51:20] their lamps and took no oil with them
[51:23] but the wise took oil in their vessels
[51:25] with their lambs while the bridegroom
[51:27] tarried they all slumbered and slept and
[51:30] at the Midnight Cry and at midnight
[51:33] there was a cry made behold the
[51:34] bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him
[51:39] then all those virgins arose and trimmed
[51:42] their
[51:44] lamps and all those virgins arose and
[51:47] trimmed their lamps well it said all
[51:50] them arose and trim their lamps but you
[51:52] know out of all of those that Rose there
[51:53] was just a few that actually had oil if
[51:56] you'll turn in uh to Revelations chapter
[51:59] 19 for one more
[52:17] reading Revelations 197 would read like
[52:20] this let us be glad and rejoice and give
[52:22] honor to him for the marriage of the
[52:24] Lamb has come and his wife life hath
[52:26] made herself ready amen we ask a
[52:29] blessing upon the reading of the word
[52:30] you may have your
[52:33] seats I just want to read a quote here
[52:36] out of the Rapture the prophet of God
[52:38] would say the first thing come when he
[52:40] starts descending from Heaven there's a
[52:42] shout yeah what is it is a message to
[52:45] get the people together a message comes
[52:48] forth first now lamp trimming time rise
[52:51] and trim your lamps what what what was
[52:55] that the seventh not the sixth the
[52:56] seventh behold the bridegroom cometh
[52:58] rise and trim your lamps and they did
[53:01] some of them found they didn't even have
[53:03] oil in their lamp see but it's lamp
[53:06] trimming time it's Malachi 4 time what
[53:08] he promised in Luke 17 all those
[53:11] prophecies that it can perfectly set in
[53:13] order for this day in the scripture we
[53:16] see it living right there and in the The
[53:19] Rapture that brother brandham said the
[53:21] shout is the messenger getting the
[53:23] people ready and in time of evangelism
[53:25] he said the end time message is to get
[53:27] the bride ready and prepared for the
[53:30] Rapture what can it do according to
[53:32] Malachi 4 is bring them back to the
[53:34] faith that was once delivered to the
[53:36] Saints and what I want to speak to you a
[53:38] little bit this morning on is ready and
[53:41] prepared for the Rapture and I want to
[53:43] say this this preparation isn't always
[53:46] easy you know uh if you look at a
[53:48] prophet's life the way could be uh very
[53:50] hard the way that he's prepared and the
[53:52] the journey and the trials and and the
[53:55] way way you go you know this way is a
[53:56] rugged way it's it's the harder way you
[53:58] know character it it's a victory we we
[54:01] go through great trials and test but you
[54:04] know as Paul would say there in second
[54:06] uh Corinthians he say for our light
[54:07] Affliction which is but for a moment
[54:09] worketh for us a far more exceedingly an
[54:12] eternally weight of Glory but we want to
[54:15] be ready we want to be ready within this
[54:18] hour that we're living in and just to
[54:20] give you a definition of preparation
[54:23] it's the action or process of making
[54:25] something ready for use or service or
[54:28] getting ready for some occasion it's a
[54:31] for a test or a duty and I just want to
[54:33] say that every single day we should be
[54:35] getting ready uh and preparing for the
[54:39] rapture we we should be promoting the
[54:41] Rapture you know Pro promoting means to
[54:44] advance to to put forward it should be
[54:46] on the Forefront of your mind and on the
[54:48] Forefront of your thinking everything
[54:50] that you you're doing everything that
[54:51] you're preparing for everything that
[54:53] you're getting ready for rapture rure
[54:55] should be on your for thinking Rapture
[54:57] should be on your mind Rapture should be
[54:59] on your heart Rapture should be in your
[55:01] conversation everything that you're
[55:03] you're doing and everything that you're
[55:05] working for it all should be for Rapture
[55:08] because because the bride has made
[55:10] herself ready oh the scripture says
[55:12] Rejoice for the marriage of the Lamb has
[55:14] come we should be rejoicing we we should
[55:17] be in a Thanksgiving we should be
[55:19] offering praise honor and worship for
[55:21] the hour has come this invisible Union
[55:23] of the Bride of Jesus Christ with the
[55:25] bridegroom is now here taking place on
[55:28] Earth in a union oh my what an hour what
[55:31] a time and we should be ready for the
[55:33] great coming of the Lord where these
[55:35] bodies are translated and we meet him in
[55:37] the air everything you should be
[55:39] thinking about should be
[55:41] Rapture come on you know you you hang
[55:44] around somebody long enough and and you
[55:46] you you you'll start to find out what
[55:48] they really believe and what they really
[55:50] think and and what's important to them
[55:52] and and what they spend their time doing
[55:55] right come on you know you get to spend
[55:58] a little time and maybe they can talk
[56:00] about this or that or you go hang out
[56:01] with them or you go into their home or
[56:03] you go to their workplace and and after
[56:05] a while you'll find out what's really
[56:07] important to them what they spend their
[56:09] time doing what what they want to invest
[56:11] their time in and and their efforts and
[56:14] and everything you know your your time
[56:16] has great
[56:17] value that's right you know I want to
[56:20] say that your your time is currency by
[56:22] which you make a
[56:23] purchase your your your time is
[56:26] extremely important what you invest in
[56:28] and what you think about you know I I I
[56:30] was thinking about that if if you make
[56:32] $10 an hour and and somebody else makes
[56:35] $100 an hour and you both work zero
[56:37] hours who made more
[56:39] money that's right come on you got to
[56:43] put the time in to get the
[56:46] value I want to say that you exchange
[56:48] your time for something that's
[56:52] right come on all of our time all of our
[56:55] effort the thing that we we we spend uh
[56:57] H uh thinking about you know Paul would
[57:01] say this in Philippians 4:8 we're very
[57:03] familiar say finally Brethren whatsoever
[57:05] things are true whatsoever things are
[57:07] honest whatsoever things are just
[57:09] whatsoever things are pure whatsoever
[57:11] things are lovely whatsoever things are
[57:13] of good report if there be any virtue if
[57:16] there be any praise think on these
[57:20] things you know Proverbs would say as a
[57:23] man thinketh in his heart so is he you
[57:26] know I I want to tell you there is a
[57:27] great battle going on for your mind
[57:30] Satan is constantly bombarding your mind
[57:33] and constantly trying to to press this
[57:36] place into your thinking and cause you
[57:38] to think about everything else but the
[57:40] Rapture come on he wants you to think
[57:43] about his news and his ideas and the The
[57:46] Cutting Edge of technology and and what
[57:48] you got to do for work and this that
[57:50] tomorrow and how you can save a penny
[57:52] there and how you can save a penny here
[57:54] and and how can I get a nicer car how am
[57:56] I going to get a nicer house and and I
[57:58] need to study and I need to get a better
[58:00] education and maybe I need to drive down
[58:02] to Little Rock for a career and and
[58:04] maybe it just ain't working out where
[58:06] I'm living and maybe I need to move to
[58:07] the big city just seems like I can never
[58:09] get on top of things I can never get
[58:11] ahead I'm always in debt I see other
[58:13] people driving nice cars and have a nice
[58:15] house and and I'm just sitting here in
[58:17] my double white trailer and and
[58:19] everybody else is blessed but I'm not
[58:21] blessed did your blessings come from a
[58:23] double ey trailer did your blessings
[58:24] come from God our blessing isn't here on
[58:27] Earth our blessing is beyond the river
[58:30] you have a mansion on the hilltop that's
[58:32] prepared for you what are you living for
[58:34] I'm not living for this world I'm not
[58:36] living for a house I'm not living for a
[58:38] car I'm living for my Lord Jesus Christ
[58:40] who paid for your sins who died for you
[58:43] that's what your blessing is he
[58:45] purchased all things for you that's what
[58:47] you should be thinking about you
[58:48] shouldn't be thinking about all the
[58:50] natural things and all the carnal things
[58:51] and how you can get ahead in this life I
[58:53] want to get ahead in that
[58:55] life yes
[58:58] sir I want to be changed in a moment in
[59:01] the twinkling of an eye yeah you know
[59:03] love thinketh no evil perfect love cast
[59:06] out fear this ought to be the things uh
[59:08] that's pertinent upon our heart and the
[59:10] things that we would think about as Jude
[59:12] would write exhorting the Saints to
[59:14] earnestly contend for the faith gr lord
[59:17] it's something we're fighting for yes
[59:20] sir something we're working
[59:22] for something we should be striving for
[59:25] every single
[59:26] day given our times and our efforts to
[59:29] advance the kingdom of
[59:31] God oh help us
[59:36] Lord thank you
[59:38] Lord just want to read a quote out of
[59:41] here a trump gives an uncertain
[59:45] sound the prophet of God would say
[59:48] that's one thing that certain God made a
[59:50] promise God is going to keep the
[59:52] promisen aren't you thankful for that
[59:55] how can this thing happen how can he get
[59:58] a bunch of people together with Rapture
[59:59] and Grace to go up I don't know how he
[1:00:02] will do it it's not my business to ask
[1:00:05] how he'll do it it's my business just to
[1:00:07] be ready for it he promised it's going
[1:00:10] to happen fortified his church by his
[1:00:13] word our business is to be ready for it
[1:00:16] I'm not exactly sure the day or the hour
[1:00:18] I'm not exactly sure how it's all going
[1:00:20] to be happen but I have a responsibility
[1:00:23] that I want to be ready for the change
[1:00:25] of this body and I want to ask what are
[1:00:27] we doing with our time what are we doing
[1:00:29] with our efforts what are we what are we
[1:00:30] doing every day are we actually
[1:00:32] preparing for this or we have we gotten
[1:00:34] to a place where we're complacent and I
[1:00:36] believe the message and I'm ready and I
[1:00:38] believe Malachi 4 and and so I'll just
[1:00:41] work and I'll get a job and I'll go to
[1:00:43] church and you you're just you're just
[1:00:45] wandering through life no different than
[1:00:47] any other denominational with a thought
[1:00:49] or an idea or a thinking that you're
[1:00:51] okay but this message got to be living
[1:00:53] it has to be be an action it got to be a
[1:00:56] life it has to be the person of Jesus
[1:00:58] Christ Living in you and through you oh
[1:01:00] living out to a dying generation seeking
[1:01:02] Souls that are lost there got to be
[1:01:05] something more than just some
[1:01:06] denomination some man's thinking some
[1:01:09] idea we got to be living for something
[1:01:10] we got to be constantly getting and
[1:01:13] ready for Rapture oh
[1:01:15] yeah how are you going to do it by his
[1:01:20] word oh thank you Lord Joshua and Caleb
[1:01:23] didn't know how they were going to do it
[1:01:25] come on they just knew God had give the
[1:01:27] promise when they went over and tasted
[1:01:30] of the good land and they came back with
[1:01:31] the evidences with the Holy Ghost and
[1:01:34] say look look at the land that God
[1:01:36] promised it's there let's go take it yes
[1:01:39] sir all of the other people were looking
[1:01:41] at how they were going to go do it well
[1:01:44] how are we going to be changed how are
[1:01:46] we going to be translated how how is
[1:01:48] this little we've just been wandering
[1:01:50] around in the wilderness with a couple
[1:01:52] buckets of Mana we don't really how are
[1:01:54] we going to be Steels chariots and iron
[1:01:56] and swords and big wall fent cities see
[1:01:59] they had got ahead and they started to
[1:02:00] look at the circumstance they weren't
[1:02:02] even looking at the promise but that's
[1:02:04] what Joshua and Caleb did they stood up
[1:02:05] and stealed the people said look we're
[1:02:07] more than able to take it look you are
[1:02:09] more than able to go into the Rapture
[1:02:12] you're more than able to have the change
[1:02:14] and translation of your body you're more
[1:02:16] than able to do and believe all things
[1:02:19] why because God gave the promise he
[1:02:21] promised it he said it he fortified You
[1:02:24] by his word so therefore it's going to
[1:02:26] come to pass yes
[1:02:28] sir how are you going to do it by his
[1:02:30] word how you going to do it by his word
[1:02:32] God promised God said
[1:02:35] so I think of Abraham Abraham didn't
[1:02:38] know about
[1:02:39] it you know God God told him hey you're
[1:02:41] you're going to be a father of many
[1:02:43] nations now he's getting old Sarah's
[1:02:46] laughing about it how are these things
[1:02:48] ever going he didn't know that God was
[1:02:49] going to change his body on Abraham
[1:02:53] didn't didn't know that well I let me
[1:02:56] let me tell you exactly how I'm going
[1:02:58] then it wouldn't have taken
[1:02:59] Faith come on sometimes we just want to
[1:03:02] take Faith out of the equation come on
[1:03:05] Lord I'll believe you if you just show
[1:03:07] me how it's all going to happen all
[1:03:09] right where's the faith in that come
[1:03:12] on well Abraham I'm going to make you a
[1:03:15] father of many nations and you're going
[1:03:16] to go you're going to go down into Egypt
[1:03:18] you're gonna you're gonna betray your
[1:03:20] wife and you know then the king's going
[1:03:22] to take and then I'm going to do this
[1:03:23] I'm going to do that and he's just going
[1:03:24] to lay it all out and then there's no
[1:03:26] faith in it come on sometimes we
[1:03:29] sometimes you're praying for an answer
[1:03:31] that you don't
[1:03:33] need I think the message has everything
[1:03:35] you have need of you need an answer from
[1:03:38] God I believe if you listen to the shout
[1:03:40] if you listen listen to the voice of God
[1:03:42] speaking to you in this age you will
[1:03:44] hear the voice of God to you for what
[1:03:46] you need to do for the hour that you
[1:03:48] living in and then praise God he has a
[1:03:50] dress wear and a five-fold Ministry and
[1:03:52] there's there's uh ones in the body
[1:03:54] filled with the Holy Ghost if you need
[1:03:56] an answer if God wants to speak directly
[1:03:58] through your brother and sister he'll do
[1:04:00] it but God has given us our word that we
[1:04:02] don't have to have it all mapped out
[1:04:03] what we got to have is faith in his word
[1:04:06] that says Lord you gave the promise
[1:04:08] you're more than able to perform it and
[1:04:10] we can stand there like Abraham as the
[1:04:12] scripture would say and Abraham
[1:04:14] staggered not at the promise of God
[1:04:16] because he knew the one that made the
[1:04:18] promise was more than able to bring it
[1:04:20] pass I'm so glad that I'm standing here
[1:04:23] believing the shout believe in Malachi
[1:04:25] 4:5 and I don't have to worry about my
[1:04:28] ability I don't have to worry about my
[1:04:30] flesh I don't have to worry about my
[1:04:31] past I don't have to worry about my
[1:04:33] failures and my complexes and everything
[1:04:35] that I've ever done to mess it up all my
[1:04:38] faith is in the word of God he said I
[1:04:40] was going in a Rapture he said I was his
[1:04:42] bride he said I was an overcomer he said
[1:04:45] I was healed and if he said it I believe
[1:04:47] it heavens and earth will pass away but
[1:04:49] there's one thing that will never pass
[1:04:51] away and that is the word of God
[1:04:55] I say what are you standing on this
[1:04:57] morning come on we're standing on the
[1:04:59] rock of
[1:05:01] Revelation heavens and earth will pass
[1:05:03] away but God's word will never pass
[1:05:07] away I say what do you have need of this
[1:05:11] morning that's good God give you the
[1:05:14] promise didn't he right by his stripes
[1:05:17] you're already healed thou can't believe
[1:05:20] all things are
[1:05:22] possible where is somebody you have a
[1:05:25] need this morning something you've been
[1:05:26] believing for oh come on let's start
[1:05:29] having an
[1:05:30] expectation may maybe you've been
[1:05:32] fighting a long time say brother Matthew
[1:05:34] I'm getting pretty discouraged I've been
[1:05:35] hanging on and and I'm starting to
[1:05:37] believe it's never going to happen don't
[1:05:39] give into that Voice come on that's a
[1:05:42] lie by his stripes you are already

[1:06:55] oh yeah that we're living for
[1:06:57] Rapture this this there's a deep calling
[1:07:00] to a deep I got to be changed brother
[1:07:02] Ben yes sir H this this mortality has to
[1:07:05] put on immortality come on whether I go
[1:07:09] by the grave or whether I'm those that
[1:07:12] are alive and remain I'm living for that
[1:07:14] moment I'm living for that
[1:07:16] change come on we got to have a
[1:07:19] vigilance we we got to have an awareness
[1:07:21] about us that everything's fighting this
[1:07:24] di uhh from from Catching these
[1:07:26] Revelations that lays within the
[1:07:29] word the revelation of who you are
[1:07:32] that's right the revelation of the two
[1:07:34] Spirits within the framework of the
[1:07:35] church Satan's trying to keep you from
[1:07:38] digging in and getting Revelation and
[1:07:40] consecrating your life and laying in the
[1:07:43] presence of the sun baking out of the
[1:07:45] draws and all the greenness he wants you
[1:07:47] to busy yourself with the things of life
[1:07:49] where Rapture does not become the
[1:07:51] preeminent purpose and goal for you come
[1:07:54] on it's so easy to get
[1:07:57] distracted it's so easy for us to start
[1:08:00] to look off to
[1:08:03] everything come on but we ought to have
[1:08:04] the re resolve to say look I'm going in
[1:08:06] a
[1:08:07] Rapture today is Rapture sir tomorrow is
[1:08:11] Rapture every day is Rapture this is
[1:08:13] what I'm living for and I'm going to
[1:08:14] make myself ready and I'm going to be
[1:08:18] prepared for that hour and that
[1:08:21] moment I wonder are we making prepar
[1:08:24] ations what are you preparing for oh
[1:08:27] my I think it's important that we don't
[1:08:30] look so
[1:08:32] much at the Rapture as so much as an
[1:08:35] event but it's an
[1:08:36] unfolding the coming of the lord it's an
[1:08:39] unfolding you know the resurrection is
[1:08:42] not an event it's a
[1:08:44] person that's right well what did Mary
[1:08:46] say or Martha say to the Lord he he said
[1:08:49] I am the resurrection oh yes right she
[1:08:54] was looking to an event but she had the
[1:08:56] person of the Resurrection standing
[1:08:58] there in her presence don't you realize
[1:09:00] the person of the Resurrection is
[1:09:03] standing in your presence the person of
[1:09:05] the Rapture is here right now that can
[1:09:08] change your bodies in a moment I want to
[1:09:10] see Rapture is in you look if Jesus
[1:09:13] Christ was the word and he said I am the
[1:09:16] resurrection right and the resurrection
[1:09:19] was a
[1:09:20] person come on come on all right yeah
[1:09:24] but the prophet of God said you become
[1:09:26] the word as you receive the word and if
[1:09:29] the promise of the hour is resurrection
[1:09:32] if the promise of the hour is Rapture I
[1:09:34] want to say you are the Rapture oh yeah
[1:09:37] quit looking at it so much as an event
[1:09:40] but the very preparation that Readiness
[1:09:42] is something that's taking place on the
[1:09:44] inside of the believer as you come in a
[1:09:46] union with Jesus Christ you are
[1:09:48] preparing yourself you're becoming ready
[1:09:51] that you might be translated in a moment
[1:09:53] and and a twinkling of an eye and be
[1:09:55] changed to be out look the Rapture is in
[1:09:57] you oh thank you Lord you want to know
[1:10:00] where the Rapture is I'm looking at the
[1:10:02] Rapture come on you are the Rapture yes
[1:10:06] sir well if you want to go in the
[1:10:08] Rapture if you want the culmination of
[1:10:10] the Rapture and the changing of our
[1:10:12] bodies that behooves us to get
[1:10:14] ready oh yes get ready what are you
[1:10:18] preparing
[1:10:19] for oh that's good you know athletes and
[1:10:23] all these people what they they they get
[1:10:25] ready they prepare yeah that's right I
[1:10:29] mean if you look at the hours of
[1:10:31] preparation to the hours on the game
[1:10:33] field it's not comparison come
[1:10:37] on that's right you I I think there's a
[1:10:40] saying by some famous uh Chinese scholar
[1:10:43] who was a a a military uh uh leader I
[1:10:47] maybe not get it get it right the way he
[1:10:49] said it but he said you know people that
[1:10:52] will will win the fight they they they
[1:10:54] they prepare and they win the battle
[1:10:56] before they go to battle he said others
[1:10:58] show up to the battle and try to find
[1:11:00] out how they're going to
[1:11:02] win look I don't want it I don't want
[1:11:04] that I I don't want the trials and the
[1:11:06] calamities to strike and me finally get
[1:11:08] in desperation and say you know what God
[1:11:10] I'm not living the way I need to live
[1:11:11] and and and now this has happened and
[1:11:14] that has happened I better get my act
[1:11:16] together it takes those things sure
[1:11:18] sometimes we don't live right and God
[1:11:20] gots to put you flat on your back where
[1:11:22] you thought you had what
[1:11:24] you thought you had and you realized you
[1:11:25] didn't well that's okay it's a wakeup
[1:11:27] call God can deal with your heart but I
[1:11:29] say why why not right
[1:11:31] now why don't we get consecrated why
[1:11:34] don't we get sincere why don't we start
[1:11:35] to get real within our families and our
[1:11:38] lives and say you know what to this
[1:11:40] morning I'm going to rededicate my life
[1:11:42] I'm going to reconsecrate my life I you
[1:11:44] know I really haven't been living with
[1:11:46] that fervency and that desire I think
[1:11:49] back to the day when Jesus Christ came
[1:11:51] and he saved me and he delivered me from
[1:11:53] sin and now that the kids have come and
[1:11:54] marriage has come and I've kind of you
[1:11:56] know the busyness of life I realize I'm
[1:11:58] not praying like a to I'm not I'm not
[1:12:01] really seeking the Lord like I well
[1:12:02] that's okay we go through Seasons we go
[1:12:04] through Winters we go through Summers
[1:12:06] Springs and Falls but I say if you can
[1:12:08] just purpose within your heart this

[1:12:12] to be on fire I want to be ready I want
[1:12:14] to Proclaim Rapture to my neighbors I
[1:12:17] want to Proclaim Rapture to the
[1:12:18] workplace I want to Proclaim Rapture to

[1:12:23] my family everything I'm living for is
[1:12:26] Rapture thank you Lord oh I want to go
[1:12:29] be with my Lord oh yes I want to read a
[1:12:33] quote out of Christ the
[1:12:36] mystery
[1:12:38] good prophet of God would say and
[1:12:42] remember we are now as his
[1:12:45] bride pregnated with his
[1:12:48] Spirit oh my the church bearing Children
[1:12:51] See pregnated by his spirit with his
[1:12:53] name burying his name bearing his life
[1:12:56] bringing forth the signs of his life
[1:12:58] evident with the pinenes evidence of his
[1:13:01] resurrection showing that he is not dead
[1:13:03] but alive forever more this eternal life
[1:13:06] and Vindicated vindicates to the world
[1:13:08] that we are alive in him how do you know
[1:13:11] because you're a church member because
[1:13:13] Christ is living through you so
[1:13:16] pregnated with his Spirit you're a
[1:13:18] prisoner to anything else you're
[1:13:20] confined oh myy the gospel confined to
[1:13:23] his word and all the children that you
[1:13:26] can bring forth is
[1:13:29] that oh my this is powerful all the
[1:13:32] children that you can bring for is that
[1:13:34] because you're a prisoner oh yes right
[1:13:38] are you a
[1:13:41] prisoner come on some of us are we have
[1:13:44] dual prisoners
[1:13:47] ship you're prison half the time to God
[1:13:50] and you're prison half the time to your
[1:13:52] flesh
[1:13:54] you know I had an odd dream a while back
[1:13:56] where I I I I I I it was so vivid and so
[1:14:00] real that it was kind of odd and and and
[1:14:03] striking because I I I all a sudden was
[1:14:06] in a in a jail cell and and there wasn't
[1:14:09] any windows I I couldn't even look look
[1:14:11] back and I felt like I couldn't even
[1:14:13] turn around the the only thing I could
[1:14:15] do was was look in front of me and and I
[1:14:17] was in this prison and there was this
[1:14:19] Corridor and it seemed like uh uh there
[1:14:21] was something in me just advanced just
[1:14:23] go forward you you can't you can't you
[1:14:26] can't turn around you can't go back this
[1:14:28] is a life sentence and and I was in
[1:14:31] there because I had killed a
[1:14:33] man and I thought this is this is a this
[1:14:37] is this is odd I I don't understand this
[1:14:40] but but but but in there there was this
[1:14:43] fulfillment there was there was this
[1:14:45] peace there was this direction there was
[1:14:48] this unction that that be be the this is
[1:14:51] the way things are now they they can't
[1:14:55] be changed and so uh where you're at uh
[1:14:58] you're a prisoner now so you got to take
[1:15:01] what's been given to you and now you got
[1:15:03] to start moving forward and I it was
[1:15:06] really striking to me I it was so vivid
[1:15:08] upon my heart you know many times well
[1:15:10] not many times but sometimes if you wake
[1:15:13] and maybe a dream is vivid or and then
[1:15:15] maybe it stays with you and maybe it can
[1:15:17] be a dream in such a way where you start
[1:15:19] to ask the lord lord uh uh uh what what
[1:15:22] is
[1:15:23] this what does this dream all mean and
[1:15:26] and and it come to me I realized that
[1:15:29] that the man that had died was my old
[1:15:32] nature oh
[1:15:33] my it it was the old person that I was
[1:15:37] but I had now become a prisoner to Jesus
[1:15:40] Christ and there wasn't even a window to
[1:15:42] look out to the things of the world
[1:15:44] there was no ability to turn around and
[1:15:46] go back to the past but now I had become
[1:15:48] a prisoner and the only thing there was
[1:15:50] to advance the kingdom of God the only
[1:15:53] ability I had was to go forward the only
[1:15:55] ability I had was to promote Rapture the
[1:15:57] only thing I could do regardless of my
[1:15:59] past regardless of my failures
[1:16:01] regardless of my state it didn't matter
[1:16:03] anymore that old man was dead the only
[1:16:05] thing mattered that now I become a
[1:16:07] prisoner to Jesus Christ and the only
[1:16:10] thing I can do is March forward by his
[1:16:12] word by his stripes by his blood just
[1:16:16] keep going just keep pressing just keep
[1:16:18] believing just keep going
[1:16:21] forward oh thank you Lord that's a
[1:16:25] prisoner no ability to go to the left or
[1:16:28] to the right hand I'm now a prisoner I'm
[1:16:30] a love slave to Jesus Christ Lord what
[1:16:33] do you want for my life what do you want
[1:16:35] me to say what do you want me to speak

[1:17:41] first Nature has to
[1:17:45] die that's good in Romans 74 he would
[1:17:50] say wherefore my brethren ye also are
[1:17:52] become dead to the law all by the body
[1:17:53] of Christ that you should be married to
[1:17:57] another even to him who is raised from
[1:18:00] the dead that we should bring forth
[1:18:02] fruit unto God look we got to be
[1:18:04] bringing forth the fruit of the word
[1:18:07] come on we got to be bringing forth
[1:18:09] Children of the word we got to be
[1:18:11] bringing forth prophecies and Promises
[1:18:13] into manifestation and the fruits of the
[1:18:15] spirit into manifestation in our
[1:18:20] lives that's good
[1:18:25] prophet of God would say so to be
[1:18:27] married to the second Adam
[1:18:29] Christ this is out of invisible Union
[1:18:32] where just uh pulling my inspiration
[1:18:36] from that would be brother brandom's
[1:18:39] Thanksgiving message to the
[1:18:41] church so to be married to the second
[1:18:43] Adam Christ the word you must separate
[1:18:46] yourself by Death from your first
[1:18:49] denominational husband that's right cuz
[1:18:51] there isn't one of of them that can take
[1:18:54] all the word of
[1:18:56] God on well I never was in a
[1:19:00] denomination I was born in the message
[1:19:04] well you better watch
[1:19:06] out Prophet said you had to be separated
[1:19:09] and die to your first denominational
[1:19:12] husband if you start to reason with that
[1:19:14] and say well you know I never was in a
[1:19:16] denomination and I never come with that
[1:19:18] might be your denominational husband
[1:19:20] talking that might be that old you're
[1:19:23] talking well that really doesn't apply
[1:19:24] to you you know a denominational
[1:19:26] spirit's very religious oh yes it
[1:19:30] is a denominational Spirit oh sure you
[1:19:33] know religious spirit can make you think
[1:19:35] you're all right go to church say
[1:19:38] Amen go to the camps even trim your lamp
[1:19:42] I mean that's what my Bible said yeah
[1:19:44] there was 10 foolish and I mean five
[1:19:46] foolish and five wise and and the five
[1:19:49] foolish even trimmed their lamps but
[1:19:50] they didn't have any oil that's right we
[1:19:53] could be dressing right and acting right
[1:19:55] and going to the camps and mixing and
[1:19:57] mingling and going everywhere and we
[1:19:59] look all prim and proper and and I
[1:20:02] believe the message oh do
[1:20:04] you have you
[1:20:06] died have you died to that first husband
[1:20:09] have you died to that that first
[1:20:13] nature that's good look at the fruit in
[1:20:16] your

[1:20:23] at the fruit in your life oh my are you
[1:20:25] bringing forth oranges and tangerines
[1:20:28] and
[1:20:29] lemons is your life a mixed bag of
[1:20:32] fruit oh my are you kind of just grafted
[1:20:36] into the
[1:20:37] message bringing forth fruits of the
[1:20:40] message but you still have fruits of the
[1:20:43] flesh this isn't this is no in no way to
[1:20:47] condemn you this is to encourage you
[1:20:50] that's good that you can be bearing
[1:20:53] fruit of the word and all fruit of the
[1:20:56] word and you don't have to be bearing
[1:20:58] the fruit of the world you don't have to
[1:21:00] allow that old nature that carnal nature
[1:21:02] and the things of the world to be
[1:21:03] hanging on you you can be free from that
[1:21:06] but that first nature got to die look I
[1:21:08] don't want to be grafted in I want to be
[1:21:10] born into the message I want to be born
[1:21:12] again and filled with the Holy Ghost

[1:21:17] be a message believer and you're not
[1:21:19] bearing the fruit of the word and you're
[1:21:22] living contrary to the me message of the
[1:21:24] hour the prophet of God would say that's
[1:21:26] spiritual adultery you you're claiming
[1:21:28] to be married to the Lord Jesus Christ

[1:31:15] could we with with with that load of
[1:31:18] guilt or shame or as brother Brandon

[1:31:22] really what it means to be justified as
[1:31:24] though you never did it in the first
[1:31:26] place oh if you can allow the revelation
[1:31:29] of that this morning to strike your
[1:31:30] heart you never did it in the first
[1:31:34] place if that Revelation can strike your
[1:31:37] soul and you realize it's not based on
[1:31:40] your past it's not based on your
[1:31:42] failures it's based because he promised
[1:31:44] it and you never did it in the first
[1:31:46] place now you can make a step forward to
[1:31:49] believe for the impossible to believe
[1:31:52] for the change of your body yes you yes
[1:31:55] you you you're the one God predestinated
[1:31:57] you to manifest this message don't worry
[1:32:00] about those things you're Justified you
[1:32:02] never did in the first place but when
[1:32:03] you're always allowing the Devil try to
[1:32:06] bring up the past and try to point to
[1:32:08] your failures you're always there's
[1:32:10] always an unwillingness to step out on
[1:32:12] faith come

[1:32:45] privileges come on are we living in
[1:32:48] Earnest
[1:32:50] expectation for the translation of these
[1:32:53] bodies help us Lord
[1:32:56] Jesus as John the Baptist would begin
[1:32:59] preaching the prophet of God would say
[1:33:01] in the voice of the sign he would say
[1:33:04] that John who had the spirit of Elijah
[1:33:06] was a sign of Jesus coming he said it
[1:33:10] was a sign of
[1:33:14] preparation what did he start
[1:33:16] preaching
[1:33:18] repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at
[1:33:20] hand
[1:33:22] that's part of the preparation yeah
[1:33:24] that's
[1:33:25] right repent men and Brethren what what
[1:33:27] we do repent of your sins be baptized in
[1:33:31] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:33:32] you shall receive the gift of the Holy
[1:33:35] Ghost the formula is still the same it
[1:33:37] still works
[1:33:40] yes you've repented of your
[1:33:42] sins be
[1:33:44] baptized yeah we're we're still
[1:33:46] proclaiming the
[1:33:48] gospel we we still have the same message
[1:33:51] what was what was Jesus first message he
[1:33:53] started to declare was you must be born
[1:33:55] again that was his first
[1:33:57] Doctrine if we ever get to the place as
[1:33:59] a church or as a body where we stop
[1:34:01] preaching you must be born again we've
[1:34:02] missed it yeah that's right come on and
[1:34:06] alls we ever preach is doctor and
[1:34:08] message fundamentals and and where this
[1:34:10] group got it right and where we're right
[1:34:13] and and you know we you know what no you
[1:34:16] must be born again and then when you get
[1:34:19] the inside teacher
[1:34:22] when you get the tutor he'll lead you
[1:34:24] and guide you in all truth and
[1:34:26] righteousness but repentance the Kingdom
[1:34:28] of Heaven is at hand it was a message of
[1:34:32] preparation as Matthew 3 would say for
[1:34:35] this is he that was spoken by the
[1:34:37] prophet Isaiah saying the voice of one
[1:34:39] crying in the wilderness prepare ye the
[1:34:40] way of the Lord make his path straight
[1:34:43] look it's a voice of preparation this
[1:34:45] message is a voice of preparation to you
[1:34:48] yes it is right yes sir amen oh come on
[1:34:52] without it you don't even know how to
[1:34:55] prepare you don't even know what to get
[1:34:57] ready
[1:34:58] for you don't know how to get
[1:35:01] ready scripture says I John saw the New
[1:35:05] Jerusalem descending Out of Heaven as a
[1:35:07] bride adorned for her husband what was
[1:35:09] she adorned with she was adorned with
[1:35:12] the word with the revealed word with the
[1:35:14] third pool of the hour oh it was the
[1:35:16] message of the hour that has come to the
[1:35:18] bride to prepare you to meet the
[1:35:20] bridegroom in the air yes
[1:35:23] sir on the shout a message of
[1:35:26] preparation I like this word prepare if
[1:35:29] you you catch it out of uh uh uh uh the
[1:35:32] Greek or you look into the Lexicon it
[1:35:33] says to make ready to prepare to make
[1:35:36] the necessary preparations get
[1:35:38] everything ready yes figuratively drawn
[1:35:41] from the Oriental custom of sending on
[1:35:43] people uh before the King on their
[1:35:46] Journeys uh to level the roads and make
[1:35:48] them passable to prepare the minds of of
[1:35:51] men to give the Messiah a fit reception
[1:35:54] and a secure
[1:35:56] blessing oh now we're talking about
[1:35:59] being
[1:36:00] prepared behold the king cometh get
[1:36:04] everything out of the way make make the
[1:36:06] roads clear make imp passible is there
[1:36:09] anything that would hinder H the moving
[1:36:11] of the Holy Ghost Lord I want you to
[1:36:13] come father I want to get it all out of
[1:36:15] the way if there's any roadblocks if
[1:36:17] there's anything in my life that that's
[1:36:19] that's keeping me from going the in the
[1:36:21] King's Highway oh God come by the voice
[1:36:24] of Malachi 4 let's clear the roads let's
[1:36:27] make them passible that we might be able
[1:36:29] to give the Messiah a fit reception it's
[1:36:32] a voice of
[1:36:34] preparation oh
[1:36:39] yeah get ready Paul would say seeing we
[1:36:43] are compassion about such a great cloud
[1:36:45] of witness let us lay aside
[1:36:48] every weight and sin that so easily
[1:36:50] besets us
[1:36:52] and run with patience this race that is
[1:36:55] set before
[1:36:57] us I I like this meaning here patience
[1:37:00] it's the character characteristics of a
[1:37:02] man who is not
[1:37:04] swerved from his deliberate purpose and
[1:37:08] his loyalty to Faith and piety even the
[1:37:11] greatest Tri even through the greatest
[1:37:13] trials and sufferings thank you Lord
[1:37:15] we're running this with
[1:37:17] patience we're making the roads passable
[1:37:20] I'm not going to swerve to the right
[1:37:22] hand or to the left I'm not going to go
[1:37:23] on a
[1:37:25] detour I I hate detours that's right I
[1:37:28] don't know about you but I hate detours
[1:37:30] going out of the way because you missed
[1:37:31] your I did it on the way
[1:37:33] here I was on the phone and wanted to
[1:37:35] cut the back
[1:37:37] way I'm like okay well I missed my exit
[1:37:39] you know it's not too much farther go go
[1:37:41] up through uh Jonesboro and or come back
[1:37:45] through Walnut Ridge or whatever and
[1:37:47] then I'm talking to brother Ben and
[1:37:48] we're going to meet for lunch in Ash
[1:37:49] Flat and I'm like I knew I blew it
[1:37:53] so now I'm
[1:37:54] cutting through the sticks whining back
[1:37:58] and over through this that and the other
[1:38:00] trying to make up time why I missed my
[1:38:03] exit I was on a detour yeah come on I I
[1:38:07] I I had I had missed my turn because I
[1:38:09] wasn't following the
[1:38:11] instructions come
[1:38:14] on we we want to be like the scripture
[1:38:16] says I don't want to turn to the left or
[1:38:18] to the right I don't want to be
[1:38:19] distracted I want to stay the court
[1:38:22] course but you know detours aren't
[1:38:24] always a bad
[1:38:25] thing detours can be a very good thing
[1:38:28] yeah that's right especially if there
[1:38:30] ain't no
[1:38:32] Road sometimes we get frustrated oh man
[1:38:35] the road shut down well we can open it
[1:38:37] up you think you're going to make it
[1:38:39] through there it's only five feet of
[1:38:41] water and 10 feet of mud oh you know
[1:38:44] thanks for putting up the detour sign
[1:38:45] actually on second thought
[1:38:49] yeah and then when we do make a wrong
[1:38:51] turn or a left turn Lord graciously what
[1:38:55] son you're on a detour am but I gave you
[1:38:58] a
[1:38:59] promise I gave you Romans
[1:39:03] 8:28 at all
[1:39:05] things I love that promise I don't know
[1:39:07] about you but I rejoice in it you mean
[1:39:10] this all
[1:39:12] things you you mean the most wicked evil
[1:39:14] this or that all things right all things
[1:39:17] all
[1:39:18] things the devil tries to to start uh uh
[1:39:22] digging up that old man and all things
[1:39:25] no Lord you said that you work all
[1:39:27] things out for the good for those that
[1:39:29] are loved and called according to your
[1:39:32] purpose I'm so glad we don't have to do
[1:39:34] it on our own right oh thank you
[1:39:37] Lord no the Lord's not telling you you
[1:39:40] got to clear the road and you got to
[1:39:41] make it
[1:39:42] pass he's saying that I'm here to help
[1:39:45] you do it if if you want to do it if you
[1:39:47] want to get through that trial if you
[1:39:48] want to get through that storm if you
[1:39:50] want to get through that heartache that
[1:39:51] complex that besetting sin whatever it
[1:39:53] is I'm here you don't have to do it on
[1:39:55] your own maybe you've come to a
[1:39:57] roadblock maybe you need direction oh my
[1:40:00] well he's an everpresent help in the
[1:40:01] time of trouble yes he is Bible says
[1:40:04] call on the name of the Lord and you
[1:40:05] shall be
[1:40:07] saved yes sir what did he tell the
[1:40:09] Israel he said behold I send my angel
[1:40:11] before you he's going to keep you in the
[1:40:14] way he's going to make the way for you I
[1:40:17] think that's where we get ourselves in
[1:40:18] so much problem is is we try to do it
[1:40:20] all on our our
[1:40:21] own that's right we we get a little
[1:40:25] knowledge we get a little truth we get a
[1:40:26] little revelation we get a little bit of

[1:47:42] more we for the greatest treasure man
[1:47:45] has ever known
[1:47:47] yes I say it behooves us to start being
[1:47:50] prepared it behooves us to start being
[1:47:57] [Music]
[1:48:01] ready you know they have what they
[1:48:04] call preppers you ever heard of
[1:48:09] that I'm sure there's some around this
[1:48:11] area yes be a good area to come if
[1:48:14] you're a
[1:48:16] prepper kind of away from it
[1:48:18] all but what do they do they make all
[1:48:21] these
[1:48:22] preparations they say it's a social
[1:48:24] movement where they get all the canned
[1:48:25] goods and all the water and everything
[1:48:28] and they're going to be self-
[1:48:29] sustainable in case there's some uh
[1:48:31] National disaster or some crisis that
[1:48:33] happens but what are they doing they're
[1:48:35] they're
[1:48:36] preparing but you want to know what you
[1:48:38] what what I can appreciate about it
[1:48:41] you'll know a prepper when you see one
[1:48:43] yeah cuz they're
[1:48:45] prepared I don't most I'm just I'm just
[1:48:49] venturing out now but but most I don't
[1:48:50] think are halfway
[1:48:52] Preppers like no I'm I'm they're like
[1:48:54] I'm ready to I'm ready to weather out a
[1:48:56] nuclear Holocaust buddy let me show you
[1:48:59] my bunker man I got enough beans here to
[1:49:01] feed the Army for for 10
[1:49:04] years they're they're prepped and
[1:49:06] they're ready and they're prepared I say
[1:49:08] oh if we can see that in the natural I
[1:49:10] say oh God I want to start having that
[1:49:13] expectation that uh that preparation
[1:49:17] that Readiness in my spirit Lord that
[1:49:19] you're coming in any moment that I've
[1:49:21] cleared out the roads I've made them
[1:49:23] pass I've got all the Le out I've made
[1:49:25] everything right I've repented of my
[1:49:27] sins I've cried out for the Holy Ghost
[1:49:29] I've been baptized Lord here I am I'm in
[1:49:32] Earnest expectation that any moment and
[1:49:35] the twinkling of an eye I can be changed
[1:49:37] so I must be about the father's business
[1:49:40] the prophet of God said that John 5:19
[1:49:43] this harmony now exist the same Harmony
[1:49:46] that Jesus Christ had with the father
[1:49:48] now exist in the bride that you have
[1:49:51] thus sayith the Lord you know what he
[1:49:53] wants done with the word or you stand
[1:49:56] still why because the mind of Christ is
[1:49:58] in the
[1:50:00] bride and you're in a
[1:50:03] preparation oh thank you Lord oh my if
[1:50:06] we turn this
[1:50:08] corner we'll be eating dinner not lunch
[1:50:11] I'll ask the musicians to come and we'll
[1:50:13] find a place to to
[1:50:16] stop and provided way the prophet says
[1:50:19] so what if people are prepared in the
[1:50:22] wrong
[1:50:23] way what if soldiers went to the field
[1:50:26] not trained for
[1:50:27] battle but to go out and
[1:50:30] dance they might be ever so good
[1:50:34] dancers they've got to be trained to
[1:50:37] fight you might be ever so good a
[1:50:40] message
[1:50:41] believer you might be so ever able
[1:50:45] to have all the right
[1:50:48] answers oh yeah we become the
[1:50:51] theologians come on we can quote the
[1:50:53] quotes and we can quote the
[1:50:56] scriptures but where's the
[1:50:58] life Jesus where's the fruit where's the
[1:51:01] meekness where's the humility where's
[1:51:04] the
[1:51:06] patience oh
[1:51:07] [Music]
[1:51:09] God but to go out there and dance though
[1:51:11] they would ever be good dancers they've
[1:51:14] got to be trained to fight what if they
[1:51:16] went out there to some kind of affair
[1:51:18] and know not how to use their gun they
[1:51:22] would do little good so I think that the
[1:51:24] workers in the Harvest should be
[1:51:27] prepared to know how to train the people
[1:51:29] for the coming of the Lord for there's
[1:51:31] none of us but want wants to meet
[1:51:34] it that's right you
[1:51:37] know that's what Paul rebuked them as
[1:51:39] like you need to be teached when you
[1:51:41] should be
[1:51:44] teachers we've been in this too
[1:51:47] long we need to be able to now start
[1:51:49] taking taking others and properly
[1:51:51] teaching them and equipping them we
[1:51:53] ought to be out there in the Harvest
[1:51:55] workers of the Harvest we should be able
[1:51:57] to prepare others I want to get to the
[1:52:00] place where I'm prepared I'm sold out
[1:52:02] I'm so ready that that I I can now be
[1:52:05] that voice uh uh now living in me going
[1:52:08] out and and calling for hey the
[1:52:10] bridegroom's coming you need to repent
[1:52:12] oh oh let me let me share the gospel of
[1:52:14] the hour with you there's an overcoming
[1:52:16] power that God's given you you don't
[1:52:18] have to live the way you're living
[1:52:21] but if you're always on the
[1:52:23] defensive you're always just trying to
[1:52:25] overcome this or
[1:52:27] that you don't have to live like that
[1:52:30] anymore that's right maybe as they just
[1:52:33] start to play something I'm going to
[1:52:34] find a way to close
[1:52:37] but Ephesians says in 5:16 Redeeming the
[1:52:41] time because the days are
[1:52:43] evil we need to use our
[1:52:47] time Gathering up sanctification and
[1:52:50] Consecration and Oneness and
[1:52:53] unity we talked about the movements out
[1:52:56] there in the
[1:52:58] world those people are
[1:53:00] anointed they're sold out they're all
[1:53:03] in look at them they're marching down
[1:53:07] streets right I they're so sold out they
[1:53:11] make a fool of themselves they get flags
[1:53:13] and want and March for causes they're so
[1:53:15] anointed they don't even know what
[1:53:16] they're Marching for yeah that's right
[1:53:22] look at look at Israel and the condition
[1:53:24] of
[1:53:25] Israel yeah to think we're seeing the
[1:53:28] day and the
[1:53:30] hour
[1:53:32] where our nation and people in our
[1:53:34] nation are taking sides with
[1:53:39] murders I didn't I I mean I can't but
[1:53:44] the prophet said if this goes on for
[1:53:45] another 50 years the world will be
[1:53:47] totally
[1:53:48] insane that's right it's here insanity
[1:53:52] is here where people are Marching for
[1:53:55] people that murdered innocent babies and
[1:53:58] children and took hostages and killed
[1:53:59] them we got Governors and people in in
[1:54:02] in places in our
[1:54:06] nation that are taking sides with that
[1:54:11] yeah that's true but they've been
[1:54:12] anointed for
[1:54:14] it yeah but if they've been anointed for
[1:54:18] that
[1:54:20] that I say God has a bride on the earth
[1:54:23] yes sir if they're being an anointed for
[1:54:25] the tribulation come on God has a bride
