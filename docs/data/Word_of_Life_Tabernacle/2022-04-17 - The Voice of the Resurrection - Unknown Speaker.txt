sunday or to thank you for all of the many things that you've done for us we could begin now and never be able to end lord just telling the wonderful works of god lord in our own lives to keep us here to bring us here the fact that you raised the lord from the dead lord spoke of our resurrection from dead trespasses and and sins lord that we may be able to come to you we thank you for that today maybe lord there would be something in the in the hearts and minds of the people today that a need that would need to be met lord i pray god that you would meet that today lord you see each one that has come and you're able to address each life and and speak to every person in the way that only you can through your word i pray you'd move me out of the way today lord and do that lord may we give you the praise and the glory and the honor for it in jesus name amen amen you love him this morning isn't it good to be in church on easter sunday resurrection sunday to know that he is not here he is risen from the dead let's read that in matthew chapter 28 and verse 6 and then we'll also read romans 8 and 11 matthew 28 and 6 romans 8 and 11 and then first thessalonians 4 verse verses 15 through 17. matthew 28 6. you all pray for me this morning i um i just fall apart when my kids aren't here so but uh no but gabe's doing a good job back there but then i've got a little bit of allergies working on me the devil's done everything he can to keep us from having this service he did everything he could to keep jesus in the grave and he couldn't do it yes sir amen oh my he's done everything he can to keep you from this service today yes everything the devil could do he's done but he couldn't do it and the fact that you're here means you can receive something from him amen amen and give something to him is he worthy of our praise faith amen pray for my son and daughter as they come back from louisiana from camp and each one that would be traveling i know some are missing today because they're traveling and we're glad to have all of you visitors here with us today some of my family and different ones the white camp family different ones that are here today god bless you for being here and i pray that the service will be a blessing to you i'll have a dinner for those of you that want to stay right after the service at the fellowship hall we'll be glad to feed you as well uh natural food as well as spiritual food today and just one service today matthew 28 and 6 he is not here for he is risen as he has said come see the place where the lord lay and then romans 8 and 11. but if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up je christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you and then first thessalonians 4 15 is the promise of a resurrection of the dead at the end time it says for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first and then we which are alive and remain oh i hope to be alive and remain i believe i'll be alive and remain at that day yes shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord i pray the lord would add his blessing to the word you may be seated this morning when jesus died on the cross and rose from the dead on easter sunday early in the morning almost 2 000 years ago it was not an isolated event it was an event that was the culmination of everything that had been spoken of by the prophets everything that had been spoken of that had been shadowed in the law all of the things that had come before him all the great men of faith that had come that spoke of that event and it was speaking of something that would come that would be greater than a law that could only tell you what you did wrong but it actually spoke of a time that when we could be raised from our sins by the power of god that we could be born again that we could be new creatures in christ jesus and we know that when he died it was not an isolated event and that there was a resurrection of old testament event or saints at that time in matthew 27 verse 50 it says jesus when he had cried again notice with a loud voice he yielded up the ghost and behold the veil of the temple was rent and twain you're gonna have to help me this morning i'm just a little bit under the weather but god knows this morning amen amen aren't you glad to be in church this morning he said behold the veil of the temple was rent and twain from the top to the bottom the earth did quake and the rocks ran and the graves were open and many bodies of the saints which slept arose and came out of the graves after his resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared unto many remember joseph when he was down in egypt they carried his bones down to egypt or he died there in egypt and they he said don't leave my bones here he said i want them to be carried with you when you go into the land of promise and so 400 years later they carried those bones back into the promised land because he was waiting by the danny for this event that would take place and when jesus cried with a loud voice that the dead would begin to raise from their grave and paradise would be emptied and now here would come abraham and sarah here would come joseph here would come jacob all of the patriarchs would come up at that time and they would go into into another dimension now watch now what happened at that time that jesus was was here on the earth and he proved himself to be raised for 40 days and then in acts chapter 1 and verse 9 it says and when he had spoken these things while they beheld he was taken up yeah so there was a rapture of christ at that time an ascension he said in the cloud received him out of their sight so it speaks of that it speaks of of something now he wasn't done what he did is he went to become a mediator for you and i to become the lamb aren't you glad you have an advocate with the father john said if any man sin he has an advocate with the father we're not depending on our own good works to make it in but we're depending on the blood of the lamb that was shed on calvary and that advocate is before the father that advocate speaks for us and that body was there in heaven but his spirit came back remember the blood cell was broken on calvary and when the blood that come out of his body was broken when the spirit of that was released because the reason there had to be blood is because blood showed life had been given life is in the blood if you've got no blood in you you've got no life in you when the blood cell was broken on calvary the life come out of it and it came back 50 days later on the day of pentecost yes this earth right they went up in the upper room after he ascended and they waited for 10 days and at the end of that 10 days here come the holy spirit like cloven tongues of fire down on them and it was the literal life of jesus christ coming back on each and every one of the believers right and let me tell you this brother bannon put it this way he said what a resurrection that was but what a resurrection this is because now we have the literal life of christ back on the believer again so that you and i can live a life of resurrection not by our own merit not because of something we've done but because of something he did and that life comes back on us and it it ignites us to the word yes it quickens us to the word it makes us alive to the word yes sir so easter speaks of a future resurrection and then one day you say well i may go by way of the grave my parents went by way of the grave my loved ones went by way of the grave yes they may but one day there will come another resurrection those that are asleep in christ will raise and when they raise then it won't be long we which are alive and remain be caught up together with them to meet them in the air right now watch we are already quickened as christians today i trust that we are christians here today and if you're not you can be quickened by the new birth into the life of christ we're quickened and we will not be and i want you to catch this this morning we will not be part of that future resurrection yeah unless we are raised with him now and many times first thessalonians 4 i've stood at many graves and read that brother joe as a as a memorial or as it gives hope to people because he said comfort one another with these words and so i'll read that at the graveside and you believe that the person that went down is going to also come up yes right and it gives us hope that we know but see the person that went down went down believing in their mind and their heart and their life had been quickened to the word unless they were quick into the word before they went down they won't ever come up until the general resurrection of the dead to be judged but i don't want to be in that resurrection i don't want to be judged based on the deeds of my life and the works that i've done i want to be quick into the word now so that i don't have to pay for the things that i did when i lived in sin and did the things that i did i don't have to pay for that because christ took the penalty of my of my sin and through his death on the cross he quickens me to himself into his own life ephesians 2 1 and 1-7 tells us about it it says you hath he quickened yes quick and is simply to be made alive he has made you alive how many are alive this morning oh if you're alive there's movement amen if you're alive it does something to you it caused you to do the works of god you have to be quick and who were dead who were dead in trespasses and sins amen he said wherein in time past you walked according to the course of this world according in other words you did what everybody else does yes that's the way you used to live you said brother ben why do you live so different it's not because of some kind of a cult but in times past we we walked according to the course of this world but now according according to the course of god's word and so they walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience among whom also we all someone say all we all had our conversation that's lifestyle that's the way we lived all of us had our conversation in times past some of us could say amen to that this morning all of us have had our conversation in times past in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desire of the flesh and of the mind and we're by nature the children of wrath even as others but god yes yes oh there's the merciful part this morning oh don't you feel good on easter we can read the scripture that says but god who was rich who is rich in mercy for his great love we're with theeth loved us oh my aren't you glad that he loves you today even when we were dead in sins hath quickened notice half quickened us yes if you've been born again you have been quickened you will be raised but you are already raised on the inside and the inner man even when we were dead and sins hath quickened us together with christ by grace you are saved yes and hath raised us up together i want you to watch this this morning because he does not raise you up alone he does not raise you up for your own purposes that's right he does not raise you up to be separate from the church separate from the body of christ but he raised you up together if you've been quick and you've been raised up together yes to sit together somebody say together this morning he's raised you up together to sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus yes that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace oh you mean it's not all but oh i don't know how you feel but if if all that he ever showed me is what he's already shown me that's more than i ever deserved the moment i got saved brother jesus that's all that he'd ever done for me was save my soul from sin that's more than i ever deserved when i've been healed in my body if that's all he ever did for me was heal me in my body that's more than i ever deserved what about you this morning but he said in the ages to come he wants to show you the exceeding riches of his grace and his kindness toward us through christ jesus oh there's a great there's a great knowledge he wants to give you a great understanding of himself he wants to fellowship with you through endless ages how is he going to do that by fellowshipping with you now by the new birth yes hallelujah hallelujah now branham tells us the new birth is christ it's a revelation god has revealed to you this great mystery that's a new birth what what is that mystery it's the mystery of christ in you the hope of glory the mystery of him not the son of john and sharon pruitt even though i am in the flesh understand i have a higher calling i'm a son of god amen and so now it's revealed to you this great mystery and that's a new birth he said now what are you going to do when you get all that group together where have we been raised up together yes amen well it was a shout for by the steward to bring us the bride together right that's why the prophet told us the shot would bring a bride together what are you going to do when you get all that group together oh my i believe he could do great things this morning i believe he can meet your knees brother man i don't understand everything you're saying you don't have to understand you just have to reach out by faith and say lord i'm not reaching out to a preacher i'm not reaching out to someone else i'm reaching out to you lord yes i'm reaching out to you i believe by faith i can touch you today and if i have a need that need can be met today oh my yes what are you going to do when you get all that group together where the revelation is perfectly in harmony and god expressing it through his word but the same actions the same things that he did making the word manifest he said oh if the church only knew its position it will one day yes he said then the rapture will go when it knows what it is he doesn't say the rapture will come amen but the rapture will go why because you've already been raised so when it's rapture time you are the rapture amen the quickening power was already in the body of christ so when the body was dead but the quickening power quickened him to the word of his resurrection and he was raised from the dead so the quickening power is already in you i think i put a picture on there of an apple tree an apple tree is a it's an interesting thing because everything that's going to be in the apple tree is already in it i want you to think about this this morning yes sir yeah listen what you you it's not a our religion if we can put it that way our gospel is not a gospel of tomorrow right putting things off well one day i'll be okay i just mired in sin now but one day i'll be all right one day one day i'll be able to overcome one day i'll be able to do these things no it's a gospel that lives today because even if you're just a sapling if an apple tree is just a little cutting that you take and you plant it in the in the dirt when it's in the small added smallest form it already has in it everything that it will be right the instructions are hard coated in it of what it'll be yes amen everything that it will be is already on the inside of the apple tree then what does the apple tree have to do it's just a little bitty sprout but every bushel of apples every blossom every leaf that'll ever be on the trees on it right then what do you have to do with the tree you got to plant it yeah water it and then let it drink it has to drink now when the apple tree is small it drinks more than its portion because it's not going to stay small all right yeah are you with me this morning and that's how we receive the blessings of god we don't we're not intending to stay in the condition we're in now one of these days i won't have to worry about allergies one of these days i won't have to worry about a body like this one of these days i'm going to be everything that god meant for me to be yeah i didn't mean that not to worry about being fat god loves me even though i'm fat i saw that look on joel's face bless his heart you're gonna sit somewhere else but one one of these days i'm going to be something more or something less i'm going to be more what god wants me to be are you with me this morning one of these days i'm reaching for something else and so we're not planning on being what we are so we drink more than our portion right because when we drink more than our portion it swells out and begins to push out limbs and branches right and eventually fruit we're drinking more than what we are oh if you could only understand that don't just continue to be what you are you say brother ben i am what i am this is the way my family is this is the way i've always been treated this is what i've always been don't stay there but be what god wants you to be take the word of god and drink it in and as you drink of it as you partake of it then ask god lord help me to help me to not just read it but to become it and when you become it you actually push out and you begin to manifest what was in you all the time hallelujah oh my brother branham told us that divine healing the power of god and all those other things is in every individual in here let's receive the baptism of the holy ghost for you are planted in christ yes hallelujah the holy ghost baptism yes sir and everything you have needed for this life's journey even the rapture is right in you then yes oh hallelujah oh hallelujah the rapture is in us now he said i will prove it by the gospel those who he called he justified those who he justified he is glorified you look in the times and the seasons and seeing what russia is doing and seeing the wars and seeing the inflation and seeing the things that are coming on you say well it must be the end times but look we're not worried he said at the end time look up lift up your head for your redemption draweth now oh aren't you glad to be in a in a time like that your redemption the rapture is already in us yes oh my and we don't have to wait on anything to come it's already in us at the right time we'll go home now he said i'll prove it by the gospel those who he called he justified those who he justified he hath glorified he said then in heaven today we're glorified in the presence of god right now he says and i'm just pushing out to it so like the tree and more limbs are coming out more branches more fruit don't get discouraged by where you're at today as long as you're drinking right now if you're not drinking then there's nothing that you can do you'll shrivel up and die yeah but if you'll take it the water is there jesus stood up on that great day of the feast and he said if any man is thirsty yes yes let him come unto me and drink he said and out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water oh my aren't you glad for that water today yes and david tells us that the the christian that the believer would be planted like a tree by the rivers of water amen whose leaf never fades hallelujah now and i'll try not to hold you too long tonight so just be or this morning just bear with me it won't be tonight when we get out i promise but the key then to the rapture and resurrection is the new birth yeah right you've got to have the token if we could put it like that or the ticket to be able to go in the airplane to be able to go in the rapture by the death burial and resurrection of christ he's quickened us together with him we become his body on the earth we're quickened to the word brother and put it this way he said jesus body was quickened after it was dead and in the grave jesus body was quickened by the word of god and transformed from a dead cold image to a resurrected glorified son of god now what word was he was he quick and by about psalm 16 david spoke and said for thou will not leave my soul in hell neither will thou suffer thy holy one to see corruption right one scripture is written about the resurrection and jesus read that scripture right because he was the son of god like us he read the old testament where it said that he read david's writing i will not suffer that holy one to see corruption and the word was quickened to him hallelujah by the spirit that was in it and when his spirit with his went down into hell and preached to the souls in prison which were told by the scriptures that he did for three days and he comes back up to pick up that body he raised by believing the very word that was already written because he was already quick and to it yes oh my he said that word is to has to come to pass do you realize how powerful it would be if you and i could be quickened today to the word that he says i am the god that healeth all thy diseases yes if you can be quick into that word today i can repeat it to you you can hear it but if you could have the holy spirit settle it down in your heart you could say i'm healed no matter what the symptoms say no matter what anybody else says i'm healed oh my no matter what temptation you might go through if you could if you could if that word could be quicker to you he that believeth on me shall not perish but have everlasting life if you believe on him that word is quickened to you and it becomes alive are you with me now it could raise you up out of whatever it is in your life that keeps you back yeah do you believe that this morning and if you believe in it it's quickened to you then you've got to plant it in your heart and it'll raise you as it raised him he said that word has to come to pass it's god's word plant it in your heart if you want to go in a rapture if you want to be genuine christians place this word he said told ezekiel god said take that scroll and eat it up and he said that the prophet and the word would become the same and every promise in there has to manifest itself because it's god's original he said don't let you let some educated theologian out here try to pump it out of you yeah oh we can stop there a while don't you let him spray you with that carnal science and knowledge in education you don't get it by education he wasn't raised because of what school he went to he was raised because the quickening power was in it who am i in it quicken him to the word you're not raised because you were raised in the message it has nothing to do with it because you believe a certain doctrine or go to a certain church has nothing to do with it or how much how many novenas you say or how many how many uh rosary beads that you rub or how many tapes you listen to it doesn't matter yeah right has nothing whatsoever to do with the new birth yeah it only it can only it's it's word it's the true word but it can only be quickened by the holy spirit yes sir and if it's not quick and you won't raise if it is quicken you will raise are you with me this morning yes sir that's it that's what we were taught now and that's what we we have to believe if we believe the word now he said don't let somebody talk you out of that some theologian talks you out of that try to pump it out of you yes be quick and by the word it's the holy ghost that does that for you now he said we haven't joined nothing or bargained for nothing the christian life is not a bargain god if you'll give me peace in my marriage i'll give you so much of this that's not what it's about if you'll give me a wife or a husband i'll i'll give you this i'll pay my tithes lord i'll i'll go to church yeah it's not a bargain you don't make a bargain with god lord if you take this desire to smoke to drink to run around in adultery commit adultery if you take that away from me then i'll i'll i'll i'll live for you and i'll i'll go to church and i'll do certain things no you don't make a bargain with god we don't join nothing we don't bargain for nothing that's not how you were born into this world think about it for a minute you didn't join nothing yeah you they didn't make you sign up because you know maybe some of our kids wouldn't have signed up to be in our families if they'd known they would if you made them sign a letter of intent you know like to do in college find a letter of intent to be born yeah well that that's never going to happen in the family we just cease to be you know they never they never bargained for nothing never joined nothing it's not like okay i'll be born if if you provide me with a good home and have good clothes no at the time appointed the baby gets to the right size and it's born that's what happens when you're born into the kingdom of god at the appointed time whenever god has appointed to call you into his kingdom because no man can come to god god no man looks for god god seeks man right he's seeking you this morning you're not you thought it was you looking for him he's looking for you yeah and so at the right time he comes to you you don't get to bargain with him well i'll keep so much of the world and i'll keep this and that you don't get to bargain with him you come to him and say lord i surrender everything that i am i give everything that i have i i'm crucifying myself paul says i am crucified with christ therefore i live right not i but christ liveth in me yes amen unless you die with him you'll never be raised with him we haven't joined nothing or bargained for nothing we just believe lord to eternal life and you sealed us in there by the baptism of the holy ghost and quickened our bodies and quickened our spirits and quickened us then to see visions and prophesy speak in tongues see great signs and wonders take place see those things are the after effects we don't we don't we don't say that those things are something we work up in the church that's the after effects of it what we want is the quickening power right right but the after effects is speaking in tongues visions prophecy all these other things and see great signs and wonders takes place he said why it's the living god we're into that body when to the world is foolishness to them that perish but to we who believe it's the power of god unto eternal life we thank before father he's praying he said now let it be known this day lord that you're god that you've never changed your mind about one word that you've ever said do you believe that today yes amen you've never changed one word about that you've that you've ever said you're the same yesterday and forever and the one and only way that god has provided the only man ever god put his name in was his own son who carried his name jesus god jehovah savior emmanuel the door to the sheepfold do you believe he is today amen he that was which is and shall come the root and offspring of david amen the morning star the lily of the valley wonderful counselor i say it said prince of peace mighty father the mighty god everlasting father amen and then that one when you're baptized into his name into his body you're baptized you're not baptized by water that's a symbol of what we believe in water baptism in the name of jesus christ but that's a symbol of something yes it's a symbol of the burial of being buried in a cold grave being raised in newness of life but one spirit you're baptized into his body it's the new birth that quickens you to the word yes now let me just kind of dwell on this for a moment and we'll move on because there's somewhere i want to go this morning and probably too late already but we'll just close when it's time to close now look if you've been quick into hebrews 10 25 if you're writing this down maybe write down these scriptures i don't have time to go to all of them but if you've been quick into hebrews 10 25 you go to church jesus was quickened to quicken two psalms where david said i'll not leave my your soul in hell or suffer my holy one to seek corruption and he raised what is hebrews 10 25 he said don't forsake the assembling of yourselves together if you don't do that you're not quickened i don't care how spiritual you are yeah you're just not quick into the word yeah i don't mean you're a bad person right yeah but you need to be quick into the word right you need to do birth yeah that's why it's so hard for you to live a christian life if you don't do what the word says you're not quickened yeah do it he said but i gave my heart to jesus i've been baptizing christian baptism yes i believe that i believe you're in a stage of justification you might even be in a stage of sanctification trying to make your life right but if your heart ever gets quickened by the holy spirit to the word you will do what the word says yes not because somebody gets up here and yells at you to do it and i can sit here and tell you do what the word says it won't do you a bit of good yeah you can listen to every tape that there is read every bible go into every commentary you can find watch every television preacher and he can explain to you just just what it is and everything about it until it's quicken to you you'll never believe it you'll never be able to receive it you'll never be able to live it yes sir but once it's quickened to you you can live it yeah not because you have to but because you want to yes sir you don't have to tell somebody to go to church if they've been quick until hebrews 10 25. right if you've been quick into exodus 15 26 mark 16 and 18. that's going to get good here in a minute james 5 and 14. you believe you're healed yes but i'm sick this morning i got things going through my body if you've been quick into the word you believe i'm already healed amen then you can call for the elders of the church and anoint you with oil in the name of the lord because that's what the word says to do and we take the oil and anoint you there's no there's no supernatural power in the oil but it's the quickening power inside of you all the holy spirit we're just doing what the bible says and the quickening power comes on you and you are quick into exodus 15 26 i'm the god that healeth all thy diseases mark 16 and 18 amen james 5 14 call for the elders of the church and the prayer of faith will save the sick yes yes hallelujah if you've been quick into malachi 4 you know elijah has come yes if you're quickened to luke 17 and 30 you've seen a son of man ministry if you've been quick in the first corinthians 12 28 and ephesians 4 11 you'll be under a pastor and believe in the five-fold ministry right right it's the word if you've been quick into first corinthians 15 51 and first thessalonians 4 17 here's where i'm going today church if that life if that same spirit that dwells in love in him dwells in you it will also quicken your mortal body to the scriptures that was spoken about you for the age that you live in amen it won't quicken you to build an ark because that's not that hey man that's the word but it's not the word for the hour but the quickening power will quicken you for the word to the hour hey man it'll quicken you the first thessalonians 4 17. yes we which are alive and remain yes hallelujah it'll quicken you to first corinthians 15 51 where he says we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye at the last round you've been quick into that brother jt so it doesn't matter how much longer it is it doesn't matter how many days you might have to worry it doesn't matter how bad your body gets listen abraham was quickened to the word he said you'll have a son abraham and he was quick into that word and for 25 years he walked the walk of faith and it didn't matter what happened to him during that 25 years yes yes oh my if we could ever get a revelation of that church well people have done me wrong the church has done me wrong i just can't do it no nonsense you've never met the el shaddai you've never met the giver of life that could you can nurse on his breast and he'd give you strength to be able to make it yes i just can't seem to do it yeah the quickening power yeah i'm preaching to you this morning it's all quick and power and on my own i hope you can hear it today yes i pray that i would hear it today in in a real way in a fresh way why do people not believe the word why do they not live the word not because we haven't said it in the right way yeah not because well so-and-so wasn't good to them so they you know they can't be saved now yeah they had a bad experience at church one day so they can't be saved right they they were hurt by people i was hurt by people lots of people have been hurt by people jesus was hurt by people yeah they put nails in his hands yeah 39 stripes on his back he was hurt by us yeah yeah that's right you see the the soldier that drove the nails in his hands brother danny was my representative he represented me and they drove his nails in his hands and he laid there on a cross he hung there on a cross for my sins my representatives put him there my rebellion my sin but his love hallelujah his love not only caused him to go to the cross but caused him to raise up from the dead when we could not limit what the laws we read do you wednesday night could not do and that was weak to the flesh god sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and forth sin condemned sin in the flesh that's the gospel yes it's not self-help it's not struggling and and oh everything today is all about oh if we get you coach you enough and get you into enough classes give you a position in the church nonsense you've got to be born again you'll find your place in the house of god if you're born again but the brown said the word if you're predestined you see it there's no way to hide it from you you look there and say why it's just so plain before my face i look at it there it is i'm looking right at it i see it here it is the word every word this word by word living out he said then there's a taste of eternal life that you want you've got to hold the bible says taste and see that the lord is good there's a taste of eternal life that you want you went to church and said man there's something about it i don't understand it but there's something about it you read your bible there's something about that something that's real everything around me is fake everything in this world today is fake fake friends fake media fake news fake politics everything's fake but i see something real in the hearts of the people i see something real in their lives i see something real in the holy ghost i see something real in the move of the spirit i see something real in my bible i see something real in the message of the hour and you see that and you begin to say lord i got a taste for it you begin to want it yeah he said then there's a taste of eternal life that you want it's god's filter and when you breathe through that nothing can get through that but the holy ghost right he said no you got the evidence of the holy ghost see a holy man or a woman's taste he said they want to live they got eternal life and because this word is quickened to them they live a thinking man's filter in a holy man's taste listen jesus said because i live you will live also we know that each age as we're going down now we're 2 000 years later many things have happened since the resurrection of christ that every age was quick into the portion of the word for their day but they could not be quick unto the fullness of it because the fullness of the word had not yet come but we live in the day when the fullness of the word is here god's only provided a plan for his age his son's in the word age quickened by the spirit he said like a spark i know i'm moving fast but i'm trying to get you somewhere this morning get you out of here on time he said like a spark that's lit off something to make it alive and seated now in heavenly places in present tense already alive and subject to every promise right oh hallelujah i'm subject to the promise of the word i don't worry about it if i'm subject to the promise see i'm subject to i'm a subject of this nation i pay taxes it could be a good or bad thing depending on who you are and how much you make some of y'all just pay taxes didn't you i can see by the look on your face my money goes out monday when you pay taxes what does that make you subject to the nation right but think about it you get on the roads you drive down the road you don't think about it if there's a pothole there you're like man they wish to use my taxes better but most of the time you expect it to be there you get aggravated if it's not you walk in your house and you don't sit there oh i wonder if it'll turn on today all right walk over to the to the light said oh i wonder oh is it going to happen and you flip this oh praise god it happened but then you walk in you turn every time i walk into church i come in if i'm the first one here and i usually am i'll turn the lights on and i don't ever think about it i just expect it to work i'm subject to us hey man i'm subject to a country that has electricity when i was in africa i remember being in togo and every day the lights would go out because the warlord who leads that country the dictator was actually shutting off the electricity in his country and giving it to another country that didn't have it selling it for money putting it in his own pocket so every day you had to not be make sure not to be in an elevator i got where i wouldn't take elevators because i was afraid you'd be in the elevator when the lights went out every day the lights go out because they're subject to that dictator but we live in a country where we expect the lights to work right we live in a country where we expect there'd be a revolution if we didn't have electricity you know we we care about those things but what about the word of god amen when he says i'm the god that heals all your diseases and you get sick do you expect it to work when he says i'll lead you and guide you through life and you have a difficult decision to make do you expect him to do it he'll do it if you ask him it may not be in some great great thing where you're struck down off of your horse like paul on the road to damascus but maybe a still small voice that speaks to your heart it says here's what to do you belong in the house of god you belong with the saints of god what does that do he said you're alive and subject to every promise in the word what does that do you being a part of god seeing a part of the word other men are part of god's word seated together seated together manifest the entire body of christ because there's no leaven among you leaven among you just the word only he said seated in heavenly places in the door in other words no additives to what you are just the word in the door where he put his name christ jesus no leaven among you it brings the entire fullness of the godhead bodily among you he said it couldn't do it in luther's age couldn't do it in wesley's age couldn't do it in the pentecostal age but in the day when the son of man will be manifested revealed what is that luke 17 30. he said brought back the church together with the entire deity of god amongst his people you can't tell me there's anything that god can't do today there's nothing that god can't do he said but my case my situation my kids my my family look where they're at there is nothing but the danny that god can't do today why we're living in the word age we're living in the fullness of the word when he's done what he promised to do hey man we're not looking for it to come we're living in that time he's brought the back to church together with the entire deity of god amongst his people showing the same visible signs manifesting himself like he did at the beginning when he was manifested on earth in the form of a prophet god that was jesus christ he said oh glory promised by malachi 4 promised by the rest of the scriptures where do you worship at the house of god seated in present tense yes christ has been resurrected and i have been resurrected with him and listen there will come a day when the dead will be raised yeah now remember can i give you a few more minutes you know i always feel bad for the people that don't want to stay a few more minutes but when a preacher asks you that it doesn't mean anything right but we'll let you go in a minute oh watch i know you're wanting to eat i want to eat too and look somebody i don't even tell about that but sure if i tell about that they'll get them forget to i got a secret food secret food over there praise god no one but those who were in the in the mystery under hidden in the mystery know it now i at least get a tithing off of it me and brother stewart now everybody's thinking what in the world now the the brother branham says that there was remember there was a shout voice and trumpet remember the scripture we read to you i got to get back on track if you've noticed the thing that distracts me the most is food my wife's learned that if i'm upset or you know in a kind of a bad mood she's learned to distract me with food that's why i'm the way i am so there was a shout voice and a trumpet that's the way paul said that was the order of the rapture the shout and voice of trump we talked about the shout the shout was a message together the people together were gathered together now seated now in heavenly places in christ jesus but the romans said the second is the voice of the resurrection the same voice a loud voice in saint john 11 38-44 that called lazarus from the grave let's go to john and let's look at john and we'll go back up to verse 20 john 11 and 20 and look at that scripture before we close it says then martha as soon as she heard that jesus was coming went and met him but mary sat still in the house then said martha unto jesus lord if thou hast been here my brother had not died now remember this is at the tomb of lazarus and brother branham said this would be the same voice would be the voice of jesus he spoke with a loud voice he said lazarus come forth the same voice that would be at the rapture martha said to jesus lord if thou hast been here my brother had not died what faith that is but i know that even now whatsoever thou would ask of god god will give it to thee yes she hadn't given up and he'd been dead for four days she didn't give up when he got sick she didn't give up when jesus didn't come are you hearing me now she didn't get up when she was waiting give up when she was waiting she didn't give up when all jesus was coming she didn't give up when he got there she said i believe that if you'd have been here he wouldn't have died but i know that even now whatever you ask god oh hallelujah god will give it to thee yes sir notice whatever you ask god god will give it to thee what was it she said the right thing i want to show you a woman in our our day and hour that did the same thing there's a woman by the name of hattie wright and hattie wright was a real person not just a story that we tell and there's some pictures i think on the next slide that here she had two boys that didn't serve the lord and those are the two boys and that's a picture of them being baptized and many of you know the story but hattie wright is there and brother branham was telling the story about how god moved in a supernatural way and spoke and he was able to speak and things would come to pass and and things would happen and it seems almost incredible to to the human mind to be able to even even hear it and then when he when he says it and he's telling the story to her there was a little widow woman out in the out in the sticks didn't have no money didn't have nothing she says this she said it's nothing but the truth and when she does what happens is she does the same thing she enters into the same place that martha was in now jesus wasn't there in a literal body but he was there in the form of brother brown let me shock you today jesus is still here brother branham was a part of the bride and he was the messenger to the age but he didn't when he left god didn't leave yeah come on yeah so jesus is listening today when you come to the tomb amen when you come to the hardest part of your life when you come to the moment when there's no hope when you get to the place where there's no there's no future for you right you hear the word of god maybe in a sermon like this and you just say it's nothing but the truth yeah right and he said whatever you ask for god will give it to you that's right she had a crippled sister she had other things she could have asked for money which she needed desperately but she said i want the salvation of my two children yes my two boys and brother branham said this he talked about how even the angels are filthy in the sight of god how could we as human beings ever come to god and speak and ask something and get it but jesus said if you ask in my name i'll give it to you that's what he said i didn't say that he said that and he said a woman that said the right thing caused the heart of jehovah to say ask her what she wants yeah and then give it to her he said it's incredible but true yeah oh my he said you know why the plutocrats didn't get it or the big folks like that because god knew they'd ask things that was no good for them watch mary said lord whatever you ask martha rather said lord whatever you ask it'll be done but she waited right and when the time was right he spoke and the lazarus was raised now watch we think a spoken word is well one day we're going to be able to just speak and have such faith that food will be spoken onto our table now that would be miraculous but i can also go and shoot a deer well some of y'all can i'd have to buy a gun somebody i'll take a bow and shoot a deer and go out put food on the table but there's nothing i can do about my new body think about it yeah that's what i need my children come back from youth camp today these children sitting up here young people i think about them and sitting all through the audience they've got a lot of little kids little bitty kids i get to thinking about them i think i can't even save them i can't make them christians i can't make my own children christians yeah i can't do that i can provide for them i can put food on the table i can teach them i can set them in the right way which we're commanded to do our kids don't get choices about whether or not they want to go to church we're commanded by the scripture to train up your child in the way it should go i mean set it in the right path yes but i can do that i can't save them but he can yes so i feel like martha or maybe hattie wright couldn't do nothing about my boys every teenager they can do what they want oh but she said i want the salvation of my two children yes i feel like martha i can't do nothing about lazarus being in it too but you can lord yes and she said that before that he had ever raised from the dead how much more would he do it today oh my i can't do anything about it but you can lord i can't put myself in a rapture he can yes but how's he going to do it how did he do it through hattie wright he said speak whatever you want hey man they even asked brother branham in the questions and answers i don't have time to read it to you but they asked him if he could speak and the body change would take place and he answered that he had the authority but it was sovereignly given who did he give it to yes oh church john 11 23 jesus saith and her thy brother shall rise again martha said unto him i know it shall rise again in the resurrection of the last day jesus said unto her i am the resurrection but matthew mcgarry touches on this last week and when he was preaching he didn't know what i was going to be preaching on today but he touched on this he said unto her i am the resurrection amen jesus presence is the rapture being present yes i hope you understand what's happened in this day when the word came down when the word became present among us it was more than a man it was like john pointing to a man i must decrease but he must increase here comes the man behold the lamb of god who takes away the sins of the world and so i've got to look at him and realize he is the resurrection yeah are you sorrowful today maybe you've lost loved ones and i know several of you have lost loved ones recently you put them in the grave too young but jesus says yeah i am the resurrection in the life yes he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live yes and whosoever liveth and believeth me shall never die he said believe us how this she saith unto him yay lord i believe that thou art the christ the son of god which will come into the world when she had so said she went away and called mary her sister secretly now notice what she did saying the master has come and called us for thee as soon as she heard that she rose quickly and came unto him notice mary without martha could not be made perfect if we could say it that way could not come to jesus because she hadn't heard that he was there she hadn't heard oh my you're going to have to read between the lines this morning i've got to move on now jesus was not yet coming to the town but was in that place where martha met him remember when isaac came for a rebecca or when rebecca came to isaac and followed the messenger's message she met him in the field remember he left the tent and rebecca went to meet him but the brandon said remember jesus will leave the kingdom will not meet him in glory where to meet him in the air he said where to meet him in the air between heavens and earth where it's expanded to redeem us and he met rebecca in the middle between her home and his home took her into his home and married her and fell heir to everything his father had amen john 11 38 jesus therefore again groaning in himself coming to the grave it was a cave remember we preached a couple weeks ago he was a man in his human flesh he was human he felt the pain and the loss that they felt lazarus was his friend and so he come groaning in himself he comes to the grave it was a cave and a stone lay upon it jesus said take you away the stone marth and martha the sister of him that was dead saith in him lord by this time he stinketh this is an incredible thing you've asked us to do by this time he stinketh he'd been dead four days i mean you don't even go around road kills been dead four days and the bigger the body is the more it stinks that's just the truth in this in this human in this flesh there's got to be something more church if all there is is this flesh we're as paul said of all men most miserable because i'll be honest with you if there is no resurrection of the dead if there is no afterlife if there's no heaven i wish i didn't know we didn't know what anything i wish it was an animal right because knowing is just torture if all there is is living and dying but in knowing why did god give us the gift to be able to reason to know because there's something more yes right there's got to be something more and and so she said by this time he stinks but this time that's the way of all bodies they decay but jesus said the nurse said i not unto thee that if thou would just believe thou should have see the glory of god hallelujah then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid and jesus lifted up his eyes said father i thank thee that thou hast heard me and i know that thou hearst me always but because of the people which stand by i said it that they may believe that thou hast sent me and when thus he had thus spoken he cried with a loud voice lazarus come forth and listen now the what did that jesus in god in human form spoke in the dead race who happened again in his resurrection when he cried with a loud voice here come the dead out of the graves about it at the end time in whatever form he's in listen to me when the time of the resurrection comes that's the form he speaks in think deeply about that what form is he going to be in i'll tell you what form he's in today rather than answer that question maybe that's a little bit too deep for us this morning but let's answer this question what form is he in today this yes right not just here but all of us yeah right he's in his body the church the bride right right and he that was dead came forth bound hand and foot with grave clothes his face was bound with a napkin well he was a strange creature come out of there can you imagine you know he hopped out yeah he couldn't walk all right his hand and feet are bound he comes hopping out of the grave what do you raise me for well i'm going to show something with you you know lazarus before lazarus he had to die again we're going to be raised one day and not have to die again amen and so jesus said loose him and let him go listen in the voice of the resurrection is the same voice the voice of christ and brother branham tells us he said your voice is when you speak through us yes who am i you say well why can't i just say it today listen it's like how do you write you can't say it until the inspiration strikes right that's what brother branham tried to tell him they said couldn't you do it brother branham he said if it was right he said if abraham lincoln was dead in the grave if the time was right inspiration struck i could do it but i can only do what i'm anointed to do oh i hope you hear me today your voice is when you speak through us speaking to christ praying he said if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you said will come to pass you can have what you said when you pray believe what you receive what you ask for it shall be given unto you oh god such promises if you abide in me and my word about you ask what you will it was hattie wright's voice that brought her two sons yes not brother branham's it was hattie writes because it was her two sons yes i hope you're hearing me today what do you have need of this morning yes amen the voice of the resurrection speaks from your lips i think if we understood that this morning we could we could go out of here happy people yeah right what do you have need of one day when you need a new body when the time is right there there'll come a new body the voice of the resurrection when your loved ones need to be raised oh my yeah he said well i gosh do that if you doubt it because it's you if i told you brother branham would do it you'd believe it come on now come on if i told you that jesus and his flesh would do it you believe it you doubt it because it's you how will he speak who will he speak through lips of the living bride all right hallelujah amen he used the lips of william branham how was the shout brought to the lips of a man yeah how does he speak what is the voice of the resurrection but the brandon taught us that the church once spoke for god you uh musicians go ahead and come i'm never gonna quit if you don't the church once spoke for god dark ages wesley and luther and brother brown said the people who took his revelation from god become the living epistles read and known of all men for their generation when the methodist failed he talked about the lutherans and the methodists when they felt god raised up others so it has gone on through the years until in this last day there is again another people in the land under their messenger will be the final voice to the final age he says the members of the virgin bride will love him they will have his potentials what are his potentials he lives yes what are my potentials brother joe i'm going to live yes because he lives i live also he was raised from the dead amen aren't you glad that he was right amen all power belongs to him they have his potentials he is their head all power belongs to him they are subject to him as the members of our bodies are subject to our heads amen he goes on to talk about the harmony between the father and the son he said nothing can harm her not even death but the seed be planted the water will raise it up again do you believe it today church can you see it is it more than just words i know i've moved fast through this but is there something on the inside of you that speaks and said lord i believe hell found my unbelief i believe there's something inside of me i believe that i have the mind of christ i believe i know i've been quick into the word amen the pride has the mind of christ for she knows what he wants done with the word she performs the command of the word in his name for she has thus saith the lord and the word is quickened by the spirit and it come to pass like a seed that is planted in water it comes to full harvest serving its purpose those in the bride do only his will no one can make them do otherwise yes right oh church you can only realize that you quit blaming others yes it's everybody else's fault my wife's fault it's my husband's fault no it's it's god in you those in the bride do only his will what is his will he said i don't know what his will is it's right here they have thus saith the lord or they keep still they know that it has to be god in them doing the works fulfilling his own word he did not complete all his work while in his earthly ministry so now he works in and through the bride she knows that for it's not yet time for him to do certain things listen it was not time for him to do certain things that he must now do what's left yeah we're not talking about just being a church on the earth because that's been here before but there's something left to do that he must now do that he couldn't do in the flesh he healed the sick he raised the dead but there's coming a general resurrection and he's going to do something through you somehow you're going to have a part in that i can't explain all of that but somehow you becoming the word in your hour is a part of that general resurrection you being the voice of god in the last days he said he will now fulfill through the bride that work but she left for this specific time listen to me and say play something softly whatever's left it's your job to do it remember i told you last week i believe it was the week before that brother branham's part was identified in 1st thessalonians 4 16 because it says that it says that we which are alive and remain will not hinder those which are asleep all right brother branham went by way of the grave he was the messenger brought the shout to us and it was he went by way of the grave but somebody's got to fulfill first thessalonians 4 17 we which are alive and remain now paul says we because he believed it would be him i believe it'll be me may not be maybe my children my grandchildren maybe someone else [Music] but i believe it'll be me but whatever is left it's our job to do it brother branham said the only time i can preach is when i'm mortal he said as i am now i can only preach as long as i'm mortal i whatever's left whatever job is for me to do whatever i can be quick into the word is mine to do and only the holy ghost can quicken my life to the word he said brother ben i don't understand that you go to acts 2 38 and peter brought the prescription for that this is how the the spirit quickens your life peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins listen i got we got water today if you've never been baptized in the name of jesus christ following the command of scripture we can put water in there we can eat and the water will fill up and afterwards we can baptize you at some point this afternoon when the water fills up we'll be glad to do it if you've never been baptized maybe you have been baptized but you've never received the holy ghost but he said you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost what is the problem what's keeping you from receiving the holy ghost it's got to be that you haven't surrendered yourself to god you've just never given yourself over to god and that's evidence in your life when you when you stubbornly do things you know is wrong i'm talking to you sincerely today this is easter time it's a happy time it's a resurrection time but you've got to be quickened with him now or you can't be quickened with him over there you'll never be raised with him if you haven't been quickened with him now you can't speak the word you can't be the voice of the resurrection unless you have been raised from your tomb unbelief peter said you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost would you bow your heads with me maybe there's someone here as i feel the presence of the lord here this morning maybe there's someone here that you've never really been quickened by the word i'm not talking about just maybe raise your hands and accepted christ or maybe you've been baptized but you've never been quickened by the word and every eye is closed every head is bowed looking around you've never been quickened and you know that and part of surrendering is knowing that and coming to it you're not going to be able to talk your way into being a better person you're not going to be able to educate yourself and you're not going to be able blaming others is a poor strategy because pretty soon other people get tired of it you've never raised from your dead trespasses and sins would you raise your hand today would you raise your hand and just say brother ben would you pray for me this easter would be the time god bless that hand this easter would be the time that i could be raised i've heard the truth i know what's right but god sees your hand god bless you is there another that would say for the man i've struggled with these things i've struggled i know what the word says but i have a hard time doing it you just want to raise your hand and say lord help me today i want to be raised in the newness of life amen amen let's pray for those who raise their hands heavenly father lord jesus it was just one lord you you left the 90 and 9 to come to one lord but there's more than one here today they need to be raised they want to be raised or there's something in in their hearts maybe even one here that didn't raise their hand lord there's something working art inside of their life they know they're not right you know they're not and me telling it to them won't do any good but maybe by the anointing of your spirit you can move in their life and help them lord or somehow you just come down and you tell them all about what it is to be a christian i pray you granted lord lord i pray you'd baptize them with the holy ghost today if they've not been baptized in water may they be quick to go to the water and be baptized in the name of jesus christ lord and if they've never received the holy ghost may they receive it today lord may you may you quicken them to the word until they look at the scripture and they'd see everything that you say to do and they just do it there there'd be a desire in their heart to go to church to be with god's people to love you with all of their heart i pray that you do it today for them we know many times lord it's not some great thing but even the act of raising a hand lord is an act of surrender you defy gravity by doing that and it causes a person to be surrendered to you i pray you'd do it today lord i pray for those of us who have the holy ghost today who've been quickened by your spirit i pray you'd refill us today i pray there'd be an infilling of the holy ghost in this place lord know it may not be lord as usual when everybody's here and it's just the same crowd but lord may it be the day when we're gathered together lord you knew who would be here and who wouldn't be and we pray god that those who are gathered together those that are watching on the streams this morning lord would just receive a fresh baptism of the holy ghost lord that you begin to fall down on them lord like you did those in the upper room on the day of pentecost that their lives would be transformed to your word if we've gotten cold lord if we have a lack of diligence in our life towards the word would you come and change us oh god may we be raised lord may we be raised today so that we can be raised on that day so that we can be the voice of the resurrection may we be the voice of the resurrection in our families the voice of the resurrection to our wives our children husbands those lord that you put in our our care may we be the voice of the resurrection lord may we speak truthful things godly things loving things i pray you've granted today thank you for all that you do thank you lord we commit lord these hands that went up are these people today the hearts and souls and minds of these people we
