[12:11] When I look
[12:13] upon his face,
[12:16] the one who saved me by his grace.
[12:21] When he takes me by the hand and leads
[12:27] me through the promised land.
[12:32] What a day,
[12:34] glorious day

[14:49] day? Amen. Let's sing that song. My hope
[14:52] is in the Lord. We'll start with a
[14:54] verse.
[14:56] My hope is in the Lord. We'll start with
[14:58] the first verse.
[15:02] I stand in all within the presence of
[15:08] the Lord.
[15:10] In whom the wisdom of the ages
[15:15] lie.
[15:18] For whom the raging of the sea
[15:23] subside.
[15:26] the living sacrifice.
[15:34] Oh my hope
[15:38] is in the Lord
[15:42] from this day on
[15:46] and ever more.
[15:49] Oh my hope
[15:53] is in the Lord
[15:58] forever
[15:59] more.
[16:04] His
[16:05] tender mercies come with every rising
[16:11] sun
[16:13] to lead the sinner and his brokenness
[16:21] to offer healing and forgiveness.
[16:26] [Music]
[16:29] Those who trust in him find their hearts
[16:35] at rest.
[16:37] My hope
[16:40] is in the Lord.
[16:44] From this day on
[16:48] and ever more.
[16:52] Oh, my hope
[16:56] is in the Lord
[17:00] forever
[17:02] more.
[17:04] Yes, my hope.
[17:07] It is in the Lord.
[17:11] From this day on
[17:15] and never more.
[17:19] Oh my hope,
[17:23] it is in the Lord.
[17:26] And let's just lift our hands. We sing
[17:28] that to him again.
[17:30] Yes, my hope.
[17:34] It is in the Lord.
[17:38] From this time on
[17:42] and ever more.
[17:46] Oh my hope,
[17:50] it is in the Lord
[17:54] forever
[17:56] more.
[17:58] Can we give the Lord a hand clap of
[17:59] praise?

[19:50] Oh, praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Why
[19:54] don't you turn around and greet your
[19:55] neighbor in the name of the Lord?

[26:13] from above.

[26:39] Jesus shed on Calary.
[26:45] Those

[27:29] Amen. Are you thankful for the blood
[27:30] this morning? Amen. We just wanted to
[27:33] let everybody know um we do have a life
[27:35] back um for anybody that gets choked on
[27:38] something. It'll be in the back video
[27:39] room back there. And then we got several
[27:42] nurses here. So, let's let them use it
[27:44] first and then we can jump in. Amen. But
[27:47] just remember that in the back if you
[27:48] have an accident or anything like that,
[27:50] there's a life back there um on kind of
[27:54] the little rack there that you can see.
[27:55] So,
[28:02] [Music]
[28:28] Crossing the calm sea with Jesus.
[28:34] The disciples were getting concerned.
[28:40] The wind started violently blowing
[28:46] that he was asleep at the stern.
[28:52] Does he not care that we perish?
[28:57] We're helpless and we're so afraid.
[29:04] Jesus arose when they called him and he
[29:09] asked them, "Where is your faith?"
[29:14] Because you prayed
[29:18] all night
[29:20] and you've held on with all of your
[29:24] mind.
[29:26] Child of your Christ
[29:28] [Music]

[30:07] The storm of your life had begun.
[30:13] Seeing no hope in the distance.
[30:18] You're frightened with nowhere to run.
[30:24] By now your vessel is filling
[30:30] and you're thinking that you'll surely
[30:33] drown.
[30:36] You cried out for help from the Savior.
[30:41] And you know you can't give up now
[30:47] because you pray
[30:51] all night
[30:53] &gt;&gt; and you held on with your mind.
[30:58] Child, your eyes
[31:02] have awoken.
[31:05] The master.
[31:10] Oh, he knows
[31:14] your voice.

[31:21] child. Your cry

[31:43] might.
[31:45] Child, your eyes

[32:39] morning? Amen. Let's sing that song.
[32:44] He knows my name.
[32:46] Amen. K of I have a father.
[32:49] Amen.
[32:53] I have a maker
[32:57] [Music]
[33:00] before my heart.
[33:07] Before
[33:09] even time began,
[33:13] my life was in
[33:16] his hands.
[33:18] [Music]
[33:21] He knows my name.
[33:28] He knows my every thought.
[33:33] [Music]
[33:35] He sees
[33:37] each tear that falls.
[33:41] Hears me when I call.
[33:49] I have a father.
[33:56] He calls me his own.
[34:03] He'll never
[34:05] leave me.
[34:09] No matter where I go,
[34:17] he knows my name.
[34:24] He knows my every thought.
[34:31] He sees
[34:32] each tear that falls
[34:36] and hears me win the course again.
[34:41] Oh,
[34:44] he knows my name.
[34:51] He knows my every thought.
[34:58] He sees each tear that falls
[35:04] and hears me when I call.
[35:11] Amen. He thankful we have a father that
[35:13] listens to us. Amen. Let's sing this
[35:16] song. Amen. Just before we ask brother
[35:18] Joel to come this morning, I pledge
[35:20] allegiance to the lamb.
[35:24] Amen.
[35:26] I have heard how Christians
[35:31] long ago
[35:34] they were brought before
[35:38] a tyrant's throne.
[35:41] They were told that he would spare their
[35:46] lives
[35:48] if they would renounce
[35:52] the name of Christ.
[35:56] But one by one
[35:59] they chose to die.
[36:03] The son of God
[36:06] they would not deny.
[36:10] Like a great angelic
[36:13] choir
[36:15] sings.
[36:16] I can almost
[36:19] hear
[36:20] their voicees
[36:22] ring. I pledge
[36:26] alance
[36:28] to the lamb.
[36:31] With all my strength, with all I am, I
[36:38] will seek to honor
[36:42] his command.
[36:44] I pledge
[36:46] allegiance
[36:48] to
[36:52] the lamb.
[36:55] And now the years have come
[36:59] and the years have gone,
[37:02] but the cause of Jesus
[37:06] still goes on.
[37:09] And now our time has come to count the
[37:15] cost, to reject this world, to embrace
[37:22] the cross.
[37:24] So one by one let us live our lives
[37:30] for the one who died
[37:34] to give us life
[37:37] till the trumpet
[37:39] sounds on that final
[37:43] day. Let us proudly
[37:46] stand and boldly
[37:50] say, I pledge allegiance
[37:55] to the Lamb.
[37:58] With all my strength, with all I am, I
[38:05] will seek to honor
[38:09] his command. And let's stand together as
[38:13] we sing that chorus. Once again, can we
[38:15] just lift our hands to him in worship?
[38:18] Oh, I pledge
[38:21] alce
[38:23] to the lamb. With all my strength, with
[38:30] all I am, I will seek to honor
[38:37] his command.
[38:40] I pledge alce
[38:44] to
[38:47] the lamb.
[38:51] Amen. As we invite brother Joel to come,
[38:53] let's sing that song. I just want to
[38:55] please the Lord. As we invite Brother
[38:57] Joel to come this morning, just pull on
[38:59] the gift of God. We know that he's more
[39:01] than able to meet our needs this morning
[39:04] if we just surrender to him. Oh, I just
[39:09] want to please
[39:11] the Lord,
[39:16] be in his will in every way.
[39:22] To be lost in his presence,
[39:27] found in his likeness.
[39:30] To hear him say, "Well done."
[39:34] someday.
[39:36] Oh, I just want to please
[39:42] the Lord.
[39:46] Be in his will in every way.
[39:51] To be lost in his presence,
[39:56] be found in his likeness.
[40:00] To hear him say, "Well done." If that's
[40:03] your desire this morning, let me hear
[40:05] you sing it. Oh, I just want to please
[40:11] the Lord.
[40:15] Be in his will in every way.
[40:21] To be lost in his presence,
[40:26] found in his likeness.
[40:29] to hear him say, "Well done." Amen. That
[40:33] sounds good. Let's sing it to him again.
[40:35] Oh,
[40:37] I just want to please
[40:40] the Lord.
[40:45] Be in his will in every way.
[40:51] To be lost in his presence.
[40:57] It's like this to hear him say, "Well
[41:01] done."
[41:03] If that's your desire, sing it one more
[41:05] time. Singing, "I just want to please
[41:11] you, Lord.
[41:15] Be in his will in every way.
[41:19] [Music]
[41:21] to be lost in his presence,
[41:26] found in his likeness,
[41:29] to hear him say, "Well done."
[41:33] Someday.
[41:35] Is that your desire this morning to hear
[41:38] him say, "Well done." It will be worth
[41:41] it all when we see Jesus. Every every
[41:44] trial, every battle, everything we go
[41:46] through, it will be worth it all. Let us
[41:49] bow our heads for just a moment. But if
[41:50] you have a special need on your heart,
[41:51] would you just make it known by an
[41:52] uplifted hand? Heavenly Father, as we
[41:55] approach your throne of grace once again
[41:57] this morning, Lord, we don't come here
[42:00] boastful of anything we've done to merit
[42:02] the grace of God, but Lord, we're
[42:03] thankful for what you've done for us.
[42:05] Lord, we're thankful for another chance
[42:07] to stand in your presence and to Lord to
[42:10] to lay down everything that would try to
[42:12] hinder us from a blessing this morning.
[42:14] Everything that would try to stop us
[42:16] from a move of God in our service. Lord,
[42:18] I pray that you would just move
[42:19] everything aside and may we just come
[42:22] boldly before your throne now, Lord,
[42:24] with Lord with love and grace and
[42:26] thanksgiving in our hearts. And I pray,
[42:28] Lord, for every person in the building
[42:29] this morning, everyone that's here,
[42:31] everyone that's not here, Lord, that
[42:33] couldn't be here. I pray, Lord, that you
[42:34] would go to where they are right now and
[42:36] just raise them up, Lord, and and Lord,
[42:38] give them what they have need of this
[42:39] morning. I pray, Lord, that you would
[42:41] just move me out of the way and speak
[42:42] words of life to this the congregation
[42:44] in front of me this morning. Lord, I ask
[42:46] you would just move in a special way,
[42:48] Lord. Lord, if there's anyone here that
[42:50] needs the Holy Ghost, Lord, anyone that
[42:51] needs a refilling, anyone here that
[42:53] needs healing this morning, we know that
[42:54] you're still God and you change not. And
[42:57] we're thankful, Lord, for what we know
[42:58] you're going to do this morning and we
[43:00] believe it. And we just want to thank
[43:01] you for all these things in Jesus name.
[43:04] Amen. And the church said,
[43:06] &gt;&gt; "Amen." How many's happy to be in church
[43:08] on a Sunday morning?
[43:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. We just want to uh just thank the
[43:11] Lord for for allowing us to be together
[43:13] again. Uh, I want to uh welcome our
[43:16] visitors here. Uh, brother uh Brandon
[43:18] and Sister Charity, is that right? From
[43:19] West Plains. Good to have you all here
[43:21] this morning. Give our visitors a nice
[43:22] hand of welcome.
[43:25] You all appreciate you. I hope you feel
[43:27] right at home. I mean, if you have your
[43:29] Bibles, let's turn to Psalms chapter 85
[43:31] and verse 4. Psalms 85 and verse4. How
[43:35] many loves the Lord this morning?
[43:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. We just want to invite him to come
[43:39] and and uh if he can come, he can do the
[43:41] impossible. Amen. And if we're trying to
[43:43] do it on our own, we would sure enough
[43:45] fail. Brother Danny, but if he can show
[43:47] up, we can we can have church. How
[43:48] many's ready to have church this
[43:50] morning? Amen. Brother Ben is there in
[43:52] Oklahoma. Uh just continue to remember
[43:54] him in prayer. He's over he's uh
[43:56] recovering. He looked like yesterday he
[43:58] was finally feeling a little better uh
[43:59] after the uh teeth extraction there. But
[44:02] uh but I think he was he was feeling a
[44:04] little better yesterday. So that was
[44:06] good. The services were good. If you had
[44:07] a chance to watch them, they were they
[44:09] were having a real good time there in
[44:10] Oklahoma at the meetings. And uh so we
[44:12] just want to just remember them in
[44:14] prayer. They're having another service
[44:15] that started just about right now this
[44:16] morning. So just continue to remember
[44:18] them. Psalms chapter 85 and verse4. And
[44:21] if I could title this this morning, it
[44:23] would be revive us again that the people
[44:26] may rejoice. And Psalms 85 and verse 4
[44:29] reads like this. Turn us, oh God, of our
[44:32] salvation, and cause thine anger toward
[44:34] us to cease. Wilt thou be angry with us
[44:37] forever? Wilt thou draw out thine anger
[44:40] to all generations? Wilt thou not revive
[44:42] us again that thy people may rejoice in
[44:45] thee? Show us thy mercy, O Lord, and
[44:47] grant us thy salvation. I will hear what
[44:50] God the Lord will speak, for he will
[44:52] speak peace unto his people and to his
[44:54] saints, but let them not turn again to
[44:57] folly. And may the Lord add his
[44:59] blessings to the world. You may be
[45:00] seated this morning. I'll start this
[45:03] timer before I quit. Brother Stewart,
[45:06] Brother Stewart will be speaking for us
[45:07] this evening in the evening service. So
[45:09] So just remember him in prayer as well.
[45:11] Amen. So if we could just get into this
[45:13] this morning. I I I had this thought
[45:15] come on my heart and you pray for me.
[45:17] I'm a little tired. We drove back from
[45:18] Oklahoma last night and and uh you know
[45:21] services in a meeting are never short
[45:22] and so you get wore out a little bit.
[45:24] But I I was thinking this morning I I
[45:26] thought about revival and I thought
[45:28] about uh you know everybody's everybody
[45:30] wants revival. Everybody wants a revival
[45:33] and I would say everyone needs a
[45:34] revival. Amen. But what we have is a
[45:37] word revival. And what we have in this
[45:40] hour, I believe we are in revival. I'll
[45:42] just go ahead and say it now before we
[45:44] even get to it. I believe we're in
[45:45] revival. Amen. But we need to know what
[45:47] our revival is. And we also need to know
[45:50] that we've got a part in revival. Amen.
[45:53] It's not good enough to want a revival,
[45:55] but we've got to know what revival is
[45:56] when it shows up. Can you say amen? And
[45:58] it's also not good enough to say, "Well,
[46:00] Amen. Revive us, Lord. Revive us. Revive
[46:02] us. And then, and then when he does give
[46:04] us the blessings, we've got to thank God
[46:06] for when he sends the blessings to us.
[46:08] Can you say amen? Amen. So, so David
[46:11] here, he says, "Wilt thou not revive us
[46:13] again that thy people may rejoice in
[46:15] thee?" And so, when you get revived, I
[46:17] think it's time to rejoice.
[46:19] &gt;&gt; Can the church say, "Amen." Amen. So,
[46:21] it's not good enough just to get
[46:22] revival, but when he shows up, Amen.
[46:24] Let's go ahead and just acknowledge he's
[46:26] here. Amen. And rejoice in the Lord.
[46:28] Rejoice in the Lord always. And again I
[46:30] say rejoice. And so brother Brandon
[46:33] would go on here and and and he said uh
[46:36] uh he goes on down here if I can get to
[46:37] this first one. He says now remember
[46:38] correctly each generation has its own
[46:40] revival. Amen. It gets a chance at the
[46:43] word. So we know that the word is not an
[46:45] the revival that we are in is not an
[46:48] emotional revival. Amen. Because uh
[46:50] emotions can be uh can be caused by a
[46:52] lot of things. It could be caused amen
[46:54] by the hogs losing yesterday or it could
[46:56] be caused uh by a whole lot whole lot of
[46:58] things. and and and you know emotions
[47:00] are are part of humanity. Emotions are
[47:03] not always bad, but sometimes they are
[47:05] bad. Amen. Sometimes emotions can lead
[47:08] you astray. And sometimes uh and yet I
[47:11] would say that if you don't have an
[47:12] emotion with your religion, Amen. A
[47:14] prophet would tell us to bury that.
[47:16] Amen. So emotion is not bad, but it
[47:18] depends on what the emotion is making
[47:20] you do. Amen. So we're not driven by
[47:22] emotion. We're not pulled by emotion.
[47:24] Amen. Emotion is not what vindicates
[47:26] that we're having revival. Can you say
[47:28] amen? Amen. But emotion may accompany
[47:30] the revival. Amen. There may be gifts of
[47:32] the spirit and and speaking in tongues.
[47:34] And there may be there may be all kinds
[47:36] of evidences of revival. Amen. But that
[47:38] does not necessarily mean that you're in
[47:40] a real revival. Amen. Because a false
[47:42] revival, a false light can produce those
[47:45] things. Can you say amen? So many times
[47:48] we'll see, Amen. There's a lot of
[47:50] churches say, "I'm in revival. I'm in
[47:52] revival." And we're growing. We're
[47:53] growing bigger every year, bigger
[47:54] numbers. And and we thank the Lord for
[47:56] growing in numbers. Amen. But that is
[47:58] not revival. Can you say amen? Amen. You
[48:01] can you can have the biggest church in
[48:02] town. Amen. And be dead as 12:00. You
[48:04] can be you can have the biggest church
[48:06] in the country and say, "Well, I I I
[48:08] know God is here and I mean I know I
[48:10] know we've got we got more people. Look,
[48:12] you know, the Bible says where the
[48:13] carcass is, the eagles will be
[48:14] gathered." But I want you to notice
[48:16] that. Amen. Not everybody's eagles. And
[48:18] so, not everybody's gathered around the
[48:20] carcass. Some people are drawn by
[48:22] different things. Amen. But to the
[48:24] bride, you are attracted by the word.
[48:27] Can you say amen? Amen. And so the
[48:29] revival is the word that has been opened
[48:32] to you. Amen. And then the people can
[48:34] rejoice. Can you say amen? Amen. The
[48:37] people will rejoice over the word. Amen.
[48:39] It's not good enough to rejoice, amen,
[48:41] over just having a good song. It's not
[48:43] good enough to rejoice even over
[48:45] healings because amen. Many will come in
[48:47] my in that day and say, "Have not I done
[48:49] this and have not I done that?" Amen.
[48:50] There's healings in all kinds of
[48:52] denominations and we thank God for
[48:53] healings. Amen. But you'll get sick
[48:55] again. Amen. But this word revival that
[48:57] has been put into the bride is a not
[48:59] it's not a revival of of of death, but
[49:02] it is a revival that is an eternal
[49:04] revival. Can you say amen? I mean,
[49:06] there's been revival of uh re revival
[49:08] cycles rather. Amen. Of revival and
[49:10] death and revival and death and after
[49:12] the death would come another revival.
[49:13] But in this day, there will be no death
[49:16] to this revival.
[49:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. because it wasn't built on man's
[49:20] emotion. It wasn't built on man's ideas.
[49:23] Amen. But it was actually built, Amen.
[49:25] It was actually built on the word, the
[49:28] vindicated word. Are you still with me
[49:29] this morning? And we're just going to
[49:31] get right on down in here. I want you to
[49:32] go to Genesis chapter 2 and verses 15.
[49:35] Genesis 2 and 15. And it says, "And the
[49:38] Lord God took the man and put him into
[49:41] the Garden of Eden to dress it and to
[49:42] keep it. And the Lord God commanded the
[49:45] man, saying, of every tree of the
[49:46] garden, thou mayest freely eat." He
[49:48] said, "But of the tree of the knowledge
[49:50] of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of
[49:53] it. For in the days that thou eatest
[49:55] thereof, thou shalt surely die." I want
[49:58] you to notice they were trading the
[50:00] word. They were trading the very thing
[50:02] that God had placed them in. Amen.
[50:04] Perfection itself. They were trading it
[50:06] for knowledge. Amen. They wanted
[50:08] knowledge. They wanted to be smarter.
[50:10] They wanted to be wiser. Amen. But but
[50:11] but I want you to notice that that in
[50:13] that there was not enough. That that was
[50:16] actually death. And we'll see all down
[50:18] through the ages, you'll see a you'll
[50:20] see a group of people and they'll get on
[50:22] fire for God, but then they they want
[50:24] more knowledge and they want to be the
[50:25] better class of people and the next
[50:27] thing you know, they leave the word and
[50:29] go following after other things and it
[50:31] causes death. You say, "Why? Why am I
[50:34] not in revival?" Maybe because you
[50:36] haven't followed after the word that has
[50:38] been presented to you.
[50:40] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen. So, we don't
[50:41] want to trade We don't want to trade our
[50:43] revival, the word revival. Amen. for for
[50:46] the knowledge and the and the things
[50:48] that the world would try to take us
[50:50] into. Now there is a cycle through every
[50:53] generation. You can go back into the Old
[50:54] Testament and the New Testament. You can
[50:56] find where there has always been a re a
[50:59] cycle not a recycle but a cycle of of
[51:02] revival and death. There's always been
[51:05] that. I mean, you can look into the you
[51:06] can look in the Old Testament and you
[51:08] can see when God would raise up a
[51:10] prophet and then the people wanted a
[51:12] king and the next thing you know they
[51:13] would go uphouring after other gods and
[51:15] the revival fires would die out and God
[51:18] would leave them and they would go into
[51:19] captivity. Amen. But as long as they
[51:21] were walking under the under the
[51:22] influence of the pillar of fire and in
[51:24] the walk walking in the light of the
[51:26] word according to the message that had
[51:28] been given them and allotted to that
[51:30] age, amen, there would be no death. They
[51:31] could defeat every devil. I want you to
[51:33] know there's power in the word of God.
[51:35] Amen. There's power in this message. So
[51:37] you don't I hope you're with me here
[51:39] this morning. Amen. There's so much
[51:41] power in it that you think, well, if I
[51:43] went like this or if I did this or or my
[51:45] idea, you know, if my idea is so great
[51:47] that maybe this would work. Listen,
[51:49] church. Amen. We're not uphouring after
[51:51] other gods. We don't want another god.
[51:53] Amen. We don't want another fashion or
[51:55] another form. But what we have is the
[51:57] revealed word of God in our hour. And if
[51:59] we'll follow after that, amen, there's a
[52:01] power behind it. There's a strength in
[52:03] this pride. There's an authority on the
[52:05] inside of you. Can you say amen? Amen.
[52:07] Brother Brandon would go on like this
[52:09] and he would say, "A revival is not
[52:11] bringing in new members, but but is to
[52:13] revive what you have." Amen. So you
[52:15] could have a full church and not be in
[52:17] revival. Or it could just be you and
[52:19] Jesus and there could be revival. Can
[52:20] you say amen? Amen. So numbers does not
[52:23] numbers does not equal revival. Amen.
[52:25] The biggest meeting does not equal
[52:27] revival. Are you still with me? Amen.
[52:28] That that's not what it is at all. And
[52:30] he would go on to say it like this. He
[52:32] said, "Did you ever see the sea have a
[52:34] revival?" Sure, when it goes to leaping
[52:36] and jumping and the waves are beating,
[52:38] there's not one drop of water more in it
[52:39] than it was when it was perfectly quiet.
[52:41] But it's got a revival. And I want you
[52:43] to notice when you've got a revival,
[52:45] when the word is there and it has been
[52:47] quickened to your heart. Amen. There's
[52:49] going to be some noise. And there's
[52:50] going to be some rejoicing. Can you say,
[52:52] "Amen." Amen. He He's revived you. And
[52:55] so there will be some rejoicing. There
[52:56] will be some emotion behind it. Amen.
[52:58] said, "Don't just follow the emotion,
[53:01] follow the word."
[53:03] &gt;&gt; Are you still with me? He said, "It
[53:05] throw," He said, "Revival throws all the
[53:07] trash up on the shore." He said, "That's
[53:08] what it does, and that's what the church
[53:10] needs tonight." I say, "Lord, I need
[53:12] that tonight in me." He said, "It's a
[53:14] revival to throw all the nonsense out of
[53:16] it and throw it out on the shore so they
[53:17] can get back to the gospel solid
[53:19] foundation." And the church said,
[53:21] "Amen." Amen. And I want you to notice
[53:23] now as we see the things that have
[53:25] happened through our past week in the
[53:26] country. Amen. The the the the world is
[53:29] is saying we need a revival. The the
[53:31] America would say, you know, there's
[53:33] many people would say we need a revival
[53:34] in America. And I would agree with that.
[53:37] But the problem is America as a whole
[53:39] has rejected revival.
[53:42] &gt;&gt; They've rejected it. And so that's why
[53:45] and it would go totally insane. And
[53:46] that's why you see men taking other
[53:48] men's lives. And that's why you see the
[53:50] nonsense that we have in the news today
[53:52] of taking out a man that would try to
[53:54] stand for gospel teaching. Listen, he
[53:56] was standing for all that he knew. You
[53:57] say, "Well, I I'll just go ahead and
[53:59] tell you right now, I I I'd take that
[54:01] man over o over anybody else because at
[54:04] least he stood for what he believed in."
[54:05] What about us? What about you? You've
[54:08] got the revealed word of God. Amen. And
[54:10] you you say, "Well, I don't want to be
[54:11] under persecution." You're going to be
[54:13] under persecution. The church has always
[54:15] been under persecution.
[54:19] You go with the mainstream and you won't
[54:20] be under any persecution. But you also
[54:22] Amen. You also ain't going to make a
[54:24] rapture.
[54:25] &gt;&gt; You you say, "Well, if you trade, you
[54:27] say you say, "I want to save my life,
[54:28] and I don't want to I don't want to make
[54:29] a stand for the gospel." Amen. If you
[54:31] try to save your life, you'll sure lose
[54:33] it. Amen. But if you'll give your life
[54:34] for the gospel, if you're not ashamed of
[54:36] me, then neither will my father be
[54:38] ashamed of you.
[54:40] I I tell you church, when I see a man
[54:42] give his life for something, amen, that
[54:44] that that's not even the revealed word
[54:45] of God, I say, "What about me?" I say,
[54:47] "What about the bride of Jesus Christ?"
[54:49] When a man could give his life and don't
[54:51] even know, amen, the mysteries that have
[54:53] been open and the and the gifts that
[54:54] have been given to the church, but what
[54:56] about the bride of Jesus Christ? I say,
[54:58] "Lord, let me be courageous. Let me be
[55:00] strong in this hour. Let me give
[55:02] everything for the gospel of Jesus
[55:04] Christ." Amen. Because I am not ashamed
[55:06] of this gospel. I'm not ashamed of it.
[55:10] Amen. If you're ashamed of it, brother,
[55:11] you need to find your place at the
[55:13] altar. If you're ashamed of the gospel
[55:15] of Christ, amen, you need to get back to
[55:17] back in touch with God again. Amen.
[55:19] Because listen, we are not ashamed.
[55:21] Because if you're ashamed this morning,
[55:23] it shows what's on the inside of you.
[55:25] Amen. But I am unashamed that God has
[55:28] saved me. I'm unashamed that God has
[55:30] given me the Holy Ghost. I'm unashamed
[55:32] that God has given us a vindicated
[55:33] message in this hour. I am not ashamed.
[55:36] and I'll stand for it if it cost me my
[55:38] life.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I don't want to give my
[55:41] life. I don't want Well, listen, church.
[55:43] I mean, this is just a this is just a
[55:44] temporary body anyway." Amen. But but
[55:46] but you've got something better waiting
[55:48] for you. Amen. If they take you out with
[55:50] a bullet or if they take you out Come
[55:52] on, church. Amen. This is just a
[55:53] temporary dwelling place. This is just a
[55:55] place of of insecurities and failures
[55:58] and and learning to walk by faith. Amen.
[56:00] But where we're going, that's what we're
[56:02] all striving for anyway. You say,
[56:04] "Brother Joel, listen. and I don't want
[56:06] to give up. I don't want to give up my
[56:07] life. I've got a family. Listen, you
[56:09] know, God has given you the family and
[56:11] God has taken things away from you.
[56:13] God's given you everything you've got.
[56:14] But I want you to know, he's the same
[56:16] one that's already prepared another body
[56:17] for you. He's the same one that is going
[56:20] to raise you up again in the last day.
[56:22] Though the skin worms destroy this
[56:24] flesh, yet I shall see God.
[56:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe there's a group of
[56:28] people here tonight, this morning, amen,
[56:30] that can see God in his word. because
[56:32] his word is not just a dead letter, but
[56:34] it is a word that is a living word. What
[56:36] can you say, man? And so, if I I just
[56:39] want to say this and and we'll get off
[56:41] of that subject, but if a man will give
[56:42] his life for the gospel of Jesus Christ
[56:45] and maybe not understand even what the
[56:47] gospel of Jesus Christ is, what about
[56:49] you?
[56:50] &gt;&gt; What about me? It stirred my heart. I
[56:53] say the church needs a revival. I know
[56:54] it's over for the world, but we need a
[56:56] revival here in Hardy, Arkansas.
[56:59] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. And what is
[57:01] it going to take to get a revival? Yes,
[57:02] sir.
[57:03] &gt;&gt; It's not going to take just showing up
[57:05] at church and mailing in every service.
[57:09] &gt;&gt; It's not going to take It's going to
[57:10] take sacrifice.
[57:13] &gt;&gt; It's going to take sacrifice. It's going
[57:15] to take sacrifice of praise. I don't
[57:16] feel like praising. It's going to take
[57:18] sacrifice of praise. Amen. When the Holy
[57:20] Ghost comes upon you, Amen. He's
[57:21] reviving you. That is the Holy Ghost
[57:23] doing something for you. Then it's time
[57:25] to rejoice.
[57:26] &gt;&gt; It's time to rejoice. Amen. Revive us
[57:29] again.
[57:30] that we may rejoice.
[57:33] &gt;&gt; Are you still with me this morning?
[57:36] &gt;&gt; He said, "Thus sayaith the Lord, it'll
[57:38] be over for the world. She'll never come
[57:40] back again. She's gone. She's been
[57:42] gone." I want you to notice Brother
[57:45] Brandham actually stood. He stood there
[57:48] and he said he indicted the United
[57:50] States of America because they rejected
[57:52] God. You say, "Well, they just they
[57:54] rejected Brother Brandham." No, they
[57:55] rejected revival in in in every form
[57:58] &gt;&gt; because I want you to notice they
[57:59] weren't just rejecting William Brandham
[58:01] at that time. There was all kinds of
[58:02] revivals. There was revival worldwide
[58:05] revival. There was there was men of God
[58:07] that brother Brandham, they were friends
[58:08] of his, but and many of them got started
[58:10] in the ministry because of him. Amen.
[58:12] But there was TL Osborne and AA Allen
[58:14] and Oral Roberts and all these men that
[58:16] were preaching the gospel everywhere.
[58:18] And I want you to notice something.
[58:19] Amen. That that that the world didn't
[58:21] just reject Brother Brandon, but they
[58:23] started rejecting those men as well.
[58:24] Amen. Because it was the effect of
[58:26] revival in the land. I want you to
[58:29] notice it wasn't the revival, but it was
[58:31] the the effect of revival. They could
[58:33] feel the embers burning in the land.
[58:36] They could feel revival fires because
[58:39] the word was going forth in that season.
[58:42] And so it was anointing the earth.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; Are you still with me? That's what
[58:46] brother Brandon would teach. And and I
[58:48] want you to notice that that that's
[58:49] biblical. there would be a there was
[58:51] always be a warning before there comes
[58:53] judgment. There would be a a great
[58:55] sweeping across the land before there
[58:57] would ever come judgment. Are you still
[58:59] with me? And so God sent his messengers
[59:02] and he talked about Billy Graham and
[59:04] Oral Robert actually preaching to the to
[59:06] to the to the to Sodom and going in and
[59:08] preaching the gospel. And he said
[59:10] preaching and he said there was none
[59:12] better doing it in the land. And he said
[59:14] Billy Graham was preaching, you know,
[59:15] salvation to the people. And Oral
[59:17] Roberts was the Pentecostal man that was
[59:19] going and and showing that the healing
[59:21] power was there. Amen. But there was
[59:23] another man that I want you to get to
[59:25] this morning that actually was producing
[59:27] the revival. And that was a man that
[59:29] wasn't promoting himself. He was not
[59:31] promoting his own ministry, but he was
[59:33] promoting a word that was being open to
[59:35] the people. And when the people could
[59:37] see the open book, Amen. then they could
[59:39] find their name in the book. Well, come
[59:41] on, somebody. And when they saw their
[59:43] name in the book, amen, then they could
[59:45] rejoice in revival. Amen. It may look
[59:47] like Pentecost to some people. It may
[59:49] look like fanaticism to other people,
[59:51] but it is the revival produced by the
[59:54] opening of the word.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; You say the opening of the word is just
[59:58] a phrase. No, it is actually your
[59:59] revival.
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; The opening of the word is our revival.
[1:00:03] Are you still with me? And so he said,
[1:00:05] "Brother and sister, that's why you hear
[1:00:07] me cutting it as hard as I can. The
[1:00:09] American revival is over. It ended some
[1:00:11] time back. He said, "There's no more
[1:00:13] revival in America. We're only gleaning
[1:00:15] in the fields that's already been reaped
[1:00:16] and burned over." So the fires and and
[1:00:19] and the the the the um the revival went
[1:00:21] forth and it burned over the entire
[1:00:23] nation, but now we're just gleaning in
[1:00:24] the fields. And that's why you don't see
[1:00:26] hundreds of people at a time coming to
[1:00:28] the Lord. Amen. Because it's just a it's
[1:00:30] just got to a smaller group of people.
[1:00:32] So many people are satisfied, amen, with
[1:00:35] with what they have. So many people are
[1:00:36] satisfied, amen, with with with the way
[1:00:38] the world is. And and I don't say that
[1:00:40] there's not millions coming into the
[1:00:42] churches because the church may get
[1:00:44] bigger than it's ever been. Amen. Are
[1:00:46] you with me?
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; The church may get bigger than it's ever
[1:00:49] been, but that's not the bride's
[1:00:51] revival.
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; That's not the group of people that's
[1:00:53] getting ready for a body change. Amen.
[1:00:55] They're actually feeling the anointing
[1:00:57] of the hour and getting ready for the
[1:00:59] oncoming storm.
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; Are you still with me? They feel the
[1:01:04] effects of our revival,
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; but they haven't participated in it.
[1:01:08] Amen. because it's to the bride. I I I I
[1:01:11] just want to try to get this the best I
[1:01:13] know how. You forgive me this morning. I
[1:01:15] I'm stumbling around, but this is on my
[1:01:16] arm. I mean, the the people that you see
[1:01:18] out there giving their life for the
[1:01:19] gospel, they're under an anointing that
[1:01:22] is actually it's it's a good anointing.
[1:01:25] It's a true anointing, but it is
[1:01:26] actually caused by the very message that
[1:01:28] you have.
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; It's the truth.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; Because there is no revival outside this
[1:01:34] message,
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; but they're feeling the effect of
[1:01:36] revival. Right?
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; They're feeling the the they're feeling
[1:01:39] the heat of the moment. I mean, you can
[1:01:41] ask a worldly person that just believes
[1:01:44] in Jesus Christ and and you know, they
[1:01:45] say, "Well, I'm a Christian." Well, they
[1:01:47] can tell you that something's about to
[1:01:48] take place. They can tell you that the
[1:01:50] hour is getting getting close. And I've
[1:01:52] had men tell me recently, "I believe
[1:01:54] that this world's about gone." And
[1:01:56] they're sitting there smoking their
[1:01:57] cigarettes and and cussing like a
[1:01:58] sailor. But they'll tell you that
[1:01:59] there's something about to happen. Come
[1:02:01] on, church. They can feel the pull of
[1:02:03] the hour. They can feel the effect of
[1:02:06] revival. Amen. But to you that have
[1:02:08] accepted the revival in your hour. You
[1:02:10] can rejoice because you know your names
[1:02:12] are written on the lamb's book of life.
[1:02:14] Amen. You know that God has chosen you
[1:02:17] for such a time as this. He didn't call
[1:02:19] you just to feel the effects of revival.
[1:02:21] But he called you to be the revival.
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; He called the He called you, Amen, to
[1:02:26] live the word in your hour. Come on,
[1:02:28] church. Amen. I don't want to just have
[1:02:30] the effects of revival. I don't want to
[1:02:32] just have a good time. Amen. But I want
[1:02:34] to have the word come in and change the
[1:02:35] very fiber of my being because that's
[1:02:37] what revival really will do to the
[1:02:39] person. Come on, church. Amen. I don't
[1:02:41] want our young people to just have an
[1:02:42] emotion, but I want something to change
[1:02:44] our young people. Amen. I don't want
[1:02:46] Come on, church. Amen. I don't want just
[1:02:48] a shouting, church. Amen. But I want to
[1:02:50] see Amen. I want to see the shout
[1:02:51] produce something else. Amen. I want
[1:02:53] something I want a life to be produced.
[1:02:55] And I say, Lord, help me. I don't want
[1:02:57] to just have a good time. I don't want
[1:02:59] to just feel the presence of God, but I
[1:03:01] want to be in the presence of God. Amen.
[1:03:03] I want the presence of God to be in me.
[1:03:05] And I want his life to live through me.
[1:03:07] Come on, church. We are not just here to
[1:03:09] feel good. It's not about how you feel,
[1:03:11] but what it is. It's about what's on the
[1:03:13] inside of you. And when you see the sons
[1:03:15] of God shouting for joy, it's because
[1:03:18] God thought of them and they saw that
[1:03:20] their name was written in the book. Come
[1:03:22] on, church. When you see that the
[1:03:24] message is no longer closed up to you,
[1:03:26] Amen. But the seals have been loosed
[1:03:27] from the book. Amen. It has been
[1:03:29] revealed to you. Amen. and you look on
[1:03:31] there and you say, "Hey, there's my
[1:03:33] name. There's my name. He chose me and
[1:03:36] he called me for such a time as this."
[1:03:38] Come on, church. That is the embers
[1:03:40] glowing in the hearts of the believer.
[1:03:41] And the world feels the effect of it.
[1:03:43] Amen. But we are not of the world. Amen.
[1:03:45] We're just in the world. And we're not
[1:03:47] just feeling effects of it. Amen. But
[1:03:48] when you get around somebody and they
[1:03:50] start to feel that they're they almost
[1:03:52] feel like they're in revival because the
[1:03:54] that the very glow of God that is on the
[1:03:56] inside of you, amen, is glowing out.
[1:03:58] Amen. it is is affecting the people
[1:04:00] around you. Come on, church. If that's
[1:04:01] not happening, I say we need to get back
[1:04:03] in revival. If the world is not seeing
[1:04:06] revival in us, I say, Lord, help me. I
[1:04:09] want to be that revival. I want the word
[1:04:11] to change me. I want the word to take
[1:04:13] away my temper. I want the word to take
[1:04:15] away everything that's on the inside of
[1:04:16] me that's wrong. I want to be cleansed
[1:04:18] by the coal of fire this morning so that
[1:04:21] I can rejoice in the word that has been
[1:04:22] presented to me.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; Are you still with me this morning?
[1:04:25] Somebody say, "Praise the Lord." Amen.
[1:04:27] Are you in revival this morning? Amen.
[1:04:29] The revival, the revival is not an
[1:04:31] emotion. I I just want to drill that
[1:04:32] into you. Amen. We love emotion. I
[1:04:34] believe in shouting and running and I
[1:04:36] believe in all the things that God has
[1:04:38] restored to the church. Amen. All those
[1:04:39] things. Listen, we're we're we're not a
[1:04:42] dead church. We don't want to put those
[1:04:43] things down. Amen. The
[1:04:46] never been put out of the church. Amen.
[1:04:47] They were not put in the church just to
[1:04:49] be taken out. Amen. But those things
[1:04:50] were placed in the body. Amen. I believe
[1:04:52] they're still here. They're still
[1:04:53] working. And I believe there's still
[1:04:54] things going on in the church. But I
[1:04:56] want you to know, amen, we're not
[1:04:57] following after signs. Amen. But there
[1:04:59] is signs following the believers.
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's a difference in feeling
[1:05:03] the effects and having revival in your
[1:05:06] soul.
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; He said, "That's the reason today.
[1:05:09] That's the reason the revivals that
[1:05:10] we're supposed to have, we have
[1:05:12] denominational revivals. We haven't had
[1:05:14] a real stirring." No, sir. I don't think
[1:05:16] we've got revivals. He said, "No, we
[1:05:18] haven't." He said, "Oh, they got
[1:05:19] millions and millions and millions of
[1:05:20] church members, but not a revival
[1:05:22] nowhere."
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; Are you still with me? the bride. I want
[1:05:27] you to notice the progression of the
[1:05:28] message early on. And I may have
[1:05:31] preached on this this awakening at one
[1:05:32] point here, but I want you to notice
[1:05:34] that the bride's revival that we have is
[1:05:36] not something that that that that some
[1:05:38] people get because they they take quotes
[1:05:39] out of context and they take them out of
[1:05:41] they they forget that the prophet
[1:05:42] himself had a progressive re revelation.
[1:05:45] And so he actually would say in the
[1:05:46] third seal that the bride hasn't had a
[1:05:47] revival yet. He said there's been no
[1:05:49] revival, no manifestation of God to stir
[1:05:51] the bride yet. See, we're looking for it
[1:05:53] now. It'll take those seven unknown
[1:05:54] thunders back there to wake her up
[1:05:56] again. He said, "Yeah, he'll send it. He
[1:05:58] promised. Now watch." And now, for those
[1:06:02] of you that may not understand what
[1:06:05] where I'm going here this morning, he
[1:06:07] said the messenger of Malachi 4 and
[1:06:09] Revelation 10:7 is going to do two
[1:06:11] things. One, according to Malachi 4, he
[1:06:14] will turn the hearts of the children to
[1:06:16] the fathers.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; How many believes in a restoration
[1:06:18] message?
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; He will turn it back to the fathers. He
[1:06:22] is not going to leave you in your in
[1:06:25] your He's not going to leave you in the
[1:06:26] traditions of man. He's not going to
[1:06:28] leave you, Amen. under the Catholic
[1:06:30] system. Amen. But he will actually turn
[1:06:32] your hearts back to the original faith.
[1:06:35] Can you say amen? So everything that was
[1:06:37] lost, everything that was ate off of the
[1:06:39] tree, everything that was taken away
[1:06:40] from this bride tree would be restored
[1:06:43] before the coming of the Lord. And the
[1:06:44] bride said, "Amen." He said he would
[1:06:47] turn, that's Malachi 4. If you want to
[1:06:48] read it, go read it. And he said, "We'll
[1:06:50] turn the hearts of the children to the
[1:06:51] fathers." And then he said, "He will
[1:06:53] reveal the mysteries of the seven
[1:06:54] thunders in Revelations 10, which are
[1:06:57] the revelations contained in the seven
[1:06:59] seals." Now, that's not deep. I know
[1:07:01] some people make try to make that deep.
[1:07:02] That's not deep at all. It says, "In the
[1:07:04] days of the voice of the seventh angel,
[1:07:05] when he shall begin to sound, the
[1:07:06] mysteries of God should be finished as
[1:07:08] he hath declared to his servants the
[1:07:10] prophets." And we believe that. We
[1:07:12] believe that that has come and that has
[1:07:14] happened. every you know the the problem
[1:07:16] with some denominations is is they will
[1:07:18] actually take what the what the Bible
[1:07:20] says and they'll either place it back on
[1:07:22] the apostles or they'll place it into
[1:07:24] the future that we cannot attain to but
[1:07:26] we believe that it happened because we
[1:07:28] can see scripture being fulfilled in our
[1:07:30] day. That ought to make the bride
[1:07:31] rejoice.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; That ought to make us happy that we can
[1:07:34] see these things. These are the things
[1:07:36] that were sealed up in the book and
[1:07:37] they've been loosed to the bride. And so
[1:07:39] he goes on down like this. He said now
[1:07:41] he said he said everywhere now there's
[1:07:43] no revival everybody is complaining
[1:07:45] ministers crying he said he was reading
[1:07:47] one of the outstanding papers the Herald
[1:07:49] was coming I believe it was he said and
[1:07:50] here comes the church a fine paper and I
[1:07:52] know the editor and and they're godly
[1:07:54] people he said very fine brother and
[1:07:56] sister Moore of the Herald was coming
[1:07:58] one of the finest papers on the field he
[1:07:59] said but they hardly will print anything
[1:08:01] unless it's about fast and pray fast and
[1:08:02] pray sounded trumpet how many reads it
[1:08:05] he said he said you'll hear that all the
[1:08:06] time we're going to have a great
[1:08:07] breaking of the day they were looking
[1:08:09] for it because they were feeling the
[1:08:11] effect of revival. Stay with me for a
[1:08:12] minute if you would. He said, "Now all
[1:08:14] of you," he said, "now why do they do
[1:08:16] that? What do they do? They want a great
[1:08:18] awakening. They're crying, believing
[1:08:19] that there will be awakening." Now,
[1:08:21] these were not bad people. These were
[1:08:22] not people that Brother Brandon was
[1:08:24] condemning to hell. These were good
[1:08:26] Christian people working in the same
[1:08:27] field he was working in. Amen. They were
[1:08:29] actually laboring under the same
[1:08:31] anointing that he was under.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; That's right, sir.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; Because they could feel the anointing.
[1:08:35] They were not chosen as the man, but
[1:08:37] they were under the the effects of the
[1:08:40] message. Are you still with me?
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; He said they're crying, believing that
[1:08:43] there will be awakening. They're good
[1:08:45] people. Why is it? What have they done?
[1:08:46] They have not recognized the awakening
[1:08:49] of the bride. Amen. So, the awakening of
[1:08:52] the bride is the bride's revival
[1:08:54] happening. Amen. When the true church
[1:08:56] begins to line up with the word for the
[1:08:58] age. Now, I want you to notice there has
[1:09:00] been true revivals before the bride's
[1:09:03] revival. Amen. There was a bride's
[1:09:05] revival for Luther when he come out of
[1:09:06] the Catholic church and he denounced
[1:09:08] their teaching and he would actually
[1:09:09] come forth. Amen. And he would stand for
[1:09:11] the word that God opened to his eyes in
[1:09:13] that days. Amen. The just shall live by
[1:09:15] faith. Amen. And it caused a revival. A
[1:09:18] true genuine revival. It was not a dead
[1:09:21] revival. It was real. The people in that
[1:09:23] age were actually called to that revival
[1:09:25] and were the called out for that time.
[1:09:28] Called to the message of Luther. And
[1:09:30] then Wesley would come along and take
[1:09:32] what Luther learned and add some light
[1:09:34] to the age under the revelation that God
[1:09:36] would give him. And when Wesley would
[1:09:37] speak and say, "Amen, sanctification was
[1:09:40] his message." Amen. We've got to be
[1:09:41] sanctified. Amen. It's And he would
[1:09:43] preach that message where there was
[1:09:45] sanctification to the church. Amen. So
[1:09:47] you had the justification and the
[1:09:49] sanctification and then there would come
[1:09:51] a Pentecostal revival, an Isusa street
[1:09:54] revival, and they were under a true
[1:09:56] anointing. That's right.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; It was not a false anointing. It was
[1:10:01] something to It was a true It was a time
[1:10:04] where they would actually come up higher
[1:10:05] into the things of God and they would
[1:10:07] actually accept the gifts that had been
[1:10:09] restored. Amen. To the age because soon
[1:10:12] would come a prophet to restore
[1:10:14] everything back to the church. Amen. But
[1:10:16] that's when the church left the message.
[1:10:19] Come on, church. You say, "How old's
[1:10:20] this message?" This message has been
[1:10:22] here since Jesus's time. I mean, it's
[1:10:24] been here all the way back to Moses.
[1:10:25] This message is not something William
[1:10:26] Brandham brought. This message was
[1:10:28] something that William Brandon was under
[1:10:30] an anointing to bring to you. Amen. He
[1:10:32] was the messenger that God called to
[1:10:34] point you back to a revealed truth. Come
[1:10:36] on, somebody. Amen. He did not He did
[1:10:38] not call you and say, "Look, look to my
[1:10:40] message and what's coming in the
[1:10:41] future." But he actually called you to
[1:10:44] say, "Look to the word." Because in the
[1:10:46] word is eternal life. Don't look to me.
[1:10:49] He said, "Look to the message."
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; Look to the message. And so when and so
[1:10:54] Wesley would come along. But the problem
[1:10:56] with those groups was they would
[1:10:58] actually denominate around the man.
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; I know message people have tried to do
[1:11:03] the same thing.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; They've tried to denominate around a man
[1:11:06] and they die too. But when you actually
[1:11:08] re re when you receive the light for
[1:11:11] your day, which is not the man, but the
[1:11:13] light, the word, the revival. What made
[1:11:17] the revival in Luther's day? It wasn't
[1:11:18] how good he preached. It wasn't how loud
[1:11:20] they shouted. They may not have shouted
[1:11:22] at all. It was the message that came.
[1:11:24] The revival in Wesley's day, it was the
[1:11:26] revival that came. Luther's day,
[1:11:28] Wesley's day, there was a revival act in
[1:11:30] Acts 238. If you go all the way back to
[1:11:32] there, the Acts two church rather, and
[1:11:34] you go and you see that they actually
[1:11:36] come together in one accord and they
[1:11:38] were expecting the word to be revealed
[1:11:41] and that's what caused that revival. The
[1:11:43] word has always been present at revival
[1:11:45] time. The word has always been the
[1:11:48] revival. I mean, it's not a new thing.
[1:11:50] This is not a new standard. This is not
[1:11:52] a new tradition. But the bride and the
[1:11:55] word has always been in revival
[1:11:58] together. And so I want you to notice
[1:12:00] that that there's no there's no revival.
[1:12:02] Amen. In the feeling, but there is a
[1:12:04] revival in the opening of the word to
[1:12:07] you. Can you see it this morning? Amen.
[1:12:09] So the revivals uh that the cycles keep
[1:12:11] dying. The the cycles of revival and
[1:12:13] death, they keep they keep dying in
[1:12:15] those other generations. Amen. But it
[1:12:17] doesn't die today because the final
[1:12:19] revival would be when the mysteries are
[1:12:21] open. Amen. And the the church can
[1:12:23] actually see who she is. She can see
[1:12:26] where she came from, where she's going.
[1:12:28] She knows that the pull of the hour is
[1:12:30] not just a feeling. Amen. But it is a
[1:12:32] part of her. You are being called up
[1:12:34] higher. Can the church say amen? Amen.
[1:12:36] Brother Brandon would go like this. He
[1:12:37] said it happened to every group before
[1:12:38] us. We are in the final age. We have
[1:12:40] been called to overcome the spirit that
[1:12:43] would cause us to denominate. And we
[1:12:45] accept the true word. And the word
[1:12:47] causes revival in us that cannot cease.
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; That's the truth whether you like it or
[1:12:54] not.
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. The word causes revival.
[1:12:57] Revelations 2 and4 says, "Nevertheless,
[1:13:00] I have somewhat against thee because
[1:13:01] thou hast left thy first love." To
[1:13:04] understand this, you must realize, and
[1:13:06] brother Brandon goes on, he picks up on
[1:13:07] that. To understand this, you must
[1:13:09] realize that the spirit is not speaking
[1:13:10] to the original saints of Ephesus alone.
[1:13:12] Amen. But it was actually uh Ephesus to
[1:13:15] to the church, not just to the original
[1:13:17] ones because no doubt they were in
[1:13:18] revival. Amen. But then there would be
[1:13:20] another group there that he would speak
[1:13:22] to. He said, "History repeats itself. In
[1:13:24] all the generations of Israel, we see
[1:13:25] revival in one generation only to see
[1:13:27] the fires fading in the next. In the
[1:13:29] third generation, embers may be glowing
[1:13:31] slightly, but in the fourth, there may
[1:13:33] be no vestage whatsoever of that
[1:13:35] original flame." He said, "Then God
[1:13:37] lights the fire again, and the same
[1:13:39] process is repeated. It's simply the
[1:13:42] manifestation of the truth that God has
[1:13:45] no grandchildren.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; God has sons and daughters. He does not
[1:13:50] have grandchildren.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; I don't care if you say, "Well, my dad's
[1:13:55] a message believer. My dad's a Holy
[1:13:56] Ghost filled Christian. So, so God must
[1:13:58] be my grandpa." That's not the way this
[1:14:00] works because you have to come into a
[1:14:02] personal relationship with God. You've
[1:14:04] got to see God for yourself. You've got
[1:14:06] to have the word opened for yourself.
[1:14:08] Listen, this this opening of the word
[1:14:10] will not affect you if you're just going
[1:14:12] in on your parents coattail, but it's
[1:14:14] got to be a personal revelation.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; And so it goes like this. Salvation is
[1:14:20] not passed on by natural birth anymore
[1:14:22] than there's any truth to apostolic
[1:14:24] succession. It isn't in the word. Can
[1:14:26] the church say amen?
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; You start out with a truly born again
[1:14:29] believers and when the next generation
[1:14:31] comes along, they're no longer just
[1:14:32] plain Christians, but they have taken a
[1:14:34] denominational name and they're now
[1:14:36] Baptist, Methodist, etc. Now listen, I
[1:14:38] don't say there's not Christians in
[1:14:39] those groups under those names. I I I
[1:14:41] believe that with all my heart. I don't
[1:14:43] I don't condemn them to hell. But I want
[1:14:45] you to notice that they have not come to
[1:14:47] the light of the hour. I don't say that
[1:14:50] the ones that are still following a
[1:14:51] Luther message. I I've told you this
[1:14:53] before. I'll tell you again. I grew up
[1:14:54] around the church of God holy people and
[1:14:56] they followed that Westland message just
[1:14:58] I mean they were diehard Wesleians. They
[1:14:59] were they were real and they were real
[1:15:00] Christians, you know. They were they
[1:15:02] were so sanctified they couldn't even
[1:15:03] show their elbows. Hallelujah. And so
[1:15:05] they were they they they were they were
[1:15:07] they were just uh you can call it
[1:15:08] legalism if you want to, but those were
[1:15:10] dedicated Christians.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; They really were. I've seen prayer
[1:15:13] warriors in those groups that would put
[1:15:14] me to shame or about anybody else I've
[1:15:16] seen to shame. I mean, I I've seen them.
[1:15:18] I I've seen them. And you say, "Well,
[1:15:20] they they were dead. They were quiet."
[1:15:21] No, I've seen them shout and run. I
[1:15:22] remember sister Sister Mushin was her
[1:15:25] name and she was a woman that gave her
[1:15:27] life to the gospel. She was a woman
[1:15:28] missionary. And she would actually she'd
[1:15:30] get excited and she would at 90 years
[1:15:32] old, I believe it was. She was 90 years
[1:15:34] old. and she would run this auditorium
[1:15:35] up in Dayton, Ohio. There was it was a
[1:15:37] huge auditorium. There's about 9,000
[1:15:39] people in there. I remember that. And
[1:15:40] and she would get out and run those
[1:15:42] aisles all the way around. You say they
[1:15:44] don't have any any spirit or any
[1:15:46] feeling. Yes, they do. That they did.
[1:15:48] And you actually what you'll see now is
[1:15:50] as we were seeing it then that
[1:15:51] generation was still on fire with
[1:15:53] Wesley's message.
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; But then when you see the next group,
[1:15:57] the next thing you know, they cut their
[1:15:58] hair off. They they started wearing
[1:15:59] pants and and they had no word to
[1:16:02] sustain them.
[1:16:04] Are you still with me? I'm going
[1:16:06] somewhere and I'm hoping y'all are still
[1:16:07] there. Amen. But but but they were good
[1:16:09] people when they walked in the light
[1:16:11] that they knew. They were saved people.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; They were not they were not lost. I
[1:16:15] don't believe that sister. I'll never
[1:16:16] forget her. She was just as she was as
[1:16:18] godly and as gracious and and one of the
[1:16:20] most wonderful women I've ever met in my
[1:16:22] life. And she was a Church of God
[1:16:24] holiness woman. But I will say this, she
[1:16:26] was absolutely following the light and
[1:16:28] the anointing of her time. She was still
[1:16:30] under it. She was this, if you ever went
[1:16:32] back and you heard how they preached and
[1:16:33] how hard they preached and things, what
[1:16:35] what I'll tell you is this. That woman
[1:16:36] lived what they preached. She was she
[1:16:38] lived it. She lived it to the letter.
[1:16:40] Amen. But what she failed to see that
[1:16:42] maybe wasn't for her. But what she would
[1:16:44] fail to see was the life that was to
[1:16:46] come. She would she would I will say
[1:16:48] this, if there was a knock on her, Amen.
[1:16:50] She couldn't stand a Pentecostal that
[1:16:51] would speak in tonesues.
[1:16:53] You could shout, but you couldn't speak
[1:16:55] in tonesues. You could make a lot of
[1:16:56] noise, but you couldn't speak in
[1:16:57] tonesues because they didn't accept the
[1:16:59] next revival. Are you with me?
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; There was a revival that came. Amen. So,
[1:17:02] the Pentecostal revival was the real
[1:17:05] thing. It was the true anointing that
[1:17:07] was poured out. But the problem with
[1:17:10] them is when the word was revealed, they
[1:17:13] wanted the shout without the message.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; They wanted the shout. They wanted the
[1:17:18] anointing. They wanted the feeling, but
[1:17:20] they did not want the word to come open
[1:17:22] to them. Are you still with me this
[1:17:24] morning? Amen. I'm not saying they're
[1:17:25] bad people. I'm not trying to put
[1:17:27] anybody out. I I believe there's going
[1:17:28] to be many that are even saved now.
[1:17:30] Amen. They'll give their lives for the
[1:17:31] gospel and all those things. And I
[1:17:32] believe those are saved people. I really
[1:17:34] do with all my heart. I don't put them
[1:17:36] people in hell for giving their life for
[1:17:37] the gospel. I I I remember there was a
[1:17:39] man recently that that he got arrested
[1:17:41] in South Africa, a Baptist missionary. I
[1:17:43] I don't listen, I'm not going to condemn
[1:17:44] the man. I say if he's doing something
[1:17:46] for the Lord, let him keep doing
[1:17:47] something for the Lord. Amen. But when
[1:17:48] the light has been presented to you, you
[1:17:51] must walk in the light.
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's good. There's been
[1:17:54] many that the light hasn't been
[1:17:55] presented to. And they're going to make
[1:17:57] it. They're going to go to the great
[1:17:58] white th white white throne judgment.
[1:18:00] And they'll stand there and I believe
[1:18:01] it'll be like the story of Daniel Curry.
[1:18:04] Amen. Maybe I hadn't done everything
[1:18:05] right. Maybe I haven't been right. Amen.
[1:18:07] Maybe I made a lot of mistakes and I
[1:18:08] thought I was a good person, but maybe I
[1:18:10] did tell a lie. Amen. But God would
[1:18:11] stand there and say, "Well, on earth you
[1:18:13] stood for me."
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; I say I say, "Lord, give us more people
[1:18:16] that'll stand for the message. Give us
[1:18:18] more people that'll stand for Christ.
[1:18:19] Give us more people that'll stand."
[1:18:21] Amen. I say, "Amen. when we've done all
[1:18:23] that we can do. Let's stand for this
[1:18:25] word. Amen. I I don't want to give up. I
[1:18:27] don't want to I don't want to let down
[1:18:28] the bars. Amen. But what I want to say
[1:18:31] this morning, the folks that are all
[1:18:32] coming together now by the will of man,
[1:18:34] I don't say that some of them are not
[1:18:35] right with God. Not for a minute do I
[1:18:38] say that. But the original fire has died
[1:18:40] down. They are not the same anymore. The
[1:18:43] fervent desire to please God, the
[1:18:45] passion to know his word, the cry for
[1:18:47] reaching out in the spirit, all begins
[1:18:49] to fade. And instead of that church
[1:18:51] being on fire with the fire of God, it
[1:18:53] has cooled off and become a bit formal.
[1:18:55] We've seen that. But church, I want you
[1:18:57] to know something. Don't associate
[1:18:59] yourself in that quote as a message
[1:19:01] believer.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; You say, "What about us if we're quiet?"
[1:19:05] I want you to notice the difference in
[1:19:06] us being quiet. Anybody else being
[1:19:08] quiet?
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; The word's still here.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; Their fires died out.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm not I'm not You know, you know
[1:19:18] me. I don't like quiet,
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; but but I don't want but I want you to
[1:19:23] know you're not dead if the living word
[1:19:25] is inside of you.
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; So when we're when we're when I'm up
[1:19:30] here asking for amens and all those
[1:19:31] things, I'm not telling you you're dead.
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; Because if you've accepted this end time
[1:19:37] message, you are the only revival this
[1:19:38] earth has.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; And that's the truth. Whether you're
[1:19:41] quiet or loud or whatever,
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; those are the effects of revival.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; The real revival is the word. Are you
[1:19:48] still with me?
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; I told Brother Stewart how long I'd
[1:19:50] preach this morning and I don't want to
[1:19:51] tell you because I don't want to lie to
[1:19:53] more than one person.
[1:19:58] They were getting formal.
[1:20:00] He said God was dying out and the people
[1:20:03] weren't too careful about what God
[1:20:04] thought of them as they begin to be
[1:20:06] careful about what the world thought of
[1:20:08] them. Anybody ever been there?
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. You ever thought? You ever
[1:20:12] thought when you went out in the public,
[1:20:13] you you stand in the mirror, I wonder
[1:20:16] what people are going to think of me. I
[1:20:18] kind of, you know, but you ever wonder
[1:20:19] what what's God going to think of me?
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; And that is the most important thing.
[1:20:25] Brother would go on like this. He said
[1:20:27] they were careful about what the world
[1:20:28] thought of them. That second generation
[1:20:30] coming on was just like Israel. They
[1:20:32] demanded a king to be like the other
[1:20:33] nations. When they did that, they
[1:20:34] rejected God, but they did it anyway.
[1:20:36] That is the history of the church. When
[1:20:38] it thinks more of conforming to the
[1:20:41] world instead of conforming to God, it
[1:20:43] isn't long until you see them stop doing
[1:20:45] things they used to do and start doing
[1:20:47] things they wouldn't do initially. The
[1:20:49] change they change their manner of
[1:20:51] dress, their attitudes, and their
[1:20:52] behavior. They get laxed. That is what
[1:20:54] ephesis means. Drifting and relaxed. The
[1:20:56] cycle of revival and death has never
[1:20:58] failed. And all you have to do is recall
[1:21:00] the last move of God in the spirit. When
[1:21:01] men and women dressed like Christians
[1:21:03] went to church, prayed all night, took
[1:21:04] to the street corners, and weren't
[1:21:06] ashamed of the manifestations of the
[1:21:08] spirit, they left their old dead
[1:21:09] churches and worshiped in homes or store
[1:21:11] buildings. They had reality.
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; We need reality this morning.
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; He said, he said, they put in a church
[1:21:18] choir instead of singing unto God for
[1:21:20] themselves. They put gowns on the choir.
[1:21:21] I've read this one before. They
[1:21:23] organized a movement and ran it by man.
[1:21:24] They soon began to read books and
[1:21:26] weren't fit to read. They let down the
[1:21:27] bars and the goats came in and took
[1:21:29] over. The cry of joy was gone.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; When the word leaves the church, the cry
[1:21:35] of joy leaves the church.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; Because listen, we don't have nothing to
[1:21:39] shout over when the word's not there.
[1:21:41] But when the word is there, when the
[1:21:43] word is being preached, then the people
[1:21:46] can rejoice because the word is the
[1:21:48] revival.
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; That's why you see I'm going to drift
[1:21:51] off here a minute because this is what I
[1:21:52] do best, I guess, or worse. You see
[1:21:55] message people and they're under the
[1:21:57] anointing of the message. They believe
[1:21:59] the message and they quit following what
[1:22:02] the word tells them to do
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; and then the next thing you know you see
[1:22:05] a real dead church.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; And I'm not pointing fingers at them.
[1:22:09] I'm not saying that the individuals in
[1:22:11] that churches are not some good people.
[1:22:12] But what I'm saying as a whole when they
[1:22:14] pick up a form and say we're going to
[1:22:17] we're going to take the preachers out of
[1:22:18] the pulpit. We're come on somebody.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; We're just going to close the doors of
[1:22:22] the church. Why do you need persecution
[1:22:23] to close your doors if you've done it
[1:22:24] yourself?
[1:22:27] It's the truth anyway.
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; And a prophet never taught us to do
[1:22:30] that.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; A prophet told us that we should feel we
[1:22:33] should feel in this hour that there was
[1:22:35] there there's joy. There should be there
[1:22:36] should be joy in this hour because he
[1:22:38] said when they went that way and they
[1:22:40] actually left there that they they left
[1:22:42] the the message and they started doing
[1:22:44] things, you know, that they thought was
[1:22:46] right and they organized a movement, the
[1:22:48] cry of joy was gone. So when the cry of
[1:22:50] joy is gone, I need you to check up and
[1:22:53] say, "Lord, am I still following your
[1:22:55] word?"
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; That's not the church. That's an
[1:22:58] individual.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; I want to go here this morning for just
[1:23:00] a moment before we before we wind this
[1:23:02] down. The bride's revival is not a is
[1:23:06] not is not a body is not a it's not a
[1:23:08] full church coming into a shouting spell
[1:23:10] or having a good service. That is not
[1:23:13] revival for you. Amen. So when I when we
[1:23:16] say we have revival services, the
[1:23:17] revival services that we have, Amen,
[1:23:19] that they feel good. They're wonderful.
[1:23:21] But there's no more of God here during
[1:23:22] the middle of a revival than there is
[1:23:24] here this morning. There's no more
[1:23:26] there's no more revival for you. Amen.
[1:23:28] There's no re more revival for you
[1:23:29] sitting in a church pew than there is
[1:23:31] driving down the down the road. Amen.
[1:23:33] Tears streaming down your face. The word
[1:23:35] of God being played. Come on, somebody.
[1:23:37] Amen. The word is not something that we
[1:23:39] just hype up. It's not something that
[1:23:40] just is is talked about, but it is a
[1:23:42] living thing on the inside of the bride.
[1:23:45] I
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; mean, the word is not just a feeling.
[1:23:48] Can I drive that to you this morning?
[1:23:50] But the word is a reality. The word is a
[1:23:53] living thing. It is something that is
[1:23:55] not dead. How could I be dead if the
[1:23:57] word's on the inside of me? Amen. You
[1:23:59] say, "Well, I I'm quiet. Am I dead?" No,
[1:24:01] you're not dead. Not if the word's on
[1:24:03] the inside of you. Amen. You've
[1:24:04] recognized your day. You've recognized
[1:24:06] the message. The word has come. I say
[1:24:09] rejoice because the word has been open
[1:24:11] to you and your name is written on the
[1:24:14] lamb's book of life. Amen. That ought to
[1:24:16] give the church reason to say, "Amen.
[1:24:18] Lift up your hands and praise the Lord."
[1:24:20] Amen. Because I don't I don't have to go
[1:24:22] down with the destruction of the world.
[1:24:24] Amen. I don't have to look and say, "I'm
[1:24:26] looking for another revival." No, I can
[1:24:27] say, "I am the revival. I am the bride's
[1:24:30] revival." The word is on the inside of
[1:24:33] you. Listen, church, this flesh ain't
[1:24:34] revival. That flesh is just feeling the
[1:24:36] effects of revival. Amen. But revival is
[1:24:39] something that God is doing inside of
[1:24:42] you.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; Inside of the bride, inside of the
[1:24:45] believer. I mean, if you believe this
[1:24:47] message, you are in revival.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; Do we need a stirring every once in a
[1:24:52] while? Yes, we need a stirring to get
[1:24:54] some of the trash out of us. But there's
[1:24:55] no more revival in you after the effects
[1:24:58] of revival than there was before the
[1:25:00] effects of revival because the word has
[1:25:02] been born in you.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:25:06] That's why the ocean is not in more
[1:25:08] revival or have more water when the when
[1:25:10] the winds are blowing. No, that doesn't
[1:25:12] cause that doesn't cause you to be
[1:25:14] greater. It's still the ocean. Brother
[1:25:16] Brandon would say there's not one drop
[1:25:18] of there's not one spoonful more of
[1:25:20] water in that ocean. After the storms
[1:25:24] are moving the waves, you see the waves
[1:25:26] are way up and the tidal waves and all
[1:25:27] these things. You say, "Oh, there must
[1:25:29] be more water." And no, it is a it is
[1:25:31] something that is cleansing the ocean.
[1:25:33] It is something rocking the ocean and
[1:25:35] the winds are blowing and the winds of
[1:25:37] revival. I want to see them blowing here
[1:25:38] in this church. But I want you to know,
[1:25:40] amen, when you're having to pull through
[1:25:42] a service. And Lord, I I'm here, but I'm
[1:25:45] not feeling it right now. He didn't ask
[1:25:47] if you feel it, but do you believe
[1:25:48] you're in revival?
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; Do you believe you're in it? If you
[1:25:52] believe the word, then you're in
[1:25:53] revival. I mean, the word has become one
[1:25:55] with you.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; Are you still with me this morning? He
[1:25:58] said, "When the spiritual bride, when
[1:26:01] she begins to have a revival, when she
[1:26:03] begins to come back and line herself up
[1:26:04] with the word of God, then watch." He
[1:26:07] said, "How that the scriptures at that
[1:26:09] time, there'll be a message sweep out to
[1:26:11] catch that bride, catch that woman
[1:26:13] elect. For as the world, Satan, the
[1:26:15] deceiver, who deceived the first bride
[1:26:17] to sin against God by misbelieving his
[1:26:19] word." And now today, we see the church
[1:26:21] natural in the intellectual gospel going
[1:26:23] further and further away from the word.
[1:26:25] Remember what we read in Genesis. It's
[1:26:27] the same spirit, same anointing on the
[1:26:29] church. Amen. They were they were they
[1:26:30] were they they they feel the anointing
[1:26:32] of the hour. Amen. They see all the
[1:26:34] things that God has given them. Amen.
[1:26:35] And they take it and they they make an
[1:26:36] organization out of it and they build
[1:26:38] bigger churches and that's okay. Amen.
[1:26:40] But if they but but if you leave the
[1:26:41] word, the big church ain't going to save
[1:26:43] you. Amen. That the nicer pews are not
[1:26:45] going to save you. Amen. You've got to
[1:26:46] come back to the word. He said now he
[1:26:48] said now today we see that church he
[1:26:50] said doing the same thing and we find
[1:26:52] that the woman of the world on the
[1:26:53] streets members he said is carrying
[1:26:55] themselves in the same atmosphere. I
[1:26:58] want you to notice there's not much
[1:26:59] difference in a nominal church and a
[1:27:02] worldly woman.
[1:27:04] I went to an Assembly of God church one
[1:27:06] time and you know that good people, nice
[1:27:10] people, friendly people, they you know
[1:27:12] they dress just like they were out in
[1:27:13] public. You know they you almost have to
[1:27:14] turn your head in the church. It's a bad
[1:27:16] place to be,
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; but it's not them that's bad. They have
[1:27:20] lost revival because they didn't walk
[1:27:22] into the light of their hour.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; And so he said he they've lost all s
[1:27:27] excuse me sense of common decency the
[1:27:29] people have. See, and that's the way the
[1:27:31] church has. And you can see it going
[1:27:34] straight to the ecumenical council just
[1:27:36] as certain as anything in the world and
[1:27:37] right into Rome as hard as it can go.
[1:27:39] See, he said because it's prophesied.
[1:27:41] Hey man, how many believes that that
[1:27:42] we've seen prophecy fulfilled in the
[1:27:44] last year or two? You say, "Well, I I
[1:27:46] don't believe that that pope is the
[1:27:47] pope." Well, I'll tell you one thing.
[1:27:48] The prophecy about an American pope is
[1:27:49] here,
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; whether it's that pope or another pope.
[1:27:52] That part happened whether you like, you
[1:27:53] know, you can say what you want about
[1:27:54] it. I know a lot nobody wants to believe
[1:27:56] prophecy when it's fulfilled because it
[1:27:57] seems strange.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; He said, "What about the rest of that
[1:28:01] quote?" Well, it'll be fulfilled just
[1:28:02] like that part was.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; And so he goes on, I'm officially a
[1:28:07] liar, Brother Stewart.
[1:28:10] He said, "But then watch again to the
[1:28:11] spiritual church. This is you." How many
[1:28:15] spiritual believers we got in here?
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; He said, he said, "Watch again, the
[1:28:19] spiritual church." He said, "How that
[1:28:21] group of people called out the elected
[1:28:22] through every revival in Martin Luther,
[1:28:24] it happened the same way. Reformation
[1:28:25] happened. John Wesley, it happened just
[1:28:27] like we talked about a little bit ago.
[1:28:28] Pentecost, it started. They dropped them
[1:28:30] women right back in line with the word
[1:28:32] and then they drifted away and there she
[1:28:34] goes right back over into chaos. But
[1:28:36] then the time that the people are ready
[1:28:37] to line up, there is a message comes
[1:28:40] forth and they line with it.
[1:28:44] Does that cause revival?
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; When you line with this word, that's
[1:28:49] revival.
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; I want to shout. I do want I want to
[1:28:52] shout, too, but I want to shout over the
[1:28:54] revival that's happening.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; The revival is not the shout.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; The speaking in tonesues was not the
[1:28:59] revival.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; That that Come on, somebody. It was the
[1:29:02] word being restored. And they were
[1:29:04] shouting and speaking in tonesues over
[1:29:05] the word being restored, but they got
[1:29:06] their eyes on the gift instead of the
[1:29:08] giver.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; They got their they got their eyes on
[1:29:10] the man instead of the message. It's the
[1:29:12] same spirit all the way through. You can
[1:29:14] go all the way through. Amen. They they
[1:29:15] would they would follow a king instead
[1:29:16] of God. They had a prophet there. Amen.
[1:29:18] They would follow some some, you know,
[1:29:20] they would start building temples and
[1:29:21] all these things and they would do it
[1:29:23] was it was a permissive will of God.
[1:29:25] Amen. But God did not call them for
[1:29:26] that. God called them to defeat giants.
[1:29:29] God called them to overcome. God called
[1:29:31] them to be warriors. Amen. But instead
[1:29:33] of that, they wanted to organize. Let
[1:29:34] the king fight for us. Amen. He can do
[1:29:36] all the hard work. We just want to be in
[1:29:38] his kingdom. And the next thing you
[1:29:39] know, they lose all the fires and the
[1:29:41] anointing of the previous generation. I
[1:29:44] want you to know this morning that the
[1:29:45] revival fires of the message have not
[1:29:48] died out. I mean, it's still very much,
[1:29:50] very much here. And if you're looking
[1:29:52] for revival, you're in the right place
[1:29:54] because the word will be promoted here.
[1:29:56] The word will be presented here. Amen.
[1:29:58] This message is not going to be laid
[1:30:00] aside and talked about and used and
[1:30:02] abused. Though this message is going to
[1:30:04] be lived by somebody, it might as well
[1:30:06] be us.
[1:30:07] You say, "Brother Joel, I've seen you
[1:30:09] fall down. I've fell down a lot of
[1:30:10] times. You hadn't been around long
[1:30:11] enough to know how much I fell down."
[1:30:13] You watch me all the time, you'll see me
[1:30:15] fall a lot more. I've said a lot of
[1:30:16] stupid things and done a lot of stupid
[1:30:18] things. But I want you to know
[1:30:18] something. On the inside of me is the
[1:30:20] message of the hour. I'm in revival.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; You say, you start looking at each other
[1:30:24] and you start saying, "They're not in
[1:30:25] revival and they're not in revival. This
[1:30:26] one's in revival." They shouted loud,
[1:30:27] "They're in revival." That's not what
[1:30:29] causes them to be in revival. Amen. But
[1:30:30] this revival's got a staying power
[1:30:32] because there's no death in it. Can you
[1:30:34] say, "Amen. This church ought to know
[1:30:36] something about revival. When the going
[1:30:37] gets tough, Amen. God has still kept his
[1:30:39] word before you. God has still had
[1:30:42] somebody to stand here and present the
[1:30:44] word to you. It is not, Listen, church.
[1:30:46] It's not about being the flashiest and
[1:30:48] the best. It's about the word going
[1:30:50] forth and discerning the hearts of the
[1:30:52] people. It's the word. It's always been
[1:30:54] the word.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; It's always been the word. Every
[1:30:58] generation, every time, when the people
[1:31:00] lined up with the word, they were in
[1:31:02] revival. And and there again, let me
[1:31:05] just reiterate this. Just because you
[1:31:08] don't feel revival doesn't mean you're
[1:31:11] not in revival.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; Are you still with me?
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; I do believe we need to feel our
[1:31:18] religion.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Do I I feel like if you're
[1:31:21] just coming service after service,
[1:31:22] you're not feeling nothing, then it's
[1:31:24] time you get in revival.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; I want the church to get in revival so I
[1:31:28] can feel something. You got to get in
[1:31:29] revival.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; The word's got to come into you. And
[1:31:32] when you get excited about the word,
[1:31:35] then somebody else might feel the
[1:31:36] effects of you being in revival.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; You got to be in revival. I know
[1:31:41] everybody wants somebody else to do the
[1:31:42] shouting. Everybody else wants somebody
[1:31:44] else to do the running. Everybody else
[1:31:46] wants somebody else to do the amening.
[1:31:48] Everybody else wants somebody else to
[1:31:49] carry the load. But we have got to
[1:31:51] become one with the word. And that will
[1:31:53] anoint us to rejoice.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; Are you still with me? The rejoice ain't
[1:32:00] the revival, but we're rejoicing over a
[1:32:01] word that's been open to us. How many
[1:32:03] seen your name in the book?
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; How many can see your name and say,
[1:32:06] "Lord, I I I see it. I I I It's not It
[1:32:09] may not look like it may not look like
[1:32:11] it may not look like my checks have been
[1:32:12] signed, but but I I believe that God has
[1:32:14] placed something on the inside of me."
[1:32:16] Amen. To not just see a message a far
[1:32:18] off, but to a message has lived in me
[1:32:20] and has opened the seals to me. Can you
[1:32:23] say amen? because you didn't re you
[1:32:25] didn't receive a son of Charles and Ela
[1:32:27] Brandham, but you actually received a
[1:32:29] vindicated prophet that was revealing
[1:32:31] the very Jesus Christ to you.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well,
[1:32:39] I've received a man. I'm following a
[1:32:41] man." You can follow a man as they
[1:32:43] follow Christ. That's the only way you
[1:32:45] follow a man.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; Because every man can fail you.
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; Me,
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; you, anybody.
[1:32:53] Every one of us will. Let's just go
[1:32:55] ahead and put it that way. Put a man on
[1:32:57] a pedestal and you'll watch him fall.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; Get your favorite preacher
[1:33:04] and watch him do something you don't
[1:33:05] like one time and you lose confidence in
[1:33:07] the man. Get your confidence off the man
[1:33:09] and in the message.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you still with me? He said,
[1:33:12] "Now friends, go back with me. Where did
[1:33:16] the first revival come after death? The
[1:33:19] days when the grain of wheat had to fall
[1:33:20] into the ground, the body, the bride of
[1:33:22] Christ." He said he asked that question
[1:33:23] where was it in the where was it in the
[1:33:25] ground. He said Christ or he said Christ
[1:33:27] never organized. He just set up apostles
[1:33:30] and prophets and so forth in the church
[1:33:32] to keep it clean. But at na Rome 306
[1:33:36] years later
[1:33:39] they organized it and made an
[1:33:41] organization out of it and he said and
[1:33:43] it died. Are you still with me? Can you
[1:33:45] give me five minutes?
[1:33:47] He said, "And it laid still for hundreds
[1:33:50] of years in the dirt.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; But after a while, there came a message,
[1:33:56] the Lutheran message, and that began to
[1:33:59] grow just a little bit, just a little
[1:34:01] sprig."
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; They had been laid there dormant for
[1:34:03] hundreds of years, and then it started
[1:34:07] to blossom into maybe there was two
[1:34:09] little sprigs or a little vine. And it
[1:34:11] was Wesley. And then there came forth he
[1:34:14] said Zwingley and so forth other
[1:34:16] organizations and so forth. After a
[1:34:17] while the Anglican Anglican church and
[1:34:20] he said here comes Wesley and all these
[1:34:22] other things and the tossel looks a
[1:34:24] little more like the wheat. He said then
[1:34:25] what happened to that? It organized
[1:34:27] dried up and died and the life went
[1:34:29] right into the shuck and the shuck come
[1:34:31] forth almost perfectly like the wheat.
[1:34:34] He said it looked the same. He said but
[1:34:36] finally its folly was made manifest in
[1:34:38] the last eight or 10 years. And this is
[1:34:39] in the 1950s, 1960s, 64 I believe it
[1:34:42] was. He said the last eight or 10 years,
[1:34:44] especially in the last three years, he
[1:34:45] said, "Now what does it do? Pull away
[1:34:47] from the wheat." I want you to notice we
[1:34:49] didn't pull away from them. We didn't
[1:34:52] leave the word. They left the word.
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; Are you still with me?
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; The the the Wesleyans that were walking
[1:34:59] in the light of Wesley, they didn't pull
[1:35:01] away from anything.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; They didn't go far enough, but they
[1:35:04] didn't pull away. But the people around
[1:35:05] them, the the ones that were just
[1:35:07] feeling the effects of it, would pull
[1:35:08] away. And he said now without
[1:35:10] organization my he said my he said there
[1:35:12] here's here's a revival that's been
[1:35:13] going on. He said it's he said it hasn't
[1:35:15] been an organization start up. He said
[1:35:18] and it's anointed prophets anointed
[1:35:19] teachers so forth but why why ain't
[1:35:20] there no revival anywhere else? He said
[1:35:22] there's nothing beyond the grain. See
[1:35:24] it's bl it's back without an
[1:35:25] organization. Oh my. He said a blind man
[1:35:27] could see that it cannot organize. It's
[1:35:29] so firmly against it. It's the grain of
[1:35:31] wheat itself. The son of man will be
[1:35:32] made manifest. How many knows that to be
[1:35:35] true? The grain of wheat will come back
[1:35:36] to itself again. the son of man in the
[1:35:38] last days and there will come false
[1:35:40] impersonations of it in the last days
[1:35:42] that'll almost deceive the elected if
[1:35:44] possible. He said it look at the
[1:35:46] organization and so forth pulling away
[1:35:47] now. He said now he and he goes on down.
[1:35:49] I'm going to have to skip some of this
[1:35:50] to get done. He said now it reminds me
[1:35:52] he said here it is. He said and Mark he
[1:35:54] said uh let me get here where I can
[1:35:56] stop. Hallelujah. He said notice the
[1:35:58] anointed prophets will be false and
[1:35:59] there among it will be true anointed.
[1:36:00] How you going to tell it? By the word.
[1:36:03] He said how you going to tell it?
[1:36:04] There's going to be all kinds. There's
[1:36:05] going to be people impersonating the
[1:36:06] word. There's going to be people I want
[1:36:07] you I'm going to go somewhere here for a
[1:36:08] second and I hope you all are okay with
[1:36:10] this. There's going to be men trying to
[1:36:11] take the message and twist it into
[1:36:13] another light and say, "We're waiting on
[1:36:14] a prophet to come back." There's going
[1:36:15] to be another group of men over here
[1:36:17] saying, "Well, we're just going to play
[1:36:18] tapes only." And there we we don't need
[1:36:20] the preachers anymore. What they've done
[1:36:22] is they've literally taken the very life
[1:36:24] out of the church and thrown it to the
[1:36:26] side.
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; You say, "Oh, it's the word." Well, the
[1:36:28] word has got to live through the church.
[1:36:30] If you take away one thing out of the
[1:36:32] church, you've taken the word out of the
[1:36:33] church. Well, I play the tapes. That's
[1:36:35] the word. That's not the word. The word
[1:36:37] has got to live through people. Amen.
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; What good is a dead letter if it ain't
[1:36:43] living through you?
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; What good is the message if somebody
[1:36:46] ain't going to live it?
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; What good is Mark 16 if nobody's going
[1:36:49] to do it?
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; Are you still with me?
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; What What good is the message, church,
[1:36:53] if nobody comes into the revival fire of
[1:36:56] it? What good is it? Amen. But I want
[1:36:58] you to know somebody will somebody's
[1:37:01] going to accept this message. Somebody's
[1:37:03] going to live this message. Somebody's
[1:37:04] going to feel it. And they're going to
[1:37:06] live it. And they're going to do it.
[1:37:07] They're not going to be hearers only,
[1:37:09] but they're going to be doers also of
[1:37:11] the word of God. Brother going like
[1:37:13] this. He said, "Now notice the anointed
[1:37:14] ones, only the word will separate them,
[1:37:16] not the signs." Oh, no, they'll do the
[1:37:18] same signs, but the word is what
[1:37:20] separated them. Sure, they all
[1:37:22] prophesied. They all done this, that,
[1:37:23] and the other. Sure, that's the same.
[1:37:24] Jesus said they do the same thing, but
[1:37:26] the word is what separated them and not
[1:37:28] the signs. And I want you to notice in
[1:37:30] Mark 16, in closing, hallelujah. He
[1:37:32] said, Mark 16:15, he said, "Go into
[1:37:34] them." He said to them, "Go ye into all
[1:37:36] the world and preach the gospel to every
[1:37:37] creature. He that believeth and is
[1:37:38] baptized shall be saved, but he that
[1:37:40] believeth not shall be damned." I want
[1:37:41] you to notice something that if they
[1:37:43] believe the word, they would be saved.
[1:37:45] If you want to be saved this morning,
[1:37:46] you got to believe the word if you want.
[1:37:48] Come on, somebody. Amen. It don't do you
[1:37:50] any good to be baptized if you say,
[1:37:51] "I'll be baptized and see if it works."
[1:37:52] No, you got to believe it and then be
[1:37:54] baptized. Repent and be baptized.
[1:37:56] Repentance comes from believing the word
[1:37:58] of God. I say this morning, if you
[1:38:00] believe this word, then don't just lay
[1:38:02] it aside and say, "Well, it was pretty
[1:38:04] good for brother Brandon. It was pretty
[1:38:05] good for my friend." Amen. But it's got
[1:38:07] to come personal to you this morning.
[1:38:09] Amen. This word cannot be just something
[1:38:11] we put on the shelf and something we
[1:38:12] press play on. But it's got to be
[1:38:14] something that lives through the very
[1:38:16] bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; Are you still with me? As musicians, go
[1:38:20] ahead and come. I' I'm going to stop
[1:38:21] somewhere here. And musicians has come
[1:38:23] where I have to quit. Amen. Brother
[1:38:25] Brandon would say it like this. And he
[1:38:26] said, "Some of you people that really
[1:38:27] believe this to be the truth that we're
[1:38:28] entering another age. We're entering the
[1:38:30] rapture age." And he said, "You know,
[1:38:31] the church can't go in this condition
[1:38:32] and it can't get any better. It must get
[1:38:35] worse." How many knows that? And he
[1:38:36] said, "And it's got to get worse. And it
[1:38:38] can't go like this." See, it's got to be
[1:38:39] something. And it's moving right now,
[1:38:41] friend. It's on. The move is on for the
[1:38:43] bride. That's the truth. That's thus
[1:38:45] sayith the Lord. And he goes on, and I
[1:38:47] love this quote here in recognizing your
[1:38:49] day in its message. He said, "God
[1:38:50] created me a revival." I've read this
[1:38:52] one before, but I think it'll do to
[1:38:53] listen to it again. God created me a
[1:38:55] revival. Let me be the revival.
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "I want to be the revival.
[1:39:01] I want the revival to not just be for
[1:39:03] somebody else, but I need revival for
[1:39:05] me. I need to be the revival. I want the
[1:39:08] Come on, church." You can sit there and
[1:39:10] say, "Well, I wish I was in revival." If
[1:39:13] you want revival, all you need to do is
[1:39:14] accept the word for your hour and walk
[1:39:17] in that light. Amen. And that light will
[1:39:19] present the revival fires to you. You
[1:39:21] say, "I want to shout." Then get on fire
[1:39:23] with the word of God. Don't just shout
[1:39:24] to shout, but accept the message of the
[1:39:27] hour and let the word be born in your
[1:39:29] heart. Are you still with me? Lord, make
[1:39:31] me to hunger. Make me to thirst. Create
[1:39:33] in me, Lord, that what is needed. Let me
[1:39:36] from this hour on be thine more
[1:39:38] consecrated servant, a better servant,
[1:39:40] more blessed of you, more able, more
[1:39:41] humble, more kind, more willing to work,
[1:39:43] more looking to the things that are
[1:39:45] positive and forgetting the things that
[1:39:46] are in the past and the negatives. Let
[1:39:48] me press towards the mark of the high
[1:39:50] calling. He said it. Amen. I believe it.
[1:39:52] Amen. God created me a revival. Amen.
[1:39:54] There was a little There was a little
[1:39:55] officer. There was a little officer over
[1:39:58] in there in the Wales
[1:40:02] and some people walked and some men
[1:40:03] drove up to him and said, "Sir, we've
[1:40:06] heard of the great Welsh revival in the
[1:40:08] land. Where is the Welsh Revival?"
[1:40:11] And the officer, he's standing there
[1:40:13] swinging his baton and he said, "I'm
[1:40:16] it."
[1:40:18] He was the Welsh revival. Are you
[1:40:21] looking for revival? Become the revival.
[1:40:24] All right. You say, "I want to be the
[1:40:25] bride's I want to be in the bride's
[1:40:26] revival." You are the bride's revival.
[1:40:28] You are the bride's revival. You're the
[1:40:30] only book they're ever going to see.
[1:40:31] Come on, church. Let the revival be born
[1:40:34] in me. And let it live through me so men
[1:40:37] can see my good works. Not by me, but by
[1:40:39] the word through me. Let us stand
[1:40:42] together this morning. If anybody needs
[1:40:44] prayer this morning, if you say, "Lord,
[1:40:46] I need revival." I tell you what, I I
[1:40:49] don't know if there should be a hand in
[1:40:50] the house that's down. If you say, "I
[1:40:51] need revival,
[1:40:54] Lord. I need revival.
[1:40:57] I need more of you.
[1:41:00] I don't want just another I don't want a
[1:41:01] dead letter. I want a living word.
[1:41:05] Are you with me?"
[1:41:07] It's not okay to take this message
[1:41:12] as a pacifier
[1:41:15] and listen to it just because you think
[1:41:18] if you listen to it, it's the token.
[1:41:22] Show me that in the Bible.
[1:41:25] The word is Christ and when it comes
[1:41:28] into you, it lives through you.
[1:41:32] Are you still with me? That's your
[1:41:34] revival. How many want revival this
[1:41:36] morning? You say, "I need revival,
[1:41:38] Brother Joel. I need revival. I need
[1:41:40] revival." We all need revival. I The
[1:41:42] church needs revival, too. But we need
[1:41:44] an individual revival. Amen. I I I love
[1:41:46] a good stirring and awakening and
[1:41:48] shaking in the church. But we need a
[1:41:49] revival in ourselves to take all the
[1:41:52] trash that's in our life, all the
[1:41:54] unbelief that's in us, and wash it up on
[1:41:56] the shore and say, "Lord, create in me a
[1:42:00] revival." With your hands up and your
[1:42:02] heads bowed, say, "Lord, create in me
[1:42:05] revival. I want to be humble. I want to
[1:42:08] hunger after your word more. I I want to
[1:42:10] thirst. Lord, create in me the desire to
[1:42:14] have revival.
[1:42:16] Create in me what I have need of."
[1:42:20] With every head bowed, just search your
[1:42:22] own heart there. If you need to bow at
[1:42:24] the altar, if you need to just raise
[1:42:25] your hand in your seat.
[1:42:27] If you have anything that you have need
[1:42:29] of this morning, just worship the Lord.
[1:42:33] Say, "Revive us again that we may
[1:42:36] rejoice."
[1:42:38] With all your heads down, heads bowed,
[1:42:41] and your eyes closed. Heavenly Father,
[1:42:42] you see the needs of the people this
[1:42:44] morning. Lord, I pray something was said
[1:42:46] that would revive their hearts. Stir
[1:42:47] their hearts this morning. Lord, cause a
[1:42:49] revival not just in the church, but for
[1:42:51] every individual in the building, Lord.
[1:42:53] God, you see every sinner. You see those
[1:42:56] that are needed, Lord, that maybe they
[1:42:57] haven't accepted you this morning. Lord,
[1:43:00] I pray for the Holy Ghost to go by their
[1:43:02] way. Touch every person, Lord, every
[1:43:05] backslider, every person, Lord, that
[1:43:06] needs to be baptized. I pray you would
[1:43:08] put a desire in their heart to follow
[1:43:10] after the word this morning. Move upon
[1:43:12] this church, we pray. Move upon every
[1:43:14] individual. May you make powerhouses out
[1:43:16] of the individuals in this building this
[1:43:17] morning. In the name of Jesus, we pray.
[1:43:19] Let us sing and worship now with all of
[1:43:21] our hearts. Amen. The altar's open. God
[1:43:23] bless you. Amen. Do you love the Lord
[1:43:24] this morning? Oh, just worship him now
[1:43:26] if you believe he's here. Green
[1:43:29] anointing
[1:43:31] on every face. Go ahead, buddy.
[1:43:36] Oh, Holy Spirit

[1:44:28] grace.

[1:44:34] on every face.
[1:44:38] The Holy Spirit
[1:44:41] fall on.
[1:44:50] Oh, we'll walk in
[1:44:53] the light.
[1:44:55] It's such a beautiful
[1:44:59] light.
[1:45:01] It comes where
[1:45:04] the dew drops.
[1:45:06] The mercies
[1:45:09] are bright.
[1:45:11] Won't you shine all
[1:45:15] around us
[1:45:17] by day and
[1:45:20] by night?
[1:45:22] It's Jesus.

[1:45:41] light. Oh, it comes where

[1:45:48] of mercies
[1:45:52] they're bright. Won't you shine all
[1:45:56] around us
[1:45:59] by day and
[1:46:02] by night?

[1:46:23] light. Oh yes, it comes when
[1:46:28] the dude drops
[1:46:30] of her seeds.
[1:46:33] They are bright. Won't you shine all all
[1:46:38] around us
[1:46:40] by day and
[1:46:43] by night?

[1:47:32] the world once again.
[1:47:35] Oh, we'll walk in
[1:47:39] the light,

[1:47:45] light

[1:48:13] the world.
[1:48:17] Amen. Keith just the chorus. I'm amazed.
[1:48:22] I'm amazed
[1:48:25] that you love me.
[1:48:29] I'm so amazed
[1:48:33] that you care.
[1:48:36] It was through your preious
[1:48:39] blood I found pardoned.
[1:48:44] And my sins
[1:48:46] are washed.
[1:48:48] They're all washed away.
[1:48:52] All my sins
[1:48:54] are washed. Amen. We lift our hands and
[1:48:57] sing it to him before we go. Oh, I'm
[1:49:00] amazed
[1:49:03] that you love me.
[1:49:06] And I'm so amazed
[1:49:11] that you care.
[1:49:14] It was through your preious
[1:49:17] blood I'm now pardoned.
[1:49:22] And my sins
[1:49:24] are washed.
[1:49:26] They're all washed away.
[1:49:30] Oh, my sins
[1:49:32] are washed
[1:49:34] away.
[1:49:36] Can we give the Lord a hand clap of
[1:49:37] praise?
[1:49:41] Amen. We love the Lord this morning.
[1:49:43] Amen. Just looking forward to the
[1:49:44] service this evening. Just remember at
[1:49:46] 3:00. Amen. Let's try that song, Rise

[1:49:55] really loud. We'll sing this just a few
[1:49:57] times before we go.

[1:50:06] Rise above it all. I'm going to rise,
[1:50:11] rise,
[1:50:13] rise above it all. I'm going to spread
[1:50:17] my wings and fly away to heaven
[1:50:22] and rise above it all. Once again,
[1:50:25] before we go, I'm going to rise,
[1:50:30] rise,
[1:50:31] rise above it all. I'm going to rise,
[1:50:37] rise,
[1:50:39] rise above it all. I'm going to spread
[1:50:43] my wings and fly away to heaven
[1:50:48] and rise above it all. You're free to go
[1:50:50] in the name of the Lord. I'm going to
[1:50:53] rise,
