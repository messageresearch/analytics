lay our lay our sword down our shield down so to speak you know fight our last mind battle and what a glorious day that's going to be if you have your Bibles tonight let's open our scriptures to Matthew 26 and 26 like to say it's such an honor to be here tonight um I I I've said it before it's it's always an honor whenever you're invited to minister somewhere but it's it's really a special privilege and honor whenever the pastor has confidence in you when he's gone and a way to have you come and minister so I don't take that lightly I pray something can be said tonight that can be a blessing it is good to have my wife with me sister Loretta and my two children Ethan and Brielle also good to have sister Haven with us as she's traveling up to the to the youth camp this weekend so we covet your prayers we'll be heading that direction after service tonight so we definitely covet y'all's prayers amen Matthew 26 and 26 the Bible would say and as they were eating Jesus Took bread and blessed it and break it and gave it to the disciples and said take eat this is my body and he took the cup and gave thanks he gave it to them saying drink ye all of it for this is my blood of the new testament which is shed for many for the remission of sins can we bow our heads tonight dear gracious Heavenly Father Lord how we love you and we thank you for your grace and your mercy that you've given us father you've been so good to us Lord as no doubt there's been many wrecks upon the roads father many's in the hospital many may be sick Lord but God we're hear in health in our body father you brought us safely Lord kept us throughout the day throughout the week Lord God many times we we Overlook the little things God but tonight we're stopping and saying Thank You Lord as we come into this portion of the service father I ask that you would anoint your word Lord anoint your servant tonight God this little thought you placed upon my heart I ask that you would anoint it Lord may it may it be received by a Heart Lord and may it be a blessing to somebody in need of it tonight we ask these things in your precious name amen you may be seated tonight and I I have a simple subject but if I had a title it would be the life of the blood and brother Brandon would tell us that we live off of dead substance and he would say when we eat something something had to die before you can partake of it and he would tell us if you eat a a hamburger the the the cow had to die if you eat bacon you know the the pig cats had die and then he would say if you're vegetarian he says the plant that you eat had to die or the vegetable had to Die the the milk the bacteria had to die so we live off of dead substance naturally to live and but the same thing spiritually we have to live off something that has died and we would see through the Old Testament they would come to the Tabernacle and would slay a lamb you know and each year they would slay this lamb the blood would pour upon them and it would cover their sin but there was only a forgiveness not a remission not a separation and so it would be a cycle year after year after year they would come and slay a lamb Lord forgive me for telling a lie and the Lord would forgive them push that sin off but then the next year they would come again Lord forgive me for telling a lie the blood would pour upon them God would forgive them but it was a continuous cycle there was a forgiveness under the blood of bulls and goats but not a remission there was no separation from the sin nature the Bible would tell us in Hebrews 10:1 for the law having a shadow of good things to come not the very image of the things can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers there unto perfect it was just the shadow of a good thing to come but whenever Christ come he didn't just forgive but he brought a remission and the word remission means separated released from prison or bondage and so the blood of Christ would separate the worshipper from their sin that the cycle could be broke that if you come here on a Wednesday night saying Lord forgive me for doing this thing next Wednesday the Cycles broke you're not coming back saying Lord forgive me a year from now Lord forgive me the next year 10 years from now Lord forgive me it was the cycle of blood of bulls and goats it was that it was just a shadow but whenever the perfect come the Perfection came whenever Christ's blood was shed the cycle was broke where that nature not just be forgiven of it but there was a remission of it and I like how the Bible would tell us under the blood of bulls and goats there's remembrance of sin made for each year A Remembrance each year but then the Bible would tell us because the worshippers once purged should have no more conscience of sins so under the bull blood of bulls and goats there's a rembrance of sin each year but under the blood of Christ once purged there's not a cycle but once you are purged there was no more conscience of it so the very thing that was pushing you to sin that is now gone the very thing that is pushing you to a cycle that is now gone the very thing that was pushing you away from God once purged under the blood of Christ there was now no more conscience of it but we would see that it wasn't the literal blood of Jesus Christ but it was the life of it that would bring the remission and I believe if you fail to see the life of it all you have is a form all you have is a chemical all you have is cycle but once you get the life of it you don't have a form but you have a reality and brother Brandon would tell us you he would talk about the literal blood of Christ he says what would I do if I had the literal blood of Christ he says I would be so careful with that little cup he said I wouldn't want to spill it because it's the literal blood of Jesus but then he would stop and say but in front of me is the purchase of the literal blood of Jesus so you might not have the literal blood here but we've got the life of it we've got the product that the life of the that the blood was spilled for oh my you're more important than what you really think we're thankful for the cross but the cross did something for you it brought us separation we got to realize that this message has brought us the realities of it and that's what I love about this message it brought us out of a form into a life you know cuz there's many people thankful for the cross but what did the cross do for you right where they go around say the blood was shed but what did it do for you this message let us know that the cross is more than a crucifix but the Brandon would tell us whenever Christ was being crucified it was the releasing of God so it's more than a crucifix it's more than a story but it was the Life coming inside of a body to bring a separation oh Hallelujah and so it was God releasing his life that is bringing a separation and the Bible Will Tell Us in Hebrews 10:1 17 and their sins and iniquities will I remember no more not just forgiven you but when I look at you there's a separation when I look at you I don't see blashe when I look at you I don't see complexes when I look at you I don't see adultery when I look at you the Brandon would say when he looks at us he don't see us all he hears is a voice but he sees your representation oh Hallelujah so it don't matter what your past is it don't matter what you done how many mistakes you've committed when God looks at you he sees a separated group of people not being addicted by drugs or by pornography but he looks at somebody that is separated from the Fallen nature all he sees is the blood when he looks at you he sees the blood he sees Perfection no matter the mistakes no matter the fults he looks at you and he sees the blood oh and I like how brother brand put it consider this since it is the blood of God it is a perfect blood and if the perfect blood is loosening us from the power of bondage and defilement of sin then the loosening is perfect and complete there is now no condemnation who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect is a God that justifieth declares us righteous who is he that condemneth there it is his death gave us the blood the blood has loosened us there is now no condemnation How can there be there was nothing to be condemned for because the blood has loosed us from the sin we are free Guiltless don't listen to man don't don't listen to man listen to the word you are loosed by the blood it was a perfect blood the blood of bulls and goats wasn't a perfect blood but the blood of Christ was a perfect blood that would bring a perfect loosening a perfect remission and I like up brother the brand I'm would put it don't listen to man listen to the word you were loosed by the blood and I say let's put that on a devil on a complex on fear on insecurities you're loose by the blood don't listen to condemnation that says you did this yesterday you did this 10 years ago and you're going to be punished for it you were loosed by the blood it don't matter how far in sin he was it was the mighty hand of God coming and saying I loose you I I free you I separate you and now we stand today with no condemnation cuz there's nothing to be condemned for you know brother brandom would tell us you know if there was a man that would come up and start spreading rumors and would say you know brother brandom has a wife or he cheated he did this and he done that and he says you can come up to me and say brother Brandon I forgive you and he would say for what why are you forgiving me of I didn't do it in the first place and that's what the blood of Christ done oh once you're separated from it the devil can bring it up and say you know what you done you know you done this I did what there's a separation I'm not just Justified or Sanctified there's a separation there's a life on the inside that is keeping me upon the straight and on the narrow oh hallelujah it's a perfect blood bringing a perfect loosening oh Hallelujah so that's why we're no longer known by our own nature but we're separated from the old nature and brother Brandon would say you know we'll never be perfect in her own sight he says you'll never be perfect in my sight I'll never be perfect in your sight and then brother Brandon would say this but what about God's sight oh hallelujah what about God's sight I think if we ever get that Revelation there' be no more back biting oh I'm preaching now there'll be no more gossiping well this one done that this one did this you know what she said you may see that but what does God see oh come on now when God looks at you he sees Perfection oh Hallelujah we look at each other as human beings but when God looks at you he sees a Blood Washed spotless prde of Jesus you see now that don't give us a permission to sin come on now I'm not I'm not preaching that direction I am preaching there's a life there's a holy ghost that can come on the inside and totally Purge the conscience once purged there's no more desire conscience of say and brother Brandon would preach a message or many messages called the token and he would tell us that God showed us longsuffering and his kindness to Egypt and he and to pharaoh and all of the people brother Brandon would tell us he sent a prophet and showed them many signs and Many Wonders Many Wonders and he would show them the pillar of fire and behind those signs was a message and that message was let my people go but brother Brandon would tell us that they would not repent they ignored all of his signs they ignored his messenger they ignored the message and so now by the brand say God got tired of him I like the brand put that God got fed up with him and made a separation so now there's a separation from the make Believers and the real genuine Believers but what was going to make the separation was the life of the land you you would say that there they had to have a token that the purchase was paid for and brother Brandon would tell us that they couldn't put the lamb up there but they had to put the blood up there and the blood was symbolizing that something had died in their state cuz we know judgment was coming upon them through Egypt the firstborn were dying and you know and brother Brandon would say this that's what he was requiring that night to separate the Believers from the unbelievers the believer the worshipper was identified by his sacrifice he must apply the blood oh and he continues on to say it wasn't take and kill the lamb and set the blood out there somewhere else or keep it in a charger or take it down to the neighbors they had to apply the blood and all about that's where many of us make the mistake we fail to apply it come on now we can set in the church every day of our life but if we don't apply the life of it what's that mean brother Josh it's the Holy Ghost right come on brother brand I'm going preach the token and would say it's not the lital blood of Jesus but it's the life of the blood he would say in Egypt they had the literal blood that would upon the doorpost but today it's the life of the blood the holy ghost that we have to apply and we would see that the blood would bring a separation it was a time of judgment it was the time where where God's prophecy was coming to pass and we're living in a time where scripture is being fulfilled right the Bible would tell us there were 200 100,000 demons that has been lifted out of the river the Bible would tell us there signs and the Suns you know there there's a distress upon the nation men's hearts are failing them for fear it's a it's judgment coming upon the Earth it's Spirits going through the homes going through the streets going through the cities but you notice in Egypt the plagues wasn't for the Israelites it was for Egypt and the same thing today the plagues the spirits the complexes the insecurities that are coming upon the people today it's not for you it's for the world oh Hallelujah but what was to separate the Believers from Egypt was the blood oh and can you imagine being there whenever there were looking for something they were looking for something you know but but the Brandon would tell us that they would have to get the his up they would dip it in the blood and they would apply the blood over the doorpost of the of the house and brother Brandon would say hisp was just a common weed that was found all over Palestine and he says and that the hisp represents common faith he says you know and you and could you imagine being there in Egypt Pharaoh is looking for a doctor he's looking for something something special something big to bring the separation but all but right among them was the common weed yeah oh but there was an Insight that was given to the Believers that there's something common right among you that can separate you that can apply the token and oh my we're living in a world of chaos they're looking for a Superman that think a new president is going to help maybe more money is going to help but right among them there's a common faith that has been restored that we have picked up and are applying the token and it's bringing a separation from the Judgment that is coming upon the earth oh while the world is looking for certainty we have found certainty oh come on now right among them is a faith that is brought a certainty oh my well the world is fearing we're living in a peace well the world is in chaos we're living in a sound of mind you see it's faith that applies the token and brother Brandon would preach the token and would say the token is your ticket that the price has been paid for and you know if many if you've ever flown you have to show them the ticket right you first you have to make sure that your ticket is purchased but once you go to the airport you don't go to customs you don't go to the go to security you don't even check in your bag yet you got to go when you check back in then they give you a ticket then once you get that ticket you're eligible for all of the next steps oh come on now but before you check in you can't go to the other steps and brother Brandon would tell us we're not even off first base until we get the Holy Ghost but once we we check in and we are identified with the purchase then everything that was paid for is now given to us you know you know um I have a I have a Plex I'm just going to tell them myself you know H security always makes me nervous I don't know why I don't know if you've ever flown before you got your ticket your bag is checked in you're ready to you'd be nice you're ready to go and you get the security you know and I've even got that uh I've got that that that that pre-checking thing I don't even got to take my belt off I don't got to take my shoes off I don't got to take my laptop out or nothing all I got to do is just walk straight through and I still get nervous you know what what it is is to say my my my my my mind and my conscience is trying to get me to doubt my token trying to get me to doubt what my purchase has brought to me and that's exactly what the devil does is he comes and he gets you to doubt your token if you've got the Holy Ghost brother the brand must say that identifies you with all the Redemptive blessings that the cross paid for you oh if you need healing in your body the blood is paid for it and the Holy Ghost identifies you with it oh what the devil does he comes with nervousness and complexes and says it's not for you and you step there and you say my goodness maybe he's right and you start to second guess your token you start to second guess what God has done for you but I say tonight if your payment is paid for you can March straight through the victory you can March straight through through every complex through every insecurity through everything the devil puts in front of us because the payment has been paid for but you would see that once you identify the Holy Ghost and you're identified with it that makes you eligible for the supernatural but the Brandon would say there you are the blood the blood excuse me the blood not the blood chemistry but the token the Holy Ghost the life of the blood that comes what does the life do it comes and confirms what the token has been purchased for the token confirms what the blood bought for you the blood purchased your Redemption the token is the evidence of it oh I love that the blood purchased the Redemption but the token is the evidence of it the blood he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him with the stripes we are healed see all blood blood blood then when the token comes it shows that you've been identified with that sacrifice hey man the devil can't keep you from it all right ain't that wonderful the devil cannot keep you from it so the token confirms what the blood bought for you it purchased your Redemption then the token lets you know it is all yours and I believe that should change the way we pray we shouldn't go to prayer as just a begging God Lord please help me here please he this please say my daughter it should change our prayers and we should come before the Throne of God with boldness I've got the token healing is mine I've got the token deliverance from my loved one is mine my love on my sons my daughters my mother my father whatever it is they are mine every Redemptive blessing that the blood paid for I am identified with it but brother Brandon would say that it ain't the chemical of the blood of Jesus ain't the token but it's the Holy Ghost and brother Brandon would say in this glorious Covenant there's a difference between the blood and the life he says there's a difference he would say this he says we don't have the natural blood of Christ but we have the literal life Life of Christ he would say that whenever there was a life that would come inside of Mary and would create a blood cell and that cell would create another cell and another cell until it until it formed the man Jesus it was God inside of that man but brother Brandon would say that when the blood was shed whenever Christ was upon the cross he says the blood the chemistry the chemical blood went back into the ground it would go back to its natural elements but he says the life of it would come inside of the Believers so we don't got the the literal blood of Jesus but we've got the literal life of Jesus and then brother Brandon would say we are wrapped in the life of the blood cell with Jesus Christ and so the very same life that created the the the deity upon the Earth is the same life that comes inside of another vessel and brings deity inside of this life oh Hallelujah and that's why we are more than conquerors through Christ Jesus that strengthens us but we're living in a day they're trying to do away with the Holy Ghost hope this is okay tonight they're trying to do away with it but we would see that it's the token excuse me the connect you to the purchase but the brand going say listen close while I make these this closing remarks if Satan hands you some of this stuff like sickness you know what to do just show him the token I'm a purchase product my healing has been paid for I'm a product of God because I have the token of the Holy Ghost you cannot keep me off of this highway you cannot keep me from the from my health I present the token and show that you by his stripes I am healed here is the resurrection of Jesus Christ right in me now to prove that to you oh there is a real thing there is the token oh there is a real thing there is the token I believe we're living in a day where where where we're we're they're trying to do away with the realities of the Holy Ghost trying to do away and say it's this it's emotion and Sensation that that you can go to the far left or you can go to the far right but there's a middle of the road where there is a real token there's a real Holy Ghost there's a real reality that can change Natures that can keep teenagers that can keep marriages together and brother Brandon would say you cannot keep me off of this highway and the Bible would tell us in Proverbs 16 and 17 the highway of the upright is to depart from Evil so the highway that this blood that the Holy Ghost has placed us upon is to depart from evil or to separate there's a remission so the very that the blood has brought us to is a separation on this highway that the devil cannot get us off of oh brother Brandon would say the healing is on this highway there's a real token brother Brandon would say in another place there's a real Christian it's a living experience Pentecost is not a denomination Pentecost is an experience that anybody can have if they wish to have it it's something you can experience the Holy Ghost and so it's a living experience that put you upon this highway that every promise in the book is yours and brother Brandon would tell us that Enoch walked upon this highway and what did he do we know what happened he was translating and was raptured out of there brother Brandon would say that he knew that he was a type brother Brandon would say this here in the days of Enoch just before the blood well just before the flood when Enoch looked out there and saw Noah building away on that Ark Enoch was a prophet Enoch knew that he was a type he knew that before the flood came that he had to give an example so one afternoon he was becoming to him to take a walk and brother Brandon would say that morning when he got up he says he didn't take his normal path he took the King's Highway and he walked into his body change he walked into the Rapture and that is the same Highway that the token has placed us upon that we are walking and if we just stay upon this highway there's nothing that can keep us from every Redemptive blessing the God has given us for the Brandon would in another place he broke the veil of weariness he broke the veil of sickness he broke the veil of depression he broke every Veil and made a highway for the way fearing Men Walking Up The King's Highway that's where we are walking upon you know the token where there in Egypt didn't keep judgment from coming it just separated them from what was coming upon the Earth the token don't keep the Mind battles from coming against you the token don't keep the heartaches and the pains and the discouragement from coming against but it does separated from you that you can go through it and it does not harm you oh Hallelujah you might been fighting depression today but there's a highway that we're walking upon glory to God it's the supernatural upon this highway and we can't beat our type come on now you can't beat your type the world can't help by just acting out who their type is they can't help it but you can't help it before the word that God has given you and we would see that the reason brother Brandon would tell us the reason the people don't believe this is because the token has not been applied right that's the reason they can't believe it is because the token hasn't been applied yet yes you see uh me and brother Andrew Glover went to England a few years back now to do some meetings and we went to our layover was in Paris and we had tickets that got us through the Customs through security it got it we checked in our bags we we were all we're good we got to our gate we found the gate we sat there I think our leg over was a couple maybe three hours or so we sat there all that time you know and then they got up I said okay then you know we're we're ready to start boarding so everybody we got in the line you know we're excited we're about to we're about to make it to our destination it's been a long day we get all the way up to the ticket booth you know the the the we're getting on the plane and they says you don't got a ticket I said we said yeah we got a ticket it's right here they said no you don't got a ticket we said yeah we do we got a ticket and she says no you don't go talk to them over there we're like what in the world we had a ticket that brought us that far but then they decided to cancel our ticket and now they're expecting us to make it to our destination without a ticket and that's exactly what the devil's doing in this generation it's the holy ghost that has brought the church this far but now the devil's trying to cancel the ticket come on now it's formalism trying to cancel the Holy Ghost and now it's expect let me just say this if you try to cancel the Holy Ghost and expect your teenagers to make a Rapture it's not going to happen you can't expect the supernatural to get a hold of somebody and you're trying to bind up the service or bind up the prayer meeting bind up the pastor bind up the Holy Ghost you're cancelling the Supernatural and are expecting your children to make it inter Rapture what I say we need to do is open the floodgates of Heaven open and let the Holy Ghost loose that the Holy Ghost can walk the a set free the teenagers fill our young ones with the Holy Ghost you can't cancel it and expect it to work in their lives come on now you can't cancel it and expect it to work you know you they they only thrive in the environment that you put them in you know oh hope this is okay tonight you see this can happen in a church where we cancel it and say you know this ain't going to work and brother brand would say this how are you going to have a Revival of the Holy Ghost in people quench it bound it and they're afraid of it that's where the trouble lies that's where the trouble Lies when they're afraid of it and they try to bind it up but I say Lord we're not going to bind the Holy Ghost there's a real Holy Ghost but the brand say there's been much mocker of every phase of religion but there's a real power of the Holy Ghost that delivers the human being from the bondage of sin there's a real power of the Holy Ghost that delivers the sufferer from his suffering yeah you know there's many mockeries out there but that don't take away from the genuine I may have given this example before you know but you've never seen a a 15 counterfeit dollar bill right you've never seen a 17 counterfeit dollar bill because there's not a genuine out there but they do make counterfeit off of the genuine there's a genuine $1 bill $5 bill $100 bill and so they're taking the genuine and they're counterfeiting it and that's what the devil is doing with the Holy Ghost he's taking the genuine and is counterfeiting again just giving an emotion just giving a sensation here if you just D Dance the a you got the Holy Ghost if you do this you've got the Holy Ghost but that don't take away from the real power that can deliver the sufferer from the suffering come on now there's there there's theology out there that don't take away the power of this message come on now there there's people out there that are hypocrites that are claiming to be message Believers but back don't take away the power that this message has brought us brother the brand would say the counterfeit just proves there's a genuine so if you see mockeries that just means there's a reality that we can have in our church oh not just at a Revival you know we just came through y's meetings and we seen the power of God move I was blessed by it but don't just stop there the same Holy Ghost can come in a Wednesday night meeting and a Sunday morning a Sunday night it don't matter who's preaching it's the power of the Holy Ghost that can come inside of the life inside of a building inside of the temple inside of your bedroom your home it don't matter what's happening it's the life of the blood oh that's what we need today is the life it's an expectation God I'm expecting to see you I'm expecting to see you you know but the Bible would tell us that the the the Propet say start making ditches start digging ditches we don't know how it's going to happen they dig the ditches I don't know how my children's going to be saved I'm digging the ditches come on now you know brother Brandon was saying the token I was listening to it today and he would say apply the token to your brothers apply the token to your mother he says apply the token and then he you know what else he says then he says then kick out the shorts yeah he says kick out this kick out that and other words you've got to be separated before you expect them to be separated oh I'm preaching now oh you you know too many times we come up and say Lord please tell my or save my son save my mom save my wife but what about you come on now for the random says you can apply it but then you've got to kick some things out as well and I say Lord refill me with the Holy Ghost that when I go to intercede there's nothing that is keeping me from pushing through to the throne of God oh the Bible say come before the Throne of God with boldness if our heart condemn us not then we have boldness to enter in right you can't come and intercede for somebody if you're under condemnation come on now you can't come and intercede and say God please deliver them but you know yourself that you're bound but once you get set free from the complexes the insecurities then there's a real intercession the starts to take place God save my daughter save my mom what is it there's a separation yeah oh Hallelujah I'm digging the ditches we're digging the ditches I don't know how the water is going to come but we're going to wake up and see the miracle and I believe the Bible would tell us that the ditches filled themselves I think I think that when they started to dig down water started to come up and sometimes you got to dig through some things you've got to dig through some pride you got to dig through some Rebellion you got to dig through some heart feelings through some bitterness through some gossip but underneath all of that dirt here the Revival yeah right oh we make we're digging ditches yeah oh Hallelujah but we would see that how come it's this last day in the end time that the the the Holy Ghost has come under Fire so hard but the brandom would say the lamb was killed in the evening time after being kept up for 14 days then the lamb was killed and the blood was applied in the evening time so it's in the evening time that the the blood is coming to full effect because the Bible would tell us that the blood of Jesus speaks better things than that of Abel right the blood of Abel spoke condemnation yeah it was God coming and saying Cain where's your brother am I My Brother's Keeper well his blood cries out against you so it was the blood of Abel that cried out against against Cain but the blood of Christ don't cry out against you it cries out for you and brother Brandon would tell us that the blood the voice of the blood the blood has a voice and the voice of the blood is the word so it's the word that has been restored in this last generation that is speaking to you speaking for you but the token that is applied it connects you with what the blood is speaking oh Hallelujah you notice whenever you know I just love it whenever I'm sitting in a church service and the preacher gets up and he starts preaching or or I'm listening to a tape at work and something just connects and I say man that's for me has that ever happened to y'all before where you're listening or or you're reading a scripture and something just connects it's the life of the blood the Holy Ghost connecting with the voice of the blood and saying that is for me you see without the Holy Ghost brother Brandon will tell us he says without the Holy Ghost you got a cow inside of the tree you remember on top of the tree eating apples he says you're going to get your picture all messed up he says the word is like a jigsaw puzzle he says without the Holy Ghost you can't get all the pieces lined up but with the Holy Ghost all the pieces start to come into place and you see brother Brandon would tell us this here that's the life that is in you speaks from the shed blood amen oh brother I wish everybody could see it if you can see what it is it's the life that's in you see the blood is identifying you with it it's the token the blood shed for you you've accepted it and the life is coming to you that is the token yes oh it's identifying you with him so whatever the blood speaks the token enforces whatever the word speaks them the token enforces brother Brandon would tell us and he says in court whenever the court excuse me whenever the whenever the court writes out a word and says the penalty is such and such or the verdict is such and such but the Brandon would say then the law of the Court enforces the word of the court so there's a power behind it that starts to en enforce the word of it and when God says something then the Holy Ghost enforces it it's not us just saying Lord I'm quoting the scripture you know I'm quoting the scripture nothing takes place it's God coming behind the scripture and enforcing it in every one of our Lives no matter the conditions no matter what the the the things around us if the token has been applied everything the blood speaks is now for us and brother Brandon would say this apply the token and claim your rights shake it before Satan I just love that claim your rights then shake it before Satan he would say go when you go to prayer Pray with your token up in other words that token is a representation that your prayers is going to the throne of God cuz the devil can't get through your token you know brother Brandon would say this that the devil don't the devil's not how did he put up he the devil don't make you do anything because if the devil can get into you he's got to be baptized he got to be he's got to repent be baptized then receive the Holy Ghost and then he's your brother right he can't get through that token he can't get through it so whenever you go when you pray when you intercede when you come to church you've got the token up the devil can't get through that token and that's what brother Brandon was saying take the token apply the token and shake it before Satan cuz he cannot get through that token oh brother brand I'm G say this heal every one of these Lord Heal everyone that is setting present that is sick who are you sickness who do you who do you think you are Satan who do you claim to be every claim that you have was canceled at Calvary you are a bluff you have no rights we defy you in the name of Jesus Christ as a holy ghost filled body I like how he he he named sickness but we can put anything there sickness who are you who do you think you are Satan who do you claim you see just he can only claim he he can only come important wishper the Bible will tell us he's roaming like a a Roman lion seeking whom he made you brother Brandon will tell us he's a lion with no teeth he can't even get to you who do you claim to be every claim that you have was cancelled at Calvary and we would see before the life of the blood the devil had claims on the marriages right we're living in a day we're living in America there's a high percentage of every marriage is eting up a divorce there's a high percentage whether the te teenagers are upon drugs there's a high percentage that that that teenagers are going to smoke cigarettes it's a claim that the devil has upon teenagers upon marriages but the token breaks that claim and says no you don't got a claim on it I got a claim on him and oh my that's a reality not just something we can preach about but it's a reality that every claim that the devil had Upon Our Lives has been broke by the brand would say this it speaks of resurrection and life it's speaks of healing it speaks of Joy it speaks of power it speaks of life it speaks of Heaven the same blood that was shed upon the ground the C out after his dead brother or C out after his brother that had killed him the blood of Jesus Christ covers all of our sins and speaks peace resurrection power life healing all of the Redemptive blessings that the blood was shed for it speaks for us certainly the blood speaks and could you imagine being there in Egypt you know judgments coming to the city and the Bible would tell us and in Exodus 12:23 for the Lord will pass through to Smite the Egyptians and when he seeth the blood upon the Len and on the two sides of the posts the Lord will pass over the door and will not suffer the Destroyer to come into your houses to Smite you the Destroyer was coming through the city but because of the blood he would not suffer the destroying we know the the the Bible would tell us that he created the blacksmith that he he that creates he creates he he created the the the waster to destroy so the devil's just a pond in his hand right it's that God has given the devil permission to come upon the Earth and he's going through the Earth but the Destroyer cannot come to your home when the token's there that's a promise we can hang upon you know could you imagine being there in Egypt and but the Brandon would dramatizing the the little boy would come up to Daddy and would say daddy my friend just died down the road or I hear the script Dre down in that house are you sure we're safe are you sure we're going to be okay and brother brandom you know he tell us they would daddy would get the boy would come out to the would look out the window and say you see the blood right there yes you see the blood the Destroyer can't come into our homes the Destroyer cannot come into our homes because we have the token and then that would give an assurance to the Next Generation that the tokens applied oh we've got something we can give to our children yeah right we've got say in a day of Chaos in a day of negativity there's a positive gospel but the brand would say it's a positive token it's a positive token in the day of negativity there's something positive that is going to take us through you know brother Brandon would preach a message called the teaching on Moses and he would talk about uh jocked and amram and he would say that whenever that whenever the the the soldiers were coming up and killing all the baby boys right y'all remember the story and brother Brandon was say that they would come and knock on knock on Moses's house and would say we know you got a baby in there and Moses brother Brandon would say amran would say no we don't got one they said oh yeah we hear it in there and brother brandom says they will look and say we don't have one for you to have and all that just did so did something for me as a parent we don't have one that you can take go to the next house go to the neighbor's house but there's nothing I'm not going to give it to you brother Brandon would say then they would push thems and side of the door but there was a hiding place that they would put Moses that they could not find Moses and oh my there's a posi of token there's a hiding place there's a sure dwelling place but the Bible would tell us it's a Peaceable habitation that whenever they come against our homes comes against our families there's a positive token that would say no we've got children but you can't have him I've got a sister you can't have him I've got a daddy but you can't have him I've got a marriage but you can't have them there's a token for the brand of is saying you that's been truly baptized into the the Holy Spirit you have the token to display you have a right to every redemp the blessing that God has promised everything that he promised it is yours hold your token over your unwavering pray unwavering Faith as you pray over his word faith in his word yes sir H you token when he pray When you pray brother the brand I'm going talk about the rainbow it would say God gave a rainbow as a token and he would say and God has remembered that rainow token and he says it's thousands of years later but that that rainbow God puts that rainbow there that we can look at it and know that God honors his token and I just love that because it's a natural rainbow a natural symbol but what about spiritually if he remembers the Earth if he remembers the rainbow he's going to remember you and yeah and what is so incredible about the rainbow when does the rainbow appear in the storm yeah just during the lightning or the or the the Thunder maybe an earthquake or you know whenever whenever the rain's coming down that's when God shows up and reveals to you I remember I know it may be dark I know the lightning might be flashing I know the rain might be falling in your life but I remember the token and oh my that's when God shows up many times is when we the darkest of the darkest when we're at the lowest of the lowest when we feel like we can't go any farther when we feel like we can't press on anymore that's when God shows up and says hey I remember the token I remember the token I promised I'll never leave you I promised I'll never forsake you Mom I know you may feel tired mama I know you may feel like you're at your wit in but I remember the token I remember the token I promised I'll never leave you but I'll be with you even in you till the end of the world if I remember the rainbow I'm going to remember you if I remember the birds I'm going to remember you yes sir oh my that's when God shows up you know and then and brother Brandon will talk about we talk about Rahab would say then we pray we must have the token to present with our prayers as I said now believe for ourselves and apply the token to the whole family like in Egypt or Jericho or either in Acts 16-31 we find out that the Apostle Paul told the Romans and Syrian say believe thou and On th and all thy house shall be saved apply it to your family if you've got an unsaved child lay the token right on top of him say Lord God I claim him stay right there if you got a mother or loved one that's lost lay the token on them and say God Lord God I lay claim upon them present the token with their prayers and lay claim upon them it was RAB that would say not just for me but for my mother not just for my mother but for my father and it's so powerful there in Joshua 2:12 the Bible would say now therefore I pray you swear unto me of the Lord since I have showed you kindness that you will also show me kindness unto my father's house and give me a true token a true token I don't want to knock off give me a true token and the the next verse Joshua 2:13 and that you will save aive my father my mother my brother my sisters and all that they have and deliver our lives from Death she did a want some watered down religion right come on now she didn't want some watered down Religion she didn't want just just a sensation or or just a or just a tape player she wanted a true token oh and I believe that's our desire Lord give me a true token not just for me but for my loved ones for my sons for my daughters for my sister and you know why she wanted this token because she had already seen the supernatural inaction the Bible would tell us whenever the spies would go into the into Jericho that she would tell them we have heard how you did this you split the Red Sea how you killed the sons of anoch we have heard these things and now the are the the the the the men of the city their heart is failing them now and then she would say give me a true token she knew that the same Supernatural God that brought him through the Red Sea with this true token would bring her through every Red Sea right oh Hallelujah not just me what going to bring my father through every Red Sea it was a the token that was going to bring her and brother Brandon would say in him is all sufficiency that we have need of so in this token is everything that is going to take us all the way through let the musicians come tonight it's speaking of it brother Brandon would say this the true token of the blood speaking out speaks of a living resurrected presence of Jesus Christ it speaks of a living resurrected presence not a presence of yesterday but a presence of today oh Hallelujah but it's a positive token brother Brandon would say there's no devil can stand before there's nothing can stand before it because God has accepted it and if you hold a token in your hand the price is paid oh it's a positive token it's a positive token you know and brother Brandon would talk about how Oswald he says could you imagine being Oswald sitting in his cell knowing you just killed the president and he says now there's no attorney that going to take your case so there's nobody you killed the president all the attorneys are mad at you all the the crowd is mad at you the the judge is mad at you he says nobody's going to take your case and then later on in that sermon he would say now you're at the C you're at the judge you're at the court he says you're guilty and you know you're guilty the judge knows you're guilty the the the the the everybody in that courtroom knows you're guilty and he says if you're sentenced he says you're going to die with a death penalty you're going to die be an electric chair or whatever it is he says but if you can just get an attorney he says but when you get that attorney he says then you can relax a little bit because now somebody's speaking for you but he says you can't relax all the way because now that attorney has to has to convince them that you're innocent you know brother Brandon would say this that he says now that attorney has to get up with all of his smarts all of his intellect all of his Brilliance and he's got to speak for you and that just really spoke to my heart he's got to get up and his speech his voice has got to outweigh the verdict and I thought oh my brother Brandon would sa the judge became your attorney so it didn't matter what was held against you the voice his voice was stronger than the condemnation oh Hallelujah it was something positive that in the midst of the negativity we can relax because there was something positive the Bible would say we have a a more sure word of Prophecy a sure word it's something positive it's something that when we're in the midst of trouble in the midst of negativity the Bible would tell us that that the king Bazar was troubled youall remember the story and his countenance has changed and I think my word the Bible would tell us we're troubled on every side but yet not distressed we're troubled but we're not distressed and the Bible says that the King was troubled and that troubless was changing his countenance and the Bible would say say that the king the queen his wife would say but husband there's a man here that has an excellent spirit that can dissolve the doubts and I thought my goodness it was a prophet brother Brandon must say what is the prophet today the Holy Ghost it's an excellent spirit that is here Among Us that can dissolve the doubts even in the troubless even in the troubled hearts that's where the devil wants to get us is trouble our hearts trouble our emotions then that starts to change our countenance it starts to change our belief system it starts to change you know if if you if you look at somebody a different way they didn't change but the way you see them changes right if I didn't know but the Joel too very well and somebody came up to me and says you know he's got two wives I would say what I don't think he does but since I don't know him the question's going to be there right and even though it's not true he didn't Chang but the way I look at him changed now I'm going to treat him different he's still getting up and working normally he's getting up and drinking us coffee reg his life didn't change but now I'm changing I'm looking at him different and if a troubled heart can come and get you to look up this word differently the word didn't change the way you see it has changed but there's a spirit Among Us there's a genuine holy ghost that can come and and heal the troubled heart that can come and dissolve the doubts oh brother Brandon mat tell us said that our faith in the word of God is like a chain and it's carrying you over the fires of hell and he says that chain is strongest out its weakest length and then he would go one and he would say if you've got if something's puzzling you in the word of God and it's qu there's a question there he says fortify it don't allow that to be a weakness oh my I love that don't allow that to be a weakness questions are normal right questions are nor when you listen to tapes going to have a question but don't allow that question to trouble your heart don't allow the devil to come and say see I told you the message ain't right fortify that question and say oh no but the brand going tell us we've got the answer to the devil's question so it don't matter the trouble heart tonight it don't matter the situation tonight it don't matter the circumstance maybe you've had the worst day of your life there's an excellent Spirit here there's a spirit here that can come and heal every hurt heart every trouble heart do you believe that tonight let's bow our heads their gracious Heavenly Father father Lord I know this was simple tonight Lord but God maybe there's somebody here that don't have the Holy Ghost but Lord may they realize that they have to have it Lord may they get desperate for it maybe there's somebody here that has the Holy Ghost but they've got a cold on you Lord maybe they're like David restore unto me the joy of my salvation your Prophet would tell us he didn't lose his salvation he lost the joy of it maybe there's somebody here that has lost the joy of it Lord whatever situ whatever case they may be at Lord if it's somebody here that has a troubled Heart Lord I ask that you would come Lord with your excellent spirit and resolve the doubts may they fortify that question father Lord we love you father Lord as we feel your
