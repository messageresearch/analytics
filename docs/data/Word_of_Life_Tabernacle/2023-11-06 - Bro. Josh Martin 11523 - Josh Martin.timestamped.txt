[54:05] it's good to see all of our friends good
[54:07] to see the shamal it's been a little
[54:09] while so it's good to see y'all again
[54:10] God bless you it's good to have my wife

[54:15] right back there we got a two-month old
[54:17] baby and so we we've been on the road
[54:19] for about six weeks and so we've we've
[54:22] had a a good time so
[54:26] I know the Lord has many blessings for
[54:27] her but being yeah it's wonderful thank
[54:30] you being an evangelist wife she has to
[54:32] make a lot of sacrifices so I want thank
[54:35] the Lord for her tonight but Matthew 24
[54:37] and 24 for there shall arise false
[54:40] christs and false prophets and shall
[54:42] show great signs and wonders and so much
[54:45] that if it were possible they shall
[54:47] deceive the very elect and I just like
[54:50] how he puts that if it were possible
[54:52] behold I have told you before when
[54:55] wherefore if they shall say unto you
[54:56] behold he is in the desert go not forth
[54:59] behold he is in the secret Chambers
[55:01] believe it not for as the lightning
[55:03] cometh out of the East and shineth even
[55:05] unto the West so shall also the coming
[55:08] of the son of man be for wheresoever the
[55:10] carcass is there the Eagles will be
[55:13] gathered together amen can we bow our
[55:15] heads tonight dear gracious Heavenly
[55:17] Father Lord what an honor and a
[55:19] privilege it is to come into your house
[55:21] Lord God as we we heard your word this
[55:24] morning God I was blessed by it father I
[55:26] trust each one of us can Lord take it to
[55:29] our our our places our homes Lord and
[55:31] apply it father but Lord this is a new
[55:34] service a new opportunity God I ask that
[55:37] you would come in a special way tonight
[55:39] I know we're all tired and weary and
[55:41] body Lord but Lord may we push it aside
[55:44] tonight Lord and receive what you have
[55:46] for us tonight father Lord may we never
[55:48] take for granted God the times that we
[55:50] have to come into your presence father
[55:53] we ask these things in your precious
[55:54] name
[55:55] amen you may be seated and if I had a
[55:58] subject tonight it would be attracted by
[56:01] the voice and brother Brandon he
[56:03] preaches on The Voice and I was
[56:04] listening to it this morning and he was
[56:06] he was talking about there's many
[56:08] different voices there politics have a
[56:10] voice he says your spouse could have a
[56:13] voice he says Hollywood has a voice
[56:15] there's many different voices you might
[56:17] not hear uh uh the literal voice but
[56:20] they're influences there's many
[56:22] influences that can come and attract
[56:24] your attention but the Bible is letting
[56:26] us know we're not going to listen to any
[56:29] voice but it's got to be a scripture
[56:31] voice we're not just following anything
[56:34] but where the carcass is there the
[56:36] Eagles are going to be gathered together
[56:38] in other words it's going to be Eagle
[56:40] food that's going to attract you not any
[56:43] voice will do it but the devil is going
[56:45] to try to do anything he can to get you
[56:47] away from the carcass brother Brandon
[56:50] would say Jesus said about Satan he has
[56:52] no part in me and I have no part in him
[56:55] the devil would like to prove that
[56:56] different but he cannot so he cannot
[56:59] make you serpent seed he can't make you
[57:01] a foolish virgin but what he will do he
[57:04] says this so he does all that he can do
[57:06] to destroy the confidence in the word
[57:09] and so he can't make you serpent seed
[57:12] but what he would do is get different
[57:14] voices to influence you away from the
[57:17] attraction and we know what brother the
[57:19] brandom continues on to say but when the
[57:21] church dis believes Satan and believes
[57:24] the spirits of revelation of the word
[57:26] the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against
[57:29] her so he painted the dark picture that
[57:31] Satan's going to come after you to get
[57:33] you away from the word but at the same
[57:36] time he gave you a promise that if you
[57:39] will get away from the influences of the
[57:41] world and the voices of the world and
[57:44] receive the Revelation that the spirit
[57:46] has brought in this generation the Gates
[57:48] of Hell will not Prevail against you and
[57:51] I believe that was a prophecy for your
[57:53] life and that prophecy has got to come
[57:55] to pass there will be somebody that's
[57:58] embracing the voice in this generation
[58:01] and you will have an overcoming power
[58:03] but I believe we're living in a day of
[58:05] convenience we have every option out
[58:07] there you go to buy a car and you have a
[58:09] red car a blue car a purple car a pink
[58:12] car you have different models different
[58:14] shapes a van a truck a car there's many
[58:17] different options out there you go to a
[58:19] restaurant you have a menu with
[58:21] different options it's a day of
[58:23] convenience but the same thing is
[58:25] happening in the Supernatural if you
[58:28] don't like what's being preached today
[58:29] you can go down the road and go to
[58:31] another church or go to a Baptist Church
[58:34] in a Pentecostal Church there's many
[58:36] options out there and what the only way
[58:39] we can determine what is the right one
[58:42] is by the word of God I believe we've
[58:44] got a guide book in this
[58:46] generation the Bible we every belief
[58:48] system that we have today can go right
[58:51] back to the Bible so no matter what
[58:54] organization we come from or come out of
[58:56] there's something that we can agree upon
[58:59] that's the word of God if not we're in
[59:01] the wrong voice but if we're following
[59:03] the right voice it will always go right
[59:06] back to scripture but the brandom says
[59:08] this and the reason that the church is
[59:10] in the condition that it is in is
[59:12] because there are so many voices out
[59:15] there so many other the voices to
[59:17] attract the church from the voice of God
[59:20] so not only not the voice of God Is Not
[59:23] the Only attraction there's many other
[59:25] attractions out there but what are you
[59:27] attracted to but I believe that we're
[59:30] not just here hoping to find something
[59:32] but there's something on the inside that
[59:35] is looking for the supernatural we're
[59:37] not just guessing and hoping we're going
[59:39] to make a Rapture but there's an
[59:41] attraction on the inside that has looked
[59:43] up the voice and says this right here is
[59:47] a rapturing faith this right here is my
[59:50] way out of here we're living in Gloom
[59:52] we're living in chaos we're living the
[59:54] the world's falling apart but there's a
[59:56] hope for the bride of Christ that's
[59:59] inside of the voice in this generation
[1:00:02] oh my we look at the world there's gays
[1:00:04] there's lesbians we can look what's
[1:00:06] going on in Israel there's riots in
[1:00:08] America about what's going on in Israel
[1:00:10] people's taking up for what's going on
[1:00:13] over there for taking up for Hamas and
[1:00:15] these things we can look and think my
[1:00:17] the world is hopeless but at the same
[1:00:19] time there's an assurance in the bride
[1:00:22] of Christ that the gates of hell is is
[1:00:24] not going to Prevail and I think we can
[1:00:27] look at Israel but no matter who turns
[1:00:29] against Israel Israel's going to win
[1:00:31] that war it's been prophesied that
[1:00:34] Israel is going to win if that's the
[1:00:36] natural people of God what about the
[1:00:39] Supernatural come on now what about his
[1:00:41] bride if they cannot be defeated what
[1:00:44] about you you can't be defeated no
[1:00:46] matter what comes against you what
[1:00:49] Spirit what nothing that comes out of
[1:00:50] the gates of hell is going to Prevail
[1:00:53] against you because you've been promised
[1:00:56] to overcome but brother Brandon
[1:00:58] continues on to say that it tell it's
[1:01:00] very doubtful that many people would
[1:01:03] hear the voice of God though would spoke
[1:01:05] in their midst they perhaps wouldn't
[1:01:08] even understand it because it would be a
[1:01:10] foreign thing to them they got
[1:01:12] themselves so much centered on the
[1:01:14] voices of the day so he's telling us
[1:01:18] that the voice ain't is not going to
[1:01:20] speak but it's going to speak but
[1:01:22] because of the other attra actions it
[1:01:25] will be a foreign thing to us oh my but
[1:01:28] I believe there's somebody that is
[1:01:30] focused on the right thing you see what
[1:01:32] the Brandon would say and the voice of
[1:01:34] God in the last days and it become that
[1:01:36] way again today that the voice of God
[1:01:38] there are so many other voices then if
[1:01:41] God promised that he would give us that
[1:01:44] and if other voices contrary to the
[1:01:46] voice of God then it must be the voice
[1:01:48] of the enemy to confuse us that we would
[1:01:51] not understand the voice of God when it
[1:01:54] spoke spoke and so that's that that
[1:01:56] that's the booby trap of the devil is to
[1:01:58] bring confusion the message didn't come
[1:02:01] to bring confusion it come to bring It
[1:02:04] come to bring the answers and I believe
[1:02:06] that we've been called out but we're not
[1:02:08] just called out but we're placed into
[1:02:11] our inheritance you see but we got to
[1:02:13] make sure we're following the right
[1:02:16] thing the Bible would tell us in
[1:02:17] Colossians 2 and8 beware lest any man
[1:02:20] spoil you through philosophy and vain
[1:02:23] deceit and after the tradition of men
[1:02:26] after the rudiments of the world and not
[1:02:28] after Christ he's letting you know they
[1:02:31] can have a Ministry they could have an
[1:02:33] anointing but if it's not pointing you
[1:02:35] to the right thing you better not follow
[1:02:38] it come on now we got to make sure we're
[1:02:41] following the right thing but you see
[1:02:43] it's a pressure of the day to push you
[1:02:46] away from the voice of God you see the
[1:02:48] word pressure means uh the the
[1:02:50] persuasion and influence and
[1:02:53] intimidation to make someone do
[1:02:55] something so we can see the pressures of
[1:02:58] leard deia is that gets you to get away
[1:03:01] from the word of God like I said earlier
[1:03:04] that our belief system must come back to
[1:03:06] the Bible and it's pressure that comes
[1:03:09] and gets you away from the doctrines of
[1:03:12] the Bible and if somebody's leading you
[1:03:14] away from the Bible it's the false voice
[1:03:17] but the message of Malachi 4 has brought
[1:03:20] us back to the Bible oh Hallelujah you
[1:03:23] see the Bible with tell us that it will
[1:03:25] be a dark dismal day but at the same
[1:03:27] time I promised that there will be light
[1:03:30] in this generation but it shall come one
[1:03:32] day which shall be known to the Lord not
[1:03:35] day not night but it shall come the past
[1:03:38] that in the evening time it shall be
[1:03:40] light and I believe we're living in the
[1:03:42] light of God's word in Psalms 119 and
[1:03:45] 105 Thy word is a lamp under my feet and
[1:03:49] a l unto my path and I just like how
[1:03:52] David is putting that he's making and a
[1:03:54] personal it's a light unto my path it
[1:03:57] might not be their light or their light
[1:03:59] but I'm making it a personal revelation
[1:04:02] to me and I believe that can be your
[1:04:04] conviction tonight it's my light it's my
[1:04:07] Revelation though this one Falls away
[1:04:09] that one Falls away this one backslides
[1:04:11] this message is my Revelation this
[1:04:14] message is my ti poost hey you see wow I
[1:04:18] started studying on these things and
[1:04:19] many people I hope this is okay brother
[1:04:21] the being have a problem with headship
[1:04:24] but they don't realize that headship has
[1:04:26] two parts it's a meeting yourself too
[1:04:29] but at the same time the responsibility
[1:04:32] for your well-being goes on to who
[1:04:34] you're submitting yourself to you can
[1:04:36] take a marriage like we just hearing
[1:04:38] something this morning when before me
[1:04:39] and my wife was married she had to work
[1:04:42] she had to buy her own clothes she had
[1:04:44] to provide her own way but when she
[1:04:46] submitted to my headship her
[1:04:49] responsibilities become my
[1:04:51] responsibilities no longer is she having
[1:04:53] to to work she's not having to pay for
[1:04:56] her own clothes her own food but now I'm
[1:04:58] providing the way for her well-being oh
[1:05:01] that's the same way it is with the
[1:05:03] message of the hour many people don't
[1:05:05] like to submit to it because it's an
[1:05:07] absolute but at the same time it's a Ty
[1:05:10] poost oh my your responsibility becomes
[1:05:13] its responsibility then the pressure is
[1:05:16] off you're not trying to make a Rapture
[1:05:19] in your own ability but now it's the
[1:05:21] message of the hour putting you in a
[1:05:24] position oh Hallelujah you're not trying
[1:05:27] to make the body change in your own
[1:05:29] ability but now it's the responsibility
[1:05:32] has become the word of God's
[1:05:35] responsibility oh that should make
[1:05:36] somebody happy that we're not having to
[1:05:39] do this in our own ability but what
[1:05:42] we're following is leading Us in the
[1:05:44] right direction oh Hallelujah I don't
[1:05:47] care what the world is doing but this is
[1:05:50] my direction brother brandom says in
[1:05:52] everything give the word test how do you
[1:05:55] know you got the Holy Ghost he says give
[1:05:57] the word test in every situation he says
[1:06:00] give the word test and if it don't line
[1:06:02] up with the word it's the wrong voice
[1:06:05] you know I was in Montreal this last
[1:06:07] year I believe at an airport and I
[1:06:09] started to talk to some Mormons and I
[1:06:11] never knew what Mormons believed you
[1:06:13] know I I I just never never talked to
[1:06:15] them but I my my plane got delayed oh
[1:06:18] actually they they lost my luggage so I
[1:06:20] had to stay overnight there at the
[1:06:21] airport and I was just tired out and I
[1:06:24] got there at 4:00 in the morning getting
[1:06:27] through customs and I there there was
[1:06:28] three Mormons that come up to me and
[1:06:30] started to talk to me and I didn't
[1:06:32] really want to argue with them so I was
[1:06:34] just listening to what they got to say
[1:06:36] and they said you know after Christ was
[1:06:38] crucified and he went back to Heaven he
[1:06:41] come to America and he preached here in
[1:06:43] America and I thought my like I said I
[1:06:46] was tired I didn't want to argue with
[1:06:47] him and I just said where's the
[1:06:49] scripture for it they says no there's no
[1:06:51] scripture for it but I think it was
[1:06:53] Joseph Smith
[1:06:54] I think who their leader was said well
[1:06:56] it was Joseph Smith had a vision and in
[1:06:58] this Vision there was a cave and in this
[1:07:00] cave was the book of the Mormons and
[1:07:03] inside of that book gave us the
[1:07:05] revelation of what happened and I
[1:07:07] thought my but where's the scripture
[1:07:10] this says we don't got no scripture for
[1:07:11] it but in the book of the Mormons it
[1:07:13] says it here and I said well I think
[1:07:16] I'll stick with the Bible and they says
[1:07:18] well we understand the Bible a whole lot
[1:07:20] better now because of the book of the
[1:07:22] Mormons we understand Christ a whole lot
[1:07:25] more because of the book of the Mormons
[1:07:28] but then I ask where is the scripture
[1:07:30] they have their voice but it wasn't a
[1:07:33] scripture voice so you got to make sure
[1:07:36] who you're following is a scripture
[1:07:38] voice because there's no power in is
[1:07:41] something like that but with the
[1:07:42] scripture with the scripture you will be
[1:07:45] led to the King of Kings oh you can look
[1:07:48] at the wise men it was the wise men that
[1:07:50] seen the star and brother brandham says
[1:07:52] one of them says hey check the Scrolls
[1:07:55] and sees what the Scrolls says about a
[1:07:57] star and they open the scroll to numbers
[1:08:00] and it says out of je show arise a star
[1:08:03] out of Jacob and you know what they done
[1:08:05] but the brandom says they left the fire
[1:08:07] but they were sitting around and
[1:08:09] followed the star they didn't need a
[1:08:11] man-made light anymore they found a
[1:08:14] supernatural star that was backed up by
[1:08:17] scripture oh my what did that star do
[1:08:20] the Bible says they followed that star
[1:08:22] and it l them to Jesus Christ Christ and
[1:08:24] led them to the anointed but what I love
[1:08:27] about that story is the Bible says they
[1:08:29] rejoiced when they seen the star and I
[1:08:32] thought my how come they rejoiced
[1:08:35] because out of all of the astrologers
[1:08:37] out of all of the stargazers they were
[1:08:39] the only one to realize this is the star
[1:08:43] and what's the bible say that in the
[1:08:45] right hand of God was Seven Stars and
[1:08:48] those stars were angels and Messengers
[1:08:50] to each of the seven Church ages and
[1:08:52] they were to bring a message oh my what
[1:08:55] was this message to do in this
[1:08:57] generation lead you to the Supernatural
[1:09:00] come on now we're not just following
[1:09:02] some some vain philosophy but we're
[1:09:05] following something that has led us to
[1:09:07] the supernatural we can believe that God
[1:09:10] heals the sick we can believe that God
[1:09:12] still delivers and sets free of the
[1:09:15] voice that we're following has led us to
[1:09:17] the king oh my what's the Bible say
[1:09:20] whenever they went into the city they
[1:09:22] started to they the started to yell out
[1:09:24] where is he the king of the Jews for we
[1:09:27] have seen his star and have come to
[1:09:30] worship him they wanted to be led to the
[1:09:33] king what is what what is a king it is
[1:09:36] somebody with Dominion it is somebody
[1:09:39] with an authority so they knew if they
[1:09:41] could just follow the star to the king
[1:09:44] they could find the power of the
[1:09:46] Supernatural and oh my if we can just
[1:09:48] follow the star it's going to lead us to
[1:09:51] the king and we can see the supernatural
[1:09:53] we can see God Mighty in battle oh my if
[1:09:57] we can just stick with the voice any
[1:10:00] voice that you follow has got to come
[1:10:02] back to scripture brother brandom says
[1:10:04] and God has promised to meet the need of
[1:10:06] the hour he always does that and we need
[1:10:09] the voice of God to meet the need of the
[1:10:11] hour to meet the time that we are living
[1:10:14] in and after he promised it we can rest
[1:10:17] assured that he will keep his promise
[1:10:20] that's the confidence that the believer
[1:10:23] has in his maker that he promised to
[1:10:25] meet the need he says that's the
[1:10:28] confidence that we have in our maker
[1:10:30] that he is going to meet the need and he
[1:10:33] says what's going to meet the need the
[1:10:35] voice oh my the voice is going to meet
[1:10:38] the need Hallelujah and W brother
[1:10:41] brandom says this and there was a
[1:10:42] question asked here in the scripture and
[1:10:45] this morning after I left off speaking
[1:10:47] on the word of expectation to expect now
[1:10:50] I trust that you took it home with you
[1:10:52] and searched it through the the
[1:10:53] scriptures to find out what to expect
[1:10:56] God's word tells us what we can expect
[1:11:00] if we receive this word without any
[1:11:03] doubt mixed into it we will receive what
[1:11:05] we come for so he's letting us know our
[1:11:08] expectation has to be a scriptural
[1:11:11] expectation hope y hope this is making
[1:11:13] sense this evening where where the where
[1:11:16] the carcass is the Eagles will be
[1:11:18] gathered together so before the Eagles
[1:11:21] can be gathered by the carcass the has
[1:11:23] to be an appetite there has to be
[1:11:26] something attracted to the carcass and
[1:11:29] brother brandom is letting us know your
[1:11:31] expectation has to be a scriptural
[1:11:34] expectation to meet the scriptural need
[1:11:38] so before the need can be met there's
[1:11:40] got to be somebody with an expectation
[1:11:43] come on for the voice to come to you see
[1:11:46] before there was a speaker there was a
[1:11:49] need for the speaker before there ever
[1:11:51] was a microphone there was a need for
[1:11:53] the mic microphone somebody didn't just
[1:11:55] come up with a microphone and say wow
[1:11:57] what are we going to use this for but
[1:11:59] before they created it there was
[1:12:01] somebody in need of it oh and before
[1:12:04] this message over come to your life
[1:12:06] there was a scriptural expectation there
[1:12:09] was an attraction saying I need
[1:12:11] something I need something to pull me
[1:12:14] out of doubts I need something to pull
[1:12:17] me out of confusion and whenever the
[1:12:19] message come by your way it was the Deep
[1:12:21] calleth to the Deep brother the brandom
[1:12:24] says whenever Mama Eagle went by the
[1:12:26] chicken pin and there was the baby we
[1:12:28] know the story whenever the baby was
[1:12:30] there inside of the chicken pen he says
[1:12:33] he there was something that responded
[1:12:35] that that little Eagle come from Mama
[1:12:38] and since he come from Mama there was an
[1:12:40] attraction that went to Mama and he says
[1:12:43] you come from the word and whenever the
[1:12:46] word come by your path there was an
[1:12:48] attraction to it oh that's why you can't
[1:12:51] disbelieve this message you can't turn
[1:12:53] away from it because you come from it
[1:12:56] it's your identity it's who you are it's
[1:12:59] your inheritance it's your promised land
[1:13:01] it's what is guiding you you can't turn
[1:13:04] away from it oh Hallelujah there's a
[1:13:07] scriptural expectation that is waiting
[1:13:10] for something to come and I believe
[1:13:12] we're no longer waiting but her
[1:13:14] expectation has been met you see the
[1:13:17] Bible would say in 1 Corinthians 9:26
[1:13:20] therefore so I therefore so run not as
[1:13:23] certainly so I fight not as one that
[1:13:26] beateth the air and that scripture just
[1:13:28] stood out to me he's letting you know
[1:13:31] that I'm not just one beating the air
[1:13:32] but I got a direction I'm F fighting for
[1:13:36] a cause and I believe that is our our
[1:13:38] attitude we're not just one beating the
[1:13:40] air but we got something that we're
[1:13:43] pressing to obtain and brother brandom
[1:13:45] says that's what the attraction is the
[1:13:48] predestinated seed of God who can't do
[1:13:51] nothing else but follow it he said says
[1:13:53] that means more than life to us to our
[1:13:56] lives but you don't take it you don't
[1:13:58] take that what is the attraction God
[1:14:00] usual fulfilling his word he says what's
[1:14:04] the attraction God fulfilling his word
[1:14:07] is the attraction you know you can look
[1:14:09] at the natural the bar only attracts
[1:14:12] somebody who drinks the the the the
[1:14:14] casinos only attract somebody that that
[1:14:17] that that gambles and so the word is
[1:14:19] only going to attract somebody that has
[1:14:21] a scriptural expect
[1:14:23] you remember the Brandon he was walking
[1:14:25] at one of his meetings and he's seen all
[1:14:27] the license plates and him and his wife
[1:14:29] and he says what's the attraction and
[1:14:32] then he said that's where he got the the
[1:14:34] inspiration for what's the attraction on
[1:14:36] the mount he says it's the word that is
[1:14:39] the attraction and I think my we're not
[1:14:41] gathered together tonight just to hear
[1:14:44] some Bible story but we've been
[1:14:46] attracted by something that is the word
[1:14:49] of God oh my but you see it's a two-way
[1:14:52] street not only is the word coming for
[1:14:55] somebody but the word is looking for
[1:14:57] something brother the brandom talks
[1:14:59] about the woman who licked radium that
[1:15:01] were you that was used for watches and
[1:15:03] he says the woman was making watches and
[1:15:06] she licked the radium and she later on
[1:15:08] died and he said and then there was
[1:15:10] people doing some tests on her skulls
[1:15:13] and they got an instrument and put it by
[1:15:15] her skull and that instrument started to
[1:15:18] work he says it was because they got an
[1:15:21] instrument that was compatible with
[1:15:23] radium not any instrument could work
[1:15:26] with radium but with something that was
[1:15:28] compatible with that radium that that
[1:15:31] that an instrument come to life and I
[1:15:33] thought my not anything could bring the
[1:15:36] bride to life but once the word there
[1:15:38] something that was compatible with the
[1:15:41] bride of Christ the bride's Revival
[1:15:43] started to get into action and I think
[1:15:46] my this bride ain't dead but the move is
[1:15:49] on for the bride we are the Invincible
[1:15:52] Army there was something that come by
[1:15:54] your way and attracted us it says we're
[1:15:57] not meant to be in the chicken yard
[1:15:59] we're meant to be in the Heights our
[1:16:02] position is in is in the Heights with
[1:16:04] Christ Jesus Oh Hallelujah but it was
[1:16:08] something that we could recognize it was
[1:16:10] an attraction you see brother brandom
[1:16:13] says this he's an eagle to begin with he
[1:16:15] recognizes the real eego recognizes the
[1:16:19] call of God's word why he's an eagle an
[1:16:22] eagle to an eagle and he says the word
[1:16:24] before the foundation the word to the
[1:16:28] word the word predestinated to the word
[1:16:31] written for the hour yeah oh he says the
[1:16:34] word predestinated that you and the word
[1:16:37] written for the hour is word to the word
[1:16:41] it's an attraction oh my the once the
[1:16:44] two comes together it produces life it
[1:16:47] produces the Revelation for this
[1:16:50] generation hey you see I don't believe
[1:16:52] that the the the prophet was the only
[1:16:54] one with the ministry but the brides got
[1:16:56] a Ministry in this generation if you can
[1:16:59] sing sing if you can preach preach if
[1:17:02] you can play instruments play
[1:17:04] instruments you need get beyond the
[1:17:06] pressures of the world and left the an
[1:17:09] anointing come on your life and fulfill
[1:17:12] the ministry that God has given you hey
[1:17:16] you know brother brandham says the first
[1:17:17] Divine healer was David he says whenever
[1:17:21] he would play and sing songs that would
[1:17:23] drive their spirit away from Saul the
[1:17:25] first Divine healer wasn't a preacher
[1:17:28] and I thought my there's some young
[1:17:30] ladies that get complexes on them that
[1:17:32] they can't sing like that one they can't
[1:17:34] sing like that one and the devil's
[1:17:36] trying to your ministry but if
[1:17:39] you can sing push past those complexes
[1:17:42] I'm preaching now if you can play some
[1:17:44] music push past those complexes you've
[1:17:47] got to Ministry hey you look at
[1:17:49] Jehoshaphat whenever Jehoshaphat was
[1:17:52] surrounded by the by the neighboring
[1:17:54] countries and he was praying to God and
[1:17:56] the Lord spoke to him and says this
[1:17:58] battle is not yours it is mind and what
[1:18:02] did he tell Jehoshaphat to do he didn't
[1:18:05] tell him go get some Spears go get some
[1:18:07] swords go get some armor but what he did
[1:18:10] tell him to do was go get some singers
[1:18:13] come on now those singers had a Ministry
[1:18:15] that was going to defeat the enemies
[1:18:18] that was coming against him and I say
[1:18:20] this evening you don't got to be a
[1:18:22] preacher to have a Ministry if God has
[1:18:25] called you fulfill that Ministry this
[1:18:28] message has anointed you hey brother the
[1:18:31] brandom says what is the what is the
[1:18:32] bride's Ministry it's the message of the
[1:18:35] hour he says our ministry is the same as
[1:18:38] the Grooms we're speaking the same
[1:18:41] things what's the Bible say the the
[1:18:43] spirit and the bride say come the same
[1:18:46] spirit that anointed Malachi 4 is the
[1:18:49] same spirit that has come on the bride
[1:18:51] of Christ we're preaching the same
[1:18:53] things we're singing the same things
[1:18:55] we're playing with the same anointing
[1:18:58] what is it brother Josh we've been
[1:19:00] attracted to the anointed word oh my
[1:19:03] that has brought on an anointing you see
[1:19:06] if you can only recognize the anointed
[1:19:08] word for your generation you can see the
[1:19:11] anointing for that generation you know
[1:19:13] the but the brandom talks about the the
[1:19:15] the the prostitute whenever she seen
[1:19:17] Jesus at Simon's house we all know the
[1:19:20] story when she seen Jesus and she had to
[1:19:23] crawl her way to get to Jesus with the
[1:19:26] alabaster box we all know the story
[1:19:28] brother the brandom says her recognizing
[1:19:31] the anointed released to her her
[1:19:34] forgiveness and I thought wow that's
[1:19:36] powerful her recognizing the anointed
[1:19:39] freed her to fulfill her Ministry oh my
[1:19:44] many people can't fulfill their Ministry
[1:19:46] because they haven't recognized the
[1:19:48] anointed if you can just recognize the
[1:19:51] anointed that is in your midst not a man
[1:19:54] not not a prophet necessarily but the
[1:19:57] voice the message the anointed word and
[1:20:00] if that can just attract you and break
[1:20:02] off the the the bounds of psychology
[1:20:04] break off man's ideas and man's Creeds
[1:20:08] and that will give you the ability to
[1:20:10] fulfill the ministry that God has given
[1:20:13] you oh my brother brandom says this and
[1:20:16] the eagle of God eats the word of God
[1:20:18] and that alone hope this is okay this
[1:20:21] evening the eagle of God eats the word
[1:20:23] of God and that alone he says he he
[1:20:26] can't stomach that old thing of the
[1:20:27] world that's right he won't digest it he
[1:20:30] couldn't stand it anyhow he wants fresh
[1:20:33] meat he wants the freshness of the Holy
[1:20:36] Spirit the meat of God right out of the
[1:20:39] Bible right out of the Bible oh
[1:20:41] Hallelujah and so that's the what that's
[1:20:44] what the word has come to is the
[1:20:46] scriptural expectation brother brandom
[1:20:48] says then we got the Revelation in the
[1:20:51] last days the message of the hour or the
[1:20:53] message of the Lord God together the
[1:20:56] bride together no age has it ever been
[1:20:59] promised it's promised in this age oh my
[1:21:03] you you can look at Revelations 10:7 but
[1:21:05] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:21:08] angel when he shall begin the sound the
[1:21:10] mystery of God should be finished the
[1:21:14] mystery of God should be finished so
[1:21:16] whenever we recognize the voice the
[1:21:19] mystery it's no longer in a mysterious
[1:21:22] form but we've got the revelation of it
[1:21:24] you know my pastor brother wendle he
[1:21:26] took this scripture the other day and he
[1:21:28] said something I thought was wonderful
[1:21:30] he says when he shall begin to sound the
[1:21:32] mystery of God should be finished and he
[1:21:35] says how come the Bible didn't say it
[1:21:37] would be finished he says because it's
[1:21:39] only finished to a special class of
[1:21:41] people it's still a mysterious form to
[1:21:44] everybody else it should be finished but
[1:21:47] not everybody can see the mystery but if
[1:21:50] you can see the mystery the mystery is
[1:21:52] finished and I thank God I'm so grateful
[1:21:56] that you chose me to see the mystery hey
[1:21:59] you remember there in the in the Bible
[1:22:01] the the the disciples asked Jesus how
[1:22:03] come you speak in a parable and he says
[1:22:05] it is because the mystery is not given
[1:22:08] to them to know the mystery but to you
[1:22:10] it has been given not anybody is
[1:22:13] attracted to the voice but if you're
[1:22:16] attracted to it you should give God
[1:22:18] thanks you should give God glory and say
[1:22:21] I'm thankful that you have given me
[1:22:23] something to be attracted with oh
[1:22:26] Hallelujah we've been given something
[1:22:29] that that that has brought brought us
[1:22:30] out of confusion and is gathering us
[1:22:33] together you see what what what happened
[1:22:36] whenever Elijah we all know the story of
[1:22:38] Elijah whenever he says there's not
[1:22:40] going to be no rain nor duw till I call
[1:22:43] for it there was judgment upon that
[1:22:45] Nation but the same voice that brought
[1:22:48] forth judgment was the same voice that
[1:22:51] brought forth life to the the widow
[1:22:53] woman we all we all know the story the
[1:22:55] Bible says that Ahab sent out his
[1:22:58] servants to find water for his cattle to
[1:23:01] find Green Pastures for his cattle but
[1:23:03] at the same time this is going on he's
[1:23:06] at a widow woman's house that was about
[1:23:09] to eat her last meal and die but the
[1:23:11] same voice that brought judgment to one
[1:23:14] generation was bringing life to another
[1:23:17] group to another to another to another
[1:23:20] woman we see brother brandom says
[1:23:22] whenever he went and grabbed a handful
[1:23:24] of meal out of the pot he says he didn't
[1:23:27] destroy the pot but he took a handful of
[1:23:30] meal and he threw it inside of the pot
[1:23:32] of death he says he replaced the death
[1:23:35] with the life and I thought my that's
[1:23:38] that's wonderful he didn't destroy our
[1:23:40] lives but he took out the death and
[1:23:43] given us the life oh my we're marching
[1:23:46] on our way to a Rapture I believe
[1:23:48] there's nothing that can keep us from
[1:23:51] from being EarthBound any longer there's
[1:23:53] been a separation that has taken place
[1:23:56] the Bible would tell us that in
[1:23:58] Revelations 18:4 and the heard of The
[1:24:01] Voice from Heaven saying come out of her
[1:24:03] my people that you be not partakers of
[1:24:06] her sins and that you receive not of
[1:24:09] plagues what is the voice it's a message
[1:24:12] and so now there's two classes of people
[1:24:14] there's two attractions one's being
[1:24:16] attracted to the plagues and the other
[1:24:19] one's being attracted to the voice and
[1:24:21] but the brain says that is the last
[1:24:24] Angel's message is coming to the
[1:24:26] predestinated he said it's coming to the
[1:24:29] predestinated to call them out he says
[1:24:32] watch it we are in a calling out come
[1:24:34] out of Babylon my people said the
[1:24:37] Angel's voice out of what out of
[1:24:39] confusion it's this this is the
[1:24:41] Methodist right or the Baptist or the
[1:24:44] Catholic come out of it God is right he
[1:24:47] says how do you know let every man's
[1:24:49] word be a lie and M the truth come out
[1:24:52] of it so not only are we attracted to
[1:24:55] something but the voice is calling us
[1:24:58] out right hope this is okay this evening
[1:25:00] you know before you can go into
[1:25:02] something you got to come out of
[1:25:05] it many people want to go into the into
[1:25:07] the Rapture but they haven't been fully
[1:25:10] called out yet remember before the
[1:25:12] children of Israel could get into the
[1:25:14] promised land they had to come out of
[1:25:16] Egypt you may say well they come out of
[1:25:19] Egypt not a lot of them didn't how come
[1:25:21] they get they didn't go into the
[1:25:23] promised land they wanted to go back to
[1:25:25] Egypt the physical body come out of
[1:25:28] Egypt but their heart was still in Egypt
[1:25:31] but only the ones that was fully C out
[1:25:34] of Egypt went into the promised land it
[1:25:37] was a Joshua and it was a Caleb they are
[1:25:39] the ones that went into the promised
[1:25:41] land well all of the other ones we all
[1:25:43] know the story it's Bible that said let
[1:25:45] us get a captain let us get a captain
[1:25:47] and return back to Egypt the body was
[1:25:50] called out of Egypt but up their Spirit
[1:25:53] their soul their heart was still back
[1:25:55] there in Egypt but I believe we're not
[1:25:58] partaking of the things of the world our
[1:26:00] heart is not in the things of the world
[1:26:03] but our heart is in this message and
[1:26:05] that is what's placing us in our
[1:26:08] inheritance oh come on somebody I'm
[1:26:11] preaching the message now you see the
[1:26:13] Bible says in Exodus in Exodus 3 and8 I
[1:26:15] have come down to deliver them out of
[1:26:18] the hand of the Egyptians and to bring
[1:26:21] them out into a good land and to a large
[1:26:24] land flowing with milk and honey so it
[1:26:26] wasn't just bringing them out it was
[1:26:29] taking them in so this message isn't
[1:26:32] just bringing us out of leor sea it's
[1:26:34] taking us into our inheritance oh
[1:26:37] Hallelujah the Rapture is right around
[1:26:40] the corner the body change is right
[1:26:42] around the corner if you stick with the
[1:26:44] voice oh Hallelujah the same voice that
[1:26:48] called you out of confusion is the same
[1:26:51] voice that is taken you all the way to a
[1:26:53] Rapture it's the same voice oh
[1:26:57] Hallelujah is there's an attraction to
[1:26:59] the voice oh my but it's coming a way
[1:27:03] where only you can respond Remember The
[1:27:05] Story of
[1:27:06] Lazarus I'll bring this down to a close
[1:27:09] here in a few minutes Remember The Story
[1:27:11] of Lazarus whenever Lazarus had died the
[1:27:14] Bible says Jesus come to the tomb and
[1:27:16] says Lazarus come forth but the brandom
[1:27:19] says how come he didn't say come forth
[1:27:22] he says because the whole Cemetery would
[1:27:25] have come forth but he said Lazarus and
[1:27:27] so that voice spoken away where only
[1:27:31] Lazarus could respond oh come on now
[1:27:35] it's spoken away where only Lazarus
[1:27:37] could respond and this message has
[1:27:40] spoken away where only the bride could
[1:27:43] respond there's a deep calling to the
[1:27:45] Deep the seed on the inside is a part of
[1:27:48] the word oh my we look at the scripture
[1:27:51] in joural 11:39 and Jesus said take you
[1:27:54] away the stone Martha the sister of him
[1:27:57] that was dead and I want you to notice
[1:27:59] something here he is identifying Lazarus
[1:28:02] as Dead He's identifying him as as one
[1:28:06] among the dead and Jesus said unto her
[1:28:08] take you away the stone Martha the
[1:28:10] sister of him that was dead you come
[1:28:13] down to the 41st verse and then they
[1:28:15] took away the Stone from the place where
[1:28:18] the dead laid then then the then the
[1:28:20] voice the scripture says in the 43rd
[1:28:22] verse and when he had thus spoken he
[1:28:25] cried with a loud voice Lazarus come
[1:28:29] forth so his identity changed from dead
[1:28:32] to this identity that he had before that
[1:28:36] state oh what is this message done is
[1:28:39] given you the identity that you had in
[1:28:42] the mind of God you was a blasphemer
[1:28:44] here you was a sinner here you you you
[1:28:47] you was in pornography you was a gambler
[1:28:49] you was a drunk you had an identity of
[1:28:52] the tombs but once the voice cried and
[1:28:55] come by your way he did not call you by
[1:28:58] your your Earthly identity he gave the
[1:29:01] identity that you had in the mind of God
[1:29:04] oh my he took on your identity as a
[1:29:07] sinner and giving you his identity as a
[1:29:10] mage Jesus Christ oh my what's the Bible
[1:29:13] say in John 11 1144 the next verse and
[1:29:17] he that was dead come forth bound hand
[1:29:20] and foot with grave clothes and so now
[1:29:23] it's a past tense his identity is no
[1:29:26] longer dead but it was dead and now his
[1:29:30] identity is Lazarus oh and I say you
[1:29:33] once was in Creeds you was in Traditions
[1:29:35] you was in dogmas you once was in a
[1:29:38] denominational tomb but once The Voice
[1:29:41] come by your way and spoke in a way that
[1:29:43] you couldn't help but respond you left
[1:29:46] it behind and got your original identity
[1:29:50] you are bone of his Bat life of his life
[1:29:53] power of his power you are him the same
[1:29:57] Authority that he had this bride of
[1:29:59] Christ has hey I think it's time we quit
[1:30:02] living below our means and rise to the
[1:30:05] occasion and put every Spirit under our
[1:30:07] feet every torment and devil that comes
[1:30:10] against your mind comes against your
[1:30:12] family comes against your homes you've
[1:30:14] got the authority to put it behind you
[1:30:18] may say brother Josh I don't think so
[1:30:20] the story ain't over with Lazarus
[1:30:22] the story still goes on the Bible says
[1:30:25] John 11:44 he that was dead come forth
[1:30:29] bound hand and foot with grave clothes
[1:30:32] and his face was bound about with a
[1:30:35] napkin and Jesus said unto them loose
[1:30:38] him and let him go oh yeah think about
[1:30:42] that now he was brought to life the
[1:30:44] voice called him give him his identity
[1:30:47] but he still had some things of the
[1:30:48] Grave yeah come on now he still had some
[1:30:52] ideas from the grave he still had some
[1:30:54] opinions from the grave and he had to
[1:30:57] let those go but you notice how he left
[1:30:59] those go it wasn't Jesus coming and
[1:31:02] loosen him but he commissioned a
[1:31:04] five-fold Ministry come on now it was
[1:31:08] the same voice that spoke life to
[1:31:11] Lazarus was the same voice that told
[1:31:14] them to loose them and let them go come
[1:31:18] on now so now whenever the people would
[1:31:20] come up to last Lazarus they have the
[1:31:23] same Authority that Jesus had to loose
[1:31:26] Lazarus and I so I'm so thankful for a
[1:31:29] Fone Ministry that is sticking with the
[1:31:32] Voice of Truth every time your pastor
[1:31:35] gets up and preaches and you're agreeing
[1:31:37] with the word so more grave clothes are
[1:31:39] falling off he gets up and preaches you
[1:31:42] agree with the word so more grave
[1:31:44] Clothes Fall Off what is it it's the
[1:31:46] five-fold ministry that is perfecting
[1:31:49] the Saints in scripture now what is it
[1:31:52] he's not getting up and preaching his
[1:31:53] own ideas but he's taking the voice and
[1:31:56] he's preaching the voice and that is
[1:31:59] liberating you it's the voice that is
[1:32:01] taken off the grave clothes oh my how
[1:32:05] come many people can't worship and
[1:32:07] praise God because they still got grave
[1:32:09] clothes on hey I'm leaving tomorrow it's
[1:32:12] okay many people can't praise God they
[1:32:14] can't worship they can't lift their
[1:32:16] hands because they're in grave cloth
[1:32:18] still I think it's time that a Revival
[1:32:20] comes in the house of God and we can get
[1:32:23] out of those great FES and worship God
[1:32:25] lift up those hands sing praises to God
[1:32:28] it's okay to sing praises to
[1:32:31] God it's okay to lift up your hands
[1:32:34] you're letting your neighbor know you're
[1:32:35] not dead if you're alive your body's
[1:32:37] going to move and if the bride of Christ
[1:32:39] is alive you got a little bit of action
[1:32:42] you can't help but praise your hands you
[1:32:44] can't help but say Amen what is it
[1:32:47] you've been liberated from the tomb and
[1:32:49] I believe this bride has been liberated
[1:32:52] from the denominational tombs and has
[1:32:54] been given her identity the grave
[1:32:57] clothes are off oh the grave clothes are
[1:33:00] off and you can't help but Worship the
[1:33:03] Lord hallelujah it's the word amen it's
[1:33:07] the word that has brought forth a
[1:33:09] Liberation as the musicians come this
[1:33:11] evening oh my the Bible would say in
[1:33:14] John
[1:33:15] 1837 pilot therefore said unto him are
[1:33:18] thou the king then Jesus answered thou
[1:33:21] say
[1:33:22] that I am a king to this to this end was
[1:33:24] I born and to this cause I come into the
[1:33:27] world that I should not bear witness
[1:33:29] that I should bear witness unto the
[1:33:31] truth everyone that is of Truth heareth
[1:33:35] my
[1:33:37] voice everyone that is of Truth heareth
[1:33:40] my voice and I'm so glad I'm a part of
[1:33:43] that truth I've seen the voice I've
