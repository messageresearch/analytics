good to see you i see brother howard sitting on the back it's even good to see brother howard tonight every one of you i thank the lord that there's still people who believe in going to church amen first corinthians chapter 8 we're going to read from actually we're going to read first peter chapter one to start off and then we're gonna turn to first corinthians chapter eight and we'll speak from there tonight isn't the word of the lord good you all bear with us as we work on the remodel of the interior of the church and we'll let you know if any services change or anything like that hopefully we'll be able to get through it and continue to have the services the way we do and first peter chapter one and verse 22. it says seeing you have purified your souls and obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren you know what that means if we would just stop there you can't love your brother right without the holy spirit you purified your souls and obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently i pray the lord without his blessing to the word you may be seated this evening first corinthians chapter 8 is one of those chapters that we read but we really don't read we drive by it and look and we've seen it before and talks about idols and things that we don't really deal with today but i think it's much more relevant than what we realize because it speaks about our relationship with one another and with the brethren and what knowledge is i want to title this knowledge versus love we couldn't if we had paid attention to first corinthians chapter eight and i'll just speak for myself if i had paid attention to it i could have saved myself a lot of trouble in life and maybe more of us could have with all the debates that go on about inconsequential things and and we forget about what really matters and paul is is focused on what really matters first corinthians chapter 8 and verse 1. paul begins this way he said now as touching things offered unto idols now this is this is a question that paul has been asked and it is something like this isn't it true that we can eat meat offered to idols based on your doctrine of grace meat shouldn't matter you know what they were right about that and but the thing is you can be right and still be wrong and so he he kind of rebukes them for being right the corinthians just can't seem to win but he gets on to him a little bit because of the way they applied it now this would have been food left over from the great pagan sacrifices and what he's dealing with here in this chapter is is food that was left over and then either sold in the market or fed to the people directly he also deals in a different place with actually the the feasts that they would have at the temple and those were forbidden for christians that they were not to go there but they could buy the meat and and paul deals with that now it would have been much cheaper or may have been free to do that and so the people said hey why can't we take advantage of this government largesse and and have some meat that's been offered to idols because it doesn't mean anything paul says you're right but you're wrong because the way that you're doing it now the early church lived at the intersection of spiritual freedom and pagan culture and we may not think we live there today but we do we live right at the intersection of spiritual freedom and and pagan culture and so especially this time of year you begin to think about those things and see those things and realize that's where we live the culture that we live in is pagan it's not a christian culture anymore this country hasn't been a christian nation in a long time and they've turned down god and and so we live at that intersection where the world is pagan and and we live there we're in it but not of it and this this idea of not eating food offered to idols was dealt with several times in the scripture paul deals with it in romans also the jerusalem council in acts 15 decided to allow the gentiles to to remain uncircumcised but asked him not to do certain things one of the things they asked them not to do was to not eat food offered to idols and the biggest reason was to promote unity because when they would eat together the jews just wouldn't partake of that the people that had been jews that had come into the message of that day they just wouldn't be a part of it and so they asked them not to do that it's mentioned again in revelations 2 14 speaking about balaam who taught israel to eat things sacrificed to idols also in revelations 2 20 in the next church age he spoke of jezebel who did the same thing but brother branham talks about that and he said that was spiritual in the pergamian church age he said the eight things sacrificed to idols he said no i don't say that this really means they were literally eating meat sacrificed to idols for although the council of jerusalem had spoken against such paul did not make much of it as he said the idols were nothing he said it was just a matter of conscience except for it offended a weaker brother and then it was not allowed now but if you go on and i encourage you to go home and i don't have time to read it tonight for sake of time but if you go home and if you have a chance read the rest of that paragraph because brother branham talks about how that the church spiritually was partaking in spiritual idolatry and they were eating that meat sacrificed idols in that way it was it was the food the spiritual food that they were getting now in the second part then of that verse in first corinthians 8 1 it says we know that we all have knowledge now i think we could probably say that about one another we know that we all have knowledge and paul's kind of getting at him a little bit with that because paul says i agree with you we have this knowledge but they had the wrong application with it now brother branham talks about about knowledge and the way people treat one another and be not afraid of his eyes that i was called today by some of my sponsors on a meeting they called me long distance he said this afternoon a group of pentecostal ministers not baptist presbyterian but pentecostal ministers and confessed that they had believed not in divine healing and wanted me not in the city and wouldn't sponsor a meeting where they prayed for the sick he said pentecostal ministers pitiful isn't it see those quotes aren't all the way on the screen we had a power outage this afternoon so it's not my fault this time i guess it messed that up and he said i had another call that from a group that said if you let another group sit on the platform with you will have nothing to do with it well that sounds familiar doesn't it if you have a certain preacher in we won't use him anymore and and brother branham says that's worse off than ever he said what's the matter he said you've gone off without him speaking of christ we won't deal with you because you had you you said something nice about somebody we don't like it's like kids on the playground right and that's the way they were at the corinthian church right now he said he said that's worse than ever that what's the matter gone off without him the love of god in our heart constrains us to reach every denomination in every place when it gets to a spot that you can't have a tender love for every human being something's happened to you because god so loved you when you was a sinner aren't you glad he did an alien away from god an enemy of the commonwealth of god he so loved you that he gave his life for you amen he said if you get a spirit in you that you're better than someone else listen to this if you get a spirit in you that you're better than someone else then you're worse than anybody else that i know of that's pretty bad he said i don't care if you're ever so correct in your theology your motives and objectives is wrong he said i'd rather be wrong in my theology than be wrong in my heart that's right because the spirit of god dwells in your heart he said i'd rather be right in my doctrine and write in my heart or wrong in my doctrine rather than right in my heart be better to be both but he said i'd rather be wrong in my doctrine and right in my heart god will respect it more he said so if a man is wrong what of it help him he needs help love him if you can't love your enemy the same as you love those who love you you're no better off than the publicans that's right he said that's what the church has failed to get brother branham says something interesting in church order when he's talking to about the deacons and how they had to deal with people because being a deacon can be hard and and brother danny say man to that i'm sure after his years of service but it can be difficult because you're dealing with people any time you're dealing with people it's can be difficult and so they said are we handling this wrong brother said no you're not you have to tell people the truth but he says this he said you don't want to get like oswald and he's referencing something that had just happened that that oswald you remember it went out and harvey oswald had went out and shot the president he said you don't want to get like oswalt you don't want to get to a point where you disagree with somebody so much you're willing to kill him and that's kind of the age we live in isn't it people have gone to extremes and and what happens is if you can demonize somebody you can be an extremist right so if you can demonize someone because you disagree with them and i i've pondered this a lot lately because i preached about how that we have to recognize that we we could be wrong or at least that a person could be wrong about something and write about other things right someone we disagree with and you don't want to get like oswald where because the man is wrong about something you're going to demonize him to the point that his life doesn't matter huh and you wouldn't care if he lost his life you wouldn't care what happened to him because you disagree with him that's wrong he said you don't want to get like oswald see if you can't disagree with a man and things and then shake his hand still the same feelings towards him then there's something wrong with you he said if i can't disagree with a man bitterly from one side to the other and still think as much of him as christ would that's a that's a high order isn't it that's a tall ask right there think of as much of a man as christ would how much did jesus think of us that's a tall order paul said love your your wife as christ loves the church that's a tall order think of as much of a man as as christ would even though you disagree with him he said then there's something wrong with my spirit i haven't the spirit of christ if he says well brother branham i believe your teaching is this that all right brother let's come together to reason you and i we'll take it ourselves we'll go over here in the room to ourself we'll reason it out he said he just cuts me to pieces and i have to say things back to him it's in my heart i can't feel the same about him that he's still my brother and i'm trying to help him then i'll never help him there's no way for me to help him if i don't love him he said what's the use of going over there he said tell him in the first place first brother i don't love you let me get that out of my heart right here before we go in there because i can't help you until i love you so paul says we have knowledge but listen what he said he said knowledge puffeth up but charity edify it that's literally knowledge puffs charity builds knowledge puffs of bills that which is puffed up is prone to be deflated paul tells the corinthians over and over again you're puffed up you're puffed up we don't want to be like that do we we don't want to be puffed up because if you're puffed up you're going to be deflated pride goes before a fall i've been interested in the story of benjamin franklin in his diplomacy in france because there was a man named john adams who you probably know who went with him or was there with him in france as an ambassador and the french loved franklin and hated adams and john adams was a brilliant man and and probably one of the reasons why we have a country but he was vain he was terribly vain man and he and franklin couldn't stand one another and he was benjamin franklin was a genius but he learned to act humble in fact when he got to france he sent back for a shipment of coonskin caps because that's what they expected him to appear as was a frontiersman and the story goes that franklin had never worn a skin cap in his life but he but he wore one in france every day because that's what they expected to see and when benjamin franklin was very young i think he was 17 years old he'd had a a bitter disagreement as a young printer when even publishing anonymously at one time but he was having a bitter disagreement with a puritan preacher by the name of cotton mather and the old preacher had had they disagreed bitterly but he franklin respected him and he went to his home one time when he was 17 and because he had such respect for him he thought i'm going to learn something from this great man and so he went and they talked in the library and talked about books and things like that and as he was leaving he franklin bumped his head on the doorway and before he did the preacher had hollered out to him stoop stoop and he walks through and bumps his head and ben franklin is uh didn't hear him and didn't realize what he was saying and he turned around and mr mather said well he said you're young he said you have the whole world before you but if you stoop as you go through it you'll avoid a lot of hard thumps and benjamin franklin wrote his his son and told him he said he said that's taught me that if i can be humble around people and treat them right he said then that we can we can have success and godly understanding is not for the purpose of being puffed up this prayer brother brandon prayed was amazing and countdown he says i pray and thank you for giving us good rest in our bodies and for the knowledge that we have of your word see we have knowledge of the word of god don't we we have knowledge this message has given us knowledge of the word he said and the understanding we have of the spirit so we have knowledge of the word understanding of the spirit he said and constantly praying that you'll give us greater understanding so that we might not be a vain puffed up people by but a humble people god give us that kind of understanding so we'll not be a vain puffed up people but a humble people he said in order that the holy spirit might be able to use us that's what i want is that what you want that the holy spirit might be able to use us in and to play to the fulfilling of the word of god and to place us positionally where we need to be at this hour you want to be placed where you need to be be humble have an understanding so you're not vain and puffed up have that kind of understanding he said for we must be at the right place for it to happen he said and we want to be lord that's your desire so paul continues in verse 2 and he says if any man think that he knoweth anything he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know there's some good stuff in here and so they're asking paul a question that he said the reason you're asking in this way is because you don't know what you ought to know he's not disagreeing with their conclusion but he's disagreeing with the way they applied it now brother branham he said i met a man here some time ago he said billy i just learned a certain greek word i've been on it for five years i like to use greek i really do i like to get down and get into the meanings of things but look what he said he said i've been on it for five years trying to learn the real meaning of this greek word he said oh when i found it it is a blessing i said you've been five years learning one greek word yes i said in that five years by god's grace i've won half a million souls to christ not knowing any greek word he said so it isn't what you know it's who you know to know him as life i think we complicate it too much sometimes we make mysteries out of mysteries i i'm good at that i can i can talk a million times after i should have already shut up and been better off but you see it isn't what you know it's who you know but listen what paul says in verse 3 he said but if any man love god if any man how many love god tonight that's why you're here on a wednesday night you love god you wouldn't be here if you didn't love god i believe that but if any man love god the same is known of him he doesn't say the same knows god but the same is known of god and that implies that you know him because you're known of him he knows you in other words it's one thing for you to know god it's one thing for you to know his word it's another thing for him to know you because even the devil knows the scriptures sure he does he can he can twist them every way but do you know him to know him as life brother brown said and he's told this story multiple times in the message but he said a fellow said to me not long ago he said i was just discussing what we thought about a certain scripture in the bible this fellow was quite a scholar he said well you just don't know your bible but he said i know the author real well i'd like to get up close and personal with the author so i would know i could feel the heartbeat of it i would know how to apply it in real life he said that's the main thing he said if i know him he will take care of the rest of it to know him as life verse 4 paul says has concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice unto idols we know that an idol is nothing in the world and that there is none other god but one and you can preach a whole sermon on that but what paul is doing he's not giving the idol any credibility right and sometimes we give things too much credibility we when we when we live in a fearful way there's a lot of things that are wrong to do but if you live your life in a fearful way oh i i'm so afraid i'm going to do something that's wrong actually what you do is if you give those things more power than they have just listen to the voice of the holy spirit if we would just listen to the things we know are wrong and not do those things we'd be okay all right and then there's forgiveness if we make a mistake there we have an advocate aren't you glad for that because we do make mistakes there's none other god but one he says now verse five he explains that he said though there be that are called gods whether in heaven or in earth there be god's many and lord's many there are be that are called gods there are many images that are supposed to be representations of deity but these are nothing they're the figments of a man's fancy of his imagination these these images have no corresponding reality just because a man says it's a god doesn't mean it is and we are commanded not to worship those gods but we are not to fear them either right and so verse 6 paul says but to us i think that includes us tonight because brother brown said i preached what paul preached to us there's but one god the father of whom are all things and we in him and one lord jesus christ by whom are all things and we by him one god look at the simplicity and power of this and people make again a mystery out of a mystery and and and find two lords in that somehow but but here he says there's one god one lord jesus christ period one god one lord jesus christ was the fullness the son being the fullness of the godhead bodily it was emmanuel god with us there's one god the father amen whom of whom are all things and we in him and one lord jesus christ by whom are all things and we by him we're seven how be it there's not an every man that knowledge isn't that the truth not everybody understands that and because of that some are weak in their c in their faith and in their conscience he said for some with conscience of the idol and to this hour their conscience of the idol and to this hour eat it as a thing offered unto an idol and their conscience being weak is defiled some eat with consciousness of the idol this is very important because it does correlate to many things today he said that is it's they're fancying it to be something and it makes the meat unlawful to be eaten not because there's any power in the idol but because their conscience is weak and the weak conscience is a consciousness not rightly informed or doesn't have the the required faith it's a weak it's uh that word in the in the original to have if you want to go back to the greek is is a we is a sick conscience it's one that's this weak that's not not strong the idol is nothing but what you make it i could make this an idol and worship it or i could drink from it right i could make my car an idol and spend all my time on it and polish it and take care of it or i could leave it the way it is maybe not take as good care of it as i should but but i can make anything an idol right nothing wrong with polishing your car but you can make anything an idol but if you're not an idol you can polish it all you want to right i had a man at our church at brother ivy said he every time he come to church his car his vehicle was spotless every time and i found out he washed that thing by hand two three times a week and you just got too much time on your hands but it's not an idle unless you make it one right and you can make it one but if you make it an idol then it is an idol i found out and someone had mentioned something like this about this in a sermon one time and i went and found some stuff on it people in different parts of the world worship turtles do you know that that's a turtle idol got the face of a man it's got a beak that's turtle well that way you can see that but it's made out of wood and it's an idol they worship that thing go that next picture if the next picture's on there this is in china that's a turtle carrying money he's got cash on him because that's in the chat in the zoo in in one of the big cities in china there's they actually people will go by and they can't keep people from putting money on the turtles because there's a there's a turtle cult that worships turtles and believes the turtles will bring them good luck so if you get kind of like a wishing well here in the states but they actually put money on turtles now the turtle is nothing right but you can make it an idol because people do now what's interesting about that is no one's going around checking people's home if i posted a picture of a turtle on social media in a cage you wouldn't assume i was worshiping it at least i hope not you wouldn't assume i was worshiping it but it could be an idol in some parts of the world there may be a man who come out of turtle worship and come to believe in christ and he wouldn't want anything to do with turtles and that would be his right but no one's going around checking people's homes to see if they have turtles and calling them pagan brother branham makes a couple statements and and i think most of you know where i'm going here and because it's this time of year and and i'll just deal with it quickly and brother brennan makes a couple statements about christmas trees and white had to be shepherd brother brandon makes this statement which seems pretty severe he says give us the spirit the true spirit of christmas he said when today when pagan ceremonies christmas trees worshiped fiction stories of a man named santa claus and of our easter rabbits he said in the different fashions the commercial world was capitalized on in one place you can find where he talks about easter hats on easter that being a pagan custom too so but he said easter rabbits the different fashions that the commercial world's capitalized on i'm not against hats on easter but that's what he said and not many of us do that so he said that may be laid aside god he said let us enter into christ the word for we ask it in his name as for his glory and that seems pretty obvious brother brown must have been really against christmas trees and then in god's wrapped gift he said then i want to take this time to express to each and every one of you how grateful i am to you for your christmas cards and gifts i've already started getting christmas cards that made my day tonight too it also made me realize that i hadn't thought about christmas cards it's kind of late now but he said the things that was received at our house he said i certainly thank you with all my heart it certainly did us good this morning he said when i got a little boy he said small enough yet to kind of want a christmas tree he said we had it in the room he said in this morning go under there i found several gifts from my church here my friends from around different places that come in laying under the tree and people say well you quit doing that and but you talk to the family and i did recently and to brother george and he said he always had a tree until he died why because they didn't worship it it's nothing does that make sense i know you all know that but but but that's it's nothing now if you worship your tree you've got a problem and you need to get rid of it i'll give you an example it's not christmas we uh my family's game is rook if you've ever heard of the card game rook that's that was our game growing up we loved to play rook i always got beat it at phase 10 but i never got at adam's house i always got beat at phase 10 but i couldn't but rook was our game and we got pretty good at it and now we don't play it anymore because we can't agree on the rules but but that was our game growing up when i left home i i went uh it was under a pastor for a while and i started talking about playing rook and how i missed that you know and come to find out he didn't believe in rook and the reason he didn't believe in rook he actually had a valid reason his family gambled on rook and the card game rook was invented by mennonites because they didn't want to use playing cards because it was associated with gambling but this man had his family had had gambled on rook playing cards and so to him that was just as bad as you could get to play rook and to me it was nothing right but now what these people were doing in corinth was the equivalent of me taking a deck of rook cards and going in his house say here we go pastor let's play i know one thing i wouldn't have ever preached for him again right and and the thing is how could i how could i have ever helped him and it may seem silly but it wasn't to him right and i'm not taking up for ignorance but sometimes you just you have to understand where a person comes from let's go to verse eight first corinthians 8 8 he said me commendeth us not to god for neither if we eat are we the better neither if we eat not are we the worst we've got to remember this this was it wasn't an issue but they made it one both the legalists and and people that promote liberty and the gospel both do that they make it an issue sometimes sometimes we make it an issue and we have to be careful about that verse 9 but take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumbling block to them that are weak so your freedom carries with responsibility the an ethics class something you ever go through next ethics class that'll teach you about not yelling fire in a in a crowded theater right that's that's ethics 101 don't yell fire in a crowded theater and we attended an ethics class once and they had a lawyer teaching it which is strange why would you have a lawyer teach an ethics class but so but there's responsibility in that and so paul says someone that is weak it could become a stumbling block to them what does what does weak mean romans 14 and 1 he says him that is weak in the faith receive you but not to doubtful disputations doubtful disputations this is interesting it doesn't mean if he disagrees with you you don't have to receive him but it says it means don't argue with him in other words not to the deciding of doubts or scruples not for the purpose of arguing him out of them so well you can come to our church but first i want to make sure you got all the scruples out of you all the little things you hold on to that aren't right no i believe that the preaching of the word will do that but it's not my job to argue it out of you right and usually when you begin to argue with somebody it does the reverse where if you'd give someone confidence and and christian affection it would begin to draw those things away so paul in that example he mentions jewish meats and days the strong don't have to observe those things but the weak do and paul says they're both christians some are just weak in the faith don't get involved in his arguments just receive him as a brother second timothy 2 23 talks about a minister and a responsibility of a minister he said but foolish and unlearned questions avoid avoid right and we don't do that well enough i always wanted to be able to answer a question but sometimes you have to avoid a question if it's a foolish and unlearned question knowing that they do gender strifes second timothy 2 24 and the servant of the lord must not strive we say that again the servant of the lord must not strive i wish i could turn around and preach at myself i need a mirror up here the servant of the lord must not strive but be gentle unto all men apt to teach patient brother branham says it this way he said the unbelievers can't believe it have you ever thought about it like that they can't believe it they're unbelievers it wasn't meant for the unbeliever they can't believe it so he said now if anybody wants to argue about the serpent seat and things he said you try to show them they won't listen to it he said just walk away just leave them alone see god don't argue neither does his children so that would be somebody that's weak but you just don't argue with them let them be in the right atmosphere let them hang around and see if they can get better don't argue with them they have to know the truth but don't argue with them first corinthians 8 and 10 for if any man see thee which has knowledge said it meet in the idol's temple we say you got knowledge so you're going down into the idols temple which they weren't supposed to do eating meat and and just having a good old time he said shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols now you know you think of it like this two brothers in the church sit down for a meal one's jew and the other is gentile and and somehow the jewish brother finds out that the meat has been offered to an idol his conscience bothers him won't let him eat it you don't want to do it right the gentile brother man he's got the truth and said paul's taught us about grace we've learned about grace man you can eat that why won't you try it here here have some you know he basically forces him to do it so he don't want to do it so he takes it and eats it the other brother knows the truth and encourages this one to do it and what he does is he violates his conscience and so paul said then the man will be emboldened to violate his conscience again but next time it might be something that actually matters right so the irony of the expression is is this it's it's that word emboldened is a ruinous upbuilding he says i can do that too i can do that too and he dies spiritually from it first corinthians 8 11 he said and through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish for whom christ died because you're exercising your freedom is it okay with you for your brother who's weak to perish you're right but you tried to get this other brother to be like you and you ruined him right and we could do that i could in attempting i love to tell people about preaching i love to talk about it i love to talk about it i could i could influence brother allen in such a way preaching wise that i tried to do things like i do it until i ruined him and that would be a shame right you but you could do that as brothers and sisters together somebody don't they don't want to participate in something they don't want to partake in something leave them alone let them let them be who they are and you be who you are and and so you may have an understanding of better than that but just just live your life now you could sit there all day and and it never bothered you but he might end up worshiping that idol where he eats meat a good example is things we do on sundays i don't mow my grass on sundays and if you do that's that's up to you i i don't do that i don't fish on sundays unless i'm way away from civilization but then fishing is a lot harder to give up than the mowing and it's not because i esteem one day above the other but i don't want to someone else to take the opportunity to start staying home and mowing their lawn instead of coming to church because i went to church you know how easy it would be you know sometimes on a sunday it would be easy for me to sip up here to mama springs after church and stand there and fish and there wouldn't be anything wrong with it for me i may get in trouble for saying that but i've been to church i'm not having another service but somebody sees me out there and said well brother ben skipped church today he didn't know i just preached a short sermon and ran up there and huh so it's so it's public now it it's you know it's something if it's something that the public doesn't see it does make a difference you're not trying to hide anything but you got to watch what you do i found out living in hardy or near hardy arkansas the public sees everything but i hope i'm not boring you tonight i i have to take this slower we won't understand it i won't i won't get it if we don't take it so so you all bear with me paul gives a practical example in chapter 10 and he he says whatever sold in the markets eat that don't ask right he said don't ask any questions but if you know it's been offered to an idol don't eat it he says if he says that if you're in public if you're at someone's house you know something's been offered to an idol don't partake of it don't deliberately do things that'll offend people that you know is going to offend people and god help us with that now i think in this time that we live in we should be more careful the way we live than we've ever been and you can't avoid offending everybody some people just get offended right it's just going to get offended it's just that's just the way it is and so you can't you just have to live your life but if there's something you're deliberately doing to that you know is going to offend somebody it can be wrong now brother brown says now if there's a question and here's why it's wrong because it violates their conscience brother brown said if there's a question he said men come and say do you think it's wrong to smoke he said what are you asking about it for and we know smoking is wrong right we know smoking is wrong sometimes we assume people know something's wrong and that they really don't but we know smoking is wrong they asked me i went to the doctor if i smoked and she lady knew i was a pastor knew who i was and i said no i i don't smoke she said well i have to ask you never know and and so but brother branham says do you think it's wrong to smoke what are you asking about it for us if a question in your mind leave it alone he said for anything you don't do by faith is sin if you can't do it and feel good about it don't do it right and i think we all need to tune in a little bit right you know the old radios i used to have a shortwave radio and you'd tune that thing but then you'd have to get all the way to the right channel you know and get it to the right thing you pick up the bbc or something overseas and i'd sit there and listen to it at night because we didn't have tv so i listened to shortwave radio and i i always loved doing that but you had to get it just right you turned it on back and forth get it just right i think we need to tune into god like that we need to there's a signal coming in but we need to tune in and we've talked about that recently where we need to be sensitive when god says no let's just stop if god says do something then we need to be sensitive to that as well i need to be more sensitive to that he said but anything you don't do by faith is sin he said that's right got to be by faith so how can you smoke and have faith he said see it's right in your own conscience shows that you're wrong so if it's uncertain you better leave it alone because that might be the one thing that keeps you out of the kingdom of god first corinthians 8 12 but when you sin so against the brethren and wound their weak conscience you sin against christ that's something to think about isn't it there are some things that you do that are more harmful to others than some of the examples that we've used drinking alcohol is one of them some people don't think there's anything wrong with that you can't do that without either harming yourself or somebody else right and people that believe that they can or fooling themselves say well i just have one glass of wine a night you're fooling yourself i read a story about a man who's crossing a bridge and there's a man heavier than him and the bridge will hold him he's 150 pounds i don't know if there's a man here that's 150 pounds or not but without shaking his head but here was a man like me on the bridge or on the edge and this man's crossing the bridge and he looks at that man he says come on come on this bridge i've walked over it all my life it's it's good see i can jump up and down on it i can it's good it's solid but it'll only hold 200 pounds and 200 pounds won't hold me so if this other man is coming on and and finally he convinces him he don't he don't like it but he finally convinces him to do it and the thing crashes he dies whose fault is it the guy who kept but see what he didn't he didn't take into consideration the difference in weight right and you've got to take into consideration that somebody else's conscience is different from mine that's the hardest part about being in a church but it's one of the best things about being in a church if you're part of a body of people you begin to learn other people and you have to you have to keep yourself crucify yourself a little bit to work with other people it'd be easy to sit by yourself and just never work with anybody but if you got to be a part of a group of a church a group of people and i'll say this you are part of a church somewhere you may not feel like it but you're part of the body of christ so you're part of the church whether you like to be or not you may be a part that doesn't work anymore but you're part of the church we'd rather have you working to help the body you see so i don't want to convince anybody to cross the bridge i'm crossing not unless i have scripture for it there's a bridge we can cross and i have scripture for that i can have the message of the hour i can stand on a solid foundation but i don't want anybody to cross a bridge that i've gotten over but other people couldn't go so paul says in verse 13 wherefore if me make my brother to offend listen to the power of this statement paul makes a flat out statement that's amazing he says if meat make my brother to offend now he doesn't say if me defends my brother but if meat makes my brother offend if what i'm doing causes somebody else to fall i will eat no flesh while the world standeth lest i make my brother to offend the paul says you're right but you're wrong you can do it you can go ahead and do it but remember if you call your brother to come with you if you try to force him to do it you better be careful the corinthian church was very interested in making everybody else like them and what we need to do is make everybody else like christ make ourselves like christ and be an imitator of christ when you say you go to church brother brown says and you do good things that's fine when you live your life to yourself you have an eternal life how do we square that with people just refusing to go to church and i that's none of you all because you're here on a wednesday night but if you just refuse to go to church how do you square that living for others you say that you go to church though and you do good things that's fine but when you live your life to yourself you have an eternal life eternal life is living for others and he said it proved it when it come in the lamb of god he lived and had eternal life because he did not live for himself he lived for others and you receive eternal life by receiving that day how simple is that there's the plan of salvation you receive eternal life by receiving that day that day on calvary you don't live for yourself no more you live for others musicians go ahead and come a little boy asked his mother says what is a christian his mother started to tell him how a person becomes a christian and what kind of a life that christian had they would be like christ and they would act in a certain way and she as she began to tell him give him a long explanation she gets done talking to him and the little boy said mama have i ever seen a christian i wonder how she felt have i ever seen a christian i wonder sometimes if if we were accused in the court of law being a christian would we be found guilty a real christian how do i become that by the word by surrendering your life to the word listen these wednesday nights mean a lot more than we think they do because this is eternal this this will fit in every age that's ever been it's eternal it'll always be if the lord cherished for 20 years for 40 years if it's tomorrow god willing that it would be it'll still be good make you more like him that's what i want to be i want to look in that mirror until i can say mama that's me until if i was talking to my child now i didn't have to explain what a christian was i could show them what a christian was isn't that what you want to do it's not your desire let's bow our heads together heavenly father i'm going to ask you today myself lord that you would just come down make make me more like you help me to receive the word lord as i thought before the service lord i i don't want you to just open your word but lord open me up to your word help me to receive it lord to really begin to apply it in my life god i pray it would be so for each and every one of us that are here tonight lord and maybe some tired or father and they've worked all week or maybe they've had struggles and trials this week lord you're still here in the midst of our trial and you understand you brought this for some reason to us tonight you put it on my heart for a reason i pray god that you would just move the lord and that you'd make us more like you we want to react in the right way to every situation you know this time of the year people have many questions lord about what's right what's wrong i pray god that we would treat people with respect lord and that we would do the very best that we could to live a life that's pleasing to you thank you for the liberty that we have as christians that we're not just looking on every hand for something that's wrong but lord we're looking for something that's right that something is you lord would you lead us and guide us lord if there's something that is wrong with you just move in us check us by your spirit help us to be sensitive lord we lord if it's at work if it's at home to be sensitive when we talk to our children when we talk to our spouse lord to the movement of your spirit whatever it is that you want us to say we want to say the right things knowing that right words can create an atmosphere that leads to eternal life i pray that it would be so lord help us not to just pass these things by in the scripture that seems so inconsequential sometimes lord may we may we look at them look at them deeply god begin to have that understanding that leads us to humility pray and grant it now thank you for all that you do in jesus name amen amen [Music] lord [Music] yes [Music] sing it again just make it your prayer now before we go [Music] lord [Music] with it [Music] lord for you once again lord prepare me to be a sanctuary tried and true [Music] r amen let's sing that song lately i've got leaving on my mind amen let's just worship the lord just for a few moments [Music] is oh it seems that it's all i'm thinking about so much of the time [Music]

i'll leave this far behind [Music] my amen give the lord a hand clapping praise amen amen did you enjoy that this evening amen i enjoyed that as well amen just definitely touched my heart i was me and jen were talking about that the other day you know i just i couldn't imagine saying anything to anybody to deliberately hurt someone you know we kind of got to talk about it you know because we've been implementing something new at work and nobody likes change and as a loan officer you can imagine i don't get nice comments sometimes when there's change and you know it's not my my decision but i just couldn't imagine going up to somebody and just yelling at him for something and and trying to deliberately hurt him finally come to collusion it's a heart problem all right because christ doesn't do that it's not a reflection of christ amen and so tonight just it really just perfectly presented the way uh that i think christians ought to live and uh not saying it was a simple message by no means but sometimes we got to get back to the abcs to get back to him amen amen but i definitely enjoyed that tonight brother ben and just let's let's we just worship the lord for a moment let's sing
