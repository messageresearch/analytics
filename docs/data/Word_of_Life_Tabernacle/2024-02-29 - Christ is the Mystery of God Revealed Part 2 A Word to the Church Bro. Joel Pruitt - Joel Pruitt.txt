true oh and with thanks I'll be of living [Music] sary oh for you just continue to play that thank you buddy I think that fixed some of it I was just humming so bad I felt like it was going to squeal up here we're a little short-handed tonight so we just pray for us and we'll try to get through it how many loves the Lord tonight let's bow our heads just for a word for prayer if we could Heavenly Father we just want to thank you Lord for this opportunity to come together Lord I pray that Lord if there be anything Among Us Lord that would hinder the anointing of your word to come forth Lord I pray that you would just Lord move it out of the way this evening and Lord I just ask that Lord if there's anything I would say Lord to be unpleasing to you I pray you would bind my mouth so I wouldn't speak it Lord Lord I pray you would just come among us tonight Lord and help us Lord Jesus just to get ourselves out of the way and let you reveal yourself to the people pray be with us now in Jesus name amen amen I just want to say it's good to see uh brother Levi sister noie back with us they're stuck back here in the room they've been gone for a little bit and it's good to have them back and I know we've got several out tonight but hey I preach to a whole lot smaller crowds than this and so I preached to 10 I think is you know or less and so uh so this looks like a big one compared to that so uh but keep all those in prayer that are out sick I know there's several that uh out sick and there's going to be some traveling I believe so just continue to remember them in prayer I know brother Isaac and sister Katherine I think she just made it to Alaska today or yesterday and so uh continue to remember them in prayer and and uh also the meetings down here at Grace Tabernacle just to reminder uh Grace Tabernacle meetings uh start uh tomorrow night at 700 Friday night at 700 and Saturday at 6: and so if you can go down there I know they support our meetings real well so if you can find some time to go down there and and fellowship with them I know it would be a blessing to them and and U and we they'd appreciate it and I'm sure you'd be blessed they have some good ministers that are going to be there um I wanted to say this before you're seated brother bill came up Sunday night I hope this is okay to tell on you buddy uh he come up not for prayer on Sunday night but he come up to say that he didn't feel like coming to church that night but he said I came anyway way and he said when the preaching started going forth he said I just started he said I got so blessed and he said then I started feeling better and he and uh I I want to say that it's wonderful when you see somebody that just makes an effort like that and then you see God come down and bless them for making the effort and so I believe God will do that for us tonight don't you it doesn't matter really who standing here so much I know you'd rather have your pastor I would too and it' be a whole lot easier on me and and I'd enjoy it a whole lot more but uh but we want to keep that family in prayer as well uh for sister Britney's family and they're doing the burial tomorrow down in Mississippi so continue to remember them if you have your Bibles Colossians chapter 1 and I'm doing something a little different tonight I've asked my brother to show me how to do PowerPoint and he has and uh that could be a bad thing so you just bear with me tonight uh try something new on y'all how about that I'd like to deal with uh actually a part two of something a part of the sermon that he's been dealing with that Christ is the mystery and so uh we're going to steal some of that and if I mess it up he'll come back next week and correct me on it um but Colossians chapter 1:8 just before you're seated and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence and you may be seated may the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word if you give me just a little more monitor that'd be good not not too much not to squeal just a little more amen now brother Brandon in this message how many's heard Christ is the mystery recently I know some of you have if you get a chance go listen to it it is a long sermon it's just a few seconds short of 4 hours um so I don't expect you to go home tonight and listen to it um but if you get a chance to go listen to that message maybe if you can do it in Parts it it is a wonderful wonderful message that brother Brandon brings to the people and he's getting ready to go away and he's going to go uh for for a length of time I think he says on there that it may be months before he's back to preach for the Tabernacle and so he's trying to give him a whole lot at once because he's not going to be there for a while and brother brandom's talking there to the people and he's really given brother Neville uh a good word there he's trying to tell the people you know you respect your pastor and love your pastor because God placed him there uh brother brandham could have chosen a lot of men but he chose brother Neville and uh and and he did that for a reason you know I don't believe God uh would have let him choose someone that would have been wrong the wrong man for the job just like I don't believe he lets I don't believe God chooses the wrong people to be in the bride I don't believe he chooses I just don't believe God's wrong how about you and so we believe what he says and what he does and and so uh in that situation brother brandham goes on to talk about brother Neville here and uh and and it's paragraph 77 there and I want you to remember that brother Neville here left in this church in the church in the charge of this Tabernacle under the holy spirit that he has left here and he believes this message and teaches it just the same as I do now there are people out there today who doesn't believe a minister should preach but here is brother brandom saying that brother Neville would would would teach it uh just like he did and so uh he didn't say he's going to when I leave here he's going to take this tape and break it down and just give you give you an hour every Sunday or an hour you know 30 minutes every service until I get back no he actually PR brother Neville in position to preach the word and so you understand when there's a spirit that comes among you that says that we don't need preachers anymore that did not come from the message how many knows that to be true that didn't come from the message that is uh that is some other Spirit that's tried to come in and cause Discord among the Brethren and and and Scatter the message but that is not what brother brandham taught uh and he actually under the Holy Spirit and that's what we all have to do if a minister stands here I can't come up here if I didn't really sit down and study I I don't think it's something we just stand here and throw something together and come up here and try to give it to you in that case you probably could have just stayed home right and so what we're trying to do tonight is under the holy spirit let him speak something that would actually change your life and and actually help you grow in the word and so that's something I can't do personally but if God would use me to do it or use brother Ben or brother Stewart God can use men and we know he still uses men he always has hasn't he and so he always will he doesn't change his program so brother brandom says here uh he says he believes this message and teaches it just the same as I do uh Paul here in Philippians 2:19 says says but I trust in the Lord Jesus to send uh timotheus shortly unto you that I also may be of good Comfort when I know your state for I have no man like-minded who will naturally care for your state for all seek their own not the things which are Jesus Christ but ye know the proof of him that as a son with the father as a son with the father he has served with me in the gospel so Paul himself didn't want to just go around and just send the letters but he wanted some men put in place to do the work that they were told to do and so I know this may not sound like it's coming together just yet but let me try to get somewhere tonight God puts men in the church God set the pastor in the church how many believes that the pastor you have is the man that God chose for the for this hour to Pastor you and that's just the truth of it because if we believe that God is God and we all do here tonight or we wouldn't be sitting here if we believe God is God and His word is true then we believe believe what a prophet said about the ministry in the church and so I think maybe tonight uh I I don't want to sound like I'm beating anybody over the head and and and rebuking anybody because you I believe you all treat your pastor well and and and I I believe he knows that but tonight I think we need to understand that when a man is put here he's not just put here uh you know we we can criticize the man all you want to but God put him there for a reason and uh you you know you can find faults with any human right well somebody say Amen or I might go to sleep up here because what what it is is God has put the pastor in the church a as a shepherd and that Shepherd has different jobs he can feed the sheep he has to guard the Sheep right because he has to watch every spirit that would try to come in to hurt the sheep that are sitting here that's what a pastor does a pastor's not just here to make you feel good a pastor's not just here to preach a sermon that you say well uh you know what that was pretty good maybe next week he'll get better or you know maybe one of these days he he grow up and really learn how to preach you know but but really he's preaching what the lord has laid on his heart regardless of what you think or what I think he ought to be preaching what he preaches is from the Lord and I believe you have a pastor here and he may listen to this and get on to me for this but I believe you have a pastor who has fully yielded to the message of the hour and what God would have him speak from behind this Pulpit he does not want nonsense in the church he does not want anything coming over this Pulpit but what the prophet said come on somebody you know your pastor well enough to know that so that's what brother Brandon wanted in a man under the leadership of the spirit to preach when he was gone when he was absent and when Paul couldn't be there he wanted timotheus and these other brothers to be able to stand there in his absence and say what a prophet said say what the word said and actually stay with the word and straight on the word so brother Brandon would say here he said in any time that you would want to uh you can see fit to come to hear Brother Neville he certainly would do you good I'm sure he's a great ser servant of Jesus Christ now that that's High Praise coming from a prophet that he's not just saying brother Neville's just here because we got to have somebody know go hear the man listen to the man he's actually ordained there for a purpose can you say Amen so as God would use brother Neville in that place God would use a pastor today when the prophet can't be on the scene anymore would would we love to have him standing here and Healing The Sick and or Discerning the thoughts and and calling the glory of God down and and telling you who you are sure we'd like to see that in person but blessed are you that have not seen and yet believe why because there's been young men who have taken this message and have carried it on and brother brandham said we would do that until the coming of the Lord and so we are standing here as as as prophecy being fulfilled and so that's what a man of God is to do today a pastor is to stand here and preach the word now brother Brandon didn't say how many times a week he had to preach or how long he had to preach necessarily because I can get you quotes on both sides of that but what he's trying to do is say you got to have somebody who is not afraid to take the word of God and stand here and actually give it to the people he's not worried about his income he's not worried about how much money he loses if half the church leaves no he's got to preach the word regardless not trying to hurt anybody but preach the word regardless and brother brand talking about brother Neville just a little longer here before I go farther he says he says I've know Orman Neville since I was a little boy and he hasn't changed one Speck only got closer to God he said I remember when I first saw him I was invited to his Methodist platform and when I come back here to the Tabernacle I said someday I'll baptize him in the name of Jesus Christ and here he is with the message now going on a real Gallant servant and brother Neville goes through many strains and heartaches that he doesn't show here at the Tabernacle but being that the Lord lets me have a little sight into people's life I know what he goes through a whole lot of it see and he certainly goes under a lot of Labor and strains and things and you people here hold him up like Joshua and Caleb held up the hands of Moses as he was bringing the word amen so we're here to hold up the message and you're also here to hold up your pastor's hands when he just maybe he's not having his best day you know your pastor is not going to come up here you don't know what's been happening in the back room you don't know what he's been dealing with all week well come on somebody you don't know the trials he goes through and you may not see that and he don't want you to necessarily have to see that it's not your burden to see that but what he wants to do is try to come out here every time and give it 100% and give it his very best but it's not always going to look like 100% to the people who have never been on the in the experience with that maybe you've never dealt with the problems in a church or you've never dealt with a situation and so you wouldn't understand it that's okay you don't have to understand it but what you do have to do is sometimes you got to trust your pastor trust God that he put him there and and just hold up his hands when he's getting frail when he's getting weak and maybe when he's getting down a little a little bit pray for him a little extra harder how about that and so brother Bram said you just don't know what he went through and brother Bram takes that from Exodus 17:8 he said uh then came amalec and fought with Israel and Reed him and Moses said unto Joshua choose us out men and go out and fight with AMC tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in mine hand so Joshua did as Moses had said to him and fought with amch and Moses Aaron and her went up to the top of the hill and it came to pass when Moses held up his hand that Israel prevailed and when he let down his hand amalec prevailed but Moses's hands were heavy and they took a stone and put it under him and he sat there on and Aaron and her stayed up his hands the one on the one side the one on the other side and his hands were steady until the going down of the Sun and Joshua discomforted amalik and his people with the edge of the sword so you see they were holding up Moses's hands Joshua had to do something and so he had to actually go and fight this Army that was coming against him so and today that's what a pastor may have to stand here and do there may be some wolf that would come in there may be a spirit that would come in well come on it can come on good people bad people it can come on good people here in the church it can come in in any way you see fit I mean it could come in on a minister it could come in on a lay member it could come in on anybody but the pastor has to stand there and with the word of God because the word is a deserter right and so if the word is a deserter then he preaches that word and it will cut off those things that would try to come in and hinder and maybe a pastor has to make a decision that we don't like or maybe he has to say something you just wouldn't wouldn't sit real well but brother brandom said you would sit and listen to that man right because he said if you would get up and go out it would show your raising or it would show this but what we need to do today is is just cut out the pettiness come on somebody cut out the pettiness come to church and expect to hear from God and let the pastor be the pastor and let's just listen how about that and so maybe I'm saying things he wouldn't say here tonight but I want to just go this way because brother brandom in this sermon if I could subtitle this I would say it's a word to the church brother Brandon in the word of the church says love one another above everything how many agree to that we're not here to pick fights with nobody we're not here to pick on anybody but but sometimes we think somebody's against us and they're really not so let's love one another if you see a brother in ER brother BR said don't worry about it he said just just pray for that brother that's what we should do as lay members in the church I'm one of you right I'm not the pastor here I'm I'm a lay member in this church what we do is we love one another we pray for one another now I'm telling you this is what the word says now you may not disagree with it you can sit on me all night if you want to but it's what the word says love one another above everything love one another don't matter what the devil tries to say now you're all one great big sweet group now but remember my warning see Satan won't let that stay that way right right he wouldn't let the Tabernacle stay that way he's not going to let this church stay that way something's going to try to break it up or you know that's just the way it is the devil is always on the job but we've got to stay prayed up Church we've got to stay in a place where we're so in love with one another that if something would come in and try to break this church up we don't have to take sides with that nonsense and so he said remember my warning see Satan won't let that stay that way no sir he'll shoot everything if he has to bring somebody in to make his Target he'll bring some critic or unbeliever in and sit him down and cause him to fellowship with you under the quietness and things and then he'll shoot that guy with some kind of a poison stuff and he'll start through the church with it so it don't have to be somebody new that comes in it could be somebody sitting here that is just a good quiet Christian but the devil might go to work on them well the pastor's against me today well come on church I might as well preach for a minute the pastor's not really on my side no more so I think I'm just going to start talking bad about him on this person over here they hadn't shook my hand in three Sundays I might as well start talking bad about them the devil is always on the job to seow Discord among this church it's not just the our brother's Church our sister's church and and you say well maybe this church don't have that problem no the devil's working on every church that is trying to win lost souls he's working on everybody if you're a Christian here tonight the devil's working on you and as our Pastor said Sunday that shows he hadn't got you yet all right and so I'd be a little worried if he wasn't working on us I'd be a little worried if the devil wasn't coming in trying to cause Discord Among Us that shows we've got Unity that shows we've actually got something going on because the devil tries to come in you know every time you see sickness strike the church that's not God doing it that's the devil working on the church every time you see somebody come in and and they're just trying to pull this little group off to one side and this little group over here trying to make little clicks and little isms and I tell you that's the devil working that doesn't mean the people people are devils now that come on somebody we're not calling the PE but the devil will work on those people and the devil could work I mean you know he could get into a good man he could work you know he could get into uh you could take the best man in this building and the devil could be working on him trying to get him to say something that would cause a little problem in the church it's just the way it is so we've got to keep our guard up and so that's why the scripture we started off with was Christ is the head and he must have the preeminence don't look at your problems don't look at the little things that might come up in the church but keep Christ in the focus keep Christ as the head of the church and and the pastor is always subject to the word I promise you your pastor is not standing here and preaching his own Doctrine he wouldn't do that I won't stand here and preach my own doctrines I'll stand here and tell you what a prophet said I'll stand here just like a prophet did and give you a warning that things might come into the church there a pastor can stand here and do that to you but a but I promise you the pastor that stands here here is not one that is trying to promote himself come on somebody he's trying to promote the message of the hour and he's doing it with the best the best intentions at heart he he wants the best for this congregation he wants the best for every person in this building but when he sees the wolf coming in trying to hurt you it is his job to try to cut that thing off you say well that's a little bit harsh that's a no no that's the that's the pastor's Duty oh the pastor is supposed to just create a great big loving environment no the pastor has to be he he's almost like the father of the church sometimes it ain't fun I hope you still love me after I get done with this tonight it's a little out of my comfort zone on what I'm doing but I'm trying to tell you this because I believe it's important to know it don't matter how good our services are it don't matter how how how good our fellowship is if we're going out them doors and talking bad about each other and running the pastor down and running the deacons down and running this one running our Sunday school teachers and running a person that maybe not they don't hold a position in the church but we're running them down and trying to say well this one you know maybe maybe if I could do a better job well I wish you would you know that that's just the way it is there there's always going to be that but you realize that's the devil trying to get on you right after a good service the devil's always I tell you the best Services is usually you'll have some problems follow that because the devil's trying to come in now we don't have any problems that I know of but I'm going to tell you this the devil will come in if he hasn't he will he may not come in tomorrow he may not come in next year but he will come in keep your guard up when the Devil comes in and tries to hurt the church now I don't believe brother Brandon was just making this warning to the brandom Tabernacle I don't believe he was just making this warning to for brother Neville that we need to lift his hands up and we need to help brother Neville no no brother Neville had to be there to hold the hands of a prophet up and then he told the church to hold the hands of brother Neville up we need to help one another because we're in a fight for our lives with the Devil Himself brother bam said now don't you take sides with it he's talking about that if if if the devil would come in and shoot someone full of poison don't you take sides with it and many times what you'll see in a church I is is I've seen this happen uh just being on the inside of some of this I've seen I've seen people sit there and the pastor have to deal with something and then somebody in the church thinks well the pastor is kicking people out or he's running people off no you don't know what the pastor had to deal with now I'll say that and get in trouble later but that's just the truth of it because what you don't know is a pastor has to sit there and study sometimes for hours hours after hour day after day just to get one sermon and then if you get a spirit that comes in you get so in tune with God you'll feel when a spirit is against you you know that can hinder a whole service it can actually you can feel when people aren't for you you can feel when people are are setting on you you know that's just what you learn it's what you feel and and and sadly you wish you didn't you wish you could stand here like a robot but God didn't call robots God called men we feel things just like you feel things we want the service to be good just like you want the service to be good but did you know many times it's the attitude of the people and the way they come to church determines the outcome of the service now that don't that that don't mean a preacher can't don't they should they have to study we have to stay in the word we have to give our give it 100% sent it's not okay for us to just walk in out of work and stand up here and just start rattling off at whatever comes to our mind that's not what the prophet taught the prophet himself would stand there and read notes while he's preaching a message that's the prophet of God who who an angel would come and speak lift to ear but a prophet would have to stand there and actually read his notes because when he was in that study many times when you're in the study and when you're doing that that's often times when the Holy Spirit really comes in and shows you something what happens is a lot of times it's so real in there and you come out here and you're like man I wish it could be the same way but sometimes you just got to break some barriers down yeah and that's what you've got to do as a people of the church you got to break down that barrier because you're going to church with your guard up well the pastor may say something I don't like put that thing down sir come on somebody I got you for at least another 15 minutes so you're going to have to might as well respond you know but but listen the devil is always is going to try to make you come to church with a complex he wants you to come in somebody's against me today somebody don't like me somebody's doing this somebody's doing that you know the devil is always on the job and that's just you know we know that and he's not going to stop so what we got to do is recognize the devil and his tactics and what he's going to do take a warning from the prophet that the devil will come in and try to disrupt our church come on somebody the devil devil is always on the job but what you've got to do is stay prayed up stay sweet with one another brother said stay in love with one another he goes on down here he says he says you stay right loving and sweet and kind to one another pray for that man that he'll be saved too yes sir we don't we don't want to call we don't want anybody to be lost we don't want anybody to be listen Church we're not here just you know somebody uh told me recently you know a church is like a hospital that's right but when that doctor has to set your arm or when that doctor has to stitch something up or when the doctor has to go to work on you it may not feel good for a minute but it is a hospital we don't want to kill the patients it ain't a funeral home we do want to help the patients but they got to want to be helped if you go to a hospital you want to be helped if you go to you you're putting your hands you're you're putting your life in the hands of the doctor and when you come to church you're putting your the the lives of your children in the hands of that Pastor many times because you believe that that Pastor is ordained to carry you through but now there is a thing for you to do you can absolutely hold that Pastor accountable to the word but but but remember make sure it's the word that you're holding accountable to and not your own beliefs and complexes I hope yall are okay today I I'm not trying to preach at anybody I'll preach at myself I I uh I'll say this I I was sitting and I heard this tape that I'm we're going through Christ is the mystery I heard this in the church I used to go to they played it from the very first second to the very last second one time and I will say that my attitude towards a pastor that day wasn't great 3 hours and 59 minutes and some change on a Sunday morning we're not going to hold you that long tonight because I'm dealing with like 10 10 10 10 verses or you know we're not we're all going to hold you long so I'm almost done but but you see many times the devil can get in because the service was 10 minutes too long or the song leader didn't sing the song you wanted or all the musicians wasn't there it happens life happens people get sick people can't go to church that happens that really does now I I'm not a person that actually takes up for missing church but I'll say this sometimes you just can't go there is a difference in uh wanting to miss church and having to miss church uh so I believe it's in your heart that really matters if you want to be there and you can be there then you you go right if you want to be at a if you want to go to a ball game and you can go to a ball game you go to the ball game if you want to go go to work on Monday morning and you can go to work on Monday morning you do go to work on Monday morning if you can go to church on Sunday morning you want to go to church on then you go right what happens is a lot of people may not want to go uh now now that that's that's up to them that's between them and the Lord really uh I I I've never never liked that myself but that's just me uh now we'll get to what a prophet said about in a minute and that way you can be mad at him and not me tonight I want to go to church here Sunday so if that's okay with you or just keep on going he said pray for that man he'll be saved too or that woman whoever it is just pray for them and stick one with another how many likes that this is a word to the church it's a warning to the church don't let bitterness come amongst you backbiting don't let it come among you H you know this is as much for me as it is you tonight I can get out of line and say something that I shouldn't say that's just the truth of it and I have to be man enough to stand here after doing that and face you people again but we have to do that with each other you ever you ever have a big family there's eight of us in our family I can see my brother sitting there watching right now and he's just sweating because he don't know where I'm going with this and you see how they how they are in the family you got the bigger ones of the oldest and they ate more than the rest of us you know and uh so so we all we all we all but we didn't all get along right nobody else had that problem in their family did they everybody else is angels in here I see the Halos most of them burn out but y'all get your family together on Thanksgiving and everybody gets along so well there's no fussing there's no fighting there's no you know there's there's just nothing it's all so perfect not in my family but in somebody's but you see that's the way it is a lot of times in the family of God now brother brandham actually tells us one place he says you know he says us Brams he says we would fight in the backyard but we come out front and he said' don't you touch one of them he said then you got to tangle with all of us now that's the way we should be now I'm not telling you go fight in the backyard but if you do have a difference settle it in the backyard this right here is a place of worship this is a time to lay down your pettiness this is the time to lay aside your indifferences and come and worship God it's a time when we we have to realize that the devil may have got on somebody today and caused them to say something we didn't like but that's okay it's not going to stop my praise in the house of God it's not going to stop me from getting a blessing I could stand here and say something you don't like that's okay spit out the seed and take the Cherry what brother brandham say he that's what he said to do so why can't we just do it let's love one another let's not pick on one another let's not always look for a fault in another brother because there's always going to be a penny and a dime and a quarter you pull your change jar somebody's got a change jar here mine's empty I cash it in now but but but really you think about it you got a change jar and you start dumping that out do you know that's all worth something every bit of it's worth something if you're a penni's worth be a Penny's worth be the best Penny you can be may maybe if you work a little harder at it you can be a nickel but whatever you are be the best of that but let's not condemn a penny because we're a a a quarter let's not condemn a dime because we're a quarter see you don't ever want to get that mentality of I'm better than somebody else we're all Sinners saved by the grace of God every one of us sitting here at best is just six foot of dirt 6'2 whatever the tallest person in here 52 of dirt for real I didn't miss that by much did I but but that's what we all are we're just made up brother B calls it potach and calcium we're just made up of this that that's all we are we're humans There's a sticky nature to this Humanity that we can't overcome right now we can we our our our spirit can lead us to where maybe that maybe we we don't have to use that sticky nature so much and we can be like we don't have to poke everybody that comes by no maybe once in a while we can at least be a desert flower right sir at least look good sir maybe we don't feel good maybe if you did touch us we'd poke you but but but you see what I'm saying church we we don't need to to really let our we don't need to let what happened outside these walls come in here and affect our services we don't need to let what somebody said about our church affect our church we're a family here the very best of us and the very worst of us our family here we love one another we get over things come on somebody we let stuff go we don't hold on to grudges anymore I've got family that might have got mad at one Thanksgiving dinner and the next year at Thanksgiving I'm eating with them again what what is it we got a common we have a common thing that we enjoy and that's the food we're prits we love food you know but if you come here to church then I believe you're coming here for the word of God and so we have something in common that we can Fellowship around you don't have to agree with my opinions on it I don't have to agree with your opinions on it but we want to keep the devil out of our conversations and love one another regardless now what's preached over over this Pulpit is the word of God if you don't like it the way it's preached go back and study it find out if it's right I'd say more often than not you're going to find it's the truth because I'm not afraid to stand here and say what a prophet said your pastor is not afraid to stand here and say what a prophet said it don't always feel good to say it but it's a truth anyway now what you do with that is completely between you and God but what we do regardless of what you do with what I say tonight I still love you when I walk out that door I still love you when I'm standing here there is no bitterness here because somebody said well brother Joel I didn't agree with what you said tonight well that's that's absolutely okay if you can disagree with these hundred quotes You can disagree with the prophet and you can disagree with it if I said something in here tonight that was on my own you have a right to disagree with it and even the things that I've read to you go take them back to the message go take them back to the scriptures you have that right but just because you have that right don't let the devil come in there and say well he was wrong I'm not going to fellowship with him no more no why do we go to these other churches in fellowship with them we're not telling you they're 100% right but what we're telling you is they're our brother we don't know what they preach but we believe they preach the message of the hour we have confidence that they preach the message of the hour we're not sitting there every service they might say something you don't agree with that's okay we can love them anyway and that's what brothers and sisters do we get along regard less of how we feel we get along regardless of the little spats that we might have had I might have said something offended somebody and I apologize for that maybe I didn't know I did it so maybe I didn't apologize well and that comes back at me too there's people that say things you're like well I wonder if they really meant that you know if you just let that get to you the devil will use that to hurt you and your brother but a lot of times you're the only one getting hurt because your brother don't know what he did wrong go to him and tell him if you have to but I'll tell you this sometimes let's just not take something Petty to somebody and say well you mispronounced this or you did this CU I don't want to hear it now but but let's love one another are we a family here or not do we love one another or not I know you're not all here tonight there's some of you streaming so this next part I don't want you to take it wrong I've only got five minutes left I'll read it just as quick as I can brother Bram said stay with your pastor he's the shepherd and you give him respects he'll lead you through because he's ordained of God to do so now brother Bram said now do you remember that and the congregation says there you go the enemy will come in sir and when he does just cling that much closer together I like that we don't have to separate because the devil tries to divide us we can actually get closer together use what the Satan meant for what what the devil meant for for evil use it for good let that thing bind you together take that Spirit of of depression that's trying to bind you in a service and you know what say I'm going to have my breakthrough and I'm going to praise God anyway you might be the loudest person in church that day because the devil tried to give you depression you might be the best worshipper there because the devil tried to stop you and you realize hey the devil's here working on one side I'm going to give God my praise cuz there ain't no Rock going to cry or shout or pray in my place the enemy will come and when he does cling that much closer and the one that the devil is using for an enemy will either get out or come in and be one of you they don't always have to leave they can actually sit here and come under subjection to the word of God and actually be one of you and what do we do then we forget about it and love that brother or sister just like they're one of us and if they leave us pray for them pray God would restore them pray God would save their soul if he can't do it here pray he does it somewhere else we don't ever cut anybody out we're not God we can see things sometimes that are coming brother called us fruit inspectors sometimes we can see things sometimes you can see things coming but we're not God we don't have the final say over a person's life I'm thankful for that somebody might have counted me out at some point somebody's counted you out at some point but God has not counted you out you're still here here why because you're still wanting the word of God and if you're wanting the word then there's something in you that desires the word and when those two things meet it creates a Powerhouse that can't be stopped brother bam says here he says he either become become one of you said that's all don't never Clan among one or talk make yourself clannish let's not ever do that it's a warning from a prophet I think it's okay to apply it to ourselves I don't want to become clish with one person in the church and never speak to somebody else I I want to do everything I can to love everybody in this church well you say you didn't shake my hand last week I apologize I probably missed 20 people and I do try to get everybody's hand at some point but I'm here three times a week maybe you should be here three times a week and you'd get to shake my hand I'm sorry that was petty forgive me he said don't never Clan among yourselves he said he said uh or make yourself clannish We Are One how many agrees with that I couldn't say left hand I'm mad at you I'm G to take you away that's hard to hold a coffee cup and drive if you get rid of your left hand but I don't like you no more so you're going down is't that stupid sorry for that word my daughter will get mad at me but that's what it is you know that's stupidity he said I'm mad at you I'm going going to take you away cuz you're not a right hand that's that quarter diamond penny mentality we're going to get rid of you because you're not a quarter you're not talented we don't need you that's not true God has a reason for every denomination of of money that he sends into this church and I don't mean actually your money I mean the rich the poor The Talented the not talented the good-look the ugly he sent me I'm the ugly I can't help it I'm sorry everybody's like you're talking about me goodness all right I'm almost done y'all okay man you're quiet tonight but that's all right I guess I'm I'm guess I guess you're listening good he said he said uh he said I couldn't say he said cuz you're not a right hand he's my left hand I want him to stay there even the little tip of my finger I want to stay right there every little part of my body stay right there we don't want to be missing a part of the body because we don't think we need it let's just keep it okay he said and God wants us as a body of Believers to stay right exactly with one another where with one another stay right at with one another let's not try to get divided all one body are we Let's Stay Together let's love one another you know I I you got to watch it sometimes you look at the ones that aren't here and we miss a good service over that because the devil's taking so many out sick and we're like well the church ain't full what's happening it's the devil that means you need to be here that means you need to be here so you can come and you can worship because the devil kept somebody away don't mean he has to keep you away well there's not going to be many there tonight maybe I can stay home no let's just come to church if you can and if you have a desire to come to church and you will receive a blessing it may be something you hear tonight six months down the road you needed it and you you're like hey I I thought that sermon was a wasted 40 minutes but it actually did me some good so don't judge nothing before it's time give me some Grace all right all right I'm almost done okay 1 Corinthians 12 let's read that just before we get out of here for one for by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether we be Bond or free we have been all made to drink into one spirit for the body is not one member but many if the foot shall say because I am not the hand I am not the body is it therefore not of the body and if the ear shall say because I am not the eye I am not of the body is it therefore not of the body if the whole body were an ie where were the hearing if the whole were hearing where were the smelling but now God has set the members every one of them in the body as it hath pleased him it may not please you and it may not please me but it pleases God and that's all that really matters I didn't come to church to be to to please myself you didn't come to church to please yourself but it pleased God that you could come and say here tonight and he said now brother B goes on he said now you've got tapes on that what you've got tapes on what we believe you've got tapes on discipline in the church how we behave oursel in the Church of God referring to church order there he says and how we got to come here together and sit together in Heavenly places now now that we've got tapes on that we know a prophet taught us that so all we have to do is just say you know body I don't care how you feel today I'm not talking about real sickness don't don't jump on me all at once if you got the flu stay home you know you got Co stay home you understand that but when you can come to church then you should go to church right I I think that's self-explanatory but I I didn't want to get in trouble 1 Corinthians 14:37 says if any man think himself to be a prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the Commandments of the Lord now this is the last quote and then we'll and then we'll we'll we'll stop he says don't stay home if God is in your heart you can't hardly wait for them doors to open out yonder to get in there to fellowship with your brothers now I'm not I'm not talking about the people that are sick we understand if you want to be here and you're sick and you can't come we understand that I hope they're streaming tonight uh or streaming somebody tonight and and so we we want you to be in church but we understand sickness happens now I you know we'll leave it to that pray that devil off of you maybe sometime but I understand you know there's contagious stuff goes around and if you bring it to church then the whole church is gone you I understand that we we we understand we're we're we're sensible around here too we're not trying to you know drag your kids to church with 104 fever and all that or you know if they should be in the hospital take them to the hospital he said if God is in your heart you can't hardly wait for them doors to be open to fellowship with your brother he said if you don't feel that way then I tell you it's time you got to pray this is a desire in a Believer you want to be in church you want to be in the house of God you can't hardly stay home you can't hardly make yourself stay home if God is in your heart now there's the disclaimer if God is in your heart now now he said now we're in the last days we're exhorted in the Bible he said uh to much more as we see that day approaching so it's even more important now to go to church than it ever was and I'm not saying how many every church is local Sovereign you understand that you can if you have one a week go to that one time a week if you have three a week if you have seven a week no no that might be a little crazy actually but uh I can't I don't even think Ben can find enough preachers for that because I ain't doing it but but but think about it if if God is in your heart then what do you want you want to do the word of God right and the Bible tells us that much more as we see the day approaching to go to church this ain't just something a prophet got up and said he took the word and backed and said what the word said you see this wasn't just his seeing people staying home and saying I'm going to get up and preach with them people no he was taking the word of God and speaking to the people he he wanted to tell the people this the devil's going to come in the devil's going to try to make you stay away the devil's going to try to make you mad at somebody well I'm not going to go to church because of the Hypocrites but you went to Walmart and how many Hypocrites are there I'm not judging but you know the people that are staying out of church at Walmart anyway uh he said this will all men know you're my discip my disciples I skipped one there brother Robert when you have love one for the other that's right stay right together if the brother you think he's a little wrong or the sister say Lord don't let me never have the root of bitterness spring up because it'll affect him and it'll take the Christ right out of my life bitterness we don't want it it don't have no place in the church we don't need it in the church and and and I musicians can go ahead and come because I am out of time he said now he said that poison acids of malice and jealousy and hatred that will just take the Holy Spirit right away from you it will run him from the Tabernacle here it'll do the same in Hardy Arkansas church this ain't just the brandom Tabernacle if you let malice and jealousy and hatred come among you it'll run the spirit right out of the Pew you're sitting in because how can how how can Darkness and Light walk together they can't do it so you've got to get that thing out of you let that thing go let that Darkness just drop that Darkness drop that drop that bitterness at the door my old boss used to say check your attitude at the door but I'm not telling you that tonight because you all deal with things every day you're dealing with things that maybe I don't understand you're dealing with things maybe I couldn't handle God let you handle it because you can and maybe I'm dealing with things that you couldn't handle but that's that's the way it is is but but when we come to church we're coming to hear the word of God it don't matter about my complexes it don't matter what I think about somebody else let me just hear from God and I can be blessed in the house of God he said that will just he said he said it'll kill the spirit of God or drive it away from here it'll hurt your pastor it'll do everything see don't you do that you just wax that much closer together and take the Buckle as the brother testified a minister here the other night he said about having a buckle see he said just buckle on the whole armor of God just pull her on tighten it up move right up close to one another can you say Amen to that he said love one another anyhow talk nice about one another well I can't think of nothing think of something and if you can't say something nice but he said talk nice about one another you know I may not see anything in your life that I that that's just glowingly great but I can tell you you're a Believer and you're sitting here tonight because you love the Lord I I don't know your I don't know your end I don't know what you'll become but I know you came tonight because you're my brother or you're my sister I don't care about our opinions I don't care about our differences let's love one another above all let's love one another your Mysteries don't matter if you can't love one another Paul said it's just a a sounding brass and a tinkling symbol but love one another above everything else sir so let's stand to our feet cuz my time's up and I want you to love me he said say nice things about one another do you know that song I'm so glad I'm a part do we know that song of the family of God you know that song if we could say let's let's play that if you could I I I feel like tonight you know I know this is different for me and I hope I hope it's okay but if you don't get nothing else out of this go back and read a word to a word of the church from Christ as the mystery of God revealed that's something that'll help you in the way you come to church it's something that'll help me be a better minister to you people if I love you then I put more time into what I'm doing to try to help you the pastor doesn't come up here because he doesn't love you he doesn't come up here to get a paycheck he comes up here because he wants you to know this word for yourself we're not we're not we're not like the Catholic church we don't want to just uh you know have all this knowledge and all this understanding then keep it from the people we want you to be blessed with the word of God we want you to be free with the word of God we're not trying to hold anybody back we don't want chains of B in our services we want to love one another wonder if we could just say tonight I'm going to I'm going to drop those chains of bitterness I'm going to drop those pain those those chains everything that's trying to keep me from worshiping God I'm going to lay it down at the door and I'm going to go on forward with the things of God you know what let God have his way in the service don't let me be a hindrance let me be a participant in the program of God here in the church how many got God in their heart here tonight that's why you're here at church tonight you didn't come to hear me you knew I was preaching and came regardless I thank you for that but that's not I'm not here to see you and you're not here to see me but we're here to enter into the presence of God and grow you say well I didn't shout tonight but you understand you got to love one another John said love one another he got too old to preach and what did he did he he stood there and said love one another that's all he could do love one another that's what we got to do Church come Sunday morning when it comes around and you've had a bad Saturday or you didn't sleep all night and you feel well I'm just too grumpy to go to church I don't feel like going to church it'll do you some good to get up go to the house of God when you get there just shake somebody's hand and tell them you love them you know love can break barriers love love can break barriers you you see somebody been struggling say something nice to that person right you know you say what how is this going to help us in the mysteries of God and understanding if you don't have love Nothing Else Matters right if you don't have love everything else is just a is just a sideshow you you can shout but if you don't have love it didn't do you no good you can clap your hands but if you didn't you don't love God what good does it do you let's love one another let's stand here with so much love in our heart that we can't contain it anymore you got to tell somebody I love you that's what we need to do tonight church I don't mean to yell at you but I want to tell you this God is in our midst when you come to church let's love one another he don't want his children to be fussing he don't want you to be fighting he don't want you to be talking bad about somebody he wants you to love one another and if I can have a desire in my heart tonight I say Lord let me love the people of God more I don't want to come up here and pick on you if my if my desire is to come up here and try to correct everybody that's not right I want to give you the word but I'm not here to try to correct nobody I'm here to try to tell you what the word says the word can correct you I can't do it it's not my place I I'm not going to come paint your steps unless you pay me but if you need your steps brother R talked about sweeping your steps and you sweep your own steps and you sweep yours I'll sweep mine and let's love one another and remember
