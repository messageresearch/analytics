undecided than - we got a question mark for them there were zero no votes and 45 for yes brother Ben to come earn the service over to our new passenger I thank you very much for the privilege to to speak to you I don't ever take anything for granted and I think the Lord has blessed us to give us as much unity as what we've had that's all the music that we'll have if you want to be seated we've we've been through a rough trial and a hard time but God knows how to bring us out the way that it should be and to make things the way that they should be and so we thank God for what he's done I've seen God working and I wanted to say thanks to brother Danny and by the mark and their leadership in the church during a time when they didn't expect to have to do that so I wanted to say thanks for that and then also to do each one of the two brother David who does such a wonderful job here leading the sit the services and also serves as a trustee and about the bill white camp thank you for giving me the opportunity if you all and I know brother Danny early on felt like it was the will of the Lord and and I felt that way as well after a while and it seems like the Lord has worked it out for us but this is just the beginning we've got a lot of work to do and and we're going to continue on until the coming of the Lord that that's what we're looking for that's what we're striving for we want to be ready when he comes and we want to have a church that's solid and and ready and just approximates exactly the kind of church that he would want on the earth when he comes but thank you and I wanted to say thank you as well to the congregation you've been so kind to us good to see by the fill back this morning and and each one of you you've been kind to us and we've been through this coronavirus epidemic and we've been through not being able to meet together like we should but you have you have been exemplary in your Christian duty during this time and I want to thank you for that and if there's a plausible for for the fact that you've stuck with it you wanted to have a church and as long as you have a desire to have a church here and for there to be a body God will send you men to preach and a pastor and other ministry to do that and so we're thankful for that today and so I'm honored to be your pastor and I trust that God will always keep me where I should be and and help me to do the things that I should do because there's nothing greater than holding the purchase of God's blood in your hands and that's what I'm doing this morning what I speak to you is important and the way I treat you is important and I want to continue to be that I want to thank like I said each one of you and also the ministers that are here in the church by Stewart brother Alan thank you for sticking with us and and you're a part of this I want you to feel apart as much as you can be we'll be here in the area very soon we'll be moving into the area and so if you need anything I'm here that's what I'm here for us what I do and so if you have any need at all in physical or spiritual whatever that it is you just want me to pray for you you want somebody to talk to that's what I'm here for I'm available 24 hours a day if I don't if you don't get me right away I'll get back with you in and so that's we're here to care for you and in this church is about you and and we want to continue to do that I thank you as well to those of you that have come that are new here to the church and we pray that God will continue to bless you and there will continue to be growth and I'm not looking just at numbers but I'm looking at growth in our spiritual lives we want to see God formed inside of us we want to see ourselves we want to learn to love one another like we ought to and and then I'm including myself in that and and to treat one another right we want to learn to be real Christians so that the people in this area could say if there's we may not agree with them but if there's any real Christians in the world it's right there at the Word of Life Tabernacle it's not what you want this morning god bless you thank you for all you do and let's stand together you'll find that I don't change much for better or worse this is what I am and what you see is what you get and so we're just going to continue to preach the word of the Lord and if all else fails preach the word amen that's what we want to do amen also at the end of the service with Alan if you just bring paxton up at the end of the service a lot of prayer for him and we believe God is a healer don't we amen I want to title this this morning and we'll just talk about it I felt it was needful God's perfect plan for the church and we'll be reading from Colossians chapter 1 and verse 18 also from Matthew 16 and 18 I failed to mention my wife this morning and my kids I want to thank them for sticking with me through all of this melody did tell me that she wouldn't vote for me if she could vote so we made sure that she didn't get a slip of paper to be able to vote she said she would vote for brother Ivy's so whatever that's worth so we have to make sure she doesn't get Pross cited somewhere else but but we think the Lord I think the Lord for my family they've been really well God gave me the best and I'm sure you feel that way as with your family as well Colossians chapter 1 and verse 18 and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning and we're seeing a beginning here this morning but he is the beginning of the church is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence Matthew 16 and 18 and I say also unto thee that thou art Peter and upon this rock I will build my church and we know that spiritual revelation who Christ is and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it I think we can say Amen this morning the gates of Hell shall not prevail against the true Church of the Living God let's bow our heads together Heavenly Father were so grateful to be able to be here this morning Lord with those some that have been here for many years and they've tried to make this their church and have a place where they their families could worship and some have went on to be with the Lord Lord and things happen in life we know that and people change the faces behind the pulpit and the people in the pews and the officers of the church change with time because none of us can continue forever but Lord is those that have went on and those that have continued Lord have been faithful and we thank you for that this morning Lord but they've wanted to to see a church continuing and therefore there to be some body of believers here that would just really worship you and believe your word and is pureness and in in its fullness and Lord we believe that we are that we have to be that and and so we thank you for what you've done for us thank you for this congregation of people Lord that Lord that choose to lay aside a part of their life to come and hear the word it's not a small thing I pray you would bless them abundantly lord I pray you to bless him physically and spiritually and in every area of their lives father that you they will know that you've been working in their lives we want you to have control of the church we want you to be in charge Lord as your prophet taught us that the Holy Spirit is the leader of the church and so we asked you to lead us father as we believe that you've already done through this time we ask you to move Lord in in a mighty way and just be present with us Lord every service every time we're together and we'll worship you and give you the praise and the glory in the honor in Jesus name Amen amen god bless you you could be seated this morning all of God's plans are perfect you know you get the vision of someone building something by the JT and and they're sitting there and they make a plan and they tear up the paper and throw it in the wastebasket and start over again or erase it on the computer or whatever that they might do but God never does that when God builds something the plans for it are right and we may not execute it correctly but God's plans are right his plan for the church is is right and we can have confidence in that and it governs our lives and we believe that the Word of God governs every area of our life that that it actually our lives conform to that word and we have to have confidence in that word to believe that so we believe that the Word of God is the ultimate rule in the church we believe it's not only that is the ultimate rule in our lives this is the Word of God if we can't find it in the word then we don't need it and so but God made a plan and he has a plan for the church and that plan was perfect we may not execute it perfectly but the plan is perfect a deacon may not always be a perfect deacon but God's plan for the church is perfect a pastor may not always be perfect but God's plan is perfect and even in our own lives but the random tells us that even the permissive will of God he uses that to glorify His perfect will now that's hard for me to even uneven comprehend but we know that it's true because we've seen it Experion chily in our own lives we've seen that God actually will go through a time when we're not sure what the will of God is and we come out on the end and realize that God used that time and you can look back into your own life and see there were moments and there were times when things were shaky and things were where your footing was unsure and you were unable to really grab ahold of something but God used that he wanted to make you search he wanted to make you look he wanted and so you'll use that like a tree when the wind blows and the storms come by and the tree is shaking the wind is actually making the roots go down stronger and God's plan is always perfect or he wouldn't be God now the church when we call it that and a lot of times the message we get kind of sidetracked by that because we said well we're not the church were the bride well the bride is the true church right and so God's church is called by different names in the scripture in extra 247 he's called the church in Revelations 21 9 the bride in Revelations 19 7 the Lambs wife in Hebrews 12 23 the General Assembly in first corinthians 12 27 the body of christ and you'll find each of these in other places as well and Luke 12:32 he says the little flock so we could call you a flock or a body or a church or an assembly or the bride and it's the same thing right but but when we talk about the church it kind of gives us an idea of we talk more so about the body of Christ as a whole being the bride because we realize we're not all of the bride but here we are a local church or a local called out a local part of the of the body of that body of Christ of that universal body of Christ and so in the New Testament the word ecclesia is used for church it's 116 times in the New Testament it's the called out it's the summoned it was originally an assembly of citizens and it's used Jesus uses it to differentiate between the entire congregation of Israel and his disciples they were the church that called out right so he says upon this rock I'll build my called out my church and the gates of Hell will not prevail against it and so brother Branham makes this different differentiation though because the church if you go to the world they think of the church as being the Catholic Church or the universal Church everybody that calls themselves a Christian brother branham says that he said he said that much of the revelation is totally misunderstood because we have not formally known that the church spoken of and spoken to in this book does not refer to the pure ecclesia the elect so that's speaking of the church in Revelations in the Book of Revelations he said but the the body of Christ the bride but it speaks to the entire body of people who are called Christians so he speaks to the church when he speaks it says you're lukewarm and so I'll spew you out of my mouth he's not talking just to the bride he's talking to the church not what we would call the church nominal but now the true church is the ecclesia or the elect the body of Christ he says when so in the revelation when it speaks to the church it speaks of the entire body of people who are called Christians whether they're true or nominal so he says says all Israel is not Israel so all Christians are not Christians and that's just true and we have to be careful that we don't allow ourselves to be disappointed because somebody calls himself a Christian and they're not or somebody calls themselves a preacher and they're not somebody calls themselves a pastor or whatever that it might be and they're not we we have to be careful that because people can say what they're anything but it's the fruit that proves what you are the fruit that comes out of your life and so and so he said it's all Israel it's not Israel for all Christians are not Christians thus we learned that the church is made up of two vines the true and the false so and again brother Brennaman in the Raps tree said the very word church means called out earth as Moses called a nation out of a nation the Holy Spirit is calling a bride out of a church he said a church out of a church a church out of a church amen he said members from every denomination making up a bride a bride tree says in the tape a bride tree a bride coming out at Hall and he said that's the one that the bride tree is the bride he said rather is the one that's going to be in the rapture that alone nothing but the bride know what you want to be a part of the Hat nothing but the bride he said the elected ones for known by God from the beginning the father's spiritual genes so we want to have a place just got a place so make sense they've got buildings they've got program they've got we want a place for the bride we want a place for the bride and sure there will be others to come and go but we want the bride to be to have a home to be able to come and hear the word of God and be washed by the water of the word we want to bride that that'll be able to participate in a church that looks like that early church did right and so in order to do that we've got to have we've got to have a church that is called out or a bribe and we've got to be able to do what it takes to have that that's what we've done today it's what you've done today now and the registers of churches the type of the moon he said we're supposed to reflect the light during the absence of the Son of God because we're sons and daughters of God we were Lester line as long as we can see that moon reflects the same kind of light the Sun does he says oh it isn't the people it's God in the people and so how should we treat one another then it's God in the people right so we don't treat the people haphazardly whether we're in the pulpit or in the pew because it's gone in flash God sitting on a piece of God veiling himself in flesh so brother Branham says just like the moon is a shadow of the Sun it serves in the absence of the Sun just like the church is to serve in the absence of the sson of God in the absence of the Sun the lesser light the church the believers serve God and give light in the absence of the Sun but when the Sun rises you don't see the moon no more because it's gone down I'll be glad when we don't have to have church no more in the way that we do now there's coming a day we won't necessarily have to do the things that we do he said do these same speaking of communion he said do this until I come they don't come and day we won't have to do it anymore there's coming a day when we when we'll all be together anyway we'll be able to travel like a thought but for now we're living under God's provision for this age and this is God's perfect plan for now because we're the reflection of that but he said there's coming a time he said when the Sun rises you don't see the moon no more cuz it's gone down it doesn't need its light anymore because it only gets its light secondarily off the Sun he said now like husband and wife the Sun and Moon is the church and Christ so the church we know it's necessary until the bridegroom is present in a physical body right so it's necessary people say well I could go to church or not it doesn't matter the church is necessary until the bridegroom comes so God's perfect plan for the church is to have a perfect church a perfect Church and that would be a church that operates according to his plan that doesn't mean that the people will be perfect right or the ministers will be perfect or that the song leader or the Deacons for the officers will be perfect but it means that it'll operate according to that early pattern because that was a perfect church and then also a church that is protected because we live at a time when Satan goes about trying to devour those that are gods and so we want a church that's protected from the things that are out here in the world trying to destroy it because brother Mannis said that showed the gates of hell would be against the church because he said they won't prevail against it they'll be against it but they won't prevail against it they won't be able to overcome it and then he said we also want a powerful church or that's what God wants to see that's his plan for the church is to have a church with power in it amen so brother Branham says it started out as the original as Jesus said the Word of God is a seed that a sword sowed and he was the sower the seed was the word and any seed that abides alone never does nothing it's got to fall into the ground to bring forth its production again and this seed that perfect church fell to the ground at Nicaea he said when she became a denomination but if it fell into the ground it's got to come back up again and begin to come up we know with Luther and Wesley and then now we're reaching the time when the seed has come back into its right form again so Matthew and I'll go on and read that he said notice any seed that abideth alone it does nothing it's got to fall on the ground to bring forth reproduction again and this seed that perfect church fell to the ground that perfect church it was a perfect church and they had problems just like we have sure they did they had problems in that corinthian church that were crazy but even the ephesian church and the Galatian Church and different ones they all had problems Paul has to speak to them and tell them how to treat their wives how to treat their children how to treat their servants and all kinds of different things that Paul has to speak to them why but they were God's perfect church why because they were operating under that that administration that God had set out and God said this is the way I want you to run the church and that's the way that they did it and Paul corrected it into the way that it should be so now in Matthew 16 and 19 he said I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven and when they was asked about it the Apostle Peter who was given the keys to the kingdom brother Brown said they said what could we do to receive this and he said repent every one of you and I know I feel like I'm hurrying this morning because I know I've got a lot on my plate and I want to let you out of here today you know that I'm not that long-winded you've seen that by now but only in spurts some are I'm gonna try to not let this be one of those first this morning but he said he said I took those so-called believers to repent of their unbelief repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promises unto you and to your children and to them that he said that are in Klamath Falls Oregon and I believe we could it wouldn't be out of the way to put Hardy Arkansas there or wherever you're from to them in Klamath Falls Oregon even as many as the Lord our God shall call the promise is to us and when someone tries to shut that door and say that was for another age the Holy Spirit isn't for this age they deny the word of the Living God now think about that the way the Holy Spirit operates in the local church given the keys to the kingdom whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven you realize what a powerful thing this is you realize what you're a part of you are God's hands you're God's hands God had needed a pair of hands he come down made himself a body and his hands touch people and we went through the other day how that every time he touched him they were made all just says he touched him and the band the blind were were able to see touch sniffing and the leper became cleansed and he touched him and they were they were cleaned from their iniquity you say they touched him but what where's his body today where's his body who's gonna touch him it's gonna be yes it's got to be s where his body and so it's a powerful thing he says when when somebody tries to tell you that was for another age the Holy Spirit isn't for this age they deny the word of the Living God so in if a Peter speaks this and given the keys to the kingdom he had the right to speak that and then in acts 2:41 it says then they that gladly received his word were baptized in the same day there were added unto them about 3,000 souls and we see the formation of that perfect church the Bible in acts 2:46 says they continuing daily with one Accord in the temple breaking bread from house to house did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart or having a purpose praising God and having favor with all the people so that tells me that the early church was not even though they were rejected by the authorities they didn't have to be a people who were just some little cult out in the woods somewhere but they praise God and had favor with all the people because there was just something about a Christian hey bet it makes you want to be around them that's right have favor with all the people and the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved that's God's plan for the church my brother Brennan says he give Peter the keys to the kingdom what was bound at Pentecost is bound forever that's the reason the bride he's had coming to reprove you he said the second time there has to be a church called out of the latter-day like there was in the first day hey men then what kind of a church would it be a perfect Church or one that perfectly operates under that same administration now he he said there has to be one in the last stage of destruction wasn't the first day now as time went on you begin to see in order to this church in acts 6 and 1 it says in those days when the number of the disciples was multiplied there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration well that don't sound like too perfect of a church there was racial strife there was racial strife because the Hebrews didn't want to share with the Greeks and the Greeks probably didn't want to share with the Hebrews because they looked at each other as I was hearing a man not long ago and he told me that or he was telling this that there was their strife even in the country I ran you think about a country like that you think well they're Muslim but he said the ones that in the city have strife against those in the country and the Sunnis have strife with the Shiites and and the different tribes have strife with one another and just depending on where you're from he said the ones in the north of the country have a strife with those in the south part of the country well that sounds familiar doesn't it and so if we're not careful in that you go into a lot of those countries it's tribalism and it still exists and we've not had as much of that here because we were all or most of us came here not we weren't from here and so we came here and so people were able to get together and under our system of government have some harmony but now you're beginning to see there's still tribalism there's still strife but God had a plan for the church to even overcome that right where we didn't have to look at the color of each other's skin or where we were from or what our culture was but that we could be treated fairly and so in this order as he begins to set it out in acts 6 & 7 the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them and said it's not reason that we should leave the Word of God and serve tables so in other words the preacher can't do everything right there's things that you have to have other officers in the church to be able to do that it's not reason for us to leave the word and serve tables wherefore brethren look out among you seven men of honest report full the Holy Ghost and wisdom whom we may appoint over this business we will give ourselves continually to prayer and to the Ministry of the word and you might say and and that was the first deacons down you might say well what did they have to be full the Holy Ghost for to serve tables well sometimes you need the Holy Ghost you really need the Holy Ghost to serve tables if you're gonna make peace between the Jews and the Greeks you've got work to do so I thank God for our brothers because that's part of what they do right that makes sure that people are served equally and and make sure that the church is comfortable for everybody and and so but he said we will give ourselves continually to prayer into the Ministry of the word so we find then that that was the pattern that was God's perfect church and we could go into many other areas of that church they met on the first day of the week there was there was certain things that they did and how they collected the money and all those things many things baptizing many things that we still do today and thank God that we've had a message it restored us back to those things well we find that that church wasn't just in God's pattern but it was protected by God and the way that he protected it God used a certain way of protecting that I know you've heard this before but just bear with me I'm going somewhere this morning he says in officiants 4:11 he gave some apostles some prophets some evangelists some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ brother Branham very clearly says that that perfecting is not sinless perfecting it's not making it perfect or sinless because he said we get fellowship one with another here at the church but the perfecting comes between us and go now he said the blood of Christ is what perfects us in the Holy Spirit so what kind of perfecting are we talking about was talking most of the time in the New Testament he talks about being perfect he's talking about being mature but here it that's also speaking of refitting something or it's the idea of taking a ship and they take all the stuff out of it kind of like you do if you've been on a trip with kids you know if you're going back-to-back vacation or back-to-back trips and we've done that a lot where you are going one weekend and you just work all week and then you're gone the next weekend somewhere else and so with us preaching but if you're just traveling or whatever the kids fill the car up with junk right that's that's the maybe some of you don't let your kids fill the car up with junk but but mine do and and so they put all their all the stuff in the car and so then somebody has to go stuff out of the car and the idea is you've got to put stuff back in there so you can go again and what they would they would do the same thing with a ship a ship would come in they'd unload the cargo going clean everything they'd go in and and fix everything that was broken and they'd come back in and put in all the necessary things that the ship needed and so it's equipping or refitting and that's what he's saying for the perfecting is is for the equipping of the church but also the word means to set a bone so we could say it's it's for the healing of the church for the healing of the church or you know and that's so much the the end result because ministry is a means to an end ministry is not in a bit in and of itself the end just because you hear a preacher you are a preacher doesn't mean that you've achieved what God wants you to achieve but at the end result is a church that's healthy a body that's healthy and so in order to have a healthy body it has to be ministered to in order for you to have a healthy body you go to the doctor every now and then in order for you to have a healthy body you go see the dentist you brush your teeth you're ministering to the body so in order for the body to be healthy the bone has to be set No now I can't make it come back together but you can set the bone right just like a doctor can't make it can't heal it but it can set the bone and that's what a ministry does that's what the fivefold ministry in its entirety does you're setting the bone you're presenting the word placing the word in its proper context in its proper place for the age and then God does two healing Ephesians 4:13 says till we all come in the unity of the faith the knowledge of the Son of God into a perfect man and to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ now there's been some question about that because there's a doctrine called cessation and the Church of Christ believe it and some message people believe it that it still it still the church comes in unity and I said well now we have the message of the churches in unity well depends I guess but and I do believe we have unity more unity than we've ever had in that sense of doctrinal unity and we know what the word is but brother BAM tells us that he said he said some in the church teachers apostles prophets gifts of healing working of miracles all those things are sent in the church he said do you believe that so and what he's saying is there in the scriptures God put them in there and not only are they scriptural but we see them operate right you see them operate you you've benefited from the ministry of a pastor you benefit from the ministry of an evangelist you've you've seen that work right and so now he said all these things are said in the church he said I never did say where they'd be sent out of the church and I never did find where he said he said I never did say where they'd be sent out of the church so someone saying they're sent out of the church they're saying something different than brother Branham said because I never did say where they'd be sent out of the church he set them in the church for the perfecting of the church and to be in the church until he comes again Ephesians 4:14 this is the purpose of it that we be his forth henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine so this fits again with the idea of a ship that were were grounded were anchored were refitted were able to withstand the winds that come we're anchored tossed he said no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the side of men cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive but speaking the truth in love there's the job of a preacher that's our job of the Stuart speak the truth in love the truth is all good but we got to speak the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ so the body matures into that now officials 4:16 from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth so in other words what makes it work is not just the ministry but what every joint supplies every one of us are a joint if we could put it that way we're all a joint we we join with another member of the body somewhere right no Christian operates on their own they may think they do but they don't you join somewhere with another member of the body and so what happens when someone gets to a point where they they just can't get along with nobody what's happened is the same thing that happens if you need a knee replacement right and that that cartilage and all that stuff I'm not a doctor but all that what's supposed to be there it's not there anymore and so the bones are actually just rubbing against one another and it causes pain because all that what every joint supplieth all that sinew in the ball or the the muscle and all that's gone that's supposed to be there Oh church or we realize that when someone gives you grief like that it's not necessarily that they're not part of the body but the joint has just gone bad and so we need to replace the love and the kindness and and the fruits of the spirit that will enable us to to move smoothly together again right and so but he said every joint supplies something so when something is out of if we're find ourselves not where we should be and that includes then our walk with God in our prayer life if we find ourselves where we should not be it affects into our body but it's also the responsibility of the entire body to help us get back where we should be sure it's our responsibility but it's the body's responsibility it's not my responsibility to keep kicking out members of the body but it's to bring members of the body into a place where they can edify the body instead of causing pain write something every joint supplies something you may go and all you may be able to supply is cups for the fellowship hall but you supply you may just supply you may just supply in the spiritual you may supply prayer and let's see what all I do is pray well that's more than a whole lot of people can do because the Bible says the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much so you may not be able to do anything else but just pray but if you can pray hey man that'll be more than than many other people can do so every joint supplies something every joint has a job every joint if they're not working correctly we feel it but if it's working correctly what a wonderful body of Christ that we have so we all have a responsibility to one another to work he said effectual working according to the effectual working in the measure of every part maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself for the building up of itself in love the body builds itself just like your body does just like your body does when there's a way if you would poke something to your skin you'd have a scar or wound your body would begin to heal itself why because if it the wound is left open and the other parts of the body don't begin to make up for that part of the body you'll die right an infection will set in and that's the way the body is now brother BAM said there's five officers elected of God God is setting Church apostles prophets teachers pastors and evangelists he said God did that man has deacons and so forth and everything else we have trustees which are not written in Scripture but brother Branham allowed trustees to be in the church for a reason because there's things that have to be taken care of with the government and there's things that have to be taken care of what the finances God has a part for that as well but it's not a necessarily a calling in the way now let me be careful with this because you can be called to do something and not be a spiritual gift in the way that a pastor or an evangelist but there could be something that you do that you're good at that's a gift if you could put it like that you could have a gift to be a trustee you're good with money or whatever that it is so good with keep of the upkeep and things like that but it doesn't necessarily mean that you are a that you have a gift like the fivefold ministry but remember the fivefold ministry is also part of the body so the the apostle needs the Prophet who needs the teacher who needs the pastor who needs the Evangelist right a pastor can't do it on his own and I've Angelus can't do it on his home a teacher can't do it on his own and I think we've made a mistake over the years by a pastor of a certain type of ministry and they'll just believe that that's all the church needs and that's not all the church needs I know it's not all the church needs I know that this church needs to hear other kinds of preaching and you've heard a lot of me lately because of the coronavirus thing but in which people have not been able to travel like they should but I believe the church needs all five of the fivefold ministry and thank God he sent a prophet in our hour thank God we have that and every one of us are under that because he's not just a prophet he was the messenger to the aged so we all operate under that so but the brown says he's set in the church apostles prophets teachers pastors and evangelists he said all that for the perfecting of the body and in this body every local body he gave nine spiritual gifts and those gifts are different kinds wisdom knowledge speaking in tongues gifts of healing interpretation of tongues and so forth nine spiritual gifts all to show his love towards the church he didn't put them in there just because he hates the church he wants to cause them problems he put them in there because he showed his love if God put a preacher in your life or a gift of healing or whatever that it is around you could put something in the church he did that to show his love toward you aren't you glad that he loves you he said that he wants you to stay in order the Great Holy Spirit Himself being the tutor of the church he said it's too bad we took a bishop until instead of the Holy Spirit to be our tutor it's too bad we took a bishop we've got some man somewhere else that tells us how the Holy Spirit should operate here in the church that's what a bishop is we don't have a man anywhere else are you hearing me Church there's got to be there's got to be leadership but we are led by the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit leads us locally and he's able to do that he's able to lead us locally without interference from anywhere else now we could get help we could have all there could be all kinds of benefit that we could get from other places but he we're led by the Holy Spirit and we were responsible to God our selves there's no denomination up there that if things don't work out that's just going to change out preachers there's no denomination that if things don't work out gonna change out song leaders you know or switch up the Deacons now we're responsible for what happens in the church we're responsible god help us to take our responsibilities seriously and say lord I want a church where the power of God can be there where this presence of God can where souls are added to the church where people can be baptized and come to God I want to place that's operating a body that's moving not one that's on the spiritual couch all the time are you with me now say where's this man going I'll tell you where I'm going I forgot my handkerchief the Lord was some up here it's too bad we took a bishop instead of the Holy Spirit he said the Holy Spirit is the tutor that God gave the church to raise the church to bring it up in the admonition of God so the Holy Spirit freely sets those gifts to the church and they perfectly operate he said if you just won't get excited and try to just take what you think yourself let God do what God does if you see God moving in a certain direction you see God doing something let God do it haven't we seen God be good to us and I know we've been through a lot but we've not been through what we could have went through and that's not because of me is because of you but but because you you you got together and you had some unity to be able to let the church move through this time because there's churches that have closed their doors for good and we didn't have to because there was God had a plan that we didn't have see but God has a plan let God do what God does don't always be fighting against God but let God do if you just don't get excited try to take what you think yourself but let God do it and if you're not sure about it step back and watch it for a while yes he said judge nothing before the time let it let it go for a while see what God does because if it's God he'll do according to the scripture the things that he does it doesn't mean that it won't be hard doesn't mean that there won't be problems doesn't mean that there won't be times when we're frustrated but it means that God will do what God does and God will heal and God will save and gonna perform tore there's a local church that can operate the way it should I believe God is big enough to do that to have a local church that can operate the way should not that nobody else does everybody else might do it right but we want to do it right and we want to do it as much according to the Scriptures we can now brother Brent said God has set in the church God not the organization not the achievement of man to make bishops and so forth presbytery that in the church first apostles that's missionary secondarily prophets teachers pastors evangelists God set them in church and every bugle will blow the same I love that different administration's different callings but the word that comes is the same every bugle will blow the same the same gospel so we don't get an uncertain sound now he said God fortified his army and so this is what I was talking about for the protection for the healing for the equipping of the church God fortified his army what with himself in the form of prophets apostles teachers pastors what did he do what was God doing he said listen did you ever think what that officers of the church is it's God's dress inside dress an apostle of prophetess cr4 see before Satan ever gets to it done told it so he said it's this inside dress it's inside of that armor you see that's why I a minister can do more good or more harm than anybody else right because he's already on the inside people trust you God help us to keep that trust but he said that's the inside that's the protection you know if the guards on the wall turn on you you've got a problem that's why they always say if there's a bank job or something like that was there an inside man if there's someplace been robbed was there an Inside Man and we want to make sure we're not the inside man god help me that I would not be an injury to the church but a help to the church so it's God's dress inside dress an apostle of prophetess here fortune see before Satan ever gets to it done told it if you remove those gifts you lose that protection if those gifts do not stay with the word though again they're Wolf's will destroy the flock so brother Brown says God dressed up in his church what is it God dressed up in his church these officers is God's dress wear when you see those officers pastors teachers evangelists what is that that's God's dress where God's presence God's Spirit working through men and I know I'm reading more than I usually do but I want to get this to you this morning I want us to understand where we're going what we're doing every one of us are responsible to each one of you I'm rich possible to God but I'm also responsible to you I'm responsible to you you have a right to make me accountable right to the Word of God you don't have a right to make me accountable to just what you think but you have a right to make me accountable to the Word of God right and if I come up short something's got to be done in my life to make it right God dressed up in his church he said when you see these officers that's God's dress where God's presence God's Spirit working through man 2nd Corinthians 4 and 1 we'll see how Paul dealt with it he said therefore it's seeing we have this ministry seeing that we have this ministry as we have received mercy we think not and it takes mercy for any ministry it takes grace to be able to do what you do but he said as we've received mercy we think not but notice have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty and I want us to just really focus on that this morning ever announced two hidden things of dishonesty we do not preach one thing and live another our lives as ministers are an open book and that's hard to come to grips with especially if you're a private person I I am i I'm not a person who likes to if I put something on facebook I want it to be something positive you know I'm not I'm not going to tell you every every way every morning how I feel or something like that but I'm not feeling good I don't put something like that on social media I'm a much more private person but yet our lives as ministers are open books as a minister you live in a glass house and we speak of that reproachfully but it's just true it's just true you live in a glass house and so you've got to be able to live in that house in a careful way all right you lived out in the woods somewhere and you and you were walled off and you had high walls and everything you lived up there by yourself you you wouldn't have to be so careful but the way you live as a minister right you have to be careful cuz you live in that glass box and you got to be careful how you handle yourself and you'll make mistakes because people are watching and of course you make mistakes but that's when we come right back and come back to the word of god so he said we have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty we don't do thing one thing and preach another we don't get the luxury of hiding sin in our lives we pronounced those things two hidden things of dishonesty he's speaking of minister speaking of his own ministry said we do not deny the omniscience of God because if if we walk in hidden things we're denying that God knows that's what we're doing we're saying God doesn't know what I'm doing we've renounced the hidden things of dishonesty not walking in craftiness no that's in other words and he goes on to say not handling the Word of God deceitfully so in other words we do not use deceitful means to preach the gospel we don't use deceitful means to preach the gospel because when it comes to the gospel the the means are just as important as the end I hope you're with me the way we do things is just as important as our goals because Cain had good motives right he was sincere if that's all that mattered but it was the way he did it right he didn't have revelation to come God's provided way the way we do things matters Paul says we do not handle the Word of God deceitfully we don't make it fit one person not another we don't hold things or hide things back because it may be oily I don't want it to hurt somebody but we've got to declare the entire counsel of God we can't handle the Word of God deceitfully we can't handle it in such a way that people aren't sure of where they stand we can't handle it in such a way that it would you say well if I if I preach it this way people will stay closer to me and and be in the church but we have to preach the truth whether it's good for the weather it's good for our membership or not are you with me now we don't handle the Word of God deceitfully but by manifestation of the truth that's how we live and that's me and Stuart and Alan this morning rest you set your ears but when it comes to ministry how we live we commend ourselves to every man's conscience by manifestation of the truth by the way that we live and that means we'll raise families and make mistakes with them just like everybody else does but when people sees that they ought to be able to see God working in our family when people see that they ought to be able to see God working in the church god help us today now we're young men but we're I believe these are these are seasoned in ministry and able to preach you the Word of God and to live that way so that's that's as hard as I'll be on myself this morning and I'm brother Stuart mother Alan but our Paul said in acts 20:28 take heed therefore unto yourselves and all the flock and it tells us we've got to take care of our own spiritual lives as well maybe that wasn't as hard as I would take on ourselves I myself he said it to all the fog over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers to feed the Church of God which he had purchased with his own blood I know this that after my departing shall Grievous wolves enter in among you not sparing the flock also of your own social men arise speaking perverse things to draw away disciples after them Satan would get into the structure that God created this perfect Church of God created Satan got into that in the leadership and then he made it into a Nicolay attend thing he deformed it in two nickel and his amount brother Branham said this when we see that the messengers are in his hand and let me let me take some time with that because every one of us are under something and we're responsible to something God has set in in the Book of Revelations the idea of seven messengers the stars in his hand those are in the hands of God and so those are not just ministries but those are messengers to the aged and the Lord identifies himself with those men and grants him his power and so he said it's not enough he's associated himself with the whole church he has by walking in the midst of the golden candlesticks but he has the stars in his hand he he is not enough that we see the fivefold ministry he says for in each age the church goes astray and is not just the laity but the clergy group shepherds are wrong as sheep then God brings himself on the scene as the chief shepherd in the ministries of those seven men the leaders people back to the truth and the abundant power of that truth then if God has done that that places me under the messenger of the age does that make sense that's why we will always and I will I will say this today and the way things have gone on the message it seems like over the past few years it seems like a bold statement but it's not it should be an easy statement to make always preach the message because he was the star in the hand of God I was not right so I don't I will always preach the message and brought people to the message not to a man but to the message and we should do that now he said God brings himself on the scene as the chief Shepherd in the ministries of these seven men lead his people back to the truth in the abundant power of that truth so but that was his protection if we could put it like this that was his protection to the age God protected the H by bringing a messenger to the head of the hour aren't you glad we have a messenger of the hour or we could believe anything but we have something that we believe in we have a an absolute which is the Word of God it's not who we know this it's not every word that a prophet speaks because the Prophet speaks in himself and he speaks us that the Lord but the absolute is a revealed Word of God we have an absolute amen and that gives us protection because we know that this messenger was in the hand of God and brought us that absolute the way it ought to be understood in our hour so we have protection in that now we also have protection in the local church because in Titus one and five Paul speaking to Titus he says I left the in Crete that that should have said in order the things that are wanting something they lacked ordain elders in every city as I had appointed they needed somebody to stand there and be responsible to see that the word was preached and that the church was taking care of Titus 1:6 give us gives us the qualifications for that said if any be blameless the husband of one wife having faithful children I hope my children are listening faithful children that means children in the faith and what that means is that children if the children are at home see if a man if his family didn't believe a man couldn't be a pastor if his family didn't believe I'm not talking about adult children but his family in his house if they didn't believe he couldn't be a pastor he couldn't because he has to have faithful children that's what that means not accused of riot or unruly so if you see my kids out there on CNN with Molotov cocktails throwing stuff we got a problem not accused of riot or unruly he said for a bishop must be blameless and that means unyk used it's what that means unyk used you can't have a valid accusation if there is an accusation there's a proper way of dealing with that accusation and and then you find out whether it's true or not before you spread it right and then if it's true you got to deal with it a bishop must be blameless son accused as the steward of God not self-willed that means not one who's determined to have his own way and everything setting up his own judgment to that of everybody else expecting everybody else to pay homage to his understanding and it was Matthew Clarke that said such a governor in the Church of God can do little good maybe much mischief but he must be someone who's not self-willed not soon angry not given to wine no striker not given to filthy lucre or just greed for money lover of hospitality a lover of good men a lover of good men a pastor should be somebody who loves people all right what puts a lot on us doesn't it but there is a lot on us but I didn't do it just because I wanted to do it or chose to do it you don't you don't get to choose your field of service right God places you where he wants you in the church God does that you don't just get to choose and say well I'll pick from all the churches I'll choose the one I want to go to our I'll pick what kind of ministry I have you don't get it comes out of your own life and out of your the things you've been through and the gifts that God gives you and you preach a certain way and nobody else preaches like that if if you preach like everybody else does and there's a problem you're just an imitator anybody can be an imitator an actor but you have to be a lover of good men sober just holy temperate holding fast the faithful word it was so important as he has been taught you can't teach others if you can't be taught holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught God help us today if there is another generation to teach that generation faithfully that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers that's part of my job is to convince you of what's true so I got to be sure about what's true I can't convince you that's why I can't preach as if I'm well it may be true and it may not be and I can't do that I have to declare the Word of God and I'm not doing that accusative Lior but but I have to declare the Word of God because I have to I have a mandate to convince you that it's true so book to exhort and to convince the gainsayers so as I said you must be faithfully taught or you're not going to be able to do that 2nd Timothy 4:2 Paul can in his expectation the preachers he said preach the word be instant in season out of season be able to preach sort at any time I was speaking to my brother yesterday and I talking to him about ministry and I said that you know and I'm I get used to a certain way that ministry should be in other words they call you out a certain way if you've ever noticed the preacher gets nervous if you do anything different right and so we like there to be an order we want there to be an order we get called out a certain way and these preachers probably back me up on this if everything is different you get nervous because you don't know what's going on and you learn how to come out and you even walk a certain way and you just there's just a certain thing that you've went through and you calm your nerves a certain but he said be instant in season and out of season and I've known men a minister ought to be able to convince people of truth even if he's not on the pulpit right ought to be able to reprove rebuke exhort with all long-suffering and doctrine not just from the pulpit but everywhere and that's a tall order but it's something that we have to do now brother Brown says let a man go where God leads him to go he said I like that if the people in the conference just say well here's a nice church this brother has built up a nice church we have a little pet and they'll send him over to this church they don't realize they're killing themselves and I can't tell you how many churches have done that and I'm so glad that I believe God led us I believe that I'm not the absolute I don't know all of the will of God but I believe God has led us to this place we've seen him do too much and so I have to believe that but but here he said they'll send him over this church they don't realize they're killing themselves and so many do that he said see first place if that man goes in there he can't feel that man's place you can never be somebody else he said then they only weak in the church to try to show favor to some pet it's always been that way he said but I believe in the supreme authority of the local assembly he said yes let each church be its own choose its pastors it sneaking's whatever it is and that's that's what you did this morning let each church choose its passengers it's deacons whatever it is and that way the man in there has no bishop over him the Holy Spirit wants to speak something to that church they don't have to ask anybody about whether they could do this or that it's the individual in contact with the Holy Spirit he said show me by the Bible was greater in the Bible than a local elder to a local church he said that's right yes for the sovereignty of the local church each church in itself and that church that scripture gets abused to or that that quote because there is nothing greater as far as bishops you know what's greater the people he preaches to brother Branham said that over and over again because the people you preach to are the purchase of God's blood he said and what's greater the purchase of the blood was the blood he said the purchase of the blood is greater so for me preaching to you you I'm a servant which is what a preacher a minister it's what the word ministry means a minister is a servant and so yes there's nothing higher as far as authorities in a local elder in a local church but it's because the church is God's purchase purchase of God's blood now I mean let me go here and I'm I'm not too far from being done so everybody said thank the Lord this is the point in which you get to start griping about how long I preach by the way you really couldn't do that up till now but now you get to gripe about it and it's okay I'm gonna get me a clock up there too but he said but now hath God set the members but do you believe God sets the ministry God sets the gift some of the rest do you believe that but now hath God set the members now hath God set the members every one of them in the body as it hath pleased him I don't get a say over where you go to church I hope you go here but I don't have a say in that I don't you can go into church anywhere you want to go to church anywhere you feel led to go to church I don't get a say in that any more than you get a say in the fact that I am a preacher now you get a say in the fact that I'm your pastor but you don't get a say in the fact that I am a minister and I don't get a say in where you go to church I don't get to vote you in or out all right I can't do that you can do that I can't do that God has set the members every one of them in the body as it hath pleased him and unless there would be some disorder in the church where you would have some drunken person or something that would come and disrupt the services then the Deacons and the authority in the church would have a right to ask them not to come back in some in some disruptive way but as far as being a part of this church God said huh God set the members every one of them in the body as it hath pleased him so you might say this morning you might be wondering where should I go to church well I think you should go here but look God said in the church God said in the church and that has to be something that's revealed to you you know where you should go to church at your local church that preaches the truth now that's a problem and I know what you're thinking there's a lot of local churches to preach the message but look and and there's nothing against those brothers because I believe and God help me you remind me of this if I ever don't if I ever get frustrated but God help me if God helps me I'm gonna try to have as much cooperation and fellowship as we can half with the other believers in the area but but this is our church we're responsible for our own church but you should go to your local church that preaches the truth you're free to go anywhere that preaches the truth if you have five churches locally you pick one but make sure you pray about it it don't decide up to me it's between you and God God put certain ministries certain pastors for some reason God thought she needed five different preachers I don't know in the area I don't know why things have happened the way that they have but they'd sit here for a reason so you go were you where you know is the right place for you that's where you go so you say well how can I know that but the Branham speaking of the choosing of a bride he talks about praying for your spouse he said the same applies about choosing a church and that's a choice you make every day by the way that's not just a one-time thing but you choose to support a local church every day and every week and when you work and you pay your tithe and you do the things that you do and you show up on work days or whatever that we do you show up and meetings and you you choose to support the church and if you choose to support the church and you must pray over that church before you choose to do that so you must constantly we should constantly be in prayer Lord I want my church to be right I want things to be right at the church I want you to lead my surely the Deacons lead the the trustees all the the officers of the church lead the the singing in the music and everything that's done I want you to be a part of it Lord we should pray over our church you must pray over the church that you were fellowshiping in he said because remember churches carry a spirit and he goes into that how a church acts like a pastor he said so if I was choosing a church I choose the genuine fundamental Full Gospel Bible Church so you found one this one right here but if you choose to go to another genuine Full Gospel fundamental Bible Church god bless you for that but we want to be responsible for our church here he said if I was choosing one to put my family in and we've got to think about that now it should be not only a perfect church not only a protected church but a powerful Church a powerful Church and we say that but do we really believe it do we really believe that God can do what he said in mark 16:17 these signs shall follow them that belief that's not just preachers but that's every one of us these signs shall follow them that belief so we can we can put all names in there these signs shall follow Benford these signs shall follow JD hice these signs shall follow every one of you then the belief in my name shall they cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover do we believe that today they shall lay hands on the sick Matthew 18 and 19 speaks of the church this body of Christ when he says again I say to you that if two of you shall agree on earth as touching anything that they shall ask it should be done for them my father which is in heaven to be so son just me praying for you but it's you agreeing with me and that's all it takes us to then what could happen if we can all agree together we'd be like they were in the upper room when they were all with one Accord in one place and the Holy Ghost begin to fall down on each one of them individually hey man if two of you showed up green you realize what God has done he says he sings and we hate I know it's hard on a church to go through votes and to go through times of change and things like that but we do that we have to do that so we can get to this so we can get to the purpose of the church what are we here for we're here to be Jesus Christ to the world that we live in we're here to be the hands on the and the feet that jesus walks in we're here to be Jesus Christ in order for us to do that we have to agree that these things are going to be done if two of you shall agree on earth as touching anything that they shall ask it should be done for them of my father which is in heaven power in that power in that God works on both ends of the line God worked with you as the church and you worked with me as a minister to bring us together here God works of two you will agree for two or three are gathered together in my name there am I in the midst of them what does that mean sister Victoria means he's here this morning he's walking in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks he's still there where two or three are gathered together in my name there am I in the midst of him I'm closing musicians come and if you get the back stand ready to come and we'll pray with him and brother Branham says now the power of the church I want you to get this now the power of the church you want to have to be a powerful Church this isn't the Church where the church we can make this beautiful but we can't make it powerful it is a nice sanctuary beautiful thank qu Airy but we can't make it powerful but this church this house of God these houses of God can be powerful and the power of the church is in what is it to debate and have strife and be the most perfect on every dot and everything though it's to come together and pray because I hardly touch when their leader was in prison when Peter was down there in prison he was all he's all shut up he's shackled up in that early church what did they do they didn't know anything else to do they just got together and prayed when they come together to praise as the walls begin to shake and when they did Peter an angel that's Peter out of prison and he shows up at the doorstep you talk about the answered prayers but the church is doing what the church does come together and pray you may not see results overnight it may not be instant but you come together and pray because that's the power of the church let's do that this morning could we let's stand together if you'd bring paxton up we're gonna pray for this young man that's been been sick they don't know what's wrong with him but we know that our God is a healer and sometimes these things bring uncertainty and fear when we don't know what it is that's going on but we know that God is a healer of every things and I am THE LORD thy God that heals all my diseases let's pray for this young man and this this family God would give them peace about it and that he would heal him and if you have a need feel free to come and I want every one of you to pray because he said the power of the church is to pray it's to come together and pray did you pray with me this morning you believe that God is a healer then I believe God is gonna do what God does hey man Heavenly Father for this young man this morning you know Lord his life and you know all about him you know Lord Jesus that's what his family's been through I pray God that you wouldn't move I pray that she Lord reach down his body whatever it is that may be incorrect I pray you'd make it correct or Jesus first brother Alan sister Deanie I pray God that you would just comfort them today and help them to know it'll be okay and whatever it is you've got control over it Lord we'd rather ourselves be sick than our children but I pray Heavenly Father that you come as this church comes and agrees together today Lord that healing will take place and this child's body or maybe he can look back if he can remember in the years ahead you say there was something wrong but I know that God healed Lorna's family can give the testimony of what you did we thank you for it Lord we believe Lord that it'll be healed completely when he goes to have it looked at Lord that it'll be a complete healing in his body we pray in Jesus name Amen let's
