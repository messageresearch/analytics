sick touch every every heart we pray in Jesus name bless you turn with me to Isaiah 6 and 1 and then we'll read John 12 32. Isaiah 6 1 and John 12 32. it's good to see you all here tonight but Dale's good to see you tonight and just got back I think recently from Africa from West Africa I've been there and and I think about the same place and and uh I know it's a hard trip so we appreciate you being here but I'm sure you've got lots of stories to tell so I know I did I'm still telling stories uh some of them just now remembering so they take on but Dale's older than I am so he may have worse problem with that than I do but I think you're older than me I hope so after saying that I figure he is he's got more kids than I do so good to be in the house of the Lord tonight amen God bless you I want to uh deal with this where we left off this morning in Isaiah 6 1 and then the second scripture in John 12 32. in the year that King Uzziah died I saw also the Lord notice his position sitting upon a throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple we took that this morning and there's no room for any counselors no advisors said who's given the Lord counsel no one else there it's just him and at some point in our lives we've got to get to the point where it's just us and God no one else and then John 12 32 he says and I if I be lifted up from the Earth this is a different kind of lifting up talking about his death to be lifted between the heavens and the Earth on a cross he said if I be lifted up from the Earth I will draw all men unto me I pray the Lord without his Blessing to the word you may be seated this evening talk about that tonight lift it up the Old Testament view of God was Isaiah's Vision God high and lifted up a mighty God God on his throne and I think we ought to see God that way today that he is on his throne he's high and lifted up in Psalms 47 and 1 he uh he spoke this way he said oh clap your hands all ye people shout them to God with the voice of Triumph for the Lord most high is terrible terrible that word doesn't mean he's bad it means that he's fearful uh he he's he's to look at him you John when he saw him in his with his uh with his uh white hair and in his wig in his judgment position with his feet like brass and his eyes like fire he he saw him that way and he fell at his feet is dead he didn't even have any strength left in his body because he saw him lifted up he saw him in his position and I think we ought to see him that way sometimes we need to see him lifted up and above the world and and there's no room as I said this morning for anything else when he's in that condition the Lord most high is terrible he is a great king over all the Earth if we go back to Isaiah chapter 6 he says I saw him I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up his train filled the temple above it stood the seraphims each one had six wings with Twain he covered his face and with Twain he covered his feet and with Twain he did fly between his two and one Cried unto another and said holy holy holy it's the Lord of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory again it's filled up with the glory of God it's trained filled the Temple look at the image that's being presented to Isaiah who's just lost his friend Uzziah and how Uzziah tried to elevate himself and lift himself up to the position of a minister when that's what he wasn't called to do and here here was a man a prophet Isaiah who looked up to his friend who was the king and and that leadership could only take him so far but now he's reached a place where he needs to go beyond that he needs to take a step into the presence of God let me hear you let me hear me today church I I'm too tired to get my words out but you just hang with me tonight I I wish you could hear me today and that we would we would lift him up out of out of the doldrums of life and out of the regularness of everything that we deal with in life let's lift him up and let's get into the presence of God one time where we would know that he is worthy of our praise and he's worthy of of us living a life life that would be worthy of the Gospel amen and so they cried to one to another the whole earth is full of his glory post of the door moved the voice of him that cried and the house was filled with smoke he said God doesn't like noise well he did there in that vision of him and you realize that he doesn't always present himself that way and we're going to talk about that in just a moment but in that moment when when he's high and lifted up when he's Mighty he said shout unto the Lord right at the moment when he wants praise he wants you to acknowledge his omniscience as all my presence his bigness if you can say it that way he wants you to acknowledge sometimes we need to do that in the house of God we need to say Lord you're you're a great God you're a mighty God you're you're a God of ability sometimes we reduce him down to our little problems and our little things and we think well you know I just need God to take care of this and that and the other and it becomes like a servant or a butler that would bring us something good now and then but that's not what God is he's a mighty God he's bigger than your problems he's bigger than tiredness he's bigger than what you've been through through the day he's bigger than all of that he's a mighty God and he wants to be worshiped like that amen he said brother said let's look at the vision the prophet saw and break it down two Wings covered their faces so think of it even Holy Angels had to hide their sinless faces to stand in the presence of God I was giving Wings to hide their face in the presence of the holy God how are you and I going to stand there if the seraphim had to use Wings God's provided way to hide their face to stand in his presence to seeing holy holy holy is the Lord God Almighty he said in reverence in his presence he says now we don't have any reverence to God everybody now watch everybody just thinks he is so secured until they don't reverent God like they should I think that we message people and I don't like to even use that phrase sometimes because you know I believe we're God's people I I believe we're the bride but yet I think sometimes as message people we know who we are and so we re we read the things about us and that's good we have to know who we are but when we really know who we are and we begin to comprehend what he did for us it ought to bring a reverence to us we ought to become conscience of the presence of God but he said everybody just thinks he is so secure and well I'm predestinated I'm going to make it but when you get in the presence of a mighty God you still ought to fall down on your face and acknowledge he's God and I'm not amen so they can't brother remember said they don't they don't Reverend God like they should why do they do this because they're not conscience of his presence it's the reason people do that they don't recognize it they can't comprehend that they're in the presence of God now why can't they comprehend it because their minds become so perverted and taken up in the things of the world till they don't even pay any attention to it they go to church sure but to realize it's a different thing than just going to church to realize that you're in the presence of God he said not only in a church wherever you are you're in the presence of God it was David who said everything I do I do in the presence of God I can't leave your presence you say well brother Brandon you just said they were provided with two wings and so they were provided with something to be reverent with and brother Brown said you're provided with something too the blood of Jesus Christ is your covering well aren't you glad for that covering today I don't think people understand the blood you realize when the blood of Jesus Christ is applied and this goes to a question I was asked the other day about something and and the end result is people misunderstand the blood of Jesus Christ if the blood of Jesus Christ is applied to your life it covers past sin present sin and future sin you cannot sin and be a Christian right Christians don't sin that's right that's a direct quote where the random said that they make mistakes they don't sin and so the blood is your covering oh let's keep it applied today let's keep it on the doorpost and keep it applied because the blood is a covering it who am I if you just realize you're The Virtuous sinless bride of Jesus Christ that's where you belong and that blood has a covering for you that's What Makes You reverent is the blood oh God he said you don't stand as a seraphim you don't stand as a cherubim you don't stand as an angel listen they have to cover their faces in the presence of God but you and I Paul says can behold with an open face why because you're more holy than an angel more sinless than a terrible I hope you're hearing me tonight because the blood of Jesus Christ is so great that it not only took away the sin but it washed you and made you his bride aren't you glad for that today look you you don't have those wings you stand as a redeemed son or daughter of God by this Blood you don't have to have those wings that they had he said there are special covering for them in that presence but you've got the blood of Jesus Christ for a covering to stand there he said now if you if you've got that blood he said then you honor God you love God you respect God and God is the word he said notice secondly with two Wings they covered their feet what did that mean humility before God and His presence and he goes into Moses and Paul and John and how they all showed humility before God he said here's a good example always be conscience of your littleness once you're in the presence of a big God high and lifted up this train fills the temple he said so be conscious of your littleness not your bigness he said today we Americans so much that we try to think we're big somebody we belong to Something Big some big organization he said oh great big big big is all we see brother Brown goes into that and he talks about Elijah in the cave with the still Small Voice and he said that if he typed that to Americans that we want something that that it's a fire or a flame or something like that but sometimes God don't move like that sometimes he can move that way but even when he does it's not the fire that's God or the earthquake or the flame that shows that you're in his presence but that's not that's not God but God spoke he used a still small voice and so again there's times when God he wants to show you his power and when he does that the cherubims and the angels are are screaming at the top of their voice holy it's the Lord God Almighty and other times he wants to speak and you have to let him do that by the way we don't get to pigeonhole God as far as how how we get saved or how we experience him Paul didn't get to pick his manner of conversion right Moses didn't get to pick how God would speak to him God chose a burning bush right and told him to take off his shoes he didn't get to say well I believe I'll take off my hat he didn't get to pick that you don't get to pick and so what we strive for in the church is not loudness but it's actually what we're striving for is freedom to be able to worship God in whatever way he would show himself to you can you see that tonight so we're not looking for people to uh just say well if we didn't run the house or or shout we didn't have a good service that's not it at all what we want is for God to be able to be God to be Lord to have preeminence in every part of the church so that if he wants to run he can run if he wants to scream he can scream if he wants to if he wants to worship he'd be worshiped he can be worshiped do you believe that today so if he wants to speak to you tonight speak directly to your heart and if it's so still and so quiet that it's a still whisper he can have that if that's what he wants because it's not about us now watch he said thirdly you just have to bear with me tonight I I'm just about I'm just about tired and uh you know he preached me to death and then expect me to come back and preach again you know we love we love those we love to hear the word don't we and some of it's my fault I've been traveling too now he said thirdly he could fly right and we're I'm using this as the background now to get where I want to go tonight so just hang with me he had to be put in action so he had to cover his face he had to be reverent humility before God and finally put himself into action he could fly with them two Wings he said two over his face two over his feet and flying with two now what was it reverence humility and inaction and brother random taught us that that was the hardest part was to be in action to be doing what God wants us to do to be led by the spirit of God now God again this was this view of God that the Old Testament Jew would have understood and and even during Jesus time during the days of the Pharisees and the Sadducees their God was a god of temples physical a physical Temple a God who came down and and parted a Red Sea a God who came physically and and brought a pillar of fire and when Elijah called for it and their God was this great God and they believed that even to be in his presence they wouldn't even speak His Name They removed the vowels because they were afraid to speak his name and even today they write it that way they're afraid to even write the entire name of God because they're afraid they would use it in vain they had a reverence for that kind of a God yeah but God didn't want to stay like that right now hear me just for a moment he wanted you to be able to talk to him he wanted to be approachable he wanted to be he wanted to fellowship with you he didn't call you just to so you could have this view of him in that way that's part of it but he wants you to Fellowship he wants to be approachable he wants to be a one-on-one so what does he do he comes he condescends to come down and as a man now they had difficulty seeing him as a man because now The Carpenter's son is claiming to be the Son of God and he's walking around doing Miracles but he's still The Carpenter's son and he's not in a throne room there's no cherubim flying around instead of oh God their God didn't need no counselors but here was a man walking around with 12 disciples who couldn't get along on anything constantly fussing and fighting and tearing and backbiting at one another just constantly they couldn't get along they they couldn't decide who was going to be the greatest and so here he is walking around with 12 men they were messing up they were falling they were doing things they shouldn't be doing and so he's looking at them none of them had the Holy Ghost by the way while he was here right so they were acting acting up and acting crazy and and people looked at that and said my goodness how could that be God how could it be good but it was God it was God showing himself now in a different form and he's going to be lifted up but not the way he was in Isaiah's vision in the temple he's going to be lifted up from the Earth oh my God now we know that man when he when God became man one of the ways that man falls is by Pride right that's how we fall that's how Satan felt it's how Uzziah fell if you read that story he fell out of Pride because he was the king surely he could go into the holy of holies but it wasn't his place Satan fell he said when he's speaking to Lucifer in Isaiah 14 thou had said in thine heart I will Ascend into heaven notice the language I will exalt my throne in other words I will be lifted up that's what lifted means in the Hebrews is exalted I will be exalted I will be lifted up my throne above the stars of God I will sit also upon the Mount of the congregation in the sides of the north I will Ascend above the heights of the clouds I will be like the most high so Satan comes along and says I will be like the Creator the Creator who had reserved for himself this throne room whose train filled the temple no room for anybody else in that throne room only worshipers only worshipers oh my but there was no room for counselors or advisors or or a court of anybody else there's no room in it I tell you what it's still the same way today there's no room for any of that no one tells God what to do yeah right we we need counsel but we need counsel by the Holy Spirit we need advice we need the advice by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit but now now watch what Satan says Satan says I will but Jesus said not my will right you see how similar the language is Satan says I will there's the difference in life and death there's a difference in being a real Christian and just being another uh another in the Heap of failed Christians I will I watched Satan I will be the pastor I will be a trustee I will do this I will make money I will I'm going to go I'm going to be the best of the greatest preacher in the message I'm going to go to the best church I'm going to sit in the great choir I'm going to be you know I will God has a way of taking us down a peg or two don't he but Jesus didn't say I will you hear me today he didn't say I will he said not my will it was not I will lift myself up but if it's your will for me to be lifted up on a cross not my will but time be done can you see the difference tonight not I will but not my will now watch Jesus heart was not lifted up his ego wasn't important but he allowed his flesh to be lifted up as an offering for sin he was so humble now watch it's a hard thing to hide all of God but Jesus successfully did it he was so humble see we have him by measure you realize brother Branham taught that we have him by measure he had him in his fullness we have the same quality but not the same quantity but he was all of God that's hard to hide but he successfully hid God from the eyes of the wise in prudence oh my they should have seen who he was but he hit him because he was so humble that he come in a manger and only the Shepherds the lowest of the of the workers in that day that could come down and see who he was now watch so he would be glorified but first he had to be lifted up in a different way from the earth listen John 3 14 as Moses watch lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so look what he's comparing himself to you know what's always bothered me that type because you're looking at Jesus the Flesh of Jesus Christ and saying it's a brass serpent we don't even like think about our own flesh that way and this was the perfect sinless Christ that flesh had never been sinned in mine has yours has probably today but this was a flesh that was virgin born created by God in the womb of Mary both the blood cell and the Egg he created it by God created it created himself brother Brandon said I love that God created himself in the womb of a woman called Mary and when he did that God he said as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so must the son of man be lifted up look at the type that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life listen if the if the most sinless the most perfect flesh that ever was had to be crucified what do you think has to happen to yours flesh and blood is not going to inherit the kingdom of God this corruption must put on incorruption this Mortal must put on immortality we can't go like we are that's why we call it a body change because this flesh there is nothing good Paul said there is absolutely nothing good in my flesh nothing and he had prayed for the sick and seen the the the death here and the blind sea and seen Miracles and visions and everything else and he said there's nothing good in it all wretched man that I am why could he say that because he knew it was a snake it was a serpent oh God it has to be a new body aren't you glad you have one already waiting a word body that's in that image of the original thought now watch he said even so much the son of man be lifted up that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life so the way to glorification was by the lifting up of the Cross John 12 20 says there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast now watch your Gentiles coming to see Jesus and they the same there came there for the Philip which was the baseda of Galilee and desired him saying sir we would see Jesus now brother Brandon preaches a sermon of that title and it's actually he's doing more than just preaching a healing service he's telling us that there's Gentiles coming to see Christ and he's showing us that it's the revealing of the son of man that God reserved that for the Gentile age he didn't show that to them then right he didn't go to them but he came in this day and revealed the son of man to us right and showed us a sign of the Resurrection but there were certain Greeks that come up to worship at the feast and he said the same came there for the Philip which is of the set of Galilee and desired him saying sir we would see Jesus Philip cometh and telleth Andrew and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus and Jesus answered them saying the hour has come that the son of man should be glorified oh my God so now he's saying for the benefit of you Gentiles a few Greeks The Hours come the son of man should be glorified verily verily I sent you except a corn of wheat Fallen to the ground and die it abideth alone but if it died it brings forth much fruit he that lose loveth can't speak tonight he that loveth his life shall lose it are you still with me tonight and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal If any man serve me let him follow me and where I am there shall also my servant be if any man served me him one of my father honor Now watch how he's taking it from from this high God that's high and lifted up but that's the father in in that in that expectation that they had for him but now when the father came and dwelt in a body of Flesh what was he doing he humbled himself to the death of the Cross now watch he said now is my soul trouble and what shall I say father save me from this hour but for this cause came I into this hour father glorify thy name then came there a voice from Heaven saying I have both glorified it and will glorify it again the people therefore that stood by and heard it said that it thundered others said an angel spake to him Jesus answered and said this voice came not because of me but for your sakes now is the Judgment of this world now shall the prince of this world be cast out now watch and I if I be lifted up from the Earth we'll draw all men unto me this he said signifying what death he should die and there's many types and things we could make in there but I can't do it to save time tonight so you can go and study it for yourself but but now he said the people answered him and said we have heard now what's their reaction to this we have heard out of the law that Christ abideth forever he's not the kind of a god a kind of a this Messiah this anointed in one would not be one who would die right he's Immortal he's the son of God right right he is God yes it's the relationship with Messiah to God he is God and so he they said we have heard that Christ abideth forever and how sayest thou the son of man must be lifted up who is this son of man oh they couldn't understand him they couldn't see it they couldn't see it the Way Up Is Down the way the glorification goes through the cross it goes through Calvary oh what a lesson that is for us then Jesus said unto them yet a little while is the light with you walk while you have the light let Darkness come upon you for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whether he goeth while you have light believe in the light that you may be children of light he said these things fake Jesus and departed and did hide himself from them so the Way Up Is Down Philippians 2 and 5 said let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross listen the Way Up Is Down you've heard that haven't you brother Branham deals with that a lot in the message and I want to deal with that for just a moment because this is how we get where we want to go excuse me this is we get up this is how we gain our position it's not by fighting and clawing and you say well I'd like to do something in the church well you don't gain that position by fighting for it by by putting it stepping on the necks of other people for it well I'd like to sing more I'd like to preach more I'd like to do this more you don't get that by climbing over other people but what do you do you get it by being little and you get small enough where you can be a servant that's when God can use you are you with me tonight amen the Way Up Is Down brother said he that humbles himself shall be exalted he exhausts himself shall be abased humbled himself don't try to be a big something Now watch how he says this though don't try to be big a big something try to be a little something be what you are now think about it let's go back to that go back one he said don't try to be a big something or try to be a little something people listen to it don't try to be a big something or try to be a little something I got somebody off guard didn't I be what you are be what you are but but you're not elevating yourself you're being what you are you're not trying to be little it flows are you hearing me it comes out of your nature you're a Christian that's what Christians do they're like Christ you're not trying to be and you see brother Brown was talking about people that would be uh humble in a proud way right if you ever got really humble then you'd be so proud of it you know and tell everybody about it and and be at pride in your humility so he said don't try to be a little something or try to be a little or a big something but be what you are he said be little in the sight of God belittle in your own sight everybody else is above you well it's a hard sermon on three o'clock four o'clock on Sunday afternoon isn't it who all did he say was above us well the pastor the Evangelist the prophet everybody pretty low isn't it everybody is above you you put everybody else first so I was saying God first family second work somewhere in there church somewhere in there everybody else somewhere in there you last night oh God that's different from this age isn't it the selfie would have never been invented if we realized everybody was above us let him be the greatest among you be ministered to all he said who can be greater than Jesus Christ who girded himself and washed the disciples feet a foot washing funky come the god of Heaven the creator of heavens and earth washing dirty feet for fishermen with manure and stuff and dust off the roads where their garments had swept it up and washing it off a foot washing flunky what he was I didn't never really understand this brother Joel until we went to Egypt and they wear those same long garments the farmers do even today and they walk down those same those same Dusty roads and the dust on those roads is not dirt huh it's manure because they have so many animals have passed over it donkeys and camels and everything that they have there past the horses it's all passed over it and so it's just it just lays there nobody picks it up they don't have street sweepers there's not somebody falling like they do in a parade with a little bucket and and a shovel there ain't nobody doing that it's all in the in the dirt and so and and they would have sandals on and and the long garments and the bottom of those garments gets very dirty and everything underneath not just the feet but the bottom part of the legs gets so filthy by walking around but they would walk for miles and miles and miles just like Jesus going to Simon's house walked for Miles maybe it took him a better part of a day to get there then he gets there and there's no one there to wash his feet oh God but Jesus who who the Pharisees didn't think he was important enough to make sure he got his feet washed but that same God he was God in flesh that same God condescended to come down and his disciples the same ones who were bickering and fighting and fussing and carrying on those same men that same God came down among them he got him in a room and washed their feet Simon who would betray him knowing that he would still washed his feet oh God give me an attitude like that wanted to fellowship with people who would all flee from him who would all fall asleep during the service that night oh they would all fall asleep every one of them that's more than what's to sleep here tonight even the ones he chose to come up there with him the few that he chose to come up with him they were asleep The Chosen Few Peter James and John laying there snoring well Jesus is fighting his greatest battle Gethsemane he washed their feet knowing they would do that oh God he said a foot wash funky is what he was then we think we're somebody we got to be doctor PhD so and so Oh my he said that ain't Christ that don't display the lovely Jesus Christ he became servant to to how many to all to all you want to learn how to preach you want to learn how to Pastor you want to learn how to be an evangelist you want to learn how to be a Sunday school teacher or a deacon take care of people you want to learn how to be a father huh how to be a mother take care of people now watch if you want any position take care of people because that's what it's about it's not about the chairs it's not about the about the floor it's not about the ceiling or the other instruments are or or the streaming or anything else it's about the people and he taught us an example that we should do to one another as he did unto us he said oh that's my Lord what makes him big because he made himself little right that's why by the game sometimes it's hard to do certain things it's hard to go certain places because we know we won't be received but when Jesus was invited to go down to to the place where he knew he would not be received he would not be welcomed when he was invited he went because Jesus keeps all his appointments yes are you with me tonight taught us that example but I won't go down there and they never invited me up to preach they never had me closed in prayer I'm preaching to myself tonight he said well that's that shouldn't bother you it does you're human it does bother they don't ever use me they don't ever do that go anyway then you'll be like Christ right anybody can love those who love them he said the publicans do that the tax collectors can love one another but who will love the tax collector amen man he said oh he said that's my Lord what makes him big because he made himself little yeah oh my now brother Branham goes on he talks about how the person who made the artificial tooth made himself a reputation but the person who made himself a real tooth has no reputation a person who made an artificial leg made a reputation put his name on it but the person who made the real the real leg he made himself of no reputation but the writer says the Way Up Is Down always remember that be humble be sweet and kind be creative creative let Christ be in you and he goes on to talk about how you create an atmosphere wherever you go be creative he said now what was he yesterday now if he was a great rich man yesterday he would be a great rich man today but when he come yesterday we find out he didn't even have a place to lay his head he said that's right the birds of the air have nests the foxes has dense but I don't even have a place to lay my head when he come to the world he borrowed a womb to be born in they had no Cradle to lay him in so they laid him in a box of straw when he died he was nailed to a Roman Tree under capital punishment he had one robe to put on had been made for him walked throughout without a seam he had to borrow a grave to be buried in he said there's none of us that bad off and again we're not you don't have to attempt to be something that you're not God bless you with the ability to make money he didn't bless me with that but if he blessed you with that you know that's wonderful but it's not that it's it's it's being what you are and recognizing that everybody else is above you even if you can make money even if you can sing or preach huh everybody else is still above you he had one robe to put on he didn't have a grave to be buried in he had to borrow one he come to show us what God was anything that's high and hot he isn't God God is low and humble that's what made him God see something that comes low not them that goes high God doesn't dwell in hierarchies study on that for a while God doesn't dwell in hierarchies and thinks he dwells in humility that's why he made every Pastor Sovereign every Church Sovereign in the way that we deal with things now we're under God we're under the Holy Ghost but we're not under other pastors why because God wants to be able to deal with the little Humble Church like he does the big church and it's the same God being in the leadership right he said well my pastor is well he's led by God hopefully so is mine right every one of us can say that if you have a pastor your pastor is led by God I hope so if not you can find another pastor right but I trust that your pastor is led by God and we and that I'm led by God if so we're on the same level right right now watch and again if we're that way then we shouldn't bother us what happens to us but brother Ben I went to the meeting and they they didn't let me pray for the people they only give me the little cases that's all right somebody else probably had more faith well they didn't seek me up with the preachers they sent me back somewhere else that's okay they really knew me they probably wouldn't set me there either they probably sent me outside somewhere I'm just being honest with you yeah right and someone said that you know people talk about me said whatever it is it's not as bad as what I know come talk to me for a while huh all right you want to know some more I mean there's more but I'm a sinner saved by grace I'm a child of the king I'm a virtuous sinless bride of Jesus Christ amen who can bring a charge against God's elect nobody can hey man Hallelujah he said let him deny himself and follow me if any man will come after me let him deny himself take up his cross daily yes and follow me I forgot to start my timer just bear with me just a moment I think I'm almost out of time if you're cold and starchy now watch I want you to watch something God will not just let you be dealt with in the way you want to be dealt with see he's got to get you to crucify your flesh and so if you're the cold and starchy type individual God may actually come to you and he's not necessarily going to say okay you just sit there and I'll just fill you with the Holy Ghost but he's probably going to make you do something you're uncomfortable with right and it's also true that if you're the type of person who just loves to have a good old time run around the church God may wait and speak to you in a still small voice right because he wants to break down that flesh right because it's the flesh that has that preference that's not in the spirit that's in the flesh and so when we begin to look like that we begin to say well you know in my church we have it a certain way or this other Church there a different way but God wants to meet you where you're at but he won't necessarily it's not necessarily the hill you can come as you are and stay as you are you can come as you are but then he wants to change you he wants to make a servant out of you so if you come if you're the type of person that maybe you need to speak in tongues you just don't ever make a move that's scary Church never make a move toward God maybe you need to speak in tongues maybe you need to cry maybe you need to get down on an altar and just make a mess it's a birth is a mess but if it just comes naturally to you you can I've seen little kids in Pentecostal churches when I was growing up we'd go to Pentecost church a little bit of kids all speaking in tongues playing hands on you you had to hide from them they come a little gang of kids wandering around laying hands during the service speaking in tongues well we might be too good to have that but you know you know if you're cold and starchy again that comes naturally to some people but being like that comes naturally to some people but he wants to break you all right God now watch the new birth is a mess it breaks you I've told you before we don't come to the altar looking for something to get something we come to the altar to give up something and so many people misunderstand that and so they come and they wait because they say Lord give me something give me something no you come to give up something if you're not getting what you came for it's because there's a there's a problem with the flesh right and we all have it that you need to break you need to break through that that veil of the Flesh and then you can see the angels and brother Brandon said standing around but the Brandon said that so the new birth is a mess it's but it produces life it produces life what kind of Life servant life he said to humble yourself to deny yourself that's the kind of life oh they say but I've seen them cry and boo around the Altar and carry on sure they're being born it's a mess he said that you might get up your face all full of tears your eyes red your hands raw from beating on the altar but it's a birth yeah yeah it does something to you it makes you a servant it takes the starch out of you it makes image molding New Life New Creation you may be all messed up when you get up but you're born again aren't you glad for the new birth today you may be all messed up but you're born again no matter where you are it makes a new life it brings a new image to life it makes a servant out of you you want to serve then Jesus wants us to serve one another love one another and as we serve each other we serve him Mark 10 45 the even the son of man came not to be ministered unto to minister that word is not a word of Honor by the way Minister means servant he gave his life a ransom for many aren't you glad that he did now remember now watch if if you I got to get through this fine clothes brother random taught us there's only the sick that demands attention you realize that and I'm not condemning you for that but if you're a person that demands attention on yourself you're sick you have a sickness a spiritual sickness and and you need help right I'm not condemning you for that you have to be in the spotlight all the time you need help the sick demand attention right if you're in the hospital you demand attention you can't get up they're gonna come feed you they got to come change out the IV or whatever that it is if you've ever been in a hospital that they're taking care of you you're just laying there and so you're a sick person you're demand attention but if you do that at home your wife's going to say something right if you lay around at home feeding me honey I hope that don't sound too similar Brittany too familiar feed me just just put it in an IV bit in my veins bring me my coffee and you just expect to lay there you're needy right you're sick now when we get sick we like to make the most of it but you can't stay sick forever I realize there's some people have long-term illness that's not what I'm talking about but but spiritually now right now look what you're look what you are when you always demand attention and how do you know that you do that well you get your feelings hurt when you don't get it he said the sick they demand attention and when you see a preacher he said and may I not only limit it to a preacher but may I limit it to every church member that wants attention I'm somebody he said just remember there's a spiritual sick person now remember it does it doesn't mean that they don't need help they do need help he said they are needing attention but the attention they need is not what they think they need he said they need the attention of the spirit of God to give them something that'll take that attitude out of them heal them from their selfishness and big ideas and big me and little you he said the Holy Ghost makes us all the same what did Isaiah do when he saw him high and lifted up it made him conscious of his own littleness verse five Isaiah 6 5 then said I woe is me for I am undone I am a man of unclean lips and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips because mine eyes have seen the king the Lord of hosts and one of the seraphims flew to him having a live coal in his hand which he'd taken with the tongues from off the Altar and he laid it upon my mouth and said Lo this has touched thy lips that iniquity is taken away in thy sin Purge what did that experience do to Isaiah and made him a servant also I heard the voice of the Lord saying whom shall I send who will go for us and I said here am I I don't have a lot of room for great big Productions that don't make people servants we try to do the very best we can with the music and and with the streaming and with the seating and and that we do the best we can to keep the church clean but I don't have much room for a big production that doesn't make people servants that when they leave the building they've been in the presence of God they say Lord where would you send me here am I didn't come here just to get help come here to be a servant I didn't come here just to be healed but I come here to be healed so I can serve oh God I didn't come here to be Affirmed I come here to be an affirmation to others I don't want to continue remaining in a place where I'm constantly taking in you realize the Dead Sea is dead because it has no Outlet it constantly takes in and takes in and takes in and when when it has no Outlet there's no way for the minerals to leave and so it becomes more salty every year until there's no life left in it don't you realize that's what Satan wants to do to you he wants to make it where you're not a servant you never do nothing for nobody and so you come and sit in the presence of God and you sit there thinking well I'm somebody preacher preach to me I deserve a good preacher no we all don't deserve nothing we never deserve to hear the gospel twice when there's somebody that's heard it once but I'm so glad he graciously comes down and gives us the word of God gives us his word gives us ministers gives us pastors gives us evangelists gave us his word to read gave us things so we could listen to and we could hear we could know Isaiah he says he says I finally come to that place I can be led by God I know what it's like to be in the presence of God and that makes me realize how sinful I am and once I'm perched here I am send me send me to the neighborhood send me to the Church Fellowship Hall send me to the foyer send me Lord we don't get this he may send you to Africa he may send me he may send you to the Philippines I've been to Africa I've been to the Philippines we just got back from Egypt this year but he may send you there but when you go go as a servant go as a servant because there's people there don't ever have the opportunity to hear like we do but let's be servants yes we got the money let's use that to help them we got the ability we got the numbers let's let's use it if we've got even the way we have church and things like that some of them don't understand but let's use let's be an example yeah that's good to be servants who did Ellie Easter look for musicians go ahead and come who did Elisa look for when you come down and it's a very serious business he's got to choose a wife for Isaac what kind of wife would Isaac want does he want a jezebel saw some painted face Jezebel he knew that wouldn't work does he want some uh some woman of stature and commanding presence and a great train and a great a great dress and walking he knew that wouldn't work so he goes to the well where he knew the women would come out right it's like going to a youth meeting that's where you all the girls are he goes to the well right there's nothing wrong with that I'd rather do that and go down to the high school not nearly as many bride servants at the high school or you wouldn't think so anyway maybe come out of the world first please get to dating them but look here comes a here comes a woman and he said Lord How will I know the right one How Will I Know One that is fit to be with Isaac said let me the one that when I asked for a drink she'll say I'll give you a drink and let me draw for the camels now that's a big step she can take a cup of water take it out of her bucket and just pass it to him give you a drink but he had a whole herd of camels you realize how much work it was she had to be a servant pouring water to camels that can drink and they just walked across the desert they can drink gallon after gallon after gallon she might have been there for hours she got nothing out of it he didn't know that she it was just her nature he wasn't doing that to impress Isaac it was just her nature to be a servant oh God let that be my nature today there's the true bride someone who in the Holy Ghost comes down let me be a servant brother said she was watering the very power that would take her home we're watering the very power that would take us home let us be servants in the three o'clock service servants in the 10 30 service the servants in the meetings wherever we go let me be a servant Lord true revelation of who you are doesn't make you arrogant makes you humble she was servant Lord hear am I bow our heads together are you willing to water the power I'll take you home Way Up Is Down I don't know about you but I read that quote to you a couple weeks ago I'm tired but I feel like doing this we'll let you go I read that quote a couple weeks ago brother said um I'm so hungry the presence of God be in the presence of God [Music] busy we get to going and doing and carrying on the business of the church the business of life but I wonder if

we gonna do we're going to say Lord and help me to serve you help me to wash your feet so hungry to be in the presence of God [Music] you feel that I know it's not all about feeling but there's something about being married makes you want to be with that person I'm married to Christ the word I want to be with him I want to I want to feel his presence I want to break through that Veil where I can feel the angels and and know that they're there how can I do that I can't do that when I'm constantly doing the things of the world so busy but brother Ben I got to do this I got to do that yes but won't you take a moment be a servant Lord what can I do for you today how do you need a cup of water do you need a raised hand maybe you want me to pray for somebody maybe you'd like for me to

today Lord we believe that you are the Great Mighty Jehovah you are high and lifted up but when you came to Earth Lord and you poured yourself into a body of Flesh the fullness of the godhead dwelt bodily in that flesh and when you came here and walked in in shoe leather you became a servant to all to be a minister oh god oh Lord would you make us sad today make us a ministers Lord Ministers of your word ministers to your people oh God oh Lord may we be a servant tonight Lord if you want worship may we never hold back but may we worship you in spirit and in truth if you want us to change how

time for Lazarus to come up oh God would you make us to be like that to be a servant so that when the place and the time comes these old bodies can be changed will be changed in the moment in a twinkling of an eye oh God granted to be so Lord Lord I pray that you'd help me Lord as a minister o God I want to be a servant I want to be a servant Pastor a servant Minister Lord not a lord over

are still children of God they still belong to you I pray you granted the Lord may we never get big-headed may we never get to the place where we we brag about who we listen to or or who our pastor is oh God keep that spirit away from us Lord may we be continually humble in your presence oh Lord help me oh God I'm still in a body of Flesh I still get my feelings hurt sometimes oh God take that out
