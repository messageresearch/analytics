Grace of almighty God it's wonderful this morning hearing the wonderful the specials and the Psalms and the worship that was coming forth I I know our God loves our worship and he loves when we come and we give him everything that we have and I believe that that's ushers in his presence into this place and that's what we desire this morning because if he doesn't come then this is a meaningless Gathering but we have a word that says where two or three will gather in his name that he'll be there and I'm trusting in that this morning amen let's bow before him now talk to him our gracious Heavenly Father Lord we're just so thankful and humbled Lord to be in your presence Lord to once again be gathered with a portion of the purchase of your blood Lord not know that Within Myself Lord there's nothing that I can say Lord that would benefit these people that would free these people or help these people in any situation but Lord what I know is is that you've already provided for that situation that they're facing and for that sickness or that trial that they're in Lord that if you'll just come now and take control of the vessel take control of my mind my lips my thoughts Lord and that you'll Speak Lord that Words of Life can come forth Lord and deliverance can be in the house of God healing in the house of God's salvation in the house of God Lord because that's what your word brings Lord and we're looking to that and we're expecting that Lord we just invite you now to take complete control to bless the scriptures Lord anoint my lips and not only my lips Lord but every ear here to receive what you're saying Grant it now father we pray in Jesus name foreign musicians if you have your bibles if you'll be turning with me to Second Kings 25 and 9. I bring greetings this morning from from the home church and from my pastor brother Tim Pruitt there in Minden Louisiana and and he said to send his greetings and God bless you to the congregation and you know it's always good and and comfortable even to be amongst Believers because when you get amongst Believers what you'll find is a welcoming spirit and a welcoming presence but it also helps when those are people that you've known for a long time and that you have a lot of friends and I have a lot of friends here and I just I'm so happy to be back amongst you and and I got some home folks here with me this morning with Andrew and and sister Candace and Jeremy and Rebecca they're still still home folks folks that we love and have known for a long time and and brother Jackson Burns traveled with me the other day so I'm just I'm thankful to be here I'm thankful for each one of you amen so I pray that the Lord will just be with us today Second Kings 25 and 9 we're going to read just two verses there and we'll let you have your seats before we continue it says and he burnt the house of the Lord and the King's house and all the houses of Jerusalem and every great man's house burnt he with fire now what we're reading here is the account of the destruction of Jerusalem that that's taken place as Israel has been taken captive and they're being sent into Exile and and time after time they've risen up and rebelled against uh Babylon Nebuchadnezzar and those and finally he's had enough of it and he just comes in and wipes the whole place out this is the destruction of the walls and of the city and it says in all the army of the child Dees that were with the captain of the Guard Break Down The Walls of Jerusalem roundabout amen I pray the Lord alright his Blessing to this reading as you have your seats today how I was telling brother Joel there in the back that I I have a great love uh for the book of Nehemiah and the Book of Ezra and I spend a lot of time in my personal readings and things there in those books and that's where we're going to um to look at today we're going to spend a lot of time in Nehemiah the second chapter we'll be going through that a lot as we go and I'd like to speak to you for a moment today on on cold to finish the work called to finish the work and and Nehemiah two and one as we begin this it says and it came to pass in the month of Nisan in the 20th year of artist Xerxes the king that wine was before him and he took up the wine and gave it unto the king now I had not been Before Time sad in his presence you know if there's just a little something we can take even from that scripture I'd say there's no reason for us to ever be sad in the presence of God you know there's no reason for us to come in into the to the king's courts to do him service and sit there gloomy and sad but if there's ever been a people that had a reason to be happy and if there's ever been a people that has reason to Rejoice it's the people that have opportunity to be in the in the king's presence on a regular basis and and he says wherefore the king said unto me why is that counting it sad see thing that thou art not thick this is nothing else but sorrow of heart then I was very sore afraid and said unto the king let the King live forever why should not my countenance be sad when the city the place of my father's sepulchers lieth waste and the gates thereof are consumed with fire then the king said unto me for what Dost thou make request so I pray to the god of heaven and I said unto the king if it pleased the king and If thy servant hath found favor in thy sight that thou would Ascend me unto Judah unto the city of my father's sepulchers that I may build it and the King said unto me the queen also sitting by him for how long shall thy journey be and when wilt thou return so so it pleased the king descend me and I set him a time moreover I said unto the king if it pleased the king let letters be given to me to the governors beyond the river that they may convey me over until I come into Judah in a letter unto ASAP The Keeper of the king's Forest that he may give me Timber to make beams for the gates of the palace which appertained to the house for all for the wall of the city and for the house that I shall enter into and the King granted me according to the good hand of my God upon me now I like there back in verse six I love how the king is concerned about the details of this journey you know he doesn't just say to him you know what just go ahead and go back and I hope it works out in your favor good luck in this but what he shows is a great concern and a great care and he says how long is this going to take you and when are you planning to return and the reason that he wants to know how long and the reason he wants to know when he's going to return is because he plans to provide for him for as long as it takes he plans to give him the provisions that he needs to finish the job listen he didn't just send you on a journey down here and say good luck to you let me know how it works out but the King has provided everything you have need of the fact that we're still here in 2023 does not Shock him because he knew how long the journey would be and he said I'm going to provide for you I'm not just sending you but I'm equipping you you're gonna finish this work he's not just sending you haphazardly but he's sending you equipped for the job he's sending you with the provisions that you need wherever you find yourself at today I want you to know the King has already provided for the situation you're in for the battle that you are facing and then what I love about it is he takes it another step he doesn't just make it to where you have to take nehemiah's word for it but he puts it in writing there's a king seal that goes with this commission he doesn't know people you don't they don't have to just take your word for it he put it in writing he said there would be somebody that was going to overcome he said I'll have a bride without spot or wrinkle he put it in writing today so there's no question about it I didn't just say God sent a prophet he put it in writing he said I'll send you Elijah the prophet he put these things in writing verse 9 it says then I came to the governor's beyond the river and gave them the king's letters now the king had sent captains of the army and Horsemen with me I love this too because listen he don't send you unprotected if you could see this morning there's angels on every aisle there's angels that travel with you there's angels that go before you there are Angel armies around the Bride of Jesus Christ those the angels of the Lord encamped about those that fear Him you are protected people this morning you haven't been sent unequipped you haven't been sent unprotected the devil wants to bring fear and anxiety and worry and I'm telling you the King has sent his Horsemen with you this morning the King has come to protect you to provide to see you through listen I'm so thankful we've been brought out but it wasn't just a bringing out there's going to be a taking in and he's made sure that he's done everything he has to do to get us to the taking end thank you verse 10 when send ballot the horror night and tobiah the servant the ammonite heard of it it grieved them exceedingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel you ain't that just like the devil he doesn't like it when the welfare of the children of God is being attended to let God begin to move in a service but the Holy Ghost begin to move in the spirit of God to begin to deal with needs in the body and and let the spirit of God begin to manifest itself in the people and the devil began to get really upset with those people and really upset and the devil will begin to to to come and why is he getting upset because the spirit of God is there to attend to your needs and all of a sudden it's not so easy for him to Rob your joy it's not so easy for him to Rob your peace all of a sudden somebody is there attending to the needs of the people and it upsets the enemy it upsets him when you rise up to take back your peace it upsets him when you claim your family it upsets him when you claim your healing what are these people who do they think they are who do they why do they think they can do this because the king put it in writing I have it right here I have a right to my joy I have a right to my peace I have a right to my healing yes and the King has come to see to the needs of his people it grieved them that one came to see about the welfare of Israel I'm so thankful that in this day the king didn't leave us alone but in this day the mighty angel came down to see about the welfare of his children to check the condition of the walls to see what was being done to protect the people from the enemy to see that the word was being properly placed to see that it was put in the right place that it would still defeat the Devil any place at any time under any situation to make sure that the wall was just how it was when Paul preached it to make sure that the wall was restored to how it was and the devil didn't like that a message came to check on the welfare of God's people he didn't like that that a message came to restore what he had spent so much time tearing down and Nehemiah finds that there's great work to be done he finds that the walls have been completely destroyed just as we read there in our opening scripture and now those that are trying to make their home in Jerusalem trying to make their home in the Homeland for us the homeland of the word they're not protected properly there's breeches in the wall there's holes in the wall they're open to attack they're at the mercy of those that hate them and these people try to raise a crop but the enemy just comes in and steals the Harvest yeah they try to be fruitful but their fields are trampled down constantly by the enemy we know that the church would try to rise up and accept truth but they would be struck down by the false Vine as they began to teach the rulership of man the control over the people spiritual power taken away from the from the laity and placed only upon on an ungodly priesthood and they begin to take the the moving of the spirit was was stripped out of the services and then the people become victim of that Catholic system and her false doctrines and and they would use these false doctrines to beat down the people and beat down the church and brother Branham would even see it in a dream as he would they would have a Triune club that the man would beat the woman with and he says every time she started to rise up and he says that means the congregation began to accept truth he would drive her right down again with false Doctrine so what Nehemiah finds is that that there are still Stones there but they've been all jumbled up yeah they've been all misplaced they've been piled over here and some buried and some torn down and some set on fire and and some destroyed there was pieces of a wall here there was pieces of Truth scattered over there but with so many breaches in it so many breaches in it that the devil could just come and go as he pleased that he had control over the people instead of a people that are completely set free in that Liberty and protected listen God has called this people to be a free people not bound by depression not bound by anxiety not bound by the fear of what's going on in the world that's not what you've been called for and in This Day He restored your wall of protection He restored the Tower of Refuge you can have peace in this day because he came to attend to the needs of his people and he finds that the walls have been demolished and the stones are heaped up and burned to make sure that it would be very difficult for it to ever be rebuilt again you know that's just how the devil operates he doesn't just want to see you fall he doesn't just want to see you fail but he wants to come in and Scar you and smut you up in the mud of the world and he spend so much time working on you to where he thinks that one right there can never be rebuilt again oh that one right there can never be restored again I spent 30 years ruining their life I had them jumbled up I had them piled up I had them in drugs I had them in alcohol I had them with a lust spirit I had them with the pornography Spirit I've got them depressed that cycle right there follows that family time after time after time but there was a king that said I will restore he said I will restore and he put it in writing in One Moment One Moment In The Presence of that King can undo 30 years of what the enemy has done 40 Years of what the enemy has done listen he spent a lot of time into my life but One Moment In The Presence of the king he put a lot of time in the woman at the whale's life but One Moment In The Presence of the king he put a lot of time tearing up legion's life but one moment with Jesus and all of that was changed all of that was done away with all of that was gone and there was a restoration that took place all the time in one moment in the presence of the king it can be restored [Music] so Nehemiah looks at the rubble what once was mighty what once was a fortress what once was a refuge and a strong tower and he says this wall must be restored this wall must be built back because a city with Broken Walls reveals the defeated people a city with torn down walls reveals the defeated people of people who are vulnerable in a church with partial word and some truth cannot withstand the enemy the first age had left its first love and it began its Decline and it soon it found itself going into Exile just like the children of Israel had done but that didn't satisfy the enemy yeah he didn't just want him to fade away from their first love a little bit he wanted to make the gospel unrecognizable he wanted to make it impossible to be rebuilt to have it rebuilt back to where it was in the first age when Paul first preached it so he goes to work dismantling the word Peace by peace and once that false mind was in control it began to crush the life out of the church yeah the True Vine tried to stand up but the power of the false Vine being backed up by the state is what brother Brown would say they're in the church age book backed up with the power of the state would beat it back down again Time After Time After Time and so the word is stripped down and torn down and mangled up and heaped up and and true baptism has done away with and false baptism is put in its place the mystery of the godhead is torn down and heaped up and jumbled up and then put over there and burned and hidden surely that'll never be restored and they began to teach the intercession of saints and and praying to the dead becomes normalized and Purgatory begins to be told and and worship begins to be formalized right now sometimes that's one of the attacks that we don't focus on enough but if you will go back and look at the first church age enough it was the key attack that caused the falling away from what they had on the day of Pentecost to where only 30 years later Jude is saying Brothers we must contend for the faith that was once delivered they've already slid they've already fallen they've already strayed and brother Branham begins to point to the doctrine of the Nicolaitans and he begins to point to nicolaitanism and to where he says the spirit was taken from the congregation and placed upon an Unholy priesthood and formal and cold worship began to be accepted in the church I'm telling you that's something that has the Bride of Jesus Christ we should never stand for is cold and formal Worship in the house of God you say but the word has been restored it's the word it's the word that's what we're excited about that's why I'm excited that's why I shout I don't care how good you can play the piano and sing that's not what gets me excited this right here gets me excited this makes me shout I'm thankful for the restoration of the word in this day it excites us so we can worship freely come on but those things began to be stripped away from the church yes the Supernatural is buried underneath Creeds and dogmas an ungodly priesthood is set up and they make it to where the word isn't even available to be read by the common people so that wall that used to be their protection is no longer even available to that wall that used to protect I mean got them they can't even have it in their language anymore all they have is misplaced stones misplaced Rubble a portion of Truth here a piece here it's where it looked just like the walls at Jerusalem but Nehemiah was commissioned rebuild it and there was a word from the King that said I will restore saith the Lord the word will once again protect the word will once again heal the word will once again deliver the word once again will be a fortress it once again will be a refuge the word once again will be the armor that you can put on and it won't just be a partial armor it won't just be a piece of armor but it's going to be the full armor of God restored in this day and he says I will pour out my spirit on All Flesh he looks down he says I started my church the way I wanted it and now I want my church the way I started it listen he started his church the way he wanted who are we to say how it's supposed to be well how do you think the church ought to be brother Branham says that there is only one pattern for how the church is to be and he says that's the book of that the church at the beginning he said that's how I want my church that's how I started it that's how I want it to finish so I say Lord if I ain't lining up to it if we ain't operating that way help me Lord let me be willing to repent and say I've been wrong this is the pattern let's get back to the word and what the word pattern says it's supposed to be and not to Discount in any way the moves of Luther and Wesley and Azusa I was removes of God absolute moves of God but but they didn't fully restore the wall they didn't bring the gospel back to the way Paul preached it it wasn't a full restoration but what they did do was uncovered some great stones they uncovered some great stones that needed to be put back in the wall justification was dug out from underneath that Rubble oh that just shall live by faith there's a stone right there oh and then sanctification came out from the rubble there's another Stone I know where that one's supposed to be placed and then the gifts and things like that began to be placed back in the walls and now but the problem with this was is there was still liens against the church they were still Bound by false baptisms they were still held by Creeds and dogmas and man's ideas now but what you began to see was there's a foundation I can see where the wall used to be I I can see where it had once been torn down and now it's starting to come up a little bit you can tell where things had once been but you needed somebody with the commission from a king you needed somebody who had spoke to the angel you needed someone not afraid of the corrupt systems you needed someone that was from outside of the establishments we needed someone with the saith the Lord that could come back and go this Stone goes here and this Stone goes here and this don't hear and the wall got higher and the wall got stronger and the wall got thicker and I got safer and I got free and I got healed and I got saved and I got filled with the Holy Ghost because the wall was being placed in its proper place we needed someone who could go out and face the Giants of formalism who could face the Giants of denominations who could face those saying the days a miracle was passed someone who would take Hebrews 13 8 and it wouldn't just be a slogan but it would be demonstrated before the people that our God is the same yesterday today and forever you know I'll never understand people that claim to believe the message and yet don't believe in the Supernatural when the most Supernatural message that ever struck the face of the Earth you're not reading what I'm reading you're not seeing what I'm seeing you're not feeling what I'm feeling because it is Supernatural through and through and through the very theme of the message is about a supernatural God we had to have someone who would stay faithful even whenever turned their back on him even when those benefiting from the gaps in the wall told him leave those gaps alone no no no don't deal with that Gap don't deal with that the rest of the wall is good but don't hit on that right there don't mess with that Doctrine no no no no leave that alone but this man had a commission from the King not a commission from a man brother Branham says in the church age book though he will not be popular he will be Vindicated by God as Jesus authenticated John and the Holy Ghost authenticated Jesus we can well expect this man will be first of all authenticated by the spirit working in his life in Acts of power that are indisputable and found nowhere else what did we find with Nehemiah Not only was he sent but he was equipped he was commissioned he was provided for and he was Vindicated Beyond debate you know I was I was talking to brother Jackson on the way up here and I said you know I understand it elect and non-elect and people can't see things and and I understand but in this day to to be falling away now I look around I say each and every day to me William Branham has Vindicated more than he ever was before every single day to me as we go into this Insanity as we push further into this Darkness some people are going well it hadn't happened this and they're falling away and each and every day I'm looking around going it's exponentially greater than it was yesterday and it's exponentially greater than it was the day before like every the farther I go the more sure I am this man was Elijah of Malachi 4 this man was the one sent to open the Mysteries this man was the sent to point us back to the faith of the fathers this was the one commission from the angel of the Lord to rebuild the walls this was the one I have no doubts I have no questions I have no shame to stand up and say I believe that William Branham was the prophet to this age a star in the hand of God Hallelujah [Applause] and God came to see about the welfare of his people God came to close up the breaches God came to pick up the stones and put them back in place to close the gaps and the enemy hated it then they hated the messenger because he dared to seek the welfare of God's children instead of go with the status quo of religion instead of following in with their denomination instead of falling in with their group listen if I want to be guilty of choosing sides I want you sides with the word if I ever end up standing against somebody I'm not standing against anybody I'm just making sure I'm standing with the word I want to be found standing on the side of the word in every situation Nehemiah 2 10. when sand ballot the horror night and tobiah the servant of the ammonite heard of it it grieved them exceedingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel but the same thing that grieved them exceedingly brought me great joy the same thing that brought them great sorrow brought me deliverance and it brought me healing and it brought me hope and it brought me a restored family let me stop for just a second and give you a testimony because there's times in our life when we think it's beyond hope there's no way this could ever be done my son will never come back my daughter will never return I could never have the Holy Ghost this marriage can never be fixed I grew up in a dysfunctional home yeah I grew up in a home where my mom and dad did not love each other the majority of my life I can't remember them in the same room separate homes even it's where when I was 17 they finally divorced 19 and 99. my dad was diagnosed with cancer not too long ago put on hospice care some things you look at is awful and I look and say all things work together to the good of them that love the Lord and the other day I'm at home and all of a sudden brother Tim sends me a picture you know what I'm fixing to look it up this might be a little bit different but that's okay give me a second you bear with me my dad says brother Tim sends me a picture and I know you can't see this but it's my dad laying in a hospital bed and my mom's sitting next to him holding his hand and he says this is their wedding picture they just renewed their vows let me tell you something you don't know about miracles until you've seen this one you don't know about miracles till you've seen this one he said I will restore saith the Lord listen it got to the point to my shame it wasn't even something I prayed for anymore he was beyond hope it was finished it was done but he said no sir One Moment In The Presence of the king nothing is beyond hope I will restore the same message that brings confusion and anger the song brings me joy and restoration and peace poet Grieves Sam batlet and it grieved tobiah what did it do for the people 218 Nehemiah 218. then I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me as also the king's words that he had spoken unto me and they said let us that's us let us rise up and build so they strengthen their hands for this good work the message that made tobiah and those angry and send ballot angry but to the people who it was for they said let us rise up let us begin to work let us take this with our own hands it wasn't just recognizing you're right Nehemiah that wall is torn down you're right there's gaps in it you're right there needed to be a prophet you're right this message is true it wasn't just that it was let us put our hands to the work let us begin to do the work let us rise up against our enemy let us go out to war let us conquer let us do our part let us overcome let me lay my hands on the sick can they be delivered let me witness to somebody let me beat the devil down today let me be an overcomer let me put my hands to the work of the Lord good to others maybe it was silly to others maybe that religion was fine yeah to others those things were for a for a day gone by to others the the restoration wasn't necessary but to an elect people to a people called to it for people who called for this moment called for a restoration it was a call for them to rise up out of the ashes they stole my crops but they won't do it no more they trampled my Fields but they won't do it no more they're taking my children but I'm taking them back they're taking the joy out of my home but I'm claiming it back I'm gonna rise up out of the ashes and I'm gonna do my part to restore Jerusalem listen it wasn't just it wasn't just a prophet coming and saying here this truth is a stone and placing it there and this truth is a stone and placing it there it's even more than people called to the restoration work but it's recognizing that you as a people are the restoration work it's recognizing that the master builder looked and he said there's a stone and that elect seed not on the inside of you matched up perfectly with a restored word and he said you go right there and you go right there and you go there and you go there this is your place you are a portion of the restored work you are the restored Church you are here in this last day as a testimony of the restoration of almighty God you for A Mighty Fortress you're a stone in the wall today yes sir why did some catch the vision to build if we had time to go into it you would find that so many had been carried away into Babylon and when this call Goes Forth very very few returns too many got caught up in the Comforts of Babylon they didn't see a need to go back they didn't see a need to leave denominations they didn't see that knee they were comfortable where they were but some felt an urge to go back yeah what was drawn them back why did it have to be restored because Jeremiah prophesied that they would return back to the land of their fathers Jeremiah 29 10 says for thus saith the Lord that after 70 years be accomplished at Babylon I will visit you and perform my good word toward you in causing you to return to this place to the land of Abraham to the land of Isaac into the land of Jacob and this is the exact same thing in a spiritual that's prophesied there in Malachi concerning the church he prophesied that one's going to come that's going to turn your hearts back to the faith or the land of Paul of Peter and of Stephen and some people heard the call and they said no I'm good right where I'm at but others said no that's my land there's a reason I gotta go back there's a reason I got to go back there that Wall's got to be restored that City's got to be restored the New Jerusalem has got to be built oh come on somebody drew why did Jerusalem have to be rebuilt why did the wall have to be rebuilt there was a messiah coming there was a messiah coming why did you have to be restored why did Jerusalem have to be rebuilt in this day there's a messiah coming somebody's got to be ready to receive him oh he was going to ride down the streets of Jerusalem he was going to be tried in Jerusalem it had to be restored yes sir you had to be restored in this day he's coming back for somebody it's a restored people it's a people who have returned to rebuild and finish the work in this day Hallelujah the message called the people to finish the work yeah right a people now this isn't to indicate that brother Branham didn't finish his work we aren't looking for somebody to finish the message that's not the boat I'm getting in now that ain't my ship I promise you yeah we're not looking for that he ran his race yeah he finished strong he finished his course he played his part but the work didn't finish well how do you know that we're still here if we're still here then there's still work that must be done there's still seed that must be found they're still demons that will be conquered every demon will be under our feet every demon will be conquered I don't even know why I'm saying this but we think about it sometimes and we look at some of the ones that are the most despicable the most filthy in our eyes the most vile Sinners with spirits that we look at today that disgust us and turn our stomachs and we want no part of that matter of fact we don't want it sitting in our church in a sense of letting that Spirit remain on that person because then you become the cage of every unclean and hateful thing we don't mind them coming in the door as long as they're ready to change amen but what's my point if every demon is going to be conquered somebody's gonna have to face that demon that means somebody's going to be delivered of that spirit there's going to be homosexuals delivered there's going to be transgenders and all those others LBG barbecue letters that I the list has gotten so long it's basically the alphabet now there's going to be those people delivered so let's quit looking at them and you know what I what I see obviously I don't I ain't trying to hang out I'm not saying that but what I'm saying is I look at that as a potential victory God can say that one God can save that one because let me tell you what I know how vile I was I know how filthy I was and I don't put myself above no man if he could save me and he could deliver me he can deliver anybody anytime anywhere and they will be because every demon will be under our feet every spirit will be conquered the power of the Lord Jesus Christ is going to overcome and Conquer and cast out all so there's work to be done well that's good yes sir yes sir come on there's a broad body that has a work to do yes a work that she must fulfill and the message strengthened our hands it wasn't just the restoring of the word in this day but there's something that's supposed to be done with that word it's not just a collection of books and tapes how thankful I am for those things sometimes those statements get made and we get offended like oh well I'm happy about those things me too yeah right absolutely but books and tapes is not what what's taking us out of here it's the life of that word in those books and those tapes in this Bible it's the life of that thing coming into you and when it does brother Brown says the pillar of fire will put you in action yeah he said it will put you in action so if you've had an encounter with the pillar of fire it will put you in action well I'm just not geared that way stick your hand in a fire and you know what let me tell you what I fully understand that we're all geared differently we're all nature differently and I've said this so many times I'm gonna say it again so you may not act like I act when I put my hand in the fire but you're gonna act some way yeah yeah I was preaching one day about worship and I made the statement I said you know how people come up say hey where do you worship I say some of y'all couldn't say you've been like Tabernacle you might say that's where you go to church but it ain't where you worship and so I'm going along like that you have to know my dad he was a pretty girl fella and I and I said this I said I don't care what religion you are this ain't worship [Music] he came up after church I was like oh this is going to be good I'm in trouble he said you got me you you got me it's true it's the truth because I don't care how you worship but this this God deserves worship this God deserves praise when he comes in the building I say give him your all whatever you're all his some may run some may that some may shout some may just raise their hand and say thank you Jesus but whatever it is give him your praise give him your worship don't let it be robbed from you and taken from you true worship has been restored in this day to the place where it's supposed to be Hallelujah there is a work to be finished yes and some would say but Jesus finished everything he said it is finished but there has to be an application of the finished work you have to apply the finished work so there's a part for you to play brother Branham says now you have to take what he did and defeat the Devil personally he said the work was finished at Calvary we only looked to that place and by faith we draw dividends off of our Eternal salvation what we know and what we what we were taught in the message is Jesus was a complete finishing or fulfilling of the Old Testament he fulfilled all the Old Testament but not the new brother Brown says the word is in the bride as it was in Mary he said the bride has the mind of Christ for she knows what he wants done with the word she performs the command of the word in his name for she has thus saith the Lord then the word is quickened by the spirit and it comes to pass like a seed that is planted and watered it comes to full Harvest serving its purpose those in the bride do only his will no one can make them do otherwise they have thus saith the Lord or they keep still they know that it has to be God in them doing the works fulfilling his own word he did not complete all his work while he was in his Earthly Ministry so now he works in and through the bride yes sir she knows that for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must now do but he will now fulfill through the bride that work which he left for this specific time he said there's still work to be done and Christ left it and he left it for a very important person he left it for somebody that he knew he could count on he left it for somebody and he equipped him and he called them and he sent him and he commissioned them these people are the Queen of Heaven who are you talking about who's going to finish the work you're gonna finish the work he called you to do it he said I trust you I commission you I send you you go to the works oh how am I gonna do it how am I going to make this happen all you got to do is let Jesus manifest out of you just manifest Jesus and when Jesus is on the inside manifesting out then the works that I do shall you do also and even greater than that shall you do just stop for a minute quit trying quit trying to manufacture we don't want nothing manufactured but just let Jesus manifest out of your life and that'll take care of it that'll finish the work that'll finish the job where he defeated the devil you'll defeat the Devil where he cast him out you'll cast him out it's good yes sir who me yeah you know we spend so much time arguing with God over our worthiness but you're you just don't know yes he does you don't know how bad I am how much I feel he does and I'm not gonna argue with you you fail all the time the club get in line quit crying what we do when we say we're not worthy and we're not good enough and we can't overcome we take and devalue the sacrifice we say your blood ain't enough your blood ain't strong enough your blood can't fix me listen I know how weak I am but I do know that I am justified I do know that I am Sanctified I do know that I'm filled with the Holy Ghost you're lifting yourself up no sir I'm saying the atonement works the blood works the blood's been applied the blood has never lost his power no it can take the weakest sinner the most filthy Sinner and it can make him an overcomer in this last day I'm a nobody oh but thank God for the blood of Jesus that saved me that picked me up and place me as I stole in the walls yes that's you too Nehemiah wasn't going to build this wall by itself yeah his message called a people and strengthened a people to work that's why we have to find ourselves in the scripture I understand that it's it's for Authority when you see who you are in the scripture and and who you are and where you are it gives you Authority but what it also does is it shows you which part you're supposed to fulfill I'm not going to read judas's part and go that's me and I read that and I go that's not for me to fulfill I read the part about Enoch and I go there's my part to fulfill that's what I'm gonna be too many times we take those scriptures and we automatically think of other people unfortunately even like the Judas ones too oh I know who that is but we're just as guilty of taking the Overcomer scriptures and going man that brother he's a good brother he's gonna make it yeah brother Tim used to always say this when I was a kid and I never could grasp it but he used to always say if you know that there's only one going you got to know that it's you if the Lord spoke in this service today in an audible voice that I'm only taking one you got to be to the place that you know I'm not worried about everybody else yeah I know that I've met the requirement and I know he has accepted it because he has filled me with his spirit and I'm the one that's going instead of oh I know who that'd be that's brother so and so he is a Christian the same blood that applies for him Applause for you today he said Jesus knew who he was and so he knew what to fulfill brother Brown says now he said suffer this to be so John that is right in other words John you are a mighty man you are a great great Mighty prophet and your revelation of me is exactly truth if we are the lights of this day we must fulfill all righteousness all God's word must be fulfilled by us for this day for it is becoming to us behooving it's becoming it's like us in other words for if we are the true Witnesses of God today John we are the lights of this age and if we are the lights of this age there's so much scripture that's got to be fulfilled during this age it's up to us brother Brown says hallelujah some of us would go it's up to us oh no but brother Brown says it's up to us hallelujah yes it's up to us to see that all God's righteousness is fulfilled and what is righteousness his word in other words John you know who I am I am the high priest that's true John and I have need to be baptized of thee but we've got to fulfill all righteousness and I have need to be baptized of thee now to fulfill the word of God because all the word has got to be fulfilled and we are the lights of the day and it's up to us to fulfill all this and I know that your righteousness and your desire is to fulfill the word you man this is a lengthy quote brother Brown was driving at home yes he's driving it home he says it's becoming to us we are the lights the light of every age should do the same thing all right we know what's to be fulfilled you who are spiritual and know the word of God you see what God has promised now the word will not just come easy but it comes by observation you've got to press your way in to do it but yet it behooves us it is becoming to us to fill all of God's word we must do it we must do it what are you saying I'm saying this bride Ministry is the continuation of the ministry of Christ the ministry of the groom and the ministry of the Bride must be the exact same thing if it's something different then it's not the bride [Music] brother Brown says in one place that if Jesus Christ had stood up and said the days of Miracles were passed and that these things don't happen anymore it would have automatically disqualified him from being the Lamb of God and if that applies to him that applies to the bride it must be a perfect match bone of his bone flesh of his flesh the very works of Jesus Christ continued the very very casting down of Satan continued the the very power is of Hell casting doubt being cast down continued doing works just like Jesus did in sand ballot and tobiah or Satan hates it he hates seeing the work being restored not just in a body called Jesus but in a multi-membered bride of Jesus Christ and Satan sees it happening see for the first time in 2000 years Satan sees the people on the face of the Earth that are walking and operating and talking just like the first age did just like that age did and he looks at it and he says what got the first age to fall formalism and so that's why the exact same attack that came against the first age is now being used again in the second at the end time when that when that grain of wheat is begin to come up once again because he says it worked in the first age I'm going to use it again in the last stage but what Satan failed to understand is he didn't really conquer that first age that age was predestinated to go into the ground intentionally because there was a crop gonna come up in the last days there was a crop that was predestinated not to go into the ground predestinated to go into the Garner predestinated to take a Rapture it doesn't matter what he comes against us with this broad will not fall because she's predestinated to make it she's predestinated to doing a Rapture he can't stop this bride but there's words to do there's Works to claim oh come on I'm ready to do whatever it takes to take that Rapture I'm ready to do whatever it takes listen he had seen prophets come anointed men and they had fallen David Fell Samson fell but he had never seen a man like Jesus there had never been one quite like Jesus and he's seen churches come and he saw Luther's Revival die and Wesley's Revival die and Pentecost go into air but he hasn't seen one like this bride she's bold of his bone she's flesh of his flesh she's walking and doing the works of Jesus once again on Earth he hasn't seen one like this before she's predestinated not to fall right [Applause] it's good you know the devil don't mind a church sitting there cold and form on backslip he don't mind you going to church no victory yeah no overcoming yes sir yes sir enemy coming through the walls at every Gap I bother him though build all the wall you want leave that Gap yeah but let them one time quit being just hearers and start putting their hand to the work [Music] and listen to them Spirits begin to mock listen to the spirits begin to make fun Let The Works of Christ and the manifestations of the spirit begin to take place in the house of God and listen to them when the Dynamics begin to come to the mechanics brother Joe yeah when those things begin to happen and they start saying oh we don't need to preach that way no more back off that leave that Gap right there no we don't get the Holy Ghost the way they used to back off that right there you don't need an experience leave that Gap right there in the wall now the spirit don't move like that anymore that's all just worked up emotion we're gonna leave that Gap right there in the wall and they mock because the wall is being restored and once those walls are closed up they're on the wrong side and there's no more coming and going and coming and going make sure you're on the right side of the wall make sure you're on the building side [Music] Nehemiah 2 19. but when sand ballot the horror night and tobiah the servant the ammonite and gesham the Arabian heard it they laughed us to scorn and despised us and said what is this that you do yeah what is all this freedom of worship what does all this you got to have the baptism of the Holy Ghost I don't know listen to the Token that's what the prophet taught yeah people act like preaching that you got to have the baptism the Holy Ghost is a new teaching I thought it was pretty basic yeah yeah I thought that was pretty fundamental verse 20. then I answered them and said unto them the god of Heaven he will prosper us therefore we his servants will arise and we will build but ye have no portion nor right nor Memorial in Jerusalem in other words why are you worried about what we're doing this is our portion this is our inheritance that's my Rapture I ain't worried about how you like how I get to my Rapture I ain't worried about how you like when Deliverance come if you like how I act if you like how we preach if you like how we worship you don't have a portion in this anyway but to those that are the New Jerusalem we will build the wall this is our portion it's our inheritance it's our Rapture we're gonna take it ye have no portion Hallelujah it's good those that have no portion in Jerusalem mock and they make fun of but there's a people called to the work when you're called to the work you're not worried about the mockers you know you're not deterred by the naysayers you're not deterred by even your own family and let's bring it down to what most of us deal with you're not deterred by your own doubts listen let's be honest on most days we're not hearing voices out there we're hearing voices right here you're not good enough what is this what are you trying to do you think that little step matters yeah because that was a Pebble in the wall and it may not matter right now but when I put another cup and another Pebble and I take another step listen the devil likes to make fun of our steps why because he wants you to think that step was insignificant so you won't take another but if you recognize that that right there was huge and you recognize I can do that again and I can do that again and I can do that again and I can get a little closer you take a step towards God I promise you he's taking a step towards you and the Satan's going that don't matter that don't matter that don't matter but what he don't see is on the other side as Jesus is taking those steps right towards me and I promise you that matters every step he's getting closer and that breach is getting closed in and that wall is getting closed and it's sealing the enemy out don't let him minimize the steps you take don't let him minimize your prayer life in the morning or your prayer life in the evening or whenever it is you do it yeah don't let him minimize that to you it is a big thing it is an important thing repentance is important forgiveness is important getting rid of that root of bitterness in your heart is important oh that's not a big deal just hold on to it oh it's a big deal yeah it's a big deal I gave the analogy the other day I said this this right here doesn't weigh anything and I can stand right here and don't even know I'm doing it it's light but you know what I can handle this I can hold this but an hour from now it's gonna be heavy an hour from now it's gonna be real heavy but now my stubbornness is there well I can't set it down now because then what the devil will do is you hold something long enough and he'll start to convince you that's who you are yeah yeah oh you can't that's just who you are that's how God Made You God didn't make you that way God Made You free yeah and you hold this long enough and by the end of the day what it's going to do is it's going to get your arms so stiff and sore that it don't hardly want to move and it paralyzes your arm temporarily and you hold that Grudge you hold that hard feeling you hold that bitterness and it don't paralyze your arm it paralyzes your faith it paralyzes your Walt where you can't take another step and he's telling you this morning you've got work to do why don't you sit that thing down set yourself free set the thing down and walk away from it there's work for you to do quit holding that Grudge quit holding that bitterness you're only holding yourself prisoner you're only paralyzing your faith it's the enemy convincing you to hold on to that thing and he's saying just set it down this morning and do the work of the Lord there's work for you to do this morning you're called to it you're chosen for it you're equipped for it this morning brother Brown says in the carrying away of Babylon remember if God has a work for you to do all demons out of Torment can't take you they just can't startle you in any way God's got a purpose for the Holy Ghost Church and all the Devils of Hell will never be able to take it away God's got a purpose for it and it will never be destroyed until God lets it fulfill the purpose that he has ordained it to do and it will yes that doesn't sound like I hope so or maybe so he said and it will it's more than knowing there's a work to be done right right it's putting your hand s brother Branham over and over again when he's speaking on Jesus baptism he would emphasize that they both had the revelation of who both of them were oh I have the revelation of God sent a prophet I have these Revelations that's awesome you need to he says but he says they both have the revelation of who they were and but Jesus would tell John it's because of that Revelation yeah because you see because of who you are that's why we have to do what we have to do it's not just well I know who I am right good that commissions you to do the work that you're called to do brother Brown says let God live in you to vindicate the promises of this day just as John as Jesus said to John suffer it to be so John that's right but we are the messengers of this day and we've got to fulfill our righteousness and if we are the Christians of this day let's receive Jesus Christ into our heart and he is the word don't deny any of it say it's the truth and place it in your heart watch the fruit of the spirit upon you and fulfill every promise that he made in the Bible God wants to fulfill his word and he don't have any hands but mine and yours he don't have any eyes but mine and yours he has no tongue but mine and yours that's right listen I don't want to leave anything undone yeah I don't want to leave any promise unclaimed you know every other age came and they did a portion but they left a part of it unfinished they didn't claim every promise they left they left word unfulfilled because they operated under portions of the word that they operated under portions and gifts and manifestations but they were not under the anointing of the fullness that you and I have yes yes so let's key into this as we begin to bring this down it's not in this day good enough that we just work this is the day of the finished work we must finish the work because the fullness has come so they're in every other age there was always more to come they were right there's more to come and the ones who saw that moved on into the next age into the next messenger and they moved with it but now we come to an age where as far as Messengers go there is not more to come there is not another message coming this message is the finishing well how do you know that in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mysteries of God should be finished it is a finishing message we've been called to finish the work in this day and so other ages operated under portions and they operated uh under anointings and gifts and things of that nature but this is this is a group that's more than Justified that's more than Sanctified that's more than just having that's having just gifts of the Spirit but she must be bone of his bones I know we've heard that flesh of his flesh I know we've heard that what does it mean until we're operating in that way then we need to keep hearing it because we got to hear it with more than this it's got to begin to resonate I am an overcomer I am manifesting Jesus on this Earth I am called to finish this work I am not just a part of him but she is him and it behooves us to fulfill all righteousness you know we've always heard it said that you'll look in the mirror of the word look in the mirror of the word and that's usually spoken in the context of lining up your life you know well if you you're acting that way you should look in the mirror of the word you know is that how a Christian should act and I'm not saying that in a mocking way I agree you should but what I'm telling you this morning is begin to look into the mirror of the word to see what kind of victory was in the word and see if that victory in your life is matching the mirror of the word where he faced Satan and used the word and said get thee behind me Satan I can do the same thing where he casted out Satan I can do the same thing oh you think that's for preachers no I think that's for everybody in these four walls you can take the word upon your lips you can face the devil you can cast him out you can stand Toe to Toe with him and you will be victorious how do you know because she is him she will match him she will do the works that he did and it's his work being manifested through a broad body it's what we're called to not just called but equipped how long's the journey going to be because I'm going to make sure you got everything you need when are you going to return I'm going to make sure you're not left fighting one day without everything that you need I know what I'm supposed to do because I see what the groom did look in the mirror there and let the victory match the victory today he says and as he being the groom the bride has to come forth because it's part of him and it can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all the revelations any of the others has spoken of the Bride it can only manifest if it does something different from the groom it is at the bride because she is flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life power of his power so in this age it's no longer in portions like it was through the church ages under Luther and Wesley they couldn't finish the work that's right they couldn't fulfill the Great Commission they couldn't fulfill John 14 12. and you say well there's been other anointing men down Through the Ages that did that did Mighty Works absolutely sure there was there were other Mighty Men Who did the works but it says greater shall you do and the greater part of John 14 12 Finds Its fulfillment in the fullness of his coming the greater part Finds Its fulfillment in the fullness of his coming so so in the fullness of the manifestation of the son of man Ministry speak my language the third pool Ministry that's where we find the Fulfillment of the greater part of John 14 12. how can you do the works of Christ and greater to the fullness unless the fullness of the anointing of Christ is here so down Through the Ages they could not fulfill that you'll find time and time and time again we don't usually quote it most of the time when we you see people talk about end time scriptures we say Malachi 4 Luke 17 30 Revelation 10 7 but almost every time brother Branham lists those scriptures he also lists John 14 12. that's right he always lists that or mentions that as an in time scripture one example he says remember in what time is it sir how many ever heard it say Amen was it exactly right then we've got the Revelation in the last days for the message of the Lord God to gather his bride together no other age has it been promised it's promised in this age Malachi 4 Luke 17 30. Saint John 14 12 and Joel 2 38. why now because it's the Omega Church and the wall is being built back exactly how Paul preached well I don't think it's going to be exactly the way it was there all I know is that the prophet who I believe when he went beyond the curtain of time said I preached it exactly how Paul preached it now not only did he say that but the numbers of thousands and thousands and thousands the ones that were there they didn't say well actually brother Brown there's going to be more there's going to be what you don't they said we're resting on that that the wall is being built back exactly the way it was before it was torn down down through the church ages brother Branham says it has to be because a woman and her husband become one they become one and so does the bride and the Christ and Christ become one the ministry of the bride and the ministry of Christ is the same a people in this last day driven to finish the work driven to finish the wall driven to work driven to get the wall closed in to see everything placed properly to see Jerusalem made ready and it has to be made ready this has to be something we do well no no we don't have to do it actually according to John 4 34 it says Jesus said unto them my meat is to do the will of him that sent me and to finish his work the Bible tells us that the bride hath made herself ready what has she done she's finished everything that he called her to finish she's done everything the enemy is under her feet she's closed in the gaps what is it in this day driving us to do the work we're called to it when others can stand back and say it doesn't matter to me it matters to us it matters to us but I'm tired brother Aaron finish the work demons been fighting me all week brother Aaron finished the work depression is trying to come into my home finish the work I need a Deliverance in my life today brother and I say finish the work don't give up it's our time on the wall others have stood on the wall others have done their part the blood of the martyrs is on this wall I won't quit I won't stop the wall must be finished in this day it must be finished by this people it's our turn oh but the attacks are coming they're coming here they're coming there Nehemiah gave him a sword oh they mix mud with one hand and a sword in the other they laid stone with one hand and a sword in the other I say go to work and do your work with a sword in one hand wash your dishes with a sword in one hand teach your kids how to swing a sword it's time to finish the word it's time to go home it's Rapture time it's finishing time it's victory time every demon from hell is coming to try to stop us he can't stop this bread we got a sword in our man it's the king's sword it's not just some sword it's the king sword it's a sharp sword it still deserves the thoughts and tints of the heart it still heals the sick it still delivers the battle and one of these days when the work is finished it's going to take a ride home in a rapture Hallelujah will you stand to your feet with me this morning there's a work to be finished don't get distracted by the mockers Nehemiah four and one it says but it came to pass that when Sam ballot heard that we build it he was Roth and he took great indignation and mocked the Jews and he spaked before his brethren in the army of Samaria and said what do these feeble Jews those people up in Hardy Arkansas think they're doing so Fable so weak build the wall he said what do these people Jews will they fortify themselves yes sir will they sacrifice yes sir sure will they make an end in a day will they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned yeah and there's more to get I got loved ones that maybe you thought was too messed up but they're a stone in the wall too I've got victories I'm still going to win there's other stones I'm going to keep building you can mock all you want oh you think you're going to do the Greater Works yeah yeah we sure are right the king sent me and he put it in writing so I didn't even have to question he said I was going to do the Greater Works oh you think you can still receive the Holy Ghost absolutely I sure can there's a promise that says the promise is unto you and to your children and to many of them that's as far off as me as the Lord Our God shall call there's a promise there yes sir you think you can still be healed absolutely 100 percent you mind if I give a testimony real quick I promise the Lord I testify I battled some some real health problems for several years I was sent all over the place being tested in every hospital and neurological and they thought I had ALS and all kind of other things and these tests and that test they never could find the issue and I always said I don't got to know a giant's name in order to cut his head off so it's okay but I was at a youth camp in a prayer line praying for people last August brother Andrew Spencer is at the end he came down to my end where I was and he tapped me and he said your complete healing is in the room right now and I grabbed hold to that and I woke up that morning and I woke up and I didn't have a dream or anything I just woke up and it was just running through my head six months of improvement six months six I didn't know what it really was I began to apply it to my life and then that night that happened so I claimed it I've had the best six months of my entire life it's been wonderful let me tell you something I'm not testifying to the glory of the devil I'm testifying so you understand that when he comes you don't give in you don't quit you don't get off the wall we're at the six month mark and I've had about the two worst weeks I ever had brother Joe because brother Brown says the devil's always got a punch he's always going to try to get you back off last minute he's always gonna try to get you to give in and I would like to announce to him this morning this bride ain't coming off the wall I'm going to keep building I'm Gonna Keep claiming I'm Gonna Keep building I'm Healed thank you Jesus you are my healer you are the same yesterday today and forever by his stripes I'm Healed you restored my my parents you've restored my health you restored lost loved ones you've restored this word you've restored this bride and you didn't restore it for nothing it had to be restored why because there's a messiah coming there's one here that matches the one there and now there's a pool coming and the pool from up there is getting stronger than the pool here I look around I say there's nothing left in this world for me there's nothing I won't hear I just want to go home I want to finish the work this morning I want to do what he's called me to do I want to be fighting I want to be taken ground until the day I go home I'm not giving nothing back I'm not backing up I'll preach Divine Healing I'll preach the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'll preach the restoration of the gifts I'll preach the opening of the word this word is open it is restored the wall is complete and I say come Lord Jesus come Lord Jesus come we're finished in the work to every tongue and Nation we are chosen generation we are the generation with the culmination the final voice the world will hear the coming of the Lord out the Revelation overcoming sin's Temptation the truth will go to Every tongue and Nation [Music] We Are The Chosen generation oh yes we are the generation we're the culmination the final voice the world will hear the coming of the Lord is here living out the Revelation overcoming since Temptation the truth will go to Every tongue and Nation We Are The Chosen amen do you believe that this morning yes the coming of the Lord is near you bow your heads with me for just a moment you know made a point while I was preaching that there's no step in the rebuilding and the restoration that's a small step every Pebble in the wall is important Every Soul that we listen it's an individual walk but it's a group Rapture and what I mean by that is I can't go till every single one that's called to go is ready I can't go without you if your name's on that book so it may seem like a small step but I'm just asking this if you've been struggling if you laid your sword down if you hadn't been on that wall building and doing the work that you've been called to do like you know you should in this morning you 'd say Lord I'm getting back on the wall but I'm picking back up right where I let off I'm getting a sword in one hand I'm getting my building materials in the other I know I'm part of that chosen generation I know I'm called for this I didn't come out of denomination I didn't come out of the world I didn't leave all that behind to quit and today Lord I just want to lift my hand to you and say I'm getting back on the wall this morning I'm getting back on the wall this morning I'm coming back to what you called me to be I'm not gonna stop short I'm not going to settle short I know there's more for me I know there's more for me to do oh Hallelujah hands all across this place listen it was a group effort the Bible would say that they sent every man to his own place to build the wall so if we all built our part and you didn't build yours there was still a gap there I can't seal the wall up without you you can't seal the wall up without me we all got to do our part oh Father this morning our hands are lifted saying we're getting on the wall this morning Lord we're gonna make sure we're on the right side of the wall we're adding Stones we're adding more to Lord you sitting to see about your people Lord and you restored the truth the wall was built back up but we got a job to do we got to carry this message to the coming of the lord lord I believe with all my heart there's still seeds out there there's still chosen generation out there there's still those that need Deliverance there's still those that need to overcome but we ain't leaving them behind we ain't giving up on them we're not just gonna walk out of here without them we're saying pick up your sword get back on the wall build with us this morning because the coming of the Lord is near Lord I Thank you for each soul for each Heart Lord that you've touched I ask that it'll burn bright in the days and weeks and months ahead may they find the ability to work and fight work and fight because this is the chosen generation we place it in your hands father we love you in Jesus name [Music] We Are The Chosen generation can you sing it again with all your hearts now we are
