[47:14] i know that god sees in every need
[47:18] he's a real god today that wants to meet
[47:20] your needs
[47:21] whatever they might be heavenly father
[47:25] you see these needs that are represented
[47:27] among the people

[47:31] well
[47:32] in my own life lord one of us are human
[47:35] god and we're subject to the things of
[47:37] the world but
[47:39] yet we believe there's a higher power
[47:41] here today that
[47:43] can take every need lord that we have
[47:45] and make it like
[47:46] nothing that mountain that is before us
[47:49] lord if we speak to it by your word
[47:52] you can be gone in the name of jesus and

[48:02] that's sitting here today
[48:03] each one that is streaming lord on the
[48:05] internet i i pray god that you would
[48:08] just move in every home and every life
[48:11] may we not be the same when we leave as
[48:13] when we come in but may we recognize the
[48:15] power of your word

[48:24] ourselves to your word today

[49:24] you if you could turn me down just a
[49:25] little bit i feel like i'm
[49:27] i'm echoing to myself i don't like to
[49:29] hear myself that much
[49:32] amen i think it's assumed that preachers
[49:35] like to hear themselves talk but
[49:38] that's not why we do it or shouldn't be
[49:39] why we do it anyway is that right
[49:41] amen isaiah chapter 60. i want to read
[49:45] verses one through three and then i'll
[49:46] have you be seated and then we'll read
[49:48] isaiah 61.
[49:51] isaiah chapter 60 verses one through
[49:54] three but keep your bibles open
[50:00] if you wonder what we believe we believe
[50:02] the word of the lord
[50:04] and we believe that the bible is the
[50:05] word of god
[50:07] and it was written for our edification
[50:10] and every scripture
[50:12] is for that purpose and so we want to be
[50:14] edified by it today
[50:16] isaiah chapter 60 and verse 1 arise
[50:19] shine
[50:20] for thy light has come and the glory of
[50:24] the lord is risen upon thee
[50:27] for behold the darkness shall cover the
[50:29] earth and gross darkness the people
[50:32] we're living there gross
[50:35] darkness the people but the lord shall
[50:39] arise upon
[50:40] thee and his glory shall be seen
[50:43] upon thee amen what a promise
[50:48] says and the gentiles that's us shall
[50:50] come to thy light
[50:51] kings to the brightness of thy rising
[50:55] i pray the lord would add his blessing
[50:56] to the word you may be seated and then
[50:58] we're going to read
[50:59] again from isaiah 61
[51:02] and verse 1 so just keep your bibles
[51:04] open isaiah 61
[51:06] and 1 it says the spirit of the lord god
[51:10] is upon me because the lord hath
[51:11] anointed me to preach good tidings and
[51:13] to the meek
[51:14] he has sent me to bind up the
[51:16] brokenhearted to proclaim
[51:18] liberty to the captives the opening of
[51:20] the prison to them that are bound
[51:22] to proclaim the acceptable year of the
[51:24] lord
[51:25] the day of vengeance of our god to
[51:27] comfort all that mourn
[51:29] to appoint unto them that mourn in zion
[51:32] given to them beauty for ashes all of
[51:36] joy for mourning so in other words at a
[51:38] time when they should be mourning
[51:40] i'm going to give them joy and so it
[51:43] relates to us in a time of darkness
[51:45] they'll have light and the time of when
[51:46] they should be mourning they'll have joy
[51:48] the garment of praise for the spirit of
[51:51] heaviness
[51:52] that they might be called trees of
[51:53] righteousness notice
[51:55] the planting of the lord that he might
[51:58] be glorified
[52:00] it says in verse 4 they shall build the
[52:02] old wastes
[52:04] they shall raise up the former
[52:05] desolations
[52:07] they shall repair the waste cities the
[52:10] desolations of many
[52:12] generations you see brother ben but you
[52:14] don't realize what's in my family and
[52:16] what my family's been like what my
[52:18] situation is but he said they'll rebuild
[52:21] the waste cities and the desolations of
[52:24] many
[52:24] generations sin that has continued
[52:28] generation after generation they'll
[52:31] break the cycle
[52:33] amen and strangers shall stand and feed
[52:36] your flocks and the sons
[52:38] and the aliens shall be your plowmen and
[52:40] your vine dressers
[52:41] but you shall be named the priests of
[52:43] the lord
[52:44] men shall call you the ministers of our
[52:47] god
[52:47] you shall eat the riches of the gentiles
[52:49] in their glory
[52:51] shall you boast yourselves for your
[52:53] shame you shall have double and for
[52:55] confusion
[52:56] they shall rejoice in their portion
[52:57] therefore in their land
[52:59] they shall possess the double
[53:00] everlasting joy shall be unto them
[53:03] for i the lord love judgment i hate
[53:06] robbery for burnt offering
[53:08] he says and i will direct their work in
[53:10] truth and i will make an everlasting
[53:11] covenant
[53:12] with them and their seed shall be known
[53:15] among the gentiles
[53:16] and their offspring among the people all
[53:19] that see them shall acknowledge them
[53:21] that they are the seed
[53:23] which the lord hath blessed listen
[53:26] to verse 10 and verse 11 now as we come
[53:28] to our our sermon this morning he said i
[53:30] will greatly
[53:31] rejoice in the lord my soul shall be
[53:35] joyful in my god
[53:36] where he hath clothed me with garments
[53:38] of salvation
[53:39] it covered me with the robe of
[53:41] righteousness as a bridegroom
[53:43] decath himself with ornaments as a bride
[53:46] adorneth herself with her jewels
[53:48] for as the earth bringeth forth her bud
[53:52] and that's the time of year that we're
[53:54] living in right now the earth is
[53:56] bringing forth her blood
[53:58] and as the garden causeth the things
[54:00] that are sown in it
[54:02] notice the wording the garden causes the
[54:04] things that are sown in it
[54:06] to spring forth so the lord god
[54:10] will cause righteousness and praise to
[54:13] spring
[54:13] forth before all the nations
[54:18] do you believe what you read amen
[54:22] we could close up and shop right now and
[54:24] go home
[54:26] but i want to talk to you this morning
[54:28] about an unstoppable
[54:30] resurrection an unstoppable
[54:34] resurrection you see the nature of a
[54:36] seed is to reproduce itself for the
[54:38] salmon exactly
[54:40] right if you plant a corn into the
[54:43] ground
[54:44] a seed of corn you expect a corn plant
[54:47] right if you plant a tomato you you
[54:50] expect tomatoes
[54:52] that's what you expect to see because
[54:55] the seed
[54:55] within itself is the ability to
[54:57] reproduce notice what
[54:59] uh god says in genesis 1 11 it says and
[55:02] god
[55:02] said let the earth bring forth grass
[55:06] now think about this think about the
[55:07] power of a god who can do this
[55:09] and this is why we we focus on the word
[55:12] we make the word the most
[55:13] important part of the service because
[55:16] when god
[55:16] said god said not the pastor said not
[55:21] somebody else said
[55:22] but god fit remember what we said the
[55:24] absolute is what god says
[55:27] right and god said let the earth bring
[55:30] forth grass
[55:31] and grass came out and if there's a god
[55:33] that's
[55:34] that powerful to be able to bring grass
[55:37] out of the ground
[55:38] because of his word how much more
[55:41] could he could he affects your life by
[55:44] the word
[55:46] amen and again you say well i don't i i
[55:49] you don't know my past you don't know
[55:50] what i've been through but i know my god
[55:52] and i know a god who come to an earth
[55:54] that was full of chaos
[55:56] an earth that was without form and void
[55:58] in genesis 1 1
[55:59] and he come to it and he said let there
[56:01] be light and when the light
[56:03] come it began to form something by the
[56:05] david out of all that chaos
[56:06] out of all that confusion out of all the
[56:08] darkness that was there
[56:10] in the earth at that time god began to
[56:12] form and make a light
[56:13] god began to make a world out of that oh
[56:16] my if we could recognize that same god
[56:18] is here this morning
[56:20] and he's willing and wants to make a
[56:21] world that that is according to his own
[56:24] liking
[56:25] he wants to in your life he wants to see
[56:27] a family that serves god a
[56:30] people that love god of people that
[56:31] worship god he wants to form that
[56:33] in your own life and god said
[56:38] we can't stop like that on every word
[56:40] we're going to be here a while
[56:42] god said let the earth bring forth grass
[56:44] the herb yielding seed
[56:46] and notice how he says that not just
[56:48] that it would come but it would yield
[56:49] seed
[56:51] right and the fruit tree yielding fruit
[56:53] after his kind
[56:55] christians produce christians this isn't
[56:57] legalism this is just what
[56:59] we believe that the word if you believe
[57:02] it it will reproduce the word in your
[57:04] life
[57:06] right if god is in us and we believe
[57:08] that he is then he we reproduce the word
[57:10] in our lives it don't mean we're perfect
[57:12] we make lots of mistakes but that's the
[57:13] flesh but there's something inside of us
[57:16] that reproduces the word and god said
[57:18] let the earth bring forth grass the herb
[57:20] yielding seed the fruit tree yielding
[57:22] fruit after its kind
[57:24] notice whose seed is in itself go back
[57:27] just a moment
[57:28] a little bit too fast for me there
[57:30] brother robert whose seed is in itself
[57:32] upon the earth and it was so
[57:34] i feel bad for brother robert i go so
[57:36] fast he has to anticipate
[57:38] my my next move so the seed is in itself
[57:42] and it was so now the next verse
[57:46] and the earth brought forth grass notice
[57:49] what happened when god said it that's
[57:50] what it did
[57:52] amen aren't you glad to serve a god like
[57:55] that
[57:56] and the herb yielding seed after his
[57:58] kind
[57:59] it didn't bring anything else god said
[58:02] an apple that's what it was god said let
[58:06] it be whatever that it was
[58:08] and there was nothing hurtful there
[58:09] there was no thorn
[58:11] or nothing that that could hurt you
[58:13] remember the thorns and thistles come up
[58:15] after the fall but it was god in that
[58:18] original creation
[58:20] that everything was just the way he was
[58:22] supposed to be and was just perfect in
[58:24] his creation
[58:25] and you can see the elements of that
[58:27] today still in creation that you can see
[58:29] how one
[58:30] feeds off of another how each one fits
[58:32] just perfectly in the ecosystem
[58:34] so that if you take one kind of animal
[58:36] or fruit out of an ecosystem it begins
[58:38] to fall apart
[58:40] why because god made it just so perfect
[58:42] the way it was
[58:45] amen and god saw
[58:48] that it was good now the tree yielding
[58:51] fruit the seed was in itself after his
[58:52] kind and god saw that it was good
[58:55] now what do we have today he said well
[58:57] brother ben how come everything's not
[58:58] perfect today well because
[59:00] of something we would call hybridization
[59:04] we the seeds that god put on the ground
[59:08] all came out of the out of the essence
[59:12] of who god is
[59:14] right so whatever god said if god was
[59:17] goodness and light and purity and
[59:19] holiness and grace
[59:21] whatever seed god produces had to be
[59:23] that
[59:25] right it had to be that it couldn't be
[59:27] anything else but that
[59:29] so it has to be goodness has to be love
[59:32] and that's what the word of god will
[59:33] produce in your life you see how do you
[59:36] know that well i know because the word
[59:37] says so because i know it because it
[59:39] does it
[59:41] right in our lives we can see it
[59:44] and so he he produces that out of
[59:47] himself
[59:48] every every kind of thing that was there
[59:50] so but if you take those things
[59:52] you begin to mix them because satan
[59:54] can't create all he can do is pervert
[59:56] and you see that in the world that we
[59:58] live in today and so god made it a
[1:00:00] certain way but you take those things
[1:00:01] and begin to change the definition of it
[1:00:03] and mix it and make it something it
[1:00:04] wasn't supposed to be
[1:00:05] and what happens god saw it was good
[1:00:08] originally
[1:00:09] so what would be the perversion of it it
[1:00:12] would be something that's not good
[1:00:16] right if what god said is good then if i
[1:00:18] take it and begin to mess with it
[1:00:20] it's something that's not good
[1:00:24] and so in leviticus 19 and 19 is an old
[1:00:28] testament principle says you shall keep
[1:00:29] my statute thou shall not let thy cattle
[1:00:31] gender with the diverse kind
[1:00:33] i shall not sow thy filled with a
[1:00:34] mingled seed neither shall a garment
[1:00:36] mingle of linen and woolen come upon
[1:00:38] thee which i probably break that law
[1:00:39] right here today
[1:00:41] just having these clothes on but it was
[1:00:42] for a purpose
[1:00:44] god was doing something he hated the
[1:00:46] mixing of seeds
[1:00:48] because it changes what the seed becomes
[1:00:54] right
[1:00:56] oh god didn't make any seedless
[1:00:58] watermelons
[1:01:01] much as we like them the the thing about
[1:01:05] being seedless is you can't
[1:01:06] plant it in the ground i remember when
[1:01:09] we were kids we'd take them watermelons
[1:01:11] and eat them and
[1:01:12] and throw the rinds over the side of the
[1:01:14] of the fence and next year there'd be
[1:01:16] watermelons come up
[1:01:18] because there was still seeds on them
[1:01:20] watermelon and they began to come up why
[1:01:22] because it reproduces itself
[1:01:24] you can take a seedless watermelon out
[1:01:26] there all day and i don't think you'll
[1:01:27] get much
[1:01:30] it may have something that kind of looks
[1:01:32] like a seed but it's got no life in it
[1:01:35] and that's the best the church can do
[1:01:37] today in its hybrid condition
[1:01:39] that's what the modern church in the
[1:01:41] modern world becomes is a
[1:01:43] is a seed that can't produce a life all
[1:01:46] it is is a
[1:01:47] is an ineffective little little
[1:01:49] approximation of what a seed should be
[1:01:52] but the real seed of god will produce a
[1:01:53] watermelon every time
[1:01:56] right so god doesn't make it
[1:02:00] seedless like that as convenient as it
[1:02:02] might be
[1:02:04] right and i have no problem with you
[1:02:06] eating a seedless watermelon that's the
[1:02:08] kind i like too if i eat it in the house
[1:02:10] but god didn't make it that way
[1:02:14] right now notice the wording in genesis
[1:02:16] chapter 2 genesis 2 and 1
[1:02:18] says thus the heavens and the earth were
[1:02:20] finished and all the hosts of them
[1:02:22] notice he says finished finished
[1:02:26] and on the seventh day god ended his
[1:02:29] work
[1:02:30] which he had made and he rested now why
[1:02:33] did he rest not because he got tired
[1:02:36] he rested because it was complete
[1:02:39] right it was finished it was what he
[1:02:41] wanted it to be
[1:02:44] you seeing god wants to work in your
[1:02:45] life until it's what he wants it to be
[1:02:50] amen so he rested on the seventh day
[1:02:52] from all his work which he had made
[1:02:55] and verse three and god bless the
[1:02:58] seventh day
[1:02:59] and sanctified it because that in it he
[1:03:02] had rested
[1:03:03] from all his work which god created and
[1:03:06] made now notice god never created
[1:03:08] anything else
[1:03:11] now watch he said god still creates yes
[1:03:14] he does but he creates what he's already
[1:03:15] created
[1:03:17] he doesn't create a new form of life
[1:03:21] after creation god could create a
[1:03:24] squirrel today
[1:03:26] right we know that we believe that but
[1:03:28] it's going to be
[1:03:29] something he already created why because
[1:03:32] it was good
[1:03:35] he was resting because everything was
[1:03:36] the way he wanted it
[1:03:40] amen hallelujah
[1:03:43] everything was just the way he wanted he
[1:03:45] didn't make anything else
[1:03:47] and so he didn't leave any of his
[1:03:48] attributes to be expressed
[1:03:51] at least the ones that were to be
[1:03:53] expressed at that time were all
[1:03:55] expressed
[1:03:56] are you with me now and whatever other
[1:03:59] attributes he had like mercy and grace
[1:04:01] and those things could not be expressed
[1:04:03] because it wasn't needed yet right
[1:04:06] and so there had to come a fall
[1:04:10] and this is what we don't understand god
[1:04:11] wants to do things in your life
[1:04:13] but sometimes you have to watch a life
[1:04:15] get broken before it can be remade
[1:04:18] and the reason for that is because god
[1:04:21] wanted something to
[1:04:22] express a particular attribute of
[1:04:24] salvation a mercy
[1:04:26] of love in your life he wanted to show
[1:04:28] that in you
[1:04:29] and so he had to let you break yourself
[1:04:31] he didn't do it to you
[1:04:32] but he let you do it just like he let
[1:04:34] his children do it in the garden of eden
[1:04:36] so that you'd come out on the other side
[1:04:39] and he could
[1:04:40] express that attribute so all the
[1:04:41] attributes he could express at that time
[1:04:43] were expressed now
[1:04:47] brother branham tells us that he does
[1:04:49] the same thing
[1:04:51] with salvation he rested
[1:04:57] and you become a sealed finished
[1:04:59] creation
[1:05:01] and you rest from your works when you
[1:05:04] receive the holy ghost
[1:05:06] right and you say brother ben how do you
[1:05:09] believe
[1:05:10] that you received the holy ghost well
[1:05:11] you do it according to the original
[1:05:12] prescription which is acts 2
[1:05:14] peter said repent and be baptized in the
[1:05:17] name of jesus christ for the remission
[1:05:18] of your sins and you shall receive the
[1:05:20] gift of the holy ghost
[1:05:22] right and you may shout haul or scream
[1:05:24] speak in tongues they did that day they
[1:05:26] staggered like drunk men
[1:05:29] right and but those things were all done
[1:05:32] but
[1:05:32] the fact that you followed god's
[1:05:34] commands
[1:05:36] full obedience to the word of god
[1:05:37] entitles you to to the token
[1:05:39] which is the holy ghost now which a
[1:05:42] token is something that you take
[1:05:44] and excuse me if i'm being elementary
[1:05:46] this morning but i'm trying to help us
[1:05:47] understand completely what i'm talking
[1:05:48] about as much as i can
[1:05:51] and the lord will help you with the rest
[1:05:52] but a token is something that you have
[1:05:54] to have to get on an airplane
[1:05:56] you have to have to get on a train and
[1:05:59] he said the holy spirit the blood will
[1:06:00] be a token
[1:06:01] for you so that you can make it to the
[1:06:04] other side
[1:06:05] you can make it in a rapture now when
[1:06:07] you receive that token you're
[1:06:09] finished work god's rest in your life
[1:06:12] as far as the attributes he can express
[1:06:14] in this body
[1:06:18] because there's things he can't express
[1:06:20] in this flesh body
[1:06:22] you'll have to express on the other side
[1:06:24] but yet in this body
[1:06:26] we're limited by the flesh but god
[1:06:29] everything the potential they say well
[1:06:31] why isn't my life look different why
[1:06:32] can't i speak to the storm why can't
[1:06:34] well because it has to grow
[1:06:36] right those things that are planted in
[1:06:38] your life you're the planting of the
[1:06:40] lord but you've got to water it
[1:06:42] you've got to come to church you've got
[1:06:44] to live for god not because somebody
[1:06:45] makes you do us but we don't have
[1:06:47] membership we don't have any
[1:06:48] you sign up for anything but but you
[1:06:50] come because you want to grow
[1:06:52] you want to become more like christ
[1:06:56] you want to become more like him and so
[1:06:58] you you become that now
[1:07:00] brother branham talks about about
[1:07:02] hybridization and power of
[1:07:03] transformation excuse me i'm going to
[1:07:05] read some this morning but
[1:07:06] you'll be able to read along with me so
[1:07:08] i trust it won't be
[1:07:09] too hard on you but but this i believe
[1:07:12] this is the light that we've received in
[1:07:14] this hour on the word of god
[1:07:16] now uh brother brown says now look they
[1:07:19] take certain things and put certain
[1:07:20] things together
[1:07:22] it makes a chemical that will destroy
[1:07:24] that weed killer brother david that we
[1:07:25] used out in the parking lot you used up
[1:07:27] a parking lot yesterday
[1:07:28] that weed killer is made up of chemicals
[1:07:32] but where do they get the chemicals from
[1:07:33] well on some basic level it has to be
[1:07:36] it has to come from the earth right they
[1:07:39] can't create it
[1:07:41] they just mix it together
[1:07:44] right he said now leave them in their
[1:07:46] right position they're all right
[1:07:49] but put them together they're all wrong
[1:07:53] that'll make you think differently when
[1:07:54] you say boy that preacher can really put
[1:07:56] it together
[1:08:01] well you have to be careful what you put
[1:08:02] together
[1:08:05] because you don't want a cow eating
[1:08:06] grass in the top of the tree
[1:08:09] right you don't belong there right
[1:08:13] so he says to put them together they're
[1:08:15] all wrong see it brings death
[1:08:17] and he says when you try to take the
[1:08:19] word of god and put it in the religion
[1:08:20] of this world you bring death to
[1:08:22] yourself
[1:08:24] it kills the subject it kills the person
[1:08:27] he said you've got to let everything
[1:08:28] fall aside
[1:08:30] and take the word only are you willing
[1:08:32] to do that today
[1:08:33] let everything else fall aside and take
[1:08:35] the word only whatever god says
[1:08:37] not what the pastor says see you can't
[1:08:40] do it just because i get up and say this
[1:08:41] is the way you should live
[1:08:43] that that's a poor way to live because i
[1:08:45] said so
[1:08:46] or because some other man said so or
[1:08:48] because you see everybody else doing it
[1:08:49] but because the word of god says so
[1:08:52] right you've got to let everything fall
[1:08:54] aside and take the word only stay right
[1:08:56] with that word don't leave
[1:08:58] when god said so that's just what it is
[1:09:00] he says i don't care what education can
[1:09:02] prove because
[1:09:02] education can tell you well if you
[1:09:04] hybridize it it'll create something but
[1:09:06] it can never be as good
[1:09:08] as what it was in the beginning
[1:09:11] amen amen
[1:09:14] are you with me this morning i said that
[1:09:17] wednesday night and i wasn't sure
[1:09:23] now he said but they say today
[1:09:26] he said in the days of noah they could
[1:09:28] prove there was no water if they're in
[1:09:29] the skies but god said there was some
[1:09:30] coming down and it come and they say
[1:09:33] today there's no fire up there to fall
[1:09:36] but watch it fall one day how are we
[1:09:38] going to do this and that watch god do
[1:09:40] it
[1:09:41] he will he said it would do it
[1:09:44] amen and that seed will take a hold
[1:09:47] somewhere
[1:09:49] hallelujah there's something about it
[1:09:50] you don't know what it is you don't even
[1:09:52] know why
[1:09:52] you're attracted to it but there's
[1:09:54] something about it it's so different
[1:09:55] from everything else but it
[1:09:56] attracts you why there's something
[1:09:58] original inside of you
[1:09:59] that speaks to that original word inside
[1:10:03] of you is a betting ground or
[1:10:04] a place for the word to be planted amen
[1:10:08] hallelujah now he said how are we going
[1:10:11] to do this and that watch god do it he
[1:10:13] will he said it would do it
[1:10:15] he said that seed will take a hold
[1:10:16] somewhere glory to god the only thing
[1:10:17] he's looking for today is a bedding
[1:10:18] ground
[1:10:19] somewhere that it can bed it'll start in
[1:10:23] somebody
[1:10:25] now watch it will but now he says
[1:10:27] they'll pervert it and spray it like he
[1:10:29] did eve
[1:10:30] it started in eve for her to bed forth
[1:10:32] and report sons of god not sons of satan
[1:10:34] but she was a betting ground that fell
[1:10:36] in the wrong place so
[1:10:38] the word fallen an unbeliever or a
[1:10:39] doubter or a skeptic remember he told
[1:10:41] her don't do this
[1:10:42] huh but instead of that instead of her
[1:10:45] following the word she stepped out from
[1:10:46] behind the word and did what she was
[1:10:47] told not to do
[1:10:50] right you understand and and now she
[1:10:52] become a betting ground for the wrong
[1:10:53] thing
[1:10:54] and produce the wrong thing because of
[1:10:56] unbelief
[1:10:58] now he said so the word phone an
[1:11:00] unbeliever or a doubter or a skeptic
[1:11:02] it'll make a church member out of them
[1:11:04] but never a son or daughter of god
[1:11:10] see being a son or daughter of god so
[1:11:12] much different from being a church
[1:11:14] member
[1:11:15] being a son or daughter of god means
[1:11:17] being a church member means that you
[1:11:19] expect
[1:11:20] that when the baby falls sick that you
[1:11:22] can call the pastor and you should
[1:11:23] you should be able to do that but being
[1:11:25] a son or daughter of god
[1:11:27] means that you expect to be able to pray
[1:11:29] and god to hear that prayer
[1:11:33] amen and so you expect the things to
[1:11:37] come to pass in your life and so
[1:11:39] he says he said you tell them to let
[1:11:42] their
[1:11:42] hair grow they laugh in your face you
[1:11:44] tell them to do this or that or the man
[1:11:46] to do with the left in your face it's
[1:11:47] not sons of god you tell them what the
[1:11:48] word says
[1:11:49] they won't do it you see he said it's
[1:11:50] the wrong bedding ground yet they're
[1:11:52] holding the seed
[1:11:53] see the false anointed ones are anointed
[1:11:55] yes with the holy spirit speak in
[1:11:56] tongues do signs and wonders but it's of
[1:11:58] satan
[1:11:59] he said well that's hard to understand
[1:12:00] listen jesus said many will come to me
[1:12:03] in that day and say lord lord have not i
[1:12:04] cast out devils
[1:12:06] work great mighty works in wonders and
[1:12:07] he said depart from me you workers of
[1:12:09] iniquity
[1:12:10] what is iniquity david said if i
[1:12:12] conceive iniquity in my heart god will
[1:12:13] not hear me
[1:12:14] and iniquity is something that you know
[1:12:16] you ought to do and you won't do it
[1:12:19] you know better but you won't do it it's
[1:12:20] iniquity see
[1:12:24] the condition is just just too much
[1:12:26] brother ben to do it
[1:12:28] you know why i take my coat off i know i
[1:12:30] shouldn't do it
[1:12:32] because it looks better when my coat's
[1:12:34] on when you're my size in shape
[1:12:37] but the conditions are too hot
[1:12:42] right that's what people are they know
[1:12:45] they should stay with the word
[1:12:46] but for the church's sake or somebody
[1:12:48] else's sake or something else
[1:12:50] you'll stray from the word of god and do
[1:12:52] what the organization says
[1:12:54] well i don't know my church says we
[1:12:55] should do it this way and i believe it
[1:12:57] this way
[1:12:58] see and it's right before you that you
[1:13:00] shouldn't do it that's iniquity depart
[1:13:01] from me that you that work iniquity
[1:13:03] he said look at the great saint paul in
[1:13:05] first corinthians 13 he said though i
[1:13:06] speak with the tongue
[1:13:07] men and angels he said now you that one
[1:13:11] or somebody want to lay onto that that's
[1:13:12] the evidence of the holy ghost
[1:13:14] but also though i speak with tongues
[1:13:15] like men and angels have not charity
[1:13:18] he said i am nothing no he said you can
[1:13:21] speak with tongues yes because it's the
[1:13:23] word
[1:13:25] right now whatever the word says but
[1:13:28] we're not going to attach then see
[1:13:30] what the pentecostal church did they
[1:13:31] said if you speak in tongues
[1:13:33] that's the evidence that you have the
[1:13:34] holy ghost but the bible didn't say that
[1:13:38] right so they added something different
[1:13:40] to what the word says
[1:13:42] and when they did it produces something
[1:13:44] that's not right
[1:13:46] not original right and so he said
[1:13:49] but the true he said
[1:13:53] let me go back there 174 you can speak
[1:13:55] with tongues yes because it's the word a
[1:13:56] preacher can take this word
[1:13:58] and go forth and preach it and say that
[1:14:00] word and that word will grow
[1:14:04] but the preacher could be a hypocrite
[1:14:05] himself it's the word
[1:14:09] right and that's why somebody could say
[1:14:10] well well i can't listen to no preacher
[1:14:12] because there's no preacher good enough
[1:14:13] but it's the word
[1:14:16] right it's not the preacher it's the
[1:14:18] word
[1:14:19] i believe the preacher ought to live
[1:14:21] what he preaches
[1:14:22] or stop preaching right but
[1:14:25] you don't look at that even if the
[1:14:27] preacher doesn't live it is it the word
[1:14:28] or not
[1:14:31] right now but the true living creature
[1:14:34] of god
[1:14:35] takes all the purpose the word man all
[1:14:38] that god purposed all the word
[1:14:39] man shall not live by bread alone but by
[1:14:42] every word that proceedeth out and you
[1:14:44] add something else with that
[1:14:45] you get a perverted plant he said if i
[1:14:47] started out here with a wheat put a
[1:14:49] cocklebur with it and would interbreed
[1:14:50] them together
[1:14:51] if it could be done so by the pollen but
[1:14:53] in there i got a weak cuckleberry
[1:14:55] it looks like a wheat yet it's a cockle
[1:14:56] bird ain't genuine life
[1:14:58] it can't reproduce itself again it'll
[1:15:00] come forth but it can't reproduce itself
[1:15:04] it's important it can come forth it
[1:15:05] looks like the original
[1:15:07] but it can't reproduce itself a donkey
[1:15:10] can breathe to a mere horse she'll bring
[1:15:11] forth a mule but the mule can't breathe
[1:15:12] back to a mule it's a hybrid
[1:15:14] he said let every word bring forth of
[1:15:16] its kind see it can breed once and the
[1:15:17] church can come in as an organization
[1:15:19] once but it can't re-breed itself and
[1:15:22] brings out another organization that's
[1:15:23] why we say every organization goes to
[1:15:25] seed
[1:15:27] i see in every age there's a there's a
[1:15:29] sowing and a heart and a reefing in
[1:15:30] every age
[1:15:32] as the light comes across every age
[1:15:34] there's a sowing and reaping the sowing
[1:15:36] of that age and a reaping of that age
[1:15:37] but
[1:15:38] that that that which was not right that
[1:15:41] which was not correct
[1:15:42] goes to seed why it's been in the field
[1:15:46] too long
[1:15:47] you know what that is you leave it out
[1:15:48] there long enough it'll go to seed
[1:15:50] and so brother brandon talked about
[1:15:51] denominationalism going to seed
[1:15:53] it'll pick out something and count down
[1:15:56] on it and make that its
[1:15:57] focus instead of preaching the whole
[1:15:59] word of god well i could stop there and
[1:16:01] preach for a while
[1:16:04] and all it preaches is one thing because
[1:16:06] it's went to seed
[1:16:09] and it can't it it dies every time it
[1:16:12] dies
[1:16:12] he said it can't he said lutheran can't
[1:16:15] breathe to the lutheran and brought out
[1:16:16] a method of
[1:16:17] methodists brought out a pentecostal and
[1:16:19] now
[1:16:20] he said he said see it can't rebreat
[1:16:23] back because it's dead it can't start a
[1:16:25] revival
[1:16:26] where did god ever start a revival in an
[1:16:27] organization
[1:16:29] look over your history what happened he
[1:16:30] started a revival in the organization
[1:16:31] kicked it out every time that's what
[1:16:34] what it does look back in history look
[1:16:37] over history never did it's the
[1:16:38] organization that forms behind the
[1:16:40] revival
[1:16:41] when luther the man of god come forth
[1:16:43] with the message of justification behind
[1:16:44] him come to lutheran church
[1:16:46] they could never could build up then god
[1:16:48] sent a man by the name of john wesley
[1:16:50] there come a revival behind that what
[1:16:51] they do organized it never could rebring
[1:16:53] itself again
[1:16:54] it's sterile he said hallelujah
[1:16:58] but the word of god shall ever endure
[1:17:01] that's right it'll bring forth after
[1:17:03] it's kind
[1:17:05] what do you need to do brother ben to
[1:17:06] have revival in the church preach the
[1:17:08] word
[1:17:11] amen i don't need to pump it up prime it
[1:17:14] up whatever i have to know i don't need
[1:17:16] to bring in a great big band or have
[1:17:17] or lower the lights or anything else
[1:17:19] what do i need to do preach the word
[1:17:21] because the word will produce word verse
[1:17:25] and it'll produce what was on the day of
[1:17:26] pentecost
[1:17:29] hallelujah amen the word of god shall
[1:17:32] ever endure
[1:17:33] it'll bring forth of its kind if it ever
[1:17:35] brought forth a church it was on fire
[1:17:37] it'll bring forth another church that's
[1:17:38] on fire
[1:17:39] if it ever brought forth the people that
[1:17:41] love god with all of their life
[1:17:43] families that could serve god together
[1:17:45] people that could have
[1:17:46] relationships that were clean and godly
[1:17:48] if it ever produced that loss
[1:17:50] it'll produce it again hallelujah
[1:17:54] don't tell me it's just for another day
[1:17:56] or it's another time or your old
[1:17:57] fashioned
[1:17:58] no god if it ever worked it'll work
[1:18:00] again
[1:18:03] preach the word i got reeled down a
[1:18:06] couple weeks ago and i
[1:18:07] i was struggling to see my way out and i
[1:18:09] asked god said god
[1:18:11] i need you to speak to me and he only
[1:18:12] told me one thing he said preach
[1:18:17] what else can i do but preach amen
[1:18:20] amen and it will produce what god wants
[1:18:22] it to produce
[1:18:26] why is it budding this time of year what
[1:18:29] makes the seeds
[1:18:30] come out of the ground we think about
[1:18:32] that
[1:18:33] they come out just at the right time and
[1:18:36] and you know
[1:18:37] we have those 70 degree days in february
[1:18:40] and you're sitting there thinking well
[1:18:42] man everything's going to come out and
[1:18:43] then it's all going to be frost bit
[1:18:46] or we have a big snow like we did and
[1:18:47] it'll all be covered over
[1:18:49] but there's a reason why it comes out
[1:18:50] when it does
[1:18:53] and the reason is it waits because it's
[1:18:56] built into the seed to recognize
[1:18:59] temperature and time
[1:19:04] and and how much sunlight it gets right
[1:19:08] that's built into the seat god knows
[1:19:10] what he's doing
[1:19:12] very bad amen so temperature
[1:19:16] you know in our latitude temperature
[1:19:18] cycles between the coldest
[1:19:19] or the heat of summer not the coldest
[1:19:21] summer the cold of winter
[1:19:23] so temperature is a signal it can be a
[1:19:25] useful signal for plants
[1:19:27] but temperature fluctuates day by day so
[1:19:29] the plants wait through
[1:19:31] the temperature they wait through that
[1:19:35] because there's something in them that
[1:19:38] in order to survive
[1:19:39] they've got to know that this is not
[1:19:41] just a one-day thing
[1:19:43] this isn't just a campground experience
[1:19:46] right it's not just a one-time thing but
[1:19:47] it's got to have the right temperature
[1:19:49] for the right amount of time to thrive
[1:19:55] so it waits through that and then and so
[1:19:58] temperature by itself would not be a
[1:20:00] reliable signal but it's added to it
[1:20:02] something called photoperiod which is
[1:20:04] relative length of the day and night
[1:20:05] what plants do is actually
[1:20:07] measure the length of the darkness
[1:20:12] and when the darkness begins to be
[1:20:14] pressed together
[1:20:16] why is it so dark right before the
[1:20:18] coming of the daylight
[1:20:20] because the darkness the sun is pushing
[1:20:22] back the darkness
[1:20:23] it's a simple way to say it but the sun
[1:20:25] is pushing back the darkness
[1:20:27] amen it's so dark it'd be so pitch black
[1:20:30] but any amount of light will push
[1:20:32] it back amen and so
[1:20:35] that what it measures is the length of
[1:20:37] the darkness so when the days begin to
[1:20:39] grow longer and longer and the nights go
[1:20:41] shorter
[1:20:42] it's watching though it may seem ever so
[1:20:44] dark but the plant realizes
[1:20:46] it's time to bud pretty bad
[1:20:50] because whether they do daylight savings
[1:20:51] time or not the day's getting longer
[1:20:55] right amen what god said has got to come
[1:20:59] forth when the days
[1:21:01] reach the point and so the darkness
[1:21:04] it measures the darkness church if we
[1:21:07] can only recognize that today
[1:21:09] the hour that we live in what's going on
[1:21:11] in the world why is everything going
[1:21:12] crazy
[1:21:13] why does everything look so crazy you
[1:21:15] look out here and wonder
[1:21:16] why does the world look like even the
[1:21:18] church world's going insane
[1:21:20] why is everybody going and saying why is
[1:21:22] everybody crazy all of a sudden
[1:21:24] i heard of an actor in australia that's
[1:21:27] decided he wants to be called a tree
[1:21:29] not a he or a she or they or them or uh
[1:21:32] whatever
[1:21:33] are people but it caught a tree and it
[1:21:36] gets offended and it's a real thing it
[1:21:38] they thought he was joking he's not he
[1:21:39] gets offended when people don't call him
[1:21:41] tree
[1:21:42] and i feel sorry for him that's mixed up
[1:21:44] man
[1:21:46] huh it's not just a you know
[1:21:49] it's something that really wrong with a
[1:21:51] person that because you got to be
[1:21:53] something
[1:21:55] right you've got to be something and why
[1:21:58] wouldn't we want to be what god made us
[1:22:01] see and a prophet coming this agent told
[1:22:03] us god made you to be happy and free
[1:22:06] he didn't create you to be frowning all
[1:22:08] the time he didn't create
[1:22:10] you just to be under stress all of your
[1:22:11] life he created you to be free of
[1:22:13] anxiety
[1:22:14] he created you to be free of worry he
[1:22:16] created you to be to live like children
[1:22:18] before the father
[1:22:19] he created you that way amen
[1:22:23] hallelujah why would you want to be
[1:22:25] anything else
[1:22:26] but the darkness shows us amen
[1:22:30] there's something inside of the seed
[1:22:32] that measures the darkness
[1:22:33] and shows that it's at the right time of
[1:22:35] the year
[1:22:38] hallelujah for the plant to come forth
[1:22:41] now
[1:22:43] amen so the plant has to detect light
[1:22:47] and measure time and translate that
[1:22:50] information
[1:22:52] into growth commands right if you look
[1:22:55] at a c it's very similar to a
[1:22:57] to a dna technology it's very similar to
[1:23:00] computer code if you put it in you put
[1:23:03] one plus one equals two and i don't know
[1:23:05] how to code but
[1:23:06] it's something you push the right
[1:23:07] numbers and put them together in a
[1:23:08] string
[1:23:09] it produces something in a computer and
[1:23:11] you do the right things like that god
[1:23:13] coded it in such a way
[1:23:15] that it translates the information of
[1:23:17] light and time
[1:23:18] into growth commands listen to zechariah
[1:23:20] chapter 14 and verse 6.
[1:23:22] i'm going to try to hurry now as we go
[1:23:23] through so you just say with me
[1:23:25] zechariah 14
[1:23:26] 6 and it shall come to pass in that day
[1:23:28] that the light shall not be clear nor
[1:23:30] dark
[1:23:33] but it shall be one day which will be
[1:23:34] known to the lord not day or night
[1:23:38] how can you measure the time you see why
[1:23:40] so many people are mixed up
[1:23:42] how can you measure the temperature how
[1:23:44] can you measure the time how do you know
[1:23:45] what kind
[1:23:46] what time of year it is because when
[1:23:48] it's cloudy and 50 degrees outside
[1:23:50] it might be february it might be early
[1:23:52] in the morning in july
[1:23:56] right you don't know it might have been
[1:23:57] a storm pass over there's no way
[1:23:59] to measure it might be december you
[1:24:01] don't know what time of year it is
[1:24:04] it should be one day it's not day or
[1:24:06] night and the world doesn't know where
[1:24:07] it is
[1:24:08] but it shall come to pass in an evening
[1:24:10] time
[1:24:13] hallelujah that evening time it shall be
[1:24:16] light
[1:24:18] amen amen let that darkness so
[1:24:22] dissipate the light's coming on
[1:24:25] amen he said now he has promised to send
[1:24:28] you heavenly light
[1:24:29] to ripen the word seed that would be
[1:24:31] sown for this day
[1:24:33] he said the seed is in here
[1:24:36] that's what he said the seed is the
[1:24:38] bible
[1:24:40] amen but it couldn't come to life until
[1:24:43] the
[1:24:44] light of the hour hit it
[1:24:49] right and so you read your bible you're
[1:24:50] confused you don't know what time do i
[1:24:52] live in should i go build a boat
[1:24:55] right that's what god told noah
[1:24:59] do i need to start go back and start my
[1:25:01] watching my dietary restrictions and
[1:25:03] start watching whether i'm mixing
[1:25:04] certain clothes
[1:25:06] that's what god told moses
[1:25:09] right should i do i need to go back and
[1:25:12] at a certain time wear sandals and long
[1:25:14] hair and try to
[1:25:16] look in physical appearance like jesus
[1:25:17] now what hour do i live in
[1:25:20] what time is it see i agree all that is
[1:25:23] the seed of god it's the word of god but
[1:25:25] what season am i
[1:25:26] am i in
[1:25:30] amen that's the song said even the fool
[1:25:32] can see by the shape she's in this whole
[1:25:34] world's about to fall
[1:25:36] hey ben kenny infant song he said now
[1:25:40] he's promised to send you heavenly
[1:25:42] you he's promised to send you heavenly
[1:25:44] light to ripen the word seed that would
[1:25:46] be sown for this day
[1:25:47] the seed is in here the seed is the
[1:25:48] bible why jesus said so the word is the
[1:25:51] seed that the sower sowed
[1:25:53] you remember the parable of the sower
[1:25:55] you can go read that when you have time
[1:25:57] but now amen
[1:26:01] amen now he said now before you can have
[1:26:03] any crop no matter if you sow the seed
[1:26:05] it's got to have light to ripen that
[1:26:07] seed
[1:26:08] oral rot won't do no good it'll perish
[1:26:11] and so you sit and you wonder
[1:26:12] sometimes why does the word not work the
[1:26:14] way it should in my life
[1:26:15] i read the bible i read it i sit there
[1:26:18] and i go over and over and
[1:26:20] you got to have the light on the word
[1:26:24] you've got to be able to measure the
[1:26:25] time and the temperature
[1:26:28] you can only do that when the sun comes
[1:26:29] up
[1:26:31] in the evening light right now
[1:26:34] with the right kind of sunlight on it
[1:26:35] it's got to ripen he said and he
[1:26:37] promised in the last days in the evening
[1:26:39] time the sun would come out to ripen
[1:26:41] that seed it's the next quote i know i
[1:26:43] skipped some of it
[1:26:45] and he said the seed is being preached
[1:26:47] the son of god is ripening that seed now
[1:26:49] watch the seed is being preached
[1:26:52] and the son of god is ripening that seed
[1:26:55] by vindicating it
[1:26:58] amen there's got to be some vindication
[1:27:00] it can't be just dead later that's why
[1:27:02] paul even in his day
[1:27:03] he said i didn't come just with just
[1:27:05] with the letter only
[1:27:06] the letter killeth but the spirit gives
[1:27:08] life
[1:27:10] there's got to come some manifestation
[1:27:11] of the word
[1:27:13] right to bring light see the the son of
[1:27:15] god is ripening that seed by vindicating
[1:27:17] and making it push out before you
[1:27:18] proving it's right
[1:27:20] he said so you can recognize your day
[1:27:21] now brother branham
[1:27:24] preaches a sermon titled it is the
[1:27:27] rising of the sun
[1:27:29] it is the rising of the sun
[1:27:33] not it was or will be it is
[1:27:38] there is a man here who can turn on the
[1:27:41] light
[1:27:44] huh you notice
[1:27:47] it is it is the rising of the sun there
[1:27:49] is a man here
[1:27:50] who can turn on the light shalom arise
[1:27:52] shine your light has come
[1:27:58] amen now brother branham tells us
[1:28:01] that christ is the light and i'm reading
[1:28:02] the end of this quote and the light is
[1:28:04] the life and the word manifested
[1:28:07] is the light of the hour
[1:28:10] amen and again he says listen close we
[1:28:13] have seen the light
[1:28:14] his word that he promised for his day
[1:28:16] proven and vindicated it's the truth
[1:28:18] in the light of the hour he said oh my
[1:28:20] i'm so glad there is
[1:28:21] nothing wrong
[1:28:31] god knows what he's doing can we just
[1:28:33] rest in that
[1:28:37] he said well my baby got sick i don't
[1:28:38] understand god knows what he's doing god
[1:28:40] wants to heal your baby
[1:28:42] god wants to take care of you god but
[1:28:44] god knows what he's doing
[1:28:46] it's the truth he said we've seen the
[1:28:48] light his word that he promised for this
[1:28:50] day proven and vindicated it's the truth
[1:28:51] the light of the hour
[1:28:52] there is nothing wrong
[1:28:57] nothing wrong now you could couldn't
[1:28:59] have told jonah that when he was running
[1:29:00] from god
[1:29:02] a man running from the presence of the
[1:29:03] lord but in god's mind there was nothing
[1:29:06] wrong because he come out on the other
[1:29:10] side and a fish spit him out
[1:29:12] and the people said oh it's go it's our
[1:29:13] gods fish
[1:29:15] he come out of out of a big fish hooked
[1:29:17] out on dry land
[1:29:18] and god turned his stubbornness into a
[1:29:21] supernatural event
[1:29:28] hey bad think god don't know what he's
[1:29:30] doing
[1:29:32] brother branham in that sermon there's a
[1:29:34] man here who can turn on the light he
[1:29:36] tells a story about a minister who went
[1:29:38] and got his car fixed
[1:29:40] because the minister of course couldn't
[1:29:41] fix the car himself
[1:29:45] preachers aren't that handy i did hear a
[1:29:46] story about brother homer we talked
[1:29:47] about him this morning
[1:29:48] homer longoria and this is his face so
[1:29:51] brother homer if this is wrong if you
[1:29:52] listen to this god bless you i'm sorry
[1:29:55] but someone told me that brother homer
[1:29:56] was preaching one time at a certain
[1:29:58] place and he
[1:29:59] he uh something was wrong with his car
[1:30:01] all of a sudden he's back here studying
[1:30:03] in the office and he realizes what's
[1:30:04] wrong with it
[1:30:06] or what he thinks is wrong with it and
[1:30:07] so he runs outside
[1:30:09] to fix it and they start and they call
[1:30:11] him out call him out and call him out
[1:30:12] and he don't come and they walked
[1:30:13] outside and he got his sleeves rolled up
[1:30:15] he's working on his car
[1:30:16] because he just had that idea of what it
[1:30:18] was
[1:30:20] but see most of the time preachers
[1:30:21] aren't very good working on cars
[1:30:24] because you're usually only good at so
[1:30:25] many things right and
[1:30:27] there's a good life lesson to learn i
[1:30:29] got to get back to preaching here in a
[1:30:31] minute
[1:30:32] that's a good life lesson to learn
[1:30:33] you're only good at so many things and
[1:30:35] the things you are good at you probably
[1:30:36] need to do
[1:30:38] right and the things you're not good at
[1:30:40] you probably don't need to do
[1:30:43] amen brother joe isn't that right for
[1:30:46] you
[1:30:46] for me and brother joe that's right the
[1:30:48] things we're not we're good at certain
[1:30:49] things
[1:30:50] not the same things but
[1:30:53] now the little mechanic turned around
[1:30:55] now he went to
[1:30:56] get his uh car fixed let me tell the
[1:30:58] whole story
[1:30:59] went and got his car fixed and the
[1:31:01] mechanic can't figure out what's wrong
[1:31:02] with it
[1:31:03] he got no idea he's looking at he's
[1:31:05] saying this is it's one of these
[1:31:06] newfangled jobs
[1:31:07] got all the bells and whistles on he
[1:31:09] can't figure it out he's having a
[1:31:10] well-dressed man
[1:31:12] come into the mechanic shop that day he
[1:31:15] said can i tell you how to fix it
[1:31:17] he said well i i don't know what i'm
[1:31:19] doing so he he said let me do it so he
[1:31:21] walked over there and he moved this here
[1:31:23] and moved this over here and tightened
[1:31:24] this up here
[1:31:25] and it started and the little mechanic
[1:31:28] turned around and said say who are you
[1:31:31] he was the engineer he was general
[1:31:34] motors chief engineer
[1:31:36] that's the first problem it was general
[1:31:38] motors
[1:31:41] well that ain't doctrine
[1:31:44] but he said he made the thing are you
[1:31:47] with me today
[1:31:48] don't you feel just relaxed in the
[1:31:50] presence of god today
[1:31:52] he made the thing he was the one who
[1:31:54] designed it
[1:31:58] hallelujah and today when we're talking
[1:32:00] about methodist baptist presbyterian but
[1:32:03] the chief mechanic is here
[1:32:06] it was the same way in jesus day they
[1:32:07] had pharisees and sadducees in the
[1:32:09] scenes and all the different
[1:32:11] denominations and quotes that were out
[1:32:12] there everything was different but all
[1:32:14] at once
[1:32:15] the chief mechanic walked out and it
[1:32:18] took john
[1:32:18] who was not that light but he bare
[1:32:21] record of the light
[1:32:22] hallelujah it took john to shine a
[1:32:25] spotlight
[1:32:26] on the one who was coming and he didn't
[1:32:27] say behold my methodist behold my
[1:32:29] baptist behold my sadducee behold my
[1:32:31] pharisee
[1:32:32] what did he say behold the lamb of god
[1:32:35] who takes away the sins of the world
[1:32:37] listen he didn't say behold word of life
[1:32:39] tabernacle be all been pruitt behold
[1:32:41] something else he said behold the lamb
[1:32:43] of god who takes away the sin of the
[1:32:44] world
[1:32:44] the chief mechanic is here the designer
[1:32:47] of his word the man who created the
[1:32:48] heavens and earth and designed his
[1:32:50] church
[1:32:51] brother ben why do you do things like
[1:32:53] you do we try to stay just as close to
[1:32:55] the word as we can stay
[1:32:56] why do we do that because the designer
[1:32:58] said it a certain way
[1:32:59] we want to be that way
[1:33:02] hallelujah amen
[1:33:06] he said does he know more about what it
[1:33:08] takes for the rapture or does the
[1:33:09] methodist or baptist church know more
[1:33:11] about what it takes
[1:33:13] he is the designer he knows what it
[1:33:14] takes he is well dressed in the power of
[1:33:17] his resurrection
[1:33:19] very bad he looks like a chief engineer
[1:33:21] he's well dressed in the power of his
[1:33:23] resurrection hallelujah
[1:33:24] he's walking among us today in the power
[1:33:26] of his resurrection
[1:33:28] he is walking among us today we're not
[1:33:30] waiting on him we're not looking for
[1:33:31] light to come
[1:33:32] light has come
[1:33:37] he knows what it takes
[1:33:40] hallelujah to put a church in rapture
[1:33:43] order
[1:33:44] he designed it and put the parts
[1:33:46] together here in the bible
[1:33:49] amen he said just let the current flow
[1:33:51] through it now
[1:33:52] watch it operate let faith in his
[1:33:55] promised word of today flow through
[1:33:56] you'll see how it operates
[1:34:00] i gotta calm down you're gonna see a fat
[1:34:02] man shout
[1:34:05] he said why he designed the thing amen
[1:34:09] he designed his church by the word
[1:34:13] that's what he puts together not by
[1:34:14] methodist or baptist or presbyterian or
[1:34:16] pentecostal organization
[1:34:18] but by his word man shall not live by
[1:34:20] bread alone but by every word that
[1:34:22] proceeds from the mouth of god
[1:34:26] so he says get out of them glares in the
[1:34:27] midst of darkness this dark time that
[1:34:29] we're living in now
[1:34:30] in the midst of darkness who is going to
[1:34:33] bring the little bride out
[1:34:35] who knows about it the chief designer
[1:34:39] hallelujah light brings about
[1:34:43] an unstoppable resurrection
[1:34:49] brother david you spray them weeds spray
[1:34:52] that grass it just keeps coming keeps
[1:34:54] coming keeps coming why
[1:34:55] the earth is warmed up well i pray that
[1:34:58] god would do that for us here
[1:35:00] what are you doing brother man what are
[1:35:01] you doing week by week and week after
[1:35:02] week what are we doing
[1:35:03] letting the earth warm under the rays of
[1:35:05] the message of the hour
[1:35:06] and when it gets to a certain
[1:35:07] temperature all of a sudden seed begins
[1:35:09] to come up
[1:35:10] people begin to prosper people begin to
[1:35:12] come up and receive the blessings of god
[1:35:14] take advantage of the promises of god
[1:35:15] why because it's reached that point
[1:35:21] hallelujah you can't stop it you build a
[1:35:24] sidewalk across it'll come out
[1:35:25] underneath it
[1:35:26] it'll crack concrete you've seen it
[1:35:30] it'll come up every time why it's an
[1:35:33] unstoppable resurrection you can't stop
[1:35:36] the spring
[1:35:38] go ahead and try to do it it may be
[1:35:40] delayed for a while
[1:35:42] the groundhog may come out and say oh so
[1:35:44] many more weeks but he don't know
[1:35:48] he's famous for being wrong
[1:35:52] but once the spring comes you know it
[1:35:56] and you can't unsee the resurrection
[1:36:01] right that tree out here it's
[1:36:05] it's flowering it's blooming and you
[1:36:07] can't see that
[1:36:09] it's producing flowers it's producing
[1:36:12] them
[1:36:12] lovely white flowers that you just get
[1:36:14] up in the morning you drink it in
[1:36:17] oh it just feels so good drink in the
[1:36:19] pollen
[1:36:21] and you get sick
[1:36:26] you can't stop that resurrection
[1:36:31] by them trees they plant them everywhere
[1:36:32] and they just spread why you can't stop
[1:36:35] a resurrection
[1:36:38] and what hour are we living and we're
[1:36:39] living in the time when the seed is to
[1:36:41] be resurrected
[1:36:45] so what does the devil do now once that
[1:36:47] atmosphere is right that seed has to
[1:36:49] come out
[1:36:49] so the devil has only one thing you can
[1:36:51] do try to put a shadow over it
[1:36:53] we were down here at grand gulf state
[1:36:55] park here the other day
[1:36:57] and we're looking in the middle of
[1:36:58] winter and there's trees out there that
[1:37:00] grow
[1:37:00] up like this and like this and like this
[1:37:04] so straight up it's like a an elbow
[1:37:08] in a in a pipe under your under your
[1:37:10] sink
[1:37:11] think how in the world why'd it grow
[1:37:13] like that
[1:37:15] shade shadows
[1:37:18] sunlight all right it's going to reach
[1:37:21] for the sunlight
[1:37:24] amen hey man now watch
[1:37:27] the devil can't stop you so he tries to
[1:37:29] cast a shadow over you
[1:37:31] to affect your growth you don't think
[1:37:34] satan's trying so hard to do that that's
[1:37:36] why he wants to make people mess up
[1:37:38] in such a way that the world will know
[1:37:40] and say oh these people aren't
[1:37:41] christians
[1:37:43] trying to stop the growth but it is an
[1:37:46] unstoppable resurrection
[1:37:54] there's all these dead trees you go to a
[1:37:55] place where the trees men all burn off
[1:37:58] and here's these old tree trunks
[1:38:00] standing there now why did the fire have
[1:38:02] to come
[1:38:03] because the old trees were keeping the
[1:38:06] sun from reaching all the undergrowth
[1:38:08] from reaching the new new seeds that
[1:38:10] would come up and replace them
[1:38:12] right so seeds that were planted in
[1:38:13] another day in another light in another
[1:38:16] atmosphere
[1:38:17] we'll tend to block out new seeds
[1:38:21] right so those seed planted in a
[1:38:22] denominational light will grow up
[1:38:24] become great big and block out
[1:38:26] everything else
[1:38:27] but when a new day comes when the time
[1:38:29] comes god will send a wildfire through
[1:38:32] that'll burn it all up and when it does
[1:38:35] it'll just be a trunk an
[1:38:36] old old black trunk and what it does is
[1:38:38] it mourns
[1:38:40] brother brandon talked about that and it
[1:38:41] mourns in his sister and said
[1:38:44] tries to make it seem like just awful
[1:38:46] creepy kind of a place why because it's
[1:38:48] morning
[1:38:49] it is trying to keep anything cast a
[1:38:50] shadow all the shadow that it can cast
[1:38:52] but when the time comes and it's been
[1:38:54] burnt off here comes every little seed
[1:38:56] that's in the ground
[1:38:57] begin poking its way up and those little
[1:38:59] those little saplings that
[1:39:00] a prophet said could move in the wind
[1:39:02] amen those little saplings will begin to
[1:39:04] come up regardless why
[1:39:06] because he tried to throw a shadow over
[1:39:08] him but satan can't stop god
[1:39:11] what did they do to jesus they tried to
[1:39:12] throw a shadow over his ministry say he
[1:39:14] was illegitimately born
[1:39:16] say he wasn't really virgin born all
[1:39:17] these things don't you realize what
[1:39:19] science is still doing that today
[1:39:20] they're trying to tell you all evolution
[1:39:22] did this and and this is the way it was
[1:39:24] but god said in the beginning amen god
[1:39:27] created the heavens and the earth period
[1:39:30] hallelujah amen
[1:39:34] they try to cast a shadow over that
[1:39:37] brother brahmana said the pharisees i'm
[1:39:39] closing in just a moment
[1:39:40] just hang with me for a moment he said
[1:39:43] the pharisees and leaders of his they
[1:39:44] always tried to belittle him before the
[1:39:46] people
[1:39:47] it was just a way that the devil had of
[1:39:48] working all the pharisees and the
[1:39:50] teachers of his state constantly
[1:39:52] tried to belittle jesus all the
[1:39:54] throw-off that they could give to him
[1:39:55] they'd done it
[1:39:56] they watched him constantly to find
[1:39:59] where they could find a fault
[1:40:01] you realize where that spirit comes from
[1:40:03] if you identify yourself with a fault
[1:40:05] finder
[1:40:05] that's always trying to find fault do
[1:40:07] you know where that spirit come from
[1:40:08] it didn't come from god
[1:40:12] oh it's the devil constantly watching
[1:40:14] jesus watching the word to see if he
[1:40:15] could find a fault
[1:40:17] and they never spoke of his good things
[1:40:19] they were always finding something that
[1:40:20] they could belittle him about
[1:40:22] and say you see looky here if he was a
[1:40:24] man of god he wouldn't do it this way
[1:40:26] really satan will even let that spirit
[1:40:28] get down in your own relationship in
[1:40:29] your marriage and your church
[1:40:32] and it'll come down you begin to find
[1:40:33] fault with everything
[1:40:35] that don't come from god
[1:40:38] he never does he'll try to come down and
[1:40:41] and brother brown would say spray his
[1:40:44] poison
[1:40:45] malice spray his poison spray of malice
[1:40:48] anger hypocrisy huh
[1:40:52] find something they could belittle him
[1:40:53] about say you see look at here if he was
[1:40:56] a man of god he wouldn't do it this way
[1:40:57] if he was a man of god he wouldn't do it
[1:40:58] that way
[1:40:59] they were trying to cast a shadow upon
[1:41:00] him to get the people to disbelieve him
[1:41:03] that's the work of the devil i don't
[1:41:06] want to do the devil's work do you
[1:41:08] he he's good enough at it as he is let
[1:41:11] him do his own work i don't want to do
[1:41:13] it
[1:41:13] i don't want to do that in my marriage i
[1:41:15] don't want to do the devil's work
[1:41:17] god help me sometimes we get negative
[1:41:19] and i'm i'll be right there with you i
[1:41:21] know i've lived through that i know what
[1:41:22] that's like you get down you get
[1:41:24] negative
[1:41:24] and pretty soon you're doing the devil's
[1:41:26] work in your own marriage
[1:41:29] and you know there's nothing you want
[1:41:30] more than to keep the marriage alive
[1:41:32] and keep it going and you keep bringing
[1:41:33] up stuff that's doing the devil's work
[1:41:38] i'm sorry i that wasn't in my notes now
[1:41:43] that's the work of the devil but in all
[1:41:45] of that
[1:41:46] amen the ones that believed him
[1:41:51] we got somebody here that believes him
[1:41:53] this morning
[1:41:56] and loved him and had seen his
[1:41:58] scriptural miracle signs
[1:42:00] would not be hindered by them no sir
[1:42:03] them who believed him believed him
[1:42:05] those who loved him stood by him they
[1:42:08] would not
[1:42:08] see what others pointed out to them or
[1:42:10] if we could be that if we could just not
[1:42:12] see
[1:42:12] if somebody would come around here and
[1:42:13] say you know what they say you're
[1:42:15] pentecostal not by the denomination
[1:42:17] and see that's what people try to do say
[1:42:18] what are you they try to find out what
[1:42:20] what are you are you pentecostal or your
[1:42:21] baptist are you this that or the other
[1:42:23] no i'm what god said this is that which
[1:42:26] was spoken of in the scripture
[1:42:28] right but they try to say that so they
[1:42:30] can cast a shadow on you with shade on
[1:42:32] that seed
[1:42:33] not by denomination you hear them kind
[1:42:35] of baptized in jesus name yeah that's
[1:42:36] right
[1:42:37] well let me tell you something i know a
[1:42:38] man one time was baptized like that he
[1:42:40] did so and so
[1:42:41] but lookie that has nothing to do with
[1:42:43] it it's a devil trying to throw a shadow
[1:42:45] on you
[1:42:46] they're always trying to point you to
[1:42:47] some old ship that got wrecked upon the
[1:42:49] seashore
[1:42:50] watch those that work that do the work
[1:42:52] of the devil always trying to point you
[1:42:54] to some old ship that got wrecked upon
[1:42:55] the seashore
[1:42:56] but they're not pointing you to the one
[1:42:57] that made the voyage safely
[1:43:00] amen and somebody that's all their
[1:43:03] ministry is point to the wreck point to
[1:43:04] the wreck but let's point to the one who
[1:43:06] made the void safely
[1:43:08] always trying to throw a crowbait out
[1:43:10] there and i had to look that up
[1:43:12] i'll confess i didn't know what a
[1:43:13] probate was crowbait is an old horse or
[1:43:16] an old
[1:43:17] animal is just about to die
[1:43:21] they're always trying to throw a
[1:43:22] crowbait out there and say this is the
[1:43:24] example
[1:43:25] here here's what the message produces
[1:43:28] here's what the word of malachi 4
[1:43:29] produces here's what
[1:43:30] here's what a christian look at this old
[1:43:32] crowbar they tried to throw some
[1:43:33] some internet preacher some some
[1:43:35] preacher off of television somewhere
[1:43:37] well all they want is money here's what
[1:43:38] they produce some old crowbait
[1:43:41] hey man here's what did it this is the
[1:43:43] example i know if a certain preacher was
[1:43:45] a holiness preacher
[1:43:46] he did this out of the other but they
[1:43:48] don't point out others that wasn't
[1:43:49] holiness did that also
[1:43:53] they don't point listen and they don't
[1:43:54] point the great things that god did
[1:43:58] amen like somebody say oh here this man
[1:44:01] went too far
[1:44:02] he went too far he might have done that
[1:44:04] he wrecked himself up he went too far
[1:44:05] he'd become a fanatic he might have done
[1:44:07] that but while they're pointing out to
[1:44:09] how many that went
[1:44:10] one went too far how about these
[1:44:12] millions that never went far enough
[1:44:17] you fail to see that why those people
[1:44:18] over-emotional but how about the
[1:44:19] millions that never
[1:44:21] never even felt god
[1:44:25] so the people tried them pharisees and
[1:44:27] sadducees and hypocrites and herodians
[1:44:29] all tried to cast a shadow on jesus but
[1:44:32] them true believers it was predestinated
[1:44:33] to hear that message
[1:44:34] heard it and seen no fault in it
[1:44:38] at all hallelujah
[1:44:42] same now those who believe him love him
[1:44:45] those who believe him see no fault in
[1:44:46] him
[1:44:47] they don't see any heresy they don't see
[1:44:49] anything wrong they don't see
[1:44:50] anything wrong with his word they don't
[1:44:53] listen
[1:44:54] they don't see anything wrong with his
[1:44:56] people
[1:45:01] did i tell you i don't see anything
[1:45:02] wrong with you today
[1:45:04] does that mean there's nothing wrong
[1:45:05] with me brother ben i'm going straight
[1:45:06] to heaven
[1:45:07] bust the pearly gates wide open that's
[1:45:09] between you and god
[1:45:10] but i don't see anything wrong in you
[1:45:15] why because i believe you're produced by
[1:45:16] the word and what the word produces is
[1:45:19] good
[1:45:25] they don't see anything wrong with his
[1:45:27] people they just see jesus
[1:45:30] you see where the devil would like to
[1:45:31] point you to people and he'll point you
[1:45:33] to so many people that have done it
[1:45:34] wrong
[1:45:34] that you'll never come back to church
[1:45:36] again
[1:45:37] because it points you to this pastor
[1:45:39] that misled this man that fell
[1:45:41] this woman that did this this man that
[1:45:42] did this this business meeting that went
[1:45:44] wrong whatever it is
[1:45:46] this is what it is and here here's the
[1:45:48] crowbar but if they're predestinated
[1:45:50] eternal life
[1:45:50] they don't see anything wrong with this
[1:45:52] people they just take sides with jesus
[1:45:54] and stay there
[1:45:56] hallelujah amen musicians go ahead and
[1:45:59] come or i'll keep preaching
[1:46:01] first thessalonians 4 15 it says this be
[1:46:04] saying to you by the word of the lord
[1:46:05] that we which are alive and remain unto
[1:46:07] the coming of the lord shall not prevent
[1:46:08] them which are asleep
[1:46:10] for the lord himself shall descend from
[1:46:11] heaven with a shout with the voice of
[1:46:13] the archangel with the trump of god and
[1:46:14] the dead and christ shall rise first
[1:46:16] then we which are alive and remain shall
[1:46:17] be caught up together with them in the
[1:46:19] clouds
[1:46:19] to meet the lord in the air so shall we
[1:46:20] ever be with the lord that is the word
[1:46:22] right the same god what god said
[1:46:26] let every tree bring forth after his
[1:46:28] kind every seed bring forth out of his
[1:46:29] kind god said
[1:46:31] those who are which alive and remain
[1:46:33] unto the coming of the lord shall be
[1:46:34] caught up together with him in the
[1:46:35] clouds
[1:46:36] god said
[1:46:40] god said but that that's been in the
[1:46:43] scripture all this time
[1:46:45] but it takes the transforming light of
[1:46:47] this hour
[1:46:48] oh god i hope you see it today it takes
[1:46:51] the power of god the transforming power
[1:46:53] of god
[1:46:54] has taken us from the chaos of science
[1:46:56] and education the things of the world
[1:46:58] the understanding of this modern day has
[1:47:00] transformed us now into sons and
[1:47:02] daughters of god
[1:47:03] and even death itself can never hold us
[1:47:05] in the grave
[1:47:07] ain't no grave can ever hold my body
[1:47:09] down even death itself can never hold us
[1:47:11] in the grave we'll be changed in a
[1:47:13] moment
[1:47:13] in a twinkling of an eye is it all you
[1:47:15] mean to say i mean to say that's the
[1:47:17] truth
[1:47:18] jesus that word stood on the earth which
[1:47:20] was the word the one that raised up and
[1:47:21] raised lazarus he said i am the
[1:47:23] resurrection of the life
[1:47:24] he that believeth in me though he were
[1:47:25] dead yet shall he live and whosoever
[1:47:27] liveth and believeth in me shall never
[1:47:28] die
[1:47:29] there is no way to stop the living word
[1:47:32] of god
[1:47:33] it's got to rise again are you hearing
[1:47:36] me this morning
[1:47:38] sorry i don't mean to scream at you but
[1:47:39] i'm just telling you what i feel this
[1:47:41] morning
[1:47:42] it's got to rise again you see the
[1:47:44] springtime coming up it's an unstoppable
[1:47:46] resurrection
[1:47:47] when christ went into the ground it was
[1:47:48] an unstoppable resurrection
[1:47:50] because the word said i'll not suffer my
[1:47:52] holy one to see corruption
[1:47:54] i'll not leave his soul in hell so it
[1:47:56] was unstoppable because the word of god
[1:47:57] said so
[1:47:58] that same word said if you go on the
[1:48:01] ground
[1:48:02] you're a believer you've been
[1:48:04] manifesting the light of the hour
[1:48:05] you'll come up
[1:48:09] not only will you come up but you're
[1:48:10] already risen it is the rising of the
[1:48:12] sun
[1:48:14] you risen from dead creeds denominations
[1:48:16] to the word of god
[1:48:18] from out of this chaos of modern
[1:48:20] scientific eden we're living in a
[1:48:22] culture science and education all this
[1:48:23] modern stuff will rise
[1:48:25] the roboflesh will drop and rise and
[1:48:26] seize the everlasting prize
[1:48:29] we'll go through the air and this will
[1:48:30] all be over for the word of god that's
[1:48:32] brought us from the modern thinking of
[1:48:34] our mind transforming our mind into the
[1:48:35] renewing of our hearts towards god
[1:48:37] and our spirits that same spirit that
[1:48:39] spoke that has transformed us this far
[1:48:43] and it will also take us into his
[1:48:45] presence
[1:48:46] into his glory with a glorified body
[1:48:49] would you bow your heads with me this
[1:48:51] morning
[1:48:55] it's an unstoppable resurrection
[1:48:59] oh what hope that gives to minister the
[1:49:01] gospel
[1:49:02] you stand here and i
[1:49:05] heard that charles spurgeon told his
[1:49:09] a young preacher he said young preacher
[1:49:10] come to scourge he said i don't ever see
[1:49:12] anybody baptized no one ever gets saved
[1:49:14] he said well how many do you expect to
[1:49:15] get saved
[1:49:17] he said that's it
[1:49:19] [Music]
[1:49:20] you have to believe that god will do
[1:49:22] what he said he will do
[1:49:24] i believe he'll do that today maybe this
[1:49:26] is your time and your moment
[1:49:28] you'd like to just slip up a hand you
[1:49:29] say there's no power in that
[1:49:31] the word of god said that there is you
[1:49:34] define gravity by raising your hand
[1:49:37] in fact the word says that while the
[1:49:40] word was preached
[1:49:41] in the book of acts they received the
[1:49:43] holy ghost the holy ghost fell on the
[1:49:44] audience
[1:49:46] i believe it could be that way today you
[1:49:47] don't have to wait even to be baptized
[1:49:48] to receive the holy ghost
[1:49:50] you receive it right now he said brother
[1:49:51] ben what will i do well the word the
[1:49:53] holy spirit the spirit comes without
[1:49:55] sensation
[1:49:57] so it don't create a sensation but
[1:49:59] there's something about it when you
[1:50:00] receive it
[1:50:01] i believe it'll do something for your
[1:50:03] life it'll change you
[1:50:05] whether you shout jump run haul or
[1:50:07] scream you might do all that because
[1:50:08] that's the effects of its presence
[1:50:11] but it'll change you from what you are
[1:50:13] would you just slip up your
[1:50:14] up your hands say brother ben i i need
[1:50:16] that work that word to work that way in
[1:50:18] my life
[1:50:19] i want it to work according to the bible
[1:50:21] i want to be a bible christian god bless
[1:50:23] you this morning
[1:50:25] god bless those hands i want to be a
[1:50:27] bible christian
[1:50:29] pray with you now heavenly father
[1:50:33] we believe lord that you have some bible
[1:50:36] christians today
[1:50:38] is it so simple that we could become
[1:50:40] more like you just by acknowledging our
[1:50:42] need of you i believe it is
[1:50:45] i pray heavenly father that you would
[1:50:46] just move over this congregation maybe
[1:50:48] there's
[1:50:50] troubled minds today unsettled not sure
[1:50:53] i pray god that you'd move over their
[1:50:55] hearts and their lives today and
[1:50:57] just help them to soak in the word of
[1:50:59] god
[1:51:01] lord to be like the bereans that were
[1:51:04] more noble than
[1:51:06] the others because they went and
[1:51:07] searched the scriptures to see if the
[1:51:08] things that paul
[1:51:10] said were true i pray it would be so in
[1:51:12] every one of our hearts
[1:51:14] for each one that raised their hand lord
[1:51:15] i pray that there would be an
[1:51:16] unstoppable resurrection
[1:51:19] it would be a real bible christian that
[1:51:20] wouldn't let anything affect them no
[1:51:22] shade
[1:51:23] no shadow for of old dead trees keeping
