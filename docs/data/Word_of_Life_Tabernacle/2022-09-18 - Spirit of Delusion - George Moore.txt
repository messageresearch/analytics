threw his love could take his [Music] amen well god bless you all and uh certainly happy to be in the house of the lord uh with you all tonight and so uh i told uh brother ben was talking about he preaches long when i'm here and the last time i was here i i gave him a hard time about it i went back and looked though i only preached like 10 minutes less than he did so uh so i'm going to try to make that up to you tonight and uh uh keep it keep it uh short uh how many of you enjoyed that message we heard this morning amen my goodness it was a it was a blessing to hear and and uh certainly appreciate that let's turn in our bibles if we could to revelations the third chapter while we're all standing very familiar scripture here tonight and we'll read out of revelations and we'll read out a second thessalonians revelations the third chapter 14th verse and to the angel of the church of laodicea and write these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god i know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot i would that thou work hold or hot so the lord's saying here i wish you'd be one way or the other is that right either serve me or don't but don't try to straddle the fence is that right and he said so then because thou art lukewarm neither cold nor hot i will spew thee out of my mouth because thou sayest i'm rich and increased with goods uh and have need of nothing and that's the world we live in today brothers and sisters that the the poorest american is rich compared to the rest of the world and and so we live in a day where people feel that they they don't need they don't need the lord they they got it on their own is that right and so noah's thou that our wretched measure excuse me need of nothing and know us not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked i counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in fire that thou mayest be rich and white raiment that thou mayest be clothed and the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with i said that thou mayest see as many as i love i rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent amen and over in uh ii thessalonians the second chapter 2 thessalonians the second chapter and the 11th verse and for this calls god shall send them strong delusion everybody say delusion that they should believe a lie that they all might be damned who believe not the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness amen and may the lord add his blessings to the rings word let's just bow our heads father we thank you tonight for the reading of your precious word we thank you for these brothers and sisters of like precious faith we thank you lord for this church and what it stands for father i just pray tonight lord that you would lord bless your people lord we are finite in ourselves lord i'm just a man but you have a way of moving man out of the way and using your gifts and i pray o god tonight that you would lord just move me out of the way speak through me i ask oh god i pray that you'd bind my lips before i'd speak anything unpleasing to you and committed into your hands in the name of the lord jesus christ amen and amen god bless you you can be seated and while you're seated there we'll turn in ii timothy just for one more little portion of scripture and to look at i uh i appreciate uh the opportunity to come tonight uh i want to greet you uh from brother joseph hammond and the church at believer's tabernacle in murfreesboro uh he he wanted me to make sure that i uh greeted you and your pastor he sure thanks a lot brother ben and and uh i told him i would do that and so i have fulfilled my obligation uh i uh i i'm glad to have the honor to come and and this morning i i had i wanted to preach something else i'll just be honest with you and uh i had something else that i was wanting to try to come and bring tonight uh and you know as a minister you can't preach what you want to preach and uh you just gotta you gotta go the way that you can try and try and try you can't get anywhere if it's not what the lord wants you to do and so uh the the lord changed my uh heart on what i was wanting to preach on tonight and then this morning when brother ben got started i thought he's i'm going to have to change it again because he's going to preach all of what i was going to preach on tonight so but as it worked out i think this will go right along with what brother being preached this morning which certainly was a help to me i told him i said it's a little uncomfortable for me brother ben um at one point there when he got talking about your sweetheart and stuff i was just i just found myself just looking down straight at the floor like this and i didn't want to look i didn't want to look to my right because i felt like my wife would be piercing a hole in me and uh so a little uncomfortable you know but certainly enjoyed that message this morning and uh it's certainly needful i i have always felt like um that it it's our duty to to have a home brother brown said that your children want to come to and make it comfortable and make it nice for them and i i just appreciate that message so much and so uh i i want to title this tonight to spirit of delusion spirit of delusion and in second timothy the third chapter just a little bit further and i think uh brother ben was in the second chapter this morning thessalon uh timothy or thessalonians this know also that in the last days how many of you believe we're in the last days amen perilous times will come so the bible tells us in the last days it's going to get bad isn't it for men shall be lovers of their own selves and we live in the age of narcissism brothers and sisters we live in an age where people are self-consumed they're consumed with their own self they like taking selfies like it's a selfie mad world we want to take a picture of ourself right and and if you if you don't believe me just like hang a mirror up on the wall all right and watch how many people got to stop and look at themself in it right so it's the age of lovers of their own selves covetous meaning they they not only love their own self but they love what other people got too and they and they want what other people got and we're constantly comparing ourselves to other people and boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents and and saints it sickens me the way i hear children allowed to talk to their parents today it's it's it's it's a sickening thing and keep in mind brother ben preached on this morning that's not the child's fault that's the parent's fault but but i could never imagine talking to my parents the way i hear children talking to their parents today amen even in the message disobedient to parents unthankful we live in an unthankful uh nation where everybody's entitled everybody feels like they are owed something and it's just an unthankful unholy without natural affection meaning uh it's not brother ramsey it's just a natural affection not not like godly love not like that but like the natural affection that a mother should have for her child it's not there anymore that's why a woman can have a baby and throw it in a trash can it's the natural affection is gone amongst the people can you say amen and so it's uh natural affection um uh truce breakers false accusers now this is this false accusers is a interesting one because you know brother brown said you don't have to kill a man is that right you can kill his influence but amen by saying something about him it's not true and i've seen so many instances of that as i go church to church and i i go around all over the place now and you know you hear stuff and people say stuff about this church or that church and you know what i i've learned this i you really can't depend on anything but what you see for yourself because a lot of times when you hear stuff about churches here and there and you go and you find that's just not true or or maybe it was true but it ain't true no more because you know what by the grace of god we can change amen we can get better amen i don't want anybody to judge me for what i was 25 years ago amen despisers uh false accusers incontinent and the word incontinent means having no control over your own passions you can't control your own passions just whatever you want to do that goes you know just whatever and uh uh fierce despisers of those that are good saints make no mistake you are hated by this world you're hated by this world the the world hates what you stand for and the world hates your testimony is that right amen and traitors heavy high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of god having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away the bible said don't not entertain it turn away from it amen for this is the sword they are they which creep into houses lead captive silly women laden with sin led away with diverse lust ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth now if you'll skip on down a little bit that 14th verse says this though this is for you it says but continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and has been assured of knowing of whom thou hast learned them so the bible says while all this is going on in the world and while all these things are taking place in the world you just continue right on believing the message of the hour you just continue right on believing this gospel that we have today and know without a doubt that this gospel didn't come from man but it came from god can you say amen to that tonight just continue on knowing it's going to be all right saints continue on knowing everything's in god's hands and so i come across this thought because i i got to thinking about the other day that uh you realize saints that are children and i have a real love for the young people i i can't imagine what it's like to be a young person in this day and time it's so much more uh temptation and so much more access to the devil than it was when i was a child but i have a real feeling for our young people and i got to thinking about our young people and do you realize saints that our young people have never known a world that hadn't been totally insane if they're 25 year old or less all they've known has been this nuts of a world that we live in today amen it's never been a time i i remember i was in 1999 i gave uh my heart to the lord now i came it was probably february early march that uh the lord got to dealing with us and we we went to church now my my first church was walking into a two-car garage that was playing tapes and that was the only church that we had now i've never been to church a day in my life i i've never been to a baptist church i've never been to a methodist church the only church i've ever been to was walking into that garage and hearing a tape of the prophet now saints that should have appeared odd to me but i didn't know no better i didn't know what ever church didn't do i thought maybe every church did that i don't know i didn't know they probably you know most of them were in a garage but that was where i got my first experience with the lord was hearing the message of the hour and a couple weeks later i felt the need to be baptized and and you know it's something about a believer saints it's something about a christian whenever you hear the voice of god you want to line up with it hey something about a believer when you hear god's word it's in you to line up with it and so i just wanted to be baptized in christian baptism but we didn't have no baptistery because it was a two-car garage and and so we uh went to the lake in the middle of in the middle of march and it was snowing and it was ice on the lake and and the brothers busted up the ice and and i i i was just dumb enough to go down there and get baptized in that cold icy grave amen [Music] when you when the lord gets to deal with these things you just might as well do it amen so so i was baptized in this icy water and that was in march of 99 and when i come up out of the water by the grace of god my wife come right in behind me and she was baptized at the same time and brothers if you've got a wife that loves the lord you're blessed tonight [Music] yes sir you're blessed and so we we come up out of the water we went and got into uh the van and was being carried back home and uh my wife's grandfather was driving and he was a he was a gracious old saint of god that had lived a message for 50 years and had the gift of wisdom and he told me he said brother george he said now look the the devil's going to be after you now and he said he's going to be after you because he had you but he ain't got you no more and he's going to be mad about it and saints i'll tell you he's been mad about it ever since he's been mad about it ever since he's done everything he can to take everything he can away from me amen is that your testimony tonight have you been fighting the devil ever since he ever since god got a hold of you you've been fighting the devil ever since yes amen it's a battle it's a battle but you know saints the devil can't do one thing to you until god allows him to do it so we got to bless him in the good times we bless the lord in the bad times we bless him in the in the high times we bless them in the low places we bless the lord because it's all ordered of him amen we praise him when it's going good we praise him when it's going bad we praise the lord amen and so that was in march of 99 and and and then right shortly thereafter some of you young people won't know what i'm talking about here but right shortly thereafter came y2k y'all remember y2k y2k was going to be the end of us all brother ben it was for those of you that don't remember y2k that was when we was in 1999 and and the calendar was going to go turn over to 2000. and and the thing was they said the computers of that day wouldn't be able to turn over to 2000. so the word on the street was that the missiles all the nuclear missiles was going to blow up all the electrical uh electric grids was going to go offline we going to have no power and we was going out into chaos and so that was in 99 going into 2000 and so i had to give my heart to the lord in march and i said well praise god he saved me just in time amen oh i came to the lord just in time i want to make it amen amen you know what if the lord ain't gonna come till the last one makes it in is that right amen so i said well praise god he saved me just in time and so so 19 and 99 uh going into 2000 we had a watch night service y'all know what a watch tonight services so so it was new year's eve and we had a watch night service and since there was people that showed up to church we got a church building in the meantime i forgot to tell you that we got a real church building not a two-car garage and i i started preaching about that time so i've been in a message about six months started preaching and so uh uh so we was having a watch night service and people showed up to church that night that i'd never seen in church before because they was sure that the end was coming everybody knew the end was coming you know they stayed in church until 1201 that night and they got up and left and i ain't never seen them since amen y2k but from that time on brothers and sisters it has been one battle of chaos right after another and our young people have been coming into this world uh into this they don't know what normal is they have no idea what normal is because it's always been upside down and these birth pains keep getting closer and closer together and we went right out of y2k into 911 and 911 changed everything not everybody in here probably remembers where you were at when you first heard about the towers is that right and you know people started calling me sinners started calling me they knew that it was the end a lot of people got real religious real fast brother ben they got real religious they realized they wasn't ready and they thought the end was coming now when the next day come around and we were still here they went right on back to there and it's been war after war it's been war after war you know right after 9 11 we got into we got into a desert storm and then right over that afghanistan and then you know now all the stuff happening in the in russia taken into the ukraine and i was surprised by how many people in the message got pretty upset when russia moved into the ukraine and and a lot of quotes started flying around a lot a lot of people started flying quotes around here and there but brothers and sisters you don't have to worry about all this amen you believe the message of the hour the believe the message of the hour will get us home amen and so we find it the war after war and into you know here recently or over the past few years you've seen racial tensions and social tensions and political tensions and and you've seen war and you know people get all upset about politics and tell everything that biden's doing or whatever i do kind of miss trump brother ben he he was a barrel of monkeys i i i it was always good for a laugh but anyways then the coved happened and when coved hit that first little bit when covet hit if you will remember everybody lost their whole mind they lost their whole mind and some said it was going to kill us all and then some said that it wasn't even real they said it was all made up coveted wasn't even real but it felt real when i had it seemed pretty real when i had it amen and some said some said that the bride wasn't gonna get it if his bride you weren't gonna get it now they said that right up until they got it and then they had to change their doctrine amen but they said the bride wasn't going to get it and it was easy to say that long as it wasn't in your neighborhood or it wasn't in your town it wasn't in your church amen but when it comes close to you then you know you lose some of your ability to boast and and people lost a lot of their mind when kova had happened saints but i i want you to notice this covey do you realize how much rights and freedom we lost the weak coved moved into the united states do you realize that that was just a trial run of the devil to see how much rights the american people were going to relinquish willingly by propaganda is that right [Music] see it was all just misinformation people get on facebook and see something somebody posted and and and it run like wildfire you know and and people were just repeating other people's ignorance you know some said the mask were the answer some said the mask would kill you some said the vaccinations were the answer some said the vaccinations will kill you and everybody was trying to get on one side of it or the other amen and we lost a lot of rights we let the government come in and they dictated in one week's time they they dictated where we could eat they dictated where we could work they dictated if we could leave the country or not amen they even dictated whether you could operate your business or not they dictated whether whether it was whether your business was essential or not is that right just a just a little trial run of the devil amen my dad was dying in the hospital at the time and i couldn't get in to see him now a lot of people had people like that he was dying in the hospital and couldn't get in to see him because of everything going on and uh we find this saints brother brown says this it's a pressure it's a pressure that's on the world today and everywhere you go you feel this pressure if you go to walmart you feel the pressure if you go to work you feel the pressure to brother ben's point this morning in your homes there's a pressure there's a pressure on the land today and it's going to reach a breaking point brother braham says this he says the world is just built upon pressure it's going to blow up one of these days the world built full of pressure and the doctors don't even know what to do about it the psychiatrist has got psychiatrists doctoring them that's right they don't have the answer but god does but god does god has the answer to all of this he said amen so what's the answer tonight you know the world is built upon pressure everything is going at a breakneck speed and they don't know where they're going they go down the road 90 miles an hour to stop in a tavern and drink two hours let me stop right here and say this uh i i got this car and it's got a speed uh limit bail on it that if if you set it it'll ding every time you get above that's a speed warning and uh so i had it set at 80. and i found out quick that's going to worry me to death at 80. so i said well i'm going to move it to 90. that way i won't have to worry about it and uh you can ask sister brandy how many times that thing goes off uh so i got it turned clean off now because it just drive too fast and uh i'm working on y'all pray for me the closer i get to the house the faster my car goes 90 miles an hour he said to stop in a tabern and drink two hours before they get home it just seems to be such a pressure everybody irritable pushing and shoving and i just wonder what the cure is again he says man is trying to find something to satisfy and he thirsts and god made him to thirst that that he was built up that way but god built him that way so he'd thirst after him but he tries to satisfy it and hush that holy call in him with the things of the world and we have no right to do that now but people do wrong constantly instead of going to the place to get rid of the cause we try to hush it with anesthetics anesthesia and liquor and smoking and putting more to it heaping it up all the time making it worse and all this only builds up pressure it just makes it worse all the time so all the doctrine and everything they're trying to do all it's doing is making it worse amen the more prescriptions they give out the worse it's going to get the the more things we try to do to artificially fix the cause the worse it's going to get but he said the only answer is jesus christ amen and brother branham says that you're not in your right mind without the baptism of the holy ghost amen the answer is the holy ghost amen and we live in a world of delusion a a place of delusion a a country of delusion we live in a world brothers and sisters that feels like you can choose whether you're male or female or not whether you're male or female say it's this it's biology it's not psychology amen you're either male or female right you're either one or the other is that right it's not psychology it's not in your mind it's it's biology it's anatomy is that right and so you know we live in a world that thinks you can decide those kind of things and then look i'm not talking about the people this ain't people this is spirits i'm not looking down on anybody i i mean we deal with people all the time that that have got they got a lot going on they got a lot going on it's the spirit on the people amen but you know the god is concerned about those people and he's concerned with their soul and so if he's concerned with their soul then it's our place to be concerned with their soul as well amen not to look down on them not to treat them treat them poorly or or call them names or anything like that but to try to do something to help amen so i'm not talking about people it's a spirit that we're fighting against but we should we should never be confused about whether we're male or female amen amen how many of you lived on a farm grew up on a farm how many of you've ever had puppies kittens right y'all know how to tell if a puppy is a male or a female is that right you just check it's one or the other amen you don't give them a psychiatric evaluation they're right it's biology it's not psychology now is this right or wrong saints and so now the new level of that's come in on that is called non-binary and and if you don't know about non-binaries where now they can't decide if they're male or female so they say they're both and and they don't want to be called him or her they won't be called they or them well look you don't get to choose your own pronouns saints amen the english language dictates the pronoun if it's one it's a him or her if it's two it's that they are them right but but they want to be called they are them why because they say one day they get up and they decide that they are a man but the next day they may get up and decide that they are a woman you understand saints this is this is strong delusion on the people strong delusion prophesied to come prophesied to come to pass and that's the day and the time that we're living in strong delusion on the people there's a strong delusion that would cause somebody to not be able to decide if they're a man or woman or not it's pretty easy amen that's not a big hard decision and so we we find then that this is not uh you know you got children that that even in it back home and it's probably over here too but back back home but close to nashville we've got schools that are dealing with children that have not they've decided that they're no longer a boy or a girl but they're a dog or a cat or or an elf or something like that and if they decide their dog they're going into the school and they bark at everybody and use the bathroom in the floor now this is not juvenile delinquency this is parent delinquency if you have a 10 year old boy if i was a 10 year old boy i'd like to seen the conversation that i'd had to have with my dad to convince him that i was a dog amen this is parents saying well okay sweetheart right that's not the kind of home that kids need to go back home to amen real love is corrective we know that amen if you love them you correct them is that right amen and you know the the thing is as people that we have the right to decide what we are and and all those things and i i guess if you wanted to do that that's fine but you can't ask me to go along with your lie for you amen if brother joel decides today that he's a monkey i'll still love him amen but i'm not feeding him bananas i'm not going along with that lie amen if brother i'm plainly going to call him a him i'm not going to call him a her because he's not a her i'm not going along with the lies saints amen but this spirit of strong delusion in the nation would try to make you think that the right thing to do is call somebody whatever they want to be called amen but right is right amen truth is truth amen and there ain't no truth left today but in this message amen and the bible said they believe a lie and be damned by it and he said it it's a reprobate now that word reprobate means corrupt it's corrupt minds concerning the truth and we also have to be uh wise to the fact that our brains our brains are gone not our mind not not our mind our mind the people's minds are gone that's true but not just their mind but their literal brain is gone y'all want to hear that brother brown says this the whole human race is rotten well if them physical beings of our body is tearing down like that from eating hybrid foods tensions that rot it does not that also rot the brain cell amen the brain cell that we that we can see how women can get on the street naked we can see how they can speed through the streets at 120 miles an hour now look i hadn't done that bad i ain't done that bad but i did make that 90 dinger go off a few times uh 120 miles an hour all these things it comes to a place to where the whole nation the whole world not only this nation but everywhere mentally gone why because of marines and saints that includes message believers message believers are also eating hybrid foods message believers bodies are also breaking down and if the bodies are breaking down if our bodies are turned into mush our brains are as well things i'll tell you you can't trust your own brain amen visible union of the bride brother brown says the whole world proves it's insane look at the murders and things that's going on now see insane in the world see insanity the whole thing is coming to fulfill revelations we may get to it this week where those hideous things them is not natural them spiritual things that makes people scream for the rocks and the mountains and everything else to fall on them the complete total insanity this world will go into right away it's almost there now why you see the footsteps of it there it is it's marching right out on the street right down the church pew it's marching right down the street right down to the church pew is that what he said total insanity do things that a human being wouldn't think of doing and be civilized look what hollywood has done to the women to the woman look how it is it's robbed the sacred virtues of the woman and on and on we could go so brother abraham said this the world is rolling out into insanity it's supposed to according to revelations he says and he says that it's it's coming it's going to get worse amen there's more to come it's going to keep getting worse and he says that we're marching right out of the street right down to the church pew so it's in the churches as well amen and he says look what hollywood has done to the woman and so i i want you to notice where all this delusion comes from now brother branham says that eighty percent of it come from hollywood did y'all know that bill graham said 80 of this delusion comes from hollywood all right and he says then uh he said notice he couldn't get in here through the ministry satan he's talking about satan couldn't get in here through the ministry so the thing he done was come into hollywood out there and he set up holly he set up his headquarters over in hollywood the devil landed back there a few years ago 15 or 20 years ago with his great army and went hit in hollywood california and he has invaded the united states with his demon powers right all of our fashions come from paris they get it in hollywood onto the screens these little girls and boys and things get out there and they watch them screenplays so brother brahms said satan came in and set up his headquarters in hollywood and he from there invaded the united states with his demon powers is that what he said he said eighty percent of it now look you might differ with that say oh he was just doing it for effect i'm just going to try to believe what he's saying and if he said it's 80 i believe it's 80. and so we understand then that hollywood controls now the trends of this world hollywood controls the fashions of this world if holly the more hollywood takes off the more the women take off amen the more hollywood men dress like women the more worldly men dress like women amen whatever the trend is in hollywood that's the trend in the world today amen they set the popular culture of the world so they they set the morals of the world or the lack thereof and hollywood has gone about methodically desensitizing the world to sin amen it's it starts out real easy just like with the music brother brown started out with rolling girl rolling girl is rolling is that right and then it moves on into this other worldly music that we have today it starts out real easy and it gets progressively worse over time and hollywood started out really easy and it's gotten progressively more and more sinful over time and it's desensitized the world to sin amen no matter what they see in front of them they see something worse on hollywood screen somewhere is that right and so even in the message even in the message there used to be a time where something would come on and something be said and people turn it off oh and they apologize to the family i'm sorry i didn't know that was in there like that and then as we go along we just keep on letting it go letting it go and then we just let it play all right desensitized to it what's the most popular baby names every year if you look up the most popular baby names every year in the united states you'll find that it's the most popular movie stars of that year they name their children after them amen brother braham says you get under the blood of jesus christ it's a disgrace how that all such things as we have in our world is in the condition today 80 percent of it come right out of hollywood and yet that's the example of the world that's where the pace is set for the modern world is out of hollywood he said is that right amen now before we get too far out on a limb here i don't think i sent this to you brothers but before we get too far out on a limb here brother branham said that everything that come out of hollywood wasn't bad yeah that's right that's going to make some people mad but that's what he said he said everything come out of hollywood well man i'm going to read it to you here he said now i don't say everything in hollywood is polluted i had some men at my house here not long ago uh the westminster film company who made come up here and made a picture ask uh me permit if they could do it and come to the meetings and they put it on the screen called the 20th century prophet you know the 20th century prophet come out of hollywood i didn't tell i read this and he says and they're going into palestine to set up a meeting over there and those fellows that i met in is a group that made this picture samson and delilah and so forth and they were uh and they were every one first thing they did when they walked in before they asked me a question they said can we kneel and have prayer a group of gentlemen he said so brothers and sisters it matters how we use things it matters what we use things for is that right that's why gun control is never going to work amen because the gun ain't what's killing everybody amen it's the person pulling the trigger that's killing everybody is that right and you know it's like you the the brother brown said this he said he he he moved on in there and he uh he he used to be wrong he said for people to go to the picture show he said but he he got one step ahead of you and he put it right in your home and you know in this day and time he he's gotten another step ahead he's put it right in your hand is that right put it right in your hand but it matters what you use it you got that phone in your hand brothers and sisters the same phone that i can use to read my bible on is the same phone that i can look at phil phone amen the same phone that i can call somebody to pray for them is the same phone that i can call somebody to gossip about amen the same phone that i can listen to the message on is the same one that i can listen to worldly music on amen so it matters how you use something amen so you know there's a big debate about tvs and stuff you know i know a lot of message believers that's got tvs where the buttons wore off of them where they roll them in and out of the closet when company's coming over got a million miles on that tv now i don't care if you got one or you don't but you got to trust the holy ghost tell you how to use it hey so there's a lot of people in the message now today we ain't got tvs but we got a laptop we got a phone we don't watch a tv when you watch it on the laptop see that's legalism saints amen that's that's that's legalism if it's right to watch or or if it's if it's wrong to watch it on tv it's wrong to watch your laptop amen it's legalism amen amen i mean saints that's a tv right there hey man this tv right there how do we use it this all right tonight wear the buttons off of it roll it in the closet when company's coming over the other thing hollywood controls is social media oh yeah see see whatever the whatever the hollywood elite do on social media that's what everybody else does so so if you let one of them knuckleheads eat a tide pod then the whole nation is going to start eating tide pods amen or whatever the next challenge is on social media saints don't ever let a challenge influence you when when you obey a challenge then that lets the person that issued the challenge have dominion over you amen in order for me to accept the challenge i'd have to care what you thought amen and i don't care what the world thinks amen uh you can challenge me all day long it'll make me no difference amen because i don't care what the world thinks now is that right so hollywood controls social media but hollywood is not real neither is social media social media is not real life it's not real life first off those people don't look like that they don't look like that if you saw them in real life you'd say oh god they look terrible but if you put them in the right light and you put the right makeup on them and you put the right filters on them then they look all right but that's not a realistic expectation amen it's like reading a love story that ain't real life amen everybody looks at all these romantical movies and stuff things that ain't what it's going to be like amen so if you get your head built up around that when you finally do get married come on you're going to be in for a disappointment amen come on preach amen but that's not what marriage is about amen and and so hollywood's not real neither is social media nobody posts their real life on social media no nobody when they post those selfies they selective about the selfie they post amen they don't post the one where everybody's hair is all messed up where they've been fighting all morning trying to get to church amen i mean there's an old world this song said easy like sunday morning that's true that show's just worldly because because they ain't never been to church a day in their life sunday morning ain't easy sunday morning's a fight i'd be ashamed for y'all to hear some of the conversations i've had on the way to church because it's a battle sunday mornings amen that's when everything's going wrong everybody's ill you can't get nobody up can't get the kids dressed amen it's a battle sunday morning ain't easy nobody posts that on facebook amen they post their fake family on facebook they're right so so people the bible said that in in this last days they'd be uh covetous they'd be looking over at what other people have and wanting it and so they look over at social media and they see what people have on social media and they want it but that's not real amen so they want something that's not possible to attain you see where i'm going here saints they want something that ain't come on amen and so so we find that the world is is setting themselves up for failure by false expectations false expectations of what a marriage is because they've seen a too many romance movies or read too many romance novels false expectations of what they should look like or how they should act because of what they've seen hollywood do or what they've seen somebody post on social media it's false amen it's it's it's all it's all it's i call it their foe family and i want you to i'm skipping down a little bit i want you to think about this before you post the next picture i'm not telling you not to post on facebook and i'm not telling you not to not to get on facebook or social media but just like just like you can read your bible or you can look at something nasty on your phone you can you can get all into facebook and you know if you're being nosy or not amen or you can use it as a tool to talk to your family you can use this tool to talk to somebody about the lord it's whatever you do with it i will tell you this if it keeps you stirred up all the time i'd get rid of it if you're all tore up all the time about what facebook says i'd get rid of it it ain't even facebook now what is it instagram is that the big one now or something i don't know but if it if it doesn't edify you i'd get rid of it amen but let's let that let be led by the holy spirit i i i can't say that it's bad or or good a lot of things are inherently not bad or good just depends on what people are doing with it but i will tell you this brother brown said this in flashing reds uh light of the sign of his coming he said this i want you to think about this before you post the next picture he said i remember a man i worked for chris meisner up here on the corner and many of you remember chris meisner his wife lillian her name was lily i think l wanger and when she a man come over and she was a beautiful girl and a man wanted to get permission from her father to put her face her picture her profile on a box of candy now that don't sound that bad does it he said and this old german luther stood to his feet and said that's an insult to me to put my daughter's picture on a box of candy to spread across the country he says what about today when the billboards the television everything you see is immoral vulgar sexy ungodly looking things now i will tell you this brother branham talked about this german lutheran with admiration that he did not want his daughter's picture her profile to be used on a box of candy amen now you think about what people post on social media today to be spread and seen all over the world amen and so we got to be careful what we put out there the other thing we need to do is be careful if you're doing something private with your family and it's just you and your family it's a private thing let it be private don't post it all over everywhere for everybody else to see amen there's some things that you can do with your family that you probably shouldn't have everybody else around to see that right let your personal business be personal amen so as believers though we got to be careful not to let all of this stuff that's going on all the hollywood and all the facebooks and all the things going on in the world and all the current events we got to be careful not to let all that consume us and and be and and and you know get negative you know you've run into believers that are like current event believers brother ben all they do is watch the news all the time and looking at everything in the news and trying to figure out and that's fine to do that i'm i'm not against that but saints it gets to where it overwhelms them it gets to where it consumes them and we got to be careful about that the only news that we really ought to be worried about is the good news amen we can get so consumed with the news amen that it just sucks the life out of us it's it's so negative it's so it's so evil and so it's so it's a new level of insanity every time you turn it on and it can just drain the the spirit out of you just to watch it and so we we don't need a whole lot of conspiracy theories and and all this kind of thing going on in the message we don't need to be digging holes under our house to hide in and storing up a bunch of food and ammunitions and all that kind of stuff since we're not planning on going through the tribulation we're planning on going home before it gets here amen the the the children of israel the the hebrew children rather they they didn't have a whole bunch of munitions and a whole bunch of food stored up to help them against the king's decree what they had was the fourth man in the fire with them amen and the bride's not doing a lot of planning how we're going to go through tribulation amen we're putting our faith in jesus christ tonight amen and having confidence that he's going to make it through amen he's going to take care of us he's our portion amen he'll take care of us i i'm not i'm not worried about tribulation i'm worried about getting out of tribulation amen so we can't be consumed with all these things and we don't need to be too surprised when things get worse we don't need to get too wrapped up with it you know brother brown said it was going to be this way the bible says it's going to be this way so when we see that happening we just praise the lord it's prophecy being fulfilled amen we can just praise god and say hey it's god's words coming to pass amen you know we don't have to be surprised when something evil comes out of washington because brother brown said washington was corrupt from pillar to post amen so you know i don't have to know what biden's doing i know it's going to be bad because it's corrupt is that right amen when the government does something bad well didn't the devil say he owned them didn't he say i got them i control them and i'll give them to you if you just bow down and worship me so we know they're controlled by the devil so why does it surprise us when they do evil amen they're just doing what their daddy said amen we don't have to be surprised with wars and evils and and the next person that walks down the street uh you know three quarters of the way naked or worse we don't have to be shocked by any of that it's just prophecy being fulfilled but you know this world that we live in is this uh uh this world of deception that we live in you know people are blind to it and it's bad to be blind but you know the bible said it's even worse than that they're blind and they don't know it it's one thing to be blind it's another thing to be blind and not know you're blind and it's worse than that it's not only that they're blind and don't know it it's that they blind and don't know it and they think their rights it's a bad situation to be in and i see brothers and sisters this spirit of delusion can affect us in the message today and we've found if you've been around very long at all you've seen one wave after doctrine after a doctrine after doctrine amen you've seen one false doctrine after another you've seen one thing right after another come through and and every year it seems like a new one crops up amen but the bride will hold to the word of god the bride will believe the word of god above anything else is that right she's going to feed on the word of god the bride of jesus christ feeds on the word of god and it might be crazy to you tonight for a human to think they're a dog that's crazy but to me it's even crazier at people that listen to the message of the hour and decide that it's god's will for them to quit going to church it's delusion saints i want to be the best message believer in the world so i'm going to turn my back on the church where is it at saints it's strong delusion it might be crazy to let a hollywood idol dictate your life that might be crazy amen but it's even crazier to listen to this message and try to lift up a man try to idolize a man a minister a personality amen we look at the word we say look at them they're patterned after hollywood and here we are in a message pattern after a man come on preach come on strong delusion we don't worship men amen it might be crazy for a ten-year-old boy to think he's a girl but it's even crazier to think to be part of the bride everybody's got to listen to the same tape at the same time delusion saints amen and it's look this after these doctrines go away the next batch will come in amen the next batch of false doctrine the best the next batch of of crazy ideas will come right in behind this one amen that's just where we're at right now but there's plenty more to come amen and you know in the world we live in a country of brother braham said woman worship we idolize women in the countries led by women but i'll tell you in the message of the hour it's man worship prayer come on man worship you know there ain't no man that i know of that flies into his britches every one of them puts them on one leg at a time as far as i know amen just men just men now i respect god's gifts i respect the men of god i have respect for them but i'm not going to bow my knee to them amen i'm not going to bow need to amen we're all just men on amen and so we find then that it's a spirit of delusion and i don't believe that the people actually know they're worshiping other people but i'll tell you this if you take another man's word over god's word now now paul said if any man says anything contrary to what i already said he said if i say anything contrary to what i already said if an angel says anything contrary to what i already said let him be a curse let him acknowledge that the words that i say unto you are the words of god amen come on now what does the message say about this investments brother braham says this daniel was a prophet and the words of god the bible the bible was invested to daniel so the words of god came to daniel because the words of god come to the prophet and daniel was a prophet is that right so he said that he invested to daniel to manifest to the people that god still lives see a prophet's job is to manifest that god still lives is that right yeah and daniel's purposed in his heart that he would not defile his investment or if the church could only do that if the church could only purpose in your heart that you won't defile your investment with any tie up with things that brings you into a system see we're not involved in any system saints amen the church of god is led by the holy spirit amen this church is not led by men it's led by the holy spirit amen god appointed a pastor for this church do y'all believe that and that pastor answers to god alone and then he's not answering to a group of men he's not answering to a district presbyter he's not answering to a general overseer nobody tells him what to preach on it's the holy spirit of god that leads the church now he uses he uses a pastor to do that is that right but it the leadership is of the holy spirit not by a group of men and he said daniel purposed in his heart and what did it do it saved his life from the lions the hebrew children made an investment in god here's the part i want to get to the hebrew children made an investment of god that they would not break his commandments no matter if they made an image of their holy brother daniel see saints brother branham said that the king made an image and he wanted them to fall down and worship that image and the image was of daniel amen now that that'd catch a lot of them off guard today wouldn't it see everything that's called message ain't always messed up and he said i believe the image was of daniel because he was built to chase our god and we find out that he made an image to his holy man no matter how holy the man was they wasn't to bow down to any form of image no matter how holy the man was preached no matter how holy it was they wasn't to bow down to that image no matter what the image is the gentile world was issued in by worshiping a holy image and it's going out the same way and you see the system doing it today so the hebrew children would not bow to any image and you find out their investment paid off by saving their life amen so we're not man worshipers amen and so we got strong delusion that keeps coming wave after wave of strong delusion keeps coming the the latest strong delusion that i got a hold of now see i'm the kind of believer that they hate because i'm the kind of believer that knows what brother branham said amen and and that makes people mad amen because all these ideas all these false doctrines they all sound real good and they can spin it and make it sound real good but you know when you start saying well you know what brother brown said they don't like that so the latest doctrine that i like to share these because they some of them just so silly they tickle me but the latest doctrine is that we don't need a fivefold ministry anymore which is apostles prophets uh pastors teachers evangelists right we don't need that anymore because all the fivefold was in brother branham now and and they took quotes of where brother branham said uh a little quote where brother brown says i'm a missionary and they said see there brother brown's a missionary well he didn't say he was the only missionary yeah amen they say do you believe me to be god's prophet well brother graham did say that yeah do you do the work of evangelists make full proof of your ministry the time will come so they said well see he was an evangelist too and then brother braham said you call me your pastor and you say well for so i am that's right that's what he said right he didn't say he was the only pastor teacher he said i want to speak a word or teach this sunday school lesson on the word of a token that's what brother brown said so they put them little snippets of the message out there and then buy them little snippets of the message formulate a doctrine that we don't have a fivefold ministry because it was all god's profit you know how many throw uh quotes you got to throw in the trash to to have a doctrine like that that's right you know how many scriptures got to go into garbage to have a doctrine like that right strong delusion amen so i found me some quotes too and brother brahma says now i'm not a teacher i'm a long ways from being a bible expositor that's what brother braham said so you find a quote says he i'm a teacher i'll find one he said i ain't a teacher now you're going to believe all the prophets said or what is that right we don't believe all the prophets said pastor brother brahm says this i realized years ago i was called to the ministry i've never made a successful pastor is that what he said i've never made a successful pastor because i got a roman rambling spirit i can't be satisfied anywhere just wherever the spirit moves i just go move with it because i believe i have a message amen so you can take a p say he says i'm your pastor but then there's another one where it says i'm not a successful pastor evangelist he said but now he said i was he said but now he never said i was an evangelist he said do the work of an evangelist do that what brother braham said yeah and he says paul was telling timothy he said did you never notice he said he didn't say and now you have been called to be an evangelist it said do the work in evangel see now we notice there then brother brahm said amen so brothers and sisters it's all reprobate minds concerning the truth and we find that the whole world's losing its mind and and it's no different in the message of the hour that people are given to strong delusion saints people will believe anything but the truth they'll believe anything but what the truth is amen as the musicians come i don't think we did bad on time did we people believe anything but the truth and the whole world has lost its mind but saints i want to end on this the christian believers got to lose their mind too we got to lose our mind too amen because the bible said let the mind of christ be in you amen you can't trust your own mind amen so we got to rely on the mind of christ and the mind of christ saints is in his word amen and so all of this uh strong delusion all of these false doctrines all of these false teachings it always comes back to the same thing somewhere along the line we're letting go of the word it will stay with this word it will stay with this teaching it will stay with this message it will stay with this bible yes sir we won't have to worry about all this delusion if we lose our own ideas if we got an idea if we got a thought and that thought disagrees with the word somewhere get rid of that thought and go with what the word says amen amen let the mind of christ be in you i got opinions you've got opinions i've got things that i think you got things you think but if it's contrary to the word it ain't doctrine let the mind that was in christ be in you and if the mind of christ is in you his works you'll do his life you'll live his love you'll have amen his words you'll love amen if the mind is in christ is in you amen he he's the he's the redeemer of the redeemed saints amen he's he's the healer of the hill tonight amen he's he's the savior of the saved he's the encourager of the encouraged to knights he's the filler of the field saints amen he's the sanctifier of the sanctified amen and his works we will do amen and you know the bible said to do the works of god how do you do they ask the lord how you work the works of god and he said this is the work of god that you believe on him who he has sent amen we're believers tonight saints amen let's all stand let the mind that was in christ be in you let's just buy our heads lord jesus we thank you
