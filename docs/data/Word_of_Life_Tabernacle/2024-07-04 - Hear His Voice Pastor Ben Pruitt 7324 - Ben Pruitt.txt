us tonight it's good to have the ersin family back with us and different ones have been out and I know some are traveling tonight 1 Samuel chapter 3 and verse one 1 Samuel chapter three verse one I'm going to uh speak tonight on hear his voice and there's a tape where brother Brandon preaches this in fact all of our quotes tonight will come from that tape and so you can U go back and and listen to it you get a chance for Samuel chapter 3 and verse one the child Samuel ministered unto the Lord before Eli and the word of the Lord was precious in those days there was no open vision and it came to pass at that time when Eli was laid down in his in his place and his eyes began to wax dim that he could not see and he the lamp of God went out in the temple of the Lord where the Ark of God was Samuel was laid down to sleep the Lord called Samuel and he answered here am I and he ran to Eli and said here am I for thou callest me and he said I called not lie down again and he went and lay down the Lord called yet again Samuel and Samuel arose and went to Eli and said here am I for thou D call me and he answered I called not my son lie down again now Samuel did not yet know the Lord neither was the word of the Lord yet revealed unto him and the Lord called Samuel again the third time and he arose and went to Eli and said here am I thou D call me and E Eli perceived that the Lord had called the child therefore Eli said unto Samuel go lie down and it shall be he call thee that thou shalt say Speak Lord for thy servant heareth so Samuel went and laid down on his place verse 10 and the Lord came and stood and called as at other times Samuel Samuel then Samuel answered speak for thy servant Heth I pray the Lord would add his Blessing to the word you may be seated it was a dark time that Samuel was born into in the land of Israel judges like Samson and Gideon had ruled Israel for about 300 years over 300 years at that time but one would raise up and whenever he died Israel would backslide and go into captivity again and here would come another judge and each one had his own personal problems and own failings and things and the people had gotten away from God in fact the Bible tells us that each man did what was right in his own eyes and they had actually got into a place where the ministry was corrupt in fact in the end of the Book of Judges you can find that uh there was a a priest that hired himself onto someone's house for 10 shekels and a shirt if you go look it up that's what it was and and so they hired on to uh a person to a man's house and they said I'll be your priest and I I'll I'll pray to whatever God you want me to pray to if you'll pay me and so it told how much they paid him and that's the kind of uh Ministry that they had at the time Eli had been a good man but his two sons had had corrupted the ministry to the point where they uh they were worthless Sons the Bible calls them men of bile worthless sons and and so it would not continue on from Eli could not through his children it was something he he did not deal with in a in a proper way and and so there was no channel to hear directly from God there was no open Vision there was no prophet in that day that they could look to and to bring light to the word and and so they made up their own Commandments and their own doctrines and the Bible says in Jesus said in vain they do worship me teaching for doctrines the Commandments of men so it was actually the doctrines that they actually made up themselves because they didn't have any headship I'm so glad we have headship in this day and that's the message of the hour there's a reason why we quote William brandom there's a reason why we believe the message why because there it bring it brought light it brought a Channel of God's thinking into our hour so they had no vision they had Moses law but they had no vision to apply it right so they had the word they had what we would say we had the Bible but they had no vision to apply it no profit to bring light for their hour this day is a lot like that day you'll find in 2 Timothy chapter 3 and verse one it says this know also that in the last days perilous time shall come right that's uh that's times that are difficult times that are that are scary and I think we could say we live there today you young people can say I live in perilous times and it gets more and more perilous as we go on he said for men shall be lovers of their own selves the word selfie was invented in our in our generation men should be lovers of their own selves Covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful Unholy without natural affection truth Breakers false accusers incontinent in other words they they just couldn't control themselves no self-control Fierce despisers of those that are good traitors he high-m minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away and he said of this sort or that type of a man or uh that's the kind of man which creep men which creep into houses and Lead captive silly women Laden with sins LED away with divers lust ever learning never able to come to the knowledge of the truth they'll tell you what they believe and they and they have lots of head knowledge but they don't have any any heart knowledge they haven't heard the voice of God yeah that's the age we live in in verse eight now as Janice and jambus withstood Moses so do these also resist the truth men of corrupt Minds repub concerning the faith but they shall proceed no further for their fly should be manifest un all men as theirs also was brother brand said we've seen so much of that he said and it's gone on so long until today the word of the Lord is such a rare thing that someone can come and say thus sayith the Lord he said now we've had a lot of impersonations of that Satan is really on the job there's a lot of janises and jambes out there you can find them on YouTube you can find them in the Pentecostal realm you can find them all over the place he said but there's a lot of impersonations and many years gone by people were afraid to say that unless it was the Lord but today they just don't care right there's no headship in the a there no headship in the world but I thank God the bride has headship today the bride to the to the bride there's a preeminent word that we have that that that controls what we do now there's so many voices today yeah so many voices yeah it's hard to identify the voice of God because there are so many different voices that we hear Brother brandom identifies the voice of pleasure yeah today we have influencers that wasn't something we had even when I was growing up but today we have influencers influencers what's an influencer their sole purpose is of existing is to be a voice right to influence others and they could influence them for good or influence them for bad right and everybody wants to have a show on YouTube everybody wants to be on Instagram right and I'm not preaching against those things there's nothing wrong with those things in themselves right but it's it's what people are doing with it and even young ladies will show off their bodies try to act cute on camera so men will notice them I even mothers will allow their young children uh 12 13 14 year old girls to get on there and and and show off their body and a bunch of perverts watching them and and it doesn't even it makes no sense why a mother why a parent that loves their child would allow that why would you allow that I'm not preaching it any you here none of you do that as far as I know but but it's the world that we live in today and our young men have to deal with that right right and some of them uh and the young men the way that they are and they dress now about as bad as the women do and you can't even tell which one's which by just looking at them yeah and even some of them claim to be Christians or be raised in Christian homes I think when someone says they're a Christian there's a voice to that there's a there's a distinctness to that that we listen to them a little more because they say well I'm a Christian Mom I'm a I run a Christian Channel I'm a Christian influencer but what are they influencing you to are they influencing you to the message of the hour are they influencing you to the right things are they influencing you to the world that voice is strong yeah it's a strong voice voice but I want to speak to you today especially our young people and those coming up but even those of us that are older because that pull those voices are everywhere they're so strong and I want to tell you you got to make time for the voice of God in your life you've got to make time to hear from from God you've got to make a space in your life to hear his voice and I don't care if you got to get rid of everything you've got that could connect to the internet I don't care what you have to do make sure you hear his voice yes sir on now yes sir you don't hear nothing else hear the voice of God I'm not talking about the voice of a man I'm not even just talking about tapes although you need to hear tapes we need to hear them today more than we ever did but that's not exactly what I'm talking about it's not just tapes it's not just it's not just your pastor it's not just something good music but it's the voice of God when he's speaking to you he can speak to you supernaturally individually yeah and you got to hear him say that yeah on Jason you got to hear the voice of God and for you to hear that voice it it requires you to not be pulled in by the voices of this hour am things like Tik Tok pull you in for hours and I I know it's not just the kids that deal with this that's right y'all just hang with me tonight pulls Us in for hours real after real after real it's a voice yeah it's an influence sir no wonder brother brandom cried so hard against Elvis Presley he was a voice but now every little teenage person can become can become Elvis Presley or or or uh any of the great singers that they had back then now everybody's got that kind of influence because of the ability of social media media I say if we've got it let's use it for good yeah let's use it for something positive keep the dirt off of it keep our politics off of it right preach the word on it how are you going to preach the word on it not by saying anything by just living your life if you're going to have it make sure that you live your life in the Holy Ghost kind of way that somebody say that's the kind of person I want to be yes even those voices which are not evil in themselves still drown out the voice of God yes but we need to make time to hear the voice of God yes if I was a young person listen to me church this we need to get real about these things and I'm stirred up tonight and I have been and the devil's been fighting me in my body and and but you know uh we we we got a group group of young people that need to hear from God you need to hear from God you old are young people you need to hear from God you need to hear the voice of God right he needs to speak to you and and direct your life you need to know that you're a Christian you need to know that you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost you need to know that you can you step beyond that you're not dabbling in the world anymore you don't want that anymore you can't play both sides of it you need to hear the voice of God you need to hear it in your own life well how old do you have to be to hear it we'll hear about that in just a minute I'll tell you this if I was a young person struggling with those things that I wasn't sure I had the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'd be at the altar because of the altar is a place where you can hear the voice of God it's a place that we set aside and with these meetings coming up I seek God with all of my heart because it's a time we set aside to put out all them other voices and let the voice of God let the voice of the supernatural speak again in our lives amen you've heard the voice of discouragement you've heard the voice of suicide you've heard the voice of the devil trying to tell you you're nothing you've heard the voice of lust you've heard the voice of of the world hear the voice of God today he wants to tell you I made you and I want you to have communion with me Amen brother brandom talked about being at the supermarket and a girl with with pants on and makeup he said she was about 12 years old he said she said you remember I never got in until 6:00 this morning random overheard this and she wasn't over 12 years old he said now Jesus at 12 which was our example said don't you know I should be about my father's business how many uh how many of you kids are 12 or older 12 how many of you are 11 look at that huh look at that many of you're 10 got several 10 year olds 10 11 12 year olds look where you're coming to right you're coming to the age Jesus was when he went down to the temple and was about his father's business you can be about your father's business in church you can be about your father's business in school you can be about your father's business in the home you're not too young listen to me I was preaching at 12 years old I wasn't very good but I was preaching I'm not telling you that to you to push you into something like that but you can serve God huh you can serve God you can be close to God you can pray and you can pray through all right you can know what it's like to touch Heaven yeah you can know what it's like to feel the presence of God in your life you don't have to wait until some some other age but I'll say to you older ones are we've got older ones that are here with us and my my children Peter and Esther and and the different older ones that are here I'll say this that you're a helper in the church and we love that you help in the church we want you to help but you got to hear the voice of God for yourselves you've got to be do more than just assimilate into a church service you got to become the church and how you going to do that at some point you got to leave those voices behind I'm not listening to YouTube anymore I'm not listening to those things anymore I'm going to follow the voice of God yes sir yeah and I'm preaching to my own children tonight but to all of us maybe some of us adults need to hear it you didn't know it was going you service did you but but maybe some of us adults need to we need to hear his voice again we've heard every other voice we've heard the doctor's voice we've heard we've heard the guy down the road's voice you've heard all the you can get on the internet and search all the different pastors and all the message churches why don't you get hear his voice again amen nothing wrong with those things but make sure you hear his voice right sure it's not drowned out but the brand said Jesus at 12 was our example don't you know I should be about my father's business no wonder the voice of God is a rare thing today it's smothered out by so many different voices so many things that dim and take away it's got to a place till it dulls our senses until we can't hear the voice of God yeah oh my that's true oh if that was that way in 1958 can you imagine how much more today and brother bam talked about things they dealt with in his day and I talked about a few things we deal with today but but that's just where we live but Samuel was a 12-year-old boy according to Josephus when he was there in the temple and his his mother had brought him when he was weaned she had brought him up to the temple and dedicated his life to God you young people have been dedicated your lives have been dedicated to God your parents brought you up to be dedicated you you've been you've been given over committed to God yeah and yet he had to hear the voice of God and he was a prophet but the Bible says he didn't know God that's right and you got to get to where you know God you got to know him for yourself you got to have a personal relationship with him where he can talk to you like he did to Samuel yeah and he spoke to Samuel and Samuel didn't recognize that it was him because he'd not ever heard his voice before but when he spoke he answered it and it's a good thing when we hear the voice of the Lord to answer the voice of God now listen the voice of God has been dled but Samuel waited on the Lord when Eli told him he said go back and wait and lay back in your bed he went back and waited on the Lord when he called him he waited to hear what he had to say brother brand said men that Waits upon God comes into his presence I think we need to wait on God we don't in other words we don't need to get in such a hurry to get things done we need to hear from God and we need God to move in a supernatural way I I don't know about you but I need God Supernatural in my life because that's where the devil's fighting yes is in a supernatural Realm a lot of the battles that we fight in the natural are not really natural battles we're fighting them in the natural but really it's an influence of a supernatural realm and there's demons that are influencing people and you think you're you're battling with that person but really it's a devil that's influencing that spiritual wickedness in high places and so what's happening is in your life you're fighting carnal battles but we need a supernatural God right we need God to move in in a supernatural way and there's sometimes when you know and I believe we should do everything we can in the natural everything we know to do but when you don't know what else to do when you don't know what door to open when you don't know which way to turn you got to turn back to a supernatural God and believe he's able to keep you and have the faith to believe he'll answer you and speak to you see brother BR said man that Waits upon God comes into his presence yeah we need to come into His presence to come into the presence of God is just like going out early of the morning the Dew and the honeysuckles are all sweet he said when you come in the presence of a person like that you know they have been with God a person who's hard and angry all the time upset they they've just not been spending enough time with God sure right they may have been doing all the things necessary they might be reading their Bibles and listening to tapes and doing all the things necessary but they just haven't broke through that there's something holding them back yeah you realize our time with God is important yes you know when we have time with our children as parents you know we don't want to spend all our time on our phone we want to spend our time with our kids God help me I I'm the worst about that because I'll get a a text from somebody in the church or somebody overseas or somebody else and I'm always dealing with something and so you're always getting off of that or you're or or or just to be honest you're looking on Facebook Marketplace for something you want to buy right and you're supposed to be spending time with your kids and you're looking every other place except for doing that but you realize that what a what that does is your your children don't get to spend any time with you and and so you don't really get to know them you might be you might be physically doing the right things but have you surrendered your time to God to the point where you can sweeten up in his presence that's what I want to do I want to surrender my time to him take some time and surrender to him say Lord help me to be ready for these meetings coming up help me to be ready to go to work or whatever I have to do whatever you have to do help me be ready to do the thing that I need to do I need to be in your presence amen and if you don't think you need to be in his presence you just not haven't met him yet sir cuz if you ever spent five minutes in his presence you'd crave that the rest of your life all of your life your life would be empty until until you got back in his presence I told you I think last Wednesday night I just want God to move I want to see him move and I feel him and I know he's moving in our services but I want him to move that much more and how can we do that we need to get in his presence we need to shut out all the other voices and take the time that we need to take to come into contact with God again scrub all the old dust off and all the old all the old rust off right I that's uh I think my sister or somebody one time she had a a car that wouldn't start and and it just she thought she needed a new battery she needed this that or the other all she needed was the was the rust to be scrubed off the cables and tighten the thing up I think sometimes we just need a new connection we just we don't need that it's not that we don't have the Holy Ghost it's not that we're not children of God we just need a new connection we need to take the the wire brush and scrub some things out of our life and let God let the current start flowing again let God begin to move again because we need him more now than we ever had before true yes sir now look so many things to dull the senses of the people today he said oh in the midst of all that in spite of every dolling and every voice oh I'm so thankful for this today in spite of every Ding and every voice that's in the world today some of them pleasure voices some of them are sinful voices to lure the people but in the spite of every bit of that the truth of God Still Remains he that will hear my voice and come after me men and women who will hear the voice of God God still waits to speak to every someone say every every individual that will open their ears to hear God's voice you you say well he won't speak to me you don't realize brother Ben what I've done or what I've been no he'll speak to you if you'll open up your ears and give him time to speak I had this quote hanging in my office on my calendar one time here a while back said pastor don't you never get too busy what you can stay in the presence and listen for his Voice Hallelujah God always keeps his word he said no matter how bad the times may be how much your church May teach against it Jesus Christ is still willing to speak that still Small Voice to anybody that will listen for him listen to me young people he's willing to speak to you he said but I'm only 12 years old Samuel was only 12 years old I'm only 11 years old he'll speak to an 11y old yeah let me ask you this if you got ears yeah man you got ears he can speak to you you got you got a mind he can speak into your mind he can talk to you sir if you just let him talk to you yes amen I know you can feel the presence of God I've seen even babies that can feel the presence of God there just something about it they can feel and know that he's there and I say every one of us need to need to be able to feel the presence of God I believe we can but we just need to learn how to respond to it as young people we need to learn how to respond to it if if we feel pull in our heart to come to the altar we need to do that if we feel a pull in our heart to raise our hand we need to do forget what your friends are doing forget what they're thinking about or what they might think about you just do what God tells you to do and you just get on fire you say well Mom and Dad don't do it I don't care what Mom and Dad do you need to hear the voice of God in your life there was a time when they needed to hear the voice of God yeah yes brother brand said every every one of you people who profess to be Christians get yourself quiet before him don't let the washing hinder don't let the work hinder don't let nothing hinder don't let nobody know what you're doing right so we don't have to post it all over the place what we're doing just go before him yes get up in the woods somewhere get out on the side of the road go into the secret closet and close the door when the kids get at school they go down on your knees you've heard all kinds of voices everywhere but just get down and stay there until those voices are silenced and you begin to lift up it'll change you it'll make you like it did this little Samuel I know sometimes we get under conviction we say Lord I need to be different how can we be different we need to come in the presence of God you've heard the word you just need to come in his presence now we continue to hear the word and preach the word but you need to come in the presence of God good Mo Moses was 80 years old when he heard his voice he saw a bush burning yes sir now you kids you know if you saw a bush on fire but it wasn't burning up you'd begin to turn aside because what he was seeing was something that was out of the natural Supernatural That's What Supernatural means something that's not normal something un happened some of you young people have been healed by God you know you felt bad and you come for prayer and you were healed well that's Supernatural you've seen your parents maybe maybe change and and what they were and what they become and that's a supernatural thing and they tell you their testimony it was a supernatural thing but you got to have the supernatural in your own life and you need to if there's a bush burning and it's not being consumed you need to look at it and see what it is right turn aside take a minute yes right you can't do that if you're just like this all the time right I'm having to be good tonight but for like this all the time how are we going to hear his voice right how are we going to do that you young people don't you just can't wait well when I get my first phone man that be the day I'll really oh hear his voice first and the phone won't be such a problem all right sir hear his voice yeah good you need to hear his voice you need to decide where you belong you need to go to the place where you know I'm a child of God and I belong to God and I might fail and I might fall and I might falter from time to time but I'm always coming back because I know I'm a Child of God I'm not going to try to hide my sin I'm not going to try to I'm not going to try to say well nobody knows what I'm doing but I'm just going to confess it and say Lord I'm I know I'm a child of yours I belong to you I'm going to move on I'm going to go forward I'm going to believe God yes Moses was 80 years old when he heard his voice so it works for us old people too just throw myself in there so no one gets offended he saw a bush burning but not consumed something Supernatural the presence of the burning bush made a different man out of Moses brother said five minutes in the presence of that bush changed Moses forever did more for him than taught him more about God than 80 years of teaching had right he said it'll make a different man and woman out of you if you'll just stand still long enough to hear his voice like Samuel did stand still don't be excited if you want something of God ask him then stand still and listen see what he's going to say about it just open up your heart and say what about it Lord Jesus just stay there if he doesn't answer the first five hours then wait another amen if he doesn't answer today he'll answer tomorrow if he doesn't answer this week he will next week stay there till he answers hear his voice speak back in your heart and say yes I'm the Lord that Health thee then it's all over you can settle then see I'm the Lord who forgives all thy sins go and sin no more I don't condemn you he said then you can go free you're all right but you want to be sure that you heard that voice speak Moses heard it he was a changed man listen when we find ourselves getting cold and indifferent we need another burning bush experience it would be okay for all of us to have that it'd be all right well I'm not an emotional person I didn't say you'd be emotional but you need to meet God yes I I'll be honest with you if I if I met God in a physical form today if if the Lord Jesus Christ walked up to me physically and I saw him and I knew it was him I tell you what I'd tell people about it you talk about somebody shouting and running and going places it wouldn't be like oh uh oh I forgot to tell you I saw God three weeks ago well where you been hiding him you know wouldn't be like that would it right if you met the president well maybe not this one but if you met a a president anyway that was that was competent you you'd go up to him and and You' talk to them and you'd say you know you know it's so nice to meet you you'd want your picture taken with them it probably wouldn't even matter what party they were you'd tell everybody I'd know about it tomorrow You' text me hey I talked to the president today I wonder if we could be like that about talking to God I talked to God today he was there with me I felt his presence I know things are going to be okay pastor I know I'm going to be all right because I talk to God today amen good found ourselves getting cold and different we need another burning bush experience to clear out all the draws so we can hear his voice again yes Isaiah was a young man when he heard his voice he was friends with King Uzziah who had a great influence over his life and he gave him everything he wanted but one day Uzziah died and that influence went away and in the year that King Uzziah died in Isaiah 61 he said I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple above it stood the seraphim each one had six wings with 20 covered his face with Twain he covered his feet with Twain he did fly and one cried to another and said holy holy holy is the Lord of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory and the post of the door moved at the voice of him that cried and the house was filled with smoke and then said I woe is me for I am undone because I'm a man of unclean lips and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips for my eyes to seen the king the Lord of hosts when you see somebody that claims to have been in the presence of God and they get more and more self-righteous do you know that they really haven't been because if you ever got in the presence of God you'd realize you need uh you need to be a cold to touch your lips you you need to be purified by in his presence amen you wouldn't be critical of the ministry you wouldn't be critical of other people you wouldn't spend your time running people down what would you do you get to business down to business with God say God I need to be purged I need to be changed amen yeah we don't we don't want to be self-righteous we want to be clean Isaiah got desperate that when you got desperate about this thing something will take place he said you're not desperate and I thought well I join church that settles it but you have to be desperate about it you have to really need God yes Jesus said blessed are they that do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be F listen if you were hungry enough you would go get something to eat we're all Americans right we wouldn't just wait here until some food appeared we would go find food yeah if we got hungry enough some of y'all going to go down to McDonald's after church we're going to find food after church at McDonald's why because we get hungry we're human beings but there's something inside of you there's a thirst that God put there it's a thirst for him and we shouldn't fill that with things of the world but he said blessed are they that do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled he said but as long you say why don't I thirst like that because you're satisfied with things of the world come on church I'm not just saying that about you I'm not trying to be mean to you tonight I'm preaching to us as a people I'm preaching to us as a as an age in a generation when when lukewarmness is everywhere and and once in a while we need to stir ourselves up again right and let God speak to us again yes yes amen long as you're satisfied with the things of the world how can God ever speak to you you say God never spoke to me why he wants to he's got an appointment on your calendar I got a calendar back there with people that I need to talk to and things I need to do and and and I look at that calendar and I think God wants to talk to me today yeah he wants to talk to you today are you going to give him time to talk are you going to give him time to talk are you going to are you going to let him talk to you how do I do that just lay the Bible before you and sit down and listen he'll talk to you begin to get on your knees and pray he'll talk to you tell him what you have need of and then stop and listen for him to speak he may not speak in an audible voice he may speak to your heart but somehow he'll speak yes sir oh my you said God you say God never spoke to me why he wants to but you're too filled up with the things of the world you're too full you don't want nothing to eat spiritually because you're so full because remember it all works in the same realm and Satan if he can fill you up and make you fat and happy and lay to see I don't mean physically I mean spiritually if he can do that then he knows you'll never you you'll never hunger for God and that's exactly where he wants you to be Isaiah 66 but blessed are those that hunger right blessed are those that hunger for they're the ones that's going to get filled then flew one of the seraphim unto me having a live coal in his hand which he had taken with the tong tongs from off the altar he laid it upon my mouth and said Lo this hath touched thy lips and thine iniquity is taken away and thy sin purg also I heard the voice of the Lord saying whom shall I send who will go for us then said I here am I send me who will go for us said the Voice who will go who is willing to stand in the breach amongst this bunch of Theologian who will go in this day and claim that I'm still God somebody's got to who will go and condemn their uncleanness who will tear down their denomination and build the powers of the Living God again who will go I want to challenge you young people some of you especially you older ones man you're almost you're of an age where you could do something for God yeah who will go yeah have you heard the voice of God speaking to you yeah who will go somebody's got to fill those roles in the years ahead yeah there's some of our elders are getting older somebody's got to fill that role somebody's got to pray like sister Fritz prays some somebody's got to be faithful like brother Bill and sister Karen and different ones are faithful somebody's got to be a help like Brother Paul's a help somebody's got to fill those roles if we're here very much longer those people and and right now's the time Now's the Time To Learn Now's the Time to grab a hold of the horns of the Altar and say Lord Make Me committed to your cause let me be a help and not a hindrance let me be somebody that's willing to do what God called me to do let me know what you called me to do how you going to ever know what you're called to do unless you hear his voice yeah you don't even know yet some of you girls might marry preachers wouldn't that be awful depends on the preacher right wouldn't that be awful Melody to marry a preacher yeah she knows that's a preacher's kid there some of you boys might be preachers think about that for a minute think about it come on now say well I mean come on we got proof of that in our own congregation God made brother Joel a preacher come on Amen I mean right God can you may not feel like it right now but Joel was I don't know if he was more like Jason or Wyatt but he was like one of these boys here maybe a mixture of the two at one time Jason's pointing at Wyatt Wy you could be a preacher you ever think about that I know you don't think so but God has to call you right I didn't plan on being a preacher either I wanted to be a mechanic I don't even know which end of the wrench to use all I can use I'll use a wrench for us to hit things with but I heard the voice of God at a young age speaking in my heart and he said go and I said who I can't go I I'm not old old enough to go I'm not he said go and I'll be with you right who will go for us who will see that this message doesn't become some distant cold formal theology in the future who will see that God still moves among us who will see that there's still Worship in the church right we watch the elders pass on and suddenly nobody says amen nobody worships I say it's about time we stood up as young people and said it's time that we took charge of the worship and said we're going to praise God we're going to amen the preacher we're going to listen we're going to do what's right who will go you're going to have to go who's going to send missionaries we still need missionaries who's going to send missionaries who's going to make the money and have a good job enough to send somebody yeah somebody's got to be committed yeah somebody's got to be committed to doing what's right who will go who will go and build the powers of the Living God again well I'm glad I'm glad a prophet went in our day and I'm glad I'm glad people went before me I'm glad brother bisc went he's getting older now not preaching anymore glad the other brothers that have passed on they went I'm glad they went they're getting older who will go somebody's got to fill the role I refuse to believe that God don't have somebody that's right every one of us has a lived voice you say well I'm not I'll never be a preacher but every one of us has a lived voice brother Brandon said oh that Jeffersonville could have thousands of lived voices he said if you're a preacher preach the gospel get a Pulpit and preach but if you're not a preacher live your message live your message and and how do you live your message by becoming the word you can't live it unless you hear his voice amen Paul was about 30 years old when he heard his voice and act 9:4 he fell to the Earth and he heard a voice saying unto him Saul Saul why persecutest thou me he said who art thou Lord and the Lord said I am Jesus whom thou persecutest it is hard for thee to kick against the Pricks at High Noon he was knocked off his horse sounds like a western don't it and he found out his man-made religion was wrong the voice of God spoke to the pillar of fire and said Paul you're persecuting me come on now he said who are you he said I'm Jesus whom you're persecuting yes sir his name was changed that day from Saul to Paul he was sent to give his life preaching to people he wouldn't even eat with before right Gentiles Gentile dogs is what they called them but he gave his life preaching to them oh I'm so glad I'm so glad that there's an open Vision today I'm so glad we got something when we hear the voice of God we can go sir amen but now we got to hear the right voice make sure the CU the devil's always speaking so we don't just take any voice how do we know kids how do you know don't get bored yet I'm not done how do you know that the voice of God speaks to you how do you know you check it by the word right and all that means is is it in the Bible right is it have a foundation of scripture and then if it has a foundation of scripture did a prophet bring it out in the way that person is bringing it out that's important I don't mean you can't ever preach anything a proph didn't preach but what it means is it fits right the puzzle makes sense right with what a prophet said it's not contrary to what a prophet said right right and that's be that fits with the open vision and if your vision is contrary to the word you're listening to the wrong voice right don't care how powerful it was how strong it was or how much impressed you were if it's contrary to what God Said in the Bible what a prophet said it's wrong yeah right and but the Bible says my sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me and I give unto them eternal life they shall never perish aren't you glad for that promise tonight neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand Peter heard His Voice have you got a few more minutes tonight Peter heard his voice it made him eat differently right it changed his attitude towards the Gentile church he heard the voice of God when he saw that vision and or fell into that trance and and he saw the sheet and it had all kinds of all kinds of food on it and bacon and and ham and everything like that and he said oh no I've never eaten anything like that in my life but the voice answered me again from Heaven said what God has cleansed that call not thou common all right now let me say this we got to watch what we say about the church because there's a bigger point there what God is cleansed is his church that's what he's cleansed you're the bride his church the bride don't call that common and unclean all right yeah be careful what you say about God's people yes listen I'd Rather somebody criticize me I got lots to be criticized for I if you don't have enough I'll give you some ammunition come ask me I can tell you things to criticize me about I know more about me than you do probably but but but what but what God has cleansed let's leave him alone yes sir right what God has cleansed don't call that Calon and unclean be careful what you say we get we get criticism sometimes for being too Pentecostal I don't know where that comes from good Lord we're not Pentecostal enough are we come on church sometimes I just wish I'd get an amen and people are criticizing me for being Pentecostal I mean come on it's just silly really people just don't listen they don't they don't pay attention but brother brandom says this about that he said God he said I wish he'd take a bunch of preachers in this Valley here let them know we're not crazy all right we're not Holy Rollers a bunch of trash it's the spirit of the Living God and men and women are drunk on his goodness it's not witchcraft or mental telepathy it's the spirit of the Living God he said turn loose of your Traditions elders and listen to the voice of the Living God it'll change you you won't become one of the persecutors you'll want to be one of them if you've been a persecutor you need to change sides yeah if you can pass the barriers of all your doctrines he said until you can float into his presence Yonder something will take place you won't believe the days of Miracles has passed you believe that they're right here cuz one will be performed on you sure to change a man yeah he said that's what that voice of God always does it changes men and women and makes them what they should be not what the schools and teachers has made but what God has pattered them for I say God let me hear your voice today let me be changed into what you want me to be Hallelujah brother brandom heard his voice when he was a child do you know that younger than probably anybody sitting here on the front row right brother Bram heard the voice of God he spoke brother Bram thought it was a bird talking to him that's how young he was in the tree or that there was a man in the tree he said the bird flew away so he thought there was a man in the tree and a voice spoke and said don't ever smoke or drink or defile your body with women because I got to work for you to do I believe you young people can hear the voice of God and I want that so bad sadly for my children hear that voice it's not just for brother brandom he was he had a special Ministry but you need to hear a voice that there's something for you to do it may not be his job but you do have a job you do have a place hear his voice said don't ever smoke or drink or defile your body they said oh he's just nervous and but but he remembered that right you could hear his voice today and remember what he told you sir so there's a work for you to do when you get older Lazarus heard his voice amen he heard his voice in John 11:43 he'd spoken he said he had him roll the stone away and he cried with a loud voice Lazarus come forth Lazarus comes hopping out you know still Bound in his grave clothes said why did you bring me back here right but he heard the voice the voice was so powerful all right oh my you believe he can't talk to you you say well brother Ben he can't talk to me he can't talk to me I've got all these know it was so powerful amen that if he hadn't said Lazarus all the great dead would have come out all right it was so powerful Lazarus in another dimension all right doing whatever they do over there he's over there enjoying himself and as he's in another dimension he hears the voice of Jesus speak Lazarus come forth and he come all the way back from another dimension to this Dimension what was it the voice amen the same voes spoke to you brother BR said what what his voice was today he said his voice the the final voice to the final age would be the bride yeah under their messenger they would be the final voice to the final age what where is his voice today not in that body that stood there but it's in this body in your body it's in the body of his Believers yes that's where that powerful voice is yes I think we ought to speak I think we ought to speak the words of God listen to Spirit of the Bride say come let him that hear us say come let him that is a thirst come whosoever will let him take the Water of Life freely yes oh my listen the BR said I was dead once in sin and trespasses you were dead in sin and trespasses but it was the voice of God it said come unto me all you that labor and are heavy laden I will give you rest aren't you glad you heard that voice amen I've seen the voice speak to the straighten him up he said I've seen the voice of God speak to the Blind and his eyes come open to the dying cancer ridden to the leper see them return back in flesh in the perfect health again I've seen him speak to the alcoholics and neurotics and the offcast and the skidrow bunch and they become ladies and gentlemen and Saints of the Living God because the voice of God spoke he said that's what we listen for today do you realize what God did in our day you realize what he did he spoke his voice was spoken again it was spoke why did he speak in our day because he didn't want us to look back at that leper that was cleansed in the Bible and say well it just happened back then but he wanted us to know he's the same yesterday today and forever that he never changes he wanted us to know brother b b said my Ministry is to show that he's here he's here and where he is anything is possible amen hallelujah oh if he can come in the room anything is possible I I hope you're hearing me now anything is possible when he comes in the room said I've seen you speak to the alcoholics and neurotics and the offcast and skidrow bunch become ladies and gentlemen of saints to the Living God because the voice of God spoke that's what we listen for today one day all will hear his voice John 5:28 Marvel not at this for the hour is coming in the which all that are in the graves someone say all all will hear his voice but listen how they hear that voice and what they come up to depends on how they responded here on the Earth right our response to the word matters right in our lives and our actions and our in our voices in fact that's the brother BR thought is the evidence of the Holy Ghost was saying Amen to every word that that's that's what it it identifies it in our life not that we'll not that you have to say Amen to every word I say but but you agree with every word of God yeah today if you'll hear his voice you'll be identified yes in the first resurrection oh my oh my oh my Revelation 20 and6 says blessed and holy is he that hath part in the First Resurrection on such the second death hath no power but they shall be Priests of God and of Christ shall reign with him a thousand years what was it he said back in John 5:29 he said shall come forth they that have done good to the resurrection of life that have done evil to the resurrection of damnation everyone of in the graves when they hear his voice will raise they will raise but when they raise and how they raise oh I don't want to raise in this old body I want to raise in a new body I don't want to be judged for my actions I want to be I want to be standing there as his bride as his wife how do I do that by hearing his voice yes today and responding to that voice Samuel responded to the voice that he heard Speak Lord no suspicion no criticism speak speak Lord yeah wonder if we could respond that way when we hear preachers come in and preach the words of God if we just say Speak Lord I won't Channel this through my blinders and how I want to see it but I want whatever you've got for me speak for thy servant heareth sir why did he respond he' made up his mind that was the voice of God he had confidence that was God's voice yeah I trust today we have confidence the message of the hour yes is God speaking to us whether it's spoken through a prophet or through Ministry or however it's the the message is God speaking to us oh my you want to hear his voice yes you young people don't you want to hear his voice it's already there you know that right huh

too many fans on we're listening to the voice of our friends the voice of somebody else the voice of YouTube the voice of Disney huh we're listening to all of that and he wants to speak he is speaking we just need to turn off some voices let him speak take time and let him do it whether it's in our services whether it's wherever it's at stop rushing through it this is a moment when God can speak to you and change your life right would you bow your heads with me musicians go ahead and come Speak Lord for thy servant heareth Speak Lord that's what I want tonight more than anything that's what I
