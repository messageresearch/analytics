uh brother Peter's going to give his testimony and the other ones have sent them to me so you're going to hear them but you'll have to hear me tell them and I might become a baby when I tell some of these CU they bless my heartbody he's proud of our youth here at the church they they they blessed my heart I wish you could have seen them at the meetings I know brother Joe and sister Anna did did and and uh just just seeing them over there and and seeing how they responded to the word of the Lord and the spirit of the Lord moving on the people that was just a blessing to me and uh sister lilian's not able to be here there was a death in their family and they went to be with them so she was with us as well and also sister Jasper is not I didn't get a testimony from her but I I saw her her and her cousin there praying at the at the altar and really seeing a move of the Lord in their lives and so I was blessed by that as well sister Lillian sent me this uh see if I can find it here and it's got a quote it opens with a quote she sent me this testimony she said you know you're going to have a test the next day how many knows that's to be true that's true that's right and instead of running around all night getting up the next morning and think well I'll set next to so and so and they're smart and I can copy off of them he said if you'll just before Dad returns think thanks at The Breakfast Table if you'll say dad remember me today I got to take a test in chemistry or whatever it is right thank you when you pray dad say God bless John Mary and their test today I tell you it'll turn the tide that is true that's good advice for parents today isn't it and uh remember we can have what we want if we will ask in faith believing Jesus said all things are possible to them that will not that will believe you have not because you ask not and you ask not because you believe not he said ask in abundance that your joy may be full I like that and our teaching our teaching right say the right thing do the right thing think the right thing always be thinking right and he said I have a little slogan do right that's your duty to God think right that's your duty to yourself and you're bound to come out right that's a good slogan sister Lillian said this quote came to my mind right before heading to Camp which caused me to ask for the church to pray with the youth before we left and while at Camp I watched over them and prayed for them as they went through the services and the prayer line and seeing the youth coming with an experience and being filled with the Holy Ghost really blessed me as well as confirmed the word being preached to us as true aren't you thankful God still confirms his word to be true amen so brother Peter where's he you're right there he can come go ahead and come and give your testimony then I've got I've got one from Sister Esther and and uh sister Emma brother Landon my missing trip man you're all the way in the back tonight buddy all right well amen give brother Peter a hand as he comes and testifies for us BL I have a lot of notes here but I'll just read U just read a few off and some of the things that I experienced and uh um you know it it takes you know it takes a lot for me to get emotional and and get in the really just get in the spirit but this this Camp is you know really blessed me over the years and I I really appreciate brother Wendell and and the people down there we we really appreciate appreciate them uh working so hard for just for us you know and and it means a lot to the youth and and uh I've I've seen Landon back there he's doing the video right now but I've seen him you know really you know move make a move for God and it it really blessed my heart and and all these kids you know it it's just it's just a really great experience to see other kids with that experience the Holy Ghost and and just experience that fire it's really amazing and you know I I was carrying a lot of baggage around um before Camp I I just I had a lot of things on my mind I I was anxious and stressed and I I worry a lot and you know just just being there and in the presence of God it just made me realize that I just need to surrender to God more and I need to I need to just you know uh I need to just surrender to his will and everything's going to be all right if you just if you just let God handle it and you know when you're in that presence and and you ask God you say Lord just fill me up again and and just take all this anxiety and worry out of me you know and it just it just Thrills your heart you know when you when you feel God moving around and you see him and and you see people getting blessed and some people you never think you know it they would do certain things and when they get in the presence of the Lord they just they just start crying and for God and and just you know really responding and you know I I I didn't I didn't realize how much of a religious spirit I had on me until I I got in that presence and I realized that I I just needed to I needed to let the Lord take care of it and and I you know I I read the word and study the message and and you know it it I feel like I'm a good a good enough person you know if I do that but I just need to I need to learn every day that I need to more and more and I need I need Jesus just to come into my life and just take all those that those things out of me just pour himself out into my spirit and just make this broken vessel into a worthy vessel for Jesus Christ and I really appreciate brother Joel and my dad for letting me go down there and and uh it's really been a blessing for me and I know it's been a blessing for these other kids so I'll just uh get out and let them let him read the rest of the testimonies and God bless you guys man that's wonderful that's why we it's why we go we want people to be blessed and filled with the Holy Ghost sister uh sister Esther said this she said I just want to say that I was truly blessed by a touch from the Lord at camp this year I thoroughly enjoyed and appreciate the effort that was put in to having a holy ghost filled camp and I would say Amen to that than Lord amen we're thank we we thank the Lord for men that'll put in a lot of effort I I watch them they're tired brother Wendell has done a phenomenal job at that camp I know a lot of y'all have been to the Louisiana camp and you've seen what they've done down there and I I've never been but but this Camp over here is a little closer and so we've tried to support it just as much as we could and and I believe we're seeing the fruits of that now and uh I want to go up here sister sister Emma where are you here you do you want to come up and say this or you want me to tell it for you okay all right wanted to give you another chance we love sister Emma don't we didn't she do a good job singing tonight all our kids wonderful I'm just buying time where I don't have to preach if I take take enough time telling stories sister sister Emma really blessed my heart I I saw this one the other day and I'll try to get through this one through the past couple of months I've been feeling really low like I wasn't good enough for nobody and the devil kept telling me maybe you're not the bride maybe you're just a mistake he was trying to make me depressed and I felt like getting the Holy Ghost was super complicated and almost impossible but when I got in the prayer line at Camp I realized just how lost I was and that if I didn't get a hold of Jesus I might as well just give up then I just started crying and sincerely praying and when I got to the ministers and felt that anointing it felt like everything just lifted off of me and I heard brother Andrew saying she's going through that door then it was like I felt the Holy Spirit blow through me so when I got back to my seat I was just balling then it dawned on me I got it thank the Lord praise the Lord for that she said I was expecting something huge Supernatural experience but it was just so simple oh yes anyways when brother Timothy mentioned Eternal destination Sunday morning I knew where I was going aren't you thankful I say praise the Lord for it brother Landon he's back there tonight running video he raised his hand you probably didn't see him but I did I love brother Landon he was a real I tell you what got to know him a little better going on this trip and uh what a what a good young man he is proud of him proud of very proud of him and I I'll say this I don't want to embarrass our kids I love our kids but I was had the privilege of being in that prayer line and to watch kids that are quiet you know you don't see them move a lot forgive me I'm just a baby don't look at me when I'm crying I look at these kids and when they come through that prayer line and have to help them through because the spirit of the Lord was so strong on them they couldn't hardly walk I'm going to tell you right now that's not a put on that's not them kids just acting like them kids that's the Holy Spirit getting hold of them kids now I've been there I felt it don't don't tell me that's just emotionalism church that's the Holy Spirit coming down on these kids now we don't want to Let's encourage them let's get behind them let's not try to beat them down say well go ahead they need encouragement if any's going to if anybody's going to make it out of L to see it's going to have to be some kids filled with the Holy Ghost that are not afraid I tell you what we've got too many people out here accusing our youth camps saying they're too emotional I say let go and let God have his way in our young people Landon said this he said I had a similar experience to Emma I've been struggling for a while with depression and feeling confused about my direction in life I had a loser mentality and felt unloved and isolated before I went to Camp I did not want to go through the prayer line at first because I had a lot of anxiety about it but the day of the prayer line I felt compelled to go through and after I was prayed for I felt weightless and like a burden was lifted from me since I've returned from Camp I've been happier and feel like my relationship with God has gotten stronger say praise the Lord Brother Landon love you buddy brother trip big old boy like you ought to be able to stand up here and tell this yourself I got to tell this first we's on our way home and and you know Wendell's got a specific way of talking and it's very catchy and brother wendle might have used the phrase you know my cup's just running over a few times during those meetings so I get in the van we're coming home and I hear from the back well my cup's just running over Hallelujah from the back I look back it's trip I was like well my goodness the boy got anointed while he was gone you preach if you get that voice buddy he said here's my testimony when I arrived at Camp I immediately felt like I wasn't good enough to be there and I felt like you haven't been in the message long enough to be at this camp in the day devil was constantly attacking me saying you don't belong here that's what the devil says too a it that's when you know it's the devil when he tells you he don't you don't belong in church he said and I don't understand why you are here there isn't anything for you here but something told me to keep pressing on as the services progressed I began to have a feeling like the devil is going to be defeated and the prayer line Saturday night I went through and as each Minister prayed I felt chains falling off of me and as soon as I made it back to my seat I fell down in the prayer in prayer and then I had the simple Revelation that I am good enough to follow the message Hallelujah I am good enough to walk close with God no matter my past I say praise the Lord to that if it's under the blood God don't even see it I'm proud of our kids give them a big hand I I tell you what very proud of them and i' I'd like to say this I want to thank the church I know brother Ben men personally paid for all the camp fees and helped a lot on the way over there and and uh I tell you what if we can do it again I I think it'd be wonderful I think the old when these kids get of age I highly encourage you to send them kids to Youth Camp you say well why why do they have to go to Camp well there's an atmosphere there of expectation yeah and an atmosphere of expectation is important for these kids to get in the presence you got to get a uh brother Bram talks about an egg and I might get to it here in a minute but he talks about an egg he said you can put it under a puppy you can put it anywhere but it's got to be an atmosphere there's got to be a certain temperature there it's almost got to be you got to get these kids we got to get them right and there's nothing we can do personally but it's got to take the Holy Ghost in their lives and uh as parents I think it would do us good to make sure we keep our kids in Services where the Holy Ghost is I think we need to always come expecting the Holy Spirit to move in church why because it could it could determine their Eternal destination every service we have come on is important for that child that's sitting there so with that being said do you love our kids would you give them another big hand are you proud of them now let's stand together they didn't take up as much time as they should have but I've just got something real short so I won't hold you long how many love the Lord tonight oh yeah man I told the kids I said you I said you back them preachers at camp and stand you standing up and raising your hands and shouting and they I think Ben said well well if you preach like they did they'll back you like they did so I ain't expecting much if you have your Bibles let's let's turn to we're just going to skip that first one sister Joan we're Genesis 1 and two uh Genesis 1 verse one and two Genesis 1 1 and two and then I'll let you be seated in the beginning God created the Heaven and Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters oh thank you and you may be seated may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of the word it's reading there and and and if you notice it says the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the earth and the spirit of God moved upon the face the spirit of God had to do something in the beginning we've needed the spirit of God from then and we still need the spirit of God today we can't get by without it and brother Brandon was talk was was here he says he he said A man was made to be a God he said do you know that he's in the image of God he's a Son of God he's like him he was given domain and dominion over the whole earth he said that's right he Ruled the Earth he ruled the animal kingdom and all other kingdoms and all but the kingdom of God above he was God he was an amateur God he was made in the image of God and made like God he had hands like God feet like God he was in the image of God he said what happened because he disbelieved God's word it sent him right back out uh to shift for himself now he said God's trying to bring him back again and when you have faith and accept him he said my brother just let that little light begin to grow and taking all the roots of doubt and bitterness and yielding yourself to the spirit and then you begin to become a son and daughter of God he said you begin to grow in the grace of God the Holy Spirit begins to build his kingdom within you he said now if you've grieved that Spirit somewhere then go right back and think in your mind what did I start doing come on what did you start doing to grieve the spirit of God now you need to go back to that spot wherever you were grieving the spirit of God and neglect he said what was it he said he he said go back if you've grieved the spirit go back in your mind he said what did I start doing neglecting church that's what he says question mark neglecting church he said did I start picking on this one or doing this to my neighbor if you did that's what sapped it out so I would say tonight if if we could really get serious about getting the presence of God back in our church again and creating an atmosphere an atmosphere of worship for our young people I think that we can see God come right down here in our local assembly and fill young people with the Holy Ghost fill some of our elders with the Holy Ghost and you wouldn't see people sitting out of church for no reason you wouldn't see young people backsliding so easily but what you would see is Sons and Daughters of God being made manifest right here Among Us what is it we've got to get serious about this thing if you want to see the these young people stay in church but what if we're just going to play church as parents what do you expect our young people to do if we just going to well come on somebody you want to see your young people filled with the Holy Ghost let's create an atmosphere for them to receive the Holy Ghost in well they we can just send them to Youth Camp yes sir but what about right here on a Sunday morning and a Sunday afternoon and a Wednesday night I say it's time that as parents and as as Elders here in the church and as Believers in this message of the hour it's time we stand up take responsibility for a service that may go wrong no we don't want to just mail it in on a Wednesday night or mail it in on a Sunday night but let's get up here and give everything we've got to the spirit of God and give way for Liberty in the services right here in our home Church see we don't have to wait for Youth Camp I'm thankful for Youth Camp I'm thankful to see these young people moved by the spirit of God you say why don't they get moved in church maybe because we haven't created an atmosphere for them to be moved by yet amen come on well come on somebody I think it's time we get ourselves out of the way and let's put our young people ahead of ourselves let's get our preconceived notions out of the way let's get our little complexes out of the way let's get our anxieties out of the way and let our young people have a right to the freedom of this of serving God again come on pre the problem is we've carried so much baggage with us from Egypt and we've went back and we' started taking so much baggage over and we we just you got to lay it down Church you got to get rid of it there's no you know what if you start living like you've been an abused person then you'll start abusing your children the same way you were you've got to lay that down and let that child have a chance at Freedom let the child have a chance why because we don't want to carry over I I don't want to act like my parents did but by living in the past to what my mom or what my dad did I love my mom Sorry by by living in the past and say well my dad was this way and my dad was this way if I live on that all the time then my children are going to suffer for what my dad did and the sins of the generations will continue to visit but it takes the Holy Ghost to break that cycle and you say well why do we need our children to get the Holy Ghost because we don't want them to be like we were we don't want them to be like our parents was I don't care how good they were before they were Holy Ghost filled Christians I don't want my children to be like that I want my children to have a at Freedom I want them in an atmosphere of Liberty where Christ can be revealed to them personally how do we do that he said did you ever notice he said you see people nice people he said but you just couldn't hardly stand to be around them he said nice people it's their atmosphere that they're in you know you can't stand to be around people that have been in a bad atmosphere because they have actually created the atmosphere that they're in that's right and he said now he said now you've seen other people he said and you just long to be with him is that right he said it's that atmosphere that's around them all the time he said now my wife sitting back there she don't know this but and he tells this story I Tred to skip through it for time's sake he he said she was going in and he said people coming and going and making the house just in chaos and and he said not even a chance to cook and the children could just anything to eat through the day and there was I mean it was just chaos there at the house and he said uh he said little kitty there little girl about 2 years old little Sarah and Rebecca and they're they're in there and they're crying and and they're going on and my wife crying and she' look up and she said Bill I'm just about to go crazy y'all been there before this a prophet's wife and a prophet's home and it just got bad it just got there were so many people around they just couldn't have a good time they they just couldn't get in the right atmosphere and he said but he tells you how to deal with it this is what I like he said and there he said my wife crying and Bill I'm about to go crazy I don't know what I'm going to do she said I I'm gray-headed at 34 years old I'm just a few years behind and said honey and he said I never he said don't fuss at her come on husbands don't fuss at her man it got quiet don't fuss at her if your wife's having a bad day don't fuss at her that's just going to make it worse if your husband's have a bad having a bad day don't nag at him it's going to make it worse it it's up to you to create the atmosphere in your home and the atmosphere you create around your wife or your spouse affects your children yes it does and it actually you can have a more positive effect at home on your children than you can even at church if it's a good atmosphere but the problem is we've got too many people living like Christians here and going home and living like the world we can't do that and expect our children to be holy ghost filled Christian kids and he said he said going on like that he said don't fuss at her he said that's right honey see it's very bad but we're serving the lord and he said what what I'm doing all the time he said in my heart I'm trying to create a different atmosphere he said they're all nervous and tore up see he said I was thinking in my heart oh Lord send your presence and your love to my poor little tore up wife well that's that's good that's a good recipe right there if you want to fix the marriage why don't you just send your presence and fix it is my home in chaos Lord send your presence and fix it this is what a prophet said I think it's something we should apply to our lives if we really want to have a home where the atmosphere is Pleasant oh thank you Lord he said and he said oh we haven't had anything to eat and she said well we haven't had anything to eat and say well there probably won't be anybody else for the next couple hours let's get something to eat and I'll help you and I'll start getting up my sleeves and she said now look young man you might be able to help me with dishes but you can't cook and he said I'll say well who can't cook like that you know just going on well you haven't ever seen me fried potatoes yet I was raised on them something like that he said just see a little bitty smile trickle on her face you see what you say is important that's right what you what you do in your home is important for how your kids are going to turn out how you respond in church is important for how your kids are going to turn out if you're always mad at the pastor because he's preaching against sin it's not the pastor you need to get mad at it's the sin in your life you need to get mad at if you're always getting mad at the pastor because you're missing church and he's preaching about going to church well the way to get rid of that condemnation is start going to church and you won't feel bad no more well can you say praise the Lord little bitty smile trickle he said well I come over here and I put my hand on her and she don't know what I'm doing yet he said Oh my he said and then I he said he said bless your heart honey there's my quote from I bless your heart he said I'll help you do this and then down in my heart I'm saying Lord send me peace your peace that's in my yes and me into her now oh God quiet my family and he goes on down here he said what is it it's creating an atmosphere he said brother let me tell you Brothers the atmosphere is what does it it's exactly right look it's not the hen that Hatches the Egg it's the atmosphere he said you put that same egg under a pup and it would hatch in the incubator it would hatch uh put it under any chicken it'll hatch you can put an eagle egg he taught us under a chicken it'll still hatch an eagle so the home you but but youve got to get an atmosphere there where they can at least be born you got to get them to church where they can at least be born and then how you raise them I I believe they'll find that mother eagle flying over the Barnyard but let's get these kids born let's get these kids the Holy Ghost where they'll have something to hold them and something to fall back on and I would like to say this I wonder if us as parents could check up on our own life and say do I have the Holy Ghost oh come on pre we want our kids to get the Holy Ghost but what about me what about our parents what about well come on somebody I know that's a that's a that's a hard subject to think about but it's one thing to want your kids to be saved and filled with the Holy Ghost but what about me how am I ever going to have the faith for my children if I'm not even sure I'm saved how am I going to have faith for my kids to receive the Holy Ghost if I still question whether I have it or not how am I going well come on somebody you know it's the truth you sat there and you question your own salvation and you have your own little pity parties there at home and you're like well I just don't want to take my kids to church today cuz I don't feel like it forget your feelings and get the kids to church come on preach well for the sake of the kids come on let's do what they need to do let's do what's best for them let's get in obedience to the word for the sake of our children do you realize if there's a tomorrow that our children are either going to be out here on the streets running drugs and and living like the world or they're going to be sitting here in the house of God worshiping and it's up to you to determine a lot of what they do that's right come on it's the truth you know we can play Church all we want to we can come and act religious on Sunday mornings all we want to but are we living a life in front of that kid say I want to be like them I'm with him I'm with her I want to be like them are are we living that kind of life or are we just bringing our kids because well that's my duty now no let's get on fire for God as parents and then we can watch our children get on fire too yes sir not to call you out but I watched sister Stephanie come back to the Lord did you know that if she wouldn't have come back to the Lord Brother the trip may not be sitting here today come on preach well let's just get real for a minute if I'm not coming to church my kids probably ain't coming to church if you're not in church your kids ain't in church who's it hurting your kids right preach come on well I can be just as good of a Christian no you can't come on a prophet told you you cannot be as good of a Christian and stay home as you can church now I don't know if that's one time a week two times a week three times or once a year I don't know but I'm just going to take what he said and go every time the doors are open if I can possibly be there let me be at what did David say one thing if I long for that I may dwell in the house of the Lord and inquire in his Temple that's what I want to do that's the desire of my heart and if that is not the desire of your heart then church it's time that you receive the Holy Ghost because the holy ghost will cause you to obey the word of God oh yes well all right come on trip said You Preach at my parents and he said I'll back you you know what I I I love to see our kids on fire for the Lord but I do wonder sometimes what about us oh help us Lord you know kids can get tenderhearted and they get in the presence of the Lord and it's just easy it seems like standing in that prayer line I watch these kids and you probably wouldn't believe it what they act like you can call them babies you can call them whatever well they just don't know yet I'm going to just tell you what it is it's a spirit of the Lord dealing with a tender heart and I think that as an adult it would do us good if we just have a tender heart again Lord create in me a clean heart restore unto me the joy of my salvation I'm not trying to make you Pentecostal I'm not trying to make you run and shout all the time but I'm here to tell you if you're not happy sitting in the house of God you need the joy of your salvation back if you're not able to respond to the word of God and the house of God then you need a refilling of the Holy Ghost at least parents we can't our kids probably can't live much higher than we are so it is our responsibility to get those kids here and to create an atmosphere in the home where they're going to school and if you have to send them to public school pray for them children yes sir pray before they go you may have to pray when they get home it's a dark world let's do what we can to get our children saved before it's too late come on well I got faith for them they're going to be there cuz my they're my kids no I believe that but they have to have an experience just like you did that's right now I'm going to believe that every one of these kids will and I believe every one of them here will and you got to believe that for your children don't ever doubt believe your children are going to have that experience but they've got to have that experience to be in this bride they've got to be a holy ghost filed Christian but Jesus said you must be born again and I've watched some children over the weekend get born again and I say it's time if you haven't been as an adult get born again where we can see a church on fire where we can see our young people on fire where you can worship without restrictions there was a testimony said chains were falling well I think there's some adults here today that need to see some chains falling today we need to get back to our first love and realize that God is not here to bind you but he's here to set you free he's here to give freedom of worship he's here to give freedom to our young people well come on somebody you can sit there and look at me but let me just goad and tell you like this them young people worshiped God last week but if they're looking at our elders and there's nothing there but just a dead form of godliness then what do you expect them to turn out to be come on well come on it's me I've got to do better yes sir come on I've got to do better I've got to look in the mirror and say how am I going to how am I going to act in church today not just to put on but am I going to worship with everything I got preach come on come on that's what you got to do well we're not trying to teach our kids to be Pentecostals no but they need to know that when they come here they can have freedom to come and kneel down at an altar they can have freedom to raise their hands they can have freedom to dance if they got to they can have freedom to move in the spirit any way the spirit moves them that's what we need we don't need anybody we don't need our kids scared to death to raise their hands in church we don't need the kids scared to death to receive the Holy Ghost because they might fall out in the spirit I say let them fall out in the spirit I say let the Holy Ghost back in the church again and put your foot on the head of that devil that's trying to hold you back that starts at the top and goes all the way down that's starts with the parents and works right down into the families if your life is filled with nothing but TV and movies come on preach well I don't have TV well you know Lord help me if you watch more TVs than you do read your Bible then there's a problem in your home your priorities are messed up come on preach is that all right or is that just me what you're feeding on what you're feeding on yeah is what you become that's right and we'll leave it at that come on preach the Lord knows that every one of us have got some checking up to do oh yes but when you get to feeling like well it's all about me and how I how I feel and I don't want to go to church and I don't want to do this would you please think of the kids come on come on why are you so stirred up brother the Joel cuz I went to a camp and I saw kids that were free to worship I don't want to see him bound at home come on preach yeah come on preach that's right I don't want to see bondage in our young people come on come on I I'll take up for them a little bit these kids are fighting Devils that some of you Elders have never fought before that's right come on prach come on I fought devils and I thought I'd fought them all these kids I hear things in prayer lines that I I don't even know about yeah come on there's a whole another generation a whole another age group that's rising up that are fighting things that I don't even understand yeah come on preach come on give our give our give our parents some gra give our kids some Grace let let our kids get in an atmosphere of Freedom oh yeah let well come on somebody let our kids recognize the presence of God for themselves it's going to take more than your rules and regulation at home to get them saved it's going to take an atmosphere of freedom in the house of God it's going to take a home that's dedicated to the word of God it's going to take a home where the parents are not always fussing at one another it's going to take a home where the spirit of God's got to move upon it and create Sons and Daughters of God absolutely that's what we need well you're yelling at me tonight no listen listen this what a prophet said come on bu he said well he said they he said they went up there and W aord he said they went up in the upper room oh yeah he said they was thanking God for the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost had never come yet but they had it in seed form oh yeah maybe some of you just got it in seed form but you're here waiting on it to come to maturity he said well he said uh brother Brandon we'd like to try to see if an acorn would grow down here in our backyard he said I'd give you an acorn and I'm going to put it in the right kind of soil just like you got up north and I'm going to see if it'll grow and put it in this Acorn I give he said brother brandom you said that You' give me an acorn tree I said well I did I gave you the acorn he said now you've got the tree oh yeah it's in seed form is that right he said you've got the tree already it's in seed form and Acts 2 verse one says and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord in one place now there's where we need to be yeah come on Church how do you you want to you know why you know why Youth Camp is so effective because a majority of them kids are seeking the baptism of the Holy Ghost they're there for a purpose now I you can say I I'd say 90% I think brother Ben told me this too 90% of them kids come to that prayer line are not coming through for healing they're not coming through for they're coming through for the Holy Ghost they need the Holy Ghost and they recognize they need the Holy Ghost that's the first step let let's get them to recognize it but in verse two and suddenly they were all in one Accord and suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as of a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting that's what I want to see for our young people when you come here and and we got young people sitting here on the on the front row I don't care if they're five six 7 8 10 11 12 however young they are they can receive the Holy Ghost oh yeah they they can receive it but we need to create an atmosphere while we're here to say you know what if there's children here to receive the Holy Ghost let's make it a service where they can receive the holy ghost that seems simple enough let's not just give a our second best when we come to the house of God either God is everything to me and he is first place in my life or he is nothing at all yeah come on preach well I'll give him second place he'll take what you give him but don't expect your kids right to be saved like that come on got quiet but I'm GNA tell you if you live like the world come on your kids are probably going to live like the world if you put uh uh let me if sports are a priority over church when your kid grows up Sports will be a priority over Church come on try is that fair enough I I if anything is put before church when that child grows up in that condition who's to blame come on preach it's the parent now brother bam talks about parent delinquents now I'm not trying to hurt you and scold you I'm the youngest parent one of the youngest parents here you all have done way better job and and raised kids for a lot longer than I have but I think we have enough message to show us that we have got to stay with the word and keep Christ in the center of our life or else we're not we don't have a chance this is an age of Darkness it's only going to get worse it's an age of insanity and the only way your children have a chance is to keep them in the presence of God oh help us he said he said' what was it he said they all got in one Accord one place there was a bless they were blessing God for the Holy Ghost which had never come yet but they believe that it was because God was going to keep his promise how many's got a promise here of the Holy Ghost how many's been baptized then you have a promise of the Holy Ghost and if you don't have it I encourage you to seek the Holy Ghost with all your heart get somewhere and say Lord I'm not going to leave until I've got it let's not play games with the Holy Ghost but let's get the Holy Ghost let's not go be like well I don't have it but when it comes I'll get it no you need to be earnestly contending for the Holy Ghost you need to be on your hands and knees day and night don't let nothing hinder you from getting the Holy Ghost if it's a promise you know you can get it now it's time to get it come on he said you see he said he said there come a rushing Mighty Wind that filled all the house he said see the atmosphere got right oh yeah the atmosphere has got to be right for that Holy Ghost to sweep over the congregation we don't need no fussing Among Us or fighting Among Us or or somebody coming in with an odd against another brother or you come in and say well I don't like this one or I don't like that one let's come together in love believing that our children can receive the Holy Ghost and if I need a refilling of the Holy Ghost or you need a refilling of the Holy Ghost every service is an opportunity for you to receive that you don't have to wait for the meetings in July you don't have to wait for your your favorite preacher to come through you don't have to wait for a camp meeting or a youth camp I want to see an atmosphere here where our youth can come to this Altar and cry their way through I'm not talking about no dryed confession I'm talking about a real experience with the Holy Ghost it might make you slobber a little bit it might make you cry it might make you act like a fool to the world but it'll do you good come on we get so scared of the moving of God that we call everything fanaticism and everything is just we're so scared of it that we think it's going to cause emotionalism in the church God forbid that we turn out like the old uh the oldtime churches that sit there and said word only we don't need no more spirit I I don't think we need that I believe in the word I believe the word if it's preached in the power and demonstration will create an atmosphere where people can be born again I think the word is what we need but let's put the word in action I've been a part of people that put the word and they say well here's the word here's the word here's the word and they had no Spirit to go with it why because they were taking what they wanted of the word and pushing what they wanted to the word but we have the full revealed Vindicated word and all we have to do is realize that he is here oh thank you brother Bram said his ministry was to declare he is here oh and if he is here then you can receive the Holy Ghost oh yeah you elderly people receive the Holy Ghost you young people can receive the Holy Ghost I can receive a I'll tell you what there's many people in here today say well I receive the Holy Ghost 20 years ago 30 years ago but have you been refilled with the Holy Ghost lately brother R said there's one filling but there's many refilling well I'll tell you today I think every one of us parents need to check up do I need a refilling I say yes Lord I need a refilling of the Holy Ghost I would say if there was an honest parent in the building you would say I need to refilling with the Holy Ghost well well maybe it's just me but I think every one of us parents need to realize if these children if they stand a chance and lay to see it we got to be holy ghost filled Holy Ghost L parents oh yes they can go to youth camp and get the Holy Ghost but why not let them get it right here oh yeah why not give everything we've got to every service why make them wait till next year or the year after or 10 years or why not why not tonight why not now why can't we let our young people have an experience with God you say well I had an experience well why don't we let them have an experience how do I do that brother Joel well I think we could have a whole lot more encouragement and a little less discouragement yeah how do I encourage in the house of God by actually showing up come on that's your first start it's a start if you ain't here the kids ain't here brother B said don't send your kids to Sunday school said take them yeah right that's what he said come on I know a prophet that may be too hard for some people but that's what a prophet said yeah that's what a prophet said sorry about all the people on spring break I'm not preaching at you come on preach when you can be in church and you set out it shows that you as a parent need the Holy Ghost come on preach well that's too hard brother Joel it's just the truth I'll tell you where I get it from Brother Bram said if God is in your heart yeah you can't wait for them doors to open out yonder now what is God the holy it's the Holy Ghost come on it's Christ in you making you live the word yeah that's right so I think every one of us I'm putting my hand up too every one of us need to check up say Lord what about me oh help us Lord what about me what am I doing to portray Christ to my kids what am I doing to get my kids in the presence of God yes I go to church but what about my home life is it where it needs to be just checking up here what about you what about me oh my brother Joel I this this is not preaching me as happy as I wanted well I I sometimes we just got to get real oh yeah sometimes we just need to know that God wants us to be his children he wants us to be happy he wants us to he wants us to live like children before him but you know with condemnation in your heart you can't do that with condemnation in your heart you can't create an atmosphere of worship that's right brother B said the atmosphere got right he said oh couldn't we get an atmosphere here that every crippled every blind every sick person everything with all with one Accord believing until the sick and he said he seen it in a meeting he said' I saw it in a meeting in Wood River where there wasn't one person left they just pulled up crutches and Wheelchairs and Cs and he said I was standing at the platform preaching like this and they just begin to raise up he said throw them to the corners and the atmosphere got right he said oh brother God send us an atmosphere here that'll make it of one Accord one place he said let the power get this part here he said let the power of God surge down here through this and that atmosphere gets right he said it moves back every clog and everything and the law of God will move oh come on somebody I think that's what we need again we don't need to get up here you know I I love the Deep preaching of the word and I think we need it I think it'll bring it it'll bring it'll bring good to the church and it'll help you grow and it'll feed you but I think sometimes we just need to get back to the altar again oh yeah do you need an altar experience if it's been a while I'd say it's time for an altar experience again I wonder how many's actually kneeled at an altar in this generation where they say we don't need altars anymore I think we still need altars in the churches I think we still need to see it can Soul still be saved then we need altars in the churches can can young people still get the Holy Ghost then we need an atmosphere in the church can older people still get a refilling of the Holy Ghost then we need an atmosphere in the church do we still need Christ in the church if there's still people here seeking Christ we need him in the church do we still need preachers he said how can they hear without a preacher if we need a preacher then we still need altars if we still need well come on somebody if we still need the word preached we still need the spirit to water it what we need is to get ourselves out of the way not just the preacher but every person in the congregation get yourselves out of the way I'll get myself out of the way and watch God move through the church again oh yeah oh gred Lord what we need is to let everything move that is clogged up and get back to where the flowing River of Life can come through this church and and wash out all the the dross and the ungodliness and the hate and the bitterness right you see what God can do for your life the Holy Ghost can take you from a bitter person to a loving person it can take you from a sick person and make you well again it can take you from a young person living a life of sin to a young person on fire for god well how do you know I'm watching it unfold before my very eyes I've watched young people that have never raised their hand in church raise their hand in church I've watched young people who have never seen Christ a tear in church they would almost have to be helped out of a prayer line why you say that's fanaticism I say it was the Holy Ghost moving on our young people and it's about time that we had some elderly people that would let the Holy Ghost move on them as well to where we can feel the power of God in our services again why it's not just to make me feel good or to make you feel good but it's to surrender yourself to the moving of the Holy Spirit well come on somebody what you're doing is sitting there saying well he's trying to to get an emotional Church worked up know what I'm trying to tell you is when you find your freedom there's none of that push back every time you start preaching about things that that brother brandom said when you start preaching about you know TVs in your home taking up too much time and brother brandom said we need to put the family altar back in it when you start getting pushed back from that you realize you got some folks that are still living in a chicken pin when the when the eagle is still screaming and trying to tell you come out of that come out excuse me come out of that mess come out of that ungodliness and live the message of the hour but what we got to do is you've got to get yourself in a position to believe and to do that you've got to get an atmosphere of Freedom yeah how is Christ revealed in the right atmosphere brother B talks about excuse me he said he said he Benjamin Benjamin Franklin he said here he said Benjamin Franklin went fishing with a kite he said well lightning run down the string and he caught it and he began to run holler I got it I got it I got it he had it but he didn't know what he had oh my that's the matter with our Pentecostal church he said you got it but but you don't know what you've got he said that's it that's right you've got power enough to Open the Eyes of the blind unstop the ears of the deaf do all the things but you come in with a twisted up atmosphere well let me read that again he said you've got power enough to Open the Eyes of the blind you've got power enough to unstop ears of the deaf and to do all things but you come in with a twisted up atmosphere he's saying that you can't get these things you can't use the power that you even have with a twisted up atmosphere I say let's get the atmosphere right to where the signs and wonders can be back in the church again amen he said he said but you come with a twisted up atmosphere he said let's get in one Accord so the Holy Spirit can pour out the gushers down upon the people one place in one Accord I'll purpose in my heart that I'll come and if there's anything I've got against my brother or sister I'm going to get it right at the door before I come in here and affect a service where our young people can't be healed saved and delivered I need to get right at the door you need to get right at the door oh yeah we got to make this place of Freedom where chains can fall we're not here to bind the people but we want to see people set free he said he'd sat with a cup of coffee and a sandwich all night long and he' try this one if the electris would or the electric wouldn't follow that wire he'd lay it aside and get him another one he'd try that until finally he found it and he gave the word electricity said now he goes on down here he said uh he said he was going up to happen or something he said these monsters something laying up there and the electricity is all around you and you could scream till you got horse and electricity electricity light up and show me how to get out of here and he said all this stuff and he said I know you're here electricity scientifically prove that you're here I know you're here so light up he said you could scream till you got horse and it would never light up why electricity will light he said light electricity will light if you'll follow the law of electricity that's right now he's he's trying to trying to make a point here and he says if you had a fountain over on this side of an artisian well gushing up and a crop run over on the other side burning up he said now you can say oh water go over there and irrigate my crop it won't do it he said but if you'll follow the laws of gravitation then it will do it you've got to have an atmosphere you've got to prepare a place for our young people to come and be filled with the Holy Ghost why is that because you have to get all the unbelief out of your life you have to come in here that's why you have to repent before your B baptized to receive the Holy Ghost if you go down a center you come up a wet Center a dry Center you come up a wet Center what is it because you've got to follow the word of God and the way he said it but what it is the Holy Ghost is not going to come in to an unclean vessel but what the young people realized was they could sit there and they could repent of their sins and they could receive the Holy Ghost and they were in an atmosphere where it would come and they didn't feel condemnation for shouting and screaming and crying and they shouldn't feel it here either because what we need is to create a place to where they can come and they can feel the presence of God with a prayed up parent and a prayed up grandparent well come on somebody and pray up preachers and pray up song leaders and pray up deacons pray up and get the channel right to where our young people can have a chance at receiving the Holy Ghost but see it's got to get right here before the spirit can come in he said you can have the water flowing here but you have a crop drying you could have a crop over here a crop you could have a real seed over here you could have the corn growing but it's about to burn up why cuz the water can't get to it well let's quit holding it up let's unclog the channels let's Let the Fire of the Holy Ghost move in our church again come on let's not hold it back let's let God be God when he wants to move in the church and and anoint our young people with an anointing and I tell you what if they run and scream let them run and scream you've had your Revival let them have their Revival let them feel the Holy Ghost move again I say it's time you know what if they saw us doing it maybe they wouldn't feel so bad about doing it but I tell you when you know it's the real spirit of God they'll break through that and they don't care if you sit there and laugh at them they're going to run anyway they didn't care what people thought of them over there in that prayer line they went through their receive the Holy Ghost and they could care less if you laughed at them come on they could care less if you called them crazy and fanatical I can I you know what I care I can care less what people think about preaching the message of the hour I I'm not here to preach a Baptist sermon to you I'm not here to tell you it's okay to live like the devil and just go to church I'm here to tell you if you get the Holy Ghost like they got you'll act like they did come on yes brother bam said he said he said uh he said by he said how could a street Harlot a f a few weeks ago and a lady this after be a lady this afternoon by the transforming power of God being transmitted by the Holy Ghost into your heart changed your nature changed your thinking oh thank you Lord changed your making I like that you're not even made the same way your family history don't even matter no more well anxiety runs in the family cut that devil off with the Holy Ghost this disease of cancer runs in the family cut that devil off with the Holy Ghost it don't have to run in my family it don't have to run in my home well my family were a bunch of drunkers it don't have to be me it don't have to be you well my my dad was addicted to all kinds of nonsense on the internet it don't have to be you young people my mama was this way or my daddy was this way it don't have to be you because the Holy Ghost changes your making it changes the way you are it changes oh on I said it changes you and makes you a new creature it makes you act different it makes you talk different you don't go around cussing people out and getting all high tempered at the people and walking out of church and acting like I tell you what I think we need more people I don't care your age I don't care how much money you got or don't have I need I think we need more people people at an altar again crying out for a refilling of the Holy Ghost to where the Holy Ghost can run through this church in such a way that there could be nothing to stop our young people from experiencing other camp meeting fire just like they did last weekend it don't have to be a camp young people don't get the feeling like you're can only shout there I say take your Liberty right here in the house of God well I need permission no you don't need no permission if the spirit moves you move with the spirit if the word is being preached and you enjoy it and it stirs something up in your heart you can stand up and say Amen if something is moving on the inside you don't have to worry about who's not standing or who's not clapping or who's not saying amen I don't worry about the dead heads around me I say preach the word of God and let the anointed seat of God respond to the word of God hallelujah not to quote brother Ron Spencer but we ' had too many ice maker preachers producing ice cubes all over the church come on what we need come on is to get back to the word again oh yeah that says let's give God thanks for it's here anyhow oh yeah that's a quote in the message expectation just think about the title first when you come into church he said he said it changed the way you are it changed your making he said you might not have felt it I don't know about that but it's here anyhow oh yeah whether you feel it I'll say it like he said it whether you fed it or not come on let's give God thanks for it for it's here anyhow why do we give God thanks for being here because he is hallelujah yall heard that enough to know he's here yes you give God thanks because he is here he's here who's here Christ showed up and where the spirit of the Lord is there is Li you go oh come on so we don't have to be bound when we come to church the spirit of the Lord has made me free and free indeed my time's up so I'm about to quit but I'll tell you this brother B said I've told a little story here he said there was a man sitting a hen and had an eagle egg under it and when that eagle hatched out it was the funniest looking bird that them chickens ever seen excuse me just got hot up here he said but he walked around he said it was he said he was the ugly one among them you ever feel that way amen nobody but me I really feel bad now thanks for the complex everybody else is goodlooking okay he was the ugly one I'm the eagle sorry chickens come on the eagle was the ugly one say praise the Lord for being ugly he said uh because he just couldn't understand how that hen will cluck and scratch on that manure pile and eat and couldn't get the idea yeah you just couldn't live like the world even though you wanted to right you know when before you had the Holy Ghost and you could do things that were just disgusting you could get on you young people know what I'm talking about this is nothing new you get on sites you shouldn't have got on you see things you should have never done but you did it and you move on you press towards the mark of the High Calling You repent of that and move forward don't even think about it don't go back to that let the Holy Ghost change you and forget about it it's not say well that's holding me back well just forget about it move on you say well you know how could I ever be a preacher like that well I I'll tell you what there there's preachers that have had that problem too yeah come on come on somebody come on all your Halos are about half burned out already might as well just go ahead and let them take them off really I think about it you can say well I've done this I quit looking to your past quit looking to what you did did you get the Holy Ghost it'll change you and make you new but this little ugly duckling or Eagle I was read a lot of bedtime stories as a child they wanted me to know what I was like this was you Joel with the ugly one he was the ugly one among them because he couldn't understand anyway she would say come on over and feast honey come on over here and eat this garbage yeah eat out of this you ever been in a chicken coop anybody oh yeah it's a it's a pretty nasty place and they eat in there you just throw the corn in on the ground and just let him eat right on top of the just like that just like that well praise the Lord and so they would cluck along and eat and the little Eagle just couldn't do it and didn't look right to him so one day his mam came hunting him and he would hear that hin cluck and he would try his best to cluck but he couldn't do it he tried to cheap like a chicken but he couldn't do it he was an eagle before you young people ever got the Holy Ghost to Camp there was a desire on the inside of you to get the Holy Ghost you were an eagle before you ever went to camp but you went over there and realized hey I don't have to be like that anymore oh thank you Lord one day his mommy flew flew over flew over and she screamed and he recognized it you recognized the call oh thank you Lord I I read this and I thought about camp now I'm just weird like that but that's the way it is it sounded right oh yes why he was an eagle to begin with that's the way it is with the gospel or the word or the power of Jesus Christ when a man has been predestinated to eternal life he hears that true scream of God and nothing can keep him from it the church might say days of Miracles has passed cluck cluck cluck stand here and eat this and stand here and eat that that barnyard stuff won't do for him anymore he is gone all things are possible he gets off the ground that's why that's the matter that's what's the matter with so many Christians today they can't get their feet off the ground the old mommy said Son jump you're an eagle come up here where I am and said Mom I never jumped in my life she said well you jump you're an eagle take that people that don't believe in jumping jump you're an eagle come on you might as well enjoy your freedom when you was in that chicken pin going to them ball games and acting like the world you jumped around and acted like a chicken and all kinds of Filth around you and you got to Youth Camp and you realized hey I can feel good in church too you can you can take your freedom you can take your freedom whenever the spirit of the Lord falls upon you when the spirit of the Lord comes upon you you can dance like David danced when the spirit of the Lord comes upon you you can sing when the spirit of the Lord comes on you you can shout when the spir well come on
