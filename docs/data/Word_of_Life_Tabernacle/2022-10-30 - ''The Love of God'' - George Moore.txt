this morning and to know that he's coming but he's here and it's good to have each and every one of you with us today and and uh brother Jeremy my sister Rebecca don't come you sit right up front that looks looks good he's sitting up there it's good to have all of you with us and uh you could have Paige back with us this morning the kids good to see you this morning and and all the visitors those that come with brother George this morning we're glad to have you and I won't call all of your names because I'll get them wrong but we appreciate you so much I I wanted to say about yesterday I um my brother Jonathan's here as well God bless you thank you for coming this weekend and we appreciate you being here and he just surprised me by showing up um I wanted to say about the pasture appreciation we need to have a congregational appreciation day because you all have just been extra special to us to me and my wife and so we thank you for that and from the bottom of our hearts we don't deserve uh what you have done for us and but we are here God has placed us here somehow and we thank you for all the gifts and and the expressions of kindness and uh you're the best and you just keep believing that the devil in this age he tries real hard to tell us that we're not going to make it we're not you're the best that God has that's why you're here this morning and and so we believe that today and we you're just over and above you've done over and above what we would expect in that area I want to thank those that helped with the uh with the uh Fall Festival that we just went through yesterday wasn't that a good time y'all have a good time yesterday amen I did too I did too and I I just just maybe worked out just how it should have and and even with the rain and stuff some of the kids just played right out in the rain I have expected not see some of them here this morning because of it but but then the rain stopped and we had a good time in the Lord so we we really enjoyed that and thank you sisters especially sister Vicki sister Brittany uh sister Allison Brandy had stepped in and helped and she just really was a big help yesterday and the deacons and all of you just just doing being in your place thank you for that and uh you should give yourself a hand for that God bless you we uh just a wonderful job I the church is such hospitality and I hear that all the time when we have a wedding or a festival like this we always open it up we it's for us but we try to open it up for people to come and the reason we do that is if we can be a blessing even in a small way even in a natural way to someone there were folks here yesterday several folks don't go to church at all or don't come here or don't go to a message church but we want to reach out to them too and that's one way we can do that so we want to continue to do that and I commend you for your attitude in that so we're going to do something a little bit different this morning if the musicians just stay here for just a minute but brother uh Joel has never been ordained as a minister so we're going to do that this morning and I think it worked out just right because I was supposed to do it last week and I forgot and because I'm just getting that way as I get older the older I get the more forgetful I get but but the Joel has not been ordained and come to our attention that brother Joshua sitting right there beside him has not been ordained either by the Joshua Kathy and these young men I'm so excited to see young men wanting to go into the ministry and not just wanting to but feeling the call of God to do that and and so we're thankful for that and and we've watched these young men's lives and and uh brother Joel's been here at the church for uh well he's been preaching here now for a little over a year and I can't say enough I teased him a lot but I can't say enough about the help there but the Joel is to me personally if you see us sitting here on the front we're in a meeting or something if I need something done all I gotta do is look at him and he knows usually what I want done and that what you can't pay for that I mean that's just wonderful and we've got other wonderful ministers as well here in the church and singers and we're thankful for that we want to do that this morning I want to read a scripture about that because we we're doing something that's a scriptural order and so you'll find you'll find Paul and he talks about it in Timothy and I actually didn't get the uh the scripture reference so that's not good but it's chapter four let me find it real quick and I told you I was getting forgetful but um it's first Timothy chapter four and uh he speaks to young men speaking to Timothy as a young man he said in the last days go to verse one if you can pull it up uh First Timothy chapter 4 and verse one it says in the latter days some shall depart from the faith and give heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils and it goes on to talk about the the doctrines that they would have and he says uh in verse 6 he says if thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things thou shall be a good Minister that word Minister means servant so that's what we are as ministers as servants so we're ordaining more servants for the bride of Christ today we're just giving them the right hand to fellowship and so you'll be a good minister of Jesus Christ nourished up in the words of faith and of good Doctrine wherein to thou Hast detained he said but refuse profane and old wives Fables and uh exercised thyself rather unto godliness and then in verse 11 he said these things command and teach so he tells ministers to preach to teach and and then in verse 12 he said let no man despise thy youth but be thou an example of the Believers in word in conversation or lifestyle in charity that's love in spirit and faith in Purity he said till I come give attendance to reading to exhortation to Doctrine neglect not the gift that is in thee which was given thee by Prophecy with laying on of hands of the Presbytery the gift wasn't given by laying on of hands but the laying on of hands sanctioned the gift that was there he said meditate upon these things give thyselfs holy to them holy to them that thy profiting may appear to all take heed unto yourself and unto the doctrine continuing them for in doing this I love this this Thou shalt both save thyself and them that hear thee hey man that's good isn't it I believe we ought to applaud the work so brother Brandon taught us that gifts and callings are without repentance and he said they noticed that Timothy was a staunch Christian had a gift of speaking he said they laid hands on him as a recognition the Elders of the church laid hands upon him uh and placing the apostolic Ministry of laying hands on him that he would go to preach the gospel sent out by witness to these Brethren that they believed the gift of God was working in him and he said it was a sanction and so that's what we're going to do this morning Brothers if you would come ministering Brothers if you come and we'll gather here at the front and brother Joel and brother Joshua and uh we'll ask the congregation to pray with us and we'll just give these brothers the right hand to fellowship and believe that the Lord will will help them in their Ministries and my I want them to exceed and just be if God calls them as evangelists or pastors whatever it is to go far beyond what my generation I'm almost in another generation now but far beyond what my generation is able to do I want them to do better and and to see the bride of Christ come to full maturity under the ministries of men like these young men let's let's lay hands on these brothers and pray grateful today for your Mercy o God we're so thankful Lord that you would call young men young men your ministry hard what a privilege it is a privilege it is to come Lord and have hands laid in our heart and sanction of these gifts that are within and let's pray God give them the right hand of the fellowship today I pray you'd move in their Ministries I pray there'd be a anointing come on O Lord for this moment on or that they'd never be afraid to preach your word that they would stay right with it that they would never go to the left of the right they would preach the message of the hour with all fervancy Lord and of spirit and everything that they have give themselves only or to study into worship Lord and to prayer oh God I pray you bless their families Lord bless their wives or their children oh God that you would give them I pray you to help them Lord that you build an edge of protection round the battle or that they'd be protected from evils we know that you're able to do it and you will promise you since you trust you today we ask in Jesus name that you would do it amen and God bless you Brothers we love you God bless you love you buddy love you guys amen amen what a privilege it is to see young men wanting to preach the gospel and having the call to do that and we want that to continue on just like we want to have church until the coming of the lord we want to see ministers continue to go in the field brother Branham taught us to do that he said continue in the field until the coming of the Lord amen do you love the Lord this morning amen let's stand together let's stand together I worship you almighty God there's none like you oh my aren't you glad to be able to come to the word this morning with an open heart say Lord if there's anything in me that needs correction bring it to me Lord if there's any need of healing or I need maybe of of Salvation in someone's heart he's able to do that this morning whatever you have need of he's able to make to meet that need tonight and we believe it amen amen let's let's sing this together as brother George comes we worship Him oh my see God there is [Music] a peace [Music] oh for you are my right just oh yes yes I were almighty God there is nothing like you sing it now's brother George comes there's none like you oh there is no like [Music] oh foreign [Music] amen so good to be here in the house Lord while we're all standing let's just turning their Bibles to the Book of Romans the fifth chapter and how many of you had a wonderful time at the fall party yesterday amen just a just a real blessing to be here and certainly enjoyed it I've seen a bunch of tired kids at my uh hotel last night everybody slept pretty good after all that running around yesterday so we certainly enjoyed our time and I I can't thank all the sisters enough that fix up I was a little upset sister Sharon made some stuff yesterday and by the time I found out I it's all gone and uh so maybe I don't know did you make anything else just sharing today nothing okay well maybe next time dude um but uh certainly enjoyed the good food and and uh appreciate everybody that pitched in there that's a lot of work and uh I think a lot of people maybe take that for granted you know you're able to show up and enjoy it and then and then leave you know everybody gets that uh everybody gets that kind of sixth sense right before cleanup time brother Ben and says well it's about time to go home you know and and uh there's always just that that group of of saints that just get it taken care of and get everything cleaned up and and then get it all put out and my I appreciate that and so uh it takes that to make a church work and and uh so I I appreciate it when I see it and and I know what kind of sacrifice that is and and thank you is is and God bless you for that is my prayer so Romans the fifth chapter the first 10 verses uh we'll read Romans the fifth chapter the first 10 verses therefore being justified by faith how are we Justified Saints by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom we also have access by faith into his grace wherein we stand and rejoice in the hope of the glory of God I just want to stop here and say this the the Bible said here that that we have by faith we have access to his grace and that because we have access to his grace we Rejoice amen we Rejoice is that right Saints we're happy today amen we're happy to be a believer today is that is that your prayer today is that your is that your I'm happy you know sometimes we get so you know you just sometimes there's Believers that just seem to be so miserable States just some of the most miserable people you ever been around but but that's not us I don't know how you can have the hope of joy in your heart and be miserable amen we should be the happiest people in the world Amen so you know when you come into church let's smile a little bit amen let's let's uh let's let's be happy amen and so and I appreciate it I was watching yesterday and everybody at the at the Gathering just let's watch everybody interact with one another and and just the overall how happy everybody was to be there and happy to be around brothers and sisters of Life precious Faith that's the holy ghost in the church Saint Paul is that amen and so we find then that uh I can't read the scripture for preaching and not only so but we glory in Tribulation also knowing that tribulation that worketh patience let me stop again and say this you don't have an excuse because you're going through something to be irritable or mean or or have a tough thing you know you're having a tough time and you're having a bad day it don't give you an excuse to treat nobody says we glory in a tribulation also amen so whether you're having a good day or a bad day or everything's going great or everything's going wrong we still glory in it amen because it all works together for the good of those that love the Lord and so and so if we're having a bad day that's fine you'll have a bad they don't bring it into the house of God we come in here to glory amen so so you leave all of that other stuff alone and when you and you know you're having a bad day don't give your excuse to talk to your wife bad or or or talk to your kids bad or or talk to your family bad or you're having a bad day that hey we're going to have bad days but we we glory in those things Saints because they're working together for our good I still can't read the scripture for preaching and I hope and make knowledge excuse me and uh knowing the tribulation work with patients and patience experience and experience hope and hope make it not a shame because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us so again the Holy Ghost when you see people that are miserable in the message or you see people that are unhappy to they're just living such a a a run-down kind of Life Saints it's because of the Holy Ghost and and so so if you think about this the only way you can live this message is by the Holy Ghost so if you're trying to live a message like this without the Holy Ghost you are miserable amen because you still got desires you still got things that's bothering you you still got things pulling at you and things pulling you down and you're miserable because you know what you should be and you know what you actually are amen and it takes the Holy Ghost not that you can't live it but to live through you is that right amen so if you see people really miserable it's because they're they want to live a certain way but they know they can't but it takes the Holy Ghost to live through us all right I'm gonna get through this for when we were yet without Strength In Due Time Christ died for the ungodly for scarcely a righteous man will one die yet pre-adventure for a good man some would even Dare To Die but God commanded his love toward us and that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us much more than being now justified by his blood we shall be saved from wrath through him for if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his son much more being reconciled we shall be saved by his life just bow our heads Heavenly Father we thank you so much for this word today Lord we thank you Lord that while we were unlovable you loved us while we were unsavable you saved us Lord you glorify yourself in US Lord although there be nothing in us to get Glory from lord it's a miracle that we're here today Lord our lives are a miracle Lord the fact that we are here today saved and filled with the Holy Ghost and believe in the message of the hour it's a miracle Lord but Lord you did it all for us we thank you for that Lord we we praise you for that Lord Jesus and Lord we just ask you that you'd watch over us this morning bless these precious Saints today Lord I ask you to help me today Lord I'm insufficient and Lord I am just a man and Lord but you have a way of moving man out of the way and speaking through I pray oh God you'd use me today Lord watch over me and bind my lips before I'd speak anything unpleasing to you and we committed into your hands in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen and y'all can finally be seated and I uh I just want to talk this morning on a very simple subject I would title this the love of God the love of God a very simple subject brother George you drove six hours over here to talk to this church a mature Church a church of Believers about the love of God actually I did not I I come to talk to you about something else but this is what the lord gave me so I I've learned enough over the years to do what the Lord tells me to do amen so I feel like if if the lord gave me this to speak then I feel like someone needs to hear it this morning so I'm just trusting him and trusting his grace and his mercy and and so I'm thankful to be here with you this morning I I just want to talk just to these two little uh young Brothers over here minister brothers and I'm thankful for young men that have a desire to pack this message and and um you know it's it's a kind of a rare thing you don't see a whole lot of of Brothers it seems like entering the ministry uh these days but I'm I'm thankful to see these two brothers I know them both personally and uh although I do give them a lot of grief that's why brother Ben asked me to come in oh yeah I I do know them to be men of God and uh I I know their hearts are in the right place and that God is using them and there's definitely gift there that that God is sanctioning so I'm so so happy to have been here and been able to see that I'm turning on my timer here because I know everybody's uh had a busy day yesterday and I'm not going to be too long this morning Lord willing so um but uh I'm so thankful for that I also usually when I come over I I just make a note in my notes to say something mean about brother Joel and so uh but this morning I got a problem my son-in-law there with him I don't have to divide my time up about picking on them two brothers there but uh how many of you appreciate brother Joel I know I know we do amen a minute amen I uh I know he gets I know he gets a lot of grief and he deserves it he deserves it uh but uh certainly proud of the man he's uh he's becoming so I I I I love to see it so Romans the fifth chapter there so I find in the message Saints as I talk about the love of God uh I find in the message a lot of times people don't necessarily believe in God's love as much as they believe in God's judgment and and so people have a real tendency to when something happens to them or they get wronged in some kind of way or somebody says something about them or or they feel like they've been shunned or they feel like they've been they feel like they've been targeted in some kind of way people have a real tendency to lean into God's judgment and and wanting God to judge the the person for the for the sins that they may or may not have committed and and you know it's easy in a church to to have feelings crop up and have people to to you know start feeling a certain way and and you know we deal with complexes as Believers to where you know you don't you can have a complex Saints and you don't even really know you got a complex it just it's part of you and and you don't recognize that it's part of you and and you know sometimes you act a certain way and maybe afterwards you would ask yourself why did I act that way what what is that what caused me to do that well these are just complexes would you just people here Saints we we're just brothers and sisters that's doing the best we can to serve the Lord and so you know we find it complexes and and little things come in and and sometimes things crop up and and when they do and we feel like we're in the rights we feel like we ain't done nothing wrong we're in the right and we always feel like we're in the right ain't everybody had nobody come to me and say brother George I tell you uh uh when I said that out of spite and I was mean about it and I meant to do it everybody you know when they tell a story they always tell it from the standpoint it makes their self look good is that right brother being I'm not gonna tell it to make myself look bad I'm gonna tell you how it makes me look good and so and so you know there's always my my dad always said there's three sides to every story there was your side and my side and then it was the truth amen which is right there in the middle somewhere that and and so you know people people get these little things and we want judgments when stuff happens we want we want judgment when we see things in the message that we don't like we want judgment when we see people wrong us and do things wrong but we want Mercy when we mess up so we want judgment for everybody else but we want Mercy for ourself amen and we want we want we want God to forgive us where we fall short we want God to forgive us when we do wrong but we want him to judge everybody else when they do something wrong foreign so if we'll be honest with ourselves Saints I think as Believers a good portion of Believers feel like if you just be honest we feel like God is angry with us a lot of times [Music] we feel like that the Lord is displeased with us a lot of times and our overall concept of God is that he is displeased with us and that's because of how we are with our nature we're fighting through this sinful nature that we were born into you know and we we have struggles and we have you know bad thoughts and we have things come across our mind that we know we shouldn't have and we have tests that we know we should be able to pass and sometimes we do sometimes we don't and when we don't we feel like the Lord is angry with us Brother David we feel like God is going he's angry with us and and so then when bad things happen to us we feel like we deserve it because it's God trying to punish us for our actions come on somebody and we feel like we deserve to be treated uh badly by the Lord but but brothers and sisters don't don't don't feel that way Saints but look brother Branham went through that brother Brown said and I got the quote there he said look how I feel like I feel I always thought that God was angry with him that Christ loved me and God was angry with me but Christ loved me he said but I find out that Christ was the very heart of God amen amen God loved you that's why he gave us Christ Amen in the very heart of God and so and so we find then that that God you know what when you say oh I bet if the Lord's disappointed maybe he is I bet he's angry women for my faults and failures I bet he's disgusted with me for how short I live of the glory of God or enraged that I live so far below my privileges Saints I'm here to tell you that God loves us [Music] amen and he's not a God that that punishes us like we deserve he's full of grace and mercy now I'm not trying to I'm not trying to be a Baptist church this morning come on hey man we gotta live a life right I mean you know if you're so you're going to reap or those things all are it's not just a free-for-all here amen but I think because we try to live so close to God that the devil tries to use that against us and make us think we're never going to measure up come on amen and we feel like that we deserve bad things to happen to us now I'm just I'm just trying to speak to you this morning I I I'm just trying to be honest now we might you might not ever you might not ever uh admit that you know I'm not saying you would but but if something bad happened to you say well I deserve that yeah sure is that right that's just the Lord's way punishing me for what I've done and how I've been yeah amen now brother Brown says this he said if you ever notice how that when disaster struck job's home and the children was all killed and everything and all job had was destroyed God wasn't rebuking job he only purged he was only purging job all right amen he was the only purging Joe brother Branham said amen he says I like that word a purge the branch that bears fruit then God purges it it'll bring forth more fruits [Music] the trouble of it is we think sometimes God is angry with us but he's only trying to purge us that will bring abundance of fruits giving us a few trials the Bible said that they're worth more to you than precious gold so so Brothers said that God isn't angry with you God is purging you he said we feel like God is angry with us but these trials he said if you if you if you take all the fruit off the branch it'll bring forth more fruits because it's been purged amen it's your amen so we find then that Michelangelo you know brother Bram talks about that sculpture of Moses that he made it and he made the sculpture of David I believe and several other sculptures and and they asked him they said Mike I think it was with I think it was with Moses they asked Michelangelo they said how in the world did you ever take that raw slab of marble and and make a statue of Moses out of it and Michelangelo's answer was very simple he said he said I simply chipped away everything in that slab of marble that wasn't Moses come on yeah and so when we see these trials and tests it's not the judgments of God or God being angry with us because of how bad we live and how bad we are it's it's God chipping away everything from us that's not a message believer it's God chipping away everything that's not the statue of a perfect man amen amen so when bad things come you say thank you Lord for chipping away amen and with glory in our infirmities and glory in our tribulation because he's chipping it away one piece at a time amen it's God working on us God is God working through our lives when when things happen look I'm not saying the devil didn't cause it but that God had to allow it amen and so all things work together for the good of those that love the Lord amen and one thing I do know I'm not what I should be but I know I love the Lord today now nobody can make me doubt I love the Lord amen so if I love the Lord if you love the Lord all things work together amen and so we find in that what we do as Believers instead of going to the source and and getting help and counsel what we try to do is we try to do things when we when we feel like we're falling shorts we try to do things that we feel like will make the Lord happy yes because we feel like he's angry with us oh the Lord's angry with me so ah Lord I'm sorry I know I'm terrible I know I'm a terrible person that's the kind of self-talk we give amen that's the kind of self-talk we give and we need some self-help novels sometime or something maybe but but we give that kind of negative self-talk let your testimony be positive Saints but but we get that negative self-talk where we're talking we're always talking about how bad we are and so then to make up for that we try to make up for it by by trying to do some extra works of some sort and we say oh Lord I'm so sorry I'm so bad I'll tell you what I I'm gonna pray more Lord I'm gonna pray more today because I I'm so bad I'm gonna I'm gonna listen to more tapes today I I'm gonna read my Bible more than than I ever have I'm gonna I'm gonna sit down here and read several chapters of the Bible because I'm I'm such a terrible uh such a terrible person or or are we trying to we try to do something for somebody and we should do that brothers and sisters we should do those things but those things don't gain you favor with God hey man we're not we're not working our way into heaven we love the Lord so we do his works amen and so we try to maybe we try to do something extra for somebody or maybe we try to pay some more tithes or something like that or or you know I give an extra five dollars this week here because you know what that is that's Catholicism man we're not buying our way into heaven we're not working our way into heaven amen we're not there's no amount of good works that we can do that will make us Justified there's no amount of good works that'll sanctify you there's no amount of good work look there's all kinds of good old boys out here I guarantee you in Hardy Arkansas he's all kind of good old boys they'll do anything in the world for you that'll give you the shirt off their back but that don't mean they got the Holy Ghost amen and so we find then that we say well Lord I've done some bad stuff so here's some extra works for you yeah amen and that's what Israel tried to do with the law uh that's that's they wanted the law so they could figure out a path to be able to work their way into salvation right but I I uh I'll tell you what if you want to write that down it's Romans the third chapter let me just scan that just real quick we might want to look at something in there Romans the third chapter yeah let's just read a couple verses here uh yeah so 19th verse now we know that the things what things so ever the law saith that saith them unto uh the law has saith them unto who are under the law and every mouth may be stopped and all the world may be come guilty before God therefore by the Deeds of the law shall no flesh be justified in his sight now where it says law you can also add the word legalism all right so so by your legalism no flesh will be justified before the Lord amen amen no no amount no long no no matter how long the dresses are or the skirts are amen or or how long the hair is none of those things will justify you before the Lord amen we do those things because it's pleasing to the Lord and we love him and we want to be pleasing to the Lord amen but if you're just doing those things because you think you ought to do those things then you're miserable because you really want to be doing something else amen so the key is the the key is to get God in the inside where it will project to the outside is that right and so now 21st verse but now the righteousness of God without the law is Manifest being witnessed by the law and the prophets even the righteousness of God which is by faith in Jesus Christ unto all and upon all upon all them that believe for there is no difference for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God right amen so he's saying here that the this law that come forth after the atonement was made and the sacrifice given once and the Holy Ghost came back upon the believer the Believers did not obey the law they lived the law before they had to obey the law and when they messed up they had to offer sacrifice but after the Holy Ghost after the atonement was made they didn't have to obey the law they just lived the law because they were sheep because they were doves amen they cleaned theirself from the inside amen but there's a whole lot of Believers today that are trying to obey the message instead of live the message there's a whole lot of Believers trying to live by a set of laws Saints when you're talking to somebody that doesn't know this message a lot of times we talk to them about what they can't do oh you can't do this and you can't do that and you can't do this and you gotta stop going here and you can't you can't you got to let your hair grow and you got to quit wearing makeup and you and you got to stop going to the movies and you got to stop doing this and stop doing that why don't anybody that don't have the Lord in their life want to do that much yeah amen but what we needed to be talking to him about is how we can get God on the inside God is in this message God is in this word amen this is the truth this is the way this is the life God will take over God will live through you amen like Papa Cox said brother Brown I'd like to be a Christian but but I just can't give up these old cigarettes now brother Branham did not condemn him oh you can't yeah come on bridge now yeah amen said I'd like to be baptized but I just can't give up these cigarettes amen yeah but see when God comes on the scene yeah hey man you couldn't make yourself smoke one amen yeah amen come on all right so brother Brown says this in the uh unified unit United under one head excuse me in 58. he said there's two trees one's knowledge the other was life as long as the man eat from this tree he lived but when he bit from that tree he died but you see it's his nature to try to do something to save his self there's not one thing you can do to save yourself man said to me one time he said oh I sought God and I sought God I'll listen to him a few moments and I said sir I want to disagree with you I don't want to disagree with you but I have to you never did seek God and no man never did it isn't man seeking God it's God seeking man it wasn't God going up and down the garden saying Adam Adam Where Art Thou it was man it wasn't man going up and down the garden saying God God Where Art Thou it was God calling Adam Lord and God said in his word no man can come to me except my father draws him you're seeking to find what's drawn you but it's God has to draw first the scripture said that and how true it is so brother Brown said no man can seek God God has to draw you he said now you're seeking what's drawing you amen that's why you see people come around and people come around and want to be around you and and people want to come to church sometimes with you and stuff and they they see something there something is drawn them and they're seeking for what's drawing them amen but it's God that's doing the drawing he said there's not one thing you can do to save yourself he said listen to you legalist Believers I want to ask you something there's he said he wanted to ask him something but then he just told him he said listen to you legalist Believers I want to ask you something there's not one thing you can do to be saved by yourself no sir you are saved by grace and that alone and you have nothing to do with it God chose you in Christ before the foundation of the world that's right there's not one thing you can do to merits so keep all the Commandments you want to join all the churches you want to you're still lost he said amen listen to all the tapes you want to amen memorize all the quotes you want to memorize all the scriptures you want too amen you're still lost amen right look here Saints I've been quoted a lot of message quotes yeah by a lot of devils I didn't know it at the time but when we saw the fruits of the after that how could How could somebody that vowel and that that tormented that that that that deranged quote me the message is that right yeah truth it's because the message ain't on the inside of it right amen it's it's he said it he said there was two trees there was knowledge right and so they got that knowledge they got the message knowledge or maybe the Bible knowledge and all those things Saints but they don't have the life because the knowledge is in the head but the life is in the on the inside of the inside amen all right let's go a little deeper into that I I feel like this one Terry on that just a little bit he said but he said the mark of the beast he said but now how are we saved by faith we are saved and that by Grace nothing you can do not one thing you can do to be saved if you can then Christ died in vain yes it isn't what you eat what you drink how you dress this that or the other but you're saved by grace through faith God by his Sovereign Grace what does sovereign mean he didn't have to explain it amen he doesn't have to explain it it's Sovereign it's freely given there's no strings attached uh he doesn't have to explain why out of my whole family out of my whole I was my parents my my grandparents my my everybody that was in my family why nobody even went to church but God by his Sovereign Grace chose me out of that he chose you out of that amen by his Sovereign Grace not by our works amen he didn't choose you because he was a good person he didn't choose you because you come from a message family amen and I find this difficult a lot of times especially for now we got third and fourth generation message Believers but Saints a third generation message believer that was raised in a message home still has to come the same way I did [Applause] hey man still got to come the same way he's still got to be justified still got to be Sanctified still got to receive the same Holy Spirit amen and if you're coming cause Mom and Daddy does then you're coming for the wrong reason if you're leaving your hair long because Mom and Daddy told you to it's for the wrong reason Saints amen you gotta come because you're called thank you yeah and you got to come the same way oh you got to come the same way it's the same altar that you gotta fall down at now I'm not talking about this physical altar I'm talking about the altar of God but you got to fall down at that same Altar and receive it the same way and it's the same Holy Spirit today amen what else did Jesus do he gave and forsook his own life he gave his life to save yours and mine because that he that he gave his life he didn't have to lay it down he'd done it willingly yes he he didn't have to do it but he did it willingly because he could save you and now he's the only one that can save you there's nothing else can save you since we got the greatest message that's ever been amen but brother Brown can't save us amen he only come to show us the way yeah yeah amen but the but the path has got to come through Jesus Christ he willingly because he could save you and now he's the only one that can save you there's nothing else can save you I know there's a denomination that says their Church saves you you're you're saved by the church he says you're saved by Jesus Christ or you're lost yes sir nothing you can do not one thing you can do only repent of your sin Jesus Christ is the savior yes sir he gave his life for you right thanks we got the same kind of ideology in the message today to where where your people think if you go to the certain Church you're okay you go to brother so-and-so's church so you're okay you go to you go to this church over here so you're okay or maybe you don't even go to church no more so you're okay I'm not getting into that being by the way John enjoy that message Wednesday night from Pastor my goodness amen is Ephesians 4 11 essential for the Bride of the last day my goodness that was an excellent message it was so good that my wife even woke up from her nap to listen to it [Applause] now she don't get up from her nap to listen to me I told brother Ben I said it must have been a good one because we were listening to it on the drive over here and she was she was pretty fast asleep and then brother Ben started preaching she woke up amen amen y'all love the Lord this morning one more quote and then we'll move on but see there's not a thing you can do to save yourself not one thing you've got to solemnly Trust on the grace of God to do it yes oh yeah you can't save yourself I don't care how religious you are amen you can listen to the right tape at 11 o'clock like you're supposed to and it still don't save you come on I said I wasn't gonna do that you can go to the right Church and listen to the right Pastor yeah and it still don't save you amen you can have everything right you can come from the right family from the right home oh my and still don't save you amen because God can go right on past that he can go right down into the gutter he can get the lowest of the low he can get the worst of the worst and he can pull him right out of that mud he can pull him right out of the muck and he can save them just like he did you amen it's Sovereign you can't explain God Amen you can't be born physically into this message you got to be born spiritually into this message right yes oh amen it's good amen yes yes not anything there's not one thing you can do to Merit it you're simply lost and that's all of it there's not a way for you you have to accept his provided method yes that's Jesus Christ and it's freely you don't have to do one thing but just accept what's been given to you not a thing you can do he said amen it's good yes thank you so we go through this process of hearing all this oh we hear all these these things in her head it would make us think we're not good enough and and then we go to the next step of thanking God is judging us by the trials we go through and then we go to the next step of trying to do works and work our way in and and trying to work ourselves through and then you know along the way we're listening to other people we're listening to other believers we're listening to other ministers we're listening to other uh personalities and so forth and and we hear a lot of talk about how spiritual they are and and about about the mighty things that the Lord is doing and truly God is doing miraculous things and we hear about those miraculous things that we hear about all these great testimonies of of healing and testimonies of the power of God and we hear people testifying to things in their life and and how devoted they are and and how much your prayer they do and and people talk you know people talk about oh oh brother I just got down and I was praying and the spirit of the Lord fell on me and I was just there for five six hours and then you know we look at that and we start comparing our life yeah to what we hear from others amen now look it's perfectly acceptable for you to compare your life with the word of God amen perfect so when you hear the word of God you hear that you hear the word of God come forth or or you hear a tape at your home or or here wherever you you're a tape and you hear Brother Branham and you compare yourself with that word that's acceptable because then you want to say Lord let me measure up to that there's the there's the standard Lord bring me to that standard let me measure up to that standard Lord amen when you hear the preaching of the word come forth you say Lord I look here as ministers we we got to preach it the way God gives it to us amen and and and so when the Lord is is dealing with the congregation he's trying to raise the congregation up but a lot of times instead of raising ourself up we're beating ourself down because we say I'm not there I'm not there that's not me this brother so-and-so over here he prays he prays four hours a day a sister so-and-so man she knows that Bible so well and she just constantly reading her Bible and and brother so and so over here he's got such an anointing when he speaks and and brother so and so over sees visions and and this brother dreams dreams and and this brother does this and that brother does that and his sister has got such a uh such a mighty she does so uh the mighty works and saying things for the Lord and we start comparing ourself to others yes and that's where we get into a mistake right you see carnal impersonation is the spirit of this day right people are constantly comparing themselves to others they're constantly comparing themselves against what other people do and say but you can't be nobody else amen what the brother say you can't be what you hate yeah amen you are what you are by the grace of God Amen I especially see it plagan ministers because all the minister will see another brother with a special gift or a special Ministry he Compares his gift or his ministry with that brothers and Saints God uses all of it that's right amen and and you know in a congregation this size you're going to have some people that maybe they can play an instrument or maybe they can sing or or you got some people that that when you put them out there to to do a get-together man the decorations and all the food cooking and all that stuff they just gifted at doing that kind of stuff right and so you can I can't do none of that you say Lord I can't do that I can't sing I can't you know what it doesn't matter what you can do amen it matters what you give to God you say Lord I can't sing but I tell you what I can be at church I can't preach but I can support the ministry amen amen I may not be able to go to Africa but you know what maybe the Lord gifted me financially maybe I can send somebody to Africa amen look Lord I I can't I can't say but I'll tell you what I can do I can say Amen to that word I'll tell you that's important somebody say Amen to the word I mean that's really important for the church service be a really weird service if nobody said amen now I've been in some of them churches it's hard to preach in them amen I said in one church it was stoned silent the whole time I thought they're going to Lynch me at the door and after service that brother after brother sister have said oh brother George because that we enjoyed that that was so good really yeah that is a surprise amen so we all have a place is what I'm saying and you know if the Amen Corner is missing it makes it hard on the preacher to preach amen if the seed is that has you in it amen as a minister you know where you know where that certain amen comes from brother Ben and if that ain't man's not there it affects the service amen amen the song service Saints it's critical critically important to the service amen it doesn't matter how good a preacher you are if you if you get dumped out here put you up here cold any minister is going to struggle amen it's critical these are critical things no matter what your place is do the best you can with it and don't worry about what others say look what others say I'm I'm a little news flash here may or may not be true maybe they listen to five tapes a day yeah maybe they don't maybe they pray five hours a day maybe they don't we're still dealing with human beings here amen so if you're comparing yourself to brother so-and-so that says he prays four hours a day you might be comparing yourself to unrealistic expectations amen amen so this is all a pro this is all the devil affecting our minds using these things to affect our minds to to get off of the point that Jesus Christ made the way called us Sanctified us fill us with the Holy Ghost and did it all and he did it freely and he did it without money without price and it don't matter if I can sing it don't matter if I can preach it don't matter if I can play anything I can't even clap right great come on but God still saved me [Applause] you know some Churches clap on two and four some clap on one and three some clap on one two three four it don't matter amen it don't matter God still saves you Say Amen all right you know we hear a lot of things you hear the message you hear preaching and those things and sometimes you do feel a million miles off yeah you do feel a million miles off you feel like you're way way short way way short and and I think that's natural and I would rather you feel that way than to be one of these other believers that are arrogant and and there's such an arrogance about it oh praise God I'm saved I'm the Bride of Jesus Christ and and God saw you know and you know we start to feel like we're special so that's the only thing special about us is the foreknowledge of God hey [Applause] and so people start to feel like that and they start to talk like that act like no matter what they do you know nothing can happen you know nothing that can happen to them and and that arrogance I don't think God is in it I don't think the Lord is in arrogance like that Lord wants a humble people that are thankful for what he did amen amen I I've had people I had a uh one of these little uh message boys that uh knew all the quotes and stuff but he didn't have no message in him come on and he did something you know it was uh he did something sinful is really bad actually and he come to me to con confess it he's confessed it but his confession was well brother George you know I did that but I'm just so thankful to God I asked him to he I forgive me and he did he's forgiven me and and I just it's so good to be back in the in the grace of God again and that's not confession that's not that's not repentance amen that's not repentance if you're repented about something you're you're sorry for what you did you Lord I made a mistake I I've done wrong this is this is not my intention I I Forgive Me Lord amen that's a that's a different attitude to take amen not just arrogance like we're too good I don't ever want to be so good that I can't talk to a sinner I don't be so holy that I that I can't operate in the presence of somebody that doesn't believe the message I never wanted my kids to not be able to talk to somebody that didn't believe the way they believed I I always wanted to be human and be people and be Godly and represent Jesus Christ to somebody hey man I didn't want him to gasp when they saw a woman with pants on or something like that you know I mean come on we're just people here Saints and we're concerned about other people we love people amen if you don't love people science you need to that you do need to be at the altar oh man amen you know I think watching other people is why we see so many trends of Doctrine in the message you know we're just listen to the message it's been the same way ever since I've been in the message amen message ain't changed nonsense now some of y'all I mean you've been in a message 80 years or whatever you got more tapes right yeah you had you had five tapes and then you got six tapes and seven tapes and so yeah it probably changed something for you but but ever since I've been in the message I've had all the tapes and they ain't changed the bits oh yeah just like my Bible every time I read my Bible it reads the same way every time hadn't changed any at all so so so so these trends of Doctrine though they keep changing all the time amen so it's not changing because the message changed it's not changing because the scripture changed so it's got to be changing because people's listening to other people yeah come on Amen and you know just in my short time in the message I was thinking last night about how many of these doctrines has come through my way in my short time and and uh uh I counted up about six different doctrines major uh false doctrines that come through and I don't know how many smaller false doctrines has come through and you know what they do they come through and then they go and then another one comes through yeah and then it goes amen but that Spirit Still Remains the Same amen so if we're trying to compare our experience with everyone else's experience we might be going against unrealistic experiences but God does not require us to do that remember we read in the scripture there where he loved us before we were even lovable amen he died for us when we were ungodly yeah yeah is that what the scripture said amen he said scarcely a righteous man be saved scarcely a man would give his life for a good man or a righteous man but he gave his life for the ungodly amen and he he gave his life for people that didn't love him yeah amen and the Bible said in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us so look we wasn't serving him we wasn't doing anything for him we wouldn't we wasn't doing anything for the kingdom of God and he still died for us [Music] amen so let me assure you the Lord is not angry with you today he is not punishing you today amen he is not require that you work your way into heaven he has freely made the way and freely give it to his people amen so let's get this straight in our minds before we close now look at here I might be 41 minutes in brother Ben fixing to close but let's get this straight in our minds here true that we're not what we should be um it's true that we make mistakes it's true that we come up short it's true that we live below our privileges amen now I can tell you I'm seeing a bride that's that's being raised up but we're still not there yet but I do see God at work raising up a bride amen and we know that there's nothing left for the coming of the but the coming of the Lord is that right so so it's it's we're getting close amen we're getting closer all the time but obviously we're not quite there yet or he'd already be here amen so he's preparing a bride amen and so he's preparing a bride so it is true that we come up short I make a lot of mistakes I'm sure you make a lot of mistakes we all make a lot of mistakes I say things that I shouldn't say yeah amen I do things sometimes I I shouldn't do I I I I I fail I fall short all those things are true when the enemy when he when he brings that up against you all you can really do is agree yeah that's true but it don't matter it don't matter because here's the thing we do these things and when we do something bad it's man's tendency to run from God it's man's tendency when when we do bad we want to try to get ourselves straightened up before we come back to church oh we do we do something we fall short in some kind of way and we want to try to we try to do some kind of penance for it you know I I'm going to pray 10 hours today and so we're trying to work our way back into his Graces Saints let me tell you something do you think that God don't know what you did oh my God you're trying to hide from him like he can't see it trying to hide from him like he don't know it he knows what you did he knew what she's going to do before the foundation of the world that's why he made a way of Escape is this all right this morning he knows better than we know what we are God knows what you are better and you know what you are right you can't hide from God but he loved us anyway before we was lovable he loved us anyway and made a way amen he took our place many times we won't come to God because we're ashamed and we're trying to fix it ourself let's turn one more scripture Romans 8. I don't know that I got out of Romans today I love Romans I'm gonna read part of this but if you got some homework tonight maybe you could read the whole chapter of Romans 8. uh but I'm just going to read part of it for time's sake here but Romans 8 will start at the uh let's start at the 22nd chapter or verse there we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the Redemption of our body now let me stop and say this can you feel that groaning in your spirits it's it's a pressure today it's a it's a test today it's a it's a groaning it's it's you want something so bad and it's it feels like it's right there yeah amen but it's just a little further Saints yes yes but it's a groaning that's within us all where we know that we're fixing to be reborn amen it's those birth pains it's that travail amen waiting on that birth of the new body yes for we are saved by hope but hope that is seen is not hope for what a man seeth why do he yet hope for but if we hope for that we see not then we do with patients wait for it so that makes it even more complicated doesn't it what we're waiting on we just can't we know it's coming we feel it's coming we know it's there but we don't know exactly what it looks like amen we don't know exactly how this Rapture is going to take place we don't exactly know what the church is going to go through before that time comes we don't exactly know but we know it's coming because the word promised it amen and we ain't got it all figured out we don't know exactly but we know it's coming and we have hope for the things that we don't see likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for as we ought isn't that something yeah yeah yeah we don't even know how to pray right amen yeah yeah but but the spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered for he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what's in the mind of the spirits because he maketh intercession for the Saints according to the will of God isn't that beautiful Saints amen you say well I I don't know what to pray for you don't even have to know what to pray for you just pray amen and you know you say well I might pray for the wrong thing the spirit makes intercession for those things also see what it said God knows your hearts he knows what you mean he knows what you're trying to convey amen he knows what you're saying you may not know how to say what you're feeling but he knows and he makes the intercession right amen it's good praise God and we know that all things work together for the good to them that love God to them who are called according to his purpose for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed into the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover who he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also justified in whom he justified them he also glorified this is all in past tense it's already done it's already done amen and we say well I I don't know how that could be well you don't think God knows the end from the beginning amen how could he prophesy how could there be a prophecy if God didn't know the end from the beginning he knows why it's gonna wrap up he knows how it's all going to be he knows what you are and he's not looking at what you are now he's looking at what you are there amen he's looking at a finished work so when you think God's judging you he can't even see all that it's done the blood of Jesus Christ he's looking at a perfect statue of a perfect man a perfect woman [Music] amen all right this last little bit here I just I don't want to read this but I do want to read this so all this condemnation that we deal with all this uh beat down that we take by the devil all of these negative thoughts and negative emotions negative feelings all of those things that we deal with Saints that's just going on up here that's the greatest battle ever fought that's the greatest battle ever fought is going on right here in our minds but but the Bible says this this is what we got to lean on not what's going on in our minds but we got to lean on what the word of God promises is that right so that's what as a Christian that's our job is to lean to the word of God above what we think feel above what our emotions say we say well the word says amen and the word says what shall we say to these things if God be for us who can be against us God is for us he's not angry at us he's not punishing us he is for us he's not upset with you hey man he's not trying to punish you he's for you when he lets those light afflictions come on he lets you struggle a little bit that's for you amen amen so when you're done you look like that statue amen he's chipped away yeah he that he spared not his own son but he delivered him for us all how shall we not with him also freely give us all things freely give us all things who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect amen Satan can come before the Lord and can can lay all kinds of charges about oh did you see what they did you say he said nobody can even lay charge against my elect they're mine they're mine I died for them I Sanctified them I Justified them I glorified them I provided a way for them I did all of that and I don't want to hear nothing else amen yes hey man you know how Mama used to say I I don't I don't want to hear it I don't hear it no more she told me that a lot I don't wanna hear it no more we ain't talking about it no more yeah amen because it's already done Saints nothing can stop you nothing can hold you back It's Already Done God's already done it come on hey man you're already saved you're already Sanctified you're already feel right you already said in God's service and nothing can stop it oh they can't no more stop you then they can stop God rest of that chapter all it says is nothing can separate us from the love of God that's in Christ Jesus as the musicians come amen amen
