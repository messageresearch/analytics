you pray oh that is [Music] thank you Lord [Music] [Music] prayer there's a special need that you'd like to make known but we've uplifted him today I know God sees every Heavenly Father we're so grateful to be here in your presence and to know that you are the almighty God the protector of Our Lives the one who takes care of us every moment Lord and we love you for that we couldn't do for ourselves anything Lord we we couldn't pick ourselves up out of sin or bring ourselves to a place where we knew Lord you reached down and and the almighty God become a man and walked with us and died for us and Rose for us I want to thank you for that today thank you for your blood and thank you for your mercy Lord I pray for each one of these requests that were made Lord we know that that blood makes an atonement for us or if it's maybe a sin and a life or maybe it would be a healing Lord that needs to take place or or a situation where someone is in trouble financially or in some other way I pray you'd reach down and meet that need today Lord I know that you're a God who does those things and I've seen you do it before I pray Lord as the word is preached today that you would hold my lips keep me from saying anything that would be wrong Lord and may we only speak those things that are the Oracles of God we ask it in Jesus name amen you love the Lord this morning amen it's good to be here on a win or a Sunday morning we missed Wednesday night didn't we because of the snow but I was back in Wednesday night gear but it's good to have you this morning good to have each and every one of you uh it's good to have you uh sister in the back again with us this morning God bless you and and uh and each one of you that are here good to have other cosmen here this morning and his family with his sister Holly and the girls and what a blessing they've been to us over the years but the cosmen is going to speak for us tonight and uh my brother Cosman we several years ago I learned a Love by the cosmen because he kept us in his home they're in Dallas and we got to drink his coffee and so I uh he makes the best coffee if you ever get a chance to go to Dallas and drink coffee with brother Cosman I I recommend it now brother Matthew would tell you that his is better but we like brother Cosman so but uh you just you can hide that from Matthew if you want to so it's all right hopefully he don't hear that it's good to good to see each and every one of you here this morning let's turn to Ephesians chapter 2. Ephesians chapter 2 and verse six good to have my brother Jonathan with us this morning as well go down for the service and each one of you that are here we've got several gone this morning but I'm glad you're here this morning and if you're watching this morning on the stream thank you for doing that Ephesians 2 and 6. he says he hath raised us up together he hath raised us up aren't you glad for that and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus I pray the Lord would add his Blessing to the word you may be seated we've been talking about Ephesians and another Ephesians and this is where I have taken that from it's from The God Who is rich in Mercy brother Branham says this he says now then we find out that we've come to another Ephesians another Ephesus now he said where that in our intellectual denominations and so forth and all of our educational programs has come to its Jordan has come to its Jordans in other words it was ineffective to carry Us in to the land where we could manifest all of the word of God we could follow it to the Border we could or the denominations could carry us so far but this message was a coming out message and a going in message so there had to be a coming out of the denominational Egypt and there had to be a going in on into the land and what what it means to go into the land is actually to manifest the word word of God that was spoken by a prophet we're not here just to follow or just to just to identify or just to sympathize with the prophet but we're here to actually become what a prophet said and so Moses he said I'm leading you to a land flowing with milk and honey but when they got to the Jordan they had to go in and become what Moses said they would be they had to go in and and become what they were supposed to be and in doing that we found out that there was a spiritual battle that would then take place and a spiritual wickedness in high places would try to keep the people from from coming into the land and from making their entrance into the land that that's where we're at today we're in that spiritual battle so he says our Deni our educational program has come to its Jordan then we must have an Ephesians again he said we must have an exodus to come out and to go into for the Rapture so keep that in your mind now as we progress and we've been dealing with the book of Ephesians now Ephesians places the believer as Joshua placed the Israelites and if you look at the book of Ephesians you'll find that there's actually a a progression to the book and if you read through it carefully and and prayerfully you'll find that in chapter one through three that there are certain principles that are set out to us we we're told we're seated in Heavenly places in Christ and all of the things that that God has done for us in that way and we find that that there's election there and there's adoption there and we've come to a place of understanding of who we are and he's bringing us to a place this is who you are in Christ and we found that he couldn't deal with the Corinthians the same way just kind of catching you up for a minute this morning he couldn't deal with the Corinthians the same way and so he had to deal with them he had to set the gifts in order and things like that but the Ephesians were right where they needed to be to be taught the word brother random said they were it was someone he could teach the word to and that's who we want to be this morning someone who can be taught the word aren't you glad to be a people like that today so now you come into Ephesians and again chapter one through three there's those principles laid out and those Mysteries revealed in chapter four we find he begins to deal with the individual walk and he begins to deal with our position in the body of course just like Joshua would have said the tribes in their order he sets the five ministerial gifts in their order and what they're supposed to be and we won't deal with that this morning we'll deal with it some other time but I want to kind of fast forward this morning it just been on my heart and I want to deal with this part in chapter 5 especially and then he goes on in verse six and we'll deal with that at some time in the future if the Lord is willing but now we're dealing with chapter five where there had to be a teaching with Family Life there had to be a setting in order when it come to family life and the reason that had to be is because the Ephesians remember we're a new generation they were people who were not uh were not God and Jewish principles of living that were not taught under the law and so they come up under an influence of of a worldly theology a worldly idea of how the home ought to be and this is what I want to kind of establish to us this morning that there's an order of God that he wants the home to be a certain way and if we'll do that and we'll follow that and we'll let the Holy Spirit manifest that in our life our lives can be happy and we can actually we can actually live in such a way that even if there were no heaven to gain or Hell to Shone or or no truth to any of that at all which we believe it is truth but even if there was not we can live in such a way that we we would be so happy to live this way because it's just the way God intended for us to be and we wouldn't want to go back to anything else I was talking to brother Cosman yesterday why would we want to go back to denominationalism well and we've seen that we've been there and we know what that entails I don't want to go back I want to press on into the promises of God and so the message of the hour brings us back to an Ephesians of placing the family where it's supposed to be and so we can know what what position we should feel as husbands and wives and sons and daughters and in the family and how we should act now again Ephesus was influenced by The Grecian and Roman cultures they they were a new generation of people that come in and so Paul's got to teach them and he sums up the culture of that world in Romans chapter one we'll go there for just a moment and you just bear with me this morning I you know if you're still here after dealing with what we've dealt with with the air conditioning and the and the smell the last couple of weeks then praise God I think you're going to stick it out so um we just had something crawl up in there and die but we're going to take care of it praise God whenever we find it we're going to take care of it so Romans chapter 1 deals with you just got to acknowledge the elephant in the room sometimes Romans chapter 1 and verse 18 Paul's dealing with the culture of the world and how it got to this place and I want us to understand this morning I want to be very direct about this the culture of the world today is Antichrist it's Antichrist and we don't want to get caught up we don't want to be odd just to be odd brother Branham Todd is sad and we don't want to be odd just to be different but the culture of the world has gone so far off that a person coming out of the world or even raised up in church that if you are exposed to Hollywood you're exposed to the world and we all are on some level there's such an influence of the world that is pulled completely off of what God intended for the family to be and so when we come in we're saved we by the power of God our sins are put on the sea of his forgetfulness as we preached about a couple of weeks ago it's it's as though we'd never done it in the first place and we did it in ignorance and there was an offering for a sin offering for ignorance aren't you glad for that and so the sin offering for ignorance covered us and and we found that uh we were we were brought into this but yet we still have to be taught how that God wants us or expects us to act it's not the holy ghost in your life leads you in many different ways but one of the ways that he leads you is by listening to the word of God and then following that word and so much of our Lives could be affected and could be could be changed and could be made better if we would just do what we know is right to do it and just what's been revealed to us we just follow that so there's a certain way that the world is and this is how Paul and I'll just run through this quickly but so we would understand this morning Romans chapter 1 and verse 18 for the wrath of God is revealed from Heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold the truth in unrighteousness because that which may be known of God is manifesting them for God has showed it unto them so he says the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made so we see creation alone is enough to make you guilty because it tells you there's a God right just the fact that there's a heaven and there's the stars and there's there's clouds and there's there's an earth and it got here is enough that's why atheism it takes a lot of faith to believe this just come from nothing so the average person would believe naturally that there was some creator that made it so now he says that being understood by the things that are made even his eternal power and godhead so that they are without excuse because that when they knew God they glorified him not as God either were thankful it's interesting that that he puts that in there they were not thankful it become common to him we don't want to ever let it become common to us this message that we have this word that's come to us we don't want to ever let it become common where it's just something we do and something we say but Lord let it be the the value of her life let it be the Forefront of everything we do so now he says that they are without excuse they they were not thankful but they became vain in their imaginations their foolish heart was darkened and professing themselves to be wise they became fools that's a strong word but he's actually speaking of that Grecian and Roman culture he's speaking of of uh Aristotle I think is how you say it in Plato and all the different all the different philosophers and all of the scientists they were as proud of their men as we are proud of ours today all the the Bill Gates of the world and the Elon musks of the world and and the different great politicians that were there and the great minds the great scientists of the day they were proud of their scientists and their philosophers and in many ways they were more wise than ours are today they were they had they had a lot many things that but but professing themselves to be wise they they studied human nature they've studied animals they studied botany life they studied all those things and yet in doing so they didn't come up with thanks to God but they come up with a system of man-made religion so now he says professing themselves to be wise they became fools and changed the glory of the uncomfortable God into an image made like to corruptable man we don't worship man right we don't worship a man period no matter who the man is we do not worship a man so because they changed the glory of God into a man and to birds and four-footed beasts and creeping things notice how it descends lower and lower it doesn't happen all at once right it doesn't happen just over even in a generation but it happens over time solely and we can see this nation which was founded on Christian principles which is actually following into that same pathway that it's becoming worse and worse and worse until eventually the very thing that's being worshiped is the lowest form of of thing that you could ever imagine homosexuality let me just be blunt today it's being worshiped in this culture and we have pride month and pride week what's happening to us it's the lowest denominator the creeping thing that's what they worship wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the through the lust of their own Hearts to dishonor their own bodies between themselves and I want to just interject this here idolatry leads to immorality idolatry leads immorality immorality doesn't just happen it starts with idolatry because you you idolize yourself or your pleasure or or the lust or maybe you think you can't fall and you and you lift yourself up idolatry leads to immorality Romans 1 25 who changed the truth of God into a lie and worshiped and served the creature more than the Creator who was blessed forever amen for this cause God gave them up into vile affections for even their women to change the natural use into that which is against nature and likewise also the men leaving the natural use of the woman burned in their lust one toward another I'm just preaching the Bible to you this morning men with men working that which is unseemly receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which was meat and you see AIDS and all the different things that have happened in the natural and also in in the image of a man how that that degrades a man to the point where he's not even recognizable as a man anymore and and so in their own bodies they bear the recompense of that and the shame and the guilt of it because it's not normal right right and we I don't we may get thrown off YouTube for that but it's the truth right now they did not like to retain God in their knowledge God gave them over to a reprobate mind to do those things which are not convenient being filled with all unrighteousness fornication wickedness covetousness and and that unrighteousness that fornication is actually the word pornail which is uh which is covers any sexual sin right outside of marriage you understand that uh God is allowed and honored certain things and anything outside of that is covered under the word fornication in the New Testament wickedness covetousness maliciousness full of Envy murder debate deceit malignity Whispers I love how he brings it on down it's not just the sins of the flesh but the whispers the backbiters haters of God despiteful proud boasters inventors of evil things disobedient to parents oh all the Parents Ought To Say Amen to that one huh without understanding Covenant Breakers without natural affection oh don't we see that today implacable unmerciful who knowing the Judgment of God that they would commit such things are worthy of death not only do the same but have pleasure in them that do them oh church we need to recognize this is the culture of this age this was the culture of that early church and if there's another Ephesians there's another world that we have to we have to come out of just like the Ephesian age was so we're in a first age again this nation has gone down into the decline like Roman the Roman Empire did and we're standing there when the bride has got to come like the first the one that went into the ground if the seed the wind of the ground had to be planted and it's coming up again now and we're living in that age of the ripening of the grain what is the world going to be like it's going to be this come on now this is the age that we live in and Paul said it shouldn't be named among us as Christians right and I I want to be just as open as I can with you about that and we need to we need to do better and yet I understand that people fall people are human people are flesh your flesh doesn't get saved people mess up that's part of it but acknowledge the truth my brother Brandon said you tell your children the truth teach your children the truth what these children understand this culture is not what God intended it to be brother Branham speaks of the culture he says oh you see it's this intellectual day that we're living in education civilization and the Modern Trend of the day is all of the devil that's pretty hard but he explains he's not talking about uh you know grade school education where you go in to learn your math and science but it's the education that is leading to a knowledge against God and it's education that does that but the Bible says you just get farther and farther away from God and again if you need to learn how to become a doctor learn how to become a doctor that that that's that's understandable you have to do that but be careful with the stuff they're trying to teach you I I found it was interesting that they taught in in high school they make you take a psychology course and it's in that psychology and the philosophy and things like that that's where the devil can really get in and begin to work now and so now he says this intellectual day that we're living in education the Modern Trend of the day is all the devil he said civilization of the devil yes sir the Bible said this civilization has death oh that's wonderful there will be no smell like that praise God there will be no death smell no dead things in that Civilization oh I'm so grateful oh my look he said he said it'll not be like this in the other world will we have a civil civilization like this in the other world no sir we'll have a different kind of civilization and he said education all these things there of the devil science again and it's not promoting ignorance but it's the fact that we know that the devil has gotten into these things and worked in Civilization and education he said science perverting the natural things making something else he said look what they've done to you now the readers I just said that young men and young women go through the middle age women and menopause between 20 and 25 years old just hold on for a little bit we'll we'll get where we're going this morning but he said one more generation there'll be nothing to be horrible looking but the creatures will be soft and Mucky we're living there if you've ever had any employees you know that's the truth the world has gone soft look at the Spirit look how the spirit and the church has got hybrid intermarried to the world oh what an hour Fleet children flee amen oh if I could cry it out to you today the same way that a prophet did he said flee to the cross flee to the Cross come to Christ let him lead you you say where will I go where I can hide from these things if I go to the country if I go to the city if we close off our services and just keep everything quiet you can't hide from that where will we go to get away from the culture of this world well I won't have the internet I won't do all this that's fine maybe you shouldn't have it but I'll say this the only place that their safety in is in Christ you better stay in the word in this hour you better guard your heart in this hour because Satan is like a roaring lion and he's the prince of the power of the air but this is the hour remember he was called to Heavenly places but you were called to Heavenly places to sit at the right hand of the son of God are you with me now the Brown says this he said let me prophesy something to you just before it comes to pass the whole world is grouping in insanity grouping I went and listened to that just to make sure that was the word he used it's grouping grouping in insanity and will get worse and worse and worse until there'll be a bunch of maniacs and it's almost that way now this was in 1965. but you know in 1965 most of the way you grouped was in person right but I found it was interesting that year a man named Lawrence Roberts made two separate computers in different places talk to each other for the first time it was a precursor to the internet and social media that we have today 1965 that same year and he told us he said the world is groping in insanity and then we as you continue down from then until now it's been a long time ago we found that in 1989 they proposed the idea of a web of information in 1991 they created web pages in the software to view them for the first time on the internet I was six years old at that time uh but it wasn't freely available we didn't have it uh at least in the country where we lived and some of you may have first started to adopt those things at that time the first social media was invented in 1997 which proves that we can live without it if we had to Myspace come along in 2003 Facebook in 2004 people grouping finding new ways to group together to think together Snapchat come along in 2011 Tick Tock in 2016. it's brand new but the world is all on it everybody's on it why what what is that and I'm not condemning those things those are just algorithms and tools and and things that there's no nothing evil about the software what's evil is the minds behind it and the minds using it many times and so now you've got uh Instagram and Facebook and Snapchat and Tick Tock you've got so many true social and Twitter and all the different ones and you've got so many that you don't even hardly know I know that's true of myself but if I you end up just using one and the rest of them are just there but then it comes to a point where they're all grouping together and you wonder why can they all suddenly decide to like something or decide to dislike something or decide to put this person out of society the world is grouping in insanity and a prophet told us that before it ever happened but we're not called to that we're not called to take the group think of the world and I know I know you get on these blogs and things and where the mamas get on there and stuff and they they have a certain way and I'm not condemning that this morning and some of it may be good information but don't just take it because somebody said it because a bunch of people agree with it because most of it's not scriptural a great portion of it's not scripture and some of it may be helpful in some way but we need to make sure that it lines up with the world view that we have as Christians that it's not taken us away from that where well it's okay you know you wanna you wanna get a divorce that's okay you you want to have a you want to go out and have multiple husbands that's all right you want to change from a man to a woman that's okay and it doesn't matter we won't judge you doesn't matter what you do and you'll find more people agree with you if you do that if you decided to change your gender tomorrow you'd have more people agree with you than would ever laugh at you or whatever condemn you in any way and I'll be honest with you I'm not going to condemn you but I'll say this you've gone insane you've taken on the insanity of the world and it's a spirit that comes over people you need to break off break that thing away and you see it coming even in message School message churches and in places where it feels like the world is just creeping in and you have to cry out against them say this is not what we were called to be that's the darkness we are the light Paul says I beg you I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service that's just the least you could do be not conformed to this world brother Brandon said it was like that Satan was poor was the spraying poison spray in the atmosphere and the plants he said would begin to wilt and begin to take on that that spray that attitude that influence and he said be not conformed to this world but be it transformed don't you want to be transformed this morning by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God he said brother Brandon said Don't Let The Devil spray you with education and poison and stuff like that you have to be you have to be modern he said you have to be this he said you don't have to be nothing but Sons and Daughters of God don't let Snapchat pressure you into being something else don't let Instagram pressure you into being like everybody else you stay with the word and again I'm not preaching against those things I'm I'm telling you what's out there we need to we need to recognize we need to be awake and recognize where we're at because I haven't even got to what I'm preaching on this morning so oh that that made you quiet didn't it we'll get through it pretty quick now look brother Brandon says you don't have to be nothing but Sons and Daughters of God if you're born to the word you do he said notice that spray if you take a seed a good seed and you spray it it'll kill it and when they spray this denominational stuff over the top of you it'll ruin the influence of the original word if they tell you you have to do this why the other girls do it the other men do it don't you believe that it'll oh my it'll ruin God's influence of his word upon you you wonder how could a preacher How could a d-school teacher How could a a man of God or a woman of God that seems to love the Lord with all their heart how could they end up involved in something like that that's not saying that's here okay but that's it's out there you've seen it how could someone like that end up you say Well they're just an exceptionally bad person we live in that world if you let that spray come over you and that that influence come on you and you just dwell in that and you just you can find on the internet everything you need to become become a a horrible person and you can be justified in doing it because some psychologists and some some doctors somebody out there has Justified and said it's okay but the word says it's not he said don't you believe that it'll ruin God's influence of his word upon you you can only break the word so many times get to the point where you just walk over it and you know it's right and I'm not talking about people that are struggling with little things there's things that happen we're human beings but when you deliberately walk across the word and you do that and you do it it gets easier the second time and the third time and the fourth time and finally it just don't matter to you see this is matching time yeah let me move on but the man who said you paint your steps red and see if the neighbor don't paint his steps red he said buy Mercury and see if the neighbor don't want a Mercury I don't think anybody wants the Mercury anymore unless it's a classic car by The Herald he said they want to match he said I don't care whether my pants match my coat or my shirt matches my suit I want my experience to match God's Bible he said that's the kind of a match Christians ought to have not whether Jones has got a big church and I got a little one I want Christ and that speaks directly to me as a minister I I want Christ I don't want to look at what everybody else is doing I don't want to look at what the world does to get people in but the cosmen and send them no we want Christ we want to stay with the word we want our families to match the pattern of the word because that's what works that's what a producing another Ephesians in our day it will not be the blogs that'll produce another Ephesians in your life it will not be the internet it will not be Snapchat it will not be Instagram but the word will produce another efficient are you with me this morning first John 2 15 love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him he's talking about the world there you say we look at that and say well if a person loves to paint their face or wear a short skirt and and that is true but it's not it's not the full meaning of it the world is the world order the cosmos if you love The Cosmos the way the world does things that comes down to our attitudes and how we treat one another and everything else if you love the way you can be ever so holiness and sit and gossip about people on the phone and run people down tell stories that you're not sure that it's true but you tell it anyway I'm getting in trouble this morning huh love not the world that's the way the world does they lie about one another we don't do that do we we don't need to be jealous of the world I think sometimes and just being open with you this morning sometimes when we're raised in the message we we only know message churches and we we're kind of jealous of the world a little bit some of you don't know what I'm talking about because you come out of the world you don't want nothing to do with it but but when you're raised in a message home sometimes you look out there and think man they're they can wear shorts they can go to the beach and do whatever they want they can they can display themselves in any old way and and here I am like this and I'm held back well first of all we need the Holy Ghost make you want to do it or else you're just a prisoner right you're just a prisoner but there's some of that that awkwardness you know that kind of lingers it's like well I I was explaining the other day to a man who was a preacher about what we believed and and immediately he he connected it with a person I hate it when they do that and you ever notice they don't connect it with Godly good people sometimes they do I had that happen with Danny Ward one time I told him about the message and he told me about Danny Ward what a good man he was and I thought that's the way it ought to be but he connected it with some preacher somewhere that said well we're not exactly that kind it kind of a little embarrassment that goes along with that we don't need to be jealous of the world though we have our problems I I'll admit to that the the there's people in The Bride do bad things but I put this right up next to anybody I'd put our young people up next to any group of young people in the world there may be things creep in things happen but there is a bride on the Earth today there's somebody that's been raised up out of dead trespasses and says there's another Ephesians going on you can be like Balaam if you want to look at all the bad things that well this is happening this is happening no we'll just keep preaching the word and plugging along because God will have a bride we don't need to be jealous of the world the world has its own problems but Brandon said there's a little door in your heart another little door called jealousy is I don't know whether you Yankees know anything about it but down south you have a lot of that so just a little inferior to the other man just a little better than the other Church God help us today if the Joneses paint their steps red you got to have yours red oh what a horrible Spirit to being a Christian why don't you let Christ come in make him Lord over that little Spirit Room oh selfishness and indifference oh my God but it's matching time that's the pattern of the world it's just the way they are we don't want to be that way so Paul starts to establish the pattern of the way families should be because in that we see the mystery of Christ in the church right you say well I'm a widow I'm alone I I don't have a family or there's been trouble in my family I'm all by myself as a Christian a natural widow or a spiritual Widow in that way but this has a bearing to you as well and maybe a more significant one in this way that your head is Christ and you've got to recognize that the things that we say about the way a man should be or we're saying that of Christ and the things we say about the way a woman should be we're saying that of the Bride so this is a mystery concerning Christ in the church Ephesians 5 20. he said giving thanks always for all things unto God and the father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God this is important brother Branham says this about that scripture he said submit yourself congregation submit yourself to your pastor but he doesn't stop there right Pastor submit yourself to your congregation this is interesting what he's saying is you submit yourself to the whole body right he said if a little click Rises up don't be on either side submit yourself to the whole congregation congregation he said if you start in a click submit yourself to your pastor in the fear of God so he said in that way we're not supposed to gather together and have a little and we don't do that like we've not had a problem with that but just so that we know we're not supposed to band together and spend our time running people down even if it's a pastor or one another even if it's somebody that's a little bit hard we should we should try to do our best to draw our Circle big enough that that person that's a little bit odd or a little bit different we can draw them in because they could be as much the body of Christ the bride of Christ as we are listen he didn't know he didn't call everybody to be as handsome as me or brother Joel not a not everybody's brother Jerome back there not every sister is the same they're different he likes different people and some of them are what we would call different or or maybe even ugly or use a word like that but that's not what God wants to us to see them as he wants us to see beyond the face and Beyond the weight and Beyond the height and see what's on the inside beyond the past beyond what they've been and see the Inner Man and see there's a child of God there the truth now verse 22 oh here we go why submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the Lord and brother random handles this delicately he said how many knows that you women that's exactly right the Bible said so at the beginning it's still the same way verse 33 nevertheless let every one of you in particular now we've jumped down to the end but I want you to watch this how these two verses tie together he said so love his wife even as himself and the wife see that she reverence her husband now watch this admit yourself reverence your husband be like Sarah who called her husband Lord right that's that's hard stuff in a feminist Society isn't it that's difficult and we've heard those things preach and maybe maybe in an unbalanced way in the past and it affects the way that you think about it and I know it's hard to hear but it's still the truth of God the truth of it is and brother Branham explains this reverence he said oh for the grace of God he would give us understanding of such great Mysteries that's a great mystery he said we're in Ephesians I thought we were going to be high and lifted up we are we're seated in Heavenly places hearing the message that the Ephesians we're hearing look he said he said uh such great Mysteries as Paul Paul spoke here further on down in the vision speaking of the husband and wife said this is a mystery how the women should be in respects to their husband he said even the second place I believe it is in the entire Bible that reverence was ever spoke to said the women the woman see that she reverenced her husband reverence her husband then a husband now watch where he puts this leadership starts at the top because I'm not actually going to talk about the women today in my remaining time I'm going to talk about us men because leadership in a home starts at the top if you have listen God Is So set it up or if a man cannot control his family and his wife and I say control in the sense of the just going out into the world and running around and doing things that they shouldn't do and there's no there's no correction there's no uh there's no ability to hold on to his family if a man can't lead his family he said he can't leave the church right if his wife doesn't believe that he's real God help us today then no one else is going to believe it and I want you to understand men make mistakes men have struggles and I have the same struggles all of you do because I'm a male a human being this flesh is not saved and it's just the same brother Branham had those same struggles even Jesus when he come down on a body of Flesh though he was born of a virgin was tempted by women brother Branham taught us that but he didn't never fail never dwelt on that thought and that's why we have an atonement when we do fall that he was one who didn't and he died for us right and but yet we're called to a place where we turn our head where we do differently than that and and but it always starts at the top there's got to be there's got to be a man there's got to be somebody who will Who will set such an example to his to his wife to his family that they will reverence him as the son of God he said the husband ought to live such a life before his wife that his wife could reverence him as the Son of God listen you may live ever so pure and holy but if you're constantly flying off the handle and throwing things and and uh and calling your wife names listen she's not going to reference you as a son of God are you with me this morning you got to take care of that but the brown said that anger is insanity my notes that you just take that for what it's worth he said if he doesn't live that kind of life well then of course she wouldn't reverence him because she knows what he's made of yeah but when it is a man that is reverent man reverent and clean with his wife and before his family a real servant of God then the women children and all should respect that servant of God with reverence now watch Ephesians 5 23 he goes into that for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body think about your role today as men I know this is disquieting in some level but we'll go through and talk about the family a little bit and then we'll get off of that I try not to preach every service on it but this is the age we live in we need to hear it this is God's pattern for us it's meant right this is an Ephesians pattern not a pattern of of of marriage and divorce and remarriage and breaking up homes and and living in uh in Corinthians they were a man was living with his with his stepmother and all of the things that went on there and and he Paul's not dealing with that with the Ephesians he said this is the high place that you've been called to husbands you that that love your wives he said I want you I want to command you love your wife I want to tell you you're the head of the home I want to tell you you're the savior of the body right huh therefore as the church is subject under Christ so let the wise be to their own husbands and everything boy that's hard to take boy and get any amens at all but it's still the word I warned brother Cosman last night I said oh Lord you're dealing with me on something I'm gonna have to preach it and you just Lord help us today sometimes the pastor's got to preach and then brother cosmon will come and make you all happy this afternoon now he said now he said husbands now watch where he takes this husbands love your wives it's not husbands when you feel like it when it's convenient when they're when they are in their place that's not what he says love your wives and then he tells you how to love your wife he said even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it the man is uniquely commanded to to love his wife the word there is agape he's not commanded to filio his wife you understand if you didn't love her you wouldn't have got married naturally right right there's something there I hope not there's something there some attraction but that's not what he's talking about he's talking about Agape yeah husbands agape love with God's love love with the highest kind of love your wives now brother Branham explains the difference between filio and agapo love he said filio love would make you shoot a man for insulting your wife agape love would make you pray for his lost soul he said that's the difference in another place brother Branham says that if you were unmarried and you were you were going with a girl and you really loved her you really wanted to I wanted to have her as a wife but you knew she would be happier with somebody else he said you you would let her go if you had agape love yeah that's rough isn't it no not after you're married obviously brothers that opportunity is gone huh but you see what I'm saying it's a different kind of love feel your love would make you want to take a rifle and shoot them a couple of make you want to pray for them men agape love your wives agape love is elective love not a love of emotion I love you because you're my wife not because you wash the dishes not because you clean the house not because you look good or don't look good I love you brother Curtis I thought of you I saw a news story about a man been married to his wife for 80 years and you guys aren't that far off you got a few more years but they've been married for 80 years and and she's you know he's talking he said you know she's she's always been the boss and well here we go since she's always been kind of bossy and he was teasing her about that and and at the end he said something just broke my heart he said he said you know he said I just want to make her happy he said I'm so in love with her I just want to make her happy they've been married for 80 years that's the kind of love it takes to stay married but look this is just a couple I don't know if they're Christians or not or went to church I don't know if that's possible in a human realm what is possible in the realm of the agape love that were commanded to love with so it's not a love of emotion it's a sacrificial love a Redemptive love and an unselfish love so we are commanded to love our wives three ways I want you to think about it write it down if you're if you're keeping notes we're to love our wives sacrificially redemptively unselfishly in Ephesians 5 25 he said are you still with me this morning I I got a few more minutes and we'll try to get through it sacrificially it's in Ephesians 5 25 husbands love your wives even as even as Christ loved the church and gave he gave himself for it the idea is love your wise Paul is referring primarily to sacrificial actions for the benefit of the wife and the model for this kind of love is Christ's death on the cross brother random takes that back into the church realm now for those of you maybe that aren't married or you say well brother Ben we don't have any problems with that well good but you're part of a church family he said now he said wouldn't you all like to have a real Bible Church wouldn't we all like that I believe we have one but he said a real Bible Church where all the spiritual gifts were set in order everything making manifests just exactly the way it should be wouldn't that be wonderful he said now you're going to have to sacrifice not money you're going to have to sacrifice what some of your own ideas well I wanted this to happen you don't have to sacrifice some of your own ideas you're going to have to even the preacher has to do that by the way you're going to have to sacrifice some time in prayer well I want a Bible Church don't you yeah you're going to have to sacrifice maybe a stubborn will to break down in humility he said the whole Christian move is sacrificial he that will follow me let him deny himself take up his cross follow me daily he said he said is that right how often do you have to sacrifice every day Paul said he died daily every day he died this is sacrifice picking up your cross and dying sacrifice yourself like he did love your wife like he did sacrifice our will to God's will and I'm preaching to myself this morning as well because I'm as again I'm as much human As You Are sacrifice your will to God's will for the benefit of your wife you notice he doesn't say sacrifice your will to your wife's will although at times that's necessary when her will is also the will of God but sacrifice your will to God's will for the benefit of your wife and so even when it comes to biblical things and and godly things your wife has to be with you and the measure of a leadership of a man is how many people he can bring with him into the same thing that he was going to do anyway are you with me now it's not it's not I'm doing it in spite that's not a leader I'm doing in spite of what they say that's not a leader a leader is someone who brings them with him right now sacrifice yourself like he did he gave what did he give not diamond rings not not gold not silver what did he give he gave himself he gave himself and yet we want to we want to give things to our wife brother Brandon says this he said if you love your wife you love to do something for her and all the wives said but look he gave himself not just things you see God had already given us his universe we read about that in Romans 1 he had already provided a home for us he already made all things beautiful but then he came himself he did not leave us as the bride without personal a personal relationship with him he came down in human flesh that is the mystery of the godhead he come down in a human body and he fellowship with us your wife doesn't just need your salary he does she doesn't just need the things you buy for her she needs you are you with me now now think about that spiritually we don't just need the things that God gives us the benefits of being a Christian we need intimate fellowship with him or you hear me today we don't need just a form the Baptists have a form the Methodist everybody's got a form but we don't need a form we need him we need Christ and we're happy for the gifts we're glad when the when they come we want to partake of the good things that he's given us but we need him most of all we want to fellowship with him that's why we come to church that's why we sacrifice that's why we put up with things why because we come to the house of God because we think Lord I want to Fellowship more with you we fellowship with him here we fellowship with him at home we fellowship with him on the job why he's always there with us he said I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you what kind of a husband do you have church what kind of a husband do you have you have a husband that that is set the perfect example he said I'll never leave you amen I'm so glad for his grace that's the kind of love he wants us to have not where we just tolerate one another yeah that's not what he's called us to yes it's called us to give ourselves sacrificially to the one that we chose to be our wife your wife doesn't just want as we said your money or you're good she wants you had a sacrificial level work their fingers to the Bone to give their wife a handful on purpose remember Boaz even before they were married he made sure that he dropped a handful on purpose and brother Brandon said God does that for us he said a good meeting the presence of the Lord just come in he wouldn't have to do that we fill his presence when we're sitting here in the church service he wouldn't have to do that but he does it but the cause why does he do it for us it's a handful on purpose Revelation at opportune times in our lives strength when we need it I know you get weak and you get tired and you get worried and you think well I'm not going to be able to make it we're not going to there's no way that we can make it there's a handful on purpose for you this morning there's strength for you grab a hold of it take advantage of it spend time with him let him let him drop handfuls of purpose he wants to give give good gifts to his children he wants to do that he said I can't be this I can't do that brother Ben I can't you let him let him make you that listen he he gave sacrificially he gave redemptively in Ephesians 5 26 that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of Water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot a wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish he takes a wife who is unworthy and redeems her see this is a higher call than taking a worthy wife and loving her for her worthiness and we should take worthy wives right but but it chose our character but he took a wife who was unworthy and redeemed her like Adam leaving the garden why because he was God's son he was God's son and though he was broken though he had sinned though he'd done all of those things yet he walked out of the garden with Eve why did he do it because he loved his wife so brother Brown taught us he went out with her sacrificially he left the garden look at Hosea chapter one you know the story of Hosea the prophet it's an odd story really verse 2 it says the beginning of the word of the Lord by Hosea and the Lord said to Jose go take unto thee a wife of ordoms and children of whoredoms you say brother Ben I'm going to go do that you better have had God speak audibly to you and saw a vision and be a prophet but look that's going to illustrate his Redemptive love the Redemptive quality of agape love he said go take a wife huh that doesn't know anything but leaving one man and going to another he said for the land has committed great horde and he said he said Jose I want you to experience what I've experienced because Israel was a chronic backsider back and forth and she was always that way she never would but he loved her anyway it was his people and Jose's wife was the same way and she finally left him and ended up a slave on The Auction Block and you find in Hosea chapter 3 and verse 1 it said then said the Lord unto me after she left after she'd went out done everything she could do the Lord said unto me go yet love that's hard it's really hard I said go yet that yeah it's a big word it's only three letters but it's a big word yeah she's already done everything she could possibly do this is agape love yeah this is Redemptive love except my wife didn't wash the dishes I'm going to divorce her where'd you get that baloney from not from the scriptures well I found out something about my wife from you know long ago well you're going to have to deal with that but you use that as an excuse for divorce you're no better than the Pharisees before Jesus came so divorce their wives for any reason go ahead I know that's strong but I I know how it's been around here it's just well man can and a woman can't so we'll just go do it the Bible says God hates divorce God hates putting away and I understand some of you've been through that and that's hard I I get that some of you the innocent parties some of you may have caused it there's still Grace in the in the mind of God you understand God the grace go there's no sin that if you're if you're repentant and you're willing to go to God but don't do that thing again don't make it worse don't compound it yeah look at the love the Redemptive love that Jose had the Lord wanted Jose to experience this he said go yet love a woman beloved of her friend yet an adulteress according to the love of the Lord towards the children of Israel who look to other gods and love slagons of wine so he goes down to the Side Market and he said so I bought her to me verse two I bought her to me for 15 pieces of silver and a homer of barley at a half home where barley it's the price of a Slave and I said unto her Thou shalt abide for me many days thou shall not play the Harlot thou shall not be for another man so will I also be yes for thee you see the concept it's not you did it so now it gives me an excuse to do it right but it's go go yet love the woman and say I'm going to be true to you you weren't true to me but I'm going to be true to you we don't even it's hard to even comprehend that kind of love that's what the way God loved us see he was manifesting agape love to her unmerited favor not because she deserved it but because he chose her to be his wife this is a great mystery this is redeeming love when the dishes haven't been done and the children are crying and when the house is a mess and the food is burning redeeming Love Gone to sins oh we're getting down where we live now redeeming love come to sins and you saw a prophet of God step out of his place as a prophet and a minister and preacher put on an apron and walk down with his wife it's the same concept yeah redeeming love it wasn't his job but he did it anyway he had other better things to do but he did it anyway aren't you glad God loves you like that he doesn't leave you and say I got preachers to deal with I got other people I can talk to I got great people in the message but he comes to you and he speaks to you individually and he deals with you in such a way that you don't even you think why would you spend this time with me why would you let me feel your presence why would you allow me into the innermost being of your heart why would you let me know your secrets because of the love that he has for you Redemptive love when all of this is going on it takes her place and does for her what she cannot do herself and that ought to make a wife reverence her husband and want to do the very best that she could to be who she's supposed to be that makes sense starts at the top unselfishly Paul says so ought men to love their wives as their own bodies now he's getting down where the rubber meets the road he that loveth his wife loveth himself you think by taking well I'm going to take some me time and do things for me and and think about me listen there is no me once you're married there's no me there's no I'm going to keep my account she's gonna keep hers and she'll make her money I'll make mine that's a modern concept of marriage that's not what God put in place there's no me there's us men ought to love their wives as their own bodies because if you love your wife you love yourself why would you not love your wife when you know when you don't show love to her and you don't do what you're supposed to do it's going to come back at you right you're going to pay for that you get what you put in right and and realize we are initiators as men women are responders in many ways and it's not just in uh just in uh fleshly ways but actually in actually in life just in life we are we are initiators and and we're to go and watch for those things and and we can't do it unless we're around them but if we're around them we're the one that puts in when you put in when you when you initiate those things when you voluntarily do things you wouldn't have to do that causes your wife to reciprocate and she ends up actually maybe doing over and above what she would it makes your life better if you love your wife you love yourself not only that but you're also one flesh for no man ever yet hated his own flesh but nourisheth and cherisheth it even as the Lord the church for we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones for this caused shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined unto his wife and they too shall be one flesh the word nourishes this nourisheth it up are you still with me did I say I was closing I am closing now another hour right no we're not going to do that we're almost done he nourishes it nourishes refers to food and internal sustenance cherisheth to clothing and external fostering but it's natural and spiritual obviously nourish and cherish and the idea is this you don't dress yourself or feed yourself any old way right if your wife well maybe some of you do but if your wife picked picked out the worst clothes you have that you hate one morning picks that out and that's what you're going to wear maybe she don't pick out your clothes but or maybe she buys them I don't know maybe she irons them people do that anymore but whatever she does Andrew Glover does but we know he earns his clothes and and uh so uh but anyway that threw me off track but whatever she does if she gave you if you got the worst set of clothes that you had and you were wearing them clothes around they weren't ironed they were messed up and then you get home and the dinner's on the table and and it's the worst meal the one you've told her I don't like if you were brave enough and it's just the worst possible thing you would be so upset because she deliberately did something that she knew you wouldn't like and I know most of you ladies would never do that unless you were just particularly upset huh but you wouldn't do that truthfully the man wouldn't do that right I'm not gonna go eat the worst thing on purpose so if I won't dress myself any old way I don't want my wife dressed in any old way I want to take care of her if I won't feed myself any old thing I don't want my wife eating any old thing I want to take care of her now think about this now as it comes to Christ in the church Christ makes no decisions which do not build up his church have you thought about that he makes no decisions except for those that build up the church edify the church oh my God oh my listen that's the way we ought to be as husbands that's agape love for our wives is when we make no decisions which do not build up our families see he doesn't eat steak while his wife eats those sausages from a can huh oh I can't stand those but he doesn't eat steak while she eats spam they're one are you with me now he doesn't give her the leftovers but she's one with him and that's the way we are with Christ listen listen what he did for us John 14 1 let not your heart be troubled you believe in God believe also in me in my father's house for many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself and where I am there you may be also now watch brother Brandon said look them hands designed this speaking of our future home for his beloved bride them hands them nail scarred hands oh that ought to make us run all around the building and Shout them hands the same ones were nailed to a tree he went he went to glory and he and went into that other dimension and began to design a home for us yeah them hands designed this for his beloved bride designs in Tender Love for his bride yes them hands designed a home that's the place of the husband now watch truly prepares a home for your pleasure to make you happy in First Peter 3 and 7 Peter puts it this way he's much more blunt than Paul and much more on a a local level he says husbands don't be stupid with your wives huh you know what that's what that says dwell with them according to knowledge husbands don't be stupid when it comes to your wife give honor unto her as until the weaker vessel and as being heirs together of the grace of life that your prayers be not hindered I want to give you an example of that before we close brother Branham wanted to go west he was called To Go West there was something in his heart he always wanted to go west it was just something that about it he God was calling him to that when they built his home he didn't want it to be built I'll just read it to you but Brennan said I he said just before we built this house up here the parsonage where it is now he said I did not want to build there he said my wife's mother was old and and she even wept about it she said I just can't leave Mom here with knowing she's old and she might not be taken care of now remember brother Brown's mom had already passed away I believe at that time or she was very old and passed away first and then his wife's mother was still living and so she said I just can't leave Mom here without knowing she's old and she might not be taken care of he said well I understood that I understand that's her mother the only mother she ever had or ever will have so I understood that so I prayed to the Lord oh my look at the humility of how he how he talked to God about it I said Lord being that I do not like the place no he built the house that he wanted to live in in Tucson never lived in it he made the right decision with his wife I prayed to the Lord I said Lord being that I do not like the place I said make me satisfied I'll go anywhere you want me to go from anywhere but I don't want to grieve my wife so he felt a call from God to go west but he said I don't want to grieve my wife to take her away from here into a strange country where she knows no one and then I'm gone all the time anyhow just make me satisfied to be here with her that's God's love manifesting through a man just made me happy to be here with her oh God I want us to Bow our heads together Paul says in verse 32 this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ and the church and this is the quietness of this moment I want us to think about it if you're a husband today you have a wife I don't know what the relationship's like it may be hard you may have gone through some things all of us have on some level or another some more than others it's just something come in my heart when I read this I said God I don't want to agree with my wife make me satisfied I don't have any calling to go west or to move anywhere that's not it but just when when there's something I want to do but I know it would break the heart of my wife satisfied Lord make me satisfied I wanted to go to Israel this year my wife didn't want to be gone from the kids for that long it's gonna be a long trip had opportunity to go and I'm not putting myself up because I had I had to really fight a battle with myself over this my wife didn't want to go she's never flown overseas and and never flown at all and and being gone from the kids that long that's her world they may be getting older but they're still her babies and I don't mean to sorry Brittany I don't mean to point you out this morning but she didn't want to go I had to come to terms with that she didn't tell me no she wouldn't do that but I had to pray kind of like this Lord make me satisfied made me satisfied to be here with her he said well so they should do that no you should you should come together you should make decisions together you as a husband should lead your wife in such a way that she would be happy to live in your home and I found that it doesn't really matter how much money there is it doesn't really matter what's what's around like that what matters is whether or not there's something in your life that she can respect and reverence and say that's a man of God he makes mistakes but he's a man of God and I know he wants what's best for me don't you want what's best for your wives for your children for your home that God make me like that I I want to pray that way this Lord make me that way and if you're single here today or unmarried not I don't have a wife or a husband and you sit here and you think well what how does this apply to me say Lord help me help me to be submissive to you if you're a wife Lord help me to be submissive in a Biblical way to my husband as a husband help me to love my wife with that kind of sacrificial love that undying love that that unselfish love let me do it Lord I don't want to be like the world I want to be like you would you just pray with me for a moment Heavenly Father Lord just in the quietness of this moment we we feel your presence here today Lord we we want to be the right kind of husbands we want to be the right kind of people in the world Lord help me today but I want to do the thing that'll help my wife I won't grieve her Lord even when it comes to spiritual decisions I know I'll do anything you want me to do Lord but Lord help me I don't want to grieve my life I don't want to take away from my family just by maybe studying too much or not spending enough time sometimes Lord I know you want me to love my wife to take care of my wife oh God would you help me to do that Lord I'm sorry forgive me where I failed Lord these men where we failed Lord we're human beings we don't always do the right thing we don't point out these things but Lord we just want to contrast the character of the word from the character of the world or do we see the character of the world how that marriages don't last anymore and it just one after the other I read that the marriage is on average only lasted every eight years oh God lord ours are to be ever Eternal and in the sense that you give us our wife that's our Eternal maid in glory oh God how what a teaching that is what a responsibility that is I pray God that you'd move Lord for those that have tied knots that can't be untied on this side I pray God that you'd help them help them to do the right thing from here on out we can all we've all made mistakes but from here on or we know we can't cross your word and be right we can't do it can't do it it puts us beyond the the ability to even think right and do right Lord we want to do the right thing we want to live right Lord fill us with your Holy Spirit may your Holy Spirit Lord just just permeate every inch of our homes and or may our homes be a place where the token is applied or to may your may your life may your word be manifested in that home we pray we thank you for forgiveness we thank you for your love we thank you for your unselfishness we thank you Lord that you came and died for us we don't want to ever get over that Lord we love you we thank you for all that you've done in Jesus name amen oh we love you Jesus oh Jesus we love you we thank you for being
