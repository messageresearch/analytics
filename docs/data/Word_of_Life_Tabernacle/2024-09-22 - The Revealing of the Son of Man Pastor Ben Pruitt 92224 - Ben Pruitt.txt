God's done for him soen brother Danny first first off the first thing I want to say is I certainly do appreciate the church here and uh everyone that prayed for me while I went through this thing that I went through and uh it's been a little little crack and a and a blessing but I've learned a lot of things but uh it's all started back in December of last year with went for a a wellness check that Medicare wants you to do and I really didn't have no problems that I knew of I just we went to it because they told us we had to both to and so we did that and uh found out that when they run the blood test came back to PSA score which is a they judge your prostate health by that was a 18.26% a 4.00 so they sent us to a to a a urologist on J in January which he started the test first thing you went for there for an exam he set us up for a they decided I needed a biopsy so they determined from that in March that I needed a that I had prostate cancer so they went to checking that and I don't know if you know anything about the gleon score and all that stuff mine was a nine and it you're supposed to be down around around three or four or something the higher that number the worse it is so all in all the then they sent me for a pet scan and they run me through several different things of biopsy and a pet scan finally we come down in in uh May the end of May that they sent us over to uh they had to go in and put some blockers in the prostate and then they started radiation treatment in June I went through 28 of them we finished that up July the 15th and uh I had didn't really have any major issues God brought me through that I thought rather well they think you know they say that the radiation is not something that's painful and I have to say it's not it took you go in there and it took longer to get ready get in there and get ready than it did to go through the radiation but but the after effects are I found out are a little more serious than I was really expecting but God's helped us through that we've been able to do whatever we needed to do and uh I know it's only because of all of the prayers of the Saints people have been praying for me for a lot from a lot of places and I certainly do appreciate it and I believe God's been really good to me so the PSA score went from uh an 18 up to a 24 before they started the ra the radiation and the hormone blockers and stuff they did I went back to the doctor last week and the report came back my PSA scored down to 0.36 and uh the doctor told me that I'd have to take the hormone shots for for a while they usually say it takes maybe up to two years you have to take those shots ever so often but they gave me the six month the six-month shot so I have to go back to the doctor in six months so he said he was well pleased with the way everything came out they did a x-ray of my or a CT scan of my colon or my uh excuse me they did a CT scan of my lower stomach my kidneys and stuff and he said everything looked good with that I had a kidney that had a few little bit kidney stones in it but nothing to be concerned about at this time so I just appreciate like I said everyone I appreciate the way that God has has touched my body I've been able to do a lot of things and still yet I get tired a little bit in the afternoon but I'm almost 75 years old so I guess I blame that part of that problem on that so once again I want to say from the bottom of my heart I love you people I love everyone that that uh is at this church and all around I know different people different places that prayed and I just appreciate that it makes it good when you people tell you that they've been praying for you I know that where our health comes help comes from and I know if the his if his mercy and Grace wasn't on the doctor's hands they couldn't they can't do nothing there nothing they do is them it's through God's grace I won't take no more of your time this morning but I just want you to know that I love you and I appreciate your prayers and I ask you to continue to pray for me that the Lord would keep me and uh just keep continuing to heal this thing amen thankful for what God's done for brother Danny amen amen just just appreciate brother Danny been here a long time time and I get tired in the afternoon so I don't know he's 75 he's going to outdo me for a while so we we appreciate brother Danny and we got a song request for sister Lori to come and sing through the fire and then after that sister Anna and her girls there's been a request for y'all would y'all be able to sing today if not we can do it tonight tonight okay sister Lori gets ready we have a have a thank you card from sister Pat and she says sometimes it's easy to forget that there are nice people out there doing nice things for Brothers uh thanks for being such a special reminder and so that's for from sister Pat and the Biven family so just continue to remember them in prayer but amen y'all pray for me it's been a while since I sang this oh so many times I've questioned certain [Music] circumstances things I [Music] couldn't understand and many times in my trials weakness blurred my vision and my frustrations oh they got so out a hand oh it's then that I'm reminded that I've never been forsaken I've never had to stand one test alone and when I look at all of the victories oh his Spirit Rises up in me and it's through the fire my weaknesses made strong oh he never promised that my cross would not get heavy and my heels would not be hard to clim no he never author my victories without fighting but he said help would always always come in time oh just remember when you're standing in the valley of decision and the adversary says G you just hold on my Lord will show up oh and he will take you through the fire again oh so many times we questioned certain circumstances things we couldn't understand and many times in our Tri weakness blurs our vision and our fresh frustrations oh they get so out of hand oh it's then that we're reminded that we've never been forsaken oh we've never had to stand one test alone oh when I look at all of the victories oh his Spirit Rises up in me and it's through the fire

it now in Jesus name amen amen thank the Lord amen let's go to Luke 17 and verse 26 Luke 17:26 we go down through verse 30 I've been ministering on Abraham and we've come down to a part that is important but before we go on into it I want to uh speak to you about the revealing of the son of man and maybe that would be something that sounds just a little bit different or strange to uh some of us and uh you say well I've heard people say that Brothers talk about it but what is it and so we're going to go into that a little bit today and you just bear with me and try to pay attention and we'll uh go into that and kind of set up what we're going to say this evening in the service this evening so just just stay with us if you can and and I want to be in such a way that the Lord would help me that when you leave you would you would know what that is and and how it applies to your life so we want to talk about the revealing of the son of man and uh and uh brother Stewart and brother Joel are out this week but we're going to make up for it next next week they'll be here and I'm going to have both of them preached so uh they'll uh be uh you'll be hearing from them next week and then the Ben Beard's meetings are next weekend so be praying about those uh Brother wendle Martin is going to be with us at our fall festival that weekend so I'm looking forward to that and we sure appreciate brother Wendell and and he's always a help to the church so remember that as well October 27th amen let's read the word Luke chapter 17 verse 26 as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be also in the days of the son of man they did eat they drank they married wives they were given in marriage until the day that Noah entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they builded but the same day that lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all it says even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed I pray the Lord would add his Blessing to the word you may be seated good to see each and everyone this morning look like we got a couple of visitors God bless you this morning good to good to have all of you with us what is the revealing of the son of man and why does it matter to me as an individual I you know everything when we come to church there ought to always be something that applies to us something we can take home something we can uh uh we can take to work something we can take to school I heard a story about a woman who went to the to church and she listened to the sermon and and when the pastor was done she said pastor that was a great sermon she said she said uh everything you said applies to someone I know but you know we can do that and look at how it applies to somebody else but how does it apply to me and how does it make a difference in my life and I want to tell you I want to present to you this morning that this message makes a difference in our lives it makes a difference we're not just talking about it we don't get up here just to talk about a man we don't get up here just for the purpose of uh of exalting a man or telling a story about a great faith healer somewhere something like that what we get up here for is is to preach the light of the hour the message of the hour because it changes us it it makes us better husbands and makes you better wives and makes you better church members and makes you better makes you able to live in a in a world that's gone crazy gives you a sane mind and and it's the message that does it he said well it's the Holy Ghost yes the message and the Holy Ghost are together the holy the angel always accompanies the message and so when we believe the message and preach the message and stand for the message of the hour the holy ghost anoints that in our lives and and produces a life that the world can see and and see that there's a difference in us and I want there to be a difference do you say well I don't want to be different I do want to be different because the world is going crazy the world is is full of nonsense and the world is fixing to go into tribulation I want to be different enough that when the moment comes and and it's time for the bride to go home that I go home with the bride I don't want to be with the Millions who will have to endure the tribulation period I want to go home I want to go in a Rapture and to do that I'm going to have to be different according to the word not different just to be different but to but to have the son of man revealed to me and through me now we want to know how this applies in our lives brother brandom tells us we can never enter the house of the Lord and go out the same we go better or worse how many came to church this morning full participation there right you came to church you walked through those doors unless you were teleported here maybe some of you children were asleep and you just showed up in church you know if you're a church kid you know what I'm talking about you just kind of show up on the Pew and you're there and uh I went to church like that sometimes as a kid you know you fall asleep on the way to church and they carry you in and wait I'm in church what am I doing here and and but you came this morning so you're going to go out later better or worse there's no in between God I want to be better let this service make a difference in my life I don't care who the preacher is I don't care who what's going on around me or what I've been through during the week let me be somebody who can take something home with me that's good because you'll either go out better or worse depending on our attitude towards the word now let's get into this this morning do you love the word this morning let's get into this Luke 17: 30 says even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed that word revealed means to to cause something to be fully known disclosed or revealed and we know there will come a day when Christ comes on the Mount of Olives where every eye will see him and it'll be no secret that he's here at the end of the tribulation period we'll actually come back with him and at that time it'll be no secret that he's in in on the Earth right he's going to rule and reign with a rod of iron the Bible says behold he cometh with clouds and every eye shall see him and they also which pierced him and all kindreds of the Earth shall whail because of him we know he's coming back in that way Zechariah 14:4 says his feet his feet brother JT I believe that's a literal thing I believe God's literally going to do this his feet shall stand in that day upon the Mount of Olives which is before Jerusalem on the East and the Mount of Olives shall cleave in the midst of them getting a little bit of rebound from these uh uh these speakers brother Gabe if you want to just bring them down just a little bit I think it's from the monitors it says and the Mount of olive shall cleave in the midst thereof towards the east and toward the west and there shall be a very great valley and half of the mountain sh moved toward the North and half of it toward the South that's really going to happen one of these days right that's really going to happen there's going to be a a reality to that we're going to see him uh there's going to be a physical coming of Christ Revelation 1911 and you can read the whole chapter maybe when you get home he said I saw heaven opened and behold a white horse and he that set upon him was called faithful and true that reveals something to us about his nature this morning he's faithful to us in the darkest Tri he's faithful to us down to the end of the age he's faithful all the way do you believe that this morning he's faithful in truth and in righteousness he does judge and make war but we realize then that the second coming of Christ that we're coming up to now the Rapture will not be like that at all it'll be a secret coming right a secret coming mark 13:32 But of that day and that hour knoweth no man know not the the Angels which are in heaven neither the son but the father verse 33 take your heed watch and pray for you know not when the time is for the son of man is as a man taking a far Journey who left his house and gave authority to his servants and to every man his work and commanded the porter to watch watch ye therefore for you know not when the Master of the House cometh at even or at midnight or at the cockc or in the morning lest coming suddenly he finds you sleeping and what I say unto you he said I say to all watch now that word watch means I am awake in the night means I'm watchful on the alert and that ought to be the the attitude and the posture of every believer this morning I'm awake are you awake this morning and I'm not just talking naturally but spiritually are we awake uh can we know the times and the seasons do we know what hour we're living in or we let the world just kind of Dole it down to us and until we get to where we just kind of move along and do what we've always done but I think it's time to wake up and that's what the revealing of the son of man was to do was to wake us up now look he said but 1 Thessalonians 5:1 but of the times and the seasons Brethren he said you have no need that I write unto you for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord cometh as a thief in the night now that's not when he reveals himself to the world but when he comes as a thief in the night right and so he doesn't reveal himself in this coming to everybody he doesn't appear to everybody but he oh church do you realize how blessed you are if he's appeared to you you realize if you know about the message of the hour and and there's something in it that it just strikes your heart say I know that that's true I may you may not have had you might have come out of Darkness you might have come out of a hard family you might have come out of a bad situation but there's something in your heart when the light struck that seed there's something down in there that said I know that I'm a child of God I know that voice speaks to me just like Abraham standing there on the plane of memory and he heard the voice of that one and he said I've heard that voice before I know I'm predestined to believe it and somehow he brought you out of the darkness and brought oh chch I wish somebody preach with me this morning he brought you out of the darkness he brought you out of the mug he brought you out of the M what was it he was revealing himself to you pulling you up out of what you were and bringing you into the message of the hour you said brother Ben I can't understand every little thing about it neither can I but I know I was born to believe it this is who I am I can't deny it to deny it would be to deny who I am Hallelujah I told the church at wles last week preaching over there I I told them I said I don't pause for dramatic effect I pause because I'm fat and it's just you have to catch your breath but I get so excited when I hear when I think about what he's done for us and many times we there's a sermon I was listening to this morning and I don't want to repr preach it because sometimes you listen to things and I was listening to brother bisco brother had bisc preach a sermon called the value of the flaw if you've ever if you need to go back and listen to that if you get a chance on YouTube you can look it up and and of course brother Bisal is older now and able to preach but but you know I I thank God that he allowed him to preach that sermon because he took the message and and showed us that you know we can it depends what our attitude is toward the flaws in our life and what we do with that and so God when he saw the flaw he saw opportunity right he saw opportunity and many times we see the flaw and we see all we see well I'm always going to be this way I'm always this is what I come out of so this is the way I'm always going to be but you're not destined to reproduce that there's something that God wants to do in your life and if God allowed the flaw he did that to gain something from you to to to bring something out of your life and you got to believe that all things work together for the good to them that love God to the called according to his purpose when he saw the flaw when he smoke Jesus on the cross what was he doing oh church he was he was using the flaw to become the Masterpiece right now look you say well I don't I don't understand these things but you know the Lord's coming and how do you know that well we know not that just that he's coming but that he's here in his word he's the same yesterday today and forever look he said they'll say peace and safety when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them now the second coming and and you know your theology may be different about this but I don't look for a for a a depression or a time of hardship that stuff's coming but at the time of the Rapture I think it'll probably be better than it ever was just based on the scripture right things will just probably be swimmingly right and everything politics Will seem like they oh they got it under control and everything's everybody loves everybody right because that's what the Bible says when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail and you can disagree with me on that that's fine I know there'll be we may see a pre-tribulation some things begin to happen as the tribulation nears but we don't go through the tribulation right we we're going in a Rapture but we know it's in an hour that you think not in an hour that'll catch you unawares in an hour that the world's not not looking for something to happen because they say peace and safety that's right and sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child and they shall not Escape but ye Brethren oh my are not in darkness that that day should overtake you as a thief you are all the children of light and the children of the day amen we are not of the night nor of the darkness oh my I said therefore let us not sleep as do others but let us watch and be sober listen in a time when the conditions of the Earth are the same as they were in the days of Noah and lot the son of man would be revealed or made known what was it it's something he he wants to unveil himself and that word reveal then is to if you think about it like this it's literally like there would be a statue and a sculpture has made this statue and and he has uh every little intricate detail if You' seen a great sculpture how every little intricate detail has been carved and then he covers it because he doesn't want it to be seen until the appointed time right because the right people have to be there to witness it he's already seen it he already knows the finished product but he covers it until the appointed hour that they have the unveiling and so they gather everybody together all the critics and all the people that would come in and want to see this wonderful all the fans of this particular sculpture they would they would Gather in and and they would they would watch for the unveiling then he would take the the cloth or whatever was covering the object the uh the sculpture that was standing there and rip it off and when he pulled it off suddenly you can see before what you guessed at yeah now you can see clearly before it was pulled off you might say well that's a that's a that's a statue of Mickey Mouse before it pulled off you might say that was the Statue of Donald Duck I'm getting good response from that so someone might look out there and say that looks like Mickey Mouse that looks like it's got ears on it you know that looks like Donald Duck and that looks like this one or that one before it's unveiled you You Don't See Clearly what it is you can't see the detail of what it is but when it's pulled off then you can see the detail yeah oh my so that's what God was doing in this hour in the hour when the son of man would be revealed who is the son of man is Christ and we'll get into that but the son of man had to be revealed in this day so that we would know the detail of who God is so we could prepare ourselves so we could become that word and we could actually manifest that word around us listen this message is not just hearing this message is doing amen it's not about going to church and paying your ties though I'm I'm grateful that you do I'm glad you go to church I'm glad you pay your ties but that's not what the message came to do the message came for a reason and the message came so that you and I could become that word and peace becomes a reality Joy becomes a reality Faith becomes a reality the Rapture becomes a reality healing becomes a reality what is it it's God manifesting himself oh there's a big difference in the head knowledge and the reality of it expressing it listen in an hour denominational darkness of dogmas and Creeds had veiled him obscured him who is the word so much so we did not even know what to look for right whe whether there would be a Rapture the son of man is revealed to show us Hebrews 138 Jesus Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever the son of man is revealed for the purpose of expressing Christ the same yesterday today in Fe brother R said what is the son of man been revealed Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever now watch in in in the Book of Ezekiel if you go back and again I don't have time this morning to go all into it but Ezekiel uh in Ezekiel God calls his Prophet a son of man he calls him this he said unto me son of man stand upon thy feet and I will speak unto thee and they would have understood that it's very difficult to translate into English but they would have understood that is here is a vessel that God can use here's a flesh son of man den not that it's a it's a man but he's somebody that God's going to use to speak through so God's going to use this body of Flesh and this son of man would be a a prophet this is a son of man a prophet he comes to as a prophet to Abraham but he comes in just a created body right he comes as someone made the point the other night and I it just thrilled my heart you know when he come to Abraham he had to create a body but when he come in our age he didn't have to create a body why Calvary worked right and the blood of Jesus Christ so cleansed a man who was born in sin shaping in iniquity that he could come down in a body of of a prophet right but he didn't just want to stop with the body of a prophet getting ahead of myself but he wants to come down in your body and my body that's the revealing of the son of man but he come as a prophet in a body to Abraham and so we'll get more maybe into that tonight and I'm going to try to preach to you tonight not just teach it but I'm going to try to preach it to you in such a way that we can see it in Abraham now Daniel tells us of the son of man who will reign Daniel 7:13 he said I saw in the night visions behold one like the son of man who came with the Clouds Of Heaven came to the Ancient of Days they brought him near before him there was given him dominion and glory and a kingdom now this man's more than a prophet right this son of man is more than just a an Earthly man this is the son of man from Heaven this is the son of man that that that that God created for this purpose so he's giving him Dominion glory and Kingdom that all people Nations and languages should serve him his Dominion is an everlasting Dominion which shall not pass away his kingdom that which shall will not be destroyed so when Jesus comes and identifies himself as the son of man to the generation he was speaking to they would have been very familiar with the Book of Daniel and know what he was saying if anybody ever tells you that Jesus never calls himself God they don't know what they're talking about yeah right because he identifies himself as the son of man that was his ministry on the earth son of man and then during the church ages he revealed himself Son of God and then during the Millennium he'll be son of David right but he before the Millennium he comes back at the end time that's what Luke 17:30 means that the son of man will be revealed at the end time like he was oh Church like he was in that age think about it Church blessed are your eyes that have seen blessed are your ears that have heard because God came down in your generation yeah and 2,000 years ago he come in a body of flesh called Jesus that was for that purpose of redemption and he come down to redeem us but in this hour he comes down in a redeemed bride body oh church this is more than religion right I think it's time we quit playing church we quit just coming Church to go to church and we quit just going with no passion and no and no foresight and no no looking to see what uh what would might happen no expectation but we just come and say well I just come to church because it's my duty to come to church and I think my family be better if I come to church no we need to come with an expectation God you are revealing yourself in my day look what he did for us he did not just leave us here in stories from 2,000 years ago but he actually come down in our generation and revealed himself you said that don't make a difference to my life it made a difference to those he revealed himself to in his first coming it made a difference to the woman at the well when he revealed himself to her it made a difference to Peter when he revealed himself to him it made a difference to Nathaniel are you with me now I don't know this is strong but it's the truth it's the truth if we can believe it Jesus identified himself as the son of man they would have known he was talking about the one in Daniel look Jesus came into the coast of cesaria Philippi asked his disciples saying whom do men say that I the son of man am and they said some say that thou art John the Baptist so they identified him as a prophet some Elias others jeremias or one of the prophets it's interesting that some would say he was John the Baptist because you had a return Ministry in that day that Doctrine existed in that day because they wanted John the Baptist come it existed in Elijah's day too remember the school of the prophets went looking for Elijah right Elisha finally had to tell him you're not going to find him right well they went looking for his body and they were looking for uh John the Baptist because John the Baptist got his head cut off they said maybe you're John the Baptist reincarnated and some said Elias and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets but he saith unto them but whom say ye that I am and Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art the Christ are you with me this morning it's really important Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God you are not just a son of man yeah you are the son of man and Jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou Simon bar Jonah for Flesh and Blood ha not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven what was he saying the son of man is God in flesh just like Abraham saw him and knew who he was Peter saw him and knew he was God and we know in this hour the son this son of man Christ would be revealed when the world is in a Sodom condition that's Luke 17:30 we believe that brother brandom's Ministry fulfilled Luke 17:30 that that was at least he fulfilled the part of a prophet of a son of man Prophet would come a body that God would use the son of man was revealed in his ministry but he was not the son of man he was a son of man revealing the son of man just like your flesh is not God my flesh is not God but we reveal God by our actions right so brother brandham was not the son of man he said he answered the question some say brother brandham is the son of man they said I thought the pillar of fire was a son of man am I mistaken they were wrong on both counts right remember that's what Peter said Jesus said who do men say that I the son of man am he knew he was the son of man but he had to realize he was the Christ yeah the anointed word are you with me now and so now he said some say brother Brandon was the son of man some thought the pillar of fire he said that's a good question very good but I am not the son of man but a son of man there's quite a difference Jesus Christ was the son of man amen the Son of God the son of man the son of day that's why we don't believe that the message died when brother brandom died that's why we don't believe it's buried in a grave in Jeffersonville but we believe that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday to day and forever he just showed us he showed us what the reality of God's presence would be like that doesn't make a difference it made a difference to them who were touched by it this son of man revealing himself made a difference in my life because I shouldn't be a message believer I I shouldn't be based on what I went through and what and our upbringing my mother shouldn't be sitting here this morning my brother Joel's not here this morning he shouldn't be a preacher today we shouldn't be have anything to do with the message cuz some of the things we've seen I know some of you could Testify the same but the revealing of the son of man in our generation made a difference in our family it made a difference it's not because my family's a bunch of uh you know people that can't get along with people and you wonder why you know I've always tried to be uh be try to be kind to people I do my best to do that church I know sometimes it don't come across that way but I do my best to be kind and reach out and and go to these meetings and be a help to as many people as I can my family is not naturally that way we we don't just do that I'm talking about my father's family and and and and our background they're they're very quiet people and they stay to themselves and they hold grudges against people but I I've been touched by the revealing of the son of man in my generation so that it's changed my outlook on life and the the Holy Ghost in me wants to reach out even when I don't want to even when I think I I just withdraw and start holding grudges and bitterness there's something inside of me won't let me why this revealing of the son of man made a difference in my life it'll make a difference in yours if you let it he come in three sons name he said that's a good question very good but I'm not the son of man but a son of man quite a difference Jesus Christ was the son of man Son of God Son of Man son of David brother brandom even talked about how reluctant he was to even call himself a prophet he said I don't want to call myself anything but your brother I am your brother and you just regard me as brother Bill or brother brandom or whatever you want to do about that he said now that he explains that the pillar of fire is the anointing right the shakina uh he said that Pillar of Fire is the logos that went out of God logos which is actually the attribute of the fullness of God now how many know what the logos is the word right the word it's God in material form God's thought expressed was Christ the word yeah right and and I shouldn't be too deep for us we should be able to to grasp that and so if you have trouble with that brother Brown visualizes like a little light spinning out of that great Eternal one and it's just a part of God but it's the attribute it's not just an attribute like we're an attribute but it's the attribute of the fullness of God the attribute of the fullness of God he said when man was made in the image of God God came down in the image of man to redeem man that brought man and God together heavens and earth hugged and kissed each other I love this language God and man embraced each other as fatherhood and sunship when the logos became flesh and dwelt Among Us so the son of man was Jesus the anointing if we could say it that way or or the spirit the anointing the the pillar of fire was Christ which the the pillar of fire is just the anointing in a visible form now now just hang with me for a moment he said now this logos that was in him which was the spirit of God the anointing through the sanctifying grace of the blood brought many sons to God which is Anointed with what with this same logos I think I put put a picture that Pillar of Fire uh in in in there so what's happening is a son of man standing in the Pulpit like Ezekiel or any of the other prophets would stand there and proclaim the word of God but the the the the Striking thing about the picture is not the man but it's what's above the man right it's not the man so many people get but they did it in Jesus day they get to looking at the man brother said not to do that but he said look look at gu God did you look at the pillar of fire and and think about it think he let that be seen in our day that's a big deal you said God don't care about me he cares a whole lot about you he cares enough about you to let himself be seen he didn't have to do that right listen he come down when he come down in a body of Flesh and he come down and he went by and he showed himself to In Miracles and signs he didn't have to do that he could have just come down and died on the cross but he did it to show who he was he did it to give you Faith to believe who he was because something was about to happen there was going to be a change the Holy Ghost was going to come there going to be a change from the from the Jewish age to the Gentile dispensation to an age of mercy and Grace and so a Grace dispensation was coming and before this change he comes down again oh church he comes down and shows himself to us again you realize that that Pillar of Fire had not been seen with God's Prophet since the days of Paul yeah and before that it was Moses that he was with what was it the same God that was with Moses the same God that was with Paul it's the same God with us today I know the devil doesn't like that but it's the truth now again we don't idolize that man I I don't have to have a picture of it I've seen it right but I'll say this if you've never seen it you probably need to get a coin of with it I'm glad it exists look when Jesus died you can move on to the next scripture Acts 2 and three when Jesus died the fullness of God which dwelt in his body divided into each member of the church so God the the logos came down and split himself up and he's not any less than what he was no more than if you took a spoonful of ocean it' still be the ocean I think can still have all the the attributes in it of the ocean but it would just be a portion right and and what God put in you is God it's deity but it's not all of God because he's in me he's in Peter he's in Sister Lor he's in all of us right that are believers so so he he divided himself and sat down on the congregation the 120 that were there so he divided himself and then from then on every time a person received the true baptism of the Holy Ghost what did they receive a portion of the logos right a portion of the logos brother Brown said do you get it God the logos separating himself into man help me preach this morning I know this is technical but we're going to we're going to get to something in a minute he said God not in one person he's in his church Universal right now he said while God is here speaking with us in our hearts he's in Africa so he wasn't just talking about himself but he said he's in Africa he's in Asia he's in Europe he's in England wherever Believers are gathered together there he is in the midst of them don't tell me it has to be in one place or we all have to listen to a tape at the same time it's nonsense it's nonsense he's not in one person he divided himself into his church Universal amen he said I am not he I am his servant and the pillar of fire is not he it's in spirit form he said which was upon the son of man and has come now to anoint sons of man sons of man to bring back a Ministry just exactly like said it would be in order for the head and the rest of the body to connect together Hallelujah he was bottled up in one man Jesus Christ but not now but he is revealing himself in and through the bride as a part of that revealing of the son of man there had to be a Prophet come a son of man to reveal the son of man brother BR said he said that was the seventh Angel's message opening up the seals what is it not the angel is the son of man but the messenger is revealing the son of man I'm taking it slow so we get it this morning so he said can you get it separated now that's where it seems to be so hard for you he said not the son of man himself but the seventh angel the seventh messenger is revealing to the public the son of man because it's left to shuck he can't organize it it's the grain itself again and we speak of the logos maybe someone wouldn't know what that is that's from John 1 John 1 and one in the beginning was the logos that's what that word means the Greek word is logos the word and the Word was with God that doesn't mean this Bible existed in this form right with God that's not what that means but the logos became the Bible are you with me now he he he come down this is him in print form but this is him amen yeah I hope you hear me today and this is him are you with me now you are him in expression form in body form but in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the word someone say say it with me was God the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him without him was not anything made that was made and then if you go down to verse 14 he says and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth and so if he is the son of man then the revealing of the son of man would be the revealing of the word right because it was the word that existed in the beginning amen he was revealed now remember he was revealed partially in reformers he was revealed partially through church ages but now the full word is to be reserved for a for a son of man to reveal the son of man said but at the opening of The Seven Seals Revelation 10 the full word is to be born into manifestation again I feel I feel like I'm not reaching some of you this Bible was sealed right what was sealed the understanding of it right and that's why go get a commentary and pick any verse and get five commentaries you'll have five different interpretations right because they're doing the best they can right it's not been unveiled that's why and I I you know I don't forgive me for this but we believe we I believe all of the message I believe that brother Brandon was a prophet no matter if it was 1950 or 1965 but there were things that were not revealed to him yet until the opening of the word right because here here the book was closed it wasn't open and and John when he saw it in Revelation he said that book is closed the book of redemption without it being open everything's lost right and so they searched over Heaven they said they said let's find let's search over heaven and find somebody worthy and they looked over heaven and under Heaven they looked at those who had had lived who were living who would live and they said no one is worthy and Sean wept realizing the seriousness of it oh church but his weeping his his mourning was turned into dancing his weeping was turned into rejoicing why because the lamb who is the Lamb how many believe the lamb is Christ right he was the Lamb of God who takes away the that's what John said about him Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world and so you kids can understand this the book was closed and the Lamb of God came who died for our sins and opened the book look that is the word being born into manifestation right but he didn't just open it in letter he didn't just give us a head knowledge of it church but he revealed himself through a body doing the same works that the that the body did in the first place the first time he came he revealed himself this time through a red redeemed body he revealed himself and he wants to reveal himself in us not in a partial way he revealed himself through Lutheran part he revealed himself through Us in part but he wants to reveal himself through Us in every part that's why God won't let you rest and you wonder why do I go through many struggles why do I have so many things happen in my life why is it that these things have to happen it's because of the revealing of the son of man he will not allow you to remain as a partially revealed word he will not allow you to remain as a deformed seed but he's going to bring you back he's going to redeem you he's going to make you ready for a Rapture how does he do that by the revealing of the son of man are you still with me he said in the last days he said it was man back up he said in the full strength as it was when he was here on Earth manifest in the same way he said doing the same things that it did when it was here on Earth he said amen Hebrews 138 he keeps going back to that the revealing of the son of man Luke 17:30 is Hebrews 138 are you with me now Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever Jesus said in the last days as it was in the days of Sodom when the son of man will be revealing himself again it'll be the same thing he was a son of man Prophet revealing the son of man the word so the Rapture would not overtake us as a thief so Luke 21 Jesus told us when he was here Luke 2134 take heed to yourselves take heed you got a responsibility to the word lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting surfeiting is being hung over that's what that word means having a headache from a hangover overcharged with a hangover a leoan hangover you say I don't drink brother Ben that's good what is it binging gorging life the cares of life that's what he says drunkenness surfeiting and cares of this life your heart gets dull heavy oh I hope I I hope I'm preaching to somebody this morning or once you it really thrilled you to hear about the things that God had done but your heart got dull cuz somebody said something they shouldn't have said somebody something they shouldn't have done and you just let it you kind of responded to that in a way well I'm just going to protect myself and so you got dull right oh I pray you'd wake up today you get dull you get overcharged because of something somebody said or something somebody done or too much Netflix right too much TV whatever form that takes today and you just feel yourself getting heavy and he's warning you he said he said I'm going to I'm going to reveal the son of man for the purpose that you won't do that you realize we're too late to hold grudges we're too late to sit there with our mind battle going on it's too late for that you'll find yourself overcharged with that with the cares of life and that day come on you unaware it's not because you never heard the message not because nobody ever preached it to you but you just gorged yourself I I'm preaching to myself today God help me there's so much you know how it is you go I'm just going to be honest with you I'm gonna be real with you you go to read your Bible and a hundred other things happen you go to look at the message on your phone CU that's mostly where I I study during the week and when I sit down I sit down with a computer and study from a computer but on my phone I I'll sit down and just look up quotes and look up scriptures and I just enjoy that and in fact one of the young people got me the other day he said you're talking about us being on our phones you're on your phone all the time they're not wrong but I like to do that but if you're not careful you know an email will come and that's why they tell you at work I don't know brother Allen if you've ever experienced this but there's an email problem at work or there used to be when you first got there if you just go over your emails try to answer them that's all you'll get done that day so they told us take an hour or two hours before you look at your email because you got to get some work done and then when you get your work done then look at your email why because you just get overburdened with putting out fires you can't get nothing done well I wonder church if we could take an hour or two in the morning before we looked at anything else if we just look at the word and say Lord keep me sharp keep me awake make sure that I'm ready I don't want to go with the tribulation I want to be your bride I believe I am your bride but Lord help me to be ready help me to be useful help me to get rid of all these all these things in my life all this listen church I'm telling you it's dangerous to sit there with with a grudge and bitterness and all those things it's a dangerous thing and it and it only hurts you why don't you just let go of it and let God begin to move in your life and let him be real to you again let the son of man be revealed again instead of holding on to things that happen a year ago or 10 years ago or 20 years ago he said but I forgive them then why do you still feel like that let it go that's what he says Watch and Pray always someone say always that you may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass and to stand before the son of man it'll be only by his grace will be able to do that is that right how will we escape this generation by the revealing of the son of man in his body you realize how hard it is how dark it is it's so dark that brother brandom had to take he said what he saw in the vision he saw the Holy Spirit blacked it out completely it's so dark that the darkness we don't even recognize that it's Darkness anymore you know how when you first go into the darkness at night it seems like everything oh it's so dark you can't see but if you stay in it long enough you feel like you can see but you can't see well enough not to fall listen to me Church the Bible says your feet are in Slippery places and without the light of the hour you can't see well enough not to fall then I'm not going to let something keep me out of the house of God I'm not going to let this world I'm not going to let a job I'm not going to let a I'm not going to let situation I'm not going to let a grudge I'm not going to let bitterness keep me from enjoying the presence of God and enjoying the word of God I'm going to live for God with all of my heart why because the son of man has been revealed it's too dangerous of an hour to be walking without any light that's right I want to ask you if the revealing of the son of man is the message of the hour what should our attitude towards the message be huh should be our daily bread yeah what's the message again it's this revealed how we should rever this word we should we should count it as life it's life after the miracle the loe's and the fishes you know them people might have starved out there they've been out there in the desert somebody might have died in a big crowd like that with no way to go to McDonald's or somewhere and get something to eat they might die if they went to McDonald's but anyway they're out there 5,000 of them out there all around the place and they got nowhere to go and Jesus provided from a little boy's lunch you remember the story he provided the Loaves and the fishes till they took up 12 baskets full of leftovers and when Jesus then left and across the sea they went looking for him in John chapter 6 he he he he recognizes that they're just there for the Lo's and the fishes right the potluck potlucks are okay because I got a revelation the other day Elohim invented the potluck the first time he ever come down on a body of Flesh he walked down and had a potluck with Abraham he said I don't know what we're going to have today but it's going to be good boys he created a body for the angel so they could come down with are you with me now so here they but they wanted just a loes and the fishes I want the Loaves and the fishes but I want him I trust that you do too he said you just want the Loaves and the fishes and John 6:27 labor not for the meat which perisheth but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life which the son of man shall give unto you for him hath God the Father sealed other words God given God's given him his authority and they immediately went back to Moses and said we Moses seed we're we're followers of Moses that our fathers did eat Mana in the desert as it is written he gave G them bread from Heaven to eat and then Jesus said to them verily verily I say unto thee you Moses gave you not that bread from Heaven that's a powerful statement Moses didn't give it to you God did right but my father giveth you the true bread from heaven for the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven and giveth life unto the world they said un him Lord ever more give us this bread and Jesus said to them I am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger he that believeth on me shall never thirst you see a thirsting today it's not a lack of food but there's a lack today of meaning of purpose there's a lacking young people who are at the end of their wits and they're about to commit suicide and they think I'm just of no use to the world why they've never found the bread of life they've never found the Water of Life the devil tries to come and say you're nothing he might try to come to you young people and tell you're nothing and you're not worth anything and and you're you're too big or too little or nobody notices you don't you believe that lie of the devil you're part of God's economy he wouldn't have put you here in a message church and give you the parents that he did unless he loved you don't listen to that lie of the devil he cares about you he wants to be your bread he said I am that bread of life I am that bread of life he said I am the living bread verse 51 which came down from heaven If any man eat of this bread he shall live forever and the bread that I will give is my flesh which I will give for the life of the world and the Jews I'll I'll skip down to verse 54 the Jews begin to get begin to argue among themselves that how will this man give us his flesh to eat and his blood to drink and Jesus said unto them verily I said you except you eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you but verse 54 who so eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life and I will raise him up at The Last Day verse 57 as the living father has sent me and I live by the father so he that eateth me even he shall live by me so the message of the hour is the son of man revealed then it's what we live by it's our daily bread it's what it's our whole existence that's why you might you might criticize me say but they been used to many quotes you you feel I'm not exalting a man I'm telling you this is the bread of life when I was in in Egypt I could you couldn't hardly eat the food brother Joel made the mistake cuz he was a rookie of eating the chicken and you don't eat anything hardly overseas maybe fish when you're in that kind of a country because it's very difficult for them to get food standards and safety and things the way we have it so they won't get sick but you will brother Joel got really sick and I didn't lose any weight on that trip despite sleeping with no air conditioning despite sleeping in a room that the door was a rooftop and I could have walked stepped out of my window onto the next door rooftop into the chicken pin and my window was open that's that's the way it was but I found I could eat the bread cuz bread is not so easily defiled church and they'd make bread they don't make bread like we do in a loaf they make bread in kind of like a pea it's like a like a round bread about this big kind of thick fluffy I loved it I probably wouldn't like it here but I loved it there cuz my heart wasn't overcharged with you know with eating too many McDonald's hamburgers right but what did he do what what did he do he or what happened I went and I ate the bread and it provided energy life and I was able to preach cuz I had something to eat oh Church Oh my he said as the living father has sent me and I live by the father so he that eateth me even he shall live by me what is he saying this gives you your energy this give you you know some people when they have a bad week they say well let's not go to church this week no that's the time to go to church that's the time to seek the Lord that's the time to get down on your knees why you live by the bread you live by the dealing of the son of man bread is the most important invention in human history I've got just a few more minutes we'll close by Jesus time it was considered to be a great achievement to be a baker in fact they had a Baker's Guild bread was absolutely essential to life Romans controlled the People by a policy that the poet juvenile I don't know if I'm saying his name right but but he called it bread and circuses it's food and entertainment it's how politicians control people today right you heard politicians talk about price fixing bread and circuses right they just want you to be fed so you won't vote against them France fell because Marie Antoinette may or may not have said let them eat cake but people believe she said it when the people had no bread Bill Clinton the famous philosopher said it this way it's the economy stupid what was it bread and circuses whoever gives you food and entertainment has your vote but I'm looking for I want to vote for something else and it's not wrong to vote I'm not saying that you vote and probably you should vote in this hour day we live in is so scary but I'll say this I'll say this that's not what I'm looking for for salvation it's not what I'm looking for to get me out of here but this is that bread which came down from heaven not as your fathers did eat mana and are dead he that eateth of this bread shall live forever and many of his disciples it's no wonder people can't understand it today many of jesus' disciples when they heard it said this is a hard saying who can hear it and he followed that up and said if that bothers you what will happen when you see me Ascend and and they come back and said from that time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him and then Jesus said to the 12 will you also go away and Simon Peter answered him Lord to whom shall we go thou Hast the words of eternal life how can we leave you when you're our Oasis in the desert how can we leave this message when it's our water that we drink from how can we leave this message when it's our bread that we eat from the reason why it's easy for some people to live is it wasn't their to leave it wasn't their bread in the first place are you with me now amen thou Hast the words of eternal life they we're feeding on those words we live by the word the Bible said wherever the carcass is there will the Eagles be gathered together that's why I use quotes that's why we proclaim the message because I don't have a message of my own but I come to say what a prophet said and to preach to you a message not just to preach to you that's why you can't just get it say well I'll just stay home listen to tapes and I'll never have to hear a preacher no this message was not meant just to be heard but it was meant to be expressed expressed in a preacher expressed in a deacon expressed in a in a person sitting on the Pew and receiving the word of God a Believer saying amen it was meant to be expressed brother Brandon said I wasn't the one that appeared down on the river I was only standing there when he appeared I'm not the one that performs these things and foretells these things that happens as perfect as they are I'm the only one that's near when he does it I was only a voice that he used to say it it wasn't what I knew it's what I just surrendered myself to that he spoke through it isn't me it wasn't the seventh angel oh no it was the manifestation of the son of man it wasn't the angel his message it was the mystery that God unfolded that's why I'm not scared I'm not scared of this message I'm not scared of a prophet I'm not scared of those things because I understand his place it wasn't him it was a message amen it's not a man it's God the angel was not the son of man he was the messenger from the son of man the son of man is Christ he is the one what should our attitude be towards the message feed on it feed on it make it your daily bread What did the what did the mighty Angel tell John when the book was open he said take it and eat it oh take the book you got to take it yourself and eat it he said and in your mouth it'll be sweet as honey but in your belly it'll be bitter but you still eat it because that's what you live by he said you're not the son of man is Christ he's the one you're feeding on you're not feeding on a man man his words will fail but you're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man listen he's my bread he's my joy he's my peace he gets my vote are you with me now we're Eagles we're not Hawks not chickens our diet is the word I'm going to skip past this it's really good but you can go listen to it brother Brandon preached I'm GNA skip several quotes down brother Brandon preached about what an eagle would eat versus what a hawk would eat he talks about a hawk relying on half- Rotten man-made theology in a man-made Sunday school program sheet some educator killed for him in some Seminary tell him the days of Miracles has passed there's no such thing as the baptism of the Holy Ghost all this is nonsense he said you mean to tell me an eagle would eat that he couldn't do it why why couldn't he do it he's got a fresh kill he's not he's not a beggar anymore the son of man has been revealed and where the carcass is the Eagles will be gathered he said neither will a Christian eat on that dead of Karen from old denominational doctrines and things they want the word of God fresh the promise of the hour God promised rabbits the days of Luther he promised other things the days of others but now someone say now he promised us a full Square meal I like that the full seven course menu wouldn't it be terrible if you went to the P looking it could happen you went to the PO looking everybody brought ham boy you're worried now aren't you s man I like him but this is just too much goodness kids walk down there where a sweet sweet had nothing we can eat wouldn't it be terrible kids if there was no soda I mean it just what would you do where would you get the energy for the afternoon service you know you just said it's all ham wouldn't it be terrible if all you had to eat was just a portion of the revealed word are you with me now but that's not what he gave us in our day he didn't give us just ham he didn't give us Just Turkey he didn't give us just mashed potatoes he didn't give us just sweets what did he give us a full seven course menu and every time he got waiters that come and bring it to you and every Sunday you show up every Wednesday whether it's me or brother Stuart or brother Joel or one of these other brothers that preach every every time you come to the house of God here comes another part and you say well they don't sound like you brother B it's because they got a different portion but it's the seven course menu it all goes together to make a full meal for all someone say all the Seven Seals are opened and everything is ready for the word of God to those who can receive oh the Bible says Psalms 348 musicians go ahead and come it said oh taste and see that the Lord is good taste and see that the Lord is good that's what I'm asking you do to this this morning that's what I'm challenging you to do if you're miserable taste and see see that the Lord is good taste and see that the word is Right taste and see that the Lord is good blessed is the man that trusteth in him oh fear the lord ye his Saints for there is no want to them that fear Him the Young Lions do lack and suffer hunger but they that seek the Lord shall not want any good thing other words they won't be lacking any good thing if you could play something softly what is the revealing of the son of man it's pulling the cover off of our food he told the woman at the well I'm the bread of life I'm the Water of Life he said if you drink from me you'll never be thirsty again [Music] sorry I get into stories I I get long but I went to Africa and it seems like when you go overseas some of you that have been brother Mike you know this is true when you go it's impressed in your memory you remember it and if you go overseas you it just stands out to me I went to Africa there was a silver container that was closed on this it was a beautiful place it's very poor we stay in a hotel because it's just the safest place you can stay armed guards on the outside so I'm standing at this hotel and they would have a breakfast every morning but you can't eat very much of it because everything they wash is washed with their water so you can't eat it or you get sick so we couldn't wash anything was cut or eat anything that was cut or had been washed or it was cold so you had to eat something hot so they had these these silver hot serving dishes You' seen them with a cover on them and I was looking forward to whatever was going to be in those in the morning and I'll never forget that first morning down I walked up there and I when I when I come up to the serving dish I oh this is going to be good and I opened it up you know what it was baked beans now that may not sound awful to you I don't eat baked beans at 8:00 in the morning and I thought well maybe the next one will have something else open baked beans there was three or four of them like that what in the world why would you bother hiding that from me but this food was so precious and it was so great he knew we would need it to go in a Rapture so he gives a part to Lutheran a part to Wesley and a part to this one a part to that one but he saved a seven qu meal for my day because he knew I'd be hungry for it he knew I'd need the strength to make it in a Rapture so what does he do he pulls the cover off the table and said go eat Church go eat this is me what should our attitude toward the message be it should not be yesterday's thought it should not be well it's something my parents believe it ought to be every one of us digging into it and believing it and trusting in it Lord speak to me through your word speak to me by the revealing of the son of man speak to me today the same God God brought you in this message for reason Paul sitting down there with a great testimony of how God met him in Africa and God brought him into this message in a foreign land god revealed somebody told him about the message that was a real Christian what was it the son of man being revealed not through the body of a prophet but through the body of that young man that met brother Paul in West Africa are you hearing me today God wants to reveal himself through you and to you he wants you to eat so you can become the revealing of the son of man in your hour Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever would you bow your heads with me [Music] now [Music] church this message can't be just a preacher preaching it's got to be participation you never saw at a restaurant waiters just walking around with food what did you see people eating that food he might use me for a while and then toss me aside but it's the food that's important you may not be able to receive from me but receive the food it's the word of God I challenge you to receive it today let it change you he said but that part's hard well it was in his day too when he said eat the son of man drink his blood they didn't understand it what did they do they said you're the only one that has the words of Life some of you spent years years wandering around in denominations maybe you back left the church you been years trying to fulfill a desire in your heart but you never found fulfillment it didn't fill you up but this will how can you say it brother Ben because he did it to me he did it for me are you struggling today let let the son of man reveal himself to you and what happened the the word is Anointed by his Spirit the holy spirit always anoints the word he wants to anoint you today he wants to change your life I don't mean to make every service an altar call but ought to be if there's something that needs to be changed and I'll say this we either go out better or worse let's go out better today let's let him change our attitude let's let him change our circumstance let's let him change everything about us our reaction to the things of Life say Lord I want to live by the bread of life I live by Your Word Lord I want to live by revealed truth would you just raise your hands St that your desire today if you need prayer we'd be glad to pray with you let's just all pray together now Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we love you with all of our hearts Lord I preach just about as hard

figure of Mickey Mouse or something like that but Lord the cover was unveiled it was you it was lovely Jesus Lord we thank you for that you did not reveal the revealing of the son of man was not the
