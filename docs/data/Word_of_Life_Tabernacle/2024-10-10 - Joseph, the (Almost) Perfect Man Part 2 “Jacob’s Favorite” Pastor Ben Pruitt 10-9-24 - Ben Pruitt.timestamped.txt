[41:23] in Jesus name amen amen amen let's go
[41:28] back to the Book of Genesis Genesis
[41:31] 37 Genesis 37 and3 we're going to talk
[41:34] about Joseph
[41:36] again
[41:37] and tonight we're going to deal with uh
[41:40] Joseph as Jacob's favorite Jacob's
[41:44] favorite Genesis
[41:47] 373 it's good good crowd tonight it's
[41:50] good to have you all on a Wednesday
[41:52] night Genesis
[41:55] 373 says now is Israel loved Joseph more
[41:59] than all his
[42:00] children because he was the son of his
[42:03] old age and he made him a coat of many
[42:07] colors and when his Brethren saw that
[42:10] their father loved him more than all his
[42:13] Brethren they hated him and could not
[42:16] speak peaceably unto him pray the Lord
[42:19] would add his Blessing to the word you
[42:21] may be
[42:24] seated favoritism is the disposition
[42:27] ition to favor Aid and promote the
[42:29] interest of a favorite or of one person
[42:32] or family or of one class of people to
[42:36] the neglect of others having equal
[42:39] claims and I want to you to understand
[42:42] tonight that nothing Jacob or Joseph did
[42:46] especially nothing that Joseph did
[42:48] excuses Joseph's brothers selling him
[42:51] into slavery and lying to their father
[42:54] but it does help explain why a reason is
[42:58] not an excuse there was no excuse for
[43:01] what they did to Joseph and Joseph in
[43:05] fact they hated him without a cause they
[43:07] didn't even know why they hated him but
[43:10] they were fulfilling a type of Christ
[43:12] who was to come who was hated by his
[43:14] Brethren without a cause and yet here
[43:17] was a a young man and and his brothers
[43:20] that hated him and if you look at the
[43:21] family you begin to see that there are
[43:23] reasons why this was going on the way
[43:26] that it was
[43:27] and and it was actually as I said a
[43:29] foreshadowing of God's favor being on
[43:32] Jesus Christ but it still caused
[43:35] problems in the family we know that
[43:37] Joseph's brothers felt like they were
[43:40] second rate because of the attention
[43:43] that was paid to Joseph by Jacob we know
[43:46] that Jacob was a prophet of God a
[43:48] righteous man and he had had many great
[43:51] experiences with God but yet he had
[43:53] trouble at home and that that happens
[43:56] sometimes sometimes we we have trouble
[43:59] even though we're living for the Lord
[44:00] and we're doing everything we can and
[44:02] yet we also see that Jacob at times
[44:05] backslid and did things that were wrong
[44:07] and I think that speaks to all of us as
[44:09] well we've all made mistakes and and
[44:12] God's prophets even in their personal
[44:14] lives sometimes make mistakes and do
[44:17] things that are wrong but the word is
[44:19] never wrong and the word comes to the
[44:21] prophet but sometimes the man can be
[44:23] wrong and so we find that uh Jacob made
[44:27] some mistakes and it actually predates
[44:30] him it goes back to his mother and
[44:32] father because these things usually do
[44:35] and it goes back to Isaac and Rebecca
[44:37] and Genesis
[44:38] 25:27 it says the boys grew speaking of
[44:42] of Jacob and his brother Esau and Esau
[44:45] was a cunning Hunter a man of the field
[44:47] and Jacob was a plain man dwelling in
[44:50] tents and Isaac loved Esau because he
[44:53] did eat of his venison but Rebecca loved
[44:56] Jacob you ever seen a family like that
[44:59] so dad's got his favorite and mom's got
[45:02] her favorite and that favoritism bred
[45:06] jealousy in the in the eyes of the other
[45:08] one because of of them being their
[45:10] favorite so we know that God doesn't do
[45:14] that and we know that it's wrong to play
[45:17] favorites among your children we know
[45:19] that Isaac and Rebecca should have
[45:22] should have treated them both equally
[45:25] because they were both their children
[45:28] now brother brandom even tells us that
[45:30] the reason you can go look it up he said
[45:32] the reason the sign of the son of man
[45:34] had to be shown to the Gentiles is that
[45:36] God treats all his children the same he
[45:39] treats the Jews the same as the
[45:40] Samaritans the same as the Gentiles and
[45:43] so he said that he treated them all
[45:45] equally now I know you know maybe you're
[45:47] thinking in your mind because now we're
[45:49] going to deal with something uh that
[45:51] goes beyond just family relations and
[45:53] you begin to think then if that's so why
[45:56] did God say that he hated Esau you find
[45:59] that in Malachi chapter 3 that he hated
[46:03] Esau these These are wonderful uh
[46:05] whoever's running these the the that's
[46:07] real nice but just turn them down just a
[46:09] little bit I feel like I'm yelling
[46:11] tonight but it sounds real good so he
[46:14] said he said he hated Esau right and and
[46:18] you say well God's playing favorites
[46:20] between Jacob and Esau but he's not and
[46:23] the reason is because they are not both
[46:26] God's children
[46:27] children right one has a seed the other
[46:30] one
[46:30] doesn't now look at Romans chapter 9
[46:33] and: 10 where Paul explains this he said
[46:35] not only this but when Rebecca also had
[46:37] conceived by one even by her father
[46:39] Isaac for the children being not yet
[46:41] born neither having done any good or
[46:43] evil that the purpose of God according
[46:45] to election might stand not of works but
[46:47] of him that calleth it was said unto her
[46:49] the Elder Shall Serve the younger as it
[46:51] is written Jacob have I loved but Esau
[46:55] have I hated so now if you begin to look
[46:58] at that real closely if you were Jacob
[47:01] early on especially in his life you
[47:04] might want to be loved A little bit less
[47:06] by
[47:08] God because Jacob went through some
[47:11] things and he was born second now you
[47:14] know it'd be easy for Jacob to say well
[47:16] God if you love me why didn't you let me
[47:18] be born
[47:19] first right let me get the birthright
[47:22] without having to con my brother out of
[47:25] it right I mean you you kind of think
[47:28] like that if you were Jacob you might
[47:29] think like uh if you've ever seen the
[47:32] play or the film Fiddler on the Roof
[47:34] where where where the star of the of the
[47:37] show the man the Jewish man there is
[47:39] saying he's talking to God as he does
[47:41] throughout the film and he says he says
[47:43] I know I know we're we're your chosen
[47:45] people he said but once in a while can't
[47:47] you choose someone
[47:51] else because the Jews have asked that
[47:53] question over the years why why did you
[47:55] choose us you chose us for suffer uer in
[47:57] you chose us you you you singled us out
[47:59] whenever we say we're your chosen people
[48:01] people get mad and and and they and they
[48:04] uh they persecute us and so why can't
[48:06] you just go choose somebody else but you
[48:08] can't change God's
[48:10] choosing and and material blessings are
[48:13] no sign of God's choosing church
[48:16] sometimes you it's a it's a better sign
[48:18] that you're chosen not because you're
[48:20] materially blessed but because you're
[48:22] going through some things in fact
[48:23] brother brandom tells us and we just
[48:25] read it a few services ago he said that
[48:28] he said that actually the church that
[48:30] isn't suffering hasn't got it I know
[48:33] people are always looking for a reason
[48:35] look at saying well must be something
[48:37] wrong because there's some suffering
[48:38] going on and people are going through
[48:40] some things we don't need to look at it
[48:42] like that God allows those things to
[48:44] perfect our character and to get us
[48:46] ready to leave here because he's much
[48:48] more interested in what in who we really
[48:51] are than he is in our bank account or or
[48:53] even how healthy we are though I believe
[48:55] he's interested in those things but much
[48:57] more interested in our
[49:00] character so material blessings are no
[49:02] sign of
[49:03] election and you see that in The Story
[49:06] of Lazarus and the rich
[49:08] man Romans 9:14 what shall we say then
[49:12] and and the reverse is also True by the
[49:14] way before we get too far down that road
[49:16] just because you're poor don't mean
[49:17] you're
[49:18] elected right just because you're rich
[49:20] don't mean you aren't it's just harder
[49:22] to get to heaven but say Lord give me
[49:25] more hardship
[49:27] but but you know it's true you you can't
[49:30] go by that now look what what do you go
[49:32] by he said what should we say then is
[49:34] there unrighteousness with God in other
[49:36] words it's God a parent who favors one
[49:39] over another God forbid for he sayth to
[49:42] Moses I will have mercy on whom I will
[49:44] have mercy I will have compassion on
[49:47] whom I will have compassion so then it
[49:49] is not of him that willth nor of him
[49:51] that runneth but of God that showeth
[49:53] mercy so being born into a family is not
[49:57] by choice you were born and you were
[49:59] part of that family we were part of
[50:02] God's family in his mind before the
[50:04] foundation of the world and he had a
[50:05] right to have that family now listen
[50:09] they were both Isaac's children Esau and
[50:11] Jacob they were both Abraham's seed but
[50:14] they were not both seed of
[50:16] God so brother brandom says it this way
[50:18] he said way back there too far back for
[50:21] the human mind to grasp the Eternal god
[50:24] with eternal thoughts thought and Creed
[50:27] Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated
[50:29] and neither was born and neither had
[50:31] done good or evil boy I enjoy preaching
[50:34] this because it just tells you how much
[50:36] it's not us that does it but it's God
[50:38] that does it he said see it was the
[50:40] thought and then that thought became
[50:42] expressed and God bought back Jacob Oh
[50:45] my he redeemed Jacob bought him back
[50:48] because Jacob alone was seed Jacob alone
[50:51] had the seed that is why he had respect
[50:53] to the birthright and Covenant of God
[50:55] because he had the seed now watch what
[50:57] is it about you that denotes that you
[50:59] are the elect it's the respect that you
[51:01] have for the birthright and the Covenant
[51:03] of God it's not because you never went
[51:05] through anything it's not because you
[51:07] didn't have a bad past it's not because
[51:09] you you were raised just right and
[51:10] everything went just well in your life
[51:12] no that don't mean that you're the elect
[51:14] but what tells you that you're the elect
[51:16] because there's something in you that
[51:17] won't let you give up you got respect to
[51:19] the birthright you got respect for the
[51:21] Holy Ghost there's something in you that
[51:23] says I must have it no matter what it
[51:25] takes no matter what I got to go through
[51:27] I'm going to be
[51:31] saved and you find yourself like the
[51:33] sarap phenician woman who come to Jesus
[51:35] and she said and he told her he said
[51:38] it's not meat for me to take the
[51:39] children's bread and give it to dogs and
[51:41] she said that's the truth
[51:43] Lord but the dogs eat the crumbs that
[51:46] fall from the master's table so the the
[51:50] elect goes through every obstacle to
[51:53] become elect and I don't want to get too
[51:57] graphic but it works that way in the
[51:58] natural as well that that seed that's
[52:01] going to live overcomes every obstacle
[52:04] to become the
[52:07] person oh church and the seed that's
[52:10] going to live in the in the spiritual
[52:12] realm overcomes every obstacle to become
[52:16] the child of God Amen now this doesn't
[52:19] only apply to Jacob it it applies to us
[52:22] in 2 Thessalonians 21:13 we are bound to
[52:24] give thanks always to God for you you
[52:27] Brethren beloved of the Lord because God
[52:29] hath from where from the beginning yes
[52:33] chosen you so you can say you're God's
[52:37] favorite right but all God's children
[52:41] are his
[52:43] favorites that's right he has chosen you
[52:45] to Salvation through sanctification of
[52:47] the spirit and belief of the Truth where
[52:50] to he called you by Our Gospel to the
[52:53] obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus
[52:56] Christ Christ so his children are chosen
[53:00] they're not
[53:02] accidents right and you need to you know
[53:05] you young people especially you need to
[53:06] quit letting the devil beat you up on
[53:08] that right you're not an accident you're
[53:11] not here by chance you're you're not in
[53:13] church because you just happen to be
[53:15] born in a message family you're you're
[53:17] not serving the lord because things just
[53:19] happen to fall that way and maybe you'd
[53:21] be Buddhist if they didn't but God
[53:23] called you in spite of everything he
[53:25] called you and brought you in the family
[53:27] you were born in and brought you in the
[53:28] church that you come to and did all that
[53:31] to make you his elect you can't help but
[53:33] be the elect of God there's something on
[53:35] the inside of you he has called you what
[53:38] is it he's chosen you from the
[53:40] beginning from the beginning he chose
[53:43] you to be his seed to be his children
[53:45] I'm I'm so glad for that tonight War Two
[53:48] he called you by Our Gospel to the
[53:49] obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus
[53:52] Christ his children are chosen they're
[53:54] the very expression of his mind
[53:58] Ephesians 1:3 blessed be the God and
[54:00] father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has
[54:01] blessed us with all spiritual blessings
[54:05] and Heavenly places in Christ according
[54:07] as he hath chosen listen past tense I
[54:09] know this hard for people to understand
[54:12] but it's important that we understand it
[54:15] right and this is the scripture he has
[54:18] chosen Us in him before the foundation
[54:22] of the
[54:23] world that we should be holy and without
[54:26] blame before him in love having
[54:30] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[54:34] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[54:36] according to the good pleasure of his
[54:39] will to the praise of the glory of his
[54:42] grace wherein he has made us accepted in
[54:45] the Beloved the reason you can go to
[54:47] church and be accepted in the Beloved is
[54:50] because of his choosing he called you he
[54:52] Sanctified you he'll change your body
[54:54] one day you have represent presentation
[54:56] in heaven listen God's not playing
[54:59] favorites he has a family and he's
[55:01] responsible for that
[55:03] family now we think that's strange but
[55:05] you know if you went out to eat you
[55:08] don't pay for the whole restaurant every
[55:09] time you
[55:10] go you might do that once in a while but
[55:14] you you know you you say well God has
[55:16] unlimited resources but he still has a
[55:18] right to have a
[55:20] family and the Plan of Redemption
[55:22] doesn't work unless there's a
[55:24] pharaoh it doesn't work unless there
[55:26] unless there is different a handful of
[55:29] change as brother Brandon put it change
[55:31] in his pocket that he's got some silver
[55:33] dollars some half dollars some quarters
[55:36] some dimes and some pennies and it's all
[55:39] in God's economy and and how does that
[55:42] work why how does God choose well he
[55:44] chooses in himself he chooses in himself
[55:47] it's not anything that you do you don't
[55:49] work your way into that and he has a
[55:52] family and he's responsible for you you
[55:55] say well how do I ever know that I'm
[55:57] part of that family because he doesn't
[55:59] call those who are not part of his
[56:01] family if he's called you he doesn't
[56:03] call God doesn't work like we do he
[56:06] knows
[56:07] everything amen right and he's not
[56:11] calling you
[56:13] hoping that one day respond and sitting
[56:15] there thinking I remember in the wesle
[56:17] church we used to say that well if you
[56:19] if you don't come to the altar your
[56:20] Mansion will be empty in
[56:23] heaven there's not going to be a bunch
[56:25] of vacant mansions in
[56:27] heaven right and that's the Pentecostal
[56:30] doctrine of it is that there you know
[56:32] God just you know he loved everybody but
[56:34] he just he sitting there and just wasn't
[56:36] able God if he wanted
[56:39] to could could save
[56:43] everybody right and yet and yet he does
[56:47] will that no man should perish but
[56:50] there's a difference in his family and
[56:53] those who get to choose life or death
[56:56] that does that make sense and and the
[56:59] truth is on your side on looking at it
[57:02] from our perspective we all get a choice
[57:05] and we all need to make a choice so from
[57:08] our perspective we look at what God is
[57:10] doing us doing to us and we say Lord I
[57:13] see you calling me I see you pulling me
[57:15] I see your word and you said repent and
[57:17] be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[57:18] for the remission of sins I'm going to
[57:20] believe that I'm going to follow that
[57:21] and what does that do for you that means
[57:23] you're
[57:24] saved believe on the name of the Lord
[57:26] Jesus Christ thou and thy house shall be
[57:28] saved what is he saying you're saved but
[57:30] you I don't want to get bogged down in
[57:32] this but I feel a little bit you know I
[57:33] feel like we don't understand it like we
[57:35] should I feel like I don't understand it
[57:36] like I should but but God's not playing
[57:38] favorites God is saying that if you come
[57:41] to him when he calls you you are you are
[57:44] his and yet there will be many others
[57:47] that have a different part in his
[57:48] economy so we don't we don't look at
[57:50] other people as if well you're just a
[57:52] dog or you're just a uh you're just a uh
[57:55] you're just Canon F or something like
[57:57] that though it may actually be true we
[57:59] don't look at it that way we don't know
[58:00] who is seed and who is not and we don't
[58:02] know who's going to be in heaven and who
[58:03] is
[58:04] not right I don't want to get into that
[58:07] tonight but there'll be many people that
[58:08] are not seed of God that'll be in heaven
[58:11] ask me how I
[58:13] know how do you know brother Ben because
[58:15] the prophet of God said so and the Bible
[58:18] said so right he separated the sheep
[58:21] from the
[58:22] goats many people who come to the white
[58:25] Throne judgment be saved and mean it'll
[58:27] be
[58:28] lost Luke
[58:30] 15:4 says it this way and I want to just
[58:32] Hammer this point home and then we'll
[58:34] move on he said what man of you having a
[58:36] hundred sheep if you lose one of them do
[58:39] not leave the 90 and N in the wilderness
[58:41] and go after that which is lost till he
[58:42] find it now look at the picture I know
[58:44] this is always preached as as going out
[58:47] after the Lost Sinner and that's true
[58:50] but look they were his to begin with he
[58:53] had 100 it's a number
[58:56] right he didn't have 101 he didn't have
[58:58] 999 he had
[59:01] 100 right and so he has 100 sheep and
[59:05] let's say that I'm one of those sheep or
[59:06] you're one of those sheep and the other
[59:09] 99 doing pretty good but we get out in
[59:10] the weed somewhere get
[59:13] lost right we're lost as far as our
[59:17] perspective we're lost but now look what
[59:20] he say he goes after that which is lost
[59:22] until he find it and when he has found
[59:25] it when he has found found it not that
[59:26] the Sheep if makes its way back to the
[59:29] fold but it's the
[59:32] shepherd who goes out and gets the sheep
[59:36] in the oh that's my story in the
[59:39] condition that it's in and he goes out
[59:41] into the Wilderness and he finds the
[59:43] sheep in their lost condition and he
[59:45] grabs a hold of it puts it on his
[59:47] shoulders oh which is the strongest part
[59:50] of him amen and when he and rejoicing
[59:53] and when he cometh home he calleth
[59:54] together his friends and neighbors
[59:55] saying unto them Rejoice with me not
[59:58] that I for I have not added to my
[1:00:02] Sheepfold I have not found another sheep
[1:00:06] found someone
[1:00:07] willing are you with me now but he said
[1:00:10] I have found my
[1:00:13] sheep one of the
[1:00:16] 100 which was lost we're his sheep even
[1:00:20] before we were
[1:00:22] saved right John 17 And1 boy I don't
[1:00:26] have time to get into all this tonight
[1:00:27] we may have to cut some of this off John
[1:00:30] 17:1 we haven't gone very far but we got
[1:00:32] a lot to go but I I don't ever hold you
[1:00:34] long on Wednesday and I won't tonight
[1:00:36] Lord
[1:00:37] willing praise the Lord that ought at
[1:00:39] least got a chuckle out of
[1:00:41] you John 17:1 let's look at this just
[1:00:44] the plain words of scripture these words
[1:00:46] spake Jesus lifted up his eyes to heaven
[1:00:48] and said father the hour is come glorify
[1:00:50] thy son that thy son Also may glorify
[1:00:52] thee as thou has given him Power Over
[1:00:55] All Flesh
[1:00:57] that he should give eternal
[1:00:59] life listen to this this is strong meat
[1:01:03] to as many as thou Hast given
[1:01:06] him the 100 are you with me now or
[1:01:11] whatever number is in God's mind we
[1:01:13] don't know what that is but however many
[1:01:15] are in God's mind he said he said you
[1:01:18] will give eternal life to his many as
[1:01:20] thou Hast given him and this is life
[1:01:22] eternal that they may Know Thee the only
[1:01:25] true God in in Jesus Christ whom thou
[1:01:27] Hast sent I have glorified thee on the
[1:01:29] earth I have finished the work which
[1:01:32] thou gavest me to do and now oh Father
[1:01:36] glorify thou me with thine own self with
[1:01:38] the glory which I had with thee before
[1:01:40] the world was manifested thy name again
[1:01:43] unto the men which thou gavest me out of
[1:01:45] the world so there's a separation he
[1:01:48] said you gave me some men out of the
[1:01:51] world thine they
[1:01:53] were Peter was God
[1:01:57] right when he was in the boat fishing
[1:01:59] before he met
[1:02:00] Jesus thine they were and thou gavest
[1:02:04] them me and they have kept Thy word now
[1:02:09] they have known that all things
[1:02:11] whatsoever thou H has given me are of
[1:02:13] thee so in other words I can't give them
[1:02:15] eternal life unless they come from
[1:02:17] you are you with me now he said for I
[1:02:21] have given unto them The Words which
[1:02:22] thou gavest me and they have received
[1:02:24] them you want to know what the evidence
[1:02:26] of the Holy Ghost is there it is and I
[1:02:28] have known surely that I come out from
[1:02:30] thee and they have believed that thou
[1:02:32] did send me I pray for them this is a
[1:02:36] startling statement I pray not for the
[1:02:39] world right but for them which thou has
[1:02:42] given me for they are thine that's not
[1:02:45] favoritism it's God choosing a
[1:02:48] family John 1712 he said while I was
[1:02:51] with them in the world I kept them in my
[1:02:52] name or in thy name those that thou
[1:02:54] gavest me I have kept kept and none of
[1:02:56] them is lost but the son of predition
[1:02:58] that the scripture might be fulfilled
[1:03:00] none of them is lost he said these are
[1:03:02] my
[1:03:04] responsibility are you with me now so
[1:03:07] it's not possible for us as finite
[1:03:09] beings to go out and pay for everybody's
[1:03:12] meal every time we go out to eat it's
[1:03:13] not possible but there are those that
[1:03:15] we're responsible for and God has those
[1:03:18] that are his responsibility even though
[1:03:20] he cares for all he sends the sunshine
[1:03:22] on the elect and the non-elect right he
[1:03:25] sends the the rain and and the ability
[1:03:27] to eat and and the ability to even have
[1:03:29] a good life that if they follow the uh
[1:03:32] if they follow the tenants of scripture
[1:03:33] you realize that even the non-elect if
[1:03:35] they paid tithes if they if they if they
[1:03:37] had a moral life and a good life they
[1:03:39] would be blessed in that right because
[1:03:41] of doing that they'd be blessed even for
[1:03:44] helping the elect they'd be blessed for
[1:03:46] being a being a being a good person or
[1:03:49] something like that they'll be blessed
[1:03:51] in this life though they may be lost in
[1:03:52] the end right but they'd be blessed in
[1:03:55] this life and there'll be even some
[1:03:56] saved in the end but but it isn't
[1:03:59] favoritism for him to say I I'm just
[1:04:01] going to I'm going to just take care of
[1:04:03] my own family in this way it's not that
[1:04:06] he's favoring one child over another but
[1:04:08] some of them are his children and some
[1:04:09] of them are not but among his children I
[1:04:12] want you to understand this tonight
[1:04:13] we're all the same yeah right yes right
[1:04:17] Galatians 3:26 for you are all the
[1:04:19] children of God by faith in Christ
[1:04:22] Jesus right so we are not there's no
[1:04:25] difference
[1:04:26] in God's children what does that tell me
[1:04:28] it tells me that if Peter prays and asks
[1:04:31] God for healing he can receive it right
[1:04:34] if if if one brother Paul prays and ask
[1:04:36] God for healing or for the Salvation of
[1:04:38] his children he receives it by faith the
[1:04:40] same as anybody else does right right
[1:04:42] because we are the children of God by
[1:04:44] faith for as many of you as have been
[1:04:46] baptized into Christ have put on Christ
[1:04:48] there is neither Jew nor Greek there is
[1:04:51] neither Bond nor free there's neither
[1:04:53] male nor female for you you are all one
[1:04:55] in Christ Jesus and if you be Christ
[1:04:57] then are you Abraham's seed and airs
[1:04:59] according to the promise so in God when
[1:05:01] it comes to our Salvation now we're not
[1:05:03] talking about our different pasts we'll
[1:05:05] look at that in just a minute maybe but
[1:05:07] we're not talking about our our gifts or
[1:05:09] things we do or things we're allowed to
[1:05:12] do we're talking about in Christ we're
[1:05:14] all the same if you're a seed of God you
[1:05:18] have as much of God's uh favor as any
[1:05:21] other seed of God so it's not like
[1:05:24] Joseph is is the favored one and you're
[1:05:26] one of the others but Jesus came and
[1:05:28] died not so he could just remain the
[1:05:31] favored but so that you and I could be
[1:05:33] favored as well and Joseph's Brethren
[1:05:35] didn't understand this they didn't
[1:05:37] understand that Joseph wasn't being the
[1:05:39] favorite he wasn't being made the
[1:05:41] favorite because uh by pharaoh and even
[1:05:44] by potier and even in the prison he
[1:05:46] wasn't made the favorite because these
[1:05:47] men just had partiality he was made the
[1:05:50] favor because God had a future use that
[1:05:52] was actually going to be to their
[1:05:54] salvation and you were made God's
[1:05:56] favorite as the elect to be a a help to
[1:05:59] the world around you to be a blessing to
[1:06:02] God's people to be a blessing even to
[1:06:04] the world even those who are the
[1:06:06] non-elect Christ was made his favorite
[1:06:08] so that he could bring many
[1:06:10] sons are you with me
[1:06:13] now brother Brenham said I I say it
[1:06:16] humbly before my little church like this
[1:06:17] I couldn't say it out in big meetings
[1:06:18] because they'd pick at it and so forth
[1:06:21] but as a Seer who God shows Visions he
[1:06:23] said that's not makes me any more than a
[1:06:25] drunkard that was converted 10 minutes
[1:06:27] ago
[1:06:28] somewhere now we wouldn't
[1:06:31] listen to a drunkard that was converted
[1:06:33] 10 minutes ago
[1:06:36] preach that's just the truth brother
[1:06:38] brand said we don't believe in
[1:06:39] that right that's right but he's just
[1:06:43] just as much a Christian as anybody
[1:06:45] else that's right he's a Christian the
[1:06:47] same as I am go to the same Heaven enjoy
[1:06:50] the same blessings and things that I
[1:06:51] would or anybody else there's no great
[1:06:54] people and big people the kingdom of God
[1:06:56] we're all one try everybody just the
[1:06:58] same person brothers and sisters you say
[1:07:01] well I know more than everybody else
[1:07:02] well praise God God must have given you
[1:07:05] an extra special gift of knowledge share
[1:07:07] it with somebody help somebody else with
[1:07:09] it because if it doesn't help anybody it
[1:07:11] doesn't do any good it's not doing you
[1:07:12] any
[1:07:13] good right he said whether we're yellow
[1:07:16] black white whatever we are We Are One
[1:07:17] in Christ Jesus there's no DD dou L's
[1:07:19] and little bitty fellow deacons and
[1:07:22] janitors right maybe that's the same
[1:07:24] person sometimes
[1:07:26] but whatever they are they're all the
[1:07:27] same in Christ
[1:07:29] Jesus right we we get we listen I don't
[1:07:32] like to see I don't like to see a divide
[1:07:35] and and I'm just telling you my heart I
[1:07:37] don't like to see a divide between those
[1:07:38] that have money and those that
[1:07:40] don't those that those that have bet
[1:07:42] good clothes and those that don't I
[1:07:45] don't like to see that we were we're one
[1:07:47] in Christ Jesus those of us who have
[1:07:49] been blessing to help those who are less
[1:07:51] fortunate because we're one in Christ
[1:07:53] Jesus we're not one above the other
[1:07:55] that's why we're brother and sisters in
[1:07:56] the Lord Jesus Christ now that doesn't
[1:07:58] mean we all have the same job or the
[1:08:00] same calling because gifts and callings
[1:08:02] are without repentance but when it comes
[1:08:03] to the promises whatever God did for one
[1:08:06] of his children he'll do it for
[1:08:09] you amen I'm not Abraham but I believe
[1:08:13] God's my
[1:08:14] provider right I'm not Abraham but I
[1:08:17] believe he's still Jehovah Gyra I'm not
[1:08:19] Paul but I believe God still saves a
[1:08:22] person who's going the wrong direction
[1:08:23] and pulls him out and and turns him in
[1:08:26] another Direction I'm not any of these
[1:08:28] men I'm not Joseph but if I'm thrown in
[1:08:30] a pit I believe God's going to bring me
[1:08:31] out of it because God treats all of his
[1:08:35] children the
[1:08:37] same Isaac's favoritism was wrong
[1:08:39] Jacob's was worse because Jacob and
[1:08:42] we're going to turn a corner we just
[1:08:44] headed down one way and I'm going to
[1:08:45] turn the
[1:08:47] car go the other
[1:08:49] direction Jacobs was worse he had a
[1:08:52] favorite wife
[1:08:58] we find Jacob serving seven years for
[1:09:00] Rachel you all know the story Leah was
[1:09:02] no fault of her own by the way her
[1:09:04] father did it tricked Jacob as Jacob had
[1:09:08] tricked so many people in the past and
[1:09:11] her father had come around to bite him
[1:09:12] her father tricked Jacob into marrying
[1:09:16] Leah instead of Rachel knowing he could
[1:09:18] get Jacob to work longer for Rachel and
[1:09:21] Jacob loved Rachel so much they seemed
[1:09:23] into him but a few days for the love he
[1:09:26] had to her now look polygamy was legal
[1:09:29] in those days it's not today it was
[1:09:32] legal but it wasn't
[1:09:34] good it was never good for the family
[1:09:37] why
[1:09:38] favoritism there was always going to be
[1:09:40] one that was the favorite that's why we
[1:09:42] teach marriage between one man and one
[1:09:45] woman for
[1:09:47] eternity right and I know Church it gets
[1:09:50] gets real quiet when you talk about
[1:09:51] marriage and divorce but it shouldn't
[1:09:53] because we've been given Grace in our
[1:09:55] day and hour no matter what our past has
[1:09:57] been God God gave us Grace he told us he
[1:09:59] said stay as you are right don't do that
[1:10:02] thing again right teach your children
[1:10:04] the
[1:10:05] truth but listen to what he said about
[1:10:07] it he said first before the beginning
[1:10:08] from the beginning there was just one in
[1:10:10] one I told you we were turning a sharp
[1:10:12] corner but we're going somewhere he said
[1:10:15] after the sin came in then there was one
[1:10:17] man and a bunch of women he said run
[1:10:19] that way in nature every animal human
[1:10:20] being is in natural flesh is animal we
[1:10:22] are mammal we know that all of us see he
[1:10:24] said it's all all God's nature and
[1:10:26] continuity but
[1:10:29] now you see the you see where what he's
[1:10:31] taking you to but now that the seals are
[1:10:34] open it's a continuation of the same
[1:10:36] quote he said the spirit of Truth
[1:10:40] directs us to the word yes right that's
[1:10:43] what Jesus was doing when the Pharisees
[1:10:45] asked him is it lawful for a man to put
[1:10:46] away his wife for any reason he said in
[1:10:48] the beginning God made them male and
[1:10:50] female in the beginning God made one and
[1:10:53] one right now look he said he said that
[1:10:56] explains why all the mistakes has been
[1:10:59] down to the ages because the seals was
[1:11:02] not opened this was not revealed so
[1:11:06] those that don't believe the seals are
[1:11:07] open I guess they can go
[1:11:09] ahead but for those of us who believe
[1:11:11] the seals are open we're going back one
[1:11:15] man and one woman right yeah well we're
[1:11:17] not all the way back because there will
[1:11:19] comeing time we're going to be in
[1:11:20] redeemed bodies new bodies we want to
[1:11:21] worry about none of this stuff no more
[1:11:23] but let while while we're here I believe
[1:11:25] we're still here we come to a place of
[1:11:27] maturity where we don't have to be going
[1:11:28] around men are not creatures that are
[1:11:31] just you know they just have to lust and
[1:11:33] they have to run after women and they
[1:11:35] have to cheat on their wives and commit
[1:11:36] adultery on no that that's
[1:11:39] nonsense right we we don't we're not
[1:11:41] animals anymore we're not we're not
[1:11:43] something controls that animal nature
[1:11:46] right the human part may be like an
[1:11:48] animal it may be a mammal but there's
[1:11:49] something inside of you that controls
[1:11:51] that you don't have to give in to that
[1:11:54] just cuz you're a man you can live
[1:11:56] honest and right with your wife and and
[1:11:58] stay with her and I'll tell our young
[1:12:01] people again that we believe in one man
[1:12:03] and one woman for
[1:12:07] eternity and you treat that person
[1:12:09] different if you believe that's the only
[1:12:10] one you ever get a chance
[1:12:15] with there's commitment
[1:12:18] there it's a message of Grace though I'm
[1:12:20] so glad for that but God took notice of
[1:12:23] how Leah was treated because there's
[1:12:24] unfairness
[1:12:26] partiality right and again I say one man
[1:12:28] one woman for eternity but Paul explains
[1:12:31] it if spouse dies obviously if you're a
[1:12:33] widow or widower you got a right to get
[1:12:35] remarried on in this life and ask me how
[1:12:38] that works in heaven I'm not
[1:12:40] sure brother brandom tells a story about
[1:12:42] a dream he had about it but it just not
[1:12:45] real clear to me but somehow or another
[1:12:46] brother brand say if you get the wrong
[1:12:47] one you'll end up with the right one I
[1:12:48] don't know how that works say brother
[1:12:51] Ben which one's the right one right now
[1:12:52] the One You're With
[1:12:55] guarantee you
[1:12:59] that but again don't let that you you
[1:13:01] know makes us feel bad sometimes I know
[1:13:03] many times good people Holy Ghost filled
[1:13:05] people because they've had problems in
[1:13:06] their marriage they feel bad about that
[1:13:08] I say God God give you a a spirit of
[1:13:10] Grace that you can say Lord I accept the
[1:13:12] grace of this
[1:13:14] message that brought me out because I
[1:13:16] didn't know any better but now I know
[1:13:18] better and I'm a saved as anybody else
[1:13:21] are you with me
[1:13:22] now now look
[1:13:25] Leah ends up having six Sons and a
[1:13:27] daughter because God opens Leah's womb
[1:13:30] because he sees the favoritism towards
[1:13:32] Rachel and Leah had six Sons and a
[1:13:34] daughter and they had four other Sons
[1:13:36] born to concubines because the family
[1:13:38] was just a
[1:13:39] mess and there's competition going on
[1:13:42] between the women right thank God for
[1:13:45] only one
[1:13:47] wife and finally two sons are born to
[1:13:51] Rachel Genesis 30:22 God remembered
[1:13:54] Rachel and God hearkened to her and
[1:13:56] opened her womb and she conceived and
[1:13:58] bear a son and said God had taken away
[1:14:01] my reproach and she called his name
[1:14:03] Joseph and said the Lord shall add to me
[1:14:06] another son and she ended up having
[1:14:08] another son Rachel died tragically in
[1:14:10] child birth with Benjamin so you can see
[1:14:13] why Jacob especially after Rachel died
[1:14:16] was so partial to Joseph so we go back
[1:14:19] to the original scripture Israel loved
[1:14:21] Joseph more than all his children
[1:14:23] because he was a son of his old age and
[1:14:24] he made a coat of many colors brother
[1:14:28] Brandon said when he was born his father
[1:14:30] loved him he made him a coat of many
[1:14:32] colors now there's only seven perfect
[1:14:33] colors in in all colors all others are
[1:14:36] made off those colors and the coat PRS
[1:14:38] had colors in it of seven different
[1:14:40] colors Stripes of colors into the coat
[1:14:42] that the father made he said if you
[1:14:44] notice maybe Jacob didn't understand
[1:14:46] that at the time but that signified
[1:14:48] promised one right he didn't understand
[1:14:51] that his brother their brother may not
[1:14:52] even understood why they hated him so
[1:14:54] much and Jacob didn't understand why he
[1:14:56] was the favorite but he gave him a Cod
[1:14:58] of Many Colors which was a type of
[1:14:59] Christ who wore God's rainbow colors we
[1:15:02] find him in Revelation 43 he that set up
[1:15:04] was to look upon him like a Jasper and a
[1:15:06] sarden stone there was a rainbow round
[1:15:08] about the throne and sight like unto an
[1:15:09] emerald a rainbow brand said the reason
[1:15:12] it went round about The Throne because
[1:15:13] on Earth we only see half of it right
[1:15:15] but he said the half has never yet been
[1:15:18] told right so around the throne there's
[1:15:20] a there's a circle of a rainbow and
[1:15:22] again Revelation 10:1 he said I saw
[1:15:24] another Angel come down from heaven
[1:15:26] clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was
[1:15:28] upon his head that's why we know that's
[1:15:29] not brother brandom right it's Christ
[1:15:32] and brother BR says only Christ it could
[1:15:34] be why a rainbow was upon his head and
[1:15:37] his face was as were the sun his feet as
[1:15:39] pillars of fire and so the seven colors
[1:15:41] of the rainbow red orange yellow green
[1:15:44] blue indigo and violet seven colors for
[1:15:47] the seven spirits of God I know I'm
[1:15:48] going fast here but you can go back and
[1:15:50] look all this up seven Messengers seven
[1:15:52] Church agents to bring Redemption of the
[1:15:55] Gentiles and like a great Diamond those
[1:15:57] colors reflected the character of Christ
[1:16:01] brother brand said there's your seven
[1:16:02] colored rainbow he was bruised for our
[1:16:03] iniquity what was the coat of many
[1:16:05] colors a type of what God was going to
[1:16:07] do through Jesus Christ he said he was
[1:16:10] bruised for our iniquity the
[1:16:11] chastisement of our peace was upon him
[1:16:13] and he said they bruised him and mashed
[1:16:15] him and cut him he might reflect through
[1:16:17] his dying wounds forgiveness of sin joy
[1:16:19] peace long-suffering goodness meekness
[1:16:22] gentleness the seven spirits of God he
[1:16:24] said are the seven fruits of the spirit
[1:16:25] that would reflect back in his people so
[1:16:28] what is that you're reflecting the
[1:16:29] rainbow of God every time you reflect
[1:16:31] joy and peace and Longs suffering and
[1:16:33] goodness and meekness and gentleness
[1:16:35] you're actually reflecting God so he
[1:16:38] said the seven spirits of God are the
[1:16:39] seven fruits of the spirit he said that
[1:16:41] that he was bruise shaped and form that
[1:16:43] the light of God shining through that
[1:16:45] one man's body might redeem oh my the
[1:16:48] whole world he said I'll be lifted up
[1:16:49] from the earth and I'll draw all men
[1:16:52] unto me Joseph was just the type I'm so
[1:16:55] glad for the anot type I'm so glad we
[1:16:57] have the reality in Christ that Jesus is
[1:17:01] the promised son he is God's favorite
[1:17:03] loved by his father hated by his
[1:17:05] Brethren yet bringing forgiveness and
[1:17:07] Redemption to them by his suffering at
[1:17:09] their hands oh
[1:17:13] my now we're going to turn
[1:17:16] again and this is the last time I
[1:17:19] promise I don't often preach like this I
[1:17:21] try to keep it together this brother
[1:17:23] Joel you can take this sermon do
[1:17:24] something with it
[1:17:26] but I want to change Focus again we're
[1:17:28] still talking about favoritism you know
[1:17:30] every one of your children is
[1:17:33] different I don't have to tell some of
[1:17:35] y'all that you know
[1:17:37] that some of us know that because we are
[1:17:42] different did you know Napoleon bonapart
[1:17:44] had if I'm saying that correctly had had
[1:17:46] an older brother named Joseph who stole
[1:17:50] the crown jewels of Spain and lived in
[1:17:52] New Jersey
[1:17:55] lived off the money anybody know that we
[1:17:58] don't hear much about his older brother
[1:17:59] they're
[1:18:01] different Napoleon tried to make his
[1:18:03] brother king of Spain and it didn't work
[1:18:05] he's one of the worst kings
[1:18:07] ever Napoleon one of the greatest as far
[1:18:10] as the world is concerned and his
[1:18:12] brother one of the worst Al Capone I'm
[1:18:15] not talking about Joel tonight so just
[1:18:18] actually these are older brothers so
[1:18:20] maybe it's me that's Joseph on a
[1:18:23] part you don't have to agree with
[1:18:27] that do you kids know Al Capone you know
[1:18:29] who Al Capone
[1:18:30] is you kids don't know who Al Capone is
[1:18:33] that's too old he was a he was a a
[1:18:36] gangster back in the days of the
[1:18:38] Bootleggers he sold whiskey for money
[1:18:41] when whiskey was illegal it ought to
[1:18:42] still be
[1:18:43] illegal but but that's what he did he
[1:18:45] was a bootlegger and a gangster killed a
[1:18:47] lot of people he had a brother named
[1:18:49] James who was a Prohibition agent
[1:18:55] kids are
[1:18:58] different I Isaac
[1:19:01] and Esa right R and and Jacob and and
[1:19:06] Esau rather and and Joseph and his
[1:19:08] brothers kids are
[1:19:11] different Donald Nixon ran drive-ins in
[1:19:14] California wasn't as popular as his
[1:19:16] famous Brother
[1:19:17] Richard who was president but his his
[1:19:20] tenure ended a lot
[1:19:22] better than Richards did
[1:19:25] why would we expect kids to be the
[1:19:28] same right now so so our kids are
[1:19:32] different but we love them all the
[1:19:35] same right and that doesn't mean we
[1:19:37] treat them in the same way necessarily
[1:19:40] we treat them all with the same amount
[1:19:42] of love right but we've got to deal with
[1:19:44] them I should say it that way we deal
[1:19:46] with them differently the Bible tells us
[1:19:48] because I want to make this very
[1:19:49] practical before we go tonight the Bible
[1:19:51] tells us that we should train up a child
[1:19:54] in the way he should go and when he's
[1:19:56] old he'll not depart from it in fact the
[1:19:59] Amplified version says it this way train
[1:20:00] up a child in the way he should go and
[1:20:03] in keeping with his individual gift or
[1:20:06] bent and when he's old he'll not depart
[1:20:08] from it that word way is actually the
[1:20:11] word for a a piece of wood that was
[1:20:13] curved in the right direction to make a
[1:20:15] bow out
[1:20:16] of right some wood was suitable for
[1:20:19] making a bow and some wood is not
[1:20:22] suitable for forming into a bow it still
[1:20:25] needed training it still needed shaping
[1:20:28] so he said shape them up train them up
[1:20:30] that's our job but we don't change who
[1:20:32] they are right some kids are different
[1:20:36] there are children they're not
[1:20:38] burdens though it may feel like it
[1:20:41] sometimes but they're not burdens
[1:20:44] they're are
[1:20:46] children brother Brandon says I know we
[1:20:48] all want to think our kids is Renegades
[1:20:50] and things like that but we must stop
[1:20:52] that
[1:20:54] huh I don't think we got too much
[1:20:56] problem thinking our kids are Renegades
[1:20:58] but if you
[1:20:59] do stop that said I believe that we must
[1:21:03] remember that these kids are the best
[1:21:05] kids in the
[1:21:08] world right and we should think about
[1:21:10] our kids that way even our older
[1:21:13] kids right now why are they the best
[1:21:15] kids in the world because they're our
[1:21:18] [Music]
[1:21:19] children that's not partiality you got a
[1:21:22] right to have a family do you see how it
[1:21:23] goes back to election
[1:21:25] they're the best kids in the world
[1:21:26] because they're are
[1:21:27] children are you with me now I I told
[1:21:30] you a while back I don't have the luxury
[1:21:32] of my children going out and leaving and
[1:21:34] running out and in the world and doing
[1:21:36] that I don't have that luxury they're my
[1:21:37] children you guys can look at that and
[1:21:39] say Well they're going to go this
[1:21:40] they're going to become this they're
[1:21:40] going to do that they're going to be
[1:21:42] lazy they're not never going to get a
[1:21:43] job they're going to do that you have
[1:21:44] the luxury of saying that in the current
[1:21:46] trajectory excuse me may look like that
[1:21:48] but I'll say this that that's not what's
[1:21:50] how it's going to end up I don't have
[1:21:51] the luxury of it ended up that way these
[1:21:53] are my children they're the best kids in
[1:21:55] the
[1:21:56] world cuz they're my kids are you with
[1:22:00] me now we should all look at our kids
[1:22:01] that way we should look at our kids in
[1:22:03] the church that way you kids know you're
[1:22:05] the best kids in the
[1:22:09] world
[1:22:12] right and next time you pull that quote
[1:22:14] out you guys know how to get
[1:22:16] quotes boy we're going to have a class
[1:22:19] on how to look up quotes get you an app
[1:22:21] and you can look up quotes my daughter
[1:22:23] does that to me every time we have have
[1:22:24] a
[1:22:26] disagreement she has learned that I am I
[1:22:29] am susceptible to
[1:22:33] quotes I told you that story about her
[1:22:35] and them talking too late and I got so
[1:22:37] upset and I was going to go in there and
[1:22:39] and and and set some order in the house
[1:22:41] and and uh she told me she said well
[1:22:44] Melody asked me a question about what
[1:22:45] she said tonight and I was just
[1:22:46] answering
[1:22:50] it but but brother brand you got a quote
[1:22:53] says you're the best kids in the world
[1:22:55] you ought to believe that and act like
[1:22:59] it so brother Caleb shouldn't have to
[1:23:02] yell at you to stay out of the highway
[1:23:04] right now he will if he has
[1:23:07] to right but but stay out of the highway
[1:23:09] you're the best kids in the world why
[1:23:10] would you go out there and get hit by a
[1:23:13] truck right he said because there are
[1:23:16] children we think like that and we claim
[1:23:19] them for
[1:23:20] God he said now your salvation will not
[1:23:23] save that child they got to have their
[1:23:24] own
[1:23:25] salvation right their your salvation
[1:23:28] will not save that child he said but now
[1:23:32] Paul said believe on the Lord Jesus
[1:23:33] Christ and thy and thy house should be
[1:23:34] saved now what did he mean by that he
[1:23:36] didn't mean because they were saved that
[1:23:37] their house would be saved with it he
[1:23:39] meant this that because if he had enough
[1:23:41] Faith to be saved himself his same
[1:23:43] amount of faith that he had for himself
[1:23:45] would work for his children so the way
[1:23:47] that I believe for myself do I believe I
[1:23:49] can be lost
[1:23:50] no and that does not make me want to go
[1:23:53] out and sin because I believe I can't be
[1:23:56] lost I'm going to do everything I can to
[1:23:57] not be
[1:23:59] lost right and that's what a true
[1:24:02] revelation of predestination election
[1:24:04] does it doesn't make you want to go out
[1:24:06] and just live any way you want to I had
[1:24:08] somebody recently asked me and and and
[1:24:10] and not because they wanted me to but
[1:24:12] they just asked me they said why do you
[1:24:13] not preach on dress and stuff more and I
[1:24:15] thought about that and I thought you
[1:24:16] know and I told them I said the reason I
[1:24:18] don't it's because it doesn't do a lot
[1:24:19] of good to stand there and just say it
[1:24:21] all the time but if you can ever get a
[1:24:23] person to Christ
[1:24:24] then when you do say it it'll it'll mean
[1:24:26] something to them right we need to
[1:24:29] preach on dress we need to preach on
[1:24:30] brother BR say if you don't preach that
[1:24:31] you're not preaching the gospel we need
[1:24:33] to preach on those things but that's not
[1:24:35] our whole message our message is come to
[1:24:37] Calvary come to Christ get the baptism
[1:24:40] of the Holy Ghost and those things will
[1:24:41] start taking care of
[1:24:46] themselves the same faith that I have
[1:24:49] for myself I don't believe I can be lost
[1:24:51] and you have that same faith for your
[1:24:52] children I can't fathom them going out
[1:24:54] in the
[1:24:56] world and so I'm willing to do whatever
[1:24:58] it takes to keep them in the house of
[1:25:02] God knowing that if they did go I'd
[1:25:04] still believe they would be
[1:25:06] saved but but they're not going to
[1:25:11] go said man how can you say that I'm not
[1:25:13] saying that it's the same as a person
[1:25:15] you understand the same as a person that
[1:25:16] gets healed right and still
[1:25:19] blind right John Ryan the story of John
[1:25:21] Ryan he's blind walking around saying
[1:25:23] praise God for my
[1:25:25] healing I'm walking around right now
[1:25:26] saying praise God for my children who
[1:25:28] are not yet old enough to
[1:25:31] leave but believing and knowing that
[1:25:33] they won't because I have the kind of
[1:25:35] faith for them that I have for
[1:25:37] myself and those of you who have been
[1:25:39] through that maybe some of your kids did
[1:25:40] leave I'll say this they're coming
[1:25:43] back why because we we believe the same
[1:25:46] faith we had to be saved in and to and
[1:25:49] to believe that we're still saved as the
[1:25:50] same faith we have for our children
[1:25:54] very
[1:25:56] good and you say well brother Ben I
[1:25:58] don't have any kids well spend some time
[1:26:01] praying for some of
[1:26:03] these we sure need it they sure need
[1:26:05] pray for the
[1:26:06] parents sure need
[1:26:08] it B said I've got little children
[1:26:11] there's my little son Joseph Billy Sarah
[1:26:12] Rebecca well now he said I want to see
[1:26:14] each one of them a worker in the gospel
[1:26:16] doing something I want to see them saved
[1:26:18] and filled with the Holy Ghost now I've
[1:26:19] committed them to God and say I'm
[1:26:20] holding on to God for them and I believe
[1:26:22] they're going to be saved everyone one
[1:26:24] of them I believe they're going to be
[1:26:26] saved and I'll have them on the other
[1:26:27] side and I don't believe my salvation
[1:26:29] will save them no but my faith in God
[1:26:32] will do it you see my faith believing
[1:26:33] God will do it will cause them to come
[1:26:35] to Christ what are we supposed to do
[1:26:37] we're supposed to nurture our
[1:26:39] children right we're supposed to nurture
[1:26:41] them we're supposed to discipline them
[1:26:43] Paul calls it he said you fathers
[1:26:44] provoke not your children to wrath bring
[1:26:45] them up in the nurture and admonition
[1:26:47] teaching and
[1:26:48] warning right but the teaching part's
[1:26:50] got to be there and brother brandom
[1:26:52] tells us this he said the first thing I
[1:26:53] had to do do with that Divine gift
[1:26:55] that's the gift that he had of of a
[1:26:57] prophet of a sear he said was wi the
[1:26:59] hearts of the people if I haven't got
[1:27:02] their heart they wouldn't
[1:27:05] listen so I would say that about our
[1:27:07] children and and we'll be done in just a
[1:27:09] minute I'm not going to go on and on
[1:27:10] about this but we need to have the
[1:27:11] hearts of our children so we can correct
[1:27:14] our children that goes for our
[1:27:17] grandchildren goes for kids in the
[1:27:19] church goes for
[1:27:21] deacons goes for pastors
[1:27:25] right if we don't have their hearts me
[1:27:27] stand up here and yelling about how they
[1:27:29] dress is not going to help them unless
[1:27:31] they know I love
[1:27:33] them right but if they know I love them
[1:27:35] maybe I can tell them something that
[1:27:36] would help
[1:27:39] them babies need
[1:27:43] love and sometimes they need
[1:27:46] spanking but especially when they're
[1:27:47] very little they need
[1:27:49] love brother brand said listen God gave
[1:27:51] you that baby to love I don't care how
[1:27:53] bad you spoil it love it anyhow that's
[1:27:55] right love it if you don't love it now
[1:27:57] it'll grow up in a cold home and
[1:27:59] indifferent it'll seek love somewhere or
[1:28:03] something he said mother take that baby
[1:28:05] and give it fellowship and love now make
[1:28:08] it a part of you which it is and act
[1:28:11] like it hug it and kiss it and love it
[1:28:15] listen to me Church the revealing of the
[1:28:17] son of man was the opening up of all of
[1:28:19] the word to us right it wasn't just to
[1:28:22] tell us about deep things like the
[1:28:24] rainbow colors but it was to tell us
[1:28:26] about these
[1:28:27] things
[1:28:29] right he said don't be too cold with the
[1:28:32] things of the world God gave you that as
[1:28:33] a treasure raise it right they need love
[1:28:37] older kids need love too they still need
[1:28:39] nurture and there comes a time you got
[1:28:42] to be a parent you got to discipline you
[1:28:44] you spare the rod you'll spoil the child
[1:28:47] but there Comes A Time brother brandom
[1:28:48] talks about Rebecca it's important to
[1:28:50] note Rebecca's age when they talked
[1:28:52] about this because Rebecca was nearly
[1:28:53] eight 18 she was just a few days from
[1:28:56] turning 18 when this happened so she's
[1:28:59] 17 and some change I had you forgive me
[1:29:03] church I had a couple come to me one
[1:29:05] time and say we're going to set an
[1:29:06] ultimatum that at a certain time if our
[1:29:08] kid don't quit acting out and doing
[1:29:10] things they shouldn't do we're going to
[1:29:11] tell them get out of the house or get
[1:29:17] married brother brandham didn't tell us
[1:29:20] that said she needs a buddy if you can
[1:29:24] Rebecca when she started acting out in
[1:29:25] kind of a minor way but she was acting
[1:29:28] out she was going playing music that her
[1:29:31] dad didn't like amen
[1:29:34] kids not everything you hear on
[1:29:36] Christian radio or that calls itself
[1:29:38] Christian is
[1:29:41] Right some of us just rock and roll the
[1:29:44] Christian name you can't even tell what
[1:29:46] it
[1:29:46] is but in Sometimes some things daddy
[1:29:49] don't
[1:29:50] like even though it calls itself
[1:29:52] Christian but look brother brand said
[1:29:55] she needs a buddy you're the one to be
[1:29:57] her buddy said well she needs a buddy I
[1:29:59] wish somebody' be buddy to her well God
[1:30:02] give them parents for a
[1:30:04] reason said you and I we her parents
[1:30:06] these kids today needs a buddy if they
[1:30:08] had a mother and father would stay home
[1:30:09] and take care of them stood about here
[1:30:10] in a barro running around all night and
[1:30:12] things like that wouldn't have juvenile
[1:30:14] delinquency now look you said brother
[1:30:16] Ben what are you talking about well
[1:30:17] talking about favoritism look it wasn't
[1:30:20] that he treated Joseph badly but he
[1:30:23] should have treated all the children the
[1:30:25] same right but we know that was for a
[1:30:27] purpose but we should treat all our
[1:30:29] children like this you want to make it
[1:30:31] your child a favorite make them all
[1:30:33] favorites whether you got one or
[1:30:38] 15 so we got down on our knees and
[1:30:40] committed it to God and I said I know
[1:30:41] she's 18 years old we'll be in a few
[1:30:43] days and a girl that age will think
[1:30:44] about boyfriends God help
[1:30:47] us so you guys you guys have like 10
[1:30:50] years before you start thinking about
[1:30:51] boyfriends just remember that you girl
[1:30:56] girls I said brother B talked about how
[1:30:59] he want to see her work in the office
[1:31:00] and never gets married every father's
[1:31:04] dream
[1:31:05] right I said you know dads believe in
[1:31:08] fairy tales too their daughter's not
[1:31:10] getting
[1:31:13] married I said wait a minute we've
[1:31:15] raised all we can raised her all we can
[1:31:18] now see he recognized that right because
[1:31:20] she's going to be 18 in a few days and
[1:31:21] if you keep treating her like that she's
[1:31:23] just going to leave
[1:31:26] are you with me I'm just about
[1:31:28] done he said then he said and he said he
[1:31:32] said when she does anything say Becky he
[1:31:34] said commit her to God he said we've
[1:31:36] raised her all we can Becky darling
[1:31:37] mother don't want you to do that but I'm
[1:31:38] your pal I'll stick by you let her know
[1:31:40] that you love her she's going to get
[1:31:43] somebody to love her it might be the
[1:31:44] wrong woman I said you be the woman that
[1:31:46] does the loving we got down committed it
[1:31:48] to God said we take our hands off of it
[1:31:50] that afternoon she come in she said well
[1:31:52] I guess you're still saying I ain't
[1:31:53] going over over there m said no I never
[1:31:55] said nothing about it said you know
[1:31:57] mother don't want you to do that and you
[1:31:58] know it like to killed your daddy when
[1:32:00] you heard you up there playing that
[1:32:01] Boogie Woogie music ever what it was
[1:32:03] with that girl said no he didn't want
[1:32:05] you to do that we don't want you to do
[1:32:06] that Becky but we just committed it to
[1:32:08] the Lord I want you to know that we love
[1:32:10] you whatever we you do we still love you
[1:32:13] I want my kids to know and I don't want
[1:32:14] to just say it from the pulpit I say it

[1:32:18] you I want you to know your kids in the
[1:32:20] church I want you to know that I love

[1:32:23] grandpa it's important cuz I'm going to
[1:32:25] have some things I got to
[1:32:27] say there's some times in the Pulpit I'm

[1:32:31] that's very very
[1:32:32] real but know that I love

[1:32:47] ahead said all right I'll have supper
[1:32:49] ready when you get back she never did go
[1:32:53] no she's never went since he said not
[1:32:55] long after she met George we all know
[1:32:57] brother George George is a Christian
[1:32:59] that settled it
[1:33:01] then God has a way of taking care of our
[1:33:05] children be like Jesus not all of
[1:33:08] brother brandom's kids stayed out of the
[1:33:09] world in fact some of
[1:33:11] them you wouldn't hardly know it the way
[1:33:13] brother BR talked but he was honest with
[1:33:14] us told us a few things some of them
[1:33:17] left and did some things they shouldn't
[1:33:19] have done but they came
[1:33:21] back why because the same faith brother
[1:33:23] brandom had for himself he had for his
[1:33:25] children he said well what should I do
[1:33:27] brother Ben en closing as musicians come
[1:33:29] what should I do be like Jesus let all
[1:33:32] your kids be your
[1:33:34] favorites not just the ones that act
[1:33:36] good but the ones that don't aren't you
[1:33:38] glad aren't you glad when he was God's
[1:33:41] favorite he included you in that because
[1:33:44] we're in him when he was given the coat
[1:33:46] of many colors he included you in that
[1:33:49] and let you be a reflector what should
[1:33:52] we be church we should be reflect C of
[1:33:54] that kind of love to our families in
[1:33:56] this age of darkness in this age of
[1:33:58] coldness in this age when nobody feels
[1:34:01] love and nobody shows love let's be
[1:34:03] different than
[1:34:05] that let's love people once again
[1:34:08] sometimes that requires telling them the
[1:34:09] truth sometimes that requires telling
[1:34:11] our children the truth but let's let
[1:34:13] them know that we love them or we can't
[1:34:15] deal with them right we can't do it I
[1:34:18] pray that God blesses his word tonight I
[1:34:21] maybe you just like to think about it
[1:34:22] for a minute and just well and just bow
[1:34:24] your heads with me
[1:34:29] and say Lord I want to be a reflector of
[1:34:32] that rainbow coat of many
[1:34:34] colors in my life like Joseph was before
[1:34:38] you came I I want to be that now on the
[1:34:41] other side of that knowing what that was
[1:34:43] love joy and
[1:34:45] peace displayed through seven Church
[1:34:50] ages I want to do that in my life I want
[1:34:52] to let my kids KS know that I love
[1:34:58] them want them to know that I I believe
[1:35:00] you parents do a good job of that
[1:35:02] sometimes that requires discipline you
[1:35:04] don't just stand there and let them let
[1:35:05] them get killed in the
[1:35:08] street reason brother Caleb has to yell
[1:35:10] at y'all sometimes because he loves
[1:35:12] you and the reason sometimes we have to
[1:35:15] say the hard things from the pulpit is
[1:35:17] because we love
[1:35:19] you not because we want to hurt somebody
[1:35:22] why would we do that
