[48:04] the Still Waters he restoreth my soul he
[48:08] leadth me in the paths of righteousness

[48:19] with me thy rod and thy staff they
[48:22] comfort me thou preparest a table before

[48:33] goodness and mercy shall follow me all
[48:35] the days of my life and I will dwell in
[48:38] the house of the Lord forever you may be
[48:41] seated I just want to read a a quote uh
[48:44] quickly uh brother Brandon would say out
[48:48] of who do you say this is he'd saying
[48:51] look at the world today what a attention
[48:54] the whole world lives in in you go down
[48:57] the street it's not even safe to
[48:59] drive I don't know about here but come
[49:01] visit
[49:02] us it's not safe to be on a four-lane
[49:06] highway we got about a 16 Lane Highway
[49:08] everybody's at attention snapping what's
[49:10] the matter quen down where are you going
[49:13] that's what's making the insane
[49:15] institutions fill up that's what's got
[49:17] the church in such turmoil they're so
[49:20] headbound on a certain thing they won't
[49:22] stop and consider God's word and the
[49:25] hour that we're living all under a
[49:27] strain a tension now we know we are
[49:30] aware the Earth has just went through
[49:32] some great birth pains and the church is
[49:34] going through some birth pains it had to
[49:36] go through birth pains before it could
[49:38] have each of the prophets when they came
[49:40] into the world it was a birth pain to
[49:41] the church the world has went through
[49:43] the first world war second world war and
[49:45] now it's ready for a third world war and
[49:49] it's in birth pains again and there's
[49:52] only one thing that can bring peace and
[49:54] that is Christ
[49:56] all of our schemes and our ideas and our
[49:58] ecclesiastical
[49:59] buildups we're not free from them just
[50:02] because we say we we believe the message
[50:05] there's still a lot of schemes and ideas
[50:07] and ecclesiastical buildups and all of
[50:09] our politics and all of our science and
[50:11] everything it's been proved that it's
[50:13] nonsense and then we pray for God to
[50:16] help us to intervene come in and do
[50:20] something for us and then when he
[50:23] does I just want wonder if we would be
[50:27] able to understand it if we would be
[50:30] able to receive it or even would we
[50:34] consider it I want to by the help of God
[50:38] just preach to you a little bit maybe uh
[50:41] testify or like I told brother Ben maybe
[50:43] I'll just preach ify a little
[50:45] bit I want to talk to you about divine
[50:49] intervention and and with that title
[50:52] being said I I got to thinking we had
[50:54] such a lovely meal meal my what a spread
[50:57] wasn't that wonderful I mean I think
[50:59] there was every meat yet the turkey the
[51:01] ham and this stew and this mashed potato
[51:05] and that mashed potato and the sweet one
[51:07] and the white one and every kind of
[51:09] dessert I saw one brother I'm like man
[51:11] he He piled that plate so high of
[51:12] dessert and I thought my goodness I
[51:15] wouldn't be able to move after all that
[51:17] what I got to think in my this is such a
[51:19] wonderful spread and everybody's going
[51:21] to be eaten and so happy and I got to
[51:24] thinking we're going to need to divine
[51:25] intervention
[51:27] tonight I mean I'm like Lord maybe this
[51:30] is the right title cuz we're going to
[51:32] need divine intervention come in and and
[51:35] stir the people a little bit you know
[51:38] and and that's what we're here for and
[51:40] and you know intervention is the act of
[51:42] interfering with the outcome or course
[51:44] especially of a condition or process so
[51:47] as all those things are building in the
[51:50] body and your eyelids are getting uh uh
[51:52] heavier and heavier and you you feel
[51:54] like you're sinking in your chair and
[51:56] you're getting comfortable and you're
[51:57] about to go to sleep well we pray that
[51:59] there's an intervention of that outcome
[52:01] of you falling asleep while the word is
[52:03] going forth but I I I just looking at
[52:05] the the the definition of intervention
[52:07] that act of interfering with the outcome
[52:10] or as the prophet of God said to come in
[52:13] and do something for us and I believe
[52:16] that's why we're gathered here together
[52:18] tonight it's not is not just to fulfill
[52:21] an obligation but we we want to as we
[52:23] spoke this morning uh uh we to be ready
[52:25] and prepared for the rapture we want God
[52:28] to come in and do something for us in
[52:31] the Supernatural that our our gathering
[52:33] is not in vain that we're in his
[52:35] presence and God is here to do something
[52:38] special for us and and and I believe
[52:40] that by Divine promise God is here and
[52:43] he's here to do something for you
[52:45] something specific for you and as the
[52:48] prophet would say and when he does it I
[52:50] just wonder if we'd be able to
[52:52] understand it if we would be able to
[52:54] receive it or even if if we would
[52:55] consider it my I wonder if many times
[53:01] God's speaking but are we
[53:05] listening that's right God is trying to
[53:08] give you the answer he he he's trying to
[53:10] show you the way he he he's trying to
[53:12] get your attention but you know
[53:14] sometimes we're just not
[53:16] listening maybe we don't recognize his
[53:20] voice you know I think of that time the
[53:22] prophet was there uh I Believe on
[53:25] Hurricane Mountain you know and and and
[53:27] the storm had come in very quickly and
[53:30] you know he was a he was a Woodsman he
[53:33] was a a guide and he knew his way there
[53:36] in the mountains and and and really it
[53:38] probably uh if he did get lost uh for
[53:41] him you know he would just find a place
[53:43] to to hunker down and be able to climb
[53:45] into a bank somewhere or build something
[53:47] because he he he would be able to
[53:49] survive that but when this storm came in
[53:51] you know he had his wife and his baby
[53:53] was down there in that cabin and and so
[53:55] he knew that they wouldn't be able to
[53:58] weather the storm they would freeze and
[54:00] they would die so he didn't have the
[54:02] option of of just uh uh climbing into a
[54:04] cave or or getting to a place to to
[54:06] weather out the storm so he he knew he
[54:09] had to get down the mountain to that
[54:11] cabin because there everything that he
[54:13] loved and everything that he held dear
[54:15] it was down there in that mountain and
[54:17] so as as this this Hunter this guide
[54:20] kept uh making his way back for that
[54:22] cabin he kept coming back to that same
[54:24] place I believe there was a deer he'd
[54:26] come back and like now I'm I'm back to
[54:28] where I started and he he would get his
[54:30] bearings again and he would start to
[54:32] walk and he would go off and and I
[54:33] imagine it would be some time before and
[54:35] he' come right back to the same spot and
[54:38] he like now that came right and he did
[54:39] it again and it struck him he said I'm
[54:41] on the Death March the Indians would
[54:42] call it the death march where when you
[54:44] were lost you you would start to go in
[54:46] circles and keep coming back to the same
[54:48] place
[54:51] yeah and he thought you know I got to
[54:53] get it together here I got to get down
[54:55] there because there's my wife and and
[54:57] the baby are there and and and and I
[54:59] need to get there and he would he would
[55:00] start off again and he felt like there
[55:02] was some little something a voice that
[55:04] said I am an everpresent help in the
[55:06] time of trouble oh yeah and he and think
[55:09] of this now here's the prophet of God
[55:10] he'd say okay now I'm just losing my
[55:12] mind I'm starting to hear voices yeah
[55:16] and and he would start to go and say I
[55:19] am an everpresent help in the time of
[55:21] trouble he goes I I got to my goodness
[55:23] what is that I'm starting to hear voices
[55:25] now and I I got to get down there cuz my
[55:27] wife and baby are are are are going to
[55:29] die and he he's trying to find his way
[55:31] and he says I am the Lord thy God and
[55:33] everpresent help in the time of trouble
[55:35] oh yes and and it finally after two or
[55:38] three or four times the prophet of God
[55:41] finally
[55:43] recognized think of it in the trial in
[55:46] the storm you're you're you're going
[55:48] through everything and God is here
[55:49] speaking to you if a prophet could be in
[55:52] such a place of of where he's he's
[55:54] trying with his best just to hang on and
[55:56] to make it through and hear God is
[55:58] talking to him and how many times did he
[56:01] hear God
[56:02] speak in himself he he's wrestling be be
[56:06] with in his mind whether whether it's
[56:08] God speaking to him or not and as that
[56:10] voice got stronger he finally recognized
[56:13] oh God is that you and he fell down to
[56:15] his knees he started to cry he said oh
[56:17] God forgive your stupid servant I'm lost
[56:20] I need your help oh God
[56:23] Amen
[56:25] yes sir he said uh after crying out
[56:28] there to the Lord you know he
[56:30] finally
[56:33] recognized it was the voice of God that
[56:35] was talking to
[56:38] him and then he purposed in his heart
[56:40] and he said I'm just gonna I'm just
[56:43] gonna start heading this
[56:46] way I'm just going to try to make it
[56:48] back this is the best I can do and he
[56:50] starts to walk back trying to find his
[56:53] way towards that cabin
[56:57] and he said here he was gone you know
[56:58] the visibil there was no visibility he's
[57:00] just doing his best and he said all of a
[57:02] sudden there was something grabbed a
[57:04] hold of his shoulder and turned him
[57:06] around he said and I turned around and
[57:08] all a sudden the fog and and and the and
[57:10] the skies and everything parted and I
[57:12] could look over the mountains and
[57:14] through that little parting Gap and
[57:16] there I could see that that tower that
[57:18] held that line that ran down to the
[57:20] cabin and he said I was walking into
[57:23] certain death
[57:25] I was walking Plum into Canada I I would
[57:28] have lost everything that all deer and
[57:30] and possibly died trying to get there he
[57:32] said but what happened God intervened
[57:34] God grabbed a hold of his arm God turned
[57:37] him around it was divine intervention
[57:40] that God intervene
[57:46] Hallelujah and when he does
[57:48] it I just wonder if we would be able to
[57:51] understand it if we would be able to
[57:52] receive it or even would we consider it
[57:56] oh my I say God help us give us the
[57:59] wisdom give us the strength lead us
[58:00] guide us show us the way that when he
[58:03] does
[58:04] it we would consider it that we would be
[58:07] able to receive it I think many times
[58:09] God speaks to
[58:11] us and we don't want to receive it God
[58:14] gives us the answer but it's not the
[58:16] answer that we're looking for it's God
[58:19] intervening on the situation God giving
[58:22] you the answer God closing the door sure
[58:26] oh that's right I I remember one time I
[58:29] I was uh uh just a young Christian and
[58:31] you know you can sometimes you you you
[58:34] might find favor with people and maybe
[58:36] God give you that ability to find favor
[58:38] with people and and to to to be able to
[58:41] work things and and and I remember I I I
[58:44] had to get somewhere I had something
[58:45] planned I I'd get to the airport and you
[58:49] know and uh they were they're like I'm
[58:52] sorry things are it's too late you can't
[58:54] get on and and so I was like well can I
[58:56] talk to this can I talk to that and I
[58:57] finally get back and and and after this
[59:01] other says no and this and I finally
[59:04] push my way I get to somebody and
[59:06] they're like you know what well
[59:07] something just opened up and and we can
[59:09] get you on and and and I finally I got
[59:11] there and after it was all said and done
[59:13] I realized you know maybe I shouldn't
[59:15] have been here in the first place yeah
[59:18] God was trying to shut the door and I
[59:19] was trying to kick him open on I I never
[59:22] stopped for one moment said Lord is that
[59:24] you
[59:25] it do you want me to go Lord are you
[59:27] trying to talk to me are you speaking to
[59:29] me I I had something in my mind that I
[59:32] wanted to do in a direction that I
[59:34] wanted to go Lord and in my zealousness
[59:37] to carry out my plans am I leaving you
[59:39] out of the equation I should have said
[59:41] Lord I I'm up against an obstacle again
[59:44] and and I don't want to rely on on my
[59:46] ability of a man to to bring this to
[59:49] pass Lord if it be thy will speak to me
[59:51] Lord show me if if you're closing the
[59:53] door and I presume if I would have done
[59:55] that and listened maybe the reason I
[59:57] kind of had that little burden on my
[59:59] heart anyways is it wasn't the right
[1:00:01] time it wasn't the hour that maybe I
[1:00:03] should have waited and I say that when
[1:00:04] when God's closing doors or when
[1:00:06] situations are arising and things are
[1:00:08] happening I say it behooves us to stop
[1:00:11] and wait on the Lord and and look for
[1:00:12] the mind of God and say Lord what are
[1:00:14] you trying to show me in this trial what
[1:00:16] are you trying to show me in this
[1:00:17] situation Lord why have these things
[1:00:19] come to pass it could be something awful
[1:00:21] it could be something evil but God knows
[1:00:23] how to take those things and and apply
[1:00:25] his word that it would work out for your
[1:00:27] good if we would just wait upon the Lord
[1:00:29] the scripture says those that wait upon
[1:00:31] the Lord they shall renew their strength
[1:00:33] they shall rise up with wings as an
[1:00:35] eagle they shall walk and not Faith they
[1:00:37] shall run and not be weary oh teach me
[1:00:39] Lord to wait upon thee let him intervene
[1:00:42] on your behalf let him speak to you and
[1:00:44] when he does oh consider it Lord what
[1:00:46] are you doing in my
[1:00:49] life we need something from
[1:00:52] God we all are are needy and maybe you
[1:00:55] have some type of need for your family
[1:00:57] and you need an answer I say maybe just
[1:01:00] to try to keep it a short service
[1:01:02] tonight but we want it to still be
[1:01:04] impactful we still want we want God to
[1:01:06] do something we want something that
[1:01:08] you're believing for that your faith
[1:01:10] would rise up and be able to claim it
[1:01:12] and you know you have to have that type
[1:01:13] of expectation something in your heart
[1:01:16] that you're believing for something I
[1:01:18] think of blind barus how he sat there he
[1:01:20] knew that Jesus was passing by and he
[1:01:23] wasn't satisfied there just to sit
[1:01:25] through the service and fulfill an
[1:01:27] obligation but he said you know what I'm
[1:01:28] going to participate I I got to get
[1:01:31] involved because I have a need and I'm
[1:01:33] going to cry out I'm going to scream out
[1:01:35] thou son of David have mercy upon me I
[1:01:38] have a need oh God I say if we can just
[1:01:40] all get together in one mind and one
[1:01:43] Accord and we can start to cry out oh
[1:01:44] God minister to my need speak to me
[1:01:47] speak to my brother and my sister we
[1:01:49] have need of thee and oh I believe God
[1:01:51] will come on the scene in a supernatural
[1:01:53] way
[1:01:55] cry out unto the Lord oh yes you know I
[1:02:00] don't know what your need is but I I I I
[1:02:02] think of those lepers there in Luke that
[1:02:04] were they started to cry out thou son of
[1:02:07] David they started to cry out Jesus
[1:02:09] Master have mercy on me oh
[1:02:13] yes there was 10 of
[1:02:16] them
[1:02:18] yeah and he's
[1:02:20] graciously stops to minister to their
[1:02:23] need he says go show your eles to the
[1:02:26] priest you know leprosy is a type of
[1:02:30] sin you know and here they had that need
[1:02:33] and Jesus ministered to them he says now
[1:02:35] go show yourself to priest and the
[1:02:37] scripture says as they went along their
[1:02:39] way it says one of them when he when he
[1:02:42] saw that he had been healed when he saw
[1:02:44] that he'd be changed he turned back to
[1:02:47] Worship the Lord he turned back to give
[1:02:49] him glory he turned back with a loud
[1:02:52] voice giving God glory and giving God
[1:02:55] praise oh could you imagine what he was
[1:02:57] going through could you imagine what he
[1:02:59] was what he was feeling this this burden
[1:03:02] in this weight that had been upon him he
[1:03:04] turned back and the scripture says it
[1:03:06] was with a loud voice he began to give
[1:03:08] God praise thank you Lord and Jesus said
[1:03:12] where are the others were there not 10
[1:03:13] where's the other nine come on he said
[1:03:17] there are not found that returned to
[1:03:19] give God glory save this stranger this
[1:03:23] Samaritan
[1:03:25] not even a Jew but he has come back to
[1:03:27] give God glory I say oh God I want to
[1:03:29] give you glory I want to give you honor
[1:03:31] I want to give you praise for the
[1:03:33] wonderful things that you've done in my
[1:03:35] life the wonderful things that you're
[1:03:36] doing in this church I want to give you
[1:03:38] praise and glory for this message that
[1:03:40] you've given to me I I want to scream it
[1:03:42] out and say oh thank you

[1:15:07] God knew all of these things that he
[1:15:09] could
[1:15:10] predestinate and then he could look out
[1:15:12] through all generations all the way back

[1:16:04] Hallelujah
[1:16:07] God intervening on your

[1:16:12] Lord God rich in
[1:16:15] Mercy thank you Lord he's the Divine
[1:16:19] architect yes he is he's the one that
[1:16:22] holds it all in his hands
[1:16:25] yes you know you think of Abraham
[1:16:29] there here he finally gets the
[1:16:32] promise
[1:16:34] yeah now he's going up on a mountain
[1:16:37] yeah to
[1:16:39] sacrifice the promised
[1:16:42] son that's true he gets up there and
[1:16:46] Isaac being obedient son he's built the
[1:16:49] altar Isaac dad where's the sacrifice
[1:16:54] son God's able to
[1:16:57] provide takes his only begotten
[1:17:01] son lays him there on that
[1:17:05] altar I don't think any of us can begin
[1:17:08] to understand the agony oh my and the
[1:17:12] turmoil oh
[1:17:15] Jesus that Abraham was filling in that
[1:17:19] moment oh my but he had a problem
[1:17:23] promise Hallelujah Lord I received him
[1:17:26] as one from the dead
[1:17:27] Hallelujah Glory come on and so I must
[1:17:31] have a son to be a father of many
[1:17:34] nations that wouldn't be enough to take
[1:17:37] away the agony and the
[1:17:39] grief but he had to be
[1:17:43] obedient and there are Isaac a type of
[1:17:45] Christ laying on the altar willing to
[1:17:47] give his
[1:17:49] life Abraham was committed to do it he
[1:17:52] raised back that that hand with that
[1:17:55] knife that sharp knife he was about to
[1:17:57] cut his throat my and just in that
[1:18:00] moment God said Abraham stay your
[1:18:03] hand oh it was God intervening yes it
[1:18:07] was God Divine in Abraham stay your hand
[1:18:12] for I have provided you a sacrifice and
[1:18:15] there caught in the thicket was a ram
[1:18:17] and what did Abraham do he called that
[1:18:19] place of Jehovah Gyra God is able to
[1:18:22] provide himself God is able he's still
[1:18:25] the same yesterday today and what one
[1:18:28] what one of the seven Redemptive names
[1:18:30] do you have need of God's willing and
[1:18:32] ready and able and standing by to
[1:18:34] intervene on your behalf
[1:18:36] hallelujah thank you Lord
[1:18:38] Jesus prophet of God said and when he
[1:18:41] was ready to obey God to its fullness oh
[1:18:44] yeah there's the
[1:18:46] key he caught his hand and said stay
[1:18:48] your hand Abraham there was a ram hooked
[1:18:51] in the wilderness around the vines with
[1:18:53] Thorn with horns on top of that mountain
[1:18:56] where there was Lions wolves hyenas
[1:18:57] jackals and great ferocious beasts that
[1:19:00] eat sheep and then he was way up on top
[1:19:03] of the mountain where there was no water
[1:19:05] how did that Ram get there oh my Abraham
[1:19:10] had picked up Stones all around to build
[1:19:12] an altar but there was the ram anyhow it
[1:19:15] was a paradox oh yes and any man that
[1:19:19] believes God and takes him at his word
[1:19:21] sir no matter what the situation is God
[1:19:25] will perform another Paradox to keep his
[1:19:28] word for Abraham called that place
[1:19:30] Jehovah Gyra the Lord has provided for
[1:19:33] himself a sacrifice he still can cause a
[1:19:36] paradox to happen oh yes he can do it
[1:19:40] this afternoon oh yes if you'll just
[1:19:43] take
[1:19:44] him at his word oh thank you Lord thank
[1:19:49] you I just wanted to maybe share a
[1:19:50] little
[1:19:51] testimony
[1:19:53] uh maybe I should call it a big
[1:19:55] testimony for me in my life and the way
[1:19:58] that God dealt with my heart I had
[1:20:03] uh I want to tell a little story I I had
[1:20:06] a a surgery to remove a tumor and and I
[1:20:09] had some lingering symptoms that I was
[1:20:11] battling with and I got to talking to a
[1:20:15] brother and I I was fellowshipping about
[1:20:17] it and just wondering you know why why
[1:20:20] make why the
[1:20:21] prolonged
[1:20:23] you know God had moved miraculously on
[1:20:25] the scene and intervened on my behalf
[1:20:29] then but I having these kind of followup
[1:20:32] surgeries I'm having to do and some
[1:20:34] lingering symptoms and it just struck my
[1:20:37] heart you know I thought you
[1:20:39] know I need to take time and consider
[1:20:42] maybe God's allowed this to happen
[1:20:44] because I really haven't taken time oh
[1:20:47] my to
[1:20:49] consider really what God did for me yeah
[1:20:53] I didn't take the time to
[1:20:55] really appreciate it and testify about
[1:20:58] it oh my like I should and I realized
[1:21:02] that maybe some of this prolonged
[1:21:03] symptoms and surges was a reminder
[1:21:06] exactly what God had done because very
[1:21:10] good it we we should consider what God
[1:21:13] is doing we should consider what God has
[1:21:16] done but thank you Lord but you know
[1:21:17] it's so easy for us to just run off and
[1:21:21] not take time to consider yeah that's
[1:21:23] true we call upon God and we need
[1:21:26] answers and situations and and and maybe
[1:21:29] you know few months and few things go by
[1:21:32] and maybe even your own conversion you
[1:21:34] were calling about God and before you
[1:21:35] know it you just you're on your Merry
[1:21:37] Little
[1:21:38] way living back life
[1:21:42] normal just like those lepers oh my here
[1:21:46] they were in one
[1:21:48] spot yeah an outcast come on and they
[1:21:52] couldn't go into town they couldn't
[1:21:54] mingle with
[1:21:56] society and then they called out because
[1:21:59] they had a need and God met their need
[1:22:01] but they went on their way ungrateful oh
[1:22:03] my I say oh God I I I don't ever want to
[1:22:06] be ungrateful again I'm going to take
[1:22:08] the time and the consideration of what
[1:22:11] you've done for me not only in my
[1:22:13] personal life but what about the age
[1:22:15] what about the generation what about the
[1:22:17] church what about the
[1:22:19] family what about the hour that we're
[1:22:21] living in thank you Lord but sometimes
[1:22:24] we don't take time we we don't take time
[1:22:26] and consider it we just run off yeah
[1:22:29] that reminds me of a time I was on a
[1:22:32] little road trip and I was driving a
[1:22:35] little fast like sometimes I
[1:22:37] accidentally do
[1:22:39] often Lord forgive
[1:22:41] me you know and those semis get piled up
[1:22:44] out there and one wants to pass the
[1:22:46] other and they're five miles behind them
[1:22:49] so they get over and you thinking well I
[1:22:51] got enough time so you just just you get
[1:22:53] in the slow lane and you got enough time
[1:22:54] to get up and then get in front of them
[1:22:56] and keep going well sometimes it gets a
[1:22:58] little
[1:23:00] close and I was with a friend and it was
[1:23:03] getting a little close and I started to
[1:23:04] get over and he was like wait wait wait
[1:23:06] wait and I
[1:23:07] hesitated oh and and and and I I had to
[1:23:12] overreact and before you know we're
[1:23:13] starting to fish tail on the
[1:23:16] highway when I say fishtail I don't know
[1:23:18] now I'm at least going 70 miles per hour
[1:23:20] cuz I'd slowed down trying to but my my
[1:23:23] truck was
[1:23:24] fishtailing and it fishtailed over and
[1:23:26] hit the the you know cuz one semi got
[1:23:28] over here and then there was one in the
[1:23:30] slow lane and so I zoomed up to go in
[1:23:33] between them and as I went in between
[1:23:34] them I started fish tailing like this on
[1:23:36] the highway and swung all the way over
[1:23:39] and and that probably would have been
[1:23:41] the final swing if that truck wasn't
[1:23:43] there we'd have started rolling but I
[1:23:45] hit that semi and it shot me right
[1:23:46] across the median right across I20
[1:23:49] through oncoming traffic hit the other
[1:23:52] side and then now there's a bridge with
[1:23:54] the big concrete pillars coming down you
[1:23:56] know that the concrete bank that goes up
[1:23:58] like that and now I'm shooting right
[1:24:00] through that
[1:24:01] Gap two feet higher would have tore off
[1:24:04] the top of the
[1:24:05] truck little bit lower we'd hit those
[1:24:08] pillars shoot right through that Gap and
[1:24:10] I tell you like Dukes a hazard we come
[1:24:12] off the other side of that thing through
[1:24:14] the air boom and we I mean we stick it
[1:24:17] like a
[1:24:18] gymnast right there in the
[1:24:21] mud brother Brandon preaching the whole
[1:24:24] time it was
[1:24:25] surreal it was the tape was still
[1:24:32] playing and it it was a miracle yeah
[1:24:37] yeah I'm like the truck's not even
[1:24:39] really damaged oh
[1:24:42] my I'm like but I'm
[1:24:47] stuck and I could see the father saying
[1:24:51] son
[1:24:53] come on I want you to
[1:24:55] consider yes your actions come
[1:24:59] on CU I was stuck in the mud because if
[1:25:02] I wouldn't have been stuck in the mud
[1:25:03] you know what I'd have done thrown on my
[1:25:07] blinker went down to the next exit and
[1:25:09] turned around cuz I was on the wrong
[1:25:10] side of the highway
[1:25:13] remember yeah come on I would have
[1:25:16] gotten back on the road and I said hey
[1:25:18] that was a close
[1:25:19] one maybe never even thought about it
[1:25:23] again come on maybe I would have said
[1:25:25] hey man did you see them maneuvering
[1:25:29] skills I kind of got us into a little
[1:25:31] something there but did you see that
[1:25:33] yeah you know cross the highway and
[1:25:34] through on and yeah you know coming woo
[1:25:37] you know I was I was I was like a race
[1:25:39] car driver man I really had it under
[1:25:41] control you know I didn't have nothing
[1:25:43] under
[1:25:45] control come on prise but there was two
[1:25:48] predestinated seeds Hallelujah two sons
[1:25:51] of God that
[1:25:53] God had a plan for their
[1:25:55] life and in my ignorance I could have
[1:25:57] snuffed it
[1:25:58] out come on but God
[1:26:03] intervened glory and I had to be stuck
[1:26:05] in the mud come on I had to call for a
[1:26:09] tow truck come on preach to pull me out
[1:26:12] and maybe you feel stuck in the mud
[1:26:14] tonight maybe you need to call on Jesus
[1:26:17] say God I need you to pull me out I I
[1:26:20] realized I got myself in a situ
[1:26:23] but I I know you've intervened in my
[1:26:25] life time and time again and here I am I
[1:26:27] feel like I'm stuck I'm calling on you
[1:26:30] pull me out of the muck in my I'm going
[1:26:32] to learn my lesson and I'm going to give
[1:26:34] you
[1:26:35] praise
[1:26:37] hallelujah oh yes yeah I had to I had to
[1:26:40] think about it a little bit yes I was
[1:26:43] stuck there in the mud you know
[1:26:46] and oh thank
[1:26:49] you we have to have understanding and
[1:26:52] consider when God does something like
[1:26:55] that for us
[1:26:57] yes just in reflecting in my testimony
[1:27:00] setting the stage for it you know and I
[1:27:03] remember 2019 was really one of the
[1:27:05] hardest years of my life my brother
[1:27:08] Aaron who is a best friend of mine you
[1:27:11] know he moved to Arizona and that was
[1:27:13] just a we're very close best friends and
[1:27:16] always looked up to him and cherished
[1:27:19] his ministry and you know he moved away
[1:27:21] and that same uh year uh we had
[1:27:26] performed the the wedding ceremony for
[1:27:28] my uh my cousin charity and it was just
[1:27:31] a month later uh that she went to be
[1:27:34] with the Lord and so uh 2019 was just uh
[1:27:37] for me was a very a difficult and hard
[1:27:40] year and and those are maybe just some
[1:27:42] of the the the bigger things there was
[1:27:44] other underlining things that were just
[1:27:46] piling on in in 2019 and and it was just
[1:27:50] very tough it was a big trial for for me
[1:27:52] you know it was a really I I was felt
[1:27:54] like I was in a really dark place and
[1:27:56] but you know God gave us a little bright
[1:27:58] spot you know I we found out we were
[1:27:59] with child and and and we were going to
[1:28:02] have a baby and I just felt you know in
[1:28:03] my heart that I said you know this is
[1:28:05] going to mean Victory oh my you know
[1:28:08] through all this turmoil and all this
[1:28:10] trial Lord You're giv me a child I I
[1:28:12] want this I want this name I want this
[1:28:14] meaning to to mean
[1:28:17] Victory and so as I I made that
[1:28:19] statement I thought about that you know
[1:28:21] the the uh my son would be born in the
[1:28:23] year 2020 I started to say you know what
[1:28:26] uh uh 2020 is going to be a year of
[1:28:29] Victory and I started to make this uh a
[1:28:32] profession and and I won't belabor uh
[1:28:34] much of the time but even even uh
[1:28:36] evans's birth was Supernatural as um we
[1:28:40] had complications in uh as we did a home
[1:28:42] birth we had
[1:28:44] complications and uh the the The
[1:28:47] Midwives had to call 911 we had lost his
[1:28:49] heart rate twice and it became a a great
[1:28:52] emergency and and we just we we we
[1:28:54] called on the name of the Lord but you
[1:28:56] know just just before that it was it
[1:28:58] pretty profound now as I I begin to tell
[1:29:00] you a little bit more about it but I I I
[1:29:02] knew I wanted his name to to mean
[1:29:04] Victory and here we're we're just hours
[1:29:07] maybe from having having our son I said
[1:29:10] Lord and I had thought about uh names
[1:29:12] you know uh uh certain ones and I I
[1:29:15] thought about Evan which meant grace of
[1:29:16] God and and would like my middle name
[1:29:19] Matthew and I just thought about those
[1:29:21] things but then as now the hours closing
[1:29:23] down I need hey I need to pick something
[1:29:24] you got to name that kid something can't
[1:29:26] call him kid your whole life hey
[1:29:30] kid I said I said Lord I I I was kind of
[1:29:34] settling on on Evan Matthew which means
[1:29:38] grace of God and I said Lord I I thought
[1:29:42] his name was supposed to mean Victory
[1:29:44] and I just felt that still Small Voice
[1:29:46] say what greater Victory is there than
[1:29:48] the grace of God and I thought that's
[1:29:51] that's it Lord
[1:29:52] yes his name's his name's his name's
[1:29:55] Evan uh the grace of God and it seemed
[1:29:58] like right as I told Gabriel that it
[1:30:00] seemed like the enemy uh all of a sudden
[1:30:03] we we lost the baby's heart rate and it
[1:30:05] seemed like fear came in the room and
[1:30:06] the devil was saying it's not this ain't
[1:30:08] a year of Victory because now it's
[1:30:10] actually on my dad's 70th birthday and
[1:30:13] he's like this ain't going to be a
[1:30:14] memorial for your dad's 70th this is
[1:30:16] going to be more heartache and more pain
[1:30:17] and all a sudden it seemed like all this
[1:30:19] fear was try starting to pour in the
[1:30:21] room as as we had lost the heart rate
[1:30:23] and now they're calling 911 and you
[1:30:25] could tell the midwives it was beyond
[1:30:27] their abilities now we we we didn't
[1:30:29] realize this until the the birth but the
[1:30:31] umbilical cord had been wrapped around
[1:30:32] his torso and around his neck and all of
[1:30:35] his auction Supply had been been cut off
[1:30:37] and I kept trying to encourage my wife
[1:30:38] honey you can do it you can do all
[1:30:40] things and I didn't realize when she was
[1:30:41] saying I can't it was physically it was
[1:30:44] impossible because the baby was hung up
[1:30:46] and it it was dying and all that fear
[1:30:49] pouring in the room and something a
[1:30:52] perfect love cast out fear I laid my
[1:30:54] hands on my wife and I cried I said God
[1:30:57] you're a God rich in Mercy you're an
[1:30:59] everpresent help in the time of trouble
[1:31:01] I need you to come on the scene and no
[1:31:03] more than I said that look the baby
[1:31:05] hadn't even dropped
[1:31:07] yet and as soon as I said that uh the
[1:31:11] Midwife goes the baby's
[1:31:13] here and those midwives would testify
[1:31:16] this that as you started to cry out to
[1:31:17] God I felt something sweep through my
[1:31:20] own body into your wife the other
[1:31:22] Midwife said the baby it was just it was
[1:31:25] it was a miracle all of a sudden the
[1:31:26] baby was just there why because that's
[1:31:28] the God we
[1:31:30] serve he's an everpresent help in the
[1:31:33] time of
[1:31:35] trouble and so God God brought us
[1:31:37] through that and we were so thankful and
[1:31:41] and then they asked me what his middle
[1:31:42] name was going to be and I thought well
[1:31:44] I want to give God a chance I was
[1:31:45] thinking about Matthew and sure enough
[1:31:47] right when I said that he the scripture
[1:31:49] came to my mind for by grace are you
[1:31:51] saved through faith and that not of
[1:31:53] yourself it is a gift of God so I say my
[1:31:55] my son's name Evan Matthew he's an
[1:31:57] Ephesians 28 baby because uh Evan means
[1:32:00] the grace of God and Matthew means gift
[1:32:02] of God and and truly he he's been a gift
[1:32:04] and the grace of God to our lives and I
[1:32:07] say what a testimony I praise God that
[1:32:10] He gave me that Ephesians 28 baby and
[1:32:12] you know it was shortly after coming
[1:32:13] through that trial here this this year
[1:32:16] of Victory what strikes me while I'm in
[1:32:18] the Pulpit you want Victory you got to
[1:32:19] go through a trial yeah
[1:32:22] well I got what I asked
[1:32:27] for it's going to be a year of Victory
[1:32:29] and shortly after that I started having
[1:32:31] some symptoms and I decided to go to the
[1:32:34] doctor and I I hate to be so transparent
[1:32:36] but I I started to have some some blood
[1:32:38] and the urine and things and you know
[1:32:40] I'm pretty hard-headed I I uh you know I
[1:32:43] I kind of like to be like a bulldog by
[1:32:45] faith and just grab a hold of something
[1:32:47] and and you know a promise and not let
[1:32:49] it go you know that we we need to learn
[1:32:51] and we we need to grow and we need to
[1:32:52] have wisdom and we need to be able to
[1:32:54] teach others and instruct them properly
[1:32:56] and and so I didn't realize God was
[1:32:59] teaching me something I remember
[1:33:01] thinking about others maybe going
[1:33:02] through a trial or something and you
[1:33:04] know we always think we'll do something
[1:33:06] until it's your time to go through it
[1:33:08] yeah and so I just thought you know
[1:33:09] maybe I I better go to the doctor I
[1:33:11] better not ignore this and so I went to
[1:33:14] the doctor and I pulled up in front of
[1:33:16] that that office there and I said Lord
[1:33:19] by your stripes I'm already healed
[1:33:22] yeah I had this question why why do I
[1:33:25] got to go to the
[1:33:26] doctor do I even need to do this well
[1:33:30] the prophet actually said it's your duty
[1:33:31] to go to the doctor that's
[1:33:34] right but I I I said Lord by your
[1:33:37] stripes I'm Healed and just as soon as I
[1:33:38] said I felt that still Small Voice say
[1:33:41] yes but it wasn't until M was on the
[1:33:43] operating table that I
[1:33:45] intervened and so that was the way God
[1:33:47] dealt with my heart to know that I
[1:33:49] needed to go through the process that
[1:33:51] that God could use a doctor and and I I
[1:33:54] went in there and it happened to be uh
[1:33:56] February 20th it was 220 2020 Dr Graves
[1:33:59] isn't that a wonderful name for a
[1:34:03] doctor after I went to my family
[1:34:06] practitioner they referred me to a
[1:34:07] urologist and I went into the urologist
[1:34:09] and they did their analysis and then
[1:34:12] finally I said okay we need to bring you
[1:34:14] in we need to go go in there and look
[1:34:16] and see what's going on and what's
[1:34:17] causing this and so yeah it was 220 2020
[1:34:20] Dr Graves go with in there and you know
[1:34:22] he's been practicing for about 40 years
[1:34:24] he takes one look at it he goes it's
[1:34:26] cancer Oh my he said that's bladder
[1:34:28] cancer he says do you do you smoke do
[1:34:31] you do this do you do that and he said
[1:34:32] well this is second to stomach cancer he
[1:34:35] kept asking me he was a little perplexed
[1:34:37] he said well you you haven't done I said
[1:34:39] well when I was a teenager you know
[1:34:40] before I started serving the lord and I
[1:34:43] said all this stuff he's like well no
[1:34:44] it's yeah it's it's possible low grade
[1:34:47] but I mean it's it's cancer we got to
[1:34:49] get in there so he scheduled the chemo
[1:34:51] he scheduled everything and based on his
[1:34:53] 40 years experience and four days later
[1:34:55] that's when I would go in to have the
[1:34:57] tumor removed and I appreciated Dr
[1:35:00] Graves because he came in he wanted to
[1:35:01] he was a Christian and he came in and
[1:35:03] laid hands on me before the surgery and
[1:35:05] said I want to lay hands on you and pray
[1:35:07] pray with you before um before the
[1:35:10] surgery and you know this is where I
[1:35:12] didn't realize how miraculous it was but
[1:35:15] now that I've had to go in for surgery
[1:35:16] another two or three times uh just to do
[1:35:18] some corrective things um I didn't
[1:35:21] realize it but when they put me under
[1:35:24] you know they started to give me the
[1:35:25] anesthesia but uh you know for for you
[1:35:28] to make it to the operating table is
[1:35:31] very
[1:35:32] rare if any of you have ever had to go
[1:35:34] into a major surgery or something
[1:35:36] typically those
[1:35:37] anesthesiologist I mean they're
[1:35:39] undefeated I just tell you that much you
[1:35:41] can fight it all you want but you're
[1:35:42] going under yeah but but it was just odd
[1:35:45] that I remember I was conscious and I
[1:35:47] made it all the way back to the surgery
[1:35:49] table and those things man they are not
[1:35:51] like some comfortable bed it is a flat
[1:35:54] metal sterile table and I remember them
[1:35:58] Lifting me up and put me on that thing
[1:36:00] and I started talking to the the
[1:36:02] doctor's assistants and everything they
[1:36:03] go whoa buddy you ain't supposed to be
[1:36:05] awake back
[1:36:08] here and they're like they said you know
[1:36:11] it's time for you to go to your happy
[1:36:14] place and I told them I'll never forget
[1:36:17] I said my happy place is the word of God
[1:36:20] and I said though I walk through the
[1:36:22] valley of this now here I am on the
[1:36:24] operating table I'm under anesthesia I'm
[1:36:26] not supposed to be awake but here I'm
[1:36:28] laying on that table and there I'm
[1:36:30] saying yay though I walk through the
[1:36:31] valley of the shadow of death I will
[1:36:33] fear no evil for thou art with me thy
[1:36:36] rod and thy staff they comfort me thou
[1:36:38] preparest a table before the presence of
[1:36:41] my
[1:36:45] [Applause]
[1:36:50] ear
[1:36:53] next thing I wake
[1:36:56] up heart monitor heart rate I'm back
[1:37:00] like all right surgery's all over I'm
[1:37:01] like what what do you mean surgery's all
[1:37:06] over God prepares to oh yep I've been
[1:37:09] out for hours they had already performed
[1:37:10] the surgery I'm back in the recovery
[1:37:14] room and so this is where the journey
[1:37:17] would take place a little
[1:37:19] bit I woke up there in the recovery room
[1:37:23] and after coming home I ended up having
[1:37:26] some complications and having to go to
[1:37:27] the emergency room and and they had to
[1:37:30] to do some things there but um I
[1:37:32] remember uh the next day there in the
[1:37:35] hospital uh Dr Graves came in I said
[1:37:37] Doctor what's going on he goes it's just
[1:37:40] the devil I'm like now there's a doctor
[1:37:43] yeah that knows what he's talking about
[1:37:46] and all my life I've never gone to a
[1:37:48] doctor said Doctor what's wrong with me
[1:37:50] it's just the devil I'm like I can get
[1:37:52] with you there that's exactly right this
[1:37:55] is just the
[1:37:57] devil and so but it in in regards to
[1:38:00] those complications they were relatively
[1:38:03] minor to a degree and so but I I I know
[1:38:06] he was anxious to get lab results
[1:38:08] because they had they had Mo removed the
[1:38:09] tumor and that was the day we were going
[1:38:11] to go get the lab results back because
[1:38:13] like I said he gave that diagnosis just
[1:38:15] by his 40 years experience there hadn't
[1:38:17] been a a lab result come back but he
[1:38:19] said I'm going to go to the lab going to
[1:38:21] go see what they called in on the report
[1:38:23] and I'll never forget it wasn't but
[1:38:25] about 30 minutes later that it seemed
[1:38:27] like he came back to the room in a rush
[1:38:30] and in a hurry and and there was this
[1:38:32] look upon his face where he he came back
[1:38:34] to me said he goes hey I I just had to
[1:38:37] come back and tell you but he said I I
[1:38:40] I've been I've been doing this for 40
[1:38:41] years I've never seen this and in all of
[1:38:44] my my years of practice but it come back
[1:38:47] there's no cancer it's you're you're
[1:38:49] you're cancer free praise the
[1:38:52] Lord I said praise the
[1:38:57] Lord I I I he he was perplexed I I he
[1:39:01] goes I said well so what about the
[1:39:02] cancer treatment he's like you don't
[1:39:04] have cancer he's like I I it came back
[1:39:07] with
[1:39:09] some he didn't he wasn't even familiar
[1:39:11] with the diagnosis the when it come back
[1:39:13] with the labu something he hadn't seen
[1:39:14] before but basically said you're cancer
[1:39:16] free and so I was there recovering in
[1:39:18] the hospital and you know it struck me
[1:39:21] that here I I it was now we on a
[1:39:23] Wednesday night I believe the surgery
[1:39:25] was on Monday I ended up back in the
[1:39:26] emergency room on Tuesday overnight in
[1:39:28] the hospital on Wednesday now they're
[1:39:30] keeping me overnight we're having
[1:39:31] service back home and I'm streaming back
[1:39:33] home and I've I've shared the testimony
[1:39:35] and the News results when my dad he's
[1:39:37] he's up behind the pulpit and he starts
[1:39:39] to give uh the testimony there on
[1:39:41] Wednesday night he says he goes you know
[1:39:43] when when when they were doing the
[1:39:45] operation on on Matthew he said you know
[1:39:49] God took the life out of the cancer and
[1:39:53] then all of a sudden everything came
[1:39:55] back forth Circle exactly what he said
[1:39:57] he said yes but it wasn't until ma was
[1:39:59] on the operating table that I intervened
[1:40:03] you see it was God's will that I I would
[1:40:05] make it that far I did all I could do
[1:40:09] the doctors did all that they could do
[1:40:11] but when it came time God by divine
[1:40:14] intervention he came in and he removed
[1:40:17] that life out of that tumor that would
[1:40:19] have been malignant that would have been
[1:40:21] cancer I I I could have battled that for
[1:40:24] years but God rich in Mercy sovereignly
[1:40:27] he divinely intervened and he took the
[1:40:29] life out of that cancer it wasn't the
[1:40:32] doctor's operating table it was the
