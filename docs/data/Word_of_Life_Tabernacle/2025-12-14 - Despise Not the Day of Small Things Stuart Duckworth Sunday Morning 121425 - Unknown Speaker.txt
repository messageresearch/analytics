We commit it to you now. The reading of the word in Jesus name we pray. Amen. You love the Lord this morning. Amen. Just so happy to be here and happy to see each and every one of you. Amen. And if we could just turn in the scriptures to 2 Samuel 7. Amen. 2 Samuel 7 and 8. Just kind of want to speak on a thought of despise not the day of small things. 2 Samuel 7 and 8 says here now therefore so shall thou say unto my servant David thus sayeth the Lord of hosts I took thee from the sheepcoat and from following the sheep to be ruler over my people over Israel and I was with thee whethersoever thou west and have cut off all thine enemies out of thy sight and have made thee a great name like unto the name of the great men that are in the earth. Amen. You can be seated this morning. Just got one service here today. And so let's just pour all all of our attention and all of our effort this morning. And y'all help me preach and we'll I promise you we'll get out of here a little early. You can enjoy your your afternoon and your day. Amen. Here David God speaking to David here. But David had in his heart a desire that he wanted to build a temple for God. And God had done so much for David. He had brought him through so much. And David's sitting there and he's resting from his enemies. He's at peace from with his enemies. And he said, "How can I sit in a house of cedar and the ark of my God behind the curtains?" But we know that God wouldn't let David build the temple because of so much bloodshed and so much war. God would not allow David to build this temple. But he made a promise to David that his seed after him would build it. And the Lord said in his kingdom will I establish. So you know David David was had fulfilled his purpose. He was coming down to the end there. And you know, he had a desire to do this, but it wasn't for David to do that. It wasn't time yet for the temple to be built. But but God would through David's seed, through that faith, through that lineage would establish a kingdom. Amen. But we look that, you know, we're just kind of, this is just a simple thought here today. I'm telling you what, it's really simple. And so that they, you know, it's not going to get real deep here today, but but we look uh you know, he said, "I brought you from the sheep coat. I brought you you you were nothing, &gt;&gt; but I brought you and I I brought you to where you are now, and I brought you to a place where uh uh uh your your name was feared. Your name was great. You were absolutely nothing." But and that but that's what God does. God can take something from nothing and bring it. And we're still nothing. But God can use us. Amen. &gt;&gt; But where did where did God bring David from? He said, "I took thee from the sheep coat. I He brought him from hurting his father's sheep." &gt;&gt; From following sheep around all day. &gt;&gt; Following the sheep around, guarding the sheep. A amen. To be ruler from what? From guarding sheep. To be ruler over God's children, over God's kingdom. But see, David, listen to this. See, David was faithful over the little things. &gt;&gt; As Christians, it's not the big things that we do. It's the little things that we leave undone. Brother Ram said, &gt;&gt; but Jesus said, "Blessed are those that do the commandments of God &gt;&gt; that they might have a right to enter in." David was concerned uh there on on on down there there in the pasture. Uh God had great things laid out for David, no doubt. But David didn't know that. But but David was faithful over the little things. And that that's what I want to do. I just want to be faithful over what God's given me, over the family that God's given me, over the word that God has given us in this hour. Amen. I what what understanding you have this morning, wherever you're at in your experience, just be faithful in that. And God will bring you to greater things. He will bring you to what your purpose actually is. Amen. And as God God was with David, even in the little things that he looked over, God was with David. &gt;&gt; God was with David there as he as he watched over the sheep as he followed these these sheep around with a stick, with this a little staff, and uh uh just there watching over his father's possessions. They weren't even David's sheep. But he looked over them as though they were his own. He was faithful. He had a faithful heart to serve the father's will. When a bear rose up to destroy the sheep from David's faithfulness and there there in his position, the spirit of the Lord came upon a a amen came upon him and he slew that bear that would come against the sheep. when a roaring lion would come in and take and try to take and devour one of the father's sheep, David was there and there the spirit of the Lord, not David, but the spirit of the Lord came upon him and he slew that lion. And that's what makes the difference here today. And as simple as it is, Amen. We need the spirit of God among us. It It's not us. We can't do anything here this morning. I can't preach a lick. I can't do nothing. You can't receive nothing. But if the spirit of the Lord will come in the service today, amen, we might receive a little bit of encouragement. If I could just say something here today by the help of God that will encourage you along the way. Amen. Amen. And from that, Amen. You could you could take it with you. Amen. And the spirit of the Lord could take the word and direct it exactly where it needs to go. Amen. I don't just want the words of a man here today. I want the living bread of God, amen, that we can feed upon. I don't just want the inspiration of just studying and and intellectual thought. Amen. But we want to feed. Amen. We want to feast on the word of God here today that we can be strengthened, that we can be encouraged. &gt;&gt; Is that what you want here this morning? It's the spirit of the Lord that would come here today and direct the word of of the Lord to the hearts of the people. It would direct a minister to say exactly what God has intended for someone here today. And that's what we need. David needed the spirit of the Lord. He needed the spirit of the Lord. When the bear came, he couldn't defeat that bear. It took God to defeat that bear. He couldn't defeat that lion. It took God to defeat that lion. I can't defeat cancer this morning. It takes God to defeat cancer. And I say this morning, he's already defeated cancer. He's already a conqueror. God already made a way to defeat that bear. Amen. by the spirit of God that will come upon David. Amen. And if you'll believe this morning that you've got a purpose, if you'll be faithful as David was, amen, when your enemies come in like a flood, the spirit of God will raise up a standard against it. Amen. No weapon formed against you this morning shall prosper. Amen. Amen. This is a heritage of the children of God. Amen. It is your right. It is your heritage. It is your inheritance to overcome every demon that would come against you this this day and this hour. &gt;&gt; It is your heritage this morning. Amen. That the spirit of God, Amen, would come through you. Amen. Amen. And defeat your enemy. &gt;&gt; Amen. The spirit of the Lord was the difference. And it's the spirit of the Lord upon a faithful heart there. David who trusted in Jehovah God to deliver him from his enemies. See, whatever David did, he did it from his heart. David loved God with all of his heart. &gt;&gt; For God said, David, thou art a man after mine own heart. &gt;&gt; It didn't matter how small he was. It didn't matter that he was the smallest of his brothers. David's desire was to be faithful in all that he did and to love God with all that he was. Is that your desire this morning? Have you got just a just a little bit of desire to serve God? You ought to be thankful in this hour. There's people that don't care one lick about serving God. They don't care one lick about about the Bible and the things that are in the Bible. Amen. But there's a people I believe here today that that's got a desire in their heart that there's something that God placed in their a deposit. Amen. That wasn't you that done that. That was God that done that. That's God that placed that hunger in there to serve him and and to believe his word and to live his word. &gt;&gt; God done that. &gt;&gt; God placed that within his people. Amen. That we might serve him from our hearts. When King Saul was rejected by God, the Lord told Samuel to go to the house of Jesse, for I have provided me a king among his sons. And there Jesse went down or there Samuel went down to Jesse's house and as the sons of Jesse passed by, the prophet said, "Surely surely this is him." But 1st Samuel 16:7, let's just turn there as we go along here. 1st Samuel 16:7. But the Lord said unto Samuel, "Look not on his countenance or on the height of his stature, because I have refused him. For the Lord seeth not as man seeth, for man lookketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord lookth upon the heart." See, the election of God was upon the youngest. It was upon the least. Not that those men weren't capable, but here among the on on the youngest, on the least. And even the prophet thought it would be somebody else. But the Lord told Samuel, "This is him." And in the midst of his brethren, the prophet poured on him the horn of oil and anointed him, and the spirit of the Lord was upon him from that day forward. &gt;&gt; See, what the world rejects and looks down on is what God anoints. what the what the world disregards, what the world puts to the side. Amen. That's what God is looking to anoint. And I say today here this morning, God is looking to anoint someone with the spirit of God. God is looking to anoint someone here today that'll be willing with an open heart. Amen. That you they that can see that you've got a purpose. Amen. That you can see by the word of God that I was called. Amen. Amen. That that that you can see this morning. Amen. Your part in the word. Amen. The Holy Spirit is here to anoint today. He's here to energize your life and your belief and your faith and what you hold to in this hour. Amen. God is here on the scene. Amen. To back up his word. Amen. Amen. And by the spirit of the Lord, Amen. He'll come upon sons and daughters of God that will believe his word. He will come and anoint your life and give you strength and give you power &gt;&gt; over your enemy &gt;&gt; and to do what God has called you to do. I know that's simple, but without it we're a bunch of failures. &gt;&gt; Without it, without it, we can't do nothing. Right? You can try to give up habits of the world. You can try to do it on your own. Maybe some people are are successful, but it takes God to remove the the desire of sin. It takes God to remove the desire and the want to to do to partake in those things. Amen. We've been called to live different as Christians. We've been called to come out of this world and live different. And the only way you can do it is when God comes in and burns out that old desire by the spirit of God. God is looking to anoint young people, Amen. God is looking to bring Christians, Amen. Amen. that have just, you know, it's just become a common thing. It's just become a common thing. Amen. We're we're just in a habit in an old routine of just everyday life. Amen. God wants to shake us in this hour. God wants to do something in your life this morning. He wants to bring you and draw you closer to him and what you're supposed to be. &gt;&gt; Oh my God, come upon our lives in a greater way. come upon us in a greater way than what than what it was years ago. Oh my. We can talk about years ago and what God did years ago. And that's great and that's fine and that that's dandy and that's a stepping stone. But what about today? What about this morning? Amen. How this this service and we got one service today. Amen. And we're just a we're just a little group here today. We're just a small group insignificant. But what what does God want to do among us here today? What does God want to do in your life? Amen. God wants to answer questions. God wants to bring you through it this morning. God wants to pour into you divine strength this morning. Amen. That you can believe his word, that you can stand on his word, that you can take his word &gt;&gt; because the word is what defeats the enemy. &gt;&gt; I can't do it. You can't do it. But the Holy Spirit will energize just a little portion of the word and it will go and conquer. It will go forth and it will prepare the way before you. &gt;&gt; Look here at Psalm 16 and 8. What was David's? What worked for David? What made it work for David? I've set the Lord always before me. Remember, he's nothing. He's just follow He's just a follower of sheep. He's follow them around. Make sure they're protected. But David said, "I have set the Lord always before me. Because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved. &gt;&gt; I have set the Lord before me always." What are we setting before ourselves? Oh my. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; What are we setting before ourselves? Is it the Lord? &gt;&gt; I'm preaching to myself now. &gt;&gt; I'm not preaching Nobody but myself. What are we putting before us? What what's consuming our time? &gt;&gt; What's consuming our energy? &gt;&gt; What are we letting control us? &gt;&gt; Are we putting the Lord before us? Because if you put the Lord before you and he's at your right hand, you shall not be moved. &gt;&gt; You shall not be shaken. &gt;&gt; And that's that's the that's the problem with everybody. We're we got too much of everything else in front of us. Let's put the Lord before us. has put his word before us. &gt;&gt; 1963, God's gifts always find their places. I've always loved this quote. He says, "If you're a young woman, dedicate your morals. You're a young man, dedicate your morals, dedicate your mind, dedicate your thinking, dedicate your heart, dedicate your soul, dedicate all you are, and let Christ work through that." What a glorious thing. Cuz here's the thing of it. It's not all. It's not all fairy tales and unicorns, right? &gt;&gt; He said, "You've got the rivers to cross. You've got the bridges to go over. &gt;&gt; You've got the brier patches." Anybody ever been through a brier patch? &gt;&gt; You get cut up a little bit, don't you? &gt;&gt; The whole world, this world's a brier patch. &gt;&gt; Brother Allan, he killed a He killed a big buck out in the middle of a brier patch. Killed a big buck. I hadn't killed one yet. But he had he had to get to that spot. He had to go through a brier patch. It was tough. It wasn't easy. You got brier patches. You got the thicket. You got the woods. You got the dark places. You got the hills. You You got to climb the hills. You got to come up out of the valley. There's going to be more valley than there is hilltop. There's going to be more low experiences. You've got to crawl yourself out of the the the the mountain tops a a small point, but the valley is wide. The valley is wide. The hillside is steep. It's long, right? Amen. We're just on the mountaintop just for a little bit. You better enjoy it this morning if you're on the hilltop cuz there's a long slope coming. There's a long bottom that you've got to get through with some brier patches, with some dark places. You may not make it out during daylight. You may be going in the dark trying to get out of it. Amen. But we've got something. Amen. If we'll center on God if you'll dedicate what you are, God will bring you out of the valley. Amen. To that next mountaintop experience. &gt;&gt; He said you got heels to to climb. What are you doing? Someday you'll have to stand and look back and see where you came from and you're going to be judged by the course you take. He said, "Put your all, put your mind and your thoughts on that that north star, the center of God, and don't move from it." That's what I want to do this morning. &gt;&gt; That's what I want to do this morning. I want to dedicate myself. &gt;&gt; Many temples were dedicated in the Bible. They they took great lengths and and and and to dedicate these temples and so forth. And those temples, and we'll get into in a little bit, every one of those temples is has been ruined, has been destroyed or knocked down. But if you'll dedicate yourself here today, aresh to God. If you'll come to this service and say, "God, shake me from the formalism. Shake the coldness from my soul. Shake the coldness from my heart. If you'll rededicate yourself, Amen. I believe God will set your your heart a flame. He'll set your foot, amen, on the path that it needs to be. If we're rededicated, if we're walking over this way, amen, center back up on God this morning." &gt;&gt; That's what I want to put before us today. Give all you are. Dedicate all you are because this is what God wants. This building, what a fine building this is. But if time goes on, it will deteriorate. It will corrupt. Amen. But your life, your soul is worth more than a thousand worlds. That's what God wants dedicated to him. Amen. You may feel like a nothing this morning. You may be a nothing this morning, but God can take a nothing and make something. He can use you today if you'll let him. If you'll let him live through you. Amen. dedicate your life as a temple of the power of the Holy Ghost and let Christ work through that. &gt;&gt; There's going to be some rough spots, some dark places and valleys, but I shall not be moved. &gt;&gt; Let that be your testimony. I shall not be moved. I shall not be shaken. &gt;&gt; I shall not be shaken. I shall not be moved. I shall not slip &gt;&gt; because the Lord is before me always. &gt;&gt; Yes. Preach with me this morning. Losing my voice. Preach with me this morning. We've got some things that we still got to go through. &gt;&gt; David David was anointed king, but he had a lot of battles ahead of him. &gt;&gt; He had fought the bear and won. &gt;&gt; He had fought the lion and the spirit of the Lord helped him and he won. But David had many battles, &gt;&gt; many battles as as ordained king. Amen. He had many battles ahead of him. And there's going to be some threats of the enemy in this town. There's going to be a Goliath that's going to make his boat. You're going to run into him. Young people, you're going to run into him. Older folks and mid-ag folks, you're going to run into him. You're going to meet sickness, right? &gt;&gt; You're going to meet sickness that aspirin won't take care of. You're going to meet sickness that's incurable. You're going to meet that. But you're going to meet that sickness as David met that sickness as he met that Goliath. And we can meet him this morning. We can meet him together as the little flock with faith. Amen. You don't have to stand alone this morning. But we can stand with you. If you have a need in your body, if you have an incurable sickness, we can stand in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. And we can stand this morning and testify the word of God that it's the anointed word of God, that it's the living word of God, and that there's substance in the word of God. And if you need healing this morning, it is yours. And we're here to believe with you, sister. We're here to believe with you, brethren. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're going to meet these things, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Who believe? Who believes God is a healer? &gt;&gt; Who believes that this morning? We stand in faith this morning without a shadow of a doubt. Amen. Amen. We don't want to just come to the house of God to toot our toot our horn. We don't just want to come to the house of God to to preach against somebody down the road. Amen. But we come to minister this morning. We come to receive, amen, ministering from angel, spirits of God. We come this morning, amen, to receive from the Holy Ghost. Amen. What he would have for us. And I tell you this morning, you don't have to leave this place. Amen. Amen. Amen. In fear of your Goliath, in fear of whatever it is. Amen. But we can overcome. Amen. In the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Meet that sickness this morning. In the name of Jesus Christ, you're going to meet a Goliath. You're going to meet discouragement. You're going to meet inability. But meet it in the name of the Lord, &gt;&gt; and he will see you through. &gt;&gt; Christ as David. Christ is the anointed word, the anointed king, and he is the one will come and fight these battles. He is faithful this morning as David is faithful. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. He's more faithful. &gt;&gt; He's faithful in all things and he's an ontime God. &gt;&gt; You believe that this morning? &gt;&gt; Joshua 23 and9. For the Lord hath driven out from before you great nations and strong. But as for you, no man hath been able to stand before you unto this day. One man of you shall chase a thousand. For the Lord your God, he it is that will fightth for you as he hath promised you. &gt;&gt; What a promise that is. There's a promise of God &gt;&gt; that no man shall stand before you, no demon spirit shall stand before you. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that this morning? Amen. &gt;&gt; There is no demon that can stand before the bloodbought, bloodwashed bride &gt;&gt; of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Not by what we did, but by what he did. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; But he said here, and that's a promise to you this morning. He said, "Take good heed therefore under yourselves, listen to this, that you love the Lord your God." &gt;&gt; Don't don't put nothing before him &gt;&gt; and he'll come fight your battles. Thank you, Lord. But when we put something before him, our faith begins to drift drift away. Our confidence drifts away. But we want to come in full faith and full confidence this morning that the Lord is before us today. That his word is before us. Amen. That we're we're doing we're we're we're faithful in the little things. We're faithful in the small things. Not just in the great things. Not just coming to church once or twice a week, but in the little things, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. that we can have confidence in the promise. &gt;&gt; You got confidence in the promise this morning? &gt;&gt; You got confidence that it's the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let that be your testimony. Brother Brandham says here in in Y 1961, he said, "What could he do if he ever get one purpose in his grip person in his grip just so he can hold that one person?" How many of you want him to hold you this morning? &gt;&gt; I know this is simple. Lord, hold me. this in this hour. Keep me in this hour. He said he can put 10,000 to flight with that one person. With one person in genuine faith, he can put 10,000 devils running as hard as they can go. Yes, sir. Amen. I'm so glad. Aren't you? Aren't you glad this morning? The Lord told Joshua one for a thousand. But look here. The prophet told us one for 10,000. And it's not just one. Amen. But it's two. Amen. When God and man meet, Brother Ram said, Amen. two omnipotents meet. Amen. And and he said, when two omnipotent meet, something's got to happen. Don't let that go over your head. Amen. Amen. Amen. If you can truly believe, if you can truly believe the word of God, there is power in your genuine faith. Amen. Your pure, simple faith. Amen. As simple as it is, there's power in that this morning. There's power in your Amen. And we know on the other end that all power, all omnipotence, Amen. And when those two omnipotence meet, Amen. Brother said, something's got to take place. Something's got to happen. Amen. And I believe this morning, every devil, every demon that would rise up and persecute, Amen, the bride of Jesus Christ that would try to belittle you, that would try to try to dampen down your faith with unbelief and doubt. I believe we can send every devil this morning running. Amen. Amen. If we'll agree together, Amen. If we'll put the Lord before us this morning, every devil, every sickness, Amen. This isn't a workup. This is a promise to you that the Lord would come and fight your battles. &gt;&gt; Every demon in hell has been let loose on you and I. &gt;&gt; Every demon. Amen. Every demon in hell has been let loose. Not on the Baptist folks, &gt;&gt; but on those standing for the word of this hour. All hell, brother said, has been let loose on the bride, but all of heaven this morning. All of heaven has been let loose for you and I as well. Amen. For the word has been opened, amen. It wasn't just a theology, something uh uh an intellectual something that happened. Amen. But when something is loosened, amen, from the scriptures, amen, there's a power, amen, there's a power, amen, when the seals were open, amen, certain scriptures that were bound up for thousands or hundreds of years. Amen. Amen. Begin to roll in motion because what? The word had been loosened. Amen. And I want to say in this morning, everything that you have need of has been loosened to you by the opening of the word. by the opening of the word in this hour. &gt;&gt; Brother Ram said, "The third pull is the opening of the word." &gt;&gt; The third pull is the opening of the word. The word is here, but you've got to put the word on your lips. &gt;&gt; Despise not the little things. &gt;&gt; Despise not a little word &gt;&gt; from God. Yeah. &gt;&gt; For there's enough power in that to drive back 10,000 demons this morning. &gt;&gt; What has been loosened to us? The fullness of the opening of the word, the fullness of the manifestation of the God, which is what the pillar of fire identified among us. Brother Ram said that is the fullness of the manifestation of God. All that God was, he poured into Christ. And all that Christ was, he poured in the church. And God, Jesus said, Jesus said, "I came from God and I go back to God." And when he went back to God, Jesus spoke from that pillar of fire. It is the fullness of the manifestation, amen, of the spirit of God among the believers. Amen. Amen. For what? That we could put a picture and and look back of what something of what was. No, that we could stand here today and know that though I don't see him with a natural eye. Amen. A prophet of God said he's identified himself among you. And that's what my ministry is. Amen. The ministry of Jesus Christ. Amen. Sent to you and I this day. Amen. To identify that he is among us. Amen. And if you can believe this morning, put the Lord before you. Put his promise before you in this hour. Amen. Amen. Look beyond this realm. Amen. And see that there's a supernatural power &gt;&gt; here today. He has identified himself among us. Not only identified himself among us, but he is in our hearts. In our hearts by the spirit of God to cause every devil to flee, every demon of discouragement this morning. &gt;&gt; The demon that tells you that you're not worth it anymore. He tries to steal your joy. Tries to seal your purpose. &gt;&gt; Is it just me? &gt;&gt; The spirit of God is here to help you fight your battles. &gt;&gt; Drive that enemy back today. The scripture says they overcame by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony. Claim and apply the blood of Jesus over your life. That's simple, isn't it? Amen. &gt;&gt; But there's power in it. &gt;&gt; Have faith to apply the word over your home. Have faith to take the sword of the spirit and cut off your enemy's head. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; There's not one devil this morning that can stand before a son or daughter of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; There's not one spirit that can overwhelm you so much that is greater than the pillar of fire, that's greater than the Holy Ghost, that's greater than the angels that would minister to you to be happy. Be happy this morning. &gt;&gt; Lift your head up. &gt;&gt; Lift your head up this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. Be happy this morning. Be full of joy. The joy of the Holy Ghost is there for you this morning. if you want it. &gt;&gt; There's no devil that can stand before you. For it is the Lord that fights for you. You may feel small this morning. You may feel like nothing. &gt;&gt; But you're the very purchase of God's own blood. &gt;&gt; He cares more about you. Brother Brham said he cares more about you than he did his own life. He cared more about you and I than he did his own blood. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that this morning? Amen. Somebody cares about you. Somebody did care about you. Amen. God cares about you. So the Bible says, "Cast all your cares upon him, for he cares for you." &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; 2 Samuel 23:14. I'm trying to hurry and then slow down and take my time all at the same time. That I don't know. 2 Samuel 23:14. Remember I titled despise not the little things. God brought David from nothing and anointed him, right? Just uh just one person can put a lot of devils to fly. One person out of nothing. &gt;&gt; So despise not the little things. Despise not your faith. Despise not who you are as a person. Right. 2 Samuel 23:14, "And David was in an in an hold, and the garrison of the Philistines was in in Bethlehem." Brother said, "David was here in his worst time. He was a fugitive." Here he was in his worst time. He'd already been anointed to be king. He knew what he was. He knew what he was supposed to be. And brother Bram said he was there. He was standing between two fires. the Philistines on one side and Saul on the other. A a king, a fugitive on the run. He was in the worst place that he could be because he knew the potential that he had. He knew that what he was, but yet yet here he's running from Saul. He's in a disagreement with the church down the road. And things ought not be like that, right? &gt;&gt; It ought not be like that. We find ourselves in those tough spots. Brother R say he's in his worst spot that he could be. Am I preaching to somebody this morning? Maybe everybody's in a good spot this morning. I don't know. I hope you are. &gt;&gt; There the Philistines on one side and Saul on the other. And they're a fugitive of man. Brother Brham said without a nation anointed to be king over a nation. But they're on the run. He was in an awful place. But he says here in why little Bethlehem, what a what a title that is. He had taken refuge in strongholds in the in the wilderness and caves trying to hide out with a little band of faithful warriors. Yet a few believing like him. But those men believed God that that would be the king. So is the believers today who is hid out from place to place. But yet they know who's coming to be king. &gt;&gt; He said they hold to God's unchanging hand. &gt;&gt; In the midst of battle, in the midst of tears, he said in the midst of sickness and death and everything. Preach with me this morning. In the midst of all that, they still hold to God's unchanging hand. Amen. Are you holding this morning? They know that he's coming king. Amen. David there between his enemies running for his life on the run in the middle of summer in the middle of the heat. &gt;&gt; Oh, you appreciate a cold day like this today &gt;&gt; when it's 110. And &gt;&gt; I'll take this over 110 any day. Amen. &gt;&gt; Any day of the week, &gt;&gt; you can have it. &gt;&gt; You can have it there. The heat almost too much to bear. He's beginning to wonder. Brother Brandham said he's becomes frustrated. He's wondering why God called him. And here he's caught up between his enemies, between the fires. But here on the in the in this hole up, he looks down on this mountain side. But he looks down upon this city where he was born and he begins to remember all the battles that were fought and how God came down and helped him. He begins to remember, amen, that he is his strength. That he is his keeper. Begins to say he's my shield and my buckler. He would say my the Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want. He looks on this hillside. reason in the worst place he can be. He looked down towards the mountain side towards the well of Bethlehem. Bethlehem had the best water. He began to remember how he watered his sheep. Watered his sheep out of that well. And the scripture says, "And David longed and said, oh that one would give me a drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate." Verse 16. And the three mighty men break through the host of the Philistines and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem that was by the gate and took it and brought it to David. Nevertheless, he would not drink thereof. But he poured it unto out into the Lord out unto the Lord. And he said, "Be it far from me, oh Lord, that I should do this. Is not this the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives? Therefore, he would not drink it. So thirsty, perhaps dying of thirst, maybe the thirstiest he's ever been, but he poured it upon the ground out of respect for the men that believed him. And it's the same as our Lord Jesus. He didn't hold within his life, but he spilt it out upon the ground. Why? Because he loves you. &gt;&gt; Because he loves you this morning. He did not hold within himself, but he poured it out upon the ground. But look at these men. At David's very least desire, despising not the little things. All he wanted was a drink. He was so thirsty. And all he wanted was a fresh drink from the well. It was his desire. And these warriors were willing to do whatever was needed. These mighty gentile warriors were willing to go through the battle, fight through 15 miles of Philistine soldiers for a drink of water. Realize these men, these Philistine soldiers, they weren't just here and there. They were around the well. They were standing around the well. They were drinking from that well. And David was cut off. But his mighty Gentile warriors, these men that believed him, they fought and they made a way. Amen. Why? Because of the least desire of the heart of David for one drink. Despise not the little things, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. He wants us this morning to fight. He wants you to fight this morning. You may feel like a nothing. Amen. But the anointing that was on David poured out, spilled out upon these men. The inspiration that was upon David. Amen. That he wanted to drink. Amen. Amen. That poured out their love for David. Amen. Amen. gave him the inspiration, amen, to fight. To fight through formalism, to fight through a cold church service, amen, to fight, amen, a cold spirit that will come upon your home, upon your heart, amen, to drive you from the presence of God. Amen. They fought through that. Amen. It was a tough battle. Amen. But they overcame. Amen. Amen. Because of David's least desire, they brought him a drink. &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. Destroy those spirits. You have to destroy those spirits. You have to fight through that to bring our Lord Jesus a drink this morning. Amen. Destroy every doubt. I'm sorry if I'm blowing into that. Destroy every doubt and every unbelieving spirit that says he's not the same as he was yesterday. &gt;&gt; Destroy that this morning. And you can have your promise. You can you can bring David a drink this morning if you'll destroy that. &gt;&gt; Amen. Have faith in him for who he is as God this morning. He's the son of God. Have faith in his word this morning. Have faith that he is your victory. Have faith this morning that that if you're you're meeting a a Goliath this morning, have faith that he is your healer, that he is your deliverer. Amen. Have faith this morning that he is the revealed word. He is the revealed vindicated word of this hour. Amen. and take your stand. Fight your battle. Amen. Amen. What he wants today is a drink of water. Amen. His is He's worthy this morning. He's worthy of your life. He's worthy of your testimony. He's worthy of everything that we can give him. Though we're not saved by works, we're saved by grace. Amen. But because we love him, because of his least desire, we'll believe his word. &gt;&gt; I love this. Brother Ram says, "Oh, come stand with me by my side. I wish I could put it up here. I'm not that smart. I'm standing in a terrible place. I challenge today." He says, "These tapes go over the world. I challenge some man, some warrior who loves Jesus Christ and knows that these things has got to be fulfilled today, brethren. Come stand by my side and come pull the word of God. Forget those dried sisters, excuse me, and stagnated denominations that you're living in. pull the fresh word of God. Let's give Jesus a good drink of fresh Pentecostal water. &gt;&gt; Amen. The the prophet's challenging the people of that day. And no doubt some of you took heed to that challenge. You come out of those sistns. You come out of that stagnated water. What? To a well. Amen. An everlasting well, a spring flowing up. Amen. Of the goodness of God, of the mercy of God. He said that's his desire today. Back to the original Pentecost. Back to the word. He said it's prophesied we do so in Malachi the 4th chapter return to the faith of the children back to the fathers again who would stand this morning. He said stand by me. Let's cut a hole through this denominational creed. Let's get in there. He's crying for a good fresh drink of Pentecostal water. Original Pentecost. Listen to this. He said not a bunch of carrying on screaming hollering. I mean a real genuine Holy Spirit baptism that produces the life of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; back into the person. &gt;&gt; That's what we're fighting for today. &gt;&gt; That's what we're fighting for. &gt;&gt; That's what we're standing for. &gt;&gt; That's what we we've been returned back to. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The ministry of Jesus Christ came through a prophet in this day. It wasn't the ministry of a man, but it was the ministry of Jesus Christ to minister back us back to the foundation of the apostolic fathers. And what was it? Yeah, it was hollering and shouting. It was healings. It was all kinds of things. But what was it? It was something, amen, that changed their lives. It was something that made them different. And that's what we're earnestly contending for this morning. Amen. The faith that was once delivered to the saints. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You believe that? Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that Is that our fight? &gt;&gt; His least desire. That's what he wants this morning. Try to hurry. Is a drink of that life of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; If you're living that life this morning, you're giving him a drink. He He's He's pleased. It's &gt;&gt; You understand? That's what he wants. &gt;&gt; That's all he wants. &gt;&gt; That's it. And what does that what does that produce? It produces a real sanctified life full of not yourself but the Holy Ghost. It does not produce an arrogance but it produces a sweet Christlike Christminded a heart centered on being faithful in all things. Those warriors moved at the at his least desire. Brother Brham challenge us. Will you move this morning? Will you move where you're sitting? I'm not asking you to stand up. Will you move where you're at? Will you move where you've been for the last 20 years? Will you move out of that condition this morning? I'm asking you, &gt;&gt; will Will we move when God calls us to move? I want to move when God calls us to move. When he inspires me, I want to move. I want to give him a fresh drink. Amen. So, not something old stagnated, but a fresh drink of worship. What is it? It's a supernatural strength that God gives to the believer. A desire to serve him and live for him in this dying generation. And there's a strength that comes when you're in the service for the king. And he wants someone this morning who will simply stand for him and believe. Amen. And his power and his anointing as it came upon those men comes and helps you. He's the coming king. Do you believe that this morning? &gt;&gt; Everything else will be torn down. &gt;&gt; Every everything will be torn down and his kingdom will stand. And David had a desire as we read. David had a desire. He wanted to build something. He wanted to build a a a temple for the ark of God that was there sitting in the curtains. But it wasn't for David to do that. But it was for his seed after him. But even the great temple that Solomon built would be broken and would be torn down. the greatness and the glory of that kingdom even even as great as it was could not even endure being torn down. Amen. So will this earthly that you and I have it will corrupt. It will pass away. Every bit of our possessions, it will it will corrupt. Amen. It will rust. It will pass away. Amen. But I believe this morning that his word will never fail. His covenant can never fail. Amen. And I believe this morning, his mercy, his mercy endures forever. Everything else can pass away. Everything can go. Even in the greatness, even what God would allow in the natural, it will pass away. But the spiritual, what God God does spiritually for you young people, what he does, Amen, that is eternal. That is everlasting. It is something that the kingdom of hell cannot destroy. It is a covenant. Everything will pass away, but his mercy endures forever this morning to his people. &gt;&gt; We can get out of step, but his mercy endures forever. &gt;&gt; I'm counting on that. &gt;&gt; I'm counting on that with everything I've got. His grace endures. His grace brings us through. Right? Even when we don't do the little things, even when we don't do what we're supposed to do, God's mercy endures forever. His covenant, Solomon didn't do what he was supposed to do. And that's that's partly why his kingdom went the way it did and it just went downhill after that after that. Amen. But God would raise up a seed, a true seed of David that would bring a kingdom that would bring a kingdom to a people that could not be moved. Should I let y'all out early? Brother Harvey said, "Yep, you love the Lord this morning." &gt;&gt; Golly, what should I do here? We should have had two services. You love the Lord. Try to skip some of this. Okay. Is that all right? You think of the little things. Micah 5:2. But thou Bethlehem, though thou be little amongst the thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall come forth unto me that is to be a ruler in Israel. Micah 5:2. whose goings forth have been from old and from everlasting. Out of little Bethlehem. Little there it means insignificant. It means unimportant, &gt;&gt; right? Nothing. But out of Bethlehem will come a ruler. Will come a ruler. Would come a governor &gt;&gt; that would set up a kingdom that could not be moved. A promise would be given to a virgin. In Isaiah 7:14, "Therefore, the Lord himself shall give you a sign. Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name Emanuel." What a promise. No doubt the young ladies, ever since that promise was spoken, oh, that it's got to be me. And the word drives us to live according to the word. When you put the promise before you, no doubt there was worthy young ladies that could have fulfilled that promise. But he had one. He had Mary. He had someone in mind, right? &gt;&gt; Mary received the message from the angel. She received the promise. She received the word and not in her own intellect, but she received the word for what it was. She didn't complicate the thing. &gt;&gt; Right. Brother Rams preached God hiding himself in simplicity and he reveals himself in the same and it's simple. Don't put your interpretation to the word. Take it for what it is and let God interpret it the way he wants to. &gt;&gt; She received the word for what it was. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She didn't question it. She said, "Be it unto me." As the angel ministered to her, she said, "Be it unto me according to thy word." And what happened? It brought forth what the scriptures said. It brought forth Emanuel, God with us. It brought forth Jesus Christ. It brought forth the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords. It brought forth Amen. Amen. By the Holy Ghost, it brought forth, Amen. a creative blood. I'm glad these girls aren't here this morning to write down how many times I said amen. &gt;&gt; But it it bring it brought forth, what did it do? From a simple belief, from from simply believing the word and one simple promise. Amen. ministered by an angel. It brought forth the blood of Jesus Christ. It brought forth the blood of God. Amen. Despise not the little things. And in that blood was a chemistry to set me free, to heal your body, to set this church free, to set every person free. Amen. That whatever, Amen. received that blood in faith. Amen. Amen. And it's common faith this morning. Amen. Amen. And applying the token, they they applied the blood with hissip. And brother Random said that's a common weed. Faith is a common thing this morning. Amen. And you can apply the blood. Amen. Amen. Despise not the little things. Despise not the faith that you have. &gt;&gt; Despise not the chemistry of the blood &gt;&gt; that would set us free this morning. &gt;&gt; You love the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Luke 12:32, "Fear not, little flock, for it's your father's good will to give you the kingdom. This kingdom that he gives can't be torn down. &gt;&gt; This kingdom can't be moved." &gt;&gt; I'll try to finish up here with this. God is interested in the small things. We know the the testimony of the little fish. There, Brother Rams in the boat. There were those Jehovah's Witness men. And there they caught this little video, bluegill, whatever it was, and swallowed the hook, right? And you know, it's it's hard to get that hook out and it's just a little insignificant fish, right? So, you just yank it out and throw the fish on the bank. But they're they begin to talk about the things of God and and different things and and God sovereignly sovereignly comes down tells brother Brown stand up little fishy. I give you your life back. &gt;&gt; Right. This is the third pull. Now this is the power that is among us. &gt;&gt; Yes. not to try to recreate because it's sovereignly, but the power of the word is in our midst. The power of the word is for the believer. &gt;&gt; There are insignificant fish. Many people I think he talked about the the ones that are epileptic that needed prayer, but they're he said it shows you that God cares about the little things. God cares about the insignificant things. And I I just want to encourage her faith this morning, Sister Hattie, right? She gave what little bit of tithe money that she had. It wasn't much. The prophet was going down to give it back to her. He didn't need it. She needed it worse than he did. Just a little bit of money, but she was following the commandment of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And there, Brother Brandham, she's welcomed in his home. And there they're talking about the things that had happened in the squirrels and different things and how how creation happened and not knowing much. Just a little woman that's nothing but the truth. That's right. &gt;&gt; She didn't say a great thing. She just believed the word. She believed what happened. And out of that, he said, "You said the right thing, Haddie." All she said was, "That's nothing but the truth." Right? But it's just the little things. And there he said, "Whatever you want, it will be." I believe that with all my heart, &gt;&gt; I believe with all my heart that took place. &gt;&gt; Whatever you want. There's your sister. She's been crippled for however many years. You can have all the money in the world you want. But God seen her desire. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Her least desire. He knew what it was. It wasn't for for that and for sure she would love to see her sister healed. I'd love love to have a we'd love to have a pocket full of money, wouldn't we? A bank full of money. &gt;&gt; But that's what lasts is is the soul. It seems insignificant one person but brother Broom said it's worth thousand worlds 10,000 worlds. It's the little things. I'll try to close here but musicians can come. You just take God and simplicity. Somebody asked brother Brandham. They said, "How do we get closer to God?" What'd he say? Read your Bible and pray. Yeah, &gt;&gt; it's so simple, but we overlook it. It's so simple, we can't take it. We want something great. &gt;&gt; We want some great audible. &gt;&gt; It's It's that simple. Amen. You love the Lord this morning. Amen. You stand. If you have a need this morning, I'd be happy to pray with you. Just God bless you this morning. Come sing. Oh, were made there just for me. [Music] Oh, for all my sin, my sickness, and my pain. [Music] When I need healing, I just claim those preious blood stains. Once again, with our hands lifted to him.

Lord, I seek you. Help me find you. How I need your touch. [Applause] Find my drying in broken places. Thirsty for your love. [Music] Lord, forgive me if I've wondered [Music] far away from you. You are all I ever needed. Come and make me new. Pour your spirit out on me. Fall just like the rain. Saturate my thirsty soul. Come and fall aresh on me. Fill my cup again. Heal my heart and make me whole. [Music] Lord, I need you now. Amen. Can we sing that again with our hands lifted just before we go? Oh, pour your spirit out on me. Fall just like the rain and saturate my thirsty soul. Come and fall aresh on me. Fill my cup again. [Music] Heal my heart and make me whole. Lord, I need you now. Pour your spirit out. Amen. Can we give the Lord a hand clap or pray? [Music] Amen. Did you enjoy that service this morning? Amen. Brother Stewart just did a fantastic job. Amen. If all hearts are clear and and no one needs prayer. Let's sing that song just before we go. I love to praise him. Key of G. Amen. We'll sing this through a few times and then you're free to go in the name of the Lord. Remember the service coming up Wednesday. I believe Brother Timothy Puit will be here. So just be praying for that service coming up Wednesday. I love to praise him. Praise him. Praise him in the morning. Praise him in the time. Praise him. Praise him. Praise him. Once again, I love to praise him. Praise him. Praise him in the morning. Praise him in the time. Praise him. Praise him. Praise him in the sun. You're free to go in the name of the Lord. Sometimes I feel like heaven comes down. Sometimes I feel like heaven comes down. Sometimes I feel like heaven comes down. Praise him. Praise him in the morning. Praise him in the new time. Praise him. Praise him. Praise him when the sun goes down. [Music]
