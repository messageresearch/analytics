directly to our needs tonight we'll give you the praise and the glory and the honor in Jesus name amen amen turn with me if you would to Psalm chapter 105 Psalm 105 ver 17-19 it's good to see everybody here tonight Mom you moved on me I didn't see you out here I was about to call out a search party you don't worry about your mother until she gets older and on my camera she's hiding right in the spot where you can't see it so amen it's good to be in the house of the Lord tonight isn't it amen amen Psalms 10517 he sent a man before them even Joseph who was sold for a servant whose feet they hurt with feathers he was laid in Iron until Welly you could preach on that right there until the time that his word came the word of the Lord tried him pray the Lord would add his Blessing to the word you may be seated I want to speak tonight on Joseph and maybe if the Lord is willing will uh preach a few services on this on uh Joseph as being an almost perfect type of Christ and tonight we want to deal with learning obedience brother brandom said you watch Joseph he said he just portrayed The Life of Christ almost perfect but he made a mistake to show that it wasn't him so it wasn't he wasn't a perfect man as Christ was he made a mistake his mistake was a relatively minor one he wasn't out sinning he wasn't around running around with women he wasn't drinking or smoking or doing drugs but he was uh he had made a mistake in Genesis 46 it's good to see is that this millenia's cousin is that right good to see you tonight God bless you thank you for coming uh his mistake was was uh telling what we would call a white lie it it would it wasn't really that bad at all or what we would think was bad but brother random showed that it wasn't Christ because he never lied aren't you glad for that aren't you glad that he's not a man that he could lie and he come down even in a body of Flesh he couldn't lie which the flesh was man was human but he did not tell a lie now being that he had made that mistake it was you find in Genesis 46:33 and it says it shall come to pass when Pharaoh shall call you and shall say what is your occupation this is ringing really bad she'll say what is your occupation he says that you shall say thy servant's trade hath been about cattle from our youth even until now both we and also our fathers that you may dwell in the land of Goan for every Shepherd is an abomination of the Egyptians we just got done talking about Abraham and you can really see that family strain there's just a a little bit of cowardice in that family tree because Abraham did it and Isaac did it and now Joseph is trying to get them say well just kind of fudge about who you are but that's not what he was supposed to do and his father Jacob who had learned better in his life he said the Father the spirit wouldn't let him do it he said your servants the shepherd so you see brother brand said Joseph there making a mistake so he was making a mistake now we know that Jesus is the perfect one in First Peter 2:21 he said for even here unto were you called because Christ also suffered for us leaving us an example that you should follow his steps he never told us to follow the steps of Moses or to follow the steps of uh of Joshua to follow the steps of David but he said follow the steps of Christ who did no sin neither was guile found in his mouth who when he was reviled reviled not again if you go back to that Gile found in his mouth that's that was the mark against Joseph is that there was G found in his mouth but this one never even told a white lie when he was reviled he reviled not again when he suffered he threatened not oh that we could follow those steps tonight that's the kind of steps I want to walk in he said but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously who his own self bear our sins in his own body on the tree that we being dead to sin should live unto righteousness by whose Stripes ye were healed amen he was the perfect son right the perfect the only perfect human ever and so you can just let yourself off the hook there you're never going to be perfect because he was the only perfect one we are perfected by his blood was shed on Calvary every Prophet was imperfect but Jesus was the Masterpiece he was the Masterpiece brother BR said what was he he was that perfect word reflected for bread I love this that every man should live by he was that wheat of God's word that could be ground and put in the four gospels 66 books and man shall live by that and that alone and every word of it he said that was Michelangelo's Masterpiece and when God could see himself reflected in a man he had that perfect man created in his own image he said oh my what a man he had to die for all of us and he died the perfect one that we imperfect could be made perfect in him aren't you glad for him today I think we could all say Amen to that aren't you glad for the perfect one we could be made perfect in him you kids you worry about making mistakes and offending your pastor or the your parents or something like that don't don't worry about it remember you're human but God is is the perfect one he came in a body of Flesh to pay for my mistakes and your mistakes I'm so glad that he did we shouldn't we shouldn't worry about our mistakes I said before get up and try again that's absolutely what we ought to do absolutely what we ought to do is get up and go because that's exactly we're we're children of God we're not saves anymore we're children of God if we if we make a mistake we should repent quickly and move on and what does repentance take repentance take just a moment and say Lord I'm sorry and I'm moving on sure there's things you can do to scar your life in such a way that there are people on this Earth that have scarred so badly they can't even be around other people shut up in a prison somewhere or or in a prison of their own making and unable but they can still experience the love of God they can still be born again they can still experience the cleansing of the blood right the perfect one learned obedience through suffering now how can a perfect one learn well the thing is he he matured he matured he was born as a baby into the world right Jesus didn't come out of the womb talking in King James English right he wasn't just born saying thou Mary Who Bore me you know that's not the way he talked he'd come out talking just like we did goo goo and you know just like our babies do right whatever is however a baby talks I don't it's been so long as my kids were small I don't remember but however a baby talks that's the way he talked and he cried like a baby he talked like a baby and he and he learned you know if they had bicycles back then he'd learned to ride a bike right they had to teach him how to ride a bike he just because he was God in flesh but he learned as a human Oh Oh my he had to learn even never making a mistake yet he had to be tempted and he had to be tried and he had to grow he had to learn so don't give up on yourself you just have to learn youve got something to you got room to grow you got a you got room to to move up and so over time we grow and we learn the problem is when you see someone stuck in babyhood we don't want to stay there we want to move on we want to grow we want to become a mature son or daughter of God right and so he was the perfect one Hebrews 5'8 says though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered obedience I don't think I think we look at this wrong because we look at it as if he was disobedient and he learned to obey but he couldn't have been disobedient to God and been the perfect one so he didn't learn to move from Disobedience to obedience what did he learn he learned obedience in other words he he learned a maturity in his reactions that maybe wouldn't have been there at first because he had to go to a cross for you and I and even then he had to say nevertheless not my will but thine be done and that takes a great deal of maturity so Hebrews 5:9 says and being made perfect that's being matur being fully matured he became the author of Eternal salvation unto all them that obey him now watch in brother BR said in plain language the very character of Jesus was perfected by someone say it suffering and according to Paul he has left his church a measure of suffering that they too by their faith in God while suffering for him would come to a place of perfection now this is obviously not speaking of sinless perfection because we we are perfect by the blood of Jesus Christ right and nothing can take that away if you've been born again and no matter what you've done where you've been you're perfect in that way but yet you're not born a full grown man or a full grown woman you have to grow up into Christ and so so you have to you have to mature now we we don't have a record of Jesus early years except for one thing we have a record of his birth but we don't have a record of his early years except for a brief visit to to the temple when he was 12 and you find Jesus at the temple you remember he's down there instructing the scholars right and he's already got the wisdom to be able to do that and yet when his parents come to get him the Bible says he subjected themselves or himself to to them he said I must be about my father's business yet he didn't go back to the temple and break away from his family and go down there and start teaching people he didn't begin his ministry for many many more years he doesn't reemerge until he's 30 years old now look what a perfect type this is of Joseph Joseph went through his years of suffering and and then in Genesis 41:46 Joseph was 30 years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt and and so it was a there was something about that age that maturity that he had reached through suffering before that time he was able to do that now even when Jes Jesus began his ministry he wasn't like some people who just uh well I got saved yesterday let me go find a church you know and I'll go Pastor a church I I got saved last week so I'll go become a deacon that's not what he did at all but Jesus when he was on the Earth was actually reluctant to begin his own Ministry because and it showed what it showed what was in him the character that was in him because when he began his ministry it was obviously the will of God for him to do it and yet he even was reluctant when his mother come to him and said they don't have any wine for the wedding and Jesus said woman what have I to do with thee this is John 2:4 my hour is not yet come right but what's he doing he's not being rebellious but what's he doing he's waiting and the Bible tells us to wait on our ministry to wait to to make sure or make our calling and our election sure there's nothing wrong with waiting if you feel led of God to do something wait right and see if it's the will of the Lord you don't always you know we don't just go by feelings cuz feelings can lie to you feelings your heart will lead you wrong the the Bible says it's it's incredibly Wicked your heart is and it's deceitful above all things so you don't just go by what you feel but you wait and you wait and you wait until the proper time and when the proper time comes and brother Brown makes a statement he said when when God's men if you really called to do something we read it Sunday night he said God has to almost force you into do it into your proper place but in the meantime he said well what can I do in the meantime do what needs to be done whatever that is but don't try to overstep what you are are you with me so far so there come a time though in Jesus life that the father came down in an adoption ceremony and said this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased hear ye him oh my and Jesus was not reluctant then to to go and do what he was called to do because he had been it had been confirmed that he was he was the son of God that had come to full maturity and that's the place that God wants to bring us to now Joseph had to reach a place of maturity in his life he he always seemed to do the right thing Joseph did he wasn't a bad kid he was a very good kid but he needed maturity and sometimes we we look at that and we think well here's a person who was raised in church and you young people being raised in church what a wonderful blessing that is but but yet you you still don't have maturity until you've gone through some things so there's going to be some things ahead and I'll say to you now don't get discouraged don't be downhearted you say well this one fell and that one fell and and that one went away and and this one that I trusted they turned out not to to be false but you had to go through that to be who you are are you hearing me tonight you had to go through that you had to experience that maybe parents that let you down family members that let you down people that let you down you had to experience that and I'll say I've reached a place in my life for the Caleb where I'm so thankful for the way I was brought up because I know I can look back it was hard sometimes it was very hard on me it was hard on my mother it was hard on my siblings but yet I know if God hadn't brought me through that I couldn't be what I am today I couldn't be where God has placed me today and so I also know that the things that I'm going through today that God's going to use that to bring me to something tomorrow are you with me now we got to have that kind of perspective about it and God's going to allow us to go through these things until we gain the right perspective and maybe that'll be right before the Rapture I don't know but we got to reach that place of maturity where we don't get too high and we don't get too low huh right where Satan can't steal from us on every occasion but we learn how to lock down our spirit right to keep him from casting out every evil thought right where we don't we don't just open ourselves up to everything the devil offers right so you young people I'll say this find someone older and learn from that person if you're a young Deacon you find an older Deacon and learn from that Deacon if you're a young preacher you find an older preacher and learn from that preacher and I still have to do that today and I'm not old but I've got a lot of miles on me but but still look at older ministers and say how did you do it how what what have you come through and I like to hear those stories I like to sit there and talk to them because I know that they know something that I don't know and I want to I want to make it I want to be one of those guys one of these days that that's made it 30 years or 50 years with the Lord teres and in order to do that I know I've got to learn from them are you with me now well how did you get where you're at so Joseph had to learn that the Bible tells us in Genesis 3 72 Begins the story of Joseph it said these are the generations of Jacob Joseph being 17 years old what Mark that in your mind was feeding the flock with his Brethren so he was Peter's age not to not to call out Peter but Peter and trip I think is 17 as well so we got several 17 year olds are you Emma are you 17 yet you're 17 so that's there's three of them at least so I'm preaching right at you all tonight and Jacob Joseph was 17 years old and was feeding the flock with his Brethren so he just got a job right and the lad was with the sons of bilha and with the sons of Zila his father's wives and we may go into that at some point there was all kinds of friction in the family because anytime you have anytime you have a mixed family there always going to be friction that's why God didn't ordain polygamy man did that God allowed it but God it wasn't in his perfect will it was something that God allowed because he knew the nature of men without the Holy Ghost right but but this with the Holy Ghost I believe you can be happy with one wife amen not just preachers but everybody just throw that in there for the polygamist Among Us hope there's not any so Joseph brought unto his F now now watch this is such a such an interesting thing I just love the scriptures Joseph brought into his father their evil report that's interesting isn't it right he's 17 years old he just got his first job and the very first thing that's written about him is him telling on his brothers now they didn't have a cause to hate him but they thought they did now we don't we don't know what the report was it was evil report it might have been they they ate their food with their hands instead of using a fork we don't we don't know what it was that that they he found to tattle on them about and and and what he did even he was probably in the right in telling because these were not too good of boys you know they were doing some stuff they shouldn't have been doing probably we know that by some of the other things that they did so what he did what may have been right but he couldn't be a help to his brothers at this stage in his life because he hadn't been through anything yet he was his father's favorite son we'll get to that in another message but he was a he was actually uh uh he he saw himself as that he saw himself he had a vision on his life he had a purpose in his life he had a future in his life and so he and he knew all of that are you still with me I know it's a Wednesday night but I just want to try to paint this picture to you he knew all of that and so and so he he recognized hey I'm special right but he didn't have the humility to help his brothers yet he could see the problem but he couldn't fix it and that takes obedience learned by suffering see to voluntarily lay down our will in favor of the father's will that only comes through suffering Joseph is a tail Bearer right according to that scripture see because just because we know something is true doesn't mean we should tell it there are some things that have to be told but many times we tell things that don't have to be told to people who don't have to hear it right and the Bible says Leviticus 19:16 Thou shalt not go up and down as a tail Bearer among the people neither shalt thou stand against the blood of thy neighbor I am the Lord proverbs 11:13 the tail Bearer reveal the secrets but he that is of a faithful spirit I say oh God give me a faithful Spirit conceal the matter Proverbs 188 the words of a tail Bearer are as wounds and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly Proverbs 2019 he that goeth about as a tail Bearer reveal Secrets therefore meddle not with him that flattereth with his lips other words somebody going around always telling you uh always telling you how good you are and how much they love you and all this and not that a person shouldn't say I love you but this is where someone just always buttering you up you know there's something wrong what are they wanting information right they're looking for information so so listen what he says he said where no wood is there the fire goeth out so where there is no tail Bearer The Strife ceaseth I preach this a lot because I live here and living in Hardy is a lot like being on Mars Hill in Acts 17 Paul went to Mars Hill he said for all the Athen Athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else but either to tell or hear not some new thing and that scripture spoke to me it's good to have brother Ron and sister Karina with us tonight as well I you know I uh it just we love our area don't we and I've I defend these people there's some people here have been through some things I've learned some things I don't believe our church is like that but but there are folks around and we just don't want to be any of those we don't be want to be of that number we're not supposed to be tail bearers James 3 And1 said my brethren be not many Masters no knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation for verse two for in many things we offend all If any man offend not in word the same as a perfect man a mature man and able also to Bridle the whole whole body right he said he said this is maturity now if you're able to hold your tongue he said behold we put bits in the horses mouths that they may obey us and we turn about their whole body behold also the ships which though they be so great and are driven of fierce winds yet they are turned about with a very small Helm withs soever the governor listeth even so the tongue is a little member and boasteth great things behold how great a matter a little fire can you know and I know we all talk we all say things maybe we shouldn't say but how dare we go when we know that the wood is dry right a a and we sit there and blow on it and we we we we got our own little way we got a a propane torch in our back pocket we just sit there right and then and then was like well I don't know how fire started right sometimes CU we started it are you with me now I'm talking about maturity he said the tongue is a fire a world of iniquity so is the tongue among our members that it defileth the whole body and Seth on fire the cour of Nature and it is set on fire of Hell James didn't pull any punches he said for every kind of Beast and birds and serpents and things in the sea is tamed and have been tamed to mankind but the tongue can no man tame it is an unruly evil full of dead deadly poison he said therewith we bless we God even the father and therewith curse We Men which are made after the similitude of God out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing my brethren these things ought not so to be do the fountain send forth at the same place Sweet Water and bitter can the Fig Tree my brethren bear Olive berries either ofine figs so can no Fountain both yield salt water and fresh he said who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you I you know I I wouldn't ask you to raise your hands but some of us you know we think well I've accumulated some wisdom well he said this is how you can tell let him show out of a good conversation that's a life a manner of Life his works with meekness of wisdom but if you have bitter envying and strife in your hearts no matter how old you are Glory not and lie not against the truth he said this wisdom descendeth not from above but is Earthly sensual devilish for where envying and strife is there is confus confusion and every evil work but the wisdom that is from above is first pure so what's he saying don't don't lie to yourselves if you got that in your heart you can't blame nobody else for that it's just immaturity and you need to get a hold of that tongue right Bridle it let and let let God begin to work in your life and begin to sow peace and mercy he said he said the wisdom that is from above is first pure then Peaceable gentle and easy to be entreated full of mercy and good fruits without partiality without hypocrisy and the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace oh my so if you want to reap peace you've got to sow peace brother brandom says this about the apostles I know it's quiet tonight but I I'm preaching it myself too church every one of us got room to grow he said I can imagine them Apostles never acted like us he said they went around probably meant a few words I love that he put this next part in there he said till they got in the Pulpit glad he gave us an out there brother sha Stewart said they were men a few words till they got in the Pulpit brother brandom in one place he said they preached a very long time and another quote just like this he said they preached a long time but they were meant a few words outside the pulpit don't take that too much to heart he said he said they walked in and they done what they were supposed to do and walked out he said they had power they had virtue say God help us today they had no arguments with men they knew where they stood that's all they knew who they believed they kept on walking in the spirit amen oh God help us to be like that and so what's he saying he's not saying Don't Preach long he's saying he's saying preachers should be meant a few words and that they don't fuss and argue and tattle on one another right and so we shouldn't be calling random people about stuff that has nothing to do with them right have you heard be surprised how often that happens somebody call somebody they haven't talked to in 10 years just to tell a tale for no other reason and neither one of them involved in the situation what was it Joseph was was young he talked too much at the wrong times but it's worse to see an old man do that or an old woman well look his brothers needed correcting but perhaps he didn't have the wisdom yet to correct them like Jesus would now brother R says if you can't different with a man and love him the same time then shut up was that too it was rather abrupt wasn't it I thought about just putting that part of the quote up there said if you can't different with a man love him the same time then shut up if you you can't tell him like a daddy correcting his child with a willing arm to put it around his neck and hug him afterwards you better leave it alone he said you haven't you haven't went far enough yourself to know what you're talking about he said right I can differ with a man certainly still he is my brother I'll hold his hand I can't let him get by with that if I do if I didn't tell him I wouldn't be the correct brother to him he said that's correct but I can tell him and tell him I love him and prove it to him I love him so it goes back to our motive what is our motive in that is it to help or is to get somebody in trouble and Joseph had to learn The Obedience of that by the things that he suffered you say well H how would we come to this maturity to be able to be like that well first you need the ministry of Ephesians 4:11 preaching the message of the hour because the Bible says he gave some Apostles some prophets some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting that's the maturing of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ secondly we need the inside teacher the Holy Spirit the inside teacher John 14:26 says but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I was said un you he said in John 16:13 how be it when he the spirit of Truth has come he will guide you into all truth so when you get the Holy Spirit you don't have all truth yet he will guide you into all truth right for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come so brother brandham taught us that the evidence that we have the Holy Ghost is that inside teacher leading us to say Amen to every word of the hour right bringing us to maturity he said he told us the evidence or what would happen he said after being baptized with the Holy Ghost that we would have the teacher come and teach all truth he said but that teacher was an inside teacher not an outside teacher if the spirit wasn't inside you wouldn't hear the truth and receive it by Revelation if you heard it every moment of the day he said that was the sign of the indwelling spirit in the days of Paul those who were filled with the Holy Ghost heard the word received it and lived by it those who did not have the spirit heard it only as carnal men put a wrong interpretation on it and went into sin how many times have we seen that a person doesn't have the Holy Ghost but they got a good mind and so they preach they got gifts maybe to preach and they sing or whatever else but they don't have the Holy Ghost to bring them into maturity right so many times they fuss and they fight and they pick at people why because they just they haven't come to maturity themselves and then one time you find they fell fallen into sin what happened to them oh Church they didn't have the guide the inside teacher I said you need it today I need it today amen he said that was the of the indwelling spirit in the days of Paul those who were filled with the Holy Ghost heard the word received it and lived by it those do not do not have the spirit heard it only as carnal men put a wrong interpretation on it and went into sin in every age and every age is the age of the Holy Ghost for the True Believer I like that every age is the age of the Holy Ghost I say in every age the evidence was the same those who had the spirit the teacher heard the word and that spirit in them took the word and taught it revealed it to them and they were of the group that heard the messenger in his message and took it and lived it I want to be one of those not just to say I'm in the message but to have that inside teacher come inside of me and actually caus me to live it well that's like you know if you had an old you ever seen an old three-legged stool we milked cows on a three-legged stool and the Third Leg of that is suffering suffering you need the ministry you need the holy spirit and you need suffering that's hard isn't it suffering is experiencing pain that's what the word means experiencing pain feeling it 1 Peter 5 and8 says be sober be vigilant because your adversary the Devil is a roaring Lon walketh about seeking whom he may devour resist steadfast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world but the God of all Grace who has called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus after that you have suffered a while make you perfect establish strengthen settle you so like a tree that gets blown by the winds but if it doesn't blow it down someone said what doesn't kill you makes you stronger that's literally true of a tree that if it doesn't blow it down it actually loosens the dirt around the root so it can grow deeper and it keeps growing deeper and keeps growing and deeper and though the storms would come and the wind would come and listen you're a brid tree you've been called to stand every one of us have been called to stand but we can't go in on a flowery bed of East there will be some suffering in life some we'll feel some pain and it's necessary to have maturity and maturity is not an age although it comes with age but it comes by these things comes by the word it comes by the spirit it comes by suffering Joseph had to suffer before he could Reign look at Joseph and Jesus and the type there the parallel his brothers hated him Jesus Brethren hated him he was sold for money 20 pieces of silver in Joseph's case 30 pieces of silver in Jesus case buried in a ditch oh my suffered in the dungeon in fact when Joseph went to prison there was one Thief lost and one Thief saved just like Jesus on the cross and then he was seated at the right hand of pharaoh brother Brown said then he become at the right hand of pharaoh the king that he dreamed that had the vision that he would set at the king's feet and all authority in Egypt was given to him his vision had to come to pass now if it's a god-given vision a dream a a goal a a something that you've got in your mind that that that's of God and I think we can all maybe we can dumb it down a little bit because we're not all going to be Joseph but we all do have some Vision in our lives we ought to right because if you don't have a vision you don't have a purpose so you have a vision in your life and what is the vision well we may have a vision of what our life's going to be but ultimately our lives are ruled by the word right so the vision ought to be the word it ought to be what the word says what the word says about me that's my vision so if you're a young person here tonight you got a vision how can I be a Godly adult how can I be a Godly wife how can I be a Godly husband how can I be a Godly parent and as a mother you have a vision of raising your children in the fear and admonition of the world and none of them being lost right that's your vision but you might have to go through some suffering on the way right to get to the vision are you hearing me now there might be some hard times on the way Jesus had to go through the cross and the grave before he could ever be lifted up on high right he had to go through that it was necessary for him to do that and it's necessary for us many times but Caleb to go through a time of suffering right you you you take a young couple that's been through some things and they fought to stay in church and they fought because everything conspired against them and seemed like to keep out of the house of God and they had to fight to be in church some of yall know what I'm talking about and maybe maybe you had to fight financially maybe it wasn't financially maybe it was with health or or with your children or something something that had you had to just you just had to make a commitment one day say I'm going to go to church no matter what happens I I'm going to live for God no matter what happens and you take that young couple that went through some things and and maybe they struggled the first few years of married some of you are in that phase right now you know what I'm talking about when you get to the end of the month and you get to to the end of the year and you wonder where that that tax check better come along or I've been there church we're not going to have enough money to make in meet huh and you feel terrible about that but it's just where you're at and many times as a young couple when you struggle like that and you go through those things and and yet I know some of you have moved on a little bit further and you got a few years on you and maybe you're still sitting there thinking when is this ever going to end and some of you Elders know that you kind of go right back into that time when you get older and you get on a fixed income right and then you're wondering where the how the bills are going to be paid again right oh Church don't you realize it's necessary don't you realize a couple that's gone through that can handle anything that the devil tries to throw at them because they trusted him for groceries they trusted him for rent they trust the whole church they trusted him for for their kids they trusted him for their health they trusted him they went to church they did what was right they they paid God first even when they didn't seem like they had it but they did the right thing what was it it was something about my hats off to your church why you've been through some things and that's what brings maturity in your life and you've had to struggle but that struggle produce something to produce something the gold of God that you can't get any other way are you with me now brother brandom said let me move down here where I was I don't want to reread these oh my we we we need that suffering to be able to see the vision come to pass in our life brother brandom said he his vision had to come to pass he might have studied it many times while he was in that prison down there his whiskers growing out and so forth but he studied it you need to study your vision you need to look there and say God said he would supply all my needs right study the vision right I know God will provide for me I know God will help me when to go and get stuff God said he would keep me and he would save me and he would save my household you study on that he studied on that in the prison he thought about his vision he thought about his dreams he thought about what he'd seen he said said God I know that was real I know you give me something and yet I hear I'm going through a prison I'm going through a hard time I'm going through a time when it seems like everything's turned against me but I know I'm going to hold on I'm going to do the very best I can in the situation I'm in because I know one day and I don't know which day that'll be but one day I'm going to come out of this prison you've called me to be something higher youve called me to do something more and every one of us can say Amen to that tonight we are called To Rule and reign with him look he said someday his vision had to come to pass habac 2:3 says for the vision is yet for an appointed time but at the end it shall speak and not lie though it t wait for it because it will surely come it will not tar there is oh the breakthroughs coming listen to me don't get discouraged by what's going on right now because you're coming up out of the prison there's going to be a time when your when your wagon comes in when your ship comes in and that's not pie in the sky you say when will that happen we're going to get a new body one of these days we're going to be translated out of here one of these days there coming a time we're going to leave this whole vile world I'm not looking for riches here I'm not looking for ease here I'm not looking for a easy time of it I'm looking to get out of here amen and so the Bible says until the time until the time that his word came the word of the Lord tried him yes I want you to think about that tonight and every every one of us I want to think about that what is your word what is your purpose how do you wish things would change how do you wish things were different what addictions or problems or struggles you have in your life you need you need to you need to think about it don't just sit there with it that bitterness that sits in your heart there's there's a way out of that amen yes huh don't don't don't be complacent with don't make a deal with the devil and be complacent with it and say well I'll just build a wall between me and the people and that'll keep me from being H again it don't work build a wall between me and my wife and that'll keep me from being hurt again it won't work you end up divorced what do you got to do work in the prison work in Piper's house do such a good job that they that that you they see you and and and and you see that this isn't the situation you wanted but you're not going to lay down because you know what your future is you know what's up ahead of you you know you weren't called to be all of your life like that and so you crawl out of it I'm determined to leave this state I'm not going to remain in the moly grubs I'm not going to stay in my like job here there was a time he was on the as sheep but there had to come a time he crawled out of it determined to meet God and talk to him about it I'm determined to let him to let him come in and change my life I'm determined to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost whatever it is that you have need of I'm determined that I'm going to crawl out of this whole see until his word came he suffered under the expectations that he had he could not promote himself to the throne he neither cannot we we promote ourselves to God's Throne he was thrown in a pit sold into slavery lighted on by an evil woman cast into prison sat there with his whiskers growing out 30 years old it don't seem old unless you spent half of it in prison it been only 17 when it All Began so for what is that my Math's not very good 13 years 13 years he spent part of it in pot house he probably thought well I'm getting ahead now woohoo I got the job I wanted everything's going good and but for doing the right thing he ended up in prison he ran from Temptation he end up in prison listen if he had given in he' have been in a worst prison but he but he he ran from Temptation so he ended up in prison and and then he he's in prison spending the best years of his life his 20s in prison think about it for a minute you might have sat there and said boy I wish I'd have kept my mouth shut to my brothers wish I'd have treated them differently we don't know what all went through his mind but he didn't give up see God was teaching him something God was going to use him for Redemption so he had to learn to obey I believe some of you God's going to use you for Redemption to your family he's going to use you to break family curses he's going to use you to change the situation he's going to use you to change Hardy's reputation are you with me now he's going to use you to change an area use you to God terries I believe he's going to use this church but you got to go through the hard times to get to where you can break through there's got to be some suffering so you get to the place where you can raise up and be at the right hand of pharaoh again oh my but it was his attitude and willingness to work in the jobs he didn't want I'm just making it carnal so we can understand it but it's the jobs he didn't want was his attitude and willingness to work in those jobs that got him the job he wanted in Genesis 45:4 Joseph said to his Brethren come near to me I pray you they came near but this is all the way at the end and we're going to get to many things I don't have time tonight to go into all the things that happened but Joseph said unto his Brethren come near to me I pray you they came near he said I am Joseph your brother whom you sold into Egypt and you talk about people shaking in their boots you imagine them walking into that place think about it here these poor Shepherds they thought they got rid of that problem 13 years ago they thought they killed him and he comes walking in they come walking into Egypt and here's this great towers and palaces and Joseph everything he says the king does he's the prime minister of Egypt he's the power behind the throne he's got the king seal he can put people to death he's got that ability you don't have to ask nobody so he he's got the full Trust of pharaoh and they walk in there and they're looking around and they're in all the place and they walk in there and they they get an audience with Joseph he puts everybody out of the room brother BR said he put out his Gentile wife because it's a type of what's going to happen one day when when we come back to the Earth you remember and he goes down to the Jews and in the day of atonement he said look at these SS they said where do you get the wounds he said in the in the house of my friends but they come into that into that great room the Judgment seat and here comes a man onto the throne with his great bodyguard standing there with all their armor and here he is standing there and and such a such an amazing presence about him and they're just kind of bowed down like this said I wonder what's going to happen to us we're desperate we need something to eat we just need some help looking for pity looking for a handout Joseph runs everybody out of the room and he says don't you know who I am I'm your brother you forgive me if I'm wrong about this but I don't believe Joseph could have done that at 17 I don't think he would have had the ability to do that when he was 17 but at 30 oh my or or however much older he was by the time they come down there in his 30s suddenly had I'm not saying there's anything special about that age other than that was about the age Jesus was but it's something about growing up about growing up and so here here he's grown to a point that he says this now therefore he sees their faces I'm they're white as a sheet and they're trembling and they're saying well boys this is it our sin has finally found us out yes all these years the carefully laid lies and the Web of Lies We Told to our father is fixing it's fixing to all be found out he says therefore be not grieved nor angry with yourselves that you sold me hither for God did send me before you to preserve life he might not could have said that at 17 but when he stood there before him after Piper's house after the prison after the pit he can stand there and say I forgive you God did this to me to save your life oh Church you say but brother Ben when when when will I see that maturity in my life when you can say father forgive them and not just say it but actually be in a position where your attitude towards them can bring redemption in their homes redemption in their lives that's why James said my brethren counted all joy when you fall into diverse Temptations knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience but let patience have her perfect work her mature work he said give patience time is it's a great play on words patience takes patience let patience have her perfect work that you may be perfect mature and entire wanting nothing brother brand says unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him you have to suffer to Reign the reason for this is that character simply is never made without suffering character is a victory not a gift a man without character can't Reign because power apart from character is satanic but Power with character is fit to rule and since he wants us to share even his throne by the same oh my on the same basis that he overcome and has set down his father Stone and we have to overcome to sit with him and the little temporary suffering we go through now is not worthy to be compared to the tremendous Glory that will be revealed in us when he comes all what Treasures are laid up for those who are who are willing to enter into his kingdom through much tribulation he thinking not strange concerning the fiery trials that are to try you this is what Peter said is it is it strange that God wants us to develop a Christlike character that comes through suffering no sir he said and we all have trials musicians can go ahead and make their way he said we are all tried and chastened as Sons not one but goes through that I want you to listen to this and I know you've heard it before but I want you to think about it the church that is not suffering and is not being tried hasn't got it it isn't of God so I'm goingon to go somewhere where there's no trials you go to a church that doesn't have God I'll say trials are common to every Church suffering is common to every human being but the suffering of The Sinner produces more sin right more hatred more more ungodliness some of you before you come to the Lord you had to go through some things before you finally reach the time when you can say okay I Surrender Lord I'm done I'm done fighting I'm done worrying about the things why can't I do this why can't I do that why can't I live like this I'm done Lord I'm ready to give it up and just be what you want me to be if you want me in an uncomfortable situation for now I'll take that cuz sometimes that's what it takes to get a character in our lives I know that's hard church but I don't mean to be hard I I preach it because I've lived it and I live it now if you think pastoring is a Rosie bed of ease I'd like to i' I'd like to hand it to you for a while if I could it's not easy but I'm not here to to be in the Molly grubs I'm saying the situation that I'm in God has called me to do there's a vision there's a dream there's somewhere I'm going and I'm going to I'm going to fight I'm going to plow I'm going to work until I get out of this prison what about you tonight whatever I'm in you say well my body's getting old I'm getting crippled but in that situation say Lord I know this is not the end this is not what you had for me you listen you could have the best job living in a penthouse on Fifth Avenue and have all the money in the world and you still may not be happy but you have to have a vision there got to be something this is what I want my life to be oh Church there's got to be something we're reaching for we can't just lay back and say well I'm going to be a good lay to see in person no there's got to be something inside of you Lord I want that character whatever it takes Lord I'm willing to go through it I'm willing to take it I'm willing to have you begin to work in my life I wonder if we could say that tonight with every head bowed and every eye [Music] closed maybe You' just like to say I'd like to pray with you maybe you just like to say brother B that that spoke to me I I realize I need character in my life I need to grow I think all of us could say that I need to grow I I been through some things I'm not coveting trials I'm not doing that that would be stupid but what am I doing I'm I'm just saying Lord what you bring my way I'm willing to take I'm going to work as hard as I can in the middle of that trial to see a vision come to pass for my life it may not be what I wanted but it'll be what you had for me you just lift your hand to him and tell him Lord that's what I want that's what I want tonight church God bless those hands Heavenly Father our Jesus we we surrender tonight to your will we surrender Lord even Lord you even when you were here on the earth in a body of Flesh you had to experience pain and suffering Lord and by that you learned obedience Lord that's difficult for us to understand but we know Lord that it's true so Lord we we surrender our will to you we surrender our ways oh God we surrender every thought every work Lord our jobs our homes our Humanity Lord we surrender our marriages God we want you to work in US Lord we want you to we want you to take over lord when we tired of doing it on our own help us Lord to do what you've called us to do it may be temporary suffering but Lord we can't avoid that but we can make it we will make it because we're your children you don't give up on your children you say Come on get up go again oh God I'm so thankful for that brother brandom taught us that if we were you don't deal with us as little as as adults but when we first begin but as little children learning to walk you help us Lord and every time we all you're there to pick us up Lord but we want to reach a place where we have maturity in our life where we can pick somebody else up you can use our hands and use our feet oh God I pray you grant it we thank you for these people I pray you'd bless each and every one of them Lord we thank you for them we believe that they're the cream of the crop I pray God that you'd bless them bless their houses bless their finances bless them Lord in health I pray you do it tonight we believe that you will bless each one that raised their hand Lord may they go
