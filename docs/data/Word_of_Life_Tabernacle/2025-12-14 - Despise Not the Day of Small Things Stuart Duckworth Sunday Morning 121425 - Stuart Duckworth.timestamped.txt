[11:55] [Music]
[11:56] Amen. Are you happy to be in the house
[11:58] of the Lord this morning? Amen. Just
[12:00] welcome everybody out. Amen. Brother
[12:02] Stewart's going to be ministering for
[12:03] us. So just be praying for him this
[12:05] morning. Amen. Also remember brother Ben
[12:08] and brother Joel. They're out travel
[12:10] ministering this morning. Just be
[12:11] praying for them. Amen. Let's sing that
[12:14] song if we could. Key of F. One day,
[12:18] Sister Anna, would you and your
[12:19] daughters be able to sing? There was a
[12:20] request put in for you. Not today. Okay.
[12:24] Amen.
[12:26] Some days drag,
[12:29] some days fly,
[12:32] some days I think of the day I'll die.
[12:39] Some days feel me.
[12:42] Someday
[12:46] one day Jesus
[12:49] will call my name.
[12:54] Jesus
[12:56] call my name.
[13:01] I hope I don't stay the same.
[13:05] I want to get so close to him. Oh, they
[13:10] change all the day.
[13:15] Oh, call my name.
[13:19] Most days I pray,
[13:22] but some days I hurt
[13:27] days. I put myself first.
[13:32] It's not what I do.
[13:36] cross that way.
[13:39] One day Jesus
[13:46] one day Jesus
[13:49] call my name.
[13:55] I hope I don't stay the same.
[13:59] I want to get so close to him.
[14:04] Change your day. My Jesus.
[14:10] Why don't you turn around and preach
[14:11] your name?
[14:14] [Music]
[14:25] [Music]
[14:33] Day of Jesus.
[14:37] Oh, second verse. Oh, most days I pray.
[14:43] But some days I hurt.
[14:46] A sad number of days I had put myself
[14:52] first.
[14:54] It's not what I do.
[14:57] The cross made that way. Knowing one day
[15:02] Jesus
[15:04] will call my name. Oh, one day Jesus
[15:11] will call my name.
[15:14] As days go by, I hope I don't stay the
[15:19] same.
[15:20] I want to get so close to him. There's
[15:25] only change on the day that Jesus
[15:32] calls my name.
[15:36] [Music]
[15:38] I'm going to keep pressing on,
[15:43] holding, holding on.
[15:46] pressing on.
[15:49] [Music]
[15:52] I'm going to keep pressing on to the
[15:57] higher call
[16:01] that course once again.
[16:04] Oh, we are pressing on
[16:10] hold and hold and
[16:14] pressing on.
[16:19] I'm going to keep pressing on to the
[16:25] higher calling of my Lord.
[16:33] Well, Satan tried to stop me.
[16:38] Turn me aside.
[16:41] Said there's no need for you to go on.
[16:45] No need to try.
[16:49] Even if there was a rapture, you never
[16:53] make it in.
[16:55] I just know Satan. I'm going to prove
[16:59] you're a liar again. And I'm going to
[17:02] keep pressing
[17:05] on and on and on. The ride is pressing
[17:10] on.
[17:14] I'm going to keep pressing on to the
[17:20] higher call.
[17:23] Can we lift our hands? We sing that
[17:24] chorus again.
[17:28] We are pressing on
[17:33] hold and
[17:36] pressing on.
[17:42] I'm going to keep pressing on to the
[17:47] higher calling of the Lord. Can we give
[17:52] the Lord a hand clap of praise?
[17:56] Amen. Amen. Same key. Thanks. I just
[18:00] want to say thanks.
[18:03] Thanks.

[18:08] for all
[18:10] you've
[18:12] done.
[18:16] I am so blessed.
[18:19] My soul has found rest. Oh Lord,

[18:56] morning.
[18:58] I just want to sing.
[19:03] I
[19:08] [Music]
[19:14] am so blessed.

[19:27] Amen. Give the Lord another hand clap of
[19:28] praise.
[19:31] Amen. Just before we have the ushers
[19:32] come and let's sing that song. I claim
[19:35] the blood key of G.
[19:40] Blood
[19:42] Jesus shed
[19:44] on Calary.
[19:48] [Music]
[19:51] Those preious
[19:54] blood saints,
[19:57] they were made there just for me.
[20:05] Oh, for all my sins,
[20:11] my sickness,
[20:14] and my pain.
[20:21] When I need healing,
[20:26] I just pray
[20:29] those precious blood stains. First
[20:33] verse.
[20:36] I have a source
[20:42] of strength
[20:44] when I am weak.
[20:51] That takes me through.
[20:56] When life
[20:58] is crazy,
[21:05] I have a source
[21:11] of power
[21:13] from
[21:15] above.
[21:18] [Music]
[21:20] I'm covered
[21:23] over
[21:26] by a shield
[21:30] of love with all our hearts.
[21:34] Oh, I claim
[21:37] the blood.
[21:40] Jesus shed
[21:42] on Calary.
[21:48] [Music]
[21:49] Those preious
[21:52] blood stains,
[21:55] they were made there just for me.
[22:02] [Music]
[22:04] Oh, for all
[22:06] my sins,
[22:10] my sickness,
[22:12] and my pain.
[22:19] When I need healing,
[22:24] I just pray. Anybody sing that chorus
[22:28] once again as the ushers come? Oh,
[22:33] I claim the blood
[22:39] Jesus shed
[22:41] on Calary.
[22:48] Those preious
[22:51] blood stains,

[23:03] Oh, for all
[23:05] my sins,
[23:09] my sickness,

[23:23] I just claim
[23:26] those preious blood stains.
[23:32] Amen. We don't have any written requests
[23:35] this morning. Just remember those that
[23:37] have been made mention last week and
[23:39] throughout the week. Amen. I know many
[23:41] are traveling today, so just be praying
[23:43] for them. Amen. And if you have an
[23:45] unspoken request, you just want to make
[23:47] it known. I love lifting your hand.
[23:49] We'll ask our brother Gabe, take these
[23:50] needs for us.
[23:53] Lord, we thank you. We love you for
[23:55] allowing us to gather together today,
[23:57] God. And we thank you for the blessings

[30:02] feel sorry for Sister Anna. If you're
[30:04] wondering why all the songs are in GNF,
[30:06] it's because I couldn't find the other
[30:08] sheet for what the keys the songs were
[30:10] in. So Amen. So we're going to sing in
[30:12] GNF all morning. Amen. Amen. Some of
[30:17] y'all look happy. And some of you don't.
[30:19] But that's okay. We're here anyways. You
[30:20] made it out. You're this far in. You're
[30:23] committed. Might as well see it through.
[30:24] Amen. Amen. Let's sing that song. He's
[30:27] alive and well. And we're just going to
[30:29] sing the chorus to that. It'll be in the

[30:38] and well.
[30:40] He's living in me
[30:43] to tell
[30:45] the world
[30:49] that he is the same.
[30:56] Oh, he's the same
[30:59] yesterday,
[31:00] [Music]

[35:23] and stand as we change the order of this
[35:26] service.

[39:24] Amen. Just so happy to be here and happy
[39:26] to see each and every one of you. Amen.
[39:28] And if we could just turn in the
[39:30] scriptures to 2 Samuel 7.
[39:36] Amen.
[39:41] 2 Samuel 7 and 8.
[39:49] Just kind of want to speak on a thought
[39:51] of despise not the day of small things.
[39:54] 2 Samuel 7 and 8
[40:00] says here now therefore so shall thou
[40:04] say unto my servant David thus sayeth
[40:06] the Lord of hosts I took thee from the
[40:10] sheepcoat and from following the sheep
[40:12] to be ruler over my people over Israel
[40:17] and I was with thee whethersoever thou
[40:19] west and have cut off all thine enemies
[40:22] out of thy sight and have made thee a
[40:25] great name like unto the name of the
[40:28] great men that are in the earth. Amen.
[40:31] You can be seated this morning.
[40:35] Just got one service here today. And so
[40:38] let's just pour all all of our attention
[40:40] and all of our effort this morning. And
[40:43] y'all help me preach and we'll I promise
[40:45] you we'll get out of here a little
[40:46] early. You can enjoy your your afternoon
[40:49] and your day.
[40:51] Amen. Here David
[40:54] God speaking to David here. But David
[40:57] had in his heart a desire that he wanted
[40:59] to build a temple for God.
[41:02] And God had done so much for David. He
[41:05] had brought him through so much. And
[41:08] David's sitting there and he's resting
[41:10] from his enemies. He's at peace from
[41:12] with his enemies. And he said, "How can
[41:14] I sit in a house of cedar and the ark of
[41:18] my God behind the curtains?" But we know
[41:22] that God wouldn't let David build the
[41:24] temple because of so much bloodshed and
[41:28] so much war. God would not allow David
[41:30] to build this temple. But he made a
[41:33] promise to David that his seed after him
[41:37] would build it. And the Lord said in his
[41:41] kingdom will I establish. So you know
[41:44] David David was had fulfilled his
[41:47] purpose. He was coming down to the end
[41:49] there. And you know, he had a desire to
[41:52] do this, but it wasn't for David to do
[41:54] that. It wasn't time yet for the temple
[41:57] to be built. But but God would through
[41:59] David's seed, through that faith,
[42:02] through that lineage would establish a
[42:04] kingdom. Amen.
[42:07] But we look that, you know, we're just
[42:09] kind of, this is just a simple thought
[42:11] here today. I'm telling you what, it's
[42:12] really simple. And so that they, you
[42:15] know, it's not going to get real deep
[42:16] here today, but
[42:19] but we look uh you know, he said, "I
[42:21] brought you from the sheep coat. I
[42:23] brought you you you were nothing,
[42:26] &gt;&gt; but I brought you and I I brought you to
[42:28] where you are now, and I brought you to
[42:29] a place where uh uh uh your your name
[42:32] was feared. Your name was great. You
[42:34] were absolutely nothing." But and that
[42:37] but that's what God does. God can take
[42:39] something from nothing and bring it. And
[42:42] we're still nothing. But God can use us.
[42:44] Amen.
[42:46] &gt;&gt; But where did where did God bring David
[42:48] from? He said, "I took thee from the
[42:50] sheep coat. I He brought him from
[42:52] hurting his father's sheep."
[42:54] &gt;&gt; From following sheep around all day.
[42:58] &gt;&gt; Following the sheep around, guarding the
[43:00] sheep. A amen. To be ruler from what?
[43:03] From guarding sheep. To be ruler over
[43:05] God's children, over God's kingdom.
[43:09] But see, David, listen to this. See,
[43:11] David was faithful over the little
[43:14] things.
[43:16] &gt;&gt; As Christians, it's not the big things
[43:18] that we do. It's the little things that
[43:21] we leave undone. Brother Ram said,
[43:23] &gt;&gt; but Jesus said, "Blessed are those that
[43:26] do the commandments of God
[43:28] &gt;&gt; that they might have a right to enter
[43:31] in." David was concerned uh there on on
[43:34] on down there there in the pasture. Uh
[43:37] God had great things laid out for David,
[43:40] no doubt. But David didn't know that.
[43:41] But but David was faithful over the
[43:44] little things. And that that's what I
[43:45] want to do. I just want to be faithful
[43:47] over what God's given me, over the
[43:50] family that God's given me, over the
[43:52] word that God has given us in this hour.
[43:54] Amen. I what what understanding you have
[43:56] this morning, wherever you're at in your
[43:58] experience, just be faithful in that.
[44:01] And God will bring you to greater
[44:03] things. He will bring you to what your
[44:05] purpose actually is. Amen.
[44:15] And as God God was with David, even in
[44:19] the little things that he looked over,
[44:21] God was with David.
[44:23] &gt;&gt; God was with David there as he as he
[44:25] watched over the sheep as he followed
[44:27] these these sheep around with a stick,
[44:30] with this a little staff, and uh uh just
[44:33] there watching over his father's
[44:35] possessions. They weren't even David's
[44:37] sheep. But he looked over them as though
[44:41] they were his own. He was faithful. He
[44:43] had a faithful heart to serve the
[44:46] father's will.
[44:49] When a bear rose up to destroy the sheep
[44:53] from David's faithfulness and there
[44:55] there in his position, the spirit of the
[44:57] Lord came upon a a amen came upon him
[45:01] and he slew that bear that would come
[45:04] against the sheep. when a roaring lion
[45:07] would come in and take and try to take
[45:09] and devour one of the father's sheep,
[45:11] David was there and there the spirit of
[45:14] the Lord, not David, but the spirit of
[45:16] the Lord came upon him and he slew that
[45:20] lion. And that's what makes the
[45:22] difference here today. And as simple as
[45:24] it is, Amen. We need the spirit of God
[45:27] among us. It It's not us. We can't do
[45:29] anything here this morning. I can't
[45:31] preach a lick. I can't do nothing. You
[45:34] can't receive nothing. But if the spirit
[45:36] of the Lord will come in the service
[45:38] today, amen, we might receive a little
[45:40] bit of encouragement. If I could just
[45:42] say something here today by the help of
[45:44] God that will encourage you along the
[45:45] way. Amen. Amen. And from that, Amen.
[45:48] You could you could take it with you.
[45:50] Amen. And the spirit of the Lord could
[45:52] take the word and direct it exactly
[45:54] where it needs to go. Amen. I don't just
[45:56] want the words of a man here today. I
[45:58] want the living bread of God, amen, that
[46:00] we can feed upon. I don't just want the
[46:03] inspiration of just studying and and
[46:05] intellectual thought. Amen. But we want
[46:07] to feed. Amen. We want to feast on the
[46:10] word of God here today that we can be
[46:12] strengthened, that we can be encouraged.
[46:16] &gt;&gt; Is that what you want here this morning?
[46:19] It's the spirit of the Lord that would
[46:20] come here today and direct the word of
[46:23] of the Lord to the hearts of the people.
[46:25] It would direct a minister to say
[46:27] exactly what God has intended for
[46:29] someone here today.
[46:31] And that's what we need. David needed
[46:34] the spirit of the Lord. He needed the
[46:36] spirit of the Lord. When the bear came,
[46:38] he couldn't defeat that bear. It took
[46:40] God to defeat that bear. He couldn't
[46:42] defeat that lion. It took God to defeat
[46:44] that lion. I can't defeat cancer this
[46:47] morning. It takes God to defeat cancer.
[46:49] And I say this morning, he's already
[46:51] defeated cancer. He's already a
[46:54] conqueror. God already made a way to
[46:56] defeat that bear. Amen. by the spirit of
[46:58] God that will come upon David. Amen. And
[47:02] if you'll believe this morning that
[47:03] you've got a purpose, if you'll be
[47:05] faithful as David was, amen, when your
[47:07] enemies come in like a flood, the spirit
[47:10] of God will raise up a standard against
[47:12] it. Amen. No weapon formed against you
[47:14] this morning shall prosper. Amen. Amen.
[47:17] This is a heritage of the children of
[47:19] God. Amen. It is your right. It is your
[47:22] heritage. It is your inheritance to
[47:24] overcome every demon that would come
[47:26] against you this this day and this hour.
[47:29] &gt;&gt; It is your heritage this morning. Amen.
[47:32] That the spirit of God, Amen, would come
[47:34] through you. Amen. Amen. And defeat your
[47:36] enemy.
[47:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:41] The spirit of the Lord was the
[47:43] difference. And it's the spirit of the
[47:45] Lord upon a faithful heart there. David
[47:47] who trusted in Jehovah God to deliver
[47:51] him from his enemies.
[47:54] See, whatever David did, he did it from
[47:57] his heart.
[47:59] David loved God with all of his heart.
[48:03] &gt;&gt; For God said, David, thou art a man
[48:06] after mine own heart.
[48:09] &gt;&gt; It didn't matter how small he was. It
[48:11] didn't matter that he was the smallest
[48:14] of his brothers. David's desire was to
[48:16] be faithful in all that he did and to
[48:18] love God with all that he was. Is that
[48:22] your desire this morning? Have you got
[48:24] just a just a little bit of desire to
[48:26] serve God? You ought to be thankful in
[48:28] this hour. There's people that don't
[48:30] care one lick about serving God. They
[48:32] don't care one lick about about the
[48:34] Bible and the things that are in the
[48:35] Bible. Amen. But there's a people I
[48:37] believe here today that that's got a
[48:39] desire in their heart that there's
[48:41] something that God placed in their a
[48:43] deposit. Amen. That wasn't you that done
[48:45] that. That was God that done that.
[48:47] That's God that placed that hunger in
[48:49] there to serve him and and to believe
[48:51] his word and to live his word.
[48:53] &gt;&gt; God done that.
[48:55] &gt;&gt; God placed that within his people. Amen.
[48:58] That we might serve him from our hearts.
[49:04] When King Saul was rejected by God, the
[49:07] Lord told Samuel to go to the house of
[49:10] Jesse, for I have provided me a king
[49:14] among his sons. And there Jesse went
[49:17] down or there Samuel went down to
[49:19] Jesse's house and as the sons of Jesse
[49:22] passed by, the prophet said, "Surely
[49:25] surely this is him." But 1st Samuel
[49:28] 16:7, let's just turn there as we go
[49:32] along here. 1st Samuel 16:7.
[49:35] But the Lord said unto Samuel, "Look not
[49:37] on his countenance or on the height of
[49:40] his stature, because I have refused him.
[49:42] For the Lord seeth not as man seeth, for
[49:45] man lookketh on the outward appearance,
[49:48] but the Lord lookth upon the heart."
[49:51] See, the election of God was upon the
[49:54] youngest. It was upon the least. Not
[49:57] that those men weren't capable, but here
[49:59] among the on on the youngest, on the
[50:01] least. And even the prophet thought it
[50:04] would be somebody else. But the Lord
[50:06] told Samuel, "This is him." And in the
[50:10] midst of his brethren, the prophet
[50:12] poured on him the horn of oil and
[50:14] anointed him, and the spirit of the Lord
[50:16] was upon him from that day forward.
[50:19] &gt;&gt; See, what the world rejects and looks
[50:21] down on is what God anoints. what the
[50:25] what the world disregards, what the
[50:27] world puts to the side. Amen. That's
[50:29] what God is looking to anoint. And I say
[50:32] today here this morning, God is looking
[50:34] to anoint someone with the spirit of
[50:36] God. God is looking to anoint someone
[50:38] here today that'll be willing with an
[50:40] open heart. Amen. That you they that can
[50:42] see that you've got a purpose. Amen.
[50:44] That you can see by the word of God that
[50:47] I was called. Amen. Amen. That that that
[50:49] you can see this morning. Amen. Your
[50:51] part in the word. Amen. The Holy Spirit
[50:54] is here to anoint today. He's here to
[50:56] energize your life and your belief and
[50:59] your faith and what you hold to in this
[51:01] hour. Amen. God is here on the scene.
[51:03] Amen. To back up his word. Amen. Amen.
[51:06] And by the spirit of the Lord, Amen.
[51:08] He'll come upon sons and daughters of
[51:10] God that will believe his word. He will
[51:13] come and anoint your life and give you
[51:15] strength and give you power
[51:18] &gt;&gt; over your enemy
[51:20] &gt;&gt; and to do what God has called you to do.
[51:23] I know that's simple, but without it
[51:27] we're a bunch of failures.
[51:29] &gt;&gt; Without it, without it, we can't do
[51:32] nothing. Right? You can try to give up
[51:35] habits of the world. You can try to do
[51:38] it on your own. Maybe some people are
[51:40] are successful, but it takes God to
[51:42] remove the the desire of sin. It takes
[51:45] God to remove the desire and the want to
[51:47] to do to partake in those things. Amen.
[51:50] We've been called to live different as
[51:52] Christians. We've been called to come
[51:53] out of this world and live different.
[51:55] And the only way you can do it is when
[51:57] God comes in and burns out that old
[52:00] desire by the spirit of God. God is
[52:02] looking to anoint young people, Amen.
[52:05] God is looking to bring Christians,
[52:07] Amen. Amen. that have just, you know,
[52:09] it's just become a common thing. It's
[52:12] just become a common thing. Amen. We're
[52:14] we're just in a habit in an old routine
[52:16] of just everyday life. Amen. God wants
[52:18] to shake us in this hour. God wants to
[52:21] do something in your life this morning.
[52:23] He wants to bring you and draw you
[52:25] closer to him and what you're supposed
[52:27] to be.
[52:29] &gt;&gt; Oh my God, come upon our lives in a
[52:32] greater way. come upon us in a greater
[52:35] way than what than what it was years
[52:37] ago. Oh my. We can talk about years ago
[52:40] and what God did years ago. And that's
[52:42] great and that's fine and that that's
[52:44] dandy and that's a stepping stone. But
[52:46] what about today? What about this
[52:48] morning? Amen. How this this service and
[52:51] we got one service today. Amen. And
[52:53] we're just a we're just a little group
[52:54] here today. We're just a small group
[52:56] insignificant. But what what does God
[52:59] want to do among us here today? What
[53:01] does God want to do in your life? Amen.
[53:03] God wants to answer questions. God wants
[53:05] to bring you through it this morning.
[53:07] God wants to pour into you divine
[53:09] strength this morning. Amen. That you
[53:11] can believe his word, that you can stand
[53:13] on his word, that you can take his word
[53:18] &gt;&gt; because the word is what defeats the
[53:21] enemy.
[53:22] &gt;&gt; I can't do it. You can't do it. But the
[53:25] Holy Spirit will energize just a little
[53:28] portion of the word and it will go and
[53:31] conquer. It will go forth and it will
[53:33] prepare the way before you.
[53:42] &gt;&gt; Look here at Psalm 16 and 8.
[53:46] What was David's?
[53:50] What worked for David? What made it work
[53:53] for David? I've set the Lord always
[53:56] before me. Remember, he's nothing. He's
[53:59] just follow He's just a follower of
[54:00] sheep. He's follow them around. Make
[54:02] sure they're protected.
[54:05] But David said, "I have set the Lord
[54:08] always before me.
[54:10] Because he is at my right hand, I shall
[54:13] not be moved.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; I have set the Lord before me always."
[54:18] What are we setting before ourselves?
[54:21] Oh my.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[54:23] &gt;&gt; What are we setting before ourselves? Is
[54:25] it the Lord?
[54:27] &gt;&gt; I'm preaching to myself now.
[54:29] &gt;&gt; I'm not preaching Nobody but myself.
[54:32] What are we putting before us? What
[54:33] what's consuming our time?
[54:35] &gt;&gt; What's consuming our energy?
[54:38] &gt;&gt; What are we letting control us?
[54:41] &gt;&gt; Are we putting the Lord before us?
[54:44] Because if you put the Lord before you
[54:45] and he's at your right hand, you shall
[54:48] not be moved.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; You shall not be shaken.
[54:51] &gt;&gt; And that's that's the that's the problem
[54:53] with everybody. We're we got too much of
[54:56] everything else in front of us. Let's
[54:58] put the Lord before us. has put his word
[55:00] before us.
[55:02] &gt;&gt; 1963, God's gifts always find their
[55:05] places. I've always loved this quote. He
[55:08] says, "If you're a young woman, dedicate
[55:10] your morals. You're a young man,
[55:12] dedicate your morals, dedicate your
[55:14] mind, dedicate your thinking, dedicate
[55:17] your heart, dedicate your soul, dedicate
[55:19] all you are, and let Christ work through
[55:22] that." What a glorious thing. Cuz here's
[55:25] the thing of it. It's not all. It's not
[55:28] all fairy tales and unicorns, right?
[55:32] &gt;&gt; He said, "You've got the rivers to
[55:34] cross. You've got the bridges to go
[55:36] over.
[55:37] &gt;&gt; You've got the brier patches." Anybody
[55:40] ever been through a brier patch?
[55:42] &gt;&gt; You get cut up a little bit, don't you?
[55:44] &gt;&gt; The whole world, this world's a brier
[55:46] patch.
[55:48] &gt;&gt; Brother Allan, he killed a He killed a
[55:50] big buck out in the middle of a brier
[55:52] patch.
[55:54] Killed a big buck. I hadn't killed one
[55:56] yet.
[55:58] But he had he had to get to that spot.
[56:00] He had to go through a brier patch. It
[56:02] was tough. It wasn't easy.
[56:05] You got brier patches. You got the
[56:07] thicket. You got the woods. You got the
[56:09] dark places. You got the hills. You You
[56:11] got to climb the hills. You got to come
[56:13] up out of the valley. There's going to
[56:15] be more valley than there is hilltop.
[56:18] There's going to be more low
[56:19] experiences. You've got to crawl
[56:21] yourself out of the the the the mountain
[56:24] tops a a small point, but the valley is
[56:27] wide.
[56:28] The valley is wide. The hillside is
[56:30] steep. It's long, right? Amen. We're
[56:33] just on the mountaintop just for a
[56:35] little bit. You better enjoy it this
[56:37] morning if you're on the hilltop cuz
[56:38] there's a long slope coming. There's a
[56:41] long bottom that you've got to get
[56:42] through with some brier patches, with
[56:44] some dark places. You may not make it
[56:46] out during daylight. You may be going in
[56:48] the dark trying to get out of it. Amen.
[56:50] But we've got something. Amen. If we'll
[56:53] center on God if you'll dedicate what
[56:55] you are, God will bring you out of the
[56:57] valley. Amen. To that next mountaintop
[56:59] experience.
[57:01] &gt;&gt; He said you got heels to to climb. What
[57:04] are you doing? Someday you'll have to
[57:06] stand and look back and see where you
[57:08] came from and you're going to be judged
[57:11] by the course you take. He said, "Put
[57:13] your all, put your mind and your
[57:15] thoughts on that that north star, the
[57:17] center of God, and don't move from it."
[57:20] That's what I want to do this morning.
[57:23] &gt;&gt; That's what I want to do this morning. I
[57:25] want to dedicate myself.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; Many temples were dedicated in the
[57:29] Bible. They they took great lengths and
[57:31] and and and to dedicate these temples
[57:33] and so forth. And those temples, and
[57:35] we'll get into in a little bit, every
[57:37] one of those temples is has been ruined,
[57:39] has been destroyed or knocked down. But
[57:41] if you'll dedicate yourself here today,
[57:44] aresh to God. If you'll come to this
[57:45] service and say, "God, shake me from the
[57:47] formalism. Shake the coldness from my
[57:50] soul. Shake the coldness from my heart.
[57:52] If you'll rededicate yourself, Amen. I
[57:55] believe God will set your your heart a
[57:57] flame. He'll set your foot, amen, on the
[57:59] path that it needs to be. If we're
[58:01] rededicated, if we're walking over this
[58:03] way, amen, center back up on God this
[58:05] morning."
[58:08] &gt;&gt; That's what I want to put before us
[58:09] today. Give all you are. Dedicate all
[58:12] you are because this is what God wants.
[58:15] This building, what a fine building this
[58:17] is. But if time goes on, it will
[58:19] deteriorate. It will corrupt. Amen. But
[58:22] your life, your soul is worth more than
[58:24] a thousand worlds. That's what God wants
[58:27] dedicated to him. Amen. You may feel
[58:29] like a nothing this morning. You may be
[58:32] a nothing this morning, but God can take
[58:34] a nothing and make something. He can use
[58:36] you today if you'll let him. If you'll
[58:38] let him live through you. Amen. dedicate
[58:40] your life as a temple of the power of
[58:42] the Holy Ghost and let Christ work
[58:44] through that.
[58:48] &gt;&gt; There's going to be some rough spots,
[58:49] some dark places and valleys,
[58:52] but I shall not be moved.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; Let that be your testimony. I shall not
[58:57] be moved. I shall not be shaken.
[59:00] &gt;&gt; I shall not be shaken. I shall not be
[59:02] moved. I shall not slip
[59:04] &gt;&gt; because the Lord is before me always.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[59:09] Preach with me this morning. Losing my
[59:12] voice.
[59:14] Preach with me this morning. We've got
[59:16] some things that we still got to go
[59:17] through.
[59:19] &gt;&gt; David David was anointed king, but he
[59:21] had a lot of battles ahead of him.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; He had fought the bear and won.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; He had fought the lion and the spirit of
[59:28] the Lord helped him and he won. But
[59:30] David had many battles,
[59:32] &gt;&gt; many battles as as ordained king. Amen.
[59:35] He had many battles ahead of him. And
[59:38] there's going to be some threats of the
[59:39] enemy in this town. There's going to be
[59:41] a Goliath that's going to make his boat.
[59:43] You're going to run into him. Young
[59:44] people, you're going to run into him.
[59:46] Older folks and mid-ag folks, you're
[59:48] going to run into him. You're going to
[59:49] meet sickness, right?
[59:53] &gt;&gt; You're going to meet sickness that
[59:54] aspirin won't take care of. You're going
[59:56] to meet sickness that's incurable.
[59:59] You're going to meet that. But you're
[1:00:00] going to meet that sickness as David met
[1:00:02] that sickness as he met that Goliath.
[1:00:04] And we can meet him this morning. We can
[1:00:06] meet him together as the little flock
[1:00:08] with faith. Amen. You don't have to
[1:00:10] stand alone this morning. But we can
[1:00:12] stand with you. If you have a need in
[1:00:14] your body, if you have an incurable
[1:00:16] sickness, we can stand in the name of
[1:00:18] the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. And we can
[1:00:21] stand this morning and testify the word
[1:00:23] of God that it's the anointed word of
[1:00:25] God, that it's the living word of God,
[1:00:27] and that there's substance in the word
[1:00:29] of God. And if you need healing this
[1:00:31] morning, it is yours. And we're here to
[1:00:33] believe with you, sister. We're here to
[1:00:35] believe with you, brethren.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're going to meet these things,
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; Who believe? Who believes God is a
[1:00:45] healer?
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; Who believes that this morning? We stand
[1:00:49] in faith this morning without a shadow
[1:00:51] of a doubt. Amen. Amen. We don't want to
[1:00:54] just come to the house of God to toot
[1:00:55] our toot our horn. We don't just want to
[1:00:58] come to the house of God to to preach
[1:00:59] against somebody down the road. Amen.
[1:01:01] But we come to minister this morning. We
[1:01:04] come to receive, amen, ministering from
[1:01:06] angel, spirits of God. We come this
[1:01:08] morning, amen, to receive from the Holy
[1:01:10] Ghost. Amen. What he would have for us.
[1:01:13] And I tell you this morning, you don't
[1:01:15] have to leave this place. Amen. Amen.
[1:01:18] Amen. In fear of your Goliath, in fear
[1:01:20] of whatever it is. Amen. But we can
[1:01:22] overcome. Amen. In the name of Jesus
[1:01:24] Christ.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; Meet that sickness this morning. In the
[1:01:33] name of Jesus Christ,
[1:01:36] you're going to meet a Goliath. You're
[1:01:39] going to meet discouragement.
[1:01:41] You're going to meet inability.
[1:01:44] But meet it in the name of the Lord,
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; and he will see you through.
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; Christ as David. Christ is the anointed
[1:01:52] word, the anointed king, and he is the
[1:01:55] one will come and fight these battles.
[1:01:57] He is faithful this morning as David is
[1:02:00] faithful.
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. He's more faithful.
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; He's faithful in all things and he's an
[1:02:10] ontime God.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; You believe that this morning?
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; Joshua 23 and9.
[1:02:24] For the Lord hath driven out from before
[1:02:26] you great nations and strong. But as for
[1:02:28] you, no man hath been able to stand
[1:02:30] before you unto this day. One man of you
[1:02:34] shall chase a thousand. For the Lord
[1:02:37] your God, he it is that will fightth for
[1:02:39] you as he hath promised you.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; What a promise that is. There's a
[1:02:46] promise of God
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; that no man shall stand before you, no
[1:02:51] demon spirit shall stand before you.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that this morning? Amen.
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; There is no demon that can stand before
[1:03:00] the bloodbought, bloodwashed bride
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; of Jesus Christ.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; Not by what we did, but by what he did.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; But he said here, and that's a promise
[1:03:12] to you this morning. He said, "Take good
[1:03:14] heed therefore under yourselves, listen
[1:03:15] to this, that you love the Lord your
[1:03:17] God."
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; Don't don't put nothing before him
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; and he'll come fight your battles. Thank
[1:03:23] you, Lord. But when we put something
[1:03:25] before him,
[1:03:27] our faith begins to drift drift away.
[1:03:29] Our confidence drifts away. But we want
[1:03:31] to come in full faith and full
[1:03:33] confidence this morning that the Lord is
[1:03:35] before us today. That his word is before
[1:03:37] us. Amen. That we're we're doing we're
[1:03:40] we're we're faithful in the little
[1:03:41] things. We're faithful in the small
[1:03:44] things. Not just in the great things.
[1:03:45] Not just coming to church once or twice
[1:03:47] a week, but in the little things,
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah. that we can have confidence in the
[1:03:53] promise.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; You got confidence in the promise this
[1:03:56] morning?
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; You got confidence that it's the word of
[1:03:59] God.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let that be your testimony.
[1:04:04] Brother Brandham says here in in Y 1961,
[1:04:07] he said, "What could he do if he ever
[1:04:09] get one purpose in his grip person in
[1:04:11] his grip just so he can hold that one
[1:04:14] person?" How many of you want him to
[1:04:17] hold you this morning?
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; I know this is simple. Lord, hold me.
[1:04:20] this in this hour. Keep me in this hour.
[1:04:24] He said he can put 10,000 to flight with
[1:04:27] that one person. With one person in
[1:04:30] genuine faith, he can put 10,000 devils
[1:04:33] running as hard as they can go. Yes,
[1:04:35] sir. Amen. I'm so glad. Aren't you?
[1:04:38] Aren't you glad this morning? The Lord
[1:04:40] told Joshua one for a thousand. But look
[1:04:43] here. The prophet told us one for
[1:04:45] 10,000. And it's not just one. Amen. But
[1:04:49] it's two. Amen. When God and man meet,
[1:04:52] Brother Ram said, Amen. two omnipotents
[1:04:55] meet. Amen. And and he said, when two
[1:04:58] omnipotent meet, something's got to
[1:05:00] happen. Don't let that go over your
[1:05:02] head. Amen. Amen. Amen. If you can truly
[1:05:05] believe, if you can truly believe the
[1:05:07] word of God, there is power in your
[1:05:09] genuine faith. Amen. Your pure, simple
[1:05:12] faith. Amen. As simple as it is, there's
[1:05:15] power in that this morning. There's
[1:05:17] power in your Amen. And we know on the
[1:05:19] other end that all power, all
[1:05:21] omnipotence, Amen. And when those two
[1:05:23] omnipotence meet, Amen. Brother said,
[1:05:26] something's got to take place.
[1:05:28] Something's got to happen. Amen. And I
[1:05:30] believe this morning, every devil, every
[1:05:32] demon that would rise up and persecute,
[1:05:34] Amen, the bride of Jesus Christ that
[1:05:36] would try to belittle you, that would
[1:05:38] try to try to dampen down your faith
[1:05:40] with unbelief and doubt. I believe we
[1:05:42] can send every devil this morning
[1:05:44] running. Amen. Amen. If we'll agree
[1:05:46] together, Amen. If we'll put the Lord
[1:05:48] before us this morning, every devil,
[1:05:51] every sickness, Amen. This isn't a
[1:05:53] workup. This is a promise to you that
[1:05:55] the Lord would come and fight your
[1:05:57] battles.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; Every demon in hell has been let loose
[1:06:07] on you and I.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; Every demon.
[1:06:11] Amen. Every demon in hell has been let
[1:06:14] loose. Not on the Baptist folks,
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; but on those standing for the word of
[1:06:21] this hour. All hell, brother said, has
[1:06:24] been let loose on the bride, but all of
[1:06:26] heaven this morning. All of heaven has
[1:06:29] been let loose for you and I as well.
[1:06:31] Amen. For the word has been opened,
[1:06:33] amen. It wasn't just a theology,
[1:06:35] something uh uh an intellectual
[1:06:38] something that happened. Amen. But when
[1:06:39] something is loosened, amen, from the
[1:06:41] scriptures, amen, there's a power, amen,
[1:06:44] there's a power, amen, when the seals
[1:06:46] were open, amen, certain scriptures that
[1:06:48] were bound up for thousands or hundreds
[1:06:50] of years. Amen. Amen. Begin to roll in
[1:06:52] motion because what? The word had been
[1:06:55] loosened. Amen. And I want to say in
[1:06:57] this morning, everything that you have
[1:06:59] need of has been loosened to you by the
[1:07:01] opening of the word. by the opening of
[1:07:03] the word in this hour.
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; Brother Ram said, "The third pull is the
[1:07:10] opening of the word."
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; The third pull is the opening of the
[1:07:15] word. The word is here, but you've got
[1:07:17] to put the word on your lips.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; Despise not the little things.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; Despise not a little word
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; from God. Yeah.
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; For there's enough power in that to
[1:07:29] drive back 10,000 demons this morning.
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; What has been loosened to us? The
[1:07:37] fullness of the opening of the word, the
[1:07:39] fullness of the manifestation of the
[1:07:41] God, which is what the pillar of fire
[1:07:44] identified among us. Brother Ram said
[1:07:46] that is the fullness of the
[1:07:47] manifestation of God. All that God was,
[1:07:51] he poured into Christ. And all that
[1:07:53] Christ was, he poured in the church. And
[1:07:56] God, Jesus said, Jesus said, "I came
[1:07:58] from God and I go back to God." And when
[1:08:00] he went back to God, Jesus spoke from
[1:08:03] that pillar of fire. It is the fullness
[1:08:05] of the manifestation, amen, of the
[1:08:07] spirit of God among the believers. Amen.
[1:08:10] Amen. For what? That we could put a
[1:08:12] picture and and look back of what
[1:08:14] something of what was. No, that we could
[1:08:16] stand here today and know that though I
[1:08:19] don't see him with a natural eye. Amen.
[1:08:21] A prophet of God said he's identified
[1:08:23] himself among you. And that's what my
[1:08:25] ministry is. Amen. The ministry of Jesus
[1:08:27] Christ. Amen. Sent to you and I this
[1:08:30] day. Amen. To identify that he is among
[1:08:32] us. Amen. And if you can believe this
[1:08:34] morning, put the Lord before you. Put
[1:08:37] his promise before you in this hour.
[1:08:38] Amen. Amen. Look beyond this realm.
[1:08:41] Amen. And see that there's a
[1:08:43] supernatural power
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; here today.
[1:08:53] He has identified himself among us. Not
[1:08:56] only identified himself among us, but he
[1:08:57] is in our hearts.
[1:09:01] In our hearts by the spirit of God
[1:09:04] to cause every devil to flee, every
[1:09:07] demon of discouragement this morning.
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; The demon that tells you that you're not
[1:09:12] worth it anymore.
[1:09:15] He tries to steal your joy. Tries to
[1:09:18] seal your purpose.
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; Is it just me?
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; The spirit of God is here to help you
[1:09:29] fight your battles.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; Drive that enemy back today. The
[1:09:35] scripture says they overcame by the
[1:09:37] blood of the lamb and by the word of
[1:09:39] their testimony. Claim and apply the
[1:09:40] blood of Jesus over your life. That's
[1:09:43] simple, isn't it? Amen.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; But there's power in it.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; Have faith to apply the word over your
[1:09:49] home.
[1:09:50] Have faith to take the sword of the
[1:09:52] spirit and cut off your enemy's head.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; There's not one devil this morning that
[1:10:00] can stand before a son or daughter of
[1:10:01] God. Amen.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; There's not one spirit that can
[1:10:05] overwhelm you so much that is greater
[1:10:08] than the pillar of fire, that's greater
[1:10:10] than the Holy Ghost, that's greater than
[1:10:12] the angels that would minister to you to
[1:10:15] be happy.
[1:10:18] Be happy this morning.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; Lift your head up.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; Lift your head up this morning.
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Be happy this morning. Be full of
[1:10:27] joy. The joy of the Holy Ghost is there
[1:10:30] for you this morning. if you want it.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; There's no devil that can stand before
[1:10:34] you. For it is the Lord that fights for
[1:10:36] you. You may feel small this morning.
[1:10:38] You may feel like nothing.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; But you're the very purchase of God's
[1:10:43] own blood.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; He cares more about you. Brother Brham
[1:10:46] said he cares more about you than he did
[1:10:48] his own life. He cared more about you
[1:10:51] and I than he did his own blood.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that this morning? Amen.
[1:10:56] Somebody cares about you. Somebody did
[1:10:58] care about you. Amen. God cares about
[1:11:00] you. So the Bible says, "Cast all your
[1:11:02] cares upon him, for he cares for you."
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; 2 Samuel 23:14.
[1:11:17] I'm trying to hurry and then slow down
[1:11:18] and take my time all at the same time.
[1:11:20] That
[1:11:22] I don't know.
[1:11:25] 2 Samuel 23:14.
[1:11:30] Remember I titled despise not the little
[1:11:31] things. God brought David from nothing
[1:11:34] and anointed him, right?
[1:11:39] Just uh just one person can put a lot of
[1:11:42] devils to fly. One person out of
[1:11:44] nothing.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; So despise not the little things.
[1:11:47] Despise not your faith. Despise not who
[1:11:50] you are as a person. Right.
[1:11:55] 2 Samuel 23:14, "And David was in an in
[1:11:58] an hold, and the garrison of the
[1:12:00] Philistines was in in Bethlehem."
[1:12:03] Brother said, "David was here in his
[1:12:05] worst time. He was a fugitive."
[1:12:10] Here he was in his worst time. He'd
[1:12:12] already been anointed to be king. He
[1:12:15] knew what he was. He knew what he was
[1:12:17] supposed to be. And brother Bram said he
[1:12:19] was there. He was standing between two
[1:12:21] fires. the Philistines on one side and
[1:12:25] Saul on the other. A a king, a fugitive
[1:12:27] on the run. He was in the worst place
[1:12:29] that he could be because he knew the
[1:12:32] potential that he had. He knew that what
[1:12:34] he was, but yet yet here he's running
[1:12:36] from Saul. He's in a disagreement with
[1:12:39] the church down the road. And things
[1:12:42] ought not be like that, right?
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; It ought not be like that. We find
[1:12:46] ourselves in those tough spots. Brother
[1:12:49] R say he's in his worst spot that he
[1:12:51] could be.
[1:12:53] Am I preaching to somebody this morning?
[1:12:56] Maybe everybody's in a good spot this
[1:12:58] morning. I don't know. I hope you are.
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; There the Philistines on one side and
[1:13:03] Saul on the other. And they're a
[1:13:05] fugitive of man. Brother Brham said
[1:13:07] without a nation anointed to be king
[1:13:09] over a nation. But they're on the run.
[1:13:12] He was in an awful place. But he says
[1:13:15] here in why little Bethlehem, what a
[1:13:17] what a title that is. He had taken
[1:13:19] refuge in strongholds in the in the
[1:13:21] wilderness and caves trying to hide out
[1:13:23] with a little band of faithful warriors.
[1:13:25] Yet a few believing like him. But those
[1:13:28] men believed God that that would be the
[1:13:30] king. So is the believers today who is
[1:13:33] hid out from place to place. But yet
[1:13:35] they know who's coming to be king.
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; He said they hold to God's unchanging
[1:13:40] hand.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; In the midst of battle, in the midst of
[1:13:43] tears, he said in the midst of sickness
[1:13:45] and death and everything. Preach with me
[1:13:48] this morning. In the midst of all that,
[1:13:50] they still hold to God's unchanging
[1:13:52] hand. Amen. Are you holding this
[1:13:54] morning? They know that he's coming
[1:13:56] king. Amen. David there between his
[1:13:59] enemies running for his life on the run
[1:14:02] in the middle of summer in the middle of
[1:14:04] the heat.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, you appreciate a cold day like this
[1:14:08] today
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; when it's 110. And
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; I'll take this over 110 any day. Amen.
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; Any day of the week,
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; you can have it.
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; You can have it
[1:14:24] there. The heat almost too much to bear.
[1:14:29] He's beginning to wonder. Brother
[1:14:31] Brandham said he's becomes frustrated.
[1:14:33] He's wondering why God called him. And
[1:14:36] here he's caught up between his enemies,
[1:14:37] between the fires. But here on the in
[1:14:40] the in this hole up, he looks down on
[1:14:43] this mountain side. But he looks down
[1:14:45] upon this city where he was born
[1:14:48] and he begins to remember all the
[1:14:50] battles that were fought and how God
[1:14:53] came down and helped him.
[1:14:55] He begins to remember, amen, that he is
[1:14:58] his strength. That he is his keeper.
[1:15:02] Begins to say he's my shield and my
[1:15:04] buckler.
[1:15:06] He would say my the Lord is my shepherd.
[1:15:08] I shall not want. He looks on this
[1:15:12] hillside. reason in the worst place he
[1:15:13] can be.
[1:15:16] He looked down towards the mountain side
[1:15:18] towards the well of Bethlehem.
[1:15:22] Bethlehem had the best water.
[1:15:25] He began to remember how he watered his
[1:15:27] sheep. Watered his sheep out of that
[1:15:30] well. And the scripture says, "And David
[1:15:32] longed and said, oh that one would give
[1:15:34] me a drink of the water of the well of
[1:15:36] Bethlehem, which is by the gate." Verse
[1:15:39] 16. And the three mighty men break
[1:15:41] through the host of the Philistines and
[1:15:43] drew water out of the well of Bethlehem
[1:15:45] that was by the gate and took it and
[1:15:47] brought it to David. Nevertheless, he
[1:15:50] would not drink thereof. But he poured
[1:15:53] it unto out into the Lord out unto the
[1:15:57] Lord. And he said, "Be it far from me,
[1:16:00] oh Lord, that I should do this. Is not
[1:16:02] this the blood of the men that went in
[1:16:05] jeopardy of their lives? Therefore, he
[1:16:07] would not drink it. So thirsty,
[1:16:12] perhaps dying of thirst, maybe the
[1:16:14] thirstiest he's ever been, but he poured
[1:16:17] it upon the ground out of respect for
[1:16:20] the men that believed him. And it's the
[1:16:22] same as our Lord Jesus. He didn't hold
[1:16:24] within his life, but he spilt it out
[1:16:27] upon the ground. Why? Because he loves
[1:16:29] you.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; Because he loves you this morning. He
[1:16:33] did not hold within himself,
[1:16:35] but he poured it out upon the ground.
[1:16:38] But look at these men. At David's very
[1:16:41] least desire, despising not the little
[1:16:44] things.
[1:16:46] All he wanted was a drink. He was so
[1:16:49] thirsty. And all he wanted was a fresh
[1:16:51] drink from the well. It was his desire.
[1:16:55] And these warriors were willing to do
[1:16:56] whatever was needed. These mighty
[1:16:59] gentile warriors were willing to go
[1:17:01] through the battle, fight through 15
[1:17:03] miles of Philistine soldiers for a drink
[1:17:05] of water. Realize these men, these
[1:17:07] Philistine soldiers, they weren't just
[1:17:09] here and there. They were around the
[1:17:10] well. They were standing around the
[1:17:12] well. They were drinking from that well.
[1:17:14] And David was cut off. But his mighty
[1:17:17] Gentile warriors, these men that
[1:17:19] believed him, they fought and they made
[1:17:21] a way. Amen. Why? Because of the least
[1:17:23] desire of the heart of David for one
[1:17:26] drink.
[1:17:32] Despise not the little things,
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. He wants us this morning to fight.
[1:17:39] He wants you to fight this morning. You
[1:17:41] may feel like a nothing. Amen. But the
[1:17:44] anointing that was on David poured out,
[1:17:46] spilled out upon these men. The
[1:17:48] inspiration that was upon David. Amen.
[1:17:51] That he wanted to drink. Amen. Amen.
[1:17:53] That poured out their love for David.
[1:17:55] Amen. Amen. gave him the inspiration,
[1:17:57] amen, to fight. To fight through
[1:17:59] formalism, to fight through a cold
[1:18:01] church service, amen, to fight, amen, a
[1:18:04] cold spirit that will come upon your
[1:18:06] home, upon your heart, amen, to drive
[1:18:08] you from the presence of God. Amen. They
[1:18:10] fought through that. Amen. It was a
[1:18:12] tough battle. Amen. But they overcame.
[1:18:14] Amen. Amen. Because of David's least
[1:18:16] desire, they brought him a drink.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:18:25] Amen. Destroy those spirits. You have to
[1:18:28] destroy those spirits. You have to fight
[1:18:30] through that to bring our Lord Jesus a
[1:18:33] drink this morning. Amen. Destroy every
[1:18:36] doubt. I'm sorry if I'm blowing into
[1:18:38] that. Destroy every doubt and every
[1:18:42] unbelieving spirit that says he's not
[1:18:44] the same as he was yesterday.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; Destroy that this morning. And you can
[1:18:50] have your promise. You can you can bring
[1:18:52] David a drink this morning if you'll
[1:18:54] destroy that.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Have faith in him for who he is as
[1:18:59] God this morning. He's the son of God.
[1:19:02] Have faith in his word this morning.
[1:19:04] Have faith that he is your victory. Have
[1:19:06] faith this morning that that if you're
[1:19:08] you're meeting a a Goliath this morning,
[1:19:11] have faith that he is your healer, that
[1:19:12] he is your deliverer. Amen. Have faith
[1:19:14] this morning that he is the revealed
[1:19:16] word. He is the revealed vindicated word
[1:19:19] of this hour. Amen. and take your stand.
[1:19:21] Fight your battle. Amen. Amen. What he
[1:19:24] wants today is a drink of water. Amen.
[1:19:26] His is He's worthy this morning. He's
[1:19:29] worthy of your life. He's worthy of your
[1:19:31] testimony. He's worthy of everything
[1:19:33] that we can give him. Though we're not
[1:19:35] saved by works, we're saved by grace.
[1:19:37] Amen. But because we love him, because
[1:19:39] of his least desire, we'll believe his
[1:19:41] word.
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; I love this. Brother Ram says, "Oh, come
[1:19:50] stand with me by my side. I wish I could
[1:19:52] put it up here. I'm not that smart. I'm
[1:19:56] standing in a terrible place. I
[1:19:57] challenge today." He says, "These tapes
[1:20:00] go over the world. I challenge some man,
[1:20:02] some warrior who loves Jesus Christ and
[1:20:04] knows that these things has got to be
[1:20:06] fulfilled today, brethren. Come stand by
[1:20:09] my side and come pull the word of God.
[1:20:11] Forget those dried sisters, excuse me,
[1:20:15] and stagnated denominations that you're
[1:20:17] living in. pull the fresh word of God.
[1:20:20] Let's give Jesus a good drink of fresh
[1:20:22] Pentecostal water.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. The the prophet's challenging the
[1:20:26] people of that day. And no doubt some of
[1:20:29] you took heed to that challenge. You
[1:20:30] come out of those sistns. You come out
[1:20:32] of that stagnated water. What? To a
[1:20:34] well. Amen. An everlasting well, a
[1:20:37] spring flowing up. Amen. Of the goodness
[1:20:40] of God, of the mercy of God. He said
[1:20:42] that's his desire today. Back to the
[1:20:44] original Pentecost. Back to the word. He
[1:20:46] said it's prophesied we do so in Malachi
[1:20:49] the 4th chapter return to the faith of
[1:20:52] the children back to the fathers again
[1:20:55] who would stand this morning. He said
[1:20:58] stand by me. Let's cut a hole through
[1:21:00] this denominational creed. Let's get in
[1:21:02] there. He's crying for a good fresh
[1:21:04] drink of Pentecostal water. Original
[1:21:06] Pentecost.
[1:21:08] Listen to this. He said not a bunch of
[1:21:11] carrying on screaming hollering. I mean
[1:21:14] a real genuine Holy Spirit baptism that
[1:21:17] produces the life of Jesus Christ
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; back into the person.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; That's what we're fighting for today.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; That's what we're fighting for.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; That's what we're standing for.
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; That's what we we've been returned back
[1:21:29] to.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; The ministry of Jesus Christ came
[1:21:34] through a prophet in this day. It wasn't
[1:21:36] the ministry of a man, but it was the
[1:21:38] ministry of Jesus Christ to minister
[1:21:41] back us back to the foundation of the
[1:21:44] apostolic fathers. And what was it?
[1:21:47] Yeah, it was hollering and shouting. It
[1:21:49] was healings. It was all kinds of
[1:21:51] things. But what was it? It was
[1:21:53] something, amen, that changed their
[1:21:54] lives. It was something that made them
[1:21:56] different. And that's what we're
[1:21:57] earnestly contending for this morning.
[1:21:59] Amen. The faith that was once delivered
[1:22:01] to the saints.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; You believe that? Amen.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; Is that Is that our fight?
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; His least desire. That's what he wants
[1:22:14] this morning.
[1:22:16] Try to hurry.
[1:22:17] Is a drink of that life of the Holy
[1:22:20] Ghost.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; If you're living that life this morning,
[1:22:23] you're giving him a drink. He He's He's
[1:22:26] pleased. It's
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; You understand? That's what he wants.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; That's all he wants.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:22:36] And what does that what does that
[1:22:39] produce? It produces a real sanctified
[1:22:42] life full of not yourself but the Holy
[1:22:45] Ghost. It does not produce an arrogance
[1:22:48] but it produces a sweet Christlike
[1:22:50] Christminded
[1:22:52] a heart centered on being faithful in
[1:22:54] all things.
[1:22:56] Those warriors moved at the at his least
[1:22:59] desire.
[1:23:01] Brother Brham challenge us. Will you
[1:23:03] move this morning? Will you move where
[1:23:05] you're sitting? I'm not asking you to
[1:23:07] stand up. Will you move where you're at?
[1:23:09] Will you move where you've been for the
[1:23:11] last 20 years?
[1:23:13] Will you move out of that condition this
[1:23:15] morning? I'm asking you,
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; will Will we move when God calls us to
[1:23:20] move? I want to move when God calls us
[1:23:22] to move. When he inspires me, I want to
[1:23:24] move. I want to give him a fresh drink.
[1:23:25] Amen. So, not something old stagnated,
[1:23:28] but a fresh drink of worship.
[1:23:33] What is it? It's a supernatural strength
[1:23:35] that God gives to the believer. A desire
[1:23:38] to serve him and live for him in this
[1:23:41] dying generation. And there's a strength
[1:23:44] that comes when you're in the service
[1:23:45] for the king. And he wants someone this
[1:23:48] morning who will simply stand for him
[1:23:50] and believe. Amen. And his power and his
[1:23:53] anointing as it came upon those men
[1:23:55] comes and helps you. He's the coming
[1:23:58] king. Do you believe that this morning?
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; Everything else will be torn down.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; Every everything will be torn down and
[1:24:06] his kingdom will stand. And David had a
[1:24:09] desire as we read. David had a desire.
[1:24:11] He wanted to build something. He wanted
[1:24:13] to build a a a temple for the ark of God
[1:24:16] that was there sitting in the curtains.
[1:24:19] But it wasn't for David to do that. But
[1:24:21] it was for his seed after him. But even
[1:24:24] the great temple that Solomon built
[1:24:26] would be broken and would be torn down.
[1:24:28] the greatness and the glory of that
[1:24:30] kingdom even even as great as it was
[1:24:33] could not even endure
[1:24:35] being torn down. Amen. So will this
[1:24:39] earthly that you and I have it will
[1:24:41] corrupt. It will pass away. Every bit of
[1:24:44] our possessions, it will it will
[1:24:45] corrupt. Amen. It will rust. It will
[1:24:48] pass away. Amen. But I believe this
[1:24:50] morning that his word will never fail.
[1:24:52] His covenant can never fail. Amen. And I
[1:24:55] believe this morning, his mercy, his
[1:24:57] mercy endures forever. Everything else
[1:24:59] can pass away. Everything can go. Even
[1:25:01] in the greatness, even what God would
[1:25:04] allow in the natural, it will pass away.
[1:25:06] But the spiritual, what God God does
[1:25:09] spiritually for you young people, what
[1:25:10] he does, Amen, that is eternal. That is
[1:25:13] everlasting. It is something that the
[1:25:15] kingdom of hell cannot destroy.
[1:25:23] It is a covenant.
[1:25:25] Everything will pass away, but his mercy
[1:25:28] endures forever this morning to his
[1:25:30] people.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; We can get out of step, but his mercy
[1:25:33] endures forever.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; I'm counting on that.
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; I'm counting on that with everything
[1:25:38] I've got. His grace endures. His grace
[1:25:41] brings us through. Right? Even when we
[1:25:44] don't do the little things, even when we
[1:25:46] don't do what we're supposed to do,
[1:25:48] God's mercy endures forever. His
[1:25:50] covenant, Solomon didn't do what he was
[1:25:53] supposed to do. And that's that's partly
[1:25:54] why his kingdom went the way it did and
[1:25:56] it just went downhill after that after
[1:25:58] that. Amen. But God would raise up a
[1:26:01] seed, a true seed of David that would
[1:26:03] bring a kingdom that would bring a
[1:26:05] kingdom to a people that could not be
[1:26:06] moved.
[1:26:12] Should I let y'all out early?
[1:26:19] Brother Harvey said, "Yep,
[1:26:25] you love the Lord this morning."
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; Golly, what should I do here? We should
[1:26:30] have had two services.
[1:26:32] You love the Lord.
[1:26:39] Try to skip some of this. Okay.
[1:26:42] Is that all right?
[1:26:48] You think of the little things.
[1:26:50] Micah 5:2. But thou Bethlehem,
[1:26:55] though thou be little amongst the
[1:26:57] thousands of Judah, yet out of thee
[1:26:59] shall come forth unto me that is to be a
[1:27:02] ruler in Israel. Micah 5:2. whose goings
[1:27:06] forth have been from old and from
[1:27:07] everlasting.
[1:27:09] Out of little Bethlehem.
[1:27:11] Little there it means insignificant.
[1:27:14] It means unimportant,
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:27:19] Nothing.
[1:27:20] But out of Bethlehem will come a ruler.
[1:27:24] Will come a ruler. Would come a governor
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; that would set up a kingdom that could
[1:27:29] not be moved. A promise would be given
[1:27:32] to a virgin. In Isaiah 7:14,
[1:27:35] "Therefore, the Lord himself shall give
[1:27:37] you a sign. Behold, a virgin shall
[1:27:40] conceive and bear a son, and shall call
[1:27:42] his name Emanuel." What a promise. No
[1:27:45] doubt the young ladies, ever since that
[1:27:48] promise was spoken, oh, that it's got to
[1:27:51] be me. And the word drives us to live
[1:27:55] according to the word. When you put the
[1:27:57] promise before you, no doubt there was
[1:27:59] worthy young ladies that could have
[1:28:02] fulfilled that promise. But he had one.
[1:28:05] He had Mary. He had someone in mind,
[1:28:08] right?
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; Mary received the message from the
[1:28:12] angel. She received the promise. She
[1:28:16] received the word and not in her own
[1:28:18] intellect, but she received the word for
[1:28:20] what it was. She didn't complicate the
[1:28:22] thing.
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:28:25] Brother Rams preached God hiding himself
[1:28:27] in simplicity and he reveals himself in
[1:28:29] the same and it's simple. Don't put your
[1:28:33] interpretation to the word. Take it for
[1:28:35] what it is and let God interpret it the
[1:28:37] way he wants to.
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; She received the word
[1:28:42] for what it was.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; She didn't question it. She said, "Be it
[1:28:46] unto me." As the angel ministered to
[1:28:48] her, she said, "Be it unto me according
[1:28:51] to thy word." And what happened? It
[1:28:53] brought forth what the scriptures said.
[1:28:54] It brought forth Emanuel, God with us.
[1:28:57] It brought forth Jesus Christ. It
[1:28:59] brought forth the King of Kings and the
[1:29:01] Lord of Lords. It brought forth Amen.
[1:29:04] Amen. By the Holy Ghost, it brought
[1:29:06] forth, Amen. a creative blood. I'm glad
[1:29:09] these girls aren't here this morning to
[1:29:11] write down how many times I said amen.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; But it it bring it brought forth, what
[1:29:15] did it do? From a simple belief, from
[1:29:17] from simply believing the word and one
[1:29:19] simple promise. Amen. ministered by an
[1:29:22] angel. It brought forth the blood of
[1:29:24] Jesus Christ. It brought forth the blood
[1:29:26] of God. Amen. Despise not the little
[1:29:28] things. And in that blood was a
[1:29:31] chemistry to set me free, to heal your
[1:29:33] body, to set this church free, to set
[1:29:36] every person free. Amen. That whatever,
[1:29:38] Amen. received that blood in faith.
[1:29:40] Amen. Amen. And it's common faith this
[1:29:42] morning. Amen. Amen. And applying the
[1:29:44] token, they they applied the blood with
[1:29:46] hissip. And brother Random said that's a
[1:29:48] common weed. Faith is a common thing
[1:29:50] this morning. Amen. And you can apply
[1:29:52] the blood. Amen. Amen. Despise not the
[1:29:55] little things. Despise not the faith
[1:29:57] that you have.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; Despise not the chemistry of the blood
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; that would set us free this morning.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; You love the Lord. Amen.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; Luke 12:32, "Fear not, little flock, for
[1:30:20] it's your father's good will to give you
[1:30:21] the kingdom.
[1:30:24] This kingdom that he gives can't be torn
[1:30:26] down.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; This kingdom can't be moved."
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; I'll try to finish up here with this.
[1:30:34] God is interested in the small things.
[1:30:37] We know the the testimony of the little
[1:30:39] fish. There, Brother Rams in the boat.
[1:30:42] There were those Jehovah's Witness men.
[1:30:44] And there they caught this little video,
[1:30:48] bluegill, whatever it was,
[1:30:51] and swallowed the hook, right? And you
[1:30:55] know, it's it's hard to get that hook
[1:30:56] out and it's just a little insignificant
[1:30:58] fish, right? So, you just yank it out
[1:31:00] and throw the fish on the bank.
[1:31:04] But they're they begin to talk about the
[1:31:08] things of God and and different things
[1:31:10] and and God sovereignly
[1:31:13] sovereignly comes down
[1:31:16] tells brother Brown
[1:31:18] stand up
[1:31:20] little fishy. I give you your life back.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; Right. This is the third pull. Now this
[1:31:28] is the power that is among us.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; Yes. not to try to recreate because it's
[1:31:32] sovereignly, but the power of the word
[1:31:34] is in our midst. The power of the word
[1:31:38] is for the believer.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; There are insignificant fish. Many
[1:31:42] people I think he talked about the the
[1:31:46] ones that are epileptic that needed
[1:31:47] prayer, but they're he said it shows you
[1:31:51] that God cares about the little things.
[1:31:54] God cares about the insignificant
[1:31:56] things.
[1:31:58] And I I just want to encourage her faith
[1:31:59] this morning, Sister Hattie, right? She
[1:32:02] gave what little bit of tithe money that
[1:32:05] she had. It wasn't much. The prophet was
[1:32:07] going down to give it back to her.
[1:32:11] He didn't need it. She needed it worse
[1:32:12] than he did. Just a little bit of money,
[1:32:16] but she was following the commandment of
[1:32:19] the word.
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; And there, Brother Brandham, she's
[1:32:24] welcomed in his home. And there they're
[1:32:26] talking about the things that had
[1:32:28] happened in the squirrels and different
[1:32:30] things and how how creation happened and
[1:32:34] not knowing much. Just a little woman
[1:32:38] that's nothing but the truth. That's
[1:32:40] right.
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; She didn't say a great thing.
[1:32:43] She just believed the word. She believed
[1:32:46] what happened. And out of that, he said,
[1:32:49] "You said the right thing, Haddie." All
[1:32:52] she said was, "That's nothing but the
[1:32:54] truth." Right?
[1:32:57] But it's just the little things.
[1:32:59] And there he said, "Whatever you want,
[1:33:02] it will be."
[1:33:04] I believe that with all my heart,
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; I believe with all my heart that took
[1:33:09] place.
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; Whatever you want. There's your sister.
[1:33:14] She's been crippled for however many
[1:33:16] years. You can have all the money in the
[1:33:17] world you want.
[1:33:19] But God seen her desire.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; Her least desire. He knew what it was.
[1:33:25] It wasn't for for that and for sure she
[1:33:28] would love to see her sister healed.
[1:33:32] I'd love love to have a we'd love to
[1:33:35] have a pocket full of money, wouldn't
[1:33:36] we? A bank full of money.
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; But that's what lasts is is the soul.
[1:33:44] It seems insignificant one person but
[1:33:46] brother Broom said it's worth thousand
[1:33:49] worlds 10,000 worlds. It's the little
[1:33:51] things.
[1:33:53] I'll try to close here but musicians can
[1:33:56] come.
[1:34:01] You just take God and simplicity.
[1:34:04] Somebody asked brother Brandham. They
[1:34:05] said, "How do we get closer to God?"
[1:34:09] What'd he say? Read your Bible and pray.
[1:34:12] Yeah,
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; it's so simple, but we overlook it. It's
[1:34:15] so simple, we can't take it. We want
[1:34:17] something great.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; We want some great audible.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; It's It's that simple.
[1:34:24] Amen. You love the Lord this morning.
[1:34:28] Amen. You stand.
[1:34:34] If you have a need this morning, I'd be
[1:34:35] happy to pray with you. Just God bless
[1:34:38] you this morning. Come sing. Oh, were
[1:34:41] made there
[1:34:43] just for me.

[1:35:11] I just claim
[1:35:13] those preious blood stains. Once again,
[1:35:17] with our hands lifted to him. Oh, I
[1:35:21] claim
[1:35:23] the blood
[1:35:26] Jesus shed
[1:35:29] on Calary.
[1:35:33] Those
[1:35:34] [Music]
[1:35:37] preious
[1:35:38] blood stains
[1:35:42] were made there just for me.
