[41:43] and i've been anticipating this for
[41:46] several days i'll admit
[41:48] there for a little while i put it out of
[41:50] my mind but for the last several days
[41:52] for the curtis i've been looking forward
[41:53] to

[41:58] sitting there but jt's back there and
[41:59] each one of you that come

[42:11] ones that have already went on

[42:19] and years and all once you begin to see
[42:21] the ones with the sam that you saw
[42:23] went on before you my
[42:27] what a gathering time that's going to be
[42:32] man it feels good to be back in the
[42:34] house of the lord

[42:40] we don't have very long here we serve a
[42:43] risen
[42:44] savior amen and he's coming back because
[42:47] he lives we'll live
[42:49] also amen we live also romans chapter 8
[42:52] and
[42:53] verse 18. i want to pick up on our
[42:56] study on the breach and i'm happy to be
[43:00] back i
[43:00] want to thank brother allen for going
[43:03] above and beyond to take several of the
[43:05] services and
[43:06] joe adams as well i understand they did
[43:08] a marvelous job and i was able to
[43:10] completely check out for a couple of
[43:11] weeks and
[43:12] it was just did wonders for me mentally
[43:14] i
[43:16] i love you all but i'm i'm ready to go
[43:18] back at it now but we just needed that
[43:20] and i appreciate you allowing me to do
[43:22] that
[43:23] brother robert wilson tonight is in a
[43:25] country
[43:27] he sent me a text today that he had
[43:28] arrived that is 99
[43:31] muslim less than
[43:34] 200 believers there in that country
[43:36] would you be just remembering him in
[43:38] prayer i know some of you haven't met
[43:40] him some of you did at
[43:42] the meetings over at gibson but he'll
[43:45] hopefully be able to give us a report of
[43:46] this trip we're supporting him on this
[43:48] trip and
[43:48] it's completely preaching to muslim
[43:52] people and people of other faiths and
[43:54] there's a few christians in that country
[43:56] preaching to them about christ and about
[43:58] the message of the
[43:58] hour and to completely new people and
[44:01] that's what i want to support i want to
[44:03] be behind that and i've been with
[44:04] brother robert overseas i know
[44:05] what he does and what he preaches so
[44:07] you'd be praying for him and
[44:09] it's dangerous but he don't have any
[44:11] fear because he's a real missionary and
[44:13] so i'm glad he's doing it not me
[44:15] so be praying for him especially that's
[44:18] been on my heart on that trip romans
[44:20] 8 18 he says for i reckon that the
[44:24] sufferings of this present time
[44:26] are not worthy to be compared with the
[44:28] glory which shall be revealed in us
[44:31] amen for the earnest expectation of the
[44:34] creature eateth for the manifestation of
[44:37] the sons
[44:38] of god i remember brother andrew was
[44:42] here what he said that sons plural
[44:44] plural the sons of god but the creature
[44:47] was made subject to vanity not willingly
[44:50] but by reason of him who has subjected
[44:51] the same and hope
[44:53] because the creature itself also shall
[44:55] be delivered from the bondage of
[44:57] corruption
[44:58] into the glorious liberty of the
[45:00] children of god
[45:02] for we know that the whole creation
[45:04] groaneth and travail have been pained
[45:05] together until now
[45:07] not only they but ourselves also which
[45:09] have the first fruits of the spirit
[45:12] even we ourselves grown within ourselves
[45:15] waiting for the adoption to wit the
[45:17] redemption
[45:18] of our body and then i want to jump to
[45:21] verse 29
[45:23] he says for whom he did for no he also
[45:25] did predestinate
[45:28] for what purpose why did he predestinate
[45:30] to be conformed to the image
[45:33] of his son that he might be the
[45:35] firstborn among many brethren
[45:38] amen we believe that tonight pray lord
[45:41] without his blessing to the word you may
[45:42] be seated
[45:47] i want to talk to you about the dominion
[45:49] of the sons of god
[45:52] this is what brother branham is dealing
[45:53] with in the breach where we left off he
[45:56] was laying a background for why
[45:57] redemption was necessary
[46:00] he talks about the earth groaning to be
[46:02] restored and he says we know the earth
[46:04] is not
[46:05] in the condition it ought to be in or as
[46:08] he says there ought to be condition
[46:11] he said and when nature and peoples as
[46:13] the bible said are groaning it shows
[46:15] there's something
[46:16] they're not and they're ought to be
[46:18] conditioned they've fallen from
[46:19] somewhere
[46:21] he said now we don't need anybody to
[46:23] interpret that for us
[46:24] for of course we know he said it was
[46:27] eternal life they had fallen from
[46:29] they lost their claims on eternal life
[46:31] by the fall of adam and eve who fell
[46:34] from eternal life to death in the garden
[46:35] of eden and brought all nature
[46:38] under them to death and you say well is
[46:40] that true well that's what the bible
[46:42] says first corinthians 15 22 for as in
[46:45] adam all
[46:46] die oh all die
[46:50] and i read i was reading just happen to
[46:52] be reading and
[46:54] questions and answers tonight where
[46:55] brother random said that sometimes the
[46:57] devil will
[46:59] start he said in a mild way in a person
[47:02] to make them feel like they're a good
[47:04] person
[47:05] the devil actually leave them in that
[47:07] condition all of their life
[47:09] because they will never be saved because
[47:12] they think they're too good
[47:13] and and so he said the devil as he said
[47:15] that's a demon in a mild form
[47:18] he said but in adam all die but in
[47:21] christ
[47:21] all will be made alive amen
[47:24] and so brother madam said a tree never
[47:26] died before adam
[47:27] an animal wouldn't die before adam
[47:30] there's only one thing that cannot die
[47:32] and that's god because he's eternal
[47:34] he said and that's the only way we can
[47:36] ever keep from dying we have to have
[47:37] eternal life
[47:38] in us to be the sons and daughters
[47:42] of god
[47:45] he said but when we died as i said in
[47:47] the message this morning to sin
[47:49] we sold out our birthrights and crossed
[47:52] this chasm now he's talking about the
[47:54] reason why
[47:55] revelation 4 and 5 had to take place
[47:59] why did it have to happen why did there
[48:01] have to be a lamb why was there a breach
[48:03] between god and man well it's because we
[48:07] sold out our birthrights and crossed
[48:08] this chasm
[48:10] he said now we're beyond the reach of
[48:12] god on the other this
[48:13] other side of the chasm he said now of
[48:16] course when
[48:16] adam fell to death he brought death upon
[48:18] all creation this isn't new doctrine
[48:21] in fact spurgeon taught this i believe i
[48:23] got that quote and put it
[48:25] on here to show you i don't know if you
[48:26] can see it but he said the law shows the
[48:28] distance
[48:29] that exists between god and man and the
[48:31] gospel bridges that awful chasm
[48:34] and brings the sinner across it
[48:38] that's the breach right
[48:41] the gospel brings the center across the
[48:44] chatham
[48:44] chasm now in ezekiel 22
[48:48] 30 the the prophets understood that it
[48:51] was
[48:51] difficult to find a man to stand in that
[48:55] breach
[48:57] where are you going to find one and he
[49:00] said i sought for a man among them and
[49:02] that should make up the hedge and
[49:04] stand in the gap before me for the land
[49:06] that i should not destroy it he said but
[49:08] i found
[49:08] none i didn't find anybody that could
[49:12] stand in there
[49:13] so i would not destroy the land that's
[49:15] the condition we're in today
[49:16] but there was a lamb that was worthy to
[49:19] stand in the breach and make up the
[49:21] hedge
[49:22] aren't you glad for that tonight
[49:26] i said 28 8 isaiah put it this way he
[49:28] said for all tables are full of vomit
[49:30] and filthiness
[49:31] what a graphic description of the
[49:33] condition of man
[49:35] the condition that mankind is in without
[49:38] god without
[49:39] without the breach without the one who
[49:41] filled the gap
[49:43] and and there's only one man who's
[49:45] worthy to fill that gap and
[49:47] and that's found in first timothy 2 5
[49:49] for there is one god
[49:51] one mediator between god and men the man
[49:53] christ jesus
[49:55] no one else can fill that gap
[49:58] when people tell you and i believe that
[50:01] in this hour
[50:02] a prophet lived as close to christ as
[50:05] we've ever seen a man
[50:06] live but he couldn't fill that role he
[50:09] couldn't be the one who stood in the
[50:10] breach he was born in sin
[50:12] shaping and iniquity one man that did
[50:15] that a mediator between god and man
[50:18] and that will never change and he's the
[50:20] one that we're going to worship
[50:22] he's the one we're going to fall down
[50:24] before now
[50:27] but random tells us in the breach he
[50:29] said now he was given free moral agency
[50:32] it was given to them just as we so to
[50:34] make a choice
[50:36] he said no adam and eve in the beginning
[50:37] there was a tree of right and wrong
[50:39] before
[50:40] them and that same tree
[50:43] sets before each and every one
[50:46] of us he said see god isn't doing for
[50:51] adam or for eve you say well it's their
[50:53] fault
[50:54] he said no not now it isn't it's your
[50:57] fault
[50:59] why because the man came the mediator
[51:01] came
[51:02] you can't put it back on adam anymore
[51:05] because the second adam came
[51:08] and now every one of us has an
[51:09] opportunity to partake of the tree of
[51:12] knowledge of good and evil with the tree
[51:13] of life you say well what about
[51:14] predestination
[51:15] predestination just gives you the
[51:17] ability to
[51:18] to do that right it makes you have a
[51:21] desire to want that
[51:24] right but you have to make that choice
[51:28] but now he says and
[51:31] he said it's set before you he said it's
[51:33] your fault you can't place it on adam
[51:35] now you've got to place it on yourself
[51:37] because right and wrong is set before
[51:39] you
[51:40] he said we're on the same basis as adam
[51:43] and eve and i want to touch on this
[51:47] sometime
[51:48] about rebecca's choice and we won't get
[51:50] into it tonight but
[51:51] i told somebody i was going to have a
[51:52] hard time because i've gotten several
[51:54] thoughts over the last couple weeks and
[51:57] and i'm a hard time staying away from
[51:59] them tonight but
[52:00] but rebecca had a choice rebecca had a
[52:04] choice
[52:05] and it was in her to make the right
[52:07] choice
[52:09] but it was her choice right and and
[52:13] it wasn't that you know she would sit
[52:16] back and say well
[52:18] let me reason this out let me think
[52:19] about it let me get all the material and
[52:21] try to make an
[52:22] informed decision no she just said
[52:25] here why don't you sit down i'll give
[52:27] the camels water
[52:29] and he gave her the gifts and and told
[52:31] her about
[52:32] isaac and and said you've got to make a
[52:35] decision today
[52:37] if you're going to go meet a man you've
[52:38] never seen a man you can't even prove
[52:41] exists
[52:43] you realize that he can only prove the
[52:45] only way he could even prove
[52:47] that isaac existed was by the gifts he
[52:49] gave her
[52:51] very man and but but she couldn't even
[52:54] prove that he existed but what did she
[52:56] do
[52:56] for the harvey sheep she said i'll go
[52:59] and that's what the real predestinated
[53:01] seed does
[53:03] makes that choice says i'll go there's
[53:05] something on the inside of brother sam
[53:06] and say i'll go if nobody else goes
[53:09] i'll go with family don't go i'll go if
[53:11] the church don't go
[53:12] i'll go if everybody else turns him
[53:14] aside i'll go with him
[53:18] amen i might have to slow down tonight
[53:24] i was in her to make the right choice he
[53:27] said but you see when we are redeemed
[53:30] we no more want our own choice
[53:33] but we want his choice
[53:36] amen we have a choice but once we've
[53:38] made that choice
[53:39] once we are redeemed we we don't want
[53:41] our own choice anymore
[53:43] we're not looking to prove whether he's
[53:46] right or wrong
[53:47] whether he's good or bad
[53:50] i believe it was bill gates that wrote a
[53:52] song he said don't ask me whether he's
[53:53] good or bad he's talking about the
[53:55] the man that was healed the leper or the
[53:58] the crippled man that was healed and the
[54:00] pharisee says
[54:01] what kind of man is he he said don't ask
[54:03] me if he's good or bad
[54:05] but the guilt i have is gone i was
[54:08] i was a crippled but now i can walk
[54:12] i don't want a choice anymore we want
[54:16] his choice
[54:18] now adam and eve wanted their own choice
[54:22] they wanted to find out what it was to
[54:24] have wisdom so they probed into it and
[54:26] caused death
[54:28] be careful what you probe into in man's
[54:30] wisdom
[54:32] because there's no life in it oh it does
[54:35] watch what it does
[54:36] watch what your wisdom does oh you say
[54:38] i'm smart but what does it do to your
[54:40] family
[54:41] what does it do to everybody around you
[54:43] when you gain it
[54:46] what what is the production of your life
[54:48] when you gain this wisdom
[54:50] but see we don't want that choice we
[54:52] want christ
[54:54] amen and brother branham says now when a
[54:57] man has been redeemed he don't care
[54:58] anymore for scholarship
[55:00] you don't care anymore for things of the
[55:02] world the wisdom of the world he don't
[55:04] want no choice at all
[55:05] christ has been his choice and that's
[55:08] all of it
[55:09] in other words he's not looking for
[55:10] information
[55:12] to base a choice on he's made a choice
[55:16] right and so he goes about he's not
[55:18] looking to prove it right or wrong he
[55:20] just knows what god did
[55:22] and he's going he's redeemed
[55:26] but brown said he just no one wants to
[55:28] lead himself
[55:30] you don't want nobody to talk him into
[55:32] where to go and what to do
[55:35] and you know i had a hard time being
[55:37] convinced of this but i've learned it
[55:39] i used to not believe this but people
[55:41] actually want to be talked into doing
[55:43] something
[55:45] and that's why churches that preach
[55:47] false doctrine can be full of people
[55:50] and sometimes even churches that are
[55:52] cults
[55:54] can be filled with people because people
[55:56] want to be talked into doing something
[56:00] have you ever looked at mormonism not
[56:02] just pick on them because
[56:03] many of them are good people but if
[56:04] you're looked at the doctrines and
[56:06] things
[56:06] they come up with it's crazy it's not
[56:09] with the word at all why do so many
[56:11] people believe it
[56:12] they want somebody to tell him what to
[56:14] where to go and what to do
[56:17] right people want that they want they
[56:19] make their choice based on
[56:21] intellectualism based on
[56:23] this man sounds good the wisdom of the
[56:24] world but he said
[56:26] he don't want nobody to talk him into
[56:28] where to go and what to do he just waits
[56:30] and finds out the choice of his maker
[56:32] then he goes in the name of his maker
[56:34] when the maker tells him
[56:36] to go now watch this he said but man
[56:40] seeking wisdom wants to find
[56:42] now brother brown was talking to us
[56:43] preachers now so i guess just me and
[56:45] me and brother allen tonight i don't
[56:47] think i see any other preachers here but
[56:50] look he said man seeking wisdom wants to
[56:52] find well this parish is pretty good but
[56:53] they pay me more over yonder
[56:55] i'll go over there he said that's wisdom
[56:59] wisdom now look see if you're a son and
[57:03] we're going to get into this what it
[57:04] means to be a son of god
[57:05] or a daughter of god if you're a child
[57:09] of god
[57:10] you're led by the spirit of god look at
[57:11] romans 8 12.
[57:13] he said therefore brethren we are dead
[57:15] or it's not to the flesh to live after
[57:16] the flesh free if you live after the
[57:18] flesh
[57:19] you shall die if you through the spirit
[57:21] do mortify the deeds of the body you
[57:23] shall live
[57:25] for as many as are led by the spirit of
[57:27] god
[57:29] they are the sons of god
[57:32] and so brother branham brings that down
[57:34] into preaching but whatever it is that
[57:36] you do
[57:38] you know that you're led when you're led
[57:40] by the spirit of god you know you are
[57:41] the sons of god
[57:44] you have not received the spirit of
[57:45] bondage again to fear
[57:47] now watch what he's saying he said
[57:48] you've not received the spirit of the
[57:50] law
[57:51] which was the spirit of bondage the
[57:53] spirit of
[57:54] i have to do this but i don't want to i
[57:57] have to do this because it's my family
[57:59] my culture my nation moses said do it so
[58:02] i'll do it that's the spirit of bondage
[58:03] again to fear
[58:04] but you've not received that you've not
[58:07] received a spirit that says well brother
[58:09] branham said it so i have to do it well
[58:11] that's
[58:11] that's good but that's not the spirit of
[58:13] adoption
[58:15] right it's good that you want to believe
[58:16] what a messenger says but that's not the
[58:18] spirit of adoption
[58:19] the spirit of adoption is when the
[58:20] spirit itself
[58:22] comes in and lives in you whereby we cry
[58:25] abba father
[58:27] he said the spirit itself beareth
[58:28] witness with our spirit that we are the
[58:31] children of god
[58:33] and if children then heirs heirs of god
[58:36] and joint heirs with christ
[58:37] and so be that we suffer with him that
[58:39] we may be also glorified together
[58:41] now so that what makes the sons of god
[58:43] now roman
[58:45] or back to the breach brother brown said
[58:46] now when adam sinned
[58:48] he eating his wife's reasoning instead
[58:50] of holding to god's word
[58:51] he said that's what made adam sin he
[58:54] said his wife
[58:55] reasoned with satan and then produced
[58:58] the product to adam and adam turned
[59:00] loose of the word
[59:01] and sold out look what he lost
[59:07] he lost his inheritance when he lost his
[59:11] fellowship and i want you to bear down
[59:14] because i'm i'm not going to hold you
[59:16] very long tonight
[59:18] contrary to what my brother said
[59:21] i did not watch the services while i was
[59:23] gone try to set ourselves apart but
[59:26] someone told me that my brother said i'd
[59:27] preach two hours tonight and i'm gonna
[59:28] prove him wrong
[59:33] listen he said he lost his inheritance
[59:36] when he lost his fellowship and right to
[59:37] life he said remember the day you eat
[59:39] there of that day you die
[59:41] when he lost his life he also lost his
[59:44] inheritance in life
[59:46] because he had now watched completely
[59:49] supreme control of the earth
[59:54] oh my he was the god
[59:57] of the earth
[1:00:01] the earth was adam's domain
[1:00:04] right the earth belonged to adam
[1:00:08] the other planets and the stars
[1:00:10] everything god kept that for himself but
[1:00:12] the earth
[1:00:13] belonged to adam
[1:00:17] but the brown says god is the god of the
[1:00:18] universe everywhere
[1:00:20] but his son had this earth think about
[1:00:23] it
[1:00:24] everything in the earth
[1:00:29] his son had this earth now look what
[1:00:32] what this breach what the opening of the
[1:00:33] seals
[1:00:34] is going to take us back to right it
[1:00:37] brings us back
[1:00:38] into this condition to where
[1:00:41] listen we're not we're not talking now
[1:00:42] to to children this isn't skim milk
[1:00:45] this is to those who believe right you
[1:00:48] got to believe this is some this is not
[1:00:50] just
[1:00:50] well we're going to heaven someday but
[1:00:52] he come to bring you back under
[1:00:53] authority
[1:00:55] to be able to have dominion over the
[1:00:57] earth
[1:01:03] he said well it's hard for me to believe
[1:01:05] that when i can't get my car to start
[1:01:09] but look he wants you to have dominion
[1:01:10] over this
[1:01:16] brother man put it this way in just
[1:01:17] simple terms he said become so full of
[1:01:18] the holy ghost till the devil don't know
[1:01:20] what to do with you
[1:01:24] he said in this way he said you've come
[1:01:26] so far the holy ghost that
[1:01:27] you can't sin
[1:01:31] think about it no no he's not talking
[1:01:34] there about
[1:01:35] about the little things you do every day
[1:01:37] but there's something inside of you you
[1:01:38] can live
[1:01:39] so close to god so the devil don't know
[1:01:41] what to do with you
[1:01:44] you can have the earth under supreme
[1:01:46] control you say brother ben does anybody
[1:01:48] have that
[1:01:49] i believe we do at times
[1:01:53] and then at times we don't
[1:01:56] right like i'll say this it's been
[1:01:59] restored back to the earth
[1:02:03] right that's the goal that's where we're
[1:02:06] going
[1:02:06] but but see there's we still have a
[1:02:09] flesh body
[1:02:11] right and we got to remember that but so
[1:02:13] the fullness of adoption doesn't take
[1:02:15] place until the change of the body
[1:02:18] right and that's why i've told you
[1:02:20] before you don't look for anything great
[1:02:22] to happen before that but
[1:02:23] what are we looking for we're looking
[1:02:25] for things to continue to go on as they
[1:02:27] are
[1:02:27] until the coming of the lord right
[1:02:30] there's not going to be a great revival
[1:02:32] or something he said oh something
[1:02:33] great's going to happen no it's just
[1:02:34] going to be you
[1:02:35] becoming more and more like the word but
[1:02:37] you may not even recognize it
[1:02:41] right and and so and so we we want to be
[1:02:44] in revival we want to have all these
[1:02:46] things but
[1:02:47] but that's not what we're looking for
[1:02:48] we're looking for the coming of the lord
[1:02:50] we're looking for that fullness of the
[1:02:51] rapture
[1:02:52] that change of the body but now look
[1:02:56] so i don't want us to become unbalanced
[1:02:58] here but look what the word promises
[1:03:00] us he said god is the god of univ
[1:03:03] the universe but his son had this earth
[1:03:05] under his own
[1:03:07] control he could speak
[1:03:11] he could name
[1:03:15] all right now if i on this chair
[1:03:19] i can name it whatever i want to
[1:03:22] right my kids they spent half the time
[1:03:26] coming back on our trip writing down
[1:03:28] names for their future
[1:03:30] dog
[1:03:33] and it not gonna come to the old one
[1:03:34] dies but they don't believe that they're
[1:03:37] they're holding on to something
[1:03:39] different
[1:03:42] but but we already have a dog but they
[1:03:45] writing down dogs names
[1:03:46] why would they why would they name a dog
[1:03:48] it's theirs
[1:03:51] right you don't name somebody else's
[1:03:53] stuff at least i hope you don't
[1:03:55] if you do they can just change it or
[1:03:57] ignore it
[1:03:59] right you name your own stuff i name my
[1:04:01] own kids
[1:04:02] me and my wife we come up with the name
[1:04:04] why they're ours
[1:04:06] amen he could speak he could name
[1:04:10] in other words and we're going to go
[1:04:13] into this in a minute but
[1:04:14] he could actually identify
[1:04:18] what use that animal was going to have
[1:04:20] for him
[1:04:24] right he's gonna he's gonna look at that
[1:04:26] animal he said this is the part you're
[1:04:28] gonna play
[1:04:29] so maybe he looks takes a peacock or a
[1:04:31] beautiful bird and he looks at it and he
[1:04:32] says now you're
[1:04:34] by identifying by naming it it's giving
[1:04:36] you this name he's telling it
[1:04:38] this is what you're gonna do you're
[1:04:39] going to look so pretty
[1:04:41] you're going to be you're going to feel
[1:04:43] this part in the creation
[1:04:46] now watch he's naming it it's more than
[1:04:49] just
[1:04:50] god said well i'll let adam name him
[1:04:52] since he don't have nothing to do
[1:04:55] right but his naming showed his control
[1:04:57] over it
[1:05:00] right he could name he could say he
[1:05:02] could stop nature
[1:05:04] he could do anything he wanted to
[1:05:08] oh my but see when he did that what did
[1:05:10] he do he sold out for wisdom
[1:05:12] he lost his inheritance
[1:05:16] he thought it would be so good to know
[1:05:18] these things and when he
[1:05:20] found out what he was looking for he had
[1:05:23] lost
[1:05:24] everything he was
[1:05:29] now he could now adam could say let this
[1:05:34] mountain here be moved over there and it
[1:05:35] would do it
[1:05:38] and he didn't have to worry about it not
[1:05:39] happening it always worked
[1:05:41] the first time he did it it worked the
[1:05:43] second time the hundredth time
[1:05:45] he just spoke and it happened he didn't
[1:05:48] have nothing sitting there telling him
[1:05:49] well you you can't do this you're not
[1:05:51] good enough you
[1:05:52] you know that that's after the fall
[1:05:57] adam could do these things adam could
[1:05:59] say let this mountain here be moved over
[1:06:00] there and do it adam could say
[1:06:02] let this tree here be plucked up and
[1:06:03] planted over here it would do it
[1:06:05] listen he said for he had complete
[1:06:07] supreme control
[1:06:09] as a minor god under god our father
[1:06:12] because he was a son of god
[1:06:16] amen now
[1:06:20] i want you to know tonight that sons are
[1:06:23] not slaves
[1:06:25] they're not servants
[1:06:29] even ishmael and i go to this a lot but
[1:06:31] it struck me years ago
[1:06:33] he told ishmael he said told abraham he
[1:06:36] said because he is thy seed i'll make a
[1:06:38] great nation out of him
[1:06:41] because even the seed of a bondwoman who
[1:06:43] was a son of a slightly doubted promise
[1:06:46] would become a nation would become a
[1:06:48] leader would become
[1:06:50] have dominion not be a safe
[1:06:54] not the natural condition of abraham's
[1:06:56] seed to be slaves
[1:07:01] and if so if ishmael the son of a
[1:07:03] slightly doubted promise would have
[1:07:04] dominion
[1:07:04] how much more would the royal seed of
[1:07:06] abraham have dominion
[1:07:09] and i want us to really grasp this so
[1:07:11] maybe you're watching tonight or you'll
[1:07:12] be watching this some working and
[1:07:14] different things i know many
[1:07:16] can't come on wednesday night but this
[1:07:17] is so important to us i think as a
[1:07:19] church
[1:07:20] because when the word tells us to do
[1:07:22] something
[1:07:24] it's not setting a carrot on a stick out
[1:07:26] there just far enough ahead of you like
[1:07:27] a
[1:07:28] these greyhound races where they have a
[1:07:30] rabbit running in front where you can't
[1:07:32] reach it
[1:07:34] but you have the ability under the
[1:07:36] opening of the word to do
[1:07:37] to live the word right
[1:07:41] if god said i can have a family
[1:07:44] that's at peace if god said i can have a
[1:07:48] church
[1:07:49] where the gifts are in operation and the
[1:07:51] people love god
[1:07:52] and the presence of god is there if god
[1:07:54] said
[1:07:56] are you with me now if the word said i
[1:07:59] can have peace
[1:08:00] in spite of my trials if the word says i
[1:08:02] can have joy in my life if the word says
[1:08:04] i can have a
[1:08:05] godly marriage if the word said whatever
[1:08:06] it is if the word said it i have the
[1:08:09] right to step up and claim that
[1:08:14] i wasn't born to be a safe i was born to
[1:08:18] have dominion
[1:08:20] but so many times the devil throw up a
[1:08:22] little difficulty in our face we said oh
[1:08:23] see there i knew i couldn't do it
[1:08:29] well i must be the lord telling me
[1:08:32] someone told me years ago when i was
[1:08:34] moving to a certain place they said well
[1:08:35] if it's the lord it'll be easy where
[1:08:37] does that come from
[1:08:42] every time the people of god ever did
[1:08:44] anything it was met with difficulty
[1:08:47] moses marched down there under the
[1:08:49] anointing going down to egypt to take
[1:08:51] over got his wife and kids on a mule he
[1:08:53] marches into pharaoh's
[1:08:55] hall and he says let us go
[1:08:58] we want to go worship god and pharaoh
[1:09:00] says start making bricks without straw
[1:09:04] he just made it harder on him and many
[1:09:07] times we're met with difficulty to see
[1:09:09] what we'll do
[1:09:10] but you're a son of god we may get into
[1:09:13] this some more on sunday morning but
[1:09:16] in just a little bit different way but
[1:09:18] sons of god don't have to be scared of
[1:09:19] the devil
[1:09:21] you don't have to give in every time the
[1:09:22] devil keeps doing the same thing over
[1:09:24] and over and over again to keep you out
[1:09:26] of church
[1:09:27] the same thing over and over and over
[1:09:28] again to destroy your peace
[1:09:30] the same thing over and over and over
[1:09:32] again to destroy your health and you sit
[1:09:33] there say well he did it
[1:09:34] nothing i can do you're a son of god
[1:09:40] you're born to be a minor god on the
[1:09:41] earth
[1:09:44] right y'all going to wish i'd stayed in
[1:09:47] south carolina
[1:09:52] you see at times the seed of abraham
[1:09:55] ended up in slavery
[1:09:56] but they never stayed there
[1:10:00] look at joseph they sold him as a slave
[1:10:03] put him down in the slave pit
[1:10:05] everywhere he went he'd become the boss
[1:10:07] of the place
[1:10:09] i put him in potiphar's house he'd
[1:10:10] become the boss of the potiphar's house
[1:10:12] put him in the prison and become the
[1:10:14] boss of the prison
[1:10:16] amen brought him up to pharaoh's house
[1:10:18] to become the boss of pharaoh's house
[1:10:22] why he was the seed of abraham
[1:10:27] let's look at that a minute genesis 41
[1:10:28] 39 and pharaoh said to joseph for as
[1:10:31] much as god has showed thee all this
[1:10:33] there is none so discreet and wise as
[1:10:35] thou art
[1:10:36] thou shall be over my house and
[1:10:37] according unto listen
[1:10:39] according unto thy word
[1:10:43] so all my people be ruled i'm in the
[1:10:46] second chariot
[1:10:47] a man there's got the pharaoh's ring on
[1:10:48] his hand that man there that
[1:10:50] that's made it didn't we have the same
[1:10:53] difficulties
[1:10:55] didn't we face the same obstacles
[1:10:57] weren't we
[1:10:59] did we come in the same way but you
[1:11:00] don't have the same father
[1:11:03] you're not of the same seed
[1:11:08] i don't know about you i'm tired of the
[1:11:10] devil pushing me around
[1:11:14] the devil sit back there and say well
[1:11:16] you can't do it you can't do it church
[1:11:18] will never be nothing
[1:11:19] but i'm a seed of abraham your seed of
[1:11:21] abraham
[1:11:24] you can't have your health you'll you'll
[1:11:25] never you'll always be that way your
[1:11:27] parents were that way your dad did this
[1:11:28] and your mama did this and they
[1:11:30] they had this going for them and they
[1:11:31] had this run and just runs in the family
[1:11:33] but i'm a seed of abraham
[1:11:37] i'm not condemned to do what my dad did
[1:11:39] i'm not condemned to have the
[1:11:41] things in my body even naturally that my
[1:11:43] parents said
[1:11:44] i can break the cycle i'm a seed of
[1:11:46] abraham i don't have to wallow in
[1:11:48] depression
[1:11:50] i don't have to stay in the despair all
[1:11:52] the time
[1:11:53] but you don't understand my
[1:11:54] circumstances no you're a seed of
[1:11:56] abraham
[1:11:59] amen
[1:12:02] he says and pharaoh said to joseph i am
[1:12:04] pharaoh without thee shall no man lift
[1:12:06] up his hand or foot in all the land of
[1:12:07] egypt
[1:12:08] oh what about the royal seed here
[1:12:10] tonight
[1:12:12] hey man what we ought to be able to do
[1:12:16] i'm going back to the breach here and
[1:12:18] we'll just for a couple more paragraphs
[1:12:19] brother brown says now
[1:12:21] he says couldn't we stop here just a
[1:12:23] minute and get a real sermon
[1:12:26] he said oh then if the blood has
[1:12:28] cleansed it back
[1:12:30] what about now
[1:12:33] he said adam was the supreme god on the
[1:12:35] earth he said then if the blood has
[1:12:36] cleansed it back what about now
[1:12:38] he said see look what the son of god the
[1:12:41] second adam did
[1:12:44] see and said the works that i do show
[1:12:46] you also
[1:12:53] you see well i'm not going to get into
[1:12:56] that
[1:12:58] we'll talk about that sunday morning
[1:13:02] adam lost his inheritance the earth but
[1:13:05] the brahmana said not pass from his hand
[1:13:07] to the one he sold out to
[1:13:08] satan he sold his faith in god
[1:13:11] to satan's reasonings therefore his
[1:13:14] eternal life
[1:13:15] is right to the tree of life his rights
[1:13:17] to the earth belonged to him
[1:13:18] and he forfeited every bit to the hands
[1:13:20] of satan he passed it from his hand to
[1:13:22] satan
[1:13:23] he said therefore now it has been it
[1:13:26] returned and has been polluted
[1:13:28] and the seed of abraham now listen to
[1:13:31] this
[1:13:33] the seed of abraham has destroyed the
[1:13:36] inheritance
[1:13:37] that adam should have had he said that's
[1:13:40] the earth
[1:13:42] the seed of a the seed of adam rather
[1:13:45] the seed of adam has destroyed the
[1:13:48] inheritance that adam should have had
[1:13:49] now watch
[1:13:52] brother madam goes on and we'll talk
[1:13:54] about that in the future
[1:13:55] he goes on to talk about geronimo
[1:13:59] goes on to talk about the indians
[1:14:02] and what a terrible thing it was when
[1:14:04] the white man come down
[1:14:06] in tucson i kind of experienced
[1:14:08] something like that the other day
[1:14:09] when we were in chattanooga we looked
[1:14:12] out over lookout mountain you can see so
[1:14:14] far but you see the factories and things
[1:14:16] and the railroad and you think
[1:14:18] hundreds of men died in that place
[1:14:20] thousands of men
[1:14:21] died there in that place fighting for a
[1:14:24] little city of chattanooga
[1:14:25] because there was rail yards there and
[1:14:28] it scarred the natural beauty of the
[1:14:30] place you sit there and wonder
[1:14:32] what it must have been like when the
[1:14:34] cherokee was there because also running
[1:14:36] through there was a trail of tears
[1:14:38] running right through chattanooga and
[1:14:39] what it must have been like when the
[1:14:40] cherokee was here brother brandon stood
[1:14:42] in arizona he said what it must have
[1:14:43] been when the
[1:14:44] old squad would walk across with her
[1:14:46] papoose and he said there was no crime
[1:14:48] no
[1:14:49] no adultery nothing like that going on
[1:14:52] he said then all of a sudden here come
[1:14:54] here come the man with all of his
[1:14:56] knowledge
[1:14:57] he knows everything he's going to fix it
[1:14:59] he's going to make it good
[1:15:02] he just ends up killing himself
[1:15:10] now watch i want to dwell on this
[1:15:14] in genesis 2 19 this is where adam named
[1:15:18] the creatures the animals said
[1:15:21] out of the ground the lord god formed
[1:15:23] every beast of the field every fowl of
[1:15:24] the air and brought them into adam to
[1:15:26] see what he would call them
[1:15:28] whatsoever adam called every living
[1:15:30] creature
[1:15:32] that was the name thereof again this is
[1:15:35] more than just
[1:15:36] you know my kids naming their dolls in
[1:15:38] the room in the in their room right
[1:15:41] this is authority this is function
[1:15:46] this is assigning them their purpose
[1:15:49] claiming them for his work
[1:15:52] asserting his dominion over them
[1:15:57] i'm going to ask you this because it's
[1:15:58] what come to me
[1:16:00] as i was praying about these things when
[1:16:01] the things that you have dominion over
[1:16:05] come before you what do you name them
[1:16:10] now think about that for a moment what
[1:16:12] do you call it
[1:16:14] what do you call it i thought it was
[1:16:16] interesting that nobody knew what the
[1:16:17] chronovirus was till we gave it a name
[1:16:20] and now you just have to say it people
[1:16:21] are afraid of it
[1:16:24] right you go into a place you walk into
[1:16:26] a restaurant say covet
[1:16:33] but like yelling leprosy maybe hundreds
[1:16:35] of years ago
[1:16:37] everybody's gonna be scared be afraid
[1:16:40] it's got a name
[1:16:41] and and i showed you months ago brother
[1:16:44] branham talked about diseases he said
[1:16:45] they've always been in the earth he said
[1:16:47] but then we'll give it a name
[1:16:50] he said and when it just makes it that
[1:16:51] much stronger
[1:16:53] it's what it does it makes it that much
[1:16:54] more powerful because of the fear of it
[1:16:58] right and so but what do you name the
[1:17:01] things
[1:17:02] look we should have dominion over what
[1:17:05] we do
[1:17:07] over the way we live right
[1:17:11] and when i say we i mean the seed should
[1:17:13] have dominion the holy ghost the
[1:17:14] influence of the holy ghost in our life
[1:17:16] should have dominion we shouldn't be out
[1:17:17] here smoking drinking running around
[1:17:19] with women
[1:17:19] the seed should have dominion over that
[1:17:24] what do we call what we have dominion
[1:17:26] over
[1:17:28] you call it an overcomer or do you call
[1:17:31] it
[1:17:31] overcome right you're going to name it
[1:17:35] something
[1:17:36] what are you going to name it what what
[1:17:37] what do you call yourself
[1:17:40] what do you think what's your mindset
[1:17:42] about your family
[1:17:44] about your church
[1:17:48] well it's just a bunch of bunch of
[1:17:50] people don't know what they're doing
[1:17:52] well if i was in charge i'd show them
[1:17:54] what what to do you know
[1:17:56] i know all of you that think that are
[1:17:58] sitting at home tonight so i can say
[1:17:59] that
[1:18:02] god bless you those of you that are
[1:18:04] watching
[1:18:07] boy if i could just be the one in charge
[1:18:10] if i could be the deacon or the trustee
[1:18:11] or the
[1:18:12] but maybe that's so i don't know what
[1:18:15] did you name it
[1:18:18] what did you call it what did you say
[1:18:20] well it's always going to be this way
[1:18:23] well my family never did go to church on
[1:18:24] wednesday night well you named it
[1:18:29] my family does
[1:18:33] right what if your dad didn't that don't
[1:18:36] matter my family does
[1:18:42] what do you think about yourself what
[1:18:43] what what are you because we get in
[1:18:44] these patterns of thinking
[1:18:46] well i've always got to be depressed
[1:18:48] this is the way my family is
[1:18:49] this is the way i live this is my
[1:18:51] circumstances we subject and we look at
[1:18:54] the world by naming things
[1:18:56] right we we identify what something is
[1:18:58] that's a chair
[1:19:00] that's an organ that's a piano that
[1:19:02] tells me something about it
[1:19:04] right it identifies it names it what
[1:19:06] what do we name ourselves how are we
[1:19:07] identifying ourselves
[1:19:09] are we somebody are we a nobody
[1:19:15] church we got to quit letting the devil
[1:19:16] push us around
[1:19:19] adam got everything in his dominion gave
[1:19:21] it a name
[1:19:24] amen and nothing there could hurt him
[1:19:29] nothing there could tear him up nothing
[1:19:31] there see god gave you a dominion he
[1:19:33] gave you something
[1:19:34] a place to overcome in do you call it an
[1:19:36] overcoming
[1:19:37] family do you see it as something that's
[1:19:39] overcoming or have you let the devil
[1:19:40] push you back and what will always be
[1:19:42] this way
[1:19:43] we will never be any better than this i
[1:19:45] refuse to believe that
[1:19:47] because i tell you what one of these
[1:19:48] days i'm not going to be in this body
[1:19:51] i'm not only going to overcome my fears
[1:19:53] my anxieties
[1:19:54] my sicknesses my flesh that i live in
[1:19:57] one of these days i'm going to be in a
[1:19:58] different body altogether
[1:20:00] i'm not just going to overcome here on
[1:20:02] the earth one of these days i'm going to
[1:20:03] overcome completely
[1:20:05] how am i ever going to do that if i
[1:20:06] can't name it what it is
[1:20:08] i'm a seed of god i'm a child of the
[1:20:11] king i belong to the master
[1:20:16] amen whatever was in his
[1:20:19] dominion he named it
[1:20:23] mark 11 23 says for verily i send you
[1:20:26] whosoever shall say unto this mountain
[1:20:28] be thou removed be thou cast in the sea
[1:20:29] and shall not doubt in his heart
[1:20:31] and shall believe that those things
[1:20:32] which he says shall come to pass he
[1:20:34] shall have whatsoever he saith
[1:20:37] and we could go into how god showed that
[1:20:39] in this age in the spoken word
[1:20:41] when he spoke to hattie wright
[1:20:44] with a woman he said
[1:20:47] whatever you want you say it
[1:20:52] whatever you want you say it she claimed
[1:20:55] her dominion
[1:20:57] amen she claimed her sons
[1:21:01] he said well she was a widow woman how
[1:21:02] could she do that because
[1:21:04] you remember adam and eve in the
[1:21:05] beginning were the same
[1:21:08] they had the same potentials they were
[1:21:10] equal
[1:21:12] amen they weren't fighting over what to
[1:21:14] name what they were together on it
[1:21:18] you and christ are together in this you
[1:21:21] have a right to take a dominion no
[1:21:23] matter if you're a man woman
[1:21:24] boy or girl no matter what it is i have
[1:21:26] dominion over this
[1:21:30] but you don't know the boss at my job
[1:21:32] you're a son of god
[1:21:36] take dominion over it i don't mean to go
[1:21:39] act like a heathen
[1:21:41] that means you claim it and move on you
[1:21:43] don't worry about it
[1:21:51] a new young man excuse me for digressing
[1:21:54] but
[1:21:55] i'm at my conclusion actually which
[1:21:57] esther says doesn't mean anything anyway
[1:21:59] but
[1:22:03] a new young man that every time he go to
[1:22:05] work he went to church where we did
[1:22:07] he'd go to work for a while and he come
[1:22:09] to the pastor's office defeated
[1:22:11] after about two weeks he said there's
[1:22:13] just so many sinners at the workplace
[1:22:17] well do they pay you good oh they pay me
[1:22:19] good can you do the work yeah i can do
[1:22:21] the work but they just
[1:22:22] so many sinners i just can't listen to
[1:22:24] them all day
[1:22:26] well take dominion over that
[1:22:30] you're a son of god maybe you didn't get
[1:22:31] put in the school you wanted to get put
[1:22:33] in

[1:22:37] i wasn't thinking about that i was
[1:22:38] thinking about
[1:22:39] when you'll go to school but maybe when
[1:22:40] you're teaching maybe when you're doing
[1:22:41] a job whatever it is you don't get
[1:22:43] the place you wanted take dominion over
[1:22:45] the place you're in
[1:22:50] because god allowed you to be there for
[1:22:51] a reason i'm a son of god

[1:22:57] making
[1:22:58] electric engines or whatever it is that
[1:23:00] you do electric motors
[1:23:02] if i find myself on the line in the
[1:23:04] quality control department wherever i
[1:23:05] find
[1:23:06] myself i'm going to take dominion over
[1:23:07] that
[1:23:09] amen they say well you don't understand

[1:23:14] i got to work this job because nobody
[1:23:16] else will hire me

[1:23:20] you do what you let me tell you my life
[1:23:23] is a testimony and
[1:23:24] i think every one of you that have lived
[1:23:25] very long could testify tonight you put
[1:23:27] god first god will bless you
[1:23:30] take dominion over it say well i'm
[1:23:32] waiting on something to change
[1:23:34] take dominion over it
[1:23:37] step out in faith see what god will do
[1:23:40] i'm telling you to be stupid but if you
[1:23:42] have the confidence
[1:23:43] you pray until you have the confidence
[1:23:45] that is that it's what god wants you to
[1:23:47] do and then you just step
[1:23:48] out on that and then you won't have to
[1:23:51] do something stupid to do it
[1:23:53] it'll happen
[1:23:56] i wanted to
[1:23:59] show you some pictures we went to a
[1:24:02] plantation
[1:24:05] in south carolina i drug my kids away
[1:24:08] from all their happiness
[1:24:10] on a 90 degree day
[1:24:14] so we're going to take one day and go
[1:24:17] look at history
[1:24:19] so here brother gabe's amen back there
[1:24:24] we went to a plantation house in south
[1:24:26] carolina
[1:24:27] and beautiful home beautiful show that
[1:24:30] next picture
[1:24:33] this is a picture of a tree that george
[1:24:36] washington
[1:24:37] you know george washington was a man
[1:24:38] under authority
[1:24:40] what he said went 230 years ago george
[1:24:44] washington stood in that spot
[1:24:46] and this woman who owned the house was
[1:24:48] going to cut down that tree
[1:24:50] and he said she said my view would be
[1:24:52] better without the tree don't you think
[1:24:53] so he said no ma'am he said you should
[1:24:54] leave it up
[1:24:56] so she left it up and so they call it
[1:24:58] the george washington tree
[1:25:01] and that tree was there but you'll
[1:25:03] notice there's a bell in the tree if you
[1:25:04] can see it there's a bell right in the
[1:25:05] middle of that tree
[1:25:07] it was a slave bell that's what they
[1:25:10] used to call the slaves
[1:25:12] and it astonished me because there were
[1:25:14] 300
[1:25:15] slaves on a plantation that times
[1:25:18] brother joe had one person
[1:25:20] one white person living on it in the
[1:25:23] middle of
[1:25:23] nowhere in fact when they started you
[1:25:26] had to take a boat go in the ocean
[1:25:28] come down two rivers to get there
[1:25:32] you couldn't even get there by road
[1:25:36] and so but whenever they rang that bell
[1:25:38] all the slaves would come
[1:25:42] and it just astounded me but alex i
[1:25:44] thought why
[1:25:48] they were used to it so that next
[1:25:52] picture they had inside
[1:25:56] and they showed us the all the the rooms
[1:25:58] and the architecture and things and they
[1:25:59] had this
[1:26:00] great big ballroom probably as big as
[1:26:02] this church and had a great big ceiling
[1:26:04] and it was a ballroom where they threw a
[1:26:06] party for george washington when he come
[1:26:07] to visit
[1:26:08] and they showed all the history of it
[1:26:10] and all those things and
[1:26:12] and it had a plaque on the wall it
[1:26:14] showed the names of the enslaved i know
[1:26:16] you can't read those names but i've got
[1:26:17] some of the names that i i went and did
[1:26:19] some research and pulled off of there
[1:26:22] but what that is is generations of
[1:26:23] enslaved people who
[1:26:25] labored at those properties for the
[1:26:27] different owners that were there
[1:26:28] at hampton plantation and where they get
[1:26:32] this is from letters that they would
[1:26:33] write and but mostly from wheels they
[1:26:36] would leave the slaves to the next
[1:26:38] generation
[1:26:39] so they had to when when they left the
[1:26:41] slaves they had to identify them
[1:26:43] give them a name and give them a value
[1:26:50] now go to that next slide there's some
[1:26:53] just a few of the names
[1:26:55] and they're put together by by family
[1:26:58] some of them belfast
[1:26:59] five that's five dollars that's what he
[1:27:02] was worth in the wheel old guy won
[1:27:06] i won't single him out at all
[1:27:09] he's worth a dollar and the guy told us
[1:27:13] she said that
[1:27:14] that's because he couldn't do any work a
[1:27:16] baby was actually worth a lot
[1:27:18] because it had a potential of a lifetime
[1:27:20] of slavery
[1:27:23] i'll tell you what we don't have
[1:27:25] anything to be proud of
[1:27:30] robin 90. where do you think they got
[1:27:32] these names they didn't bring these
[1:27:34] names from africa
[1:27:38] they named them master named them
[1:27:43] grace 30 lucy 80 diana 50
[1:27:47] primus 100 sam 60 60 bucks for the sam
[1:27:52] solomon's 70 it shows the price for the
[1:27:55] family

[1:27:58] slide
[1:28:01] mary and bob and nick and phyllis
[1:28:04] old bess
[1:28:09] you imagine old guy didn't bother to
[1:28:10] give him much of a name
[1:28:13] old guy it's only worth a dollar
[1:28:18] he comes up there and walks because i'm
[1:28:20] not worth much
[1:28:23] just kind of hangs out around the
[1:28:24] plantation tries to look busy
[1:28:27] oh best maybe she can't hardly move they
[1:28:30] only keep her around like they would an
[1:28:31] old dog
[1:28:35] big sharper 20 prince 30 baker 80 bounce
[1:28:38] 70. i'd like to meet him
[1:28:44] mark's worth fifty fifty bucks
[1:28:51] effie 40 send to five susanna one
[1:28:56] it goes on sharp jonathan bella 500
[1:28:58] peter 570 bucks
[1:29:01] there's peter back there must've been a
[1:29:03] pretty good slave
[1:29:06] 300 of them on the plantation at once
[1:29:10] just a few of them could have come in
[1:29:11] and taken over they say that the slave
[1:29:13] owners back then were
[1:29:14] lived in mortal fear of a slave revolt
[1:29:17] because they knew they couldn't win it
[1:29:22] so they controlled information they made
[1:29:24] a slave bible
[1:29:26] that took out all the parts about
[1:29:28] freedom
[1:29:32] oh church don't you realize what the
[1:29:34] devil wants to do
[1:29:36] he wants to stick you out on the porch
[1:29:38] somewhere label you as old guy
[1:29:40] put you out there for a dollar
[1:29:44] put you out there a worthless preacher a
[1:29:46] worthless woman
[1:29:48] put you out there a dollar 50 cents
[1:29:50] you're not worth nothing
[1:29:52] he assigns you a name and a value and
[1:29:53] you sit back and take it
[1:29:58] but the opening of the word came to show
[1:30:00] us you're worth something
[1:30:06] i wasn't found in the will of a slave
[1:30:08] owner
[1:30:09] but my name was found in the will
[1:30:13] amen the one who owned the cattle on a
[1:30:17] thousand deals
[1:30:22] oh church i saw this all i could do to
[1:30:25] keep from crying right there i thought
[1:30:27] oh god
[1:30:28] how could people keep themselves under
[1:30:30] that slavery how could they allow it
[1:30:32] but that's just all they knew you know
[1:30:34] what happened
[1:30:36] during the civil war that man left the
[1:30:39] plantation
[1:30:40] one man left the plantation there was no
[1:30:43] one there
[1:30:44] for the entirety of the civil war
[1:30:47] no one to rule this plantation no one to
[1:30:50] run the things no one to make the slaves
[1:30:52] do anything
[1:30:53] he came back at the end of the civil war
[1:30:55] he lived through it you know what
[1:30:56] happened
[1:30:57] all the slaves were still there
[1:31:04] they didn't know what to do
[1:31:07] we drove past some of the houses of the
[1:31:09] descendants of those same slaves
[1:31:14] still there
[1:31:18] 150 years later
[1:31:21] why you forgive me for taking my time
[1:31:24] tonight and going through this but it
[1:31:26] just meant so much to me
[1:31:28] why are they still there there's just
[1:31:30] something about it they're still under
[1:31:31] the dominion
[1:31:33] of that plantation still under the
[1:31:36] mindset of that plantation
[1:31:37] even after all these years still
[1:31:40] trying to make a living for somebody
[1:31:42] else
[1:31:44] oh god what about you you weren't made
[1:31:48] to be a slave
[1:31:49] none of god's sons and daughters were
[1:31:51] made to be slaves
[1:31:52] you weren't born to be slaves yet you
[1:31:56] see
[1:31:56] people living year after year generation
[1:31:59] after generation
[1:32:00] living in generational sin living in a
[1:32:02] generational mindset we have to do this
[1:32:04] because mom and dad did it we have to do
[1:32:06] this because
[1:32:07] just the way the church always did it
[1:32:08] this way everybody else always did it we
[1:32:10] don't have to be that way anymore
[1:32:13] you're not made to be that way you don't
[1:32:15] have to live on the plantation
[1:32:17] you don't have to be just you say well
[1:32:18] you didn't know my mom you didn't know

[1:32:49] to fulfill in your life
[1:32:53] and you know those things that are
[1:32:54] resurrected it's those things which

[1:33:06] fulfill the purpose of god don't let the
[1:33:07] devil

[1:33:10] idea some little thing that's off and
[1:33:11] you just grab a hold of it and say well

[1:33:17] to give in to that
[1:33:20] your chains can be let loose
[1:33:23] i i'm not a fiery enough preacher
[1:33:24] somebody could take this and really
[1:33:26] preach it but i tell you what
[1:33:27] i want you to think about it what do you
[1:33:30] do that you wouldn't have to do
[1:33:33] don't tell me you have to do something
[1:33:35] that's not in the word
