just we'll go ahead and change the order of the service over to our pastor brother Ben amen Lord prepare me key of G and this is what we come to do to hear from him this morning Amen on this Mother's

morning God bless you and we really appreciate our mothers here in the church special my mother's here today and it's okay to have her with us on a weekly basis and well and others I have three children and we couldn't do without him couldn't we couldn't do without you so we're thankful for that for moms and we're going to Loosely associate this this morning to the mother's day but but we're thankful for our moms and then uh it's over Virginia are in the hospital right now and uh told him this church for much but he claimed he wasn't going to miss church for this baby but the baby had other ideas so do you get trouble when you start playing things like that he uh if the baby's born today then that would be a wonderful Mother's Day gift for him and then today is my wife's birthday so happy birthday to Sister Brittany thank you [Applause] a long time we did all a lot of the cleaning and a lot of the a lot of the food and a lot of the Sunday school and different things and some of the rest of you stepped under those things but but my wife just putting up with me is a big deal and graceful somebody said amen too loudly in my life and that is our anniversary so and Esther's birthday was yesterday editor's a big help here and she's all my kids working in church we all just work for you all so yeah we're glad to do it the body of Christ but Esther's birthday she's 14 now and Peter's 16 and all this week and Brittany today and then but Joe waite's having a birthday this week aren't you God bless you brother Joe thankful for all the brother Joe does for the church as well so many birthdays right now my goodness sister Luella I think is having or had a birthday or haven't yesterday so that's a good day to be born on the same day as as Esther so so we're thankful for you too and God bless you all you know you can't have a church without people if you um Wednesday night we had a little bit different we've been preaching on the gifts I did something a little bit different but I noticed how much it raised the faith of the people Wednesday night to watch that little clip of of deep cloth to the deep and it'd be good if you haven't watched that or you weren't here to go back and watch that and God did something in our day and we just watched a clip of that at the end of the service it just seems like people's Faith was raised we believe he's still the same God today the same yesterday today and forever but it just shows us that God that he's present in our day that the word is a discerner of the thoughts and Tents of the heart so if you didn't get a chance to watch that go back and watch that we're going to get to uh tongues and interpretation as the last of the gifts that we'll get to but then we're uh I may I may in between I may drop in uh there's something called helps and governments is what Paul calls it helps in governments and you can study on that and look that up in the scriptures and I may be dealing with that first because we all want to be a help don't we to the body of Christ that's why we're here is to be a help and so it's such a you know I know that you all are but we want to be the best help in the best place that we can be in and the best way to do that is to pray and ask God God how can I serve the people because that's what we do we don't serve ourselves we're not in the position that we're in I'm not the pastor because it it feels good to be the pastor or to stroke my ego or to make to make make me something I'm here because I believe God wanted me to be and and you wanted me to be and so I'm here to serve you and every one of the officers in the church and all of them volunteers they're here to serve you and if we can't serve you in a position we're in we ought to go do something else because that's should be our goal is to serve the people and and so we'll be talking about that maybe on Wednesday night amen the Lord blessed you this morning let's stand together we'll read the word thank you for bearing with me do you love the Lord this morning it's good to be here on a on a Sunday morning several of the folks are gone with their mothers I I can't begrudge on that I know what a blessing it is for for me to worship with my mother and someone who said the best gift you could give your mother is to go with her and be with her there on Mother's Day and I know in the past many of you have had family with you and today some are traveling to be with their mother so we're thankful they were able to do that Genesis chapter 29 and verse 35 I just want to take a little bit of a unique thought at least to me but this will begin begin to weigh heavily on me this week while we were with the teenagers this week in Branson and it just the Lord just kept dealing with me on this thought so I trust it'll be a blessing to you Genesis 29 35 and she conceived again and bear a son and she said now will I praise the Lord what a Time during childbirth said now will I praise the Lord therefore she called his name Judah and left bearing let's bow our heads together maybe you have a special need you'd like to make known by wave uplifted hand I know God sees every one of those needs today Heavenly Father Lord I think especially of our mothers today and the battles that they fought and the things that they've been through Lord and we want to reward them today and honor them Lord maybe there would be a need on a mother's heart today that you just really Lord there's just something you're dealing with them about or some need that they have I pray you'd meet that need today especially for them but Lord for all of us there's others Lord maybe have a serious need of some kind in their body or in their mind or with their finances Whatever It Is God your your Jehovah Jireh you're still the same God Lord that provided a lamb for Abraham a ram for Abraham oh God we believe that you're still Jehovah Jireh you're still a provider today would you provide peace and comfort and strength Lord whatever we have need of God the same God that moved Lord and those meetings and the same power that that that Open the Eyes of the Blind and raised the dead healed the same that same power that we've seen in our lives that's transformed us from what we were to what we are today Lord we believe that power is still here today and is still able to move and so we pray that you would do that meet every need Lord even those needs that we don't realize that we have I pray you'd meet those today or change our attitudes change our thoughts move us in the right direction or that we should be in we pray and we'll ask it in the name of the precious Lord Jesus amen God bless you you can be seated whenever we think of Mother's Day we think of flowers we think of a nice meal we think of doing something nice for our mothers if they're living and if they've passed away we wish that we could we like to think of motherhood as very proper and very dignified mother doesn't make any mistakes mother doesn't doesn't have at least mine didn't you know and mother doesn't have any issues you know mother's always got the answers mom always knows what to say but the truth is that motherhood is very messy It's associated from the beginning with sorrow and in Genesis 3 16 he says to the woman he said I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception in sorrow Thou shalt bring forth children thy desire shall be thy husband he shall rule over thee there's two words used for sorrow there which seem to mean physical and mental pain the first one means the pain or the toil of travail and the second one includes the idea of hurt of mind and I like to think that the physical pain comes early but the mental pain comes later I don't know about y'all boy you're quiet this morning I I don't know much about you all but I'll say this that I caused most of the mental pain to my mother after I was born and after the childbirth and as I got older and I got old enough to do my own thing that's when the mental anxiety came in the mental part of it and so that's the two parts that it's it's painful to be a mother it sometimes it hurts sometimes there's trouble sometimes things don't go like what you planned for them to go and yet you're still a mother you're you're still a a person that God's called to that particular office and I think any of those of you who are not mothers today would say Amen to that as well that you you are called to a particular thing a particular office of particular place in life and and that place requires you to put up with some amount of pain with some amount of suffering with some amount of maybe not to the extent that a mother does but but to some amount of uh hardship and yet you stand there and and you stand in your position anyway aren't you glad God can have people that'll stand in spite of suffering in spite of pain and everything else and still do what God called them to do still be what God called them to be brother Branham taught us that Israel's wives That's Jacob's wives when they gave birth to the 12 Patriarchs these mothers when they were having a baby and the baby was being born and them groaning so I didn't know Virginia would be in labor this morning so but I put this together but the babies being born them groaning the groans that they came out and he said he actually named those boys so I'm actually rather glad that my mother didn't name me ahead of time and I'm assumed that she did and didn't name me during that because sometimes that may not be very good but he said the the very groans that they give signify the nature of the child and the place they'd make their final resting place he said every groan under the power of the Holy Ghost now we think of being under the power of the Holy Ghost as being in a great service feeling the presence of God and that's true we we experience the power of the Holy Ghost everybody's dancing everybody's shouting but brother Brown said these mothers when they were experiencing the pain of childbirth were actually under the power of the Holy Ghost during that time do you realize when you're a real a real mother you're under the power of the Holy Ghost to be able to do that and and to be that if you're a real if you're a real Christian if you're a real Deacon or a trustee or a song leader or whatever it is that you do if you're a real dad in the home or working when you work you're under the power of the Holy Ghost you may not feel it but there's inspiration that comes to you to do the job that you were called to do and that's what we need see anointing is not just for running and shouting although we want my cup spills over but first it's got to be full and there's got to be an anoint an anointing is just an empowerment that allows you to do something and so we don't blow it all out the whistle but we it's got to put some uh some movement in the wheels so that we're able to move on down the track and that's where we want to be today so there's got to be an anointing to do the job that God called you to do so these mothers were under the power of the Holy Ghost when they were giving birth inspiration came and brother Branham again he said did you know that these portions how Joshua lauded them in Palestine was given by inspiration and those Hebrew mothers of those Patriarchs when the baby was coming forth and her and travailing pain to deliver the child she uttered the very spot that those Patriarchs would settle down and be at the last days so they actually through their pain through the through the travail through the struggle let me tell you that's when inspiration really strikes you that's when the power of the Holy Ghost is really on you it's in the painful times it's in the struggle it's in the times when you don't seem like you can't hardly make it those are the times God is moving thank you brother Robert Smith's been struggling in his health lately and and I've been telling him that that's just the part of the struggle and just part of life that we have to go through God's doing something God's moving in some way and you don't understand it but there's inspiration that comes during those times those are the times that God can really get through to you he can really talk to you it's a time when you're hurting the time when you're in pain the time when there's everything seems like it's falling apart but he's birthing something in your life don't you realize this whole world that we live in this fall in the park this whole this whole world is is shaking it's trembling it's groaning in birth pains we're groaning waiting to be closed upon there's a groaning that's going on but it's during this time that a message comes inspiration come to our day Hallelujah and a child will be delivered so they uttered the spot the Patriarchs would settle down in now we know that the Redeemer came the Redeemer would come through the seed of the woman and this is why Paul mentions that the woman will be saved in childbearing it doesn't mean like the Catholics believe that you'd be saved just by having more and more children and uh brother Joel is listening it means you'll be saved in childbearing that somehow through all the children that were born down through time there would be one born through all the children that would be born from the very beginning of time there was one that came that would be salvation and so early on they didn't understand all the all the ins and outs of it but they just knew the promises of Genesis 3 Genesis 3 15. it says I will put enmity between thee and the woman between thy seed and her seed it shall Bruce the head thou shall Bruce his heel so they knew there had to be a woman's seed that would bruise the head of the serpent and so now they knew that only by having children could they recognize could they uh could they allow that to come so each one of these Patriarchs they wanted they wanted to have children and so now Jacob comes along and Abraham had come along and God had promised him it isn't it isn't it strange that so many of the biblical women struggled with infertility with the inability to have children and they were Barren why why is it says so many of them because Satan wanted to keep that child from being born he was trying so hard and God would allow it in fact the scripture doesn't even attribute it to Satan at all but it says God closed the womb of Sarah and God closed the womb of of Rachel and different ones that their womb was closed because God allowed it to be but that was the way that the Redeemer was going to come and the good thing about it is you know sometimes we attribute so much to Satan but they didn't know who it would come through and neither did Satan uh Satan didn't know you realize Satan didn't know the day you were going to be born again he didn't know that service he didn't know the time it was a mystery hidden in God God knew the day that you would come to him the day that you would come to your senses today you would recognize I'm not the son of of Charles and Ella Brandon as brother Brandon put it but I'm the son of I'm a Son of God you might say I'm a daughter of God that day was a mystery that God had in his mind but yet the world didn't know it and Satan didn't know it because if he knew it he would do everything he couldn't have stopped it so what does he do he tries to stop like he did he tried to kill the children under two years of age he tries to stop meanings from happening he tries to stop the service from being in the right atmosphere are you with me now he tries to stop everything from happening because he doesn't know when you might be born when your children might be born when that last one comes in he knows what's going to happen he just don't know when so being who he is he wants to do everything he can to stop it so Jacob come along and the promise had been narrowed down to his family right so it had been it had just been a promise that hung out there and then God called Abraham and now Abraham is singled out it's going to be your seed and then from there he singles out Isaac instead of Ishmael and from there he narrows it on down and he he signals out or or he singles out to Jacob instead of Esau and even though they were both born of the same parents so it had been narrowed down to Jacob's family that were chosen by God and so there was a problem though Jacob had to get married so in order for Jacob to uh to produce he couldn't do it on his own he had to have a bride and so now he would get married and and so in Genesis 28 1 Isaac called Jacob and blessed him and charged him instead of him thou I shall not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan verse 2 arise go to Pat and arum to the house of Bethel the mother's father take thee away from this of the daughters of Laban thy mother's brother so he wanted him to marry someone who was raised like he was someone who was a Believer and I'm sure that Jacob had heard the love story of what it was to be Isaac's uh or to be Isaac's son I'm sure he'd heard Isaac and Rebecca's Love Story many times he'd heard how the how the Easter had gone down into the well and and he'd knelt down and he prayed and and pretty soon here come Rebecca out to the well and it was just the one the very one to come out to the well and fed the uh fed the camels that were there was the very one that God Called to be his wife and I'm sure Jacob had great ideas in his mind well this is exactly what God's going to do for me it yet you realize God deals with every generation on their own right he deals with them on their own he's still the same God but he deals with them on their own because he may have something different see there's going to be a generation that's going to take a Rapture there's going to be a people that's going to take a Rapture so he deals with us on her own in our own generation every every age every generation has to have their own Revival and so now Jacob's got to go through his own Revival and so we know the story of how he had the vision of of the uh of the Angels ascending and descending on the ladder to heaven and so he's in a real spiritual time of his life and he goes down to find uh his wife and when he went down he found that here come a Rachel and Rachel came out he thought he might have thought my boy this is wonderful just like what happened to Mom and Dad then at verse 16 but it says Laban had two daughters the name of the Elder was Leah the name of the younger was Rachel and Leah was tender-eyed what that means is it her eyes were dull and the way that they looked at how pretty a woman was the way they determined that in the in the ancient times was the eyes it was the eyes that whether or not that's why in so many ancient world in the Eastern World they would color their eyes with something trying to make them stand out because the eyes were seen as the most beautiful part of a woman and so now Leah was tenderized or that what means weak eyed but Rachel was beautiful and well favored his eyes were dull she was plain but Rachel had a beautiful face and form and I want you to notice saying you all know the story but I want you to notice that Leah never asked for any of it she did not go out there with the intention of snaring Jacob she didn't go out with the intention of usurping her sister she's just following orders she's not trying to deceive Jacob that's her father Laban so evidently Laban realizes that he he wants to keep Jacob around because Jacob wherever a Son of God his people are blessed do you believe that today forever a Son of God his people are blessed I believe that's true on the job I believe that's true in the community wherever children of God are people are blessed I had a pastor tell me one time and it's true he said your boss will be blessed because he employed you why because you're a son of God amen your sons and daughters are the king wherever you go because of the way you carry yourself because of the way you you're taught and the way that you the way that you work and everything that you do it causes the people around you to be blessed so Laban says I want to be blessed so so he thinks you know and these guys man you talk about politics today you don't hold a candle what these guys did right I mean this is pretty bad I don't I don't know if I can think of anything else worse to do to your daughter and to use her as a pawn to cause her to be married to someone she doesn't like and he doesn't like her and if he used her as a pawn and deceitfully and there wasn't up front with Jacob because he knew Jacob would never stand for it because Jacob loved Rachel and so Jacob ends up married to Leah completely by mistake on his part he doesn't intend to be married to her he doesn't love her and I feel bad for Leah most in that situation she was a victim now a lot of people claim to be victims today but Leah actually was now he he loved Rachel more than he did Leah but but you notice if you go read the story and not have time to read it all today because it's not where I'm going but if you go back and read the story you'll find Jacob forgot to do something he went down the same way that Eliezer did to find find Rebecca here Jacob goes down to find his wife and his wife came Rachel came out but Jacob neglected to pray Ellie easer got down on his knees and said Lord I won't be successful unless you make me successful but Jacob neglected to pray before he decided that he loved Rachel now and listen this is important so he ended up with two wives because he didn't pray and it just proves again that polygamy was not God's intended purpose for man Genesis 29 31 the Bible says when when the Lord saw you believe God sees you today when the Lord saw that Leah was hated he opened her womb but Rachel was barren and Leah conceived and bear a son and she called his name Reuben for she said surely the Lord hath looked upon my Affliction now therefore my husband will love me I I want to stop here for just a moment Jacob was wrong in how he dealt with his family Jacob has bad family problems and you can go find that yeah but Jacob was also a prophet of God a patriarch a man who saw dreams and had Supernatural events in their life whenever somebody comes to you and tells you because of the supernatural in their life you should imitate them in all of these ways you shouldn't listen to that you don't imitate men you imitate the word right you imitate the word because it's because a person can move in a supernatural realm doesn't mean he makes good decisions at home now Jacob didn't make good decisions at home and at times Isaac didn't because brother Brown said God doesn't show us prophets everything he lets them make decisions but Jacob didn't either and so now she says now therefore my husband will love me you see the the pain in this the sorrow not just the physical pain of childbirth but she's she's crying out she has these children but brother Branham calls it a prophecy he says the Holy Ghost moved on her but now she's crying out in the pain of all that she had been through and she says now my husband will love me she conceived again and bear a son and said because the Lord has heard that I was hated he had therefore given me this son also she called his name Simeon she conceived again and bear a son and said now this time because the relationship didn't change with Reuben and the relationship didn't change with Simeon she said surely this time when my husband be joined unto me because I had borne him three sons therefore was his name called Levi and she conceived again and bear his son I through all of this through all the pain through all the struggle through all the worry y'all have experienced that in your lives I'm sure you mothers could testify today I've experienced pain I've experienced worry I've experienced anxiety I've been at times where I didn't know if anybody loved me I've experienced times in my life someone can say Amen this morning I've experienced times in my life when the struggle was real and the trouble was out there and my body wasn't cooperating and and my relationships weren't cooperating but she reached down now at the fourth time and there was such an inspiration hit her and she said now I will praise the Lord oh I want to tell you this morning we don't have our rose-colored glasses on I realize that being a mom in this day and age is a hard thing I realized that that going to church is a hard day in this day and age I realize being a message but being the bride is not necessarily just a time when everything's all Rosy and things there's you got a struggle You Gotta Fight You Gotta battle in the world that you live you're fighting spiritual wickedness in high places you're fighting a government that's going crazy you're fighting a spiritual warfare out here the the world is just going further and further and further into darkness you're trying to keep sanity in your home you're trying to keep sanity in the church you're trying to trying to understand people who are fallible people with sticky natures and you're dealing with all of this and in the midst of that when inspiration really strikes oh my God he said now I'll praise the Lord Hallelujah the situation hasn't changed Jacob never did get to where he loved Leah he never did treat her appropriately oh my never did as far as we know ever do what he should have done with this family oh my every time he'd come back and have a great experience with God he'd backside he never did on I thank God for the keeping power of the Holy Ghost today because that's the only thing that keeps us sir we'd be just like Jacob we'd go from spiritual experience down into the gutter spiritual experience down into the gutter but we don't just visit with the Holy Ghost he dwells in US we're not just inspired by the Holy Ghost he actually lives on the inside so now but Jacob had such a he was up and he was down and and Leah was never she felt unloved by her husband she was used by her father unloved by her husband but yet she found a way to praise all that ought to be our desire today Lord through all the pain through all the struggle through all the Brokenness of life let me find a way to praise hmm she didn't know it but she had prophesied through her pain Judah will be praised some of you mothers might have had a hard life things might not have worked out like you thought they would but when you praise the Lord in spite of that when you praise the Lord I should say because of that you say I wish things would have been different but you couldn't praise him like you do now if things had all been easy you couldn't worship him like are you hearing me today I hope I'm I hope I'm preaching to somebody today and there's somebody that's gone through I've been through time but if I hadn't been through the sticky places if I hadn't been through the desert I couldn't appreciate a good rain if I hadn't experienced some of the things in my life if I hadn't done some dumb things made some bad decisions but at any I wouldn't be where I'm at today I wouldn't be the person that I am today and I'm sure I'll make some in the future I'm sure I'll do some dumb thing make some bad decisions but I'll say right now in this place that I'm at in spite of all of it I will praise the Lord I will praise the Lord what was it it was a prophecy of Praise through pain a prophecy of Praise through hardship through toil through Labor [Music] Hallelujah and God chose Leah's son she was the unfavored one the overlooked one but God chose her son not Rachel's to be the natural bloodline of the Redeemer she didn't realize it this was the son they were looking for not the son but this was the bloodline you understand this would be the natural Seed of Abraham would come through Judah it doesn't make any sense not the oldest child but what is it she had learned through her pain and through her struggle and somehow the prophecy that come out of that Brokenness listen there's nothing that smells so sweet as a flower that's been crushed what is that's where you get perfume from it's from afar look at the life of Jesus he he had to express himself as being crushed by by God himself God put him there on the cross God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son God put him there on the cross and because of that he was crushed for you and I and the sweetest smell the sweetest perfume come out of his life that's what pain does see God chose Leah's son pain produced a mother's prophecy but I want you to understand today that what you prophesy over your children depends on your reaction to the pain because you prophesy over your children you realize that brother Branham I didn't bring all the quotes and things this morning but brother Brandon said a mother is a preacher she don't have a right to stand behind the pulpit but she's a preacher to her children he said there's five gospels Matthew Mark Luke John and mother right that that Fifth Gospel is the mother she's the one that gets them first she's the one that raises them up and that's why you see like things like sister Betty sitting here with brother Robbie because a mother worked and raised a child to come to the house of God some of you can say Amen to that today the mother gets them first and before even as dads we can get through to them as far as teaching and leading a mother is there to be able to teach them but it's not so much what you say but but it's your reaction to the events that go on in your life because you can react in a way it says oh woe is me I'm unloved nobody likes me nobody cares about me or you can react in such a way says I will praise the Lord I will praise the Lord I've been through pain but I will praise the Lord I've had struggles but I will praise the Lord my relationships haven't all worked out my you'd be surprised what your parents have been through if you really knew everything your parents had been through some of you might be surprised some of you wouldn't be maybe you know some of the things your parents went through because now you're experiencing some of those things yourself but when you get in trouble when you get in pain when you get when you get in the worst time of your life it produces something a prophecy then God knew that Leah God chose Leah for Jacob well how do you know because that's the one he ended up with Jacob chose Rachel and God used that too but the perfect will of God in this situation was not polygamy which never is Jacob and Leah think about it and Rachel had children too and God allowed his perfect will or his permissive will to work to glorify his perfect will out of her come Joseph and Benjamin but now this pain produced the prophecy now Rachel also named children and she named Joseph and then when she's having trouble in childbirth and in Genesis 35 16 it says Rachel travailed and had hard labor and this is when they journeyed from Bethel and I've spoken to you on that before whenever Jacob Journeys from Bethel it means he's leaving the house of God he always gets in trouble and now Rachel begins to be in hard labor and it came to pass when she was in hard labor that the Midwife said unto her fear not Thou shalt have this son also and it came to pass as her soul was in departing that she called his name benoni son of my sorrow but his father called him Benjamin Benjamin in the Hebrew which is which is son of my right hand his father had to change the name knowing that benoni would Mark him as a child of Sorrow because that's the time of life that she's going through now now remember when as we live that we have the opportunity to prophesy by the lives that we live over our children and our reaction to the pain that's going on in our life is what is what brings a prophecy out of our life that we can see that our children can see and they can be influenced by to be a certain thing think about it for a minute The Knowing son of my sorrow he had to change his name because the prophecy was one of Sorrow Rachel died a pillar was placed over a grave Jacob loved her to the end but when Jacob was dying he called his children in for a blessing and when he called them in he spoke to Judah he said he spoke to the others first and ordered that they were born in and he speaks to Judy he said Judah Thou Art he whom thy Brethren shall praise thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies thy father's children shall bow down before thee Judah is a lion's whelp from the prey my son Thou Art gone up he stooped down he couched as a lion as an old lion who shall Rouse him up the scepter shall not depart from Judah nor a lawgiver from between his feet until Shiloh come and unto him shall the Gathering of the people be all she did was prophesy praise and on now now it's beginning to realize that this would be the kingly line this would be the bloodline of the king the son of David he couldn't be a son of David unless he was the lion of the tribe of Judah Hallelujah so now this is him this is the bloodline and again so Rachel would not be in the bloodline of the Messiah Leah would be I don't want you to understand today I want you to be discouraged by your present or your current situation because there's always going to be pain and sometimes it's just simple things like trying to get your kids all in church and a lot of the little ones aren't here this morning but some of them are my mother texted me this morning and said I'm not used to getting three kids ready for church when Mom had eight kids but you lose it at some point I guess you know it's difficult to get kids ready for church but just even in that difficulty your kids get to see you come to church anyway and they see you in church when the spirit of the Lord begins to move and you raise your hand and a tear runs down you may not be running and jumping all over the place unless you're chasing kids but you you may not be running and jumping all over the place but the kids see the attitude that you take towards the pain are you hearing me today let's see how you stand for the gospel you stand for the message even though many leave and many don't do that but they see the stand that you take and they see that it becomes a prophecy of praise Hallelujah and later on it begins to develop in their life and what they'll be but it'll always it started with a mother's prophecy Rachel got a pillar but Leah was buried with Jacob this is so so neat I think so ironic Genesis 49 29. he says he charged him he's dying now Jacob is dying he said unto them I am to be gathered unto my people my father's in the cave that is in the field of Ephraim the hittite in the cave that is in the field of macpila which is before memory in the land of Canaan which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the hittite for a possession of a burying place now what was it that field was bought for the purpose of Resurrection because Abraham recognized job had been buried there right and because job had been buried there he knew there was a resurrection taking place in that land so Jacob said bury me in the land of the Resurrection Hallelujah in the cave of macpila and there they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife there they buried Isaac and Rebecca his wife notice the couples as they're buried together because they'll come up together and there I buried Leah Rachel may have had a bigger Memorial in this life and Rachel may not have been a bad person she she wasn't but but now we begin to see God's purpose for Leah you can't compare yourself to somebody else it doesn't work it doesn't work that's how they get women to buy makeup comparison say well you're not as pretty as that person not as pretty as you could be and so the Modern Standard and it's really not pretty at all but that's how they sell you makeup it's just a sales job and trying to get you to compare yourself with somebody else but you might be a homely person today I know what it's like to be ugly actually I know what it's like not to be fit but I also know it but I care less about that than most women do you understand that but but I do know what it's like but also know what it's like to be a son of the king I also know what it's I know what it's like to be and to be kicked out to be ostracized to be to be said that I'm different and I'm weird and everything else even from a young person I was told yeah you just don't want to have any fun I know what that's like for the joke but I know what it's like to be a son of the king I know what it's like to feel the presence of God I know what it's like to be born again by the spirit of God how many in here can say the same thing I know what it's like to be rejected but I know what it's like to be accepted I may be different but I've been accepted in the Beloved I may not be up to everybody's standard of beauty but I know what it's like to be accepted by God amen the Brandon said Along Came the prophets of old Abraham the sweethearts of the Bible Abraham and Sarah I love that when Sarah died Abraham purchased a piece of ground right near where job was buried and buried Sarah he said I'm a joint Heir with you over Yonder job was buried there Abraham and Sarah Isaac and Rebecca Jacob and Leah and when Joseph died he said carry my bones back to that place we're told that in the New Testament when Jesus when the earthquake shook the city right before Jesus would would give up the ghost or as he gave up the ghost in Matthew 27 52 the graves were open and many bodies of the Saints which slept arose and came out of the graves after his resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared unto many you imagine I'm just dramatized I know it doesn't happen quite this way but just if you think about it men are just laying there man whoa nothing quite a nap waking up Abraham wakes up hurry Sarah praise God We're Young again we've been we've been young before like some job wakes up Isaac wakes up there's Rebecca you see these love stories I said I said couldn't be the same without Rebecca Abraham wouldn't be complete without Sarah and Jacob wakes up oh something happened felt a jolt in here time to get up and move around the city or my wife Rachel where are you it's Leah think about it for a minute for you but it was God's purpose and God's plan now that's going to change the way some of you all think because we've heard for years that we'll get the right one in the millennium think about it Jacob got the right one when the time came buried with him in the cave of mcpila brother Branham taught us if you get the wrong one you get the right one of the Millennium but it may be the one you're married to thought it was the right wrong one because everything went wrong because it was all messed up and you had much trauma and trouble in your life but you didn't realize God was doing something in your life God put you together see things don't have to go smoothly for God to have put you together that's free that's not part of the sermon Jacob got the right one might not be what he wanted but it was the right one now let's look Beyond just marriage look at your life today you think I wish I could have been different I wish things would have happened different I wish there was less pain I wish there was less struggle I wish my kids would went a Direction they hurt me when they were born and then they hurt me worse when they got big I wish there was less trouble oh God I wish it could have been different I wish I could rewrite history but maybe God allowed you to go through that to get a prophecy of Praise out of your life that you can stand up in a Sunday morning you can say the Lord gives and the Lord takes away blessed be the name of the Lord I will not I whatever God does I'll bless his name come into the world naked I go out naked I don't carry nothing with me blessed be the name of the Lord if I lose everything let me have you Lord she said I will praise the Lord amen God allowed that pain perhaps to get a prophecy of Praise out of your life are you still with me this morning just a little bit further David when King Saul of benjamite one of Rachel's descendants Israel is after David trying to kill him David's one of Leah's descendants still trouble in the family and they're trying to kill him and David flees to the Philistines for his own safety and the city he lives in comes under a malachite attack and you all know the story I'm running out of time so I won't read it there but it said David was greatly distressed for the people were talking about stoning him and he said every man for his sons and for his daughters but David encouraged himself in the Lord his God why he was in that bloodline of praise praise through struggle go look at the Psalms and begin to read the Psalms and begin to look at what God was doing it was it was praised in in spite of Saul chasing me Praise In Spite of my son turning me down Praise In Spite of my own problems I will praise the Lord listen David encouraged himself I don't know how David did that exactly but I like to think that he sung you ever think about because that's many times how we get courage to go to battle it's to sing that's how they get courage in battle is they start up the band and they begin to play and the the Fife and the drum I've always wondered about them guys they go out in the same battle the rest of them go out in and they get shot at the same as the rest of them but they can't shoot back they just got to keep playing why because somebody's got to be there to keep the courage of the men up David encouraged himself I like to think you begin to sing and maybe he'd sang Psalm 34 because he had just written that just a little while before when he was down there in front of the king and he appeared like a madman you remember the story and out of that out of that story he he wrote Psalms 34. he said I will bless the Lord and at all times you see the prophecy coming down here here was a woman who prophesied a mother who prophesied over her child and many many years later here's one of her descendants one of the children of that of his bloodline that's crying out saying I Will Bless The Lord at all times his praise shall continually be in my mouth it's a phrase that means in Hebrew I can bless the Lord in every situation I wonder if we could say Amen to that today I bless the Lord in trouble I bless the Lord in struggle I'll bless the Lord when people say amen I bless the Lord when nobody says amen I'll bless the Lord when things are going good I'll bless the Lord when things are going bad are you with me now I will praise the Lord in spite of my circumstances see brother Ben you don't know how hard that is let me tell you I mean no more than what you think but let me tell you this it is the difficulty of it that he loves that's what God loves about it it's the difficulty of it if it was easy it wouldn't be a sacrifice foreign 's hearing me today if it was easy to praise God during difficult situations it would not be a sacrifice of praise he ath the heaven on a flowery bed of ease but he doesn't why because it's for our good he's building a character and in doing that in those moments when the perfume is squeezed out of our life it's in those moments God works the most and that's what he loves you realize it keeps your prayers the Bible says it was a bowl of incense there was the prayers of the Saints sweet smell and Savor he keeps your prayers prayers made through heartache he hears them prayers when you're sick and you pray over and over and over again and think am I ever going to be healed am I ever going to be right this thing's ever going to be in the right place and he he hears your prayers he keeps your prayers because it smells good to him he loves it first truth is my soul shall make her boast in the Lord that's where we get the word hallelujah it's from this verse where the Hebrew word is halal which describes praising Yahweh proudly to others praising God proudly to others it's focused on the Deeds of God and not on pride in self the word hallelujah means praise Yahweh or praise our God it's derived from that term it's focused on praising God not for what he does but for who he is not for what he's given but because he is the giver not because everything is right but in spite of everything being wrong you're still God Psalm 34 3 hold magnify the Lord with me let us exalt his name together I sought the Lord and he heard me and delivered me from all my fears they looked unto him and were enlightened that means they were radiant their faces were not ashamed that word in the Hebrew is joyfully satisfied this poor man cried and the Lord heard him have you ever had him hear you when you cried saved him out of all his troubles the angel of the Lord in campus round about them that fear him and delivereth him hear his pavement about to be stoned everybody's a church that's turned against him everybody's mad at him he's down there by himself and he begins to worship God encourage himself in the Lord see David didn't encourage himself by saying you're the greatest David you're anointed think about it look at the Psalms encourages himself by saying God you're God you are God encourage himself with praise that was a new song by the way when he sang it some people have a problem with new songs I'm all right with new songs songs the words are right and it's not rock and roll something like that you understand there's some music that's wrong just the music of it's wrong there's some music that's wrong but I'll tell you what if it's a new song and it says come magnify the Lord with me I'll sing it with David that was a new song and in his worst moment he cried out magnify the Lord with me Hallelujah he had just written that when that happened many years later Isaiah's prophecy narrowed it down even further but not only be in the line of Judah but a virgin would conceive a virgin wouldn't be by the strength of a man but a virgin would conceive and Mary is found to be that virgin that says be it unto me according to your word and she begins to cry out she was laughed at she was made fun of she knew her whole life would be troubled because of this situation but she cries out to God and Mary said my soul doth magnify the Lord my spirit hath rejoiced in God my savior what is it a prophecy of praise his he said for he that is mighty have done to me great things holy is his name his Mercy is on them to fear Him from generation to generation he has showed strength with his arm he has scattered the proud of the imagination of their hearts he had put down the mighty from their feet exalted them of low degree he had filled the Hungry with Good Things Are You full this morning of good things he did that and the rich he has sent empty away he is hoping his servant Israel in remembrance of his Mercy as he spoke to our fathers to Abraham and to his seed forever what was it a mother's prophecy of praise married to with no pain she was no pain a body and pain of mind she knew what it was like be in pain and not be able to help her own child a child that God had given her you know it was completely God God created the blood cell he created the egg but yet Mary birthed it oh God that's the way the new birth is God creates a new creature in you and yet you have to bear it oh God oh my and Simeon when he prophesied to her he said behold this child is set for the fall and Rising again of many in Israel for a sign which shall be spoken against your sword shall pierce through thine own soul also as the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed he is the Redeemer he will have to die he's a man of sorrow acquainted with creep he had to shed his blood for the Redemption of Leah for the Redemption of Rachel for the Redemption of Mary herself he had to be bruised to bruise the head of the serpent but yet the Bible tells us that for the joy that was set before him he endured the cross despising the shame it sat down at the right hand of the Throne of God what Joy is that you ask brother Brandon said when Christ was here on Earth he was crowned to the crown of thorns to shed the blood he said that's right but every believer that comes through that shed blood have you come through the shed blood today every believer that comes through that shed blood pulls forth that crown of thorns and crowns him with Glory of praises and honor that's what I want to do today I want to take off that Crown of Thorns that was put there for me I want to take it off of his precious head and I want to put a crown on him not a crown of thorns not a crown of my troubles and my worries but I want to crown him with Glory of praises and honor every believer he said that steps into his presence accepts that blood from his pressed brow here with thorns and crowns him with glory and praises and Majesty I want to crown him this morning don't you I may be going through struggle but I want to crowd him king of kings and Lord of lords crown him Lord of our life as king of kings as healer as Alpha Omega that's the beginning and ending as the counselor the Prince of Peace the Mighty God the Everlasting father Hallelujah after Jesus ascended there was another benjamined another son of Rachel named Saul but he met the lion of the tribe of Judah he was looking oh God he was looking for the lion of Judas physical or spiritual descendants looking to kill him just like King Saul did fulfilling his Destiny but he met the lion of the tribe of Judah on the way to Damascus one day in the form of the pillar of Fire and when he met him by natural birth he was a benjamite but by spiritual birth he comes as we everyone do Under the prophecy of Leah sons of God are born at Bethlehem how many believe that today children of God are born at Bethlehem what does that mean it means you're in the line of Judah spiritual Seed of Abraham people of praise Hallelujah verse 22. and the multitude rose up together against them what was this Paul been preaching got in trouble that'll get you in trouble quicker than anything else preaching preaching the gospel with a man named Silas also a spiritual Seed of Abraham and the magistrates ran off their clothes and commanded to beat them when they laid many stripes upon them they cast them into prison charging the Jailer to keep them safely who having received such a charge because these guys had a habit of getting out of jail Hallelujah and so you haven't received such a charge he thrust them in the inner prison made their feet fast in the stalks and at midnight Paul and Silas prayed and encourage themselves in the Lord they sang Praises unto God you say well I just keep my my prayers in my head I keep my Praises in my head that's not what Paul and Silas did sometimes it takes great pain to get the Praises out of our head and into our mouths on our lips but he loves to hear it you imagine how pleasing that was to God here they were they've been beaten their back was stuck to the mire and the grime there was rats running across their feet they were in the inner prison no light at all and while they're in there what are we going to do brother Paul if you hadn't led me in here I tell you what I'd be a free man if you hadn't preached that sermon I tell you what we we'd have a bigger church today people would treat us right if you hadn't done that boy we'd be better off it's not what Silas did Paul might have said silence if you'd have been a better subordinate if you'd have been a better co-missionary then we wouldn't have been in this situation what are you doing what are you doing down here in this place what are we doing in this place are you are you just uh are you just did you not have the mind of the Lord they could have been sitting there accusing one another griping at one another and discouraging one another but instead of doing that they said let's sing a song together let's say a prayer and let's sing a song and they prayed a prayer and they begin to sing and the year of God heard it amen just like he heard Leah when she was going through her struggles he heard he heard Paul and Silas there's no worship like Worship in a jail cell I think about it everybody says I worship when I'm free now you worship when you're bound to get free that's the biblical order of it well I'll wait until my well when this leaves me when all these troubles I get over them no it's when you're going through some things and you worship God anyway hallelujah oh God help me today I I've just I'll be honest with you this week and I'm I'm closing in just a moment this week I've been going through some things just in my own mind I did it to myself it's just my own mind I've been going through some things and and struggling with some things and been down a little bit but in those moments it's in those moments I realize that's what God wants he wants me to sing during those times he wants me to go ahead and preach during those times he wants me to worship him like never before during those times you might be sick today but that sickness is there for a reason God he's already healed you then if you're not don't feel well this morning Now's the Time to praise God if you don't yet people say well I'll go to church when I feel like it know the time to go to church is when you don't feel like it and everything's against you and the world seems like it's turned upside down you go to the house of God and you say I'm going to begin to praise him that's what David taught us that's what he did over and over again I'm gonna praise him now in spite of my difficulties I'm gonna praise him now in spite of the the hardship of this childbirth or Praise Him suddenly great earthquake so that the foundations of the prison were shaken immediately all the doors were open everyone's banned we're loose brother Brown said Paul and Silas must have talked about the Lord until about midnight and then began to sing him some good old Christian song he said oh if we'd sing today we'd sing there's power in the blood or how I love Jesus or something like that when they begin to sing all of a sudden an earthquake struck the place and notice how it done instead of piling those walls of that big old building right in on top of them and mashing them to death it shook the walls away from them not only that but it broke the stocks and bars loose from them and they were set free see you think the shaking that's going on is going to pile the walls on top of you you think the shaking that's going on in politics is going to just pile on top of you and you're going to end up with no food and no water and no money in the bank but you're a child of God you're a son or a daughter of the king that shaking is not going to pile on top of you but that shaking is to shake the walls down so you can get out are you hearing me today you think the shaking going on in your family is because that it's going to fall down on you and you're going to be destroyed but he has not anointed you for Destruction he has not called you for Destruction he has called you to be a Son of God called you to be a daughter of God he's anointed you to rise up you is anointing you to be the bride then you need to be the bride today the walls will not destroy you the walls of Jericho could not destroy Rahab the walls of the prison could not destroy Paul and Silas oh thank God oh thank God the walls fell all around them but they weren't touched by them they were free the Bible says in everything musicians go ahead and come when the house is a mess give thanks what's hard in it we want to appear to be something to somebody else just let go and give thanks I don't say that you should not do your job but I say this it's more important to praise than it is to have every all your ducks in a row it's more important to put God in his place than to put the dishes in their place and yet you serve God in that way but it's in those moments when it seems like nothing is going right when the kids won't behave I will praise the Lord when the when the husband won't behave I will praise the Lord that was a joke are you with me though no matter what's going through what you're going through I will praise the Lord and that prophecy in your life oh God will make a difference to somebody else look at the look at the Mother dear she was just being a mother that's all she was a real mother and she stood up when Bert call was about to about to kill her baby a little fun that'd come out there and here come but here
