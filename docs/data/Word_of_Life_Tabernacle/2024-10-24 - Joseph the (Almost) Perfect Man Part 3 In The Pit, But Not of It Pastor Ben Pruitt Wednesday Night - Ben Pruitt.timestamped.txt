[51:43] Genesis chapter
[51:45] 37 Genesis
[51:49] 37:19 and uh we'll go right into the
[51:52] word tonight good to see each and every
[51:54] one of you on a Wednesday night good see
[51:56] brother Jeremy back from California I
[51:58] guess he survived the Left Coast so uh
[52:03] back with us for tonight at least so
[52:05] good to have you back brother Jeremy
[52:07] Genesis 37:19 it's hard on a redneck to
[52:10] be out of their place but uh brother
[52:14] Jeremy's a world traveler so he's used
[52:17] to
[52:19] it let's read they said one to another
[52:22] behold this dreamer
[52:25] cometh come come now therefore and let
[52:28] us slay him and cast him into some pit
[52:33] and we will say some evil Beast hath
[52:36] devoured him and we shall see what will
[52:40] become of his dreams pray the Lord would
[52:43] add his Blessing to the word you may be
[52:49] seated want to speak to you on Joseph
[52:51] the the almost perfect
[52:54] man and we know that he was not perfect
[52:57] because only Christ was perfect and yet
[52:59] he did a lot of things right and he was
[53:02] a type his life was a type of
[53:06] Christ brother Peter they were having
[53:08] some trouble with the stream if they
[53:09] haven't got that worked out you might
[53:10] want to check on
[53:12] that maybe the internet you bear with us
[53:14] if you're watching
[53:17] tonight Joseph Dreamed a Dream the Bible
[53:20] tells us and he told it to his Brethren
[53:22] now we know that Joseph's dreams were
[53:24] god-given they were true they they were
[53:28] right but they were not complete and I
[53:31] think when we begin to look at what God
[53:33] shows us we realize that God don't even
[53:36] tell His prophets everything he just
[53:38] tells them what he wants them to know
[53:41] and brother brandom tells us that over
[53:42] and over again he just tells them what
[53:44] he wants them to know and so Joseph did
[53:47] not see the intermediary period between
[53:51] uh where he was at at the moment and
[53:53] where he would be in the future all he
[53:55] could see
[53:57] is the future he could see as he said
[54:00] unto them in verse six he said I pray
[54:02] you hear this dream which I have dreamed
[54:05] he said for behold we were binding sheep
[54:07] in the field and oh my sheath arose and
[54:10] also stood upright and behold your
[54:12] sheath stood round about and made
[54:14] obedience to my sheath or bowed down to
[54:17] my sheath and his Brethren said to him
[54:20] shalt thou indeed Reign Over Us and you
[54:23] know if we had uh if you had been his
[54:25] brothers you might have had the same
[54:27] kind of response because here's this
[54:29] young man this guy that that had no
[54:32] business uh uh you know reigning over
[54:34] anybody and he's telling them about a
[54:37] dream but the dream wasn't of the
[54:39] present the dream was of the future it
[54:41] was telling of a future event and Joseph
[54:45] had to reach a place of maturity in his
[54:47] life that he could be in a place where
[54:49] where they would bow down to him and yet
[54:52] he wouldn't abuse that power that they
[54:54] gave him and so at the moment moment he
[54:57] was they were not going to bow down to
[54:58] him and so they hated him because of his
[55:01] dreams he said they hated him yet the
[55:02] more for his dreams and for his words
[55:05] and verse n he dreamed yet another dream
[55:07] and told it to his Brethren I want you
[55:09] to notice every time he dreams a dream
[55:11] he tells the dream he dreamed a dream
[55:14] and he told the dream he said behold I
[55:16] have dreamed a dream more and behold the
[55:18] Sun and the Moon and the 11 stars made
[55:21] obedience to me and he told it to his
[55:23] father and to his Brethren and his
[55:25] father rebuked him and said unto him
[55:27] what is this dream that thou Hast
[55:29] dreamed shall I and thy mother and thy
[55:31] Brethren indeed come to bow down
[55:33] ourselves to thee to the Earth so he's
[55:36] saying uh not just that the Brethren got
[55:38] tired of it but his father got tired of
[55:41] it and he said you you just need to wait
[55:43] a minute boy you're not ready for this
[55:46] right and his Brethren envied him but
[55:49] his father observed the saying so even
[55:52] though his father rebuked him his father
[55:54] realized there was something
[55:56] Supernatural about this young man in his
[55:58] dreams but his Brethren envied him and
[56:02] so we we we should say you know if you
[56:04] if you're a spiritual person Joseph
[56:07] Dream your dreams and I think all of us
[56:09] have a dream and a vision and a goal of
[56:12] Life Something That We're pressing
[56:13] towards something that we're looking
[56:15] don't you have something in your life
[56:17] that you see yourself in you see I hope
[56:19] we all see ourselves in heaven one day
[56:21] we see ourselves uh even on the earth we
[56:24] see ourselves more mature more God
[56:26] more like Christ we see the church in a
[56:29] in a elevated place an Ephesian Church a
[56:32] place that God can move and so we want
[56:34] to dream our dreams we want to have
[56:36] dreams but be careful who you tell your
[56:38] dreams
[56:40] to right because we've already
[56:44] established in in another sermon
[56:46] previous sermon that immaturity in
[56:49] Joseph led him to say things maybe he
[56:51] wouldn't have said later in the same
[56:53] way where where Jesus held back and
[56:56] remember he said it's not my
[56:59] time verse two says the tongue of the
[57:01] wise useth knowledge a right so in other
[57:06] words to have a dream to be a person
[57:10] that uh is spiritual or to be a person
[57:13] who is gifted and using that in the
[57:16] right way to be a person who knows
[57:19] something but knowing how to use that
[57:22] knowledge and and so he said the tongue
[57:24] of the wise useth knowledge a right but
[57:27] the mouth of fools porth out
[57:32] foolishness right so there's two
[57:33] different people maybe the difference
[57:35] between the fool and the wise many times
[57:37] is just maturity it's just growing up
[57:40] it's just getting older it's just
[57:42] learning some things it's just going
[57:44] through a pit it's just going through a
[57:46] prison it's just going through those
[57:49] things for you reach a place where you
[57:51] can speak in the right
[57:54] way now if we we've done the talking and
[57:57] I know many times we do and if I get in
[57:59] trouble most of the time it's from
[58:01] talking too much and yet you know I I
[58:04] will get in trouble from time to time
[58:05] because it's sort of my job to talk but
[58:09] yet at the same time it's you get in
[58:11] trouble if you talk too much and and
[58:13] sometimes we do that and and someone
[58:15] gets hurt I want to say this especially
[58:16] to you younger people and you children
[58:19] and young people someone gets hurt
[58:21] there's a way to fix that
[58:23] apologize but she said well I wasn't
[58:25] wrong about this certain thing we'll
[58:27] apologize
[58:29] anyway it's a good learning experience
[58:31] if nothing else you learn how to say I'm
[58:34] sorry right learn from the
[58:37] experience and in in in Luke
[58:40] 171 uh he Jesus deals with how we should
[58:44] deal with offenses and how we should
[58:47] forgive those who have offended so in
[58:49] Luke 171 then said he unto the disciples
[58:52] it is
[58:53] impossible but that offenses will come
[58:56] so in other words people will say and do
[58:58] things that offend God's
[59:00] children that will happen but woe unto
[59:04] him through whom they come right he says
[59:07] it were better for him that a millstone
[59:09] were hanged about his neck and he cast
[59:10] into the sea that he should offend one
[59:12] of these little ones now we're not
[59:14] talking about the modern victim culture
[59:16] where everybody's offended by every
[59:18] little thing that you say we're talking
[59:20] about something real something that
[59:22] shouldn't have been said and was said to
[59:25] one of these little ones now and then we
[59:28] look at the one that said it obviously
[59:30] they shouldn't have said it and what's
[59:32] the way to to stop that apologize and
[59:36] quit
[59:37] talking right quit talking about it a
[59:40] and then move on to something else
[59:42] because you will fall again you will
[59:44] mess up again you will speak again and
[59:47] it'll be something that's not exactly
[59:49] right well just apologize get past it
[59:51] and move on to the next thing and learn
[59:53] from the experience yes sir right right
[59:56] but then Jesus deals with if we're the
[59:58] one who is offended because we don't
[1:00:00] want to stop with verse two we want to
[1:00:02] go on because he said take heed to
[1:00:04] yourselves If thy brother trespass
[1:00:07] against thee rebuke him if he repent
[1:00:11] forgive
[1:00:13] him
[1:00:14] right but you say well what if he or she
[1:00:16] doesn't change that's not your problem
[1:00:19] right if we've if we if we've brought it
[1:00:22] to their attention and they won't repent
[1:00:24] then we forgive if they repent we
[1:00:26] forgive if they say I'm sorry we forgive
[1:00:28] but see the reason we're afraid to the
[1:00:31] reason we're afraid to give forgiveness
[1:00:33] many times because we think if we give
[1:00:35] forgiveness somehow that lets them off
[1:00:37] the hook when it doesn't do that at all
[1:00:39] it lets us off the hook see whether they
[1:00:42] change or not it's not our problem look
[1:00:44] down to verse four if he trespass
[1:00:46] against thee seven times in a
[1:00:49] day right and seven times in a day
[1:00:53] that's a lot
[1:00:56] right so that's a person that called you
[1:00:57] on the phone said something they
[1:00:58] shouldn't have said and and and feelings
[1:01:00] were hurt and then they apologized then
[1:01:02] they did it again six more
[1:01:05] times in the same
[1:01:08] day right now we get tired of that he
[1:01:13] said saying I Repent so he just says I'm
[1:01:15] sorry Thou shalt forgive him right now
[1:01:20] why would we forgive him because if we
[1:01:21] don't forgive we'll
[1:01:23] backside that's right because God won't
[1:01:25] hear our prayer
[1:01:26] cuz brother brandham teaches us you find
[1:01:28] the quote faith is based on
[1:01:31] forgiveness and brother brandham says
[1:01:32] this I've read it many times and then
[1:01:34] we'll move on but he said you say well
[1:01:36] if I can just get even with her if I can
[1:01:38] get even with him no matter what they
[1:01:40] done choose life choose life for Jesus
[1:01:43] said if from your heart you don't
[1:01:45] forgive every person their transgression
[1:01:48] neither does your heavenly father
[1:01:49] forgive you so just get that close if
[1:01:52] there's one op in your heart against any
[1:01:55] person sinner or Saint you're in danger
[1:01:58] of
[1:01:59] Hellfire why because you you backslide
[1:02:02] in your spirit because you because you
[1:02:04] hold bitterness and the dove will not
[1:02:06] stay in that bitter place
[1:02:10] right so Joseph says some things that
[1:02:13] his his brothers won't let go
[1:02:17] of right they won't they won't get over
[1:02:21] it and they end up doing something
[1:02:23] terrible because of it and yet it was
[1:02:26] all in the plan of God that it would be
[1:02:29] done so Joseph's dreams spoke of a
[1:02:33] singular place and time in his life when
[1:02:36] his Brethren would come to him and bow
[1:02:38] down and they were absolutely true but
[1:02:42] it wasn't all the
[1:02:43] story right the the two dreams didn't
[1:02:46] say anything about the pit Piper's house
[1:02:48] the
[1:02:49] prison and and Joseph himself was what
[1:02:53] brother random called The Prince of
[1:02:54] prosperity
[1:02:56] the prince of prosperity and that's what
[1:02:59] his Dreams made him and so he's telling
[1:03:03] his brothers I'm the Prince of
[1:03:06] prosperity and they put him in a pit and
[1:03:09] said okay you be the prince of
[1:03:10] prosperity from there but guess what he
[1:03:14] was oh that's the great thing because it
[1:03:17] doesn't change you when you're in the
[1:03:19] pit it doesn't change oh church if we
[1:03:21] can only grab a hold of this Revelation
[1:03:23] tonight when we're in the pit that
[1:03:25] doesn't change who we are when you get a
[1:03:27] little depressed or you get anxious or
[1:03:29] or you feel like that you haven't felt
[1:03:31] the presence of God in a long time and
[1:03:33] you feel like things just aren't going
[1:03:34] your way or you lose your job or your
[1:03:36] kids are going astray and you wonder how
[1:03:38] can I even show my face in church again
[1:03:41] remember you are not defined by the pit
[1:03:44] that you're in but the dream is still
[1:03:46] true that your predestination still
[1:03:48] holds your election is still
[1:03:53] real do you believe that tonight
[1:03:58] Joseph was the prince of prosperity
[1:04:00] brother BR said Joseph saw it by his own
[1:04:03] life now now he's telling us that Joseph
[1:04:07] was watching his own life which ought to
[1:04:09] be something we all
[1:04:11] do and seeing Christ out of his own life
[1:04:15] so it gave him a forn
[1:04:17] knowledge of
[1:04:19] Christ of the Messiah coming because his
[1:04:24] own life and what he had been through
[1:04:27] now he said he seen that he was born A
[1:04:28] peculiar boy that he was a
[1:04:30] sear there was something about him he
[1:04:33] could see Visions he couldn't understand
[1:04:35] it even went and told his mother and
[1:04:38] father when they tried to correct him
[1:04:39] when he seen the she was all bowing to
[1:04:40] his he couldn't understand it but then
[1:04:43] next thing he found out he was betrayed
[1:04:44] by his Brethren he said what am I
[1:04:47] portraying here that's a good question
[1:04:49] to
[1:04:50] ask what am I portraying here what is
[1:04:53] and sometimes we need to look at the big
[1:04:55] picture what is God trying to show in my
[1:04:59] life oh my so he had enough about him
[1:05:02] that he was able to look at it and say
[1:05:04] what am I portraying here this
[1:05:07] 17-year-old boy that gets throned in the
[1:05:09] pit what am I portraying here what is
[1:05:13] this for knowledge that I'm receiving he
[1:05:16] watched his own life and any man can
[1:05:21] watch your own life and about tell what
[1:05:22] you are if you just check up on yourself
[1:05:25] whether you're really a Christian or not
[1:05:27] watch the things you do what you say
[1:05:29] your Associates and so forth you'll find
[1:05:31] out whether you really got anything
[1:05:32] there or not he said he's seen his life
[1:05:36] as it begin to move now let's just all
[1:05:39] go uh up and and and get uh heavenly
[1:05:41] vision for just a moment and take a look
[1:05:44] at our own lives and we begin to look at
[1:05:46] our lives and we see the trials that
[1:05:48] we've been through and the troubles and
[1:05:50] the struggles and we can do one or two
[1:05:52] things about that we can blame people we
[1:05:55] can look around around us and say well
[1:05:56] that man caused me to do that or that
[1:05:58] woman caused me to do that or that
[1:06:00] person caused that in my life or we can
[1:06:02] raise above that and say what is God
[1:06:05] trying to show through my life what is
[1:06:07] he trying to portray out of my life so
[1:06:11] he said any you can watch your own life
[1:06:13] he's seen his life as it begin to move
[1:06:15] and the next thing you know they found
[1:06:16] he was thrown into a hole deceived by
[1:06:19] his brother supposed to being killed and
[1:06:21] thrown into a hole and he was taken up
[1:06:23] again Joseph foresaw that he saw himself
[1:06:25] in the prison he saw himself in the
[1:06:27] dungeon now what's he foreseeing he
[1:06:29] didn't know he was going to the prison
[1:06:30] he didn't know he was going to the
[1:06:31] dungeon but he's foreseeing God's
[1:06:33] showing something in my life that's
[1:06:35] going to happen in the Life of Christ in
[1:06:38] the life of the Messiah he foresaw that
[1:06:40] his life was speaking of a Christ that
[1:06:42] would come and you and I are speaking oh
[1:06:45] my Our Lives speak of a Christ that has
[1:06:48] come what is it we're we're we're going
[1:06:50] back as he looked forward to Christ
[1:06:52] we're we're looking back to Christ and
[1:06:55] seeing the Our Lives mirror The Life of
[1:06:58] Christ so he saw himself in the dungeon
[1:07:00] now he saw God was with him whatever he
[1:07:04] did oh I love that that builds
[1:07:06] confidence right there because if you
[1:07:09] never were in the pit you'd never know
[1:07:11] if God was with you in the pit or
[1:07:14] not right if you never struggled to get
[1:07:17] a prayer through it seemed like Heavens
[1:07:19] were brass you wouldn't know if God was
[1:07:22] with you when when when Heavens felt
[1:07:24] like brass but because he was with you
[1:07:27] before you know he'll be with you again
[1:07:29] so you're watching your own life and
[1:07:31] you're seeing that because I know God
[1:07:33] was with me God was with me in the trial
[1:07:35] he was with me in my troubles he was
[1:07:37] with me when I didn't have a job he was
[1:07:39] with me when I didn't have any money he
[1:07:40] was with me when I struggled he was with
[1:07:42] me you can even look back before you
[1:07:44] become a Christian and say God protected
[1:07:46] me God kept me what was going on in your
[1:07:49] life God was with me if he could keep me
[1:07:51] then he'll keep me today and whatever
[1:07:54] the devil has start going to throw at me
[1:07:56] in the future I know he's already kept
[1:07:57] me through these things he'll keep me
[1:07:59] through
[1:08:00] that
[1:08:02] amen amen he said
[1:08:05] everywhere Joseph was there was
[1:08:10] Prosperity that included the
[1:08:14] pit think about it what Prosperity could
[1:08:18] you find in a pit right think about it
[1:08:23] for a minute what are you going to find
[1:08:25] the
[1:08:26] prosperous about a pit what is it well
[1:08:30] it's coming out of the
[1:08:32] pit and even that looked like it got
[1:08:35] worse because he went into
[1:08:36] slavery but God was bringing him to
[1:08:39] Egypt the only way he would ever go to
[1:08:42] Egypt was to be carried there as a
[1:08:45] slave so God brought him out of the pit
[1:08:49] and that was it prosperity in the pit
[1:08:51] now look there was Prosperity he was the
[1:08:53] prince of prosperity and him for
[1:08:55] shadowing Christ wherever Christ is
[1:08:59] there is
[1:09:00] prosperity oh I love that say brother
[1:09:03] Ben are you prosperous well according to
[1:09:04] the word I
[1:09:05] am right I may not have a lot of money
[1:09:08] but I'm prosperous according to the word
[1:09:10] you may not have a lot of things but
[1:09:12] you're prosperous according to the word
[1:09:14] things may not work out the way you
[1:09:15] think they should but you're prosperous
[1:09:17] according to the word because wherever
[1:09:19] Christ is there's prosperity and he
[1:09:21] lives in my heart and so I can say I'm a
[1:09:24] prosperous man today wherever I'm at it
[1:09:27] doesn't matter what where circumstances
[1:09:29] put me the desert will Bloom like a rose
[1:09:32] wherever I am he said the desert shall
[1:09:34] Blossom as a rose the rough places will
[1:09:36] be made smooth it shall bring forth in
[1:09:38] the abundance for he is the prince of
[1:09:41] prosperity wherever he
[1:09:45] is oh my oh it's just we need to change
[1:09:48] our view and look at it from a different
[1:09:50] view a different angle and see that he
[1:09:53] is the prince of prosperity no matter
[1:09:56] what we're going
[1:09:58] through now we we know that Reuben saved
[1:10:03] Joseph's life Genesis 37:22 Reuben said
[1:10:06] unto them that his brothers shed no
[1:10:09] blood but cast him into this pit that is
[1:10:12] in the wilderness lay no hand upon him
[1:10:14] that we might rid him out of their hands
[1:10:16] to deliver him to his father again again
[1:10:20] it's God saving his life through Reuben
[1:10:23] one of his brothers and Ruben actually
[1:10:26] attempts to go get but then when he
[1:10:28] don't find him he participates in the
[1:10:30] cover up later and I don't have time to
[1:10:33] get into it tonight but you can study
[1:10:35] Reuben and you'll find a time when Moses
[1:10:38] spoke over about letting bitterness get
[1:10:40] to you you talk about hatred getting to
[1:10:42] you they actually sat down a and ate
[1:10:46] dinner instead of instead of trying to
[1:10:48] reconcile the issue and fix the issue
[1:10:50] they sat down and ate and they actually
[1:10:54] and they actually waited on a company of
[1:10:56] ishmaelites to come from Gilead with
[1:10:58] their camels bearing spicery and balm
[1:11:00] and myrr going to carry it down to Egypt
[1:11:03] and Judah said to his Brethren what
[1:11:05] profit is it if we slay our brother and
[1:11:07] conceal his blood see they were always
[1:11:09] thinking about the
[1:11:11] money right so they said well how can we
[1:11:14] profit in this if we slay our brother
[1:11:17] and conceal his blood and we know even
[1:11:21] brother brandom ties that all the way
[1:11:23] down into uh after the WRA capure when
[1:11:25] he talks about the Jews making a
[1:11:27] covenant for money and so Judah said
[1:11:30] what prophet is it if we say our brother
[1:11:32] and conceal this Blood verse 27 come let
[1:11:34] us sell him to the ishmaelites and let
[1:11:36] not our hand be upon him for he is our
[1:11:38] brother and our flesh and his Brethren
[1:11:40] were content they said okay we won't
[1:11:42] kill him we'll sell him into slavery and
[1:11:44] we'll actually benefit from it verse 28
[1:11:47] then there passed by midianites
[1:11:48] merchantmen and they drew and lifted up
[1:11:50] Joseph out of the pit and sold Joseph to
[1:11:53] the Israelites for 20 pieces of silver
[1:11:55] and they brought Joseph into
[1:11:59] Egypt wonder what Joseph was thinking
[1:12:02] about in the
[1:12:05] pit it'd be easy while you're in a pit
[1:12:10] that your brothers who should love you
[1:12:13] and who the dream says are going to bow
[1:12:16] to you have put you there it'd be easy
[1:12:20] to lose
[1:12:21] faith in your
[1:12:23] dream it would be easy to lose
[1:12:26] confidence in what God has said about
[1:12:28] you while you're in the pit it's hard to
[1:12:31] keep your your your your focus your
[1:12:34] narrative it's hard to you know it's
[1:12:36] like being a ship in a storm it's hard
[1:12:38] to keep your direction it's hard it's
[1:12:41] hard to make sure that you keep going in
[1:12:43] the right direction because otherwise
[1:12:46] the the the ship will go all kinds of
[1:12:48] different directions and all you're just
[1:12:50] so concerned about staying alive that
[1:12:52] you're not even looking what direction
[1:12:54] you're going how many ships are blown
[1:12:56] off
[1:12:57] course so it would be easy to lose Faith
[1:13:01] while you're in a pit a muddy dirty pit
[1:13:05] with nothing to eat and your brothers
[1:13:07] are up there around the rim you can hear
[1:13:09] them talking about you it's easy to lose
[1:13:12] faith when you're going through that and
[1:13:16] how would it happen and question how it
[1:13:18] would happen how are they ever going to
[1:13:20] bow to me when they just sold me into
[1:13:23] slavery but it's in the p that you find
[1:13:26] out or someone is a genuine believer you
[1:13:29] don't find that in the Revival meeting
[1:13:31] come on church because somebody might
[1:13:33] shout and another person shout one of
[1:13:34] them be a genuine Christian and the
[1:13:36] other one be a
[1:13:37] devil one might speak in tongues another
[1:13:40] one speak in tongues one be genuine and
[1:13:42] another one be a devil but when you get
[1:13:43] in the pit when you get them in life
[1:13:45] when you get them in a place where it
[1:13:47] seems like everything's going against
[1:13:49] them that's when you find out whether
[1:13:50] they're Christians or not whether
[1:13:52] they're Believers or not whether there's
[1:13:54] something there or not and I'll say our
[1:13:57] reactions if we'll watch our lives our
[1:13:59] reaction to our life when we're in the
[1:14:01] pit says a lot about us yeah right what
[1:14:05] do we do do we do we give up on the word
[1:14:08] do we start doing things that aren't
[1:14:09] right do we start skipping Church do we
[1:14:11] start saying well I'm not really sure if
[1:14:13] I believe the message do we start not
[1:14:14] listening to tapes do we start losing
[1:14:16] confidence in our pastor do we start
[1:14:18] when we're in the pit it tells a lot
[1:14:19] about us right and I'm not saying it's
[1:14:22] not difficult but there's got to be
[1:14:23] something there to hold you
[1:14:26] I'm sure Joseph wanted to give up on his
[1:14:28] dream he may have wanted to just be like
[1:14:30] anybody else they might as well kill me
[1:14:32] but there was something in him that
[1:14:33] wouldn't let him do
[1:14:34] it and there's something I believe in
[1:14:37] every one of you here tonight that won't
[1:14:38] let you give up on being a Christian
[1:14:40] that won't let you give up on being a
[1:14:46] Believer remember said Joseph was a
[1:14:48] prophet he couldn't help because he
[1:14:50] could interpret dreams he couldn't help
[1:14:52] because he saw Visions watch how true he
[1:14:54] was
[1:14:56] no matter if it cost him his fellowship
[1:14:57] with his brothers he was true because he
[1:15:00] believed those dreams he believed that
[1:15:03] the dream that he had that they would
[1:15:04] all bow to him the Sheep would and it
[1:15:07] come to pass because he believed it he
[1:15:10] was a
[1:15:11] genuine
[1:15:13] believer he was in the pit but not of
[1:15:17] the
[1:15:18] pit he was in the pit but the pit didn't
[1:15:22] Define who he was
[1:15:26] he said brother Ben this isn't very
[1:15:27] important it's very
[1:15:31] important because everyone of us at some
[1:15:33] point in our life we're going to find
[1:15:34] ourselves in a low place we're going to
[1:15:37] find Ourselves cast there by other
[1:15:39] people offended hurt what do we
[1:15:44] do see the believer is never a
[1:15:47] victim of
[1:15:50] circumstances and the reason for that is
[1:15:52] because of the sovereignty of God
[1:15:55] right God knows what he's doing church
[1:15:58] and that's why David can look out and
[1:16:00] when a man's coming throwing rocks at
[1:16:01] him and they said he said I'll cut his
[1:16:03] head off and David said no maybe the
[1:16:05] Lord told him to do it because he
[1:16:07] recognized that everything he was going
[1:16:09] through it had to speak a something it
[1:16:11] had to had to be foreshadowing something
[1:16:14] and everything we're going through is
[1:16:16] speaking of something it's foreshadowing
[1:16:18] something it's building a character or
[1:16:20] something in our lives we are not
[1:16:22] victims we're Overcomers
[1:16:25] and because Joseph was an overcomer he
[1:16:27] come out of the pit he said well if if
[1:16:29] he'd have been a real if he' had been a
[1:16:30] real prophet he wouldn't have been in
[1:16:31] the pit no what made him a real prophet
[1:16:33] and a real believer was the fact he come
[1:16:35] out of the pit not that he never went in
[1:16:38] one but that he come out of the pit not
[1:16:40] that you never did anything wrong not
[1:16:42] that you ever made never made a mistake
[1:16:43] not that you never were a sinner but you
[1:16:45] come out of that condition and you moved
[1:16:47] on with
[1:16:52] God Matthew 6:24 says no man can serve
[1:16:55] two
[1:16:56] masters for either he'll hate the one
[1:16:58] and love the other or else he'll hold to
[1:17:01] the one and despise the other you cannot
[1:17:04] serve God and man or
[1:17:08] mankind men's ideas men's things a human
[1:17:14] ability therefore I say unto you take no
[1:17:16] thought for your
[1:17:17] life now that thought we know in the
[1:17:19] original is anxious thought it's not
[1:17:21] that you shouldn't have a thought about
[1:17:23] what you're going to eat tomorrow
[1:17:24] because you need a plan for that but
[1:17:27] take no thought is don't
[1:17:28] worry right can we think about it like
[1:17:30] that that's way what it is in the
[1:17:31] original don't worry for your life what
[1:17:34] you shall eat what you shall drink don't
[1:17:37] worry about your body what you shall put
[1:17:39] on your clothes is not the life more
[1:17:42] than meat and the body than
[1:17:45] rment so now watch what he says
[1:17:48] therefore now no man can serve two
[1:17:50] masters because you can't serve two
[1:17:52] masters you can't serve worry
[1:17:55] and a providential
[1:17:57] God right you can't serve worry come on
[1:18:00] Church the brandom taught us that worry
[1:18:02] is sin I know we all do it from time to
[1:18:05] time but it's still not right it's one
[1:18:07] of those things where Paul said I got to
[1:18:09] keep under my body and bring it in
[1:18:10] subjection he wasn't just talking about
[1:18:12] lust of the Flesh and things like that
[1:18:14] he was talking about worry he was
[1:18:15] talking about anxiety he was talking
[1:18:17] about the things that we go through and
[1:18:18] and are as human beings he said I'm not
[1:18:20] going to let myself give over to those
[1:18:23] things so he said therefore because you
[1:18:26] can't serve two masters take no thought
[1:18:28] don't worry he gives the examples of the
[1:18:31] birds and the lies and talks about how
[1:18:33] that God feeds them and clothes them and
[1:18:36] he says therefore therefore take no
[1:18:39] thought therefore don't worry saying
[1:18:41] what shall we eat or what shall we drink
[1:18:43] or wherewith All Shall we be clothed for
[1:18:45] after all these things do the Gentiles
[1:18:47] seek for your heavenly father knows that
[1:18:49] you have need of all these things but
[1:18:51] seek ye first the kingdom of God and his
[1:18:54] righteousness and all these things shall
[1:18:56] be added unto you it doesn't say they
[1:18:58] might be it said they would be why
[1:19:01] because you're you're in the pit but
[1:19:03] you're still Joseph you're in the pit
[1:19:05] but you're still a Believer you're in
[1:19:06] the pit but you still have a dream are
[1:19:09] you with me
[1:19:13] now I thought I us a little bit much for
[1:19:16] a Wednesday night and we're all tired
[1:19:20] but can you see what I'm trying to tell
[1:19:22] you tonight he said don't worry worry
[1:19:25] about tomorrow because tomorrow will
[1:19:27] take care of
[1:19:28] itself sufficient to the day is the evil
[1:19:32] thereof see we are not here by
[1:19:34] chance see we're not victims because
[1:19:37] we're not here by chance we're all
[1:19:39] planted and we serve a purpose see when
[1:19:43] we go out here if you go out in uh in in
[1:19:45] the fall of the year and you see a great
[1:19:47] crop of wheat or rice or cotton or
[1:19:49] whatever it is that they grow in this
[1:19:52] area if we go out and look at that crop
[1:19:55] you know when when you go out there you
[1:19:58] you see a crop of
[1:20:00] Wheat and you don't look at that and say
[1:20:03] well it's surprising to see a crop of
[1:20:05] wheat out here in the middle of nowhere
[1:20:08] but what do you assume you assume
[1:20:10] somebody planted
[1:20:13] it right I remember when we were young
[1:20:16] you know my my grandpa only had a
[1:20:18] certain amount of tools to his disposal
[1:20:20] and and he just farmed a couple hundred
[1:20:22] acres and and his crops didn't look all
[1:20:25] too good we didn't have irrigation we
[1:20:27] depended on the rain and and so it just
[1:20:30] didn't look that great and I remember
[1:20:32] going down in there and he'd grow Milo
[1:20:33] in one field because it was always too
[1:20:35] wet in the spring to grow anything else
[1:20:38] in and he would grow beans in another
[1:20:40] field and couldn't really grow any cash
[1:20:42] crops because of the nature of the soil
[1:20:44] but it was it wasn't very good but I
[1:20:46] remember going down by syon Missouri and
[1:20:49] seeing the long rows of of cotton you
[1:20:51] know that's not normal that's not
[1:20:53] natural it didn't just happen that all
[1:20:56] this Cotton's in a row right it didn't
[1:20:59] just happen that all the beans are just
[1:21:01] lined up just perfect and there's not a
[1:21:02] weed in the field what is that that's
[1:21:05] lots of effort right those crops that
[1:21:08] you see didn't come from Just Just
[1:21:11] Happening they were planted right a
[1:21:14] farmer planted them a farmer is not
[1:21:16] surprised by a good crop why because he
[1:21:20] planted it he fertilized it he watered
[1:21:23] it right he's controlling the
[1:21:26] atmospheres of it why he's Pro he's
[1:21:28] providentially he placing it and what is
[1:21:31] it the same thing is true of the
[1:21:32] Christian God is not surprised when you
[1:21:34] become a he wasn't surprised when you
[1:21:36] come to him why he planted you in him
[1:21:39] sir are you with me now I've told it
[1:21:42] before but it just fits here uh Ronald
[1:21:45] Reagan told a story about a farmer and a
[1:21:47] preacher and the farmer was was taking
[1:21:51] the preacher out on his fields and he
[1:21:52] was showing him he said here's the beans
[1:21:55] and here's the Orchards and here's all
[1:21:56] the the good things that that's happened
[1:21:59] and every time he does he goes by a
[1:22:01] field of beans and the preacher says
[1:22:02] well thanks be to God he goes by a field
[1:22:05] and he says well praise the Lord and he
[1:22:07] goes by the beans he says well oh isn't
[1:22:10] God good isn't he great and the farmer
[1:22:12] after a while he just had to say it he
[1:22:14] said but said preacher you should have
[1:22:15] seen it when the Lord had it to
[1:22:18] himself see somebody had to plan
[1:22:22] it h are you with me now I know that's
[1:22:26] humorous but somebody had to plan it see
[1:22:29] David says it this way blessed is the
[1:22:32] man that walketh not in the counsel of
[1:22:34] the ungodly nor standeth in the way of
[1:22:36] Sinners nor sth in the seat of the
[1:22:38] scornful but his Delight is in the law
[1:22:41] of the Lord in his law do he meditate
[1:22:43] day and night and he shall be now watch
[1:22:46] like a tree planted by the rivers of
[1:22:50] water that bringeth forth his fruit in
[1:22:53] his season his Leaf also shall not
[1:22:55] wither and whatsoever he doeth shall
[1:22:59] prosper how does he get in this
[1:23:01] condition he didn't it wasn't an
[1:23:03] accident that he was by the river of
[1:23:04] water he didn't even grow there
[1:23:06] naturally he was planted there are you
[1:23:09] with me now he was planted brother
[1:23:11] brandom deals with this he said what
[1:23:14] predestinated amen he said that thought
[1:23:17] of God before the foundation of the
[1:23:19] world placed him there listen to me
[1:23:21] church we got to believe in a
[1:23:23] providential god do you realize every
[1:23:24] person sitting here tonight was meant to
[1:23:27] be here you were placed here by the
[1:23:29] providential thought of God you're not a
[1:23:33] victim being here you're not a you're
[1:23:35] you're not an accident being here you're
[1:23:37] not it not just something you decided to
[1:23:39] do because you had nothing better to do
[1:23:41] but God meant for you to be here why he
[1:23:43] planted you and be in his mind before
[1:23:45] the foundation of the world that thought
[1:23:47] of God planted him there why is Allan
[1:23:50] price Allan price why is Isaac Andrews
[1:23:53] Isaac Andrews why it's Britney PR
[1:23:55] Britney PR because God planted you there
[1:23:58] in his mind before the foundation of the
[1:24:00] world he planted
[1:24:02] you are you with me
[1:24:05] now not stuck out not by chance sir but
[1:24:10] was planted
[1:24:12] predestinated to the rivers of water the
[1:24:16] farmer purposely put you by the
[1:24:20] rivers oh my look what it says about you
[1:24:23] about that that was planted but that
[1:24:25] that person that woman that was planted
[1:24:27] his root shall not wither oh
[1:24:32] Hallelujah though he dies I'll raise him
[1:24:35] up again at the last
[1:24:36] day he is predestinated to be there not
[1:24:40] just by chance he was predestined to
[1:24:42] catch that word when it was swed and
[1:24:45] she'll be right there when it sticks
[1:24:48] she's there he's planted not just stuck
[1:24:51] down he's actually planted that's right
[1:24:55] he said a lot different sticking a stick
[1:24:56] in the ground than planting something
[1:24:58] it's different the seed was planted it
[1:25:01] found its own root holes oh my it was
[1:25:06] planted by God it's rooted in God God
[1:25:09] intended for it to be there he said you
[1:25:10] were all pre-planned by God nothing
[1:25:14] happens by chance someone say
[1:25:16] nothing nothing is the pit included in
[1:25:20] nothing now that's a question you got to
[1:25:23] ask yourself and decide am I going to
[1:25:25] feel sorry for myself or am I going to
[1:25:26] come out of the pit right am I going to
[1:25:29] spend the rest of my life worrying about
[1:25:30] what this one did or what that one did
[1:25:32] or am I going to be a prince of
[1:25:33] prosperity and come out of the
[1:25:39] pit are you with me now I believe I can
[1:25:42] come out why did he come out brother B
[1:25:44] already told us he believed he could he
[1:25:46] believed the dream was still true he
[1:25:48] believed that God still loved him what
[1:25:51] are we going to do about the situations
[1:25:53] in our life are we just going to bow
[1:25:54] down to it and say well it's just got to
[1:25:56] be this way and and it's just going to
[1:25:57] happen and and well just I tried to
[1:25:59] serve God and it just didn't work out
[1:26:01] for me I tried to do what the Bible says
[1:26:03] with my family but it just didn't work
[1:26:04] out for me I tried to live for God and I
[1:26:07] I I dotted every eye and crossed every
[1:26:08] tee and it just didn't work out for me
[1:26:10] no you're not looking at it right if
[1:26:13] you've done what what what God required
[1:26:15] then you hold on to the promise say God
[1:26:17] you planted me here it will work out for
[1:26:20] me all I got to do is hold on to the
[1:26:22] word of God it will work
[1:26:25] out cuz you were
[1:26:27] planted are you with me now it takes
[1:26:31] away all the fear and
[1:26:32] scare it takes away preachers being able
[1:26:35] to put you in or
[1:26:37] out right a preacher can't tell you this
[1:26:40] that you're you're you're you're a seat
[1:26:42] of God or you're not all the preacher
[1:26:43] can do is identify fruit preach the word
[1:26:47] but it's up to you whether you're going
[1:26:48] to whether you're going to identify with
[1:26:50] that or not whether you going to put
[1:26:51] that shoe on or not that's up to you and
[1:26:54] Joseph said I refuse to be a pit person
[1:26:57] I refuse to be spend all my life
[1:26:59] thinking I belong in the pit I'm I'm in
[1:27:01] the pit but I'm not of the pit oh I wish
[1:27:04] we'd grab a hold of that tonight I may I
[1:27:06] may be in trouble but I'm not of trouble
[1:27:08] I may be in I may be in stress but I'm
[1:27:10] not of stress I may be in I may be in
[1:27:13] difficulty but I'm not of difficulty I'm
[1:27:15] a prince of prosperity I belong in the
[1:27:17] house of
[1:27:19] God brother BR said then if you're a Son
[1:27:22] of God our daughter God you were in God
[1:27:25] all the time but he knew what bed in
[1:27:27] time that you'd be
[1:27:28] planted
[1:27:30] planted oh so now you're made a creature
[1:27:32] a Son of God manifested son or daughter
[1:27:34] of God to meet the challenge of this
[1:27:36] hour to vindicate the true and living
[1:27:38] God of this hour the message is coming
[1:27:40] forth in this time he planted you here
[1:27:42] to to be the message of the hour he
[1:27:45] planted you here to represent it to
[1:27:47] Hardy
[1:27:48] Arkansas are you wh in
[1:27:50] hell and then there's no you know you
[1:27:54] you feel sorry for yourself for a minute
[1:27:55] but then you say
[1:27:57] okay
[1:27:59] okay I'm going to make
[1:28:05] it I'm going to make
[1:28:08] it I I I'm not I don't belong in this
[1:28:11] pit so God must have some way of
[1:28:13] bringing me out of
[1:28:18] it oh my the Bible tells us that the
[1:28:22] righteous shall flourish like the palm
[1:28:24] tree he shall grow like a cedar in
[1:28:27] Lebanon those that be planted there's
[1:28:29] that word again planted in the house of
[1:28:31] the Lord shall flourish in the courts of
[1:28:34] our God they shall still bring forth
[1:28:36] fruit in old age they shall be fat and
[1:28:39] flourishing to show that the Lord is
[1:28:41] upright he is my rock and there is no
[1:28:44] unrighteousness in him so Christ came to
[1:28:48] redeem those who were planted in the
[1:28:52] mind of God you believe that tonight if
[1:28:55] Christ he did he only come to redeem his
[1:28:57] own because to redeem means to buy back
[1:29:00] right you had to be his or he couldn't
[1:29:02] redeem you so you can't you can't just
[1:29:06] you say you know we want to blame people
[1:29:08] for making for not for us not being
[1:29:10] redeemed it it's not possible right
[1:29:13] because when God gets ready to affect
[1:29:15] redemption in your life it's going to
[1:29:17] happen no matter what anybody says and
[1:29:19] no matter what anybody
[1:29:21] does right because he came to redeem
[1:29:24] those that were planted in the mind of
[1:29:26] God Isaiah 61:1 the spirit of the Lord
[1:29:28] God is upon me because the Lord hath
[1:29:30] anointed me to preach Good Tidings un
[1:29:32] the meek he has sent me to bind up the
[1:29:34] Brokenhearted to Proclaim Liberty to the
[1:29:35] captives the opening of the prison to
[1:29:37] them that are bound to proclaim the
[1:29:39] acceptable year of the Lord you remember
[1:29:40] that's where he stopped because the
[1:29:42] second part was to for his second coming
[1:29:45] he said and the day of Vengeance of our
[1:29:47] God to comfort all that mourn when Jesus
[1:29:49] said this day this scripture is
[1:29:50] fulfilled he stopped at the acceptable
[1:29:52] year of the Lord but then he says to
[1:29:55] appoint unto them that mourn in Zion to
[1:29:57] give unto them Beauty for Ashes the oil
[1:29:59] of joy for mourning the Garment of
[1:30:01] Praise for the spirit of heaviness that
[1:30:03] they might be called Trees of
[1:30:05] Righteousness the planting of the
[1:30:08] Lord so when you church when you go by
[1:30:12] that field that everything's just right
[1:30:14] and every all the weeds are out what is
[1:30:16] it you you don't look at that and say
[1:30:18] well it just happened that way it's
[1:30:19] there by chance no you know somebody
[1:30:21] planted that and somebody's taken care
[1:30:23] of that and somebody's fertilized that
[1:30:25] and somebody's poured water on oh Church
[1:30:27] don't you realize brother brandom uses
[1:30:29] this term of planting and he says God
[1:30:31] will water what he
[1:30:33] plants oh
[1:30:35] hallelujah amen the planting of the Lord
[1:30:38] that he might be glorified what he
[1:30:40] planted he will keep listen to this
[1:30:41] Isaiah 27:3 you've heard brother brandom
[1:30:44] quote this many many times in the
[1:30:45] message he said I the Lord do keep it I
[1:30:49] will water it
[1:30:54] now
[1:30:55] when when when Joseph was in the pit it
[1:30:59] said there was no water in the pit but
[1:31:00] he couldn't see what God was doing God
[1:31:03] was just pouring water on his
[1:31:06] plant he just pouring water on his plant
[1:31:09] because the plant needs water so how
[1:31:11] often is he going to water it we had
[1:31:13] some some nice I forget what they're
[1:31:15] called but some nice flowers we put out
[1:31:17] in front of our house they were real
[1:31:18] nice until we left for a couple weeks
[1:31:20] and then they didn't get watered quite
[1:31:23] as often as what and W normally do and
[1:31:25] they died because they were plants that
[1:31:27] need water every day you're a plant that
[1:31:29] needs water you don't you don't do well
[1:31:33] without the presence of
[1:31:35] God but here's the good thing he
[1:31:37] promised I'll Water you you may be in
[1:31:40] the pit but I'll Water you you might be
[1:31:43] it might be a dry time but there's still
[1:31:45] water it might be no Revival anywhere
[1:31:47] but you're still you're still in Revival
[1:31:49] why he said I will water it how often
[1:31:51] church every moment
[1:31:54] oh my right now he's watering you he's
[1:31:57] pouring out his Spirit on you he he's
[1:32:00] he's affecting his presence you he said
[1:32:02] I'll Water it every moment less than he
[1:32:04] heard it I will keep it night and
[1:32:07] day he planted it he promised he would
[1:32:10] keep
[1:32:12] it and how good you take care of a thing
[1:32:15] is how well it grows you know that when
[1:32:18] you plant something years ago Mom I
[1:32:20] don't know if you remember this I
[1:32:21] planted sunflower seeds outside of our
[1:32:23] house
[1:32:24] and I planted them in kind of a bad spot
[1:32:26] because I didn't realize they need full
[1:32:28] sun so I plant them beside the house and
[1:32:30] you know half the day they were in
[1:32:32] shade but I watered them things and I
[1:32:35] took care of them things and I thought
[1:32:38] that didn't have nothing else to do you
[1:32:39] know so I I just I I can't I don't even
[1:32:42] remember how old I was but I I I wasn't
[1:32:44] doing my school work I was pouring water
[1:32:45] on them sunflower seeds and cultivating
[1:32:48] them sunflow you know what I got the
[1:32:49] great big sunflowers the great big tall
[1:32:52] ones like they have in Kansas I was so
[1:32:53] proud of that why because I took care of
[1:32:57] it I kept it every moment I gave it an
[1:32:59] undue amount of care but Christ said I'm
[1:33:01] going to give you that kind of care he
[1:33:03] said I'm going to watch you every moment
[1:33:04] I'm going to till the ground I'm going
[1:33:06] to work on you and so when you go
[1:33:08] through a trial you just know Lord I
[1:33:10] know somehow this is you working on me
[1:33:12] this is you pouring water on my life
[1:33:14] this is you helping me out of my
[1:33:15] struggle this is you bringing me to
[1:33:17] where I need to
[1:33:21] be he planted it when brother brandham
[1:33:24] uh built the Tabernacle he he quoted
[1:33:27] that scripture often because the Lord
[1:33:28] showed him that scripture I the Lord do
[1:33:30] keep it water it every moment I'll keep
[1:33:33] it de night and
[1:33:35] day and at some point at some point and
[1:33:39] it's in some times of your life you just
[1:33:42] got to ride on
[1:33:43] that you just got to trust
[1:33:46] that right you just got to say that
[1:33:48] promise is still true cuz I don't feel
[1:33:51] like it it don't it don't make sense to
[1:33:54] me but it's still true and so he tells a
[1:33:57] story about Paul Raider and how he had a
[1:34:00] dream and I heard someone quote it the
[1:34:01] other day but he tells the story about
[1:34:03] Paul Raider's dream and and how that uh
[1:34:06] Paul was out there he said his boss had
[1:34:09] told him he said or he heard the voice
[1:34:10] of his boss saying go and and cut down
[1:34:13] this tree he said it's a tree he should
[1:34:14] have been able to handle or would have
[1:34:16] been when he was younger but he said he
[1:34:18] went up there and and he cut down this
[1:34:20] tree and the tree fell and he couldn't
[1:34:22] even pick it up off the ground
[1:34:24] and he said how am I going to get this
[1:34:25] tree all the way down the mountain into
[1:34:28] that Sawmill and he's sitting there
[1:34:30] worried and
[1:34:31] discouraged and brother Brandon said he
[1:34:33] he said as he sit there he was leaning
[1:34:35] against the tree and he was weeping and
[1:34:38] he said he heard his boss speak and said
[1:34:40] Paul he said yes boss here I am but I've
[1:34:44] lost all my strength I just can't go any
[1:34:47] further I've tried to do and I've tried
[1:34:50] to obey you and do what you said do but
[1:34:52] I just can't get this thing off the
[1:34:53] ground he said I've struggled I've tried
[1:34:56] I've done every have you ever felt that
[1:34:57] way
[1:34:58] church now brother brandom takes this to
[1:35:00] preachers because it's true even as a
[1:35:02] preacher many times especially as a
[1:35:04] preacher you feel this way because you
[1:35:06] feel like you you're you're carrying all
[1:35:08] of this you're trying and you're trying
[1:35:10] and and it don't help and and you you
[1:35:13] say God what am I going to do well you
[1:35:15] just got to have confidence if the boss
[1:35:17] told you to do it you can do
[1:35:19] it but now look what he said he's
[1:35:21] sitting there weeping and he said and he
[1:35:24] said I just he said boss here I am I've
[1:35:25] lost my strength I can't go any further
[1:35:27] I've tried to obey you I've struggled
[1:35:28] I've tried I've done everything he said
[1:35:30] I just wonder if that ain't the attitude
[1:35:32] of a many good true-hearted preacher
[1:35:33] today that's long to see a church built
[1:35:36] without spot or wrinkle to see the
[1:35:38] promises of God made manifest that's all
[1:35:40] we've ever wanted to see here it's to
[1:35:42] see the promise of God because God said
[1:35:44] I'll keep it I established it I planted
[1:35:46] it I'll keep it day and night and you
[1:35:49] don't understand why when things get
[1:35:50] tough I get to feeling like Lord there
[1:35:53] must be something good around the corner
[1:35:54] there must be something good coming
[1:35:56] because when times are tough I know he
[1:35:58] will not forsake me I know he will cuz
[1:36:00] he planted this church we didn't start
[1:36:02] this church God meant for it to be
[1:36:05] here you said what's the proof of that
[1:36:08] brother Ben the proof is what we've been
[1:36:09] through the proof oh Church the proof is
[1:36:12] where we came
[1:36:14] from can't you look at your own life
[1:36:17] that way if that can give me confidence
[1:36:18] in the church look what you've been
[1:36:20] through look what you came from look
[1:36:22] what you were look what you are now it
[1:36:23] gives you confidence to say I know you
[1:36:26] planted this tree I know you planted
[1:36:28] this life I'm going to make it out of
[1:36:38] here I can't say I didn't identify with
[1:36:40] this quote so we've tussled and tried
[1:36:44] screamed and cried and preached till we
[1:36:47] was horse laid on our pillows and wept
[1:36:50] oh God why is it just when we get
[1:36:52] straightened up that end comes the death
[1:36:53] and bust up and tears up just knocks
[1:36:55] down everything we got what can we do
[1:36:58] when we see our lovely people and how
[1:36:59] they'd be scattered and gone about like
[1:37:00] that but Paul Raider he he looked at
[1:37:03] around and he said he turned to look at
[1:37:05] his boss but it wasn't his boss it was
[1:37:07] Jesus he said he looked because he spoke
[1:37:10] gentle to him Oh my he said Paul you're
[1:37:14] just struggling yourself to death that
[1:37:17] won't do you any good he said Paul don't
[1:37:19] you see that little stream of water
[1:37:21] running there he said yeah' he said just
[1:37:24] pitch the thing in there get on it and
[1:37:27] ride it on down to the camp it goes to
[1:37:30] the camp what is that the promise will
[1:37:33] fulfill
[1:37:36] itself church it's the promise is
[1:37:39] already on its way to fulfillment all
[1:37:41] you got to do is believe in it all you
[1:37:43] got to do is get on it and ride on
[1:37:46] it amen he said I jumped up and rolled
[1:37:49] the log in and jumped on the log went
[1:37:51] down over the riffle just a screaming to
[1:37:53] the top my voice screaming I'm riding on
[1:37:55] it I'm riding on it I'm riding on it and
[1:37:57] when he come to himself he was right out
[1:37:58] in the middle of the floor his wife
[1:38:00] screaming at the top of her voice he was
[1:38:01] out in the middle of the floor saying
[1:38:02] I'm riding on it I'm riding on it I'm
[1:38:04] riding on it he said brother and sister
[1:38:06] I know the trials are hard I'm getting
[1:38:07] old and I've preached I've done
[1:38:08] everything I know to do I've got to a
[1:38:10] place where I see I can't do no more
[1:38:12] I've just laid the whole thing in the
[1:38:13] lap of the Lord Jesus and I'm riding on
[1:38:15] it oh church can you say Amen to that
[1:38:17] tonight I'm riding on it I'm riding on
[1:38:19] the promise we're going to make it all
[1:38:21] the way
[1:38:25] I'm writing on God's promise I the Lord
[1:38:28] hath planted it I water it day and night
[1:38:33] and then brother brandham adds another
[1:38:34] scripture on to that scripture as he
[1:38:36] many times does and I'll read it in just
[1:38:38] a moment he said let's some should pluck
[1:38:40] it from my hand God's church WIll
[1:38:43] endure
[1:38:46] forever hallelujah oh that gives me
[1:38:49] confidence Church the word of God will
[1:38:52] stand in emphatically right
[1:38:56] forever and regardless if kingdoms come
[1:38:59] or atomic bombs fall or America
[1:39:03] backslides come on Church regardless
[1:39:06] what happens in the election whatever
[1:39:09] takes place this is his
[1:39:12] word I the Lord will water it amen I the
[1:39:17] Lord have planted it I will water it day
[1:39:19] and night I'll keep it lest any should
[1:39:21] hurt it he said and this is his he keeps
[1:39:23] said I'm riding on it I believe it with
[1:39:25] all my heart oh do you believe it church
[1:39:28] he said Joseph believed it and it
[1:39:30] brought him up out of the pit he was the
[1:39:32] prince of
[1:39:33] prosperity John 10:27 said my sheep hear
[1:39:36] my voice I know them and they follow me
[1:39:38] this is the the verse that brother
[1:39:40] Brandon puts now with with the other one
[1:39:42] where it says I'll keep it day and night
[1:39:44] he said I give unto them eternal life
[1:39:46] and they shall never perish neither
[1:39:47] shall any man pluck them out of my
[1:39:51] hand Hallelujah
[1:39:54] My Father which gave them to me is
[1:39:57] greater than
[1:39:58] all no man is able to pluck them out of
[1:40:04] my
[1:40:05] father's
[1:40:08] hand so you say well I got plucked out
[1:40:10] of the father's hand because of a person
[1:40:12] no you
[1:40:13] didn't the devil told you you
[1:40:16] did but you didn't get plucked out of
[1:40:18] the father's hand because of a
[1:40:21] person are you with me now because of
[1:40:24] something somebody said or somebody did
[1:40:27] you belong to
[1:40:29] God Jesus went to the pit do you know
[1:40:32] that see Joseph's life was a
[1:40:34] foreshadowing brother said it was for
[1:40:36] knowledge of
[1:40:37] Christ Jesus went to the pit he actually
[1:40:41] went to
[1:40:43] hell how many know that tonight 1 Peter
[1:40:46] 318 for Christ also has once suffered
[1:40:48] for sins the just for the unjust that he
[1:40:50] might bring us to God being put to death
[1:40:52] in the flesh but quickened by the Spirit
[1:40:55] by which also the spirit he went and
[1:40:57] preached unto the spirits in prison he
[1:41:00] preached unto the spirits in prison
[1:41:03] which sometime were disobedient when
[1:41:04] Once the longsuffering of God waited in
[1:41:06] the days of Noah while the ark was a
[1:41:08] preparing where in few that his eight
[1:41:10] Souls were saved by
[1:41:12] water and so Joseph is in the pit he's
[1:41:16] in the pit for shadowing something Jesus
[1:41:19] had to stay in the grave brother brandom
[1:41:21] tells in one place that the promise
[1:41:23] barred Christ from leaving the tomb
[1:41:27] until the
[1:41:28] time oh my the promise actually kept him
[1:41:32] in the grave until the time the same as
[1:41:34] uh the same resurrection power was in
[1:41:35] him but the promise barred him until the
[1:41:38] the the time was up right the same with
[1:41:41] our loved ones who have went away right
[1:41:43] they're in the they're they're they're
[1:41:44] in the grave or we say they're in
[1:41:46] Paradise or they're not Paradise they're
[1:41:48] waiting in that Dimension that sixth
[1:41:50] Dimension they're waiting on us but what
[1:41:52] are they doing there why why are they
[1:41:54] there why why haven't they already come
[1:41:55] back because the promise bars what
[1:41:57] promise we which are alive and
[1:42:00] remain right our bodies had to be
[1:42:03] changed right and they're raised at that
[1:42:05] time so that promise bars until the time
[1:42:08] so the promise B him to the time but
[1:42:10] while he was in there he wasn't just
[1:42:12] laying there idle but he actually goes
[1:42:16] into the pit Oh my he goes into oh
[1:42:19] church he preached to the souls in
[1:42:21] prison and brother brandham taught us
[1:42:23] said he went to that pit to witness that
[1:42:25] the word was
[1:42:27] true right he goes to the pit to preach
[1:42:29] to those who didn't repent to Noah's in
[1:42:32] Noah's day and he said the word is true
[1:42:34] that Noah was preaching those that
[1:42:36] didn't repent in in Adam's day those
[1:42:38] that didn't repent in Enoch day those
[1:42:39] that didn't repent in every prophet's
[1:42:41] day he goes down he preaches to them and
[1:42:43] he says now remember remember they told
[1:42:46] you there was one coming they spoke
[1:42:48] there was one coming and I am him
[1:42:54] hallelujah what was he doing proving to
[1:42:57] them witnessing that the word was true
[1:43:01] and then he would go and you know the
[1:43:02] story he' take the keys away from the
[1:43:05] devil kick him back down into hell and
[1:43:08] empty Paradise as a mighty conqueror on
[1:43:10] the way
[1:43:10] out oh my and brother Bram says this he
[1:43:14] said oh I'm so glad I have the promise
[1:43:16] of God so
[1:43:19] infallible that he went to hell to Wi
[1:43:23] witnessed to
[1:43:25] it I'm going somewhere with this then
[1:43:27] we'll close he witnessed to the souls in
[1:43:30] prison he was the one the prophet spoke
[1:43:31] of he was the woman's seed he was the
[1:43:34] Messiah they rejected listen if Joseph
[1:43:36] was in the pit there had to be a reason
[1:43:38] because he was Joseph Prince of
[1:43:40] prosperity if you find Jesus uh wi or or
[1:43:43] in Hell there has to be a reason he's
[1:43:45] there right there had to be a reason
[1:43:48] remember all the other ones that went
[1:43:50] never come out they couldn't come out
[1:43:52] but he came
[1:43:54] out glory to God and the fact that
[1:43:57] Joseph come out of the pit proved who he
[1:43:59] was and the fact that Jesus rose again
[1:44:01] on the third day proved who he was and
[1:44:04] so he goes down to witness to him and
[1:44:06] say I'm I'm him you he you couldn't kill
[1:44:09] me you couldn't defeat me I am the
[1:44:13] purpose of
[1:44:14] God
[1:44:16] hallelujah oh my if you listen if if
[1:44:19] Joseph went to the pit there had to be a
[1:44:21] reason if the Son of God went to hell
[1:44:23] there had to be reason if you go through
[1:44:25] the trial of your life there must be a
[1:44:31] reason why because God has planted you
[1:44:34] why has he planted you there as a
[1:44:38] witness why did he put you in leoa as a
[1:44:42] witness and we're here now come on
[1:44:45] church you can go to souls that are in
[1:44:46] prison now you could go to brother
[1:44:48] brandom having that Vision or that trans
[1:44:50] where he sees the women and he sees the
[1:44:52] way that they're acting in the JC Penny
[1:44:54] store you remember the story right I
[1:44:56] know that's deep but you just think
[1:44:57] about it for a minute he's he's dealing
[1:45:00] with Souls that are in prison now that
[1:45:02] are in prison in Satan's Eden and we
[1:45:05] were put here in the
[1:45:07] pit are you with me now what's true of
[1:45:09] the groom must be true of the Bride we
[1:45:11] were put here in the pit to witness to
[1:45:14] Leona to witness to the devil this is us
[1:45:18] this is the bride oh church cuz many
[1:45:21] might have fell by the wayside but I
[1:45:23] didn't many might have gave up but you
[1:45:25] didn't many might have let Church
[1:45:27] problems get to them many might have let
[1:45:29] might have let little things they found
[1:45:31] in the message little things about
[1:45:32] brother brandom that they found this out
[1:45:34] on the Internet or that on the internet
[1:45:35] they might let that get to them but
[1:45:37] there would be a people who would
[1:45:38] believe the word of God with all of
[1:45:39] their heart and in the pit they would
[1:45:41] witness to the people in the pit to the
[1:45:44] souls in prison and say I am
[1:45:48] she come on
[1:45:51] Church got to be a reason
[1:45:54] why where we're
[1:45:56] at it's a it's a terrible
[1:46:01] age you might say hell has enlarged
[1:46:06] herself it's all around us they made it
[1:46:09] almost impossible to
[1:46:11] work almost impossible to raise
[1:46:14] children almost
[1:46:16] impossible but it was almost impossible
[1:46:18] for Joseph to come out of the pit and
[1:46:21] end up on the throne
[1:46:23] but it wasn't impossible why because he
[1:46:25] was Joseph you know what it was it was
[1:46:27] probable it wasn't just probable it was
[1:46:31] guaranteed somebody ought to preach on
[1:46:33] that but the Joel when the impossible
[1:46:35] becomes the
[1:46:37] guarantee when it becomes a guarantee
[1:46:39] when did it become a guarantee because
[1:46:41] it it was Joseph in the pit anybody else
[1:46:44] in the pit they might have died anybody
[1:46:46] else in the pit they might have ended
[1:46:47] their life in obscurity and savior but
[1:46:49] not Joseph he was the prince of
[1:46:50] prosperity and not the bride you will
[1:46:52] not end that way this bride will not be
[1:46:55] defeated I don't care what's going on in
[1:46:57] the message and how discouraged you get
[1:46:59] by people you just remember that I the
[1:47:03] Lord have planted it I'll Water it day
[1:47:07] and night right people might come
[1:47:10] brother the har we see over the years
[1:47:11] you see people come and go and come and
[1:47:13] go come and go but he said I the Lord
[1:47:17] have planted brother Harold are you with
[1:47:19] me now I'll Water it day and night
[1:47:22] somebody's going to make
[1:47:24] it oh church and you're a witness today
[1:47:27] of what God can
[1:47:29] do
[1:47:31] Hallelujah sorry for keeping you long
[1:47:33] tonight Joseph wasn't in the pit to stay
[1:47:36] in the pit Jesus wasn't in the pit to
[1:47:38] stay in the pit he was just passing
[1:47:41] through but he was a witness he was
[1:47:44] passing through the pit got to Hell
[1:47:45] brother brand brother brand said when he
[1:47:47] got down where Satan was Satan said oh
[1:47:48] now I've got him he said no you don't
[1:47:51] kicked in the door of Hell grabbed the
[1:47:52] key off of his side kicked him back down
[1:47:54] into heaven and and come up the mighty
[1:47:56] conqueror why because it was written in
[1:47:59] the word I will not leave thy soul in
[1:48:01] hell I will not suffer my Holy One to
[1:48:03] see corruption and on the strength of
[1:48:05] belief and faith in that promise he went
[1:48:08] down believing and he come up a Victor
[1:48:10] the mighty conqueror listen Church you
[1:48:11] and I may be in leod deia but we're
[1:48:13] going to come out of the pit we're going
[1:48:15] to come out of Satan's Eden and we're
[1:48:17] going to come out with our shoes on
[1:48:18] we're going to come out Victorious we're
[1:48:20] going to come out doing what God Said
[1:48:23] we're going to come out a bride without
[1:48:24] spot or
[1:48:25] wrinkle who has the voice of God in her
[1:48:29] are you hearing me who the final voice
[1:48:31] to the final age because we cannot
[1:48:35] stay in the pit we're here to overcome
[1:48:38] it Joseph was in the pit to overcome it
[1:48:41] Jesus was in hell to overcome it we are
[1:48:45] in Leo to Sea to overcome
[1:48:47] it in your own personal life you might
[1:48:49] be and what you feel like is Hell on
[1:48:52] Earth but you're there to overcome
[1:48:54] it Paul says that this way as the
[1:48:56] musicians come for you for I reckon I
[1:48:59] like that that the sufferings of this
[1:49:02] present time are not
[1:49:07] worthy how could Paul say that in
[1:49:12] Chains rats running across his
[1:49:16] feet you know what rats do when you
[1:49:18] can't scare them away eventually they
[1:49:20] come start eating taking a bite
[1:49:25] he sit there he can't do nothing about
[1:49:27] it he's dictating letters writing oh my
[1:49:32] tell them because they allowed him to
[1:49:33] have a scribe in there and he'd tell
[1:49:34] them I
[1:49:36] reckon glory to God I'm so glad this
[1:49:40] Bible wasn't written by
[1:49:41] Angels so glad it was written by men who
[1:49:44] went through some things women who went
[1:49:45] through some things that that their
[1:49:47] stories were told in
[1:49:48] it I reckon that the sufferings of this
[1:49:51] present time are not worth worthy to be
[1:49:53] compared with the glory which shall be
[1:49:57] revealed in
[1:49:59] us hallelujah you may be in a pit but
[1:50:03] you're not of
[1:50:04] it you may be in a bad political
[1:50:07] situation but you're not of it you're
[1:50:09] coming out to sit on the
[1:50:12] throne oh hope you can see it
[1:50:18] church it's had to become personal to me
[1:50:21] and I trust it'll be become personal to
[1:50:23] you too I'm here to overcome I'm not
[1:50:27] here to give in I'm not here to give up
[1:50:29] I'm here to overcome so let whatever
[1:50:32] happens going to happen I believe that
[1:50:35] if if they take me out of the pit to
[1:50:37] sell me into slavery that that must be
[1:50:39] the word of God in my life coming to
[1:50:43] fulfillment and when I get in Piper's
[1:50:46] house and start to raise a little bit if
[1:50:47] they lie on me and I have to run away
[1:50:49] and they put me in prison it must be
[1:50:52] God's bringing bringing me
[1:50:53] closer to the throne because the Way Up
[1:50:57] Is
[1:50:59] Down Hallelujah let's bow our heads
[1:51:07] [Music]
[1:51:16] together there's two things you can do
[1:51:18] in the pit you
[1:51:20] can you can be buried by the
[1:51:23] dirt people are throwing or you can
[1:51:26] stomp on that dirt until it gets so high
[1:51:29] that you just walk out of
[1:51:35] it the fact that Joseph ends up being
[1:51:39] the instrument of
[1:51:41] Mercy to his Brethren that threw him in
[1:51:44] the pit is
[1:51:47] proof he was the prince of
[1:51:50] prosperity he had the mature it the the
[1:51:54] character fit to rule brother brandom
[1:51:57] taught us power without character is
[1:51:59] satanic but Power with character is fit
[1:52:03] to rule that's what I want church that's
[1:52:05] what he's working on and it may be seem
[1:52:08] hard right now but you're coming out
[1:52:10] you've got to because of who you are and
[1:52:13] you got to believe that if you believe
[1:52:15] it with all your heart he'll bring you
[1:52:16] out and he'll set you on his throne I
[1:52:19] believe he's done that I I believe we're
[1:52:21] spiritually now reigning it's Kings and
[1:52:23] Priests one day we'll be with him on his
