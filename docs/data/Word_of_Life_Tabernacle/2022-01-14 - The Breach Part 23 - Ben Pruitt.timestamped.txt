[2:26] of the hour
[2:27] we're going to look into that again
[2:28] tonight matthew chapter 25 and verse 1.
[2:31] i want to speak to you
[2:34] about the wise and foolish virgin but
[2:36] this is not an all
[2:38] in encompassing study tonight we'll have
[2:41] to get back into this at some point
[2:43] i feel like i've got a little bit of a
[2:44] rebound it may be
[2:46] just me
[2:47] you can actually turn these off if you
[2:49] want to i've got the thing in my ear
[2:52] that may help
[2:54] matthew chapter 25 and verse 1
[2:57] but we won't be able to cover all this
[2:59] tonight so we'll just get a little bit
[3:01] into it as it pertains to the sermon
[3:03] brother branham brought us on the breach
[3:06] it says then shall the kingdom of heaven
[3:07] be likened unto ten virgins which took
[3:10] their lamps and went forth to meet the
[3:12] bridegroom notice they were all going to
[3:14] meet the bridegroom they were all
[3:16] looking for a rapture we could say it
[3:18] that way
[3:19] and five of them were wise and five were
[3:21] foolish
[3:22] they that were foolish took their lamps
[3:24] and took no oil with them
[3:26] but the wise took oil in their vessels
[3:29] with their lamps
[3:30] when the bridegroom tarried or while the
[3:32] bridegroom terry they all slumbered and
[3:35] slept and at midnight there was a cry
[3:38] made
[3:39] behold the bridegroom cometh
[3:41] go you out to meet him i believe we've
[3:43] heard that midnight cry
[3:46] for seven then all those virgins arose
[3:48] and trimmed their lamps and the foolish
[3:50] said unto the wise
[3:51] give us of your oil for our lamps are
[3:53] gone out but the wise answered saying
[3:56] not so lest there be not enough for us
[3:58] and you but go ye rather to them that
[4:00] sell and buy for yourselves
[4:03] and while they went to buy
[4:05] the bridegroom came
[4:07] and they that were ready i want to be in
[4:09] that group don't you
[4:11] they that were ready went in with him to
[4:13] the marriage and the door was shut
[4:15] afterward came also the other virgin
[4:17] saying lord lord open to us
[4:19] and he answered and said verily i say
[4:21] unto you i know you not
[4:23] watch therefore
[4:25] for you know not neither the day nor the
[4:28] hour
[4:29] wherein the son of man
[4:31] cometh amen i pray the lord would add
[4:33] his blessing to the word you may be
[4:35] seated
[4:37] we're going to pick up on our study of
[4:38] the breach it's been a few weeks since
[4:40] we've dealt with this
[4:43] but brother branham is dealing with this
[4:45] breach or gap between the church ages
[4:47] and the seals in the book of revelation
[4:50] and he does not yet know when he's
[4:52] preaching this what the mystery behind
[4:54] each individual seal
[4:57] is and that'll be important as we go on
[4:59] here tonight
[5:00] but in paragraph 251 of that sermon
[5:02] brother branham said now in the
[5:04] sevenfold book of seals of redemption
[5:06] that the lamb took within himself
[5:08] was the only one who could do it
[5:11] and he took it from the right hand of
[5:13] him that said upon the throne
[5:16] he said to claim his redemptive to claim
[5:18] his rights to claim for me and you
[5:22] what he redeemed us from two he said see
[5:25] back to everything that adam lost in the
[5:28] garden of eden so we're being restored
[5:30] back further
[5:32] than just to pentecost but back to the
[5:34] garden of eden
[5:35] and that this is important that
[5:37] redemption is already finished
[5:40] he's already redeemed us back
[5:43] right we just haven't gone that gotten
[5:45] back there yet but he has redeemed us
[5:47] back
[5:48] right we're going there he's already
[5:50] done it's a finished work he doesn't
[5:52] have to die
[5:53] again
[5:54] he said now with the lamb with the book
[5:56] in his hands we are ready to ask his
[5:58] grace and mercy upon us to open the
[6:00] seven seal book to us and let us look
[6:03] past the curtain of time just a little
[6:04] bit he said oh my notice when he took
[6:07] the book the title deed sealed he said
[6:09] just get that in your mind now and broke
[6:12] the seals of the mystery to reveal them
[6:14] to bring them to all of his redeemed
[6:16] subjects
[6:17] he said now when we hit this in the
[6:19] seals we're going to go back there and
[6:21] see them souls under the altar crying
[6:23] lord how long how long and here he is as
[6:26] a mediator on the altar just a little
[6:28] longer until there's more has to suffer
[6:31] like you now
[6:32] again when brother branham says this he
[6:33] doesn't yet know that these are the jews
[6:37] and this is a great way if someone comes
[6:39] to you and says well brother branham
[6:40] just repeated a bunch of things he heard
[6:43] well why does he preach it one way
[6:44] before the seal is revealed in a
[6:47] different way after he's not just
[6:49] repeating something he's heard he's
[6:51] receiving revelation from the angel of
[6:53] the lord
[6:54] and that angel brings that breaks that
[6:57] seal to him the day
[6:58] that he preaches it
[7:00] that's very different from the way a
[7:02] theologian or even a pastor would
[7:04] approach
[7:06] the opening of the seals or or
[7:08] revelation of the word we would go and
[7:10] study brother joe and we would we we
[7:12] would feel the pressure of studying but
[7:13] the random did do that but it was up to
[7:16] the lord the lamb opened the book
[7:18] right and gave the mystery of it to the
[7:21] seventh angel here on the earth and so
[7:23] it's very different from the way that i
[7:25] would approach it any other theologian
[7:26] would approach it why he was a prophet
[7:29] that's why we read the things that
[7:31] brother branham said we put them on the
[7:33] screen we don't do that for me
[7:36] right ain't nobody out there collecting
[7:38] my sayings and writing them down put
[7:40] them down maybe if somebody does i mean
[7:42] that's fine but it wouldn't do you a
[7:43] whole lot of good because i'm not a
[7:45] prophet but brother branham was a
[7:47] prophet
[7:49] and he had the the insight of a prophet
[7:52] into these things not only a prophet but
[7:55] the seventh angel that was the one that
[7:57] was to reveal these seals
[7:59] amen now
[8:01] he here he he said
[8:02] he is a mediator on the altar just a
[8:04] little longer until there's more suffer
[8:06] like you he said but now he comes from
[8:08] here at this last seal he's no more
[8:10] mediator he's king now he said what does
[8:13] he do if he's a king he has to have
[8:16] subjects
[8:17] and his subject says them that he is
[8:19] redeemed aren't you glad to be subjects
[8:21] of the king tonight
[8:23] what that means is you're not just
[8:24] american subjects you're not just
[8:26] subjects of of the nation you live in
[8:28] but you're subject of a king and that
[8:30] means that you benefit from being the
[8:33] citizenship of that country amen there's
[8:35] a there's a sermon right there now
[8:38] he says his subject is him that he has
[8:40] redeemed and they cannot come before him
[8:43] until he takes the rights of redemption
[8:45] and now he walks forth from a mediator
[8:48] where death put us in the grave he comes
[8:50] forth with the rights and even those who
[8:53] are alive and remain until it's coming
[8:55] shall not hinder them which are asleep
[8:57] for the trumpet of god shall sound at
[8:59] that last trumpet and i know i'm
[9:01] hurrying through this but we're getting
[9:02] somewhere this this evening he said when
[9:04] the last seal was broken when the
[9:06] seventh angel is giving his message the
[9:08] last trumpet shall sound and the dead in
[9:10] christ shall rise and we which are alive
[9:12] and remain shall be caught up together
[9:14] with them to meet him in the air he
[9:15] claims he's come forth now to claim his
[9:17] possession again notice he says it as if
[9:20] it's happening right then but once the
[9:22] seals are open we begin to realize it's
[9:24] a process of time and we're living in
[9:27] that process of time today he said watch
[9:29] look at this he said my broke the seals
[9:31] revealed the mysteries revealed them
[9:33] where to the last church age the only
[9:35] one that's living the rest of them is
[9:37] sleeping he said if he comes in the
[9:38] first watch second watch third watch on
[9:40] down
[9:41] to the seventh watch
[9:43] and that's midnight hour the seventh
[9:45] watch in the seventh watch there went
[9:47] out a command or a call
[9:49] behold the bridegroom
[9:51] cometh
[9:52] i'm going to sew down here and we're
[9:53] going to go through this carefully he
[9:55] said and when they did he said the
[9:57] sleeping virgin the nominal churches
[10:01] and there's a lot of of
[10:03] back and forth about who the sleeping
[10:05] virgin are
[10:07] i believe from looking at the message of
[10:09] the hour that brother branham taught
[10:11] that they were the nominal churches
[10:13] or they come from that group i think it
[10:15] would be difficult for us to be foolish
[10:17] virgin
[10:18] because of how much we know
[10:21] right we want to be in the bride
[10:23] i know there's a teaching out there that
[10:24] the foolish virgin has to come from the
[10:26] message of the hour i don't understand
[10:28] that i know that brother branham thought
[10:30] that they come from the nominal churches
[10:32] and i i'll take his word on that now
[10:35] he said you know he said i believe now
[10:37] watch what these nominal churches are
[10:39] doing
[10:40] they're coming and they're saying
[10:41] give us of your oil remember that's what
[10:44] the that's what the sleeping virgin was
[10:46] saying actually the sleeping virgin was
[10:48] all of them
[10:49] they were all asleep but the foolish
[10:51] virgin
[10:52] come and they said give us of your oil
[10:55] we want some we want this holy ghost
[10:58] right now we've been preaching on the
[11:00] holy ghost and this is going to tie
[11:01] right into that
[11:03] now they said you know i believe i'd
[11:05] like to have that holy ghost
[11:07] that's the hour
[11:09] right now he said have you noticed the
[11:11] presbyterians
[11:12] and episcopalians and he goes all the
[11:15] way down
[11:16] i just love the accuracy of the word of
[11:18] god and we'll show you in a minute how
[11:19] accurate it is he said have you noticed
[11:22] the presbyterians
[11:24] and the episcopalians that's the
[11:25] anglican church
[11:27] he said did you hear my message in
[11:28] phoenix to them men who stand up there
[11:31] in the voice that was the businessman's
[11:33] voice which was the paper put out by the
[11:36] full gospel businessman brother
[11:37] demysticarian's group
[11:39] he said well
[11:40] he said what's the matter
[11:42] with this author saying holy
[11:45] father so and so when the bible said
[11:48] call no man father like that
[11:51] he said see they're sleeping with them
[11:53] that's the reason
[11:54] he said but when they come forth
[11:56] and said yeah we believe
[11:59] give us some of that holy ghost
[12:02] boy that's not the hour we live in
[12:06] now i'm going to break from this because
[12:07] brother branham if you go back there he
[12:09] said did you hear my message in phoenix
[12:12] brother branham actually addresses this
[12:13] two nights in a row he's pretty stirred
[12:15] up about it
[12:16] when he preaches uh investments and
[12:19] influence in phoenix in 1962
[12:24] and he actually
[12:26] said
[12:26] he addresses him directly
[12:28] he says i noticed in your full gospel
[12:30] businessmen he said how you bring in
[12:32] father so and so the presbyterian you
[12:35] bring in father so and so the catholic
[12:37] and all this
[12:38] he said by the way they're not fathers
[12:40] the bible said call no man father on
[12:42] this earth they're ministers
[12:45] he said and i respect them in every
[12:46] respect they can be respected but you're
[12:49] not to call them father
[12:51] he said and you businessmen i hope that
[12:53] editor is here this morning he says
[12:56] what's funny is later on
[12:59] the editor may have actually been there
[13:01] i don't know but he was in one of
[13:02] brother branham's later sermons because
[13:04] brother demas actually
[13:06] actually introduces him to brother
[13:08] branham in one of the later services by
[13:10] name
[13:11] so we actually know the name of the
[13:12] editor but he said i hope that editor is
[13:15] here this morning he said how come you
[13:17] write a declaration on the back of what
[13:19] your creeds are
[13:21] and things like that and be inner
[13:23] denomination
[13:24] he said you better get out of that
[13:28] that's pretty straight warning from a
[13:29] prophet isn't it
[13:31] there's a reason for it
[13:34] again the next night
[13:36] in that was in influence and investments
[13:38] he said what's the matter with you
[13:39] pentecostal people calling these here
[13:40] fellows father
[13:42] he said i see it in your magazine what's
[13:44] the matter with that editor anyhow
[13:47] why i hated the editor
[13:51] a guy squirming in his shoes his seat
[13:54] wherever he's at what's the matter with
[13:56] that editor anyhow thought you were
[13:57] pentecostal
[13:59] get up here and say holy father so and
[14:01] so he said the bible said call no man
[14:03] father like that you got one father
[14:04] that's jesus christ what's the matter he
[14:07] said see what i'm telling you he said
[14:09] the weeds done got you
[14:11] you better cut the thing away right now
[14:13] he said you better listen to what i'm
[14:15] telling you he said you might not want
[14:17] to do it because i'm an ignoramus
[14:20] he said but i'm not as ignorant maybe as
[14:22] you think i am
[14:24] so glad god sent a prophet
[14:26] he said see he said i may be maybe god
[14:29] has to take something ignorant
[14:31] he said see
[14:33] listen to a prophet people say this
[14:34] message isn't accurate i'm going to show
[14:36] you the accuracy of this message as it
[14:38] pertains to this tonight he said i he
[14:40] said by his grace he said i see it
[14:43] coming i see the handwriting on the wall
[14:47] he said straighten up or you're going
[14:49] out
[14:52] and in each of those sermons brother
[14:54] branham goes on to explain
[14:55] about the foolish virgin looking to buy
[14:58] oil now
[15:00] i've got a picture
[15:02] this is actually a screenshot of the
[15:04] full gospel businessman's voice this is
[15:06] actually their latest issue now
[15:09] what was what was the foolish virgin
[15:11] doing they were saying give us of your
[15:13] oil
[15:15] right give us of your oil we want the
[15:16] holy ghost
[15:18] and what the full gospel businessmen
[15:21] were was an organization started by
[15:23] demon shakarian that believed in in the
[15:25] baptism of the holy ghost but they were
[15:27] ecumenical in the sense that they were
[15:29] interdenominational they believed that
[15:31] they wanted to expose the holy ghost to
[15:33] all kinds of different people
[15:35] through businessmen because the
[15:37] preachers all were all divided and
[15:38] things and so that's why there were
[15:39] catholics sitting there brother branham
[15:41] would be preaching it's just an odd
[15:43] thing right you'd have brother branham
[15:44] you'd have a jewish rabbi you'd have a
[15:46] catholic priest you'd have all these
[15:48] because they were all part of this
[15:49] businessmen but what they were was
[15:51] pentecostal
[15:54] and so in their latest issue you can see
[15:56] that they still and i highlighted that
[15:58] there their mission statement is still
[16:00] to help believers to be baptized in the
[16:03] holy spirit that's what they wanted to
[16:05] do
[16:05] and that's what they believe that they
[16:07] got done
[16:09] now this was the precursor or the very
[16:11] beginnings of what we would call the
[16:13] charismatic movement you don't hear as
[16:15] much about it today but it was really
[16:17] big in the 60s 70s and 80s and now
[16:20] now almost all the churches are
[16:22] swallowed up in that and so you don't
[16:24] really call them charismatics anymore
[16:26] although there are still churches that
[16:28] identify like that but they've got all
[16:29] kinds of different names
[16:31] but it's that charismatic movement and
[16:33] it grew out of the pentecostal movement
[16:35] what a charismatic is and forgive me if
[16:37] you're a charismatic here tonight or or
[16:39] if you're watching and you're a
[16:40] charismatic but as far as i can tell
[16:42] what a charismatic is it's a pentecostal
[16:45] with no doctrine
[16:47] right so you believe in the gifts of the
[16:49] spirit you believe in the baptism of the
[16:51] holy ghost but it don't matter if you're
[16:52] oneness or trinity it doesn't matter if
[16:54] you're baptist it doesn't matter if
[16:55] you're catholic it doesn't matter what
[16:57] you are you just say you believe in
[16:58] christ and then you get filled with the
[17:00] spirit and speak in tongues
[17:02] right and that's charismatic
[17:04] so it's no doctrine at all that was
[17:06] useful in its beginnings to brother
[17:08] branham very useful because they didn't
[17:10] come against him as hard as many of the
[17:13] mainline churches did but iran had
[17:15] already been kicked out of many of the
[17:16] mainline churches as far as being a
[17:18] speaker they would never use them at
[17:20] their at their campaigns and things and
[17:22] yet brother randall was able to present
[17:23] this message to people he would have
[17:25] never been able to present it to because
[17:27] of the full gospel businessmen and he
[17:29] had an association with brother demas
[17:31] from 1948 all the way to the very end of
[17:34] his life
[17:35] brother demas was there all through that
[17:37] time
[17:38] you think about that man saw a lot
[17:41] he saw more than anybody else probably
[17:44] outside of maybe brother billy paul did
[17:46] of all the people that were around
[17:47] brother branham he was there that whole
[17:50] time
[17:52] now
[17:53] she demonstration was an interesting man
[17:55] he used his organizational abilities to
[17:58] facilitate evangelistic campaigns
[18:00] in particular working with
[18:02] uh evangelist charles s price and
[18:04] william branham tommy hicks and oral
[18:06] roberts
[18:07] he spent most of his adult life built he
[18:09] was a very wealthy man actually started
[18:11] a dairy and the lord blessed him and he
[18:13] became very wealthy there in california
[18:15] and he spent most of his adult life
[18:17] building the fellowship
[18:18] of this full gospel businessman
[18:21] he also played a key role in working
[18:23] with paul crouch let me know who paul
[18:25] crouch is
[18:27] paul crouch is deceased now paul crouch
[18:29] was the founder of tbn
[18:31] trinity broadcasting network trinity
[18:33] broadcasting network is the best example
[18:35] of what a charismatic church is or
[18:37] charismatic network because that's what
[18:39] they do is they uh they believe in the
[18:42] spirit but there's not much you can hear
[18:44] just about anything on there
[18:46] but as long as the gifts of the spirit
[18:47] that's what they play up the most
[18:50] well demonstration actually helped start
[18:52] that
[18:53] joel osteen how many you've heard of
[18:55] joel osteen
[18:56] god smiles a lot he's the big thing now
[18:58] joel osteen's father was named john
[19:00] osteen the reason john was able to make
[19:04] it as a tent evangelist john osteen was
[19:06] a pentecostal evangelist you couldn't
[19:08] hardly tell that from joel osteen now
[19:10] but john was a pentecostal evangelist
[19:12] and demonstration played a key role in
[19:15] saving his ministry i'm going into this
[19:17] for a reason so just hang with me
[19:19] tonight
[19:20] and and so john was actually removed as
[19:23] a pastor because he believed in
[19:24] pentecost and demus shakarian caught a
[19:28] flight to go see him and convinced him
[19:30] not to quit but to start his own
[19:32] ministry and actually funded the
[19:34] launching of the tent meetings that john
[19:36] so demonstration is directly responsible
[19:39] for joel osteen today because joel
[19:42] osteen just took over his father's
[19:44] church and grew it bigger
[19:46] by having no doctrine
[19:50] right
[19:51] and that's basically how he did it
[19:53] he won't even say if homosexuality is
[19:55] wrong
[19:56] you you can't get anything straight out
[19:58] of him why because that's what they
[20:00] believe we're all god's children we'll
[20:01] all get along
[20:03] you think about this this was the group
[20:04] brother branham was preaching in
[20:07] back then and then to preach some of the
[20:09] things he did
[20:12] makes you think we if he got along with
[20:14] them that well we could get along with
[20:15] one another too you know
[20:17] just on a personal level anyway
[20:19] these guys were against everything he
[20:21] stood for
[20:22] many of them were
[20:24] but yet he got along with him but yet he
[20:26] preached the truth and he could do that
[20:28] because of his gift now
[20:30] democracy and become what he called a
[20:32] facilitator of the holy ghost
[20:35] and the businessmen who attended those
[20:37] meetings were already saved in their
[20:38] denominational church
[20:40] but there were hundreds and thousands of
[20:42] individuals who received the pentecostal
[20:43] infilling of the holy ghost was speaking
[20:45] in tongues
[20:47] and so it introduced
[20:48] this to the people
[20:50] and and
[20:52] i think i put a little piece of this
[20:54] article this is actually from the voice
[20:56] full gospel businessman's voice
[20:58] and yeah and and there was that they
[21:00] introduced the baptism the holy ghost
[21:02] into several
[21:03] areas of fundamental faith where people
[21:05] were not friendly to that type of
[21:06] doctrine or filled with the spirit of
[21:08] god and this is still what is in their
[21:10] newsletter like i said this is the
[21:11] latest issue pray to receive the baptism
[21:14] of the holy spirit they're still saying
[21:17] we want that oil
[21:20] right we want that oil it's been what 50
[21:22] 60 years
[21:24] since brother branham preached this and
[21:26] identified it and they're still saying
[21:28] we want that oil let's get everybody the
[21:30] holy ghost let's have everybody speak in
[21:32] tongues
[21:33] now
[21:35] but they were not friendly that type of
[21:36] doctrine but those kind of people were
[21:39] filled with the spirit of god
[21:41] now and i think i put a little bit of
[21:42] that on the next slide as well
[21:44] uh yeah it says and that's from the from
[21:47] the voice
[21:48] and that's who they were looking for
[21:50] brother branham tells us they didn't get
[21:52] it
[21:55] now think about that they didn't get it
[21:58] look where it led to and we need to
[22:01] watch this because and like i said it's
[22:02] only one part as we're looking at the
[22:04] foolish virgin
[22:05] but you realize there were many people
[22:07] caught up in that movement that maybe
[22:08] we're good people
[22:10] but they're going to be caught up in
[22:11] that and they're going to end up in the
[22:12] tribulation period and look back and say
[22:14] we knew better
[22:16] right we we should have known better
[22:19] and now look where we're at
[22:22] well i don't want to be in that group
[22:24] it's not going to be fun to go through
[22:25] the tribulation period
[22:27] it's not going to be a fun time
[22:30] and they'll have to die the ones that
[22:32] are
[22:32] the true virgins to christ that remain
[22:34] true to the word will have to die during
[22:36] that time but it's our they're they're
[22:39] actually the ones
[22:41] they got what they wanted
[22:43] and brother madam warned them against it
[22:45] and it's actually going to come in a way
[22:47] that it'll force them to take the mark
[22:49] of the beast now
[22:51] look look what it led to
[22:54] about two years after brother branham
[22:55] passed away
[22:57] there was something born called the
[22:58] charismatic catholic
[23:00] movement
[23:02] and it's amazing how quickly it happened
[23:05] there was at that time when brother adam
[23:07] was alive there was no catholic
[23:09] charismatics
[23:10] there was no such thing
[23:13] but in 1967 some students attended a
[23:16] prayer meeting of a charismatic prayer
[23:18] meeting and were filled with the holy
[23:19] ghost and spoke with tongues
[23:22] and so now
[23:24] here i have a picture of pope francis
[23:25] that's actually from a newspaper article
[23:27] from a jesuit newspaper
[23:30] and and that newspaper article that i
[23:33] found on the internet
[23:34] is actually the main the main
[23:37] uh newspaper of the jesuits that's the
[23:39] the order that pope francis belongs to
[23:41] the order of monks or or a priest he
[23:44] belongs to
[23:45] now
[23:46] they said this i want to read you some
[23:48] of that article it says when pope
[23:50] francis joined six thousand people in
[23:52] rome on june 8th for the launch on
[23:54] pentecost eve of a new vatican body to
[23:56] serve the 115 million charismatic
[23:59] catholics around the world
[24:02] now you don't we don't even understand
[24:04] that around here but in different parts
[24:06] of the u.s and especially overseas there
[24:09] are many many charismatic catholics
[24:11] who've received what they call the
[24:12] baptism of the holy ghost spoke in
[24:14] tongues
[24:15] and maintained their catholic faith so
[24:18] they pray to mary in tongues
[24:23] honestly
[24:24] now
[24:25] and it said they made sure to perform
[24:27] his favorite latin american praise song
[24:30] the lord jesus lives and they said this
[24:33] and i put this quote on there i believe
[24:35] it says francis may not pray in tongues
[24:37] the current pope
[24:38] no pope has ever identified as closely
[24:41] with the catholic charismatic renewal
[24:43] nor been so keen to move it front and
[24:46] center in the church
[24:48] the link with the charismatic renewal
[24:50] grew stronger especially between 2006
[24:52] and 2012 when cardinal
[24:54] at the time he was cardinal bergoglio i
[24:56] don't know if that's exactly how you
[24:57] pronounce that where he attended the
[25:00] gathering of around 7 000 catholics in
[25:01] the evangelicals in argentina and it was
[25:05] among the biggest ecumenical praise
[25:07] meetings at that time anywhere
[25:09] and he was hesitant at first to come up
[25:11] and be prayed over in tongues
[25:13] but he finally allowed the preacher to
[25:15] come and pray over him
[25:17] together with a handful of pentecostal
[25:18] pastors
[25:20] and he was said to have received the
[25:22] baptism of the spirit
[25:24] we have the first pope in history who
[25:27] claims
[25:28] to have been filled with the holy ghost
[25:31] right now just saying you have it is not
[25:33] enough
[25:35] right there's got to be some fruits that
[25:36] follow that
[25:38] right because here you have people
[25:40] laying on hands and and this
[25:43] this cardinal at the time who's now the
[25:45] pope received the baptism of the holy
[25:48] ghost of course in that case he must
[25:49] have spoken tongues because that's how
[25:51] they believe that you receive it
[25:54] now
[25:55] since his election in 2013 he's
[25:57] continued that openness reaching out
[25:59] through the renewal to evangelicals and
[26:01] pentecostals who are quick to recognize
[26:04] in him
[26:05] one of their own
[26:08] now think about that we we know uh we we
[26:11] who know the message it sounds so
[26:13] foreign you think surely they can't
[26:14] actually believe that but they actually
[26:17] count the pope
[26:18] as a person who's been baptized with the
[26:20] holy ghost
[26:22] because of what a prophet warned them
[26:24] against
[26:26] now watch
[26:27] he he has invoked the holy spirit so
[26:29] often and so emphatically constantly
[26:32] emphasizing the new things the spirit is
[26:34] calling forth and the dangers of
[26:35] resisting it through ideology
[26:38] the and the article says he is arguably
[26:40] and i believe i put this on there as
[26:41] well
[26:42] is arguably not
[26:44] history's just history's first jesuit
[26:47] pope but also the first charismatic
[26:50] pope now
[26:53] we heard a few years ago a couple of
[26:55] years ago how that he came in
[26:58] and uh brought this unity with kenneth
[27:00] copeland and you remember
[27:02] this i'm sure there was a video of it
[27:04] they were all praying in tongues and
[27:06] kenneth copeland went there and there's
[27:08] a picture of the pentecostal leaders
[27:10] with
[27:11] pope francis and then on the next slide
[27:13] there's a picture of kenneth copeland
[27:15] praying for the pope and the pope giving
[27:17] a high five to another member and these
[27:19] were actually from kenneth copeland's
[27:21] website they're proud of that
[27:24] they're very proud of the fact that
[27:25] they've been able to make inroads that
[27:26] they have a charismatic
[27:29] pope
[27:31] now
[27:32] just in this last uh couple of years we
[27:35] now have our first catholic charismatic
[27:36] supreme court justice
[27:39] amy coney barrett
[27:41] but it's not limited to catholics you
[27:43] remember what brother branham said about
[27:44] presbyterians
[27:46] presbyterians and then he talked about
[27:49] anglicans
[27:51] presbyterians and anglicans
[27:53] now the church of england now
[27:56] it's not limited to to catholics because
[27:58] the archbishop of canterbury on that
[28:00] next slide
[28:01] the most reverend justin welby
[28:04] says that he
[28:06] prays in tongues every morning
[28:10] well he's got me beat
[28:14] i'll be honest with you hey i have
[28:16] spoken tongues
[28:18] i believe in speaking in tongues i don't
[28:20] pray in tongues every morning
[28:21] the archbishop why is the archbishop of
[28:24] canterbury a charismatic
[28:27] it just this really struck me as i was
[28:29] studying these things why is the pope
[28:31] the current pope a charismatic why is
[28:33] the current archbishop of canterbury a
[28:36] charismatic why do we have a charismatic
[28:39] catholic supreme court justice for the
[28:41] first time in history i believe we're
[28:42] very close to the end
[28:44] we're actually seeing the fruit of what
[28:47] brother branham warned them of back then
[28:51] through that same group
[28:53] and now it's coming out
[28:55] in the head where it's went away from
[28:57] just being a priest you remember there
[28:59] was a priest there when brother branham
[29:00] even spoke in birth pains and and
[29:02] different sermons that he spoke there
[29:04] was a priest there
[29:06] and and he handed him his bible and so
[29:08] forth but now it's not just the the
[29:09] priest but it's the pope himself and
[29:12] it's actually the archbishop of
[29:14] canterbury who says he expects to hear
[29:16] messages and prophecies from god through
[29:18] others he hears the word of knowledge
[29:21] i mean we're talking about people who
[29:22] walk around with gold crosses and pray
[29:24] to mary
[29:27] right
[29:28] and they're speaking in tongues
[29:31] getting words of knowledge
[29:35] why
[29:37] it makes no sense
[29:39] but see it's in this hour and i hope
[29:42] you're staying with me tonight but
[29:43] there's got to come a great falling away
[29:45] in our hour
[29:46] a great falling away and i believe this
[29:48] happens in the church as a whole i do
[29:50] believe there's a parallel even among
[29:52] message people there's got to come a
[29:54] falling away from the truth even even
[29:56] around us many times there's a falling
[29:58] away people fall away from the message
[30:00] or they fall away from the truth of the
[30:01] message but we see it if you look at it
[30:03] in the in the nominal church there's
[30:05] been a great falling away although they
[30:07] call it a great renewal a great
[30:09] pentecostal charismatic renewal and paul
[30:12] says it this way in second thessalonians
[30:13] 2 3 let no man deceive you by any means
[30:16] for that day shall not come except there
[30:18] cometh falling away first and that man
[30:20] of sin be revealed the son of perdition
[30:22] who opposeth and exalteth himself above
[30:25] all that is called god or that is
[30:26] worship so that he has god sitteth in
[30:28] the temple of god showing himself that
[30:31] he is god now you think a few years ago
[30:33] if you went out and preached the pope
[30:34] with antichrist most protestants would
[30:36] have no problem with you at all
[30:39] but you go out now and say the pope the
[30:41] antichrist will be an incarnate pope
[30:43] you'll get almost no support
[30:45] among nominal churches why is that
[30:48] because well if he speaks in tongues
[30:51] he can't be all bad
[30:54] if he wants us all to be friends and all
[30:56] to come together he can't be all bad
[31:00] but see this is where the church oh i'm
[31:01] so glad that there's a ride that cannot
[31:03] be deceived i'm so glad there's a group
[31:05] on the earth today that has been sealed
[31:08] away from these things by the word of
[31:09] the hour i'm so glad there's a prophet
[31:11] that came in and say that told us these
[31:13] things
[31:15] because now here is one who opposes and
[31:17] exalteth about himself above all that is
[31:20] called god and he's worshipped as god he
[31:21] said remember you not when i was yet
[31:23] with you i told you these things and now
[31:25] you know what withholdeth that he might
[31:27] be revealed in his time he said for the
[31:29] mystery of iniquity doth already work
[31:31] even all the way back there two thousand
[31:33] years ago
[31:34] only he who now led us will it brother
[31:36] brown said that was the holy ghost
[31:38] he who now let us will let or he'll
[31:41] he'll hinder he who now hindereth he's
[31:43] hindering the antichrist from becoming
[31:45] incarnate
[31:46] he who now letteth will let until he be
[31:48] taken out of the way and then shall that
[31:50] wicked be revealed whom the lord shall
[31:52] consume with the spirit of his mouth and
[31:54] shall destroy with the brightness of his
[31:56] coming
[31:57] even him whose coming is after the
[31:58] working of satan with all power
[32:01] and signs
[32:02] and lying wonders
[32:05] well he sounds charismatic don't he
[32:09] he's not dead and cold
[32:13] you think about it
[32:15] now i'm going to get to that in a moment
[32:17] we're not deceived
[32:19] the elect will not almost be deceived if
[32:21] you could put it like that the elect
[32:22] can't be deceived
[32:24] but the elect will not almost be
[32:25] deceived by dead and cold that's not
[32:28] even in the running yeah
[32:31] all right if you're dead and cold you
[32:32] just don't have it
[32:35] i hope you're with me now
[32:37] but the the tears in the wheat both
[32:39] receive rain you don't get no rain
[32:41] you're just dried up and dead and some
[32:43] old uh reform a minister some old
[32:45] presbyterian or baptist or something
[32:47] like that and brother branham also
[32:48] mentioned presbyterian right after
[32:50] brother branham's ministry a
[32:51] presbyterian minister by the name of
[32:53] catherine coleman
[32:54] you've heard the name become a faith
[32:56] healer preached faith healing in a
[32:58] charismatic or in a presbyterian church
[33:00] become a leader of the charismatic
[33:02] movement why
[33:03] why did all that happen right after
[33:05] brother branham passed off the scene
[33:07] now notice he said with all
[33:09] deceivableness of unrighteousness in
[33:10] them that perish
[33:12] because why
[33:13] because they receive not the love of the
[33:15] truth
[33:16] they might be saved
[33:18] here's a warning for us church
[33:21] they love the
[33:22] miracles and they suffered brother
[33:25] branham because of the miracles
[33:28] they set through but see what we get
[33:30] excited about is not the miracles but
[33:32] the word
[33:34] right we love the miracles and we
[33:35] believe in the miracles but we don't
[33:37] that's not what gets us excited i
[33:38] believe in shouting and speaking in
[33:40] tongues and running the aisles but it's
[33:42] the word that gets us excited
[33:45] not not the miracles
[33:47] because they they put up with brother
[33:49] branham through all these long sermons
[33:52] so that they could see the miracle at
[33:54] the end
[33:56] and they did not receive a love of the
[33:58] truth that they might be saved
[34:01] and for this cause the bible says god
[34:03] shall send them a strong delusion that
[34:05] they should believe a lie
[34:07] that they all might be damned who
[34:09] believe not the truth but had pleasure
[34:10] and unrighteousness
[34:12] listen brother branham says that this
[34:14] way he said all the ages of deceit from
[34:15] the garden of eden all the way down
[34:17] there's never been an age so deceptive
[34:18] as this age false prophets will rise and
[34:21] show signs and wonders if possible to
[34:23] deceive the very elected he said see he
[34:26] said not just he said just the cold
[34:28] formal starchy churches and so forth of
[34:31] man-made theology that wouldn't the
[34:33] elect would never pay no attention to
[34:35] that
[34:37] not even in the running
[34:41] and there's people who try to take us
[34:42] back to that but that's not even in the
[34:43] running we must have the fire of god
[34:46] we must have the baptism of the holy
[34:48] ghost
[34:49] but just because a man's got signs and
[34:51] wonders don't make him right
[34:53] just because a person can make you feel
[34:55] good don't make him right what's he
[34:56] saying
[34:57] what's he got to say what is the word
[34:59] because it's the word that has power in
[35:01] it
[35:02] amen to give us new bodies one of these
[35:04] days aren't you looking forward to that
[35:06] don't you want to be called don't you
[35:07] want to be one of those that he come to
[35:09] claim his subjects be one of his
[35:11] subjects that he's gathering up here at
[35:12] the end that's what he's doing right now
[35:14] he's gathering up his subjects don't you
[35:16] want to be one of those and not one of
[35:18] those who are deceived you aren't we
[35:20] don't go by feelings we go by the word
[35:25] i hope you're with me tonight it's not
[35:26] where i intended to take this but i just
[35:27] want to i just want to kind of
[35:30] cabbage down on a little bit
[35:34] but brother brown said it's up there
[35:36] almost like the real thing
[35:38] just leaving out one word is all you
[35:39] have to do
[35:41] he said promise to the age it's a very
[35:42] great time and christians everywhere
[35:44] take heed to the hour we're living and
[35:46] remember brother branham was not just
[35:47] preaching to the bride he's preaching to
[35:50] those that would become foolish virgin
[35:52] as well
[35:53] go looking for oil he said they won't
[35:55] find
[35:56] it amen
[35:59] they found something but they didn't
[36:01] find the holy ghost
[36:04] they didn't find the true baptism as
[36:05] brother and puts it of the holy ghost
[36:08] right they found an anointing of the
[36:09] holy ghost but not the seal of the holy
[36:11] ghost because if they had they would be
[36:12] bride
[36:14] right so they didn't find it now
[36:16] he says
[36:17] people everywhere christians everywhere
[36:19] take heed to the hour we're living mark
[36:20] down and read and listen close
[36:22] what would god call a people out of this
[36:24] evil age for for his name he said the
[36:27] reason it is is to try her his bride you
[36:29] say oh oh i knew that the bride would be
[36:31] trying but listen what he's trying her
[36:33] for
[36:34] he said when she has made manifest been
[36:36] tried been proven proved to satan
[36:40] hallelujah he don't have to prove to you
[36:43] he don't have to prove to me he don't
[36:44] have to prove to himself he knows who we
[36:46] are
[36:48] hey man i trust that you know who you
[36:49] are tonight but he's got to prove it to
[36:51] satan
[36:52] what's he going to prove amen he said
[36:54] like it was at the beginning so shall it
[36:56] be at the end he said he's going to
[36:58] prove that she will not fall
[37:01] hallelujah
[37:02] amen there was a church that went down
[37:05] there was as i said sunday there was a
[37:07] church that was marching down into hell
[37:09] the church of america
[37:12] amen and it was it was caught up in that
[37:14] economic ecumenical move and even
[37:17] pentecostals and charismatics and all of
[37:19] them together and the pope speaking in
[37:21] tongues and the archbishop of canterbury
[37:23] speaking in tongues all of them headed
[37:24] down but you and i aren't headed down
[37:26] we're headed up
[37:27] why because we heard the truth we
[37:29] received the love of the truth
[37:32] thank you lord
[37:34] amen this is he said like it was at the
[37:36] beginning so shall it be at the end and
[37:38] paul in second thessalonians 2 this way
[37:40] in verse 13 he said but we are bound to
[37:42] give thanks always to god for you
[37:45] brethren beloved of the lord because god
[37:47] hath from the beginning chosen you to
[37:49] salvation through sanctification of the
[37:51] spirit and belief of the truth do you
[37:53] believe you're chosen today
[37:55] amen then nothing can get in that way
[37:58] hallelujah
[38:00] amen where unto he called you by our
[38:02] gospel he said to the obtaining of the
[38:05] glory
[38:06] of our lord jesus christ
[38:09] brother branham
[38:10] picks that up again in the breach and he
[38:12] said a woman just called up another
[38:13] woman
[38:14] said you know i'm episcopalian again
[38:17] anglican episcopalian is the american
[38:19] version of the anglican church headed up
[38:21] by the archbishop of canterbury
[38:25] prophet was way before his time
[38:28] and from that time till this all these
[38:30] years and now the archbishop himself
[38:32] speaks in tongues every morning
[38:35] and brother brandon speaks about this
[38:37] episcopalian woman said i spoke in
[38:39] tongues the other day i believe i
[38:40] received the holy ghost but
[38:41] don't tell nobody
[38:45] you ever met anybody like that
[38:47] i've had people tell me say well i want
[38:48] to be baptized in private
[38:50] that's not how that works
[38:53] the whole purpose of baptism and it'd be
[38:55] okay if that was the only way you could
[38:56] be baptized it'd be okay god would
[38:58] understand
[38:59] but when you can be baptized in public
[39:02] because the whole purpose of it is a
[39:03] public show show whose side you're on
[39:06] right
[39:07] and that's the reason why you are
[39:09] baptized to let the people know to take
[39:10] sides with christ
[39:12] now look he said they said i i don't
[39:15] tell nobody he said i doubt that very
[39:17] much
[39:20] what a harsh thing to say but this see
[39:22] she hasn't changed who she was
[39:24] still episcopalian don't tell nobody
[39:26] he said you might have spoken tongues i
[39:29] love this but you set a man on fire
[39:32] how's he gonna sit still
[39:36] hallelujah
[39:37] you can't throw enough wet blankets on
[39:39] him and see i don't believe we have to
[39:41] hype everything up and get you all
[39:43] emotional get you all up and going and
[39:45] moving in your pews and i make you stand
[39:47] make you sit and all this stuff i
[39:48] believe if you get on fire
[39:51] you're gonna burn
[39:54] you're gonna burn in church you're going
[39:55] to burn at the supermarket while you're
[39:57] on fire
[39:59] hey man you set a man on fire how's he
[40:01] going to sit still
[40:03] amen that's how john wesley told the
[40:05] methodist people he said that's how you
[40:06] attract people to church he said set the
[40:08] church on fire and people watch it burn
[40:13] amen and he didn't mean literally either
[40:16] amen if there was a fire here at the
[40:17] church the whole town of hardy would
[40:19] come out and watch it burn oh but if
[40:20] there's a holy ghost fire i believe the
[40:22] people will be attracted to that
[40:25] amen
[40:27] amen he said you set a man on fire how
[40:28] is he going to sit still he said that's
[40:30] right he can't do it he said could you
[40:32] imagine peter and james and john and
[40:34] them up in the upper room saying oh we
[40:36] got the holy ghost now but maybe we
[40:38] better just keep still
[40:40] he said brother through windows doors
[40:42] and everything they went out into the
[40:44] street
[40:45] acting like a bunch of drunks
[40:47] he said that's the real holy ghost
[40:52] oh church he said oh we don't have to
[40:54] have that today well brother branham
[40:56] said that's the real holy ghost
[40:58] he's preaching those seals but but we
[40:59] don't put our trust in the emotion of it
[41:02] but that's what it causes
[41:04] you understand that's what it causes we
[41:06] don't put our trust in the emotion of it
[41:08] but that's what it costs he said brother
[41:10] he said
[41:11] he said act like a bunch of drugs that's
[41:12] the real holy ghost but you see
[41:14] he said that sleeping virgin ain't
[41:16] receiving nothing
[41:18] anyhow
[41:22] i feel bad for them
[41:24] they sit there and
[41:26] you can tell
[41:28] that during some of the services they're
[41:29] real quiet they're just waiting brother
[41:31] branham please pray for the sick
[41:35] and missed
[41:36] god calling his bride
[41:40] oh hope we don't miss it today i believe
[41:42] we won't i believe we're the bride
[41:43] right i believe that for all of you but
[41:45] but we don't want to miss it we don't
[41:46] want to miss the through all the fanfare
[41:48] and everything else it's nice to have a
[41:50] good piano and a couple of good piano
[41:51] players or three or four it's nice to
[41:53] have a good organ player and a good
[41:54] organ it's nice to have a good set of
[41:56] drums but that's not where the holy
[41:58] ghost is that's not what makes it come
[42:00] because everybody and their brother's
[42:01] got a good organization if you go out
[42:04] here in a pentecostal churches
[42:05] everybody's got one but what is the
[42:07] difference in what we are and what is
[42:09] out there in the world it's the word
[42:13] the rain falls on the just and the
[42:14] unjust and i'm happy for the rain but
[42:16] it's the word that makes a difference in
[42:18] our lives
[42:20] hey man the sleeping virgin ain't
[42:21] receiving nothing because they didn't
[42:23] they didn't get it
[42:24] they went looking they went to buy
[42:27] amen he said remember he said while they
[42:30] went to try to buy oil remember the
[42:32] scripture doesn't say they got it
[42:34] while they were out trying to buy it
[42:37] how much more can you get it went from
[42:39] in his day just a few seeking it until
[42:42] now it's the very archbishop of
[42:43] canterbury the pope of rome speaking in
[42:45] tongues where are we at
[42:50] while they were out trying to buy it
[42:52] there come a sound
[42:54] what happened
[42:56] all those virgins that slept rose and
[42:58] trimmed their lamps
[43:00] and amen this lamp trimming time
[43:02] went into the supper he said is that
[43:04] right he said and the rest was left for
[43:06] the tribulation period he said right
[43:08] weeping wailing and gnashing of teeth he
[43:10] said that's the church not the bride the
[43:12] church
[43:13] the bride went in
[43:15] amen there's a whole day amen don't you
[43:18] see what he's doing while they went to
[43:19] buy oil we're going in
[43:22] what are we going into and we could
[43:24] preach a whole sermon on this but what
[43:25] was that shout it was the mystery of the
[43:27] seventh seal under the seventh still
[43:29] mystery the mystery of going that he's
[43:31] calling for his subjects
[43:33] you understand the rapture didn't just
[43:34] isn't just an event that's in the future
[43:36] but it's something you're a part of
[43:38] right now
[43:40] hey man you're already walking in
[43:43] can you see yourself there you heard the
[43:45] midnight crying you've got the oil
[43:47] you've trimmed your lamps and you're
[43:48] walking in
[43:51] at the oh my at the same time that the
[43:54] archbishop of canterbury is speaking in
[43:56] tongues at the same time that the pope
[43:58] of rome is speaking in tongues becoming
[44:00] charismatic at that same hour i hope you
[44:02] could hear it today the way that he
[44:04] reveals it to me
[44:05] not as a prophet but just an inspiration
[44:08] of the word i just got to looking at
[44:09] this stuff and i thought oh god can we
[44:11] see the hour that we're living in it's
[44:13] in that hour when she went to buy oil
[44:15] we're seeing the very end of it right
[44:16] now we have our lamps trimmed we got oil
[44:19] in our lamps we're walking in
[44:23] hallelujah
[44:25] sealed away under the mystery of going
[44:27] under the mystery and the opening of the
[44:29] word sealed away
[44:32] and everybody's looking around saying
[44:34] well nothing going on let's go back to
[44:36] 40 years ago
[44:37] no you're going right in where you're
[44:38] supposed to be
[44:41] there's a whole difference he says
[44:43] between the church and the bride
[44:46] i'm so glad there is
[44:48] he said went into the wedding supper he
[44:49] said oh no this boy he clapped his hands
[44:51] together he said the seals was broke why
[44:55] in the last church age to reveal these
[44:57] truths why
[44:58] the lamb broke the seals and revealed
[45:00] them to his church in order i love this
[45:03] in order to collect
[45:07] this word collected me
[45:09] i wasn't collected by music i wasn't
[45:12] collected i love it but i wasn't
[45:13] collected by it i wasn't collected by a
[45:16] pastor somewhere i was collected by the
[45:18] word spoken through a prophet
[45:20] amen that's why we come together we were
[45:23] collected by the word of malachi 4.
[45:25] that's why a pro a pastor may come and
[45:26] go a person might come and go you might
[45:29] see this one rising that one fall but it
[45:31] doesn't bother you you were collected by
[45:33] the king
[45:35] amen the word he sent out his shout
[45:39] and it collected you
[45:41] for his kingdom his bride
[45:43] made a difference between you and the
[45:45] foolish virgin don't you see the foolish
[45:46] virgin was not identified as foolish
[45:49] until the shout came out
[45:53] think about it
[45:54] they didn't even know they were foolish
[45:56] until the shot went out and it
[45:58] identified they did not have the holy
[45:59] ghost
[46:01] they went looking for it
[46:03] oh my
[46:06] he said what is it
[46:08] oh my he wants to bring his subjects to
[46:10] him now
[46:11] what is it out of the dust of the earth
[46:13] out of the bottom of the sea out of the
[46:15] pits out of everywhere well not just us
[46:17] church but all of his bride
[46:19] amen let's die down to the ages
[46:21] out of the regions of the dark out of
[46:23] paradise wherever they may be he'll call
[46:25] and they'll answer
[46:27] that's our hope in this hour you think
[46:29] of your loved ones those that have went
[46:30] on they walked into that mystery of the
[46:32] opening of the word and they went on and
[46:34] you look and say well
[46:36] maybe they didn't understand it all like
[46:37] i do but they went on and they're laying
[46:39] there and when we go in amen when we
[46:42] walk in they raise two he collects them
[46:44] too
[46:45] oh my
[46:52] i'm almost done
[46:56] maybe it don't matter to you
[46:58] i pray that it would
[47:01] maybe it doesn't stir your soul i pray
[47:02] that it would
[47:04] that there would be a fire
[47:06] amen that would be on the inside
[47:08] where no one can put it out
[47:11] what is out of the dust of the earth out
[47:13] of the regions of the dark out of
[47:14] paradise wherever they may be he'll call
[47:16] and they'll answer
[47:17] amen he come to get his subjects
[47:21] how did he do it how does he collect his
[47:23] subjects he revealed his secrets
[47:26] and they saw it
[47:31] hallelujah brother andrew glover stood
[47:33] up here here not long ago and he made
[47:35] the statement he said once you see the
[47:36] opening of the word you can't unsee it
[47:41] once you see why a prophet came and what
[47:43] he came you can't unsee it and so what
[47:45] is it he collected his subjects he
[47:47] revealed his secrets and they saw it
[47:51] oh he couldn't get much more clear than
[47:52] that
[47:53] and time is no more at that time
[47:58] do you know what that means for you
[48:01] means you can't be deceived
[48:06] there's no more time
[48:08] for the devil to deceive you
[48:10] anymore
[48:13] for you time is no more
[48:16] there's no more delay you're there
[48:22] you realize when you receive the word
[48:24] amen you receive the word and the
[48:26] baptism of the holy ghost the true
[48:27] baptism of the holy ghost comes in your
[48:29] life because that's the only way you can
[48:30] see the word is when you receive the
[48:32] true baptism of the holy ghost and when
[48:33] you receive it and you begin to see the
[48:35] word he claims his subject and when he
[48:37] has claimed you
[48:39] you can't be unclaimed you can't be lost
[48:42] time is no more at that time time has
[48:45] run out it's finished
[48:48] hallelujah the world may go on i don't
[48:50] know they may go on 20 more years i
[48:51] don't see how but they could go on 100
[48:53] more years but you've been collected
[48:58] right
[48:59] people don't
[49:01] when the trash man comes down our street
[49:03] on wednesday morning musicians go ahead
[49:04] and come
[49:06] trash man comes to collect the trash
[49:07] what does he do he goes from house to
[49:08] house
[49:10] and he finds the trash that's been set
[49:11] out that's ready if ours is still in the
[49:14] ditch he don't go down and get it
[49:17] we prove that
[49:20] he only collects what's ready
[49:23] you don't collect nothing that's not in
[49:25] the bin what does he do he collects the
[49:27] bin grabs hold of the bin and he dumps
[49:29] it in he collected but oh god oh my the
[49:32] king came in this hour
[49:34] that's why there was he put his face in
[49:36] the clouds it wasn't just to identify a
[49:38] prophet but he had to identify a prophet
[49:40] to identify himself
[49:43] the king put his face in the cloud
[49:45] why was it it wasn't he said well you
[49:47] well it was just that or the other but
[49:49] it was his face up there why was that
[49:51] why did he do that because the king came
[49:54] to collect his subjects
[49:58] it's time
[49:59] you that are in the bin
[50:02] you that are ready got your lamps
[50:03] trimmed and burning
[50:05] it's going home time
[50:09] time has run out

[50:13] amen
[50:15] one of these mornings
[50:17] for the danny people we have known
[50:19] i was talking to brother timothy pritt
[50:20] today and he said there's been so many
[50:23] that have died so many have gone on so
[50:25] many that we knew i'm sure for some of
[50:27] you that are older many more that you
[50:29] knew than what i knew
[50:31] but so many have gone on over the last
[50:33] couple of years
[50:34] but it won't be much longer yeah
[50:37] you see where we're at
[50:39] you'd be walking
[50:40] one day and you just see them come in
[50:41] the door it'll be just like another day
[50:44] they'll just come in the door of the
[50:45] office where you're at they'll walk in
[50:46] the door of the church maybe if you're
[50:47] there they'll come in wherever you're at
[50:49] if you're sleeping they may come in and
[50:51] hit shake you on the shoulder wake up
[50:56] you're going to see them
[51:00] i hope you hear me today you're going to
[51:02] see them and when you see them
[51:04] you're going to say
[51:05] it's going to be so natural to you
[51:07] you'll say that's what i believed
[51:10] there's what i stood for
[51:13] i've already been collected it won't
[51:15] seem strange
[51:17] because you're already there
[51:19] you've already
[51:20] in your soul you've already been sealed
[51:22] away
[51:24] oh don't let the trials of life get in
[51:26] your way
[51:27] don't let that now it's the time to
[51:29] worship god like never before don't let
[51:31] the the troubles and the trials and the
[51:33] worries
[51:34] get in the way get in between you and
[51:36] worshiping god
[51:37] listen the handwriting is on the wall of
[51:40] babylon that's what brother branham said
[51:41] tongues were go read the church age book
[51:43] the smyrna and church age the laodicean
[51:45] church but the random covers it over and
[51:47] over he said the tongues was not a sign
[51:49] of god's blessing he said it was a sign
[51:52] that the handwriting was on the wall and
[51:54] now the pope's speaking in tongues how
[51:56] much bigger handwriting could we get
[52:02] archbishop of canterbury speaking in
[52:03] tongues every morning it's time to go
[52:05] home
[52:06] amen
[52:08] look up your redemption draweth nigh
[52:10] amen
[52:12] heavenly father we love you tonight
[52:15] we thank you lord for the mystery of
[52:16] going thank you for the things that the
[52:19] prophet told us in this hour lord i pray
[52:21] that i didn't venture without authority
[52:23] but some of these things just struck my
[52:25] heart i pray god that you
[52:27] let that which lord is your truth and i
[52:29] believe that it is
[52:31] lord i pray that it would sink down into
[52:32] our hearts may we just get a realization
[52:36] sometimes when we have trouble and
[52:37] trials
[52:38] we just need to hear the voice
[52:40] of the message of the hour speak
