and and deliverance Lord whatever is needed God I pray that You' do it tonight we thank you for this time to come together we ask in jesus' name amen amen God bless you God bless you uh guess this working now isn't it all right amen it's good to be in the house of the Lord this morning this evening I usually preaching in the morning 1 Corinthians chapter 10 and verse 16 I want to take something on communion tonight I know I do this often but it's just it's important and I want to deal with this tonight the value of it the value of communion 1 Corinthians 10:16 the cup of blessing which we bless is it not the communion of the blood of Christ the bread which we break is it not the communion of the body of Christ for we being many are one bread and one body someone say it with me tonight one body for we are all partakers of that one bread so when when you come tonight we won't take prepackaged bread that's already broken but we come they make one piece of bread and then they we break it and it's broken but it's all part of the same bread we are all a part of the body of Christ around the world Amen God bless you you may be seated our communion service is special not to be special I know that I have communion more often we have communion as a church more often than some other places and and I pastors do it for different reasons for their own congregations so I respect that but I wanted to kind of explain to you why we do it is because we believe it's valuable to the church to have a communion service and to have it on a regular basis listen if you took communion every other month which is what our schedule is for 20 years you'd only be taking it 120 times if I got my math right in 20 years most people take it far less than than that I've known people who come to the Lord and were actually were actually in church for a little while and then passed away and we've all maybe had friends relatives people like that you probably think of somebody who's come to the Lord and they're in church for a while and they pass away and but none of us have a guarantee of tomorrow and so we want to give people an opportunity during their lifetime because life is but a vapor it appears for a little while and then it vanishes away but it's not just because we want to give you an opportunity to do it but because we believe that the the the communion service itself is valuable and should not be neglected uh among us as people because of what it means to us and what it should means mean to us we don't want to ever let it be just become a form if if every other month becomes just a form I don't want to do it anymore like that I we don't want it to be just a form we we want it to be right we we want to come for the right reasons we want to do it because we love it and some of you know that I was deprived of of communion as a as a child if we can say it that way I wasn't deprived uh you know I had a good family as far as they fed us and clothed us and things like that but my dad taught spiritual communion and so we never had communion never was able to do it until I was a teenager and and so I've always just appreciated the communion service so much and and and sometimes we don't understand the value of it but but it's an important part of what we do as a church brother brandham did it on the first uh Sunday of every month we try to do it on the first Sunday of every other month to kind of give us time because we know that we want to do it right we don't want it just to be a form now uh some people do it whenever they feel the church needs it that's perfectly all right but I I just try to do it and we we tell people we don't want to trick you into coming communion we don't want to have to have to make you think that it's a different service for somebody to come or have a special speaker we want you to want to come to a communion service you say well what if I take it and I take it wrong well just repent what if the Rapture happened right we're not worried about we're worried about taking communion wrong what about what if the Rapture took place I want to be ready to go and if I'm not ready to take communion I'm not ready for the Rapture right and you say what I've sinned I've done something wrong then put it under the blood how long does it take a minute a second a prayer and just say God would you cover me that's what he wants to do but he's a high priest of our confession we've got to confess our sin to him and expect him to put it under the blood oh I'm so glad that he does it for us now the Bible tells us in the early church they actually had communion every time they come together you'll find that in Acts 241 I did I didn't get them the slides tonight and and it may be good cuz so I won't hold you as long but but they the Bible says in Acts 241 they that gladly received his word were baptized the same day there was added about 3,000 souls and they continued steadfastly the apostles Doctrine and fellowship and breaking of bread and in prayers brother brand said that was a doctrine of the Apostles of the early church every time they come together they took communion every time he said he said the brandham Tabernacle takes it once a month but the scripture is as often as you come together this is what he says in 1 Corinthians 11:25 he said after the same manner also he took the cup saying when it's up saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as of as you drink it in in remembrance of me and he doesn't necessarily say how often just as often as you drink it brother brandom interpreted that is they did it every time they come together now however often we have communion I don't want us to lose sight of the importance of it right in 1 Corinthians 10 Paul is dealing with Strife in the church between those who ate meat which have been offered on an idol and those who refus can you believe that in the early church they had doctrinal differences among them can you imagine a church that was filled with the Holy Ghost and everything else but they still disagreed over minor points of Doctrine and Paul's answer for that was to tell them the truth but to tell them hey don't don't offend your brother right try to get along right not everybody's going to be the same now he said this in 1 Corinthians 10:15 I speak as to wise men judge what I say the cup of blessing which we bless is it not the communion Union the bread which we break isn't not the communion of the Body for we being many are one bread and one body we are all partakers of that one bread communion literally means participation Fellowship it's the Greek word coinonia which is fellowship it's it's uh it's participation it's partnership right it's sharing and you can brother Brandon makes this statement I heard the quote this weekend he said he said many of you can fellowship with me on this thought and sometimes I'll say that you can fellowship with me on this it means that we have a shared uh we have a shared experience right so if you've had maybe uh maybe a death in the family and so thinking of brother bill today and and what's going on with his father and if you've been through that you can participate you can fellowship with the loss of a loved one and if you haven't then you can't right you can't Fellowship there's no participation and every one of us has got something we can fellowship with one another on and things that we don't Fellowship because we're just not the same I can't fellowship with h with a brother who's a used car salesman I've never done that I can't fellowship with him on that right there's other things we can Fellowship on but when it comes to use car sales I'm not I don't know much about it but brother Joel can fellowship with that and and brother Bill can fellowship with that because they sold cars right you've done the same thing you can fellowship if you're a teacher with other teachers but when we come to the communion table what it does is it tells us there's one thing that we can fellowship with one another on there's one thing that we all have in common and that's the body and the blood of the Lord he died for every one of us the same way he didn't have to die again he didn't die one time for me and another time for you and another time for somebody else but when he died he died for each one of us and so every one of us Fellowship around the thought of the death of Christ and and his sacrifice for us oh I think we ought to be able to Fellowship around that so it's a it's a communion not it's mostly mainly a communion with God but it's also communion with one another and so brother Brandon says there's a communion with the Lord and this in this way every service ought to be a communion we we shouldn't just come to what we call a communion service which is really the Lord's supp for the Lord's table we shouldn't just come to that as communion but every service this morning was communion with God tonight communion with God Wednesday night communion with God and we may miss a communion service now and then but don't miss to have communion with God in your everyday life a communion with the Lord Brother BR says like an oasis in the desert it's like the spring underneath the pond we had three ponds on on our property growing up one of them had a spring under it and two of them had no spring they were all about the same size a couple of them a little smaller but they they all looked kind of the same when when the rain was good and when the water but you let it get the heat of the summer and you find that those other ponds would start to dry up and be full of all kinds of nastiness and they get they turn brown but that Springfed Pond would always be clean because it was constantly given out of itself why it was Springfed it was a spring and brother B said that's what communion in your life or in the church is like when we have communion with God it's like a spring under the pond an oasis in a desert it it's where the traveler coming by stops and drinks the water till he quenches his thirst all that our services would be a communion with God until we can quench The Thirst from our hearts brother Wendell said this morning we got to want it we got to press into it and in order to do that we've got to have communion with him that's what we want that's the object of our desire that's remembering the Lord he said coming by the order of his table we the passing Pilgrim that's souring here on Earth with us together we can come by his Table and there drink of His blessings and of his grace and of his word in Fellowship around his word until our thirsty souls are sad how many are thirsty tonight we're thirsty we want to be as brother wend said this morning we want to be in fellowship with him we don't want to just be in the crowd we want to be right where he is and if we're thirsty for that he said I've provided a way for you to come together in Fellowship around this one thought that my sins are under the blood and I've been forgiven and every one of us some of us have been healed and some of us are sick and some of us have different needs and different trials been through different things but every one of us brother Mike can come back to this thought that we have been born again by the blood of Jesus Christ every one of us stands at the communion table completely level every one of us forgiven by God not one above another oh what a wonderful thing not one you said well they've been a Christian for a year or 10 years or 20 years it does not matter every one of us come to the table the same right oh I'm glad for that Hallelujah he said then we leave the place of worship refreshed satisfied going out to meet the desert's problems again the problems of life's desert yes in Oasis in the desert refreshing ourselves making ourselves when we're thirsty he said it should be with every worshipper it is with every true worshipper that they long to get together listen Church brother brandom didn't teach a an individual religion but he said every true worshipper longs to get together there's something about the fellowship that's Divine it's ordered of God and it's holy sacred and the righteous are thirsting for it that's good yeah there have been moments in my life when I just thought God if I could just get to church if I could just get to church I appreciate my prayer closet I appreciate being able to talk to him anywhere but there just something about the house of God that's special to me if I could just get to church things start making sense you could be going through the worst time of your life but when I sat in the house of God David said that many hundreds and thousands of years ago David sat there and he said I I was looking that these men these rich men that go on with their lives and they commit evil acts and they continue to get richer he said but then I saw their end he said I come in the Tabernacle it helped me to understand when I sat in the presence of God that that it wasn't that that there there's an end for them and there's an end for me amen he said my foot my feet stood in Slippery places until I saw their End Amen where do you find that in the house of God communion service is communication between you and God and between you and your brother yes especially in the act of foot washing which we do with communion when you view it scripturally the act of taking communion brings The Showdown right it it forces you to something it forces you to think of yourself not as an individual but as one part of the body of Christ yeah cuz the person I'm going to get real real down where we live for a minute and then we're going to quit but the person who come by that you don't like I know we don't have anybody here like that but whoever that might be it's whoever you're thinking about right now you passed by the communion table some of you thought of me didn't you you pass by the communion table they take the same bread because the body was broken for them right they drink the same wine because the body was broken the blood was spilled for them right and that makes us brings us in unity we may not agree on what kind of pie we like we may not agree on what to do on this or that or the other but we agree on this one thing I was a great Sinner and he is a great savior could you fellowship with me on that thought tonight I was a great sinner all of us can say that and he is a great savior amen Hal remember you're not alone other people may not be able to fellowship with you as I said on different things they commun entirely with you on different things but when we remember the body and blood of the lord we know that he can we know that he was tempted in allik man are such as we are and if you're going through something that feels like nobody else can understand or commiserate with your troubles but you can look at it and say I know that he knows what I'm going through so I come to the communion table and it reminds me of that the Brandon made a special effort to attend communion service at the Tabernacle he said I truly think it's the duty of every Christian to take communion the Bible said if you take this not you have no part with me he said I believe it's a showdown time for the Christians if we do not take it we have no part with him if we take it unworthily then we're guilty of the body and death of Christ I know people sometimes are out at church that's not he's talking about but if you if it's offered to you and you refuse to take it what you're saying is I'm either not a Christian or I've could I've committed some sin and I won't repent of it right and Christians don't do that we don't want to do that sometimes it's it's misunderstanding people misunderstand that and it's fear that keeps them from the communion table we should never come afraid we come boldly before the throne of grace right because we don't come by our own Merit we come by the grace of God so and if we don't take it with no part if we take it unworthily we're guilty of the body and death of Christ so it gets to place where it keeps the Christian prayed up so if you want to look at the value what's the value of communion why do we have it like we do because it keeps the Christian prayed up because you know what I'm going to communion service I got to wash my feet and pray up right am I the only one does that wait wait we want to make sure we're prayed up right ready for communion service for foot Washing Service why because we know I take it seriously church I don't come to the altar yes sir right without repentance right yeah I I don't even come out here without repentance every time I cross the threshold of one of these doors if I'm coming to the platform I stop right at that door and I pray say God forgive me if I've done something I don't know about something that that that that that's escaped my attention and I've not spent enough time with you or done something's wrong forgive me Lord forgive me Lord I stopped right there and I learned that from brother Buster Brown years ago he would stop at the edge and pray and repent of his sins before he come out on the altar why it's a sacred place not because there's anything about the wood not because there's anything about the platform but because this is where God meets with us it's time that we've set aside for him to meet with us so we come reverently to the communion table we don't just take it uh you know like it well it's just like chewing gum but we take it reverently solemnly sacredly walking up conf messing all of our wrongs praying one for the other not only that but we should feel he said if there's a brother or sister Among Us that we feel is just a little bit out of line I know none of y'all think anybody else is out of line but sometimes I get to feel no way that brother's a little out of line yeah that sister's a little out of line he said our hearts ought to be burdened for that person on communion night especially especially to see them that they'll be be able to walk up and take communion you see people that are no longer in communion with us it reminds us who the church is right and those who are no longer able to take it because of sickness or because of it reminds us of them and we say Lord I I want them to be able to be in church or maybe some of our elders get to where they can't come anymore can't come at night and we lord I want so badly I've served uh sister Fritz communion many many times over the years and I don't see her tonight she probably had to go home but but I want her to be so bad I want her to be there and in the communion service her body is getting where she can't do it anymore but I want so badly for her to be there and so I pray for her at Communion time it reminds me of that our the brothers and sisters that are missing tonight it reminds me of them if there's someone maybe who's left church and backit and gone out in the world and you think I once took communion with him there's something special about that I want to see him at the table again some of y'all you don't know how much you bless me when you come by the communion table brother brandom talked about that he saw the different families coming up and I see some of your families come up and I know what God did for you I know what you come out of I know what my family come out of I know what we were and when you come up before the communion table just something leaps in my heart because I know that you weren't able to do that one day and now you do it with full Assurance of Faith why because you believe God died he died for your sins and you've taken advantage of that you've been born again by the blood of Jesus Christ Hallelujah Hallelujah he said you ought to be burdened for them to see them they'll be able to walk up and take commun not be condemned with the world because they are our brothers and sisters it should not be just a tradition he said you don't take and as I said we have to change it up we'll change it up but we don't want tradition we want it to be real yeah you don't take the Lord's Supper by tradition you take it because it's the love of God In Your Heart Right keeping the Commandments of God see that's what you take it for he said if you don't take it in sincerity just as tradition well our church observes communion once every Sunday or once every month or twice a year he said you go up and say well it's my time take the communion he said why a stink to God said see that's just a tradition even like anything else you've got to be sincere God wants the depths of your heart he said you remember the very God that brought you here on Earth is the one you're serving you're doing this because he said so because it's his order and we want to come up with deepness of sincerity knowing that by God's grace we have been saved and we love him and we feel his presence and we see it change our lives our whole being is changed we're different people we don't live like we used to we don't think like we used to what does that do it brings us into a fellowship with God again recognizing what he's done for us amen how many love him today the communion service let me get to this and we'll close and just just a few minutes the communion service should destroy every faction in the church right now I want to commend you for something I I I want to commend us let's Pat ourselves on the back for me everybody reach around there if you can I can't I can Pat my neck brother Joe about it pat ourselves on the back do a little calisthenics there I get out of breath Pat myself on the back but I want to commend you for this I we've had very little faction here in at church very little backbiting and talking and I've been here five years we've had very little I'm thankful for that because I see Ministry is destroyed by it church is destroyed by it and I want say keep it up but that's why we preach on these things that's why we bring keep coming back to the communion table we want to make sure that doesn't happen right right we want to be one because we're going to face hard battles there's going to be trials there's trials coming you don't even know about yet right right and there's going to be decisions that are made that you may not agree with and things that are made that you don't agree with maybe decisions you make I don't agree with but but we got to love one another we got to come back to communion with one another communion ought to destroy every faction in the church every one of us has done wrong at some point every one of us comes to the communion table if we come right yeah we come repenting not because we're sinners we've been saved by the blood of Jesus Christ how many believe that but every day we our feet get dirty our our hands and our feet have to be washed we've got to we we we we pick up things along the way and we need to come to the table and say Lord forgive me yes forgive me of my error forgive me of my secret sin forgive me of my thoughts forgive me of the things that I've done wrong and if every one of us comes and every one of us is Forgiven do we really believe that so we come and God forgives us it no matter what the what the depth of the sin is he forgives us fellowship with me on that thought he forgives us then how can we stand past this communion table with a grudge against somebody else how can you do it if he forgive you if he forgive me how can we take communion with a grudge in our heart against somebody else how can we have ought you've heard that saying ought that word ought yeah it's from Mark 11:24 therefore I say to you what things soever you desire When you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them yeah when you s pray and forgive if you have ought ought against anyone against any that your father also which is in heaven May forgive you your trespasses The New International Version says it like this when you stand praying if you hold anything yeah that's what a is a means anything what does a mean anything yeah I'd hear that as kid I didn't understand what a was I don't have a in my heart just means anything it covers it all if you hold anything oh my forgive them yeah when you stand praying when you come to the communion table when you come to church and you expect the blood of Jesus Christ to forgive you of your sins if you have ought against anyone forgive them so that your father in Heaven May forgive you your sins right brother Brandon said if there is an ought what does OP mean anything in your heart against anyone go to them now and be reconciled forget all the past yeah and if you've been having an up and down life remember something has come into that heart something has moved into those thoughts no matter who your enemy is love him love him he said no matter what's happened let it go after all I I love this analogy if you listen to brother Donnie Reagan sermon last night over at the meetings it he said we're a garden yeah right we're a garden of the Lord but listen to how brother Brandon puts this he said no matter what's happened let it go after all you're in a field with weeds the wheat and the tears grow up together yeah but we don't have a license to hate the tears right come on now yeah right come on church we got to learn to love the tears treat the tears right we're in a field with weeds not everybody that goes to church is born again yet are you with me now not everybody's even elect yeah and now we shouldn't start pointing say well this one is this one is you don't know who is and who isn't because you don't know what the future is but God does yes sir so the the weeds you're in a field with weeds he said we realize that but we must both grow together we've got to come up together oh church that's what we want see we can't send both bitter and sweet water from the same fountain that there's got if we come and say Lord You've forgiven me we've got to say Lord I forgive them brother BR said if you're a sinner raise up your eyes and look if you've been indifferent if you've had little squabbles and little things what difference does it make he said you're going to die one of these days what day maybe today you don't know and hour from now you may be in Hell or you may be in heaven but you've got to choose now if there's anything in your life that isn't right you choose Now by faith you say well if I can just get even with her if I can get even with him no matter what they done choose life no matter what they done choose life well they refuse to repent choose life Jesus did not forgive them because they would accept it right yeah that changed my life I heard that years ago I think it was brother Wayne L was preaching and he said Jesus did that not because they would accept it because he said you're of your father the devil and the and the high priests never were saved yeah but he said father forgive them yeah they don't know what they're doing yeah why did he say it not because of who they were but because of who he was yes it was his nature Hallelujah it was his nature to be a forgiver it's our nature if we take on the nature of Christ to be a forgiver of sins amen and he said if you're from your heart you don't forgive every person their transgression neither does your heavenly father forgive you so just get that close if there's one ought what does ought mean we got it if there's one ought one anything in your heart against any person sinner or saint you're in danger of Hellfire right he said well it's impossible not to have anything I beg to differ you won't be able to keep those thoughts from coming back into your mind but they can be under the blood today you say well I have to fight that tomorrow fight it tomorrow then all right sufficient to the day is the evil thereof but for this service this moment for my time of worship I'm not going to let anything my handkerchiefs are back I'm not going to let anything get between me and God are you with me church I'm not going to let you stand in the way of my healing so I'll forgive you all right I'll let it go because I'm not going to let that stand in the way of me in a good service I'm not going to let that stand in the way of me running the aisles if God tells me to do it of me shouting and jumping and what speaking into whatever he tells me to do I'm not going to let that stand in the way of me feeling forgiven just because I won't forgive you oh yes sir so we are commanded yeah to deal with it if we have any ought anything in our heart against sinner or Saint we're commanded to deal with that before we take communion you know that because if not he says you're taking unworthily you're guilty of the body and blood of the Lord so we think of taking it unworthily is committing some moral sin some sin of the flesh maybe smoking drinking but if you have ought you take it unworthily any thing what does it mean that we're guilty of the body and blood of the Lord it means we're crucifying him aresh yeah we come to the table with a thought in our heart against any person what are we doing we I know this is Close Church but we got to get that close before we can go to heaven right we want to go home we go on a rapture we not content you just stay here so we don't want anything no a in our heart before you take communion just say Lord forgive me I forgive them that's all it takes we don't want to crucify him a fresh I don't want to drive the nails I don't want to be there you imagine the guilt that would be on the person who stood there and drove the nails in his hand the people who gambled at at his feet while the Son of God stood dying on the cross and they're sitting there gambling over his clothes the one who put the spear in his side yeah you imagine the the ones who cried crucify him come on come on give us Barabas imagine the guilt that they felt do you realize when we come and unw when we do not repent of our sins we're guilty of the body and blood of the Lord just as guilty as they are good I'm not trying to make you feel bad today just repent of it say well I don't have time to go make it right with that person God knows your heart he knows you want to make it right with him and you'll make it right with the person if you need to when you have anything in your heart now what did he do that body again we we've already went what did he do in that body in Luke 23:34 that they he was crucified with the malactor verse 34 then said Jesus father forgive them where where' he do that in his body his body which is a type right here a symbol of his broken body he forgave them in his body then if we take in his body we also forgive we also forgive how can we take these symbols of his blood and his body and not forgive every enemy but the Bible says let a man examine himself as I'm closing let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup brother brandom even talks about prayer lines he Jesus said when you pray if you have ought in your heart forgive every man someone say every man that's hard to do isn't it it's even hard harder forgive Every Woman every child every man every human from your heart his trespass for if you do not from your heart forgive neither does your heavenly father forgive you yours he said so to enter this line how many want healing tonight you want healing I want healing if we want healing we got to come this way he said if you want to enter this line be free from sin how can I be free from sin I can't undo it confess your faults one to another pray one for another that you may be healed he said so if you got a in your heart that's sin don't bring sin in the line ask for forgiveness give forgiveness a real communion service ought to bring a Revival there should be no presence so sweet as when we recognize and remember his body and his blood and we've all made everything right and then look at the worship we can have at the end because everybody's under the blood all all the little differences are done away with all the little all the little isms and all the little schisms and all the little factions are done away with and we can say Lord we all stand together here at the foot of the cross and we're not going to put down nobody we're not going to spend our time talking about people but we're going to come to the table and partake of the body and the blood of the Lord because every one of us have that in common from the least to the greatest I need it just as much as you do brother brand says he said he said until a man can get down in alter talk about Revival and get right with God till he can Overlook little things and move on like a Christian ought to he said the po can't call the kettle black don't holler at them he's talking about the worldly church he said don't holler at them let's clean our own steps first oh you say we got it he said you he said the only thing you got is lukewarm he said the music is running you're running he said when the Music Stops we stop brother don't call the other fellow something let's look around your own door he said we need an oldfashioned Revival like we used to have down in the country when they lay in their face all night long not to carry on but real Godly sorrow not go back to the Altar and stay but go out and make it right with the neighbors yeah they had made it wrong with you get straightened up a lot of times that's the reason you know I know young people sometimes it's hard and I want you to stay until you get it right I want that but many times the reason they're staying and not getting it is because they just haven't made things right yet sometimes you need to tell Mom and Dad you're sorry sometimes you can tell your siblings you're sorry sometimes you just need to make it right he said a man is born once born again not emotionally worked up not some enthusiasm not putting his name on a church book not by joining the biggest church in the city but when he's actually cried through and begged with tears in his eyes till God has forgiven his sins cleansed his soul up from a life of sin and filled him with the Holy spirit with such love and godly till he takes them old tire tools back he stole I just love that how'd he pick that out there must have been somebody there that stole tire tools whatever it is that you took that doesn't belong to you take it back that's what Revival will do that's what real communion will do judgment begins at the house of God by the word of God he said not a textbook but the Bible not what some church teaches in their theology but what God says then you'll have a Revival where great powers and wonders and no we want that church wonders and signs and miracles and everything else will take place Brothers if you could come and begin to prepare the the communion we'll get ready to read the scripture at the end of that scripture 1 Corinthians 11 he said for this caused many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep if we would judge ourselves we need a piano player an organ player I believe the Joel's already arranged that he said if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world would we you bow your heads with me for just a moment I I'm challenging us tonight challenging myself it don't matter if it's spouse husband wife boyfriend girlfriend neighbor brother sister no matter if it's 50 years old or brand knew there's a grudge in your heart there's ought anything against any one it's not worth getting in the way of your worship it's not worth getting in the way of communion I want to be judged right here let me not come to that white Throne judgment but let me be judged right here right now right in this place Lord I'll I'll be I'll do different if I've not been if I've been careless with [Music] people if I've treated people carelessly if I've if I've if I've said things I shouldn't say if I've got let my tongue wag when it shouldn't have I've done things that Lord forgive me that's all it takes that's all he wants is a repentant heart if I've done anything out of order if I have anything against a person any person let me not be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord I Want to Be Right and we'll have communion with our Lord and with one another Heavenly Father Lord we come to the communion table from time to time because we want to be reminded we want to remember Lord what you did for us what you did for me that day on Calvary Lord I don't want to ever get over it Lord help me to come sincerely with with with a repentant Heart Lord as as brother Daryl has spoken to us before said with Lord that you squeeze our heart and the juice comes out our eyes would you squeeze our heart lord lord it's not all just running and jumping and we want that Lord we want that kind of service but Lord we want a cleaning up can we take the tire tools back lord maybe the words that weren't right and the things that weren't right Lord oh forgive us oh God forgive me Lord as I Lord I said in I minute every time I come Lord I'm afraid to come to the pulpit in the platform Lord where I know your word has been

out for communion night Lord as we partake of the elements the bread and the wine may we be complete free of every ill feeling every bitter thought pray God you'd help us Lord you said I know many

never did it in the first place not just covered Lord but forgiven we're so thankful for that Lord Lord as we take these elements Lord may we recognize we are one body we are baptized into one body by the Holy Spirit I pray you'd help us to know that Lord to treat one another in that way we pray in Jesus name amen Heavenly Father Lord I hold the wine oh God type of your blood which was shed for me

just we all get Dusty from time to time because we're human we're made out of dirt but we there's Grace for our dirt brother the Wayne preached I think Friday night over at the meetings there's Grace for our dirt but he deals with us as sons was another sermon that was preached there deals with us as Sons I'm so thankful for that we're dirt but there's something on the inside a deposit of God deity on the inside I'm so thankful for that so let's treat each other that way can we do that and it's a very vulnerable time but it's a very wonderful time we'll gather as soon as the foot Washing Service over we'll gather back in here and just worship for a little while before we go home amen John Chapter 13 I'm going to go down to verse 8 Peter said to him you shall never wash my feet and Jesus answered him if I do not wash you you have no part with me Simon Peter said to him Lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head Jesus said to him he who has bathed needs only to wash his feet but is completely clean and you're clean but not all for he knew who would betray him therefore he said you're not all clean so when he had washed their feet and taken His Garment sit down again he said to them do you know what I've done to you you call me master and Lord you say well for so I am if I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet you also ought to wash one another's feet
