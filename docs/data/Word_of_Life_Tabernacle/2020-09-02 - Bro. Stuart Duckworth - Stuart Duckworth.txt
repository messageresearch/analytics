house and death has to flee now there's hope where darkness used to be what a wonderful what a wonderful uh idea that that his presence can bring hope and life and it's more than just an idea but it's a reality because we've experienced that so we're thankful for that uh before brother stewart comes um we're going to have two services this weekend and because brother darrell ward is going to be through and so we'll have services at ten o'clock and three o'clock on sunday uh my family and i'll be eating at the fellowship hall and we're not gonna have a church dinner but you're welcome to join us there and bring your food or whatever if you want to do that it'll be open during the day we'll probably feed brother daryl over there but but he'll be with us those two services the lord willing and we've learned to say that through all of this but but we'll have the services regardless and but he's coming through the area and he told me he'd be through in september this is the very first weekend in september so he's keeping his word but didn't give us a lot of notice but we're thankful that god could bring him by our way and and we were expecting great things this weekend uh there's a lot of positive things happening some things i want to tell you about sunday morning and just that really blessed us and as a church and and we need to focus on those things and remember that god is still in control uh he may be stormy and windy and rainy but he's still in control he's the same yesterday today and forever and so we're so grateful for what god has done for us as a church and brother stewart duckworth have asked him to speak for us tonight of course it raining but the steward probably preaches when it rains more than any other preacher but he's off work because of the rain and so we're grateful to have him with us and uh and speaking for us tonight and gives me a little break as well amen let's sing a course of amazing grace before our brother comes out amen it was amazing grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me i love how personal this song is i was lost but now i'm found i was blind but now i see and it's our personal testimony that shows the world work with the light of the world a city set on a hill that can't be hit our personal testimony shows the world that jesus is still alive amen amen let's sing it together it was amazing and seeing grace how [Music] like me i once was lost i once was lost but now oh i was blind [Music] like you mean it now my heart to fear oh and grace my fears relieved aren't you glad that it did one day amen oh how prayer is just did that grace appear the hour that i first believe through many dangers all through me and the dangers [Music] but if grace has brought me this far grace will lead me home

amen that's why we live amen the lives that we live amen is that he could receive the glory amen just love the lord tonight and to certainly count an honor and a privilege to be here amen just to certainly enjoy his presence here tonight amen if we could let's just borrow hearts for a moment if you just have a knee just lift that up to the lord and he knows your heart he knows what's on your mind and he can certainly come and speak to you tonight and speak to that need we believe that just by our hearts lord jesus lord we come before your throne of mercy and grace lord and lord we just lord must want to say that we love you lord that we adore you lord that we worship you here tonight lord and we're thankful that lord that we can gather with believers lord of light precious faith lord that we can come lord in your presence lord once again lord we counted an honor and a privilege lord you see lord your people here tonight you know you knew who would be here lord and father we just ask that you'd come lord and lord just speak to your people know their needs their lives father lord may your word just go forth tonight lord in power lord and may they be able to receive that which they would have need of lord those that weren't able to make it here tonight i pray they would be listening in father i ask that you bless them as well lord go to them and in their situation and their in their lives father we ask that you bless your word as we read it in the name of jesus christ we pray amen i certainly love the lord tonight and we if we could we'll turn to romans 11 1 through 5. just want to speak on reserve by election kind of a thought that i'd had before and kind of just kind of revisiting that and you know you preach that one church and you're bound to hear y'all are bound to hear the same thing again eventually you know and or just some of those thoughts and just kind of going over some of those things today just trying to find the mind of the lord and these things stuck out to us we certainly love the lord tonight amen romans 11 verse 1 i say then hath god cast away his people god forbid for i also am an israelite of the seed of abraham of the tribe of benjamin god hath not cast away his people which he foreknew what ye not what the scripture saith of elias how he maketh intercession to god against israel saying lord they have killed thy prophets and dig down thine altars and i am left alone and they seek my life but what saith the answer of god unto him i have reserved to myself as seven thousand men who have not bowed to the to the bowed the knee to the image of baal and even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace amen this may the lord bless his word you can be seated tonight it just seems it's not brother ben's fault it just seems that work and the things of life it just seems that it's been a while since i preached and like i said that's not brother ben's fault he's been trying to get me get me here for a while and just thankful for a little time off and and to where we can come and administer tonight we certainly appreciate the lord for that we just want to look at a few things here that god is reserved to himself a people amen and it's by by his election and by his grace that he has done this and i like that in verse 2 that you know paul said here is god hath not cast away his people which he for knew amen i like that i like that amen and we know that according to election that that paul here is dealing with with israel but brother brown said it also perfectly types the church the gentile church but we know that according to election a hundred and forty four thousand will come forth and be sealed out of israel during the tribulation amen but but us were sealed this side of the tribulation amen by here we can see that it types israel and we can see that here this election and and how god has reserved his elected people it also tops the gentile church brother and said it tops the church perfectly the elected believers we understand that that god can't reveal himself to israel until the gentile bride is gone we understand these things he said in the feast of the trumpets and said all that it's waiting on is you and i it's the gentile church to get out of the way to where god can reveal himself to israel to the 144 thousand and then he's waiting on you and i waiting on that last one to be called and come to maturity amen but just that thought that would god cast away the people which he for knew asking that question amen we know that the bible says that he could never forget us that a mother could forget our suckling child but that that he can't forget you and i that our names are engraved in the very palms of his hand and i ask you that question tonight would god cast away the people which he for knew there's no way that he could amen because our names are engraved in the palms of his hands amen i don't want to try to try to keep my voice as much as i can as my voice goes it just kind of gets harder to preach and i'm going to try to try to preach in such a way where i can where i can keep my voice a little better but no matter how lost we were no matter how lost you and i were redemption made a way for us and man god is not going to lose those which he foreknew but he's got a purpose amen amen we've been elected by his grace and he can't lose a woman and then he calls us by his grace to an unconditional covenant amen and a covenant where he swears by himself and then he swears by himself that he'll perform that which he has said amen and brother branham said that he swore by the death of jesus christ and then he sent back the holy ghost for a confirmation of the covenant the covenant amen that god would have between you and i that he would bring us to the place of what he's called us to be amen amen that it's a finished work amen that death amen on calvary amen he's sworn by the death of jesus christ and that death is a finished work amen that's a complete work that he's done you and you and i amen he's the author and the finisher of our faith amen aren't you thankful aren't you thankful tonight for redemption aren't you thankful that no matter how lost you and i were they their redemption made a way amen that he wasn't going to lose a woman amen that he came and he he seeked amen those that were lost he sought you and i out amen aren't you thankful tonight for redemption thankful amen for the blood tonight amen thankful for the power that's in the blood amen amen thankful for the baptism thankful for the seal of the holy ghost amen amen amen to see god's claim upon your life amen to see that god's made a claim upon your life that he's elected you that he's called you amen by his grace amen and to see that to see that effect upon your life to see his grace working in your life ought to make you full of joy tonight i want to make you full of joy unspeakable and full of glory amen but elijah elijah got into the condition and the mindset that he was the only one that hadn't failed but god had to remind him and he had that mentality that he was the only one and sometimes we gonna get under that same mentality that we think we're the only one amen that we're the only one where we're at but god's got a church reserved amen god's got a bride reserved and man god's got sons and daughters amen and men that are walking in this truth that are walking in their slide amen amen it's not just my for no more it's not just this church but god's got a people amen in every nation tongue and tribe amen throughout the whole world amen it's got to be that way man it's got to come that way there's got to be a people amen give witness amen in every language and every place in every corner of the earth amen amen he was hated he was hated elijah was hated for preaching the truth amen for standing up against that painted up jezebel amen in her false worship of baal amen and preaching against her lukewarm husband ahab amen they haven't tied himself up with these unbelievers and man he knew what was right he he knew what was right he had heard what was right and man he had seen god remember he got mixed up he got mixed up with jezebel and it caused him to be in a lukewarm condition but we know elijah wasn't afraid of a showdown he wasn't afraid amen amen the god of elijah was with him amen god had been with elijah he was not afraid of a showdown to see who the true and living god was amen the god the god that answered by fire was with his prophet do you believe that amen he he was called he was elected amen he was called amen to bring a restoration in the midst of the unbelief in the midst of that lukewarm lukewarmness and the false worship it meant god had called the prophet god had called a prophet to restore israel back to the true worship of the true and living god amen he wasn't afraid of a showdown and then he wasn't afraid of the 400 prophets amen he knew who god was he knew what god had called him to do and then he knew the anointing that he was under i mean he wasn't afraid amen and he stood there under that showdown and the god amen and the god that answered by fire came down upon the scene but at the one one thread of a woman he fled for his life is that right but brother branham said here he said speaking of elijah he said he came on the scene with the word of the lord he sent his message that he preached and he condemned everything there was called sin he didn't leave anything unturned amen elijah the prophet that mighty prophet condemned everything of that age amen and there was a there was a prophet in this day there was a prophet in this state that was anointed with that same spirit of elijah amen telling us to come out of her my people and be not partakers over sin amen aren't you glad you heard that voice am i aren't you glad you heard that voice that messenger amen calling us out from those things calling us out from that sin amen not afraid amen to take a stand amen to take a stand against the denominations on those things amen and then to show us amen that those things were wrong and to point us to christ amen to point us to christ the anointed word of the day amen i still want to be identified with that message i still want to be identified with that messenger amen that's what i want to be identified in this last age amen and friends it's got to be more than just talking about the message amen but we've got to get into it and man it's more than just talking about it it's more than just having the tapes in the books amen it's more than just coming to church but we've got to get into it and then you've got to find your place in your position and stay there amen take your stand amen be unmovable amen be steadfast amen be unwavering find your position and stay there find your place in the word find your place in the body and then come to that position to that maturity not much of a voice already take your stand amen take your stand be unmovable amen be be steadfast be unwavering with what you believe amen and brother branham said here and souls that are in prison now and one time he thought speaking of elijah that he stood alone he said no i've got seven thousand yet that's right with you it says see that's that elected group there is always that group i said don't fear elijah i know that you think you run out because the denominations run up there on run you up there on top of the hill but said i've got seven thousand that believes the same thing that you're preaching preaching see i've got him amen that's what i want to be identified with tonight he said there's always that group i mean there's always that group they're right with you they believe what you're preaching they stand for what you're preaching amen amen they're not going to accept nothing else and i've reserved that group are you part of that group tonight y'all can preach with me amen speaking of election brother branham says i would be a discouraged man this morning if i didn't believe in the election and calling of god if i thought that this world was left to the outcome of it by the power of man and by the wisdom of man and by the big fours and the um and who never even mentioned god's name i'd be a discouraged person but i'm not looking for that outcome i look down on the page of this old book here where god wrote it out and everything will come out just exactly the way he said it and that's all so the only thing for me to do is not line up with them but line up with calvary line up with god line up with his word stay in the word no matter how much it looks like it's going to be that way it's going to be the god the way god intends it to be it can't be nothing else i love that it's going to be the way god intends it to be for him being infinite know the end from the beginning and he makes everything come to his praises that's right and he goes on all things have to work together everything will shape right up to its place my that wouldn't make the the cur make courage in a christian nothing can go wrong after all it's not our battle it's his it's not our wisdom it's his the only one thing we have to do is put our faith and trust there and sit still and see the glory of god see how it moves around to its place every wheel moving it may be scattered from side to side but it'll move right into its place when god speaks the word take courage tonight take courage christian take courage this evening in the election and calling of god upon your life you see it working amen and the holy ghost is here it meant keeping his bride amen preserving her till his coming when we look at the condition of the age amen we see the condition around us we see the violence that fills the earth amen the evil in the darkness that is so prevalent and you wonder how much worse it can get to think that my children are going to have to grow up we've said these things before in a society where it's perfectly acceptable to smoke marijuana amen amen were they they lessened the penalty more and more on homosexuals amen were where that which was wrong has now become right and that which is right has now become wrong that's the age that we live in it's become so prevalent in the condition and the darkness amen but the bible says in the evening time there shall be light and when there's going to be a people amen that will take that word the lot that has came in this age amen and they'll let their light so shine eminent light shines the best it shines the brightest in the times of darkness [Music] that's the age that we live in that's what we've came to that's where we're at amen amen it'll get worse and worse you think it can't get any worse but it'll continue to get worse and worse until we leave amen but no matter how dark it gets say man there's a remember there's a man amen there's a man that in the times of darkness there's a man that can turn on the light and then brother brown said he'll rapture the church just as he said he would and then he'll turn that light switch on all we've got to do is stay in line amen stay in step with the word amen keep your eyes on christ amen let the world make all the noise they want to amen we're going to march to the beat of the word amen we're going to stay in line with the word amen we may get out of step every now and then amen but the word will come forth amen and we'll line ourselves back up with that beat amen you're going to get out of sip every now and then amen we're not going to be exactly perfect amen but we we have a sound amen there's a voice coming forth amen the voice of the word the martian the beat of the word amen and the bride will line herself up with that not turning to the left not turning to the right not looking back to what was not looking back to what you were amen but looking for him amen to make good on his promised word amen all my hope tonight is in jesus name amen brother burnham said there's nothing left but the coming of the lord amen all our hopes tonight is in him amen all our hopes tonight is in his return romans 8 28 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them that are called according to his purpose so no matter how it looks around us it's going to be the way god intends it to be no matter how how off it looks or how strange it seems it's going to work out exactly how god wants it to work out because he's going to work everything for our good is that right amen he's going to work it out it's going to be the way god intends it to be it can't be nothing else amen because he knows the end from the beginning and no matter how far off the beaten path that it seems that we get or how far off you know sometimes we as brother ben was mentioning sometimes we we we try to make the best decisions amen and sometimes it seems like we get off the beaten path but god will bring you back to his perfect will he'll make the permissive will of god work out to the perfect will of god and that's where we've got to trust we've got to have faith i mean we've got to have confidence in the wisdom of god amen that me as a man i can make a wrong decision but god will make it work out for my good and what the enemy intended evil for me god will actually turn out to be my good that's the faith and the trust that we've got to have in god because he'll make everything come to his praise it's going to bring him glory no matter what he's going to make it work out just like he intended it to be amen amen amen and when his voice speaks in your life amen when when the one that is over came amen when his voice speaks in your life amen when he speaks the winds obey the storms of life obey amen it's not you speaking but it's him speaking through you it's got to be more than just yourself but it's got to be him in you it's got to be something greater than yourself speaking through you amen and when he speaks the storms of life have to obey even the storms amen that would cause you destruction they have to obey amen the troubling winds around us amen amen we we don't let it sway us no more and then because we know the master of the wind is present we know that he's here to calm the storm amen we know that the one that can calm the trouble storm is in us amen we've anchored in him who's in control of it all you love the lord tonight amen he's in control tonight there we place our faith in our trust amen and his divine wisdom amen because god knows best papa knows best is that right we're his sons and daughters and he's our father and he's he knows what's best for our life amen if we'll come amen under his leading he'll move everything right into its place exactly how it needs to be he'll work it out for our good do you believe that amen god will work it out but the thought that god has reserved himself a people to the word and in the revelation of jesus christ brother branham says to see the beginning of the church age and to see how the apostles the doctrines and things that they taught and the principles of the bible and then to see that church about the second round of apostles how it began to fade away the real true teaching the third round getting way away and by the fourth round it had faded away out into a lukewarm the church brought forth a lukewarm church he said and then a real spirit-filled church he said which i say this with godly respect to every man's religion from the beginning till this time the real true church has been a pentecostal church amen he said it's true god has reserved this church amen god has reserved himself not a lukewarm church amen but a pentecostal church amen our church that is founded amen upon the doctrine of the apostles and prophets and been founded upon the teachings of our lord jesus and been founded upon amen the the revelation of jesus christ and the power of jesus christ and the power in that name and that word reserve means kept specially i like this kept especially for a particular purpose or a person i mean god has reserved this church god has reserved a church to himself amen whether it be here or somewhere else god has reserved a people to himself amen and you can choose to not whether you partake amen and be a part of that church or not and then you can choose tonight whether you're going to go a man astray or you're going to stick it out if you're going to stick it out and then line yourself up with the word amen but he's kept it reserved for a particular purpose or a person god has reserved this this church to himself amen for his purpose amen for his divine plan god has reserved this church to himself amen to have the preeminence in a people amen to have have his way in a people god has kept this church for himself amen are people led by the spirit of god amen for a church full of quickening power amen a group that's got both mechanics and dynamics and man they they know how to to write a check and they know how to cash it they got enough faith that cash they know who they are and when they got enough unction of the holy ghost when they got enough power in their lives to make that word live and then god's reserved a church to himself and man to preach in the name of jesus christ amen that baptized in the name of jesus christ and then he's got a ministry a man that preaches a total deliverance amen to where we don't have to go service to service year after year bound by the same old things amen amen but there's a deliverance among his people amen and there's a power amen that will set the captive free amen that will bring our young people amen to a deliverance to where they don't have to go wandering and searching amen but the power of god is in this church and in this church that god has reserved to himself and then there's power in this church amen to break every chain of hell amen to break every chain to heal every sickness amen there's power in this church do you believe that amen god's got that type of church amen that's the type of church that i want to be amen amen god has reserved this people amen do you love the lord he's got a group that's not afraid to worship him amen he's got a group that's not afraid to make a little noise to get a little emotional some sometimes every now and then and then to sing sing a little loud amen to to sing a special amen to get up and praise his name i mean he's got a people that's not afraid to worship him amen in a way that's called heresy the way that's called crazy the way that's called insane amen amen that's the way they worship the god of their fathers amen we need a little bit more of that amen this is the type of church that god's reserved himself a pentecostal church let their hair down worship god amen amen don't be afraid what the person next to you thinks don't be afraid of how quiet it gets sometimes amen worship god amen we've got the truth and then we've got the truth amen we've got the holy ghost don't we don't we have it amen worship him the spirit in the truth and i'm not trying to work nobody up amen but the world will beat you down i'm in the world try to run you down amen but we come to the house of god not to sit like a bunch of bumps on a pickle or not on a log or we come to worship god amen wednesday sunday it don't matter amen that type of church that god has reserved to himself it'll be there whether it's you and i are somebody else and then the rocks are going to cry out brother ben told me to bring a little rebuke tonight i think we'll stay there for a minute he said he was kind of joking amen but if we hold our peace the rocks are going to cry out if god's done something for you amen you'll be happy about it no matter the circumstance no matter the storm amen god has done something for me he delivered me from sin and man he changed my desires by his word by spirit i mean i'm going to live for him i'm going to say man when i feel the led to say amen i'm going to worship him when i feel led to worship him the way that's called crazy the way that's called heresy that's the way god wants us to worship him amen it seems crazy to the world but that's what he wants amen amen as prophesied in the church age book in the last days they'll rise up a group a true bride of the last day and she will listen to the spirit where the others didn't amen where the others went off in the ages the final age the final bride the true bride of the last age there's nowhere else to go she's going to line up with the word she's going to say she's going to follow what the spirit is saying under the churches where the others didn't before and in the time of gross darkness in the evening time the light will shine amen in the light will return by the pure word amen it says on that and we will return to the power of pentecost and welcome back the lord jesus christ amen and brother and said in the church age books i thank god for that i thank god that that bride will be there i thank god for that if he believed it would come that's what i'm going to preach if he believed it would be there i'm going to preach that amen i'm going to preach that with all that's within me and i say here we are tonight amen where are we at we're in the evening time we're in the shadows of his coming amen we're so close upon us that church has got to be there a church is going to be present and then she's going to be in the power of pentecost amen power and the power of the word to welcome back the lord jesus amen brother branham said it would be there and i believe it'll be there whether it's you and me or somebody else i believe it'll be there amen the book of jude ain't but one chapter in the book of jude jude the first verse jude the servant of jesus christ and brother of james to them that are sanctified by god the father and preserved in jesus christ and called mercy unto you in peace and love be multiplied beloved when i gave all diligence to write unto you the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered to the saints and we know that they begin to get away from the true word amen to what what they had been founded upon as the years went on they began to get away amen and i wonder if if some of us around the message haven't begun to get away with what what brother brown said amen to what he tried to bring us back to i wonder some haven't got away from that amen but if we've got away from it we've got to come back and line up with it amen if we've got out of step we've got to come back to that we've got to line ourselves up with the word amen we can't we can't bend amen the word to match our lives i've seen this on facebook well we've got to bend our lives to match the word is that right amen but he said to earnestly contend for the faith and brother branham said here he said now he also promised there would be restoring of the faith we read over in jude that earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered to the saints now we're promised in malachi 4 by the same system he always did that would be restored back to the original faith oh my back to the original seed back to the seed like begin on the day of pentecost back to the same doctrine word by word power by power spirit by the same thing just exactly like it was in the beginning through sounds and wonders the living presence of jesus christ and after 2 000 years he's still alive and he's still the same yesterday today and forever amen to earnestly contend for that amen so so what should you and i do to what we've been restored back to we ought to earnestly contend for that amen amen earnestly contend amen to be that kind of church amen that what paul wanted to see that brother branham wanted to see the kind of church that jesus is coming back for that word earnestly amen with sincere and intense conviction i mean you're serious about it and man you're not loose about it amen but it's something that you come with sincerity amen i'm going to contend amen i'm going to contend amen i'm going to uphold amen amen what we've received i'm going to i'm going to hold fast to it and i'm going to stay with it i'm going to stick it out and then i'm going to give it all everything that i've got amen amen and i say tonight that it's worth your time it's worth our time and our energy i mean it's worth everything that we go through amen to get here it's worth everything the trials that we face and the afflictions that we go through and the sickness amen that we bear amen it's worth everything that we've got it's worth every bit of our energy brother branham said if i had countless lives i still live for him i mean if there was no heaven i'd still want to live this gospel way amen it's worth giving your life for amen you can't take nothing with you amen only thing that's going to matter is what you do for him i mean everything in this life it ain't going to matter what you can accomplish only thing that'll matter is what we do for him amen that early church they believed it was worth fighting for i mean that's what jude was trying to trying to get get to him amen i exhort you to earnestly contend for that faith amen amen it's not faith in a building or an association that well we're in the message or i'm associated with this brother or this group it's more than that amen but it's it's something a man of faith in that presence it's in a faith in the presence of the living god amen because that's the lifeline of the church amen amen we can come amen and we can quote all the all the cliches of the message and we can say all the right things amen but if his presence isn't there and when there's no lifeline there's no life in it amen but that's what we've got to contend for is the presence of the living god aiming to live our lives in such a way i mean that he'll be pleased with us amen to live our lives in such a way that it'll come down in the service and man it'll come by our way with his presence amen amen amen to come in sincerity amen coming and press forth amen amen it's not a time to give up or go back amen it's not a time to abandon what we believe it's not that time it's not a time to surrender it's not a time to give in amen don't make peace with the things you deal with amen but contend contend don't make peace with this world amen amen don't just let go amen but the fight amen earnestly contend for the faith earnestly contend for his presence in your life amen earnestly contend amen i believe tonight that we don't have to surrender to an old lady to send lukewarm service to a lukewarm life you don't have to surrender to that there's more than that there's more to life than that than just surrendering to a just a to an anxiety to a lukewarm spirit there's more than that there's more than just accepting that this is how the service is going to go amen but let your expectation be greater than that amen don't just surrender to that idea that we're this is just how things are going to be amen but come out of that condition come forth earnestly contend man don't give in don't give up don't surrender amen amen the skies are full of the pentecostal blessing don't accept nothing less aim in the skies are full of the real don't take nothing less than that amen come up to your position come into heavenly places and then come into a life that god wants you to have full of the power of the holy ghost and being full of the power of christ we don't just have to settle for any old thing we can have that living christ among us the same signs the same wonders it meant him being the same yesterday today and forever i mean that's what we've been restored back to we've got to continue we've got to continue to contend for that earnestly contend with everything that's within you contend for that i only got a few more pages here i bet y'all are happy about that i know my voice is you love the lord tonight you love his word amen it's not my word it's not brother branham's word but it's god's word amen saint john 16. i'll try to hurry i have yet many things to say unto you but you cannot bear them now howbeit when he the spirit of truth has come he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come and brother brenham said here he said but jesus said when he the spirit of truth is come he will bring these things that i have taught you to your memory the word and he'll show you things that come he said there is the real spirit-filled church now stays with the word reflects the word god on earth see he doesn't need any theologian because his word is of no private interpretation he interprets his own word by vindicating it and proving it it's the truth amen but i like how he pointed out there's the real spirit-filled church they stay with the word and they reflect the word and it's god on earth and that's what we've been called to be am in the spirit amen showing you these things in the spirit bringing things to your remembrance amen showing you things to come amen god wanting to reflect himself amen through his church amen he just needs somebody to reflect it amen and we serve a living god tonight i believe we serve a living god who comes in the lives of men and women amen i believe we've received and are a part of the greatest message that's ever struck the face of the earth amen god's called you to that by his election by his grace god's reserved a people amen he's called you to this message amen i'll say tonight that it's not for the unbeliever they'll walk away they'll they'll make light of it they'll make fun of it but it's not for them it's for the believer i mean it's for you and i i don't care whether they believe it or not amen i'm not ashamed of what i believe i mean i believe in a prophet i believe that god sent a message in this day is it different from the bible no it illuminates the bible it lines up with the bible amen amen it opened the bible up to me it didn't take away from the word is that right i'm not ashamed of that amen it's not for the unbeliever amen healing amen it's for the believer tonight though god can heal anyone but it's yours that's who it was intended for was god's children amen the bread amen it means salvation amen the holy ghost among the raptures for the believer amen that's what we're feeding upon the message of the hour to bring us to that amen and you can see generations before us and the things that that they dealt with and then as time goes on as the word is preached amen we ought to come out of those traditions we ought to come out of those strains and me and brother caleb we're talking about and come more into that image come more into that image amen of what's being preached what's being ministered from the message of the hour amen to a rapture amen to those that need the holy ghost we can preach the holy ghost and god can give you the holy ghost we've got it all and the lesson the message didn't leave nothing undone amen but it restored us back to everything amen to the world doesn't mean much to them but to you and it's life amen it's more than life to us amen amen that's more than life to us amen can you stand this evening we got a little bit more here but i'll just stop right there i know i didn't preach long but just certainly just felt led to stop there amen amen to live above the world you know we're not just called to to overcome the world but to overcome that antichrist spirit it's not just living a good life amen but we've been called to overcome everything that's in this age amen our young people have been called to to overcome the world amen and to come amen up higher even more higher than that it's better than it's more than just living a good life amen we've got to come to the truth we got to withstand we've got to withstand the enemy we've got to withstand that lukewarm spirit that will come in our lives young old middle age we've all got to withstand that amen but i believe we've been made more than conquerors through him that loved us amen you see your battle amen earnestly contend for the faith amen don't let up don't let loose just stay with it just stay with it amen you love the lord i'll just turn it over brother being i certainly love you tonight amen amen amen i told brother stewart he could rebuke us all if he wanted to ingest but i felt a little convicted tonight and we need to contend for that faith that was once delivered to the saints amen let's think that we've been made more than conquerors if i think we've been made more than conquerors [Music] overcomers in this sing life now oh we've been made victorious through the blood of jesus jesus christ aren't you glad he reserved you reserved a group oh we've

branham talked about that's what we want to be we want to be that church without spot or wrinkle and washed in the blood of them we can't do that just by our own efforts but we need the help of the spirit of the lord would you just talk to him like that while we pray heavenly father we thank you tonight for your grace and your mercy that's what we want to be lord in our lives in every way we
