[47:18] greetings to each and
[47:19] everyone and if we could just while
[47:21] we're all standing just turn in the
[47:23] scripture real quick over
[47:25] to Hebrews the 10th
[47:34] chapter Hebrews the 10th chapter verses
[47:46] 31-36 Hebrews 10: 31-36 it reads it is a
[47:51] fearful thing to fall into the hands of
[47:54] the Living God but call to remember
[47:56] rembrance the former days in which after
[47:59] you were illuminated you endured a great
[48:02] fight of afflictions partly whilst you
[48:05] were made a gazing stock both by
[48:07] reproaches and afflictions and partly
[48:09] whilst you became Companions of them
[48:12] that were so used for ye had compassion
[48:15] of me in my bonds and took joyfully the
[48:18] spoiling of your goods knowing in
[48:20] yourselves that ye have in heaven a
[48:23] better and an enduring substance now
[48:26] listen to verse and 36 says cast not
[48:28] away therefore your confidence which
[48:30] hath great recompense of reward for ye
[48:34] have need of patience that after ye have
[48:37] done the will of God ye might receive
[48:41] the promise amen let's bow our heads
[48:44] Heavenly Father Lord we just thank you
[48:47] for another opportunity to come in your
[48:48] house father Lord we so appreciated the
[48:51] message that we got from you this
[48:53] morning we just we just want to say
[48:55] thank you Lord From The Bottom Of of our
[48:57] heart and Lord as this service goes
[48:58] forward we just ask that your presence
[49:00] would be among us that you would move me
[49:01] out of the way father and that it would
[49:03] only be you speaking here we ask these
[49:05] things in the precious name of the Lord
[49:07] and Savior Jesus Christ
[49:09] amen amen you may be
[49:11] seated so we can see in the scriptures
[49:14] all throughout the scriptures there are
[49:16] certain there's Promises of Victory all
[49:19] throughout the scripture we can see it
[49:21] Old Testament we can see it New
[49:23] Testament but Victory as a Believer it
[49:26] is also God's will in our life we can
[49:28] read Isaiah 53 and we can see that
[49:31] victories certain victories are God's
[49:33] will in each and every one of our lives
[49:37] but sometimes what what easily can slip
[49:40] our mind is that God is Sovereign in his
[49:42] timing all right come on we have
[49:44] promises of Victory but the timing
[49:48] that's not that's not promised at any
[49:50] certain time God acts when he wants to
[49:52] act we don't get to choose when we get
[49:55] our blessings we don't have just
[49:57] blessings in our pocket that we can pull
[49:59] out and have them whenever we want but
[50:01] sometimes we have to wait on something
[50:03] but sometimes we don't have to wait on
[50:04] Victory sometimes we have Victory you
[50:07] know you come up you have a sickness you
[50:08] come up to get prayed for you get hands
[50:10] laid on you or maybe you're at home
[50:12] you're kneeling by your bed and you have
[50:14] immediate Victory you have an immediate
[50:16] assurance that that thing that has been
[50:18] plaguing you that it's
[50:20] gone but sometimes we have to
[50:25] wait come on and we wait on the Lord
[50:27] because it's you know it's like child
[50:30] training really you know the children
[50:32] you can't always give a child exactly
[50:34] what they want when they want it because
[50:37] sometimes the children they don't
[50:39] realize what's good for them at all
[50:41] times you know if they wanted to go play
[50:43] out in the road well don't let them go
[50:45] play out in the road that wouldn't be
[50:47] very beneficial to their health but we
[50:49] live in such
[50:50] a sometimes it's hard to have patience
[50:53] is that scripture it said for ye have
[50:55] need of patience and some sometimes in
[50:57] this age it's so hard to have patience
[51:00] waiting for a blessing in your life
[51:01] waiting for healing in your life waiting
[51:03] for something to come that you know is
[51:05] promised to you as a believer in the
[51:07] scripture you know it's your right to
[51:09] have it but sometimes it's hard to
[51:11] understand why you can't have it right
[51:14] then sometimes that's a that's a bit of
[51:16] a struggle and we live in such a age of
[51:19] convenience the age of fast food the age
[51:22] of you can go to well Amazon Same Day
[51:24] deliveries you can what whatever it is
[51:27] it's such an age of convenience and I
[51:29] think this being an age of convenience
[51:31] has led this to be an age of
[51:34] impatience we don't know how to wait on
[51:36] anything anymore all right back in the
[51:38] day I think people would come kneel at
[51:40] the altar and they would pray through
[51:42] until the Holy Ghost came but if the
[51:44] Holy Ghost doesn't come then we want to
[51:46] give up sometimes we want to get up off
[51:49] our knees and we want to move forward
[51:50] with our day if we pray for healing and
[51:53] our body's still hurting we want to get
[51:54] up and we want to move forward with our
[51:56] day but sometimes you just got to wait
[51:58] on the Lord in those moments you got to
[52:01] sit and wait you got to listen to what
[52:03] he's saying in those moments not just
[52:06] what you're saying sometimes we do too
[52:07] much talking all right come on we got to
[52:09] leave room for God to act in our lives
[52:12] we got to leave room for him to do
[52:14] something not just what we can
[52:17] do and I have a second scripture here in
[52:19] the it's in judges chap 6 vers 7- 27
[52:28] judges 6 veres 7-
[52:36] 27 now a little background for this
[52:38] scripture so this is Israel this is a
[52:41] scripture on Gideon in Israel so Israel
[52:43] they had been delivered into the hand of
[52:45] the midianites they had been in their
[52:47] hand for seven years they had been
[52:50] crying out they had been just in bondage
[52:52] for seven years and they I think the
[52:55] Bible speaks that they they didn't
[52:57] really understand why at this point they
[52:58] didn't understand why they still had to
[53:00] be in bondage they they didn't see they
[53:02] they wern't seeing it especially after
[53:04] looking at the victories in their past
[53:07] they could look back just so many years
[53:09] and there was Victory after Victory and
[53:11] then at this point there was seemingly
[53:13] no Victory God God seemingly wasn't
[53:16] hearing their prayers they were crying
[53:18] out and they were receiving nothing at
[53:21] this point that's true but we start here
[53:23] in verse 7 it says and it came to pass
[53:25] when the children of Israel Cried unto
[53:27] the Lord because of the midianites that
[53:29] the Lord sent a prophet unto the
[53:31] children of Israel which said unto them
[53:33] thus sayeth the Lord God of Israel I
[53:35] brought you up from Egypt and brought
[53:37] you forth out of the house of bondage
[53:40] and I delivered you out of the hand of
[53:41] the Egyptians and out of the hand of all
[53:44] that oppressed you and drave them out
[53:46] from before you and gave you their land
[53:49] and I said unto you I am the Lord your
[53:52] God lord excuse me fear not the god of
[53:56] the amorites in whose land ye
[53:58] dwell but ye have not obeyed my voice
[54:02] and there came an angel of the Lord and
[54:04] sat under an oak which was an ofra that
[54:07] pertained unto joash the abizer and his
[54:10] son Gideon threshed Wheat by the wine
[54:13] press to hide it from the midianites and
[54:16] just like our enemy today the midianites
[54:19] they were trying to steal everything
[54:21] that Israel had that was rightfully
[54:23] theirs that's why Gideon was threshing
[54:27] at the wine press he wasn't at a
[54:28] threshing floor where this usually
[54:30] happened at he was forced to go
[54:32] somewhere else because the enemy was on
[54:35] it was rampant he was trying to take
[54:37] everything that was rightfully Gideon's
[54:40] and rightfully Israel's he was trying to
[54:42] take it all from him yeah goes on verse
[54:44] 12 he says and the angel of the Lord
[54:46] appeared unto him and said unto him the
[54:48] Lord is with thee thou Mighty Man of
[54:51] Valor and Gideon said unto him oh my
[54:54] Lord if the Lord be with us us why then
[54:57] is all this befallen us and where be all
[55:00] his miracles which our fathers told us
[55:02] of saying did not the Lord bring us up
[55:05] from Egypt but now the Lord hath
[55:08] forsaken us and delivered us into the
[55:10] hands of the midianites now look at that
[55:13] the something Gideon and Israel had been
[55:15] waiting on for a long time the angel of
[55:17] the Lord to appear and he tells Gideon
[55:20] the Lord is with thee th Mighty Man of
[55:23] Valor and the first thing Gideon wants
[55:25] to do is question the Lord qu this is a
[55:28] capital l Angel of the Lord capital L he
[55:31] wants to start questioning what he's
[55:33] been told already not a amen not a
[55:36] Hallelujah not a praise the Lord but
[55:38] immediate
[55:39] questioning right away that's true yeah
[55:44] it says and the Lord looked upon him and
[55:46] said go in this thy might and thou shalt
[55:49] save Israel from the hand of the
[55:52] midianites have not I sent thee now who
[55:54] sent Gideon right Gideon didn't send
[55:57] Gideon nobody else from Israel sent
[55:59] Gideon but the Lord sent Gideon he had
[56:04] Authority he had it the Lord had sent
[56:06] him he didn't choose this for his own
[56:09] life goes on it says and he said unto
[56:11] him oh my Lord wherewith shall I save
[56:14] Israel behold my family is poor in
[56:17] Manasseh and I am the least in my
[56:19] father's house now what Gideon was doing
[56:22] Gideon right there is looking at who he
[56:24] has been yeah he's probably looking at
[56:27] who he is right then but what God's
[56:29] looking at is what Gideon can be what
[56:32] Gideon's going to be that's what he's
[56:34] looking at sometimes we get stuck at
[56:36] looking at who we have been we let the
[56:39] the the trials and the errors of the
[56:41] past dictate things in our
[56:43] future and we don't have to do that
[56:45] right there's a blood that covers that
[56:47] for us and we can trust in that blood is
[56:50] that
[56:51] right that's good he says and the Lord
[56:54] said unto him surely I will be with thee
[56:56] and thou shalt Smite the midianites as
[56:58] one man and he said unto him if now I
[57:01] have found Grace in thy sight then show
[57:04] me a sign that thou talkest with me he
[57:06] says Lord I know what you I know what
[57:07] you're saying I I know what your word
[57:09] says I I know all this but Lord I just
[57:11] need a little bit more I need a little
[57:14] bit more from you I know there's been
[57:16] miracles in your day I know you've seen
[57:18] all that but I just need a little bit
[57:19] more
[57:21] Lord he says depart not hence I pray
[57:24] thee until I come unto thee and bring
[57:25] forth my present and set it before thee
[57:28] and he said I will tar until Thou come
[57:30] again and Gideon went in and made ready
[57:32] a kid and unleavened cakes of an epha of
[57:35] flower the flesh he put in a basket and
[57:37] he put the broth in a pot and brought it
[57:39] out unto him under the Oak and presented
[57:42] it and the angel of God said unto him
[57:44] take the Flesh and the unleavened cakes
[57:47] and lay them Upon This Rock and pour out
[57:50] the broth and he did so how beautiful is
[57:53] that the same rock this is the same Rock
[57:56] that Gideon had had sweated over that he
[57:59] had cried on that that he had been it
[58:02] was part of his bondage really because
[58:05] he he shouldn't have been there he
[58:06] should have been at the threshing floor
[58:08] that was his right to be at the
[58:10] threshing floor but this rock that's
[58:13] where he was forced to be by the enemy
[58:17] but what happens is his sacrifice
[58:19] completely covered it all all right oh
[58:22] thank the Lord think about it says then
[58:24] the angel of the Lord put forth the end
[58:26] of the staff that was in his hand and
[58:28] touched the Flesh and the unleavened
[58:30] cakes and There Rose up fire out of the
[58:33] Rock and consumed the Flesh and the
[58:35] unleavened cakes then the angel of the
[58:37] Lord departed out of his sight now
[58:40] notice this as we go on just after
[58:43] Gideon had seen this happen it was a
[58:45] miracle by all means he had been waiting
[58:47] on it Israel had been waiting on it and
[58:49] the first emotion that hits him after
[58:52] this miracle is fear he gets scared as
[58:56] we read on it says and when Gideon
[58:57] perceived that he was an angel of the
[58:59] Lord Gideon said alas oh Lord God for
[59:02] because I have seen an angel of the Lord
[59:03] face to face and the Lord said unto him
[59:06] peace be unto thee fear not Thou shalt
[59:08] not die then Gideon built an altar there
[59:12] unto the Lord and called it Jehovah
[59:13] Shalom unto this day it is yet an ofra
[59:16] of the Abit and it came to pass listen
[59:19] to this the same night you mean to tell
[59:23] me that Gideon didn't have there wasn't
[59:25] a FL bed of ease in between his trials
[59:28] and his test you mean that same night
[59:31] the Lord had already commissioned him to
[59:32] do something else he didn't have any
[59:34] time in between in between his trials
[59:37] and the tough times in his life you mean
[59:39] one battle stopped and then another one
[59:41] began who's been there before who's felt
[59:45] that before no time in between the enemy
[59:47] is not going to take a day off we can't
[59:49] take a day off he's not going to stop We
[59:52] Can't Stop sir that's right right if he
[59:55] could pray he's praying for your demise
[59:57] so we have to pray for our
[1:00:00] uplifting come on we can't stop we can't
[1:00:03] we have to keep moving forward in this
[1:00:06] day the prophet tells us that there's a
[1:00:08] quote he says right here he says the
[1:00:10] hours are coming when this world will
[1:00:12] shake under the impact of the Church of
[1:00:15] the Living God that's moving forward in
[1:00:19] great power he said that's right I hope
[1:00:21] to see it in my generation not moving
[1:00:24] backwards in great power but moving
[1:00:26] forward in great power taking what's
[1:00:28] rightfully ours taking your healing
[1:00:30] taking our the chastisement of our peace
[1:00:32] was upon him taking our peace back
[1:00:35] returning the joy of our Salvation in
[1:00:37] our lives taking these things back from
[1:00:40] the enemy in this day yeah that's good
[1:00:43] as he goes on in that verse 25 he says
[1:00:46] that the Lord said unto him take thy
[1:00:48] father's young bulock even the second
[1:00:49] Bullock a seven years old and throw down
[1:00:52] the altar of Baal that thy father hath
[1:00:54] and cut down the Grove that is by it and
[1:00:57] build an altar unto the Lord thy God
[1:00:59] upon the top of this rock in the ordered
[1:01:02] place and take the second bulock and
[1:01:04] offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of
[1:01:06] the Grove which Thou shalt cut down says
[1:01:08] then Gideon took 10 men of his servants
[1:01:11] and did as the Lord had said unto him
[1:01:13] and so it was because he feared his
[1:01:16] father's household and the men of the
[1:01:18] city now what had Gideon seen already
[1:01:20] come on I mean my goodness how much more
[1:01:22] do you need but but we're going to fear
[1:01:24] our father's household oh my says and
[1:01:27] the men of the city that he could not do
[1:01:29] it by day that he did it by Night still
[1:01:33] a little fearful to take that next step
[1:01:35] still a little fearful to take what is
[1:01:38] rightfully his by the
[1:01:40] Lord but if the Lord spoken don't be
[1:01:43] scared to walk in it if he's told you
[1:01:45] something don't be scared to move that
[1:01:47] direction if he's let you know you don't
[1:01:50] have to be fearful there there may be a
[1:01:52] sea in front of you but he'll split that
[1:01:54] sea if it's what his word say
[1:01:56] he'll do what he has to do to get you
[1:01:58] where you need to be in life but
[1:02:01] sometimes we have to wait on it we have
[1:02:02] to be patient for it it's like walk if
[1:02:04] you're walking on a trail with just lamp
[1:02:07] light you can really only see about 5et
[1:02:09] in front of you but just because you can
[1:02:11] only see five fet that doesn't mean
[1:02:13] that's all the trail that's there the
[1:02:14] trail keeps going you just as long as
[1:02:16] you got that light with you as long as
[1:02:19] you got it with you you can keep going
[1:02:23] forward it will show you where to go
[1:02:25] it'll light the path you don't have to
[1:02:27] worry about it but you got to keep that
[1:02:30] light with you you can't let it
[1:02:33] go Prophet says in another place he says
[1:02:35] now remember when God has counted you
[1:02:38] worthy when you have a test God's
[1:02:41] counted you worthy when you have a test
[1:02:43] he said now don't fail this to get this
[1:02:46] when you have a trial or a test it shows
[1:02:49] the grace of God has found says you
[1:02:52] found favor with God you found favor
[1:02:56] with God and God believes that you'll
[1:02:58] stand a test if God believes that I can
[1:03:00] stand a test then who am I to think I
[1:03:02] can't stand a test who am I to say
[1:03:05] anything different who am I to doubt if
[1:03:07] I can keep going if this is just showing
[1:03:09] that God has favor with me like he did
[1:03:11] job let's be a job let's keep marching
[1:03:15] forward no matter what how does that
[1:03:17] sound God found favor with job he called
[1:03:20] him a perfect man and he he said just do
[1:03:22] whatever you want to him but don't take
[1:03:24] his life yeah and maybe sometime how
[1:03:26] uplifting is that to think that you
[1:03:28] might be a job sting here that these
[1:03:30] trials these things you've been going
[1:03:32] through that it's just God's favor
[1:03:34] finding you in your life it's just his
[1:03:36] grace finding you in your life and
[1:03:39] that's that's the tough times are
[1:03:41] nothing more than that come on in your
[1:03:44] life but even then Gideon needed a
[1:03:46] little bit more he had to know that the
[1:03:49] Lord would go before him and that is the
[1:03:52] important part you need to know that God
[1:03:55] is going to go before you and whatever
[1:03:57] you are doing that's the main thing
[1:04:00] that's the very main thing in judges 6 I
[1:04:03] think it's uh verses
[1:04:06] 36-40 it goes on Gideon with the fleece
[1:04:08] it says and Gideon said unto God if thou
[1:04:10] wil save Israel by mine hand as thou
[1:04:12] Hast said behold I will put a fleece of
[1:04:15] wool in the floor and if the D be on the
[1:04:17] fleece only and it be dry upon all the
[1:04:20] Earth beside then shall I know that thou
[1:04:23] wil save Israel by mine hand as thou th
[1:04:25] H has said as thou Hast said so he just
[1:04:29] admitted God's already told him come on
[1:04:31] but I need a little bit more Lord I
[1:04:34] don't I don't really want to wait to see
[1:04:35] this happen I need you to show me
[1:04:36] something right now I can't wait on this
[1:04:39] Lord it says and it was so for he rose
[1:04:42] up early on the tomorrow and thrust the
[1:04:44] fleece together and ringed the de out of
[1:04:46] the fleece a bowl full of water oh yeah
[1:04:49] and Gideon said unto God see at this
[1:04:51] point I think Gideon knew he was kind of
[1:04:54] he was walking on iffy I think he knew
[1:04:56] that he might be messing up a little bit
[1:04:59] by I'm just going to ask one more thing
[1:05:02] he knew that he should have enough faith
[1:05:04] for this but are we much different in
[1:05:06] this day shouldn't we have faith for
[1:05:09] whatever promise God has for us how much
[1:05:11] have we heard how much have we
[1:05:14] seen we can say well but but Gideon saw
[1:05:17] the angel of the Lord but don't we have
[1:05:19] a
[1:05:21] photograph that's an Evidence in this
[1:05:23] day don't we have the only Supernatural
[1:05:26] photograph ever taken in this day
[1:05:30] haven't we seen some stuff
[1:05:33] too he says Gideon goes on he says let
[1:05:36] not thine anger be hot against me and I
[1:05:39] will speak but this once let me prove I
[1:05:41] pray thee but this once with the fleece
[1:05:43] let it now be dry only upon the fleece
[1:05:47] and upon all the ground let there be due
[1:05:50] and how gracious of the Lord it says and
[1:05:52] God did so that night oh thank the Lord
[1:05:55] how faithful he is how gracious and
[1:05:57] merciful he is he didn't have to do that
[1:06:00] again Gideon had ask one too many times
[1:06:03] sometimes we've asked one too many times
[1:06:05] but he is always faithful he is never
[1:06:08] forsaking us is that right has he
[1:06:11] forsaken anyone here today no he has not
[1:06:16] but from this moment on Gideon wasn't
[1:06:19] asking any more questions if you
[1:06:20] following the scripture he was in action
[1:06:23] yeah Gideon was going forward now come
[1:06:25] on he had been shown enough and it was
[1:06:28] time to March forward but the Lord
[1:06:30] through these things he had to get
[1:06:31] Gideon's character to a place where he
[1:06:34] could use him because when he found
[1:06:36] Gideon I guarantee you he was
[1:06:37] downtrodden he was sad he was everything
[1:06:41] had been took from him that's he didn't
[1:06:44] feel blessed he didn't feel like God's
[1:06:46] chosen come on he was in probably a
[1:06:49] pretty dark place when the angel of the
[1:06:51] Lord appeared on the scene for him but
[1:06:54] just as he does today you know sheep a
[1:06:56] sheep isn't bornn to sheep it's born a
[1:06:59] lamb come on and it's got a mature it's
[1:07:02] h it has a a maturing process to get to
[1:07:05] being a sheep and I thought this was
[1:07:07] interesting I looked it up the other day
[1:07:08] one of the main things that shows that a
[1:07:10] lamb has become a sheep as they finally
[1:07:13] recognize and listen to The Shepherd's
[1:07:16] voice oh thank that's one of the main
[1:07:18] things where you can tell that that
[1:07:20] little old lamb has moved on to being a
[1:07:23] sheep now because it will adhere to what
[1:07:26] the shepherd's voice tells it right it
[1:07:28] won't do anything but what that Shepherd
[1:07:30] says it'll be out in the field and it's
[1:07:32] just all the time trying to listen to
[1:07:34] what the shepherd has to tell it what
[1:07:37] direction to go what to do when to do it
[1:07:41] and they have special ways of speaking
[1:07:43] to one
[1:07:44] another I thought that was
[1:07:46] amazing but even we we think about this
[1:07:49] and we look at maybe maybe take with our
[1:07:51] lives even if Gideon if he had not
[1:07:54] gotten an answer directly from the Lord
[1:07:57] it would have only so they had already
[1:07:59] waited s years let's say this hadn't
[1:08:02] happened till 10 years later all that
[1:08:04] that's going to do is make the miracle
[1:08:06] even greater when it does happen right
[1:08:09] it's not that it's going to be a
[1:08:11] struggle but all that's going to do is
[1:08:14] just make that miracle in your life
[1:08:17] greater when it does come forth when
[1:08:20] that promise is answered and it's
[1:08:22] delivered and the timing comes for you
[1:08:24] to receive your blessing from the Lord
[1:08:27] that Miracle will only be greater at
[1:08:30] that point and just how it happened with
[1:08:32] Abraham and Sarah you know the prophet
[1:08:34] says here he says and instead of getting
[1:08:36] weak like you do and like I do if God
[1:08:40] don't answer right in a minute you say
[1:08:42] well I failed to get it but Abraham got
[1:08:46] stronger all the time knowing that the
[1:08:49] longer it lasted before the baby was
[1:08:51] born greater Miracle it was going to be
[1:08:54] and you know Abra
[1:08:56] he didn't let his mouth confess anything
[1:08:58] opposite of God's promise he watered
[1:09:01] that promise daily with praises over and
[1:09:05] over again you know it there's many
[1:09:08] quotes on uh the prophet talking about
[1:09:10] you know you get your healing and what
[1:09:12] you confess if you confess opposite of
[1:09:15] it the sickness comes back on you well
[1:09:17] that's not just with healing that's with
[1:09:18] circumstances in your life that's what
[1:09:20] things you got going on you start
[1:09:22] confessing opposite of that it's going
[1:09:25] to come back because you're not
[1:09:27] confessing what this this Bible says
[1:09:30] you're confessing what what the enemy is
[1:09:32] putting in your mind what he's injecting
[1:09:34] in there and we should only be
[1:09:36] confessing God's promises in this day
[1:09:39] yes sir we've seen too much not to we
[1:09:42] know too much not to we know what this
[1:09:45] scripture says to us but when he finally
[1:09:48] does answer and that Miracle finally
[1:09:50] comes in your life just think about how
[1:09:53] every angel in heaven will they'll be
[1:09:55] rejoicing your brothers and sisters at
[1:09:58] the church with you they'll be rejoicing
[1:10:00] thank Lord amen there will be S there
[1:10:03] there will be a host just looking down
[1:10:06] at you they've watched you struggle
[1:10:08] they've watched you be in pain they've
[1:10:10] watched you you can barely move some
[1:10:13] days come on but when it happens it's
[1:10:16] going to be
[1:10:18] special but he had that answer there was
[1:10:20] no turning back now it was time to March
[1:10:22] forward and finally take back exact what
[1:10:25] was there from the midianites and that's
[1:10:27] exactly what he does if you continue on
[1:10:30] that's what he did but Gideon didn't win
[1:10:32] by his own strength the Lord went before
[1:10:34] him that was the Lord's battle to fight
[1:10:38] that was the Lord's strength that won
[1:10:40] that battle Gideon was just a man yeah
[1:10:44] used by the Lord yes it was the Lord
[1:10:47] that won that battle and I thought this
[1:10:49] was interesting the prophet says you
[1:10:50] don't have to knck down to the devil
[1:10:54] said we've got a law
[1:10:56] That's the Law of the holy spirit said
[1:10:59] the only thing you know have to do is
[1:11:01] know how to let go and let
[1:11:04] God now that's not always the easiest
[1:11:06] thing to do is it just to let go and let
[1:11:09] God when you're in pain yeah it's not
[1:11:12] easy yeah that's right the prophet says
[1:11:14] you keep fighting at it see and it won't
[1:11:16] never work that's right come on you keep
[1:11:19] fighting at it see and it won't never
[1:11:21] work he said when you let go and let God
[1:11:23] that's all see and in that same message
[1:11:25] as a couple paragraphs down he says in
[1:11:27] the same way it is with us it isn't what
[1:11:30] we fight and Pull and hurry and oh if I
[1:11:32] don't get this if I don't get that
[1:11:34] that's not it it's to know that the law
[1:11:37] of life is in you sir it's to know that
[1:11:42] and you just let go and let God then he
[1:11:44] takes you to your healing then he takes
[1:11:46] you to the baptism of the spirit or
[1:11:48] anything that he's promised yes than any
[1:11:52] claim that he's given is yours yes and
[1:11:55] by letting go and letting God and God
[1:11:58] had spoken it didn't matter if Gideon
[1:12:00] had one man beside him no men beside him
[1:12:03] an army of a million men behind him the
[1:12:06] Lord had spoken and it was going to be
[1:12:08] his they were going to take back what
[1:12:10] was theirs because the Lord had spoken
[1:12:13] on this subject oh yeah and he's spoken
[1:12:16] in our day too Prophet says in another
[1:12:18] place nothing will stop a man once he
[1:12:21] gets his answer from the Lord he said
[1:12:25] nothing will stop a man once he gets his
[1:12:28] answer from the Lord but what about
[1:12:32] before the answer
[1:12:33] comes that's the tough part what about
[1:12:36] before the answer comes how are we
[1:12:38] handling it he says then remember in the
[1:12:41] Lord and I wonder if really when we meet
[1:12:44] together like this in Heavenly places if
[1:12:46] that isn't communion that we are
[1:12:48] communing with God talking to
[1:12:51] him excuse me and then if we just sit
[1:12:54] still
[1:12:56] and let him answer us back yes we just
[1:12:59] sit still and let him answer us back
[1:13:02] many things and I'll listen this is the
[1:13:04] prophet of God tell saying this right
[1:13:05] here he says many things and one of the
[1:13:08] horrible things that I
[1:13:10] do I try to do all the Talking oh my and
[1:13:14] not sit still long enough for him to
[1:13:16] answer me back that's true do all the
[1:13:19] talking and not sit still long enough
[1:13:21] for him to answer me back and it it made
[1:13:24] me think you ever have I got a guy that
[1:13:26] I work with it's not brother George I
[1:13:28] know you thinking that I know that's
[1:13:29] where you was going to
[1:13:31] go I work with brother George and Tucson
[1:13:33] and I know that's what Joel was thinking
[1:13:36] but you know I got a guy I work with and
[1:13:38] I will um he'll come in with a question
[1:13:42] and he he'll just be all all frazzled
[1:13:44] and needing to know the answer and about
[1:13:46] three words in I I probably can solve it
[1:13:49] I know where we're going with
[1:13:51] this but what usually happens is he
[1:13:54] talks the whole time and never stops
[1:13:56] talking the whole time and then by the
[1:13:58] end of it he's already walked out of the
[1:13:59] office and I didn't even say
[1:14:02] anything he didn't sit still long enough
[1:14:04] and let me just help him out a little
[1:14:06] bit come on you know you're sitting here
[1:14:08] taking up all your oxygen just just
[1:14:10] giving me all the info all I needed was
[1:14:12] three words buddy I didn't need anything
[1:14:15] else but he wouldn't sit still long
[1:14:17] enough and let me help him out and
[1:14:20] that's how we are sometimes with the
[1:14:21] Lord sit still long enough after you
[1:14:23] pray just sit there
[1:14:26] yeah keep them eyes closed keep that
[1:14:27] head bowed keep those knees on the floor
[1:14:30] and see if he don't come say something
[1:14:33] because I guarantee you he will I know
[1:14:36] he will he's done it for me he'll do it
[1:14:37] for you as he goes on he said we do that
[1:14:41] so many times in prayer he said I think
[1:14:44] if we would get off get off of our heart
[1:14:46] what's in it and express oursel to the
[1:14:49] Lord Jesus and then just kneel and just
[1:14:52] be still a while and just see what he
[1:14:54] would say back to us see just see what
[1:14:58] he would say back to us if we could
[1:15:01] let's turn to another scripture real
[1:15:02] quick it's in it's 2
[1:15:15] Samuel it's 2 Samuel uh chapter
[1:15:22] 5 verses 17- 25
[1:15:26] and uh on this scripture as well another
[1:15:29] little bit of background so on this
[1:15:30] scripture David he had just had some of
[1:15:33] the greatest victories in his life to
[1:15:35] date he had actually he had finally been
[1:15:38] made King over Israel and they had just
[1:15:41] captured back Jerusalem at this point in
[1:15:43] the scripture so this is 2 Samuel 5:1
[1:15:47] 17-2 it says but when the Philistines
[1:15:51] heard that they had anointed David King
[1:15:53] over Israel all the Philistines came up
[1:15:57] to seek David so that's just like the
[1:16:00] enemy today when he sees a blessing in
[1:16:02] your life or that you're on the verge of
[1:16:04] one or that you are all you you're just
[1:16:06] almost how it happens in I think it was
[1:16:09] more so old times you know there would
[1:16:10] be a stronghold in a battle and whoever
[1:16:14] held that stronghold it was known by
[1:16:16] both sides whoever held that they were
[1:16:19] probably going to win the war they were
[1:16:21] probably going to move forward and win
[1:16:23] it and so in your life when you you
[1:16:25] start approaching that stronghold when
[1:16:27] you in Christ when you're when you're
[1:16:28] just so close when you're laying in the
[1:16:31] presence of the Sun and you're just so
[1:16:33] close to that stronghold obtaining it
[1:16:36] you've waited and you've waited and
[1:16:38] you've waited the enemy is going to
[1:16:40] throw everything he can possibly throw
[1:16:42] at you because that's what happens in
[1:16:44] the battle you start approaching that
[1:16:46] stronghold and they are going to fire
[1:16:49] everything they've got at you because
[1:16:52] they know once you get there you're
[1:16:54] unstoppable
[1:16:55] they know once you get there they can't
[1:16:57] handle you anymore they're scared their
[1:17:00] fear comes into their heart it's not you
[1:17:02] being scared anymore you're you're
[1:17:03] inciting fear into them at that point
[1:17:06] they know you would be too hard to
[1:17:08] handle oh yeah that's good but it says
[1:17:10] all the Philistines came up to seek
[1:17:12] David and David heard of it and then
[1:17:14] went down to the hold says the
[1:17:16] Philistines also came and spread
[1:17:18] themselves in the valley of reim and
[1:17:21] David inquired of the Lord saying shall
[1:17:23] I go up to the
[1:17:25] Philistines wilt thou deliver them into
[1:17:27] mine hand yeah and the Lord said unto
[1:17:30] David go up for I will doubtless deliver
[1:17:33] the Philistines into thine hand so
[1:17:35] that's one of those victories we spoke
[1:17:37] of earlier it's kind of a one of these
[1:17:39] it's an immediate he he prayed David got
[1:17:42] his answer and he just went on to do it
[1:17:44] he just went and he gave the Philistines
[1:17:46] a whooping just directly says and David
[1:17:49] came to B pism and David smoked them
[1:17:52] there and said the Lord hath broken
[1:17:53] forth a upon mine enemies before me as
[1:17:56] the breach of waters therefore he called
[1:17:58] the name of that place ba pism and there
[1:18:02] and there they left their images and
[1:18:04] David and his men burned them oh and the
[1:18:07] Philistines came up yet again and spread
[1:18:09] themselves in the valley of reim and
[1:18:12] that notice they came back they had just
[1:18:15] gotten beat in this Valley the enemy
[1:18:18] that's right so he' been in this Valley
[1:18:20] and then they came back to the exact
[1:18:22] same Valley came back in the exact same
[1:18:25] Circumstance the exact same symptom in
[1:18:28] your life whatever it may be that he
[1:18:30] just the enemy returned directly back to
[1:18:32] that same exact spot yeah and when David
[1:18:37] inquired of the Lord he said Thou shalt
[1:18:39] not go up but fetch a compass behind
[1:18:42] them and come upon them over against the
[1:18:45] mulberry tree so David David's probably
[1:18:49] thinking why would the Lord say no this
[1:18:51] time I just beat this exact enemy in
[1:18:54] this exact spot
[1:18:56] yesterday why why is it known now why am
[1:18:59] I having to wait now I know I can obtain
[1:19:01] this Victory through you Lord why am I
[1:19:04] having to wait on this why do I have to
[1:19:07] go lay and wait you know David he was
[1:19:10] very he was a man that was very used to
[1:19:12] victory in his life he had had much
[1:19:15] Victory up to this
[1:19:18] point but it's but Victory it's it's it
[1:19:21] isn't always where the Lord teaches it's
[1:19:23] the time leading up to the victory is
[1:19:26] where the Lord teaches that's where he
[1:19:28] molds character that's where you're made
[1:19:31] and you're molded into something yes
[1:19:33] that's true when you're having to lay
[1:19:34] and weit and you feel under attack
[1:19:37] that's when your character is molded
[1:19:39] when you don't understand why you're
[1:19:40] going through what you're going through
[1:19:42] but you're going through it
[1:19:45] nonetheless the prophet says in the
[1:19:46] message conferences he said it's strange
[1:19:49] that how God will lead his children
[1:19:51] right into traps I'd never heard him say
[1:19:54] it like that before for said it's
[1:19:55] strange that how God will lead his
[1:19:57] children right into traps said sometimes
[1:20:01] wheelchairs sometimes with heart attacks
[1:20:03] sometimes he leads his children why to
[1:20:06] see what they'll act see see how see
[1:20:10] what a reaction they'll have on an
[1:20:13] action God wants to see how you're going
[1:20:15] to react in these things see what
[1:20:17] they'll do he says every son that comes
[1:20:19] to God must be tested and tried so the
[1:20:22] true test the true test didn't even even
[1:20:25] the trial or the battle you're going
[1:20:27] through the the true test is how we
[1:20:29] handle the battles that we're going
[1:20:31] through the things that are happening to
[1:20:33] us in our life that's the true test from
[1:20:36] our point of view it's the thing we're
[1:20:38] going through but from God's point of
[1:20:40] view it's how you're handling what
[1:20:42] you're going through and who you're
[1:20:44] handing it to and what you're doing with
[1:20:46] it in your life and another spot he says
[1:20:49] how David the great patriarch how we'd
[1:20:51] like to speak about him said we haven't
[1:20:53] time but and many times as we heard
[1:20:56] someone speaking a few moments ago about
[1:20:58] David and his sin but when all of it was
[1:21:01] forgiven when he was going to battle and
[1:21:03] we called in the world the chips were
[1:21:05] down he says and the opposition was
[1:21:08] great and David laid there under the
[1:21:10] tree and sweated it out oh yeah and I
[1:21:14] believe that's what we have to do
[1:21:16] sometimes we got to lay there under that
[1:21:18] tree of whatever the problem is and we
[1:21:20] got to sweat it out for a little while
[1:21:22] right we have to wait on God we have to
[1:21:25] see what God's going to do in this
[1:21:27] circumstance he said until he heard the
[1:21:29] sound going through the mulberry bushes
[1:21:32] then it was different he said David Rose
[1:21:35] and went on because that he had an
[1:21:38] absolute sir that he knew that God was
[1:21:41] going on before him he had that absolute
[1:21:45] the Lord had spoken he knew he was going
[1:21:48] before
[1:21:49] him but as David lay sweating it out you
[1:21:51] know there's a quote that says that
[1:21:54] David could he could feel the
[1:21:56] Philistines walking around him so if you
[1:21:59] picture this David's laying there
[1:22:00] probably covered up by something him and
[1:22:02] his men and it says that the enemy is so
[1:22:05] close he could feel him walking around
[1:22:07] him he could feel him everywhere he was
[1:22:10] all over him at this point oh and so
[1:22:13] that's the point just like in our lives
[1:22:14] that's when the what ifs start happening
[1:22:17] you know what if the Lord doesn't come
[1:22:18] David probably thought what if he just
[1:22:20] leaves me here what if what if the Lord
[1:22:24] Lord's left me as he did
[1:22:27] Saul what if he what if I'm not anointed
[1:22:29] anymore all these different what ifs
[1:22:32] start flying just flying into his head
[1:22:34] what if while we wait the enemy attacks
[1:22:37] what am I supposed to do the Lord hadn't
[1:22:38] told me that far he just said go lay and
[1:22:40] wait he just said wait on me to come
[1:22:43] through the mberry bushes up there then
[1:22:45] you think even farther into that well
[1:22:46] what's he going to do coming through the
[1:22:47] mberry bushes I need an army yeah I got
[1:22:51] to have strength to fight and he's
[1:22:53] wanting to come through the mber
[1:22:54] bushes but sometimes we don't always
[1:22:57] understand what's best for us we can't
[1:22:59] always see 20 steps ahead like we want
[1:23:02] to maybe the Lord has only given us
[1:23:03] vision for three steps
[1:23:05] ahead yeah sometimes in our lives that's
[1:23:07] what it can be like right right and
[1:23:10] David probably prayed there and I'm sure
[1:23:12] many of us have been here he probably he
[1:23:14] probably laid there and prayed and
[1:23:16] received nothing but
[1:23:18] silence but in reality the Lord had
[1:23:21] already told him what he was going to do
[1:23:23] here what should he receive he had the
[1:23:26] Lord's words on this subject on this
[1:23:29] thing in his life so I I I believe this
[1:23:32] was probably a patience test for David
[1:23:34] to see if he would try and take the
[1:23:35] situation into his own hands or if he
[1:23:38] would just let it be in the Lord's hands
[1:23:40] if he would just go lay in weight as he
[1:23:41] was supposed to and let the Lord have
[1:23:44] full control of this situation if he
[1:23:47] would surrender and let the Lord have it
[1:23:49] all oh yeah just a little test that the
[1:23:52] Lord was given him and from my my own
[1:23:54] personal
[1:23:55] experience the Lord molding patience
[1:23:57] into you it can get pretty
[1:23:59] uncomfortable it's not it's not fun if
[1:24:02] you pray for patience buckle your seat
[1:24:05] belt because everything is going to go
[1:24:08] wrong if you pray for patience and
[1:24:11] you're needing that in your life it's
[1:24:13] not going to it's not just going to
[1:24:15] magically drop from Heaven into you and
[1:24:17] you're going to have patience at that
[1:24:18] point no it's going to be molded into
[1:24:20] your character by tests by trials by
[1:24:23] maybe your own children by may maybe
[1:24:26] your maybe your wife at home I didn't
[1:24:29] mean that about my wife though if she
[1:24:30] watches this other guys wise not mine my
[1:24:34] wife would never mold my patience she's
[1:24:36] a
[1:24:37] sweetheart but that was
[1:24:41] close but these things in our these
[1:24:44] things in our lives they're just they're
[1:24:46] character Builders is what they are and
[1:24:48] I have a quote at the end I'd like to
[1:24:49] read it it struck me the other day I I'm
[1:24:53] not to it yet I need oh I want to jump
[1:24:55] to it but I'm not to it yet I'll read
[1:24:56] here in a second but sometimes our
[1:24:59] prayer life it can get quiet too and
[1:25:01] we're searching but there's no answer to
[1:25:02] be had and as the scripture continues
[1:25:06] verse 20 I think we're at verse 24 yeah
[1:25:09] verse
[1:25:11] 24 it says and let it be when thou
[1:25:13] hearest the sound of a going in the tops
[1:25:16] of the mulberry trees that then Thou
[1:25:18] shalt bester thyself for then shall the
[1:25:21] Lord go out before thee to Smite The
[1:25:23] Host
[1:25:25] of the Philistines and you know I
[1:25:26] imagine this moving through the mulberry
[1:25:29] trees I imagine it sounded a whole lot
[1:25:31] like a Russian Mighty Wind oh yeah
[1:25:33] moving through the top of them mberry
[1:25:35] trees I imagine that's what it sounded
[1:25:37] like on that day just the same wind as
[1:25:39] the day of Pentecost going through
[1:25:41] telling them you can have what you've
[1:25:43] waited for and it reminds me of the day
[1:25:45] of Pentecost because he just said wait
[1:25:48] until he didn't say wait four days then
[1:25:51] quit he didn't say wait five days then
[1:25:53] leave he said you wait
[1:25:56] until that takes some Faith you blindly
[1:25:59] go into an upper room and the Lord says
[1:26:02] you wait until come on he doesn't lay a
[1:26:06] big long plan out for him but he just
[1:26:09] says you wait until and they waited
[1:26:12] patiently and what they got for waiting
[1:26:14] patiently was the promise that had been
[1:26:16] given to them it was the Holy Ghost and
[1:26:19] that's what we must wait for sometimes
[1:26:21] whether it's the initial filling or
[1:26:23] whether it's a re in sometimes you just
[1:26:25] got to
[1:26:27] wait that's right and mold that patience
[1:26:30] Isaiah 4031 says but they that wait upon
[1:26:33] the Lord shall renew their strength they
[1:26:37] shall Mount up with wings as Eagles and
[1:26:40] you know eagles they go through this
[1:26:42] process called molting yes and it's when
[1:26:45] they shed everything down that's been
[1:26:47] weighing them down it's usually a more
[1:26:50] it's an older eagle and what it really
[1:26:52] is is a maturing process
[1:26:54] it's a physical maturing process they
[1:26:57] they start molting away their feathers
[1:26:59] they start breaking the crust off their
[1:27:01] beaks they just they they get young
[1:27:03] again is what they get come on but what
[1:27:06] that that eagle had to do was wait a
[1:27:08] long time for that period of molting to
[1:27:10] come but then when it finally comes
[1:27:13] they're renewed their strength is
[1:27:16] renewed they're like they were when they
[1:27:18] were young yeah come on they they they
[1:27:21] feel good again within themselves yes it
[1:27:25] says they shall run and not be weary and
[1:27:27] they shall walk and not faint right
[1:27:31] there's another scripture Matthew 14 if
[1:27:33] we could turn
[1:27:44] there Matthew 14:
[1:27:48] 22-33 and now keep in mind this
[1:27:51] scripture reading this this is after a
[1:27:54] great miracle and victory that the
[1:27:56] disciples had seen they had fed to 5,000
[1:27:59] Jesus had they had just seen the Lord
[1:28:02] move in such a mighty way in their lives
[1:28:05] right like probably nothing had ever
[1:28:07] happened like this in the history of the
[1:28:09] world up until this
[1:28:11] point excuse me and it's verse 22 says
[1:28:14] and straight away Jesus constrained his
[1:28:17] disciples to get into a ship and to go
[1:28:20] before him unto the other side while he
[1:28:22] sent the multitude away and at this
[1:28:25] point how close they must have felt to
[1:28:27] the Lord after all they had done with
[1:28:29] him after all the victory they had just
[1:28:31] had with him verse 23 says and when he
[1:28:33] had sent the multitudes away he went up
[1:28:36] into a mountain apart to pray and when
[1:28:38] the evening was come he was there alone
[1:28:41] says but the ship was now in the midst
[1:28:43] of the sea tossed with waves for the
[1:28:46] wind was contrary and in Mark 6 when
[1:28:49] it's telling this same story it says
[1:28:51] that Jesus could see them toiling from
[1:28:54] the
[1:28:55] mountain I don't believe physically see
[1:28:57] them toiling but I believe spiritually
[1:28:59] he he saw them toiling just like he can
[1:29:02] see each and every one of us when we are
[1:29:05] toiling when the winds are contrary in
[1:29:07] our lives Jesus was watching yeah he
[1:29:10] never took his no matter how much it
[1:29:12] felt like he took his eyes off but we
[1:29:13] don't go off
[1:29:15] feeling no matter how much it felt like
[1:29:17] he didn't see him he was watching at all
[1:29:21] times and the 25th verse is what I want
[1:29:23] to focus on right here it says and in
[1:29:25] the Fourth Watch of the night Jesus went
[1:29:28] unto them walking on the sea so the
[1:29:31] Fourth Watch is the last watch of the
[1:29:33] night there's a first watch there's a
[1:29:35] second watch and there's a third watch
[1:29:37] and the fourth watch it's 3:00 a.m. to 6
[1:29:40] a.m. in the morning and it makes me
[1:29:42] wonder about the questions they had this
[1:29:44] man Jesus that they had just they had
[1:29:47] just gotten into a boat because he told
[1:29:49] them to yeah and now we're out here on
[1:29:52] this sea the boats of about to flip over
[1:29:55] we're about to die and this man Jesus I
[1:29:58] thought he was the
[1:30:00] Messiah and we're out here all
[1:30:03] alone but he let him go until that
[1:30:05] Fourth Watch of the night come on
[1:30:08] especially in that Third Watch just
[1:30:10] think about it that the first watch
[1:30:12] second watch Third Watch and the boat
[1:30:13] just had to be almost tearing to pieces
[1:30:15] at this point and he was waiting to see
[1:30:18] if they would take it into their own
[1:30:19] hands if they would jump ship they say
[1:30:23] well I don't think we're too far from
[1:30:24] from the land maybe we'll jump out and
[1:30:26] we'll try and do it our way or maybe
[1:30:29] we'll paddle
[1:30:30] harder no you're fighting the air right
[1:30:33] you're fighting the air at that point oh
[1:30:35] come on if Jesus put you in that boat
[1:30:39] he's going to save you when you're in
[1:30:40] that boat he's not going to let he's not
[1:30:42] going to leave you he's not going to
[1:30:44] forsake you and just just let you get
[1:30:45] out on that sea now he might wait till
[1:30:48] the fourth watch but he's going to come
[1:30:51] on the scene yes sir it might be in the
[1:30:53] dark hour but he's going to come on the
[1:30:55] scene it might feel like all the chips
[1:30:58] are down but he's going to come on the
[1:31:01] scene we just have to trust that and we
[1:31:04] have to act accordingly that Faith show
[1:31:07] it show that you have that Faith keep
[1:31:10] walking forward don't confess against
[1:31:11] what God's told you about your life
[1:31:13] right don't confess against what Isaiah
[1:31:16] 53 says all the promises he's given you
[1:31:19] just move forward with it very wonderful
[1:31:23] the prophet says in separation from
[1:31:25] unbelief he says sometimes it's just
[1:31:26] when the darkest times come along in
[1:31:29] your life God's given you a little trial
[1:31:31] to see if you really do believe it
[1:31:34] that's right now that's simple but how
[1:31:37] many have been there he's given you a
[1:31:38] little trial to see if you really
[1:31:40] believe what his word says or not this
[1:31:43] is Elementary stuff but it's the truth
[1:31:46] and it happens whether you're 5 years
[1:31:48] old whether you're 55 years old whether
[1:31:50] you're 105 years old that's going to
[1:31:53] continue you until you get the new body
[1:31:55] until you go on that will continue in
[1:31:59] this
[1:32:00] age says when he really makes a thing
[1:32:02] known to you perfectly in another place
[1:32:04] he says may be your darkest hour don't
[1:32:07] worry Jesus will be alone it may be your
[1:32:10] darkest hour sister may be yours sister
[1:32:13] may be yours brother but don't worry
[1:32:15] Jesus will come along he's always there
[1:32:19] just in the darkest
[1:32:22] hours is that true how many can testify
[1:32:25] of that how many does testify of that
[1:32:28] should we testify of it more often
[1:32:30] should we give a word of encouragement
[1:32:32] to a brother or sister beside us and say
[1:32:34] when you see them struggling tell them
[1:32:36] what the Lord has done for
[1:32:38] you don't tell them how bad the sickness
[1:32:41] was tell them how great God was when he
[1:32:43] got you over the sickness yes sir tell
[1:32:45] them
[1:32:46] that as we go on in the scripture verse
[1:32:49] 26 and when the disciples saw him
[1:32:51] walking on the sea they were troubled
[1:32:55] saying it is a spirit and they cried out
[1:32:58] for fear they had a hard time
[1:33:00] recognizing that their victory was
[1:33:02] coming yeah yeah come on they were
[1:33:04] sitting there and their victory was
[1:33:06] walking straight towards them on water a
[1:33:09] miracle in itself and they couldn't see
[1:33:12] it because of fear they were scared the
[1:33:15] wind was contrary they didn't know what
[1:33:17] to do in this moment they were scared
[1:33:21] said but straight away Jesus spake unto
[1:33:23] them saying be of good cheer it is I Be
[1:33:26] not
[1:33:28] Afraid and Peter answered him and said
[1:33:30] Lord if it be thou bid me come come unto
[1:33:33] thee on the water and he said come and
[1:33:35] when Peter was come down out of the ship
[1:33:37] he walked on the water to go to Jesus
[1:33:40] but when he saw the wind boisterous he
[1:33:42] was afraid and beginning to sink he
[1:33:44] cried saying Lord save me you know they
[1:33:48] they waited on the Lord Peter waited on
[1:33:50] the Lord till the fourth watch but and
[1:33:53] the Lord he sees him walking on water
[1:33:55] but then the first sign of danger we
[1:33:57] want to plant our foot and head back the
[1:33:59] other way we want to go we're not the
[1:34:03] we're not the children of Israel coming
[1:34:05] out of Egypt and getting out here and
[1:34:07] having a hard time and and saying well
[1:34:08] we might as well have stayed in Egypt we
[1:34:10] might as well have stayed under bondage
[1:34:12] that's not us we're the Bride of Jesus
[1:34:15] Christ that is not
[1:34:17] us we don't have to do that we don't
[1:34:20] have to deal with that verse 31 says and
[1:34:22] immediately
[1:34:25] just like in so many of our lives and
[1:34:27] immediately Jesus stretched forth his
[1:34:30] hand and caught him and said unto him oh
[1:34:34] thou of little faith wherefore D thou
[1:34:36] doubt yeah and when they were coming to
[1:34:39] the ship the wind ceased then they that
[1:34:41] were in the ship came and worshiped him
[1:34:44] saying of a truth Thou Art the Son of
[1:34:48] God thank you Lord the prophet goes on
[1:34:50] in the message the resurrection of jy's
[1:34:53] daughter he says now the Son of God
[1:34:55] spent much time in prayer before the
[1:34:57] cross and a healing the people that's
[1:35:00] right so you mean that Jesus spent time
[1:35:03] in prayer and waiting you mean that even
[1:35:06] Jesus had to
[1:35:08] wait he
[1:35:10] prayed oh it makes me wonder if if he
[1:35:13] got tired sometimes and stopped praying
[1:35:16] and just started complaining oh I've
[1:35:19] done it many of times you get deep in
[1:35:22] prayer but then you feel like you're
[1:35:23] getting where so you want to stop
[1:35:24] praying and start complaining you want
[1:35:27] to replace one with the
[1:35:29] other he goes on he says what just prior
[1:35:32] to our message tonight he crossed all
[1:35:34] the way across the sea went up on top of
[1:35:36] a mountain one evening after breaking
[1:35:38] bread and feeding 5,000 I wonder where
[1:35:41] he got the atoms or what Atom he turned
[1:35:43] loose rather when he fed 5,000 people
[1:35:46] with two little fishes and five loaves
[1:35:48] of bread five little biscuits and some
[1:35:50] that some little child had not only was
[1:35:53] the fish fish but it was cooked fish and
[1:35:56] cooked bread he'll go above and beyond
[1:35:59] what you even think your Victory is you
[1:36:02] think you know what the victory is but
[1:36:04] then God comes on the scene and he
[1:36:06] doubles it job went through what he went
[1:36:08] through and then his portion was greater
[1:36:11] after the after the battles after the
[1:36:14] strain after not knowing what to do
[1:36:17] right it was bigger yeah thank the Lord
[1:36:21] he goes on he says he done something no
[1:36:23] one knows yet but he did it because he
[1:36:25] was the Lord of creation and there upon
[1:36:28] the mountain he stood and watched the
[1:36:30] disciples as they was crossing the Sea
[1:36:32] The Little boat tossed about and just
[1:36:35] about ready to sink looked like and they
[1:36:37] seen someone coming and hear he come
[1:36:40] walking on the sea says about that's the
[1:36:43] way he does just about the time it gets
[1:36:45] very darkest of hour then Jesus comes
[1:36:48] along says we fret and worry we
[1:36:51] Christians right and the maybe get sick
[1:36:54] or something happens or somebody don't
[1:36:56] show up we're just so nervous and
[1:37:00] upset we should just sit quiet he's the
[1:37:03] one who commanded it we're living under
[1:37:06] his
[1:37:07] dispensation living under his grace
[1:37:09] thank God we are living under his grace
[1:37:12] that's
[1:37:13] right it says just sit still he'll be a
[1:37:17] after a while don't worry he'll open up
[1:37:19] a healing service somewhere or you'd be
[1:37:22] guided to somebody who pray for the sick
[1:37:24] when you got sickness listen to
[1:37:26] this this is shocking if not he'll just
[1:37:30] put it upon your heart so bad you'll
[1:37:32] just kneel down in the room and ask him
[1:37:35] about it yourself that's right so just
[1:37:37] remember he works all things together
[1:37:40] for good you don't have to wait on a
[1:37:42] healing service you don't have to wait
[1:37:44] on anything you don't have to wait on
[1:37:46] any man to do something for you because
[1:37:48] God's the one that's going to do it no
[1:37:50] matter if the man's there praying for
[1:37:51] you or if you're knelt beside your bed
[1:37:53] yeah it's the same God in both
[1:37:56] moments don't think you got to wait for
[1:37:58] some special preacher to come pray for
[1:38:00] you you can get down in your room in
[1:38:02] your prayer closet and you can do the
[1:38:04] pray in yourself you can pray through
[1:38:06] show God that you have the faith show
[1:38:08] him that that favor that he had for you
[1:38:10] that Grace that he put upon you for you
[1:38:12] to go through this test don't let it
[1:38:14] come out void but show him that you're
[1:38:16] made for that show them that he's made
[1:38:18] you for that that you can conquer
[1:38:21] anything through Christ that the enemy
[1:38:23] sends your way yes and then when you do
[1:38:26] it when that Miracle comes that healing
[1:38:29] comes just show it to the enemy yeah
[1:38:31] just show it to them we got a brother
[1:38:33] and sister in our church talking about
[1:38:36] the miracle being greater when it comes
[1:38:38] brother will and sister Lindsay they
[1:38:41] recently just got married and the doctor
[1:38:43] had told her that she could she couldn't
[1:38:45] have children the doctor had told her
[1:38:48] that that she there was just just
[1:38:50] straight no way it was happening and so
[1:38:53] brother Israel my pastor he was
[1:38:54] preaching I think one evening service on
[1:38:57] Abraham and
[1:38:58] Sarah and they both were sitting there
[1:39:01] and they just heard that and they just
[1:39:03] took it they just grabbed a hold of that
[1:39:05] promise and they said Lord this is in
[1:39:07] your this is your word now we're going
[1:39:10] to take a hold of this scripture right
[1:39:12] here and it's ours and I believe we can
[1:39:15] have that baby and now little will the
[1:39:18] baby that they've already had they can
[1:39:21] take to every church and they can say
[1:39:23] this this is that miracle that just got
[1:39:24] greater and greater and greater and now
[1:39:27] when the enemy tries to tell them
[1:39:29] something they can point back to little
[1:39:30] will and say what about that Miracle
[1:39:33] what about that you're saying I can't
[1:39:34] have this new one but what about that
[1:39:36] one that's a child that was born when
[1:39:38] the doctor said I couldn't have children
[1:39:41] what about that
[1:39:43] devil smack him in the face when he
[1:39:45] comes around smack him with your Miracle
[1:39:48] see if he likes it amen
[1:39:53] say I lost my play I if not oh i' done
[1:39:56] with that that
[1:39:58] quote but in closing now I'd just like
[1:40:01] to read that that quote it's from the
[1:40:03] sman church age and it really with the
[1:40:05] wise we go through stuff with different
[1:40:07] things it really opened my eyes to it
[1:40:10] why
[1:40:11] we a lot of people preach on about
[1:40:13] struggle and trials and tests but this
[1:40:15] when I saw this I just it really hit
[1:40:18] home to why we have to go through these
[1:40:20] things cuz sometimes it's hard to
[1:40:22] realize the why
[1:40:23] it's hard to realize why we have to wait
[1:40:25] even why do we have to be tried why
[1:40:28] would a God that that loves us so deeply
[1:40:31] as he said make us wait why would he do
[1:40:34] this stuff why would he care about how I
[1:40:37] react waiting on him why would he care
[1:40:40] about that come on this is it's in the
[1:40:44] sman church age and musicians you can go
[1:40:47] ahead and come
[1:40:49] up it says you see they could not figure
[1:40:53] out God's love they thought that love
[1:40:56] meant no suffering they thought that
[1:41:00] love meant a baby with parental care but
[1:41:03] God said that his love was elective love
[1:41:07] the proof of his love is election that
[1:41:10] no matter what happened his love was
[1:41:12] proven truly by the fact that they were
[1:41:15] chosen unto
[1:41:17] salvation thank you Lord he may commit
[1:41:19] you to death as he did Paul he may
[1:41:22] commit you to suffer uffing as he did
[1:41:24] job that is his
[1:41:26] prerogative he is Sovereign but it is
[1:41:30] all with a purpose if he did not have a
[1:41:33] purp I believe brother Ben might have
[1:41:34] spoke on that a little bit this morning
[1:41:36] about the purpose that is his
[1:41:38] prerogative he is Sovereign but it is
[1:41:40] all with a purpose if he did not have a
[1:41:42] purpose then he would be the author of
[1:41:45] frustration and not of Peace his purpose
[1:41:49] is that after we have suffered a while
[1:41:51] we would be made perfect
[1:41:53] be established strengthened and settled
[1:41:57] as job said he puts strengthen us but
[1:42:02] when when did the when did the Lord give
[1:42:04] job his strength after he had waited
[1:42:07] some time after he had went through what
[1:42:10] he was ordained to go through what he
[1:42:13] had to go through that's when he
[1:42:15] received his strength says you see he
[1:42:17] himself suffered now this is talking
[1:42:19] about the Lord right here he learned
[1:42:22] obedience the Lord Jesus Christ he
[1:42:24] learned obedience by the things that he
[1:42:27] suffered think about that he was
[1:42:30] actually made perfect by the things that
[1:42:33] he suffered thank you Lord says Hebrews
[1:42:36] 5: 8-9 though he were a son yet he
[1:42:40] learned yet learned he obedience by the
[1:42:42] things which he suffered and being made
[1:42:45] perfect he became the author of etern
[1:42:49] the author of Eternal salvation unto all
[1:42:51] them that obey him
[1:42:54] in plain language the very character of
[1:42:57] Jesus was perfected by Suffering The
[1:43:00] Very character of Jesus the character
[1:43:03] that we want was perfected by suffering
[1:43:06] so if it was perfected by suffering in
[1:43:09] Jesus what makes us think that it it
[1:43:12] won't be perfected in the same way in us
[1:43:15] why would we be any different why would
[1:43:17] we have an easier road if it was
[1:43:19] perfected that way in our Lord and
[1:43:21] savior
[1:43:23] and according to Paul he has left his
[1:43:25] church a measure of suffering that they
[1:43:27] too by their faith in God while
[1:43:30] suffering for him would come to a place
[1:43:32] of
[1:43:33] perfection why did he want this James 1:
[1:43:37] 2-4 says my brethren counted all joy
[1:43:40] when you fall into diverse Temptations
[1:43:42] who counts it Joy when you fall into
[1:43:44] Temptations come on no hands went up on
[1:43:46] that one last one was a lot of hands
[1:43:48] that one no hands said knowing this at
[1:43:51] the trying of your faith worketh
[1:43:54] patience but let patience have her
[1:43:56] perfect work that ye may be perfect and
[1:44:00] entire wanting
[1:44:02] nothing then it says why does he stand
[1:44:04] by the reason is in Romans 8:17 and 18
[1:44:08] and if children then heirs Heirs of God
[1:44:11] and Joint heirs with Christ if so be
[1:44:15] that we suffer with him that we may be
[1:44:18] also glorified together for I reckon
[1:44:22] that the sufferings of this present time
[1:44:24] are not worthy to be compared with the
[1:44:26] glory which shall be revealed in US says
[1:44:30] unless we suffer with him we cannot
[1:44:33] reign with him that's good you have to
[1:44:35] suffer to Reign the reason for this is
[1:44:39] that character simply is never made
[1:44:41] without suffering now listen to this
[1:44:44] next part this is what really struck me
[1:44:47] character is a
[1:44:49] victory not a
[1:44:51] gift character is a victory character is
[1:44:55] earned character is not just given it
[1:44:57] don't just drop down it is
[1:44:59] earned through
[1:45:01] sufferings not a gift but a
[1:45:05] victory says a man without character
[1:45:07] can't Reign because power apart from
[1:45:10] character is satanic but Power with
[1:45:12] character is fit to rule and since he
[1:45:15] wants us to share even his throne on the
[1:45:18] same basis that he overcame and to sit
[1:45:21] down in his father's throne then we have
[1:45:23] to overcome to sit with him and the
[1:45:27] little temporary suffering we go through
[1:45:30] now is not worthy to be compared to the
[1:45:33] tremendous Glory that will be revealed
[1:45:36] in us when he comes oh what Treasures
[1:45:40] are laid up for those who are willing to
[1:45:42] enter into his kingdom through much
[1:45:45] tribulation think it not strange
[1:45:47] concerning the fiery trials that are to
[1:45:49] try you that is what Peter said is it
[1:45:52] strange that God wants us to develop a
[1:45:54] Christlike character that comes through
[1:45:56] suffering no sir and we all have trials
[1:46:00] we are all tried and chastened his sons
[1:46:03] not one but goes through that now listen
[1:46:06] to this
[1:46:06] line the church that is not suffering
[1:46:10] and is not being tried hasn't got it it
[1:46:13] isn't of God the church that is not
[1:46:17] suffering and also I believe the people
[1:46:19] in the church that aren't going through
[1:46:20] some stuff that's right that just shows
[1:46:23] that is I I can't remember what where
[1:46:25] it's at but it's called Uh there's a
[1:46:27] scripture that calls it the Manifest
[1:46:30] token come on the Manifest token it's an
[1:46:33] evidence that God is with you that he is
[1:46:37] working with you says Hebrews 126 and 8
[1:46:41] for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth
[1:46:44] and scourgeth every son whom he
[1:46:46] receiveth but if ye be without
[1:46:49] chastisement whereof all are partakers
[1:46:52] then are ye bastards and not Sons it
[1:46:56] says but hearing that it makes the
[1:46:58] waiting and the tests a little bit
[1:47:00] easier when you go through them when you
[1:47:02] hear a quote like that it gives you some
[1:47:04] understanding it makes those times a
[1:47:06] little bit it softens them up a little
[1:47:08] bit knowing that there there's some
[1:47:11] there's some victory in your character
[1:47:13] right on the other side of that test or
[1:47:16] that trial there's something waiting for
[1:47:18] you thank the Lord you just got to wait
[1:47:21] on the Lord sometimes you got to do less
[1:47:24] talking sometimes and do some listening
[1:47:27] see what he's got to tell you see what
[1:47:30] he wants to tell you we don't serve a
[1:47:32] God that just wants to be mean to us we
[1:47:34] don't serve a God that wants to mistreat
[1:47:36] us but we serve a God that wants us to
[1:47:38] be more like him be more Christlike have
[1:47:41] a Christlike character is that
[1:47:45] right Amen brother Joel
[1:47:53] shall
[1:47:55] renew their
[1:47:57] strength they shall Mount
[1:48:01] up with
