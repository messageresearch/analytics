What a blessing it is to be a a child of God. What a blessing to hear your word and to know that before the foundation of the world, we were in your thoughts. And we thank you for that tonight. We we don't take that for granted. Lord, if there's anything in us that needs to change, I pray that you would change it by your word tonight, by your spirit. I pray you'd move me out of the way, Lord. Speak directly to your children tonight. And Lord, you you know how to tutor us, how to grow us up into what we ought to be. I pray that you'd help us to be that tonight and to do that. Lord, that we could be placed in such a way that we could be beneficial to others in the body of Christ. Pray that you'd grant it now. Heal the sick. Touch everyone that has a need. We pray in Jesus' name. Amen. Thank the Lord Jesus. Thank you, Lord. You love him tonight. It's good to be back with you. Um, I was telling the folks that come Sunday. I do preach sometimes here at the church. So, it's good to be back. Wasn't that good Sunday morning though? Did y'all enjoy Brother Stewart Sunday morning? We really, really enjoyed that. It's very fed my soul. I'd heard a lot of good preaching over the weekend, but I heard some good preaching on Sunday morning as well. Ephesians chapter 1 and verse 5. As we continue to get into the book of Ephesians, we haven't gotten very far. and and we're going to slow down for a little while and uh really get into this. I want to speak to you tonight on adoption predestined predestinated unto adoption. Ephesians 1:5, having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will. Aren't you glad to be in his will? That means you're part of his plan. Amen. What can the devil do to you if you're part of God's plan? Thank the Lord. God bless you. You may be seated tonight. I want to make a disclaimer right at the beginning that we won't say everything there is to say about adoption tonight. We're going to get into this in depth that the Lord allows me to and as he leads me to uh and and we just you just pray for me. We'll do that. But it's only a background tonight. We're going to do a lot of reading. So you just bear with me tonight. Just going to go ahead and get comfortable. That jacket's a little warm and a little small. You glad you come to church on a Wednesday night? &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon makes a statement. He says, "What is adoption?" That's how he begins explaining adoption in the adoption series. I think it's actually in adoption number two. Brother Brandon begins to explain adoption. What is adoption? And uh the first thing that comes to mind when we think about adoption is we think about adopting a baby. And what brother Brandham is talking about is something completely different. Right? So it's not taking a child from one family and placing them in another family, but it's actually coming to a place of maturity in your own life or in uh in the church as we'll see the church coming to a place of maturity or the individual coming to a place of maturity. God bless you, brother Wald. It's so good to see you in church. I didn't see you Sunday morning, but it's good to have you back there. But you, it's a place of maturity. It's not a It's not coming from one family to the other because you always were a child of God. So he says you were predestinated. That's what Paul's saying in Ephesians 1:5. You were predestinated unto adoption. How many believe that tonight? So what that means is you were predestinated to maturity. You were not just predestinated to be a child of God or to be a Christian, but to be a mature Christian. And especially in the age that we're living in. So the church was predestinated to be a mature church. There would come a maturity. There would become a manifestation. There would come a fullness of time. It wouldn't just stay in its in its infant stage all the time or the entire gentile age, but it would actually become something far more. So brother Brandham goes into this. He said, "Your adoption is not your birth. Your adoption is not your birth. Your adoption is your placing." And again, we want to be very careful with that because people making a mystery out of a mystery and trying to push an agenda many times will get into it and actually make adoption something that it's not. Brother Brandham actually changes the language that he uses after the seals and he begins to talk about placing and it begins to talk about maturity and about sunship and the opening of the word and things that we recognize more than maybe we would the term adoption but it's the same thing. So your adoption is not your birth. Your adoption is your placing. When you were born again, when we are born of the spirit of God, we are sons of God. How many believe that tonight? So, you are a son of God when you're born of the spirit of God. But we were predestinated. He said, "Now, here's what I'm trying to get you to for the sons of the last day." He said, "We were predestinated unto adoption." He said, "Now, this is what hurts Pentecostal a little. They say, I got born again. Praise the Lord. Got the Holy Ghost. Fine. You're a child of God." That's right. He said, "But yet, that ain't what I'm talking about." Right? So, there's something beyond your birth. And I guess uh you know in my purpose in preaching this is to uh let us know that uh there's more to it than just being born. There's more to it than just being in church. &gt;&gt; There's more to it than just being a believer. In fact, the devil believes and trembles, but he he can't believe what you believe. He can't be what you are, but yet he believes the word of God. He can believe the written word. It come to me the other day that the devil can believe the written word. What he can't believe is the manifested word. &gt;&gt; He believed and quoted the scripture to Jesus when he tempted him, but he could not believe that Jesus was the Christ. And and so that's what he doubted. And and so it's not enough just to believe. It's not enough. And brother Brandon makes these same points in the token message. He said, "You've got to display the token." So I want to you to think about that. Displaying the token is a place of maturity beyond the token itself, beyond just receiving the token. There's actually a place where you can display it where where you it can begin to work in your life. It can begin to be effective in your life. So what we want is not just people who have become Christians or people who say they believe the message. What we want is people who actually live the message and become the message. Don't is that what you want tonight? I don't want to just be a Christian and name only. I want to be what God wants me to be in the age that he has planted me in. &gt;&gt; So you were predestinated unto adoption. Adoption is placing a son. Placing a son. So it's not the new birth. It's not just simply receiving the Holy Ghost, but it's placing a son. Where does brother Brandham get this from? He get this gets this from Galatians chapter 4. If you'll turn there with me. Galatians chapter 4 and verse one. Paul explains what adoption or or that maturity was like uh how a a son would come to full age during that time according to the law. And Paul says, "Now I say that the heir and that's the that's the child, the person who's the legal heir, as long as he is a child, differereth nothing from a servant." Word servant is slave. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. Some of you kids could say amen to that. Right. But the heir, as long as he's a child, differereth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all. So, so he's born owner, right? The future owner of the property, right? He he's he's a son of the owner. He's born that way. And yet, as a child in his immaturity, he doesn't have any say over anything, &gt;&gt; right? So he owns everything but has no authority over anything. So do you see how adoption begins to come in? Adoption is actually uh is actually bringing the the the child into a place of uh of not having uh not just being a child. Not just being a son, not just saying I'm predestinated, but actually having the authority to speak something. and and brother Brandham takes that into a a place of being able to say to the mountain, "Be thou removed and cast into the sea and being able to sign your name on the checkbook and all of those things." And listen to me. I'm going to give this away at the beginning so you see where we're going. But this is the age of that. This is the age of the fullness. This is the age when we have the potential to do that. &gt;&gt; How many believe that tonight? So now he said he's he's though he be lord of all but it's under tutors and governors. That's teachers and teachers and uh uh I'm searching for a word here. I had it. I should have written it down. But it's a teacher and a guardian is what it is. A teacher and a guardian until the time appointed of the father. So the father has got an appointed time that the son is supposed to come into his maturity. Now Paul types this to the law and and becoming grace. So the law was just a teacher to bring us to grace. &gt;&gt; It was a temporary condition, &gt;&gt; right? To bring us to grace. So he said, "But when the fullness of time was come," he said, he said, "Even when we were children, we're in bondage under the illness of the world. But when the fullness of the time was come, God sent forth his son made of a woman, made under the law to redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons." So what he's saying is there had to come a full age. A time when uh what happened Christ had to come to full age, &gt;&gt; right? That was the mature one that God would put his confidence in and his trust in so that he could begin to speak. He was the word and it begin to speak. And that's I don't want to scare you tonight, but that's where he wants to bring us to. He don't want to just make us another church. He don't want to just make us another denomination. We're not here just to have good services. We're not here just to shout and dance and run the hours. That's good. Well, that's part of it. But that's not what we're here for. We're here to become so much more than that. That that you could actually become a a a person, a son or daughter of God with the authority to speak and to and to you say, "Well, if my pastor was there, so and so was there, Brother Brandon was there." No. It could be a situation that you didn't have anybody to help you, but you're a son of God. you're a daughter of God and you can speak to your mountain and see it begin to be moved. &gt;&gt; So that's where he brought Christ to that adoption of sons. But it's the adoption of sons, not just the adoption of the son, right? &gt;&gt; So in the CSB study Bible, it says in the ancient world, an underage heir had no right to his inheritance. It was temporarily like that. temporarily in the same legal situation as a slave owning nothing. So, he's not a slave. But how is he not a slave? In his potential. Do you see where I'm going tonight? Listen, if you were just born again, you were you just come into the house of God, you just come through justification, maybe you're at the very first stage of being born again, right? You you're the elected of God. You belong to God. You're every bit as much a Christian as anybody else. &gt;&gt; You're not a slave, &gt;&gt; right? But but you still in many ways live as a slave. &gt;&gt; And there's addictions and struggles and all kinds of things that maybe you got to work your way through and and a mindset of slavery, a mindset of, you know, and and so you're still working your way through that, but you're not a slave. You belong to God because your potential is more than that. You might live just like everybody else does. You might have had just as bad a life as anybody else had, but you're becoming something more than that. So don't give up where you're at. Remember, there's a potential for so much more in the age that you live in. That's what I love about this message. This message doesn't leave us and just say, "Well, we have grace. We have we're elected. We're called. And so we'll just we'll just trust God somehow to get us through." We should trust God, but we trust God not just to get us to heaven, but to make us real sons and daughters of God that can live in this present world and have victory over the enemy, victory over the things that are going on in our lives. Yes, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; So, the the word child there in Galatians 4:1, a child is nepio, one that does not talk. So, And some children still talk but but this was a child. That's what the Greek word child means. One that does not talk. The word epos is word that's a minor an infant immature intellectually and morally in contrast with telio or tell it all. I'm not sure that's a correct translation, but Tellio is an adult, full grown, &gt;&gt; he speaks, right? So, a non-speaking child contrasted with a speaking adult, somebody who can speak intelligently. So uh it's talking about how that you know in in the time of the law the people were brought through the tutorship of the law to Christ and then the tutor had done his job and he left them there and they come to Christ. Now it it's shown that the capability of airship which was first conferred through Christ could not enter earlier into the history of mankind. So there was a time, right? When the fullness of time was come, God was born of a woman, &gt;&gt; right? It had to be time, &gt;&gt; this is very important. It couldn't happen earlier than that. It had to be a time &gt;&gt; that the fullness could come into the world. And even though Isaiah spoke it and even in Genesis it was spoken of all down through the histories and and ages it was spoken of. But there had to come a time when a virgin would conceive and he would become a a full-grown son. And even in Jesus life, there was a time he didn't begin his ministry right away. In fact, he was 30 years old when he began his ministry. There was a time there was a time he went up on Mount Transfiguration. There was a time of fullness of time. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? Just like you have a time, &gt;&gt; just like this age had a time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, so the the time wasn't right. Mankind was still in its minority and its majority, its sunship was first entered upon through Christ. &gt;&gt; What does Romans 10:4 say? For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone that believeth. Christ is the end of the law. So the law was a temporary condition under Moses right under the tutor &gt;&gt; until the son became of full age right and he become the adopted son. Now the Bible says that we know that all things someone say all things &gt;&gt; work together for good to them that love God &gt;&gt; to them who are the called according to his purpose. for whom he did forno. He that means he he knew you. He knew about you. He knew everything you would do and everything you would be. He he predestinated you to be conformed to the image of his son. So he didn't predestinate you to be you. &gt;&gt; He predestinated you to be changed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What does it say? He predestinated you to be changed or conformed to the image of his son. So you were to be changed into a son of God. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? You were a son of God in seed form, but he wanted you to be changed into a a full-blown son of God. &gt;&gt; And he said, for whom he did forno, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son. Uh listen, not just doing baby stuff, not just squabbling about, you know, I know people, they just stay in the land of hurt feelings and they remain in the in the minority of their lives. They just always remained in this place where they just fuss and fight and squabble. But we're called to do something more than that. We're called to do something more than fight over who gets to preach when and who gets to do this win and who gets to who gets this person in their church or that person in their church. We've been called beyond that. We've been given a message to come to maturity. &gt;&gt; Preach. Now, &gt;&gt; we're not called to just stay here. &gt;&gt; I got this microphone I want to preach tonight. &gt;&gt; You just bear with me. I'm trying to be good. Now, I've been studying this for a while. Just trying and tonight we're just kind of laying a background, but I believe it'll be something good in it. There's the word is always good, isn't it? Yes. &gt;&gt; Now, you know, we could preach on some things that it wouldn't touch some people, right? If I preach on healing, there's some people maybe don't need physical healing, right? Maybe very few of us, but there are some. And if you preach there some things you preach on salvation, some people, many people don't need that. They've already been saved. What are we preaching on? We're preaching on something that affects all of us. &gt;&gt; Because let me give you a little bit of preview here. None of us have gotten there yet, &gt;&gt; right? None of us have come to the fullness of our adoption, &gt;&gt; but this is the age for it, &gt;&gt; hallelujah. This is the time for it. This is the era of it. If there, if it's ever going to be preached, now is the time to preach it because the fullness of it is the change of these bodies. He don't want to just change our souls. He don't want to just change our minds. He don't But he wants to change our bodies. &gt;&gt; Say, God, have your perfect work in me. I want to be that person that's changed. I want to be different than what I was. I want to be different than what my what my upbringing is or what my what my complexes are, what I what the things I want to be different than that. I want to be all that you want me to be. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So he he he he predestined us to be conformed to the image of his son. What's he saying? The same thing he said in Ephesians 1:5. You are predestinated to the adoption of sons. &gt;&gt; Right? to be conformed to the image of his son, that he might be the firstborn &gt;&gt; among many brethren. &gt;&gt; Moreover, whom he did predestinate, &gt;&gt; them he also called. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. No more and no less. &gt;&gt; Whom he called, them he also justified. &gt;&gt; Whom he justified, them he also glorified. Don't give up because you're down here in a baby condition, but move on. Come on up into something greater. come on up into the message of the hour, &gt;&gt; right? And that's where we always got to be. And you know, I want to take it easy on people. I don't want to force the message on people that aren't ready for it. But I'll say this. You got to move on at some point. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; At some point, you got to believe the message and move on and and and just believe and and be able to say amen to it. You said, "Well, I don't understand." At some point, you got to be able to believe it &gt;&gt; and move on and become a full-g grown son or daughter of God, &gt;&gt; right? Because this has to mature so that this outer body can be changed to match it. There's got to be a condition of the soul that'll match the condition that we got to be in for the rapture. Oh my, I want my body changed. How many wants their body changed? In order to have a body changed, you had to have this message. You cannot come to a rapture without a shout. &gt;&gt; Huh? Revelation 1 Thessalonians 4, he said there would be a shout, a voice, and a trumpet. You cannot come. Oh my. You cannot come to the rapture without that shout. You must hear the voice of God. You must hear the shout of that was a brother Brandham taught us was the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; You must hear that to be in a rapture. I want to be there. &gt;&gt; I don't want to get in by the skin of my teeth. I don't want to go through the tribulation period. You know, people say, "Why don't you preach more in the tribulation period?" period. Well, cuz I want to avoid it. &gt;&gt; Quite literally. &gt;&gt; There's going to be a squeeze. Is there going to be a crackdown? There's going to be all that. Well, I'm I'm doing my best to avoid it all. &gt;&gt; Whatever happens happens, but I'll say this. I'm ready to go home. &gt;&gt; Lord, just help me be ready. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, look, he said, moreover, whom he did predestin, he also called. We read that. Brother Brandham introduces that idea. Now, so adoption, what is adoption? It's bringing you from a minority state to a majority state. &gt;&gt; Does that make sense? From a child &gt;&gt; to an adult, &gt;&gt; right? So, it' be like with our children, they turn 18. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. But if if you're a dad, you understand that just cuz they're 18 don't mean they're an adult, &gt;&gt; right? You know that they got to be there's certain things that have to happen in their life, &gt;&gt; right? That's why some young people, not any here, but but there are young people who physically or mentally cannot become an adult, right? &gt;&gt; And so what what they just stay in that infant stage? Well, there's Christians like that, &gt;&gt; but I believe if you're born into this word age, you're called to be &gt;&gt; a son, a full-grown son of God, &gt;&gt; so we don't want to stay in that stage. And and but but that would be kind of what it would be to us. Maybe 21 &gt;&gt; would be a better number, right? And 18, 21, there's certain things you can do and certain things that you can uh you can sign your name to and things. when you're 21 years old, you can just about uh you're free and 21, as they say. You're just able to do what you want to do. And that's that's a good thing. But but that's kind of the idea of adoption is that it's bringing you through this. You needed a tutor. But in order to inherit the son, the son that was there, he had to do more than just be there. He had to actually perform in a certain way. He had to show himself capable of handling the father's estate or the estate would never be handed over to him, &gt;&gt; right? And and so he had to show himself capable. So Brandham introduces that idea of adoption to the age, right? To the church as a whole. And so he said adoption, let me show you why it's done. Now he said a father has a big kingdom. He rides around. He said now he's got a son born. Oh, he's so happy. He said that's God. Sister Joanna, I don't want to scare you. I I can I I know already I'm not going to get through all these slides. So he said, "So, you know what that father does? He finds the very best razor. I like that razor. R A I S E R. Tutor, right? A person to raise the child." So, a tutor in that age wouldn't be wouldn't be like a teacher we have today. Brother Gabe, aren't you glad that if you're a a teacher that you you you can leave the kids at class? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. Aren't you glad you Sunday school teachers, aren't you? Maybe I better not go there. Aren't you glad you don't have to take them all home with you, &gt;&gt; right? You get to leave them there. But that's not the way a tutor did in that time. A tutor that was called uh to to a certain home to tutor this child was with them 24/7. &gt;&gt; They were called to raise them. &gt;&gt; Huh? To to be their tutor, to be their raiser. He said, "You know what a tutor is, don't you? It's a school teacher. He finds the very best school teacher he can find in all the country. He don't just get a scallwag. He wants his boy to be a real fellow. &gt;&gt; He said he'd be an honest tutor. He wouldn't be no bishop or general overseer. He said he didn't get no bishop or general overseer. He got the Holy Ghost. That was his tutor. Aren't you glad he did? He said, "Uh-huh. To raise his children." So, it's the Holy Ghost that raises the church. Why we say you must be born again. You've got to have the Holy Ghost cuz that's when your raising starts &gt;&gt; right now. He said that was his tutor to raise his children. All right. Then how would you know the Holy Ghost knows it? I love this. He speaks through human lips. So something had to happen in our day, brother Harold, for something had to happen for us to have confidence in the tutor &gt;&gt; to be able to listen to what he was saying. Something had to grab our attention. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost had to speak through human lips. &gt;&gt; Go to that next slide, Sister Joanna. He said, I got to turn around here where I can see it. He said, "How do you know then he's telling the truth?" How do we know that the Holy Ghost is leading us in the right direction? How do you know he's telling the truth? When you see the Holy Spirit speaking through lips, that's telling the truth exactly every time, predicting and coming to pass just perfectly like Samuel said, then you know that's truthmen, &gt;&gt; right? What what they say? Let none of his words fall to the ground, &gt;&gt; right? It's coming, right? Because God says, Hallelujah. If he speaks and what he says don't come to pass, don't hear him because I'm not with him. But if he does, well then hear him cuz I'm with him. &gt;&gt; Right? He said now. So, so what had to happen? What had to happen? There had to be the Holy Spirit had to speak through lips. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And say, "Your name is." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. You realize how important that was in our age &gt;&gt; that a prophet would speak and say, "Your name is so and so." &gt;&gt; You were born on a certain street. You had this happen to you when you were a child. Why was he able to say it? Give us confidence. in the tutor. We listen church. We need to have confidence in the Holy Ghost tonight. We need to have confidence in the message of the hour. When we saw the accuracy of it, that was the confidence. That's why we don't we don't stand for any kind of impersonation. &gt;&gt; Right? Because an impersonator will cause you to doubt the accuracy of the real. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; That's what Janice and Jambers did. That's what Dayan and Kora did. They cause people to doubt. That's what the charismatic move has done. Cause people to doubt the accuracy of the word. But we had a prophet who God did not let his words fall to the ground. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; God says if he speaks and what he says don't come to pass, don't hear him &gt;&gt; cuz I'm not with him. &gt;&gt; But if he does, hear him cuz I'm with him. He said, now then he goes around. I don't know. What do you think that tutor would say if you had to go up to the father and say, "Your children's acting awful." I tell you, that boy of yours, he's a renegade. He's a rouseabout. I never seen such a fellow. That girl of yours, oh, I don't know what you're going to do with her. You know what? She's all painted up like some of them girls over yonder, Philistines. Yes, sir. She just wants to act just like they do. My daughter? Yes, your daughter. That's what Now listen church. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon's talking about more than individuals. Although he is speaking to individuals, but he's talking about more than that. &gt;&gt; He's talking about a church, &gt;&gt; right? That had not come to an age of maturity even though the time for the maturity had come. &gt;&gt; So it was the end of the Leoian church age. And God called a prophet to tell him, you've not come to the maturity that you should have come to. You need to have confidence in the Holy Ghost. You need to have conf oh my confidence in the word. And some of us caught it. Some people caught it, but many didn't catch it. Many people just continued on in their denominations and fussing and fighting and and carrying on the way that they were. But brother told, the reason you have gifts out of order, the reason you have family life out of order, the reason that you have all of these things wrong is because that you're not come to that place of maturity and you need something to happen. What needed to happen? Malachi 4 needed to happen. Revelation 10:1-7 needed to happen. Luke 17:30 needed to happen to give us confidence in the opening of the word that we could come to the fullness of maturity. &gt;&gt; A voice of authority had to speak. &gt;&gt; He said, "My daughter, yes, your daughter." That's what the Holy Spirit has to say about the church today. He said, 'N no wonder we can't have a revival. What about your son? Same thing. Well, you know, you always said those sheep could hurt in that pasture up there on that sheep food up there. Yeah. You know what he did? He drove them down there in that weed pile. Now, Brother Brand was talking to preachers. They just took them down there and dumped them all in that creek. Let them lay around that weed pile, eating them old willows, and they're so poor they can't hardly get out of there. He said, "That's bishops, pastors who deny the power thereof." &gt;&gt; Listen, church, we're all human beings. I'm a human being. I I get sick sometimes, but I know a healer. &gt;&gt; I get tired sometimes, but I know a sustainer of strength. I get I get worried sometimes, but I know one who gives peace that passes all understanding. I I may not, but let me point you to him. Let me take you to the place where the food is. Let me take you not to a weed pile of the world and just say everything's okay, but let me point you back to somebody who's got all the answers. I don't have all the answers, but Christ has all the answers. Do you believe that tonight? &gt;&gt; He said he drove them down that weed pile, took them down there and dumped them all in that creek, let them lay around that weed pile, eating them old willows. They're so poor they can't hardly get out of there. That's bishop's pastors that deny the power there. Well, I tell you the truth, I never seen such a bunch of nervous sheep in my life. So the tutor, &gt;&gt; the Holy Ghost is coming back to the father and telling him bunch of nervous sheep. And brother Brandon said he don't like that, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Nervous sheep. They haven't been taught who they are. &gt;&gt; Right? They think a preacher can take them out of it. &gt;&gt; Have we labored in Ephesians in the beginning of Ephesians to find out who we are? &gt;&gt; Find out we weren't called by a preacher. We weren't called by by a mother somewhere or a father. We were called by God. We were predestined by God unto adoption. We were we were called by God to be who we are. &gt;&gt; So God don't like nervous sheep. &gt;&gt; He don't like that under that legalistic, you know, weeds. Are are you with me now? &gt;&gt; He don't like that. You know, and you know what them cattle up here, you know, you told them feed on that alphaalfpha up there, you know, to make them fat. You know what he's given them? said giving them iron weeds, making them join societies and said, "You never seen such a thing in your life." You know what he's doing? Going along out there smoking a big cigar, reared back. Got his wife with him. She's wearing shorts just like the Philistines are doing out there. &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's the kind of message the Holy Spirit has to take about church today. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon said, "That's adoption." &gt;&gt; You see how simple that is? We just had to be taught. I didn't just automatically know that it was wrong to do certain things. Brother Danny, why do we know what we know? Because of the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Why do we know what we know? Because God sent a prophet our way. He said, "Brother Ben, you talk about that a lot. But if you can ever grab the reality of that, &gt;&gt; right? That that the message was given. It wasn't just given to us to give us something to fight about. It was given to us to give us something to feed on &gt;&gt; so we could feed on it. So we could become what it's talking about. We would know what to do and what not to do and how to act and how not to act. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Right? And to be full-grown children of God. &gt;&gt; So he said that's adoption. What did he do? He predestined us unto adoption. He give us the Holy Ghost. But wait a minute, adoption. He said that's what we're talking about. He talked about how they refuse to cooperate with healing meetings. And he he said, "Here I come and tell him the truth right out of your word. Here it is. I read your laws to him exactly what to do and he won't listen. He said, "Oh, that was for another age, another son, some other time." That don't mean me. &gt;&gt; What is that lack of maturity, &gt;&gt; right? He's not ready. Not ready for the message. Come on, church. Not ready for the age he's living in. &gt;&gt; But a real born son that's born in the age of adoption, into the age of the opening of the word, the open book, that son is able to say, "I know he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. I know it's for me. I know I can be born again. I know I can be happy. I know I can live for God. I know I can have the victory. Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; I know I can have my healing now. He said, "Don't you see where the church misses its placing? Why we haven't got revivals? Why haven't we haven't got things going on? That's where it lays." &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. Now, listen to me. We don't we don't necessarily need to hear something new. &gt;&gt; That's right. Yeah. &gt;&gt; To have revival, &gt;&gt; we need to get back to what we do know. &gt;&gt; We don't necessarily need to be worked up into revival. &gt;&gt; Church, we need to come to a place where we believe what we have. &gt;&gt; Where we can be excited about what we do have. &gt;&gt; Well, if we just had this, that, or the other, if we just had an exciting preacher, if we just had a a great ministry come by. I appreciate exciting preaching. Never did like boring preaching myself. I don't even like my own preaching. I I but but if it's the message of the hour, we should feed on it. We should grab a hold of it. It should mean something to us. It should warm our hearts and our souls. &gt;&gt; Brother said that's why we don't have revivals. That's where it lays. You talked about Joshua placing the tribes. Now he'd place them where they ought to be and they were over there fraternizing with the Philistines instead of doing what they were supposed to be doing. He said, ' Don't you imagine that man, the Holy Spirit blushes before the father when he has to say that. Oh my. I told him, but he wouldn't listen. I told him and let him read it right there in the book. He said, "I had a little minister come by." So, I know I'm going slow tonight, but just bear with me for a minute. So, here was a person that would not listen to the ministry when the Holy Spirit sent a little minister. God, help me to be pliable. &gt;&gt; Help me to be able to learn something in church. &gt;&gt; I had an old preacher one time come to church where I was the pastor at up at Bransville. And he told me one time with JT, he said, "I don't come here to learn anything." And that's exactly where he stayed. &gt;&gt; I was a young preacher. He was an old preacher. But he was exactly right. He didn't learn a thing. &gt;&gt; But can we be little enough &gt;&gt; to be mature? where we could actually come to church to learn something. &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, the pastor's preaching tonight, so or maybe some other preacher's preaching tonight, so I won't learn anything." No, if you come to church with an open heart and a hungry heart, say, "Lord, feed me tonight. I want some of that alpha alpha. I want some I don't want them weeds. I want the richness of the word. I want the depth of the word. I want the truth of God. &gt;&gt; I don't want to just come and hear my neighbors preached on." You know, there's people, excuse me tonight, but there's people who just come to church just to pitchfork. &gt;&gt; The only tool that they bring to the feeding table is a pitchfork. And they just constantly throw it on somebody. I don't want to do that. I don't want to come to church just to throw it off on some brother Bill or or Brother Paul or somebody else. Lord, help me to bring a rake where I can pull it to me. Help me to be a person who who pulls it to me. He said, "Lord, let that let that become reality in my life. I don't want just everybody else to get straightened out. I want to be straightened out. &gt;&gt; I want to be right." &gt;&gt; Well, what would our church services be like if we'd all just come like that &gt;&gt; instead of disgruntled? &gt;&gt; I don't even know who I'm preaching to tonight, but somebody is getting fed. people disgruntled and just, "Well, it's the same old Alpha Alpha, but isn't it Alpha Alpha?" &gt;&gt; If it's the message, it is. But they wouldn't let that little minister come by and show him that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. You know what? He let one of them old goat herders come over here and tell him that was for another age. Yes, sir. They sure like him over in that country, the goat herder. But I tell you, he sure don't know how to feed sheep. &gt;&gt; That's one thing about it. He just won't listen to me, says the Holy Spirit. I tried to tell him that you're the same yesterday, today, and forever. That he just won't do it. He's the biggest coward I ever seen in my life. &gt;&gt; He talked about how people would begin to pattern after television and smoking and drinking and all of those things. And oh, it was just an awful picture. It's an awful story that the Holy Ghost had to tell the father. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? But then he changed the picture. He said, "Now let's change the picture." &gt;&gt; Now the father, his son is a good boy. His father right along. Here's a tutor. The Holy Spirit, which which way the Holy Spirit, he said, I'm going to walk. So look at the difference in the attitude. &gt;&gt; The one said, "You're not going to teach me nothing." &gt;&gt; But here comes one who says, "Lord, wherever you walk, that's where I want to walk." How many could have that attitude tonight? Wherever you walk, Lord, wherever you whatever you decide to bring me, that's what I want. I want to be changed. I want to be mature. I want to I want to grow to full age. I want to come to my potential as a son or daughter of God. My family needs healing. The people around me, I don't have time to squabble and fuss and fight and pick at preachers and pick at deacons and pick at song leaders and pick at the church. I I don't have time for that. There's healing in that's needed in my family. There there's salvation that's needed in my children. I need something from you, Lord. Let me become a full son or daughter of God. Let me grow into this age of adoption so that I can be everything you want me to be and I can speak to my mountains cuz they're big. &gt;&gt; They're in my way and I need to be able to speak to them. &gt;&gt; So, how do I do that? I learn to walk with the Holy Spirit. Yes. &gt;&gt; I feel his presence here tonight. Let's just walk with him for a minute. &gt;&gt; You say, "Oh, I'll go right with you." Oh, the hill is awful high, son. I'll go right with you. I got confidence in you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This message didn't take me away from the Holy Spirit. It gave me confidence in the Holy Spirit. And people say, "Well, be we're beyond the age of a tutor. I still need the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; to lead me and to guide me. I've not come to the fullness of my adoption till I get that body change. I need him." &gt;&gt; The child said, "I'll walk right with you. I'll go right with you. Oh, the hill is awful high, son. But I got confidence in you. If I start getting tired, he'll raise my hand up and hold me on. But there's lions up on the hill there. Don't matter as long as you're around. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Don't make a bit of difference. I'll face whatever needs to be faced. I'll go wherever you want me to go. I'll do whatever needs to be done. &gt;&gt; Cuz I'm walking with the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; God, give me that kind of confidence today. Don't matter as long as you're around. Don't make a bit of difference. I'm walking right along with you. Yes. &gt;&gt; See the boy, he couldn't get his eyes on what his neighbor was doing, what somebody else was doing. Just let me walk with the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Don't get my eyes on the church down the road. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Such a danger in our day and age. Don't get my eyes on what's not being done or what is being done or what somebody else could do better. Lord, let me walk with you. &gt;&gt; Let me walk with you. Hallelujah. Remember when when when when the spirit of God spoke to brother Brandham, he said, "Walk with me and he be to walk with him and pretty soon his body changed." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What was it? A prefigure of the rapture. He said, "I looked at myself and I realized here was a a 20-year-old man again. Don't you realize that if we walk with the Holy Spirit one of these days, hallelujah, we're going to reach the fullness of our adoption." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. So, there's trouble up there. It's slick rocks. I don't care as long as you're holding my hand. &gt;&gt; I'll walk right with you. I'll walk right with you. Oh, you know what? Your dad used to do that. Glory to God. Oh, he had the same attitude. He said, "Whatever the father does, I do. Wherever he goes, that's where I go. Get up on top of the hill there." He said, "You know what, Father? Your son is just like a chip off the old block." Hallelujah. He's absolutely exactly like you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, that's what I want the report to be tonight. Your son is just like you. When he's reviled, he reviles not again. When he's cursed, he threatens not. No matter what happens to him, he's not afraid. He's going on anyway. He's walking with the Holy Spirit, the dove leading the lamb. He is absolutely exactly like you. Every word that you say, he says amen to it. How many can say amen to that tonight? Every word that he says, I got confidence. It's the word of God. He I I I'm a chip off the old block. I can say absolutely amen to every word of God. &gt;&gt; I had him turn over in the Bible the other day and said, "Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever." You know what he said? He screamed, throwed his hands up in the air, and said, "Hallelujah." &gt;&gt; Wonder how many sons we've got that have reached full age. reach the age of maturity can say amen to every word of God. You know it said here in your word, you know where you said the works he that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also. Yeah. I remember writing that to my son. Oh, when he saw that, he just screamed and jumped up and down, hollered. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; He wasn't just dancing with music. &gt;&gt; What was he doing? The word thrilled him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, let the word thrill me. I know those people claim to have all of the word and they're dead as a doornail. Listen, if you just listen to what you're reading, if you'll just run that through your brain a little bit and get a picture of what you're talking about, it it'll it'll bring an excitement to your soul. It'll bring a a bounce to your step. It'll bring a dance to your feet. It'll bring an amen out of your lips. &gt;&gt; Why? Because you realize it's God that's speaking. You got confidence in the message. You haven't had a preacher minister questions to you. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; But somebody who believes the message. Well, that's a refreshing thought, isn't it? Well, don't you want somebody to preach to you that actually believes the message of the hour? Actually believes God means what he says, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; Take all the world out of me, &gt;&gt; oh God. Oh, could we make that our cry tonight? Take all the world out of me, Lord. I want to say amen to every word. Take the world out of take away the bitterness and the strife and the fussing and the fighting and the backbiting. Make me a child of God. Take away the worldliness. Take away the the the the dress and the and the fashion and the and the smoking and the drink. Whatever it is of the world, let me take it. Let me get it out of me. &gt;&gt; Remember what brother Brandham said. When you apply the token, I'm connecting those two things for a reason. Because brother Brandham does in desperation connects adoption to the token &gt;&gt; and and actually talks about how oh God there was something more than just saying I have the Holy Ghost. But but it's living that life and having that token on display. He said, "Clean your house out and apply the token to your family." Oh, the father said, "I'm happy for that, son. That's a fine son." All right, keep an eye on him for a few years. See how he comes on, how he progresses after a while. The years pass by. How's he getting along? Oh my, he's even growing in grace. Oh my, he's shelling the woods. I had to look that up because I thought, brother Brandham, I thought, well, I first thought that they'd put the put that in there wrong and it's not. It's what he says. As far as I can tell, it's shelling the woods. And I thought, well, maybe that's an expression I don't understand. So, I went and looked it up. What's a military term? It means, as far as best of my ability to look it up, it said that it means that uh he hit every target. Because when you shell the woods, what they would do, the military would shell the woods and all the all the splinters would come off and hit everybody. So that somebody else got a better explanation of that, but Gabe, you get with me later. She shell in the woods. I thought that just hitting every target. &gt;&gt; Oh, I want to do that. Don't you? &gt;&gt; He takes them sheep, can handle them just like &gt;&gt; you do. &gt;&gt; Oh, God, give us pastors after the heart of God. preachers in ministry after the heart of God. I don't want and I I really care about that, church. I don't I'm not just saying that. I'm not I'm I'm I'm being a little vulnerable with you and a little bit open, but I really care about that. I realize I'm human. I realize I can come across wrong to people. I realize I can do things and say things that that might turn people off and and and turn them against even what I'm trying to say. I don't want to do that. I want to be somebody who feeds the sheep just like he feeds the sheep. who cares for the sheep just like he cares for the sheep. &gt;&gt; God, help me to do that with all my humanity and all my uh inability, but let me care like you care. Lord, I think if we all had that attitude, things would begin to change and we begin to look at one another differently. You see, we're trying to do our best to feed the sheep the way God would have the the sheep fed. We're trying to do our best to protect them and keep them in the shelter. handle them just like he handled the sheep. &gt;&gt; He'll never give them seaweeds. He'll never give them iron weeds. In fact, he'd said he feeds them Acts 238. Oh, he said, "Does he really say that?" Yes, sir. He sure does. Well, that's just the way I wrote it. Well, that's just the way he says it. Some of them said, "Tear you in the city of Jerusalem to your end with power." And he said when he read that he hollered, "Hallelujah. That's what you need." You know what he does? He just gets them right down there till they get it. That's all right. Stays right with them. And if they start fussing, he says, "Whoop whoop whoop. Wait a minute. That's the way goats act, not sheep." &gt;&gt; In fact, brother Brandon said they get a little peeved. But he knows how to handle sheep. Amen. Said, "You know what?" And I I'm not taking that even as a pastor, but I believe our prophet in this age, God gifted him to handle the sheep, right? So grateful for that. He said, "You know what? I've seen Archbishop so and so tell him that he couldn't come to this town and hold a meeting." Brother Brand was getting personal now. He said, "But you know, I kind of let him." I said, "Go anyhow. Withdraw these tapes. Don't you let them go out. We went anyhow." He talked about that how they would oppose the meetings. He said, "But you know what?" He went right on down there anyway. Went right on down there and began to throw out alpha alpha. You know what? them sheep started eating and they're getting as fat as they can be. Well, glory to God. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. While they're having healings and meetings and a lot of them young fellows began, he said, "Well, they seen." I like this. A lot of them young fellows. &gt;&gt; Brother Bisll was a young fellow during this time. &gt;&gt; Brother Perry Green was a young fellow. Some of the brothers were young fellows. &gt;&gt; I'm so glad men like Eddie Bis, I know we've talked about him a lot lately, he just passed away. I'm glad men like Eddie Bisll chose to feed Alpha. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So, somebody would have the strength to feed another generation. I'm glad I got to eat alpha alpha so I can feed people alpha alpha. &gt;&gt; They got a big bunch of hay like that alpha alpha. You know what they done with it? It was so good till they run over to the neighbors and said, "Taste this. Taste this. Taste this." That's what happened. They took the message to the world. &gt;&gt; See, the atmosphere there tasted just like this right here. Other words, the atmosphere in the meeting was like heaven. Here it is. Right there. Right there it is. See, repent. &gt;&gt; Be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. It's for whosoever will, let him come to see what the Bible said. See, and they're just having a great time down there. Oh, that's my son. That's my boy. Well, you think he's well matured? Sure do, said the Holy Spirit. I've given him tests. Boy, I tried him this way, tried him that way. I've thrown him sick. I put him under. I stomped him. I let the devil do everything to him he could do. He'd come right back up again. &gt;&gt; He'd come just the same. Come up again. I made him sick. I done this. I threw him in the hospital. I took him out there. I done this. I done that. I turned his wife against him. I turned his neighbors against him. I turned everything. Oh, God. Brother Bram's talking about a little bit of his own life there, too. He said, "That didn't make a bit of difference." Said, "Though he slay me, yet I'll trust him. &gt;&gt; I killed his family. &gt;&gt; I took this. I did this. I done all this. &gt;&gt; I did this, that, and the other." Still, he stood right up. Though he slay me, yet I'll serve him. He's mine. He said, "Oh, well, I believe we ought to call him out somewhere to a little special place &gt;&gt; and have an adoption." You begin to see what adoption is. He said, "Now, when the father in the Old Testament," I'll just get this and we'll we'll close. He said, 'Wh the father of the Old Testament understood their son was come of age and been seasoned out unto adoption unto he said they're born a child but they're they're a son right then but then they'll never be no more than just a child just an ordinary son until they mature and show what they are then he calls him out then he said now when the church gets to that place he says Manassus you belong over here Ephraim you over here you see why church order matters Right? All of those things, brother Brandon ties that in this same sermon to adoption. &gt;&gt; Church order matters. All these things that we have, the you say communion, the way we have communion, it matters. It matters to have a man standing in the pulpit preaching the word. I Why, brother Ben? I don't know. Because God said so. &gt;&gt; And we got to be mature enough to receive it. &gt;&gt; Just say, Lord, whatever you want, that's what I want. &gt;&gt; Then he takes him out to a certain place. The father does. He sets him on a high place and he has a ceremony and they all come around. He said, "I want everyone to know this is my child. I adopt my son a special dress on him and I I want you to know that his name is just as good on any check as my name is. He's my child. I adopt him into my family. Although he's been my son since he was born, since he received the Holy Ghost, he's been my son. But now I'm going to place him positionally in authority. What he fires is fired. What he hires is hired." And he references Mark 11:23. If you say to this mountain, be removed and cast into the sea. Amen. Brother Brandham takes that to Mount Transfiguration, Matthew 17. You can read that. Maybe we'll read that if we pick it up on Sunday. Brother Brandham says, I'm going to skip down one. He talked about Peter and glorification. He said, now there's where God is trying to get the Pentecostal church in the book of Ephesians. See, they'd come to a certain place when it was time to grow up, and they weren't grown up, but there would be a bride who would come to a full maturity. He said, "You were first born into the kingdom by the Holy Ghost." How many knows that? The next, you're predestinated unto what? Adoption. What is that? You're predestinated unto the placing. Can I say this? Your spiritual gene is all God. &gt;&gt; So, I don't want you to be worried about this. You say, "Well, what if I never mature?" You're a chip off the old block, &gt;&gt; right? If you're born again, you're a spiritual gene of God. &gt;&gt; And this is the age of adoption. &gt;&gt; So there's there's no how can I put this? The only part of you that isn't a gene of God is the flesh. &gt;&gt; Do you know that the the gene seed itself, the spiritual part is completely God, &gt;&gt; right? It come directly from his mind. So there's no mixture there. It can't be nothing but God. &gt;&gt; Right? So, if you got a a husband and wife got married, he'd have his genes and her jeans and you'd say, "Well, what if they turn out like their mother? &gt;&gt; What if they turn out like their father?" But you can't do that because your mother is the word. Your father is the word. &gt;&gt; He spoke you in, hallelujah, into existence. That's why brother Brand makes the point so strong. Jesus was formed in the womb of Mary. It wasn't any part of Mary, &gt;&gt; but he made both the blood cell and the egg. &gt;&gt; Adoption, what is it? It's you becoming what you are on the inside. So, the only part of you that's not there yet is this. &gt;&gt; And he's going to bring it to a place where this on the inside controls this on the outside. &gt;&gt; And one day, we're at an appointed time. We're going to come to a place where the fullness of adoption comes in. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Which is the change of our bodies. Because our natural gene is not God. &gt;&gt; Our natural gene is our parents and goes back to Eden to the fall. But our spiritual gene is God. So corruption cannot inherit incorruption. We must be changed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye. For we know musicians go ahead and come. We know. Paul says that the whole creation groanth and travaleth in pain together until now. Not only they, but ourselves also, which have the first fruits of the spirit. We have the earnest of the spirit. We have the down payment on a future home, but we're not there yet. That's why we have misunderstandings and things happen. But church, don't get your mind on that. &gt;&gt; Keep your mind on this adoption, &gt;&gt; on this change of the body, on this rapture age, on the shout that we heard, on the message of the hour. Amen. See, because he said, "We which have the first fruits of the spirit, even we ourselves grown within ourselves, waiting for the adoption to or which is the redemption of our body." Brother Brandham calls that the fullness of adoption. We could say it like this. As I've said before, we are saved. How many believe you're saved? That's all right. You believe you've been born again. I'm so glad of that. But you're also being saved. Did you know that? You're not only saved, but you're being saved. And you will be saved. So redemption is not just a past event, it's a present event. His blood is still effective. If I make a mistake, if I do something that's wrong, I have an advocate with the father. Aren't you glad for that today? We are saved. We are being saved, but we will be saved in a moment, in a twinkling of an eye. We shall not all sleep, Paul says, but we shall all be changed. Oh, aren't you glad for that promise? Romans 8:21 says, "Because the creature or the creation itself also shall be delivered." Hallelujah. I've been delivered. My soul is free. I've been brought out of the depths of sin. I know what he did for me. How many can testify to that tonight? I know where I am. I know where I've come from, but I know that there's still a deliverance that's got to take place in my body. That's why sometimes it's hard. The word is hard on me, but I listen to it anyway. Sometimes it's skins to hide, but I believe it anyway. Sometimes it seems like I'm being picked on, but I still love him anyway because the creation itself shall be delivered. Hallelujah. From the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty. Hallelujah. The way my soul was delivered, my body will be delivered into the glorious liberty of the children of God. What do we do? Say, "Brother Ben, what do we do?" Believe the message. Have confidence in it. Get the token. That's the Holy Ghost in our in the word age. The token, the ticket, right? Be born with the true baptism of the Holy Ghost. What does that do? That's your ticket to heaven. That's your seal. Are you with me now? Put it on display. Walk with the word. God will take care of the rest. Do you believe him tonight? Do you love him? Amen. Let's just bow our heads and talk to him for a moment. I I hope it's made some sort of sense tonight. I thought about it and studied for a long time and got away and tried to clear my head over the last few days thinking about these things. I know so much has been said about adoption pro and con and some like it don't even matter, but I believe it fits right in with all the rest of the message of the hour. It's just part of what we believe. What do we want to do? If you never received the baptism of the Holy Ghost, this is the time to be desperate for the token. That's your ticket out of here. If you have been born again, if you have received the token, it's time to let the Holy Ghost teach you, guide you into all truth as he promised he would do. Amen. Let's just talk to him. Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, I'm so thankful for the promise of your word. So thankful for your love, Lord, that goes beyond our flesh, goes beyond the outer man, the the creature itself. Oh God, I thank you for that. Lord, I know I've been delivered, but someday my body will be delivered from pain and from sickness. The bodies of these elders that are sitting here tonight will be delivered into the glorious liberty of the children of God. Maybe some would like to feel like they felt when they were 21, but won't even be like that. It'll be so much more than that. In a place where there are no contradictions, Lord, where there's no wondering, no worry. Oh God, where we'll where we'll know as we are known. Oh, where we'll we we'll be learning about you, Lord, through all eternity. Lord, we thank you for a promise that we'll come to that place. Lord, there's something in our hearts that longs for it. We see the corruption of this world. The world's falling apart, but Lord, it's time for the sons of God to come under the full authority of the word of God to come under the message of the hour and become fullborn, full-blown sons and daughters of God. I pray you'd help us tonight, Lord. I pray that you just move in in a mighty way. You'd bring a reality to us, Lord, in our lives, God. If there's any spirit of fear, I pray that it would be cast out tonight, Lord, as I'm lingering tonight and I just feel in my heart, Lord, maybe it's me tonight, but Lord, I I want to be right. I I don't want to go to church with the wrong attitude. I want to live for you and I I want to receive of the word of God. Help me, Lord. Help each one, oh God. We want to eat that alpha alpha, Lord. We want to feed that alpha alpha to your children. That's what we want to do. I pray you'd grant it tonight. We thank you for all that you've done for us. We thank you for healing and for the salvation of our children, Lord, for everything that we have need of in Jesus name. Amen. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Where would I be? You only know. &gt;&gt; If you need prayer, the altar's open tonight. &gt;&gt; See through eyes of love. It was a hopeless case. &gt;&gt; I was an empty place if not for grace. Hallelujah. Oh, amazing grace. Hallelujah. How sweet the sound. If anyone else wants to come and pray, you're welcome to come. &gt;&gt; Lost, but now I'm found. I was a hopeless case, an empty place if not for grace. Oh precious Lord, please take my hand. Oh, lead me on and let me stand. I was a hopeless case, an empty place. If not for grace, where would I be? You only know. You only see through eyes of love. I was a hopeless case and indeed place if not for grace. Oh precious Lord, please take my hand. Won't you lead me on and let me stand? I was a hopeless case, an empty place. If not for grace, [Music] well, I'm no longer slave to fear. I am a child of God. [Music] Well, I'm no longer a slave to fear. I am a child of God. [Music] You unravel me with a mey. You surround me with a song of deliverance from my eneies till all my fears are gone. Well, I'm no longer a slave to free. I am a child of God. Oh, I'm no longer a slave to fear. And I am a child of God. From my mother's womb, you have chosen me. Love has called my name and I've been born again into your family. Your blood flows through my veins and I'm no longer a slave. to fear. I am a child of God. Oh, I'm no longer a slave to fear. I am the child of God. [Music] You split the sea so I could walk right through it. My fears were drowned in perfect love. [Music] You rescued me so I could stand and sing. I am a child of God. Well, I'm no longer a slave to fear. Tonight, I'm not a slave. I'm a child of God. I am a child of God. Sing it now. Lift your hands to him. Oh, I'm no longer slain. Hallelujah. To fear. Oh, I am a child of God. &gt;&gt; Of God. Well, I Hallelujah. No longer. &gt;&gt; Oh, slave to fear. Do you believe it tonight? &gt;&gt; Oh, yes. I &gt;&gt; Oh, I am a child of God. Oh, I'm no longer a slave to fear. Oh, I am a child of God. &gt;&gt; God. I love it when our young people respond to the word. Something I prayed about for years here at the church. See your response to the word. And not that you folks don't. You love the word. I know that you do. But the altar is not just a place for sinners. The altar is a place for Christians. Do you realize the mindfield that we're leading our children through in the age that we live in? There's death on every hand, destruction, trouble. I don't mean to scare you, but it's just like it's just like Moses' mother putting that baby in a vessel and pushing it out into the ocean, out into the Nile River. He's floating down. But I believe there's protection. We ought to pray for those children every day. I know that you do. But I'm just encouraging you tonight. Pray for them every day. I pray there would be revival breakout among our children because we need it. Us adults need it. We need to get serious about the message. We need to come to a place where we say, "Lord, I want to be a fullg grown son of daughter of God. I want to love it with all of my heart." See, so many fall by the wayside cuz they never got serious about it. It was just something they did that they was okay for a while. It felt good, but and they went on. But I'm invested by the steward of the message of the hour. This is all my life. This is all I have. Let's let's let's give it our all. Why don't we do that? Give it our all. Lord, I I I'm going to do everything I can to help the young people, and I'm going to help everything I can to help the elders, and I'm gonna help everything I can do everything I can to see revival come. We believe we're children of God, we believe we're predestined, but because we are predestined, we are predestinated to the adoption of sons to being mature Christians. Oh, I believe that Satan's laid every trap in the world for our children. We ought to stand there and say, "Devil, you can't have them. Some of you elders say, "Well, I don't have any children or grandchildren in this church." You ought to pray for them anyhow. &gt;&gt; You might go by way of the grave, and I don't know, I may. But these young people, somebody's going to see a rapture. &gt;&gt; We ought to pray all that much more as time passes on. Brother Paul, help our young people. God, keep them tender. I want to see them get hard. I want to see them keep seeking the Lord with all of their heart. And one day there's going to be a group that'll seek him with all their heart. And one by one across the world, they'll wake up one morning and start seeing their their loved ones that have already died. The dead in Christ will rise first, and we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them to meet our Lord in the air. What a glorious time. It ought to be the theme of the hour. We shouldn't lose focus on that. Let's keep our priorities straight. And sorry for holding you long on a Wednesday night, but I his presence is here. Do you love him tonight? Hallelujah. I am a child of God. I'm no longer Oh, I'm no longer a slave to fear. Oh, thank you, Lord Jesus. Oh, I am a child of God. I like this verse. From my mother's womb. From my mother's womb. You have chosen me. Just raise your hands to him and sing that before we go. Love has called my name. Hallelujah. Oh, I've been born again. into your family. Hallelujah. Oh, your blood flows through. Oh, thank you, Jesus. Do you believe it tonight? I'm no longer I'm no longer a slave to fear. Hallelujah. Oh, thank you, Jesus. I am a child of God. Oh, I'm no longer a slave to fear. Thank you, Lord. Oh, I am a child of God. You split the sea. Sing it now. Oh, you split the sea so I could walk right through it. Glory. All my fears were drowned in perfect love. Oh, you rescued me so I could stand and sing. Oh, I am a child of God. Sing that part again. You split the sea. Oh yes, you split the sea. so I could walk right through it. Aren't you glad he made a way for you? My fears were drowned in per love. Hallelujah. God bless you tonight. Oh, you rescued me so I could stand and sing. I am a child of God. Oh, I'm no longer slave to fear. Oh yes, I am a child of God. Oh, I'm no longer a slave to fear. [Applause] Oh yes, I am a child of God. Can you give the Lord a hand clap of praise tonight? [Applause] It won't be long. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, and then we'll be leaving him. And it won't be long. It won't be long. We'll be going. Sing that part again. It won't be long. Oh, it won't be long. It won't be long. And then we'll believe in him. Oh, it won't be long. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; Oh, we'll be going home. Oh, so count the years as much. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Jesus. Oh, and count the months as weeks. [Music] Oh, and count the weeks as days, any day now. Oh, yes, we'll be going home. So count the years. Oh, so count the years as months [Music] and just count the months as weeks. Oh, and count the weeks as days. &gt;&gt; Any day now. Oh, we'll be going. Oh, sing it like this. It won't be long. Let me hear you sing it. Oh, it won't be long. No, it won't. Oh, and then we'll be leaving here. [Music] It won't be long. It won't be long. We'll be going home. So count the years. Oh, so count the years as months. [Music] Oh, and count the months as weeks. Oh, and count the weeks as days. any day now. Oh, we'll be going home. Are you looking forward to that day? Give the Lord another hand clap of praise. Amen. Did you enjoy the word of the Lord tonight? Amen. I sure appreciated that. Amen. God bless you. We'll see you on Sunday morning. Let's sing this. I'm free. Praise the Lord. I'm free. Amen. God bless you. You're dismissed. Well, I'm free. Oh, praise the Lord. I'm free. No longer bound. There's no more chains holding me. My soul is resting. It's such a blessing. Oh, praise the Lord. Hallelujah. I'm free.
