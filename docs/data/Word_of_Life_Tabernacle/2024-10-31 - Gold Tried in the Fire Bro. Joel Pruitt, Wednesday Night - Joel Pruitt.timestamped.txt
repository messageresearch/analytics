[41:15] with my father in his throne you may be
[41:17] seated may the Lord add the blessings to
[41:20] the word tonight and also just one verse
[41:22] of scripture over in First Peter uh
[41:24] chapter 1 1 Peter chapter 1 and verse 7
[41:28] it says like this that the trial of your
[41:30] faith being much more precious than of
[41:32] gold that perisheth though it be tried
[41:35] with fire might be found unto praise and
[41:37] honor and Glory at the appearing of
[41:40] Jesus Christ so if I could just speak
[41:44] for a few moments on gold tried in the
[41:46] fire I would like to take here I know
[41:48] there's many uh different uh Bible
[41:50] characters we could take great heroes in
[41:52] the Bible you could take and there's
[41:54] many that would go through so many
[41:56] trials and we could just take them and
[41:57] just name them off but I think I think
[42:00] we need to make it personal tonight
[42:02] because every one of us here have to go
[42:04] through a trial can you sayen every one
[42:05] of us have got to come to a realization
[42:08] that nothing's going to be easy when you
[42:09] come to God there's no such thing as as
[42:12] an easy believism there's no such thing
[42:14] as you when you get to Christ
[42:15] everything's just hunky dory
[42:17] everything's great but really it's quite
[42:19] the opposite because when you come to
[42:21] Christ you've made a decision that is
[42:23] against Satan and his ways and all hell
[42:26] will break loose against you can you say
[42:27] Amen so I think what we need to know
[42:30] tonight is maybe that we're not looking
[42:32] for a smooth sailing uh flowery bed of
[42:34] ease but what we need to look at is if
[42:36] you're in the trial thank God for the
[42:38] trial if you're in the valley thank God
[42:39] for the valley because in the valley
[42:41] that's where we can grow in the valley
[42:43] that's where we can mature and become
[42:45] mature Christians so I think tonight
[42:47] maybe instead of trying to get
[42:49] everything to be easier in our lives and
[42:51] saying Lord I I want this to be easier I
[42:53] want this to be better maybe God is
[42:55] trying us and trying to get all the
[42:58] dross off of us so that we can actually
[43:00] become gold and so really what it is I
[43:03] would say it's character building
[43:04] because uh brother brandham would say
[43:06] like this I believe I've had the quote
[43:08] here brother brandham says now uh you
[43:10] could take nothing with you because you
[43:12] actually came to this world naked you
[43:13] came with nothing there was nothing that
[43:15] you were born with although some may
[43:17] have been born with an inheritance but
[43:18] you physically you personally you had
[43:20] nothing but what you're going to leave
[43:23] with he said would be nothing except
[43:25] there's one thing now brother brand said
[43:27] we will take our character and so if
[43:29] we're going to take that with us it's
[43:30] going to have to be a good character can
[43:32] you say amen I don't believe it's going
[43:34] to have a characterless church I don't
[43:35] believe he's going to have a people who
[43:37] who who just can't get along or a people
[43:39] that's going to be fussing and fighting
[43:41] no he wants to build our character and
[43:43] he wants us to be in the valley just
[43:45] long enough to where we can actually
[43:46] become the gold of God that he's wanting
[43:49] in this day can you say Amen so so what
[43:51] we have he said we better be real
[43:52] careful now to see that we take
[43:55] something that will make us right before
[43:57] God so so we'll have to go through
[43:59] things there may be a trial that you're
[44:00] facing that you don't you don't know why
[44:02] you're going through that trial but the
[44:04] very reason you could be going through
[44:06] that trial is so that you can face him
[44:08] and so that we can uh be ready for his
[44:10] appearing and his coming so I think
[44:13] let's just go a little farther into this
[44:14] brother brandom said what will we take
[44:16] with us he said we will take our
[44:17] character brother that is what we will
[44:19] take with us now what kind of character
[44:21] will you take with you will it be like
[44:22] his whose character was molded by
[44:24] suffering in the fiery furnace of
[44:26] affliction or will be will it be the
[44:28] softness of this characterless leosan
[44:31] people it is up to each one of us for in
[44:34] that day every man will bear his own
[44:36] burden now if you go back to the
[44:38] scriptures we just read in uh verse 17
[44:41] of of Revelation chapter 3 in verse 17
[44:44] you're going to see the condition that
[44:45] the that that the church world would be
[44:47] in they would they would have need of
[44:48] nothing they would be rich they would
[44:50] just be they would believe that they
[44:52] were the ones why because everything was
[44:54] going good for them they would have the
[44:55] finest churches maybe the big
[44:57] congregations but really that would not
[44:59] be the ones that he was coming for but
[45:01] they were blind because why they thought
[45:03] well this has got to be right because
[45:05] it's successful that's not always a sign
[45:07] it's right it it's not always a sign
[45:09] it's right because it's a it's the best
[45:11] preacher or it's the best church that's
[45:13] those are good things but that's not
[45:15] always a sign that that's of God's
[45:17] approval remember the sunshiny days and
[45:19] and the the good times are not always a
[45:21] sign that God's with you but really in
[45:23] the trial when you know the devil's
[45:25] after you that's a good sign
[45:27] that he's after you because he knows he
[45:29] don't have you so let's just go ahead
[45:31] and praise God in the bad times and I
[45:33] believe that there's a reason to worship
[45:35] when times are hard I think there's a
[45:36] reason for the church to to be happy
[45:38] when the when the days look gloomy why
[45:40] because we know that we know that we
[45:43] have not sold out to this leot of and
[45:44] age and we're not giving up and we're
[45:47] not giving in and we're not going to bow
[45:49] down but you can throw us in the fiery
[45:50] furnace and we're going to come out on
[45:52] the other side even if it I tell you
[45:54] what I think what we need to do is quit
[45:56] looking at the furnace and quit looking
[45:58] at the trial but look what's coming on
[45:59] the other side the promise is I will
[46:02] come up with them on the other side even
[46:04] if I have to face death on this side if
[46:06] they cut your head off or if if they if
[46:08] they throw you into the fiery furnace or
[46:10] if they put you in the denm with lions
[46:11] or whatever they might do to you
[46:13] remember we don't have to worry about
[46:15] that because we know who we have
[46:17] believed in and he is more than able to
[46:20] keep that which he has committed so what
[46:22] we'll say is this that God is not
[46:24] looking for a people who are wanting it
[46:26] easy he's never had a people who wanted
[46:28] it easy but he's always had a people
[46:30] that would be willing to fight when they
[46:32] had to fight can you say Amen so brother
[46:34] random said now every son every every
[46:36] child must be first child trained he
[46:39] said everyone not one exception every
[46:41] son he said he said have you went
[46:43] through trials have you went through
[46:44] tribulation have you suffered
[46:45] persecution then you are real children
[46:48] of God can what can you say Amen say
[46:51] thank God I've went through something I
[46:52] know I'm a Child of God because if it's
[46:55] easy remember that's a bad sign in this
[46:58] age if you're getting along with the
[46:59] world so well that everybody loves you
[47:02] everybody likes you that's probably not
[47:04] a good thing can you say Amen I'm not
[47:07] saying you don't don't get along with
[47:08] your co-workers and you don't get along
[47:09] with people you go to church with but
[47:11] what I'm trying to say is if you fit in
[47:13] with the world it's a sign you might
[47:14] need to start fitting in with God a
[47:16] little better and if you fit in with the
[47:17] world a little bit too close I think you
[47:19] might need to check your walk again with
[47:21] God and so we don't want to I'm not
[47:23] trying to say that everybody in the
[47:24] world's bad and everybody's going to
[47:26] hell no we there's going to be many of
[47:27] them saved and many go through the
[47:29] tribulation but I'm not talking to
[47:30] people going through the tribulation
[47:31] tonight I'm talking to a bride who is
[47:34] going to get herself dressed in these
[47:35] garments that he's talking about and it
[47:37] is a bride that is that is actually
[47:39] going to put on the isav so that they
[47:41] can see the word of God she's not going
[47:42] to run off from a hard sermon she's not
[47:44] going to backslide because the preacher
[47:46] preached a little hard one day she's not
[47:48] going to run away because she feels the
[47:50] heat of the devil coming at no she's not
[47:51] going to lay down when the going gets
[47:53] tough but she's going to stand and when
[47:55] you've done all you can to stand then
[47:57] stand therefore and brother Brandon
[47:58] would say it like this he said you've
[48:00] got to stand for something or you fall
[48:02] for anything you've got to stand for
[48:04] you've got to stand for your god-given
[48:06] rights because what you're doing is
[48:08] you're is you're constantly having to
[48:10] stand against sin and you're constantly
[48:12] having to stand against the the world
[48:14] and and and and listen the devil's after
[48:16] our young people Brother David the
[48:17] devil's after you and and the devil is
[48:19] after every one of us in this building
[48:21] and so if you if you know the devil's
[48:23] after you then you know it's not going
[48:25] to be easy you know there's going to be
[48:27] hard times coming but you know you're
[48:29] going to overcome why because to him
[48:31] that overcometh will I grant to sit in
[48:34] my Throne so I would say tonight if you
[48:36] know you're going to overcome at the end
[48:38] if you know you've read the back of the
[48:39] book and you know you're going to come
[48:41] out of winter I say quit worrying about
[48:42] what tomorrow holds Because You Know Who
[48:45] Holds Tomorrow oh come on somebody and
[48:47] say Amen tonight because God is not
[48:49] going to leave you comfor forless God is
[48:51] not going to leave you in this
[48:52] generation that is going away God is not
[48:55] looking at you like a of the like a
[48:57] bunch of perverts and and all these uh
[48:59] these people that are out here calling
[49:00] themselves Christians and and listen
[49:02] come on somebody I think you know that
[49:04] you're not part of that group and I know
[49:06] you may look a little odd and you may
[49:07] look a little crazy but you've been set
[49:09] aside for service you've been cleaned up
[49:11] you look different than the world you
[49:13] act different than the world you've been
[49:15] set aside why because you put eyes saav
[49:17] on and you can see the word and God has
[49:20] put you through some things or allowed
[49:22] you to go through some things so he can
[49:23] actually see his reflection in you and
[49:26] he can look look at you and say you're
[49:27] my bride you are Mrs Jesus Christ why
[49:30] because he can see himself in the very
[49:33] way that you live he can see himself in
[49:35] the way that you act he can see himself
[49:37] in the character that you possess can
[49:39] you say amen amen so we're not looking
[49:42] for we're not looking to fit in can you
[49:44] say Amen we're not looking to be we're
[49:46] not looking to uh fit in with a certain
[49:48] party of politics although I think
[49:50] everybody knows there's probably one
[49:51] that may be worse than the other and and
[49:53] I would say that maybe we're not trying
[49:55] to fit in with this group over here here
[49:56] because listen every bit of this is
[49:58] going to burn everything we've got's
[50:00] Going Up in Smoke we we ain't going to
[50:02] save nobody if they're not looking for
[50:04] this salvation message we we can't save
[50:06] people who don't want it we can't make
[50:08] people bride who are not predestinated
[50:10] to be bride but what we can do is preach
[50:12] the truth and and the seed will come to
[50:14] life if there is a seed there can you
[50:16] say Amen we but we don't make anybody
[50:18] anything so you can come to church every
[50:20] service and if the word doesn't Quicken
[50:22] something in your heart then then maybe
[50:24] there's nothing there but let me go
[50:25] ahead and tell you something the fact
[50:26] that you're here tells me there is
[50:27] something there so let the word go to
[50:30] work on your heart let the word go to
[50:31] work on that seed that's inside of you
[50:33] let the word Quicken you so that you
[50:35] don't have to go down with the world but
[50:37] you can go up with him can you say Amen
[50:40] so brother Brandon goes on like this and
[50:42] I've read this quote before and maybe I
[50:44] like it a little too much but he said I
[50:46] think we ministers making a little too
[50:47] much flowers for the convert he said oh
[50:50] come to Christ and everything is lovely
[50:52] but you see it isn't like that he said
[50:54] in the way that everything is flowery
[50:56] but of ease because no Christian can all
[50:58] he said all that live Godly in Christ
[51:00] Jesus shall suffer persecutions and he
[51:03] said so if you're not suffering
[51:04] persecution for Christ's sake then
[51:05] there's something wrong can you say man
[51:07] if the devil ain't after you he's got
[51:09] you he said that's all because as long
[51:11] as he's after you that's a sign he
[51:12] hasn't got you yet but if he isn't after
[51:14] you it's a sign he has got you he said
[51:17] so just remember as long as he's
[51:18] blasting at you you're just a few jumps
[51:21] ahead of him and he said just keep on
[51:23] going oh I think that's what we need to
[51:24] do tonight just keep on going sister
[51:25] Janie because when the devil's on your
[51:27] heels He Ain't Got You Yet when you can
[51:29] feel the breath of the devil remember he
[51:31] still ain't got you yet and I don't
[51:33] believe you have to worry about nothing
[51:35] because he has went before you in battle
[51:37] he has already fought the War for you
[51:39] and you don't have to do nothing but
[51:41] just get in Christ and you are safe can
[51:43] you say amen he said but all that live
[51:46] Godly in Christ will be they will suffer
[51:49] persecutions he said
[51:50] rejoice and be exceedingly glad for so
[51:54] persecuted they the prophets which was
[51:56] before you
[51:57] he said don't go with a hang down face
[51:58] and say well I oughtn't have done it I
[52:00] guess I I just can't stand I just can't
[52:02] stand for somebody to talk about me and
[52:04] say I'm old fashioned I'm this that or
[52:05] the other he said oh you should be
[52:07] exceedingly glad somebody say I'm
[52:08] exceedingly glad if you're exceedingly
[52:11] glad and happy because of it you can
[52:13] bear the reproach of his name and by
[52:15] keeping his commandment it caused you to
[52:17] do that so brother Brandon preaches that
[52:19] in forsaking all 1962 and sometimes
[52:22] that's just what we got to do if it's a
[52:24] friend that's pulling you back out into
[52:25] the world sometimes we just need a to
[52:26] cut that friend off and say I love you
[52:28] but I can't go that way I'm praying for
[52:30] you but I can't go that way sometimes if
[52:32] you get out here in these worldly
[52:33] churches and well brother brand told us
[52:35] to get away from them denominational
[52:36] walls didn't he there's a reason for
[52:38] that because you get in there and you
[52:40] get comfortable in a system and you you
[52:42] you set there and they might have the
[52:43] finest music and they might have the
[52:45] finest preachers and they've been
[52:46] through uh a seminary and and all these
[52:49] things but the end there of is the way
[52:51] of death remember there's more than one
[52:53] way that you can go as a Christian but
[52:55] there's only one way that leads to
[52:57] righteousness there's only one way that
[52:59] leads to truth and so tonight I'm not
[53:01] saying let's go the easy way and I know
[53:03] it's hard to preach when when you're
[53:04] preaching and you want to make everybody
[53:06] happy and you say well we got to preach
[53:08] it hard sometimes listen that's not
[53:09] because you're you're unloved that's
[53:11] because God does love you and he wants
[53:13] you to he wants you to be right there
[53:15] with him on that day he doesn't want to
[53:17] leave one behind so sometimes when your
[53:19] edges are getting a little rough
[53:21] sometimes God's going to send a man to
[53:22] you that he can preach to you write down
[53:24] your problem and go ahead and call all
[53:26] Sin Sin and black black and white white
[53:29] why because God cares for you just like
[53:32] that if he didn't love you he would
[53:33] never correct you but because he loves
[53:35] you Brother David he corrects us because
[53:38] he loves us he sends somebody to preach
[53:40] the word to us he didn't choose the Sun
[53:42] or the moon to preach the gospel but he
[53:44] chose imperfect men who could stand here
[53:47] and maybe they can't be perfect in your
[53:48] eyes or maybe they're maybe there's
[53:50] going to be a little problem you and you
[53:52] say well I've got a complex against that
[53:53] man because you know he's done this or
[53:55] he's done that and
[53:57] I'll say this if the man's preaching the
[53:58] word of God get behind the man because
[54:01] there's not many left that's preaching
[54:02] the word in this day but I'll say it
[54:04] like this I think we need to get more
[54:06] men in the Pulpit that'll preach this
[54:07] gospel I think there needs to be more
[54:09] men standing behind this Pulpit I don't
[54:11] care about their style points for how
[54:12] good they can preach or how bad they
[54:14] preach but I'll tell you this preach the
[54:16] word of God and let it change hearts and
[54:18] the people preach the word and let the
[54:20] young people come back to God preach the
[54:21] word and let the old people come back to
[54:23] God preach the word and let a Revival
[54:25] start in Hardy Arkansas again we don't
[54:29] have to worry about what anybody says
[54:30] about us because it's God's approval
[54:32] that matters to us and God did not put
[54:34] us here just to be another church he
[54:36] didn't put us here just to be another
[54:38] group of people that would gather on a
[54:39] Wednesday night but he put us here to be
[54:42] a people that would overcome so that we
[54:44] could sit with him can you say Amen
[54:47] brother Bram tells this story about The
[54:48] Lily he said you ever notice a lily
[54:50] where it comes from he said ride out of
[54:52] the bottom of the slimy pit of the pond
[54:54] and it toils day and night to get it
[54:56] itself to the light but once it gets to
[54:58] the light and it blooms out and the most
[55:00] beautiful flower there is anywhere
[55:02] that's what a lily is he said it comes
[55:04] from the dirt it comes from nothing it
[55:06] comes through the mud Brother David you
[55:07] may not be able to look back and say I'm
[55:09] proud of my family but you can say you
[55:10] know what I'm proud for what God did for
[55:12] me no matter where I came from it don't
[55:15] matter that I come from the mud Look at
[55:17] me now God has set me aside and cleaned
[55:20] me up and set me in this great Army I'm
[55:22] one of his it don't matter what nobody
[55:24] says about you it don't matter what the
[55:26] the devil tries to haunt you with it
[55:28] well come on somebody it don't matter
[55:29] where you came from I don't care how
[55:31] good your family is or how bad your
[55:33] family is everyone of you have got to
[55:35] come through some dirt and come through
[55:37] something so that you can become the
[55:39] Lily that God sees well and many times
[55:42] you look in the in the valley and you
[55:43] see the Lily growing in the valley and
[55:45] you say what are you doing down here
[55:46] well if Mr Lily could talk he would
[55:48] probably tell you well I'd like to be up
[55:49] on the mountain but lies don't grow up
[55:51] there well come on somebody lies don't
[55:53] grow on top of the mountain but they
[55:55] grow in the valley where things get
[55:57] tough and you know you might have a
[55:58] mountain ahead of you but right there in
[56:00] that Valley where you are that's where
[56:02] you can bloom that's where God's going
[56:04] to make gold out of you can you say
[56:06] Amen so God's not going to put you in a
[56:08] place that would not cause you to become
[56:11] gold God's not going to put you in a
[56:14] place that would that would leave the
[56:15] dross on you if we can put it that way
[56:17] because until gold is beat it just looks
[56:19] dirty it looks it looks bad it looks it
[56:21] has no form it has no shape And you
[56:24] can't see your reflection in that gold
[56:25] God may look there may be somebody
[56:27] walking down the street that is gold of
[56:29] God and God may be looking at that
[56:32] person knowing that they're gold but he
[56:34] cannot see his reflection or his
[56:36] character in that person why because
[56:38] they haven't been put through anything
[56:40] yet they haven't withstood a test yet
[56:42] but see you here tonight that have been
[56:44] through test after test and trial after
[56:47] trial what it is it's the Goldsmith
[56:49] standing there and he's beating all the
[56:51] drw off of you he's beating out the
[56:53] temper he's beating out the indifference
[56:55] he's beating out the anger and the
[56:56] hatred and he's beating out all the the
[56:59] the indifference of the of the world and
[57:00] he's trying to beat the world out of you
[57:02] well come on somebody I I I think we
[57:04] just need to look at it like this if
[57:05] God's pushing me through this trial or
[57:07] helping me through this trial thank God
[57:09] for the trial because I know that I want
[57:12] to reflect him and most of all it
[57:14] doesn't matter how I feel but how does
[57:16] he feel about me does God want me to go
[57:19] through this trial then I'll go through
[57:21] it exceedingly
[57:23] glad it's harder in the trial to be
[57:26] exceedingly glad but if you know what's
[57:28] on the other side it's pretty easy well
[57:30] can you say Amen it's pretty easy if you
[57:32] realize that on the other side of this
[57:34] trial is Victory everybody loves Victory
[57:38] can you say Amen everybody loves a good
[57:39] victory dance everybody loves a good
[57:41] service but sometimes you got to be
[57:43] child trained a few times to get to the
[57:45] good service sometimes you got to get
[57:47] rid of the bad attitudes to get to the
[57:49] good service sometimes you got to get
[57:51] rid of the well can you say Amen
[57:53] sometimes you've got to get put through
[57:55] some things so that you can actually
[57:56] break through and have a good old time
[57:59] in the Holy Ghost in church again why
[58:01] because you've you you you've lost your
[58:03] first love you've turned back and you've
[58:05] looked at the world again but I say if
[58:07] you're looking at the message of the
[58:08] hour and if you're looking at the things
[58:10] of God and if your heart is stayed on
[58:12] him then God wants to do more for you
[58:16] than you could even think possible God
[58:18] wants to clean you up sister Stephanie
[58:20] God wanted to turn you around he knew
[58:22] that when you were out there and you
[58:23] were still gold but God didn't see his
[58:25] reflection he knew that if he'd put you
[58:27] through some things that you'd be
[58:28] sitting right here in the house of God
[58:30] tonight why because God knew what you
[58:32] needed to be where you are tonight
[58:34] Brother David God knew what you had to
[58:36] go through as a little boy to be where
[58:38] you are tonight God knew what I had to
[58:40] go through to be standing here tonight I
[58:43] didn't like it all the time but God knew
[58:45] best for me and if he loves you he has
[58:48] chastised you but don't think God's mad
[58:50] at you he loves you he wants to change
[58:53] you from what you are to what you're
[58:55] going to be you may be in the valley
[58:57] here tonight but remember you're going
[58:58] to bloom into a lily you may be in the
[59:00] you may be in the trial of your life
[59:02] brother the Danny but God has got
[59:04] Victory waiting for you God has got
[59:06] something waiting for well come on
[59:07] somebody I know it's Wednesday night but
[59:09] I want to tell you tonight you don't
[59:11] have to hang your head down at work
[59:12] tomorrow you don't have to go around to
[59:14] school tomorrow and say well I'm just
[59:16] oldfashioned or I'm just different no
[59:18] you can hold your head up high I'm the
[59:20] gold of God God may be testing me with
[59:22] that friend God may be testing me with
[59:24] that coworker but God has got something
[59:27] on the other side of the test for you
[59:29] can you say
[59:31] Amen brother Bon said I'm a prospector
[59:34] what does a prospector do he hunts for
[59:37] gold well he was traveling this world
[59:40] seven times over what was he doing he
[59:42] was looking for gold he wasn't looking
[59:44] for just he wasn't looking for for
[59:46] fool's gold the people that wanted to
[59:48] jump around and say well I I want to
[59:49] follow you for the gift or I want to no
[59:51] he wanted somebody that would grab a
[59:53] hold of that third pole word and be
[59:55] changed by it we're not looking for a
[59:57] group of people to say I want to follow
[59:58] you for the good times no I'm with this
[1:00:01] message in the good times in the bad
[1:00:03] times I don't care who walks away from
[1:00:05] this message I don't care who falls away
[1:00:06] from this message I am in it for the
[1:00:09] long haul why because it's not me that's
[1:00:12] holding on he's holding me can you say
[1:00:14] Amen when he was hunting for gold I'm
[1:00:17] glad he found me aren't you glad Brother
[1:00:19] David he found you I tell you what I
[1:00:21] think we ought to be thankful that we're
[1:00:23] just able to be here you say are we able
[1:00:25] why are we here because God saw fit that
[1:00:28] you could be here
[1:00:29] tonight God saw you in your condition
[1:00:32] God saw you how low down well I'll just
[1:00:35] say it for me God saw me how low down I
[1:00:38] I was he saw when I had a temper I
[1:00:40] couldn't fight he saw how bad I was that
[1:00:43] I just couldn't live it anymore but he
[1:00:45] knew that that trial would make me
[1:00:47] stronger today than I was then he knew
[1:00:49] that I had to overcome something so that
[1:00:52] I could stand now he knew that false
[1:00:54] Doctrine had to creep up around me so
[1:00:56] that I could stand for something and
[1:00:58] break out of that wall so that I
[1:01:00] wouldn't be well come on somebody I
[1:01:02] could stand for something true now
[1:01:04] because I was looking around and I
[1:01:05] realized you know what this ain't right
[1:01:07] because I'm willing to stay with what a
[1:01:09] prophet said I don't care who says
[1:01:10] something different I don't well come on
[1:01:12] somebody I don't care what prophet says
[1:01:14] something different I don't care what
[1:01:16] church says something different but if
[1:01:17] the message of the hour it's either my
[1:01:19] Absolut or it's not my absolute so why
[1:01:21] don't we just hold on to the absolute
[1:01:23] you can't have two absolutes in a ball
[1:01:25] game did you know know that you can't
[1:01:27] have two absolutes because you might
[1:01:28] have if you've got a if you got a plate
[1:01:30] umpire I don't know nothing about
[1:01:32] baseball but here we go you got a plate
[1:01:34] umpire if you got two guys standing
[1:01:36] there you might get one that calls it a
[1:01:38] strike and one calls it a ball but let
[1:01:40] me tell you something if you got one man
[1:01:41] standing there he's right regardless
[1:01:44] right whether you want him to be or not
[1:01:47] he's right regardless so what I'm saying
[1:01:48] is this we've got one absolute tonight
[1:01:51] can you say Amen we've got one thing
[1:01:53] that we can hold to and that is the word
[1:01:55] that is the message of the hour that is
[1:01:57] what we're holding to it's not men's
[1:01:59] opinion it's not my opinion it's it's
[1:02:01] not me that's going to help you overcome
[1:02:03] other than what God would use me for it
[1:02:06] it's not me that can help you it's not
[1:02:08] me that can save you it's not me that
[1:02:10] can preach the fire baptism of the Holy
[1:02:11] Ghost down no but God can use a vessel
[1:02:14] to preach to you and then out of that
[1:02:16] vessel he can cause things to change in
[1:02:19] your life I say I'm thankful for the
[1:02:21] ministry we have today I'm thankful that
[1:02:23] God would send us men who are not afraid
[1:02:25] to stand here here and call things as
[1:02:27] though they were and preach the word
[1:02:28] without compromise I'm thankful for men
[1:02:30] of God that'll do that I tell you what
[1:02:32] it ain't popular but it don't matter if
[1:02:34] it's popular it's a god-given right for
[1:02:37] a man of God to stand in the pulpit and
[1:02:39] preach the word of God to the people and
[1:02:41] the people can be fed by it lives can be
[1:02:44] changed by it testimonies can come from
[1:02:46] it that's what we need is men with a
[1:02:48] backbone back in the Pulpit Brother
[1:02:49] David men that'll stand here and say
[1:02:52] Well it may not it may hurt some
[1:02:53] feelings tonight but God knows the end
[1:02:55] of that God knew what you needed listen
[1:02:57] I believe God knows every time you come
[1:02:59] to church he's going to have exactly
[1:03:00] what you need in that
[1:03:01] service right whether you think so we
[1:03:04] not well can you say
[1:03:06] Amen you're not born looking like gold
[1:03:09] all the
[1:03:10] time gold a prospector might be able to
[1:03:13] tell your gold because he's been around
[1:03:15] it a while but you're not looking very
[1:03:17] pretty you ever watch a western movie
[1:03:19] where they're mining I they're black and
[1:03:22] white usually so I can't tell what's
[1:03:23] dirt and what's gold when they look at
[1:03:24] well we got a strike well what what
[1:03:26] strike looks like a cave to me and if I
[1:03:29] come across gold in the wild I wouldn't
[1:03:31] know what it was because I've never had
[1:03:33] any in
[1:03:34] person so so so what it is is but God
[1:03:37] saw you in the
[1:03:39] dirt with God I wish somebody I wish
[1:03:43] somebody just go ahead and just let
[1:03:44] loose tonight a little bit I won't hold
[1:03:46] you long when my watch tells me to quit
[1:03:48] I'll
[1:03:49] quit
[1:03:52] is but what we need to do you know we
[1:03:54] come to church can I talk to you for a
[1:03:55] minute it is that okay all right here we
[1:03:58] go I think sometimes we come to church
[1:04:01] and we've had a bad day and we bring our
[1:04:03] bad day to the house of God and we think
[1:04:05] everybody else needs to have a bad day
[1:04:06] because we had a bad day I've done this
[1:04:09] so I'm
[1:04:11] guilty I've done it I'm I'm I'm standing
[1:04:13] here confessing confession is good for
[1:04:15] the soul but Brother David we've had a
[1:04:17] bad day we had you know an argument or
[1:04:20] something maybe with a coworker or or
[1:04:23] maybe we just messed up on the job and
[1:04:24] now we're feeling down maybe we didn't
[1:04:25] do anything bad but we just feel bad we
[1:04:27] just had a bad day brother Joe one of
[1:04:29] them corpses talk back to
[1:04:31] you just a bad
[1:04:34] day but then you come to the house of
[1:04:37] God and you try to hold on to that
[1:04:39] burden you know if you'd ever just
[1:04:41] learned to cast that thing off of you
[1:04:42] and put it on him yes sir he's willing
[1:04:44] to take every one of your
[1:04:46] burdens sir and then you can actually
[1:04:48] have fun in the house of God again you
[1:04:50] can actually have a good time in church
[1:04:52] again but what we're doing is we're
[1:04:54] trying to carry the load when he's
[1:04:55] already carried the load for us we're
[1:04:57] trying to carry all these burdens when
[1:04:59] we don't need to carry no burdens
[1:05:01] because he went to Calvary with every
[1:05:02] one of our burdens on his back why would
[1:05:04] we carry burdens Brother David why would
[1:05:06] we come to church with a with a mad face
[1:05:08] why would we come to church with a frown
[1:05:10] on our face when God has brought us here
[1:05:12] to sit together in Heavenly places God
[1:05:14] has brought us here he thought enough of
[1:05:16] us to set us here tonight God thought so
[1:05:20] much of us brother Danny that he would
[1:05:21] not leave us down here in a barroom he
[1:05:23] would not leave us out here with the
[1:05:24] world wondering what purpose do I have
[1:05:26] in life but he gave me purpose when he
[1:05:28] gave me the message of the hour he gave
[1:05:30] me purpose when he gave me friends and
[1:05:32] and and Believers in the church that I
[1:05:33] could fellowship with why because we
[1:05:35] have something in common we may not be
[1:05:37] exactly alike we may not be we may not
[1:05:39] see everything alike but what we can do
[1:05:41] is we can Fellowship around an absolute
[1:05:44] that is what we can hold to we can say
[1:05:46] it doesn't matter what my differences is
[1:05:48] because I am not one of them that's
[1:05:49] going to sit here and pick apart what
[1:05:51] you do and you're not going to pick
[1:05:53] apart what I do we're going to love one
[1:05:54] another why because because we are we
[1:05:56] are we are put eyes have on and we don't
[1:05:58] see you Danny Ward as just a man anymore
[1:06:01] but I see you as a brother in Christ and
[1:06:03] I see was an elder in the gospel I don't
[1:06:05] see brother Jeff as just another man
[1:06:07] that's out here in the world but I see
[1:06:08] him as the gold of God why because the
[1:06:11] IAB is on and I've seen men and women
[1:06:14] who are dressing themselves in the
[1:06:16] Garment of Praise and they're dressing
[1:06:18] themselves in the Garment of
[1:06:20] righteousness why it's not something we
[1:06:21] could do but we have taken on the
[1:06:23] message of the hour we have the blood
[1:06:26] cover our sins we let the blood cover
[1:06:28] the mistakes between us and we start
[1:06:30] looking at people
[1:06:32] different and that's just the truth of
[1:06:34] it if you're looking at everybody's
[1:06:36] mistakes I think it's time that you
[1:06:39] start looking at your
[1:06:40] own because you'll find that you've made
[1:06:42] just as many as anybody else can you say
[1:06:46] Amen let me get off of that and get
[1:06:48] right back to where my notes
[1:06:50] are he said at the beginning you are
[1:06:54] born defeated
[1:06:56] a't that just that's just shouting
[1:06:58] worthy right there brother Danny we're
[1:06:59] just born defeated brother Harvey we're
[1:07:02] we're born no
[1:07:04] good and that don't give us much hope he
[1:07:07] said and that birth can never bring you
[1:07:09] to life because you're born defeated and
[1:07:12] you're in a defeated World amongst
[1:07:14] defeated people amongst defeated Creeds
[1:07:17] defeated denominations you've got to
[1:07:19] come to Victory some way can you say
[1:07:22] Amen am it's just like a Lily and he
[1:07:24] talks about this Lily multiple quotes
[1:07:26] and I left this one in here because I
[1:07:29] really like this quote he said just like
[1:07:30] a lily he said one of the prettiest
[1:07:32] flowers there is I'm very fond of those
[1:07:34] great caes and pawn lies I think there's
[1:07:37] nothing hardly as pretty as a great big
[1:07:38] Pawn Lily call it water lily how it's
[1:07:41] Radiance he said now where does it come
[1:07:44] from it's a little seed down in the
[1:07:46] bottom of a Muddy Pond and that little
[1:07:48] seed yet all the radiance that'll ever
[1:07:51] shine in it is in it right then so in
[1:07:53] your lowest state all that you would
[1:07:56] ever become was already there oh can
[1:07:58] somebody say Amen so when you were born
[1:08:01] when you when you were born defeated
[1:08:04] there was something on the inside that
[1:08:06] knew no defeat yes sir and so when you
[1:08:08] were born in the mud there was something
[1:08:10] on the inside that already knew that it
[1:08:12] needed to see the light and there was
[1:08:14] already something on the inside that
[1:08:16] would become beautiful in the eyes of
[1:08:18] God but it was just a process and a test
[1:08:21] that I had to go through are you still
[1:08:22] with me I I've got 10 minutes left is
[1:08:24] that okay all right and that little seed
[1:08:27] he said yet all the radiance that'll
[1:08:29] ever shine in it is right thin when it's
[1:08:30] in that mud but it has to strive daily
[1:08:33] knowing that there is something it's
[1:08:36] black it's dirty it's Mucky it's slimy
[1:08:38] it's in that slime it's living in yet it
[1:08:40] presses its way through the mud and and
[1:08:43] the muck and the waters and the stagnant
[1:08:45] places until it sticks its head above in
[1:08:48] the light and expresses what's been hid
[1:08:51] in it all the time so when you are in
[1:08:53] that condition sister Stephanie in you
[1:08:55] all the time was the potentials of what
[1:08:58] we're seeing now in you all oh come on
[1:09:00] somebody sister Sandra through every
[1:09:02] trial you've been through that was just
[1:09:04] the gold becoming brighter in the eyes
[1:09:05] of God that was just the that was just
[1:09:08] the dross getting beat off of you it was
[1:09:10] times you didn't think you could take it
[1:09:11] no more but God knew you could stand the
[1:09:13] test and so he brought you through on
[1:09:15] the other side as pure gold I say
[1:09:18] tonight quit looking at the trial quit
[1:09:20] looking at the test quit looking at the
[1:09:21] seed and saying well they're nothing
[1:09:23] they can never become nothing God knows
[1:09:25] that the trial they're going through is
[1:09:27] going to bring them forth as pure gold
[1:09:29] can you say Amen sir he said so there's
[1:09:32] something about it he said in the waters
[1:09:33] and the stagnant places and and it
[1:09:35] sticks its head above in the light and
[1:09:37] expresses what it's been hidden all the
[1:09:38] time listen that ought to give somebody
[1:09:40] reason to shout even if you're looking
[1:09:42] at your neighbor tonight and you're
[1:09:43] saying well they don't look like they're
[1:09:45] gold but in the eyes of God they're
[1:09:47] Priceless in the eyes of God they're
[1:09:49] worth more they're more precious than
[1:09:51] fine rubies they're more precious than
[1:09:53] gold why even the test you went through
[1:09:55] was more precious than gold but God
[1:09:57] brought you out on the other side I say
[1:09:59] he's God and he's worthy of all of our
[1:10:02] praise tonight can you say
[1:10:05] Amen brother bam said I think that's an
[1:10:07] overcomer once in sin once did things
[1:10:09] wrong anybody ever been
[1:10:11] there anybody besides me ever been there
[1:10:14] anybody ever been in sin anybody ever
[1:10:16] did anything wrong well okay a few of us
[1:10:19] have done some good some bad things the
[1:10:21] good ones I'm going to talk to you after
[1:10:22] church because I want to know how you
[1:10:23] did it if if you've never done anything
[1:10:26] wrong that's wonderful but I'm going to
[1:10:27] tell you tonight if you're a son and
[1:10:29] daughter of God you've been through some
[1:10:31] things you've done some things wrong
[1:10:33] you've done some things you're not proud
[1:10:35] of you've done some things that that
[1:10:37] maybe maybe look like well God cannot
[1:10:39] even be saved but God knew you could be
[1:10:42] brought through that situation because
[1:10:44] he wanted you to come forth as pure gold
[1:10:48] can you say amen he said what is it he
[1:10:50] said don't worry about it now oh can
[1:10:51] somebody say Amen to that he said I he
[1:10:53] said I did what things that was wrong he
[1:10:56] said don't worry about it now once did
[1:10:58] things that was wrong then now why look
[1:10:59] back in the pond again see why look back
[1:11:02] to that dirt again why go back to where
[1:11:04] you came from when you're now Sons and
[1:11:07] Daughters of God seated together in
[1:11:10] Heavenly places worshiping God in the
[1:11:12] freedom that you have why go back to the
[1:11:14] life of condemnation why go back to the
[1:11:17] life that's going to hold you from your
[1:11:18] praise why don't we just worship God
[1:11:20] because we know where we came from but
[1:11:22] we ain't going back for nobody we ain't
[1:11:24] giving up for nobody we're not going to
[1:11:26] turn around and look back and say well
[1:11:29] maybe that was fun maybe I should go
[1:11:31] back no we are going all the way and the
[1:11:34] gold is just going to get cleaner and
[1:11:35] better all the way and all the time
[1:11:38] because every time we go through a test
[1:11:40] God is trying Us in the fire amen but we
[1:11:44] will come forth as pure gold can you say
[1:11:46] amen Amen brother R says it like
[1:11:49] this my goodness he said my God is able
[1:11:52] to heal me from this or my God's able to
[1:11:54] make me this or the other he says in
[1:11:55] quote God's able to take me from this
[1:11:57] wheelchair my God's able to do this I've
[1:11:59] accepted him as my healer I've confess
[1:12:01] I've confessed my sins and confessed
[1:12:02] that I believe that he is my healer let
[1:12:04] come let go what may if not well today I
[1:12:07] will be tomorrow that's Abraham's
[1:12:09] children right there if I'm not tomorrow
[1:12:11] I will be next year the lord gave and
[1:12:12] the Lord takes away blessed be the name
[1:12:14] of the Lord he said oh there it was and
[1:12:16] when they walked into the fiery furnace
[1:12:18] now I think we know this story well
[1:12:19] enough to know of the outcome of this
[1:12:21] but he said when they walked into the
[1:12:22] fiery furnace under trial under a test
[1:12:25] they held true to the end can you say
[1:12:27] Amen but God was there just in the spare
[1:12:30] of a moment and he delivered them and
[1:12:33] they knowed that they were prayed up
[1:12:35] their sins were confessed they know that
[1:12:38] they had met every requirement and yet
[1:12:40] he seemed to be silent and I like this
[1:12:42] part and I think I've used this one
[1:12:43] before as well but he said he's only
[1:12:45] silent to test you God is never that far
[1:12:48] away brother Brandon would say he's as
[1:12:50] close as your right arm to you God is
[1:12:52] never that far away he's just a
[1:12:54] Whisperer away he's just a breath away
[1:12:57] he's just an Arms Reach away why because
[1:12:59] he knows when you've had enough that he
[1:13:02] can step into the fight he knows when
[1:13:04] you can't take the heat no longer he'll
[1:13:05] be the fourth man in the fire remember
[1:13:07] when you're going through a test and
[1:13:09] trial you're not in it alone but God
[1:13:11] will bring you through
[1:13:13] it you think you're in it alone and all
[1:13:16] the time there's a silent partner
[1:13:18] standing there that's got the keys to
[1:13:20] death Hell In The Grave he's a oh come
[1:13:22] on somebody he may be silent Brother
[1:13:24] David it but when he when he speaks all
[1:13:27] Heaven and Earth would shake when he
[1:13:29] speaks hell had to let loose of its
[1:13:31] doors and when when he speaks the Devil
[1:13:34] Himself had to shut up and be quiet can
[1:13:36] you say Amen so he may be silent but
[1:13:39] that's only to test you brother BR would
[1:13:41] say that he said to see really what you
[1:13:43] are what's on the inside of you if you
[1:13:46] really mean from your heart he said
[1:13:48] Daniel was tested for the worship of one
[1:13:50] true God he was tested for that and in
[1:13:52] the time of test he stood the test and
[1:13:55] what did God do after it looked like the
[1:13:57] chips were down for him as we would say
[1:13:59] and that they didn't know what to do
[1:14:01] they was going to feed him to the lion
[1:14:02] but Daniel stayed true to the test and
[1:14:05] there is one true God and he possessed
[1:14:06] the Gate of his enemy God had closed the
[1:14:09] mouth of the lion see we possessing the
[1:14:11] gates after trial brother B would preach
[1:14:13] a sermon called that we possess the
[1:14:15] gates of the enemy after trial we can
[1:14:18] take those Gates Samson could take those
[1:14:20] gates after a trial he could he could he
[1:14:22] could push those pillars down after the
[1:14:24] trial of a time you may have to go
[1:14:26] through something that looks like it's
[1:14:28] going to kill you but God is only
[1:14:30] letting you go through that to bring you
[1:14:32] out on the other side more Victorious
[1:14:34] than you went in greater than you went
[1:14:36] in because greater is he that is in you
[1:14:38] can you say Amen than he that is in the
[1:14:41] world I just want to read a couple more
[1:14:43] here and I'll try to
[1:14:44] close very quickly he said now Moses
[1:14:47] didn't throw up his hands and say well I
[1:14:49] guess it's all wrong he stayed there and
[1:14:51] waited on God he stayed true no matter
[1:14:53] how many impersonators there was he
[1:14:55] stayed true and when he stayed true to
[1:14:57] his commission to bring those people out
[1:14:58] of that place when the water gate got in
[1:15:00] his way God let him possess it and he
[1:15:03] opened the gate by the pillar of fire
[1:15:04] that was leading him he took the people
[1:15:06] on to the promised land now it looks
[1:15:08] like Moses might have been a nobody but
[1:15:10] let me just go ahead and tell you
[1:15:11] something the nobodies is whose God's
[1:15:13] going to use can you say Amen it may
[1:15:15] look like a little church over here on
[1:15:16] the side with 30 40 people 50 people on
[1:15:18] the Wednesday night but let me just go
[1:15:20] ahead and tell you something greater is
[1:15:21] he that's in one of you than he that's
[1:15:23] in the world so I said we've got a
[1:15:25] legion of armies of gods right here
[1:15:27] we've got a legion of angels around us
[1:15:29] there are angels lining the rose tonight
[1:15:31] that won't let one thing happen to you
[1:15:33] until it's time for something to happen
[1:15:35] to you we don't fear death what can you
[1:15:37] say man we don't fear the test We Don't
[1:15:39] Fear the trial we don't fear Temptation
[1:15:41] because all those things are going to
[1:15:43] come to a Believer but we are more than
[1:15:45] able to overcome them we have something
[1:15:48] greater on the inside of us than what
[1:15:49] the world's got to try to take us out
[1:15:52] can you say Amen brother R would say
[1:15:54] like this he said
[1:15:56] Joshua he said two of them went to the
[1:15:58] promised land remember there was 12 that
[1:15:59] went in yeah 12 that went over and he
[1:16:02] said 10 of them come back scared to
[1:16:03] death 10 of them said we can't do it 10
[1:16:06] of them said we're not able there was
[1:16:08] only two of them that said we're more
[1:16:09] than able Joshua would steal the people
[1:16:11] and say listen don't worry about the
[1:16:13] Giants that's just a test well come on
[1:16:15] somebody God told us he was going to
[1:16:17] give us the land quit looking at the
[1:16:18] giant I I preached to here not long ago
[1:16:20] about David and Goliath name that name
[1:16:22] that giant and take him out and cut his
[1:16:24] head off what are we doing we're getting
[1:16:26] scared of the very thing that God is
[1:16:27] letting us go through for a test but God
[1:16:30] has already fought the Battle he's
[1:16:32] already fought the victory you are going
[1:16:34] to go through it but God has already put
[1:16:37] you on the winning side as brother Ben
[1:16:39] said several times he's already rigged
[1:16:41] it in your favor he's already brought
[1:16:43] you through it in the mind of God he
[1:16:44] already sees you as pure gold that's
[1:16:47] already formed in His image but he's got
[1:16:48] to let you come through things so that
[1:16:50] you can become what he's already seen
[1:16:52] you are seen you as in the in in the
[1:16:55] mind of God you can do no
[1:16:58] wrong
[1:16:59] right think about it if you've already
[1:17:03] if you're already going to be there he's
[1:17:04] already got your house built he's
[1:17:06] already got everything he's got your
[1:17:08] name on it he's even got your name on
[1:17:09] his refrigerator he's got your picture
[1:17:11] there if you're better looking than me
[1:17:13] but he's got a listen he's got a he's
[1:17:14] got a house with your name and addess on
[1:17:16] it and and you think God is going to
[1:17:18] stand here and say I'm going to cast
[1:17:20] this one out now because because I
[1:17:21] brought him through this but he's just
[1:17:23] not doing well no God already knew he
[1:17:25] going to come through that trial God
[1:17:26] already knew you was going to make it
[1:17:28] you are going to make it quit worrying
[1:17:30] about the future know that God's got it
[1:17:32] all in control can you say Amen sir so
[1:17:36] 10 of them said it's too much of a job
[1:17:38] we just couldn't do it well then people
[1:17:41] we look like grasshoppers by the side of
[1:17:43] them but what did Joshua do he stealed
[1:17:46] the people he said wait a minute we are
[1:17:49] more than able to take it no matter how
[1:17:51] little we are or how much in the
[1:17:53] minority what what was he doing he was
[1:17:55] standing true to the promise now I want
[1:17:58] to say tonight you've been given a
[1:18:00] promise of a Rapture you've been given a
[1:18:02] promise of overcoming and he said to
[1:18:04] them that overcome will I grant to sit
[1:18:06] with me in my Throne so I would just go
[1:18:08] ahead and say it like this if you know
[1:18:10] you're going to make it quit worrying
[1:18:12] about it if you know you're going to
[1:18:13] make it quit coming to church with well
[1:18:16] I hope I can say this and get away with
[1:18:17] it but quit coming to church with a bad
[1:18:18] mood why because you know that this is
[1:18:20] just a test rejoice in your trial
[1:18:23] because God wants you to come forth as a
[1:18:25] lily God wants you to be coming forth
[1:18:27] where he can see his reflection in you
[1:18:29] so the test you're going through is the
[1:18:32] time to Rejoice amen amen well that's a
[1:18:35] bad way to look at it oh my goodness it
[1:18:38] says I'm
[1:18:39] done I'm almost
[1:18:41] done but what did Joshua do he stealed
[1:18:45] the people and said wait a minute we're
[1:18:47] more than able how many's more than able
[1:18:49] here tonight quit looking at your own
[1:18:51] self and say he has made me more than
[1:18:53] able we are more than able to take it no
[1:18:55] matter how little we are or how much in
[1:18:58] the minority what was he doing he was
[1:19:00] standing true to the promise I give you
[1:19:03] this land so
[1:19:05] tonight he said I give you your house I
[1:19:07] give you your children I give you your
[1:19:10] inheritance you might go through test
[1:19:12] after test you might look at them kids
[1:19:14] and say my God what are you doing but
[1:19:16] all he's doing is letting them kids go
[1:19:18] through something because they've got to
[1:19:20] come to the same place you are he's
[1:19:21] letting them kid I tell you what I don't
[1:19:23] think it's just our children what about
[1:19:24] our brother Brothers what about our
[1:19:25] sisters what about our if maybe some of
[1:19:27] you kids your parents need to go through
[1:19:28] something well can you say Amen some of
[1:19:31] them like I wish they would but listen I
[1:19:33] think what we need to know tonight is
[1:19:35] the trial is not there to kill us the
[1:19:37] trial is not there to take us out but
[1:19:40] the trial is just there it's just a
[1:19:42] stepping stone of God's grace it's all
[1:19:45] Grace the trial is Grace to You well can
[1:19:48] you say man the trial the test is just
[1:19:50] grace to you because though God would
[1:19:53] slay me yet I'll trust him and if you
[1:19:55] have that kind of Faith then we can look
[1:19:58] at every obstacle and say I don't know
[1:20:00] how I'm getting through it but I do know
[1:20:02] that he's more than able I don't know
[1:20:04] how we're going to take this land but
[1:20:05] he's more than able I don't know in
[1:20:07] myself how to do anything I don't know
[1:20:09] how to stand here and preach the gospel
[1:20:10] but he's more than able to speak through
[1:20:12] a human lips and speak right to your
[1:20:14] need tonight he's more than able he is
[1:20:18] God can you say amen he said I God and I
[1:20:21] change not I say that if he was God
[1:20:23] yesterday if if he brought the Hebrew
[1:20:25] children through a fire then he can
[1:20:27] bring you through the fire if he brought
[1:20:29] Moses across the Red Sea he can bring
[1:20:31] you across the Red Sea and I think just
[1:20:33] like then you can look at it and say you
[1:20:35] know what that was just God all the time
[1:20:37] I say tonight it's just God in the test
[1:20:40] it's God in the trial it's god making
[1:20:42] gold in your life can you say Amen as
[1:20:46] the musicians would come my time's up
[1:20:48] but I want to just say this just a
[1:20:49] couple things here before we
[1:20:51] close brother Bram said do you believe
[1:20:53] that he's talking to this lady in the
[1:20:54] prayer line he said do you believe that
[1:20:56] mother God has given you your healing
[1:20:58] but you'll fight every inch of it can
[1:21:00] you say amen he said everywhere The
[1:21:02] Souls of your feet sets that I give you
[1:21:04] for POS that I give you for possession
[1:21:07] Footprints means possession it's all
[1:21:09] yours every promise belongs to you but
[1:21:13] you'll fight every inch of the way now
[1:21:17] he says so I wonder if we could stand
[1:21:19] together tonight I hope this was okay I
[1:21:22] wasn't trying to hold you long and I
[1:21:24] might have went a little over but I just
[1:21:26] want to say tonight that let's quit
[1:21:29] worrying about the test and just
[1:21:30] remember that he's got it all in control
[1:21:33] he's got every situation in your life
[1:21:36] already figured out and we don't
[1:21:39] actually have to figure it out we just
[1:21:41] have to participate in the plan of God
[1:21:43] can you say Amen many times we can look
[1:21:45] around and you can see my job's not
[1:21:47] working out and my family's not working
[1:21:48] out and maybe your marriage ain't
[1:21:50] working out but God's got it all in
[1:21:51] control and there's no reason to give up
[1:21:53] on God now
[1:21:55] can you say man there's no reason to
[1:21:56] give up now God is more than able he's
[1:22:00] more than enough he's he can supply all
[1:22:02] of your needs he's still Jehovah Gyra
[1:22:04] can you say Amen he's still Jehovah Rafa
[1:22:07] he is still Jehovah of the old and that
[1:22:09] was Jesus of the new he's just God all
[1:22:11] the time and God is not willing that any
[1:22:14] should perish but that all would come to
[1:22:16] repentance listen I say if there's one
[1:22:17] of you tonight that needs something from
[1:22:19] God you say well the the the burden's
[1:22:21] getting a little heavy and I say give it
[1:22:22] to Jesus tonight can you do it I wonder
[1:22:25] if we could bow our heads and just just
[1:22:27] go to him to the tonight you say well I
[1:22:29] just need I just need something I just
[1:22:32] need a touch I just need a little more
[1:22:33] help because this trial is getting to me
[1:22:36] and maybe I maybe I don't I don't know
[1:22:38] if I can handle it much longer listen
[1:22:41] just right there in the nick of time you
[1:22:44] might have to go in the fire but he's
[1:22:45] there waiting for you in the
[1:22:48] fire if you have a need on your heart
[1:22:51] tonight I just wonder if you'd put your
[1:22:53] hand up to him and say Lord I just need
[1:22:55] more of you tonight I just need a little
[1:22:57] bit more of your grace to make it
[1:22:59] through this test I just need a little
[1:23:01] bit more I know I know that you're
[1:23:03] working all things for my good do you
[1:23:05] believe that church all things you don't
[1:23:09] know what I've been through all things
[1:23:11] all things it don't matter how bad the
[1:23:14] life has been that you've been dealt it
[1:23:16] don't matter how bad it looks like it's
[1:23:17] been stacked against you but remember
[1:23:20] all things work together in your
[1:23:22] situation for your good
[1:23:25] because you love God and because he
[1:23:27] loves you he allows trials to come so
[1:23:30] that you could become his
[1:23:33] image we are his body on earth and the
[1:23:37] only way to become that is by being
[1:23:38] tested like he was tested tried like he
[1:23:41] was tested tried like he was
[1:23:43] tried so I wonder as we're just with our
[1:23:45] heads bowed just for a moment if we
[1:23:47] could just talk to him in your own way
[1:23:49] say thank you Lord for the test because
[1:23:51] I know that it's for my good thank you
[1:23:54] for the trial I'm in it may not be easy
[1:23:57] but he's got it all in control I wonder
[1:24:01] with your heads bow if we could just
[1:24:02] sing this for a
[1:24:04] moment oh
[1:24:07] you are
[1:24:10] more
