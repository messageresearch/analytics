our hearts knowing lord that we have the earnest of our inheritance of a perfect body grant it now heal every sick person touch every heart we pray in jesus name amen amen god bless you turn with me to psalms chapter 34. psalms chapter 34 and verse 17. it's good to have each one of you with us this morning brother derek good to see you and sister nicky this morning and from over back home i guess we would say from back at piggett and and see different ones back with us today and it's so good god is good and we should never take for granted uh the time that we get to spend together around the word of the lord so it's good to have each one of you this this morning and i want to speak to you this morning on a thought that just kept coming to me this week during the week and i was doing my my devotions and i i just feel like the lord laid it on my heart for a reason i trust to be a blessing to you i want to title this no broken bones no broken bones psalms chapter 34 and verse 17. it's good to have brother ronnie my father-in-law here with us this morning as well and each one of you it's always a blessing to be in the house of the lord with you it says the righteous cry lord earth and delivereth them out of all their troubles how many troubles did he say would deliver us out of oh amen that's saying something all their troubles he said the lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart saveth such as be of a contrite spirit many are the afflictions of the righteous but the lord delivereth him out of them all how many again oh amen verse 20 he keepeth all his bones not one of them is broken i pray lord would add his blessing to the word you may be seated this morning if you were there with joseph and nicodemus after the body of christ had been taken down from the cross and delivered to them there are some things that you would have seen as you examine the body of christ you would have seen the bruises where he was buffeted and where they slapped him the scripture even said and it always touched me where it said the servants slapped him the king of the heavens and the servants slapped him he was bruised for our iniquity you would have seen the wounds in a scalp where they took a crown of thorns and put it down over his head you would have seen the nail prints in his wrist and in his feet he's seen splinters in the body from carrying the cross until he couldn't carry it anymore you would have seen deep gashes in his skin strips of skin torn off and hanging loose where the bible even says that his bones and his internal organs could be seen from being beaten with 39 stripes but the bible says he was wounded for our transgression and i'm so grateful for that this morning i'm so grateful that he was wounded for our transgression and brother branham tells us they beat him to a point where if they had beaten him one more time he would have died you would have seen that the body was was bruised and wounded but no broken bones which is a miracle in itself because the body would have been abused in such a way that you would have thought there would had to have been something broken even a bone and even the bible in psalms 22 14 david describes what it would be like in the crucifixion he says i'm poured out like water all my bones are out of joint so they were out of joint they were pulled until the tendons and everything was pulled apart but the bones were whole not one broken you'd have thought when they beat him with the with the whip that would have broken a rib that there would have been somehow there would have been a bone broken but it says not one was broken he says my heart is like wax it is melted in the midst of my bowels my strength is dried up like a potsherd my tongue cleaveth to my jaws and that's brought me into the dust of death dogs have compassed me the assembly of the wicked have enclosed me they pierced my hands and my feet he says i may tell all my bones they look and stare upon me so he's in a horrible condition but he still has all his bones and i want to draw your attention to that today he said they parked my garments among them cast thoughts upon my vesture so he's been persecuted he's been mocked he's been spit on he's been laughed at he's he's had the he's had his body uh so disfigured by the abuse that he's taken but he still had all his bones all his bones were out of a joint but they were still there his bones could be counted but they were there no broken bones and you look at that and and find out in the old testament in exodus 12 46 that the lamb that was for the passover would not be broken and this was different from all of the other sacrifices where the bones would be taken out or taken apart but here was a lamb that would be whole a lamb that would be complete and i believe we have that kind of a lamb today a complete lamb because it requires and you have to think with me a little bit this morning but it requires a complete lamb for the resurrection that's why his bones had to be left intact a complete lamb and today we eat lamb just like they did in the passover they were to eat the lamb whole and where to eat the whole word the whole lamb not with any part separated from it but we eat the whole thing right and so the lamb had to be whole because it takes all of the word now listen to me it takes all of the word to produce a resurrection his body wouldn't be there there wouldn't be part of his of his structure of his body left behind you can't tear off a limb and leave it there but the whole body was placed in the tomb and the whole body would raise up from the two and i want to encourage you this morning because you see there's no devil in the hell that could ever keep any part of that body in the tomb it had to come out oh this that ought to make us really thank god this morning to be a part of that body he said well how do you know you're a part of the body we're baptized into the body by one spirit by the holy ghost we're baptized into the body of christ and when we come into the body it means that we cannot be left here brother branham tells us in christ the mystery of god revealed he said the bride body must follow the head must follow the head it can't be left behind part of it left behind we don't have to worry about one bone being left off but the whole body amen that is eaten the whole word goes in the resurrection and the rapture so in exodus 12 46 he says in one house shall it be eaten or in one company thou shall not carry forth out of the flesh or brought out of the house neither shall you break a bone thereof and in john 19 and 32 when the soldiers were just about to do what they always did in every case it would break a bone to make sure that he was dead to make sure that the male factor that the the one who was hung for that capital punishment was dead they broke the bones and so they went to the first one and broke his bone and of the other they went to him broke his bone the good with the bad when they came to jesus i love how god keeps his word this morning god keeps his word if god will keep his word like this down to this detail don't you realize he still keeps his word today that if god can keep the word of a prophet that was spoken hundreds of years before don't you think that god could keep the word of a prophet in this hour that speaks about a bribe and so he says when they come to jesus they saw that he was dead already and they break knowledge legs see no one took his life from him he gave up the ghost but one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side and forthwith came throughout blood and water now brother branham tells us in the entombment he says then another thing i want you to notice he said the truth the infallible part of god's word i love this the infallible part of god's word the bible said he keeps all his bones not one of them is broken in the type the paschal lamb was a type of the lamb must be without blemish no broken bones must be in the lamb and at the hour when he had died they went up to break his legs with a hammer he said look at that very crucial moment and i want you to notice and keep in mind what we read in psalms where he says many are the afflictions of the righteous many are the afflictions of the righteous you might have come here today and you've been through hell all week excuse it but it's just the way it is you might have come here and you've had all kinds of trouble you might have come with all kinds of sickness in your body you might have come with all kinds of worry you might be watching or listening this morning with all kinds of trouble but remember many are the afflictions of the righteous many by the jt are the afflictions but the lord delivered them out of them all amen and so he said at that crucial moment and think about it this might be your crucial moment this morning that you really need to hear from god you really need an answer from god you really need god to step up and and and we know he's already done that in his word but you really need to know that it's real to know that it's for you that's that crucial moment and it's at that crucial moment he said the man with the hammer ready to strike his legs but god's word said there will not be one bone broke in his body amen hallelujah that's why we stay with the word we don't want to get off of it we don't want to leave it we don't want to leave it in our doctrine we don't want to leave it in our practice we don't want to leave it in our lives we stay with the word because the word guarantees us a resurrection this is what's getting me out of here my friendship with you or your friendship with me won't get me out of here the fact that you go to this church won't get you out of here but the word gets us out of here why he keeps his word he's a god who keeps his word when he keeps his word it means he keeps all of his word he doesn't just keep part of it and so there's no bones broken at that crucial moment it seems like he won't keep his word listen to me we're living in a time if you just excuse me for a moment we're living in a very crucial moment of history we're living in a time when it looks like that god can't keep his word anymore we're living in a time when it looks like there's no hope when it looks like that the world has gone into darkness people don't want god anymore but remember it's at that crucial moment that's when god keeps his word he did it for the three hebrew children after they were they were already there and they were bound up and ready to be thrown in he kept his word in the fire in that crucial moment the son of man appeared it is in this crucial moment that god has given us a message just the whole word to be able to get out of here amen amen you know i wouldn't want to try to make a rapture without this message i tell you more than that i wouldn't want to try to navigate laodicea without this message you talk about confusion we have a message that didn't glorify a messenger brought us back to the word to the whole word amen and so he said look at that crucial moment the man with the hammer ready to strike his legs but god's word said very bad you take that and put it in your own situation god's word said there will not be one bone broken god's word says i'm the god that heals all of your diseases god's word says i i'll have a church at the end time be a mighty army god's word said there'll be a bride without spot or blemish i didn't say that i can't make that happen god's word says that are you with me this morning excuse me for being a little bit excited but god's word said that takes the pressure off of me takes the pressure off of you god's word said and what i have to do brother caleb is believe that word hold on to that word amen i see my brother back here that's been sick for a while and able to come to church today god's word says i'm a he's a healer and so that's why we're able to gather together you see others that that you see them down at that crucial moment it seems like they'll be lost but god's word says maybe your kids is the same way it seemed like that your kids getting a point where they get away from god and they don't want nothing to do with god but god's word said if you believed all your household could be saved there will not be one bone broke in his body brother how is it going to happen he says we get in a hurry we get in a hurry you know what hurry produces hurry produces ishmael ishmael is an attempt to force god's promise to take place right every time that there's a false doctrine around the message of the hour somebody that believes that they've got everything figured out it's because they're trying to force the action of god trying to make it happen and it's not were you i can't make it happen i can't change your body if i did i'd change mine right if i could do that i'd have already done it i would have already had a rapture but it's in god's time see you can't do that jesus said which of you by taking thought can add one cubit to his stature you can't do it so what do you have to do you have to rest in the word it's god's word that's eternal amen and so brother brown says if god's word is that perfect them who are in christ is just as sure to raise as there is a resurrection amen he said god is just as obligated to his word to heal you as he is to save you oh my why it's a whole body no no bones broken wounded but not broken torn up but not broken abused and persecuted but not broken amen i hope you're hearing me this morning he said he's just as obligated to his word to heal you as he is to save you he said for it's his word that promised it it's god's word and we have no right to take away from it but just say it's the truth it's the truth well it may not happen unless i force something no it'll happen in god's time you get discouraged because you see people people aren't living the word like they should people aren't doing what they should it'll happen in god's time all we can do is preach it we can't force it because god is obligated not to us but to his word and if we're a part of that word then that makes him obligated to us but it's not to our words but to what he said now he said believe it no matter what happens believe it anyhow he said that's the way the rest of them had to believe it and we're not excluded from that he said god gave palestine to israel but they had to fight for every instagram they got the promise is yours but you have to fight for every inch you claim the devil will see to that certainly he will certainly he will so god gives us a promise we have to fight for it and there's a you know when you look at when we we watched the play of noah this week and as i was sitting there was thinking about this this balance and this almost seemed like a back and forth between election and what god said and what noah had to do because without either one it wouldn't have worked but see god calls the right man he knows he'll do the job right but you take the two together and you think here god said there'll be a flood no one would be saved but he didn't build him a boat he made noah build the boat and so you think well what was that and that's what brother bran was talking about he said you've got to fight for every inch of ground he said he said you've got to fight for every answer you claim the devil will see to that certainly he will he said but notice when they were ready to break the legs of our lord jesus if that hammer would have struck the leg and broke it god would have been found false but there wasn't enough devils in all dark torment amen to let that hammer strike that precious body for david 800 years before then said there will not be one bone broke in his body god's word has to stand truth and we know that bones in the scripture represent a potential for resurrection because it it's joseph when he died in hebrews 11 22 it says by faith joseph when he died made mention of the departing of the children of israel and gave commandment concerning his bones he did that by faith take my bones when you go you say if you go when you go take my bones right and it was jacob and joseph both who refused to be buried in egypt but they carried their bones back to the place where abraham and job were buried and those bones lay there in the ground in palestine they laid there in in that land for all those years job laid there maybe for hundreds of years and here's abraham laid there and sarah and here's jacob and joseph and all the patriarchs laying in that land they wanted they wanted to be buried there brother branham speaking of job he said that when the spirit of god came upon him he began to prophesy he said i know my redeemer liveth at the last days will stand upon this earth though the skin worms destroy this body i love that though the skin worms destroy the body yet in my flesh i shall see god amen he made a place to bury himself he said well by this ground he bought it there and buried himself later on there came a man he said named abraham the church growing up growing coming on up abraham he said well now he had the potentials of god too everlasting life eternal because god called him now notice he said when he died or sarah died he bought a piece of ground in palestine near job's grave and buried sarah abraham died and also was buried with sarah and abraham begot isaac and isaac when he died he slept with abraham in the same parcel of ground he said now when isaac begot jacob and jacob died way down in egypt but being a prophet with this potential this quickening power he said don't you bury me down here joseph come here my prophet son put your hand on the hip that god crippled swear to the god of heaven that you'll not bury me down here he said what was in that man why was in egypt just as good as any place he was a prophet he knew amen where that resurrection was going to be so he says take my bones amen you might be in this world and say all i've got is bones i don't have much all i've got is bones it don't seem like there's any meat on the bone doesn't seem like there's any any ability to do anything i'm just sitting here at bones but if you have bones you've got potentials amen you can remember before you were saved you may not have had anything that resembled a christian you might may not have been anything that resembled a christian but you had bones if i could put it that way in the bones and we'll get into it a little bit later but the bones speak of election and it speaks of our of our placing it speaks of resurrection and that part of you that that is eternal has to raise oh my so the bones were already there even though there was nothing there so if you get in a place as a christian where you feel like that you're you're in the worst place of your life and you can't do anything right you still have bones take those bones and bury them because there's got to be a resurrection amen now look he says he says what was in that man why wasn't in egypt just as good as any other place he said he he was a prophet he knew where the resurrection was going to be wasn't going to be in egypt would be in palestine put your hands on my crippled hip and you swear by the god that i served you you're my prophet son you'll not bury him my bones down here take me up yonder and bury me joseph being a prophet also laid his hands upon his crippled dead he said i swear by the god of abraham isaac and jacob i'll not bury you here he took him up and buried him in that land why he said when joseph died he said don't you bury me down here don't you bear me down here why god has got everywhere but he has a plan joseph was a prophet he said someday he said listen his words the lord god will visit you will take you out of this land when you go you take my bones he said that quickening power was in them bones he said oh if the spirit of him that raised up christ from the dead dwell in you he'll also quicken your mortal bodies they're getting where now they can take the dna out of bones from thousands of years ago out of bones there's something in the bone that identifies amen and speaking spiritually now i'm not saying that if you had a limb transplant or something that you couldn't that part of you wouldn't go up i'm not saying that at all but what i'm saying is spiritually the bones the the basics of what you are is election that's the basics that's what forms you that's what may that's what caused you to be saved it's the election of god that's the bones you still got the bones when it seems like everything else is going wrong so he says he says that quickening power he says was in them bones he said oh if the spirit of him that raised up christ from the dead dwelling you who also quicken your mortal bodies don't put my bones down here bury them up there with those of the promise and brother branham in back in entombment in 1957 he says the reason those prophets did that and wanted to be buried in palestine he said they knew that the resurrection was not going to be in egypt it was going to be in palestine alone he said that's why i say tonight he said i've got all kinds of names i don't care what people call me it doesn't mean a thing to me the only thing that i want to do is know this i've been dead and my life is hidden christ through god and sealed by the holy ghost and when he calls me from among the dead i'll answer on that day he said bury me in christ amen bury me in christ for those that are in christ will god bring with him at that day bury me there let me be planted in the word let my spiritual identity who i am be buried in the word and if i'm buried in the word then it doesn't matter what somebody says about me it doesn't matter what other people think doesn't matter other opinions but i'm buried in the word it doesn't even matter what i do though i wouldn't want to do anything to displease god but i'm buried not in what i do but in the promise so brother brown says the only thing that i want to do is know this that i've been dead he said and my life is hidden christ through god and still by the holy ghost so when he calls me from among the dead i'll answer on that day bear me in christ for those that are in christ will god bring with him at that day you go in in second kings 13 21 you find out that elijah's bone still had that quickening power even after he was dead the flesh was all gone because the bible says that the moabites come up in the land and says as they were burying a man behold they spied a band of men they cast the man because they needed to run faster you know so they took their dead man and just cast him into the tomb of elisha when the man was let down and touched the bones of elisha he revived that's some bones right there that's some bones elijah's dead and all the flesh is gone everything's dried up imagine being the moabite how he must have felt he did you know and he's he's had it rough he may have been chopped to pieces we don't know he get dead in the battle and his friends just toss him in the prophet's grave he just stands up whoa wait a minute woke up in a graveyard but he was alive why because of the bones amen the bones had the potential of resurrection amen someone saw that everything they touched was risen amen i want us to go to ezekiel chapter 37 and i know most of you knew i was going there so ezekiel chapter 37 and verse 1. let's look at some bones and just think about this now in context of what we've said that he said that many are the afflictions of the righteous but the lord delivered them out of them all not one bone will be broken and then you find nicodemus and joseph of arimathea examining the body and they see all these wounds but no broken bones fulfilled the promise in ezekiel 37 1 it says the hand of the lord was upon me carried me out in the spirit of the lord set me down in the midst of the valley full of bombs that's usually where the warfare is is in the in the valley dave and goliath come to fight against one another they come together in the valley they were camped on either hill they come together in the valley so he says it was a valley full of bones they died he said it caused me to pass by them round about he said and behold there were very many in the open valley oh they were very dry we're very dry they didn't make no sound didn't make no movement they just sat there like a bone it's not connected to anything and when it's not connected it just lays there it doesn't move what do your bones do when you sleep unless your nervous system moves them they just stay there huh these were very dry bones without moisture the body can't lift these bones were not just bones but they were very dry bones there was nothing on them but bone nothing but bone but they still had potential because all of the bones were there you just couldn't know where they belong but they were there they were out of joint they were spread out all over the valley but they were there the bones were there and he said unto me son of man can these bones live i love the wisdom of the prophet because the mystery of whether these bones could live or not the mystery of the resurrection of the bones laid it was held in the mind of god right because what does he say can these bones live he doesn't say who knows this way a lot of people take that is can these bones live i don't know that's not what he said he didn't say who knows he said you know i know some of you have prayed for people for a long time i've got family i'm praying for people that i'm praying for can these bones live he knows i can't tell one from the other they all look like dry bones they all go to the same amusements they all drink the same alcohol they all smoke the same cigarettes they all go to the same churches the same world they're all they're all part of the same same system can these bones live the preacher doesn't know the prophet doesn't know but the mysteries in the mind of god can these bones live he said you know too quick to give up on people can these bones live they're all dry they're all dead they all need revival we're too quick to give up say well the church is going through a tough time i'll just leave and go somewhere else no the bones can these bones live god knows very bad all the bones were there can they live now we know that this was a type as well of of the jews and this is the primary type of the scripture is of the jews and their return to the holy land and we find then that the jews and the holocaust were slaughtered until there was nothing left but bones and you find them pictures where there's nothing but shoes piled up they were incinerated they made ashes and bones and it seemed like that for those people god didn't do them any good you know and this has always been a quandary among the jewish people because they understand that they're god's chosen people but they don't really understand what good it does to be god's chosen people because all that they ever brought them is persecution and they've been destroyed over and over again but they're god's people and over and over again they've been destroyed and they said we're special we're god's people and every time they say it they get kicked down again and so these jews in the holocaust were slaughtered but revelations chapter 6 tells us that there was they were under an altar there were souls under the altar crying how long and we know they couldn't be a gentile bride because they cried for vengeance and that wouldn't be the type of christ at all that wouldn't be christ's sight but they cried for vengeance what were they they were these souls under the altar that had been martyred can these bones live you go through the holy ghost you go through that time and even to today and you look at it and say there's not much hope but somewhere there's 144 000 pretty jews can these bones live you see they were scattered all over the valley all over the world and there come a time when during that that that world war period when and during the first world war and after the first world war between the wars and endure after the second world war there was that time when there come a great a great movement a great return and they began to come back what was it those bones were coming together because they have to be in a physical place right but what's happening to us is the bride we don't come together in a physical place but we come together in christ the word under one head the word and when we come together in christ what happens the bones start coming together so he says you know lord that these bones can live because you know the name of each bone and where it belongs and how it connects to the body you see god knows what we should be doing we don't know the mystery is in the mind of god and he reveals that to us as when we need it right but sometimes you'll do for a year you don't understand what should i be doing then one day you realize this is my place this is where i belong why because that mystery was held in the mind of god but it comes down to you in the right season the bone comes together he knows where he where you belong and in verse 4 again he said unto me prophesy upon these bones and say unto them oh ye dry bones hear the word of the lord amen notice he doesn't say hear the hear the great anointing or here the great miracles and that's wonderful he says hear the word and the anointing follows you hear the word the miracles follow hear the word all these other things follow right these things follow them to believe but he said hear the word we underestimate the power of the word to make these bones live amen now these predestined bones are there in the valley he said prophesy to these bones i'm saying to them oh you dry bones hear the word of the lord thus saith the lord god unto these bones behold i will cause breath to enter into you and you shall live and i will lay sinews upon you and bring up flesh upon you and cover with you with skin but breath in you and you shall live and you shall know that i am the lord he said so i prophesied as i was commanded and as i prophesied there was a noise he said i prophesied there was a noise and behold it's shaking and the bones came together the church started taking shape the bones came together amen he said and bone to his bone now we know that this happened there was a an army of god there in that first age but now it was lost in the dark ages but we've seen a restoration these bones scattered in the valley and it come through luther and through wesley through pentecost and brother branham in one place said that shaking the bones come together with a pentecostal revival there was a great shaking the bones came together bone to his bone he said when i beheld low the sinews and the flesh came upon them the skin covered them above but there was no breath in them amen they'd been through the the the lutheran move and the wesley move and the pentecostal move but they still didn't have life he said oh breath now they had the potential of life but they didn't have the fullness of it now he said unto me he said prophesy unto the wind notice he's already prophesied once at the beginning now he's prophesying again prophesy to the wind prophesy son of man say to the wind thus saith the lord god come from the four winds o breath breathe upon these slain that they may live so i prophesied as he commanded me and the breath came into them and they lift what did they do they lift they stood upon their feet an exceeding great army there was a resurrection of all of the bones and it come in stages and the first the skin come on and then the sin you come on the muscle and then the skin and and then they laid there in the valley but he said prophesy again so he says and they lived and stood upon their feet and exceeding great army he said unto me son of man these bones of the whole house of israel behold they say our bones are dry and our hope is lost we are cut off for our parts remember he said many are the afflictions of the righteous our bones are lost we are cut off for our parts i can't tell you this morning that being a christian is going to be easy it won't be easy if you're going to come god's way you're going to have to give up yourself you're going to lay yourself on the altar if you're going to come god's way you're going to have to live for him you're going to have to endure persecution you're going to have trials you're going to get sick sometimes but he said i'm the lord that healeth all thy diseases but you're going to get sick there's going to be things happen to you you're going to go through times of trial like we've had here lately but remember you still have the potential of resurrection listen he says he's he says our bones are dried our hope is lost we are cut off for our parts therefore prophesied saying to them thus saith the lord god behold my o my people i will open your graves amen cause you to come up out of your graves bring you into the land of israel you shall know that i am the lord when i have opened your grave so my people brought you up out of your graves and shall put my spirit in you you shall live and i shall place you in your own land and then you show you know that i the lord has spoken and performed it saith the lord can you imagine what it'll be like for the jews now think about it think about it they come out many of them were in russia or different parts of the world and they died there they died there and they become that one of those souls under the altar and they said how long lord in those hundred forty four thousand they have to come and go through their persecution and all those things and and they have to die also and but those bones will come back [Music] and that's more than just natural bones because some of them were incinerated and everything else but all those bones the bones that were broken and messed up and and out of joint and all over the place will come back and they'll walk on the land of palestine look around say what did it and they'll see him very bad the one that they rejected you tell me god's not merciful you can't tell us you can't tell a believer that because the one that they rejected the one that they turned down two thousand years later they're walking around how'd we get here he said you were mine you were my bones the bones were important because they were my they were my bones they're the bones of the makeup the the wife of christ of jehovah that had been that had forsaken him and went out with so many other lovers we got him back oh church imagine what a time they'll have walking on the ground don't you realize that's where we're at spiritually we're living in that time when our we've been resurrected by the word not there'll come a time it'll come naturally too it'll we'll see him in the flesh i believe that we'll see him in his body brother brown said that's what believers believe and it will seem in a corporal body but for now we've been risen in christ raised sitting in heavenly places walking on the ground that abraham looked for walking on the ground that all of them look for why we know the the whole story we know the whole lamb of god we're able to take advantage of every part oh church don't stop short in this hour don't don't stop short and say well i go to church that's enough i know get into the message of the hour find out what the word says this word is able to make you live amen he said you shall know that i am the lord when i've opened your graves he said and brought you out of your graves and shall put my spirit and you shall live and i shall place you in your own land and shall you know that i the lord has spoken and performed to saith the lord why did he do that because they are his why does he do it for us because we are his psalms 135 and 4 for the lord has chosen jacob unto himself and israel for his peculiar treasure there's also a prophecy concerning the bride brother brown speaks up in the restoration of the bride tree he says four killers took it speaking of that bride tree four killers killed the bride tree four messengers destroyed it for four messengers of death took it away in dogmas four messengers of righteousness restore back again prophesy son of man can these bones live he said i wish we had time he said i got it wrote down here but i have to miss that if you listen to the tape the people kind of holler out for him to take his time so he takes just a little bit he says what's the four stages he says of that coming forth of that church what's the four stages of ezekiel's dry bones coming forth he said but the life only come not when the sinew skin was on them but when the wind blowed upon them he said that's when come back that fourth message of life i will restore saith the lord he says hallelujah glory praised me to god the fourth light is to come he said that will bring forth the same signs amen watch he said justification brought back the pulp sanctification brought back the bark the doctrine of holiness well brought back the leaf pentecostals leaves clap their hands joy rejoicing now we still have the pope the justification we still believe that we so have the sanctification of the bark the doctrine of holiness we don't give that up in this hour but we've moved on so we don't we have it but we don't have just that right we still have the leaves clapping their hands the leaves that are for the healing of the nation's brotherly love we still have that that that atmosphere i'm so glad we still do so he said we still have that or what what brought back the leaf that was the pentecostal but what he said the fourth was the word itself amen as brother brandon put it we have that plus he said the fourth was the word itself the word made flesh fruits of the proof of the resurrection sign that christ has finally after justification been planted sanctification been planted baptism of the holy ghost organizations died out and christ has again centered himself like the cap of the pyramid first sign saint justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost and then the coming of the cap listen the full word produces the full mature bride don't give up on those bones now listen brother brother says notice the vindicated word in this body is this very victory i read that too fast listen the vindicated word where in his body the prophet had to be vindicated but the vindication of the word is in the body and part of that is the prophet in our day there's things that he did we don't have to do and that no one else will do right but that's the vindicated word that's in the body but the vindicated word in his body that's us is his very victory that's very simple because if the body is not vindicated if it doesn't show signs of life it proves that something wrong with the head you could take that to all kinds of places the body doesn't show signs of life it's something wrong with the with the leadership so this message come to bring us the head so the leadership could be right amen because the leader is not your pastor the leader is not some other man but the leader is christ the word and so he says that the vindicated word in his body is his very victory and the reason of his death when the the romans the the emperors would come back they would have a jubilee and they would come back after conquering they would come and have parades and they would get all the things that they gathered all the gold and the silver and the slaves and all the things that they gathered and parade them down the streets of rome and the people would would shower with flowers and all these things why because it was it was a victory they were showing their victory it was the fruit of the victory they depended on that for their very life and their their power and all those things that was their victory what is his victory he comes walking down the road with this bride amen amen we are his victory and the reason of his death see the death not in the spirit when he died he only died in the flesh his spirit went to hell and preached to the souls in prison he said that's right the flesh only died then he raised it up again and quickened it a bit amen he raised it up again and quickened it now he said quicken means made alive his flesh which was his body and that's the word amen it's been laying dead for years but it gradually began to come in the reformation and now well i'm waiting for something to happen if we don't have it now we'll never have it listen to me and just just bear with me we'll close in just a moment but if if this message can't produce a rapture on its own without my intervention without me changing it then it's the wrong message if it can't produce it without me becoming a legalist trying to make it happen or becoming some kind of a tyrant or becoming some kind of a person who who forces it to happen or are changing the doctrine in some way try to spiritualize it it stands on its own it is what it is amen and i believe it's the word of god i don't have to make that happen now she is standing upon her feet listen if she's not standing on her feet now if you're waiting on something else to come where you know and then people wait on brother branham to come back but there's people waiting on other things and if we're not careful we look at those that wait on brother branham to come back and say well that's terrible but we're waiting on the next revival or the next preacher or the next thing no it's now now she's standing on her feet hey man now she's standing on her feet why because she's received the full word he said oh how i wish i had time to go back into ezekiel this is in in christ the mystery of god revealed he said and pull out them dry bones and show you he said can these bones live again he said prophesy how can prophecy come only through the prophet well if i need to know about it my pastor will tell me you better get into the word you have to know that what i'm telling you is the truth how can prophecy come only through the prophet and the bible that's because the bible says that you'll only reveal it through the prophet he said it's the word of the lord hear you dry bones the word of the lord and send you skin to come upon them and they stood up a mighty army he said beginning to march towards high and he said glory to god that's him he said that's him the victory pretty bad let's put it on a real personal level go back to psalm 34 19. many are the afflictions of the righteous but the lord delivereth him out of the mall he keepeth all his bones what do you say that's him huh that's the victory not one bone of his was broken we can say it this way not one bone of hers will be broken the bride not one predestined bone will be lost but think about that personally you could say well my experience isn't very good right now i'm suffering persecution you might do that i suffer loss you will as long as we live here this flesh gives me problems you might get so that you get weary of even living at times some might even die doesn't mean they're not the bride in some way you know we look at failures in our life and i'm just talking to you now but we look at failures in our life and think well that's the end that's all there can be but even death is a failure on some level because we didn't make it in the rapture and he said well it's a failure on some level but yet a lot of us the lord terrorists will go through that but it has nothing to do with the inside it's the flesh that fails god doesn't fail you suffer persecution you go through a time when you feel i heard brother darrell ward preach one time a a message called a bottle in the smoke i don't know if you've ever heard him preach on that a bottle in the smoke david said he said i'm like a bottle in the smoke it's a skin that would be hung up in the in the tent and the smoke would would come up on it and it would dry it out and crack it i'm like a bottle in the smoke you go read the psalms you find out david was god's chosen vessel but he went through it man i'm like a bottle of smoke i can't even hold water i'm cracked i don't feel like much like a christian but there won't be a broken bone in his body that's bad not one predestined bone will be lost what do i need to do brother man what how do i get out of this place hear the word of the lord you dry bones hear the word of the lord stand up we're living in the hour when the last prophecy has been given stand on your feet not one bone will be lost but the same word listen that gives us comfort also removes our excuses there's no excuse for laying in the valley in this hour we all get in the valley but there's no excuse for laying there you've got skin on you you've got you've got muscles you've got life move don't lay there
