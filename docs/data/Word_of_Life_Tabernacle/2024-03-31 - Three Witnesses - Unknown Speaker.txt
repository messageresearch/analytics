something just happened to that sound it started to ring a little bit um it's good to have each and every one of you with us uh this morning and uh brother Stuart I think is out um he he was the last one to get sick of their family so but see You' be praying for him this morning uh brother Daryl Ward is going to be at Christian Tabernacle on at 7 o' on Saturday 7's The time I was told I think that's the correct time but uh brother Daryl Ward will be there we love brother Daryl don't we so if you get a chance to go I'd encourage you to go and be with uh them over there at our sister Church all the churches in the area Proclaim this message and believe the message of the hour our sister churches and we want to support them whenever we can amen amen do you love the Lord this morning let's turn to Matthew 18:16 it's kind of a maybe an odd scripture to be our Easter scripture but I want to speak to you this morning on three Witnesses three Witnesses he says but if he will not hear thee then take with thee one or two more that in the mouth of two or three someone say two or three two or three Witnesses every word may be established I pray the Lord would add his Blessing to the word you may be seated in the mouth of two or three witnesses to be a witness in the Old Testament and during bible times to be a witness of something was a sacred thing it meant that you had seen it and you would be a faithful witness to tell what you saw to not embellish it to not add to it but to actually say what you saw on on that event and so there was a great curse that was given to uh false Witnesses in fact it was seen as one of the things that God hates is a false witness and I I believe that's still true today we should always tell the truth someone said if you uh if you tell the truth you don't have to tell the story uh you don't have to tell the story different way or or try to remember it it'll always be true and the truth will always be true so we know that there were many witnesses of the death burial and resurrection of Christ and and we know that that event what we're honoring today and why we gather together on Sunday mornings we're honoring the resurrection of Christ and in doing that we're honoring the most pivotal event in world history it's the greatest thing that's ever happened it's why we're here this morning it's because of the resurrection of Christ that weekend because of what happened on that Passover weekend that's why that we are here that's why we have a message that's that's why we have something to preach it's why we have something to sing it's the reason for what we do and and and where we go and what the things that we uh we we hold ourselves from everything ties back to that Resurrection It's Our Hope Of Heaven it's our confidence in Christ it's the life that we live everything rests on the fact that he died for our sins was buried and raised again the third day now I know today we live in a day when people want scientific proof they they want proof of everything say well prove to me that he rose again in this message we we have that same problem today people say well prove to me that brother brandham did those things prove to me that that that it happened on Ohio River prove to me and I'll say this there were many witnesses of what happened many witnesses of the things that happened and yet people will not you cannot prove to them scientifically because you've got to believe what the witnesses say in order to be a believer of this message just like you have to believe what these Witnesses said in order to be a believer that Jesus Christ rose from the dead I want to say this morning and I want to declare with all that I have this morning that I believe that the Witnesses were true I believe that he raised from the dead and I believe we can prove it today not by scientific proof but by our lives that he did raise from the dead and so we honor this day now he rose from the dead for our sin he died for our sins was buried and rose again the third day excuse me in 1 Corinthians 15 if you'll turn there with me Paul is telling us about Witnesses of the Resurrection he said for I delivered unto you first of all that which also I also receive how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures in other words the scriptures said he would do it and he died in just that way his death fulfilled the scripture and that he was buried and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures and that he was seen of sephus that's Peter Simon Peter then of the 12 and after that he was seen of above 500 Brethren at once of whom the greater part remained to this present but some are fallen asleep after that he was seen of James and of all the apostles and I love this eighth verse last of all he was seen of me also amen Paul includes himself as a witness of the Resurrection though he wasn't there during the time Jesus was walking the Earth he wasn't a Believer during the 40 days that uh that that Jesus was there uh visiting his disciples and things that he did Paul was not a Believer during that time and yet he counted himself as a witness he said I am a witness of the Resurrection he was seen by me and I want to put myself there this morning and I want to put you each one of us that have received the baptism of the Holy Ghost we met him too we met a risen resurrected savior yes he said he was seen of me as of one born out of due time yeah I am the least of the Apostles that I'm not meat to be called an apostle because I persecuted the Church of God but by the grace of God I am what I am how many can say Amen to that this morning every one of us can say by the grace of God I am what I am and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain but labored more abundantly than they all yet not I but the grace of God which was with me therefore whether it were I or they he said so we preach and so you believed in order to be a Christian now I want to establish this point before we go on but Ry in order to be a Christian you had to believe what somebody told you about Jesus you you there had to there had to be something in you that had the capacity to believe what somebody say so don't let anybody tell you well uh these things that we believe in the message are just stories no it's all just stories if that's the way you look at it right but if you look at it as a reality it can change your life look at what it does to us look at what it does for us yes sir so I I realize then that Paul being a witness of his resurrection and all the ones that he mentioned you could say that there were hundreds perhaps even thousands of witnesses of his resurrection of the death burial and resurrection of Christ but I want to pick out three that just kind of occurred to me you said brother Ben why these three because I'm the one that gets to pick and you can pick your three but we'll let you preach after after lunch if you want to do that but we're for us you know for me this morning I I had three special witnesses that I wanted to present to you that are special to me personally because I think we can also witness in this day in a similar manner to how they witnessed and so the first witness of of the death of Christ was Simon that I want to present this morning is Simon the sirene Simon the sir that he witnessed the death of Christ he didn't intend to but he was caught up in the moment and he just happened to be there and witnessed the death of Christ and I preached to you about Simon before he means a lot to me because the lord gave me a a a message about Simon the sirene and I believe it was for me more than anybody else I preached it all over the world but but he gave that to me uh a few months before I we come over to this church and and begin working with you people and as I begin I think God was trying to tell me something you you need to just pick up the cross you need to you need to do what needs to be done and be willing to do that and God will bless it and I think every one of us we need to have that kind of a commitment Lord Lord whatever needs to be done that's what I'm willing to do let me be like Simon and be willing to carry the cross and be a witness of your death burial and Resurrection Matthew 27:22 we find that Jesus had endured six separate trials he'd been beaten spit on and abused all night long they they abused him yes and pilate in the morning he finally comes around to pilate and pilate can find no reason for him to be crucified but pilate saith unto them what shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ because he there was their custom to release one on the Sabbath day or on the on Passover it was their custom to release one and they said let Let barabus Go free who was a murderer let him go free and he said what will I do with Jesus he they all say unto him let him be crucified yes and the governor said why what evil hath he done but they cried out the more saying let him be crucified and when pilate saw that he could Prevail nothing but that rather a tumult was made he took water and washed his hands before the multitude saying I am innocent of the blood of this just person see ye to it then answered all the people and said his blood be on us and on our children oh they paid for that over the years and yet the love of God extends so far but the bill that although the the Jewish Nation the Israel the Israel the nation of the Israelites has paid so much for what happened to that day when they said let this Blood be on us and on our children and yet there will be 144,000 elected at the end time that'll receive the message of the hour that'll be filled with the Holy Ghost under the ministry of the two prophets so we know that God is gracious how many believe he's gracious today oh you you say well I've gone too far well the Jews probably went too far by doing what they did and yet God still has Mercy why there're his people you're his people today Amen in a in a in the sense of the election of being the bride now look and and and they said let his blood be on us and then released he barabus unto them when he had scourged Jesus and that that's we bypass that word too quickly scourged him what that means is they took a cat of nine tails which is a whip with nine strands and they tied little pieces of metal little pieces of glass in the end of it and they took it and it would wrap around the leather strands would wrap around the body and when they when they RI when they did pulled it would actually rip shreds of skin off of the body many people died just from the beating alone that's why they were limited how many times that they could beat him 39 times 39 straps because just one more might kill a man and so they they actually they actually uh scourged him they beat him and he was he had been up all night he's wore out and they delivered him to be crucified and the soldiers of the governor it wasn't enough for him to beat him but they mocked him they took him into the common Hall and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers and they stripped him and put on him a Scarlet robe now think about it a a band of soldiers they they had like a meeting and they come together for the purpose of mocking Jesus and when and when they planted a crown of thorns they put it on his head and a reed in his right hand they bowed the knee before him and mocked him saying hail King of the Jews and they spit on him and took the Reed and smote him on the head yeah now look what they were doing they were they were they were passionately mocking Christ and I know people say that we're too emotional I know they say that brother Ben you're just you're just too far out there you're too Pentecostal but if the soldiers inspired by the devil could pick up their whips and pick up and spit on him and violently accuse him and violently strike him with their hands if they could raise their voices mocking him why should I not raise my voice and saying he's worthy why should I not when when the mocking was done for me when the blood was shed for me why should I not raise my voice what's wrong with me lifting my voice to him lifting my hands to him if they could raise their voice in Anger why should I not be able to raise my voice in Praise this morning if they could grab a hold of him and th knock him down and bow before him in a mocking way let me bow the knee this morning in a great way to say Lord You're my God my Lord and my God if they could bow the knee in a mocking way let me bow the knee don't ever be afraid to worship Him Church don't ever be afraid they inspired by the devil beat him and mocked him why would I let anything get in the way of My Worship that's good they let him away after they mocked him they took the robe off of him put his own Rond on him led him away to crucify him and as they came out they found a man of sirene Simon by name him they compelled to bear his cross he didn't ask to be involved he was simply at the right Crossroads of time at the right place at the right time and when he was compelled to carry the cross it changed his life forever amen he was a witness to the death of Christ on the cross he actually carried the instrument of torture up the hill of golgatha he felt the weight of that but jesus carried the sins of the whole world and I I'll say to you this morning if he could carry the weight of my sin on him then I'll be willing to carry the weight of my cross if my cross is preaching if my cross say it maybe I'm going through a a hard time or a trial let me go through that let me carry that if I I can surely carry the weight of a piece of wood brother Joel I can surely carry the weight of showing up at church I can surely carry the weight of being an example to my children I can surely carry the weight of dressing like a Christian of acting like a Christian if you Carri the weight of my sins I can carry the weight of the Cross amen oh my excuse me for being a baby just makes me want to weep this morning think of what he did for me when they were come to a place called gotha it us to say a place of a skull they gave him vinegar to drink mingled with G and when he had tasted thereof he would not drink Simon was watching as they did all of this he was a witness They Crucified him and parted his garments casting lots that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet they parted my garments among them upon my vesture did they cast lots and sitting down they watched him there and set up over his head his accusation written this is Jesus king of the Jews Simon perhaps watching him from the crowd heard him cry I thirst yes they watched as they put a reed with vinegar in it to his face he wouldn't refuse to drink of it and they watched and he cried he watched and he cried and said it is finished and when he said it is finished what was finished was all the payment that would ever be that of all the separation that would ever separate an unrighteous people from a holy God the breach was made up the G the Gap was closed and we were able to go back to Heaven Again Hallelujah what happened to Simon we'll talk a little bit more about it later but he become a Christian his sons Rufus and Alexander the Bible tells us were well-known disciples in the early church his story impacted his people for Generations he's a witness of the death of Christ and his lifechanging power the second witness that I want to bring up this morning is one called Mary Magdalene Mary was one of Jesus helpers and Luke 8 verse1 says it came to pass afterward that he went throughout every city and Village preaching and showing the Glad Tidings of the kingdom of God and the twel were with him and certain women which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities Mary called Magdalene out of whom went Seven Devils and Joanna the wife of Chua Herod Stewart and Suzanna many others which ministered unto him of their substance in other words they followed the disciples around they gave them food and and maybe money that when they needed it they give them clothes what was it why did they do what they did why was she a Helper because she loved the Lord because he she had been delivered of Seven Devils I think if you've been delivered this morning you don't try to hinder God's people you're there to be a help to God's people you want to see the body of Christ help like Simon when the body of Christ was weak Simon carried the cross and when Jesus needed maybe his clothes was mened when he needed something Mary Magdalene was there oh she had a past but he was her future she had a past she had had Seven Devils but she knew what it was like to be delivered so it didn't make her dead and formal it caused her to want to help all she could why she'd been delivered yeah she didn't want to be a hindrance she wanted to be a help right she loved the Lord she'd been delivered I think we could all say Amen to that this morning I've been delivered and so I love him cuz he first loved me she was at crucifixion Matthew 27:55 any women were there beholding a far off which followed Jesus From Galilee ministering unto him among which was Mary Magdalene Mary the mother of James and Joseph and the mother of zeb's children listen Mary knew he was dead she knew he was dead oh Church she she saw him die yeah she not only knew that he was dead but she had firsthand knowledge that they buried him right Matthew 27:57 when the evening was come there came a rich man of arthea named Joseph who also himself was Jesus disciple he went to pilate and begged the body of Jesus then pilot commanded the body to be delivered and when Joseph had taken the body he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth and he laed in his own new tomb which he had hun out in the Rock and he rolled a great Stone to the door of the separ and departed and there was Mary Magdalene and the other Mary sitting over against the separ they followed him to the tomb they watched as his body was wrapped and laid inside the tomb and they watched the men grab the stone and roll it over the tomb if anybody knew that Jesus was in the Tomb tomb it was Mary and you say why would God have her there if she was to be a witness of his inment so she could be a witness of his resurrection you see you realize many times the things you go through you don't know why you had to go through what you went through but you had to be a witness of his in tement so you could be a witness of his resurrection I've had to be a witness of some things I wish I hadn't seen i' I've had to be a witness of times in my life when I wasn't all I should have been brother Joe but I know this I was a witness of when he was in Tomb I was a witness when he wasn't raised in my life but I am a witness today of his Resurrection Mary was a witness he was dead he didn't just go to sleep for a while but he was dead and he was buried in a borrowed tomb Hallelujah but he wouldn't need it for long that's right amen why do we bury our dead just as an aside you think about that for a minute it's because of the hope of the Resurrection that's why we perform burials I know some and there's nothing against the word when if you have a cremation that's not what I'm saying the reason traditionally We buried our dead along with the Jews is because we believe they're com into life again but I want you to know for thousands of years everybody who was buried stayed there we have instances of people raised from the dead prior to burial but nobody come out of a grave until Jesus come on the earth amen hallelujah and the first one to walk out again to be restored back to their old body out of a grave to to take a human form again oh oh God was Lazarus when Jesus told Mary listen Martha said to him I know that he raised again in the resurrection of the last day and Jesus said unto her I am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and after corruption it already set in Lazarus had already his nose had already caved in he was already by this time he said they said he stinks the worms have begun to destroy his body and yet it was at that moment that the scripture was fulfilled amen that the Redeemer stood there and he said Lazarus come forth when he did a man who had been dead 4 days walked out like he'd never died amen now look he raised Lazarus after corruption but there was promised one who had raised before corruption said him Psalm 16:10 for thou will not leave my soul in Hell Nei Willl thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption Mary magdaline and Mary the mother of Joseph beheld where he was laid Mark 15:47 they beheld where he was laid they were there they seen him they saw him die they saw him laid in in the grave the stone Rod across the door Mark 16:9 now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week look I love this I absolutely love the fact that he didn't appear to the disciples CU they didn't have enough Faith right they just said that was just a dream that just an emotional experience all right but Mary out of whom had been delivered Seven Devils was the first one at the two and the first one to see he even hid himself from Peter and John when they were there though he appears privately to Peter later and then to the disciples but he hid himself from Peter and John while they were there they could didn't see him but Mary remained oh my you know sometimes we linger in the service say why why do you linger why do you worship because sometimes good things happen to people who remain in the in the presence of a resurrected Christ amen now look when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week he appeared first to Mary Magdalene John chapter 20 and verse one the first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early when it was yet dark unto the septier and seeth the stone taken away from the Seiler then she runneth and cometh to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved and saith unto them they have taken away the Lord out of the septier and we know not where they have laid him Peter therefore went forth and that other disciple I love the way John describes himself and came to the Seer so they ran both together and the other disciple did outrun Peter interesting note that's the way I'd have written it too and came first to The Seer and he stooping down looking in saw the linen clothes lying yet went he not in and come and Simon Peter following him went into the Seer and seeth the linen clothes lie and the napkin that was about his head not lying with the linen clothes but wrapped together in a place by itself oh my listen he did not he was preparing he was saying I'll be back am he did not appear when they were all there he waited on Mary but Mary stood without at the septier Weeping yeah John and Peter went home in the meantime and she stood there weeping and as she wept she stooped down and looked into the SRE and see two angels in white sitting one at the head the other at the feet where the body of Jesus had Lin and they say unto her woman why weepest thou she saith unto them because they have taken away my Lord and I know not where they have laid him listen the the knowledge of an empty tomb was not enough to take away your grief listen to me this morning the knowledge of an empty tomb is not enough to take away your grief it's the knowledge of the presence of a risen living savior GL to God many people know or think they know that the tomb is empty but we know a present resurrected Jesus who's the same yesterday today and forever yes hey man he said I don't they've taken my Lord and I don't know not where they've laid him when she had said thus she turned herself back and saw Jesus standing and knew not that it was Jesus and Jesus saith unto her woman why weepest thou whom seekest thou she supposing him to be the gardener saith un him sir if thou had borne him hence tell me where thou has laid him and I will take him away Jesus saith unto her Mary she didn't recognize his form that he' taken but she recognized his voice oh Church in this age I didn't recognize immediately the form he had taken in his body of the Bride but I recognize his voice when he spoke it was more than a voice of a man it's a voice of God right I'm not talking about a prophet's physical voice I'm talking about the message of the hour I'm talking about your voice I'm talking about the final voice to the fin final age is Christ amen Jesus said Mary she turned herself saith unto him raboni was just to say master listen she was a witness to all of it and the very first witness of his resurrection amen I want to call to your memory another witness bring him to the stand this morning if you will Peter the Apostle now Simon carried the cross Mary waited by the tomb but Peter did everything wrong you ever thought about Peter that weekend he did not equit himself well sorry Peter come on good come on he did he stood there at the he did he messed up everything he did he did wrong he go he starts rebuking Jesus and Jesus has to tell him get behind me Jesus tries to wash his feet and he gets all messed up doctrinally say what you need to wash all of me becomes a legalist right he he he just does everything wrong when when the Jesus said one of you will betray me everybody looked at Peter and Peter even said Lord is it me what a witness he ran home like a coward when Jesus was Tried by the S hadri and Peter followed for a little while but when he got there he denied him three times cursed tried to prove he wasn't a Believer ran home like a coward didn't even attend the crucifixion or the burial John not only outran him to the tomb but then he describes every detail of his betrayal now you tell me if you think this a credible witness or not John 21:3 look he wasn't very credible he gets back after they've seen him and backslides he said what do you mean by that well he went fishing you remember where he come from they didn't go fishing for fun they went fishing for money and so what they did is that when they followed Jesus they left their Nets and so Peter for the first time since Jesus has been on the earth now Peter is now going to go back to his Nets after he seen him right but he just didn't have the confidence Oh my he just couldn't he just couldn't wrap his mind around the fact God wanted to use him he knew Jesus was dead but he didn't know that he he could be used oh my and Simon Peter says I go a fishing and I want you to know tonight this or this morning this verse proves gifts and callings are without repentance because when Peter said I go a fishing they say to him we also go with thee that's why a person with a gift can lead people right or wrong right he they backside with him but Jesus was greater than their back sidings aren't you oh a that so wonderful this aren't you grateful look they went forth and entered into a ship immediately that night they caught nothing not only did he fail at being a a testimony to the people not only did he fail at even watching the crucifixion but he even failed at fishing he was even a bad backslider couldn't even do that right sat there miserably fishing all night long all the things he used to do to make himself happy didn't work no more all the life of a backslider is miserable it's miserable because all the things you may you think you young people you might think well I'll go out in the world and I I'll se My Wild Oats but if you've ever been in contact with Jesus none of the things that used to make you happy will ever make you happy again he's fishing miserably yes in John 21:4 when the morning was now come Jesus stood on the shore but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus they never knew till he said who he was and Jesus said unto them children have you any meat they answered him no he said unto them cast a net on the right side of the ship and you'll find they cast therefore and now because they were in the habit of doing what Jesus said even though they didn't know it was him I love that take your kids to church cuz they just might listen to The Voice one day and cast their net on the right side of the ship because that's their habit of listening right sir and Peter as soon as oh my soon as them fish started to tug Peter ah I've been here before there's only one man that can turn my sorrow into Joy yeah only one man that can turn my mour into dancing only one man that can that can give me what I have need of right amen he recognized it was him and he put his coat on him and jumped off in the lake swam to the shore and Jesus got food fixed for him F he he made himself a Meal made him a meal and and the disciples sat there and ate with him and Jesus pulled Peter aside and he said Peter do you love me more than these you love me more than than these others Peter you better you know I'm here right you just went through a whole weekend where you did nothing right you don't seem to be a very credible witness but Peter if you love me feed my sheep to God I feel this morning most identified with Peter because I know what I've done I know that I'm not at times I I haven't been as a young person you said brother B you never went out in the world but I I had a religious spirit on me I had a worse demon than all seven of Mary magdalene's demons put together and that was a religious spirit and I know what it's like I know what it's like to be away from his presence but I know what it's like to be forgiven Peter knew what it was like to fail but he knew what it was like to be forgiven Hallelujah Jesus said feed my sheep and so he went there in Acts 1 and8 and he told his disciples in his Ascension he said but you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you you should be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem in all Judea and Samaria and unto the uttermost parts of the earth and we find Peter the same guy who who did everything wrong on Easter did everything right at Pentecost glory to God what was it it was the Holy Ghost that made the difference Peter stood up with the 11 lifted up his voice and said unto him ye men of Judea and all ye that dwell in Jerusalem be this known unto you and hearken to my words he said I'm I'm a witness not only of the death Peril and Resurrection but of his return and the power of the Holy Ghost he said in the same place look I I just imagine I don't know if this is true but I imagine that Peter could see the spot where he betrayed Jesus you can see where the fire was he warmed his hands when he cursed and said I'm not one of his oh my but he got so filled with the Holy Ghost that it didn't even cross his mind the irony of it that a man who 50 days before was a betrayer of Christ could stand and say this is that didn't care what they said about him didn't care whether they killed him or not he become a witness and I want to present to you today as we presented three resurrect or three Witnesses of his resurrection I want to present to you today that we have witnesses of his resurrection today in John 14: 19 the Bible says yet a little while in the world seeth me no more but you see me because I live ye shall live also and brother brandom tells us in in 1965 and it is the rising of the sun he said because I live you live also speaking to his wife because I live you live also what a resurrection that that was and what a resurrection this is to be quickened from the dead to be made alive in Christ Jesus by God's quickening power now I want to very quickly I know you say brother Ben we're going to end early today brother BS got through all three well I didn't say there was not two sets of three we won't take as long on the second set now watch brother BR said they seen his resurrection and today we are seeing his resurrection the sign of his resurrection ction Jonah three days and nights was in the belly of the well on the third day he arose from the well Jesus raised from the dead after being three days in his belly 2,000 years he's been absent from the church but he promised through Joel what the Palmer worm left the caterpillar eaten but I will restore sayith the Lord all that the Palmer worm and the caterpillar and the Locust and so forth eat up I will restore it in the last days what is it it's another Resurrection are you with me so far now look at these Witnesses of his resurrection Jesus lived in our day and he lives today but Jesus proved himself to be alive after 2,000 years now he began doing that through the ministry of a prophet named William brandham now watch watch what happened it wasn't brother brandham it was Christ proving himself alive I want to call my first witness the blind girl in Jonesboro because there's a special connection between her and our first Witnesses witness Simon the sirene look brother brandom tells us about that blind girl he said she was wandering through the crowd and brother brandom was actually outside of where the meeting was right here in Jonesboro just a few miles away and brother brandom is want the the little girl is wandering around and he sees her and she's crying out for her father and she's lost her father father and so the little girl is wandering through there and she's completely blind brother Brenham has compassion on her and he said he stood where she would bump into him and she ran into him and she said sir can you help me find my father all right she said I need to get to the Healer and she said actually I love her I love her faith she said actually if you can get me to the Healer I'll find my father myself come on Hallelujah and so brother BR standing there and having compassion on her he begins to talk to her and finally explains who he was said I'm not a Healer but I'm someone I'm brother brandom I'm the one that can lay hands on you and and she said she believed and brother Brandon began to pray for her and when he begin to pray for her he said I just took her by the hand and I said Heavenly Father years ago I want to tell you something today everything you're doing now will matter if there is a future right right you think it doesn't matter but it does matter right the the the times the way we live our lives good and bad matters to our children it matters to our grandchildren right and I'm so thankful for grace for the bad but I want the good to have be effective right and by Simon picking up his cross that had a special impact on brother Brandon that story me something to a prophet now Simon was a black man come out of sirene he come out of Africa Northern Africa he was a black man and and Simon being a black man brother brandom saw a black girl and he looks at her and he says this is one of Simon's children you think it don't make a difference what you do look after 2,000 years a prophet's heart is moved sir by what Simon did Hallelujah and it begins to remind God of it Heavenly Father years ago there was an Old Rugged Cross dragging down through Jerusalem the streets dragging out the bloody Footprints of the bear on his Road up the hill his little weak frail body fell under the load there was Simon the sirene came and picked up the cross and helped him to Bear it on I said here is one of his children tonight staggering in darkness Lord he said I'm sure you understand the Harvey won't be in vain he'll repay every every bit sir every bit of work every time you went to church you didn't feel like it every time you every time you shook somebody's hand and greeted them with a smile even though you felt like hitting them in the face I'm not saying brother Harve you ever did that but we all have at some point every time you forgave every time you love every time you picked up your cross every time you did the hard things and you committed yourself to working and doing all you could for Christ and to carrying the cross for the body when it was weak there's a repayment for that it'll show up in your kids it'll show up in your grandkids it'll show up in your great grandkids if he carries will and it showed up 2,000 years after Simon carried his cross he said there here is one of his children tonight Lord I'm sure you understand she be to praise God she could see that was all there was to it she had her sight what was she a witness of a resurrected Jesus Christ here on the earth amen right Hatty Wright was a witness I know we talk about Hatty Wright hady Wright moer a lot but she was a witness and and she's remarkable because of how unremarkable she is that's what makes her remarkable to us but she was a helper to the gospel you say the little things don't matter they do matter hady rright was a help help her and what she did you know she could have sit there so well I don't have no money the church ought to be giving me money but she didn't do that and I think we ought to help all uh the widows and the and the poor people all that we can help but that wasn't her attitude that's right she sat there with the right attitude and she'd given she tried to give $200 I think it was to the fund the building fund for the Tabernacle and uh the trustees wouldn't take it so she gave $20 and it was all the money maybe that she made in a month and $200 all the money she made maybe in a year and trying to scratch out a living on a on a dirt farm and and so she she had given that $20 now brother Brown begins to think about that $20 because they told her what had happened he said I'm going to get that back to her and the Lord actually rebuked him for that and said don't give it back to her right he said because because he said it was just like the woman that gave her two pence Jesus never rebuked her never stopped her right she gave of her all and so brother brand said I kept the $20 in my pocket oh my and he said a little old quiet sister Haddie now brother brandom begins to tell the stories of the of the uh of the squirrels who were spoken into existence now that seems like an incredible thing and I know sometimes we we we almost feel embarrassed we say well why why do we have to tell these stories why do we have to talk about these things that that happened during a prophet's Ministry well the we saw God in a mighty way yeah but I believe there's more stories today I believe you have a story I have a story of things God's done for us but these were stories that were real why we believe the witnesses right and so here was a little old woman and and brother tells a story about the the squirrels spoken into existence and this new ministry and things like that and as he's telling it he said little old sister hadie sitting back there a little dust B and on like the country women wear there she'd put on a little clean dress to come over to help her mother cook me dinner and she was sitting with her hand like this all you mothers you think it'll it'll never it'll never you'll never be repayed you just watch and see what God does she was sitting there with her hand like this she said that's nothing but the truth she said the right thing just as she said that she said the right thing the spirit of the Lord said to me tell her to ask what she will and you give it to her I couldn't speak that room everybody felt strange I said sister Haddie she said yes brother brandom I said ask anything that's in your heart anything you want to you ask thus said the Lord I'll speak it behind you you'll have it she said the salvation of my two boys I said you have it in the name of the Lord and those two little modern teenage SLE Fritz boys that had hated the very cause of Christ grabbed one another and begin to scream the blessings of God he said the power of God struck that place Banks fell into his plate he said I don't know what happened for about 10 minutes friend do you realize what that was he said I've never in all my life felt such anointing the first time it was ever performed on a human being it bypassed Aristocrats it bypassed everything else went to a poor little old widow woman living up on the hill there and God knew what she would ask her two boys oh help me preach this morning I I don't ask you very much but but but I want to get to this last Point help me preach this morning she they were gloriously saved the very minute it was spoken hallelujah what was it listen to me now she acknowledged the accuracy of prophet's words she said he was right she said Oh Glory to God it was nothing but the truth and when she did her family was saved listen to me you need to come to terms with the fact this message is right you need to get to where you believe it if you ever can get to where you say I may not be what I should be but I know that message is right I may not be able to do all I I need to be do but I know that the message right you said that don't matter to say it does matter because when she come to terms and say there's nothing but the truth and she believed it in her heart when that happened it changed her family trajectory just like it did Simon you want to make a difference in your family pick up your cross and acknowledge that this message is true if you're struggling with that in your mind for your kids's sake you need to settle that finally down to our last witness you're going to call Brother the B they already put it up I'm a witness and I want us each one to take it personally I'm a witness you you boys sitting here on the front row you're a witness man you're a witness of the resurrection of Christ you well I never saw him I never walked with him neither did Paul but he was a witness of the power of his resurrection like Simon I know his power breaks family curses all right we ought to just stop there and Shout for a while I know where some of you come from I know the darkness that you come out of I know the darkness behind me I know what's in my in my family's past I know what's back there but I also know that his that his power breaks family curses sir Hallelujah and oh when he called me when I was compelled by election to pick up the cross he met me there and I've never been the same and my family is not the same you say it doesn't work it works for my kids it'll work for your kids it'll work today it'll work tomorrow it'll work next week he say well my kids have gone beyond the Ark of Safety they've went out of the world they'll be back why because this message works right Hallelujah I'm a witness come on I'm will witness that a curse a curse of lust can be broken a curse of n false Doctrine can be broken a curse of all kinds of nonsense can be broken off of a family because somebody steps up sir and acknowledges what he already did for us believes the message of the hour I'm a witness he's alive today amen like Mary Magdalene I'm a witness of his Mercy amen I've been delivered of some devils in my time I I just think we ought to just recognize and call it what it is like we said last week brother man said that's Spirit of lust you just say well it's just a normal human thing he said not that way he said it's a devil and you've been delivered of some devils in your life and so you can cry out like Mary Magdalene and say I know he saved me I know he loved me because he delivered me of Seven Devils I'm a witness sir of oh Hallelujah I'm a wit of the resurrection of Jesus like hady right or like the blind girl or like like Peter let's just get it right like Peter I'm getting ahead of myself he's healed my backslidings thank oh I thank God for his grace this morning every one of us ought to do that you said but been

this morning with the power of the Holy Ghost that's make you a witness of his resurrection like the blind girl my eyes been opened that's right for the truth thank you Lord hallelujah I used to wander in darkness looking for some healer Hallelujah but I bumped into this message and when I did my mother's prayers begin to come true in my life right hallelujah oh Jesus help us today like Cy I

you when we witness to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ I'm not here this morning to speak to you of a fable but I'm here to speak to you with assurance and with with all that I've got in me that this message is true that works that the resurrected Jesus Christ is alive to well today the Holy Ghost still works the prescription still works Hallelujah so we believe Jesus Christ is
