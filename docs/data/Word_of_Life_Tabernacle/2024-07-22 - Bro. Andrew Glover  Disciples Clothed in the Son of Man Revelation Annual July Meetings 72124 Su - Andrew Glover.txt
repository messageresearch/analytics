words brother wle preached on the authority of the sons of God last night wasn't that wonderful last night my goodness I I think we ought to be able to just speak and see it happen right in front of us we should be able to tell that mountain to move and we are able are we willing just do it that's all we've got to do and I believe the Lord really helped some people last night in the prayer lines I I just really believe that I you say well brother Ben why is that necessary I don't have to go to a prayer line to get help that's true but we're human beings and sometimes we need to feel that presence and we need to know somebody's praying and and there's a reason why he said lay hands on the sick sometimes you need that touch and God uses the hands of men brother brandom even talked about how anointed men had that that they showed that there was light in in their hands and that we don't understand all of that but we know that God uses that so we believe that people were helped last night we're going to have a a baptism at the end of the service today uh brother uh Jaden Jones is going to be baptized this morning and uh so right after the uh service what we do here our baptistry is in the fellowship hall so at the end of the service once we're through worshiping and everything we'll just go straight there and do that and then of course we'll have lunch at the fellowship hall

body and amen we thank the Lord for the favor he's given us and the grace and I have to say this um I'm probably using the wrong word amen but I am very proud of this man of God and what God has done with him and through him in this assembly amen I think we ought to give God praise amen for men of God that will stand for this message amen with a vision amen and a burden to serve and we sure thank

and Lord calling out everything that's unlike him and his word now Lord as we Endeavor this morning to open the pages of this book and to speak a few things from it Lord I'm asking that you would send the angels of God into this building Lord as these men of God have stood behind this sacred desk service after service this week and Lord they've poured their hearts out and preached the word of God

we pray and all the Believers says amen and amen God bless you this morning if you have your Bibles we want to go back to the book of St Mark the 16th chapter amen the book of St Mark the 16th chapter and we do want to say it is real special to have brother Ben beard with us here God bless you and Amen brother Bose meeting amen these pastors taking a amen a Sunday away from their churches to be here we sure appreciate that don't we amen these these men of God coming to support the meetings and sure glad to have my wife here and Malachi with us this time and amen it's just ain't it good it's good time to serve the Lord amen amen God bless you brother Tim we sure appreciate you and amen all the ministry here how many thanks God for the men of God Amen amen St Mark chapter 16 and verse number 19 so then after the Lord had spoken unto them he was received up into heaven and sat on the right hand of God and they went forth somebody say they went forth they can I tell you who those they are the disciples and they went forth and preached everywhere now watch this the Lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following aen now if we go to the book of St Luke the 9th chapter St Luke chapter 9 and verse one we're going to identify who the they are of this St Mark 16 in Luke chapter 9 and verse number one the Bible said then he called his 12 disciples together and gave them power and authority over all devils and to cure diseases and he sent them to preach the kingdom of God and to heal the sick now they are disciples who have been commissioned or they've been sent now if you're going to be sent you got to have something to say when you go in the book of St Luke the 17th chapter we will find what those disciples have been commissioned Amen to preach and St Luke chapter 17 and verse number 26 the Bible says as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be also in the days of the son of man they did eat they drink they married wives they were given in marriage until the day that Noah entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all now likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they builded but the same day that lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all now here it is even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed so the disciples will be preaching the revelation of Jesus Christ we ask Lord this morning to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you can have your seats this morning I want to uh by the help of the Lord for just a few moments to speak to here and if I title this today I just want to speak to you on disciples clothed in the son of man Revelation disciples uh clothed in the son of man Revelation now uh you all know this morning that another word for clothes amen would actually be the word garment the prophet of God comes in the seventh seal 1963 and he says now we can see the elements are ready to bring the church into the presence of Christ he said we can see the bride taking form amen putting the wedding garment on making ready amen we can see the bride taking on the form she's putting on the wedding garment she's making ready I'll say this it took a prophet to identify amen the wedding garment to the church and he says it like this he said now see the wedding garment is the baptism amen of the Holy Spirit now you all know amen that when a prophet comes he is a bringer amen or a Divine revealer of the word so when a prophet comes he will bring word but he will not bring any kind of word but rather he will bring authoritative word now when you look at that word authoritative it means able to be trusted as being accurate or true it is reliable it is very likely to be respected and obeyed so in other words amen whatever a prophet brings among the church amen it's not going to have a question mark over it but it's going to have an assurance with it that what's being brought and what's being said and what's being taught amen is able to be trusted now brother B tells us that there's actually two kinds of word among the church he said there is authoritative word he said then there's unauthoritative word he said if we got God's word and know that it's the truth then we can be persistent Amen brother and move right on in because God said so that's the reason I've always depended on that I don't go in myself I go when he tells me amen I stay right with his word I don't go to the right or to the left I stay right with it amen and that's the reason he blesses it amen no matter how the devil tries for everything in front of you amen you say you put your church if you be this but you stay with it amen because God promised it it's his word amen stay with it it's authoritative word amen of almighty God can I say this to every believer Amen in every assembly represented amen stay with the word amen stay with the word and stay on the word amen don't move to the left or to the right or to the back or to the front amen stay on the word of almighty God and anything that's an authoritative do not believe it he said I don't care who said it amen do not believe it now amen I believe that one of our scriptural promises for this age amen is that the son of man would be revealed according to Luke 17:30 he said the day when the son of man is revealed now when you look at that word revealed amen it means to uncover or to lay open what has been veiled or covered Amen to disclose to make known to make manifest Amen to disclose what was before unknown amen so at one time the revelation of the son of man was disclosed amen it was unknown rather it was covered up amen but this is the age of the unveiling amen it's in the Book of Revelation that the time is at hand Amen to unseal the Saints of this book brother said we want to keep it right as close as we can with the Lord amen and with his word amen because we see his word is unveiling itself amen day by day day by day in the church age book he said now the Greek word for Revelation amen is apocalyps which means unveiling he said now this unveiling is perfectly described Amen in the example of a sculpture who is unveiling his work of staty Amen exposing it to the onlooker it is an uncovering it is a revealing amen of what was previously hidden he said now the uncovering is not only the Revelation amen of the person of Christ amen but it is the revelation of his Future Works Amen in the oncoming seven Church ages amen so this Revelation amen is moving from the head amen into the body amen as God unveils his word he is bringing the authority of the holy word into the Church of the Living God let me say this I refuse Amen to back off of the preaching amen of the revelation of the son of man I know guys have gone out in left field and they've taught things that should have never been taught they said things that should have never been said amen but listen because there's a hypocrite at Walmart you don't stop going to Walmart and because there's a hypocrite at McDonald's you don't quit going to McDonald's and because there's been scarecrows around amen the Glorious divinely revealed mystery truth it will not stop the Bride of Jesus Christ amen from moving into her inheritance as the Sons and Daughters of God listen what we're preaching is not backed up by a seminary it's not backed up by denomination amen as a matter of fact if the denomination had their way amen they would silence every message preacher they would lock the doors of every mes church amen but I want to say it's been 50 years amen and there's still a voice amen of the message of the hour because heaven backs up this message the Angels back up this message the power of God is with this message that's why we stand here this morning and say this is more than just a religion this is more than just an idea amen this is amen the disclosing of the mind of God in the age you're living in now 1964 brother Ram comes along and he preaches a sermon called the unveiling of God he said now my subject this morning amen is to reveal or unveil that God he said now see he come you all know these things you've heard them all weekend amen he comes in three sons names amen the son of man the Son of God and the son of David he said he came first as the son of man Jehovah himself called Ezekiel and the prophet son of man he never referred to himself amen as Son of God he referred to himself as the son of man amen because the scriptures cannot be broken in Deuteronomy 18 the Bible says amen that God would raise up a prophet amen Laing unto Moses now I know it's such a debated subject anymore amen but let's just go ahead and give the devil a black eye amen we are not following a man we are following the God of all prophets amen now the Bible said that Jesus was a prophet amen raised up likeing into Moses right okay then let me ask you this amen the Bible in Revelation 19 says that the spirit or the testimony of Jesus Amen is the spirit of Prophecy you know why we got so much confusion is because people amen have made the prophet the God Amen and they've got God following the man amen but let me reverse that for you this morning amen the pillar of fire amen was not following William brandham amen William brandham was following the pillar of fire because it was the return of the unveiling of the Living God come on we ought to be the happiest people on the face of the Earth this morning for the first time in 2,000 years we can preach every verse in the Bible and not have to dismiss one line we can read acts and Genesis and exodus and Hebrews and we can say it's the truth come on somebody say Amen somebody say well y'all are falling a man amen I'll prove to you the nominations is Fallen a man amen cuz you ask them why the women are cutting their hair and they'll tell you because some Theologian amen told them Corinthians didn't have no value today so they're following a theologian go ask them why they're baptizing in titles and they'll tell you because some man said said you ought to baptized according to Matthew 28:19 but there is a bride on the earth this morning who is following every word of God with an authority behind it remember between the Son of God and the son of David he would come as the son of man amen fulfilling the rest of the scripture now I just want to take a moment here and read to you some quotes Amen in a yearly order amen of the prophet's Ministry concerning the revealing of the son of man 1958 if you get time to listen listen it's a very powerful tape he's called the called out he said now Jesus said when the son of man is revealed from Heaven the son of man is now being revealed from heaven will it come after a while brother brandom it is now he said the son of man has already come from glory and is revealing himself for the past few years Amen to his church in Mercy amen showing them his great presence doing the same things that he did when he was here on the earth amen revealing himself like he did to Abraham amen before the destruction it is the rising of the sun he said now who is the son of man in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and if all the teaching that we have Amen in confirmation of the word of God by word of God by Signs by wonders we see today in Luke 17:30 Malachi for and the different scriptures we are acquainted with amen that the word again is waved over the people so the revelation of the son of man amen is the waving of the word over the people that the Dead traditions of man is dead and the Son of God is alive again with the baptism of the holy spirit amen and he is right Among Us and he is giving us life 1964 when their eyes were open he said when you see the sun of man revealed amen the word come back in human flesh 1964 the voice of the sign he said the son of man is prophesied to be revealed and what kind of a revelation will it be it will be the revelation of his living after being crucified for 19900 years that he is raised from the dead and is alive with us amen revealing Christ in the promise of the age can I give you one more amen now watch in the day when the son of man is being revealed amen a son of man amen Jesus Christ made manifest among his people if you are looking for the revealing of the son of man then you've missed it because we're not looking for it amen but we're looking at it amen can I say this amen when you come to this prayer line last night you were not coming to be touched by a man but it was a manifestation of the revelation of the son of man in the age you're living in listen if you're looking for something then that means you ain't found it but if you found something you quit looking for it and you start looking at it well we might as well preach it Sunday morning amen you quit looking for it and you start looking at it somebody say well amen I'm looking for the bride's Revival well I'm sorry I'm looking at it they say well I'm looking for the mighty angel I'm sorry I've seen him I'm looking for the pillar of fire listen I'm looking at the pillar of fire I'm looking for the message I'm looking at the message come on Church you all know I'm in the message I'm in the message recognizing your day and its message and the prophet of God said he said now listen they're saying fast and pray amen fast and pray amen you all realize that they're good people right amen they're good people but a prophet said the reason they're in the condition they're in is they have missed the Awakening of the Bride I was just out the other day in California and we actually went down Los Angeles down there to the isusa street and you go down there and actually we went over there about I think it's about 5:00 in the afternoon and brother Jesse they had a building there and we went knocked on the door about 459 they had already locked the door you know well I thought it was a zza street Museum and I really wanted to see it you know so we knocked on the door and the guy come the door and he said now hey he said y'all want to come in I said yeah so we go in there brother Joe Adams and some PE some Believers from St Marcos was with us so we walk in there well I'm thinking we're going in the museum him and brother Ben little and I know we was going in a Prayer Tower now they had three they had three banners at the front door they had a sign that said the first Pentecost which was Acts two they had another sign that said the second Pentecost which was 1906 OFA then they had another banner and it said we are building this prayer tower for the prayer of a third Pentecost he said now look it will come out of Asia and they had this board there and they had all these people screaming and hollering and praying so we signed in you know and amen a few minutes later he said now there's a restroom here and there's a water fountain here and The Prayer Tower is back there you know and I thought there Lord what have I got myself into amen so we walk in there and I'll be honest with you brother Caleb you walk in there they've got a they've got a building just like this they got a platform they got instruments and they have somebody around the clock amen playing and singing and they're praying for another Pentecost listen brother Joe I'm not a crazy man but as I sat there in that building and watch that I heard the voice of brother random in the back of my mind say they're good people and they're Christians and they feel the pull of the hour but the reason they're in this condition is they were looking for a prophet but a prophet was standing in front of them listen and here we are in 2024 and they've gone back to isusa Street and they're trying to pray up another move of God but over here on the side of the road in Hardy Arkansas it's some Holy Ghost Field fire baptized believer and there's Revival fires and they're burning this morning I want to say the Revival is not coming the Revival is here and the Revival is in the revelation of the son of man in the power of his resurrection yes sir it's not an angel it's Jesus Christ he's the one you're feeding onen the son of man is cist see you're not feeding on a man his words will fail but you're feed meing on the unfailing body word of the son of man brother man preaches this sermon and he says Christ is revealed in his own word he said so the whole Bible somebody say the whole Bible it's not the word of the man isn't that good neither was it wrote by man or brought by man and neither can it be revealed by man that's powerful right there the Bible wasn't wrot by man it was brought by man and neither can it be revealed by man it's God's word revealed by God himself his own interpreter amen Christ revealing himself in his own word see then what is it the interpretation amen belongs to God he said may God open our blinded eyes to a scripture promise to know that we are living in the last days you say preacher I bet that felt I bet seeing that made you feel pretty high and mighty as a matter of fact it made me want to find somewhere and cry my eyes out Amen to thank my God that he would come to the hills of East Tennessee and claim an old come on church he would claim a Kentucky boy in the hills of Kentucky and that message would come to Tennessee it would come to Arkansas sister Roberta it would come to Missouri it would come to Virginia it would come to Ohio it would go to Louisiana listen there is a bride of Believers around the world and a man has not gathered us a preacher has not gathered us but the son of man revealing has gathered a body of Believers come on Amen I'll just goe and say it amen the day you don't think you need this message is the day you might as well go to a Baptist Church because without this message we're another group of people with another building another tithing account another musician but if we have this message we got a right to shout the shills heart we got a right to praise God because the message of the hour is our Authority let me say it like this I wouldn't know Ben prit and Ben prit wouldn't know me if it wasn't for this message have you ever thought about that Amen brother Ben you wouldn't know me and I wouldn't know you if it wasn't for this message but one message has brought the East to the West it's brought the North to the South it's brought continents together what is saying to oh I feel good right now I'm saying don't you ever forget the message message of the hour is the reason we're here the message of the hour has United us and you know what I say I say devil get out of the Church of the Living God get out of our fellowship get out of our Brotherhood get out of our meetings get out of our homes you didn't do it so you can't stop it yes sir God does the revealing now I say to you like this God does the revealing and we do the following in other words if there's something amen done then there is a reaction to the action can I say this Christ is the revealer and we are the followers the prophet of God said you have to do something to cause something to follow it now listen we're not just following something because everybody else is going this way we are following this word amen because the action was the revealing of the son of man and the reaction was the quickening of a seed amen to follow the Revelation in the age you're living that's why Jesus stood there and he said these very powerful words he said if a man will come after me then let him deny himself and take up his cross amen and follow me look at this word follow it is to join one as a disciple amen or to become or to be his disciple so when Jesus Christ commissioned you amen and called you to follow him he was not asking you amen just to be a church member he was not asking you just to be a campground Christian he was not asking you just to hold an office in a local assembly but he was calling you Amen to join him in the Great Commission of Mark 16 and to become one of his disciples brother said the leadership of God is amen follow the Vindicated word of the hour amen by the Holy Ghost can I say this to you we have been made amen Disciples of Christ in St John 8:31 Jesus said if ye continue in my word amen then are ye my disciples indeed brother R comes along and says the disciples today is a lot different from the Disciples of old amen the Disciples of old amen they brought the Seeker into the presence of God but the Disciples of the day amen bring them in the presence of the church or some organization or some affiliation or some Creed or some Doctrine instead of bringing them into the presence of Christ now can I stop here and say this I know there's been a lot of contention Amen on the point of a prophet's quote where he said my Ministry is to declare him that he is here but can I say the only reason why there's contention on that quot is because in his presence is where his promises are fulfilled so if the devil can get you in the presence of a Creed or a Doctrine or an affiliation then you'll just be another lukew leoty and church member but if you can by the message of the hour move into the presence of Jesus Christ in his presence is the fullness of joy in his presence is the power of God under salvation I'm talking about the presence of Jesus Christ in the reality of his resurrection that's why I say to you we oh god well it's here I might as well preach that and then guys take quotes and they just twist them and use them however they want to and they say well we're getting people to Christ or to the message and not to Christ y'all know me well enough to know that I'm just a country boy and don't really know how to say things right so I'm just going to say it the way I think about it that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard we're getting them to the message and not to Christ that's like saying we're getting them to McDonald's and not showing them Ronald McDonald come on Church he's the focus of the restaurant and if you made something else the focus of this message it's not the message the problem you're the problem this message is not William Brandon it's not any preacher this message is Jesus Christ then how can you get somebody Amen to the message of the hour and not get them to Jesus [Music] Christ well it's a truth anyhow so that makes two types of disciples that makes a true disciple and a false disciple I want to I want to read you something here in Christianity disciple primely refer primarily rather refers to a dedicated follower of Jesus this term is found in the New Testament only in the gospels and the acts in the ancient world Amen a disciple is a follower or an adherent of a teacher discipleship is not the same as being student in the modern sense listen here a disciple in the ancient biblical World actively imitated both the life the teaching of the master are you ready for this it was a deliberate apprenticeship which made the fully formed disciple a living copy of the master oh Church of the Living God so a disciple amen was a fully formed disciple but they were a perfect amen copy of the master so however the master acted was the way the disciples would act however the master conducted himself it's the way the disciples will conduct themselves can I say this amen if the master went to church the disciples will too if the master believed in preaching the disciples will too if the master believed in the Supernatural then the disciples will too I might as well preach if the master believed in forgiven then the disciples will too if the master could go through hard times and still stand as a fully formed amen stature of the Living God then so can we as disciples can I say this disciples are to be leaders amen that how do we lead amen we lead by what we're following the Bible said be ye followers of me amen even as I also am of Christ brother picks this up and he says before me amen believe me as I teach you of Jesus Christ Paul said be followers of me as I am of Christ there might be man come through here everything drops through here these critics not only here but everywhere they have all kinds of this and that and the other I know it Christian friend but that don't take away from the real if a man speaks and God confirms what the man said you haven't got any right to doubt him if a man speaks and God doesn't speak with him then you got a right to doubt the person amen because that's just a man can I say this we are not denominational disciples the Disciples of Jesus Amen took them to Jesus a Methodist disciple takes him to the Methodist a Baptist disciple takes him to the Baptist a Pentecostal takes him to the Pentecostal but a disciple of Christ amen will take them to Christ and Christ will take them to Calvary amen there's the real thing let me just go ahead and knock another devil out the message of the hour was not the replacing of Calvary it was the revealing of Calvary come on church amen they had so watered down Calvary and denomination last Calvary it almost lost any effect over the human life but a Prophet come Among Us and he said now this may be a strange sermon in the middle of September in the year of 1960 and it's not even Easter morning but I'm going to preach to you on that day at Calvary and I'm going to tell you what Calvary did it whipped every devil it brought eternal life into the reach of every Christian you know what I say I say say what a prophet said about Calvary he said it's a place of trans it's a place of death it's a place of killing self- desires and receiving the revelation of who God is yes sir amen a disciple of Christ will take him to Christ and Christ will take him to Calvary that's the real thing I love what David says he said blessed be the Lord amen who daily Loth us with Benefits amen even the god of our Salvation now you all know that another word amen for benefit is privilege right amen and privilege is a special right it is an advantage it is an immunity granted or available amen only to a particular person or group it is a right it is an advantage it is an entitlement it is a Birthright it is freedom it is Liberty can I just take a moment and say something to you church it's time to remember the benefits listen it's time to remember the benefits you say benefits yes sir one benefit we we have amen is that we're not looking for but we have the revealed word can I say this we don't just have it amen but we are following it and you all know right now we're living in a nation where they're divided on who has the most privileges do the US citizens or the illegal immigrants or does this race or this denomination am amen does the lgbtqxyz p amen who has the most rights well let me as old as just a crazy spit and sweating preacher amen I could fix a problem in Washington here it is the Bride of Jesus Christ is the most privileged people on the face of the Earth it don't matter if you're white if you're black if you're red if you're yellow if you're rich if you're poor it don't make a bit of difference if your name is on the Lamb's Book of Life it was put there from before the foundation of the world if anybody got a liberty if anybody got an advantage if anybody got a freedom it's the Bride of Jesus Christ who has received the revelation of what Calvary did for her yes sir since the opening of those Seven Seals the Angels behind the mountain this has become a new book it's the thing that's been hid aen has become revealed as God promised are you ready for this and we are the privileged people well somebody put on your shout and shoes we are the privileged people amen that God has chosen of the Earth that we might see and understand these things which is not some mythical fleshly Mind of a person trying to make it up it's the word of God made manifest and proven that it's right yes sir proven not by science but by God well somebody shout I'm privileged you didn't think you were but I told you this morning you are you're privileged you got more rights you got more advantages come on you got more Liberties you got more entitlements you got more well I feel good this morning amen amen this message has come to open your eyes to the reality that you are a privileged group of people can I say this to you in an age that's full of guessing in an age that's full of Jeopardy in an age that's full of questions God has sent a message which has been the end of guess work can I say this we're no longer guessing to work we're no longer guessing about the godhead guessing about water baptism amen who who's getting baptized this morning amen I think it's you right buddy amen can I say this you are a privileged young man amen to be sitting in the house of God and hearing the truth on the water baptism the truth on the godhead listen you're not taking on the name of the church you're taking on the name of Jesus Christ and all Heaven is behind that name all the power of God is behind that name well sometimes I think we ought to remember what a glorious Revelation our water baptism brought to us it brought the authority of the name of God on the redeemed flesh of the human and put him in position to exercise the authority of the discipleship of Jesus Christ glory glory to God anybody been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ can I see your hand this morning you're not ashamed of the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen can I say this we welcome our brother this morning into the blessing of the water baptism of the name of the Lord Jesus Christ young man it's the greatest decision that you'll ever make in your life is to follow the name that demons have to bow at the spirits have to bow it's the greatest name to raise your family under is the name of Jesus Christ there's no name higher than the name of the Lord Jesus Christ it'll whip the devil anywhere anytime any place hey glory to God I'm talking about some disciples who have become living copies of the master who they're following yes sir you say well preacher you're getting away out there am I really am I really and then brother B stood there that day and he said there was that table up in the air and he said it was dancing around he said so I thought I'd just prove him something he said I looked at that table and I said in the name of the father in the name of the son in the name of the Holy Ghost let that table come down he said it just danced around he said I looked at it again he said in the name of the Holy Catholic Church let that table come down he said it just danced around he said I looked at it again I said in the name of the Holy Pope or in the name of Mary let that table come down he said it just danced around he said but then I realized that I was in position to show the Manifest sttion of the authority of the name of Jesus Christ he said I looked at that table and I said in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you let that table come down he said it failed so quick it like to broke the legs off of it well I don't know what's hanging over you and I don't know what Devil's trying to stop you but I stand here as a commission disciple of the Revelation and I say in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ come out of the people come away from the church chur of the Living God in the authority of the revealing of the son of man hallelujah hallelujah that complex is defeated in the name of Jesus Christ that condemnation it's defeated in the name of Jesus Christ don't you wear the guilt any longer don't you wear the shame any longer who the son has made free it's free indeed we're free to believe we're free to shout we're free to dance we're free free to Rejoice we're free to love God we're free to go in the Rapture hallelujah hallelujah guft work is over it's over look why we stand in Jeopardy every hour we're

sufferings being made conformable unto his death oh yeah I watch a prophet amen nice triy devil come on now now watch a prophet we are thankful for the faith the evidence something with us that tells

we've had for years the word of God but now we have the god of the word and he's right here amen living his word out well Church of the Living God let me say this plain as I know how Christians do not have to live guessing any longer listen I don't think we have to live guessing any longer we should be notified brother come among the church and said how many of you as Christians probably ever hand would go up see you're a Christian so if we're Christians I think we ought to kindly be notified ahead we don't just have to guess at it amen we are notified of what our destination will be glory to God we are notifi of what our destination will be can I say this to you there is going to be a Rapture anden you want to help me preach amen look at somebody next to you and say there's going to be a Rapture there's going to be a body change amen and we know that amen we know there's going to be a Rapture amen sister Roberta you've been shouting about it for years but there's going to be a reality amen all the shouting and all the believing God and all the writing those poems are going to come a reality to it there going to come a sweep over the Church of the Living God and in a few moments we're going to step from one dimension into another I'm not a crazy man I'm a Christian and I've been notified I ain't going to hell somebody asked me last night I think it was Josh He said what you going to preach in the morning after all this preaching it reminded me of a story I was down in a meeting one night we come out I think it was down in Georgia and they come out and they said they looked at me and brother looked at me he said after all them sermons what are you going to preach and another brother spoke up and he said well ain't nobody preached on Hell yet I looked over at him I

brother Ben Heaven it's a real place let me say to you tonight amen Heaven is a real place let me say this but the revelation of Heaven did not come into existence until the opening of those Seven Seals now come on somebody say well amen stay away from preaching that Rapture Amen brother Joel why would we stay away from preaching the Rapture you know why if we was a bunch of Pentecostals and we were preaching the Rapture brother Tim it would shut the meat and Plum down those people have all kinds of fear and all kinds of scare I don't know if I'm going to make it I don't know if I'm good enough amen but you watch an eagle meeting you watch a bride meeting amen you start preaching about the Rapture and you watch the praise going into another level you watch the shouting and the rejoicing you say preacher amen why does the preaching of this message take the Rapture oh God take the Rapture subject and move the church into a higher praise because we're not worshiping and believing under condemnation but a prophet has come among the church and said you are the sinless you are the Spotless you are the Justified bride of Jesus Christ it's as though you'd never even done it in the first place have we forgot who we are have we forgot we're not going back to some beerly amen ralistic elements of corruption we have come from the ch of God and the blood of Jesus Christ has broken the curse of sin off of Our Lives can I say it now Heaven is your home the Rapture is your transportation the future well I feel I feel like praising him listen you got the wrong guy amen I'll just stop and dance a minutes because I know where I come from I know the road I was on but God called me by the commitment in Mark 16 and anointed me to stand here this morning and tell you some

some good things the confusion is broken can I tell you some good things you can now go out yonder and fully believe God can I tell you some good things the message of the hour has revealed to you that your name was in the Lamb's Book of Life by the blood of Jesus Christ oh brother brother can I tell you some good things can I tell you that when Jesus was born you was with him when he walked on the shores of Galilee you was with him when he went to the Widow of Nam son you was with him when he healed bmus you was with him can I tell you some good things when he was crucified you was with him

he preached the Seven Seals and because I was there is why I'm here and because I'm here is why I'm going back there and there ain't no devil going to stop me now yes sir I'm carrying authoritative word now look when this authoritative word affects your life when this authoritative word affects your life you become a disciple of it you lo you lose everything you leave everything else brother Daniel to follow the revealed authorita word you become a mouthpiece for Vindicated word you become a voice for the voice of the word of God why because you're a disciple now listen how do you become a disciple you became a fully formed disciple of what you're following can I say this Lazarus in John chap 11 he was sick and he died and the Bible said that Jesus come and said these words he said now he's dead and they thought he was taken asleep but Jesus said he's dead for your sake and I'm glad I wasn't there brother Sean I'm going to go down there and see if I can get him up I'm going to go down there and see if I can say something loud enough to wake him up I'm going to see if the revealing of those seven Thunders will wake the bride up no he didn't walk down there under guesswork he walked down there and brother Miguel he said I go wake him brother find me one bit of guesswork in that statement find me one ounce of psychology in that statement find me one ounce of I hope I think I feel find me one evidence of it you won't find it because it's not there the only thing that's there is the authority of the name of Jesus Christ in the power of the resurrection and Jesus walked down there and the pr of God said he didn't say I'll go and see if I can I'll go and make a Triad it but I'll go and wake him for he knew come on disciples if you're going to be a disciple of the revealing of the son of man you got to stop walking with I think it'll work I hope it'll work I'm going to take a guess at it hey this is another meeting so I'm going to go and see if I can keep the victory this time no you are a disciple which means you are fully formed in the image of the one you're following and when he walked down there he said come out of the Grave Lazarus listen because God had showed him by Vision that Lazarus was going to come forth amen out of the Grave there wasn't no guesswork and any time that God shows a vision of what's going to happen it's going to be exactly the way if the vision's from God it just has to be let me just go ahead and drop this in here you have already been seen in a vision come on now amen can I show you something remember remember Friday night that Mark 16 came after the resurrection remember those words came after Jesus had lived died buried and raised again now watch Lazarus amen can I can I can I just can I just break something into to you you imagine Jesus Walks down there and here's a man fellowshipping maybe with Abraham with Ezekiel with Sarah with some of the old Patriarchs and here the Lord walks down there and brother said he had to say Lazarus because there was so much power and authority in that voice that if he would have just said come forth he said he would have called the entire graveyard forth so here I felt that one too Miguel are you hearing me here's Lazarus and Abraham and they're talking and they're fellowshipping and all of a sudden oh are you hearing me if he would have said come forth Abraham would have got Sarah and Lazarus and they would have all walked out of there but it wasn't time for a chance so he specifically reveals one name and says Lazarus come forth and the prophet of God said a body that had been laying there for 4 days he said death knew its master and Corruption knew its maker and he said life came back in that body and Lazarus caught up and he come walking out of the Grave can I tell you what Lazarus become he became a fully formed disciple of the resurrection and the life come on Church am me you imagine you imagine everybody wanted Lazarus around their place because if anybody could talk about believing for the impossible Lazarus could you imagine sitting around brother Sean amen amen you imagine sitting around talking with Lazarus and you tell Lazarus how about it bad day you had all these things are going on and Lazarus said well let me tell you I was dead and come back to life so no matter what you're going through I am a witness you imagine shaking hands with Lazarus outside the church you imagine what kind of services they had when Lazarus come to church because now we don't just have the word that he is the resurrection but now we have a fully formed disciple who is walking glory to God he is walking manifestation that God is a resurrection will devil hear me and hear me well this ain't a bunch of church members these are disciples who have been saved and they know God Saves they have been healed and they know God heals they've been delivered and they know God delivers they've been redeemed Brother Bruce and we know God redeems we ain't just church members we're [Music] disciples go tell Lazarus about your bad day right go Shake Lazarus hand out brother Jo brother Joel you imagine working with Lazarus you don't you imagine being on the job of Lazarus he is over there singing I'm going to [Music] rise he's over there talking about the goodness of God you know why because it's now become more than just a word it's become a manifested word it's now in the flesh of a human are you all hearing me are you hearing me you know why you're shouting like you're shouting is because what you've heard and what you've read has now come into your flesh and you're now walking with authority you're not guessing you're now knowing well I might as well say it amen when Lazarus got out of the Grave he did not just become a fully formed disciple of the Resurrection can I tell you what he become he become a fully formed disciple of praise and worship [Applause] well we might as well preach for here he become a fully formed disciple of what it means to praise God Lazarus has just been dead but he heard his name and he came out and brother Ben he was bound hand and foot he was bound over his mouth he was bound over his eyes come on somebody you know what the Bible says the Bible said he wanted to praise God amen amen I feel good right now amen I think I'm talking to some Lazarus here this morning who have come out of some situations you've come out of some dark days you've come out of some trials you've come out of some pressures hey and God brought you out but he didn't bring you out to be a statue he didn't bring you out to be some old cold ritualistic ungodly formal ritualistic Christian he brought you out to be a fully formed disciple so Jesus looked at Lazarus and he said Lazarus come forth Lazarus come forth Jesus said Lazarus Amen Let me let me see there stands Lazarus he's all tied up he said now Lord you've done too much for me I just want to praise you I just want to bless your name I just want to give you some worship but I'm all bound up now listen he was no longer bound I'm going somewhere he wasn't no longer bound in the grave he was bound in the clothes thank you Lord Jesus thank you my father he was no longer Bound in the grave he was bound in the clothes so the clothes he was wearing was a representation of where he had been but it wasn't take him to where he was ordained to go so he had to be loosed he had to be loosed come on church amen some of you all here this morning you got scars of your past you got situations over your life but can I say this to you by the grace of almighty God you're out of it you're out of it you're out of the dark days you're out of the confusing times you're out of the broken days can I say this to you you're out of it but if you're going

has to loose you brother Caleb he asked to loose You by something so what does he do in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the revelation of the son of man shall loose the church can I just break it down to you for a second Lazarus is bound At His Feet which you know what that means it means he can't dance no more come on now I know we got a little ritualistic and sophisticated and we label people a bunch of dancers amen but let me say this you can take my car you can take my house you can take everything I got but you will not take my praise you will not take my shout you will not take my dance you can criticize me you can mock me ridicule me put me on the internet do what you want to but you will never silence the praise of Andrew bu because I know

your dance back I know some of you don't like it but I'm sorry I got the microphone you need to get your dance back and you know what I found out I'm just feeling good enough to preach right now I have found out that nine times out of 10 when somebody gets to criticizing somebody that's dancing the only reason they're criticizing is because they're jealous the only reason you're critical is because you're jealous but let me say this don't be critical come over and join me you tell me I ain't got a reason to dance I got a little boy standing there amen watching me preach this gospel I shouldn't be standing here I should have been another statistic but God gave me a beautiful wife and he gave me a beautiful child and he give me friends around the world and a mama that loves me if anybody got a right to praise I got a right to praise he revealed the seals he called my name he said I was with him I'll always be with him he redeemed me he justified me you ain't going to take my praise Brother Bruce they ain't going to take our praise we done been through the fire we done been through the loose our feet loose our feet and let us dance a little while let us just get out there

and I send him back to hell where he come from bring the dance back bring the shout back bring the praise back remember we used to preach stimulation of Revelation before we got scared of it but we got a little scared of it and we quit preaching it because this guy did that and that guy did that well I'm not a chicken Hallelujah I'm an eagle I'm not scared enough in a prophet talk I'm not scared

people come on he can't shake hands with certain people CU 20 years ago they offended him 30 years ago she looked at her wrong and but Loose them and let him go can I say this you can't wear bitterness to the marriage supper you can't wear grudges to the marriage supper you got to have your clothes [Music] changed it's not the authority of guessing it's the authority of knowing can I say what Jesus said he said it came to pass when Jesus sended his says the people were astonished at his Doctrine now watch this for he taught them as one having Authority and not as the scribes look at this word having it is to have to hold in the hand brother I film this about 2 o00 this morning about about shouting my shoe heels off are you ready for this having is in the sense of [Applause] wearing so if you have the authority that that becomes your clothes you're no longer walking as one talking about it holding it in the hand but you are now walking you are now wearing the authority you all remember last night where the wind will come over here and he got underneath that white wig remember that amen amen he got underneath that white wig and he said this is my headship and I'm its body come on church are you with me now amen where do you wear clothes you don't wear clothes on your head you wear clothes on your body come on now and the clothing of this body is the headship of Jesus Christ said if I'm a Christian and I'm filled with the spirit I am wearing the testimony of Jesus Christ and his resurrection that he's the same yesterday today and forever then don't you let any devil try to push you around and say you don't do this and you don't do that you do do it come on church when you leave these meetings don't you let some devil push you back in the depression and push P you back into fear and push you back into broken fellowship and push you back into false Doctrine you are standing in the wars of the word of God stand on your stand stand in your position as a Son of God yes sir we have authority by the resurrection of Jesus Christ and his promised word who are you this morning who are you can I tell you who you are you are the Bride of Jesus Christ we're not in the first AG we're not in the second age hallelujah we're not in the third age we are in the seventh age under the seventh seal come on now where did he say in the seventh seal the bride now has the garments she now has the garments to prepare for the supper can you give me Isaiah 4 chapter chapter 4 and verse one amen I want to show you something here we now have the garments what does that say and in that day said and women shall take a hold of one man who is that one man the Lord Jesus Christ now watch this and we'll say we will eat our own bread and we will wear our own apparel only let us be called by that name to take away our reproach so that come on now amen listen now amen they did not amen they did not want amen his they wanted his authority by his name but they didn't want his clothes are you with me they wanted the privilege of the authority of the name of the one who could remove their reproach but they didn't want to wear his clothes in other words they looked at him and said we'll be baptized in your name but we'll still cut our hair and we'll still wear our makeup and we'll still wear our high heill shoes and we'll still paint our nails and we'll still wear our shorts oh come on somebody we might as well preach amen we'll take your Authority but we won't take your [Applause] clothes y'all know where I'm at amen there's been a lot of hirelings that's got these message books in their offices come on a amen oral Robertson I don't mean to call names but Oral Roberts had it in his library and TD Jake was said to have had it in his Library AA Allen was said to said to have it in his do you know records show amen that Billy Graham took the books of William brandham and read them many times are you hearing me they wanted the authority of the revealing of the son of man but they didn't want to change their clothes they wanted to still wear their denominational guard they wanted to still wear titles they wanted to come on church but God sent a message come on and underneath this message you receiv received a change of clothes can I say something to you we don't want you we will eat our own bread so in other words we won't eat what a prophet already said we'll go get our own interpretation of what he said it we'll go out there and say we can't clo the bride age and you can't preach adoption this way and you can't teach the gifts this way well you're looking at one preacher and has got the guts to say if a prophet taught it I'm going to say it regardless of who likes it or don't we'll eat our own bread we'll wear our own clothes just give us your Authority now can I tell you where that attitude leads you it leads you to Luke 15 where there was a prodical son who left his inheritance but can you give me Luke chapter 15 and verse number 22 but the father said to his servants you know what he said he said bring forth the best robe come on now amen listen you've been out there in the hog pin you've been out there in the mud slop you cannot come in my house amen whereing where you been you can't come in this house where and what youve been wearing you got to change your clothes so somebody go get the best robe and put it on him and put a ring on his hand amen shoes on his feet come on Church you know what happened are you ready for this amen he changed his clothes before he ate his supper because look at the next verse

another one give me Revelation 19 let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife hath made herself ready give me verse eight and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and watch for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints look what a prophet of God said he said let me take the clothes of the word and dress his bride in the clo of the word for his righteousness that's what the church is today what we need is just striping off of all these little Cults and things and be dressed in the righteousness of Jesus Christ listen and be arrayed in find linen clean and watch for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints are you ready for this you got to change your clothes and then right blessed are they which are called unto the married supper of the Lamb well I tell you this morning I'm done you're looking pretty good this morning you know why because you're dressed for supper I said you're dressed for supper you have been clothed in the revelation of Jesus Christ come on you can go to the table and you can eat like a son you can drink like a son you can believe like a child of God the clothes have been [Music] changed can I say it you like this can I say it do you like this not in our own abilities but in the ability of the Lord Jesus Christ I leave you this when I come to that Gap along with you Believers I'm so happy to know I'm not going there with this listen yeah I picked that devil up a prophet of God Tau against High Hill shoes and he said you can't Walk This Way in that kind of shoe he said she looked at me and said I can he said but when I saw her she was going off somebody say well what's the big deal about wearing shorts we're just boys I'll tell you the big deal about it is a prophet said it's a cissified spirit well that devil shouldn't have pushed I'll push back we got a change our clothes come on now y'all imagine showing up at a at a at a fine dinner and a seven course meal in a pair of blue jeans with holes and a t-shirt ain't been washed in two months you're not dressed for the you're not dressed for the place but you change your clothes and then you eat the supper oh God I wish I was a preacher right now you change your clothes and then you say what are you saying I wish I had the ability to get it across to you to see you got to change your clothes you got to quit wearing the clothes of the world you got to quit got to change your clothes now watch this because if you don't change your clothes you're going to have trouble at the River Jordan I'm going there confessing knowing I'm a sinner and knowing this that I want to wrap myself in the Robes of his righteousness with this testimony that I know him in the power of his resurrection that when he calls from the dead I want to come out what are you saying I'm saying we're dressed we're dressed for worship we're dressed for praise we're dressed for the dance oh God I I I I'm going to say it I had a I had a great grandmother bust her heart she was a she was a lovely lady amen she loved to dance so I mean I mean brother both she loved to dance and I'll just say this it wasn't dancing me and you do she loved to dance when she was younger she loved to go them dances Nanny she got she got Alzheimer's and she got older and I never forget one day I went in the back room and she' just sitting

and he redeemed me and he sanctify me you talk about dancing listen when I couldn't get to the dance the dance come to me I got my dancing shoes on I got my dancing clothes on it's the Robes of his righteousness [Applause] come on Church you ain't clothed in a man's idea you're clothed in the dancing clothes of redemption and I know people don't like that dancing word but I'm going to say it again cuz it's still in the message and I'm closing on this okay can I say this when you got the dance in you it don't matter where you're at you can't hide yourself from it Hallelujah no when you got the dance in you it don't matter where you're at you can't hide it from the dance can I prove it to you by the message prophet of God said there was a woman who had a high society tea party and she said she had all of her he said she had all of her fancy people coming over and they was all dressed up they were they were dressed for the occasion okay but here was her old Holiness grandfather and he was one of them shouting hollering tongue talking spitting sweating crazy Believers she said now I got to do something with Daddy I'll put him up in the attic and I'll take his Bible away Judah I'll take his Bible away I'll put him up there in the attic and he won't be able to shout he won't be able to dance he won't be able to praise God so they're down there drinking their tea and and eating their own food and talking about their doctrines and their Creeds and and how they follow this bishop and they follow this idea and they're just having a real nice fine denominational time but then all of a sudden they start hearing some stomping they start hearing some stomping they start hearing some shaking they start hearing some noise she said oh dear God she ran upstairs and she opened the door brother Daryl and there was her little old daddy he was just in there dancing and praising God she walked over there she said Daddy what's wrong with you you're up here in the Attic you ain't even got a Bible what are you shouting about he said honey I'm so sorry he said but you put me up here in this attic and I got to reading over here in this geography book about the sea she said Daddy what are you shouting about the sea he said I got to reading about the sea how they've been trying to find the bottom of the sea she said Daddy what are you shouting about that for he said because the Bible says listen when you are the word you can't hide the word from the word you'll find the word in a tree you'll find the word in a geography book you'll find the word on the radio when you are the word the word will come to the word and there will be a manifestation of the promise behind that word brother Bo brother Bo she said said this she said what are you shouting about he said I was reading about the bottom of the sea and they've yet to find the bottom of the sea she said so let me ask you why you shouting he said because the Bible said that my Lord Jesus he took my sins and he threw them in the bottom of the sea she said what are you shouting about that for he said honey if they ain't found the bottom of the sea that means my sins they're still falling Hallelujah my sins they're still falling and I'm rising what are you saying I'm saying you change your clothes you're ready for Rapture you're ready for supper your sins are in the sea of forgetfulness your
