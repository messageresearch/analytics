amen let's bow our heads together for a word of prayer maybe you'd have a special need you'd like us to remember but we have uplifted hand amen heavenly father we're so thankful to be in your presence this morning to know that you are here your lord not only because we can feel your presence but also because of the promise of your word two or three are gathered together in my name lord we're here in your name today your name has been revealed to us by the scriptures here in your name gathered and you promised you would be here too so we're thankful for that lord i pray that you would move in a miraculous way this morning pray lord that you would use the vacancy created by the weakness of my body or didn't speak directly to the people lord maybe there'd be someone here and they lifted their hands with different needs lord i don't know what they are you know lord and may you meet those needs all the preaching of the word is going forth lord while we worship at the end at the baptismal service lord whatever we do today lord while we're doing it may there just be a miraculous meeting of those needs lord we pray we thank you and we'll give you the glory and the honor for it in jesus name amen amen love the lord this morning matthew chapter 3 and verse 1. i want to speak to you this morning on scriptural water baptism i've had it on my heart for a while and i thought i'd take the opportunity this morning since uh madison madeleine he's going to be baptized maddie's going to be baptized oh where's she at she's going to get me in trouble again but we're so we're so happy to for that today and if there's anyone else that would like to be baptized there's water in the tank to do that but i'd like to talk to you about that this morning and like i said it's been on my heart for a while because it's an important step and maybe some of you that have been baptized for many years and you're christians you say well there's nothing there for me but i want you to listen closely because i believe there is something here because baptism begins our walk with christ and we continue that walk and the yielding that we do in baptism the fact that we we surrender ourselves to the water we also have to continue to surrender ourselves to christ to the word of god the rest of our lives one day we'll surrender ourselves in such a way that we'll change from these vile bodies into a body like his glorious body isn't that wonderful amen and so it's just the christian life is a surrendered life that's what we do we don't live our own that's a and that's a in this world that we live in i don't want to start preaching before i read but in the world that we live in what a a difference between the christian and the world because the world says be yourself do what you want to do live for yourself live for your own pleasure and christ says take up your cross yes and follow me but i promise you if you take up your cross you'll find out who you really are amen amen matthew chapter three and verse one in those days came john the baptist preaching in the wilderness of judea and saying repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand this is e that was spoken of by the prophet isaiah saying the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the lord make his paths straight and the same john had his ramen of camel's hair and a leather and girdle about his loins and his meat was locust and wild honey and went out to him jerusalem and all judea and all the region round about jordan were baptized of him in jordan confessing their sins but when he saw many of the pharisees and sadducees come to his baptism he said unto them oh generation of vipers who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come notice he pointed out the self-righteous among them he said bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance and think not to say within yourselves we have abraham to our father i say unto you that god is able of these stones to raise up children unto abraham and now also the axe is laid into the root of the trees therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire he said i indeed baptize you with water unto repentance but he that cometh after me is mightier than i whose shoes i am not worthy to bear he shall baptize you with the holy ghost and with fire whose fan is in his hand and will thoroughly purge his floor and gather his wheat into the garner but he will burn up the chaff unquenchable fire don't you want to be found among the wheat amen god bless you you could be seated i think one of the most memorable things that we can do as parents is to see our children baptized it's a longing in the heart of every parent no matter how old your children are brother stewart's going to be baptizing matty today after the service this morning and we'll just go directly into that service at the end of this one and just go directly over there so there'll be no you'll be able to come and then if you don't want to stay for dinner or whatever you can you can leave after that but uh i've baptized many folks and i've baptized some are still christians today i baptized some who are in glory i baptized some and i remember their baptism as a turning point in their life i'm always thankful for that that someone i remember sister bowers passed away this week i remember i baptized her son when he was probably in his 40s and suddenly he turned to god or started coming to church and and he was baptized and just a few months later he uh his life ended and and we don't know what what tomorrow holds and so i was thankful to be able to do that others some are born again and you see their life changed before or before being baptized and then they're baptized and others are born again at the baptism and have an experience with that and some are baptized and many years later they're born again and some feel the need to be re-baptized because they felt that they should have been more serious the first time and it is a serious time it's an important step regardless of when you're baptized or what age you are it's an important step but it's one which we are commanded to do it's not an optional thing and and so if you know to do good and don't do it that's iniquity and and so it's the step it's a sign it doesn't save you but it's a sign that you're surrendering your life to christ i want to look at the scriptures today and see what scriptural water baptism is and we know that the scripture is the bible nothing else can we say amen to that this morning are you awake yet this morning i know it's cloudy outside and it's been rainy but scriptural is bible and it's not bible plus my opinion yeah right right it's not bible plus tradition yeah right it's not bible plus whatever i think about it it's bible this is our only book brother branham put it this way he said there's been many books written philosophers has raised and felt he said but there's only one book that shall tell you who you are you want to know who you are this morning you want to really know who you are he said there's one book that'll tell you who you are where you come from where you're going and that's the bible yes he said that's the only book of all the fine books you we have you could trash them every one that's pretty strong isn't it he said you could trash him everyone this is the truth anything contrary to this is not right and we've got to stand on that because if we don't stand on that we have nothing yeah right if the bible may or may not be true then i may or may not be saved that's right yes sir that's right right if it may or may not be true then i may or may not be a christian i may or may not be going to heaven but because i believe the bible is true and i don't rest in emotion i don't rest in sensation i don't rest in what what happened my particular experience you understand my experience may be different from someone else's but that's not where my rest is that's not what i put my my my uh my my faith in but it's because the bible says yes that if i would believe on the lord jesus christ and repent and be baptized i would be filled with the holy ghost i'm resting on that amen and then that happened to me and it and it was just a sign to me that the word was true yeah right right but it doesn't regardless of my own experience the bible is true and i i hope we get that this morning the bible is true about baptism that's right the bible is true about the oneness of the godhead the bible is true about whether or not we should have church whether or not we should worship god the bible is true all others be alive something has to be true if you've ever had a job you know that somebody's got to have the final word and that's the word of god and the message of the hour and we believe the message of the hour the message of the hour is the light on the scripture we were in a dark room of denominationalism but there was a man christ jesus who can come and turn on the light and when he did the light of the hour illuminated the bible we would know what it said and it brought us back to restore us back to the scriptures now john the baptist was the first one to baptize to repentance and the word baptized means it's literally to immerse the greek word is baptizo which is to immerse it's if someone says well i was sprinkled and they sprinkled me with water and they baptized me they didn't baptize you it's literally impossible because you have to be immersed to be baptized it's to dip in the water or to immerse in the water to cover uh with the water and john the baptist was the first one to do that you notice he does it in the river jordan the bible tells us he baptized where there was much water because he had to go down he went down into the water and and the water had to cover the person that was being baptized and so scriptural baptism is is immersing now it is an outward act that's done in commemoration of the death burial and resurrection of the lord jesus i want us to look at this this morning because it identifies us as an individual with the resurrection of christ we must be identified that way now if you go to romans chapter 6 if you want to turn there romans chapter 6 and we'll read verses 1 through 13 you'll find that romans chapter 6 and in chapter 5 paul is telling them about grace and he's telling them that he indicts in the book of romans he indicts the world for the condition that they're in he makes the argument that even if you're not a christian even if you're not a jew just by being born nature itself ought to uh to show you that there's a god he makes that argument and he tells about all the horrible things and he goes through he talks about faith and about grace and he makes the point that where sin abounds grace super abounds he said grace much more abounds and so we believe that today but then he goes on to say that it doesn't stop there because there's something that has happened to us that grace when it picks us up it doesn't leave us as we are and i would say you know many churches today say come as you are i would say that's true but don't stay as you are because the bible says that you can be changed you can be a new creature in christ jesus if we don't teach that if we don't believe that we don't believe anything else and so we do we accept all people and they come as they are but i believe that if a person no matter what they were listen to me no matter what the depths of sin have been that they've sunk to that person can be raised in newness of life listen the body of jesus in the tomb was completely dead think about that for a minute completely dead and you were buried with him by baptism into his death that was completely dead and so when the body was completely dead that body could not raise itself up that's right i hope you hear me today but the spirit that was in it hallelujah come and raise that body up in newness of life and if you have the spirit of christ if you receive the holy ghost the body of sin is dead what that means is you don't have to pay any more the penalty was death he paid you he paid the price of death you don't have to pay for your sin but you do have to be buried with him right so instead of paying for your own sin you identify with his payment you're buried with him in baptism and you are raised in newness of life yes so you're not the same person that you were right so the christianity that we teach and we believe in makes you different it doesn't make you odd or weird it it makes you forgiven it doesn't make you walk around with a long face all the time criticizing people no it gives you the joy of the lord come on that's right right it doesn't make you different and your facial features are different in your in your height or your weight but it makes you different where it matters in your soul and then that expresses itself in your body so paul says what shall we say then if grace super abounds what shall we say shall we continue in sin that grace may abound he said god forbid how shall we that are dead to sin live any longer there and notice his argument he said knowing not that so many of us that were baptized into jesus christ were baptized into his death right right baptism identifies us with the death of christ you say i don't want to be identified with death but unless you're identified with death to the old life that's right you can never be identified with life in christ right so he says if the baptism that you were baptized into his death therefore we are buried with him oh i love that we are buried with him by baptism into death like as christ was raised up from the dead but the glory of the father even so we also should walk in newness of life for if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection now notice paul's line of thinking he says now if you went down with him if you were buried with him and like i said there's many that are baptized that have turned away there are some that are good christians today but what happened they did not the symbol was there but not the reality yes right but if you ever get the reality of being dead with him when you're baptized you're baptized into his death then you're dead with him and if you're dead with him amen listen now if you're dead with him you can't by your own works be raised that's right the body is dead right you're dead you can't even your children i think can understand this this morning and i hope that you do because several of our children are old enough are getting to that age to be baptized and some of them have already been baptized but when you're baptized you're baptized into the death of christ you're identifying yourself oh my you're right you're a death to your own thinking death to your own ways death to the old man death to you of the old sin death to the things you used to do death to the rebellion that indwells the human being yes are you hearing me today you're saying i'm i'm dying to the adamic nature that rebellion against god i'm dying to that rebellion and i'm being raised in newness of life hallelujah so now he said we should walk in newness of life for if we've been planted together in the likeness of his death we shall be also yes in the likeness of his resurrection knowing this that our old man is crucified with him i tell you what that old man deserved it wasn't nothing good in him paul said it this way he said he said who should deliver me from the body of this death it's a it's a canker it's there's nothing good in my old man right i'm not talking about my father i'm talking about this the old man is the flesh nothing good in the flesh but our old man is crucified with him hey man put to a cruel death that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin now is it possible to it's possible to make a mistake sure we don't serve sin when we make a mistake we make it right that's right because we still and you understand you're being redeemed there will come a day when you'll never make another mistake because you'll be in a perfect body that day is not today right so just go ahead and give up on that idea well i'm going to be perfect somehow before the rapture no the moment the rapture happens that's when you're going to be perfect we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye but i like what brother stewart preached about wednesday night because we are we do need to come to a maturity as the bride of christ beyond just being perfected by the blood but yet there has to come a maturity in us that we reckon ourselves dead and we walk in newness of life and that's what paul is saying as well he said don't stop at baptism but identify yourself with the death burial and resurrection of christ yes now it says we his force should not serve sin for he that is dead is freed from sin so sin is presented as the task master as the slave driver and we were the slave but now we're freed from sin he said now if we be dead with christ we believe that we should we shall also live with him now what does that mean it means i can walk away without that sin being able to force me to do what i didn't want to do right i think there's very few people that want to smoke that's right but it's it's a it's a desire and it becomes even a physical thing a desire but sin has no more dominion over you paul says because you're not under the law you're under grace that's right law and your body tells you you don't you have to have that but but christ says you don't right you don't have to do and so you're not bound to do the things that you that you don't want to do yes amen i don't think any christian wants to sin wants to do wrong there's lots of people who aren't christians that don't want to do wrong but they can't help it many of them are caught up in in drugs and alcohol and all kinds of different things and they want to do what's right but they just can't help they just can't help but do what they do but i'm here to tell you this morning there is a blood there is a christ there is a resurrected christ a life that you can walk in where you can be completely free are you hearing me this morning completely free not partially free not free during certain times of the week not free during church time but free all of the time yes sir so he says you reckon yourself to be dead to sin but alive unto god through jesus christ our lord i think i skipped a couple verses but he said let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body that you should obey it in the lust or the desires thereof either yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin but yield yourselves unto god there's the christian life i hope the kids hear me and the young people and the adults the christian life is yielding yes and when we protect our self-interest above all else we're not yielding yes when we make ourselves bigger than the word we're not yielding when we when we think that well you know today it's like anything that you say that you disagree with me on is a personal attack against me that's the way the world feels and you can't you can't disagree with me because then you do violence to me that's wrong because i'm not right just because i think yeah yeah there you go right just because i am doesn't mean i'm right that's right just because i was born the bible teaches the very opposite you were born in sin shaping and iniquity so no one here was born right we were born wrong and we're made right by the blood of jesus christ but there's such a freedom in that because what that means is you know if you just have to be what you are and they say today that well if you're if you're a homosexual if that's if you you're attracted to men that that's got to be what you are that's just you were born that way and you just gotta you gotta present that way and you'll change into a woman or do something like that but the bible tells us differently you were that way because of a fallen nature you were that way that doesn't mean that you'll be lost but you gotta change that you can't do it on your own you've got to come to christ and if you come to christ let him take that out of you be buried with it by baptism into his death and be raised in newness of life so we don't just express what we are yes and that's why we let this is why we let the bible dictate what we do and where the bible tells us how we should dress and what we should do and how we should act we do that right and that's not a law that's not someone standing up here and me checking everybody to go out and say well you can't come in unless you dress a certain way it's not that at all but we believe the bible and we're yielded to the bible we want others to yield to the bible but i can't do that for you right i'm not going to treat you wrong because you don't yield but you need to yield if you want to if you want to be identified in his resurrection yes you need to yield to his death yes so now he said yield your members as instruments of righteousness unto god so in other words we're following christ we're following you hear that a lot anymore disciples christ followers yes and you we hear that a lot anymore and we are following christ yeah right right but we're following him not just to church not just to where we can hang a cross up in our window not just where we can say god sent a prophet but we're following christ in the walk that he walked yes follow him to the cross follow him to the grave yes are you with me now yes and follow him to the sky yes baptism is the beginning of that journey brother branham says this he said notice when elisha following elijah and you'll find that in in first kings chapter two i believe when elisha when elijah is about to be taken up and elisha is following elijah he said for a reason right he said where did he take him to jordan to ramos gilead up to the school of prophets and down to jordan so he made steps along the way he said that's the way he takes you through justification sanctification and dying out to receive life he said not to a denomination or some cream but to death to your spirit so you can be born again and so elisha in in spite of the fact that elijah told him to stay here elisha followed him in spite of that and he followed his he followed him because he wanted to go through the same path to take the same journey because if he took the same journey then the tower that was on elijah could come on him oh i'm here to tell you church that we cannot listen we cannot live as christians in the day that we live in but unless the power the spirit that was on jesus christ comes back on us yes you can't do it on your own so what do we have to do we got to go with with him to bethel go with him to ramos gilead go with him to justification follow him to sanctification following to the grave following the baptism and following across the river and when you get to the other side you can say where is the god of elijah yeah he's right here are you with me now yes i've had a hard week joel leave me alone joel sits over there and judges the way my caller turns up and bless his heart i'm gonna do that to you tonight i'm gonna sit right there aren't you glad aren't you glad that though we're not perfect we can still follow christ brother brown said we follow jesus to his death burial and baptism death burial and resurrection rather he said through baptism isn't that a powerful thought yes he said we believe him we're to die out to the things of the world confess that we're nothing baptized in his name buried with him in baptism raised with him in resurrection our spirits live up above the things of the world he said then we're in christ i pick on joel and these kids up here because i can't see the rest of you with my glasses off scriptural baptism what is it it's in the name of jesus of the lord jesus christ yes that's right right matthew 28 19 let's look at that it says go you therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son of the holy ghost now if you're baptized in trinitarian circles today they'll baptize you in the name of the father and in the name of the son and in the name of the holy ghost but that's not what it says right it says baptize them in the name of the father of the son of the holy ghost now that's into the name if you go back in the original into the name we're baptized into the name we've been baptized into christ baptized into the name not names now brother random says this he said in the name of the father son and holy ghost he said there's no such thing as the name of the father because father is not a name it's a title that's right no such thing as the name of son because son is a title no such thing as name of the holy ghost that's what he is yes sure all right so if i told you to baptize in the name of the pastor the dad and the husband all right there's lots of dads and husbands here but one pastor right you would baptize in my name i would hope i didn't get my thought across very well say now i baptize you in the name of the pastor and the name of the dad and the name of the husband but you could say all of that by just saying ben pruitt that's right right that's my name now ephesians 3 14 tells us for this cause i bow my knees unto the father of our lord jesus christ of whom now watch the whole family yes if you're not if you don't believe in his name and you're not baptized in his name you can't be in the family what are you saying of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named yes right is named who who are they named the lord jesus christ he actually says in the father of our lord jesus christ now watch jesus said in john 5 43 i am come in my father's name right he said you receive me not if another shall come in his own name him will you will receive and so there's no other name the scripture tells us for salvation or healing look at acts chapter 4 and verse 10 he said be it known unto you all and all the people of israel but that by the name of jesus christ of nazareth whom you crucified whom god raised from the dead even by him that this man stand here before you whole you want healing you have to be healed in his name you're healed in his name you're saved in his name there is no other name right now he says he says even by him does this man stand before you hold this is the stone which was said it not of you builders which has become the head of the corner neither is there salvation in any other for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved what name the name of jesus christ of nazareth yes that's what he says now colossians 3 17 whatsoever you do so i'm preaching in his name yeah right you're going to church in his name we're going to eat in his name a little while later yeah right everything we do we in word or deed do all in the name of the lord jesus giving thanks to god and the father by him all new testament baptisms were in the name of jesus christ yes all without exception there was no other name used by the apostles other than the name of jesus christ yes the jews in acts 2 38 peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost the promise is unto you and to your children to all that are far off even as many as the lord our god shall call so he says be baptized in the name the samaritans in acts 8 16 the bible says that they had not yet had the spirit fallen upon them but they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus that was samaritans gentiles in acts chapter 10 and verse 48 he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the lord and pray they him to terry certain days so they were baptized in the name and peter said the name is the name of the lord jesus christ of jesus christ now and brother branham said you could use jesus christ or the lord jesus christ he uses the lord jesus christ because it tells us who he is our lord yes right because there there might be someone else named jesus or even jesus christ but he is the lord jesus christ now paul in first corinthians 1 he goes into that we don't have time to go into that today but he said you weren't baptized in my name i know there's there's elements today that would baptize the name of william branham it's it's antichrist yes right right you weren't baptizing william branham's name because you weren't saved in william branham's name right you're not baptizing the name of a pastor you're baptized in the name of jesus christ and it's more than just the words that we say but you're baptized under the authority of christ right now so they were baptized those who were baptized differently had to be re-baptized because you remember john we started with john john went and baptized but he baptized them to repentance he couldn't baptize in the name of jesus christ because christ had not yet come and the death burial and resurrection had not yet taken place and so there were some disciples of john who remained disciples of john and had not yet heard of this baptism in the name of jesus christ in acts chapter 19 verse 1 it says it came to pass that while apollos was that corinth paul passed through the upper coast and came to ephesus and find certain disciples and he said unto them have you received the holy ghost since you believed and they said unto him we have not so much as heard whether there be any holy ghost and he said unto them unto what then were you baptized and they said unto john's baptism so they would not have been baptized in the name of jesus christ he said then said paul john verily baptized with the baptism of repentance saying unto the people that they should believe on him which should come after him that is on christ jesus when they heard this they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus yes you would think that if every time in the scripture that it was done that it would be done in that name that that's the way people would do it today yet most denominational christians do not do that today well what happened well it's the word plus somebody's idea yeah that's right and again this isn't difficult you don't have to take brother brandon's word on this yes you don't have to take my word on it you just look at the scripture right because they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus so if we want to if baptism is so important to us it begins our our walk with christ our newness of life it puts us identifies us with the death burial and resurrection of christ then we want to be baptized correctly yes right and want to stay as close to the scripture as we can and so that's why we do it the way that we do immersed in water and baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ now when paul laid his hands upon them the holy ghost came on them and they spake with tongues and prophesied so baptism is not the end but baptism is a start and if you're baptized correctly you are a candidate then for the holy ghost and galatians 1 and 8 tells us that though we are an angel from heaven preaching the other gospel unto you and that which we have preached unto you let him be accursed i've had many people come to me and try to tell me that it's some other name or some other way or some other we were wrong about this if you're not an angel from heaven or paul you don't even fit in this scripture but he said even if an angel came you ain't no angel said let him be accursed yes scriptural baptism and put it in the common vernacular there scriptural baptism is essential i want to get to this because i know there's some things that we have to do in the church are you still with me this morning i know it's a little bit different and uh for me i i've been a little bit under the weather and i thought well maybe we'll just teach out of the scripture today and i'll try not to get too excited maybe i'll be okay i'm not sick where i can hurt you it's just the allergies really get me down every year about this time and and so i'm just kind of pushing my way through it you all just the faster you amen the faster i'll get through it so now baptism is essential now we were left with three outward ordinances as a church that we had to do baptism communion and foot washing look it was so essential to them look at the story we just read paul come to them and he said you've got to be baptized not just baptized but baptized correctly that's right right if you want to receive the holy ghost you've got to follow him in baptism so it's an essential thing baptism communion and foot washing that's the only outward ordinances now i i may hurt your feelings a little bit he didn't leave us so many tapes to listen to that would be an outward ordinance to the church he didn't even say read so many scriptures right right he didn't say get on your app and and and and have this little time with god every day and that's a good thing i want you to do that yeah right if you've got an app that helps you or some way of meditation or something but that wasn't the ordinance he left us yes say well i get on the internet and i watch my favorite preacher and i get on there and i watch them and and i'm overjoyed by the service and i listen to the sermon i must be a christian but have you done the things that god told you to do right because that's what makes us a christian is our yielding to christ is our yielding to the word so these things have to be done yeah there's no alternatives to it brother branham tells us there's a baptismal service following this one he said if anyone here that has not been baptized in the name of our lord jesus christ let me say to you as god's servant baptism is essential to salvation no it's not salvation but it's essential to salvation he said he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved now if you haven't been baptized in the name of our lord jesus christ you believed on him and confessed your sins come now forward after this service and you can be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sins now he also taught us communion and foot washing our essentials i want to talk to some of you have been in church for a while yeah you realize that's not optional right communion and foot washing it's not optional now he didn't tell us how many times to do it right yeah early church he did it every week he met every week but we don't do that we do it every every other month i believe it's a schedule that we're on now because there's no scripture for how often right yeah right but you've got to do it and i know christians who have never washed saints feet message believers who have never taken communion and i have to tell you you are not with the word of god not following christ right you can't be right you're actually actively denying the word by not doing what god told you to do yeah and it's a very simple thing right it's not difficult but we make it difficult because we build up things in our mind well i'm not worthy well if you're not worthy are you a christian if you're a christian you'll say well i've made a mistake since i've been a christian repent of it [Music] that's all it takes but it is essential to your christian walk you can't be as good a christian i will say this i don't believe a christian will if you're a real christian i don't believe that you will remain in a condition where you have where you never wash feet you never take communion and you never were baptized that's getting kind of there you said well well we do that and again it doesn't save you but if we want to obey the simple command of the word how are we ever going to receive the holy ghost right yes and so brother branham said i might explain he said as i said a few moments ago he said the thing that god left for us to do water baptism one article communion that's two and if you want to find that well we read the communion scripture the communion scripture is first corinthians chapter 11. the scripture for foot washing is saint john 13. and if you want to find that you go back and read that he says happier you if you do it he leaves that with us to do and so he said that's true god is perfected and three feet washing is the third he said we remember that years later even in the bible some people try to say it's not necessary yeah he said certainly i don't mean to say that people's feet need washing that isn't it maybe theirs did not either but it was an act of humility it's an act of doing just as essential as water baptism because he said here that i've given you an example that you should do to each other as i've done to you i know there are some people that get feeble in their body where they can't come to church or maybe they get to the point where they can't physically wash feet and i believe god the blood of jesus christ is what saves us right god understands that but if you can and don't god knows that too right and we find ourselves in rebellion against god so we don't want to do that do we rebellion against god doesn't go well ask the sodomites a rebellion against god goes ask israel how rebellion against god goes when they wouldn't receive him when he come to them and he wept over jerusalem they wouldn't receive him and he said he said i would have hovered over you like a hen over a chicken he said but you would not ask them how that went yes when a few years later titus destroyed jerusalem we don't want to be found in rebellion against god now and again i don't say that to scare you you've got to do it because you have the love of jesus christ in your hearts all right if you love the word then you'll you'll come to christ right he'll do these things but people will tell me today and satan gets in the middle of that and and today we have streaming and i just want to address that quickly because we have people that stream the services i know there's some that do that exclusively and we have people that do that are watching right now that are our streamers of our services that don't live too far to come to church and i'm glad that they do that ideally you would have a church in your neighborhood that you could go to church at right the idea is not to build this one into a mega church the idea is if we get too many people to start another one right where i'm not the pastor but god raises up a pastor you understand that's the idea of that's the new testament idea it's not to just build this together but people stream and i know people do it overseas we've got people overseas that watch our services i want our services to be open but that is not a replacement for the things that you can only do in the church that's right right now i could wash my my wife's feet at home and there's a doctrine going around now that you can do communion foot washing by yourselves at home well for single people that's difficult and even if you could there's no humility in it right i mean i can wash my own feet don't take no humility for that you see how by our traditions we destroy the the word of god yes sir right the whole purpose of it the bible said the purpose of it was humility how can we do that by ourselves okay well i'll just serve myself communion listen i believe again that if there was somebody who could not get to a church that was stuck in alaska somewhere in the jungles of africa could not get to church and they took the communion and broke the bread if they did it correctly i believe god would honor that but if there is any way that you could have went to church and you didn't go to church and you served yourself communion you went against god go look at the communion scripture first corinthians 11 see how many times paul says when you come together right four or five times in that scripture he says when you come together right now when you do it at home and and listen to a tape man i got to get off of this now look he said i've given you an example that you should do to others i've done to you he said we find out in the scripture a widow could not be brought in amongst the people unless she had lodged strangers had washed the feet of the saints showing ourselves humble he said that if anything we want to be is humble isn't that what we want to be today because that's the secret to power is through humility and you're always happy when you come out of these things of doing them he said it's a blessed order of fellowship we observe here at the church and so we do that with someone other than our family right because that's the purpose of it humility and to follow the word of god to come together and take break the bread together because we're the body of christ together right we're just apart by ourself baptism though was never an end in itself but it points to a spiritual happening first peter chapter 3 and verse 18 for christ also hath once suffered for sins just for the unjust that he might bring us to god being put to death in the flesh but quickened by the spirit by which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison which sometimes were disobedient look look at how god does he doesn't leave him he goes and preaches to him even after they've turned it down they have to hear it yes and so he said we're disobedient when once the long-suffering of god waited in the days of noah well the ark was preparing we're in few that his eight souls were saved by water he said the like figure wherein to even baptism does also now save us he said not to putting away the filth of the flesh because in the old testament realm ceremonial washings was to wash yourself from filth of the flesh from literal dirt right that's what it was to wash yourself from to make yourself clean you watched before you come and offer the sacrifice the priest had to wash but he said that's not what this is not the putting away of literal dirt but the answer of a good conscience toward god right by the resurrection i love that by the resurrection of jesus christ amen so we're speaking of his resurrection we're saying lord i'm going to be buried with you so i can be raised with you and i realize that the water itself doesn't save me but i can be raised yes aren't you glad you can be raised today in the newness of life listen he said who has gone into heaven is on the right hand of god angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him amen then the powers and angels and authorities are subject to unto him let me be subject unto him is that your desire today church i don't want to be a law to myself i don't want to be the one that makes all the rules i want to be subject to christ and who is he he is the word he said in the beginning was the word and the word was christ amen jesus baptism was essential and he was baptized by john and john's baptism was even essential because if they did not receive it they would not receive christ luke chapter 7 speaks of that and i'm going to have to skip past some of this to save time this morning but he talks about how that john came and if you go on down he said for i say unto you among those that are born of women there's not a greater prophet than john the baptist he that is least in the kingdom of god is greater than he and all the people that heard him and the publicans justified god being baptized with the baptism of john so those that were baptized who yielded themselves to john's message could hear the message of christ right but the pharisees and the lawyers rejected the counsel of god against themselves why yes they were not baptized think about it just the act the fact that they had the baptism itself didn't do it but the fact that they've yielded themselves to john's message meant that they would believe jesus message all of them there were some that believed john didn't believe in christ but if they had yielded themselves if they were a seed of god that would yield themselves again oh my that's the christian life now peter tells us to repent and be baptized we read that in preparation for the coming the holy ghost and if you receive the holy ghost you can receive the holy ghost without being baptized by the way because they did in cornelius house they received the holy ghost but they were quickly baptized and and when the eunuch stood there or was there with philip riding in the chariot and philip joined himself to the chariot and the eunuch he's explaining to him isaiah 53 who is this man he's talking about and as soon as he gets the revelation of who jesus is oh that's what we need today we need a revelation of who he is he's not just another man but he was god in flesh who was crucified for us and he died for my sins and when he got that revelation he said here is water what does hinder me from being baptized when should a person be baptized now again there's many denominations groups that do it as children or as babies the bible tells us that we should be baptized when we were convicted of sin acts chapter 2 and verse 37 when they had heard this they were pricked in their heart they were convicted they heard the word and they said they said i i feel like that's what i need to do i realize that i'm a sinner yes and they said what shall we do and peter said repent and be baptized our responsibility is to preach the word the bible said as many as believe was baptized repent be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission forgiveness of sins he said in that you shall then receive the gift of the holy ghost now but we're not to persuade and pull and scare people and talk people into it he said people must come sanely soberly under conviction and receive christ he said then the first thing they do as soon as they receive christ sitting in their seats he said the next thing is to be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of those sins that they have been convinced that they are wrong he said that's how they were a minute of their sins see because they have repented so when should we be baptized when you feel that conviction to repent he said because they have repented been baptized as a memorial to the people that i have received christ as my personal savior then that makes you a candidate for the holy ghost so when you have repented when you should be baptized you felt conviction you have repented baptism is not repentance but it's a sign of repentance luke chapter 24 and verse he 46 it said unto them thus it is written thus it behooves christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in acts 3 and 19 it says repent ye therefore and be converted that your sins may be blotted out what a wonderful scripture he said when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the lord that when you feel that presence of god that there'll be something in your heart that you say lord i'm sorry and that's what all it takes yes sir that's right you're trying to work yourself back up into favor with god no you have favor with god you yield yourself to god he said but i don't know everything yet it doesn't matter yield to what you do know yes walk with christ walketh him into death walk with him into the burial walk with him into baptism walk with him to go into church walk with him when you go to school walk with him whatever you do when you find something you're not doing that's the word says to do you do it when you find something you're doing that the word says don't do you don't do it anymore why you're walking with him you're following him you're yielding yourself to him you've repented of your sins repent and be converted that your sins may be blotted out oh i need this my sins blotted out don't you then repent and be converted amen when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the lord when should you be baptized when you understand what you're doing and this is where it gets with with children infants don't understand what they're doing a person no they may not have a great understanding but they need to have an understanding and your parents know i would be careful about rejecting baptism because you don't know if that'll ever move on their heart again that's right and a person can be re-baptized like i said if they realize they weren't as serious as they should have been and yet we need to make sure they understand what baptism is they need to understand that jesus died for their sins they need to understand that they are a sinner when they're old enough to understand that they're old enough to be baptized yes a person who does not understand is not accountable for sin you understand that if a person was mentally incapable of understanding a person is not accountable for sin at all every you think the blood of jesus was just for us you think about the grace of god you take somebody who's who's never maybe reached an age of accountability because their mind's been limited because they were born maybe in a certain way and the healing never comes and they they remain in that state they never sinned but they were born in sin yes they were but the blood of jesus christ [Music] babies don't go to hell [Music] you think heaven is going to be under populated think about it for a minute you said well there won't be room i bet you he's got room you know i've always as a father i always wanted to have room for my kids but jeremy i always wanted to have a big enough house i always like to have room and there were times it was a little cramped but i always wanted to have a room of their home i could stay in because i always had to stay with joel or somebody else growing up i always wanted to have a room of their own jesus has room if i if just in my natural i would work and do everything i can to make sure my kids have enough room what about him there will be room but there'll be thousands millions that have died that that never knew and even those who died without any knowledge maybe you say well there's hedonists that die i have no knowledge but even they can be convicted of sin and they'll be raised in the in the general resurrection and be dealt with in that way there will be people yes sir who saw you on the side of the road all right and stop to see if you're okay and they'll get there on that day they'll raise up in their whole vile body with their sins on them and they'll stand there on that that's what the scripture said he when he separated the sheep from the ghosts and the grace and the mercy of god will be so great at that time because they give a cup of water and they didn't know any better he said come enter into the joys of the lord yes sir yes sir lord when did we know that you were hungry and thirsty yeah he said as you've done it to the least of my disciples you've done it unto me god's got room the blood of jesus christ atones first time but listen to me this morning if you're here this morning you're able to hear the gospel message if you're able to hear that grace wants to do more for you than just where you make it into heaven but that grace wants to reach down into the condition where you're at into the place where you are and it wants to pull you up out of sin it wants to reach down and grab a hold of who you are grab ahold of everything that's gone wrong and all the all the doubts and the fears of life and pull you up in the newness of life that same grace that atones for the baby wants to make you a new creature in christ because you've heard yes the gospel now what what do we do we just follow that you know i don't follow christ because i'm afraid i'll go to hell i follow christ because of his overwhelming love yes i'm just standing there brother gabe and it just it just overwhelms me yeah i can't do anything else but follow christ and the scriptures make me wise to that as the scripture said it makes me wise to salvation the scripture show me he said well the scriptures aren't right but the scriptures show me the love of god yes amen that's right i might have to get past some things but we'll close in a moment notice we don't find a scripture where they do infant baptism baptism is a confession that an inward work of grace has been done little infants has no knowledge of sin and when jesus died at the cross he took away the sin of the world so when the baby becomes a human being and born into the world they have no sin of their own therefore they have no repentance to be done the blood of jesus christ takes away sin but when he i'm skipping through i'm sorry to those that are following me in the back he said but there he said you come into the world speaking lives sinners by nature but the blood of jesus christ atones for that but when the baby comes to the age of accountability it knows what's right and wrong then it has to repent for what it is done it's sin now it's just a sin just like it's born in sin it's a human sin the sin now is the sin that adam and eve did that was omitted by god by the blood of jesus christ he said now the baby has no sins to repent from until he sins then he's got to repent and when he repents then is the time to be baptized hallelujah yes sir he's baptized by immersing what follows baptism sanctification follows baptism the scripture said he gave himself he loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify it he doesn't want to leave us in our filthy garments in our old ways he wants to sanctify us preaching to the church now that's an ongoing process yes right an ongoing process you continue to walk in sanctification if your mouth is not as sanctified as it should be you need to be washed by the waters of the word if your walk is not as sanctified as it should be maybe you should find a place of repentance a place of sanctification let the word wash you he wants to present it to himself a glorious church that's an ongoing process you've got to stand in the water and be washed by the word notice brother branham taught us that your first wedding was annulled he said you've never done it in the first place because there's only one thing to do it that would be god come down himself and took your place in the form of the son of god jesus christ and wash you by the water by the washing of the water by the word the word not the denomination the word washed you but if you won't stand in the water of the word how you're going to be washed follow him into repentance and then follow him into sanctification stand and be washed in the word and that continues all through your christian walk yes that alone isn't enough you've got to be filled with the holy ghost brother branham taught us that full obedience to the full word of god entitles us to the token you see how it begins with baptism you're obedient to baptism you're obedient to the things you know to do that's all you can do you can't save yourself but you can be identified with the death burial and resurrection of christ and when you're identified in baptism then you can be raised with him in newness of life but that's obedience to the word it's better to obey than to sacrifice how it's better to obey than to beat yourself up i'm just being honest with you today you can beat yourself up all the rest of your life won't do you any good better to obey god come under come under headship of christ the word just obey god do what god says god says i should be in church better to obey than to beat myself up god says i should wash i should be baptized then i should be baptized god says i should pay my tithes i'll pay my eyes god says i should do these things i'll do it not because somebody needs it not because we have a building program and we pull money out of you but because god said so whatever god says that's what we do right yes and he said you must be born again that don't mean jump up and down at the altar don't mean walk back there and shake hands with the pastor i don't mean all this foolishness we've seen done it means it don't mean putting your name on a church book it means death to your first being life to the second man means the blood has been applied you're identified by the life of jesus christ and if he is the vine we are the branches the life that's in the branch he said also from the vine it'll bear the fruit listen he will not leave you yes that's such a powerful scripture where david says he will not leave my soul in hell i will not suffer my holy one to see corruption he will not leave you in dead trespasses and sins if you are faithful and come to him in baptism and surrender yourself completely to him the promise is to you and your children and to them that are far off he will fill you with the holy ghost if you have died for your first being he is faithful to do that that will never stop yeah that will never stop don't you see why the satan wants to take away baptism from us don't you see why he wants to take away communion from us he wants to take away foot washing he wants to take away get to gathering together and the hour that we live in he wants to take that away from us because that's what when we do that we're being obedient to god and when we come together listen they were obedient to god to come into the upper room he said tear you in jerusalem and when they did the holy ghost fell on them and when you come in obedience to god listen if you're here this morning and you're suffering with something and there's some kind of sickness in your body you've come in obedience to god then you can receive your healing today this is the time when it comes when you're being obedient to the word amen i wish i had more a voice to preach this morning are you hearing me today yes are you hearing the word today he will not leave you in the grave of dead trespasses and sins i'm so glad for that amen he did not leave me where he found me he raised me up listen young people children some of you been baptized some of you are about to be baptized he will not leave you where you are he will raise you up all through your life yes you promised to do that he promised he would be there to help you now what do you do you follow him that's called discipleship you become his disciple you follow him as a disciple acts chapter 2 and verse 41 they that gladly received his word were baptized in the same day they were added unto them about 3 000 souls they continued steadfastly in the apostles doctrine and fellowship and breaking a bread and in prayers and fear come upon every soul in many wonders and signs were done by the apostles why because they believed the word yes listen if we believe the word today we're going to go to church if we believe the word we're going to follow him to church yes if we believe the word we're going to follow him to baptism if we believe the word we're going to follow him through these ordinances that have been laid out and to fellowship with him beyond just the ordinances to a communion with him brother branham said if god is in your heart that's what we need today god in our heart you can't hardly wait for them doors to open out yonder to get in here to fellowship with your brothers if you don't feel that way i tell you he said it's time you got to pray you said brother ben this has been so simple this morning i understood all of this i think it's something mark twain said one time he said it ain't those parts of the bible that i can't understand that bothers me it's the parts i do understand i don't know what stage you are in the journey today but if you follow him to baptism it gives me hope that you'll follow him to the holy ghost yes follow him to the holy ghost and i see you taking communion with the saints and washing feet it gives me hope then that why we feel so good when our kids get baptized it gives us hope they're following christ and if they follow me they might mess up if they follow me they could find an example that would be imperfect although i strive to walk with god but if they follow me it would be an example that would be imperfect but if they could follow christ yes if i could ever point them to that one that they could be led by they could be led all through their life and then it wouldn't matter what happened it wouldn't matter if they were disappointed it wouldn't matter if church turned against them if people turned against them if if people were unfaithful if people didn't do what they were supposed to do see all that will matter unless they're following christ but if they follow christ they'll make it good why don't you follow into death burial and resurrection walk with him in newness of life let's power heads together i wonder if we could just make this a statement where he leads me i will follow i don't know if we even know the words or the tune to that where he leads me i will follow follow all the way where he leaves me [Music] just while you're talking to him from where he leads me i will fall i'll go with him with [Music] and she plays that heavenly father lord i believe that people have listened today and it's been broken up and i know i haven't done as good a job as i could have i'm sorry for that lord but lord i i believe your word is true and it's powerful sharper quicker than any two-edged sword as i stand here lord even annoyed at myself because there's it could be said in so much a better way and yet overwhelmed by the grace and the truth of it lord to know that your blood atones for all my sin all of my children all of these young people that are gathered here for all of these older people maybe someone who's been lord in rebellion against god for many years but yet you're bidding to them today and beckoning to them to come and follow follow all the way the old man is dead it doesn't matter what was done in the old life [Music] what matters is the one that walks and how we walk in newness of life i pray lord that you'd help us to follow you lord as a pastor may i follow you and into lord whatever you would have me to say lord as the people may they follow you into new life and they follow you into loving one another follow you into fellowship with the church follow you into forgiveness lord follow you into the newness of life only your spirit can give us i pray that that would be so today lord if there's people maybe perhaps here that have not been baptized that i pray you'd convict them of sin today lord that maybe maybe you've done a work in their life repentance but realize that next step is to be baptizing christian baptism i pray that they would go quickly to the water lord i know it won't be by my own efforts but according to your word or maybe convicted today by the work of the holy spirit or if there's one maybe that's refused to take communion or or to wash feet i pray you can victim of that lord order that they'd come together with the people of god lord though we're all sinners lord we need to walk together and do the things you promised and you told us to do we'll be happy if we do those things we thank you for that lord i pray you to help us as a church to do the simple things right do what we can do lord knowing that you'll pick up the slack you'll do art if we yield our members to you you will do exceedingly and abundantly above what we can ask our thing i pray you granted today lord as we go worship just for a moment and go into the baptismal service lord i pray that your spirit would continue to be with us lord that you continue to work in every heart we pray in jesus name amen amen brother joel come and let's just worship him a moment let's stand together and sing that if you need to pray the altar is open this morning [Music] thank you [Music] with him all the way he will give me grace and glory he
