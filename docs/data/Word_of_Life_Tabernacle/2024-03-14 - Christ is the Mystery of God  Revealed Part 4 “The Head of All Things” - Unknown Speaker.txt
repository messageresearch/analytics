see the same thing he's got you on today see see you act any way you want to you're free moral agan so therefore if he put the first like that he has to put the second like that he has to put everyone like that or he acted wrong in the first place amen but everybody is on that same basis now noticing and bringing that back and letting that man do that and knowing that he would do it nobody he would do it but what did it do it displayed his rute as Savior and the whole purpose then is left in Jesus Christ to become God himself to take the penalty of his own law death to die to redeem the wife that was lost by rejecting him when Eve went away from the word she went away from her mate and when the church goes away from the word to a denomination she rejects and commits fornications with the world of man's Wisdom rejecting the authority of God's word that sound clear the Bible said committing spiritual fornications any word in the Bible That's rejected or any self interpretation put to it is absolutely rejecting and committing adultery against the god that is your husband and adulterous never enters the kingdom of heaven we know that now see that's what Eve done at the first place now notice again now what's his threefold purpose manifest himself in Jesus Christ to come into the body by Jesus Christ to have the prises to what restore back Eden bring back that which lost that's the only thing out of order all the rest of his things was in order but he had to let put man on free moreal agency to fall so that he might be a ior to display what's in him see his attribute of Savior something had to be lost and the very thing that man fell and become lost he become the savior of that taking his own law and he could not do it is that great Jehovah that covered all space time see he could do it and he had to become a man and he took kinship with the man that was lost amen and become a man God made flesh Hallelujah I think I'm excited about not something inside God became from God to become me to take my sin upon him that he might make me him amen back to his great purpose of Sons and Daughters of God for he is a Eternal Father that attribute was in him see so that had to be displayed now see the whole threefold purpose see to express himself he wants to become the the world is lost now he has to express himself in a man to become a savior through the reconciliation of the blood from his cross now he had to become that to die in order to save and to bring yourself back into the church to have the pences in church now remember it cannot and will not and never will be

from Colossians 1:18 John 13 Ephesians 1:22 and Colossians 1 18 how many glad to be in the house of the Lord tonight good to see all of you for the West good to see you guys on a Wednesday night and each one of you that made it out it's kind of nice the time has changed and and uh we don't have as uh uh not won't be as late or feel as late when we get out so maybe we ought to preach an extra hour tonight just to kind of make up for that but we won't do that so uh we want to talk about chrisis the mystery of God revealed again I I want to welcome um I want to welcome my mother uh to the area she is with us tonight and and uh she just moved up we moved her up uh uh Wednesday night so she's officially a resident of Cherokee Village so uh it's good to have our mom with it go ahead that's all right she uh she's a good mother she managed to raise me and and uh mostly raised Joel and and uh six other children so we're we're glad to have her living up here closer where she can come to church more often amen John Chap 1:3 and then we'll go to Ephesians 1 and Colossians 1 says all things someone say all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made Ephesians 1:22 says and hath put there it is again all things under his feet so all things were made by him all things are under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning this Colossians 1:18 I just went right into the next verse Colossians 1:18 he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence pray the Lord with Daddy's bless lening to the word you may be seated I think it's pretty clear that the Bible teaches that he made all things that all things are under his feet and that he is the head of all things and in all things he wants to have the preeminence I I want to I want us to understand tonight that if he's the head that means he's the boss right that's what that means he's the boss he's he's not a middleman manager he's not he don't have to ask anybody he don't have to get my permission or your permission all things are under his feet oh and I'm so glad of that today because that means that the devil even has to ask him permission before he can come at me before he can come at you the devil actually has to get permission to come at you I want to say I want to say tonight we he he is over all things and that means he's over cancer he's over diabetes he's over every every symptom that would come in our body he's over all things oh that's what that's what we understood by Christ is the mystery of God revealed that he is the preeminent he has the preeminence he is over all things so brother B says since we think this now this is important since we think this since he has been made the head of all things to us Oh my he is the head of all things to us he said which we are considered all things so we're part of that right yes sir you say now now here it's where we talked some about this Sunday sometimes we look at the world and the way that it is we look at people and see how could they get by with that well he's the head of the cner too yeah that's what the Bible teaches he if he was the if he's the head of all things what about the sinner he was made to be the judge of The Sinner if he don't accept it he was made the glory for the believer who does accept it so there thing he said all things again I want you to say it all things that's everything it's not everything except for the big stuff it's not everything except for some stuff it's not everything except for the thing which I think went wrong or where I didn't get my way but all things in all things he has the fre in all things he is the head he man and so we got to trust him tonight church we got to believe him that he knows what he's doing and he knows more about us than we know about ourselves yes so in all things he has the preeminence now look in in 2 Timothy 2:20 I want you to to get this about because he's over all things and yet there's good and bad that that that benefit from his Mercy yeah the bad benefit the good benefit sir but yet he's the head of all things he'll he'll deal with them in his time but but he's over all things now look in 2 Timothy 2:20 but in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver but also of wood and of Earth some to honor and some to dishonor and so we realized then in a great house he's the head of all things he's the king of everything and so but in his great house there's some that are vessels of Honor some that are vessels of Dishonor brother Brandon went to a meeting among the Pentecostals when he first met the Pentecostal people and I look at our kids you know going to youth camp you know it's it's kind of like that you're getting in that atmosphere almost an extreme atmosphere of worship and and praise and it just does something to you uh you know we ought to have services like that here and I believe we do but but it just seemed like everybody's gathered together for one purpose and and yet there's evil present yeah people get sick things happen and and there's leav in the loaf if we can say it that way there there there's kids that don't act right and not everybody that says they're a message believer is a message believer not everybody that says there Christian lives it there's always evil present Paul said whenever I would do good there's evil present and yet we've been called to be something different than the evil and and so brother Brandon meets those Pentecostals and he he sees that that there's one that's spoke in tongues and one that interpreted and one of them was a real Christian and the other one was uh was a charlatan was living with somebody else's wife and how could they both be anointed and so he read the he the Lord showed him Hebrews chapter 6 and verse 7 for the Earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh off upon it and bringeth forth herbs meat for them by whom it is dressed receiveth blessing from God all things it all does right but he but that which beareth thorns and briers is rejected and is nigh into cursing whose end is to be burned now look all things receive the Rin but only the the seed becomes the wheat that he wants us to be there had to be something inside of us so there's always going to be something there but I'll say this for us that we should be a a standard of God's mercy we should be a standard of God's grace but the brandom calls us God's insign and insign is kind of an old word but it means a flag or a standard we are the standard that's right we are God's standard in the Earth today brother Brandon says we are God's ins signs to the world he said that's the reason I'm always scolding the Pentecostal Church getting after them he said their ways of living that's the reason the world can't see Christ cuz we let down the bars we get away from that see you can't control what somebody else does but you got to be an ins sign yourself let's be the standard let's be the banner let's do that ourselves let's let's become that yeah amen and so he says when our women dressed and act like act like the rest of the world when our men go out and dirty jokes and smoke and carry on like the rest of them married five four or five times everything else plls get them into church what he means not that a person couldn't be saved in that condition but people are pulling them in giv promising them things and and trying to get them in the church and they don't change they they they never they never become any different they're just like they always were he said why no he said the world don't believe you've got it he said let me tell you brother when you're dead and your life is hid in Christ through God and sealed by the Holy Ghost and God lifts you up in Heavenly places you'll be an ins sign that the work of God has been committed in you oh I trust you that have received the baptism of the Holy Ghost you're an inside today sir you're a standard you're a banner of God's love to the world amen amen amen I believe our young people were that over the weekend let's be that every day of the week wherever we go whatever we do whatever we do the rest of our lives look Paul Paul says beloved we are persuaded better things of you yeah things that accompany salvation better than than the tears we're we're persuaded that you're wheat your God's seed now look brand said it takes the night we're going back to crisis the mystery of God revealed it takes the night to express the glory of the day it takes the vessel of Dishonor to express the love and care for the vessel of the honored it takes an evil woman that would wear immoral clothes and sell her morals to express the virtue of a decent genuine lady it takes a crook and a thief and a man to express the genuiness of a real believer a real Christian it takes the hypocrite to show up the believer what he is so that's why in the house there's some vessels of honor and some vessels of Dishonor because you wouldn't know what the vessels of Honor were without the vessels of Dishonor right so there's got to be somebody that that tells a lie so somebody else can tell the truth there's got to be somebody who gives in so there'll be somebody who won't give in and who live it every moment amen heyen so all things was made by him and brother Rand said since he was made all things made for all of us he said all things were made by for by him he said then since that is true we should make our identification should be with him we should be identified ourselves with him because he has identified himself with us yeah that's what the baptism of the Holy Ghost is it's God identifying himself with you it's God sealing your faith accepting your faith and so he has identified himself with you so we should be identified with him he said how by living for him amen do you love him tonight by living for him not just a confession now this this is you this isn't very deep brother Ben well it's good anyhow and it's actually just about as deep as you can get because you can't get anything more uh more deeper really than Christ in you you can't really get anything deeper than the mystery of God in flesh yeah right so he said he said you're uh so many people takes a confession and say I got he's got to this place now are you a Christian I'm Methodist he said well that's a long ways from making yourself known as a Christian he said well now now watch because now if you identify yourself as a Methodist you're identifying yourself with whatever the Methodist Church is yeah right so everything the Methodist do is what you do well look what the Methodist does right right I'm Baptist well look what the Baptist does I'm Catholic look what they do I want you to understand today that your primary identification is not as Word of Life Tabernacle right right because look what they do right yall are good people you understand but but but then you you have to identify with every other person that says they're from Word of Life Tabernacle it is an identification but it's not our primary identification right your primary identification is not well I listen to brother Ben PR he's my pastor that's not your primary identific we thank God for that but that's not what how we identify ourselves we don't identify ourselves even by by saying well I believe the message yeah right right we don't identify ourselves well I believe in a prophet that's not how we identify ourselves as Christians yeah we identify with Christ because he never did anything wrong right oh church we can only understand that listen in every group there's going to be good and bad there's going to be there's going to be right and wrong but we identify ourselves as Christian Christians amen because we know he never did anything wrong so they they say I'm Catholic I'm Methodist he said look what they do said but the only way you can actually be a Christian is for Christ to identify himself in you right he said how we got a he said a stinger there he said I hope everybody on the tape gets that too you say I'm Pentecostal that don't mean a thing he said it's Christ identified in you that's when we'll know he said that's when he has recognized you you say I spoke with tongues Devils does too I shouted the muhammadans Buddhist everything shouts Indians scream at the snake dance sure they all do colts Clans everything else screaming holler holler and shouted a baseball game but when Christ is identified in you identifying himself then you are Christlike which the word Christian means to be Christlike there is your identification all right he said now and since he is our identification we should be identified with him by living for him that's how you identify you don't identify by even how we worship because we worship a lot like the Pentecostal Church worships you know why let me explain that you know why we identify more Pentecostal style of worship because the shuck was the closest thing to the wheat right so if you've got something if if you got real wheat it's not going to look very much like the stalk it's not going to look very much like the tassel but it's going to look a lot like the shut right but the shuck is not the wheat but yet the wheat and and and things that we do many things we do are going to look like Pentecostal but that's not how we identify ourselves we identify ourselves as as Christians he's living in us then we should be identified with him by living for him amen that's how we get our identification it's not about even our worship though that's good and we ought to worship him with all of our hearts listen Church he's done so much for us we ought to worship him every moment of the day every day of the week every hour of the day it ought to be our constant our constant thought our constant praise ought to be towards him listen to me young people don't let the devil steal away from you that that that that worship that God gave you don't let him steal away from you you worship God on I don't care what anybody else says worship God trust God live for God walk with God but but but our worship is not how we're identified we're identified by living for him God's now we're going to get where brother Brandon begins to get into the meat of his sermon now he begins to deal with God's three-fold purpose he said notice God has has had a three-fold purpose in this great mystery secret God in his great mystery secret that he had before the world began he's got a three-fold purpose in it he said now what we want to go upon this morning is what is that three-fold purpose he said and I believe by the help of God who is present I love that he just casually throws that in but the help of God who is present he'll show it to us yeah Oh my he said that was my my Ministry to to say he's here yeah he said now if he had this three-fold purpose we want to find out what is this three-fold purpose now I know some of y'all like brother Ben this is so Elementary well the kid your kids aren't born knowing this stuff and every one of us needs to be reminded of it from time to time so he had a three-fold purpose now we're taking a big view of all of time his entire Plan of Redemption a threefold purpose he said the first thing was that God wanted to reveal himself to the people he wanted to reveal himself to the people he couldn't do it as great Jehovah God who covered all space Time and Eternity yeah oh there's so many lessons in that church it just Thrills my heart to know he couldn't do it as great Jehovah God because he's too great so we look for big things many times and and that's not how he necessarily reveals to himself he doesn't just reveal himself in big things but he reveals himself in humility God oh my he hides himself in Simplicity reveals himself in humility now look he couldn't do it as a great Jehovah he's too great to ever be revealed to people because it would be too mysterious how could that great being that never did begin that after you went beyond the cycle of hundreds of billions and trillions and trillions of years of light space on out into the infant into the eternity eternity and a great creature that was all that and still is but what he he wanted to do he said he loved fatherhood yes for he was a father and the only way that he could express it was to become a son a man now this is important now he said that's the reason Jesus kept saying the son of man the son of man is just God in flesh right that's why we believe that the son of man revealed himself in our day revealed himself through a prophet but now he's revealing himself in the bride and you can to find quote after quote after quote that's that way it wasn't just in a prophet in Malachi 4 but it was also to be revealed in the bride at the last day he had to come in flesh again I hope you're hear me today he had to come in flesh again that's the age we're living in we're not living in a time of of of milk we're not living in a time of just justification or sanctification or even just the the baptism of the Holy Ghost or the fruits of the spirit but he's we're actually living or the gifts of the Spirit we're living in the time of the fullness of the manifestation of Christ and I said Lord live in me every moment be make my flesh your flesh make my feet your feet make my hands your hands that's the hour that we're living in we're not living in a time where you only worship God in church we're living in a time where you worship God on Sunday and on Monday and on Tuesday and on Wednesday and all through the week you worship Him in your job you worship him at school you worship oh the world don't understand it and they can't live it but you can live it why because you he has come inside of you to live it that's right it's God in flesh you say well if God was in my flesh it'd do a whole lot more miraculous things well that's what they said about him if God was in my flesh there'd be a lot of people talking about it would know about it and the world would be that's what they said about him maybe you don't even recognize oh church we could just understand it today we'd realize that we have the authority to speak to whatever is going on in our lives and get rid of it yes and send it out because we we have a right to to the to the promises of God to all the promises of God why the son of man the son of man it's Christ in you the hope of glory he said that's the reason Jesus kept saying the son of man now watch Hebrews 21:14 backs this up he said for his much then as the children are partakers of Flesh and Blood he also himself likewise took part of the same that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death that is the devil so he had to become a partaker of Flesh and Blood a son of man now he said see they didn't know what he was talking about many of them but now you get it he said see he wanted to express himself that was one of his great three fold purposes was to express himself identify himself with human beings see Jason he wants to identify himself with you even as a young man man he wants to identify himself Jaden he wants to identify himself with young men so he became a young man right and so he not only wanted to live in a flesh body but he wants to live in your flesh body right he he he know only went to church in his body he wants to go to church in your body he not only healed the sick in his body he wants to heal the sick in your body he not only cast out devils in his body but he wants to cast out devils in your body are you hearing me tonight he he wants to borrow your body amen that's what the son of man is that's what we've been shown that God would do that in our hour right Amen to identify himself with human beings but so the second fold the first fold is God above us yeah and or or he was God above us and then and then he come down the first fold of unveiling himself is Christ right he's expressing himself and then secondly God in us the son of man but not the son of man in one body but the son of man in a many membered body right at the end time now watch and to do that now brother brand taught us he become a Son of God through the church ages at the end he would be revealed for a short time as son of man again because the Gentiles had to see was had to have the opportunity the Jews had right before the coming of the Lord now so that is that is his great three-fold purpose was to express himself so we get it the first one is Christ right second is to have preeminence in his body of Believers that is his bride that he might live in people yes that's pretty simple isn't it he might live in brother Joe right sister Joanna he might live in people right he he might live in you say well brother Ben that's hard for me to see but that's because of the veil of flesh but he wants to live in you right see Colossians 1:27 he said to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles he wants to make this known which is Christ in you the hope of glory why did he give you the baptism of the Holy Ghost he wants to live in youen are you with me so far he said now he could do that in Adam and Eve but sin SE ated them so now there had to be some way to get it back again he said oh my this is Rich to me just to even think of it see what God's purpose was now why didn't he just keep Adam and Eve like that here's a here's a good question why did he why didn't he just keep them like that and that implies he had the power to keep them like that right he could have just he could have just knocked the old serpent in the head and send him on down the road right he could have just he knew what was going on right right he could have just stopped it but he didn't stop it why he had a purpose yes he he could have just done that many times in our lives he could have just taken care of it but he let us go through it but he said I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you I'll always be with you amen but but he lets us go through it why he wants to express himself right Hallelujah so he expresses himself in his attributes now watch that was his purpose he said he he would never have been able to express his fullness his full attribute because he could have been a father there that's true but also he's a savior oh I'm so glad for that attribute of Salvation I'm so glad he came down and and became a savior to me so he had to in order to do that he had to become a son right he said he would never been able to express his fullness but he's a savior he said you say how do you know he was he is cuz I've had the experience he is a savior and he had to express that how could he do it only through Christ how could he be a son only through Christ how could he be a Healer only through Christ you see what brother R's elevating here he's not elevating a certain Church he's not elevating a certain Ministry he's not even elevating himself but he's pointing to the Lamb of God and he's saying how can he be a son only through Christ how can he be a Healer only through Christ all things are wound up in that one person Jesus that he got him for the bill you've got everything you got nothing to worry about young people you got nothing to worry about mama when you're worried about your little children you got nothing to worry about fathers you got nothing to worry about as you get older why because you got him he's in your boat you got nothing to worry about Hallelujah all things are wound up in that one person so if you have him you have life if you have him you got everything oh that just makes you want to stop and worship for a while if you got him you got enough to make it through Hallelujah he said when I think of it I just see denominations pass off the scene why because they're trying to put something between you and him a headship between you and him but but there's not nothing between you and him because there's one mediator between God and man the man Christ Jesus are you with me now you become man to be that mediator and watch he said when I see God 's great purpose revealing himself and first to reveal himself in Christ the fullness of the godhead bodily and then to bring that fullness of godhead bodily into a people powerful stuff it's not easy stuff he could bring the fullness of godhead bodily into a people and the listen to me the the biggest thing the the greatest battle of your life is going to be wrestling with the thought sir that a man could have a Divine attribute on the inside brother BR said the hardest thing he can do is get one human being to believe another listen to me Church the biggest battle you'll ever face is trying to get you to believe you on to get to the point where you you know I know I'm going to make it I know it's going to be okay I know Christ dwells in me because you're always looking at what you do wrong you're always looking at the outside you're always looking at the attributes of sin but we know that there's a God who's brought us up over all of that he's brought us up above all those things do you believe it tonight how many of you believe it tonight you you you know he's brought you up there's something inside of you greater than you he that is in you is greater than he that is in the world come on you got to wrestle with that with the thought of divinity in flesh that's what's hard for people to see they can't see Christ brother Wes because Christ came in a baby form in a Manger in a helpless form yet he was God in flesh yeah and they can't see you can't see yourself because you come in a way that you you think well I I just couldn't be that but by his grace you are right by his blood you are right you said well he never made a mistake I made mistakes but he died for you took your penalty so that you could be free so he could come and have the preeminence over your life and and that's a that's a heavy thought preeminence is a heavy thought it's hard to wrestle with he wants preeminence over your emotions preeminence over your life preeminence over your job preeminence over your family not the preacher him yes right not the church him not denomination him he wants preeminence and he is the word right he said then to bring that full of godhead bodily into a people that he could have the premise to oversight the leading and brother brandham talks about the prisoner of Jesus Christ and he just preached that sermon he talks about that he said another one he said if you didn't get the tape he said I preach on a prisoner of Jesus Christ Paul a prisoner he said when God gets you to be his prisoner you can't do nothing but what the spirit says do Paul was all this great intellect he was taught by Gia to be a great priest to Rabbi someday and he had high Ambitions he was intellectually a great man great Authority great man in the nation but he had to sacrifice every bit of it to become part of the word to express Jesus Christ oh I hope we can see it tonight he had a notion to go over someplace some brother had called him but he was forbidden by the spirit yeah to do his own will look at acts 16 we can find that in the scripture how many believe the prophet was a word Prophet so everything we always tie it back to the scripture and show what brother Brandon was talking about when he says these things acts 16:4 as they went through the cities they delivered them the decrees for the keep that ordained to the apostles and Elders which are at Jerusalem we still keep those things today at verse five so were the churches established in the faith and increased in number daily I love that verse six now when they had gone throughout fgia and the region of galatia were forbidden of the Holy Spirit to preach the word in Asia you said why would they be forbidden to preach the word in a certain place everything you do just because you're busy doesn't mean you're busy in the way God wants you to to be that's a good lesson for all of us right we we got to be busy doing what he wants us to do right so it's it was his will for them to preach because he called them to preach but he don't always want you to preach in the place you want to preach sometimes he calls you somewhere else it's his will for you uh if you're a housewife it's his will for you to do certain things if you're a uh uh uh say a worker it's his will for you to do certain things but maybe not in the place that you're in so you got to follow his will now just being busy is not always the will of God act 16:7 after they were come to Mah they Sav to go into bythnia but the spirit suffered them not now if the spirit forbids something it's because there's something else you should be doing right he doesn't forbid something just to make you lazy yeah but he forbids you doing this because there's something else you need to do right verse eight they passing by MAA come down to trass and a vision appeared to Paul in the night there stood a man of Macedon and prayed him saying come over into Macedonia and help us well I love that what is it he he couldn't have gone into Macedonia and helped the man in the vision if he had gone down into Asia right so God had something better for him he's always got something better if he closed this one door he's always someone say always he's always got something better brother Ben how can you say that because he's head of how many things how many things if he's head of all things right come on now y going to think you're in a Sunday school class tonight but listen that's what he is right he's the Supreme he's the head of all things he has preeminence in the body right and so where he wants you to go he'll open the door where he wants you to not go he'll close the door Hallelujah said and after you'd seen the vision immediately we endeavored to go into Macedonia assuredly Gathering I love that that the Lord had called us for us for to preach the gospel unto them yes sir that's what he meant he was a prisoner to the will of God brother BR said oh people half spiritual can pick that up I think I'm at least half spiritual tonight so if you're half spiritual tonight let's let's pick that up and apply it in our lives he said see he was forbidden to do his own will only could do he said the spirit forbid me see he was a prisoner to Christ he said that this little fortune teller one day who he know Paul knew he had power to cast that devil out but he could only do it as God willed it now here's another lesson for us yes you don't cast out every devil you come across boy got quiet it's true though because sometimes brother brandom said there's a reason why God's dealing with that person and that's why brother brandom had to learn that by the way because early in his ministry every every person come across the stage he he worked with them until they were healed he said and sometimes he took a curse off somebody and God had placed it on there or allowed it to be put on them so you don't cast out every day devil that comes along but what you do is you pray for everybody you you you lay hands on everybody cuz we're called to do that and and and so and I don't want you to think well God gave me this sickness no no God allowed it to be there but he also said you're already healed yeah you're not waiting on healing you're already healed yes sir you just got to appropriate the faith to believe it and sometimes it takes laying on a hand sometimes it takes going through a prayer line sometimes it takes being in a good service but you got to appropriate the faith what you're doing is building your faith it's already done you're already saved amen you already you've already made it but you got to you got to build your faith to that point so now look but he said this little fortune teller Paul knew he had the power to cast that devil out but he could only do it as God will it day after day she followed him crying out after him but one day the spirit gave him permission then he rebuked her the spirit that was in her see he knew what it was to be a prisoner he talked about Moses and his intellectuals he had to lose him in order to find Christ to be a prisoner then when God got all the world beat out of him all of his mighty men that he was and stand in the presence of that Pillar of Fire that day he was found just speechless that's a miracle sometimes isn't it Jo would that be a miracle if if you were found speechless oh but sometimes we get in the presence of God and we're found speechless speechless you just don't God so I watched God do some things FR last Friday night I watched him do some things and I found myself speechless unable to say anything why because I knew God was working oh church we could only reach that place where maybe you don't even have the words to to say thank you but your your spirit is crying out praise and adoration to God right when he got in the presence he was speechless Lord what do you want me to do yes sir he said he couldn't even talk he said God had a prisoner then amen he said see you won't try after your own searching and God had to Endo this man or him with power nothing could go down there he said Lord I told Pharaoh what you said he wouldn't do it he said then take this Rod God speaking that's God's word go out there and point it towards the east and call for flies and flies come in creation because he had a prisoner that Pharaoh couldn't pay off with nothing now look you don't think Moses had some inkling of how stupid it looked to take a stick and call for flies let there be flies and everybody's looking at him saying who does this man think he is sure he did he was human but he was a prisoner he he realized how stupid it looked to go down to Egypt with his wife on a donkey going down to Egypt and he said what are you going down to do I'm going down to take over he realized how how ineffective that was he realized what little he could do but why did he do it because he was a prisoner oh Church it may look like that everything's against you it may look like you're not able to do what God called you to do but you do it anyway because you're a prisoner to the word of God not a prisoner of chains but a prisoner of Love Now look he said then take this that Rod God speaking that's God's word go out there and point it towards the east and call for flies and flies come into creation because he had a prisoner the Pharaoh couldn't pay off with nothing nobody else could turn him no away he was a complete prisoner in the chains of God's word bound up only to thus sayith the Lord yeah he said oh if God can get him prisoners like that he said that's when he can express the preeminence as you see he's got the man of the person so that he knows nothing but Christ oh that we can get that way tonight we know nothing but Christ he said all right that's secondly first to express himself completely God in Christ second to have the preeminence by this in his church which is his body the bride till he could have the preeminence to express himself through them we're not all sitting around waiting on something to happen sitting around waiting on a prophet to to do this or a prophet to do that Prophet has come that we thought Elijah was supposed to come said he already came and you missed it or you wouldn't be looking for him again right oh Church you wouldn't be looking for an eighth day mess you wouldn't be looking for somebody else but he came already and they already did to him the denominations already turned it down but you believed it you're the Bride of Jesus Christ who receives it and lives it amen becomes that word watch he he expresses himself in in in through us he said and thirdly to restore the kingdom to its rightly position that fell by sin by the first adom back to where he walked in the cool of the evening with his people talked with them fellowship with them can you imagine Brother David what it'll be like in the Millennium period when we're able to fellowship with him as a human being here I believe there will be a Corporal body I I believe that brother that's what Believers believe and we'll be able to fellowship with him as a human being like we are only will have no sin there'll be there'll be no sin the devil will be bound for a thousand years there will be no sorrow no heartache amen our bodies will be changed back into a body like his glorious body can you imagine what it was like f them fellowship with him in the Garden of Eden before there was sin how much greater will it be when we go back to that condition and yet we have a testimony I've been redeemed by the blood of the Lamb they couldn't have that testimony so they fail and we've gone through all these 6,000 years of history and today we stand right at the end of that history looking back and say I am redeemed I've been bought with a price and it won't be very much longer like we said Sunday morning we're about to step into that place the world is standing in Slippery places about to slide into the tribulation period but we're standing in a sure place on the solid rock of revelation of God's word about to step into the Rapture oh Wonder if we can believe it tonight I wonder if we can grab a hold of it tonight is it real to us church I don't mean to yell at you but I wonder sometimes if oh God I pray God would stir us tonight it's a step the world goes into tribulation just a step we go into the presence of God or we fellowship with him oh what that I know it's going to be better than what I feel here brother Harvey there have been moments in my life when I've just about busted out of My Flesh because I felt the presence of God so real and it just felt like I was about to go home any moment and it's the best moments of my life you what was the best moments of your life are the been it's those moments when I knew everything was under the blood everything was right and I was living for God not because I had never done anything wrong but because he had forgiven me he had saved me brought me into his house and he loved me and he cares about me and I get in the presence of God and I feel the the anointing of God the presence of God and it just seems like nothing can compare to that you can have all the ball games you want to you can have everything else you want to but let me have a moment in the presence of God that's just listen to me Church brother said just a shadow of a shadow of a shadow of what it'll be like over there all that we can feel here would be just a shadow shadow of what it really is yes sir hallelujah oh church he said now sin and death had separated them from his presence and his entire expression he said do you read it before the foundation of the world to express all of his attributes what he was he said therefore if any trinitarian here would just let yourself loose a minute you can see the father Son and the Holy Ghost is not three Gods it's three attributes of the same God said see it's it's expression father he wanted to be a father he was a father he was a son and he is the Holy Ghost and the father and the Holy Ghost is the Same Spirit don't you see he said you get it he said not three Gods the devil has told you them things to make an idolator out of you see he said it's one God expressed in three attributes to be father to be savior to be son to be healer see is his expression brother BR talked about how each subject could take all day but he wanted to make it clear he said God expressed in Jesus Christ who is both Father Son and Holy Ghost the fullness of the godhead bodily oh church I'm going to close in just a moment look he said now someone say now the complete fullness of the godhead bodily dwells in his church when 20 years from now 50 years from now when the next great Revival comes along the next time we have a meeting it's not what he said now listen this is something you've heard I told you you'd hear some catchphrases and some things we say all the time because such an important message listen all Christ all that God was he poured into Christ and all Christ was was poured into the church the Believers oh my I want to stop there in Christ is the mystery of God revealed but we just take the scripture now in Philippians 26 now look he's talking about Christ he said who being in the form of God the word form is morphe you find brother teaching on that in in messages like the unveiling of God or the Mighty God unveiled before us it's morphe it's means to change your mask but to be the same in essence yeah all that God was he changed his mask and poured into Christ all that Christ was he changed his mask and now he wears your mask my mask is that simple enough we can all understand it now look Mark 16-12 you'll find the same word in fact it's the only other place in the New Testament where this Greek word morphe is used is in Mark 16:12 said after that he appeared in what another form another form unto two of them as they walked and went into the country another morphe another behind another mask and they'd known him in the flesh but they didn't recognize him in this form oh Church how many people in this hour knew brother brandom but didn't recognize Christ when he came in Bride form right how many people how many people recognize oh my that Jesus was there but did not recognize when he came on the on to the 120 in the upper room why he appeared in another form but it was still him how do we know it was still him he still did the same Works Hallelujah now look listen to this brother brandom in another sermon this is calling Jesus on the scene 1963 we'll read this quote and then we'll we'll close he said then God all that God was someone say all how many things is he the head of all things oh do you believe it today all that God was he poured into Jesus and all that Jesus was he poured into his church he divided himself on the day of Pentecost he going to tell you how he did it he said that Pillar of Fire come down and busted itself up the shikina glory you remember what that was that's his visible presence the shikina is the visible presence of God that dwelt in the Tabernacle and later in Solomon's Temple the shakina glory oh my busted itself up and put it in different ones tongues of fire were seen upon each one the Holy Spirit God identifying him himself in human beings oh Church what was he doing when he come and took had the pillar of fire taken over brother bram's head what was God doing identifying himself brother Brandon was not the fullness he was one part of that body but God all that God was he poured into the church he busted himself up and he was over a prophet but he's in you I love the fact that when that when he was there visible as long as Moses was on the scene but when Joshua came on the scene the pillar of fire was not oh my the pillar of fire was not a visible light anymore do you know that it wasn't a visible light what happened brother said it become a man it become the captain of the host and he stood the whole M stood by the wall of Jericho I believe in this day the pillar of fire is become a people amen you believe that or not I I just choose to believe God's with us and the amount of God that'll be expressed through your life is directly correlated to how much you can believe yes right right how should they you say well how how will I believe you can't believe unless you hear you can't hear without a preacher oh my the word is being preached to you tonight and I challenge you to believe it and if you believe it all things are possible amen the BR said that Pillar of Fire God identifying himself in human beings listen to this talk about Amazing Grace How Sweet the Sound I didn't tell brother Joel to sing that but isn't it wonderful talk about Amazing Grace How Sweet the Sound what a secure it is he said how secure we feel am Amen to know that when we're driving on the highways whatever we're doing that Jesus lays in the ship oh Church well even before he was he woke up nothing could happen to that ship right oh yeah even before they went and had the prayer meeting and woke him up he still was God and the sh his purpose could not be defeated he had already told him we're passing over to the other side and he was the word he's already told you there's going to be a Rapture he's already told you we're going to make it to the other side why don't we just believe him tonight why don't we just believe him why don't we just appropriate the faith tonight say God you're going to take care of me sir amen he's just waiting for you to have faith to believe it and sometimes that's why he allows tests and trials to come come in our life just see what you'll do with it just waiting on you to have the faith to believe he is God look you so how secure we feel I think about those little babies if you'll allow me to digress for just a moment think about those little babies that in Africa and those little babies they wrap them up real tight and then they wrap them around the mama and they ride motorbikes so there'll be a family of five on a dirt bike and they'll be riding down the street I look at that all dressed up for Sunday I got a picture last time I was in Togo he's going around the big puddles it had rained going around the big puddles and the potholes you drive down one side drive up the other side he's driving all around him driving carefully because here's his whole family on the motorbike the girls in their Sunday dresses put us to shame the way they dress I mean they really would I'm not saying anything I'm not even wearing a tie tonight I'm not saying anything about that it's just what they do and they just they they look so pretty and I'm walking as as they go by there and I'm thinking them little girls on there and that little baby be see here here'll be a man and CH the wife will have his arms her arms around the man holding on and the baby is not being held on by anybody but it's secure it's wrapped up tight hallelujah it's wrapped up tight as it goes down the road you don't see them falling out all the time but they've learned how to wrap the baby in such a way that it'll wrap around them and it will actually stay Hallelujah and the mama will go about her work and everything else and that baby's so secure and you don't see them crying or fussing why they're wrapped up tight they feel secure oh I believe if we would really believe the word tonight that's how we would feel we'd feel like that little baby that's been wrapped up you know how they are when they're little newborns little infants they they get to want something you just wrap them up real tight and they feel secure why because they've been in the womb and they remember what that feels like well I remember there's something inside of me I don't remember with my mind but something inside of me speaks back to a time it remembers a time when I was in his mind and totally in his care and so when I ride down the highway I'm just as secure as that little baby wrapped up in the blanket listen because Jesus lays in the ship yes sir listen the one who can perform any Miracle musicians go ahead and come can do any anything someone say anything that he wants done hallelujah doing it again perfectly identify himself he is in our little boat as we're sailing life's solemn made sir listen to me families he's in your little your little home you're a little boat it's okay he's with you you say brother Ben you're just saying it's your job to say that no I'm saying it because I believe it I'm saying it because I couldn't face life unless I believed it life has been difficult enough for me and maybe not as difficult as it has been for you but it's been difficult for me life has been difficult enough that I could not face another day without the understanding that I'm wrapped up in the in the care of Jehovah that's right that he he he counts my steps and he knows what I'm going through he sent me a message to give a feeling of security sir amen he said the same as he was then so is he now what a feeling of security while sailing the troubled waters of life amen oh do you believe it tonight I challenge it if we could just believe it if we could just appropriate the faith to believe it well I love these Wednesday nights I know you're Believers if you're here but I know how we struggle because I struggle it's why God called human beings to speak to human beings I know how you struggle but I also know that if he has the preeminence all things are possible to them that believe if he has a preeminence he has jurisdiction it means I'm in his country he's the boss what a feeling of security that the great God of the universe lives in my body and in your body and we are prisoners of love to do only his will I think of I think of Crosby who wrote Blessed assurance Jesus is mine I believe she got a little Revelation there oh what a foraste of Glory Divine heir of Salvation purchased of God born of his Spirit wash in his blood and she sang out this is my story oh I want to say to you tonight this is my story this is what's kept me through all the years this is what will keep you this brother Daniel what's kept you all these years this is your story this is my song praising My Savior all the day long I have Blessed Assurance

it to him and go on go on as if it was already done amen because I sent the man to my house and I know he never fails I know I believe him I believe him more than I do some Tradesman coming fixing my Plumbing I believe him more than I even would the very best that there was because I know he's the God of all the universe he's got it in control and I know he loves me he cares about me would you
