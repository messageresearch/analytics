[9:31] but he's always come through.
[9:36] He has.
[9:39] Yes, he has.
[9:44] I tell him I'm not strong. He says
[9:49] I am.
[9:53] I say I can't go on. He says I can.
[10:01] I've not loved everyone.
[10:05] I've not always overcome.
[10:10] But he has.
[10:12] Yes, he has.
[10:18] He has
[10:22] been the greatest friend that I have
[10:25] ever
[10:27] known.
[10:29] Oh,

[10:35] paid a dead on Calary all

[12:48] he has.
[12:50] Yes, he has.
[12:59] [Applause]
[13:11] [Music]
[13:21] So many times I felt someone was
[13:25] watching over me.
[13:29] For there was too much on display.
[13:37] Like the day we went driving
[13:41] and my life was changed forever.
[13:45] The flames nearly took me that day.
[13:53] I could feel my heart racing
[13:57] as the grave of smoke and fire
[14:02] would seal my doom and claim another
[14:06] life.
[14:10] Like a hand from out of nowhere,
[14:14] I was lifted toward the sunlight.
[14:18] And with one breath, I knew that I
[14:22] survived.
[14:25] [Music]
[14:27] And now I know my keeper.
[14:31] I call him by his name.
[14:35] He's brought me through much danger.
[14:40] Spared me so much pain.
[14:43] He knew someday I'd see him. He was
[14:48] never far away.
[14:52] And now I know my keeper. I talk to him
[14:56] each day.
[15:01] I faced another fire.
[15:05] This one oh so vast.
[15:09] Millions there were helpless
[15:13] burning from their past.
[15:17] Satan thought that he would claim my
[15:21] sinful soul one day.
[15:25] But all in once a nail scored hand
[15:29] reached down and I was saved.
[15:41] Now I know my keeper.
[15:45] I call him by his name.
[15:49] He's brought me through much danger.
[15:53] cared through so much pain.
[15:57] He knew someday I'd see him. He was
[16:01] never far away.
[16:05] Now I know my keeper. I talk to him each
[16:10] day.
[16:15] And now I know my keeper.
[16:19] I call him by his name.
[16:23] He's brought me through much danger.
[16:28] Spared me so much pain.
[16:31] He knew someday I'd see him. He was
[16:36] never far away.
[16:40] And now I know my keeper. I talk to him
[16:44] each day.
[16:47] [Music]
[16:50] Now I know my keeper. I talked to him
[16:54] and Jesus is
[16:57] his name.

[21:12] you're under expectation and you're
[21:14] going to get what you came for this
[21:15] evening. Amen. Let's just put aside
[21:17] everything that would try to hinder us

[21:24] your blessing, don't let it stop you
[21:26] here tonight. Let's just open our hearts
[21:27] and receive from the Lord. How about

[21:33] And I just want to thank you, Lord,
[21:38] for letting me hear your word.
[21:43] What have I done to deserve such glory
[21:48] revealed in me?
[21:53] and thanks for that special night
[21:58] when I saw your glorious life.
[22:03] Came face to face with eternal life. Oh
[22:07] Lord, I thank thee.
[22:13] You didn't have to open my eyes.
[22:18] You could have easily passed me by.
[22:23] For the age I was living in was rich and
[22:29] poor and blind.
[22:33] And then I heard recognizing your name.
[22:38] Serpent sin and perfect faith.
[22:43] The bridge and the message of grace. And
[22:47] Lord I thank thee. We thank him now. And
[22:53] I just want to thank you, Lord,
[22:58] for letting me hear your word.
[23:03] What have I done to deserve such glory
[23:08] revealed in me?
[23:13] And thanks for that special life.
[23:18] When I saw your glorious light,
[23:23] came face to face with eternal life. Oh
[23:27] Lord, I thank thee. I like this verse.
[23:33] God, even in my wildest dreams,
[23:38] did I think I'd see such things
[23:43] as the coming of the Lord, the rapture
[23:49] mystery.
[23:53] Well, I have heard, but now I see
[23:58] God in simplicity.
[24:03] The spoken word is the original seed.
[24:07] And Lord, we all thank thee with all
[24:11] your hearts now. And I just want to
[24:15] thank you
[24:18] for
[24:20] hear your word.
[24:23] What have I done to deserve such glory
[24:29] revealed in me?
[24:33] And thanks for
[24:36] special life.
[24:38] When I saw
[24:41] glory
[24:43] came face to face with eternal life,
[24:48] Lord, I thank thee. Let's give him a
[24:53] hand of praise. Aren't you grateful?
[24:55] Aren't you grateful that you heard those
[24:57] things? Amen. We heard his word. Let's
[25:00] bow our heads together. It's good to be
[25:01] with you tonight and good to have our
[25:03] visitors tonight. Let's just offer a
[25:05] prayer to the Lord and just believe
[25:07] whatever we have need of tonight, he'll
[25:09] give that to us. Heavenly Father, Lord,
[25:11] we're so grateful to be in your presence
[25:13] once again. And Lord, we're so thankful
[25:16] that we've heard your word, Lord, that
[25:18] we could find a place of rest, oh God.
[25:21] Lord, our wandering soul would find a
[25:23] place that we can anchor in, Lord, and
[25:26] find a haven of rest. So thankful for
[25:29] that, Father. I pray that you'd bless
[25:30] your word tonight. Speak to us, Lord.
[25:33] Move me out of the way, Lord. I know
[25:36] you've done it before. I believe you can
[25:37] do it again. Pray that you'd move and
[25:40] speak to these people. I pray you'd heal
[25:41] the sick. Touch those that are in need.
[25:43] We pray in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen. God
[25:48] bless you. Mark chapter 6. Mark chapter
[25:51] 6 and verse 30. Verses 30 and 31.
[25:55] Kind of a different uh text uh tonight.
[25:58] uh Mark 6:30 and 31. I want to speak to
[26:02] you on rest.
[26:06] Maybe a little bit of a dangerous
[26:08] subject on a Sunday afternoon, but
[26:11] I've approached this before, but maybe
[26:13] just approach it in a little bit
[26:14] different way tonight. And I know I've
[26:17] we've talked about the subject of rest,
[26:19] but maybe take it a little bit
[26:21] differently tonight. Mark 6, chapter
[26:23] chapter 6, verse 30. The apostles
[26:25] gathered themselves together unto Jesus
[26:27] and told him all things, both what they
[26:30] had done and what they had taught. You
[26:32] remember he had sent them out and and
[26:34] told him, "Go heal the sick and cleanse
[26:36] the leper." And they had done all of
[26:37] that. And he said unto them, "Come ye
[26:42] yourselves apart into a desert place and
[26:46] rest a while." For there were many
[26:48] coming and going, and they had no
[26:50] leisure as much to eat. Pray the Lord
[26:53] would add his blessing to the word. You
[26:55] may be seated.
[27:00] Rest in the original is to give
[27:02] intermission from labor to give rest or
[27:05] to refresh. To refresh as we talked
[27:08] about this morning, how that it's in the
[27:11] quiet. Brother Rand said that's how we
[27:12] get our refreshing is by getting that
[27:15] alone time with God. Refreshing rest.
[27:19] There is no human being physically
[27:22] including Jesus himself who was as human
[27:25] as we are who does not need rest. There
[27:30] was a a a great theologian by the name
[27:32] of Philip Meanthan. He was a reformation
[27:35] theologian with Martin Luther and he
[27:38] come to Luther's house one day and he
[27:40] said today he said we're going to talk
[27:42] and discuss the governance of the
[27:44] universe and Luther uh spoke back to him
[27:49] and I guess he he'd done his done some
[27:52] work and he was tired and he said today
[27:55] he said you and I are going fishing and
[27:58] he said we'll leave the governance of
[27:59] the universe to God
[28:02] and you know there's time and a place
[28:04] for everything, right? The the
[28:07] philosopher Essop supposedly he had a
[28:10] someone come to him and criticize him
[28:12] because they saw him playing a
[28:14] children's game and they said, "There's
[28:15] so many more important things to do."
[28:18] And he said, "I want you to take your
[28:19] bow that you use, the old style of bow
[28:22] they would use for war and for hunting."
[28:25] He said, "I want you to take your bow,"
[28:27] he said, "and unstring it." And uh and
[28:30] so he unrung the bow and he says, "What
[28:32] does that teach you? What does the
[28:33] unstrung bow teach you? He said if you
[28:36] leave it strung, it will eventually
[28:38] break the bow. It will actually destroy
[28:41] the bow if you leave it strung long
[28:43] enough. He said at some point the bow
[28:45] has to be unstrung to be continue to be
[28:48] useful. And so that's what rest is. You
[28:51] can't remain under tension all the time
[28:54] or you end up not being useful. Can I
[28:56] get an amen tonight? Boy, I thought
[28:58] you'd all be jumping the aisles by now.
[29:00] you know, talking about rest and and and
[29:03] and this is a something that God has
[29:06] given us an ability to rejuvenate, to
[29:08] refresh ourselves
[29:10] from the things that we do even in the
[29:12] physical. Uh we find Elijah needed a
[29:15] place of rest. In first Kings chapter 19
[29:17] and verse 4, he was running from the
[29:20] word of a woman and he had just been
[29:22] through a great meeting. But brother
[29:23] Brandham talked about how that these
[29:25] prophets when they come out from under
[29:27] the anointing were uh would come under
[29:29] almost what we would call a depression
[29:31] and they begin to uh uh begin to uh
[29:34] begin to feel very down and and Elijah
[29:37] went through that. He ran from from
[29:38] Jezebel and he himself went a day's
[29:40] journey into the wilderness and came and
[29:42] sat down under a juniper tree and he
[29:45] requested for himself that he might die.
[29:47] He He may not have been suicidal, but he
[29:49] was close to it.
[29:51] &gt;&gt; And and he said, "It's enough now, oh
[29:53] Lord. Take away my life, for I am not
[29:55] better than my father's." And as he lay
[29:58] and slept under a juniper tree, behold,
[30:01] an angel touched him. I'm so glad God
[30:03] still got those angels today that can
[30:06] still touch us. I believe they're here
[30:07] tonight. Brother Brandon said, "If you
[30:09] could see beyond the veil of the flesh,
[30:11] you'd see angels at their position at
[30:13] every pew." I pray we can see that
[30:15] tonight. I pray we could we could enter
[30:17] into that realm where we could feel the
[30:19] presence of the angels that are here to
[30:22] help us. And and so he he said he the
[30:26] angel touched him and said, "Arise and
[30:28] eat." And he looked and behold there was
[30:31] a cake baking on the coals and a crews
[30:33] of water in his head and he did eat and
[30:35] drink and laid him down again. And you
[30:37] know it looked like Elijah needed a
[30:39] rebuke,
[30:40] &gt;&gt; right? It really did. Like it looked
[30:42] like this prophet needed a
[30:44] a a little kick. you know, and just
[30:46] angel needed to come down, give him a
[30:48] rebuke. But that's not what God gave
[30:49] him. He g send him an angel down to talk
[30:52] to him and give him something to eat and
[30:54] drink and laid him down again. And the
[30:56] angel of the Lord came again the second
[30:57] time and touched him and said, "Arise
[30:59] and eat because the journey is too great
[31:01] for thee." And he arose and did eat and
[31:04] drink and went in the strength of that
[31:05] meat 40 days and 40 nights and Horeb the
[31:08] mount of God. Brother Brandon said he
[31:10] sent an angel and the angel touched him
[31:12] and he went to sleep. And when he woke
[31:13] up, there was some corn cakes or some
[31:15] kind of cakes baked laying by the side
[31:17] of him. He said, "Elijah, rise up and
[31:19] eat." He said, "There's the grace of God
[31:22] to his servant." See, he's resting him.
[31:25] He's resting him. So rest is more. Even
[31:28] in physical rest, it's more than just
[31:30] laying down. Because there's lots of
[31:32] times you can lay down and not rest. And
[31:35] you might take time off work but not
[31:37] rest. You might go on vacation but not
[31:39] rest. But God said, "I'm going to send
[31:40] my angels down so that Elijah can rest."
[31:44] And he said, "You know, Jesus said,
[31:46] "Come aside into the wilderness and
[31:48] let's rest a little while." Some of
[31:50] these guys that think you don't have to
[31:52] have rest, he said, "We find out they
[31:55] burn out pretty quick, too."
[31:57] &gt;&gt; He said, "If they don't take rest, they
[31:59] find themselves wrecked up somewhere."
[32:02] He said, "I think that's where our
[32:03] brother Billy Graham is tonight, trying
[32:05] to overshoot the mark. These human
[32:06] bodies are strong, but they need rest.
[32:09] There was a time Billy Graham had to
[32:11] come off the field for a while because
[32:13] he was just wore out. And brother Brand
[32:15] was speaking about that. He said, "Then
[32:16] he said, then you can take a little rest
[32:18] and go somewhere and they'll criticize
[32:19] you and say, I I thought he was a
[32:21] preacher. Look at him out yonder on the
[32:22] bank fishing or something like that." He
[32:25] said, "But that doesn't matter. Jehovah
[32:26] will take care of his own. I'm thankful
[32:28] for that." And while he was laying there
[32:31] under the tree, wearied and upset, God
[32:34] quietened his nerves, he fed him. He
[32:37] woke him up again and fed him again and
[32:40] put him back to sleep. Brother Brandon
[32:42] in another place said, "The angel with
[32:44] the softest hands went down where Elijah
[32:47] was just to wipe his brow and touch him
[32:50] so that he so that it wouldn't disturb
[32:52] him while he slept." I believe God still
[32:54] cares that much about you, brother Wes.
[32:57] I believe he still cares enough to give
[32:58] us rest tonight even when we need it in
[33:01] the natural.
[33:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[33:03] &gt;&gt; And and he said, you know, he said, I've
[33:05] often wondered what was in those cakes.
[33:08] What kind of vitamin did he get in those
[33:09] cakes? He said, however, whatever there
[33:11] was in there, it lasted him 40 days and
[33:13] 40 nights. He went in the strength of
[33:15] those cakes. He said, God knows tonight.
[33:17] He said, I need some of them. I'm sure
[33:19] this church needs some of them. I'm
[33:21] going to say, I can use some of them
[33:22] cakes tonight. Use some of them
[33:24] vitamins. He said, "God knows this
[33:26] church needs some of them." He said,
[33:28] "Come aside from the world. Let's rest a
[33:30] while. Let's talk a while." He said,
[33:33] "You you don't have time to rest." You
[33:34] say, John Wesley said that one time. He
[33:37] said, "I'm afraid to rest. I ain't got
[33:38] time to rest." He said, "You find
[33:40] yourself broke up if you don't take
[33:43] these rests."
[33:45] &gt;&gt; Again, brother Brandham talking about
[33:47] his own ministry. He said, "Remember
[33:48] friends, I've been constantly in the
[33:50] field since Christmas. just constantly
[33:52] going till I'm really tired, really
[33:53] tired this afternoon. It'll be quite a
[33:55] while before I got some get some rest.
[33:57] He said, "I got a few days coming. I'm
[33:58] going right out now for three or four
[34:00] days rest." But anyone knows, now I I'll
[34:04] just be honest with you. I didn't know
[34:05] this, but Brother Brandon said, "Anyone
[34:07] knows that you can't rest in three or
[34:09] four days."
[34:10] &gt;&gt; He said, "You got to take a complete
[34:12] rest
[34:13] &gt;&gt; and build up again."
[34:15] &gt;&gt; And I'm going somewhere with this, so
[34:17] just hang with me. I know everybody's
[34:18] like, "Brother Ben, what are you
[34:19] promoting?" Well, I'm about to take some
[34:21] time off, but it's cuz I'm having teeth
[34:23] cut out, not cuz I'm resting.
[34:27] But but he said again, he said this. He
[34:30] said, "Now, this is my vacation time. As
[34:32] you know, I've preached since December,
[34:34] January, February, March, April, May,
[34:36] June, and July." He said, "Enough, God
[34:38] willing, and I need special call. This
[34:40] is the season I take my rest, my
[34:41] vacation. I go hunting." Can you
[34:44] imagine? You know, I heard a I heard a
[34:46] story here recently about a a youth
[34:48] group that went and and they uh went and
[34:51] had a Nerf battle in a vacant home and
[34:54] and uh somebody owned the home. They
[34:56] weren't in just break into somebody's
[34:57] home, but they were in someone's home in
[34:59] the church and they had a Nerf gun
[35:00] battle and they got so much criticism
[35:02] over that. And I I thought, you know, I
[35:05] don't think we ought to criticize people
[35:07] for doing things like that. You know, I
[35:09] I think we I think we need to understand
[35:12] I think we need to understand that
[35:14] sometimes people need an outlet. They
[35:17] need they need a rest. They need a
[35:19] break. And not everything we do, you
[35:22] know, that helps us spiritually is
[35:24] spiritual in itself. I'll say this, if
[35:27] you ate a good meal and and had a a good
[35:29] diet this week and exercised and did,
[35:31] it'll make you feel better in church.
[35:34] &gt;&gt; And when you feel better in church, you
[35:36] amen better. you you when you're better
[35:38] in your health, you're a you're better
[35:40] in your spiritual life. I know there's
[35:41] people feel like we got to be a bunch of
[35:43] Catholics and and and crawl over
[35:45] cobblestones and hurt ourselves in some
[35:48] way to be message believers, but brother
[35:50] Brandham didn't teach that at all.
[35:52] &gt;&gt; Right? We don't have to listen. I can't
[35:54] do a thing to buy my salvation. He
[35:56] already paid for my my my way. He
[35:58] already made a way for me. I my sins
[36:01] were judged in his body on the cross. I
[36:03] can't be judged for sin. and I want to
[36:05] do everything I can for him, but when I
[36:08] need rest, he's provided a way to to
[36:10] have rest.
[36:12] &gt;&gt; All right? So, he said, he said,
[36:15] "That'll be his will." He said, "If
[36:16] there's no certain call," he said, "If
[36:18] the Lord should call me to do something
[36:19] else, them things are out of the
[36:21] picture." So, we do have a
[36:22] responsibilities.
[36:23] But he said, "God is always first. I
[36:25] want him to be first. You want him to be
[36:26] first. But then, if there's no certain
[36:28] call, and that be his will, that's what
[36:30] I'm to do now for the next couple of
[36:31] months is to go hunting to rest myself."
[36:34] You all know I'm not doing that. So,
[36:36] just
[36:38] I'd be lost as a goose.
[36:41] So, I'd have to go with some of you and
[36:43] that wouldn't be very restful for you.
[36:47] He said, uh, he said, "I'm going hunting
[36:49] to rest myself." He said, "You don't
[36:51] realize the world will never know what I
[36:53] have to go through with." See, and it's
[36:54] just such a strain. No wonder the Lord
[36:56] told his disciples when he was walking
[36:58] with them, "Come apart into the desert.
[37:00] Rest a while." He said, "I realize it
[37:03] more every day." And especially as my
[37:05] days get more upon the earth. You see,
[37:07] as I get older, you realize it. You hear
[37:09] our pastor saying amen to that, too.
[37:11] Said, "We can realize we're not boys
[37:13] after we pass 50." So, I guess I still
[37:15] am a boy in that in by that definition.
[37:18] He says, "We're not boys after we pass
[37:20] 50 years old." He said, "Now, we got to
[37:21] have a little time."
[37:23] &gt;&gt; Got to have a little time. Brother
[37:25] Brandon still preached 75 sermons that
[37:27] year. That's a lot.
[37:31] And in 1965, he preached 50. And you'll
[37:33] find as he got older, he preached less.
[37:36] But I'm glad he took the time
[37:38] &gt;&gt; to preach marriage and divorce,
[37:40] &gt;&gt; right? A man running from the presence
[37:41] of the Lord. Seed is not air with the
[37:43] shuck. I'm glad he took the time to do
[37:46] it. And if he hadn't have taken the time
[37:48] off, he wouldn't have been able to
[37:49] preach like he preached. Are you with me
[37:51] now? I'm not just talking about
[37:53] preachers. I'm talking about all of us,
[37:56] right? We need to make sure that we're
[37:57] ready when we come to the house of God.
[37:59] Let's come ready. Let's come rested up
[38:01] and ready to not just be a throw it
[38:03] away, but that that the service could be
[38:05] what God wanted it to be because you
[38:07] don't know who might show up that might
[38:09] need a blessing, might need might need
[38:10] to be born again, might need to be
[38:13] changed in the presence of God and and
[38:15] the difference may be you being ready
[38:17] for the service may be the difference in
[38:19] them in life or death for them.
[38:22] &gt;&gt; Say, "God, help me to be ready."
[38:25] So, uh, you know, and I I I've got a
[38:28] special place in my heart for pastors
[38:29] because that's what I do. It's all I've
[38:31] ever wanted to do and in my life and
[38:34] just pastor a church. I don't want to
[38:36] never wanted a big church. I' I I've got
[38:38] we've got more than I can handle now.
[38:40] And we got this great responsibility
[38:42] with these children and things and and I
[38:45] I don't want any more than that. And yet
[38:47] God has given us a great responsibility.
[38:50] I've I've preached since I've been here
[38:52] over 500 sermons. I've never used the
[38:55] same set of notes twice. I'm not just
[38:57] telling you that. But pastors, I think
[38:59] some of y'all go to brother Jason's, you
[39:01] ought to thank God for your pastor and
[39:03] and treat him right. Because a pastor
[39:06] goes through things that people don't
[39:07] understand. And we don't understand what
[39:09] a prophet went through.
[39:10] &gt;&gt; Right. Just as much as a regular person
[39:12] may not understand what a pastor goes
[39:13] through, we do not understand what a
[39:16] prophet went through
[39:17] &gt;&gt; because I'm not a prophet. Someone say
[39:20] amen to that. I don't fight those
[39:22] spiritual battles like he did. He said,
[39:23] "I wasn't called to kiss babies." He
[39:25] said, "I was called to to carry a
[39:27] sword."
[39:28] &gt;&gt; Right? And and yet we do fight spiritual
[39:31] battles, but not like he did. But I'm
[39:33] not built for that either. God didn't
[39:34] call me to do that. And but God did call
[39:37] me to do something. And Jesus when he
[39:39] looked at his disciples, he didn't say,
[39:41] "Now I need to rest. So I'm going to go
[39:43] away for a while." But he said, "You
[39:45] need to rest."
[39:47] Right? He He didn't say, "I need to
[39:48] rest." He said, "You need to rest." Cuz
[39:50] he knew that they would not be ready.
[39:52] And there was something coming for them.
[39:55] &gt;&gt; There was a time coming they needed to
[39:56] be awake.
[39:58] &gt;&gt; There was a time coming they needed to
[40:00] be on fire. And so he wanted them to
[40:02] rest while they had the opportunity so
[40:04] that they could be on fire when the time
[40:06] come. Look, he recognized their human
[40:11] limitations
[40:12] because he was every bit as human as
[40:15] they were. Yeah,
[40:16] &gt;&gt; he grew weary. He felt pain. In Hebrews
[40:19] 4:15, it says, "We have not a high
[40:21] priest which cannot be touched with the
[40:23] feeling of our infirmities, but was in
[40:25] all points." Someone say, "All." He was
[40:27] in all points tempted like as we are yet
[40:30] without sin. He did not sin when he
[40:34] rested.
[40:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[40:36] &gt;&gt; Right.
[40:37] &gt;&gt; He did not sin. I know there's people
[40:39] think, well, you got to be out there 100
[40:41] 100% 100 hours a day if there was 100
[40:43] hours in a day. But Jesus did not sin
[40:45] when he rested. Some of us need to get
[40:47] that revelation.
[40:49] &gt;&gt; I know there's brothers that feel like
[40:50] they got to be working all the time. I
[40:52] believe in working. If a man doesn't
[40:54] work, the Bible said he shouldn't eat.
[40:57] &gt;&gt; Right? If he's able-bodied and able to
[40:58] work, he ought to have a job and work.
[41:01] &gt;&gt; If that job's washing dishes or or doing
[41:04] something, working at McDonald's, he
[41:06] ought to work somewhere if he's
[41:07] able-bodied. And yet, there's men that
[41:09] can't that are disabled and unable to
[41:11] work. And I thank God that that we have
[41:13] the ability to help people like that and
[41:15] that government helps them and things
[41:16] like that. I thank God for that. But yet
[41:18] if you're able to work, you need to
[41:20] work.
[41:21] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[41:24] &gt;&gt; Are you with me tonight? But you know
[41:26] you here uh you know there's a time when
[41:30] you got to recognize you've reached your
[41:32] limit,
[41:34] &gt;&gt; right? And you need to be present with
[41:36] your family.
[41:38] &gt;&gt; And you need to understand that they're
[41:40] not always going to come to you and ask
[41:42] you for advice.
[41:43] &gt;&gt; So if you blow them off right now, what
[41:45] about later?
[41:47] &gt;&gt; Right? When they were when you want them
[41:49] to come, wish he would ask me about that
[41:52] situation he's in and then you don't
[41:53] have any power to have him come to you.
[41:55] But while they are coming, while they
[41:56] are asking questions, I'm preaching to
[41:58] myself, too. Let's not just run them
[42:00] off. Let's let's take time for them.
[42:03] We can't do that if we're just
[42:04] constantly working.
[42:06] &gt;&gt; Good.
[42:07] &gt;&gt; Right now look again. I believe in
[42:09] working, but we got to rest too. Brother
[42:12] Brandon said Jesus was tempted like the
[42:14] Bible said he was tempted at all points
[42:15] like we are. Brother Brandon said he was
[42:16] tempted by drinking.
[42:19] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[42:21] &gt;&gt; He was tempted by women.
[42:24] &gt;&gt; I know we don't want to think about
[42:25] Jesus like that, but he was every bit as
[42:28] much human as we are.
[42:30] Come on.
[42:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[42:31] &gt;&gt; There was a difference. He never gave
[42:33] in.
[42:33] &gt;&gt; Right.
[42:34] &gt;&gt; He always overcame.
[42:36] &gt;&gt; We over We We give in sometimes, don't
[42:38] we?
[42:40] &gt;&gt; There's times we don't overcome. But
[42:42] Jesus never gave in.
[42:44] &gt;&gt; He was tempted by everything that we
[42:46] are. He was a man. Oh, it makes me feel
[42:48] better. It really does. There's
[42:50] something about that when we recognize
[42:51] that. Recognize Jesus knows what you're
[42:54] going through. He was a man and yet you
[42:57] couldn't put a mark on him. The Bible
[42:59] said he did no sin. Amen. Now I want you
[43:03] to contrast this what Jesus said come
[43:05] aside and rest with Luke chapter 9. Luke
[43:08] chapter 9 Jesus is fanatical when it
[43:11] comes to following the gospel.
[43:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[43:14] &gt;&gt; He he he's actually fanatical about it.
[43:17] Luke chapter 9 verse 57. It come to pass
[43:19] that as they went in the way a certain
[43:21] man said to him, "Lord, I will follow
[43:22] thee whethersoever thou goest." was
[43:24] verse 58. And Jesus said unto him,
[43:26] "Foxes have holes. Birds of the air have
[43:28] nests, but the Son of man hath not where
[43:30] to lay his head." He said, "I don't even
[43:31] have a home."
[43:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[43:34] &gt;&gt; Verse 59, he said unto another, "Follow
[43:37] me." But he said, "Lord, suffer me first
[43:40] to go and bury my father." That seems
[43:42] like a reasonable request.
[43:44] And Jesus said, "You're not going to
[43:46] work out." That was his job interview.
[43:51] And the guy says, "Before I can go to
[43:52] work, Lord, before I can follow you, let
[43:55] me let me go bury my father." And Jesus
[43:58] said, "Let the dead bury their dead, but
[44:00] go thou and preach the kingdom of God."
[44:02] That's almost brutal.
[44:04] &gt;&gt; Verse 61. Another also said, "Lord, I
[44:07] will follow thee, but let me first go
[44:09] bid them farewell which are at home at
[44:10] my house." And Jesus said to him, "No
[44:13] man having put his hand to the plow and
[44:15] looking back is fit for the kingdom of
[44:17] God."
[44:19] &gt;&gt; Right? Now, how can we reconcile that
[44:20] with someone said, "Let's go take a a
[44:22] vacation. Let's get away from the people
[44:25] for a while." That's what he told him.
[44:27] Now, remember, the people followed him
[44:28] and he ended up having to feed them. But
[44:31] thank God, we serve a God who can feed
[44:33] 5,000 with two loaves. And are you with
[44:36] me now? With five loaves and two fishes.
[44:39] But, but they don't seem like the same
[44:41] person. But you realize there's an
[44:43] appropriate time for everything. And
[44:45] when we have opportunity to serve in the
[44:47] kingdom of God, we ought to give it
[44:49] everything that we've got. Don't leave
[44:51] nothing back. Just just lay ourselves
[44:53] out for the kingdom of God. Press into
[44:55] the kingdom. Do everything we can while
[44:57] we have opportunity. Let's do it. We
[44:59] don't know how many services we we'll
[45:01] have. I Well, you say, "Brother Ben,
[45:02] it's it's Sunday afternoon or it's a
[45:05] Wednesday night or whenever it is."
[45:06] That's no excuse to not give everything
[45:08] to God.
[45:09] &gt;&gt; Let the dead bury their dead. Let's go
[45:11] have church.
[45:13] Are you with me now?
[45:15] &gt;&gt; But there's a time, an appropriate time
[45:16] for rest.
[45:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[45:18] &gt;&gt; Right. And so Jesus is teaching us that
[45:21] there's a time we need to give
[45:22] everything we've got while we're
[45:24] preaching. We ought to give everything
[45:25] we've got to our preaching. When we
[45:27] sing, we ought to give it everything
[45:28] we've got. We should not do anything
[45:30] half-hearted in the kingdom of God.
[45:33] &gt;&gt; And yet when when the appropriate time
[45:35] comes, we need to rest. We need to rest
[45:38] because there's coming a time we need to
[45:40] be rested so that we can stay awake,
[45:44] &gt;&gt; right? That's why we need to take our
[45:45] nap before church.
[45:50] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[45:52] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? Rest so that at the
[45:56] appropriate time
[45:58] &gt;&gt; you can stay awake.
[46:00] &gt;&gt; Jonah didn't make it. He wanted to sit
[46:01] up front, but he didn't make it.
[46:05] But now look, this same group of
[46:08] disciples
[46:10] come with Jesus to the garden of
[46:11] Gethsemane. And he knows they won't all
[46:13] stay awake.
[46:16] &gt;&gt; And that's all he wanted from them. He
[46:19] didn't ask them to intervene in any way.
[46:21] He just said, "Stay awake for me."
[46:24] &gt;&gt; Watch with me.
[46:27] &gt;&gt; It was a time they needed to be awake.
[46:30] &gt;&gt; Wasn't time to rest.
[46:31] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? But because they
[46:33] hadn't learned how to rest, they were
[46:37] sleepy at the wrong time. Remember what
[46:39] they'd been doing? They'd been arguing
[46:41] with each other
[46:43] &gt;&gt; over who was the greatest.
[46:46] &gt;&gt; And they got wore out.
[46:48] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. Fussing among
[46:50] preachers, among churches, who was the
[46:52] best.
[46:53] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[46:53] &gt;&gt; Who had the greatest church?
[46:56] &gt;&gt; It's not even worth our effort.
[46:58] &gt;&gt; Right?
[46:59] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? Not even worth the
[47:01] effort. we might as well. That it's just
[47:03] a waste of time.
[47:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[47:05] &gt;&gt; One trying to one up another. And they
[47:08] that's what they were doing. They were
[47:09] fussing over who got this seat in the
[47:11] kingdom and who got that one. And all
[47:12] the time Jesus had his face set toward
[47:14] Calvary.
[47:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[47:18] &gt;&gt; He said, "You need to rest up so you'll
[47:19] be ready." And they didn't do it. At the
[47:21] Garden of Gethsemane, all he wanted was
[47:23] for them to stay awake. The Bible says
[47:25] Mark 14:35, he took Peter, James, and
[47:28] John and brought them a little bit
[47:30] closer than he did the others. And he
[47:32] went forward a little. Another place
[47:33] said he went a little further. I'm glad
[47:35] he went further than we could. He went
[47:37] forward a little and fell on the ground
[47:38] and prayed that if it were possible, the
[47:40] hour might pass from him. And he said,
[47:43] "Aba, Father, all things are possible
[47:46] unto thee. Take away this cup from me.
[47:49] Nevertheless, not what I will, but what
[47:51] thou wilt." Yeah.
[47:53] &gt;&gt; And he cometh and findeth them sleeping
[47:56] and sith unto Peter, Simon, this is no
[47:59] time for a nap.
[48:02] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. People are wore out,
[48:05] stressed out.
[48:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[48:08] &gt;&gt; Can't listen in church.
[48:11] I'm preaching to all of us now.
[48:13] &gt;&gt; And it's not the time,
[48:15] &gt;&gt; right? To be resting. The time to rest
[48:19] is when we can get away from everything.
[48:21] Take the opportunity to get away and get
[48:23] along with God and things like that.
[48:24] There is a time for rest. But now he
[48:26] said it's the time to be awake. He said
[48:29] he he said, "Are you sleeping?" He said,
[48:31] "Could us not thou watch one hour? Watch
[48:34] ye and pray lest you enter into
[48:36] temptation. The spirit truly is ready,
[48:38] but the flesh is weak."
[48:40] &gt;&gt; Again, he went away and prayed and spake
[48:42] the same words. When he returned, he
[48:43] found them asleep again, for their eyes
[48:45] were heavy. You ever been in a service
[48:48] where your eyes were heavy
[48:50] &gt;&gt; and it didn't matter how much the
[48:51] preacher shouted and screamed and run
[48:53] the aisles and spit and hollered and
[48:55] whatever your eyes get heavy and you get
[48:57] to the place where you you're almost in
[48:59] that position right now and you're just
[49:00] propping them open with toothpicks.
[49:04] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[49:06] That's the way the disciples were. Their
[49:07] eyes were heavy.
[49:11] &gt;&gt; You needed to rest
[49:14] &gt;&gt; when you had time to rest.
[49:17] And now their eyes were heavy. Neither
[49:19] whisked they what to answer him. They
[49:21] had no excuses. Lord, we're just tired.
[49:25] &gt;&gt; Said, "Don't you realize this is the
[49:26] greatest moment of the universe?"
[49:28] &gt;&gt; I'm about to pay for all of your sins.
[49:31] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[49:31] &gt;&gt; Could you not watch with me for one
[49:33] hour?
[49:34] &gt;&gt; But that's the weakness of human flesh,
[49:36] isn't it?
[49:37] &gt;&gt; Said the spirit is willing, but the
[49:38] flesh is weak. But I'm so glad that when
[49:41] my flesh is weak and I don't do all that
[49:43] I should do, he takes up the gap and he
[49:45] goes a little further and he stays awake
[49:47] when I don't and he's and he's ready
[49:49] when I'm not.
[49:51] &gt;&gt; So grateful for that.
[49:53] &gt;&gt; It didn't stop him from doing what God
[49:55] called him to do. But it would have been
[49:57] nice if they could have stayed awake.
[50:00] He cometh the third time and saith unto
[50:02] them, "Sleep on." Now third time he
[50:04] comes, he don't even wake them up.
[50:07] He said, "Just keep sleeping.
[50:10] It's enough. Take your rest. It's
[50:12] enough. The hour has come. Behold, the
[50:14] Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of
[50:17] sinners. Rest when it is appropriate, so
[50:20] that when you need to be awake, you can
[50:21] be awake. Some of you out there saying,
[50:25] "Brother Ben, this has nothing to do
[50:26] with me." You might be surprised.
[50:30] There was two wood choppers one time had
[50:32] a wood chopping contest and and they're
[50:34] just they're just going at it, you know,
[50:35] and they're both they're both chopping
[50:37] wood and and but the one he takes a
[50:39] break about every 15 minutes, you know,
[50:41] and sits down and gets back up and chops
[50:44] more wood and then he takes another
[50:45] break and takes a long lunch and and the
[50:48] other one chops wood all day. He don't
[50:50] take lunch. You don't do just like a
[50:52] young preacher, you know, he just just
[50:54] 100 miles an hour, you know, he just
[50:56] ready going for it. And he's just
[50:59] disgusted by this other guy. He said,
[51:00] "How in the world is he chopping more
[51:02] wood than I am?" And the guy said, "The
[51:05] problem is you don't what you didn't
[51:06] realize was, well, while you thought I
[51:08] was resting, I was sharpening my axe,
[51:13] right? He took time off
[51:15] &gt;&gt; to stay sharp,
[51:18] right? so that he could cut some wood.
[51:21] I'm preaching to somebody tonight. I'm
[51:23] not sure who it is.
[51:26] &gt;&gt; You know, when David, we talked about
[51:28] David, Solomon building the temple.
[51:30] David writes Psalm 127 for Solomon.
[51:34] &gt;&gt; He writes it for Solomon. And he writes
[51:36] this in verse one. Except the Lord build
[51:39] the house.
[51:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[51:43] &gt;&gt; you got a great house to build, Solomon.
[51:45] But except the Lord build the house.
[51:47] They labor in vain that build it.
[51:51] &gt;&gt; Ultimately, it's got to be the Lord.
[51:53] Solomon, you're if you you you got to
[51:55] what? Do these things in the appropriate
[51:57] time. Except the Lord keep the city. The
[52:00] watchman waketh, but in vain.
[52:02] &gt;&gt; It's vain for you to rise up early, to
[52:05] sit up late, to eat the bread of
[52:06] sorrows. For so he giveth his beloved
[52:10] sleep.
[52:12] &gt;&gt; Oh, I believe he still does that today.
[52:15] I believe it's there for us if we could
[52:18] just step aside and take a rest. Come
[52:21] aside and rest, he said. Now, we know
[52:23] there's a physical rest, a mental rest,
[52:25] and a spiritual rest. And just by
[52:27] looking at you, I know that you need all
[52:29] three.
[52:32] I know I do. We need all three. See,
[52:36] some people can never rest because their
[52:38] brain won't shut off.
[52:41] Those of you who are like me who
[52:42] overthink things,
[52:45] you you know what I'm talking about.
[52:48] &gt;&gt; Others have physical problems. Keep them
[52:50] awake at night. Brother Bill, I Bill
[52:52] told me I had a bad night. I I didn't
[52:54] know that when I had these notes and
[52:55] things ready, but uh you know, I've been
[52:57] there. I know what that's like. But as
[52:59] you get older, that's becomes more and
[53:00] more frequent. You can't rest because
[53:02] physically you've got problems. I
[53:03] believe we have a healer tonight
[53:06] &gt;&gt; who can heal that, take care of that
[53:08] &gt;&gt; so he can give his beloved sleep and and
[53:11] and others need spiritual rest and and
[53:15] but sometimes one type of uh rest or one
[53:18] type of ailment leads to another. So a
[53:20] person might have a physical problem
[53:21] that leads to their brain not shutting
[53:22] off or their brain won't shut off
[53:24] because and it causes physical problems.
[53:27] &gt;&gt; So brother Brandon was speaking to a man
[53:28] in the prayer line. He said the man is
[53:30] going from me. This isn't a a dime store
[53:35] discernment right here. This isn't one
[53:38] you find on the on the cheapo aisle on
[53:40] on the clearance rack at Walmart. This
[53:43] is real discernment. He said, "The man
[53:45] is going away from me years ago. Your
[53:47] trouble started. You probably look 15
[53:49] years or more younger than what you are
[53:51] now. It's a nervous condition. You've
[53:53] been bothered with a nerve trouble." He
[53:55] said, "I see you can't sleep. You're up
[53:58] pacing around restless. It's a nerve
[54:00] cause you." He said, "You don't know
[54:02] what it is. Doctors can't locate what it
[54:05] is. They don't know what it is." But
[54:08] Brother Brandon was about to tell him
[54:09] what it was.
[54:11] He said, "Here's what it is. As a child,
[54:15] he was playing near a seller steps." The
[54:18] man himself didn't know what happened.
[54:20] But can you imagine what it must have
[54:21] been to be standing there and hearing
[54:23] this and then realizing, "Yes, I
[54:25] remember."
[54:29] As a child, you was playing near a
[54:30] seller steps and you fell and it's put a
[54:34] put a vertebrae that's slightly out in
[54:37] the back. This is like an advertisement
[54:39] for chiropractors.
[54:43] Cuz he said there's a vertebrae that's
[54:45] slightly out in the back. There's your
[54:47] trouble.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; He said you're nervous. You can't sleep
[54:51] at night. And he traced the trouble all
[54:52] the way back to falling as a child and a
[54:55] vertebrae is slightly out in the back.
[54:57] He said you didn't come from this city.
[54:58] You come from another city, a river.
[55:00] It's New Jersey. Camden, New Jersey.
[55:02] Your name is Frank. They call you Frank
[55:03] Sack. He said, "You're healed, sir. Your
[55:05] faith has made you well. Go on your
[55:06] road. God has made you well."
[55:09] &gt;&gt; What was it? He had to he had to Brother
[55:11] Brandham had to tell him, "What's wrong
[55:12] with you? It's not what you think is
[55:14] wrong with you."
[55:16] &gt;&gt; Right. Again, he told someone, "You
[55:18] believe with all your heart, you want to
[55:19] get over nervous condition." Uh-huh.
[55:21] Yes. And you have such a nervous
[55:23] condition, it makes poor circulation.
[55:24] Your hands go numb and your feet and
[55:26] extremely nervous. Then you can't sleep
[55:27] at night. He said, "I see you lying in
[55:29] the bed and you keep raising up looking
[55:31] for a time, looking towards the window.
[55:34] Very nervous." That's true. Only God can
[55:36] heal you. Some of y'all constantly
[55:38] looking at your watches, you know,
[55:39] looking back at the back. God needs to
[55:41] heal you of that. You know,
[55:45] he said you're always looking out a
[55:46] window, very nervous. Only God can hear
[55:48] you. Would you come near while I ask
[55:49] him? Sorry, heavenly father, bless this
[55:51] woman who I bless in thy name. May thy
[55:53] spirit come upon her. Rebuke the evil
[55:55] spirit and say to him, "Lay this woman
[55:56] in Jesus Christ's name." Amen. He said,
[55:58] "Now you're quiet. It has left you. You
[56:01] feel quiet now." That's right, isn't it?
[56:04] If it is, raise your hand. He said, "Now
[56:05] it will always stay from from you if you
[56:09] just keep on believing. It will always
[56:11] stay from you if you just keep on
[56:13] believing." When you come up, something
[56:15] was even trying to hold you back. When
[56:16] you How many times have you experienced
[56:18] that? You wanted to come up for prayer
[56:20] and something was keeping you back.
[56:21] Brother Brandham, identified that as the
[56:23] devil. Yeah.
[56:24] &gt;&gt; He said he said you something was trying
[56:26] to keep you from coming. He said that
[56:27] that is right, isn't it? Wave your hand.
[56:29] It was the devil. He didn't want you to
[56:31] get here. Just like he didn't want you
[56:33] to come to this service tonight. He
[56:34] didn't want you to be here for he knows
[56:36] Jesus is here and he knew he'd have to
[56:39] leave and you're the witness yourself.
[56:41] He said, "Now go home and sleep like a
[56:43] baby." Oh, I tell you what, I believe
[56:45] God's still that same God today. He's
[56:47] still Jehovah Gyra.
[56:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. He said that's your husband.
[56:53] another case, that's your husband
[56:54] praying for your lady, right? He's
[56:55] trying to contact God. You are too. You
[56:57] got a prayer card to come in this line.
[56:59] If you believe what I tell you, he said,
[57:00] "You're praying, wasn't you, sir? If you
[57:02] believe, you won't have to."
[57:04] &gt;&gt; That's powerful.
[57:06] &gt;&gt; He said, "Your nerves was give way on
[57:08] you. Can't sleep at night in a terrible
[57:10] shape. You're not from here either.
[57:12] You've come from the north coming south.
[57:13] You've come from a big city where
[57:14] there's a river runs through the city."
[57:16] That's right. Oh, you've been a long
[57:17] time this way, haven't you, lady? And
[57:18] you've been healed once, too. A cancer
[57:20] or something. That's right. some kind of
[57:22] a condition that was with you and God
[57:23] made you well. Now listen what how how
[57:26] bad she had gotten. He said now you have
[57:29] you call preachers and things to pray
[57:32] for you and things like that to make
[57:34] yourself rest at night.
[57:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; I know if somebody wants to call me so
[57:42] that they'll rest, go ahead and do it.
[57:44] I'm perfectly fine with that. But look
[57:47] what she had gotten to. She actually had
[57:48] to call. So, you know, it was a
[57:51] spiritual problem. It was a mental
[57:52] thing. It wasn't a physical thing, but
[57:55] it was something in her spirit, in her
[57:56] soul, and or something in her in her
[57:59] spirit. And and she begins, she has to
[58:01] call a preacher to even go to sleep.
[58:05] Maybe that's just cuz preachers put her
[58:07] to sleep, but
[58:10] preacher sleep hotline. You know,
[58:16] you know, they have these apps now. I'm
[58:18] sorry. I'm having a good time in the
[58:21] house of God tonight. Are you glad to be
[58:23] in the house of the Lord tonight? Praise
[58:25] the Lord. I uh they have these apps now
[58:27] that make you sleep calm and and apps
[58:29] like that. You know what they are. You
[58:30] all use them just like I do. And they
[58:32] play this music. I found old there's
[58:35] there was an old radio program back in
[58:38] the day called Songs in the Night with
[58:39] Moody Radio. I loved that cuz that
[58:41] preacher would put me to sleep faster
[58:43] than anything
[58:45] and some of those those songs and but
[58:48] they've got this calm app. We ought to
[58:50] start an app just for preachers just to
[58:52] talk, you know, so you can go to sleep.
[58:59] Brother Joel will be the most downloaded
[59:02] sermons on there.
[59:07] My daughter told me one time, you can
[59:08] laugh a little. It's okay.
[59:11] My daughter told me one time, she said,
[59:14] she said, "Dad," she said, "you're not
[59:15] my favorite preacher." Melody told me
[59:17] this, and you're not my favorite
[59:19] preacher. And I said, "Why not?" She
[59:21] said, "Well," she said, "I like Brother
[59:22] Ivy." And I said, "Why?" She said, "He's
[59:24] long-winded. I can sleep through his
[59:25] sermons."
[59:27] And Brother Joel had just started
[59:28] preaching back then. He was a little
[59:30] shorter. And and she said, "I like
[59:32] Brother Joel." And I said, "Why?" I
[59:33] said, "Why?" She said, "Well, I can stay
[59:34] awake through his sermons and they're
[59:35] short."
[59:37] So, I guess I was somewhere down the
[59:39] list.
[59:43] Whatever helps.
[59:45] This lady needed to call preachers at
[59:47] night just to make yourself rest. He
[59:49] said, "You believe with all your heart
[59:50] that Jesus Christ make you well. You
[59:52] believe that his power will now heal
[59:54] you. You got to take a hold quickly,
[59:55] sister." Brother Brandon would
[59:57] constantly say this. You need to you
[59:59] need to respond quickly,
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; right? When when when the spirit moves,
[1:00:02] that's the time to move.
[1:00:04] It'll be like David listening for them
[1:00:06] rustle of the malberry bushes and when
[1:00:08] it's time to move it's time to move.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; Said if you will with all your heart
[1:00:13] Jesus Christ will make you well. Look at
[1:00:16] another one. Another example. Look how
[1:00:18] an entire family can suffer with no
[1:00:19] rest. Listen. Brother says, "Now you're
[1:00:23] here." He said, "I see you now. People
[1:00:24] can still hear me." He said, "The woman
[1:00:26] is having a sleepless time. She can't
[1:00:28] sleep." That's right. You're you're
[1:00:29] getting sick, too. You can't hardly eat.
[1:00:32] You're getting very sick. You're afraid
[1:00:34] it's gallstones. That's right. You're
[1:00:36] right. Sick, nausea, feeling. There's
[1:00:38] somebody else you're interested in.
[1:00:39] That's your husband. He has kind of a
[1:00:41] nervous mental nervousness. Kind of a
[1:00:43] real mental nervous. So, she's afraid
[1:00:45] she's got gallstones. She can't sleep.
[1:00:47] Her husband's got a mental nervousness.
[1:00:50] He's bothered with some kind of trouble
[1:00:51] he's in. Now, look how how it manifested
[1:00:54] differently in the different members of
[1:00:55] the family. She was worried about her
[1:00:57] about being sick and he's worried about
[1:00:59] something, too. Can you imagine some of
[1:01:01] the fusses that might have happened in
[1:01:02] that home?
[1:01:03] like the the the the brother look at the
[1:01:05] sister and say, "You don't understand me
[1:01:07] what I'm going through. I'm worried
[1:01:09] about something." And her be like,
[1:01:10] "Well, you're not even paying any
[1:01:12] attention to me. And here I'm hurting
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; and it's just the devil."
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; Right. And look, he said he said he was
[1:01:20] trying to get something, a business
[1:01:22] deal. It's a pension or something. He's
[1:01:23] trying to get it. That's right. A
[1:01:24] pension. So, he's concerned. He's
[1:01:26] nervous because he's trying to get his
[1:01:27] pension, provide for his family. He
[1:01:30] said, "I see a little boy." Now, these
[1:01:32] are obviously older people. And then he
[1:01:35] said, "I see a little boy. He's about 12
[1:01:37] years old, something like that. He's
[1:01:38] just a little fellow and he's really not
[1:01:41] your son." Said, "You've raised him and
[1:01:44] there's something you think that he has
[1:01:46] something went wrong with him."
[1:01:49] Now, I don't want to take a show of
[1:01:50] hands now, but how many of you mothers
[1:01:52] and fathers, especially you moms, you
[1:01:54] really thought something was wrong with
[1:01:55] your kid, and there wasn't nothing wrong
[1:01:56] with him,
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; but you really thought it was because
[1:01:59] you're concerned about your child.
[1:02:01] That's right.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; But but he was con she was concerned
[1:02:03] about this boy. It wasn't hers. They're
[1:02:05] older and that can introduce chaos in a
[1:02:07] home. Right? When you got an older
[1:02:10] couple with a younger child and he said
[1:02:14] he's just a little fellow. You've raised
[1:02:15] him or something. You think that
[1:02:16] something has went wrong with him. He
[1:02:18] isn't. He's just a little boy.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; He'll be all right. Sure. It's okay.
[1:02:24] Believe the right thing.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; Oh, I hope you're hearing me tonight.
[1:02:28] Believe the right thing. How many can do
[1:02:31] that tonight? What things should I
[1:02:33] believe? What God said about you?
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; What the word says about you. Believe
[1:02:38] the right thing. Believe that you're
[1:02:39] saved. Believe that you're healed.
[1:02:41] Believe that you're delivered. Believe
[1:02:43] that everything's going to be okay.
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; Believe the right thing. Everything will
[1:02:48] be all right.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; Go believing it. God bless sister. He
[1:02:51] said, "By the way, do you believe God
[1:02:52] can tell me who you are? You believe God
[1:02:54] can tell me, lady, Mrs. Red?" He said,
[1:02:56] "That's who you are. That's right. And
[1:02:58] then he speaks to the 12-year-old who
[1:03:00] must have been there. He said, "Sunny,
[1:03:01] it's all right. You mind your auntie.
[1:03:03] She thought something had happened, but
[1:03:05] it hasn't. You're just a little boy. You
[1:03:08] don't mean to do that. Go ahead. You'll
[1:03:10] be all right."
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; They were all worried. He's worried
[1:03:16] about a pinchion he may or may not get.
[1:03:18] She's worried about gallstones she
[1:03:19] doesn't have. Did you notice, Brother
[1:03:20] Brand never said, "You have gallstones."
[1:03:22] He said, "You think it's gallstones."
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; Right. And she's worried about her
[1:03:26] little boy who 12 years old who's acting
[1:03:29] like a 12-year-old,
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; right? And all of them got this. I
[1:03:36] shouldn't have preached on rest. And all
[1:03:38] of them are all of them are all upset
[1:03:41] and and brother Brandon said, "You just
[1:03:42] need to believe the right things."
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; How many of us could do that tonight?
[1:03:46] Oh, I want to believe the right thing.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; Come inside and rest. Not but but we
[1:03:51] don't just want to rest physically but
[1:03:53] for mental and spiritual strain.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; Right. Jesus recognized not only not
[1:04:00] only the disciples needed rest but the
[1:04:02] people needed rest. They needed rest
[1:04:04] from running from one feast to another
[1:04:06] and and one ordinance to another and one
[1:04:09] law to another and and and one one place
[1:04:12] to one rabbi to another trying to get
[1:04:14] somebody that can feed them. And and
[1:04:16] they're they're they're running back and
[1:04:17] forth. And Jesus comes up to them. Give
[1:04:19] me that next sign. Jesus comes to him,
[1:04:21] begins to cry, "Come unto me."
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; All you that are searching around for
[1:04:27] just the right preacher to help you,
[1:04:29] just the right church or just the right
[1:04:30] thing, come unto me. That's what we need
[1:04:33] is to come unto him.
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; Come unto me all ye that labor and are
[1:04:37] heavy laden. He said, "And I will give
[1:04:39] you rest."
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; I will give you rest. What was he
[1:04:43] talking about? The restlessness of
[1:04:44] searching for a redeemer, searching for
[1:04:47] somebody like the dove who was looking,
[1:04:49] remember when the dove was released from
[1:04:51] the ark the first time, it had nowhere
[1:04:53] to go. Brother said the dove would not
[1:04:55] sit on a carcass of an animal,
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; So it oh God, it couldn't sit there and
[1:05:00] so it was restless. It could not find
[1:05:02] any place of rest
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; until it come back to the ark. And Jesus
[1:05:06] said, I am the ark. I am the place of
[1:05:09] safety. Come unto me all ye that are
[1:05:11] labor. He's still that place of safety
[1:05:13] today. He's still our place of rest.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon talked about that three
[1:05:18] rooms in your house. He talked about the
[1:05:20] the kitchen and and the parlor and he
[1:05:23] said that was the outer courts in the
[1:05:25] tabernacle and the inner court of the
[1:05:26] tabernacle. But the Holy of Holies is
[1:05:28] the bedroom. He said the bedroom was a
[1:05:30] place of rest.
[1:05:33] Oh church, it's a place of rest. It's a
[1:05:35] place where we can go and we can realize
[1:05:38] everything's been taken care of. We're
[1:05:40] safe and secure. where in Jesus Christ
[1:05:44] ran from one teacher to another, from
[1:05:46] one doctrine to another trying to please
[1:05:48] God. And Jesus said, "Come unto me."
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; And rest.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; Our rest is the Holy Ghost. Hebrews
[1:05:55] chapter 4 and verse 9. There remainth
[1:05:57] therefore a rest to the people of God.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; Now, we're talking about spiritual rest.
[1:06:02] You need physical rest. We all do.
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; We need
[1:06:09] mental rest.
[1:06:11] Got to give yourselves a break sometime.
[1:06:13] Give yourself some credit.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; But we also need to know that he is our
[1:06:21] rest.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is our rest. The Bible
[1:06:27] say he for he that has entered into his
[1:06:29] rest, he also hath ceased from his own
[1:06:31] works as God did from his. Isaiah 28:10
[1:06:37] says, "For precept must be upon precept,
[1:06:40] line upon line, here a little, there a
[1:06:42] little. For with stammering lips and
[1:06:44] another tongue, will he speak to this
[1:06:46] people to whom he said, this is the
[1:06:49] rest, wherewith you may cause the weary
[1:06:51] to rest." And this is the refreshing.
[1:06:54] Yet they would not hear. The Jewish
[1:06:57] people would not hear. They were blinded
[1:06:58] for our sakes. But he said, "Here it is
[1:07:01] prophesied right here in Isaiah." And it
[1:07:03] come to pass about 700 years later at
[1:07:04] Pentecost when they were all filled with
[1:07:07] the Holy Ghost exactly as it was said
[1:07:09] they would be. This is the true Sabbath
[1:07:12] that was promised. Thus, when they were
[1:07:14] filled with the Holy Ghost, they ceased
[1:07:16] from their worldly works, their worldly
[1:07:18] doings, their evil ways. The Holy Ghost
[1:07:20] took charge of their lives. They entered
[1:07:23] into rest.
[1:07:26] There is your rest. That is your
[1:07:30] Sabbath. So thankful for that. Brother
[1:07:32] Bill, there's times we can't sleep at
[1:07:34] night. There's times physically we just
[1:07:37] don't have the rest that we should have
[1:07:39] and we haven't taken enough time or been
[1:07:41] smart about the way we did things and so
[1:07:42] we find ourselves worn out and
[1:07:44] overworked and all of those things.
[1:07:46] There's times our mind just won't shut
[1:07:48] off and we got too many things going on
[1:07:50] and you know what I'm talking about
[1:07:51] church and it feels like you can't pay
[1:07:53] all the bills and you can't take care of
[1:07:54] the kids and you can't do what you need
[1:07:56] to do and you feel down on yourself and
[1:07:58] you get depressed and worried. But
[1:08:00] remember, even during that time, you've
[1:08:03] entered into the holy place. You've gone
[1:08:05] beyond the outer court. You've gone
[1:08:06] beyond the court of the Gentiles. You're
[1:08:08] inside. And when you're inside, that is
[1:08:10] your place of rest. Listen to me. No
[1:08:12] matter what happens in your life, no
[1:08:14] matter how hard the trial is, no matter
[1:08:16] how deep the valley is or how high the
[1:08:18] mountain is, you are still a son of God.
[1:08:20] You are still a daughter of God. When I
[1:08:22] get to worry about the ministry and I
[1:08:24] get worried and thinking nobody wants to
[1:08:26] hear me. And I I get to a place where I
[1:08:28] get all down and upset. I remember I'm
[1:08:30] still a son of God. Even if I fail in my
[1:08:33] preaching, I'm still a son of God. Even
[1:08:35] if I can't do what I want to do around
[1:08:37] the church, I'm still a son of God.
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; Even when I'm frustrated because I can't
[1:08:41] physically do what I need to do, I'm
[1:08:43] still a son of God. And nothing can
[1:08:45] change that. I could fail in every other
[1:08:47] aspect of my life, but I'm still a son
[1:08:49] of God. You might be struggling with
[1:08:51] work, but you're still a son of God. You
[1:08:53] might be struggling with your kids, but
[1:08:55] you're still a daughter of God.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me tonight?
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. If this was the last
[1:09:02] message, I want you to rest. It may
[1:09:04] maybe if it was the last time, and it
[1:09:07] won't be. I believe that with all my
[1:09:08] heart, but if it was the last time I'd
[1:09:09] ever preached to you, remember you can
[1:09:11] rest in the promises of God. You can
[1:09:13] rest in what he said when he said, "Come
[1:09:15] unto me all you that labor and are heavy
[1:09:17] laden, and I will give you rest." You
[1:09:18] can rest in the fact that you're a
[1:09:20] predestined child of God, elected before
[1:09:22] the foundation of the world, that you
[1:09:24] were in his mind, that you are chosen in
[1:09:26] him before the foundation of the world.
[1:09:28] You can rest in that. You can rest in
[1:09:30] the fact that he sent the message by
[1:09:32] your way. You said, "Brother Ben, are
[1:09:33] you trying to make us feel better about
[1:09:35] ourselves?" No, I'm telling you the
[1:09:36] truth if you'll receive it. I'm If you
[1:09:38] just let it in, I'm telling you what God
[1:09:40] says about you.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; Come on. When are we going to listen? We
[1:09:45] listen to everything the devil had to
[1:09:47] say about us. We've listened to
[1:09:48] everything the church had to say about
[1:09:50] us. We've listened to everything the
[1:09:52] internet has to say about us. When are
[1:09:53] we going to listen to what God has to
[1:09:55] say about us?
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, we care so much about what everybody
[1:10:01] else says. But Lord, what are you
[1:10:02] thinking? He says, "You're my child.
[1:10:04] You're my chosen ones."
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; Good.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; There's your wrath.
[1:10:15] Hallelujah. That is your Sabbath. It's
[1:10:18] not a day nor a year, but the eternity
[1:10:21] of being filled and blessed in the Holy
[1:10:23] Spirit. It is you ceasing
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; and God doing.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; It is God in you willing and doing of
[1:10:33] his good pleasure.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; Jesus
[1:10:41] was at rest. He did just what the father
[1:10:45] told him to do. He didn't have to prove
[1:10:47] nothing,
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; right? He went to the pool of Beth
[1:10:50] Bethea and he knew he'd be criticized
[1:10:53] for walking through that pool and all
[1:10:55] them people sitting there and they found
[1:10:56] out, well, you were here. Why didn't you
[1:10:57] empty the hospital?
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; But that wasn't his purpose. He didn't
[1:11:01] care about the criticism. Brother
[1:11:02] Brandon said, "We should walk
[1:11:03] unconscious of criticism."
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; Right. And he didn't care about that. He
[1:11:08] just wanted to do the will of the
[1:11:09] father. So he went to the one who could
[1:11:10] receive help, the one that was elected
[1:11:13] to get up off his c. And oh my went to
[1:11:17] that one. I'm so glad he came to me.
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; He went to that one laying there and
[1:11:21] said, "Do you want to be well?" And they
[1:11:23] he said, "Yes, but I don't know how to
[1:11:24] be. Every time I get up, I can't make it
[1:11:26] to the water." And there was the well of
[1:11:28] water right there. He said, "If you want
[1:11:30] to be well, pick up your bed and walk."
[1:11:31] And he walked away. A well, man. Jesus
[1:11:34] didn't have to prove nothing to nobody.
[1:11:36] He didn't have to prove how
[1:11:37] compassionate he was. He just did the
[1:11:38] will of the father. Oh, that we could be
[1:11:40] that way.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, God. Not that we we want to love
[1:11:44] people. We want to do everything we can
[1:11:46] for people. But listen, the best thing
[1:11:48] we can do is the will of the father.
[1:11:50] That's right.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; It's your Sabbath. It's your rest. Oh,
[1:11:54] that people might come into him and find
[1:11:56] that rest. He said there's a cry in all
[1:11:58] hearts for that rest, but the majority
[1:12:00] don't know the answer. So, they try to
[1:12:02] steal the cry by religious process of
[1:12:04] keeping certain days or accepting
[1:12:07] denominational creeds and dogmas.
[1:12:09] Musicians go ahead and come. But failing
[1:12:11] in that, many tried drinking, carousing,
[1:12:15] and every physical excess,
[1:12:19] thinking that by worldly pleasures
[1:12:21] there could be some satisfaction.
[1:12:25] But in such there is no rest. You say,
[1:12:26] "Well, Brother Ben, you're preaching to
[1:12:28] message people. Surely we would never
[1:12:31] Oh, I know that we're human beings."
[1:12:35] And sometimes you wish you could be just
[1:12:36] one of the good old boys that don't
[1:12:39] worry about nothing. just sits home and
[1:12:42] does whatever he wants to on a Sunday.
[1:12:45] Wish you'd just be one of the girls,
[1:12:48] drink your wine, and
[1:12:52] go to the beach and do all the things
[1:12:53] that they do there. And
[1:12:57] you just wish you could be one of them.
[1:13:00] But in such, there is no rest.
[1:13:09] There there's been a phenomena where
[1:13:11] this just comes to my mind so you
[1:13:13] forgive me but been a phenomena where
[1:13:15] you know I know people want to be famous
[1:13:18] and the best way to be famous the
[1:13:19] easiest way is the internet now in fact
[1:13:22] people who want to promote music that
[1:13:24] they're writing they no longer go to a
[1:13:25] record label they get on the internet
[1:13:28] if you can get become a star on TikTok
[1:13:30] you're a big star
[1:13:32] so they there are people you know The
[1:13:36] paparazzi is hated. That's the people
[1:13:38] who go around take photos. You know,
[1:13:40] they follow celebrities around, take
[1:13:42] pictures of them. Do you know there's
[1:13:44] celebrities who pay paparazzi to follow
[1:13:47] them around?
[1:13:50] who actually tell them where they're
[1:13:52] going to be
[1:13:54] and then talk about how much they hate
[1:13:56] it,
[1:13:58] but they actually go the places where
[1:14:00] the paparazzi are and and make sure they
[1:14:03] get put on camera cuz they're desperate
[1:14:08] to get a little more well-known,
[1:14:11] have a little more fame,
[1:14:14] just a little bit more money,
[1:14:17] and I'll feel good about myself.
[1:14:20] Somebody told me that somebody won the
[1:14:21] lottery today or yesterday or something.
[1:14:23] It was like $1.2 billion or some crazy
[1:14:25] number. But there's no rest in that.
[1:14:29] They found lottery winners usually lose
[1:14:31] the money. There's no rest in it. But I
[1:14:34] can tell you where there is rest
[1:14:35] tonight. Come unto me. He said, "All you
[1:14:38] that are weary and heavy laden, and I
[1:14:40] will give you rest."
[1:14:44] They smoke and take pills to quiet their
[1:14:46] nerves,
[1:14:47] but there is no rest in earthly potions.
[1:14:51] They need Jesus.
[1:14:54] Oh, God.
[1:14:57] He's still the ultimate remedy. I know
[1:14:59] doctors can help. Even sometimes a a
[1:15:01] counselor, somebody to talk to can help.
[1:15:04] But the ultimate remedy is always going
[1:15:06] to be Jesus.
[1:15:09] That is the heavenly remedy to a broken
[1:15:12] spirit. That is the heavenly remedy to a
[1:15:14] to an addiction. That is the heavenly
[1:15:16] remedy. God has provided a way. And the
[1:15:19] prophet cried out, "Is there no bomb in
[1:15:20] Gilead? Is there no position there?"
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; Why is the health of the daughter of my
[1:15:25] people not recovered?
[1:15:28] They need the heavenly remedy, the rest
[1:15:30] of the spirit. Has your soul found that
[1:15:33] rest? As we bow our heads together, no
[1:15:35] matter how much you rest your mind and
[1:15:36] your body, you need that rest. But no
[1:15:39] matter how much you rest it, till your
[1:15:41] soul finds rest, you'll be like the dove
[1:15:43] released from the ark
[1:15:46] who might
[1:15:47] at first decided, well, I'll do this.
[1:15:50] I'll do that. I'll sit over here, but
[1:15:52] just couldn't do it.
[1:15:59] You tried maybe being a backslider,
[1:16:01] tried going out, but you just can't do
[1:16:03] it.
[1:16:07] Maybe you're watching today and we got
[1:16:08] several families on vacation, others
[1:16:10] traveling and things, but maybe you're
[1:16:12] sitting there and you you've tried
[1:16:13] everything. I just can't get rest in my
[1:16:15] spirit. Jesus is still standing here
[1:16:18] today saying, "Come unto me. Come to the
[1:16:21] word. Come and partake of the word of
[1:16:23] God and the shakina glory in the
[1:16:25] presence of God." And in that presence
[1:16:27] there is rest. In that word there is
[1:16:30] peace.
[1:16:32] There's joy in the house of the Lord.
[1:16:35] Has your soul found that rest? You may
[1:16:37] find no rest like the dove, but she made
[1:16:40] it back to her place of safety. Maybe
[1:16:42] that's what we need to do tonight. Just
[1:16:44] come back. I'll be honest with you. No
[1:16:46] matter how tired I am, how weary I am.
[1:16:48] And sometimes I'm so tired. We go to
[1:16:50] these meetings. Sometimes you get so
[1:16:52] tired. And
[1:16:54] I get so tired. Sometimes preaching or
[1:16:55] whatever, you're traveling overseas, we
[1:16:57] get tired.
[1:16:59] But no matter how tired I am,
[1:17:02] I always got five minutes or 10 minutes
[1:17:04] or half an hour to spend in his presence
[1:17:07] because there's something about being in
[1:17:08] his presence that brings you into rest
[1:17:11] in your spirit.
[1:17:14] And no matter how weary you are,
[1:17:17] you come to the house of God and you you
[1:17:19] just maybe frenetic, just just upset,
[1:17:21] but there's something about being in his
[1:17:23] presence just you say, "Lord, I know you
[1:17:26] that peace is for me. that joy is for
[1:17:29] me. Why don't you rest in him tonight?
[1:17:31] Why don't we just worship him
[1:17:32] consciously do that tonight? Let's just
[1:17:35] worship him with all that we have. And
[1:17:37] then Lord, I know I know there's a place
[1:17:39] of rest for me. You're welcome to come
[1:17:42] to the altar if you need to come and
[1:17:43] pray or if you want me to pray for you,
[1:17:45] but why don't we just why don't we just
[1:17:48] worship him tonight and say, "Lord, I
[1:17:50] I'm entering into the Holy of I know
[1:17:52] that's my place of rest. I know there's
[1:17:55] a place for me and I know you are that
[1:17:58] place and that person. Would you just
[1:18:00] pray that way? Heavenly Father, Lord
[1:18:02] Jesus, we worship you tonight. We thank
[1:18:04] you for your goodness and your mercy.
[1:18:07] Thank you for your love, Lord, towards
[1:18:10] us, Lord, that we were without hope and
[1:18:14] you died for my sins, Lord. There's I
[1:18:17] rest in that, God. I rest in it because
[1:18:20] I haven't been good enough and no other
[1:18:23] man has ever been good enough to make it
[1:18:26] in on their own merit. But Lord, I know
[1:18:28] that by your blood, I have been saved.
[1:18:31] I've been born again. Now, let me rest,
[1:18:33] Lord. Oh, I know my heart has been
[1:18:36] changed. I know my soul there's
[1:18:38] something's happened. There's a shakina
[1:18:40] presence there, Lord. May I may I learn
[1:18:43] to rest in it. Oh God, may I be like the
[1:18:45] dove who could not find rest any other
[1:18:47] place. May I find my way back to the
[1:18:50] place of safety. Each one of these
[1:18:51] people, oh God, you know what the future
[1:18:54] is for them. You know what lies ahead.
[1:18:56] We don't know, Lord, when we leave these
[1:18:58] doors what the future will hold. But you
[1:19:00] know, Lord, and you hold that future.
[1:19:02] And I pray God that you would help us to
[1:19:04] rest in that, to rest in your knowledge
[1:19:06] and and your design and your purpose for
[1:19:09] our lives. We thank you for that. I pray
[1:19:12] that you'd move, Lord, in a mighty way.
[1:19:15] Stir us up, oh God. May there be such a
[1:19:17] revival, Lord, in our hearts, oh God.
[1:19:21] Lord, as the brothers preach and things
[1:19:23] coming up over the next few services,
[1:19:25] may there be such a stirring of your
[1:19:26] spirit, Lord, until we know that we've
[1:19:29] been every time we come to church, we've
[1:19:30] been in the house of the Lord. May we
[1:19:33] not slack off when we come to your
[1:19:35] house. May we give it all that we've
[1:19:36] got. May we take the time, Lord, to be
[1:19:39] ready for the presence of the Lord. I
[1:19:41] pray that you grant it. We thank you for
[1:19:43] all that you do. We give you praise. We
[1:19:45] give you glory tonight for all that
[1:19:47] you've done today in Jesus name. Amen.
[1:19:52] Thank you, Lord Jesus. If anyone else
[1:19:54] would like to come and pray, you're
[1:19:56] welcome to come. There's a place of rest
[1:19:58] for you. If you've never found it, you
[1:20:00] can enter into that rest tonight. All is
[1:20:03] well.

[1:21:25] so he gave her a son.
[1:21:33] While working in the field, the little
[1:21:37] boy died. But the woman's faith never
[1:21:43] failed.
