[37:33] Wednesday but if I'm not brother Joel
[37:34] will will take that service but uh we're
[37:37] glad to have uh the the ministers that
[37:39] we have aren't we and the ministry that
[37:41] we have we believe under the messenger
[37:43] of the hour the bride is the final voice
[37:45] to the final age and so we believe we're
[37:48] part of that and we want to be part of
[37:50] that voice at our voice to that for this
[37:53] age amen let's turn to John
[37:55] 8:31 we begin to read then said Jesus to
[37:58] those Jews which believed on him if you
[38:01] continue in my word then are you my
[38:04] disciples indeed and you shall know the
[38:07] truth and the truth shall make you free
[38:11] they answered him we be Abraham's seed
[38:13] we're never in bondage to any man how
[38:16] sayest thou you should be made free
[38:19] Jesus answered them verily verily I say
[38:21] unto you whosoever committeth sin is the
[38:24] servant of
[38:26] sin the servant abideth not in the house
[38:29] forever but the son abideth forever if
[38:34] the son therefore shall make you free
[38:37] you shall be free indeed I pray the Lord
[38:40] would add his Blessing to the word you
[38:42] may be seated this
[38:44] morning I was in the post office the
[38:47] other day and and getting a postage
[38:50] stamp and I picked up uh these stamps as
[38:53] the ones that they gave me and they say
[38:55] freedom on them I know you can't read it
[38:56] from there but it's a US flag and it
[38:58] says freedom on it and at the bottom it
[39:01] says forever because it's a forever
[39:03] stamp and when I saw that it something
[39:06] pricked my heart and and spoke to my
[39:09] heart and and and and said that's the
[39:11] kind of Freedom that I want is freedom
[39:15] forever I don't want a temporary Victory
[39:19] I don't want a a slight repri from
[39:22] suffering I don't want you know if
[39:24] you've struggled with something in your
[39:26] life if you've struggle with sin if you
[39:28] struggle with heartache if you struggle
[39:30] with uh W with trouble in your life you
[39:33] don't want just a temporary thing you
[39:35] you want freedom you you want freedom
[39:38] that lasts and I don't want what Pharaoh
[39:40] offered the children of Israel when he
[39:42] come to them and he begin to offer a a
[39:44] reprieve from their taskmasters he said
[39:47] why don't you just take a three-day
[39:48] journey and go into the Wilderness and
[39:50] leave your wives and children at home
[39:52] and go Worship the Lord and come back
[39:54] that's not the kind of Freedom that they
[39:56] needed because were going right back to
[39:58] the whip of a Taskmaster they were going
[40:00] right back to the same old thing that
[40:02] they'd always been in I don't want a
[40:04] temporary Revival I don't want a good
[40:07] feeling I don't want just a a small uh
[40:10] momentary uh thing that makes me feel
[40:12] good I want something that lasts I need
[40:15] something in my life that that can drive
[40:18] me to the house of God when I feel like
[40:20] it when I don't feel like it that'll
[40:22] bring me to the my knees when I feel
[40:24] like it when I don't feel like it no
[40:26] matter what it is going on my in my life
[40:28] I want to freedom
[40:30] forever and every one of us we we've
[40:33] experienced bondage we know what it's
[40:35] like to be in the bondage of sin but we
[40:37] also know what it's like to be free yes
[40:39] and we want that freedom to last yes sir
[40:43] how many of you that you can say Amen to
[40:45] that this morning I want freedom to last
[40:47] I don't want it to be a temporary thing
[40:49] I want it to be freedom
[40:53] forever so we don't want just temporary
[40:55] Freedom not interest said although we
[40:58] love when the Winds of Revival roll
[40:59] through but I want the Revival to be in
[41:02] me now what is freedom freedom in the
[41:08] context of what Jesus was speaking of
[41:11] when he said I'll make you free indeed
[41:13] is speaking of uh someone who is
[41:16] delivered from slavery freeing someone a
[41:20] person or a thing from slavery and the
[41:23] Jews were actually insulted that Jesus
[41:27] identified them as slaves yeah or former
[41:32] slaves yeah because watch what they told
[41:34] him they answering him we be Abraham's
[41:37] seed and were never in bondage to any
[41:40] man think at that testimony we heard as
[41:43] children that a little old Holiness lady
[41:45] stood up she said well I've always been
[41:46] a good
[41:48] girl and you know some of us might be
[41:50] able to say that on and to some extent
[41:52] we needed salvation didn't we we needed
[41:55] freedom but the Jews were in insulted
[41:57] because they said we've always been free
[41:59] yeah we've always we were born free and
[42:02] so uh you know they forgot about that
[42:04] little time down there in Egypt you know
[42:06] and that little time they spent in
[42:07] Babylon but they said we're born free
[42:10] we're a free people but Jesus wasn't
[42:13] talking about freedom in society he was
[42:16] talking about freedom in their
[42:18] souls and the three we find there were
[42:21] three classes of people in that time in
[42:23] Roman society it was a slave Society it
[42:26] was Society Society built on slavery and
[42:29] so there were slaves there were freed
[42:31] slaves and there were Freeborn men and
[42:35] you you were fit into one of those
[42:36] things a Freeborn Man could become a
[42:38] slave but a slave could never become a
[42:41] Freeborn Man he might be freed but his
[42:44] life would always be marked by having
[42:46] been enslaved so if you were born a
[42:49] slave if you were a slave first you
[42:51] could never be oh my you could never be
[42:55] completely free but if you were free
[42:59] first you could be free and brother
[43:02] brandom takes that we're going to get
[43:03] into a sermon brother brandom preaches
[43:05] called return and Jubilee brother
[43:07] brandom takes that and types it to
[43:08] predestination and said if you ever were
[43:10] in God's mind you can be free you can
[43:14] have freedom forever you know because
[43:17] you're predestined by God to Freedom now
[43:20] uh so if a person had been a slave his
[43:23] life would always be marked by having
[43:25] been enslaved and slaves and their
[43:28] families were the property of their
[43:29] owners who could sell them or even rent
[43:31] them out at any time lives were harsh
[43:34] slaves were whipped branded or cruy
[43:36] mistreated their owners could kill them
[43:38] for any reason and would face no
[43:40] punishment for doing so right around the
[43:43] age of 30 a slave could expect to gain
[43:46] their freedom but if their freedom was
[43:48] given to them they would still have to
[43:50] work for their former slave owners so
[43:53] they would always be in a sort of
[43:55] bondage so the slave owner would said
[43:57] said you can be have your freedom but
[43:59] you're going to be in a in a kind of uh
[44:01] relationship where I'm you're always
[44:03] going to work for me yeah right but but
[44:06] but now that's a person that was a slave
[44:09] and their children would go into slavery
[44:11] right so they could be free but their
[44:13] children were going to slavery but if
[44:15] they could buy their freedom if a price
[44:17] was paid they were would be completely
[44:20] free but then their past would always be
[44:22] with it so again you see those classes
[44:24] of people there are some that could
[44:26] never escape the B bondage of of slavery
[44:28] some that could Escape through a
[44:29] generosity of the owners they could live
[44:31] pretty good but their children would be
[44:33] slaves there were some that could gain
[44:35] freedom but there were some others that
[44:37] were born free and remained free now
[44:40] Jesus told the Jews he said you're not
[44:42] thinking about it correctly he said
[44:44] actually because you won't believe the
[44:46] word because you won't recognize who I
[44:48] am as as as God in flesh he said you're
[44:51] actually slaves yeah you're slaves to
[44:54] sin right he said but I can make make
[44:57] you free yes free indeed free forever
[45:01] right oh I believe we still serve a
[45:03] risen savior today and I want to stand
[45:05] here until the day that the Lord takes
[45:07] me off the Earth by way of Rapture by
[45:09] way of the Grave I want to stand here
[45:10] and Proclaim there is Liberty in the
[45:12] house of God there's freedom in the word
[45:14] of God there there's strength to
[45:16] overcome everything the devil would
[45:18] throw at us we don't have to live as if
[45:20] we're going to get him by the skin of
[45:21] our teeth we can make it and we can live
[45:23] in Freedom all right are you with me the
[45:27] morning so far yes you got to be free
[45:30] indeed free indeed now
[45:34] look now joh Jesus answered them and
[45:37] said verily verily I say un you
[45:38] whosoever committeth sin is the servant
[45:42] or the slave of
[45:44] sin Paul explains this in Romans 6:16
[45:47] know you not that to whom you yield
[45:48] yourself servants to obey his servants
[45:52] you are to whom you obey so you can
[45:54] stand and say I'm a free man but when
[45:56] the cigarette urge comes
[45:59] on right you've got to smoke it you can
[46:03] stand there and say I'm a free man but
[46:04] when the when when you're alone in the
[46:06] room with the
[46:07] computer you've got to go after
[46:10] it right you can stand and Proclaim I'm
[46:13] a Christian but when there's something
[46:14] about it you just can't seem to you you
[46:17] can't seem to be completely free but I'm
[46:19] here to Proclaim to you this morning
[46:21] there's a gospel there's a word that can
[46:23] free you this morning completely free
[46:26] compl completely and eternally free so
[46:30] it's not what you say about yourself
[46:31] it's not what the Jews said about
[46:33] themselves but he said you're actually
[46:35] in bondage to sin and don't know it
[46:38] you're in bondage to unbelief now sin is
[46:41] bondage his servants you are to whom you
[46:43] obey whether of sin to death or of
[46:45] obedience under righteousness sin is
[46:47] bondage Paul said in Romans 7:14 we know
[46:50] the law is spiritual he said but I'm
[46:52] carnal sold under sin sold under sin
[46:55] mean he was sold as a SL sold in the
[46:57] slave market but but listen we were not
[47:00] born to be slaves we were not born in a
[47:03] slave family you were not oh God if we
[47:06] just realize who we are today some
[47:08] people struggle with things for years
[47:09] and they think well it's just who I am
[47:11] no it's not who you are who you are was
[47:13] in the mind of God before the foundation
[47:15] of the Earth when the sons of God
[47:17] shouted for Joy that's where you were
[47:20] you were in the the back part of God's
[47:22] mind before the world ever began that is
[47:25] who you are yeah
[47:27] yes that's what you're being called back
[47:29] to that's what this message is being
[47:31] this message is not a history this
[47:33] message is not is not some kind of a
[47:35] dead letter but this message calls you
[47:37] back to what you were in his
[47:39] mind
[47:41] yes
[47:43] heyen now look we we weren't born
[47:48] originally to be slaves but we were born
[47:49] in this world under a bondage of sin we
[47:53] are Freeborn children if you if you're
[47:56] born again today you're made free by the
[47:57] son who paid the price for your
[48:01] freedom oh aren't you glad aren't you
[48:04] glad he paid the price he didn't just
[48:06] say okay you can go free but he actually
[48:09] paid the price he says you are bought
[48:11] with a price yeah now watch what he says
[48:13] be not ye the Servants of men don't go
[48:16] hire yourself out right to the flesh
[48:18] anymore don't go hire yourself out to
[48:21] the devil don't go hire yourself out to
[48:23] pornography don't go hire yourself out
[48:26] to uh to unbelief don't go hire yourself
[48:28] out to depression and anxiety he said
[48:30] don't be a servant of sin yeah right you
[48:33] were bought with a price amen walk like
[48:37] it act like it are you with me now oh
[48:41] you didn't gain freedom by the devil's
[48:43] Good Will on you didn't gain freedom by
[48:46] your own effort but you gain freedom by
[48:48] the price being paid by the Lamb on
[48:50] Calvary and because you got your freedom
[48:53] your freedom was bought for you sir oh
[48:56] that's what makes makes us worship
[48:57] that's what makes us cry brother B
[48:59] talked about Abraham Lincoln and how
[49:01] that he said that that black man was
[49:02] standing there and Abraham Lincoln's
[49:04] display and it showed the dress where
[49:06] the blood had spilled on it and it
[49:08] showed that was Abraham Lincoln's blood
[49:10] and it moved the man and brother B said
[49:12] why are you so moved he said I wore the
[49:14] chains of slavery he said and that man's
[49:16] blood freed Me From Slavery but I'm here
[49:19] to tell you this morning there's a much
[49:20] greater freedom in the house of God that
[49:22] the blood of the Son of God freed Us
[49:25] From Slavery freed fre us from unbelief
[49:27] freed us from oh that ought to make us
[49:29] worship it ought to bring tears to our
[49:31] eyes we ought to love him with all of
[49:32] our
[49:34] hearts yes we ought to love him no
[49:36] matter how we're
[49:37] feeling no matter whether we're you say
[49:40] well I'm having a bad day okay is he
[49:42] still worthy come on
[49:45] now oh I'm having was it as bad a day as
[49:47] he was having when they beat him as we
[49:49] said last week they beat him with all
[49:51] the passion they could beat him with and
[49:53] let me worship him with all the passion
[49:54] I have yeah it's good
[49:58] right the
[50:00] payment has been
[50:02] made I feel like the Lord's doing
[50:04] something this
[50:06] morning I know he's here do you believe
[50:08] he's
[50:09] here amen now look you're bought with a
[50:12] price the payments been made brother R
[50:15] said the in the Old Testament under the
[50:17] law he taught us this and it teaches us
[50:18] in the Bible as well every seven years
[50:21] there was to be a Sabbath yeah every
[50:23] seven sabbaths 49 years there was a
[50:25] jubilee year
[50:27] after 49 years the 50th year was a Year
[50:30] of Jubilee and they had to keep those
[50:32] sabbaths and that Jubilee that Jubilee
[50:35] that word
[50:36] Jubilee it actually means in in
[50:40] Leviticus 25 is where you'll find it
[50:42] actually means an alarm of War yeah the
[50:45] battlecry of a king oh my the blast for
[50:49] March on the day of atonment the shout
[50:52] of joy in public
[50:55] worship a musical service or shout of
[50:58] joy in general it's a jubilee it's a
[51:02] time for a trumpet to be sounded yeah
[51:06] and during that time of the trumpet
[51:07] sound then that would be the time of
[51:10] freedom in Leviticus 25:9 let's just go
[51:13] there for just a moment if you'll bear
[51:14] with me I know you've heard some of
[51:15] these things before but maybe we'll put
[51:17] it a little bit differently this morning
[51:19] and make it hopefully where we can
[51:21] understand it Leviticus 259 then shout
[51:23] that cause the trumpet of the Jubilee
[51:26] that's that word it it means it means a
[51:28] shout of Joy or or a trumpet sound of
[51:31] joy to sound on the 10th day of the
[51:33] seventh month and the day of atonement
[51:35] shall you make the trumpet sound
[51:36] throughout all your land and you shall
[51:38] hallow the 50th year and Proclaim
[51:41] Liberty throughout all the land unto all
[51:43] the inhabitants thereof it shall be a
[51:45] jubilee unto you you shall return every
[51:47] man unto his possession you shall return
[51:50] every man un his family so we find that
[51:54] a man who was Freeborn an Israelite
[51:56] under the Old Testament law could be
[51:58] could lose everything even his own
[52:01] Freedom as a result of
[52:04] circumstances yeah right things could
[52:07] happen right to an Israelite yeah the
[52:10] elect nation of God say why the bad
[52:13] things happen to me must mean I'm not
[52:14] elect no it don't mean that at
[52:16] all we live in a world that's been
[52:18] corrupted by sin blame it on the devil
[52:21] it's his fault but God allows it for our
[52:24] good so he said all things work together
[52:27] for good them that love God are the
[52:28] called according to his purpose so now a
[52:30] man who was born could lose everything
[52:32] as a result of circumstances but those
[52:35] things and his own Freedom could only
[52:37] remain lost Yeah by his own choice right
[52:41] circumstances could take it away but at
[52:44] the Year of Jubilee no
[52:47] circumstance could prevent him yeah from
[52:50] taking it
[52:51] back I just want to drive this home now
[52:54] sir listen his inheritance was Secure
[52:57] yes sir unless he deliberately chose
[53:00] bondage over Freedom he could have
[53:02] freedom forever yes now I just love this
[53:07] brother Brandon said now somehow or
[53:09] other the individual lost their
[53:10] inheritance that was given to them by
[53:11] God they're coming year called The
[53:13] Jubilee Year and that was every seven
[53:15] years they had a rest a Sabbath every
[53:17] seven days they had a Sabbath every
[53:19] seven years they had a Sabbath and seven
[53:21] sabbaths was 49 years and the 50th year
[53:24] was Jubilee and in this Jubilee every
[53:26] every man that had lost his inheritance
[53:28] by some means if he was a Freeborn and a
[53:30] true-blooded Israelite no matter who
[53:32] held the possession it had to go back to
[53:35] him free yeah now watch he didn't have
[53:39] to pay a thing come on he didn't have to
[53:41] do a thing but just stop what he was
[53:44] doing and go back to his
[53:48] inheritance Oh my he said he had a right
[53:50] to it and see the devil scare you away
[53:53] from that yeah but really what do you
[53:56] have to do to get your
[53:57] healing stop what you're
[53:59] doing and go back to it what do you have
[54:03] to do for your children to be saved stop
[54:05] what you're doing go back to the word go
[54:08] back to your possession go back to the
[54:10] promise of God start putting God first
[54:13] yeah you'll see your children begin to
[54:15] come back to God yeah oh I've seen it
[54:17] many times so just stop what you're
[54:19] doing go back to your inheritance stop
[54:21] the worry stop you say well I can't
[54:23] control that you have more control over
[54:25] it than you think you do yeah cuz the
[54:27] the Christian has the ability Paul said
[54:30] to to to knock down every stronghold of
[54:32] the enemy yeah Amen to take into
[54:35] captivity every thought that exalts
[54:37] itself against the knowledge of Christ
[54:39] that's where we need to be
[54:40] today Hallelujah that's what we need to
[54:43] be doing now watch now he said no matter
[54:46] what taken place he said he had a right
[54:49] to it it was a god-given right he by
[54:50] Grace had inherited it it would have
[54:52] been given to his fathers handed down
[54:53] year after year no matter what had taken
[54:55] place if he lost it it must go free it
[54:58] meant he said Grace is provided for each
[55:01] individual to return to their rightful
[55:04] inheritance what a picture it gives us
[55:06] tonight he said of the church in this
[55:08] last day he said you see what man can do
[55:12] and then you see what God does boy you
[55:14] could preach on that for a while
[55:15] couldn't you you see what man can do but
[55:18] you see what God does What man does is
[55:21] failing yeah will fail has failed and
[55:25] always will fail yes right amen that's
[55:28] why brother brandom taught the
[55:29] leadership of the Holy Ghost in in our
[55:31] churches yeah that's why he taught local
[55:33] church sovereignty that the leadership
[55:35] of the Holy Ghost is leadership of the
[55:36] local church why did he teach thatc
[55:38] listen because because we know that what
[55:41] God does is right yeah What man does is
[55:44] wrong but what God does is eternal What
[55:47] man does is failing but what God does is
[55:49] eternal must forever remain nothing can
[55:52] ever take it away God give it if if he
[55:55] saved you to today nobody can take that
[55:57] away from you having a bad day won't
[56:00] take it away from you feeling different
[56:02] won't take it away from you some
[56:03] preacher can't take it away from you a
[56:05] church can't take it away from you your
[56:07] wife or your husband can't take it oh
[56:09] thank God nothing can ever take it away
[56:12] from you you're free
[56:14] forever Hallelujah he said God give it
[56:18] it's his free gift and by his Sovereign
[56:20] Force I saw it and placed it and there's
[56:22] nothing can ever move it it's there
[56:24] eternally oh if we really believe that
[56:27] today he said in Jubilee was God's
[56:29] manner of expressing Grace to his people
[56:32] for restoring or be brought back to
[56:34] their rightful position now watch
[56:37] Leviticus 25:23 the land shall not be
[56:39] sold forever for the land is mine for
[56:42] your strangers and sojourners with me
[56:46] the land shall not be sold forever
[56:48] that's why every time Israel gives up
[56:49] land for peace they have a problem they
[56:52] always lose when they give up land for
[56:54] peace because the land was theirs
[56:55] forever the physical lamb but what is
[56:57] ours forever the promises of God are
[57:00] ours forever all the promises of God
[57:03] someone say all the promises all the
[57:05] promise every promise in the book is
[57:07] mine everything that's written there
[57:09] belongs to me all the promises of God
[57:13] are mine now watch he said and in all
[57:15] the land of your possession you shall
[57:17] Grant a Redemption for the land yes now
[57:21] I want to point out something that
[57:22] brother brandom actually points out in
[57:24] that sermon that land in a walled city
[57:28] was not subject to the laws of
[57:30] redemption now I want us to really think
[57:32] about this I want us to apply this to
[57:34] our own lives not just to other people
[57:37] but but ourselves and even our own
[57:38] church and we need to make sure we don't
[57:40] create a walled City and become set in
[57:45] our ways and take somebody else's
[57:47] thought over the word because if we do
[57:51] we're no longer subject to the laws of
[57:53] redemption we got to come out of that
[57:55] City that walled City cuz our land oh
[57:59] God is not behind those
[58:01] walls now watch Leviticus 2530 he said
[58:05] if it be not redeemed within the space
[58:07] of a full year then the house that is in
[58:09] the wall City shall be established
[58:10] forever him that bought it throughout
[58:12] his Generations it shall not go out in
[58:14] the Jubilee but the houses of The
[58:16] Villages which have no wall round about
[58:19] them shall be counted as the fields of
[58:21] the country they may be redeemed they
[58:23] shall go out in the Jubilee brother BR
[58:26] said Remember the ones that was walled
[58:28] in never got to go free they were
[58:30] bondslaves the rest of their time you
[58:33] think about how serious this is and you
[58:35] begin to think we don't want we want
[58:37] complete and total freedom we want
[58:39] freedom forever we don't want to trade
[58:40] the walls of an old city for the walls
[58:43] of a new city we're not going to trade
[58:46] the walls of a of one church for another
[58:49] we're not going to trade the walls of
[58:50] one Doctrine for another of one Dogma
[58:52] for another we want to be free right we
[58:55] want to be free we don't want to reject
[58:57] denominational walls and then build
[58:59] denominations
[59:00] ourselves right that's we don't want to
[59:02] do that what is it there's got to be a
[59:04] freedom from those
[59:06] walls now brother B said they never got
[59:08] to go free they were blond sides the
[59:09] rest of their time the owner owned them
[59:12] if they put their inheritance in a city
[59:15] that was walled in yes oh God but if it
[59:18] was outside little bitty cities that
[59:20] wasn't walled in then it oh church
[59:23] that's what we want to be as a church we
[59:24] don't want to be walled in we don't want
[59:26] to say we're the only ones that can make
[59:27] it we don't want to say if anybody else
[59:29] does it differently they're not right no
[59:30] we don't want to be walled in we don't
[59:32] want to add our Creeds and dogmas to the
[59:34] message we want a city that's open yes
[59:36] sir a city that's free yeah let the
[59:39] world know what we're doing it's all
[59:41] right because what we preach is the
[59:42] Gospel of Jesus Christ not some cult
[59:45] somewhere denomination somewhere in a
[59:47] wall City what we believe is the gospel
[59:49] but B how do you join by one Spirit
[59:51] we're baptized into one
[59:54] body amen right you know walls around
[59:57] this city are you with me
[1:00:00] now and and so we don't want to wall the
[1:00:03] city now he said but if it was outside
[1:00:06] and was considered like the plains they
[1:00:07] could go free in the Jubilee Pentecost
[1:00:09] brother R talked about they walled
[1:00:11] themselves in yeah they saw what God was
[1:00:13] doing they said let's protect this
[1:00:15] revival and they made Creeds around it
[1:00:18] and walled themselves in now and what
[1:00:21] those what are those walls well
[1:00:23] Pentecost made those walls like they
[1:00:25] said well speaking tongues is the only
[1:00:27] evidence of the Holy Ghost that's the
[1:00:29] only thing it is an Evidence but it's
[1:00:31] not the
[1:00:32] evidence right because you can receive
[1:00:35] Paul said do all speak with tongues you
[1:00:37] can receive the Holy Ghost without
[1:00:38] speaking in
[1:00:39] tongues right but but there's they made
[1:00:43] a Doctrine out of something that was not
[1:00:44] biblical right right and it becomes a
[1:00:47] wall that separated them from their
[1:00:49] Brethren now here brother BR said on
[1:00:53] these walls inside he said where if we
[1:00:55] ever get walled into a place listen I
[1:00:58] want us to take it seriously T today
[1:01:01] take it seriously each one of us I I
[1:01:03] don't want to make you uncomfortable but
[1:01:04] every one of us ought to take this
[1:01:06] personally and examine our own Hearts he
[1:01:09] said if we ever get to a place where we
[1:01:11] can't accept the word and the Holy
[1:01:13] Spirit and have to take the Creeds and
[1:01:16] so forth of a church instead of the
[1:01:19] power of the Holy Spirit the Jubilee
[1:01:21] will never mean nothing to that person
[1:01:24] right no matter how much you can say
[1:01:27] mother left your inheritance daddy did
[1:01:29] that but you sold out and walled up and
[1:01:33] come into a Creed and accepted this
[1:01:35] Dogma that was injected into your
[1:01:38] fellowship instead of being free in
[1:01:41] Christ and letting the Holy Spirit lead
[1:01:43] us yeah oh
[1:01:45] my it's serious church and you say well
[1:01:49] I don't have a Dogma I'm you know I I
[1:01:51] don't even have a church I don't even go
[1:01:52] to church well that's a Dogman in
[1:01:54] itself right that's not what the Bible
[1:01:57] says the Bible says assemble yourself
[1:01:58] together much more as you see the day
[1:02:00] approaching so anything that wouldn't
[1:02:01] assemble itself together would be a
[1:02:03] Dogma that's right it's walls you build
[1:02:05] walls around your own house yeah build
[1:02:07] them up so high nobody can come in yeah
[1:02:10] right you build walls around yourself as
[1:02:12] an individual walls of complexes walls
[1:02:15] of anxiety walls of of struggles in your
[1:02:18] own life and you build those walls and
[1:02:19] build those walls but Paul said tear
[1:02:21] down those walls yeah that's right he
[1:02:24] let them come down anything listen to
[1:02:26] anything that prevents you from hearing
[1:02:28] the word of God in Freedom tear it down
[1:02:31] yes anything that keeps you from from
[1:02:34] loving God with all of your heart
[1:02:35] anything that keeps you let it go tear
[1:02:38] it down it's not worth not being able to
[1:02:41] fill his presence it's not worth the
[1:02:43] dove of the Holy Spirit flying to the
[1:02:44] Gable end as brother put it of your soul
[1:02:46] it's not worth not feeling the influence
[1:02:48] of the holy spirit because of some
[1:02:50] Grudge you hold yeah come on it's not
[1:02:53] worth it it's not worth it to me it's
[1:02:54] not worth it to you what is is it we
[1:02:56] don't want no walls we want the Holy
[1:02:58] Spirit to move freely among
[1:03:01] us see because what the devil will do
[1:03:05] I'm just preaching it's not my notes but
[1:03:07] you just hang with me for a minute
[1:03:09] listen if you what the devil will do is
[1:03:11] he'll cause something to come against a
[1:03:14] preacher and and what he'll do is he'll
[1:03:17] he'll he'll let you build up a wall you
[1:03:19] start building up a wall of protection I
[1:03:21] don't want that preacher to do that to
[1:03:22] me I don't want that I don't want that
[1:03:24] preacher that preacher doesn't like me
[1:03:26] that preacher and you build that up
[1:03:27] pretty soon you can't benefit from
[1:03:29] nothing right but that preacher says you
[1:03:31] might not might as well not even be
[1:03:33] there because you're not benefiting
[1:03:35] because you think the person doesn't
[1:03:36] like you and the truth is it's probably
[1:03:39] not the case I've never seen a preacher
[1:03:41] didn't like people like to have people
[1:03:43] around I mean I guess there's some out
[1:03:45] there but I don't know who they are I've
[1:03:47] always thought more people was better
[1:03:48] than less people to preach to just in
[1:03:54] general it's all right but if you're not
[1:03:56] careful you build up a wall that person
[1:03:58] doesn't like me and then everything I
[1:04:00] say would become an offense right right
[1:04:04] and we got to be careful with that
[1:04:05] church because what we're doing is we
[1:04:07] get to where we can't accept the Liberty
[1:04:08] you it may not be me it may be some
[1:04:09] other preacher it may be it may be uh
[1:04:11] maybe a certain church or a certain type
[1:04:13] of Fellowship it may be just just
[1:04:15] something that's going on in your life
[1:04:16] and you let that build up walls around
[1:04:18] you pretty soon the Holy Spirit can't
[1:04:19] flow anymore you don't have any access
[1:04:22] that you don't worship like you used to
[1:04:24] you can't you're afraid to raise your
[1:04:25] hand cuz well this church doesn't
[1:04:26] believe exactly like mine does so I'm
[1:04:28] afraid to raise my hand I'm afraid to
[1:04:30] worship oh come on church we that's not
[1:04:32] what we believe we believe that every
[1:04:34] one of us are subject to failure and
[1:04:36] mistake and we're all we we may not have
[1:04:39] everything perfectly right but we love
[1:04:41] God with all of our hearts and we want
[1:04:42] to serve him with all of our heart break
[1:04:44] down those walls and let the Holy Spirit
[1:04:46] move again in the house of God let him
[1:04:48] move again in in the Hardy Arkansas we
[1:04:51] don't want no walls we want True
[1:04:53] Fellowship yeah right that's that's
[1:04:58] good but the walls if you're not careful
[1:05:01] it prevent you from
[1:05:03] hearing you know OB a wall sound won't
[1:05:06] just go through a wall it bounces off
[1:05:08] now you may hear it it may come over the
[1:05:10] top or whatever if you got a high enough
[1:05:12] wall you won't hear no
[1:05:14] sound and what they actual God they box
[1:05:18] themselves in in denominationalism so
[1:05:20] much that when the message of this hour
[1:05:22] sounds they're unable to hear it because
[1:05:26] of the wall yeah the wall prevents him
[1:05:29] from hearing the trumpet call I say oh
[1:05:32] Church let's hear Let let's go back to
[1:05:34] the message let's let's find out what a
[1:05:36] prophet said let's find out what the
[1:05:38] Jubilee was in our hour let's hear the
[1:05:40] trumpet
[1:05:41] call now brother BR said a man and his
[1:05:44] family could go back to their original
[1:05:46] inheritance if they could hear the
[1:05:48] Jubilee and a trumpet sound and know
[1:05:50] what it meant to them yeah listen if
[1:05:54] they can hear it and know what it meant
[1:05:58] to them yeah now brother BR said if they
[1:06:01] heard the priest sound the trumpet the
[1:06:03] minister he said the trumpet is the
[1:06:05] gospel and when they hear it and they
[1:06:08] know what it means and they know that
[1:06:10] that's their
[1:06:13] inheritance oh oh Church see you'll
[1:06:17] never respond to it unless you know what
[1:06:19] it means yeah and you also have to hear
[1:06:22] it so you have to be in a place where
[1:06:24] there's freedom you have to be outside
[1:06:26] of those walls and what I mean by that
[1:06:28] is not a physical place but a spiritual
[1:06:30] place in your life where there's Freedom
[1:06:32] cuz you can sit in a free church and be
[1:06:34] bound yeah right but but you need a
[1:06:37] spiritual freedom in your life that you
[1:06:39] can hear the gospel trumpet he said no
[1:06:41] matter where where they lost how far
[1:06:44] they went back whatever they had to do
[1:06:46] they had the privilege to come oh I
[1:06:48] believe it's a privilege to come and
[1:06:50] receive again their inheritance he said
[1:06:52] now watch the whole
[1:06:54] family
[1:06:56] yeah oh church I'm believing for all of
[1:06:59] my family how about you I'm believing
[1:07:02] for all of our families the whole family
[1:07:05] could come and receive their inheritance
[1:07:07] yes now brother Brandon was preaching to
[1:07:09] Pentecostals on the 50th anniversary of
[1:07:11] the Pentecostal Revival in Louisiana he
[1:07:13] said so it is tonight that men and women

[1:08:13] church we just realized this morning and
[1:08:15] I I I'm I'm stirred up a little bit but
[1:08:17] it's because I realized in my own life
[1:08:19] many times what we need is not to think
[1:08:21] about it not to talk about it but just
[1:08:23] get up and go yeah
[1:08:26] just get up from where you are and go

[1:08:37] struggle many times and I and I feel
[1:08:39] that struggle I care about that I really
[1:08:41] do care about that but we've got to get

[1:09:03] had all he had to do didn't have to do
[1:09:05] nothing just get up and go it's all he
[1:09:06] had to do go back oh if he knew the
[1:09:09] sound of the trumpet we had to know the
[1:09:10] sound of the trumpet they were sons of
[1:09:13] God for if the trumpet give an uncertain
[1:09:16] sound who shall prepare himself to
[1:09:18] battle the Bible
[1:09:19] says but we don't have an uncertain
[1:09:21] sound we have a certain sound Freeborn
[1:09:24] Israelites real Christians we would say
[1:09:28] now watch but they were living in
[1:09:30] bondage unable to reach their full
[1:09:32] potential in Christ because of Walled
[1:09:35] cities Creeds which are man-made
[1:09:39] doctrines instead of word yeah Jericho
[1:09:42] was a walled
[1:09:43] city right that's kind of an
[1:09:46] understatement Jericho had the biggest
[1:09:48] baddest walls on the place on the planet
[1:09:52] at that
[1:09:53] time right and and and what that meant
[1:09:56] was they had the the utmost in military
[1:09:58] technology in their day right it'd be
[1:10:02] like it'd be like one of these countries
[1:10:04] I've been to West Africa or or China or
[1:10:07] or the UK or something like that well
[1:10:09] they just have no no match in military
[1:10:11] technology yeah and there was no match
[1:10:14] between a bunch of people armed with
[1:10:16] pitchforks and farming
[1:10:19] implements right and here is a city
[1:10:22] that's the greatest walled City in the
[1:10:25] country yes sir but God you know we know
[1:10:29] the story how that the angel of the
[1:10:31] Covenant met Joshua there on the side of
[1:10:33] the on the side outside the walls and he
[1:10:36] told him what to do and so they marched
[1:10:38] around the city seven times but the
[1:10:40] seventh time they marched around and but
[1:10:43] they didn't just March but they oh my
[1:10:47] they blew with trumpets and they shouted
[1:10:50] yeah and the Bible said so the people
[1:10:52] shouted when the priest blew with the
[1:10:54] trumpet right you tell me it's wrong to
[1:10:56] respond loudly to the word of God in
[1:10:59] church what do you do with that
[1:11:02] scripture what's the trumpet today
[1:11:04] brother brand told us the gospel
[1:11:05] minister with the trumpet the people
[1:11:08] shouted when the priests blew with the
[1:11:10] trumpets and it came to pass when the
[1:11:12] people heard the sound of the trumpet
[1:11:15] and the people shouted with a great
[1:11:18] shout now that word shout in in the
[1:11:21] original in Hebrew is the same
[1:11:23] word it's in icus 25 it's
[1:11:27] Jubilee amen right the people when they
[1:11:31] heard the
[1:11:32] trumpet they became the
[1:11:35] Jubilee they began to shout they began
[1:11:39] to make a jubile a jubilant noise if we
[1:11:41] can say it that way that shout is the
[1:11:44] same word it's Jubilee the people
[1:11:46] shouted with a great shout the wall fell
[1:11:48] down flat so that the people went up
[1:11:51] into the city every man straight before
[1:11:53] him and they took the city so so the
[1:11:55] walls had to fall down now what were the
[1:11:57] walls doing the walls all over the city
[1:11:59] had to fall down but not one could touch
[1:12:01] rahab's house now listen rahab's house
[1:12:04] was up against the wall so the wall fell
[1:12:07] but it didn't damage her house it
[1:12:08] released her
[1:12:12] house come on come on Church it released
[1:12:16] her house where it was under the bondage
[1:12:19] behind the wall now there was no wall in
[1:12:21] front of rahab's house and it was the oh
[1:12:24] God it was the only one left standing
[1:12:26] there was no accuser left standing there
[1:12:28] was no one none of the men that had ever
[1:12:30] accuse could ever accuse her would ever
[1:12:32] be left standing but it was free right
[1:12:35] she was free I'm sure there was a
[1:12:37] jubilee going on in that house when that
[1:12:38] wall fell down right in front of the
[1:12:40] house yeah good the house literally
[1:12:43] built on the wall and people walk around
[1:12:44] what in the world everything else fell
[1:12:46] down flat but this
[1:12:48] house
[1:12:50] amen hallelujah so she could go from
[1:12:53] bondage to Freedom when she heard the
[1:12:58] Jubilee
[1:13:00] amen hallelujah you know people say well

[1:13:05] church service oh yes you do

[1:13:10] that they wanted to but the people had
[1:13:12] to shout yeah come on now
[1:13:15] preach are you with me now that's what
[1:13:17] the Bible says they had to shout yeah he
[1:13:19] said don't it wasn't enough just for the
[1:13:21] trumpeters to trumpet but the people had
[1:13:22] to
[1:13:23] shout that's good good heyen I don't
[1:13:26] mean we have to be running around all
[1:13:27] over the place I know some people have
[1:13:28] different personalities say you worship
[1:13:30] God how you feel to worship God but but
[1:13:32] don't don't be critical of me if I get a
[1:13:34] little bit overwhelmed by the presence
[1:13:36] of God don't be critical of somebody
[1:13:38] else if they get overwhelmed and they
[1:13:40] begin to shout and they begin to praise
[1:13:41] God why they heard a gospel
[1:13:44] trumpet all right and when the gospel
[1:13:46] trumpet sounds there's something about
[1:13:47] it it means freedom to me when I hear
[1:13:49] this message preach that's why I get
[1:13:51] excited when we have meetings and these
[1:13:53] brothers come in and I hear the message
[1:13:55] of the hour being preached it just does
[1:13:56] something to my heart brother the bill I
[1:13:58] can't stand still why because I know
[1:14:01] that the message of the hour is freedom
[1:14:03] it's not bondage it's not a book of
[1:14:05] rules it's freedom to me yes it's what
[1:14:07] brought freedom to my family it's what
[1:14:09] brought freedom to to us as a
[1:14:12] church it's the message of the
[1:14:14] hour
[1:14:16] hallelujah
[1:14:17] hallelujah oh I believe there's coming a
[1:14:20] great Jubilee time in fact I believe
[1:14:22] we're living in a jubilee time right why
[1:14:25] because the first Thessalonians 4:16 for
[1:14:28] the Lord himself shall descend from
[1:14:30] heaven with
[1:14:32] what Hallelujah with a shout with the
[1:14:34] voice of the Archangel with the Trump of
[1:14:36] God and the dead in Christ shall rise
[1:14:38] first and we which are alive and remain
[1:14:40] should be caught up together with them
[1:14:41] in the clouds to meet the Lord in the
[1:14:42] air so shall we ever be with the Lord
[1:14:44] Brother said a shout what is the shout
[1:14:46] it's the message going forth first the
[1:14:48] living bread of life bringing forth the
[1:14:50] bride if we've heard the shout there's
[1:14:52] freedom for you today there's freedom
[1:14:54] for you today
[1:14:56] right I don't care what it is that's
[1:14:58] bound you I don't care I know it's a
[1:15:00] little Evangelistic this morning I don't
[1:15:01] usually do this on a Sunday morning but
[1:15:03] I'll say this it doesn't matter what's
[1:15:04] bound you you can have freedom in the
[1:15:06] house of God you can have freedom for
[1:15:08] your family you can have freedom right
[1:15:10] now in your own soul yes this Jubilee is
[1:15:14] for you yeah why because you're the
[1:15:17] elect of God predestined before the
[1:15:19] foundation of the world brother brand
[1:15:21] said it was only for the elected God's
[1:15:22] chosen that's the way it is today not
[1:15:25] that runneth or him that willth it's God
[1:15:26] that has Mercy it's God that does it God
[1:15:28] by his grace Jesus said no man can come
[1:15:30] to me except my father draws him all the
[1:15:33] father has given me will come to me it's
[1:15:35] God's grace that he chose the church
[1:15:36] before the foundation of the world he
[1:15:39] said that church will hear the word of
[1:15:40] God they'll turn every Creed down
[1:15:42] they'll turn every organization every
[1:15:44] denomination that's contrary down and
[1:15:46] they'll serve God by the power of the
[1:15:48] Holy Ghost they certainly know the
[1:15:50] trumpet sound oh do you know the sound
[1:15:52] of the message this morning said my you
[1:15:55] hear my voice what are you talking about
[1:15:56] the word the word you say that's god's
[1:16:00] voice in the beginning was the word and
[1:16:03] the Word was with God and the Word was
[1:16:06] God yeah it's the word that we heard oh
[1:16:10] that's what I hear when I turn on the
[1:16:11] tapes it's not a man's voice it's the
[1:16:13] word yeah but that's what I hear when a
[1:16:15] preacher preaches the same message it's
[1:16:17] the
[1:16:18] word that's right it's the word amen oh
[1:16:22] you say that's god's voice in the
[1:16:24] beginning was the word the word was with
[1:16:25] God the Word was God word was made flesh
[1:16:27] and one Among Us my sheep hear that they
[1:16:29] know it a stranger they will not follow
[1:16:31] they don't hear these Creeds they don't
[1:16:32] hear these dogmas and these things
[1:16:34] that's been injected to make an
[1:16:35] organization instead of a
[1:16:37] body all right and that's why every time
[1:16:41] it organizes it dies right right because
[1:16:44] you're not an organization you're a body
[1:16:47] right and if you treat your body like an
[1:16:49] organization you'll die because you'll
[1:16:52] inject stuff into it that doesn't
[1:16:53] belong right right just think about it
[1:16:57] for a
[1:16:57] minute you inject Creeds it's like
[1:16:59] injecting drugs in your system don't
[1:17:02] belong there yeah right stuff that not
[1:17:06] not helpful and it may seem well it'll
[1:17:08] be helpful but it'll break you down some
[1:17:09] other way and I'm not against medicine
[1:17:10] I'm not saying that but it's all has
[1:17:12] side effects don't it but this message
[1:17:14] has no side effects right only those
[1:17:18] that are pleasing to God right why it it
[1:17:21] what is it it's the same gospel that
[1:17:22] Paul preached it's the one that to
[1:17:25] preach on the day of Pentecost it's it's
[1:17:27] the the serum brother Bram calls it it's
[1:17:29] the antidote right to the poison of
[1:17:32] sin look he he said he said they don't
[1:17:37] hear these Creeds they don't hear these
[1:17:38] dogmas he said a sacrifice and offerings
[1:17:40] I would it's not but a body has to
[1:17:42] prepared me a body of Believers a body
[1:17:46] that's been
[1:17:47] born before it can be a body of human
[1:17:49] beings watch he said before I can act as
[1:17:52] a human before I can walk like a human
[1:17:54] before I could talk like a human I had
[1:17:56] to be born a
[1:17:57] human I want to tell you something I
[1:18:00] want to say this sincerely would Paul
[1:18:02] recognize the church that we have today
[1:18:05] I believe he
[1:18:06] would right even those that fall
[1:18:09] asleep there was one fell asleep and he
[1:18:11] raised him from the dead so we have a
[1:18:15] challenge but Paul
[1:18:17] recognized that he would recognize I
[1:18:19] believe the church that we have and the
[1:18:21] reason why he would recognize is because
[1:18:23] we do what Paul did right it walks like
[1:18:26] Paul looks like Paul talks like Paul
[1:18:28] right that's why brother BR said I
[1:18:30] preach what Paul preached before it can
[1:18:32] be a body of human beings before I can
[1:18:34] act as a human before I can walk like a
[1:18:36] human before I can talk like a human I
[1:18:38] have to be born a human yeah that's
[1:18:40] right he said how would a knot on a tree
[1:18:42] know how I
[1:18:44] acted well you wonder
[1:18:47] sometimes all
[1:18:49] right how
[1:18:52] can how can some of these Nots
[1:18:55] trees know how we act right oh church I
[1:18:59] feel free this morning you just bear
[1:19:01] with me how would a knot on the tree
[1:19:03] know how I acted how could he ever say I
[1:19:06] don't act like that he said of course he
[1:19:08] doesn't he said the only way he could be
[1:19:10] that would be born like me right
[1:19:13] Hallelujah that's the way organization
[1:19:16] is he said they've drawn people away it
[1:19:18] went after a Creed it's not like a non
[1:19:20] on log looking at the true church saying
[1:19:22] well y'all are too emotional y'all too
[1:19:23] this sad or the other y' follow a man
[1:19:25] y'all are called whatever whatever they
[1:19:26] want to say about it but what are we
[1:19:28] doing we're just doing what humans do
[1:19:30] we've been born by the spirit of God
[1:19:32] we're just doing what the body of Christ
[1:19:35] does are you with me
[1:19:37] now he said but in order to be a Son of
[1:19:40] God you got to be born of the spirit of
[1:19:41] God you become Christlike and do the
[1:19:42] works of Christ he said and you're not
[1:19:45] funny then you're not funny to them
[1:19:47] people
[1:19:48] yeah right to them people Holy Ghost
[1:19:51] filled people how are you with me so far
[1:19:55] yeah a human acting like a human he said
[1:19:57] it's not funny and a Christian acting
[1:20:00] like a Christian born of The Same Spirit
[1:20:02] he said you see the Pentecostal group at
[1:20:04] the beginning he's not talking about
[1:20:06] isusa Street he said that same
[1:20:09] Pentecostal group acts the same way if
[1:20:12] it's born of The Same Spirit right
[1:20:14] because it's born that's right he said
[1:20:16] that's why today people doesn't
[1:20:18] understand the church yes he said and
[1:20:20] the church has begin to grow cold and
[1:20:22] formal getting after Creeds and things
[1:20:24] and leaving off the following of the
[1:20:26] Holy Spirit the Bible tells us as many
[1:20:28] as are led by the spirit of God they are
[1:20:30] the sons of God and it says we have not
[1:20:32] receiv received the spirit of bondage we
[1:20:34] have not received the spirit of slavery
[1:20:37] we've not received a spirit of bondage
[1:20:38] to fear but you've received a spirit of
[1:20:41] adoption whereby we cry ABA father we're
[1:20:44] part of a family that's been born again
[1:20:47] we're part of a family that does not
[1:20:48] fear because we've been adopted into the
[1:20:51] family of God sir there come a time that
[1:20:54] listen brother brand talked about how
[1:20:55] they they come out under a mighty hand
[1:20:57] in the Old Testament and in Moses time
[1:21:00] but come a time when God said you've can
[1:21:01] pass this mountain long enough he said
[1:21:03] the old Fighters died off he tyed that
[1:21:05] to the Pentecostal age the old Fighters
[1:21:07] had to die off and a new generation was
[1:21:09] born and he says this he said it's time

[1:25:20] and death I'm not wearing those Chains

[1:25:26] Hallelujah I may still have the scars
[1:25:28] from where the chains were on my hands I

[1:25:40] love him with all of my heart I'm free
[1:25:42] I'm not in a wall City I belong to him
[1:25:44] yes sir my inheritance is secure yes
[1:25:47] made me free from the law of sin and
[1:25:50] death I believe every one of us can say
[1:25:51] that this morning if you can't say that
[1:25:53] now it's the time to hear the gospel
[1:25:55] trumpet and be free
[1:25:56] yes yes Hallelujah and when that trumpet
[1:26:01] sounded can I have just a few more
[1:26:04] minutes and the trumpet sounded a man
[1:26:06] who heard it had to respond one way or
[1:26:08] another and your response tells you what
[1:26:10] you are see it's not what you go through
[1:26:11] in life it's your
[1:26:13] response how you respond to it many
[1:26:16] times we go through Terrible Things
[1:26:19] Christians go through things that are
[1:26:21] just you don't even like to think about
[1:26:23] yeah because it's hard I know some of
[1:26:25] you have been through those kind of
[1:26:28] things we weep with those who weep yeah
[1:26:31] mourn with those who mourn and I always
[1:26:34] think in my heart brother West what if
[1:26:35] my wife was struggling with that what if
[1:26:36] that was my child brother BR said you
[1:26:38] can't enter in for somebody in prayer
[1:26:40] until you till you can have compassion
[1:26:41] on that person empathy for that person
[1:26:44] brother brand looked at that one that
[1:26:45] man that come up there with with no
[1:26:47] shoes on he's looking at his own shoes
[1:26:48] see if his shoes would fit his feet and
[1:26:52] you just it just hurt you and and ought
[1:26:54] to be that way when a member of the body
[1:26:55] of Christ hurts we all hurt yeah if we
[1:26:57] ever get to a place where that doesn't
[1:26:58] happen we need to check up as a church
[1:27:02] right yeah you're going to go through
[1:27:04] you're going to go through great
[1:27:06] difficulty but what I'm saying is is
[1:27:08] that you're able to overcome that yeah
[1:27:10] the law of the spirit of life has made
[1:27:12] you free from the law of sin and death
[1:27:14] that does not define who you are right
[1:27:17] you don't have to be bound in your
[1:27:19] spirit you you might be hurting this
[1:27:21] morning you might be sick you might be
[1:27:23] just elderly and hurting in your body
[1:27:25] you might be you might be a young person
[1:27:27] that has been struggling this week but
[1:27:29] you can be free this morning because you
[1:27:31] the reason you were struggling is
[1:27:33] because you're one of gods the reason
[1:27:35] the devil was after you is because you
[1:27:37] belong to God the reason he's given you
[1:27:39] such a hard time but you couldn't quit I
[1:27:41] think we ought to we ought to stand up
[1:27:43] sometime say I know that I I'm not what
[1:27:45] I'm what I need to be I know I'm not
[1:27:48] what I'm going to be but I know I'm not
[1:27:50] what I used to be and I know I stood
[1:27:52] somehow I made it some somehow I've been
[1:27:54] brought from my place where I was into
[1:27:57] the house of Freedom somehow I've been
[1:27:59] brought into a place where I can have
[1:28:01] freedom again I say we ought to just
[1:28:03] shake off every bond that holds us what
[1:28:06] good is it it does it doesn't do us any
[1:28:08] good to hold on to it Shake It Off let
[1:28:11] it go and let God move in your life
[1:28:14] again hear the voice of the spirit of
[1:28:16] God preaching to you there's freedom in
[1:28:18] this
[1:28:19] message Hallelujah
[1:28:22] right Hallelujah
[1:28:26] oh I believe he's here this
[1:28:30] morning
[1:28:32] Hallelujah but you got to make a choice
[1:28:34] one way or another you're going to make
[1:28:35] a choice when you walk out of here this
[1:28:36] morning you go out better or
[1:28:39] worse and exodus 21:5 tells us that if
[1:28:43] the servant the slave was called on the
[1:28:45] year Jubilee shall plainly say I love my
[1:28:48] master my wife my children I will not go
[1:28:51] out
[1:28:52] free then his master shall bring him
[1:28:54] unto the judges he shall also bring him
[1:28:56] to the door onto the doorpost his master
[1:28:59] shall bore his ear through with an a He
[1:29:02] Shall Serve him
[1:29:05] forever my heart breaks for that person
[1:29:07] yeah because maybe he was afraid to come
[1:29:10] away from that system because he thought
[1:29:13] well if I break away what do I have I
[1:29:14] don't know what's true but you got to
[1:29:16] get into Freedom before you can hear the
[1:29:19] gospel trumpet right but the thing is if
[1:29:21] he refuses to hear it if he refuses and
[1:29:25] he says I love my master I love my
[1:29:27] denomination I love the way things are
[1:29:29] going in my life I love my cigarettes I
[1:29:31] love my
[1:29:32] alcohol Watch What Happens his master
[1:29:35] comes and pours him through with an a in
[1:29:37] his ear why his ear brother BR say he
[1:29:40] made it where he wouldn't hear it no
[1:29:41] more let me tell you how you're blessed
[1:29:43] this morning if you still
[1:29:48] hear if you can hear the gospel trumpet
[1:29:51] it means you haven't
[1:29:55] you haven't been taken to the door you
[1:29:57] haven't heard I'm not talking about just
[1:29:58] hearing with these ears everybody hears
[1:29:59] with these ears but if you can hear if
[1:30:01] there's a prick in your heart if your
[1:30:03] conscience is is pricked this morning if
[1:30:05] you can feel the presence of God get up
[1:30:07] and go to
[1:30:10] it Hallelujah don't serve that Master
[1:30:15] forever you see this man could never
[1:30:18] hear again he' never hear the Jubilee He
[1:30:20] had to be willing to give up everything
[1:30:23] for Freedom yeah
[1:30:25] see Jesus said If any man come to me and
[1:30:26] hate not his father and mother and wife
[1:30:28] that doesn't mean hate in the sense of
[1:30:30] of anger and temper it means love
[1:30:33] less hate not his father and mother and
[1:30:36] wife and children brother and sisters
[1:30:37] yeah in his own life also he cannot be
[1:30:40] my disciple right other words you put
[1:30:43] everything below Christ he's
[1:30:46] first and whosoever does not bear his
[1:30:49] cross and come after me cannot be my
[1:30:52] disciple they knew what that was they
[1:30:54] they knew what it was they've seen men
[1:30:55] bear their own cross right to be
[1:30:58] crucified they knew what that meant yeah
[1:31:02] see you've got to be willing to lose it
[1:31:03] all to gain everything I think about the
[1:31:05] foundation of this country and how it
[1:31:07] was made and men that were willing to
[1:31:08] risk it all like Patrick Henry who stood
[1:31:10] up one day he said they were having a
[1:31:11] debate over whether or not we should be
[1:31:13] a free country and he said Give me
[1:31:15] liberty or give me death right I can't
[1:31:18] live like I'm living anymore I want
[1:31:21] freedom or nothing I can't have this
[1:31:23] bondage over for me I don't want to have
[1:31:25] to listen to a King in a far away land
[1:31:27] control my life I want freedom in my
[1:31:30] house oh God Give me liberty or give me
[1:31:34] death Matthew 19:29 and but there
[1:31:37] there's a reward for that everyone that
[1:31:39] have forsaken houses or Brethren or
[1:31:41] sisters or father mother or wife or
[1:31:43] children or lands for my name's sake
[1:31:45] shall receive a h
[1:31:47] hundredfold and shall inherit ever
[1:31:50] everlasting life look you receive a h
[1:31:51] hundredfold in this life yeah
[1:31:54] why because you're blessed because you
[1:31:56] made that sacrifice for God and then you
[1:32:00] inherit Everlasting yes
[1:32:05] life brandom talks about a man named
[1:32:07] Arnold Von winkl he's actually a a
[1:32:10] figure of History it's a painting there
[1:32:13] that was painted about what happened
[1:32:15] Arnold Von winkl red was a man who just
[1:32:18] an ordinary man but the Swiss were being
[1:32:22] defeated by I believe it was the
[1:32:23] austrians or coming against the Swiss
[1:32:24] they were marching over there warlike
[1:32:26] people were marching over their country
[1:32:28] and and trying to destroy their take
[1:32:30] their children into bondage and their
[1:32:32] wives and things and and Arnold Von Wier
[1:32:34] just had
[1:32:36] enough you got to have enough sometimes
[1:32:39] got just got to be fed up with being
[1:32:42] miserable before you can ever be free
[1:32:44] you got to be fed up with being
[1:32:45] miserable right and he would just fed up
[1:32:47] with being miserable and so he's he's
[1:32:51] standing
[1:32:52] there he he told the people around him
[1:32:54] he said I'm going to do something
[1:32:56] today he said I'm going to I'm going to
[1:32:59] give my life because what was happening
[1:33:02] is the Army back in that day they had
[1:33:03] Pike men and they'd stand in the front
[1:33:05] and every time the Swiss Army would come
[1:33:07] against those great big Pikes they
[1:33:08] didn't have any kind of armor like that
[1:33:10] had pitchforks and things and they'd
[1:33:12] come up against those great big Pikes
[1:33:13] that you see in the picture and they'd
[1:33:14] come up against them and they just
[1:33:16] slaughter them they couldn't break
[1:33:18] through and the only way to break
[1:33:20] through was to not care about your own
[1:33:22] life yeah to actually put the nation
[1:33:25] above his own life was the only way and
[1:33:27] he knew that and so he said today I'm
[1:33:30] dying for Switzerland and so he runs up
[1:33:33] and you see him there he grabs a hold he
[1:33:35] runs to the thickest part of the Spears
[1:33:38] and he grabs a hold of those Spears and
[1:33:40] Pikes and thr and like this and thrust
[1:33:43] in his own bosom because when he did
[1:33:45] that those behind him and around him
[1:33:46] could go
[1:33:47] through and he says he screamed out Make
[1:33:50] Way for Liberty Make Way for Liberty
[1:33:54] and brother brand said when he went to
[1:33:55] Switzerland I believe in the 40s and
[1:33:57] again in the 50s he went to Switzerland
[1:33:59] and he went over there and and when he
[1:34:00] went he said every time you mention his
[1:34:03] name Arnold Von winkin he said you
[1:34:04] mention that name tears come in her eyes
[1:34:06] because it'd be like George Washington
[1:34:08] to us or something like that but it was
[1:34:09] a great hero there but brother brand
[1:34:11] says but oh he said it was a little
[1:34:13] thing to what happened one day when
[1:34:14] Adam's race stood demons Marching In
[1:34:17] from every side prophets had failed law
[1:34:19] had failed sacrifice of bows and Lambs
[1:34:21] had failed man's nature had failed faed
[1:34:24] everything and Adam's little race stood
[1:34:26] defeated outnumbered by Devils
[1:34:28] Superstition sickness diseases there was
[1:34:31] one who stepped out in heaven and said
[1:34:32] this day I'll die for Adam's race he
[1:34:34] come to the Earth and was made flesh he
[1:34:36] looked right down where the midst of the
[1:34:38] spears was the darkest he said the very
[1:34:40] darkest of all men's dreads was death
[1:34:42] and he took death into his bosom and on
[1:34:44] Calvary he paid the sacrifice and
[1:34:46] screamed Make Way for
[1:34:48] Liberty he said and he screams to his
[1:34:50] church take this which I have left you
[1:34:53] my blood in my spirit and fight with
[1:34:55] whatever you've got he said you can we
[1:34:57] can conquer tonight through that friend
[1:34:59] you can drive the devil from you every
[1:35:01] old enemy that's in your life it can be
[1:35:02] drove out by the blood and the spirit of
[1:35:04] Christ and you can stand perfect in his
[1:35:06] presence Christ made the way from that
[1:35:08] day to this Swiss never had another War
[1:35:11] why because one man took the initiative
[1:35:13] and said Make Way for Liberty and I
[1:35:15] believe we've had a man that said Make
[1:35:17] Way for Liberty it was the man Christ
[1:35:19] Jesus because he's done that you can
[1:35:22] follow him today he tells this church
[1:35:24] take what I gave you take the Holy Ghost
[1:35:26] and follow
[1:35:27] me hallelujah oh can we do it this
[1:35:30] morning I don't know about you but I
[1:35:32] want freedom forever I want an end to
[1:35:35] the war on I want an end to those things
[1:35:38] I want to see God make such a difference
[1:35:40] in lives till people are transformed by
[1:35:43] the power of God believe we're seeing
[1:35:45] that would you bow your heads with me as
[1:35:46] as musicians come
[1:35:49] hallelujah hallelujah I just get carried
[1:35:53] away I could preach all day but it's
[1:35:54] just now
[1:35:55] 12:00 oh do you love him this
[1:36:01] morning Lord
[1:36:02] Jesus we talked last week about the
[1:36:05] firemen that run out there the BR said
[1:36:07] that one little fire department they
[1:36:08] went and spur a little water here spurt
[1:36:09] a little water there you don't put out a

[1:36:14] fireman from Louisville come in he said
[1:36:16] the captain come in he said come on Boys
[1:36:18] Follow Me said that's what Jesus did
[1:36:21] Brother BR said that's what he wanted to
[1:36:22] do as a prophet

[1:36:26] and I want to stand here as a pastor of
[1:36:27] this church today say come and follow me

[1:36:51] of Safety that stayed right here in the
[1:36:52] house of God and got the true baptism of

[1:36:58] Lord carries we're going to see a
[1:36:59] generation of young people like that but
[1:37:01] what are we going to say we know there's
