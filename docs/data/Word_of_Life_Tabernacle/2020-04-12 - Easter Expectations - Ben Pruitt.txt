make it but with him you can make it if you have an unspoken request you just want to raise your hand to the Lord I can't see all of you but he sees your need this morning and we know that he's able Heavenly Father a lot as we feel your presence already here on this Resurrection Sunday father I pray that you would just move in our lives today and just move aside everything that's unlike you I pray you would meet every need or because you live because you did not stay in that grave we are able to face whatever comes Lord that the church the bride down to the century Florida's been able to stand because you live they've stood through persecutions and struggles and trials Lord we still stand today because you still have science has not been able to keep you in a tomb nothing that the world could say could ever Lord take us away from this fact that you live because you live all of our tomorrows are certain there's nothing that you can't do with you Lord there's nothing that we can't do so grateful for your presence this morning I pray for each one of these unspoken requests Lord I pray that you would just move it Lord in every home father wherever people are watching this morning I know that you're a God that is not bound by time and space but God you're their father I pray that you would move in each heart maybe they're feeling lonely your Lord may be depressed this morning but God we know that the Sun is risen whether the Sun outside shines or not we know that the Esso in us up for you grant it now and just move in their lives this morning move me out of the way to speak to your people today we pray in Jesus name hey man hey man what a blessing it is to be in the house of the Lord on Easter Sunday to be able to speak the word of the Lord I'm gonna read from Luke chapter 24 verse 1 and while we're turning there we can I'll tell you that we began a study on the book of 1st Corinthians on Wednesday night if you didn't get a chance to see that there's a link to the full video on our Facebook page there's we had some trouble with my internet at home I may have to do that from the church here but we'll get that done and and it's just kind of an introduction and we were kind of getting our feet on the ground but I think it'll be a blessing to us if we'll kind of follow along and and read through that book Luke chapter 24 and verse 1 if you're watching this morning I really appreciate you being there and say Amen say hello or something to us so we'll know that you're there and that you're able to watch if you have any trouble a TAS know someone was monitoring the stream this morning too so that they'll know Luke chapter 24 and verse 1 now upon the first day of the week very early in the morning they came unto the sepulchre bringing the spices which they had prepared and certain others with them and they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre and they entered in and found not the body of the Lord Jesus it came to pass as they were much perplexed thereabout behold two men stood by them in shining garments as they were afraid and bowed down their faces to the earth they said unto them why seek you the living among the dead o might be a question for us this morning wouldn't it ycq the living among the dead he is not here but it's risen but you're glad for that this morning remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee they say remember what he said he told you he wouldn't stay in the tomb he said remember what he bacon - you saying the Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and the third day rise again they remembered his words I pray the Lord without his blessing - the word he may be seated this morning thank you to all of you that are helping out this morning I appreciate that very much and to sister Carla for that song and appreciate that more than you know just a blessing to be in the house of the Lord I want to speak to you this morning on Easter expectations Easter expectations an expectation is a strong belief that something will happen or be the case in the future it's a belief that someone will or should achieve something you might say that you have an expectation that your kids graduate from school that's an expectation it's a strong belief and in a father or mother's case it might be something you would be willing to go to great lengths to see happen because it's an expectation that you have recently I spoke on dealing with disappointment and disappointments come and many times because of our expectations we are disappointed and yet I want to speak on on a positive side of that this morning that if we don't expect anything we won't be disappointed but we also won't receive anything so there's got to be an expectation of blessings in our lives and and just if you look at your natural life there's got to be some things that you expect to happen and there's got to be some things that you expect to to be true and and every time you get in your car you expect it to start every time you cross the bridge you expect it to hold why because it's an expectation built by your experience you you believe it'll happen but I believe the Word of God is more sure than any bridge and it's more sure than any anything else but the game I feel like I'm a little loud up here this morning maybe just my monitors but you're it makes you more sure of the Word of God than you would be of anything else that you Specht and so we must have expectations when it comes to the Word of God I would ask us this morning to think about what we were expecting out of Easter you know a lot of people are disappointed this morning and some because they were gonna have a helicopter fly over and drop eggs you know on the on the grounds and they were disappointed that didn't happen well and I'm sure the kids especially would be disappointed by that but we weren't gonna do that anyway so we that wasn't an expectation of ours and you know there's other expectations that you might have depending on where you go to church or or if you don't go to church that you might have expectations of an Easter Bunny or some great program of some kind and people expect to have a full church on Easter you expect different things to happen maybe in your family you expect there to be a table with a ham on it or or whatever it is that you Kurt that you cook on on Easter and there'd be something there and maybe you're not able to gather the people like you'd want to or or your kids or your grandkids gather around a table and you might be disappointed by that today but our expectation for Easter has got to be something more than just a holiday that we observe no there's nothing wrong with observing it as a holiday but we've got to see it as what it really is that Christ rose from the dead and it's the single most important event of history that's ever been now many as I said of our expectations come from experience we expect our hard to start because it always has we expect traffic to flow smoothly when it doesn't we have we get upset why because we expected it to happen we expect to be able to go out and eat not right now though doesn't that bother you you think about that there years ago there wasn't a lot of restaurants around that you could go do that but for me that really bothers me to not be able to go out and eat sit down to the table and and be able to eat I never ate anywhere fancy but I just like to go eat Mexican or something you know just just anything almost any rest would do right now so we expect things to happen because they've always happened that way we've always been able to sit down at a restaurant we've always been able to do certain things when we go through times look we're going through now I think we ought to change and we're begin to look rather at our expectations than see what are we really expecting to happen spiritually what are we expecting to happen what are our Easter expectations we expect stores to be stocked we expect things to happen I found out that when I traveled overseas that my expectations didn't match up with what their expectations were because they didn't ever expect to be on time because something was always going to keep them from being there on time so you did you start having churching you just have to realize that you had to wait on the person to arrive you might be an hour late and you go upstairs and get ready after that and then you come back down and go with him and then by that time they've been in church for two hours but it's expectations they just don't expect you to be on time and the people arrive early but if they can but there's people coming all through the service because somebody's car broke down and there was an accident on the way a brother coming to get us had an accident on the way coming to get us and so it's just part of it they don't expect any different and the problem with that is you know we as Americans we expect a lot of things to work that can be a good or a bad thing but it's a good thing in the sense that we have expectations that they're not met we would have a riot and I say there's a good thing because we expect our freedom we expect to be able to go to church we expect to be able to have certain freedoms in our life and be able to go and do the things that we need to do and that's a good expectation right we expect these things to happen and so they do because we create by our expectation an environment that those things can happen in and in a place where there's no expectation there's no environment to be created that it can happen so I want us this morning to create an expectation that Christ will meet us here is that is it too much to ask you know as Americans we expect to be able to go to we expect to be able to put gas in our vehicle be able to go to the store and be able to get what we have Nina how much more should we expect God to meet his word and to be here when we come or wherever we're at this morning your expectations reveal what you believe and who you believe in but the Brandon tells us you get what you expect if you come to the meeting to find something to criticize the devil will show you plenty if you come for the good of it to be saved he says the Holy Spirit will speak to you oh my the Holy Spirit will speak to you if you're listening this morning for the right reasons expecting God to speak to you he'll speak to you if you come expecting to be healed the Holy Spirit will see to that you get what you expect so be expecting so and again but the round tells us expectations usually is based upon a faith you have to have faith before you can expect anything so even on an elementary level that's crossing a bridge you have to have faith that it'll hold up before you'd cross it and when it comes to the Word of God before you believe it you have to have faith that it works and then you begin to expect based on the promises of God so and those are the two things that expectations come from it comes from our experience but it also comes from his promises right and we could say even on a personal level if you make a promise to me I expect you to do it and yet I realize you're human so you might say brother Ben I'll be in church on Sunday and not be able to I might tell you what we're going to do a certain thing in the church and we just not able to do it but don't that's because we're human but if God ever said anything he did it right he didn't let one word fall to the ground voice but if he ever said anything that's why we believe like we do it's why we dress like we do look like we do and have the the the standards that we do is because we believe God keeps his word we don't believe in change with the flow of time in the whims of time we believe God keeps his word and if God keeps his word today we can expect God to save the center we can expect God to fill us with the Holy Ghost we can expect to see healing we can expect to see God moving in our midst why he promised it and if he ever did it one time David he'll do it again amen oh my I don't think we ought to be bound down by our limited expectations well is the coronaviruses going on all these things no we expect God to still be gone amen our expectations are not based on what's going on in the world what viruses are going around or epidemics or anything else it's not based on the the frailty of men it's not based on just with who's coming to preacher who's gonna be here how many people are gonna be in the service but our expectation is based solely upon the Word of God and if it's the Word of God it'll stand God keeps his word Simeon expected to see the Messiah before his death and he's sawing his expectation was Matt the people Shepherd account he's crazy but he saw him oh my he expected to see him and he was there and somehow he was led right to the place where his expectation was Matt Jesus came into Jerusalem for the Passover on the weekend of his death the people had great expectations we find in Matthew chapter 21 and verse 8 that a very great multitude spread their garments in the way others cut down branches from the trees and strawed them in the way and the multitudes that went before and that followed cried saying Hosanna to the son of David blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord hosanna in the highest when he was coming into Jerusalem all the city was moved saying who is this now they expected a messiah but they didn't know who he was even though he came exactly the way that God said he would come exactly word for word the way that the Prophet said he would come and yet the very same people would cry just another day later crucify him but the random says he was the answer of the prophets prophesy here he comes riding upon the foal of an ass what an attraction God was fulfilling his promised word the hour that had been waiting since four thousand years and he says in Genesis the third chapter and the fifteenth verse God had made the prediction the seed of the woman shall bruise the Serpent's head but his head shall bruise her heel that prophesy down through the Bible that had been predicted of this man coming so it all the whole scriptures spoke of that moment that he would come and he's that their king came to them and they even cried got caught up in and cried Hosanna and didn't know what they were talking about even though they understood something was going on and there were great expectations of a Messiah yet they didn't understand and that's what I want to really deal with this morning and in an in-depth way as we want to make sure we expect the right things when we expect what the Word of God is for the hour that we live in then we can see those expectations met and my my purpose then is not to limit your expectations but to grow our expectations because we don't want to settle for the word of another day we don't want to just go back to the word to what Luther had and Wesley had her Pentecost had but we want to be able to come into the fullness of what is expected to be in our day right now and so they come and brother Brennan says here those people that read the scripture day by day watch him come riding in and cried who is this they come to every day and they watched him and said who is this see it's God fulfilling his word to the people that should have known what it was but they didn't know it Jesus own disciples had expectations of his arrival in Jerusalem you know I think they came there that weekend expecting to take over and to them him coming in riding in like that and the people crying Hosanna they must have thought man this is this is it it's gonna happen it's finally gonna happen we're gonna be the rulers we'd find out they even begun to argue among themselves at the Last Supper they began to argue among themselves who would be the greatest and they had expectations of being the right hand man to the king they believed he would be a king but they didn't see that he had to die even though he told them right out that he had to die they still didn't believe it and so Jesus in going through this time he had his face set to Calvary but they were worried about who would be his right-hand man when he took over Israel not realizing that there had to come his death burial and resurrection then the entire Gentile age you know many times our expectations we there's things we don't know and that's a good revelation to get for all of us there are things we just don't know and we're never gonna know some things because we're finite even if you knew some things you forgot them before you even could think to use them and so there's things that we'll never know even though we have a message that's perfect that a god that's perfect and a word that's been opened in our day we have an open book but there's some things we just don't know but we know that God knows and the disciples there were things they didn't know so they base their expectations as if they knew everything right but we should only base our expectations on what we know what do we know what's written in the word and what's been revealed in our our that's what we know so we shouldn't be expecting things people are expecting another messenger to come or or something else to happen or there to be some kind of a thing happened before the rapture and you look at the scripture and message if you run it all the way through there's not anything promise before the rapture and we're gonna go into that but there's expectations that people have that there will be certain things that'll happen and in reality they're basing it on what they don't know but we want to base it on what we know what do we know we know there's a rapture coming what do we know these bodies are going to change what do we know we can have our healing what do we know these things we know we know that our redeemer lives we know that we're that he's the same yesterday today and forever we know that our our children will be saved we know there's certain things that we know and the things that we don't know we leave to God but the things that we do know we're going to stay with right now he was there and he come to his place Jesus began to do as the work they begin to do to him as the word said I can imagine that the expectations of the disciples changed that weekend it's kind of like they went from extreme one way to extremely up to extremely down because they were there in the city some of them watched he was beaten as they spit on him in the courtyard they watched as the crown of thorns was pressed down on his head they watched him as he was blindfolded and slapped by Roman soldiers and they said tell us who hits you we watched their king it's the crowd cried crucify him they watched him as he suffered and they watched him as he fell on the Via Dolorosa on the way to Calvary they watched him as he fell and Simon picked up his cross they watched if soldiers took a hammer and drove nails in his hands and feet and what you experienced teaches you things if you watch someone die you expect them to stay dead that's true if you watch someone whom I if you watch someone get sick in a certain way it's true to have faith many times we have to override our experience and they had experienced this they knew that he was dead they watched as he suffered for more than six hours Jesus hung on the cross as his lungs fill with water he's not able to breathe that he hung there suffering we cry to help my God my God why have stuff forsaken me and in that moment every one of their their faith must have been as low as it ever was he was unable to breathe and they brought him the the water and he refused it and finally they pour the wine that he refused it and finally he received the vinegar and he said it's finished they watched as the Roman soldier pierced his side watched as his broken body was taken from the cross maybe Joseph of Arimathea carried him he knew he was dead he carried his body to the tomb to the place where he would lay they watched as the stone was rolled over the grave they watch this the soldiers were placed on a guard and the seal was placed over the tomb but it could never be opened all the power of Rome would make sure that it was kept closed they watched him die it was over all of the expectation of human experience taught them that when a man dies he's dead we can go to job chapter 14 and reading about a man and what job's idea was and this is the common plight of a man job 14 and one man that is born of a woman as a few days and full of trouble he cometh forth like a flower that's cut down he also as the shadow and continue with not seeing his days are determined the number of his months are with thee now it's appointed his bounds that he cannot pass job says for there is hope of a tree if it be cut down that it will sprout again that the tender branch theraph will not cease though the root there have wax old and the earth and the stock thereof died in the ground yet through the sin of water it will bud bring forth boughs like a plant he says but man dies and wastes us away a man giveth up the ghost and where is he this is the experience of man he said as the waters fell from the sea and as the flood the chaos and dries up so man lieth down and rises not till the heavens be no more they shall not awake nor be raised out of their sleep listen they could take scripture and say he was dead and he would stay dead oh but thank God there was other scripture that would apply to that hour and job says hope that that would have tied me in the grave that that would have keep me secret until that wrath be passed that that would has to point me a set time and remember me now they remembered what the common plight of man was they remembered watching him die they remembered all the scriptures of how man dies and and his days are like grass and all of these things they knew that from experience all the wisdom of the Ancients told him a man dies he's dead even those that have been raised from the dead would die again no one could stay alive death was coming for every man there had been two in the Old Testament that had been raptured escaped death and yet those that had been raptured those that had escaped death had never died once you're dead you're dead that's what they knew oh my or what they thought they knew but they should have remembered that there was a promise for the Stewart of a redeemer and the same job that wrote about death wrote this he said oh let's go to job 1414 he said if a man die shall he live again all the days of my appointed time will I wait till my change come what right does he have to expect this he said thou shall call and I will answer thee that won't have a desire to the work of that hands listen Joe said because I'm yours you made me Lord so you're gonna want what you made oh my don't don't don't ever think that you've gone too far for God to redeem you why because you're his he said you'll have a desire to the work of your hands amen and then in job chapter 19 he said oh the verse 23 oh that my words were now written oh that they were printed in a book that they were graven with an iron pen and led in the rock forever for I know oh my I know this is something that he knew he wasn't he wasn't guessing at this he said I know my Redeemer liveth that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth and though after my skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh shall I see God whom I shall see for myself man I should be holding none another don't my reigns to be consumed within me so he's saying though I'm so dead that I'm actually decayed and the worms have eaten it up and everything is gone my insides and everything are gone yet I know I'll see him for myself amen they should have remembered when David said in Psalm 16 and 10 for that will not leave my soul in Hell neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption and brother branham tells us that Jesus believed that one scripture about himself and went down into the grave and come back again believing that one scripture hey Ben they couldn't see past their experience to the promise can I just talk to you about that from all that's so many times what happens with us we can't see past what we're going through to see the promise ahead we can't see past the present to see the future and so the future many times if you look at what's happening now the future looks bleak but so many people are looking and getting it they're looking through dark glasses and they're looking at the world in a depressed way but I'm here to tell you on Easter he still if he's alive and he's no no less alive than he's ever been he's still the same yesterday today and forever and so a god that rose from the dead has stayed present in our life has remained president in our lives so we expect certain things to happen and we expect my experience you say well maybe a man let's let you down and you expect a man to let you down maybe your kids are go certain way and you just expect them to continue that way maybe things are hard and you expect things to just continue the way that they are but remember he's the one who can change our expectations the disciples had every reason to expect that he would stay in the tomb and every reason to expect that the promise would not be fulfilled in Luke 24 21 two of them were walking on the road to Emmaus I'm trying hard to stay behind here today and for the we have one camera so I don't want to move but you know they said we trusted I read this the other day but it just I think it fits here as well they were disappointed they said we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed this room they put it in the past tense and the word trust is to expect or to hope we expected we expected him to do this but he didn't and because he didn't we expect now that he won't oh my how many times have we went through that same thing we expect God maybe to do something and he doesn't do it the way we want it and so then we expect it to just be like that but God has different expectations for us now they said we trusted that it was him and verse 25 they they go through a time they tell him and it's interesting they testify to him here's the stranger walking with them and they're walking along the way and they begin to testify to him and they begin to say you know the women went to the tomb and they found it empty and we don't know why and verse 25 then he said unto them o fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken why because they actually could tell the stories of what God did and not recognize what he did how many people in this message have done the same thing that can actually tell the stories of what happened without what the prophet of God what God did in our day what happened they could tell the stories but not recognize God sent a prophet but more than that God sent His Word and he came down in our day amen to open up the word to us how many people can see what happened but can't see what it meant oh my I trust that's not us this morning listen he said o fools and so far to believe all that the prophets have spoken youyou believe some but you didn't believe all ought not Christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory in other words shouldn't you have expected Christ to suffer these things based on what he said based on who he was based on what the scripture said and how he fulfilled every scripture shouldn't you have expected him to do exactly what he did and I would tell you about the message of this hour shouldn't they have expected things to happen just like they did because if you go back you find all through the message that he said I must decrease it he might increase he said that the word was coming and it came and it fulfilled I heard it fulfilled the expectations of God but maybe people's expectations were unfulfilled he said I ought not Christ who suffers he's saying shouldn't you've expected these things to happen beginning at Moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself hey Ben oh I'd like to listen to that sermon oh my we have the word in our day as well listen the word had to be open to them to change their expectations of what would take place and what had happened they had to have they had the word had to stand there and reveal to them look this is who I am that's what we need today we need the word to stand and reveal to us this is who I am this is what I'm doing today not not 2,000 years ago but today this is what I did this is what these things are and he took it back to the scripture because if you if you have the word and it's really the word it identifies itself with the scripture it never identifies itself with some theory it doesn't identify itself with what a man said but it identifies itself with the promise hey man so the message this message that we hold dear came with great expectation the entire religious world was made aware that something supernatural was among them and I brought a picture of the takoma meetings in 1948 what a difference than that at any church this morning in the u.s. even if we had everybody here that's a lot of people a lot of expectation a lot of people who were believing a lot of people who were aware something supernatural was among them but we find in as brother Benno's ministry goes on that like Jesus when at first the crowds followed him but then they begin to dwindle and but the brownness ministry goes on and the same thing happens and so we find that at the end of the ministry supernatural things begin to happen and if you show that next slide we find in an attraction on the mountain and in Life magazine they carried it that here was here was a picture of a cloud and brother branham inspired to turn it a certain direction turned it to the right and realized that here was the head of Christ perfectly now people say well we can explain how it got there well but it's in a certain shape the importance of the cloud is not how it got there although I believe it's supernatural but it's how its what shape that it's in right it's identifying something and I'll tell you this that kind of off my topic but the cloud will never convince an unbeliever to be a believer it'll never do that it's not it's a sign if it's a sign to the unbeliever and it is it's a sign that judges the unbeliever because how many people open that Life magazine who saw that and never thought anything of it never turned it to the side to see never maybe you had an opportunity to hear how many people have had an opportunity to hear have turned away from us and it's nothing it'll be judgment to the unbeliever but to the believer it will never be scientifically proven to be true and people today say well if I could get it scientifically proven then I would believe it it never will be no more than that the resurrection of Christ will ever be scientifically proven you can't prove it by science but science is theory it is if you take science what we know about science today will change tomorrow they tell me that the base of knowledge in the world doubles or something like that I think someone here preached about that not long ago how that the base of knowledge in the world doubles every few days now because knowledge has increased since the scripture said that it would but it doesn't change the Word of God they can learn more but God can't right now so we find that this picture meant something and brother Brown says the observatory's and all of them in Tucson are still asking research of science to try to find out what it is he said it's so high that they can't be fog mist or nothing up there what did it where is it that they're just as puzzled as that supernatural halo hanging under the sky and say was when the Magi has come in following a star saying where is he this born King of the Jews what was it God fulfilling his word there shall rise a star out of Jacob oh my he said in the God of heaven promise the evening time would have evening lights and he says three years ago this mystery was a prophecy what time is it sir but now it's history it's past the promise is fulfilled people still can't see that but the promise is fulfilled what time is it sir what's this attraction God fulfilling his word he's the same yesterday today and forever so when this happened expectations once again came and people expected we begin to receive these things when you come in the message I remember as a kid seeing the picture of the pillar of fire and seeing the cloud and those things that I had certain expectations of what that would be what this message was and and really it was more than what I expected it was different but it was more because I didn't understand really what it meant to me I understood the the the historical significance of it I understood that that the people were excited about it but I didn't understand what it would do to my life but now we were looking at that and people were looking at that especially during that time and maybe they thought there would be a return of these great healing meetings and maybe there would be a return of these things that are happening but they didn't realize that there was coming something greater and that was the word and the word came and was revealed and brother Branham died and people begin to fall away and begin to be disappointed and begin to think that like they did on the road to Emmaus where we trusted that it had been he was the messenger of the seventh church age we trusted that these things were true but see he did what God expected him to do just not what man expected him to do he doesn't have to come back to fulfill that it's already been fulfilled now look Luke chapter 3 and verse 15 we find that in John's time and we're going to tie this back into Easter in a moment so just with me he's in John's time he said as the people were in expectation and all men mused in their hearts of John whether he were the Christ or not you remember this what they did in Revelation that they fell down John fell down at the a at the angel he said don't do that I'm one of your brother in the prophets the one who was showing him those things and now here they were all people were musing is this cried the Christ and verse 16 John answered saying unto them all I indeed baptize you with water but one mightier than I cometh the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost with fire I can hear John answer back and said have you not read in the scripture what Daniel the prophet said the daily sacrifice will be done away with and that hour has arrived oh my now look they were wanting a return to the glory of Solomon's day they wanted to return to the kingdom of Israel they wanted to return but he said what's happening is exactly what was prophesied to happen it's just not what you expected he said that hour has arrived have you not read what I say it says in the fortieth chapter the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare the way of the Lord and about that time the Prophet turned oh my and said behold there comes the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world and so I'm brother Branham I'm picking up and I read through the the scripture and then brother Branham picks it up he says about that time the prophet turns said behold there comes the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world he said now what's the attraction it's changed from the Prophet to his prophecy right so now people that are looking at the Prophet with the expectation he did what he was expected to do but now what who what do we look at what the expectation we look at what he said we look at the word to see what is expected in her hour now so when John turned away and he looks he's looking at the people and he tells them the the people you're not expecting the right thing many turns and said behold the lamb of God and here Christ the focus went to him or it should have but many people didn't focus on Christ because they couldn't see that he was what was promised they wanted something bigger something world-shaking not realizing that this would changed the world now as we said experience told them in that time that he was dead and that he had failed to do what was promised you might look and forgive me for this but your message experienced whatever time you've been in the message and you've been around the things of God you might begin to think well these things are not what I supposed them to be it's not exactly my experience and but but as I said maybe you begin to realize then that it wasn't for the world to see but it was for me it didn't come so that the world would be a better place because the world just gets darker and darker but it came for me it came for for you it came for those seat of God that we're here to get us ready for a rapture so experience might tell you that there's nothing going on that maybe there's a failure in the message of the hours that there's a failure even in your own life and you feel like you don't come up to the place where you should be and what happens is false prophets come along and use that they use those feelings of inadequacy to try to make you think when you better listen to me are you gonna be lost they lose use that feeling of of insufficiency to make you feel like well if you believe this you'd be different if you if you followed this man if if you did things this way but what do we have to do we have to do like Abraham did experience told Abraham that there was no hope of children it was the hope of a son out of Sarah experience told him because he had been her husband for all of these years that have never happened he had probably 60 80 years of experience that it would not happen there was the hope of a child but the expectation his expectation was based not on his experience with Sarah but it was based on a promise very bad we have that same promise today we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed aren't you glad for that today 1st Thessalonians 4 and 17 tells us our promise since we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air so shall we ever be with the Lord wherefore comfort one another with these words that's that's a promise that's an expectation that we should have it may not be exactly like we see it in our minds eye but it'll happen right and if you can imagine you know I think we recognize that that the rapture itself will not be exactly the culmination of will not be exactly what we thought it's not going to feel like you think it's feel it feels does that make sense brother branham talked about a breeze come over you're a wave or something like that I don't know exactly what that is but I'm going to experience it it might be different than what I expect but it's still a promise are you with me now oh my and it'll happen it'll happen these bodies will literally change it won't be nothing spiritual in that sense it'll happen we don't have the spirit of spiritual eyes it'll happen we don't have to spiritual eyes seeing Christ he'll be there we're gonna see him in body form or the man said that's what believers believe so he he tells us to that we're gonna meet caught up together with them in the clouds and maybe we don't know exactly what our that takes place or when exactly that's gonna happen you say well it's between 6 and 9 but then you can begin to think about different time zones different parts of the world and you begin to think how's it gonna happen well if you sit there and try to figure it out you're just going to end up not knowing any more than you do now but if you realize that God has it in his time and his in his control then your expectation begins to be not that I can change or know the event of what's going to happen but that I can be changed to be able to go now our promise it's not of a worldwide revival in recognizing your day in its message brother Brown said see where everything is Israel where the church were the immoral where the bride is standing what's left the next thing taking up of the pride he said of course every church is looking for a great thing Who am I he said every church is looking for a great thing I don't come to bring you any great thing this morning but the steward if he's preaching doesn't come to bring you any great thing we come to bring you the Word of God but every church is looking for a great thing the Pentecost say glory to God there will come a days that they're going to do this and they're going to do that see he said there are professors they do believe and he says I'm skipping through this but you can find it recognizing your day in this message he says why I go in the businessmen convention with them they say glory to God then preachers get up and just stir the crowd and say there's coming a great revival the hands of the Lord is going to be upon the earth how the people are going forth running like and don't realize that's under the trumpets for Israel why do they do it he said it's because their Christian professors and don't realize neither did kfs realize what he's doing you realize what they were doing they were prophesying of a great revival and trying to kill the revival at the same time here they were prophesying of a great revival he said canvas didn't know what he was doing they don't realize that they're rejecting the very message that sent to them oh my and their expectations should have been of a rapture in a resurrection what should our expectation be at Easter time it should be going home going home but they failed to see the opening of the word which identified the promise for their day even though the veil was rent from the top to the bottom they still couldn't see it he was in plain view but they were blinded by a traditional veil or Church we could just recognize there's got to be some time when our eyes are open we can see God this is what you did in our hour aren't you glad he still moves today now brother Branham says in spiritual amnesia he said now look he said I want to ask you something what if he does come tonight oh you say he isn't he said I don't know whether he is or not I'm somewhat coming tonight so I don't know whether he is or not this is the last sign said remember thus saith the Lord did you ever hear me say that but what it was true you are seeing your last sign that scriptural you've seen he said your last sign Pentecost he said don't get mixed up now with what he promised Israel after the rapture he said that ain't you he said you're done see he said now is your day now is your sign now is your time don't reject it don't do it you better come but they did reject it now in matthew 16 and 4 it says a wicked and adulterous generation seeks after a sign there shall no sign be given unto it but the sign of the prophet Jonah now what was that sign but the brown calls it the sign of the resurrection we could say it this way it was the Easter sign right Easter was he's alive that's what he strips about it's not about the bunnies or the or the eggs or anything else he's alive hey man he's living and after being buried and dead denominational twos he came forth in our hour and proved himself to be alive he was alive the whole time but they'd shut off the effects of it to the people that's what the denominational Creed's did but the render says the Holy Spirit was bound by those demons in the Euphrates River bound by denominational demons for 2,000 years but now it's been loosed just like the demons were loosed so as the Holy Spirit been loosed he was bound the effects of it were bound to the people because of denominationalism but now we have the ability to come and believe in a resurrected Christ so he said don't you have the sign of the resurrection and brother Barrett says and today well I'm so glad we had a prophet that could be certain of what he was talking about he said today after 2,000 years we still see Jesus Christ oh my that ought to make us happy this morning we still see Jesus Christ why can you believe that he's not just the story it's not just something we share on Facebook but he's alive we still see Jesus Christ in the power of his resurrection standing among us doing the things that he did then and promised to do he said a wicked and adulterous generation will speak after a sign always wanting to show me this if you can do this and do this they'll get it the sign of the resurrection bed now look he said he is the same yesterday today and forever the word made manifest welling among us how we should thank God for his great sign see I don't need miracles to prove God is true I believe in miracles I believe miracles are here but it's because he's here I don't need miracles to prove God is true I don't need a bunch of people in the church to prove that God's alive we don't need to have a great revival to prove the God's alive we'll have a great meeting or whatever in people I'm sure I'll be right there with him I love to shout I love to get in the spirit but I don't need that to prove God's alive God proved himself to be alive he proved himself in our generation and now it's come down by the David into our life and he's proved to in us he's living amen he hasn't proved anything in me what were you what were you what are you now you want to know if you're born again what were you what would you have been had your life's not been affected by this message what would you have been if you'd not been born again what would you have been you look at maybe you got family members that are out of the Ark of safety and maybe the drunks or whatever else that they might be and you think that's what I would be I'm no better than them but for the grace of God what is it this message changed me oh my it's more than just a set of rules for a bunch of words on a book but this message is Christ risen from the dead to be the same yesterday today and forever so I would ask what should we be expecting this Easter what should we be expecting and I begin to think on these things what should I expect as a minister standing here before you what should I expect what what should you expect when you come to here what should we expect when we read the word in our hour what should we what should we be expecting to happen of course we're expecting a resurrection we're expecting a body change but what about now today if it's tomorrow what about today what should we be expecting today yes we're expecting that to take place but in the meantime what do we expect but the random goes through this and if you get a chance read the end the last 30 minutes or so we're listening to it of Christ as the mystery of God revealed and I've cut through it and so you just bear with me but there's some things that brother Branham says that just just completely explain to us what we should be expecting brother Brown said then we can see that the marriage supper is at hand hey Ben I skipped ahead he said now we see the promises being fulfilled I'm back on that previous one now we see the promise being fulfilled sister Joanna's doing her best back there and I'm skipping around but I just feel the presence of the Lord here this morning you believe he's here a man he'll he'll speak to you if you let him this morning he said now we see the promise being fulfilled Christ the true headship going in coming in his bride doing the same works that he did at the beginning and making ready and fulfilling his word as he did it first in John 14:12 he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also notice he says then the head and the body are becoming one better listen in works and in sign and in life think that through put on your spiritual thinking cap this morning the head in the body of becoming one in world and in sine and in life vindicated by God his self through his promise word for the last days he promised this in the last days he said now if your spiritual you'll catch it they said well there be a great meeting a great healing meeting that's what he promised though that's already been fulfilled Sun of righteousness come with healing in his wings has been fulfilled but what does he promise for our day for the head in the body to become one hey man it warps and sign and in life hey man he said then we can see that the marriage suffers at hand he said now if I never see you again remember the marriage separates at hand and then the kingdom according to the promise is ready to be issued in the great millennium they're taking up for the Church of the destroying of the wicked not say well glory to God we shout hallelujah we see that ain't it said I'm a missionary have been seven times practically over the world I've seen heathens devils and everything else dancin shall said I've seen all kinds of fleshly manifestations that's carnal but I'm talking about the headship of Christ so he's not he's not saying that it's wrong to dance and shout because brother Branham did it it's not wrong to be excited because that's the natural reaction of the flesh when it feels the spirit right but what he's saying is that ain't it just like to Elisha the wind wasn't it the whirlwind wasn't it and and the storm wasn't in all those things but when he heard a still small voice that moved the Prophet to come out of his cave hey man and I believe when we hear the voice of the word it ought to move us to come out of our our Creed's come out of our denominations come out of what we think and say Lord I believe you'll keep your word he said I'm talking about the headship of Christ notice being personally identified by the original headship we have the answer to the devil's question oh by the devil question said to Jesus if you're the Son of God he questioned him and said are you really him and the answer was that he did what the word said he would do hey bet he rose from the grave then I tell you today we have the answer to the devil's question he said amen glory we have the answer to the devil's question he Christ is risen and has paid the price so the devil comes today is there are you really a Christian he's risen are you really are you really expecting your healing he's risen are you really expecting God to overcome the coronavirus he's risen are you really expecting to come up out of that valley that you're in he's risen hey Ben he's alive he's risen but look he said we have the devil's answer he said he's he's risen and paid the price and raising up the the body he said you think I'm beside myself I'm not we've got the devil's answer not me that liveth but Christ the word living in me that's why he can't stop us by putting us in our homes he can't stop us if we have to stay home he can't stop us if we can't all congregate together it won't stop nothing because the body is uniting with the head we don't unite with the head at church are you with me now you don't have to be here to be united with the head you don't have to be in any other person's Church see you're not with the head you don't have to live in Harding you don't have to live in the u.s. you can be anywhere where God has called you to be you'll go to church because you're United with the head you'll live right because you're United with the head you believe the right thing because you're United with the head oh my man he Christ has paid the price raised up the body he said you think I'm beside myself I'm not he said we've got the devil's answer what is this answer not me that liveth but Christ the word living in me whatever question the devil might have on Easter however our expectations were built up and then - whatever it is - swing on we have the answer to the devil's question Christ living in me man this is not my idea it's his power it's not my idea it's this word he promised it here it is hey he said it would be here and here it is we got his answer hope I stir all over the world is a season of hope for the Baptist's they believe in a Christ that was and lived and and they believed he can come in your heart but we see a Christ that is alive today for the Methodists or whatever that it is they serve God and maybe the best thing to hell but today I'm telling you there's been a furtherance of the gospel of the word that we can see Christ as he is as he really is and how is that to see him in us Christ the word living in me he said Christ is risen and has paid the price for our Redemption what God in Christ manifested he gave that flesh and that blood that in the blood might come to life and the flesh be redeemed that God I love this that God in this redeemed flesh she couldn't manifest his word for the day as he did in that day that's how God manifests his word he don't manifest his word through through pages he manifested this is his word but he manifests his word in flesh are you with me this morning I'm trying hard to stay caged up here but to put some of them baby gates up here around me oh my you believe that this morning we have Satan's answer because we are the answer in this redeemed flesh God and this redeemed flesh could manifest his word for the day as he did in that day he said we have Satan's answer God has vindicated himself again I'm skipping through here but just kind of hitting the high points you can go back and listen I mean he said God has vindicated himself God has proved himself in hit to his promise in this day he did what he said he could do just think about how that they run all over the earth those 12 men those 11 men that stayed with him and and they all saw that he rose again and they believed it they went all over the earth read the gospel not one of them ever denied it after that they might have had faults and failures and everything else but they never denied again that he was risen from the dead what made him not denying the fact he came inside of him the fact that they could walk in the Holy Ghost the fact that they could live under the power of the Holy Ghost he came in them and they never denied it but listen we'd had the same thing happen in our day we've seen God supernaturally prove who he is the sign of the Resurrection then we can also go into all the world and preach the gospel he's risen he's alive and he's proved himself alive we have the answer to the devil's question he said God has vindicated himself God has proved himself to his promise in this day listen this is a profound statement hallelujah he said the headship is here hey bet Christ the risen Lord is here wasn't talking about himself people so carnal he wasn't talking about about about another man that would come some prophets some preacher but he said the headship is here this thing we didn't need another prophet the one we had said behold the lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world he said he said the headship is here Christ risen Lord is here in the same power of his resurrection he ever was manifesting himself there's the devil's answer and Brent talks about some people that were raised from the dead in that time and he said that's the reason why this when this man sitting here dropped dead the other day sitting here we could say come back life because the Holy Spirit said so hey Ben he said what is it I'm skipping on down and he said nothing people the headship in the body has become one unit it's God manifested in his people that's the reason he said the husband and wife is no longer Twain they're one God in his church is one Christ in you consecrate revelation glory to God even bearing his name his name is Jesus The Anointed so the reason he's called Jesus he's the anointed the anointed body of Christ proving manifested God like that body did the anointing it's not a feeling but anointing is an empowerment so you are the anointed why because you're called Jesus mrs. Jesus Christ you've taken on his name the reason he's called jesus is he is the anointed it's the anointed body of Christ proving manifested God like that body did and that body love this that body that they saw died that body that they saw beaten that body that they saw tore up and falling and not able to hardly make it even to the cross that body that they saw cry my foot my god my god why has thou forsaken me that body has redeemed this body hey man that body has redeemed this body every of this these bodies and he said he said every of these bodies and through their God works just three full manifestation going to the kingdom risen paid the price were redeemed God has proved it vindicated it see justify on this site why are we justified we are his victory the church is his victory I told you I think I preached here long ago but the bride cannot fall the bride cannot fall and we should have gotten that through our head after these years as ministers we tend to get gloomy sometimes and I even do sometimes you wonder because you see people just aren't doing what they're supposed to be doing I'm not talking necessarily about you it like I said it gets kind of personal with all ten of you in here but but but just as a whole you see people not doing what they're supposed to be doing you get discouraged because bride won't fall we got to remember that his bride won't fall that's his word that's just promise there's already been a bride that fell and I see but there was a bride that wouldn't fall and so we are his victory if he doesn't have us he doesn't have victory we are his victory the church is his victory we come forth in this last days with this glorious gospel showing his victory he died for this purpose and we are proof of his victory when we see him coming down and living among the church that's his victory o Muhammad ready to close in a moment listen he said it shows that he couldn't keep him in the grave neither that can they keep us we're already potentially arisen because we've raised from the dead unbelief in his word from denominational Greece to an eternal word of the eternal God which is him himself working through us manifesting himself that he is the same yesterday today and forever he said brother men they just don't excite me we're like you it don't have to it don't have to you I believe your skill God's but I tell you there's something about it it just moves me there's something about it that just makes me want to say Lord let me say true to that word because if I stayed true to that word you'll always be there that word is true today just as it was true in the past he's still moves today musicians can go ahead and come I told you I was closing I didn't lie that time it was a at a conversation yesterday with the brothers that I went to Africa with last year or the year before and he just got back from northern Africa from Algeria Mauritania and I sent you the some of the stuff on that but he called me yesterday and gave me some details on something that happened it just thrilled me because we believe God is alive today and this man was well he went into he got the last ticket into Algeria before they shut everything down and some of those countries have really gotten serious about it because if it comes in their borders it's over you know there's nothing they can do about it it shouldn't kill a lot of people and so they shut down come from Mauritania which is a really really poor country into Algeria which is a little more wealth and it's at the very top of Africa it's a Muslim country and he gets into Algeria he's literally the last ticket they issued that they would honor to go in he gets into Algerian gets to the hotel and it's closed they have to find another hotel put them up and they finally get into a hotel and they're trying to figure out how they're gonna do this how they're gonna meet anybody there's only a few believers in the entire country so they don't know what their contexts are gonna be and after they've been there for a while it won't either come and knock on the door and it's a Muslim man with his robes on and everything and he comes knocking on the door and I brought the brother told me he said I didn't know if I was gonna get beheaded or what and he had been told by someone else that there was a man from America Christian minister that had come into that country and he had come to to pray for the sick and end to to preach the gospel and so the man come up there he said my brother is at the point of death he said I want you to come pray for it he said I didn't know he said but I felt led to go he said because I could've got my head cut off so he said I win he said this man lived in and like a palace a really nice house he said he went into his house his brother was laying there and their whole family was gathered around and their Muslims and brother Robert took that opportunity to preach the gospel to them and then he had all of them laid their hands and there was one one sister I think and and the brothers like eight or nine brothers that were there this man that was those dying and they all the brothers laid their hands but they don't believe a woman can touch a man so that's not her husband so they wouldn't let her touch and he said the Bible says all so he had her lay her hands on him too and they laid their hands on that on that man and prayed for him and every one of those people in that room gave their heart to Christ and so there's there's all these Muslim people and they leave from there and don't know what they're they're doing and they find another place of two hours away and they they end up accidentally in in another city that they'd wanted to visit originally and they end up in that city and end up being able to meet with a group of Christians and and they're unable to baptize anyone but they're gonna have work on getting on baptized because of the lockdown but they were able to meet with a group of Christians and actually livestream the services during that time to people who knew nothing about the message and nothing about the gospel and he said he was getting questions like this why did Jesus have to die you see there's got to be an elected seat out there somewhere if God would allow man to get the last ticket into a country and a Muslim man come asking for prayer that's more than most Americans would do I stopped the stripper by the side of the road one time a man on the way to church it over it but I've Eason a man was was laying there with blood all over him he'd gotten his truck had wrecked and I asked him if I could pray for him he said if you want to he said if it helps me he said but I don't really go for that kind of thing and I prayed with him but it was just he didn't want it oh my but they wanted it there's somebody somewhere that wants it what am I telling you that I'm telling you that because it encouraged me as I was studying on these things that he is still working through his bride the same as he did back there he's still the same yesterday today and forever maybe for us it doesn't happen just that way but the people that you meet on an everyday basis you don't know why there's people I met years ago that just now my ministry is having an impact on him and I met him years and years ago why is that because God wants to move in your life he wants to he wants to move he wants to use your hands and use your feet he is proving that he's alive today do we believe it today what are we expecting this Easter I'll tell you what I'm expecting I'm expecting God to keep his word I'm expecting healing can you say amen to that today wherever you're at this morning you say I'm expecting healing I'm expecting the word to be true I'm expecting if God said he would heal me he would do it I'm expecting my children to be saved I'm expecting God to move in our services I'm expecting I'm not expecting some great worldwide revival but I'm expecting God to come down and honor his word why because he's the same yesterday today and forever and today the head and the body had been united together oh if I could just tell you that to encourage you today because he lives because he's shown himself alive in our day we can know that he's living in us bow our heads I'm sorry I got too excited by do you believe he's living in you amen you believe it this morning you really know it maybe you've had experience in your life and viewed by your heads also out there as you're listening and watching just for a moment pause if you're cooking whatever it is that you're doing just pause for a moment if you can what are you expecting this Easter as I said I'm expecting God to keep his word I'm expecting and you can look at whatever may be your requests that you had this morning you're expecting God to meet that or that need but maybe the experience of your life has made you expect the worst and some people as I said they look through dark glasses and they just expect things to go bad why not come to the word today let him take your life and mold you to the expectation of the word that he's able to live in you he's able to walk through you and if there's a Muslim man on the other side of the world and he wants you to talk to that one man and that one family he's able to do that if there's someone at the supermarket he's able to he's alive and well in you today to walk to that person maybe for years you've lived before someone you don't think it's had any impact one day you'll realize it had an impact one day you'll preach the last sermon that someone will ever hear because I've never listened to a sermon like this one but they watch your life and he's alive and because he's alive you can still reach out he's still reaching he's still forgiving as he forgave when he was here he's still living through you he's still healing he's still doing the things through his body because the head and the body have come together in our day if you're not if you if your life doesn't match the word today you know that if it is I want to give you this opportunity wherever you're at this morning I know it's different we can't come to an altar here but if your life doesn't match the word you're doing things that you know are wrong I don't have to run over I don't have to tell you what's what's right and wrong you know in your heart if you just stop doing the things you know are wrong didn't you'd be you'd be more like Christ but if you could just in your life just say lord I can't handle it on my own come to the word today come to Christ it's that simple accept him into your life he said well I don't understand all these things that you'd preach this morning you don't have to you have to believe it and he'll give you the understanding as you have need of it let him raise your life maybe you're bound by drugs I don't know why I'm dwelling on this this morning but maybe you're bound by alcohol maybe you're bound by lust let him take over today you down on your knees where you're added just begin to call up to God he can meet you there he's alive and well he's not limited to here but he can meet you where you're at this morning Heavenly Father Lord Jesus wherever there's a people Lord that are gathered together wherever there's even two or three or maybe there's just one or that has come together with us online Lord to be able to watch the service Oh God would you just move in their midst today father I pray that there's one unconverted person Lord that they would be completely converted Lord that they would come to you they would be baptized in Christian baptism Lourdes have been given the opportunity on this Easter for a new life I bring you granted you got there's a reason we're here Lord was the reason we're still here father I pray that that last seed would come in we don't know that it's in Algeria Mauritania we might be right here might have been one of those men over there but it might be one of us Oh God speak to our children Lord speak to our young people speak Lord to those who are living the way that they should God help one to realize there's a better life there's more to life than just frolicking the things of the world but there's a life in you that brings peace and comfort and strength I pray he granted Lord Jesus Oh God he stress so looking forward to Easter here with the church so hard it seemed like that it wasn't able to be just exactly the way we wanted it but it was the way you wanted it Lord so I pray God that you would use this Easter Lord this fisherman these songs we offer them up to you today Lord you would use it Lord reach that lost sheep God that straggler Lord that that person that's doing what they know is wrong to do that that sheep this went away from the fold that one this left the ninety and nine may your Holy Spirit go out and reach out to that person today father may you reach out to us Lord to the city here and watching may be Christians Lord to just get discouraged from time to time help them to take courage and realize Lord we don't have to look through the dark glasses of this world we can look through
