trust it Lord according to your word where two or three are gathered together you said I will be in their midst and when believe that today Father we trust you we thank you for it help me Lord to be able to say the things that you want me to say ask in Jesus name amen Exodus Exodus chapter 3 and verse 1. we'll read down to verse 5. we got the new AC unit in so praise the Lord for that and we're those of you who like the cold are going to appreciate that and uh so we're we're thankful for that they got that in this morning we've got the meetings coming up next Thursday a week from tomorrow so I'm looking forward to that this is my Christmas so y'all just have to kind of bear with me a little bit I'm a little excited about it but we've got a bunch of people coming in and from or at least telling us that they're going to from out of town so thank you for your hospitality and and they come to see you all and and to experience the presence of the Lord that we have here and and uh we're just a part of the body of Christ the bride of Christ but we believe we his presence is here and we want to keep it that way and uh so we'll have musicians practice on Sunday night uh after the second service we'll we'll have a short second server us on Sunday we'll have a musician's practice and then they're going to do some cleaning and things as well I think in the fellowship hall isn't good to be a Christian tonight good to see all of you so many of us were all over the place on the fourth of July weekend it's good to see you in the house of the Lord tonight Exodus 3 and 1. now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father-in-law the priest of Midian and he led the flock to the back side of the desert and came to the Mountain of God even to Horeb and the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush he looked and behold the bush burned with fire and the Bush was not consumed and Moses said I will now turn aside and see this great sight why the bush is not burnt when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see God called unto him out of the midst of the Bush and said Moses Moses he said here am I and he said draw not nigh hi hither put off thy shoes from off thy feet for the place where on thou standeth is Holy Ground may the Lord with that is blessing to the word you may be seated we continue our thought of The Exodus family Moses had given up all thought of being a deliverer and sometimes that's what we need to do for God to be able to use us we need to maybe give up all thought of of our plans and our ideas and we talked about that a couple of Wednesday nights ago how that Moses was a prisoner had to become a prisoner to the will of God and and that's what God was doing there on the backside of the desert he was happy to live with his family he was happy to just continue on hurting the sheep and yet God had a great plan for his life God had a great thing that he was going to do and so we we don't we want to realize that the current situation of our life the state that we're in right now it won't always be that way God may be he may be planning to use us in a different way going forward but we've got to be willing to serve him where we're at before we can serve him in a greater way so now Moses had had to get happy with his condition where he was and he had to have all the ambition stripped out of him all the all the learning and things that was going on yet we know that it was time when Moses was there before it was time for the people to be delivered the 400 years was up and so I've wondered many times why did God wait but brother Branham says this he said a prophet can never deliver his message unless the people wants to hear it so God just called his Prophet Into the Wilderness he said sure took him out there let the people suffer a little longer till they was ready he said Moses was ready God was ready but the people wasn't they stayed 40 years longer because they wasn't ready that's exactly right could I say this maybe Moses was too ready maybe he was too ready because part of being a leader is that you've got to wait on the people to be ready so God had to strip his ambition remember that's what got him in trouble that's why he ends up with a stinking dead Egyptian in the sand is because he has uh he's actually had to be stripped of his ambition and his ambition gets him in trouble now uh Moses was the deliverer he was the one that God called and I believe God has called us in this hour to be the Overcomers of laodicea how many believe that tonight he's called each and every one of us to be the Overcomers of laodicea then what do we have to well we we're gonna we're gonna be that we're gonna We believe we're gonna be in a rapture we we believe we're the called of God we're the elected of God we're the Bride of Jesus Christ we're going to move mountains we're going to see the sick healed and the dead rays and the power of God move we're going to see those things and yet we remain many times on the backside of the desert why because God's doing something in our lives so being a prisoner of Christ requires you to wait until his time yeah and he does have a Time and we know that in Moses life there was there was uh three 40-year periods in each 40-year period had its purpose and I like to think about Moses because he lived a long time you know Jesus Jesus was crucified before he was even my age if he was 33. and I'm fixing to be 38. and I'm just using that because it makes me feel really old and he had already done his work and they say that the best years of your ministry is the first three years I think they saved your ministry but the Joel's the best year of your ministry best years of your ministry so that's a long time ago brother Danny a long time ago and yet I believe that each period of life has its own purpose it has its own every season has its own fruits right every time of year has its own purpose so am I we just realized that tonight now Moses had to go in brother Brown said and be the highest educated man in all the country he can teach the Egyptians wisdom he was a military man we're told by history he knew all the ins and outs how to do it and God let him get trained like that now listen to prove that you cannot accomplish for God in that manner come on come on he wasn't going to use one bit of his military training he wasn't going to use one bit of his Egyptian training in the Egyptian philosophies and and the Egyptian psychology he wasn't going to use any of it but what he did is he allowed him to be trained in that way so it was God's purpose for Moses to go be trained God caused him to be found by Pharaoh's daughter he was born into Pharaoh's house God wanted him to see that that would never work so in order for him to kill the Egyptian and see that that would never work and end up fleeing from the house of pharaoh he first had to join the house of pharaoh right so God had to let him get trained like that he says he uh he cannot accomplish to prove that you cannot accomplish for God in that manner his military all of his genius mind all of his education he bitterly and miserably failed by it God let him do it let him be educated and smart not because he was going to use his education because he was going to use his smartness if that's a word not because he's going to do that use any of that but he actually is he's going to use the space created by Moses weakness is what he's going to use but Moses has got to realize that none of that's going to work so God allows him to be smart so he can prove to him that smart don't isn't enough he allows him to be educated so he can prove to him that being educated is not enough so he met her he bitterly and miserably failed back God let him do it let him be educated be smart and I know what you're thinking Lord I why didn't you let our pastor be educated and smart or maybe why didn't you let me be educated and smart but he allowed Moses just to show him that wasn't enough and then it took him 40 years to educate him and then 40 years to beat it out of him and both was intended by God so I want you to see tonight both of those things were intended by God for the purposes of God yeah before he could use him he said that's right that's right took him out on the back side of the desert got rid of all the education he had yeah again he said he had him trained in worldly wisdom so that he could fail I believe God would do that he trained him in worldly wisdom so that he could fail and show that it isn't wisdom that will ever be delivered by oh my it's by faith that we're delivered and God sometimes will let us figure it all out and lay it all out and have everything just the way we want it we got all of our plans and all of our designs and all of our life figured out just to show us that it won't work yes yes sir oh my what's he doing he shows us that will never be delivered by wisdom will only be delivered by faith God bringing Deliverance had to train him in wisdom to let him fall to show that you cannot lean upon the arm of your own understanding or anybody else's understanding you're asked me anytime God will allow you to go through something he'll allow you to go through a season as a church you realize that he'll allow you to go through a season and you'll be lifted up and everybody will be talking good about you and everything be going on and then he'll allow something to happen and something comes and it kind of cuts you down he said why would he let us do that he wants you to see that it won't be by might it won't be by power but it'll be by the spirit of the Lord yes sir you let him become the highest until he would be the next pharaoh he was a mighty General according to history conquered Moses himself to countries around and then when he turned to the work of the Lord with all of his talent God let him take a headlong topple oh because at 40 years old Moses was still a baby when it come to the things of God take a headlong so that he could put him out there out there in humility and sent him down with a stick in his hand to deliver the people oh my Moses had an understanding that he was to be the deliverer from the teaching of his mother he said he'd trained himself in military might to do so but it failed he had the understanding he had the education but that didn't work so he had to forget it all and come to the simple thing of taking God in his word and then he delivered the people that's how you overcome listen to me church that's how you receive your healing that's how you receive Miracles that's how you come close to God that's how you deliver the people that's how you raise your family when you come to the simple thing I'm going to take God at his word if God says so I believe it and I'm gonna follow it to the best of my ability why but you're just taking God in this word in the Simplicity of it that's how your family is brought up that's how your family is restored that's how your your kids are brought in that's the thing that God wants to be an overcomer you've got to allow the simple thing of taking God in his word to become the main thing in your life now after all this training and untraining laughs God's getting ready to do something but before he can do it he has to get Moses in his presence five minutes is all he needed I want you to think about this tonight five minutes it's all he needed yeah he spent 40 years getting him trained in Egypt 40 years getting him untrained but when he come in the presence of God he only needed five minutes in the presence of the pillar of Fire now why did he need to come in that presence we know that the pillar of fire is the logos or the word that was manifested in visible form condescending to be seen right so God could not be seen no man has seen God at any time and so the logos is simply God coming into a form so that he can be seen right so now that form that he can be seen in was called the logos Brown said now that Pillar of Fire is the logos that went out of God the logos which is actually the attribute of the fullness of God I was fellowshipping actually with brother Jason Ward the other night by text about this thought that God does not diminish himself by it by how great he can be so great and yet not diminish himself by changing himself and brother random calls that he said and we studied it back when we were talking about the breach and he changed his strain he changed his strain I never understood that until covet happened you say what does that have to do with covet well coven changed its strain you remember remember we had one strain and then they said all the vaccines aren't going to work or nothing because it's Omicron now coven changed it's straight it was still covered but it changes strength but what did it do it diminished it yeah every time a virus changes its strain it loses something oh my every time any any sort of DNA any sort of living thing when it changes its strain it loses something but God changed his strength without losing any of his power without losing any of his ability without losing anything because he's he's Almighty right if you've got a if you've got a pound of sugar and you take out half a pound you you got half a pound left right because it's a it's a fallible resource it's not infinite it's a finite resource but when you take the logos out of God you haven't diminished anything don't worry can you see it tonight he had to come in the presence of the logons and it's simpler than what we think it is because that same presence that we feel in the service that same presence that is the logos the presence of God yes sir it is actually God condescending not to be seen with eyes but to be felt it has to be sure and we'll get to that in a moment now when president said when God becoming to a formed work can be seen it was the anointing of the great spirit that went forth It's condescending coming down God the father of the logos that was up over Israel he was holy could not bear sin now we know that God's presence can be felt how many have ever felt God's presence it can be felt it can be felt I've often wondered what Moses felt like the Bible doesn't record what he felt like but we know he saw the visible presence of God he saw God in a burning bush but there had to be a feeling associated with that a feeling of Awesomeness a feeling of Wonder a feeling maybe of Joy a feeling uh maybe a fear in some way of if this is the almighty God that he's about to come up to so now we know that that presence can be felt the writer said it this way he said I feel I feel filled with the spirit right now I feel the Holy Ghost I feel his presence I know he's here he said I'm positive he's here I see him yes sir now brother Brandon being a prophet many times would say can't you see that and the people couldn't see it right there would be a pill the logos would be in the meeting right yes don't let it throw you off too far but the logos is always in the meeting the logos are still in the meeting today because God's here where two or three are gathered together I will be in their midst what forms he going to be in he's going to be in in the condescending form that we can feel him in and we can know that he's here right and I believe brother said the only thing that keeps you from seeing into that other dimension to actually see the form that he's in to see that Pillar of Fire to see those angels He said it's the flesh that it's actually this this flesh keeps us and that's why he said the servant of Elisha when when he couldn't see saw the syrians coming against the city and and the prophet told him so there's more with with us than be with them and he said well I don't see anybody else and the prophet said open his eyes Lord when the prophet prayed for his eyes to be opened he saw horses and Chariots of Fire on all the mountains but the man said if you could press Beyond the Veil of the flesh you would see Angels after position at every pew oh my what is it it's another it's in another dimension but it it calm descends down to this Dimension to be felt by his people he said I see him I know he's here I see him moving that great Pillar of Fire glory in a manifestation of his being the deity of his presence great August being now you do not and I want to be careful with this because we do not base our faith on how we feel right we don't base our faiths on being able to feel the logos right that's why it's called faith faith is when there's nothing there but you believe in Sarah anyway that's faith but the logos the presence of God is there he allows you to feel that because many times that builds our faith and he lets us do that now but you've got to believe it or you can't feel it and that's why many times a stranger could come in Among Us or maybe somebody that's backslid or maybe sometimes us ourselves when we're not in the service we're not participating in the service we're here but we're still fixing the car we're here but we're still at work right and we can't feel the presence of God and other people might be able to enter in sitting right beside you and tears streaming down their face and they're worshiping and and praising God they can feel the presence of God and you're sitting there so I don't feel nothing well you've got to believe who's here before you can feel it and to believe the whole mind don't you realize what God did for us in this day he didn't give us just any kind of word he gave us a word of authority that you could see that God was speaking in our hour that you could hear the word that was spoken when I preached the message of the hour he said the pillar of fire always accompanies the message of the hour so then you would know and you could have faith to believe God's here the word is here that means God is here right or do you see it tonight amen I hope I'm not going to too deep for us but I want us to understand there is a validity to feelings it's not where we place our faith but there is a real feeling of the presence of God people would feel when they came near the pillar of Fire now brother Branham he does this hundreds of times and he would explain it to the people as they come up in this instance he said how do you do we're strangers to each other the sister says yes Lord Jesus knows us both he said now don't be afraid see then you're kind of feet just relax it's his presence and many times and maybe this will help us when brother Brown was talking see if you're all nervous and you're all bound up and and your old tits and and under strain you can't receive from God like you do when you're relaxed and brother Brandon would tell the people he said Relax and say let that man speak to me when they come up they would be tense because they would feel something was different they would feel that that that the presence of the Angel and brother random would tell them he'd say relax relax he said and begin to think on the blessings of God think on the word of God think on the mercy of God many times we come to church two tents free and that's why we don't we're tense about the days of this we're tense about the unpaid bills but if you could just relax a little bit and let yourself come into another realm you begin to feel the presence of God maybe somebody would come say well I've been to church over and over I never feel the presence of God I don't ever maybe it's because you're you're seeing a pillar of fire but you don't recognize it as something Supernatural it was Moses faith when he saw the pillar of fire that caused him to recognize brother Harvey that that Pillar of Fire was a supernatural being otherwise it was just another burning bush got hit by lightning or something else my brother Brown said he didn't try to make it scientific try to figure it out he said let me turn aside and see oh my God oh look he said now just relax it's this present see that's it it's his presence he said no you have a real strange feeling odd kind of a sweet humble like feeling now standing in the presence of a man wouldn't make you feel that way oh my God I'll be honest I'd be honored to stand in the presence of William Branham but what they were feeling was not the presence of William Branham it was the presence of the angel right and so he says now standing in the presence of a man wouldn't make you feel that way how many ever seen that light that Pillar of Fire pillar of light fire it was taken right here in Texas first time second time it's hanging he said it's hanging right by the woman in this Dimension now you remember what happened we watched the video here a few Wednesday nights ago where he talked to the to the black women that were sitting back in the audience and that Pillar of Fire moved over him he said can't you see that Pillar of Fire it's hanging over a colored lady sitting back in the corner and she began to shout why she felt the presence of it she probably didn't see it but she felt the presence of it and she knew that it was that it was that it was real right oh my she'd been able to touch by faith she'd touch the presence of God now God dwells in another dimension only accessible by faith but when it comes to our five senses it's his condescending that's what he did in Christ he he poured himself into Christ and they never saw the pillar of fire while Christ was here because he was the pillar of fire he was the low cost he was in the form of the son of God in the form in the form of a body of a fish and so he walked among men and and but they could touch him that's why the Bible says that which we have seen which our hands have handled the word of God right he was God in flesh and so now but but here he said it's expedient for you that I go away because if I go away I'll come again and I'll come in another form and in that form of the Holy Ghost or the brown calls it turning back into the pillar of Fire because we know that the pillar of fires the Holy Ghost right and so when you turn back into the pillar of fire it was licks of fire that fell on each one of them there on the day of Pentecost tongues of fire is what the Bible says licks of fire that went on each one separated himself into the people of God so now he's going he's condescending he went back it was actually more beneficial for them to have that Pillar of Fire and to know that he was within them than it was for them to be actually with him where they could see him and handle him so what they had after Pentecost was better than what they had before that's what he told them it would be what we have today is better than the literal Jesus Christ standing here in front of you now because we have the pillar of fire and the pillar of fire came back to the age it was not with just a man but it was Return of the word and the fullness of the word came the fullness of the spirit as well to dwell among the people are you with me so far well you said brother Ben what does his presence feel like well David it was a man who knew the presence of God and he says this he says in psalm 16 11 in thy presence is fullness of joy at thy right hand there are pleasures forevermore and he describes in Psalm 63 and 1 how that his how he thirsted for the presence of God he said oh God Thou Art my God early will I seek thee in other words that's that word is fervently will I seek thee my soul thirsteth for thee my flesh longest for thee in a dry and thirsty land where no water is in the original it says my flesh faints My Flesh faints I I I can't make it without your presence Moses said that he said if your presence doesn't go with us don't send us I need something that I can see something that's real and sometimes we need something we need to go beyond just a theory and we need to spend five minutes in the presence of God where we'll know that we met him and we know that he's real did my flesh faints Longs for thee in a dry and thirsty land where no water is to see that power and my glory so as I have seen thee in the sanctuary because thy loving kindness is better than life my lips shall praise thee thus will I bless you while I live I will lift up my hands in thy name so he's he's describing reactions to the presence of God now Joy is not the presence of God lifting of hands is not the presence of God praising him with your lips is not the presence of God but it is a Biblical reaction to the presence of God right yeah Clapping Your Hands and worshiping worshiping with a loud the Bible says well on the loud symbols worshiping him with a loud song worshiping him in the quietness of of the early morning worshiping him on your bed at night those are all biblical ways to acknowledge the presence of the Lord when did you worship the word worship is to prospect yourself before a Majesty when would you worship the king now think about it when would you worship Him when you come in his presence that's when you worship it when you come in his presence now if you realize he's always with you what does that make you constantly it makes you a worshiper it makes you a worshiper wake up in the morning and say oh God I'm so glad you've given me another day you've given me strength in my hands to work thank you for being with me thank you for me he says when my soul shall be satisfied with mods with Morrow and fatness my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips oh God you're so lovely you're so wonderful you're so great to me now I'm not just in church but all day long because I know your presence is with me I know it even when I can't feel it because I know your word says that I'll be with you even in you who am I so he says when I remember thee upon my bed and meditate on thee in the night watches because there has been my help therefore in the shadow of thy Wings will I rejoice in the shade of your presence brother Branham he identifies it like this and talking about the pillar of fire and I don't have time to bring all the quotes tonight but he talked about sunlight and he talked about warmth he said you may not a man who was blind he said could not see the sun and so he could never prove the sun was there by sight because he didn't have access to that dimension right but he felt its warmth and he could know when the Sun was shining because of the warmth of it on his skin because he can still feel even if he can't see and though you may not be able to see the pillar of fire even though I believe God could make himself visible even in this Dimension like he did in the picture you understand he actually condescended into this Dimension but many times the pillar of fires in another dimension and it couldn't his picture couldn't be taken in another dimension by a camera couldn't be taken taken by a video recorder in another dimension but uh but the warmth of the spirit of God the warmth of the pillar of fire the warmth of the burning bush can still be felt is good think I'm crazy but it's the truth the Browns had a man that believes now there's the key I challenge you to believe you know we have meetings and there's no difference in whether God's with us in the meeting or a Wednesday night service that God was with us tonight well he's with us right now but what it does it raises your faith it raises your expectation I told you it's my Christmas man I I want to I want to see the presence of I want to feel the presence of God I want to participate and be fed by the word of God just like you get fed by the word of God why because I begin to feel that sunlight it begins to filter down that warmth that comes over me and it raises my faith it raises by faith to a place that I can believe God believe me for my healing believe me I got things I need to believe God for I know many of you have things you need to believe God for and so you need to be in the meeting make every effort to be in a meeting because when we gather together all those licks of fire come together what happens it raises our faith it raises our faith in the presence of God a man that believes in God can see the presence of God feel the presence of God sense the presence of God and know he's here he is here to answer everything that he made promise for in this thing he promised you your healing he promised you salvation he promised the salvation of your children and he's here to answer that many times in a in a service like this one tonight where you feel the presence of God your faith begins to be elevated and you begin to see things happen right You Must Believe to benefit from his presence Hebrews 11 and 6 but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God the person who would approach the presence of the logos must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him with faith caused Moses to turn aside and go to the meeting right you can use it that way Faith caused him to go to church that night Faith said it's hard on me tonight but I'm gonna go I'm going to turn aside I'm gonna take five minutes and five minutes is all God needed [Music] amen he didn't need three hours he didn't need 24 hours he needed five minutes and Moses said I'm going to take five minutes I wonder how many times we rush out of the service we rush on to Homer we rush down to the place where we're going to either we or we go somewhere else and we rush through the day and we don't take that five minutes to spend in the presence of God not realizing that could be the most crucial five minutes of our life that morning prayer might be the most crucial five minutes that there ever was that time we spent in the scripture might be the time to change our life because we're in the presence of the logo Faith to cause him to turn aside all that he would stir up your faith he would stir up my faith tonight to turn aside for five minutes in the presence of God he didn't try to explain it scientifically but he just turned aside now Moses needed to be in the presence of God to be changed and to receive his Commission for what he was already born to do brother Brown Stadium was brought up under the very precept of Education under every precept of Education that could be brought he was a king son but still trying himself failed to make it go over but in five minutes hey brother man where'd you get five minutes from the prophets of the age he says it over and over and over again he said but in five minutes in the presence of the burning bush he'd become a new person amen oh if Moses said no now listen if he had known that that was going to be the life-changing event that that was going to be the moment that it was he would have made he'd have done everything he could not to miss it listen if you realize that you're five minutes in the presence of God could change your life you do everything you could to be in that presence you'd lay aside everything to turn aside and see the supernatural he become a new person something happened and what we need today he said in our seminaries is not so much theology to be taught but a burning bush experience where men get down before God and meet him face to face we need a challenger today like we had on that day he said what we need is men and women who has met God and know what they're talking about not somebody trying to teach you from some church book or some open theology what we need today is a man that's been in the presence of a burning bush has been born again and changed and made a new creature that's the type of person we need today that's the kind of person that will stay on the firing line regardless of what comes or goes oh my it was Moses in the presence of the burning bush that's why I believe many of you have been in that presence let's stay in his presence it was Moses in the presence of The Burning Bush was better equipped in five minutes in the presence of God than 80 years of schooling he'd given yes yes in the presence of God five minutes give him more knowledge of God and better equipped him than 80 years of schooling brother we don't need so much theology we need neology today five minutes in the presence of the burning bush 80 years he'd shun 40 years on the desert running and five minutes in the presence of God at the burning bush he was ready to go here you are now he said may I say this with reverence it's tonight that when God calls him in many times he has to step out of the political ranks out of the social ranks and walk out into a place if it would be necessary if his associates had to say he's gone crazy or become a Holy Roller but it's that secret place that spot yeah yeah he said oh don't miss it my loyal friends every one of you that's received Christ of all your teachings your fine pastors your great affiliations with your churches which is all right he said don't misunderstand me but you're trying to place that before this you said but in my church the pillar of fire is seen in my church we feel the presence of God in my church but what about you have you spent five minutes in The Presence of Jehovah or are you just relying on the fact that you are affiliated with the church have you spent five minutes in the presence of God have you spent five minutes in in the in the knowing that he's real where you absolutely all doubt was cleared away and you knew beyond the shadow of a doubt he's here he's right here with me have you gotten to that place he said you're trying to place that before this five minutes it don't have to be some great thing we have no record of what Moses did right like it it may he may have run around the place we know he made some excuses tried to argue with God amen some of y'all sitting in church arguing with God right now he said how do you know well we argue with the word right that's what he did we don't know if he jumped and run around the church but we know one thing his life was changed when he come out of there he come out with a new purpose he come out with a new heart he'd come out with a new desire he come out with a with a goal set in his mind he knew what he was born to do and he was ready to go do it before he had a head knowledge of who he was but now he had a heart knowledge of who he was five minutes in the presence of God changed him he said that little time that God gets you away from your Associates get you way back in the corner brings you into a place in a secret place where that the wisdom of the world becomes so unsufficient to where all the education that you ever had doesn't mean nothing into that divine presence to the lust of the eye gets so dim you can't see it anymore until the love of money is completely vanished away from you oh God glad he didn't say money was completely vanished away but the love of it and when you stand there alone with Jehovah God that's the things that counts that's the things that makes you forget all you ever knew that's where Moses had to get what a beautiful picture God revealing himself there in a burning bush and Moses knew more about God in five minutes in the presence of that burning bush then he learned 40 years in Egypt he said that's the place to be alone with God the spirit of God that moved on the face of the waters that logos that went from God moved over the face of the waters every seed that was in the water became what it was in the presence of God you realize that's where we stand today we've got to spend time in his presence and doing that again is it's not it's not like well I'm not going to work I'm not going to do that but but you need to take five minutes just five minutes that's all he needs but five minutes without doubt five minutes without fear five minutes without looking at what somebody else thinks about you yeah just break clear through for five minutes in the presence of the light he said Moses learn more in five minutes time in the presence of that fire and he learned in 40 years of education yeah he knew more about God in five minutes in the presence of that light than he did in 40 Years of studying and schooling how his mother had taught him that he was to be the emancipator of Egypt all these Saints he had been taught by his mother and by teachers and by schools yet he knew more about God in five minutes in the presence of that light he said I believe today that if the teacher would go into the presence of God instead of so much schooling and trying to twist and to make it fit certain theologies just go in the presence of God you'll learn about God and then we find after that that Moses was willing what Moses slacked the burning bush had amen he said what we lack in our church the Holy Spirit has for us oh we have needs as a church there's things we need but what we lack in our church the Holy Spirit has for us do you believe that tonight let's spend five minutes in his presence and let him give us what we need for the Bible said in five minutes in the presence of that supernatural being he was better equipped than all the wisdom that Egypt could have given five minutes before he was a running coward but after that experience of being in the presence and knowing that God of the Hebrews live he acted different from then on now Moses needed that five minutes because he would face opposition you need that five minutes in the presence of the pillar of fire because you're going to face opposition as a husband as a dad as a as a father as a mother as a as a worker whatever it is that you are you're going to face opposition in your calling Satan's going to try to come against you he's going to try to destroy you there's going to be false prophets rise up there's going to be false teachers rise up you've got to be in the presence of God have spent that time in the presence of God so you can be ready to face opposition here would come Pharaoh opposition to Moses here would come Janice and Chambers even Aaron and Miriam who were who were real children of God but at times they become Moses opposition sometimes your opposition becomes those of your own house you got to set your face make sure you've been in the presence of God at one time the whole nation wanted to kill Moses and God even came down and said step out of the way Moses I'm going to destroy him but Moses because he'd spent five minutes in that great attribute of God called luck he displayed the character of that light he displayed the character of that logos he displayed the character of Christ and he said Lord save me first don't take them take me and he stood in the breach for the people why because of five minutes in the presence of God five minutes before he was a coward but now he was a warrior you know I'm going to digress for a moment I'm almost done but you know there's two ways to to cook a steak on a grill just had to bring that up didn't I some of y'all haven't had dinner yet there's two ways to cook a steak on a grill you can sear it and then cook it right or you can cook it and then sear it now what do you do what are you doing when you sear a steak I know this is way off the beaten path but just hang with me when you sear a steak what you're doing is you're getting it in the presence of the fire right because if you've got it on your grill you got it way away from the flame you don't want to burn it but if you're going to sear it you got to get it right on the Fire put it right close to the fire so it can be seared and what that does is it melts on the outside most of the fat and and all the little pieces on the outside and causes them to coagulate together I guess that's the word it caused them to all melt together and what it does is it creates a crust and you wouldn't think that would be good but it's it's essential to having a good steak right and so you can do that either at the beginning of the Cook or at the end now when Paul come to God and remember we don't judge people's experience only by the word right Paul comes to God and he he has an experience with God God Sears him by the fire right and then he takes him and Cooks him on the back side of the desert right maybe he's ready Moses got cooked literally in the desert that's why God sends the desert he had to cook them Moses got cooked and then it was called her hey with paulus called her or with Moses called a reverse sear a reverse sear is when you cook them first and then you sear it the end products the same now God might have cooked you first and then he's going to sear you now he might have seared you first and now he's going to cook you but either way he's going to pick a finished product he's going to get what he wants out aren't you glad for that today and brother Brown said every man that goes to the field to preach the gospel should never leave until he has that back of the desert experience to all them juices are seared in no one could explain that out of your mind he said no matter how much they twist the scriptures and say this sad or the other if you've ever met God face to face in the true baptism of the Holy Spirit there's not enough theologians in the world to ever erase it from your memory something happened you were there when a man gets that place there's no one can explain it from him but you see you don't don't get discouraged say well I wasn't seared I started with God and I went maybe years and I never really never really had that great experience with god well he just waiting he's going to sear you think I'm crazy but I'm not just wait you're gonna come in the presence that fire one day don't get discouraged don't give up so I've not had that great experience so maybe you're looking to emotion what you need to do is look by faith say hey I see the supernatural let me turn aside and get in the presence of the light but Brothers many most of us I think he he Sears us gives us that good experience then we start going through some things he said when the person finds that place in Christ the faith that says by his stripes I'm Healed there could not be enough doctors in the world tell you you were fixing to die no matter what your symptoms are you still believe it anyhow right he needed courage he said Moses running from Egypt 40 years on the desert but five minutes in the presence of that bush the next morning here he goes down to Egypt his wife sitting a straddle of a mule with a youngin on each hip and him a man 80 years old with an old stick in his hand the whiskers are blowing where are you going Moses going down to Egypt to take over before he'd been scared to do anything more than keep the Sheep and now he goes down as a one-man Invasion to take over a world superpower Oh my he said the thing of it was he did it he said but a man that claims to be a Christian has no right and the pulpit or has no right in the office a leader anywhere until first he has climbing them steps into a place where he's born of the spirit of God filled with the Holy Ghost in such a way that nobody can explain it away from him again the other people around you might doubt it because it may not be an outward show but it's something that was real to you man 40 years more he got all got him all trained down all the education theology out of him he said I skipped one he said he bled him on the back side of the desert he knew more about God in five minutes in the presence of God than he learned in 40 years books the books are necessary but you'll learn more about God in five minutes of his presence more cooking takes place on the stake in five minutes being close to the fire than it did the whole time but both were necessary you understand but you've got to get in the presence of the pillar of Fire where you going Moses I'm going to my job to take over become Adam and Eden again where are you going Moses I'm going to my home to become to become like Eve and even again my family can be right where you going pastor I've been in the presence of God I'm going down to every Affliction every every bondage of the enemy everything that the enemy has after I've been in the presence of God I'm like the mouse that fell in the in the vat at the winery and he'd come up he said where's that cat why he's been in the presence of God what could God do for you if you spent five minutes being drunk in his spirit being inebriated in his presence spending the time in his presence I'll tell you what we shouldn't wait for the meeting we should before the meeting happens so we can help somebody else spend five minutes in his presence it'll change you make you different a far cry from the man who ran away from his responsibilities now he's going back to Egypt take over about your heads with me musicians go ahead and come what do you think God is wants you to do maybe there's something that not do anything you think he wants me to do this I know I know this is my future I know for all of us there's a rapture we're going to take a rapture one of these days that may sound that may sound far out right now but we're going to take a Rapture how are we going to do that those five minutes in the presence of God field the rapture inside of you sealed you away to the day of your Redemption if you've never spent that five minutes in his presence we got five minutes [Music] and his presence is here why not on on a Wednesday night why can't you just take five minutes spin it in the presence of God foreign could you just by faith reach out just outside of the Flesh and us I know that things may not be what they I think they should be but right now I'm gonna take five minutes I'm gonna take five minutes here in the church five minutes if you're watching tonight and you're not able to be here five minutes that's all he needs it's been five minutes in his presence talk to him fight you away you gotta fight your way through all your unbelief and your frustrations and all those things let him let that all Melt Away get close to the fire Lord I believe you help thou my unbelief let me spend five minutes not in the presence of a worship band not in the presence of a great preacher not in the presence even of a prophet but let me spend five minutes in your presence oh God let me spend five minutes where your word is being preached and where the people believe that

over my life let me spend that five minutes tonight and I believe I can be changed oh god oh Lord how we love you today Lord I want to spend these next five minutes in your presence Lord I don't want
