the house of God Amen and we just love the Lord with all our heart I've uh asked brother Josh Kathy I knew he was coming back in to visit family and we asked brother Josh to come and preach for us tonight we ordained brother Josh here in this church some time back and uh you know it's my privilege to do that brother Josh has uh two small children and a wife back in Tucson Arizona uh he said he has one wife and two children in case you're wondering so um but we're so it's we got a wonderful family it's brother George Moore's son-in-law we already like brother Josh better than we do brother George and brother Josh hasn't even preached here yet but but I'm just saying that for his sake but uh but anyway brother Josh is a a dedicated young man to the Lord and and you know it's always been my privilege to help young men and I'm a young man but I I realized I had a moment of recognition the other day that now I'm offering bring advice to Young preachers and that that's a little bit odd for me but I always wanted to help young men get started in the ministry because I stood on the shoulders of giants and I was uh helped by many uh Godly pastors and men and so I want to do everything I can to help young men starting out and to win a soul for the kingdom of God here's what brother brandham said about it he said young preacher get into the field stay into the harness said all you young preachers and things don't you say around don't you just sit and do nothing get out yonder and win a soul do something get on get moving he said don't stop young preacher over there God bless your heart when he said that he said that to me said that to brother Josh all the other young preachers out there we got some of brother Josh's family here tonight God bless you for coming and thank you for doing that let's sing that uh little song in moments like these in moments like these as we just turn the our attention to the word tonight if you've got a need in your life God's able to speak to that need do you believe that and all Ministry is getting yourself out of the way and I believe I've heard such wonderful things about brother Josh's Ministry I believe that he'll just be able to get himself out of the way tonight and we'll just pull on the word so so hard that we'll just get everything that we came for tonight you believe that amen God bless you now let's let's sing with all our hearts oh in moment like the maybe you've had a hard day but just shut all that out today tonight and as we enter into the word now oh I sing out love song to Jesus Oh in moments like me oh oh I lift up my hands I lift up my hands to you Lord sing it now sing in I oh I love you Lord singing High [Music] amen God bless you tonight it's good to be here with you thank you brother Ben for opening your pull pit to me um I was going to introduce myself but I feel like I'm related to about half the people in here so I didn't know if I need to do that but once again I'm brother Joshua Kathy from Shalom Tabernacle and tcon Arizona my pastor is brother Israel Po and he sends his greetings to you all and um I told the church I I preached this last Sunday in Tennessee and told the church how I'm missing home I have a beautiful wife at home two little chunky babies running around but I also told them that every time you come into the house of the Lord it feels a little bit like home don't it it feels like you're just right at place if we could turn in the scriptures thank you musicians if we could turn in the scriptures to Isaiah 648 first and then 2 Thessalonians chapter 1 verses 1- five second Isaiah 648 says but now oh Lord Thou Art Our Father we are the clay and thou our Potter and we all are the work of thy hand in the second scripture 2 Thessalonians 1 veres 1-5 it reads Paul and sylvanus and timotheus unto the Church of the Thessalonians and God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ Grace unto you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ we are bound to thank God always for you Brethren as it is meat because that your faith groweth exceedingly and the charity of every one of you all towards each other aboundeth so that we ourselves Glory in you in the Churches of God listen to this right here for your patience and faith and all your persecutions and tribulations that you endure and he says which is a manifest token of the righteous Judgment of God that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God for which ye also suffer amen let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we just thank you for this opportunity to come into the house of the Lord Lord we know that your prophets said that anytime we have this opportunity it is a Christian's privilege and honor to enter into here father we ask that you would bless this service and that you would watch over me watch over the congregation and just be with us both father in Jesus Christ's name amen you may be seated so uh when I saw this scripture what caught my eye was what it was saying what these persecutions and tribulations that we endure are it says they are a manifest token and then another translation of manifest token stood for evidence it said that their persecutions and tribulations that they were enduring was evidence of the righteous Judgment of God and then as I read Isaiah 648 I wondered out of everything that the Lord could have used in the scripture as an example why would he choose a Potter and Clay as an example two such simple things but I started looking closer and it's more about the process of the Potter and the the clay and I seen an interesting quote it wasn't brother Brandon but it struck me and it said most people don't want to be part of the process they just want to be part of the outcome it said but the process is where you figure out who's worth being part of the outcome yes sir amen and it was so I realized it was more about the process going from a useless piece of clay to a beautiful bowl or a cup something with purpose in the Lord yeah and so the Potter he can he can form his clay in many different ways you know the pieces that he forms they're all different they have different purposes they have different reasons for being formed they're not all the same and he can use his hand he can use a a potter's wheel if he needs one and he always has a Master model to go off of just as we do we have Jesus Christ we have a Master model ourselves that the scripture gives us to build off of Amen so the very there steps in making these clay pieces a very first step is you want to Center that clay if you're using a potter's wheel you have to have that clay centered on that potter's wheel if it's not centered it's not going to turn out right it's going to fall one way it's going to fall the other way or possibly fall off the wheel itself and us as Christians we have to be centered on the word of God just the same manner the same application to it so when centering the clay the Potter he can push and he can pull on the clay and he's not doing these things he can get rough with it sometimes but he's not doing it to harm the clay in any way he's only doing it to help the clay become what it needs to be that's his only purpose in doing it the next step is a dry out so after they Center the Clay and they're shaping it what it needs to be the Potter then must let the clay dry out or you could call it the die out phase yeah which is simply letting it sit and letting all the unneeded moisture get out of that clay before you put it in an oven because that moisture in the clay if if it stays in there if these things that aren't needed in the clay if they stay in the clay too long and you put it in the oven that water it'll turn to vapor and it'll explode there'll be a reaction to it there's a reaction that each of these things that this clay must go through if they try and put it in the fire a little too earli or with something unneeded in it it could be bad it could turn out worse than it was before that's right that's good brother brandham said in letting off the pressure he was talking about that weatherbe Magnum that was board wrong and we all know it blew up in his face cuz it was bored incorrectly and he said and so will every man find the same thing that profess to be a Christian that doesn't get the right start from the New Birth he'll blow up somewhere right it says there's too much pressure on it if you're not ready for it if you're not there there's too much pressure for it cuz the the attacks that come with being a Christian those are different attacks all right on those are deep spiritual cutting attacks that come with being a Christian yeah that's right and he said if you if you don't got the right start at that new birth it can be dangerous he said there's too much pressure on it it won't stand it he'll find himself blowed up somewhere yeah that's right so according to experts they say it's best to just let this clay dry out naturally not to manufacture anything not to try and rush it along to let it dry out how it's supposed to dry out let it get these things out like us let let them come out how the Lord intended them to come out these things through tests and trials that's how it's going to happen just like this clay this Clay is going through a test every stage is a different test for a different purpose in that Clay's existence right so let's say for a second this clay let's say it's got a mind of its own it's partially dried out but it's still holding on to a few little things that it doesn't need to be holding on to I saw saw a story that fit with this perfectly it was about a it was a method these African Hunters would use to hunt monkeys in the jungle and what they would do is they would uh they would have a big gourd type of fruit and it would be hollowed out and they would bore a hole in it just big enough for the monkey's hand to go into that hole and so they would put it up in a tree and then they would put peanuts in it so then the monkey he'd be swinging along and he'd smell the peanuts and he would go for it and when he went for it he could just get his hand in there but by the time that he grabbed the peanuts he couldn't get his hand out anymore so he was stuck there and so the hunters would come and they said that these monkeys were so bound and determined to get those peanuts out that they would not let go of the thing that was holding them captive oh my they they wouldn't let go that they could be free at any point that they wanted to be free but they would not let go of what was holding them captive amen do we see that sometimes yeah I know that's been me before there's been things that I've had trouble letting go of that were holding me captive keeping me under bondage I was in prison because of these things come on but all you have to do is let it go and the monkey it says if he would only release his prize yeah when it was talk when the when the man was talking he said if that monkey would only release his prize then he could slip his hand back out and he could be free that's all he had to do and what the monkey thought to be his prize was actually his demise you know those peanuts they look good they smelled good they tasted good but that doesn't mean it was good for the monkey that doesn't mean he actually needed them come on so the next step in the clay is firing the clay it's the oven time so this is this is what happens after the drying out process and then this is what really molds the clay together this is what really fuses all the clay together and that's the part I'd really like to focus on because as our Journeys as Christians we're going to be in the fire quite a bit we're going to spend a whole lot of time in the fire in the oven that's going to be where most of our time is spent so once in the fire all these different chemical compounds and minerals they're burned out of the clay and the clay has become something new altogether it's ceramic at this point right it's become its own creation it's become what its creator meant for it to become now at that point it can be cracked and it can be broken again but it can never go back to being that useless lump of clay that it was before it can never go back to that it has been changed from that point on it is something new but it doesn't in there there's still more tests to come at that point one of the first tests that they use on new ceramic is called a stain test all right so what they do is they take a stain and they put it on the outside of the ceramic and when they put that stain on the outside of the ceramic they let it sit for a while and then they'll come back and look at it and they'll observe the outside of it and then they'll look on the inside of it because if there was a crack that they didn't know about on the outside that stuff that they stained it with on the outside seeped into the inside of that ceramic pot if there are cracks that they didn't know about if there's these little weaknesses that it can find an inlet into that interior of that pot that's what they're looking for stuff that they didn't know was there any little weakness but thankfully there's something called the wax resist and they just heat up the wax that's all it is it's a special type of wax and what it does is it protects whatever portion of that ceramic you put it over you can wrap the whole thing in it or you can put it over the cracks of that ceramic and it's applied it it's got different colors about it and what what its main job is is to preserve the purity of the area that it is applied to and it acts as a shield all right so it can have a crack come on now but there's a wax resist but the most important thing about the wax resist when I was studying it the most important thing I noticed is it must be applied now you could take that that wax resist the tub of the wax and you could sit it here and you could put the pot here they could be in close proximity you could put it on top of it you could put it around it but just just putting it in close proximity or in its presence wasn't enough it had to be applied to it there had to be the application at some point reminded me of what would have happened if if Rahab wouldn't have hung that Scarlet thread out that window come on what would have happened she'd have died with the rest of them but she had to put it out there there had to be an application and she followed it to the tea and it it reminds me of Peter Peter Peter was so close to Jesus and he had he had walked with Jesus for such a long time he had cast out Devils he he was his friend sure you know they probably had slept close to one another they were very close but Peter had only been in the presence he had only been around Jesus but on the day of Pentecost when Peter really changed that presence went in Peter sir he was no longer just just around the presence that presence lived inside of him and there was a change that happened that day amen and talking about that wax resist you know we we have a baling Gilead that we can apply we have an application as a Christian brother brandham said in Balman Gilead he said I spoke to a woman some time ago and she was looking so frail she noticed sometime in her younger days of this advertisement on the televisions and the signboards of beautiful women smoking cigarettes and the company says that it will make you thin that's when they sold their product to the public if it makes you thin is because you're dying it's TB and cancer that's making you thin she said I just have to smoke oh my she said I'm a slave to it well you don't have to be a slave to it there is a bomb in Gilead there is a bomb in Christ he said there's a cure for it sir you don't have to do it he said you don't have to drink you don't have to smoke you don't have to gamble the reason you do it is because you refus the remedy yeah come on the Lord Jesus has made remedy he made a remedy on that cross right there amen he said you'll die on the church steps until you take the remedy that cures that's what satisfies that's what takes sin away they say I just can't help it you can help it you can help it it said what if the man laying on the doctor's step said oh I know he's got the medicine in there to cure this disease but I just can't go in and brother Bram says why can't you go in it's because sometimes we start buying into these little Whispers of lies in our ears we start taking them as truth we we take Satan's Bluff as a truth instead of God's promise sometimes I do as well many times there may be something you're struggling with and it's so easy to buy into a lie of the devil he makes it so believable that there can be there can be a whole lot of Truth in that lie right all right but that little bit just like he did with Eve that little bit that's off determines all of it yeah so if the wax is never applied to the pot then what good was all that testing for so say say you've been through a long Battle of sickness a doctor he can sit you an appointment he can give you his diagnosis he can prescribe medicine to you but it has to be your will to take that medicine the doctor is not going to show up and just put it in your mouth for you now he's been there he's told you what's going on you both know what's going on but it has to be your will to take that medicine we have to apply that blood in our lives oh come on if there's a situation if there's a trial if there's a test apply that blood oh yes and then believe we have to apply that blood the balm is in Christ the prophet said Christ is the medicine he's the Cure is that right has he been the Cure in your life before well he can be the Cure again he can do it over and over Hebrews 138 he's the same yesterday today and forever if he if if a miracle happened in your life at 10 years old it can happen at 40 years old 50 years old it can happen at any point it doesn't matter what time he's the same God all the time every day Monday through Friday even on the weekends he's the same God so we can see this testing it's not to hurt the product or to make the product look bad in any way yeah it's to prove the work of the Potter is what it's to do that's right but who we proven it to critics the devil's the biggest critic isn't he he's always pointing you out tell telling you what's wrong right here and you know there's art critics so say this ceramic pot you put it in an art show and there's going to be a Critic come around and he's say well that's not quite right and he's going to measure it and do different things to it and he's going to think these different cracks that we talked about earlier are just they're mistakes but they're not mistakes cuz once that wax resist is applied to it that crack only becomes part of that pot's character oh yeah right these these marks that we have these scars that we have from the devil they they come a part of your character they make you who you are is that right and he can't touch you unless God says he can touch you first he's got to go get permission he's got to he's got to walk up there slowly with his headbound say well can I do this he's got to get some permission first for he lays a finger on one of us thank you Lord Brother brandham said in we have seen a star and have come to worship him he said and sometimes we think that our burdens I might inject this right here that we think our burdens are so heavy sometimes that there's nothing like it in the world he said now think about this he said do you know all those things are good for you oh yeah he said they are all to mold you and make you now think about that think about a trial think about a trouble in your life you've been through and that was good for you now it didn't it didn't seem like it at the time you didn't think it was good for you but God had a plan for you and God had a purpose for you he had a purpose in doing exactly what he did in your life and we may not understand it's when you're in it it's hard to understand it's like imagine you on a train and you going into a tunnel that was maybe had a turn in it and now you're going along and you can't see the light at at the end of that tunnel until you break around that corner and but you didn't understand why you couldn't see the light the first bit of that tunnel just is sometimes we don't understand why things happen but they happen for a purpose right Romans 8:28 tells us that is that right he said he said prophets and sages was molded on the backside of the desert in the hot blazing sun through tribulations and trials and persecutions and these and listen to this right here he said and these things that we have today there's nothing happened to us that hasn't happened to other Christians before you say well but today we have cell phones we have the internet we have these other we have these issues that these these Believers of the past they didn't have to deal with this but Satan you got to watch him he's got a new device but the Same Spirit working in that device that's right the same filthy Spirit working in it you know maybe he just got he's so subtle over time time he just has a new device every day whatever's going to catch the people's attention he's going to have a hold of Hollywood he's going to have a hold of it and then he's going to seep that spirit in there and then he he's trying to slowly give you that Spirit as well amen but just as we have our products and we want to try them and make sure they're tested the Lord wants to do the exact same thing with us oh yeah we are his products we're his hands and his feet here we are the ones that do his working here am man just as if you if you bought a if you bought a a Chevy or a Ford truck you would hope that they had tested it at 70 or 80 miles an hour so when you was on the highway the tires didn't fall off you would hope that they had done some testing or or maybe you pull a trailer with it maybe that's your purpose for that truck maybe you pull a trailer maybe you have Livestock in it or something but it needs to be proved for a purpose and that's what the Lord does he proves his people for a purpose he proves them then puts them in their place their exact place of where they need to be lady member a preacher teacher evangelists whatever they may be whoever you are each one has a purpose in the Lord than Amen brother brandham said and how can I overcome he said now we're expected to be tested that's a good lesson for my brother back there also he that cometh to God must first be tested tested what with the word that's God's test do you believe it he that cometh to God must be tested that only shows a true child then see be tested and when the test comes all he says right here you can't overcome L there's a test give to you come on and when test is given it's to see whether you can overcome or not oh yes he said and Jesus said to him that overcometh the test right brother Brandon went on to say the test is the greatest thing that ever happened to you he said the test is the greatest thing that ever happened to you now it don't always feel like it's the greatest thing but we're not basing all this off feelings either oh come on he he didn't brother Bram said in one place he said he didn't say did you feel it he said did you believe it amen so the and feeling is what has got so many the you can have a feeling but that feeling's got to line up right here it's got to line up right in this Bible it's got to line up with those tapes it's got to line up with the word of God if you have a feeling and that's how you got to test it that's what he's saying here that is God's test come on Amen and brother brandom say it's a good evidence that God is with us now I I could see how that if that pot could think the ceramic pot might question why it's getting put through these different strength tests or a stain test or these things that could possibly harm it it would be questioned why is this happening to me why is this happening in my life but in the end it's only to make it stronger going forward and to see where that it may be lacking see where the weaknesses might be so they can get past you know I've heard before people say that you know if somebody doesn't realize there is a problem that's what they say about addiction they have to realize there is a problem first before they can move past that problem it has to be it has to be apparent to them hey this is an issue right here before they're going to put any time of their life getting past that issue amen and it's not it's not cuz the Potter's mad at what he created he just wants what best for it is that right the Lord just wants what's best for us sir and he knows what's best for us he said in the in the message I know we ask for comfort and peace God gives us the best he could give us trials and tribulations yeah he said that's better than comfort and peace that's right our Comforts is just beyond the river amen it was until the Hebrew children was forced into the fiery furnace on one of their most outstanding trials that they seen one like the Son of God standing among them said their troubles produced the son of God standing among them their troubles produced the son of God standing among them in the breezes to wave away the heat wave it said but not until they went into the fire did the comforter appear not until they went into the fire did their comforter appear did he come to help amen he said their troubles produced the son of God standing among them you know those troubles squeezed them squeezed them tight you know back in that they didn't have nobody on their side they didn't have a church full of people saying We believe that too it was them they believed it come on but it squeezed them and what came out of that squeeze was Faith yes sir all that it lifted was their faith they can see this pers persecution is coming because of what I believe amen now Thea walked into that furnace and been saying oh it's over now God's forsaken us he's not with us things might have turned out different they might have went a different direction but that was not their attitude they said God is able to deliver us amen they say God is able to deliver us and that Faith produced the son of God oh thank you Lord and how do you know that they didn't even have a promise like ours they didn't have the promise to put their faith in and and they didn't have anybody backing them up the prophet said he did the same thing he was going to glorify himself in the Hebrew children he made a preparation when did he make it the Hebrew children didn't have any promise they couldn't get back here and read in the Bible and say Lord you promised in your word that any of your children ever went into a fiery furnace you would deliver them they didn't have no perfect written out nice word of God like we have but they believed that their God was able yeah oh yes is that right they believed that their God was able said you would deliver them all right Lord we're coming right there upon that and then brother Brandon right here he he stops quoting the scripture he says well that wouldn't have been so hard to do just their faith because God has already promised that's he's talking to us that's us right there he said that wouldn't be so hard to do come on just by their faith he we have God's promise why wouldn't we believe it why wouldn't we believe that God can Deliver Us from things that trials and tribul in our life that he can heal our bodies that he can heal our minds that he can come down and touch us why wouldn't we believe that cuz it's right here in his word said but here's the words they had God was so real to them they said our God is able how about that the fellow that don't believe in Divine Healing God is able to deliver us come these fiery furnace but will not bow down to your images and when they walked into the fiery furnace upon bare sheer faith that God was able not promised but he was able God sent Christ in the fiery furnace and fann the fire away from them and protected them and brought them out sure but I'm saying God is able and he says right here now you don't come saying God is able he said you don't have to come that you can say God you promised oh yeah God you promised amen he said you prepared it at Calvary and I've come to receive it he said it's your preparation you provided it and you promised it and I see others receiving it so I come too Lord to get my part of it I want my portion I want my part of that healing when you took that cross up on Calvary I want my part of that cuz I was in your mind I've been in your mind before the foundation of the world and I want my part Lord that's right he said you'll go away a different person you'll go away with such an anchor inside your soul that nothing can upset you he said you know that that you're healed you know that God has taking care of this matter for you because he promised he says he gives testings and trials with these promises he gives testings and trials with these promises amen how much more faith should we have with all that's been given to us with all that's been promised wonderful our Fai should be through the roof my face should be through the roof but these tests and these trials they make it hard sometimes we doubt sometimes a little he starts Whispering again yeah they make them tough thinking on a manifest token as in the scripture who's heard who knows what a touchstone is brother brand I think he's mentioned it twice in the taste but a touchstone it's a it's a stone they use to test whether gold is really gold or not yeah that's right and it's a little black stone you have and and you'll have a mark of real gold on there then what they do is they take sorry they take the they take another gold piece and they scratch it in there underneath that and they see if the two match up yeah now brother Brenham said that the man that's got good gold doesn't mind going to the Touchstone he don't mind it and you know what causes it I I was thinking about it what causes really in the end what determines whether that is real gold or not is how it reacts to the friction that's applied so if you have that gold ring and you start rubbing it on there and that friction if it doesn't if it don't handle that friction well it's not going to show up as real gold but it's how it handles the friction when it's put against that Touchstone that shows whether it is real gold or not that's good and he said the man that man with the good gold he's not scared of that test he's not scared for he he welcomes him he says come what may yeah I can't control it anyway so come what may and I will face this test and another way that they used to to do for gold it said in the old days brother Brenham said conferences the old days the only way they had to separate it was a beater he said beat the gold with a hammer like the Indians beat it and the only way that the beater knew that he had the gold ready was as when he beat all the drw out of it and he would beat it and turn it over and beat it and beat it until all the dross went out when he seen his own self reflect back into the gold he knew then that all the dirt and the iron and the foreign matters was out of the gold when he seen himself reflect when Christ sees his reflect in us we need to be reflectors of Christ in this day amen no matter what the test no matter what the trial the heartache the hard time we need to reflect Christ in this day amen show others what Christ looks like we're the only Bible some people may see we're the only Christ some people may see amen they may see no other good in a day but you you may be the only bit of good that they get to see in a day good sir oh my very true it said and that's the way God is trying to do his church is to beat it till all the Creeds and the nonsense and all the world is beat out of it till it reflects back the life of Jesus Christ amen and if you notice that's one of the enemy one of his favorite things to do is tell a Christian that you aren't actually what you believe you are all right in the middle of a test he's going to try and convince you that you're not what you believe you are or what the scripture claims that you are amen amen he wants you to start doubting your position as a believer in these tests and I there was a I was studying the other day and there was a A syndrome that popped up it's called impostor syndrome and it's a it's a behavioral health thing going around right now I guess and they say it only occurs it's a lot of self-doubt and you start thinking no matter what you are what you've done it makes you just think that you're nothing it makes you think you're low that you're low down that you're nothing that you've never achieved anything and it said that it mostly occurs in high achieving individuals and I thought well what's a higher achieving individual than a a born again believer today how much higher do you get you know there's people that make a lot of money there's people that do this in the world do that in the world they're really smart and all that but a born again believer is the highest achieving individual there is in the land today amen and these individuals it said they can't internalize who they are they can't believe within themsel who they are amen and it says that they're that it said that's the biggest reason from somebody achieving their full potential is not realizing who they are and that's what the enemy wants he wants you to believe that you are a fraud he wants you to believe that you're an imposter he wants you to believe because of things you've done because of how you've reacted to certain situations cuz you can say if somebody say somebody's testing your patients out there maybe you're driving and somebody cuts in front of you and you know you say something you shouldn't say or something happens like that immediately after that happens the enemy is going to start telling you oh see a Christian wouldn't have done that a real believer you're an impostor you're a fraud you're not who the scripture says you are and that's what he wants that's the same way he's always done it and I I read a story it's about it was about a tiger that these people had trapped and they had trapped at Young and they had they had beat on this tiger and they had abused it and they had heard it from a young age they had started Young And as it came up because of all that beaten they they had beaten it into submission and this tiger it believed that it was like a house cat it didn't know it was a tiger it didn't know it was a a big creature meant to be free in Rome and they had they showed a picture of people walking it on a a leash you'd put a Chihuahua on and that tiger they had beaten it in submission so much that tiger didn't realize that it was a tiger anymore now at any moment it could have broke off that leash and it could have mauled whoever that man was that beat it but it did didn't know that it was a tiger it had been tricked in the thinking that it was nothing that it was weak that it was helpless and that's what he does to us he wants to tell you you're weak you're helpless you have nothing you can't do anything he'll put you on a real short leash and they'll try and lead you around sometimes but we need to break off those leashes we don't belong on a leash we're free we are eagles we fly high we're God's people amen and there was I read another story about a circus elephant and they did the same thing they had since it was a baby and they had gotten it they tied it up with a you know like a almost like a bungee cord a tiny little rope oh my but they had done it since it was a tiny you know a baby elephant and they it grew up and they never used a differ Siz rope they used the same size rope that elephant the only reason that it was still bound is because it thought it was still bound it thought that that rope could still hold in mind it didn't know that it was a big strong elephant capable of Breaking Free at any point and going free amen but you know every little lie that he tells you about yourself is actually a truth about him yeah come on come on think about that everything that he points at you and says you're this he actually is that John 844 says when he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own yeah oh yeah all right is that right and that's usually a pretty good indicator of jealousy he wants to be you he wishes he could be you but he can't sir he can anymore he's jealous right he just want he wants to be a believer so bad and he he he would I bet he'd give anything to be able to enjoy that Kingdom at the end but he's not going to he's going to be cast out is that right you ever heard one of the sports critics that they you know they probably never an analyst that never played a day in their life never played the sport and like a let's say a college football or NFL guy and he's the quarterback might miss a receiver over the middle it's a 30 yard pass and he overthrows him or something and that guy's saying wow how could he not hit him and this guy the guy talking can't even throw it 10 yards but he's saying how could he not hit that guy that's jealousy he wishes he was that quarterback out there playing he wishes he could actually hit that guy and that's just how Satan is he wants to stand on the outside and he wants to criticize and tell you what you are and what you aren't but let's look at a few of things let's look at hit the ones that he usually tells you you aren't he'll say you can't be healed he'll say this sickness in your body it's over you're just going to you're going to hold on to it you're never going to get past it but Jesus's Stripes say different the scripture says different now he says this but the scripture says different he says you've gone too far you've sended away your day of Grace there's no more Mercy left for you to too far but then the grace of God says different yeah is that right yeah is that what the scripture tells us he says you're weak-minded he says this problem with anxiety this problem with depression you'll never get past it Oh my he says you can't do it yeah says that that your God can't do it you can't do it but the mind of Christ says different oh yeah there's a he tries to pervert these things he tries to tell you you can't but we can through Christ amen but all these lies he's telling you they are truths about himself he has send away his day of Grace yeah he can't be healed oh come on he is just jealous that he cannot have what you have amen so the next time he's Whispering those things just think this these are the cries of a a jealous insecure yeah nobody right what he says he holds no what he says holds no power over you oh my not a bit of it it doesn't nothing right but that's the way anything worth anything has ever been made through test and pressure oh yeah says you don't you don't get a diamond without some intense heat and pressure there was a man in the early 1900s his name was Peter Marshall he was a I think he was a presbyterian Minister he said may we think of Freedom not as the right to do as we please but as has the opportunity to do what is right he said when we long for life without difficulties remember us that the Oaks grow strong in contrary winds and diamonds are made Under Pressure those Oaks they strive they thrive in rough winds you know that's when they're at their strong you want to make an oak you know what makes an oak so tough their Roots their root system people would say that's a big strong tree they would think it was bark or maybe the density of the wood but it is the root system of the oak that makes it so tough and on the outside it may be beaten up and battered but it's something from underneath the surface that makes it so tough oh yeah just with us it's something from deep down it's the spirit of God in us it's the presence in us that makes us tough we're weak in the flesh but God's spirit is tough than God's spirit runs deep within each and every one of us for our healing for our trials for our tribulations amen also Lord and Oak's root system when planted around each other in Oak it will reach out and search for other Oaks oh my so Oaks are strongest when they're planted amongst each other because they will reach out and bind their root systems together oh yeah amen and that's just how we are in the house of God we come here we gather together not just to hear a sermon not just to hear whatever anybody's got to sing but it's to bind ourselves together in faith through Christ thank you Lord and be strong together that that is exactly why Fellowship matters you have to have Fellowship each one of we're all different people yeah you know this brother may he may know how to handle this brother or sister this sister may know how to handle this brother maybe nobody else could could do it but you that is why Fellowship matters right it matters to come into the house of God Amen and an oak it's strongest when it's planted amongst other Oaks and that is the exact same for us going to church just as Fellowship matters I'll say going to church matters that seems to be a Mark today people not want to go to church but going to church matters to get around other believers people of like Precious Faith amen amen thank you Lord you know without some of the Oaks that were in my life I wouldn't be here today I can say that 100% truly I know without some of the oak trees that I leaned on that I bound my roots to I wouldn't be standing here today and now I may I may still be a small Oak but I still look up to them big Oaks and I'm still bound to those big Oaks and that is why the fellowship is so important important in closing I'd like to mention maybe one more example of testing so what about steel you think about steel now the the first stages of making steel it's not ready to support the building that it's going to go to yeah that's right it's not ready in the early stages you have to go through metal casting you know that's where molten metal it's poured into a mold and it solidifies it and it makes it into whatever piece that it needs to be to go into a building so that building can serve its purpose amen now it takes some it also and still it takes some tough tests to qualify excuse me take some tough tests to qualify to be in the structure of a building if we could turn real quick to Hebrews 12 verses 5- 11 Hebrews 12: 5-11 says and ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children my son despise not thou the chastening of the Lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of him for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth if ye endure chastening God deal with you as his sons for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not he says but if ye be without chastisement whereof all are partakers then are ye bastards and not Sons it says furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us and we gave them reverence shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the father of spirits and live oh yes said for they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure but he for our profit that we might be partakers of of his Holiness verse 11 right here now no chasing for the present seeth to be joyous but Grievious nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the Peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby that's saying for the for the moment it's not joyous to be tried to be chasen to be corrected to be rebuked when you're in the wrong but afterward what it yields is worth so much more and brother Bram in the leian church age he read that exact scripture and right after he quoted this he said herein Is Now set forth the love of God he said herein yeah herein our chastening here in our test here in our trials is now set forth the love of God yeah he desired in love a family of his own a family of Sons Sons like himself there before him lies all mankind as one lump of clay out of the same lump he will now make vessels unto honor and unto dishonor yes he said the choosing will be his own choosing then those chosen ones born of his spirit will be trained yeah to conform to His Image in their walk and that's I guess that's what I would like to start calling instead of calling something in my life a trial or a tribulation or a hard time I'll just call it training that's all it is it's all just a lot of training to get ready he says he repes with all longsuffering and gentleness and mercy he chastens with nail scarred hands says sometimes this Potter must take the vessel he is working on and thoroughly break it down in order that he may rebuild it exactly as he desires it said and right here this is the key right here I love this said but it is love that is his love another way of his love there is not there cannot be another way of his love and I thought about that his love and the chastening and the training you know if I my two babies if they were here with me and one ran out in the road right and one got in the road now I know if they get hit by a car out there it will kill them it'll lead to death that's right and you better believe once I got to them and if they were safe there would be some chastisement that went on yeah something would happen there there would be some rebuking some chastisement there would be some training there would be a whole lot of stuff that went on once I got them back but that's important and I wouldn't be doing it because I didn't like them right I wouldn't be doing it because I didn't have any care for them I would be doing it because I love them I would correct them because I love them because I know that could kill them oh my so very similar to to The Clay Pot steel goes through a process to burn out all impurities that are present in the steel and then this is this is probably one of my favorite steps that happen with the steel it says for Reliable longevity and a bare extreme weight structural steel must be of the right composition it says iron and carbon are two of the most vital components used by steel mills when making structural steel so you have iron and you have carbon it says the carbon lends strength to the iron ore it says which is a source for the iron and the steel and it's quite soft on its own said that the iron that's in steel on its own is quite soft but when you fuse it when you put carbon into that iron it makes steel amen when you put God's spirit in man it makes steel it makes Believers that can withstand it makes Believers that have purpose it makes Believers that can continue on Amen that's good as musicians come I just have one more quote I'd like to read to you it's a long one but it's a good one the prophet says standing some time ago I was standing at Gary Indiana where they taken me through the big Gary steel mills and I was very much alarmed when I was watching the superintendent taking me up and he was showing me all around the place and he said I was watching them in a little whistle tooted 5 minutes before quinting time I notic every man taking his apron off and laying it up on his machine and right out through around his Lads and things he was sweeping out in the aisle a bunch of shavings that had been collected from the material he was working on and he swept them all out in the aisle and he said I'll show you something here rever brandom I said all right then he walked back to a little place and the main whistle blowed all the men went out everybody was clear from the building we were left standing alone and he pressed a button and way back in the back I heard a something Thunder and Roar and bur coming down and I thought what is that after a while he said now you stand aside so I stood aside he said I seen a track coming down through there and when it did here come a great magnet coming down through there and as the magnet passed down through the line I begin to notice those shavings flying up to meet it like that the metal shavings and those each one of those metal shavings despite the size they were still Ste they were still attracted to that magnet said I noticed some of them didn't come up and I noticed several pieces of iron didn't come up and the magnet went on back over in the into the Capa and dropped all this stuff down into the Capa and it was melted and made over again and I said well why didn't it all rise up I said I see some shavings he said Reverend brandham we make some aluminum parts here he said all those aluminum pieces are not magnetized to that magnet I said praise the Lord and I said he said what's the matter with you I said I was just thinking so I said why didn't them other iron pieces go up said if you noted they are bolted down they can't raise up I said praise God hallelujah he said what's the matter Reverend brandham said I was just a thinking he said you must have been I said brother way back Yonder somewhere in the eternities Hallelujah there is a great magnet the Son of God is going to be turned loose one of these mornings he is sweeping down over the Earth like a magnet and every soul that's magnetized to him will go up to meet him in the air and there be in the resurrection to live with him be taken out Y and these old bodies that we now live in or even like we have now that's getting old and crinkling up and dropping down will be dropped Over Yonder into the Capa of dust and molded over and made like unto his own glorious body in the final Resurrection when he comes again and I said well now look at here there's many people that's not magnetized said there's many people that's bolted down with circumstances say I can't do it I just couldn't do it it's too much of a price brother except that heart is changed and that Soul sitting under magnetized with God by the Holy Ghost when Jesus comes you'll be left on the earth alone remember there will be a resurrection one of these mornings only for those that are dead in Christ will God bring with him amen amen I want to be one of those pieces of Steel that have a purpose I want to be a strong Oak I want to be that true gold tried and true tested the test may come but I know that Christ is on my side no matter what I know who I am I know who the scripture says that I am I just have to put Faith in that that right there amen I'm thankful today to be a product of the Creator I'm thankful for the test that have molded me and made me I'm thankful for those times and I'm thankful that he's placed an eternal warranty on me on his product so that if I do get broken if something does happen if I do fall down I know that they'll I can go back to the manufacturer and he'll fix it for me amen let's just praise the Lord I be a [Music] Liv
