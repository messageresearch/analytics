[42:13] be out of the house and be together
[42:15] believers i heard the prophet of god say
[42:16] today he said there's nothing like
[42:17] believers getting together
[42:19] in the fellowship of his word and i
[42:20] believe that's what we've come here
[42:21] tonight to do is to fellowship around
[42:23] the word of god
[42:24] and we know that when the word is
[42:26] preached demons are cast out lives are
[42:28] changed and
[42:28] we're believing that tonight aren't you
[42:30] if you have your bibles while you're
[42:32] standing with us tonight we want to turn
[42:33] to the book of genesis the first chapter
[42:36] and we sure i want to say it's good to
[42:38] be back here with you all here at hardy
[42:39] again and
[42:40] my the building sure has changed since
[42:42] we was here last time but it's looking
[42:44] looking real nice and good to see what
[42:45] the lord is doing here for you and
[42:47] appreciate brother ben his friendship

[42:50] weekend and i sure appreciate brother

[42:56] drive out here so we sure appreciate
[42:57] that appreciate him being here with us
[42:59] this weekend
[43:00] and we're just looking for the lord to
[43:01] speak to our hearts tonight aren't we
[43:04] amen we know if he comes all things are
[43:06] possible here in the book of genesis
[43:08] of the first chapter i know this is not
[43:11] an unfamiliar scripture in the 26th
[43:13] verse the bible here says and god
[43:16] said let us make man in our image
[43:20] after our likeness and let them have
[43:22] dominion over the fish of the sea
[43:25] and over the fowl of the air and over
[43:27] the cattle
[43:28] and over all the earth and over every
[43:31] creeping thing
[43:32] that creepeth upon the earth so man was
[43:35] made to have dominion
[43:37] so god created man in his own image
[43:40] in the image of god created he him male
[43:43] and female created he them or could we
[43:46] say he give them identities
[43:48] in the 20th verse and god blessed them
[43:51] and god said unto them
[43:52] be fruitful and multiply and replenish
[43:54] the earth and subdue it
[43:56] and have dominion over the fish of the
[43:57] sea over the fowl of the air and over
[44:00] every
[44:00] living thing that moveth up on the earth
[44:04] also i'd like to look at the book of
[44:05] revelations the third chapter revelation
[44:09] uh the third chapter in the 17th verse i
[44:12] know it's a passage of scripture we're
[44:14] familiar with tonight as message
[44:16] believers in revelation 3
[44:18] and verse 17. you love the lord this
[44:22] evening
[44:23] amen the bible here says in revelation 3
[44:26] verse 17 because thou sayest i am rich
[44:31] and increased with goods and have need
[44:34] of nothing
[44:35] and knowest not that thou are wretched
[44:39] and miserable
[44:40] and poor and blind and naked
[44:43] brother brown would call that and
[44:45] knoweth it not that thou art
[44:47] wretched miserable poor blind
[44:50] and naked we ask the lord this evening
[44:52] to add the blessing to the reading of
[44:54] his word
[44:54] as you may have your seats there for
[44:56] just a few moments this evening
[44:58] from those scriptures if the lord would
[45:00] help me i would like to
[45:01] speak to you here and if i title this
[45:03] tonight i want to speak to you on a
[45:05] for a few moments here on identity
[45:07] crisis
[45:08] identity crisis how many believes we're
[45:10] living in a time of crisis we're living
[45:12] in an hour
[45:13] where the world is in a crisis tonight
[45:15] they really don't know what to believe
[45:17] they don't know what to turn to
[45:18] they don't know what is truth and what
[45:20] is fiction what is gospel and what is
[45:22] man's ideas what is the word
[45:24] what is creeds and dogmas the world
[45:26] don't know tonight but thank god he sent
[45:27] us a message in this hour
[45:29] that we would know the difference
[45:30] between truth and air and the prophet of
[45:32] god would tell us this and the faith of
[45:33] abraham
[45:34] he said now to you in radio land this
[45:36] might seem very strange to you but i
[45:38] like sometimes
[45:39] he said just to kind of baby along with
[45:41] the peoples he says but it comes to time
[45:43] and it is now where they got to know
[45:45] what's the truth how many believes the
[45:47] time has come where we've got to know
[45:49] what is the truth he said see the people
[45:51] forget who they are
[45:53] he said you're just not an ordinary
[45:55] person you are a christian you are sons
[45:57] and daughters of god
[45:59] by the grace of god he said then why
[46:01] should you be in the condition you're in
[46:03] why should you be doubting and have
[46:05] frustrations amen you're not just an
[46:07] ordinary person you are a christian
[46:10] you are a son and daughter of almighty
[46:12] god and i think tonight that the devil
[46:13] does not want us
[46:15] amen to know what is truth he does not
[46:17] want us to come in contact with truth
[46:19] because jesus himself said ye shall know
[46:21] the truth
[46:22] and the truth shall make you free and i
[46:24] don't believe tonight that this is the
[46:25] hour of bondage i don't believe this is
[46:27] the hour
[46:28] amen to be tied down and to be backed up
[46:30] in a corner and not know who we are but
[46:32] i believe the hour has come
[46:33] amen that the sons and daughters of god
[46:35] have got a right this is not just a
[46:37] privilege this
[46:38] is not just just something that's been
[46:40] given to you but i believe if you are a
[46:41] son or daughter of god tonight
[46:43] amen we have been given a right to know
[46:45] what is truth in the time of crisis now
[46:48] the word crisis means a time of intense
[46:50] difficulty of trouble
[46:51] or danger a time when a difficult or
[46:54] important decision must be made
[46:56] it's a critical period it's a critical
[46:58] point it's a turning point or it's a
[47:00] crossroads and i think tonight that
[47:02] every one of us here
[47:03] amen are at a critical point we're at a
[47:05] turning point
[47:06] and we're at a crossroads tonight either
[47:08] we're going to go on and we're going to
[47:09] go
[47:10] forward and we're going to possess the
[47:11] promises of god or we're going to remain
[47:13] where we're at
[47:14] we're going to remain in the condition
[47:15] we're in and we're not going to go any
[47:17] further but i believe tonight
[47:19] amen that there are some believers here
[47:20] tonight that recognize that they're not
[47:22] just men women boys and girls
[47:24] amen they recognize they're not just
[47:26] human beings not just fathers and
[47:27] mothers but they're actually sons and
[47:29] daughters of god
[47:30] that have been bought by the blood of
[47:31] jesus christ and they have got a right
[47:33] tonight
[47:34] amen to know the truth and by knowing
[47:36] that truth amen they've got a right to
[47:38] go free by the truth they know
[47:40] amen what good would it do is to not to
[47:42] know the truth if there was not a way to
[47:44] go free what good would it do us tonight
[47:46] amen to know there was a deliverer in
[47:48] the midst of the church if there was no
[47:50] way he could deliver us
[47:51] amen but i want to remind you the devil
[47:53] is a liar amen he was a liar to begin
[47:55] with and he's a liar here tonight and
[47:57] there is still a liberty
[47:59] in the truth of jesus christ now as i
[48:01] said it's no question tonight that we
[48:03] are living
[48:03] in a time of crisis the world is in a
[48:06] crisis they meant the national
[48:08] a life is in a crisis financial is in a
[48:10] crisis political is in a crisis
[48:13] and the religious world is in a crisis
[48:15] tonight they're all in a difficult point
[48:17] amen but i think as the prophet of god
[48:19] would say that in a time of crisis is
[48:21] the time to call a conference
[48:23] in the time of crisis is a time to call
[48:25] a conference
[48:26] he said come now and let us reason
[48:28] together saith the lord
[48:30] though your sins be a scarlet they shall
[48:32] be as white as snow
[48:33] and though they be red like christmas
[48:35] crimson they shall be as wool
[48:37] if you be willing and obedient you shall
[48:39] eat the good of the lamb
[48:41] but if you refuse and rebel you shall be
[48:43] devoured with the sword
[48:45] for the mouth of the lord has spoken in
[48:47] he said that's what we're here tonight
[48:49] is in a conference
[48:50] he said this is a conference where we
[48:52] get together we've had them in national
[48:54] and here in the last world war
[48:55] he said we wonder what conferences are
[48:58] amen what are they for
[48:59] anyhow it's for them to take the most
[49:02] intelligent group
[49:03] of the group and come together and to
[49:05] work out some strategy to do something
[49:07] in a time of crisis is when they call
[49:10] conferences together
[49:11] he said be a wonderful time to have one
[49:13] in the universal church the living god
[49:14] wasn't it
[49:15] on the account of the crisis that we are
[49:17] facing he said communism and all things
[49:19] the isms this world
[49:20] he said the church is cooling off and
[49:23] it's time for us to come together and
[49:25] reason
[49:25] and get together on these things now
[49:27] think about it when the time comes
[49:29] brother david that the church begins to
[49:31] cool off
[49:32] when the church begins to draw back
[49:33] that's not the time amen to separate
[49:36] ourselves and divide ourselves
[49:37] amen but that's the time to come
[49:39] together amen and call the conference
[49:41] and i think tonight
[49:42] amen we're living in a time where the
[49:44] world is falling apart
[49:45] amen churches are closing doors are
[49:47] closing the world is falling apart but
[49:49] there is a pride here tonight
[49:51] that did not come for just another
[49:53] service we did not come just to sing
[49:55] another song
[49:56] amen but we've come here because there's
[49:58] a possibility amen that if the fire is
[50:00] gone out
[50:01] there is still a god in heaven that can
[50:03] relap the fire
[50:04] if the child is going out of the church
[50:06] there is still a possibility for the
[50:08] shout to come back
[50:09] amen can i just be at home tonight
[50:10] preach for a second i don't know what
[50:12] you think but let me tell you what the
[50:13] prophet said we need
[50:15] he said what we need is a good
[50:16] old-fashioned amen acts 2 revival and
[50:19] the bible holy ghost back in the church
[50:21] again
[50:21] listen we got a lot of problems i know
[50:23] we got a lot of circumstances i know but
[50:25] we have still got a promise
[50:27] and if we'll come together and begin to
[50:29] call on the name of the lord
[50:30] amen that the windows of heaven will
[50:32] open up and a blessing will come from
[50:34] almighty god
[50:35] i tell you what you may not even feel
[50:37] like raising your hands tonight
[50:39] amen but if there is a god here he
[50:41] didn't bring you here for just a service
[50:43] he brought you here for a conference you
[50:45] may not even feel like saying amen but
[50:46] if there's a desire in your heart
[50:48] that goes to show god didn't bring you
[50:50] here and then just to occupy
[50:52] time but he's called you here for a
[50:54] conference and if god calls a conference
[50:56] let me go ahead and tell you something
[50:58] something's about to change amen if god
[51:00] calls a conference it's a sign
[51:02] amen that something's getting ready to
[51:04] change if the president did not call the
[51:06] conference
[51:07] it's a sign something in the world is
[51:08] getting ready to change well there's a
[51:10] man here tonight who can turn on the
[51:12] light
[51:12] and then there is a god here who is
[51:14] higher than the president
[51:16] who is higher than the government and
[51:17] his name is the lord jesus christ
[51:20] and when he shows up and then
[51:21] something's fixing to change
[51:23] amen how many will claim that tonight
[51:25] something's fixing to change
[51:26] if jesus comes on the scene something's
[51:29] getting ready to change
[51:30] i don't know where you're at tonight but
[51:32] let me tell you this amen it's not too
[51:34] late
[51:34] amen to change it's not too late to turn
[51:37] around
[51:38] it's not too late to realize who you are
[51:40] and who bought you and who you belong to
[51:43] and you're not just an ordinary person
[51:45] and then you're a child of the living
[51:49] there's a god even though the world is
[51:51] in confusion
[51:52] and the churches are cooling off he said
[51:54] there's still a possibility things can
[51:57] change
[51:57] and then now the problem of god said
[51:58] when we have a conference he said what
[52:00] do we do we call together
[52:02] and then those just got the highest
[52:04] intelligence amen of everybody in the
[52:06] group
[52:07] amen we get the brains together right we
[52:09] get the smart men together right
[52:11] and the product of god said gracious
[52:12] almighty god who before there was even
[52:14] an atom in the air
[52:16] or a molecule in adam you were god
[52:19] and in this great being called god there
[52:21] was attributes there was an attribute to
[52:23] be a father
[52:24] an attribute to be god an attribute to
[52:26] be a healer an attribute to be a savior
[52:28] and there was nothing to save or nothing
[52:30] to worship you so you
[52:32] were just the great source of all
[52:34] intelligence amen see
[52:36] he was the great source of all
[52:38] intelligence
[52:39] he said and when god ever makes a
[52:41] decision it has to ever remain that way
[52:44] it cannot change he cannot get smarter
[52:47] he is the source of all intelligence
[52:50] amen no matter what our science says if
[52:52] it's against the intelligence or the
[52:54] word of god
[52:55] it's contrary and it's not right he said
[52:57] i don't care how scientific they can
[52:59] prove it amen if it's against the word
[53:01] of god
[53:02] then it's still wrong then to think
[53:03] tonight church we have not come together
[53:06] amen under a bunch of intelligence of
[53:08] man or intelligence of a bishop
[53:10] or intelligence of a preacher amen but
[53:12] the intelligence of all intelligence
[53:14] has returned in this age amen to
[53:17] conference with the church the living
[53:18] god
[53:19] now i'm about to explode here for a
[53:20] second amen do you realize who's in the
[53:22] building tonight
[53:23] it's not just a preacher it's not just a
[53:26] deacon amen but the god who stepped out
[53:28] on nothing
[53:29] and created everything amen the god that
[53:31] was before adam
[53:32] the god that was before abraham amen the
[53:35] god that was there
[53:36] when there was nothing but molecules and
[53:38] atoms but he took
[53:39] nothing and created a garden of eden
[53:41] that's the god that's in this building
[53:43] tonight
[53:43] and let me assure you if he can take
[53:46] chaos
[53:47] and transform it into a garden of eden
[53:49] that he can take a wrecked up life
[53:51] he can take a messed up church he can
[53:53] take a broken family
[53:54] and get him in the spirit of god and in
[53:57] a few moments time
[53:58] it'll go from chaos amen to a garden of
[54:01] heathen
[54:01] where the spirit of god can flow through
[54:03] there hey i don't know what the devil's
[54:05] telling you but let me tell you what the
[54:06] word says
[54:07] he's here he's here tonight
[54:11] amen the source and then the source of
[54:14] all intelligence
[54:15] listen friends amen our counselors have
[54:17] got to have counselors
[54:19] our psychologists have got to have
[54:20] psychologists our mental doctors
[54:23] have got to have mental doctors amen but
[54:25] he is the doctor of all doctors
[54:27] he is the counselor of all counselors he
[54:29] is the physician
[54:31] of all physicians and when you hear him
[54:33] speak
[54:34] his answer is perfect his diagnosis is
[54:37] accurate and his cure
[54:39] is the safety of the lord and nothing
[54:41] can be added to it
[54:42] and nothing can be taken away from it
[54:44] what is it church
[54:46] it's the source of all intelligence now
[54:48] how many knows john 1 says
[54:50] in the beginning was the word and the
[54:53] word was with god
[54:55] and the word was god amen god is the
[54:58] word
[54:58] and the word is god then the word is the
[55:01] intelligence
[55:02] and the intelligence is the word see the
[55:05] word is the intelligence
[55:07] and the intelligence is the word then to
[55:09] think here tonight
[55:10] amen he may not be here in a corporal
[55:13] body
[55:13] amen but if his word is here it's the
[55:16] same as him being here
[55:17] his word in him is the self-same faith
[55:20] that's why jesus said search the
[55:22] scriptures for in them you fake
[55:24] that you have eternal life and they are
[55:26] they which testify me
[55:28] the prophet said first thing i'd sit
[55:30] down and i'd look it up in the
[55:31] scriptures
[55:32] and see if it was in the bible amen
[55:35] first because that's where all truth
[55:37] comes from
[55:38] is from the bible amen see all truth
[55:40] actually comes from the bible
[55:42] and if it comes from the bible then it's
[55:45] coming from the source of intelligence

[1:00:20] where there was a family all broken up
[1:00:22] amen the daddy was leaving the message
[1:00:24] mom had been getting on websites and was
[1:00:26] all tore up didn't know what to believe
[1:00:27] anymore
[1:00:28] and the past they were sitting under had
[1:00:30] become a good old-fashioned psychologist
[1:00:32] who laid aside the message said we
[1:00:34] didn't need the message books
[1:00:35] we don't need the prophet's tapes in the
[1:00:37] church library all we need is dr
[1:00:39] dobson and some old psychology idea and
[1:00:42] he filled the church full of that
[1:00:43] and everything that the family was
[1:00:45] feeding on was nothing but psychology
[1:00:47] but there was one man there who was a
[1:00:49] deacon in that church
[1:00:50] that still believed that there was power
[1:00:52] in this message and he said listen he
[1:00:54] told the young lady
[1:00:55] he said listen next time and then that
[1:00:57] home erupts
[1:00:58] you call me and i'll come over there and
[1:01:00] he call him they got a call
[1:01:01] and he went over and he went in the home
[1:01:03] and he sat down and he said now what's
[1:01:05] wrong and the father was mad

[1:01:08] mad the message was wrong
[1:01:10] amen that little holy ghost-filled
[1:01:11] beacon he said well listen i didn't come
[1:01:13] here
[1:01:14] amen to represent psychology i come here
[1:01:16] to represent god
[1:01:17] and he pulled out a message book and he
[1:01:19] said this message
[1:01:20] is thus saith the lord it's the absolute
[1:01:23] to the church
[1:01:24] it's the amen to the bible it's the
[1:01:26] interpretation
[1:01:27] of what god has done in this generation
[1:01:29] and let me tell you that family
[1:01:31] is sitting together tonight because
[1:01:33] somebody
[1:01:34] ain't been called out to the god of
[1:01:36] intelligence in the hour of crisis
[1:01:38] and god came on the scene and manifested
[1:01:41] himself
[1:01:42] as more than a religion that's more than
[1:01:44] an idea but as a reality
[1:01:46] that the i am i am has come down
[1:01:50] are y'all hearing me tonight what are

[1:02:14] i feel like preaching here for a minute
[1:02:16] and then you know what

[1:02:37] the situation
[1:02:38] they told him to shut up they told him
[1:02:40] to hold his peace but he knew that that
[1:02:42] was more than a man

[1:02:45] knew that was intelligence
[1:02:47] been walking in flesh and if i'll just
[1:02:49] open up my voice
[1:02:50] and begin to call on him brother howard

[1:05:47] realities of who he is
[1:05:51] oh brother andrew what are you talking
[1:05:52] about i'm talking about a people that
[1:05:54] knows who they are
[1:05:56] they know where they come from they know
[1:05:59] where they're at
[1:06:00] they know where they're standing and
[1:06:02] they know where they're going
[1:06:03] they know who is with him see israel was
[1:06:06] a nation do you believe that
[1:06:08] but they was in captivity in egypt
[1:06:12] there was the product of god so there
[1:06:13] were hard times under the egyptians
[1:06:16] amen you know what they had to do they
[1:06:17] had to labor and serve
[1:06:20] as the people of god in captivity
[1:06:24] as the nation of god amen and everyone
[1:06:27] had grown cold down there
[1:06:29] now i ain't got time to preach here all
[1:06:31] night amen but by the circumstances
[1:06:34] and by the things they were going
[1:06:35] through they had grown cold
[1:06:37] the prophet said did you know israel was
[1:06:39] in egypt twice as long
[1:06:40] as the united states has been a nation
[1:06:43] we're not over about 150 or 70 years old
[1:06:45] something like that and they were 420
[1:06:49] years in bondage
[1:06:50] down in egypt but it cometh time
[1:06:52] somebody shouted come a time
[1:06:54] but it come a time when it seemed like
[1:06:56] all hopes was gone
[1:06:57] but there was one man amen and one woman
[1:07:01] who seemed to have faith in a historical
[1:07:04] god
[1:07:04] that spoke to abraham in the time of
[1:07:07] crisis
[1:07:08] and they believed they believed they
[1:07:11] believed
[1:07:12] they believed i'm not a broken record
[1:07:14] they believed
[1:07:15] that they could call on him and he would
[1:07:18] answer
[1:07:19] and that was amram and jochebed
[1:07:22] the mother and father of moses notice
[1:07:24] here amram and josephine
[1:07:26] were actually more than just human
[1:07:28] beings in captivity
[1:07:30] egypt they were identified believers
[1:07:32] they had an identity
[1:07:34] they were identified believers but they
[1:07:36] didn't identify themselves with payroll
[1:07:38] they didn't identify themselves amen
[1:07:40] with the conditions around them
[1:07:42] they identified themselves with the
[1:07:44] vision that god gave
[1:07:45] abraham in genesis 15 when he said your
[1:07:48] seed
[1:07:49] would sojourn in a strange land for some
[1:07:51] 400 years
[1:07:52] but afterwards i will bring them out and
[1:07:55] i'll bring them out with great substance
[1:07:57] see they identify themselves they meant
[1:07:59] brother joe they went over there
[1:08:00] and they said you know who that's
[1:08:02] speaking of that's speaking of the amram
[1:08:04] that's speaking of me joseph that is
[1:08:06] speaking of me
[1:08:07] and they were convinced
[1:08:10] can we have church here tonight they
[1:08:12] were convinced
[1:08:14] that the same god that answered abraham
[1:08:17] was the same god that would answer them
[1:08:20] they were not
[1:08:20] hoping they were not guessing they were
[1:08:23] not probing
[1:08:24] they knew if we just call on him he'll
[1:08:27] answer
[1:08:27] if we just open up her mouth and the
[1:08:30] bible says in genesis 15
[1:08:31] that it was a vision but do you realize
[1:08:33] what it was it was more than a vision
[1:08:36] it became a reality to them it become
[1:08:38] more than a scripture
[1:08:39] it become more than a vision it became a
[1:08:42] reality
[1:08:43] and i say to not church we are a part of
[1:08:46] the seed
[1:08:47] amen that's leaving with great substance
[1:08:52] ah can i preach here for a minute amen
[1:08:54] they were down there in bondage they
[1:08:55] were down there in captivity but they
[1:08:57] never took on the mentality of captivity
[1:08:59] amen they never lost their identity and
[1:09:01] so well i guess we're just going to be
[1:09:02] here always
[1:09:03] and i guess this is our end amen but
[1:09:05] they knew if we just call on god
[1:09:08] and we identify ourself with that vision
[1:09:11] it'll become more than a vision
[1:09:13] it'll become a reality and let me say
[1:09:15] this tonight church
[1:09:16] the time has come amen that this message
[1:09:19] is more than a book
[1:09:20] on the shelf it's more than something
[1:09:22] you read when you need to add something
[1:09:24] to your sermon
[1:09:25] it's come time that this message has got
[1:09:27] to become more
[1:09:28] than just a vision it's the absolute
[1:09:31] it's
[1:09:31] your whole you're looking at a preacher
[1:09:33] tonight that's got the guts to say it
[1:09:35] this message is the absolute of this
[1:09:37] generation
[1:09:38] as long as i got breath in my body i'll
[1:09:40] say this and it's more than a vision
[1:09:43] it's a reality tonight we're gonna leave
[1:09:45] here
[1:09:46] church are you hearing me church
[1:09:49] what identity are you under tonight amen
[1:09:52] the prophet of god said a man's got to
[1:09:53] be convinced first
[1:09:54] and the only convincing thing is the
[1:09:57] manifestation
[1:10:00] so reading don't convince them amen here
[1:10:02] and alone doesn't convince
[1:10:04] but they've got to see the manifestation
[1:10:07] or the identity of the gospel being
[1:10:09] identified in you
[1:10:11] when you see that you have passed from
[1:10:14] death
[1:10:14] unto life and become a new creature in
[1:10:17] christ jesus
[1:10:18] that's the identity of the holy spirit
[1:10:21] how can the holy spirit
[1:10:22] write the bible and turn around and deny
[1:10:25] what he wrote
[1:10:25] see he cannot do it that's the identity
[1:10:28] of unbelief amen see that's it any of
[1:10:31] them
[1:10:31] but the identity of belief let's say
[1:10:33] this together the identity of the holy
[1:10:35] spirit
[1:10:38] the identity of belief
[1:10:42] the identity of unbelief
[1:10:45] the identity of unbelief is to deny
[1:10:48] what has been written but the identity
[1:10:51] of belief
[1:10:52] is jesus said these signs shall identify
[1:10:55] those
[1:10:56] who believe in me see we know that's
[1:10:58] god's own word
[1:10:59] ain't been seen an identity of unbelief
[1:11:01] is to deny the word
[1:11:03] but the identity of belief is to believe
[1:11:06] the word
[1:11:06] in the age you're living in see what is
[1:11:09] identity
[1:11:10] identity means the fact of being who or

[1:12:09] liberals amen the world is confused
[1:12:12] and that same devil is trying to bring
[1:12:14] an identity crisis
[1:12:15] in the church by the living god because
[1:12:17] he knows if i can just get the sickness
[1:12:20] if i can just get the germ in the church
[1:12:23] i'll wipe it out
[1:12:24] but i join my faith tonight with brother

[1:12:31] holy ghost believers
[1:12:33] we are sons and daughters of god we
[1:12:35] believe this message
[1:12:37] we believe this prophet we believe this
[1:12:39] vision
[1:12:40] it's more than a vision it's a reality
[1:12:42] tonight
[1:12:46] i'm not confused i know who i am
[1:12:49] i know what i believe i know where i
[1:12:51] come from
[1:12:52] i know the god i'm serving i'm not here
[1:12:55] trying to figure out who i am
[1:12:59] well is it the truth or not come on
[1:13:03] it's a time brother brother harvey the
[1:13:04] time has come you can be whatever you
[1:13:06] want to be just to identify
[1:13:07] it you can have a doctor say it's a boy
[1:13:11] you can have chromosomes that's a boy
[1:13:13] you can have a birth certificate so it's
[1:13:14] a boy
[1:13:15] you can have a whole family say it's a
[1:13:16] boy and let the individual say i'm a
[1:13:18] girl
[1:13:21] well i just want to identify as a girl
[1:13:22] amen see but the problem is that's an
[1:13:24] opinion and not a fact
[1:13:27] and your identity has got to be from a
[1:13:30] fact and not an opinion
[1:13:32] well you should preach what he talked
[1:13:34] about well look at amran and joseph
[1:13:36] they knew who they were they never took
[1:13:39] on the identity of unbelief the prophet
[1:13:41] said they were real poor
[1:13:42] but they were christians they mean they
[1:13:45] worked hard
[1:13:46] they was in slavery they had to make mud
[1:13:48] bricks and things for the old king
[1:13:49] moses mother joseph ed had taken and put
[1:13:51] him in the little raft out in the river
[1:13:53] like that
[1:13:55] and those old crocodiles had eaten up
[1:13:58] all the little babies
[1:13:59] and you know she got them crocodiles
[1:14:00] away from him and she made this little
[1:14:02] arc
[1:14:03] and she put him in and then she made it
[1:14:04] out of the pitch you know what it was it
[1:14:05] was turpentine
[1:14:07] an old gator would come up and say a
[1:14:08] little fat hebrew i'll get him
[1:14:10] hear him crying like that one over there
[1:14:12] what a smell see the
[1:14:14] mother was led on how to protect the
[1:14:16] baby
[1:14:17] and then the mother was led on how to
[1:14:20] protect the baby
[1:14:21] but here's my question who was doing the
[1:14:23] leading
[1:14:26] brother ben who was leading moses mother
[1:14:29] when he went down there
[1:14:30] when she went down there and made a made
[1:14:32] a little basket to put him in who was
[1:14:34] leading her
[1:14:34] well the problem of god said amen that
[1:14:37] satan tried
[1:14:38] to destroy moses he said satan tried to
[1:14:40] destroy jesus
[1:14:41] same as he did moses he tried to tempt
[1:14:43] him do the wrong thing
[1:14:44] but he couldn't do it why he had been
[1:14:46] sprayed with the repellent of
[1:14:48] predestination
[1:14:50] are you hearing me he had been sprayed
[1:14:52] with a repel and a predestination
[1:14:55] it cannot be deceived the word said he
[1:14:57] would be here
[1:14:58] and there ain't no devil going to bother
[1:15:00] him and no
[1:15:01] other son of god
[1:15:03] [Music]
[1:15:05] thank you lord i feel the preacher
[1:15:07] coming on right now
[1:15:08] amen that ain't good enough just for
[1:15:09] moses amen that ain't good enough just
[1:15:11] for jesus
[1:15:12] but he actually puts you there he said
[1:15:14] the same devil
[1:15:15] that came to moses and tried to destroy
[1:15:18] him was the same devil
[1:15:19] that came to jesus and tried to destroy
[1:15:22] him he said but he couldn't destroy
[1:15:24] moses and he couldn't destroy jesus the
[1:15:26] son of god
[1:15:27] and you have been sprayed with the
[1:15:29] repellent
[1:15:30] a predestination and he can't destroy
[1:15:33] you
[1:15:33] either
[1:15:35] [Music]
[1:15:35] [Applause]
[1:15:37] oh that's predestinated take his place
[1:15:39] he sprayed somebody shouts prayed
[1:15:42] with the repellent he said satan's
[1:15:44] poisonous denominational doctors
[1:15:46] don't even touch him at all he moves
[1:15:48] right along nothing going to bother him
[1:15:50] it didn't have any effect upon him
[1:15:52] see so what was the repellent it was
[1:15:55] predestinated seed
[1:15:58] let's say that together god's repellent
[1:16:01] is predestinated seed
[1:16:04] come on amen them crocodiles weren't
[1:16:07] just smelling turpentine
[1:16:08] they weren't just smelling amen a hebrew
[1:16:10] baby they were smelling the smell of god
[1:16:14] they were smelling amen the smell of
[1:16:16] predestination
[1:16:17] come on church you know as well as i
[1:16:19] know a predestinated seed puts off an
[1:16:22] odor
[1:16:24] brother a predestinated seed puts off an
[1:16:27] odor
[1:16:28] amen you just get a predestinated seed
[1:16:30] around a bunch of chickens

[1:16:33] message and an old productionated seed

[1:16:37] cluck with him and they'll say what's
[1:16:38] wrong with you
[1:16:39] don't you believe what we believe he
[1:16:41] can't because there's a devil there

[1:18:45] all around me
[1:18:46] was a swarm of mosquitoes and then they
[1:18:49] were there
[1:18:50] it was that big around but the glorious
[1:18:52] thing about it was
[1:18:53] there wasn't a one of them could get to
[1:18:55] me
[1:18:57] they were buzzing around dying to bite
[1:18:59] me they were dying to get a hold of me

[1:19:17] field and they're dying to get you
[1:19:19] they're dying to get your church they're
[1:19:21] dying to get your family
[1:19:23] but the grass oh but the predestinated
[1:19:26] seed says stand back
[1:19:27] you can't touch them you can't have them
[1:19:29] you can't possess them
[1:19:31] they're mine i've claimed them they know
[1:19:33] who they are thank you lord
[1:19:36] are you hearing me church the devil
[1:19:37] right now is dying to get you
[1:19:39] but he can't because he can't get past
[1:19:42] the smell
[1:19:43] of predestination
[1:19:46] well brother andrew said moses rejected
[1:19:49] the throne to the popularity he could
[1:19:50] have young girls
[1:19:51] wives by the hundreds could have had
[1:19:53] scepters under egypt rule the world the
[1:19:55] world later on his feet
[1:19:56] he was haired every bit of it but by
[1:19:58] looking in the scripture
[1:20:01] and seeing the day he was living in and
[1:20:04] know
[1:20:04] that something in him
[1:20:08] that pre-destinated seed of god
[1:20:11] went to work
[1:20:14] can i preach to you for a second moses
[1:20:16] looking at all that
[1:20:18] and said i'll fall there and every bit
[1:20:19] of it i'll leave this mud pit
[1:20:21] and i'll sit on the side of pharaoh's
[1:20:24] throne but the pre-destined seat
[1:20:27] on the inside of his soul went to work
[1:20:29] and the prophet said
[1:20:30] moses was a predestinated seed jesus
[1:20:34] was a predestinated seed and see because
[1:20:36] you
[1:20:37] are a predestinated seed just like
[1:20:40] christ
[1:20:41] was and when the rain falls on the seed
[1:20:44] that life produces itself when the holy
[1:20:48] spirit falls
[1:20:51] now how many knows genesis 1 11 says
[1:20:53] every seed
[1:20:54] must bring forth of its own kind and god
[1:20:57] said
[1:20:57] let the earth bring forth grass the herb
[1:21:00] yielding seed
[1:21:01] and the fruit tree yielding fruit after
[1:21:04] his kind let's say that together after
[1:21:08] he is kind whose seed is in itself
[1:21:11] up on the earth and it was so see the
[1:21:14] seed was there
[1:21:16] and the seed controlled the vessel to
[1:21:18] yield the fruit
[1:21:19] now look at what this word kind means it
[1:21:21] means the species
[1:21:23] every seed must come forth of its own
[1:21:25] kind and god
[1:21:26] in the beginning made man in his own
[1:21:29] image
[1:21:31] and that's the kind of man that god
[1:21:34] makes today
[1:21:36] the seminary and the incubator hatchery
[1:21:38] turns out a bunch of hybrids
[1:21:40] but when god calls a man he's in his own
[1:21:43] image
[1:21:44] the word made alive in him
[1:21:47] [Music]
[1:21:48] that's right amen notice here you got to
[1:21:51] be born
[1:21:53] not come just come on
[1:21:56] a new creature yes in his
[1:22:00] own image of his kind to be expressed
[1:22:05] word on earth see god's kind
[1:22:09] he said it's going to be word expressed
[1:22:11] on earth then what are we to be
[1:22:13] sons of god with the expressed word in
[1:22:16] the church
[1:22:17] but if you're god's kind i mean it's
[1:22:19] god's kind
[1:22:20] he said that's different see you're the
[1:22:22] expressed image of the word making
[1:22:25] itself manifest
[1:22:26] oh my why it's got to if the water falls
[1:22:29] on it
[1:22:30] it's got to do it see the holy ghost
[1:22:33] rain
[1:22:33] is being poured out in this last day to
[1:22:36] identify
[1:22:37] god's kind the holy ghost reign
[1:22:40] is being poured out in this last day to
[1:22:43] identify
[1:22:44] amen god's kind and the devil's kind
[1:22:49] now you said andrew what are you talking
[1:22:50] about well god's kind how many believes
[1:22:52] there's a god's kind
[1:22:54] god's kind knows who they are
[1:22:57] god's kind knows whose they are
[1:23:01] and the identity of belief knows but the
[1:23:03] identity of unbelief wonders
[1:23:07] are you hear me the identity of belief
[1:23:09] knows
[1:23:10] but the identity of unbelief wonders i
[1:23:13] wonder if i'm a son of god
[1:23:14] i wonder if i'm a child of god i wonder
[1:23:17] if i've got the victory
[1:23:18] i wonder if i'm an overcomer i wonder if
[1:23:20] i can possess all things
[1:23:22] i wonder if the holy ghost has sealed my
[1:23:24] soul amen but the identity of belief
[1:23:27] which is god kind says i know
[1:23:31] now come on church we gotta find our
[1:23:33] type in the scriptures right
[1:23:35] and the promise god said jesus knew who
[1:23:38] he was
[1:23:39] jesus knew who he was but
[1:23:42] satan wondered
[1:23:46] well i got the quote here in front of me
[1:23:48] jesus noted by faith
[1:23:50] in the revelation of god's word in his
[1:23:52] own predestined life
[1:23:54] glory jesus knew who he was
[1:23:57] satan was wondering he know that he was
[1:24:00] a predestined creature of god
[1:24:01] and god himself was manifested in him
[1:24:04] it wasn't him doing the works it was the
[1:24:07] father
[1:24:08] that dwelt in him see then jesus knew
[1:24:10] the word by revelation
[1:24:12] are you hearing me jesus knew the word
[1:24:15] by revelation
[1:24:16] but satan knew the word by theology
[1:24:19] that's why he was wondering
[1:24:20] because there's no vindication to
[1:24:23] authority
[1:24:24] there's no vindication amen to theology
[1:24:26] there's no authority to theology
[1:24:28] amen can i preach to you for a second i
[1:24:30] heard a prophet of god say
[1:24:32] we have received the revelation by the
[1:24:35] hand of vindication
[1:24:37] we have received the revelation
[1:24:40] by the hand of vindication then come on
[1:24:43] church whether brandon did not deliver
[1:24:45] an opinion
[1:24:46] he did not deliver a theology he
[1:24:48] delivered a revelation
[1:24:50] that he could stand invisible union and
[1:24:52] say we now
[1:24:53] have the revelation of the seventh seal
[1:24:57] the lord
[1:24:59] i wish somebody helped me preach her for
[1:25:01] a second amen i want you to see tonight
[1:25:03] church
[1:25:03] brother david we're not here wondering
[1:25:05] we're not here guessing
[1:25:07] we're not here hoping we are here with
[1:25:10] identity
[1:25:11] by the word of a prophet in this hour
[1:25:14] oh i feel like shout right now amen the
[1:25:17] pronoun of god said see
[1:25:18] he said jesus knew the word my
[1:25:20] revelation satan knew the word by
[1:25:22] theology
[1:25:23] he said therefore satan was like a
[1:25:25] walking bible
[1:25:27] he was light brother dale that's a
[1:25:28] little word but it's a big word
[1:25:30] he was like a walking bible but you know
[1:25:32] the difference was
[1:25:33] jesus was
[1:25:37] jesus was a walking bible the devil was
[1:25:40] like a walking bible
[1:25:42] but jesus could stand there and say the

[1:27:41] age
[1:27:42] to identify you as not walking like a
[1:27:45] bible
[1:27:47] but as the walking bible
[1:27:53] it's identity crisis come on church
[1:27:58] can i preach to you for a second
[1:28:01] washington ain't the only place for to
[1:28:02] find itself right now
[1:28:05] hell's fortifying itself demons right
[1:28:08] now are four to find themselves
[1:28:09] you know why because they're finding out
[1:28:12] that there's a people
[1:28:13] in the last days that's not a part of
[1:28:16] this identity crisis
[1:28:20] the prophet said jesus just stood still
[1:28:23] for he knew where he was standing
[1:28:24] he knowed somebody shout node he
[1:28:28] know that he was the lamb slain before
[1:28:31] the foundation of the world he knowed
[1:28:33] aren't you thankful for a kentucky
[1:28:35] seventh grade hillbilly preacher that
[1:28:38] could say node
[1:28:39] so we would know what he was talking
[1:28:41] about when we heard
[1:28:43] what he was talking about we would note
[1:28:45] it
[1:28:47] brother andrew aren't you embarrassed
[1:28:48] there ain't a bit of shame in me
[1:28:50] to quote this prophet and say i knowed
[1:28:53] who i am i know what i believe
[1:28:57] i know who saved my soul i know
[1:29:01] who redeemed me from the pawn shop i
[1:29:03] knowed
[1:29:04] who sent this message i knowed who
[1:29:07] called my name
[1:29:08] under the revelation of them seven seals
[1:29:10] i
[1:29:11] knowed it hallelujah
[1:29:15] oh brother he that hath an ear let him
[1:29:18] hear
[1:29:18] he know that he was producing it he know
[1:29:21] that he was the word
[1:29:22] and it worked
[1:29:26] satan knew it by wisdom and it failed
[1:29:30] satan noted by theology and it failed
[1:29:33] he quoted the same word jesus quoted the
[1:29:35] same bible from the psalms
[1:29:37] he will give his angels charge
[1:29:38] concerning you lest at any time you dash
[1:29:41] your foot against the stone
[1:29:42] he said it's also written satan noted
[1:29:44] all by knowledge
[1:29:45] same way jesus knew his identity is the
[1:29:48] same way
[1:29:49] his bride knowed
[1:29:53] the same way jesus knowed his identity
[1:29:57] is the same way his bride knowed hers
[1:30:02] brother dale how do we note it he
[1:30:05] jesus knowed it by experience and he
[1:30:08] knowed it by revelation
[1:30:09] he know that he was the son of god that
[1:30:12] was to come in the world
[1:30:13] he knowed his standing he knowed he was
[1:30:15] born the world for that purpose
[1:30:17] and that's the reason the word of god
[1:30:18] can work through him because he knowed
[1:30:21] what he was oh and jesus knowed
[1:30:24] what he was he knowed where he was
[1:30:26] standing he know that the word was
[1:30:28] speaking of him
[1:30:30] he knew his identity he could identify
[1:30:32] himself
[1:30:33] in the time come on church you're
[1:30:34] realizing that you think we're living it
[1:30:36] in any crisis look at jesus day
[1:30:38] look how many boys was being raped to be
[1:30:41] raised to be identified as the messiah
[1:30:43] look how many girls was in it at any
[1:30:45] crisis because their daddy
[1:30:46] was trying to make them the womb that
[1:30:48] would bring forth the messiah that was
[1:30:49] prophesied by isaiah
[1:30:51] look at a time but there will always be
[1:30:53] a predestinated seed
[1:30:55] that will stand in the middle of an
[1:30:57] identity crisis
[1:30:58] and say but i know
[1:31:05] but i know but
[1:31:08] are you hearing me you remember the
[1:31:10] young boy there in john 9

[1:31:21] don't know what's happened to him

[1:42:25] church
[1:42:26] everything i've been through i'm still a
[1:42:27] worshiper everything i faced i'm still a
[1:42:29] praiser
[1:42:30] on my dark days i still got a song on my
[1:42:32] sunny days i still got to shout
[1:42:34] when the walls are tall i still believe
[1:42:37] in a jericho fallen anointing
[1:42:39] are you hearing me amen i still believe
[1:42:41] in praising god
[1:42:42] when the odds are against you i still
[1:42:44] believe in worshiping god
[1:42:45] when you ain't got one thing to worship
[1:42:47] him for
[1:42:50] what he's saying i'm saying cover to
[1:42:52] give people a chance to perfect who they
[1:42:54] were
[1:42:54] and it gave me a chance to perfect who i
[1:42:56] am
[1:42:57] no matter what the devil posed in the
[1:42:59] church we're still going on
[1:43:02] whether we do it we're perfecting
[1:43:04] perseverance no matter how the devil
[1:43:06] tries to divide us
[1:43:07] we still unite ourselves together what
[1:43:09] are we doing we're perfecting unity
[1:43:12] come on church amen no matter what the
[1:43:14] devil does to stop us
[1:43:15] we still push through it why because
[1:43:18] there's a seed
[1:43:19] on the inside of our heart that must
[1:43:21] come to life
[1:43:25] now let me say it like this and i'm
[1:43:28] going to hurry here
[1:43:29] but i want to leave here for a second
[1:43:31] because a lot of people think well we
[1:43:32] just get through this covet
[1:43:33] and brother david the end time
[1:43:34] pandemic's over but actually there's
[1:43:36] really actually a there's a natural
[1:43:38] pandemic we
[1:43:39] we believe it's real we're not all right
[1:43:43] we're not saying it's not real don't wad
[1:43:46] up on me we ain't saying ain't real we
[1:43:48] we believe it's real
[1:43:50] but we still believe god's real yeah but
[1:43:53] you know what we got people that look
[1:43:54] oh come on preach me brother god take
[1:43:57] care take some liberty here
[1:43:58] we got people man i saw a guy the other
[1:44:01] day i was checking in the hotel
[1:44:02] i went in i wore my mask i went in i did
[1:44:05] what they told me to do there was a
[1:44:06] couple come in behind me
[1:44:08] bless his heart he had two masks on a
[1:44:10] big old head a big old head shield i
[1:44:12] mean the thing was wrapped around his
[1:44:13] head
[1:44:13] locked on both sides and big old arm
[1:44:15] gloves i
[1:44:16] wore them things gutting deer not
[1:44:18] checking in a hotel
[1:44:20] i mean things that i thought my you know
[1:44:22] they're going to ever extreme possible
[1:44:24] to avoid this natural end time pandemic
[1:44:26] but do you realize there's a spiritual
[1:44:28] pandemic you know what it's called
[1:44:29] it's called spiritual amnesia it's
[1:44:32] called spiritual amnesia
[1:44:34] you say what is amnesia we're told it's
[1:44:36] caused you to get to a place where you
[1:44:38] cannot identify yourself
[1:44:40] it's a it's a mercy
[1:44:43] it's an unusual thing he said but the
[1:44:45] cause is the cause is three different
[1:44:47] things one is from shock
[1:44:49] you know what he said somebody gets
[1:44:50] shocked he said they go through a war
[1:44:52] sometimes
[1:44:53] and soldiers get it you know what
[1:44:55] happens they get in a shock and they
[1:44:56] forget who they are
[1:44:57] they forget who their family is they
[1:44:59] forget what country they come from shock
[1:45:01] causes spirits and you know another
[1:45:03] thing that causes it is worry
[1:45:05] [Music]
[1:45:07] the prophet said another thing causes it
[1:45:08] is worry worry has no virtue in it all
[1:45:11] yeah just skip worry and accept faith
[1:45:15] spiritual amnesia
[1:45:17] is caused by a shock
[1:45:20] caused by a shock caused by worry but
[1:45:22] you know the third thing brother harvey
[1:45:24] that spiritual amnesia caused by
[1:45:26] brotherhood says is getting between two
[1:45:28] opinions
[1:45:29] yes sir that'll cause amnesia you lost
[1:45:32] your reasons
[1:45:33] you lost your mind you don't know who
[1:45:36] you are and you cannot identify yourself
[1:45:38] you can walk around eating everything
[1:45:40] but still you can't identify yourself
[1:45:42] you've got your scholarly education the
[1:45:44] same education you had before
[1:45:46] but you don't know where it comes from
[1:45:48] and you don't know who you are
[1:45:49] where you are or where you belong that's
[1:45:51] amnesia now look in first kings 18 21
[1:45:53] the bible says elijah came unto all the
[1:45:55] people and said how long
[1:45:58] halt ye between two opinions if the lord
[1:46:01] be god
[1:46:01] follow him but if baal then follow him
[1:46:04] notice here the problem i love this
[1:46:05] the prominent discernment in the case he
[1:46:07] actually deals with a woman halting
[1:46:10] between two opinions
[1:46:11] he said how do you do do you believe
[1:46:12] with all your heart you do you're in
[1:46:14] trouble you're not sick
[1:46:15] only you're nervous you're upset it's a
[1:46:17] mental distress like because you're
[1:46:19] you're halting between two opinions what
[1:46:21] you must do in life
[1:46:22] yours is not a sickness you have a child
[1:46:24] don't you a boy you're having family
[1:46:26] trouble at home
[1:46:27] isn't that right you don't want a
[1:46:28] divorce in your family you don't know
[1:46:30] what to do
[1:46:30] and you're not from the city you come
[1:46:32] from michigan is that right
[1:46:33] now you believe with all your hearts god
[1:46:35] will grant you your request
[1:46:37] there's only one thing you can do that's
[1:46:39] believe
[1:46:40] on the lord thank the lord
[1:46:44] only one thing you can do is believe on
[1:46:47] the lord
[1:46:47] and i'd advise you one thing to do go he
[1:46:50] says receive the baptismal spirit live
[1:46:52] for god all your life and everything
[1:46:53] will just work right
[1:46:54] now if god can tell me what's your
[1:46:56] trouble and what is your trouble now
[1:46:58] he can surely tell me the way out of it
[1:47:00] is that right that's your avenue will
[1:47:02] you receive it come here
[1:47:03] lord be merciful this woman he says
[1:47:05] grant unto her that she may receive the
[1:47:07] holy spirit
[1:47:07] may all of her troubles leave granted
[1:47:09] father i bless her for this purpose
[1:47:12] in jesus christ's name that the baby be
[1:47:14] raised in a christian atmosphere
[1:47:16] both father and mother filled with the
[1:47:17] spirit grant it lord now your husband
[1:47:19] isn't with you when you go home
[1:47:20] i trust god you'll find it different are
[1:47:22] you ready to believe you will listen
[1:47:23] here
[1:47:23] now as you believe i know he does it but
[1:47:26] i say this
[1:47:27] you're going to be better yeah
[1:47:31] you believe that he says i believe
[1:47:35] as you believe that's just what being
[1:47:36] you amen can i give you another here
[1:47:38] a person suffering with heart trouble
[1:47:40] where him comes in a prayer line a
[1:47:41] person struck with heart trouble
[1:47:43] he says here's your problem your halt
[1:47:44] between two opinions
[1:47:46] you want to serve god but you know i'm
[1:47:48] paraphrasing but you don't know what to
[1:47:49] do he said but will you sell out and
[1:47:51] serve god
[1:47:53] he said then go your way are you hearing
[1:47:55] me church listen
[1:47:56] amnesia causes people not to be able to
[1:47:59] remember
[1:48:00] yeah no
[1:48:04] can i have a few minutes here and i'll
[1:48:05] close he said we were identified with
[1:48:07] our families in this human life by
[1:48:09] marriage
[1:48:09] with our wives our family he said what
[1:48:11] if this horrible thing would happen to
[1:48:12] you
[1:48:13] and you wouldn't be able to remember who
[1:48:14] you married who's your wife which is
[1:48:16] your children
[1:48:16] who is your father mother who is your
[1:48:18] neighbor that would be a horrible thing
[1:48:20] then we are identified again and can
[1:48:22] identify ourselves in the human race
[1:48:24] by having intelligence and being
[1:48:26] different from the animal life
[1:48:28] but we're animal life what makes us
[1:48:29] different we're mammal but what makes us
[1:48:31] different
[1:48:32] we're identified by having a soul
[1:48:35] [Music]
[1:48:36] we're identified as having a soul
[1:48:41] a conscience that tells us what's right
[1:48:44] and what's wrong
[1:48:46] see church we've been halt between opini
[1:48:48] you say that brother andrew why are you
[1:48:50] why are you preaching because i'm coming
[1:48:52] to a close but i want to say this
[1:48:53] i'm tired of seeing the devil wreaking
[1:48:56] havoc in people's minds
[1:48:58] wreaking havoc in people's homes
[1:49:00] destroying their nerves
[1:49:01] destroying their mental condition it's
[1:49:03] time church we
[1:49:04] raise up it's time we raise up
[1:49:08] and remember who we are
[1:49:12] remember whose we are remember what we
[1:49:15] believe
[1:49:15] the prophet said nebuchadnezzar forgot
[1:49:17] one time he was human being
[1:49:19] he forgot he was human being he says and
[1:49:21] we forget sometimes
[1:49:22] what the christian church is he said
[1:49:24] what happens is you get amnesia
[1:49:26] and you receive a heart for the world
[1:49:30] come on preach come on but brother ben
[1:49:33] it amazes me samuel said to saul
[1:49:38] now it's done foolishly
[1:49:41] thou hast not kept the commandment of
[1:49:42] the lord which he command thee for now
[1:49:45] the lord have established thy kingdom
[1:49:46] upon israel forever
[1:49:47] but now thy kingdom shall not continue
[1:49:50] the lord hath saw him a man
[1:49:57] what's that say after
[1:50:00] his own heart
[1:50:04] come on so david wasn't wondering who he
[1:50:07] was
[1:50:09] come on preach david was identified
[1:50:13] as god's kind
[1:50:17] when he had removed him he raised up on
[1:50:19] them david to be their kingdom also he
[1:50:20] gave testimony and said i have found
[1:50:21] david the son of jesse
[1:50:23] a man yeah
[1:50:26] after my own heart
[1:50:31] come on now i mean tonight can say lord
[1:50:33] i know the world is an identity crisis
[1:50:38] but i don't want to be like saul come on
[1:50:43] come on i don't want to lose my identity
[1:50:48] and take on the identity of the
[1:50:51] preach world on
[1:50:54] when a man gets holy spirit he acts
[1:50:56] crazy anyhow
[1:50:58] but he's only acting that to the people
[1:51:00] of the world
[1:51:04] he's only crazy to the people
[1:51:08] who don't know who they are
[1:51:13] are you hearing me see
[1:51:16] i hope i'm not holding too long a person
[1:51:19] shouting in the spirit is only strange
[1:51:21] to somebody
[1:51:22] who don't know who they are
[1:51:29] a person rejoicing is only strange to
[1:51:32] somebody
[1:51:32] because they don't know who they are but
[1:51:35] when a person is rejoicing it's because
[1:51:37] they know
[1:51:38] who they are see the prophet said look
[1:51:42] at this
[1:51:42] he said when a man gets holy spirit acts
[1:51:44] crazy but he's only acting that people
[1:51:45] the world
[1:51:46] look at david when he danced around the
[1:51:47] ark and his wife sit up there and said
[1:51:48] you embarrass me
[1:51:49] and god looked down at heaven said david
[1:51:51] thou art a man after my own heart now it
[1:51:52] depends on whose heart that you belong
[1:51:54] to
[1:51:57] if you belong to the heart of the world
[1:51:59] you'll act like the world but if you
[1:52:02] belong to the heart of god
[1:52:04] you'll do things the world knows nothing
[1:52:07] about
[1:52:09] the lord israel forgot who they were
[1:52:13] they forgot where they come from they
[1:52:15] forgot all that grace had provided the
[1:52:16] prophet said so as god's people in these
[1:52:18] last days
[1:52:18] has forgotten what the testimony of
[1:52:20] being a christian means they can't
[1:52:22] identify themselves they forgot all
[1:52:23] about it they forgot his holiness
[1:52:25] that forgot his law the women were
[1:52:26] living like the rest of the world
[1:52:28] he said oh israel forgot all the laws of
[1:52:30] god they wanted a king over them like
[1:52:31] the rest of the world
[1:52:33] when the world and the church joins
[1:52:34] together they don't want nothing
[1:52:35] spiritual
[1:52:36] now the prophet identifies and i'm close
[1:52:38] right here he parallels
[1:52:39] israel's with this day yeah
[1:52:44] you know how israel was paralleled to
[1:52:47] this day
[1:52:48] i'm slowing down here for a reason yeah
[1:52:50] cause i won't drive this home
[1:52:52] is they couldn't identify themselves
[1:52:55] with supernatural things
[1:52:58] that's true they couldn't well brother
[1:53:01] says they could not identify themselves
[1:53:03] with the supernatural things anymore
[1:53:04] because they didn't want it the word the
[1:53:05] gospel sin disease had afflicted them
[1:53:07] and they loved it
[1:53:08] sin is pleasant to the unconverted heart
[1:53:10] it looks good the unconverted mind but
[1:53:12] it's the ways of death
[1:53:13] the spiritual signs the preaching of an
[1:53:16] ordained messenger from god never
[1:53:17] stirred them anymore
[1:53:18] the women could laugh right in their
[1:53:19] face and say i don't have to go hear
[1:53:20] such a stuff as that
[1:53:21] if that hasn't repeated again what is it
[1:53:25] spiritual amnesia exactly they have
[1:53:27] forgotten that god
[1:53:30] and his word is the same
[1:53:33] come on preach come on come on
[1:53:37] that's right you know what spiritual
[1:53:39] amnesia does i'm just gonna borrow a few
[1:53:40] minutes here i'm not
[1:53:41] gonna ask i'm gonna take it that's good
[1:53:46] spiritual amnesia makes people get to a
[1:53:48] spot they have no feeling inside of them
[1:53:51] yes it does come on the prophet said if
[1:53:53] it probably rose on the scene in this
[1:53:54] days that's what spiritual amnesia does
[1:53:56] gets to spot where they have no feeling
[1:53:57] on the inside of them
[1:53:58] take a real spiritual meeting where the
[1:54:00] holy spirit is healing the sick
[1:54:02] discerning the thoughts that's in the
[1:54:03] heart
[1:54:03] put it among all the churches just a
[1:54:04] great rally out here the stadium look
[1:54:06] what happened in a few minutes everybody
[1:54:07] get up and walk out
[1:54:08] they have nothing to do with it they
[1:54:10] don't want nothing to do with it they'll
[1:54:12] listen to some intellectual talk
[1:54:16] they have no feeling inside of them
[1:54:19] the power of the spirit comes down i'm
[1:54:21] just gonna rehearse these to you he said
[1:54:22] the power of jesus christ and his
[1:54:24] resurrection
[1:54:24] and the holy ghost they want nothing to
[1:54:26] do with it because it condemns them
[1:54:29] no chastisement of course is pleasant
[1:54:30] for the season but if you yield to it
[1:54:32] it'll bring forth the fruits of
[1:54:34] repentance
[1:54:42] are we are we are we are we slip into an
[1:54:45] identity crisis
[1:54:48] the prophet said you must be identified
[1:54:50] your life shows tonight you're not
[1:54:51] halfway halting between two opinions
[1:54:53] there's no such thing you're either
[1:54:54] saved or you're not saved
[1:54:56] and your spirit you're either sinner or
[1:54:58] saint you're or the other and your
[1:54:59] spiritual attitude towards god's word
[1:55:01] identifies exactly where you're standing
[1:55:06] and your attitude towards that
[1:55:08] identifies whether you have spiritual
[1:55:09] amnesia or not
[1:55:11] well brother andrew i'm a deacon and i'm
[1:55:12] a preacher well the prophet of god said
[1:55:13] that's no matter whether if you're a
[1:55:15] deacon or even if you're a preacher
[1:55:17] they get it too that's right so we find
[1:55:19] out it's contagious
[1:55:21] to the whole thing
[1:55:27] can i can i step out of the limb here
[1:55:28] and say something
[1:55:30] i believe spiritual amnesia spreads a
[1:55:31] lot more faster than covert 19 does
[1:55:37] it takes about 7 to 14 days now if a
[1:55:39] church has got it or somebody family's
[1:55:41] got it
[1:55:42] but it only takes about one or two
[1:55:43] minutes in the surface to see if a
[1:55:44] church has got it
[1:55:50] the word begins to be preached well i've
[1:55:51] heard that before and well i don't know
[1:55:53] my brother ben's preached that and i've
[1:55:54] heard this
[1:55:56] come on church
[1:56:00] have we got it tonight i wonder tonight
[1:56:04] in closing as our musicians come
[1:56:07] have we let spiritual amnesia slip in
[1:56:10] our churches
[1:56:12] slip in our homes sipping on our fa and
[1:56:15] our families
[1:56:19] i'll tell you one thing america's done
[1:56:20] is let amnesia slip in on it
[1:56:25] forgot what our forefathers fought for
[1:56:29] forgot what men and women left their
[1:56:31] homes and families and fought for and
[1:56:32] shed their blood for
[1:56:36] come on a country going down the drain
[1:56:40] which we know these things must happen
[1:56:44] because amnesia set in yeah
[1:56:47] brother david is sitting at the highest
[1:56:48] at the highest place it could
[1:56:51] come out of the government into the
[1:56:52] churches and into the into the political
[1:56:54] the world's amnesia tonight
[1:56:58] the prophet said to be an american i
[1:56:59] must be a citizen born in this country
[1:57:01] and identify with this nation as an
[1:57:03] american
[1:57:04] whatever it is i am because i am
[1:57:06] identified with it
[1:57:07] i'm identified with its shame
[1:57:11] and its glory
[1:57:16] church i wonder tonight
[1:57:21] the prophet god says all that he was i'm
[1:57:24] identified with him
[1:57:25] he said all america was i'm identified
[1:57:27] with her shame
[1:57:30] and her glory plymouth rock i'm
[1:57:32] identified with it
[1:57:33] i see delaware i'm identified with it
[1:57:37] hoisted up the flag on guam i'm
[1:57:38] identified with it
[1:57:40] right iraq i'm identified with it
[1:57:46] we're identified with it we realize that
[1:57:49] but what about the church
[1:57:51] he says to be a christian you've got to
[1:57:53] be identified with him and i'm
[1:57:54] identified with him
[1:57:56] we were with abraham at the age of 75
[1:57:58] and sarah 65
[1:57:59] when they were told they were going to
[1:58:00] have a baby and abraham took a stand
[1:58:02] upon thus saith the lord
[1:58:03] i was with abraham when his temptations
[1:58:05] come went on top of the mountain to
