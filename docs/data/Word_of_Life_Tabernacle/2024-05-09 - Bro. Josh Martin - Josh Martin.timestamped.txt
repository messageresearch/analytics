[41:18] two kiddos with me Ethan and Brielle

[41:22] travel with you or travel with me and so
[41:25] it's good to have them them with me
[41:26] tonight
[41:27] uh Philippians 2 and5 the Bible would
[41:30] say let this mind be in you which was
[41:33] also in Christ Jesus who being in the
[41:36] form of God thought it not robbery to be
[41:39] equal with God but made himself of no
[41:41] reputation and took upon him the form of
[41:44] a servant and was made in the likeness
[41:46] of men and being found in the fashion as
[41:49] a man he humbled himself and became
[41:52] obedient unto death even death of the
[41:54] Cross amen can we bow our heads tonight
[41:57] dear gracious Heavenly Father Lord we
[41:59] want to say thank you for your grace and
[42:01] your mercy Lord giving us Health in our
[42:03] bodies Lord strength Lord keeping us
[42:05] safe throughout the day Lord as we come
[42:08] into your house tonight father we've
[42:10] sang songs of worship Lord we ask that
[42:12] you would inhabit the Praises of your
[42:14] people Lord and just come among us
[42:16] tonight Lord as your word would come
[42:18] forth I ask that you would anoint it
[42:20] father Lord only you can speak to the
[42:22] hearts and meet the needs father Lord we
[42:25] commit the service into your hands we
[42:27] ask these things in your precious name
[42:29] amen you may be seated and if I had a
[42:32] subject tonight it would be God unveiled
[42:35] Among Us and um it's a it be a simple
[42:38] thought but I pray it can can be a
[42:40] blessing and a help in some way but um
[42:42] the Bible would tell us that the the
[42:44] mystery of God should be finished and I
[42:46] believe that the understanding of who
[42:49] God is has been poured out in this
[42:51] generation where God has no longer
[42:53] veiled but all the veils that has hid
[42:56] God has been loosed and you know brother
[42:58] Brandon he would preach two messages God
[43:01] unveiled Among Us and the Mighty God
[43:02] unveiled Among Us and they their
[43:04] powerful messages but in those messages
[43:06] he would talk about a king that wanted
[43:08] to know his people more but he didn't
[43:10] want to just know his people more but he
[43:12] wanted his people to know him more and I
[43:14] like how brother Brandon would say it he
[43:16] would this king would go before his
[43:18] delegates go before the council the
[43:20] courts and would say you're not going to
[43:22] see me for some time and they would ask
[43:24] him where are you going to go are you
[43:26] going to go to this country are you
[43:27] going to go to this place and he would
[43:29] say no I'm going to stay right here but
[43:32] I'm going to change my form and they
[43:34] would ask him what are you going to do
[43:36] he he would say I'm taking off my Royal
[43:38] garments I'm going to take on the
[43:40] garments of a peasant and I'm going to
[43:42] go cut the wood with the wood Chopper
[43:44] I'm going to go prune the prune the
[43:46] vines with the pruners I'm going to till
[43:48] the ground with the tillers I I'm going
[43:50] to to take on another form in order to
[43:53] know my people more then brother Brandon
[43:56] would say the super Supernatural God
[43:58] changed into a natural man God wanted to
[44:01] know his people more and so the Bible
[44:03] would tell us in Hebrews 4 and 15 for we
[44:06] have not a high priest which cannot be
[44:08] touched with the feelings of our
[44:10] infirmities but was in all points
[44:12] tempted like we are yet without sin so
[44:16] God wanted to know his people more so he
[44:18] would change his form he would take on
[44:20] the form of humanity and would
[44:23] experience the pains that you would
[44:25] experience he would experience the dis
[44:27] the disappointment the discouragements
[44:29] everything that you would go through he
[44:31] would go through as well and yet would
[44:34] be without sin he would he would
[44:36] experience the grief of losing a friend
[44:39] at the tomb of Lazarus that he would
[44:41] weep he would experience weariness and
[44:43] body whenever he was on the boat on the
[44:46] in the ocean and when he would get tired
[44:48] and would rest he would know what it was
[44:50] like for you to get weary and body but
[44:53] yet would overcome it he would know what
[44:55] it was like to experience so s will In
[44:58] The Garden of Gethsemane and there he
[45:00] would cry out father if it if it be let
[45:02] this cup pass from me he was in the form
[45:05] of a man going through the same pains
[45:08] going through the same the same
[45:10] weaknesses and he would experience the
[45:13] same self-will that you had experienced
[45:15] and that's encouraging to me CU I know
[45:18] sometimes it's hard to press on
[45:20] sometimes it's hard to die to yourself
[45:22] and to take on the word but it's
[45:24] encouraging to know that God in the form
[45:26] of man would go through the same
[45:29] self-will and would fight the flesh that
[45:31] I don't want to go through this I don't
[45:33] want to do this but nevertheless not my
[45:36] will but thy will be done and it's
[45:38] encouraging to know in a flawed human
[45:41] vessel like myself like yourself that
[45:43] you can do the same thing he took on the
[45:46] for to let you know I know what you're
[45:48] going through but you can also know how
[45:51] I overcome it you can also know that you
[45:54] can remain sinless and spotless in a day
[45:57] of perversion you see he would also know
[45:59] what it was like to lose a good friend
[46:02] whenever uh whenever Judas would turn
[46:04] against him he was in the form of man
[46:07] taking on the pain so that you could
[46:09] know what that he could know what it was
[46:11] like if you had friends turn against you
[46:14] that you would have best friends that
[46:16] you would lose them and they would turn
[46:17] again he was taking on the form so that
[46:19] he could intercede for you you know
[46:21] could you imagine having a pastor you
[46:23] know brother Ben if he never went
[46:25] through trials if he never went through
[46:26] Hard Times how could you come and talk
[46:29] to him and say brother Ben I how did you
[46:32] overcome this H how are you doing this
[46:34] if you never went through it you see but
[46:36] it's a it's a pastor that has been
[46:38] through some things that he could give
[46:41] advice I did this God brought me through
[46:43] this and that's the way God was he come
[46:45] in the form of man to experience the
[46:48] self-will to experience the pain of
[46:50] losing a friend to experience the pain
[46:53] of having a best friend turn against him
[46:55] so that he could intercede for you and
[46:57] come down in the midst of the
[46:59] circumstance and be a friend that's
[47:01] closer than a brother closer than a
[47:03] brother the brother that's turned
[47:05] against you the friend that turned
[47:06] against you he would know what it was
[47:08] like so that he could come and and and
[47:10] encourage you and comfort you you see
[47:13] but he didn't just want to know what you
[47:16] would go through but he wanted to unveil
[47:18] himself so that you can see him and
[47:20] brother Brandon would tell us that
[47:21] whenever he was upon the cross he says
[47:24] The Mercy Seat was in plain view because
[47:27] the veil was rent from top to bottom and
[47:29] he says there stood The Mercy Seat in
[47:32] plain view for all to see and brother
[47:34] Brandon would ask the question he would
[47:36] say why did he rent The Veil because he
[47:39] wanted you to see The Mercy Seat he
[47:41] wanted you to see who he was and so when
[47:44] he took the form of man he didn't want
[47:47] just to see you he wanted you to see him
[47:49] but brother Brandon would tell us that
[47:51] it was the same God made flesh and was
[47:53] dwelt among us but Brandon would saying
[47:56] now the the same godess in the Holy
[47:58] Ghost the Father the Son the Hol not
[48:00] three Gods three offices three acts of
[48:03] one God and we see but the Brandon would
[48:06] tell us that there stood The Mercy Seat
[48:09] but many of the people were blinded and
[48:11] it really it really struck me whenever I
[48:14] was studying on these things why were
[48:16] they blinded because they were stuck in
[48:18] a form you know here stood reality Jesus
[48:21] wasn't a form he was reality he wasn't a
[48:24] shadow he was reality all the forms and
[48:27] shadows was pointing to reality you know
[48:30] whenever they would come to the to the
[48:32] Tabernacle it would slay a lamb the
[48:35] blood will pour out pour out upon them
[48:37] that was just a shadow that was just a
[48:39] type it was just a tradition there was
[48:41] no power to it to forgive sins or or to
[48:45] divorce sins so if they would come with
[48:47] the nature of sin and would the blood of
[48:49] the Lamb would cover uh sin of lying or
[48:52] the sin of blaspheming or the sin uh uh
[48:56] evil thought it would cover the sin but
[48:59] it would not divorce the sin so there
[49:01] was no reality to it and so whenever
[49:04] Christ come his blood wasn't to just
[49:06] cover the sins it was to divorce the sin
[49:09] and there would stand The Mercy Seat in
[49:11] plain view for all to see but because of
[49:15] the form they could not recognize him
[49:18] and oh my many times we can come to
[49:20] church and we live in a form we live in
[49:23] a shadow we live in a tradition of just
[49:25] coming to church on the midweek just
[49:27] coming to church on a Sunday morning
[49:29] just coming to church on a Sunday night
[49:31] that we live in a shadow and here stands
[49:34] reality you see God don't want us living
[49:37] in a shadow he want us living in reality
[49:40] he didn't want just the blood of bulls
[49:42] and goats to push past the sin he wanted
[49:45] the blood of himself to divorce the sin
[49:48] where we can stand in Victory and I
[49:51] think it's so amazing that Jesus would
[49:53] look at him and would say your father's
[49:55] Aid of the Mana and the Wilderness and
[49:57] every one of them dead but I am the
[49:59] bread of life he was saying they had a
[50:01] type that had no reality to it they died
[50:05] they drank of the water that come out of
[50:07] the Rock and they are dead but on the
[50:09] Fountain of Living Water he come and
[50:12] brought reality everything that the Old
[50:15] Testament was pointing to here stood the
[50:19] reality oh my brother Brandon would say
[50:21] redemption was in Jesus not in Moses it
[50:24] wasn't in Abraham he all them was
[50:27] pointing to something and when Christ
[50:29] come everything they pointed to was
[50:32] right in front of them and I think M we
[50:34] have went through seven Church ages we
[50:36] went through Luther we went through
[50:38] Wesley we've been through Pentecost they
[50:40] have all been pointing to something but
[50:42] here we stand in the fullness of the
[50:45] word we're not living in a shadow we're
[50:47] not just living in justification we're
[50:49] not just living in sanctification we're
[50:51] not just living in the day of the
[50:53] restoration of the gifts but the
[50:55] restoration of the word has been
[50:57] revealed in this generation that has
[50:59] brought the fullness of the word but not
[51:01] just the word but the but the realities
[51:03] of the word the presence of God has been
[51:06] revealed to us just like it was when
[51:09] Jesus was walking upon the Earth the
[51:11] same presence is walking upon the Earth
[51:14] today it's Healing The Sick it's saving
[51:16] the lost and one day it's going to
[51:18] change our bodies it ain't just a
[51:20] fiction it ain't just an imagination
[51:23] it's the realities of the word that has
[51:25] been brought to us in this generation oh
[51:29] hallelujah it's a reflection of what God
[51:32] is but a reflection has to take on a
[51:35] form you see reflection you know if you
[51:37] have a light the light has the power to
[51:40] be a reflection but in order to be a
[51:42] reflection something has to get up to it
[51:45] and then you can see a reflection of it
[51:47] a mirror is a reflection but you see an
[51:50] order to be a reflection you got to get
[51:52] in line with it and once you get in line
[51:54] with it you can see what the reflection
[51:57] is and this word is to reflect itself
[51:59] through our through our vessels brother
[52:01] Brandon would say we are written
[52:03] Epistles read and known of all men he
[52:06] would say it's not it's not new epistle
[52:08] not new words written it's taken up the
[52:11] words that has been written and is
[52:13] coming inside of our life brother
[52:15] Brandon he would talk about Peter and
[52:17] John he would say Peter and John they
[52:19] looked at him and and perceived that
[52:22] they were ignorant and unlearned men but
[52:25] they had a they had a come up with the
[52:27] conclusion that they had been with Jesus
[52:29] but the B says they were written
[52:31] Epistles they were reflections of what
[52:34] the word was and I say Lord let me be
[52:36] that in this generation whenever I'm at
[52:38] work whenever I'm at school wherever I
[52:41] am at let me take the word that the
[52:43] world can look upon my life and say that
[52:46] is a written epistle he ain't just
[52:48] living a life but he's living a life of
[52:50] the Gospel let me be that in this
[52:53] generation but you see brother Brandon
[52:55] he would tell
[52:57] that the word would be would be be would
[52:59] would be tradition ised it would be uh
[53:01] it would be created over he would say
[53:03] whenever the word would go to NAA Rome
[53:05] it would then be denominated and it
[53:07] would be veiled up once again but it was
[53:10] promised in this generation by an
[53:13] evening time message that it would be
[53:15] loosed and unveiled again in this
[53:17] generation brother Brandon would tell us
[53:20] that uh the the the the Holy Ghost would
[53:22] be bound by the denominational Rivers
[53:25] but it's to be loose in this generation
[53:27] so just like God would unveil himself
[53:30] whenever he was upon Earth in the form
[53:32] of Jesus he's upon Earth again today
[53:35] unveiling himself loosing all of the
[53:38] Creeds all of the Traditions all of
[53:40] man's ideas so that we can see him in
[53:43] the fullness and brother Brandon would
[53:45] say this I see him the Mighty God
[53:47] unveiled I see him pull back the Creeds
[53:49] the the denominations pull back the
[53:51] Skeptics the educational programs
[53:54] everything walk forward and stand there
[53:56] and he says you think the Creeds could
[53:58] conquer him you think the denominations
[54:01] could conquer him you think the World
[54:03] Council can conquer him he conquered
[54:06] everything broke every feather rip open
[54:08] hell tore off the to tore off the seal
[54:11] entered into the holiest of holies
[54:13] unveiled himself to us being the word oh
[54:17] my so he unveiled himself to us being
[54:20] the word that's why we needed a message
[54:22] to tear open the seals so that we can
[54:25] see God in this generation in the form
[54:28] of his word you see brother Brandon
[54:30] would say it's all revealed in there the
[54:32] Seven Seals opened up the revelation of
[54:34] what that was and that's what it was see
[54:37] it's still in the word you see you can't
[54:39] get out of the word it was the it won't
[54:42] leave the word it's and God's spirit
[54:45] will never leave that word and so if the
[54:48] Holy Ghost was bound by traditional
[54:50] rivers and would be loosed in this
[54:52] generation the only way it could be
[54:54] loosed would be by a perfect word and
[54:56] brother brandom says the Holy Ghost is
[54:58] with the word and the Seven Seals would
[55:01] re reveal that to us that the Holy Ghost
[55:04] is still in the word oh that's why we
[55:06] don't believe in a dead letter that's
[55:08] why we don't believe in just Traditions
[55:10] that's why we don't believe in just
[55:12] coming the church but this message has
[55:14] revealed to us that the same holy ghost
[55:17] that the apostles received is the same
[55:19] holy ghost that our young people can
[55:21] receive the same Revival that started in
[55:24] the book of Acts is the same Revival
[55:27] that is going on today oh Hallelujah you
[55:30] see and it it took God unveiling himself
[55:33] in order for us to see it and brother
[55:36] Brandon would talk about a violin he
[55:38] would say an Auctioneer would say what
[55:40] am I offered for this violin and brother
[55:42] Brandon would say they wouldn't know
[55:44] what was there and so one would say $1
[55:47] $5 $10 $15 and brother the Brandon would
[55:51] say there was a man in the midst that
[55:53] didn't think it should be sold for that
[55:55] little so what he would do is he would
[55:58] pick up the bow tighten up the bow pick
[56:00] up the violin and would start to play a
[56:03] tune you see he didn't magically make
[56:06] something appear but he knew what was
[56:08] veiled there oh my brother Brandon would
[56:10] see everybody started to cry because
[56:12] they had never heard such beautiful
[56:14] music and then the auctioneer would look
[56:17] at him and would say now what am I
[56:19] offered one would say uh 5,000 10,000
[56:22] 15,000 and brother Brandon would say
[56:24] what made the difference the Master's
[56:27] Hand revealed what was hidden there oh
[56:30] Hallelujah he didn't bring something new
[56:32] he just unveiled what was already hidden
[56:35] there oh my and God in this generation
[56:38] has come on the scene the mighty Angel
[56:40] come with an open book in hand he had
[56:42] come with an open book to unveil what
[56:45] was hidden there all alone your rapture
[56:47] was hidden there your body change was
[56:49] hidden there your future home was hidden
[56:52] there your victory was hidden there your
[56:54] name was hidden there but it was held up
[56:56] but the Master's Hand in this generation
[56:59] would unveil the book so that you can
[57:02] see what God really is you can see the
[57:05] promises that he has for you in this
[57:07] generation oh Hallelujah brother Brandon
[57:10] would say this so now in this age when
[57:12] the old denominational and traditional
[57:15] veil has been rent from the word of God
[57:18] so it can be manifested you see what I
[57:21] mean the tradition says all of those
[57:23] things are passed let it soak in a
[57:25] little bit these things are passed but
[57:27] in the last day the traditional veil has
[57:30] been rinsed apart and here stands the
[57:33] pillar of fire see here he is
[57:35] manifesting the word for this day the
[57:38] veil has been rant so brother Brandon
[57:41] would say the purpose of the veil being
[57:43] rented was for the word to be manifested
[57:46] oh my so what's going to manifest the
[57:48] word but the Brandon would say behind
[57:50] the veil was the sh Glory was the pillar
[57:53] of fire manifesting the word and so that
[57:57] takes all the pressure off of you and I
[57:59] of trying to manifest the word it takes
[58:02] the pressure off of young people trying
[58:04] to be good Christians because once God
[58:07] is unveiled to you there stands the
[58:09] pillar of fire oh come on now there
[58:12] stands the sh of Glory manifesting the
[58:14] word and so if the Holy Ghost can ever
[58:17] come on the inside you don't have to
[58:19] worry about trying to make the word live
[58:21] the word will live itself inside of your
[58:24] life oh my but you see the Bible or
[58:27] brother Brandon would tell us that uh
[58:30] wherever the word is it is always veiled
[58:32] he would say it's unveiled to the bride
[58:35] but it stays veiled to the unbelievers
[58:37] and he would say it's always been a
[58:39] flesh fail he would talk about the drama
[58:41] and would say one actor can have many
[58:43] different masks but it's the same person
[58:46] many different masks he talks about
[58:48] whenever his girl was in the in the high
[58:50] school play I believe he would say there
[58:52] was one individual that would come out
[58:54] with one mask then would go behind the
[58:56] curtain it would come out with a
[58:58] different mask he says it was the same
[59:00] person but had many different masks and
[59:03] he talks about the word he says the word
[59:05] has had many different veils he would
[59:07] talk about how the word was veiled
[59:10] behind Moses and he says Moses was the
[59:12] Living Word to the people because it was
[59:15] veiled behind him and I thought my that
[59:17] is powerful under the blood of bulls and
[59:19] goats he was still The Living Word to
[59:22] the people what about today oh we've got
[59:24] the Shak Glory veiled Among Us what
[59:27] about today it's the Living Word in
[59:30] manifestation inside of Flesh once again
[59:33] and he would talk about how he was
[59:35] veiled in the prophets he would be
[59:37] veiled through through the prophets of
[59:38] the Old Testament and then he would be
[59:40] veiled behind Jesus he was many
[59:43] different masks but all the same God and
[59:46] then he would talk about he would talk
[59:48] about the Tabernacle and I think it's so
[59:50] incredible because he said behind the
[59:52] badger skins was the Shak Glory but one
[59:56] once it was a badger behind those skins
[59:59] but now it's the housing place for the
[1:00:01] glory of God and then he would stop and
[1:00:04] would say so can your skins be changed
[1:00:07] into the housing place for the glory of
[1:00:10] God so just like God was veiled in Moses
[1:00:13] just like God was veiled in the prophets
[1:00:15] veiled in Jesus veiled behind the behind
[1:00:17] the badger skins he's taken on another
[1:00:20] veil in this generation another mask in
[1:00:23] this generation and brother Brandon
[1:00:25] would say changes his mask but never his
[1:00:28] word and never his nature so the same
[1:00:31] nature that was that would come with the
[1:00:33] word inside of Moses that would cause
[1:00:36] him to turn water in blood it would
[1:00:38] cause lies to be spoken into existence
[1:00:41] was the same anointing that would be
[1:00:43] behind the Bader skins that would take a
[1:00:46] dead Rod that was dead that would make a
[1:00:49] blossom again oh Hallelujah it was the
[1:00:51] same anointing that would be with Jesus
[1:00:54] when he was in the Tomb that would cause
[1:00:56] him to raise again and it's the same
[1:00:58] anointing that has been loosed in this
[1:01:01] generation that can come inside of a
[1:01:03] vessel and take somebody that is dead in
[1:01:05] sins dead in trespasses dead in their
[1:01:08] iniquities and make their life blossom
[1:01:10] with the sweet perfume of the word oh
[1:01:14] he's taking on a different Veil but you
[1:01:17] see brother Brandon would say that uh
[1:01:19] when when when God said or when the
[1:01:21] Bible says in Joel that I will pour out
[1:01:23] in the last days my spirit but the
[1:01:25] brandom says he would empty himself not
[1:01:28] just pour from himself but pour himself
[1:01:32] and he says now when it was said here
[1:01:33] that he emptied himself or poured it out
[1:01:35] now we think of it like this that he
[1:01:37] would vomit up the English word of
[1:01:39] emptied or poured out from him see
[1:01:42] something went out of him that was
[1:01:44] different from him but the word kenos in
[1:01:47] the Greek does not mean that he vomit up
[1:01:49] his arm went off or his eye went out or
[1:01:52] another person that is he changed
[1:01:54] himself he poured himself into amen into
[1:01:57] another mask into another form not
[1:02:00] another person went out from him called
[1:02:03] the Holy Spirit but he but it was him
[1:02:05] himself you get it he poured himself
[1:02:08] into the people Christ in you how
[1:02:11] beautiful how wonderful to think God
[1:02:14] pouring himself into human beings into
[1:02:17] the believer pour out it was a part of
[1:02:20] his drama oh Hallelujah so he didn't
[1:02:22] pour from himself he poured himself but
[1:02:25] the brand would say all that was in God
[1:02:27] he poured in the Christ all that was in
[1:02:29] Christ he would pour into the believer
[1:02:32] and he would say in another place but
[1:02:33] the Brandon would say it's not God
[1:02:35] coming with men it's God coming in men
[1:02:38] and I say Lord let me be a reflection of
[1:02:41] what this word really is you know
[1:02:43] brother Brandon would talk about would
[1:02:44] talk about Adam and Eve he would say
[1:02:46] that when Adam was created in the
[1:02:48] beginning he was to be a reflection and
[1:02:50] he wanted to master a masterpiece family
[1:02:53] and so what he would do is he would take
[1:02:55] something from Adam not another
[1:02:57] individual he didn't create another
[1:02:59] Masterpiece but he took from the
[1:03:02] original Masterpiece and created
[1:03:04] something and he would say so was it
[1:03:06] when Jesus he created another
[1:03:08] Masterpiece after Adam was flawed after
[1:03:11] Adam was broken he would see created
[1:03:13] another Masterpiece but then he would
[1:03:16] strike Jesus upon the cross and out of
[1:03:19] Jesus would come another Masterpiece it
[1:03:22] was to be a reflection of what Jesus was
[1:03:25] just like Jesus was word made flesh when
[1:03:28] the Bride come from him it was word made
[1:03:30] flesh once again I say Lord here are are
[1:03:33] standing upon Earth we're walking upon
[1:03:36] Earth but we're living in another
[1:03:38] atmosphere we're living in another
[1:03:40] dimension we're living in a spirit world
[1:03:42] where all things are possible we're
[1:03:44] living in a dimension where we can
[1:03:46] believe for the sick to be healed for
[1:03:48] the prodical to come hope that's why you
[1:03:50] can't you can't give up on your
[1:03:52] practical you can't give up on your lost
[1:03:54] loved ones we're living in an hour where
[1:03:56] all things are possible oh we're not
[1:03:58] just living in a type of a shadow but
[1:04:01] we're living in the realities where we
[1:04:03] can believe for our sons to come home we
[1:04:05] can believe for our daughters to come
[1:04:07] home oh Hallelujah but you see many
[1:04:10] times that we still keep God veiled you
[1:04:13] know brother Brandon would say this I'm
[1:04:14] telling you when you break the
[1:04:16] traditional Veil that Jesus is way back
[1:04:19] and he is that now when you find he's
[1:04:21] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:04:24] there's no limit to what God God can do
[1:04:26] right here in this convention and show
[1:04:29] this world that they need not a world
[1:04:31] fair not a World Revival but they be
[1:04:33] filled with the presence of the Living
[1:04:35] God IM maray and veiling himself into
[1:04:38] human flesh Hallelujah I believe it
[1:04:41] broken every barrier broken every Veil
[1:04:44] every Veil nothing can hide his presence
[1:04:47] when people get hungry in the heart
[1:04:49] there's a veil ready to be broke and so
[1:04:52] he's saying here there can be many
[1:04:54] different veils but if you get hungry
[1:04:57] enough to see the realities of his
[1:04:59] presence there's a veil that's ready to
[1:05:01] be broke you may say brother Joshua and
[1:05:03] the message we're not we're not living
[1:05:05] under a Creed or an idea but we can
[1:05:08] still have veils of complexes we can
[1:05:10] still have veils of insecurities we can
[1:05:13] have veils where I'm not good enough I'm
[1:05:15] not worthy of a nobody likes me we can
[1:05:17] have veils of discouragement we can have
[1:05:20] veils of bitterness all of these veils
[1:05:23] can keep us from seeing the reality and
[1:05:26] put us in a shadow but brother Brandon
[1:05:28] would say if you get hungry enough
[1:05:30] there's a veil that's ready to be broken
[1:05:33] oh my let us get hungry enough that we
[1:05:36] can look at our brother and forgive him
[1:05:38] we can throw out the bitterness let us
[1:05:40] get hungry enough that we can fight past
[1:05:42] complexes let us get hungry enough that
[1:05:45] we can throw out insecurities and think
[1:05:47] the thoughts that God has for us you
[1:05:50] know God has good thoughts of you but
[1:05:52] you got to believe those thoughts you
[1:05:54] know the B would tell us about Gideon
[1:05:57] remember Gideon the Bible would say that
[1:05:59] the angel would come to him with a
[1:06:00] message and would say you're a mighty
[1:06:02] man of Valor and what was the first
[1:06:04] thing that Gideon would say to him I am
[1:06:06] poor I'm I'm from a poor family I'm the
[1:06:09] least in my father's house and you know
[1:06:11] what what one of the definitions of
[1:06:13] Valor is is wealthy and here come a
[1:06:16] message saying that you are wealthy but
[1:06:19] his confession was I am poor he had to
[1:06:22] line himself up with what the word was
[1:06:25] saying and you've got to line yourself
[1:06:27] up with what the word says you are the
[1:06:29] devil can come and say you're not good
[1:06:31] enough you're not good for nothing
[1:06:32] you're never Mount to anything but the
[1:06:34] word of God is saying I'm coming to be
[1:06:37] veiled inside of your skins I'm coming
[1:06:40] to be manifested inside of your life
[1:06:43] you're my living Oracle upon the Earth
[1:06:45] today but you got to get past all those
[1:06:48] veils because always behind the veil is
[1:06:51] always the presence of God come on now
[1:06:54] the devil when to fight you if there was
[1:06:56] nothing to obtain but the reason he
[1:06:58] fights you with complexes was because
[1:07:00] there's a reality for him the reason he
[1:07:03] fights you with bitterness because he's
[1:07:05] trying to keep you from obtaining
[1:07:07] something but let's realize recognize
[1:07:10] that the devil's against us you know
[1:07:11] brother Brandon will preach a message
[1:07:13] how can I overcome and he says to
[1:07:15] overcome you got to recognize the devil
[1:07:18] in every one of his tricks you got to
[1:07:20] recognize him as real you got to
[1:07:22] recognize that he's against you and you
[1:07:24] know that really Str me brother Ben you
[1:07:26] don't just have to recognize that he's
[1:07:28] real but you got to recognize he's
[1:07:31] against you because if you fail to
[1:07:33] recognize that he's against you you're
[1:07:35] going to entertain him oh I'm preaching
[1:07:37] now you will entertain bitterness and
[1:07:40] fail to recognize that it's a veil
[1:07:43] keeping you from seeing a Revival you
[1:07:45] entertain complexes and fail to realize
[1:07:48] that it's a veil keeping you from from a
[1:07:51] Revival inside of your marriage a
[1:07:53] Revival inside of your children a
[1:07:55] Revival inside of your home but if you
[1:07:58] recognize that he's real and that he's
[1:08:01] against you then brother brandom goes on
[1:08:03] and he says then you got to recognize
[1:08:05] that the god that is in you is greater
[1:08:08] than the power that's in the enemy so
[1:08:10] you got to recognize that he's real
[1:08:12] recognize that he's against you but then
[1:08:14] you got to recognize that the god that
[1:08:17] has been unveiled in this generation is
[1:08:19] greater than every every complex greater
[1:08:23] than every bitterness greater than every
[1:08:25] insecurity and once you recognize that
[1:08:28] then you can break through a veil where
[1:08:30] you can s into the heavenlies where the
[1:08:33] devil don't know what to do with you but
[1:08:35] the brand would tell that that a man can
[1:08:37] live so close to God that the devil
[1:08:39] don't know what to do with him I think
[1:08:41] that's for a teenager that's for a
[1:08:43] housewife that's for a daddy it ain't
[1:08:45] just for the pastor it ain't just for
[1:08:47] the deacons it's for everybody that is
[1:08:50] hungry enough to fight past the bails to
[1:08:52] fight past the bitterness the fight past
[1:08:54] the Cor
[1:08:56] to s to the realities of Jesus Christ oh
[1:09:01] my because if you don't recognize it
[1:09:02] then you start to justifying it hope
[1:09:05] this okay tonight if you don't realize
[1:09:07] that something's against you you'll
[1:09:09] start justifying it you start to you oh
[1:09:11] you don't know what I've been through
[1:09:12] brother the Josh you don't know what
[1:09:14] that brother said to me you're
[1:09:15] justifying the spirit and the spirit is
[1:09:18] keeping a Revival from your
[1:09:21] children come on now many people don't
[1:09:23] understand why they're their children
[1:09:25] children can't break through the
[1:09:26] presence of God what are the veils are
[1:09:28] you putting in front of them come on now
[1:09:31] you can't expect I hope this is okay you
[1:09:33] can't expect to tear down the pastor and
[1:09:36] the pastor help your children you can't
[1:09:39] expect to tear down the ministry and the
[1:09:41] ministry help your children you're
[1:09:43] building up barriers I'm preaching now
[1:09:46] you're building up veils that you're
[1:09:48] keeping a Revival from it but I say
[1:09:50] let's let's create another atmosphere
[1:09:53] inside of our homes let's break through
[1:09:55] every Veil you know I was doing some
[1:09:57] work on my house I was remodeling my
[1:09:59] house and just give some a word of
[1:10:01] advice don't ever remodel a house if
[1:10:03] you're living in it that was the worst
[1:10:06] idea that my wife ever had but anyway
[1:10:10] but anyways that here I I was coming to
[1:10:12] the last stage of the house I was uh I
[1:10:16] was doing the tile I don't know if
[1:10:17] anybody's ever done tile work
[1:10:19] before it's no fun at all and here I was
[1:10:22] coming to the grouting part of it I was
[1:10:24] starting to grout the towel you know and
[1:10:26] I had my sponge I had my bucket I was
[1:10:28] starting to clean the tiw had water in
[1:10:30] the bucket you know and every time I
[1:10:32] would clean the tile it would still be
[1:10:34] dirty and it was really getting me
[1:10:36] aggravated I would clean the towel it
[1:10:38] would be dirty I would clean the tole
[1:10:40] and I was getting mad at my sponge and I
[1:10:42] thought my goodness the sponge is
[1:10:44] supposed to be cleaning the towel off
[1:10:45] and something struck me as I was going
[1:10:47] outside it wasn't the spong's fault it
[1:10:50] wasn't the water's fault it wasn't the
[1:10:52] bucket's fault it was my fault because I
[1:10:55] when I dump out the water it was dirty
[1:10:57] water and so the sponge was just soaking
[1:10:59] up the environment that I was putting it
[1:11:02] into oh I'm preaching now and children
[1:11:05] are sponges they soak up your bitterness
[1:11:08] they soak up your insecurities they soak
[1:11:10] up the gossip they soak up these things
[1:11:13] and then that's what they're going to
[1:11:14] produce the sponge was just making what
[1:11:17] he was around him dirty because of the
[1:11:19] environment I was putting him in so what
[1:11:21] I had to do was empty up the bucket of
[1:11:24] water and put a new environment in it oh
[1:11:27] create in me Lord a clean heart renew a
[1:11:29] right Spirit within me a Revival starts
[1:11:32] with parents a Revival starts with the
[1:11:34] elders a Revival starts with the deacons
[1:11:37] the Revival starts with the ministry
[1:11:39] then watch a Revival strike through the
[1:11:41] young people watch the Revival strike
[1:11:43] through rebellious teenagers it's
[1:11:45] putting in them putting them in a right
[1:11:48] atmosphere for God to be unveiled to
[1:11:50] them oh Hallelujah that's what we want
[1:11:53] in this generation there some young
[1:11:55] people that is on fire with the things
[1:11:58] of God not on fire with the things of
[1:12:00] the world not on fire with the things on
[1:12:02] Facebook but let them be on fire with
[1:12:04] this message where they can quote this
[1:12:06] message they can live this message they
[1:12:09] can act out this message oh Hallelujah
[1:12:11] this message ain't just an Elder's
[1:12:13] message it's a Young Person's message
[1:12:15] come on now it's young people that's
[1:12:17] going to make a Rapture it's young
[1:12:19] people that is going to reain in the
[1:12:21] Millennium it's young people that is
[1:12:22] going to live an overcoming life
[1:12:26] Hallelujah but you see nothing can hide
[1:12:28] his presence when people get hungry in
[1:12:31] their heart there's a veil that's when
[1:12:33] that is ready to be broken and we see
[1:12:36] that God would unveil himself to be
[1:12:38] veiled but before he can be veiled in
[1:12:41] humanity he had to unveil himself to
[1:12:44] humanity and so we would see the God
[1:12:47] would come to the Fallen human meanss
[1:12:49] not the ones that would have perfect
[1:12:51] lives God wouldn't go to the high priest
[1:12:53] Jesus wouldn't go to the high priest he
[1:12:55] would go to the prostitutes he would go
[1:12:57] to the tax collectors he would go to
[1:12:59] Peter that couldn't even sign his own
[1:13:01] name he would come to the ordinary to
[1:13:04] make them great you know brother Brandon
[1:13:06] would preach a message called the super
[1:13:08] side and he says they're making
[1:13:09] everything super we're living in a day
[1:13:11] of super this super that he says they
[1:13:13] got super highways it used to take I
[1:13:15] think it said eight days to get from the
[1:13:17] East to the west but now it takes four
[1:13:20] days and he would said it's because it
[1:13:22] went from two lane highways to four lane
[1:13:24] highways they've got super highways now
[1:13:27] he says they got supercars that once
[1:13:29] would go 55 mes an hour no they're going
[1:13:31] 75 they got supermarkets he says by
[1:13:34] making something super they're doing
[1:13:37] away with the ordinary and you know that
[1:13:39] really struck me that before they can
[1:13:41] make something super they got to do away
[1:13:44] with the ordinary and that's what Hitler
[1:13:45] would do he wanted the super race and so
[1:13:48] anybody that had a blemish he would do
[1:13:50] away with him anybody that didn't line
[1:13:52] up to what he thought was super he would
[1:13:54] do away with him but we see his kingdom
[1:13:57] would crash down but that's not the way
[1:13:59] God is working God ain't coming to the
[1:14:01] ones that are super to do away with the
[1:14:03] ordinary he's picking up the ordinary oh
[1:14:07] Hallelujah he's picking up the ordinary
[1:14:09] housewife that has to that gets tired
[1:14:12] and weary and body for taking care of
[1:14:14] the children he's taking that ordinary
[1:14:16] person and making a Powerhouse out of
[1:14:19] him he's taking an ordinary daddy
[1:14:21] brother Brandon would say that he's
[1:14:22] taking the ordinary daddy that would
[1:14:24] have a lunch under his arm and will go
[1:14:26] to work he's taking that person to make
[1:14:28] a super make a super race out of him
[1:14:31] it's taking an ordinary young person and
[1:14:33] making a Powerhouse out of him God ain't
[1:14:36] doing away with the ordinary he's
[1:14:38] picking up the ordinary and raing
[1:14:40] himself inside of their skins brother
[1:14:43] Brandon would say now here is men
[1:14:44] fishermen Tax Collectors little humble
[1:14:47] women just ordinary Housewives little
[1:14:50] virgin girls they were believers they
[1:14:52] were believing that this was the truth
[1:14:55] just ordinary Housewives oh man you know
[1:14:58] sometimes the housewives feel feel left
[1:15:00] down that the Daddy's got the calling
[1:15:02] you know he might be a deacon might be a
[1:15:04] preacher might be a song leader or he
[1:15:05] might be just a solid man and the
[1:15:07] Daddy's still left out you know but you
[1:15:09] notice that it was it was jocked I
[1:15:12] believe that would save Moses and
[1:15:14] brother Brandon would say that it was
[1:15:16] jocked that was that that that was
[1:15:19] praying for God to send a deliverer then
[1:15:21] God would give a deliverer it was juned
[1:15:24] that was created a place for Moses to be
[1:15:26] saved it was a little mother that had a
[1:15:29] purpose and a calling upon her life to
[1:15:32] produce a super race and I think if
[1:15:35] parents would ever get a get a
[1:15:37] revelation that their calling upon Earth
[1:15:40] is greater than what they think it is
[1:15:42] the devil likes to come and put mind
[1:15:44] battles on you that you're no good for
[1:15:46] nothing that you've got no purpose that
[1:15:48] the God don't need you that's a lie from
[1:15:50] the pits of hell because sitting right
[1:15:53] beside you is miniature Gods sitting
[1:15:56] right beside you but you're raising up
[1:15:58] is miniature Gods the God is raising up
[1:16:01] in this generation we've got a purpose
[1:16:03] upon earth that is greater than what the
[1:16:06] devil tells us oh Hallelujah but you see
[1:16:09] brother Brandon mer say this God hides
[1:16:11] himself and simple little washwoman or
[1:16:14] ordinary men with dinner under his arms
[1:16:17] kisss his wife and children goodbye and
[1:16:19] go out there maybe hide himself in that
[1:16:21] man to do something that an Archbishop
[1:16:24] would know nothing about you see you
[1:16:25] don't blow no you don't blow no horns or
[1:16:28] send it out God just gets the glory
[1:16:30] that's all the simple hear it hand or
[1:16:33] glad you see but what makes what makes
[1:16:36] these Ordinary People candidates for
[1:16:38] deity to come inside because they were
[1:16:41] empty you know we were broken I'm sure
[1:16:44] we all got testimonies that we can
[1:16:46] testify that we was broken you was hurt
[1:16:49] you were scarred you were crushed but
[1:16:51] that there put you in a position for
[1:16:53] deity to come and placed himself inside
[1:16:56] of you you know cuz the Bible would tell
[1:16:57] us of the widow woman and Elisha that
[1:17:00] her sons are about to be sold as slaves
[1:17:03] you'll remember the story in the Bible
[1:17:04] and the Bible would say that Elisha
[1:17:06] would come to her and say do you have
[1:17:08] any oil and she would say I've just got
[1:17:10] a little bit of oil in this course in
[1:17:12] this jar and she the Bible would say
[1:17:15] that he would tell her go far and abroad
[1:17:18] and get all of the empty vessels not the
[1:17:21] half empty not the 3/4 empty but get
[1:17:24] empty vessels and we know what would
[1:17:26] happen she would go out and get all of
[1:17:28] the empty vessels and would bring those
[1:17:30] empty vessels to the prophet and the
[1:17:33] prophet would take that little jar of
[1:17:34] oil and will begin to pour inside of
[1:17:37] those empty vessels and what is so
[1:17:40] incredible is he never ran out of oil
[1:17:42] he's going to run out after the first
[1:17:44] jar he's going to run out after the
[1:17:46] second jar but as all as many as empty
[1:17:48] vessels were called he had enough to
[1:17:51] fill it oh my but they had to be empty
[1:17:54] God had you had to get you empty that's
[1:17:57] why you had to go through a heartbreak
[1:17:59] maybe you had to go through
[1:18:00] discouragement maybe you had to be
[1:18:02] crushed where you couldn't get back up
[1:18:04] but then deity would come and pick you
[1:18:06] up and would say I needed you Broken
[1:18:09] Hallelujah I needed you empty I needed
[1:18:12] you crushed so that I can put you back
[1:18:15] together you had to be empty and God
[1:18:18] going to run out of himself with the 120
[1:18:20] in the upper room but if there's still
[1:18:22] empty vessels that God is calling he's
[1:18:25] still pouring deity inside of those
[1:18:28] vessels and veiling himself inside of
[1:18:30] your skins oh Hallelujah that's God
[1:18:34] living inside of humanity Humanity with
[1:18:37] Fallen with W with with with Fall Fallen
[1:18:40] nature or with human human weaknesses
[1:18:43] human desires and here comes Humanity
[1:18:46] living inside of it and brother Brandon
[1:18:48] would say this here the Shak of Glory
[1:18:50] manifests him it brings forth the Word
[1:18:53] of Promise right out to you that's the
[1:18:56] reason that he had to Veil Moses face
[1:18:58] because in him was the word he veiled
[1:19:01] Jesus as a humble little man to keep
[1:19:03] them from saying Jehovah and he veils
[1:19:05] himself today in Earth and vessels with
[1:19:08] the shik glory the outside looks like a
[1:19:11] bunch of holy rollers and old Badger
[1:19:13] skin but the inside hides the shika
[1:19:16] Glory the outside still looks like
[1:19:18] Fallen Humanity but on the inside is
[1:19:22] deity living inside of those skin and
[1:19:25] brother the Brandon would say that it's
[1:19:27] the it's the skins that blinds many
[1:19:29] people and you know sometimes it's our
[1:19:31] own skins the blinds what God is doing
[1:19:33] in our own lives we know what we used to
[1:19:36] do we know the things we used to talk
[1:19:38] about we know the things we used to look
[1:19:40] at and that skin blinds us from and
[1:19:43] avails us from God coming and living
[1:19:46] inside of it but brother Brandon would
[1:19:48] say that you can look at skin and would
[1:19:50] say I know what she used to do I know
[1:19:53] what he used to do but ROM say but what
[1:19:55] about now what's veiled in those skins
[1:19:58] now and I say the same thing for you
[1:20:00] don't let condemnation Veil you from
[1:20:03] seeing the presence of God in
[1:20:06] manifestation today I don't care what
[1:20:08] you did yesterday 10 years ago what is
[1:20:11] God doing today you see cu the accuser
[1:20:13] would like to come and accuse you of
[1:20:16] things you used to do but what about
[1:20:18] today you know the accuser H has no
[1:20:22] authority to bring you down unless you
[1:20:24] him to he has no authority to bring you
[1:20:27] down unless you listen to him you know
[1:20:29] cuz the Bible would tell us that the
[1:20:31] accuser the that accuse the Brethren day
[1:20:33] and night has been cast down he has been
[1:20:36] cast down but we have to overcome him
[1:20:39] the Bible says we Overcoming By the
[1:20:41] blood of the lamb and by the word of Our
[1:20:44] Testimony and I love that because our
[1:20:46] testimony is greater than the accusation
[1:20:50] oh come on now the testimony of what God
[1:20:52] is doing today is greater than the
[1:20:55] accusation of yesterday oh come on now
[1:20:58] the devil knows that he can't get you
[1:21:01] but he will come and accus you of things
[1:21:03] you used to do to try to Veil you up
[1:21:06] from seeing a Revival you know the Bible
[1:21:08] would tell us about Daniel and Daniel
[1:21:11] the Bible says he was accused and he was
[1:21:13] accused and thrown unto the Lion's Den
[1:21:15] and then the king would come and would
[1:21:17] say Daniel was your God able to deliver
[1:21:20] you and he would say yes he sent his
[1:21:22] angel that would steal the lion mouth
[1:21:25] and before him was innocency found in me
[1:21:29] so the testimony of Daniel was greater
[1:21:33] than the accusation of the accuser oh in
[1:21:36] the midst of the accusation before God
[1:21:39] he stood innocent and I say in the midst
[1:21:42] of the accusation before God you stand
[1:21:45] innocent God don't see a spot he don't
[1:21:48] see a blemish all he sees is the blood
[1:21:51] of Jesus that covers and divorces sins
[1:21:54] don't let the accuser Veil you up from
[1:21:57] seeing the presence of God maybe you say
[1:22:00] brother Josh I'm fighting with
[1:22:01] condemnation the Bible would tell us
[1:22:03] about the three Hebrew boys and the
[1:22:05] Bible says that that the that these
[1:22:07] accusers would accuse the Jews certain
[1:22:10] Jews so it wasn't just the entire nation
[1:22:13] but it was inside of this nation were
[1:22:16] certain Jews he didn't go the accusers
[1:22:19] didn't go to the ones that were bowing
[1:22:21] he only come to the ones that were
[1:22:23] certain oh oh Hallelujah and if the
[1:22:26] devil's fighting you it's because you're
[1:22:28] certain you're certain in whom you have
[1:22:30] believed he's not after the make
[1:22:32] Believers he's not after the unbelievers
[1:22:35] he's after the ones that are certain and
[1:22:37] the Bible would say that they would
[1:22:38] accuse him and you know that they got
[1:22:40] thrown into the fiery furnace and what
[1:22:42] is so incredible about the story is the
[1:22:45] Bible would say the king looked and says
[1:22:47] didn't we throw three men bound into the
[1:22:50] midst of the fire below there's four men
[1:22:53] Loos oh in the midst of the accusation
[1:22:56] God would unveil himself and when God
[1:22:58] would unveil himself it would set them
[1:23:01] free from the accusation so the very
[1:23:03] accusation that would keep them bound
[1:23:06] when God unveiled himself they would
[1:23:08] become loose oh when God has come in the
[1:23:11] midst in this generation to cut you
[1:23:13] loose from every accusation to cut you
[1:23:16] loose from every condemnation so that
[1:23:19] you can see God veiled in your skins you
[1:23:22] know the Bible would tell us about the
[1:23:24] woman that was caught in the act of
[1:23:25] adultery y'all remember that story and
[1:23:28] the Bible would say that they throw this
[1:23:30] threw this woman at the feet of Jesus
[1:23:33] that they might accuse him you know but
[1:23:35] he was spotless even pilot would say I
[1:23:37] find no Faults in him and here he was
[1:23:40] the perfect Lamb of God nothing to
[1:23:42] accuse and so they couldn't accuse him
[1:23:44] but then they move on to the lady you
[1:23:46] know so they said this woman was caught
[1:23:48] in the act of adultery and we know what
[1:23:50] the Bible says Jesus stooped down and
[1:23:52] would start to write in the say and he
[1:23:54] looked up and he says woman where were
[1:23:56] thine accusers have no man condemn thee
[1:23:59] and she would say lord they're all gone
[1:24:02] and here was Jesus nothing to accuse
[1:24:05] nothing to condemn a perfect state but
[1:24:08] he didn't come just for him to be
[1:24:10] perfect he come the Fallen humanity and
[1:24:13] this Perfection that he would bestow in
[1:24:16] himself he would then give to a woman
[1:24:18] that was flawed oh Hallelujah it would
[1:24:21] say neither do I condemn thee go and S
[1:24:24] no more he wasn't just happy with him
[1:24:27] being perfect but he come to somebody
[1:24:30] that was in humanity and not perfect and
[1:24:33] would give her Perfection oh when God
[1:24:35] has given perfection in this generation
[1:24:38] when the accuser is thrown to the to the
[1:24:41] to the to the Lake of Fire you're going
[1:24:43] to remain you know that the accuser has
[1:24:46] a time limit that he is upon but you
[1:24:49] have eternity waiting on you you know
[1:24:51] that after Daniel was brought out of the
[1:24:53] Lion's the king would say go get the
[1:24:56] accusers and throw them into the lion's
[1:24:59] den so while Daniel was still walking
[1:25:02] and still had had eternity waiting on
[1:25:04] him the accusers had come to their time
[1:25:07] limit oh come on now and whenever you
[1:25:10] are reigning in the Millennium for
[1:25:12] eternity when you're living eternally
[1:25:14] they're the accusers it's going to be
[1:25:16] thrown into the Lake of Fire they've got
[1:25:19] a time limit that's why the devil is
[1:25:21] after you cuz he knows that what is end
[1:25:24] is and he knows what your future is and
[1:25:27] he tries to keep God veiled to you but I
[1:25:29] say let's not be veiled up by the things
[1:25:31] of the world let's not be veiled up by
[1:25:33] the accusation but let the presence of
[1:25:36] God Flow Free freely in every one of our
[1:25:39] lives in her home in our churches in her
[1:25:42] family let the presence of God flow
[1:25:45] freely oh Hallelujah brother Brandon
[1:25:47] want talk about the woman at the well
[1:25:49] and he said because she was redeemable
[1:25:52] whenever he whenever she recognized
[1:25:53] Jesus Jesus have brought her back to the
[1:25:56] image and I think that is so incredible
[1:25:59] her recognizing God unveiled would bring
[1:26:02] open up a channel that would bring her
[1:26:04] back to the image that God had from
[1:26:06] before the foundation of the world when
[1:26:09] God seen this woman up the well in his
[1:26:11] mind it wasn't her being condemned
[1:26:14] that's right it wasn't her in sin he
[1:26:16] seen Perfection and here he would come
[1:26:18] and unveil himself and whenever she
[1:26:20] would recognize him they would bring
[1:26:22] that image from the mind of God in the
[1:26:24] human flesh oh my here God has unveiled
[1:26:27] himself and brother brandom says that
[1:26:29] not everybody can see it can see what
[1:26:32] God is doing but the ones that was in
[1:26:34] the mind of God and the ones that were
[1:26:37] in the mind of God can see it oh and
[1:26:39] just like the woman up the well since
[1:26:40] she was redeemable this Perfection could
[1:26:43] be bestowed upon her let her musicians
[1:26:45] come and since we were redeemable we
[1:26:48] were in the mind of God there's a
[1:26:50] Perfection that can be bestowed upon us
[1:26:53] yes sir and you see the devil will try
[1:26:55] to do everything he can do to destroy
[1:26:58] your certainty he knows he can't take
[1:27:00] away deity from you but he can try to
[1:27:03] destroy your certainty and you know the
[1:27:05] Bible would tell us would tell us about
[1:27:08] uh job and I think it's so incredible
[1:27:11] that the Bible would tell us in job 1:1
[1:27:13] there was a man in the land of us whose
[1:27:15] name was job and that man was perfect
[1:27:17] and a pride and one that feared God and
[1:27:20] shoot evil and so this was job's life
[1:27:23] upon the Earth now this is what God is
[1:27:26] saying in heaven job 1:8 and the Lord
[1:27:29] said unto Satan hast thou considered my
[1:27:31] servant job that there was none like him
[1:27:34] in all the Earth the perfect and an
[1:27:36] upright man one that feareth God and ass
[1:27:38] sheth evil sir I don't think it's a
[1:27:40] coincidence that the life that job is
[1:27:43] living is matching up with God's
[1:27:44] testimony yeah you know it was somebody
[1:27:47] coming in contact and living out what
[1:27:50] God had for him and it was because of
[1:27:52] this that the accuser but didn't come to
[1:27:54] job and we know that his family was
[1:27:57] taken away he his LifeLock was taken
[1:28:00] away his servants was taken away it was
[1:28:02] the accuser of trying to destroy him but
[1:28:05] you notice what happens next it was his
[1:28:07] best friends and this is really really
[1:28:10] struck me his best friends would come to
[1:28:12] him and say you're a secret Sinner and
[1:28:14] job knew he wasn't a secret sinner
[1:28:16] because of his atonement but if the
[1:28:19] accuser could get him to doubt his
[1:28:21] atonement then all of his sins would be
[1:28:24] on his shoulders oh come on now then it
[1:28:27] would go off of his atonement upon his
[1:28:29] works and that's what the accuser was
[1:28:32] trying to do to job you're a secret
[1:28:34] sinner you had have done something you
[1:28:36] done this you done that but the Bible
[1:28:38] says in all of this job sin not nor
[1:28:41] charge God foolishly in the midst of the
[1:28:44] accusation he never lost his certainty
[1:28:46] in the atonement oh don't lose your
[1:28:49] certainty in this message you know and
[1:28:52] another thing that really stood out to
[1:28:53] me was the Bible would say that job
[1:28:55] would offer a sacrifice for his children
[1:28:58] youall remember that he says and
[1:29:00] pre-venture that they would that they
[1:29:01] would sin or do this when they were at
[1:29:03] the party he would slay a lamb and do a
[1:29:06] and do a sacrifice you know if if the
[1:29:09] accuser could get him to doubt his own
[1:29:11] atonement what hope would he have for
[1:29:14] his children you know as a father that
[1:29:16] really stood out to me if job would have
[1:29:19] lost the confidence for his own
[1:29:21] atonement what hope would he have of
[1:29:23] seeing his children
[1:29:25] what hope would he have of seeing these
[1:29:27] things again and if you ever lose your
[1:29:29] confidence in this message what hope do
[1:29:31] you have for the Next Generation come on
[1:29:33] and we're living in a perverted World
[1:29:35] we're living in a day where boys don't
[1:29:36] know if they're boys if they're girls
[1:29:38] they don't they're identifying as cats
[1:29:41] there's no certainty in this world but
[1:29:43] if the accuser could ever get you to
[1:29:45] lose the certainty of this message
[1:29:48] there's no hope for it then you're
[1:29:49] trying to whether Brandon would tell a
[1:29:51] story of the boy that was that was
[1:29:53] condemned in court he was sentenced of
[1:29:55] life in prison and brother the brandom
[1:29:57] says the boy will look and say Hey I
[1:29:59] want to be judged by my record and the
[1:30:01] judge will look at him and said it's
[1:30:02] your record that got you here you know
[1:30:05] and it's our record that gets us
[1:30:06] condemned but it's the certainty of our
[1:30:09] atonement that is redeeming us it's the
[1:30:12] certainty it's a fallen nature it's
[1:30:14] Fallen Humanity that has got us in this
[1:30:16] position right now where boys don't know
[1:30:18] if they're boys or cats or girls but
[1:30:20] it's this message that is redeeming us
[1:30:23] back to the mind of God
[1:30:24] you cannot lose the certainty of it
[1:30:27] parents you can't lose the certainty of
[1:30:29] your children making a Rapture you can't
[1:30:32] lose the certainty of seeing loved ones
[1:30:34] in the resurrection you can't lose the
[1:30:36] certainty of the Holy Ghost saving your
[1:30:39] children you can't lose the certainty of
[1:30:41] it but it's the accuser that tries to
[1:30:44] get you to throw your certainty away and
[1:30:46] compromise but this ain't the time to
[1:30:48] compromise this is the time to stand
[1:30:51] this ain't the time to give up this is
[1:30:53] the time to fight this ain't the time to
[1:30:55] give in this is the time to live in this
[1:30:57] revival get inside of this message get
[1:31:00] our children inside of this message show
[1:31:03] them what God is doing in this
[1:31:05] generation so that God can be unveiled
[1:31:07] to them than Lord oh man as a parent you
[1:31:09] know and and I'm a young parent but if I
[1:31:12] fail to get my children of Jesus Christ
[1:31:14] I miss my calling as a parent and I'm
[1:31:16] sure everyone every parent can say that
[1:31:18] you know if I fail to get my children of
[1:31:21] God I miss my calling but we don't got
[1:31:23] to fail
[1:31:24] come on it was joob that was some doing
[1:31:26] a sacrifice even in the midst of the
[1:31:28] accusation I know my children are going
[1:31:30] to be saved I know my redeemer liveth
[1:31:33] and at that day in my flesh I'm going to
[1:31:35] see God the lord giveth but the lord
[1:31:37] taketh away blessed be the holy name in
