pray amen amen you love the lord amen just looking forward to what god has in store for us if you turn with me just to isaiah 41 and verse 10 amen definitely appreciate the the song service and everyone being out on a wednesday night amen uh you know i was sitting back there and then you know you struggle you know brother ram says you know one of the hardest things that god would ever get to do is get one human human being to believe the another human being and you know just been praying and had a song on my heart to come out and sing and uh you know you just kind of battle with well you know i'm not good enough to minister you know just you begin to look at your faults and your failures just as you would come to church and you begin to look at your faults and failures and the song was keep on the firing line and that's what i was going to sing so just a confirmation you know that that god's going to you know do something tonight amen so we just thank the lord for that and it's always amazed me i know if you if you move yourself out of the way and let god lead you and if you'll follow what he lays on your heart he'll always make it make it for a purpose amen amen isaiah 41 and 10 will read this scripture and you can be seated it says fear thou not for i am with thee be not dismayed for i am thy god i will strengthen thee yeah i will help thee yea i will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness amen you can be seated tonight i'd like to speak this evening if i could and faith and faith in motion and you know we're all been all each individual person has been given a measure of faith is what the what the bible teaches what the prophet taught us and we see some have a greater measure of faith than others we see that we know that what jesus had in fullness we now have in measure you know brother branham said you know he had the complete ocean and he takes you get a spoonful out of the ocean you have all the all the same ingredients the entire ocean would have but you have it in in portion and so we see that that we've all been given a measure of faith and and i don't believe it as christians we're made to be stagnant we're not made to be still we're not made to sit still we're not made to sit on our hands but we're made to be in motion i believe that's the way god created us and so tonight i'd just like to speak on that just for a few moments i won't hold you very long but we'll go to romans 12 and verse verse 1 it says i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that you present yourself your body is a living sacrifice give me a second holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service so we see that it's our reasonable service to be a living sacrifice to god and what that that is as a sacrifice we must yield ourselves to what god wants us to do is that right so it says that's which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is good and acceptable and the perfect will of god so there's something that we have to do and we have to prove that it is good and acceptable and a perfect will of god he says for i say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly according as god has dealt every man a measure of faith so we see that we're not to think that you know if we can do greater things than this one or or in our mind that maybe this minister can do this or preaches like much better than this minister we ought not to think highly more highly of ourselves or more highly of anyone else amen is that right christ should be the head of the body for as as we have many members in one body all members have not the same office so we being many are one body in christ and everyone remembers one of another so we see that you know we can't make it without the the ministry we can't make it without the the song leaders we can't make it without the lay members we can't make it without the prayer warriors we all play a part in the body of jesus christ is that right so we see here brother brahm says he says now this is where the thing comes in this morning we're going to talk about now he says all right a house he says the foundation is first he says what is the foundation of christianity he says faith in the word of god he says that is your foundation then you begin to grow then you start to begin to add to this foundation so we see first of all if you don't have faith in the word of god you cannot grow in any way that has to be your foundation and what the faith in the word of god means we take that word for what it says and for what it is in the scripture so when when when jesus says something in the scripture when god come down and and through the inspiration the holy ghost had had men pick up a pen and begin to write we know that that is the direct word of god we've got to have faith in that word of god is that right that when we when we begin to pray whenever we we begin to use the scripture and we begin to quote the scripture we've got to believe that god put that there and it's going to come to pass is that right now if you have if you don't have faith in something you know you've heard of the placebo effect in medicine you know telling people that this medicine will cure this disease and then give them a sugar pill and and nothing be nothing nothing no medicinal purpose in that pill but because their mindset is this pill will make them better they know that if they take it they'll get better is that right and as christians we ought to know that when we take the word of god it's going to come to pass we ought not to take the word of god and say it might happen or it could happen but it's going to happen is that right we have to have the mindset that god is going to do something whenever we put our faith into motion is that right and you know god doesn't like anything that's stagnant you know we in in today's world it's really good to have something stable you want a stable you want a stable you want stable finances you want a stable relationship you want a stable family you want to stable this or you want a stable car you want a stable job and and that's okay to have something that's stable but but god doesn't want us just to come and just be repetitive and just come and sit in a pew and sit in a pew and stay in the same position with god he wants us to move further is that right paul says this is a race that we must win and we've got to run all the way through to the finish line is that right so i want to look here at ruth just just for a few moments and just kind of like kind of lay a foundation and last night i was laying in bed and i actually preached on this about four about two or three years ago and i just couldn't get away from those four lepers that set at the gate and and so just kind of want to go back through this if i can and pray it's a blessing to someone i i don't know who it's for but maybe it's for me tonight but i pray god will speak to us but and so ruth 1 and verse 6 and and if you've already heard this i'm sorry but maybe you need to hear it again amen then she arose with her daughters-in-law that she might return from the country of moab for she had heard in the country of moab how the lord had visited his people and giving them bread now we know the story of ruth we know the story of orpah and we know the story of naomi and how her husbands had died her sons had died and she was there now widowed with her two widowed daughter-in-laws and we see that she had heard that back in her hometown or back in her homeland the lord had visited the people giving them bread and verse seven wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was her two daughters-in-law with her and they went out of the way to return unto the land of judah so we see they're all headed in the same place they're following this message of naomi because the orba and ruth had never been to this land but they were following the message of naomi at this time and naomi said under her two daughters-in-law go return each to her mother's house and the lord dealt kindly with you as you have dealt with the dead and with me and the lord grant you that you may find rest each of you in the house of her husband then she kissed them and lifted up her voice and wept so she's giving him her blessing to stay she's saying the lord grant you a husband here he'll grant you rest why don't you just stay and i'll go back to my homeland this is where i'm called to be and and so you know and they said unto her surely we will return with thee unto thy people and they wanted to you know you can see that they had a desire in her heart you know naomi had him put an impression on them that they wanted to see where where naomi had come from they had an impression from her that they wanted to go to where naomi was going nomi said again turn again my daughters why will thou go with me she said are there yet any more sons in my womb that yet that they may be your husbands she said turn again my daughters and go your way for i am too old to have a husband if i should say i have hope if i should find a husband also tonight and should bear sons would you tarry for them until they were grown would you stay for them from having husbands she said name my daughters if you agree with me much for your sakes at the hand of the lord has gone out against me so and and you go on down to verse 14 and you see that they lifted up their voice and wept again and orbit kissed her mother-in-law but ruth clave unto her so we see that orpha had something she but she but she couldn't go just all the way is that right she she could have she she hung on for as long as she could but when it got really difficult when it got down to the challenging time she just couldn't do it and she had to go back is that right but but ruth claven to her because ruth had a desire to see where naomi had come from she had a desire to see this message that naomi was talking about the bread and the homeland she wanted to get to that she said behold thy sister-in-law has gone back under her people and under her gods return thou after thy sister in law and ruth said entreat me not to leave thee nor to return from following after thee for whither thou goest i will go and where thou love just i will lodge thy people shall be my people and thy god be my god or thou diest will i die and there will i be buried and lord do so to me and more also if ought but death part thee and me and you see as a christian all each of us have to come to this point where there's no turning back is that right when we get to a point where we say it doesn't matter how many times i've failed doesn't matter how many times i falter it doesn't matter what people say about me i'm going through to the end is that right and as christians and believers of like precious faith we've got to come to that point doesn't matter who falls away who turns away what comes against us we're going through to the end is that right amen you love the lord this evening as christians we've got to come to a a a mindset and a stability in our lives that says hey no fathered mother friend anybody desert us we will go through to the end because it's christ that is leading us through to the end it's not we're not worried about what this one does or what that one does but it's christ is our hope of glory is that right now brother branham says in the ephesian church ages in the exposition of the seven church ages he says and now these sons of god he said whom by him overcome are given the privilege of the paradise of god the constant fellowship with jesus christ he said there will never be any more separation from him are you looking forward to that day he says whether he goes his bride will go i want you to know where christ leads you the bride will follow is that right you know some men say he's here he's there but where the word is that's where the eagles will be gathered is that right he said his bride will go he says what is it he shares with his beloved on a joint air relationship and i i love that we did nothing to deserve it but there's a joint heir relationship that everything christ died for everything that he was entitled to you and i now have is that right when jen and i got married you know everything that i had which wasn't very much she got and everything she had i got is that right and so we see when you come into a relationship with christ all the redemptive blessings that he was entitled to you are now entitled to and he says the secret things will be revealed the dark things will be made plain we shall know as we are known and he says we shall be like him he said this is the heritage of the overcomer who was overcome by the blood of the lamb and the word of the testimony to jesus christ i love how brother ben he talked about that you know it's not you know we overcome by the blood of the lamb and the word of our testimony it's not the blood of the lamb that's going to fail it's going to be the word of our testimony is that right so we have to make sure that word of our testimony stays true he says how we long for the day when the crooked roads will be made straight and we'll be with him in time without end he said may that day hasten he said it its appearance and we may hasten to obey the word of god to thereby prove our worthiness to share his glory and i love that that sentence there let us hasten to obey his word i mean you know it's it's not it's not the something that you would say norman ordinarily but you know if we were to pray you know god hey you know make me make my desire to obey your word make it make it something that's important in my life that when i wake up that's what i want to think about is obeying your word he said and prove our worthiness to share his glory he says he that hath an ear let him hear this what the spirit says unto the churches he said how tragic is it the first age did not listen to the spirit instead it listened to man he said but thank god in the last age there will be a group rise up the true bride in the last day and she will listen to the spirit in the day of gross darkness in the light he said the light will return by the pure word and we will return to the power of pentecost and welcome back the lord jesus christ i believe we're living in that day do you believe that you know matt no matter what the word says or what the world says or what what denominations say or mainstream media or mainstream religion amen we still serve a living god is that right you know you see nowadays everybody's changing changing the scripture to fit their religion but brother brahm says we ought to change ourselves to fit the scripture is that right we don't come into this relationship and say i'm going to change the word of god to fit my lifestyle but god changed my lifestyle to fit your word is that right amen it doesn't matter what the baptist preached the pentecostal preached the methodist preacher it doesn't matter what the message people preach if it doesn't align with the word of god it's in error is that right it's wrong it doesn't matter what gods they say they serve it doesn't matter what what what religion they believe but if if you believe in god you believe in the word he's going to remain your god until the end is that right amen i heard a song the other day and that's what i was really studying on and wanting to preach on it was called still my god and so you see in in today's time they've taken god they've watered them down they've changed the scripture they they they don't live according to the bible but but i want you to know that he's still my god is that right so what he said in the beginning the way he was the alpha and omega that's the god that i still believe in amen and when god has selected you it doesn't matter who else has rejected you god's favor outweighs all opposition so we see that ruth she had faith to believe in what she was doing she wasn't going to turn back is that right you look at jacob in the scripture and i love it you know he wasn't changed when he was wrestling but he was changed when he was touched amen he had wrestled all night and nothing had happened but that one touch come and it changed his life forever you can wrestle you can fight you can try to do good enough you can try to do this you can try to do that but until god comes down and touches you with that holy touch you will not make it through to the end ruth 1-18 when she saw that she was steadfastly minded to go with her she left then speaking unto her see she was looking for she was trying to get ruth to say she was trying to shake her off she was trying to get her to stay in her homeland but when she finally realized that she was steadfastly going she would just finally give up and said come with me and i believe as christians that's the way we ought to be the scripture says every child every son and daughter of god that comes to god must be tried and must be chastened and i believe as christians we ought not to to look at that and say it's it's you know it's it's the devil ganging up on us or god doesn't care about us it's god trying as children amen and i i nobody wants to pray for patience nobody wants to pray for trials or tribulations but that's the only way god can perfect the gold amen we see that ruth loved naomi but we see they would have been in the same condition in bethlehem as they were in mohab moab without boaz is that right the reason they were going was to get boaz they weren't going into land for bread but there was a kinsmen redeemer that was there you don't just come to church for the gifts of the spirit or the anointing or this or that but you go because you have a desire to meet christ is that right amen i don't know about you but i'm not going to heaven just to get to heaven or live eternal life but i want to meet the bridegroom is that right there's a love connection there's a deep call it to the deep now i've mentioned this many times before but there's a there's a a a terminology in in aviation where it's called the point of no return it's often returned to referred to as by pilots as the radius of action formula i've mentioned this many times but what it is is once a plane has left an airfield due to fuel consumption the plane is no longer capable of returning to the airfield it took off from so we see that it's reached a point of no return it means it can't go back if it wanted to it has to move forward and i believe as christians today you know the holy ghost has sealed us until the day of our redemption it's not that god is just enough to get us there he's more than enough to see us through but as christians we've reached a point of no return when you're still with the holy ghost there's no turning back it's you only look to the finish line and you have to make it to the finish line it's a desire in every believer's heart amen so we see this point of no return i don't know about you but i've reached that point of no return it doesn't matter what happens doesn't matter what comes up against me doesn't matter if i fall tomorrow i'll get back up and keep pressing the battle amen satan can try to throw his punches but i believe if we put on the full armor of god god will protect us so and we go to john chapter 6 and verse 67 i know i'm skipping around but i'm laying a foundation here then jesus said unto the 12 will ye also go away and i love this simon peter answered and said lord lord to whom shall we go thou hast the words of eternal life and i know as christians once you find those words of eternal life nothing else will satisfy you can try to go back to the baptist you can try to go back to the pentecost but once you've met the unadulterated word of god nothing else will suffice until unless you have that john 6 and 69 he says we believe and are sure that thou art the christ the son of the living god how many of you are sure tonight that you've met christ the son of the living god i believe as christians it's not it's not a it's not maybe a a thing that we have to do but but we've got to come to a point in our life where we've got to drive a stake down and say that no matter what comes my way i'm going to go with the lord now many times in our life we may not be able to put down a specific date or a specific time and but there's always a tie post that we can go back to is that right there's a time that we know that god changed something in our lives and i don't know about you my change when you know when i was filled with the holy ghost yes it was it was it was an indwelling of the holy ghost but i didn't become perfect the next day it wasn't something that just everything fixed and everything was a flower bed of ease but it was a challenge from then on to live the christian life is that right god began to work on me things begin to fall away and then and i begin to begin to learn more in the word and it's it's it's a it's a journey that you go through with christ is that right now brother branham says he says what is sin he says simply he said it's one word it says unbelief he said there are two elements that control the human being and that's either doubt or faith he says one or the other he said you're possessed by one that dominates your life he said it just depends on how much faith you got to how high you can rise so we've seen that no matter how bad the world gets we know the bride is rising is that right she's on her way out now i love that and i i i i love to study on faith and it's one of my favorite topics and and and i believe it it works just as much in the natural as it does in the spiritual i believe if you have faith god will meet his word is that right that's one thing i'm very sure on i know many times i've asked god to do something and i stood on that word and god come and did it is that right so we see you know i i did a test one time and i think i've told you all this here before but i want you to maybe this week go up to somebody and tell them just tell them you had the best week just say i had the best week and then say except for wednesday now the first question most people try this out i've done it to about 10 to 20 people and every time no one's going to ask you why monday sunday tuesday thursday friday and saturday we're good they're going to say why was wednesday bad guarantee it ask ask 9 out of 10 people will say well what happened wednesday we're naturally you know we're naturally negative we're naturally drawn to ask what's wrong right and instead of what's right and so i've been just working for years trying to change my mindset to ask the positive and there's some people who want you to ask the negative i'll have people come up to you and just say i'm like how are you doing good accept and then there's a long list of things of except behind it and people like to be baby people like to be pampered people like to be patted on the back no matter how good or bad you are you like a little uh you like a little accolades you like to be patted on the back but i promise you if we could get our mindset to quit focusing on the negative and focus on the positive god could work a lot more in our lives is that right when we begin to we begin to take doubt and we begin to put it aside and replace it with faith there's no way but god to have a greater outcome in our life you know it's almost like math you know you take one plus one equals two right you start adding more numbers to it more numbers to it it's going to get greater now that's the thing about people everybody thinks you got to do the same thing as somebody else that's not the way it works you know that was sister how do you see that so many people have tried the same thing that she did is that right so many people tried the same exact formula saying the exact same words that she did but that doesn't always work for everybody right five plus four equals nine but so does six plus three right there's different things for different people there's different faith each of us are given a different measure of faith and it may take this person you know i can't say i can't go to my wife and say well why can't you believe this it's so easy for me to believe and she can't come to me and say why don't you see this it's so easy for me to see everybody learns at their own pace everybody has a measure of faith that's attributed to them and you've got to you can't force your amount on them they've got to come to it themselves is that right but one thing that i know for sure we've all been given different measures but when we get doubt out of the way when we get unbelief out of the way and faith begins to step in great miracles can happen in your life and so we look here and i'd like to go to second kings now if we could and remember brother branham says what is sin and just always remember they said it's unbelief he said there's only two elements that controls the human being that's either doubt or faith one or the other you're possessed of one that dominates your life now that's words from a prophet so you're either you're either dominated by doubt or you're dominated by faith it just depends on how much faith you have as to how high you will fly now you got to take that what he says right there it doesn't mean you need more measure of faith it means you need to get rid of the doubt is that right we've all been given a specific measure of faith now the satan will give you as much doubt as you want satan will give you as much negativity as you want if you look at anything in the news anything in the media the only thing that sells is fear is that right that's the only thing if it's not fearful if it's not bad news nobody wants to put it out everybody's going to go through and click the bad news the bad news the bad news nobody's going to click you know man saves child from falling off cliff they're going to pick you know officer shot officer did this or you know race they're going to do all this anything that's negative that's what they're going to sell but as christians we ought to get rid of that doubt and replace it with faith is that right now that's not something that you can just say and leave here tonight and just tomorrow just this you can move mountains that's not the way it is but god will work it through you he's working to perfect his saints is that right so it's the it's day by day its footsteps are possessions it's each day you get closer to the promised land you know when the children of israel got to the promised land there was only a few that were actually ready to go over and that was joshua and caleb the rest had not reached that level of faith is that right and you know your husband your wife your son your daughter your family member may not be at the level of faith you are that doesn't mean they're any lower than you or any worse off than you as long as they're trying to get to the finish line that's the main thing second kings verse seven and three and i just love this story because i think it just play it it typifies every christian life and and every christian situation and there were four leperous men at the entering of the gate and they said one another why sit here until we die and i think as christians you've got to come to a point where you're not happy with your current state is that right he said now notice these men were at a gate they weren't in or out they were at the gate they were in the city or out of the city they were right in the gate they were a decision place is that right and the leper said if we say we will enter the city then the famine is in the city and we shall die there so they say if we go this way we're going to die right so then they look at one another they say well if we sit here we die also so it's pretty gloomy looking stuff you know if we go into the city we're gonna die if we stay here we're gonna die and many people that you know tonight if you look at your own life and and you look well if i do this death is down that road if i stay stagnant where i'm at if i don't want to go any further with god you will die right there in your pew he says now therefore come and let us fall into the host of the syrians if they save us alive we shall live if they kill us we shall but die so the syrians had had besieged the city and we see that inside the city if you read the scripture they were actually they were actually eating children and and doing all these horrible things that they were they were doing just because they were starving to death and so we see that they looked in there and they said there's nothing but death there if we stay here there's nothing but death here and so they said well let's go to the syrians if they save us alive maybe they'll feel bad for us give us some food they'll save us alive and we can live but if they kill us we're going to die anyways right and i believe as christians we've kind of got to come to that point where like if i stand you've got to come to a realization that if i stay in this current condition i'm going to die and now i'm not saying your soul is going to be lost i'm not going to say any of that but but i want you to look at your life and say you know if i continue with all this doubt you know you know as as i look and as i begin to study faith and and study doubt and the negative effects that that stress has on the body and and you know you begin to look at faith and you begin to wonder why wouldn't we just choose happiness right but but how often are we torn with choosing the negative side choosing the sadness choosing the bad way you know if you're you're my your mind begins to wonder and you get angry and then all sudden you're angry over something that has never happened you create a scenario in your head that has never happened you get mad about it and that puts stress on the body stress on the mind so we see if we stay in this current condition we're going to die if we go back into the city where there's more death if we go back out into the world where there's more death we're going to die there as well but we could go and fight the enemy and there's a chance that if we go to the enemy and we go to the enemy's camp we're either going to get back what they took from us or we're going to die i don't know about you but if i'm given the option to just sit here and die go somewhere and die or fight for a chance i'm going to take that chance every time man what a position to be in but we see that gideon was in a similar position is that right and i'm just going to go to the story just to get in just for a few moments but we've seen the the the that israel had been besieged by the midianites and and we see that in judges six and three and so it was when israel had sown and i love that when they were in the time that they had sown they had planted they had they had um as you hear the scripture says you reap what you sow well israel had sown and they were going to reap the fruits of their labor is that right but the enemy you look at anything that you do in your life the enemy comes in after you've done all the work that's the way the enemy likes to do you do all the work that any enemy likes to come in and take still kill and destroy is that right now that the midianites came up and the amla kites and the children of the east even come up against them and they encamped against them and destroyed the increase of the earth he says till thou come to gaza and left no sustenance for israel neither sheep nor ox nor ass for they came up with their cattle and their tents and they come as grasshoppers for the multitude for both they and their camels were without numbered and they entered into the land for what purpose to destroy it and the israel was greatly impoverished because of the midianites and the children of israel cried unto the lord and so we see that when they begin to cry to the lord we know obviously god goes and speaks to gideon but notice that these people they entered the land for one purpose and that was to destroy it and that's the way the devil is he likes to come in a little bit at a time but when you let him in he's only there for one purpose and that's to destroy it and i'm going to go ahead and tell you if you allow doubt to come into your life the only purpose that's there for is destroy your faith you're controlled by two things faith or doubt and depends on which one you choose to serve as brother branhammy talks about the black dog and the white dog whichever one you feed the most that's whichever one is going to rule you is that right do you love the lord this evening amen so we see that when israel had sown the many nights come up against them and we see that god began to raise up gideon is that right and he come to a point and gideon was very nervous he you know he didn't want to do what god was asking him to do so he wanted a sign then he wanted a sign but god said hey tear down the altar of bell cut down the trees of the grove and he said and said i will bless you and play a place of sacrifice unto god and so we see that that's what gideon does and and you know then gideon all of a sudden gets with god and he begins to get at this great army to go down and god says this is too many so he begins to lower the number then he gets down to ten thousand god says this is still too many and these were ten thousand people who wanted to fight you know at the first he said hey there's a bunch of you who don't want to be here if you're afraid if you're feel full go back to your house ten thousand were left that said hey i want to fight and then god comes out he says only the ones who drink this certain way only ones who come to the water this certain way that's the one that's going to fight it comes down to 300 men and we see that what god does is a miracle because god didn't want to share his glory with anyone is that right i want you to know no matter what happens in my life no matter how good god's blessed me i want you to know it's only because of him that i'm blessed is that right the minute we begin to think highly of ourselves that's the minute god's going to have to take us down a notch because the only reason that you and i are in any position that we're in is because god allowed us to be in that position amen amen if you've got a lot of money if you've got a lot of health in your life there's only one reason that you have that it's because god allowed you to have it amen and you ought to be thankful to him not in day that he allowed you to be in that position so we see in second kings 7 5 and they rose up at the twilight to go into the camp of the syrians and when they come to the uttermost part of the campus syria and behold there was no man there he said verse 6 says for the lord had made the host of the syrians to hear a noise of chariots and the noise of horses and even a noise of a great host and they said one another lo the king of israel hath hired against us the kings of the hittites and the egyptians to come upon us wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight and left their tents and their horses their asses and the campus as it was as they fled for their life so we see the story of the four lepers brother branham calls it dingy faith he says they took their dingy faith and destroyed an entire army and the camp was left as it was now you see if if christians if you can take that little amount of faith imagine what you can do in your life if you say i'm going to take this faith and i'm going to see what god can do amen i promise you you won't be disappointed is that right if you can get rid of the doubt if you can get rid of the fear and let god come in he can do something great in your life do you believe that when god makes the way he makes a way he didn't just say four lepers were coming but he made it to sound like an army was coming when god's before you there ain't nobody can be against you let me just remind you of that if god be with you ain't nobody gonna stand in your way we're not waiting on a prophet to come back to tell us what it what what us to do the message has already come it's told us what to do it's told us how to live what we to do now believe in it and live it is that right it was to bring out a bride but what are we doing with it are we the bride being called out are we just are we just enjoying coming to church and doing this and doing that are we actually living to our full potential amen do you love the lord this evening amen i love the word of the lord i love the word of the lord i love faith i love i love healing i love seeing those miracles take place and i believe if you believe god he'll do those things in your life is that right there's many times in my life i've asked god to do something for me and he's done it you believe that brother brethren says in perseverance in 62 he said if you're sick he said why sit here he says that the leper said that day and the city was besieged why sit here until we die and i think that's the problem with most people they would just rather sit there and die than fight i don't know about you but as a christian you've got to fight in spirit is that right we've got a spirit of the lord that that whenever the enemy comes up against us we're not just going to lay down and die we're going to fight back is that right amen and i love the scripture when you're too tired to fight god will fight your battles do you believe that when samaria was besieged by the syrians and they said we sit here till we die we'll always be here we'll die right here if we go into the city they're dying for starvation let's go down to the camp of the enemy he says oh my what a poor he said what little faith they could have he said they go to the camp of the enemy who's trying to kill them but said if we die we're going to die anyhow he said so if we save we'll get our life saved he says why we'll do well and they went down and god honored that and here's where brother man says that little speck of dingy faith and i love that when and i want to make this point very clear when god says that we're given a measure of faith in the scripture we're given a measure of faith we don't know how much that measure is but i do know one thing that any amount of measure of faith will defeat any amount of doubt that the devil has amen and this story perfectly proves that they had little speck of dingy faith like the littlest speck you could find that's how much they had and it defeated all the doubt that there was that the enemy could throw at him so i want you to know if you only got a little speck and a little bit of dingy faith it will defeat no of any amount of doubt that the devil can put into your life amen and not only delivered them but they delivered all of israel is that right amen you begin to get delivered yourself then you see it take place in your house you see it take place in your church brother branham says it only takes one person to set a church on fire and he says what we need today is a man and a woman who will take god at his word and be persistent with him and that doesn't mean well i asked god for this and it didn't happen ask him again ask him again ask him until it comes to comes to pass is that right you've got to come to the point that no matter if it comes to pass or not you ask god for it you've got to believe that it's going to happen amen do you love the lord this evening amen so we see that god wants people to be persistent reach out and take it the lepers walked to the camp they were crawling they were limping but god made a way and they believed and it was and it took place i don't care if you you say well i can't sing i can't pray i can't do this i can't do that ask god and let faith begin to rule in your life and see what god can do brother branham says god will cause earthquakes and the shakes to go down to the camp first so it's not you that's doing anything anyways it's what god's sending before you is that right amen the christian prayer shakes all of hell is that right i believe brother branham said the most powerful weapon that a christian has is prayer do you believe that and i skipped down the quote a little bit he says look up here what did his promise he said say how can it be done god said so he said that settles and it goes back to the very beginning what did brother branham say the foundation was for a christian belief in the word of god so if you believe in the word of god when you say god said so you know it will come to pass he says that settles it when god said it that settles it it's eternally settled in for in heaven forever he said his word is and his word was made flesh in his flesh today he says if in you if you'll let it come flesh and i love that it's it's all good when jesus was made flesh when he was the word made flesh but now the word has been made flesh in this day and it's in you is that right it was okay to say that god could do this or jesus could do this but when he said the word is nigh thee even in your lips it changed the scenario that you had the power is that right he said if you abide in me and my words and you then ask what you will and it will be done he said that's in saint john 15 he says see just let them words stay here he says believe it it's truth it's a seed and it'll bring to pass everything that he promised and i love that how the word of god is a seed you know what's funny about a seed you plant it and it doesn't automatically come up overnight me and my wife have been killing plants since the day we got married for the first time we've been married 10 years now we have plants that are living it took us a while to figure out how to nurture the seed right so i'm not expecting everybody to leave church here tonight and just get rid of all the doubt and all the faith come in and go move mountains i don't expect that to happen it didn't happen with me if it happens for you great by all means go do it right but a seed has to be watered it has to be nurtured you have to put it in the right soil you have to do the right things for it it can have a certain amount of sunlight it needs shade a certain amount of time you can't just set it out on your porch water it once a day and expect it to grow right me and jenna found that out the hard way haven't we we finally got four plants we're so proud of them you know they've been alive for a couple months now it's awesome right well that's the way it is with faith one thing begins to add and one thing adds to another and then it adds to another and then all of a sudden you realize that that negative spirit you used to have that doubt that you used to have is dwindling away and one day you just wake up and you realize you're happy or your faith is better you're you're more happy to read in the word of god you're happy to hear the word of god you're happy to sing the songs of god do you believe that he said believe it it's the truth he said it's a seed it'll bring to pass everything that he's promised so we see the enemy had their food it had their water he said but they went to the enemy's camp and took back what they stole you see the enemy everything that he possesses that he took from you he's a thief is that right and that that item that he stole still belongs to if he stole your health if he stole your joy if he stole your victory if he's still in your family go back and take it from him amen it is your right as a son and daughter of god to take back anything the devil has stole from you he said their situation was terrible but god made a way and he says when you're desperate with god god will show up on the scene you believe that amen now the lepers they were in the right place they were in the camp of the lord they were in church but everything around them was falling apart i want you to know they were in the right place they were with israel they were the camp of the lord but everything around them was falling away there was death here death there but they had enough faith to go back and take what the devil had stole from them john 14 6 jesus saith unto him i'm the way the truth and the life and no man cometh unto the father but by me i want you to know tonight it's not by your works it's not by your ability to preach not by your ability to sing but it's by god that you are it's by jesus christ you're allowed to enter into the presence of the father is that right 2 corinthians 5 7 we walk by faith and not by sight it may not look good but keep walking is that right you may not feel it the first day but keep walking i love the story of jericho they didn't fall on the first day didn't fall on the second day but they kept walking is that right they kept marching and kept marching and what happened it eventually fell is that right brother branham says in the statue of a perfect man he says notice you must be born again and when you're born again you can't be born again without having faith he said that's right so you see on my chart here he said i got the very foundation faith is the foundation of all of it for without faith it is impossible to please god he that cometh to god must believe that he is and a rewarder of those that diligently seek him i don't know about you but if there's ever a time i want to seek god it's right now that i diligently seek the lord it's in this day that we need to be seeking him more than we're seeking favoritism more than we're seeking political favors but it's we've got to be seeking him and and seeking that rapture as much as we can amen i think that's it ought to be in every christian's life is to prepare for a rapture never in my life have i seen so many nominal christians talking about the rapture they see what's going on in the world and they see the signs of the time and i have people just talking about the rapture all the time it's about to happen it's about to happen but as the bride of jesus christ the one that benefits from the rapture how much more are we to be ready for that rapture to take place mark 5 and verse 22 and behold there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue jerius by name and when he saw him he fell at his feet and he besought him greatly saying my little daughter lies at the point of death pray thee come and lay thy hands on her that she may be healed and she shall live amen i don't know how i have time to go through all this but we see that jerry has had to come down to a decision to put his faith into motion is that right he had to ask is that right and i don't know about you but you know and one thing that i've learned is if you don't ask the answer is always no and i have taught my kids that to a fault because they will just continuously ask for everything and anything because if you don't ask the answer is always no but there's a 50 50 chance the answer could be yes that's one thing i've learned in in in my career if i don't ask for the loans or i don't ask for the deposit guess what the answer is 100 no but if i ask i have a 50 chance that i'm gonna get it and so i've learned that if you don't ask there's not a chance now whose fault is it if you don't ask yours right well god's busy no it's impossible well i'm not that important listen so here's one thing that's always amazed me as christians how unimportant we feel but god chose us for the toughest age is that right and you know it doesn't matter who chooses you it doesn't matter if man has disregarded you or man has done this but if god chose you to be chosen by god do we understand how privileged we really are that god come down and said i choose alan price in this day that i come down and i choose this one in this day it's amazing to me that how satan can come in and make us feel little when god values our life very very much so much that he sent his own son to die that you and i might have life is that right so don't let the devil ever convince you that you're not important enough you're not good enough god sees you as important god values your life god knows that you are important to him he knows that that maybe the world is turned against you but i want you to know god knows that what you're going through god knows the situation that you are currently in and god cares tonight i think it's a trick of the enemy that you would ever think that god doesn't care let me tell you something god cares for his children amen it's one thing i maybe learned as becoming a dad i care about what my children go through and that's one thing the father does he cares about his children amen amen do you love the lord i don't know where i was at but anyways you get the point god cares about you tonight if you're sitting here tonight and you think god doesn't care if i can tell you one thing you leave with know that god cares amen so we see here that brother branham says he was a water of those that diligently seek him now let's see now jerius he had to put his faith into action is that right now my kids love candy and if they don't ask there's no chance they're going to get the candy but if they ask there's a 50 50 chance they're going to get a candy right so what do they do they ask now as believers now brother branham says there's no such thing as an unanswered prayer is that right but there's sometimes god doesn't give you what you asked for because it's not what you needed is that right now my kids don't ask for vegetables ever they don't say dad give me give me a multivitamin some broccoli it's really what my body's craving no give me chocolate give me sugar that's what i want even as a little baby you just you take a little bit of sweet tea or you know take a little bit of chocolate pudding and put her mouth it's like cocaine they just go crazy right they just they can't help it it's just it's got these endorphins in it they're just releasing your brain and they just love it and they learn to ask and as christians i don't know what a what point or what happened in our life or what happened in our mind that doubt got so big that we just felt like we couldn't ask anymore now i want you to just listen to this i've read this quote many times but it's brother branham he's talking uh brother branham is preaching a service and he's talking about god watching over the three hebrew children shadrach meshach and abednego and the angels are coming up wanting to go down gabriel comes up and he just dramatizes us out wormwood comes up and and they're they're all asking him have you considered them he said yes all night i've been watching him he says brother his eyes on the sparrow he i know he watches me and he's watching you he said he's just seeing how much faith you got he says how much faith do you have he says he wants to see what kind of stand you'll take the hour has come what are you going to do he said i've watched them all night i heard every prayer they prayed he says you angels have been good angels but i can't let you go for i'm going myself so we see that your faith will bring him on the scene do you believe that now we see that you've got to have faith in the word of god that is our foundation is that right amen do you love the lord amen there's no way i'm going to get through this so i'm going to speed it up a little bit but amen so we see that your faith will bring jesus on the scene is that right now let's see here in jesus matthew 5 and verse 24 and jesus went with him and much people followed him and thronged him and there was a certain woman who had an issue of blood 12 years now that's a long time to have an issue right you know if i have a headache for more than five minutes i'm looking for tylenol right i don't like being sick i don't like having a headache if there's something that can cure it if the lord doesn't heal me i'm gonna go find something is that right now she had suffered many things from many physicians that had spent all she had and was nothing better but rather grew worse so she had tried everything she had tried worldly things she had tried medicine she had tried this she'd tried that no doubt she'd been prayed for before but when she heard that of jesus came in the press behind and touched his garment for she said if i may touch his clothes i shall be whole now she didn't have a scripture for that but she had faith is that right she didn't have a scripture said if you touch the hem of his garment she'll be healed but she had faith to believe that if she did it it would come to pass and straightway the fountain of blood was dried up and she felt in her body that she was healed of the plague she refused to sit there and die is that right and i think as christians you've got to come to that point in your life to say i've lived with this long enough i've lived with this tribulation i've lived with this trial long enough i'm going to do something about it and there's one place that you can go whenever you have a need and that's to jesus is that right if you can but touch the hymn of his garment he will make you whole she put her faith into motion and you've seen what happened in jesus immediately knowing of himself that virtue had gone out turned by the press and said who touched my clothes and his disciples said unto him thou seest the multitude throng of thee and thou sayest who touched me and he looked round about to see her that had done this thing but the woman fearing and trembling knowing what was done in her came and fell down before him and told him all the truth and he said unto her daughter thy faith hath made thee whole he didn't say i healed you he said thy faith has made thee whole is that right go in peace and thou shalt be whole of the plague she believed what she was asking for and she received the blessing is that right just like the lepers she knew that if she stayed there she would die but if she if she was going to take a chance take a chance on jesus is that right she needed that spiritual food and she knew that god would make a way and we see that while yet spake there came rulers of the synagogue how certain say thy daughter is dead and i'm going back to jerius i'm sorry why trouble is thou the master any further and so we see that jerry said come to jesus when his daughter was sick but now she's dead right all hope is gone but i want you to know what jesus anything can happen right anything is possible is that right now to our human finite mind we not may not be able to comprehend it but this right here tells you that anything with jesus is possible he says with me all things are possible is that right and you see satan is probably sitting on jerius's shoulder at this time tell him hey it's too late there's nothing you can do sit here and die but jesus i love this as soon as jesus heard the word that was spoken now watch jesus he had the fullness of faith is that right fullness of the godhead bodily he had what we have in measure he had in fullness he said he hath said unto the ruler the synagogue be not afraid only believe i love how jesus shuts up the enemy as soon as they start talking as soon as the enemy said this and as soon as jesus heard what was spoken he said unto the ruler be not afraid only believe and i think if there's anything that you and i can learn from this tonight is cast out fear is that right brother brahm says fear is it it's false it doesn't mean it's going to happen it's fake it's the tool of the enemy is that right you've got to get rid of fear and replace it with faith is that right the word of god will shut the mouth of the enemy every time brother branham says in the eagles story of the burness he said if you sit where you are your sickness he said the doctors will give up on you and you'll die he said that's all you cannot lose by trusting god right you cannot lose by trusting god he said if you're asked to go down to the camp of the enemy he said but you're invited to the house of god he says what are you waiting for there's no losing i don't know about you but i like to be on the winning team occasionally he said there's only one way that you can lose sit still and don't act on it i'm here to tell you you have every right as a son and daughter of god you know brother branham talks about the power and authority he talks about the police officer he doesn't have the power or the capability to stop the car but he has the authority is that right is that right as sons and daughters of god you may not have the power to defeat cancer or defeat this or defeat that but you have the authority as a son and daughter of god to and act on that power brother rem says there's no losing he says there's only one way you can lose and that's to sit still and don't act on it and i don't know about you but i feel sorry for anybody that's just gonna lay down and defeat i don't know about you but i will go kicking and screaming if i'm gonna fight i'm gonna go down to the bitter end is that right he said how many says that's true say amen he said there's one thing god cannot do he says yes there's one thing god cannot do he cannot fail he said that's one thing he can't do he cannot fail he wins every time because he's god he said heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall never fail he says is that right so we see that when we put our foundation our faith in the word of god that's one thing that god said will never pass away heavens and earth will be destroyed burn over with fire but his word will last forever so believe he says you must have it the same way tonight a quick decision choose you this day whom you'll serve and take god at his word i don't know about you but when you take god's word he'll prove it to you is that right amen do you love the lord the word's been preached the signs have been done the holy ghost is here this time he said the hour has come for a decision made amongst the people he said what more can god do and i asked you that today what more proof do you need that god is real in this day then what he's already shown you if you need more proof i don't know why you would need more proof he has made himself known down through all the ages down through history in your own life personally you know that god is real you'll believe and take him at his word he said what more can god do he said he sent it down with signs and wonders discernment proved it scientifically put it on a picture and sent it across the world he said thousands of thousands are witnessing others are being healed what about you i don't know about you but if somebody's getting blessed i want to be right up there with them right they're giving away free money i'm going to be in line if they're giving away free blessings i'm going to be in line if they're giving away healing even if i don't need healing i want healing there's always something i found out the older i get the more i hurt the more i ache i just wake up and i'm just in pain i don't understand it but i'm just in pain but that comes with age the body is dying from the day we're born is that right so there's always something god can do for you why don't you put him in take him at his word so he said others are being healed what about you he says they arose in the middle of the night and started down walking towards faith the host of the syrian he says and i love this what an attack planned by god you know i've always loved looking at the scripture because you know one of my one of the things that i really like to do is use services and young people and maybe i don't do that a lot but it's one of my favorite things to do because i really just you know i i enjoy the youth and not that i have nothing against you people but there's just something about it i just like it right that maybe that's where my ministry is called that's why i'm not good at preaching to everybody else but so we see what an attack plan by god and i love to look at how god chooses people in the scripture because when i see how he chooses people in the scripture i'm like now i get why he chose me so god is going to take down the host of the syrians right and he comes down and you know you know when you're in school you were picking teams and you always picked the good kids first right the bad kids got picked last i love how god comes down he's like well how am i going to defeat this host of the syrians that are without number and they got camels grasshoppers you know people are eating kids in the city i mean it's a bad situation and he comes down he's like well i'm not going to pick the army i'm going to pick lepers right like you know the angels got to be standing there like i'd probably pick you know the general or the captain or the king but if you want lepers that's fine right i mean if you want lepers to fight your battle fine go ahead you know he comes down and he's going to destroy jericho but he's going to save one person and well let's save a harlot right right it's comical you're kind of chuckling but he says well i'm going to go to an entire city where are you going to go i'm going to go to the woman that's been married five times and living with someone that's not her husband don't you want to go talk to the ministry or go to the synagogue talk to the priest right who does god choose oh we're going to go across we're going to go across the sea there's a man tied up in the graveyard in chains i need to talk to him all right look down all through the scripture gideon was a nobody all right i'm gonna choose a king for israel i'm gonna pick the smallest child that jesse has right i'm gonna pick the worst one that he has i'm gonna go with it oh i'm gonna deliver all of israel i'm gonna pick someone who murdered egyptians fled to the desert and can't talk good all right right so the thing that really shows to me is god don't need you to do anything you need him to do everything so when you see your question why did god choose me it's not about you and i it's about allowing submitting ourselves so that god can come and work through us in this day do you believe that when god before us who can be against us it doesn't matter what your past look like what your present look like if god's with you your future is going to look pretty good amen if you can completely surrender yourself to god submit yourself to the word god can do great things through a harlot through this one through that one through someone who cannot speak he can do great things if you'll submit yourself to him and take out fear take out doubt and replace it with faith he said he says what an attack planned by god he said satan had to be really confused right he's standing there at the host of syria just laughing at what's happened to israel he sees four lepers coming he's got to be chuckling a little bit right but then all of a sudden he starts to see the syrians running running fleeing because why god put a host a sound in the air he put a voice before the lepers to run them out before they ever showed up so we see that god had confused them he says he said i won't use ministers i won't use the prophet of elisha at the time he said i won't use the king but i'm going to use lepers and i love that god honored their faith not their position in the church not their abilities not their financial status not their size but he honored their faith i don't care how good you are how bad you are if you got faith god can see you through to the end amen do you love the lord amen he said he caused a great storm to come on the desert and roar and run all the syrians away he says they went right on in and got plenty to eat got some wine and got happy if you read the story they got in there and they got a little excited they got a little drunk on the y they were excited i think sometimes if you would get if you would really figure out how big god is and how much he's on your side you'd get a little excited too amen they got plenty to eat i'm gonna lose my voice but it'd be all right god will see us through to the end amen it's god's clock telling me to power down he said there's a lot of sick people here with heart trouble a lot of tubercular and he says a lot bound in chairs he says why don't you tonight he says why would you sit there till you die the hour has come to make a decision and i say that tonight for spiritual sickness the time has come for you to make a decision are you going to choose fear are you going to choose faith amen it's time to make a decision it's time to put your faith into motion he says and brother he says and faith now does the rest of it faith does the rest he says so you must have faith for a foundation all christianity all you are and all you will ever be is based upon faith in the word that's the reason i believe the word see he says all christianity all you are and all you will ever be is based upon the faith in the word he said that's the reason i believe the word he said god can't do no more about it it's up to you you've got to make the decision you can sit here till you die look you've been invited to go down you don't have to go down to the enemy's camp you come to a father's house where he's expecting you tonight he wants you to come he says he sent his son he died he put a deposit in for your healing and the hour has come for you to make a decision now amen he says the hour has come hebrews 10 23 says let us hold fast to the profession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promised it's not you are faithful but god is faithful for he promised amen but we've got to hold fast to the profession of our faith amen do you love the lord you know when i when i have a serious need in my life i begin to write down and thank god for what he's already given me brother branham he made a statement he says picture a well body and walk into it right if you have to picture your body go back and find a picture of you when you were healthy put it on the fridge or put it in your car look at it every day until god brings you back to that amen he said don't worry about it god's in he abideth faithful is that right amen romans 10 and 8 but what sayeth that the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth and in thy heart and that is the word of faith which we preach you begin to study faith in the scripture and you begin to see how it's everywhere because what is it it's our foundation and god wants you to be have a strong and sure foundation it's faith in the word of god amen god has not given us the spirit of doubt or fear but he's given us the spirit of a sound mind is that right he's given us the spirit of faith everything was finished at calvary he just wants you to believe it i love this brother ma'am says in the statue of a perfect man in 62 he says your faith brings brings god he said it's the thing that brings he says it's the thing that brings the prayer and god together on the scene and that's faith he said prayer he says faith changes from here to here and it brings it together he says speak the word he says all i want you to do is say the word and everything is all right he said see he didn't he said he didn't have to be there jesus say the word why he said god is omnipresent he's all-powerful he's just as powerful beneath the world as he is on top of the world or either side he's god and the only thing you have to do is just speak the word and he said now faith does the rest of it right and how true is that you can see it in fear and i've talked about this many times how the satan chose the mind but god chose the heart right and how many times can you let your mind run wild right maybe somebody has nothing against you but they just glanced at you the wrong way and in your mind you build up 4 000 scenarios that how that person doesn't like you maybe they're having a bad day and didn't shake your hands because they're dealing with really really hard family problems really hard financial problems really hard this or that but you created in your mind that they didn't like you and that's what satan likes to do come in and cause fear and doubt division that's what he is he comes in to divide steal kill and destroy is that right but could you imagine living a life where you just thought everybody liked you right i heard a man say one time he's like if they don't pay your bills you shouldn't worry their opinion about you i've kind of come to that grasp you want to come pay my bills i will gladly listen to your opinion but if you don't keep your opinion to yourself right you say well that's kind of comical but it's kind of true too why should we live our lives in fear and doubt of what other people think when it doesn't matter what they think all right we so it'd be really you know we should worry about what people think if the scripture said you know it's depending on how people view you as you can come into heaven but nowhere in the scripture does it say that nowhere does the prophet say that is how god views you is that right okay i'm gonna get off my high horse there and be done amen if the musicians would go ahead and come i'll just go ahead and wrap this up so don't worry god abideth faithful and the scripture romans 10 verse 8 said but what saith that he said the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth and in thy heart that the word he said the word of faith which we preach so we see if it's in your mouth i want this to just really sink in really good it's got to be in your heart it can't be in your mind this this is not a this is not a positive thinking scenario this is not a positive thing it's got to be rested in your heart that you believe what god has said you believe that he is the true and and that he is the true one true god you've got to believe that and then it can speak from your mouth amen so we see that that your faith brings god and prayer together so we see that faith is the foundation for all christianity all you are and all you'll ever be is based upon faith in the word of god now hebrews 13 8 says jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever now if he was able to do that for the four lepers if he was able to do that for rahab if he was able to do that for moses he was able to do that for the children of israel how much more will he be able to do it for you today his word is has been tested time and time again but if you'll take him in his word he will meet you right there and he will prove his word to you amen so we see that hebrews 11 6 says but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must believe that he is and that he is the rewarder of them that diligently seek him so without faith it's impossible to please god and i love how this all ties together when jesus is saying when i return what does he ask that he'll find will i find faith we say well you know faith is the abcs of the gospel and i love preaching on the simple things right but none of this works if you don't have faith you can quote to me every quote you want to quote you can tell me all the deep mysteries but if you don't have a foundation and faith in the word of god it means nothing it means absolutely nothing if you don't have faith in the word of god to believe that those things are capable of happening it'll do you no good that's like having a gun with no bullets or a bullet with no guns is that right so we see that without faith it is impossible to please him now the great thing is you can leave here tonight and hang your head low and say well i don't have enough faith to do what this brother does or this sister does i want you to know anybody can start right anybody can take a step in the right direction god has come down in this message tonight to tell you that you can make a change is that right and you can get rid of doubt you can get rid of fear why because he promised you faith he didn't promise you fear he said i will give you faith he said i will not leave those comfortless is that right he come here to comfort us do you love the lord amen i'll close with this scripture because i just i love the scripture i'll tie it all together in genesis 24 and 55 and her brother and mother said and this is let the damsel abide with us for a few days and this is where eliezer come to choose a bride he said he said let the dams will abide with us a few days at least 10 and then and that she shall go and he said unto them hinder me not seeing the lord hath prospered my way send me a way that i may go to my master and they said we will call to the damsel and inquire at her mouth and you know it's good for mom and daddy to believe it's good for your wife and husband to believe it's good for your sister and your brother to believe but what do you believe you can't ride a coat tail to heaven in verse 57 they said well call the damsel inquired her mouth and when they called rebecca they said unto her will thou go with this man and she said i will go we've got to come to a point of no return in our life we've got to come to a point that when faith is going to outweigh fear faith is going to outweigh doubt and we can see that by her words she believed what the messenger was saying right and this is just a perfect example example of the the bride and jesus of jesus christ coming and saying i will go when god calls us i will go is that right when he returns will he find faith in the bride that's what he's looking for he's not looking for big churches he's not looking for great people great singers he's not looking for for long hair and perfect dress he's not looking for legalism he's looking for faith is that right you know that's that's one of the greatest things is as you know when i ask somebody to do something if they fail a bunch of times i'm not going to keep asking but how many times can you go back and just one day just sit down and write it out where you've asked god to do something and if he didn't give it to you maybe it was something you didn't need is that right wants and needs are two different things you know my kids want candy that's a want they need their vegetables they need their protein they need this they need that they may ask for candy 100 times and get vegetables and only get candy once is that right god will give you what you have need of but that's the thing about the true christian when you come in tune with the word in tune in line with god you'll ask what you need for you'll become in tune with god that you'll ask him what he wants to give you is that right and faith will put you in that situation but you have to put your faith into motion now no one's going to leave here tonight and and say put my faith into motion because that means test me right no one's going to go out and just say god just test me put a mountain in front of me and let me just move it if you are you're crazy right satan's doing a pretty good job fighting me i don't want to add to the fire but if you truly believe in the word of god no matter what the enemy brings against you you'll believe and have faith that god will see you through to the end amen do you love the lord amen i hope something was said that god bless you i know it was jumbled up and mixed up but it came on my heart last night about midnight laying in the bed and and i just kept thinking about the four lepers and the story's done so much for me and my life looking at faith and you know you know raising kids and praying for them you know just the mighty things that i've seen god do in their lives and you know i talk i talk about my kids all the time but you know they're my favorite you know so you know i talk about it's just what i it's what i live for and my wife and you know with paxton that last time he was he was really sick and you know i just began to write down every day you know because they were going to do surgery if the bleeding didn't stop and y'all heard the testimony a million times maybe to bless somebody online but come down to the last day i mean the last day that the bleeding stopped and i was just writing down every day i was fasting and writing down every day i thank the lord for the healing of my son and just continuously continuously not pictured in my head what he was going to do what it was going to look like and i promise you within those few days god brought everything to pass amen because we believed it amen and i promise you if amen amen but that's the thing it doesn't work just for me it works for everybody every son and daughter of god has this right to stand on it and you know many people you know i've had people say you know you know i've had people talk to me oh mr positive that's all you want to think about that's all you want to dwell and well duh you know i mean my mom my wife people tell me bad news i don't want to hear it i don't even want to know about it you know that's why i'm probably not not the best person to talk to that's why god has pastors and other ministers they're really good at that because i'm going to come back with positive things i'm going to come back with well this is what you need to do this is what you need to do and i'm going to give you all the wrong advice that's why you need to go to your pastor not to admit i'm i'm i'm a youth minister or minister or evangelist i don't know what i am but i'm just here to preach the word of god is that right right that's why you have these other men that are called for these great things and for these good things because they're needed is that right they're very much needed but i promise you if you replace doubt with fear or excuse me replace doubt with faith good things will begin to happen in your life i promise you that the scripture says it if you don't believe me just try it for a week just just try to write down faithful things and just act like you've already got it god will give it to you amen he abideth faithful amen amen let's go ahead and stand we'll just sing that song if you don't mind we'll sing that song keep on the fire in line amen i was really concerned you know with what i was going to preach and i just knew in my heart when she started singing that song and i'd already written it down and knew that that's what i was going to sing when i come out you know just know god signifies those things for you maybe didn't do anything for y'all but it did something for me amen let's just sing this just before we go i don't know what key let's just start with the
