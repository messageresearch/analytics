[6:02] thank you for listening tonight if

[6:06] of problems with our internal
[6:07] connections so some of you may not be

[7:23] pray for that Allen this is Jenny's
[7:27] daughter Piper that has been sick today
[7:31] bill white camp had mentioned that
[7:33] sister Sharon was sick recently as well

[7:55] pray God that you would just move in our
[7:57] midst and I pray there would be a
[7:59] blessing that would come from this we
[8:01] don't know Father exactly why we do
[8:03] everything that we do but we know that

[8:08] pray that you would just move on behalf
[8:11] of these requests for for Piper and also
[8:13] for sister Sharon I prayed that you'd
[8:16] move for them in a mighty way or they
[8:19] would be physically heal rather than oh
[8:21] there's many other needs that are
[8:22] represented and many requests that have
[8:24] been cine and others that father maybe
[8:26] we don't even know about but you know
[8:28] about them you know what they are so I
[8:30] pray father on this Wednesday night that
[8:32] you would just move in a mighty way on
[8:34] behalf of these people that are
[8:36] listening or watching Lord of our little
[8:38] church god I pray that you would just
[8:40] bless us God that you would move us into
[8:42] the direction that we should go fathers
[8:45] we look at these things in the scripture
[8:46] we know that all Scripture is inspired
[8:48] by you so we asked you to come and and
[8:51] breathe that inspiration into our lives
[8:53] we pray in Jesus name Amen amen god
[8:57] bless you we're gonna read the 1st
[8:59] Corinthians chapter 1 I'll go ahead and
[9:02] read the first nine verses and then
[9:03] we'll go through it Paul called to be an
[9:06] apostle of Jesus Christ through the will
[9:09] of God and Sosthenes our brother unto
[9:13] the Church of God which is at Corinth to
[9:14] them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus
[9:18] called to be Saints with all that in
[9:21] every place call upon the name of Jesus
[9:24] Christ our Lord both theirs and ours
[9:27] grace be unto you and peace from God our
[9:30] Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ I
[9:33] thank my god always on your behalf for
[9:35] the grace of God which has given you by
[9:38] Jesus Christ that in everything you are
[9:41] enriched by him in all other ins and in
[9:44] all knowledge even as the testimony of
[9:48] Christ was confirmed in you so that she
[9:51] come behind in no gift waiting for the
[9:54] coming of our Lord Jesus Christ who
[9:57] shall also confirm you unto the end that
[10:00] ye may be blameless in the day of our
[10:02] Lord Jesus Christ God is faithful by
[10:06] whom you were called unto the Fellowship
[10:07] of His Son Jesus Christ
[10:11] our lord I want to go over that and it's
[10:13] kind of an introduction to the book of
[10:15] Corinthians I want to preface this
[10:17] tonight by saying that I do not believe
[10:20] we're a Corinthians church I believe
[10:22] that we are in a visions church that's
[10:24] what we aspire to brother Branham
[10:26] teaches us that we must have in
[10:28] Ephesians again and that's what we're
[10:30] looking for in order to take a rapture
[10:32] he says that and the God who is rich in
[10:33] mercy we must have an exodus to come out
[10:36] and to go in so there's got to be
[10:38] something deeper than what the
[10:40] Corinthian church had at the same time I
[10:43] think we all go through a Corinthian
[10:44] experience at one point or another so
[10:47] we're not looking to the Corinthian
[10:49] church as a pattern but we're looking to
[10:51] them as someone as people who are carnal
[10:54] and yet they repented and yet they come
[10:56] they weren't what they should have been
[10:57] in fact they may have been the worst
[10:59] Church of the New Testament that we know
[11:02] of as far as having problems and sins
[11:05] and things in the church but they come
[11:07] out of it and they repented and so we
[11:09] want to look at these things and knowing
[11:10] that the scripture is therefore not just
[11:13] for a rebuke but also so we can learn
[11:15] because we don't want to have to repeat
[11:17] the mistakes that they made we want to
[11:20] be an efficient church we want to be a
[11:22] church and it's not carnal but spiritual
[11:24] Corinth is a church and a carnal state
[11:27] emphasis is a church in a spiritual
[11:29] state I want to highlight tonight that
[11:32] both were Christ's Church Ephesus and
[11:36] Corinth were both Christ's Church they
[11:39] both belong to Christ and we'll see that
[11:41] tonight in Paul's writing we strive for
[11:44] Ephesians but sometimes we travel
[11:46] through Corinth to get there and so we
[11:49] want to make sure that we are going the
[11:51] right direction
[11:53] 1st Corinthians 1 1 as we read said Paul
[11:56] called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ
[11:59] through the will of God the first thing
[12:02] that Paul does is reinforce his
[12:04] Apostleship he writes with authority
[12:07] you'll remember that Jesus it was said
[12:09] also of him that he spoke as woman had
[12:13] Authority and not as the scribes he
[12:14] didn't just argue about the word but he
[12:17] spoke it with authority Paul writes with
[12:20] because he counts himself as an
[12:21] eyewitness of the resurrection of Christ
[12:24] even though he never met him in the
[12:26] flesh but he met the pillar of fire and
[12:29] brother Branham taught us that we had to
[12:32] meet the pillar of fire not just he said
[12:34] a minister had to meet he had no right
[12:36] to preach until he met the pillar of
[12:38] fire but he also taught us that we as
[12:40] individuals have no right to call
[12:42] ourselves a Christian unless we have met
[12:45] the pillar of fire we know that is the
[12:47] person of Christ the Holy Ghost and so
[12:50] we want to make sure that we have met
[12:51] Christ and Paul had met Christ you met
[12:53] him on the road to Damascus his
[12:55] authority come from his experience and
[12:58] also from his commission that he'd been
[13:01] given so now he had authority beyond
[13:03] what we do because he had the authority
[13:05] to speak the word as the messenger of
[13:07] the age not just any messenger but the
[13:09] pattern to every age after that and we
[13:11] find brother Branham teaches that in the
[13:13] church ages it's it's a common theme
[13:17] with Paul and even with the other riders
[13:18] in the New Testament to reinforce why
[13:21] they have the authority to speak like
[13:22] they do we've been asked us I heard a
[13:25] pastor say one time we've been asked to
[13:27] believe an incredible thing and that
[13:30] said we're going to be raised from the
[13:33] dead we believe in a resurrection we
[13:34] believe as this is Easter week we
[13:36] believe that Christ was raised from the
[13:39] dead and if he was raised from the dead
[13:41] for our so that we could also raise with
[13:44] him that's an incredible thing to
[13:46] believe and where do we get the
[13:47] authority to say those things well we
[13:49] get it as Paul did from our from our
[13:53] Commission as to be the Bride of Christ
[13:55] and also from our experience but Peter
[13:59] said it this way said we've not followed
[14:00] cunningly devised fables when we made
[14:03] known unto you the power and coming of
[14:05] our Lord Jesus Christ but we were
[14:06] eyewitnesses of his majesty in birth
[14:10] Peter 4:11 he goes a little further and
[14:13] he tells us how we should speak of this
[14:15] and he says if any man speak let him
[14:17] speak as the Oracles of God and that
[14:20] word Oracle is actually the Word of God
[14:23] I know some of you are getting having
[14:27] trouble with the internet and that's
[14:28] fine and some of you're gonna have to
[14:29] watch this tomorrow
[14:30] because my internet upload speed is not
[14:32] good but we'll go ahead and go through
[14:34] it and then if you get a chance to watch
[14:35] it go ahead and do that the video should
[14:38] be fine it's just the internet upload
[14:40] speeds not very good so he says if any
[14:43] man speak let him speak to so Oracles of
[14:45] God if any man minister let him do it as
[14:47] the ability of which God giveth that God
[14:51] in all things may be glorified through
[14:53] Jesus Christ to whom be praised and
[14:55] Dominion for ever and ever
[14:58] now brother Branham teaches us that we
[15:01] should speak that way that we should
[15:03] speak the Word of God he said the word
[15:04] this is from the Laodicean Church age
[15:06] the word is supposed to be an our mouth
[15:09] too he said now we know that the church
[15:12] is his body it's here taking his place
[15:15] he said what will it be in the mouth of
[15:18] the church or what will be in the mouth
[15:19] of the church the word and he quotes 2nd
[15:22] Peter 1:21 and then he quotes where it
[15:26] says in the scripture for the prophecy
[15:27] came not in old time by the will of man
[15:29] but holy men of God spake as they were
[15:31] moved by the Holy Ghost so we're to have
[15:34] the word as well and speak at the
[15:35] Oracles of God when we speak the word we
[15:38] speak with authority
[15:40] in fact brother Brown tells us that the
[15:42] bride will be the final voyage to the
[15:43] final age under their messenger that's
[15:45] important to remember but the random
[15:48] talks about them in a in a personal
[15:50] thing I'm kind of dwelling on this long
[15:51] I won't take this long in every verse
[15:53] but I want us to understand this we do
[15:55] have authority to speak and brother
[15:58] Branham takes it this way in questions
[16:01] and answers he says these prays that
[16:03] made the men and women that we come in
[16:05] contact with may it be in deep sincerity
[16:08] may we speak of the Oracles of God he
[16:11] said not overbearing but talking wisdom
[16:14] that we might know how to win others to
[16:17] use so I think that's important that we
[16:18] speak as if with authority but not
[16:21] overbearing but with wisdom to know the
[16:23] right things to say and so Paul says
[16:27] called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ
[16:29] and Sosthenes our brother sustenance
[16:32] it's an interesting person the only
[16:34] other time he's mention
[16:35] the New Testament is in acts 1817 and
[16:39] Sosthenes is mentioned there because
[16:42] he's the chief ruler of a synagogue in
[16:44] Corinth and he is beaten because of the
[16:48] Greeks blamed him for some things that
[16:50] happened while Paul was there and so
[16:52] they beat him there but eventually he
[16:55] converted and he was with Paul at this
[16:57] time I think it's interesting because
[16:59] Paul never isolates himself from the
[17:02] rest of the ministry so you can see that
[17:04] Paul always considered himself to be a
[17:07] part even though his ministry was far
[17:09] greater than theirs whatever be as I
[17:11] said we don't know anything else from
[17:13] history or from the scripture about
[17:15] Sosthenes
[17:15] but Paul includes him as if he's there
[17:18] with him riding with him even though we
[17:20] know these things are given to
[17:22] inspiration or by inspiration to Paul so
[17:26] he doesn't isolate himself from the rest
[17:27] of the ministry even though his ministry
[17:29] was greater there's some examples of
[17:31] that and 2nd Corinthians 1 1 if you're
[17:34] riding it now in 2nd Corinthians 1 1
[17:36] where he says Paul an apostle of Jesus
[17:37] Christ with a little God again a common
[17:39] theme he says and Timothy our brother so
[17:43] he includes him in the in the
[17:45] introduction to the to the Corinthians
[17:47] and 2nd Corinthians in galatians 1:1
[17:50] says Paul an apostle not of men neither
[17:52] by man but by jesus christ and god the
[17:55] father who raised him from the dead he
[17:57] says in verse 2 and all the brethren
[17:59] which are with me unto the churches of
[18:02] Galatia so paul includes all of the
[18:04] brethren in that and so he's not he's
[18:06] not denying his own authority to speak
[18:09] as the messenger of the age but he is
[18:11] bringing others with him in that
[18:19] all right yeah the livestream is having
[18:21] some trouble but we're working on that
[18:25] all right so
[18:33] so Paul is an apostle of Jesus Christ by
[18:37] the will of God but yet he speaks with
[18:39] these other brothers these brethren that
[18:41] are with him I think that we have the
[18:45] wrong idea of what a one-man message is
[18:47] a one-man message did not mean to Paul
[18:51] or brother branham what it means to
[18:52] people today and I think it's it's
[18:57] evident of that and we believe in a one
[18:59] man message we believe the message came
[19:00] to one man but then he committed it to
[19:03] other men that her faithful he taught
[19:04] and brother Branham teaches that in the
[19:06] church age but but the ground was asked
[19:08] a question is it true that no one should
[19:09] preach but you you all know this but
[19:10] just to kind of reiterate this is where
[19:12] we're coming to this in the book of
[19:14] Corinthians and he said we they asked
[19:17] him we've seen you ordained men we don't
[19:19] believe you would do that there were not
[19:21] they were not to preach but the Brent
[19:23] says mercy brother sister EVER who told
[19:25] you that nobody's to preach with me I'd
[19:27] sure be a poor subject to God with all
[19:29] that no every man or woman that feels a
[19:32] call of God upon his life get into the
[19:35] ministry and start preaching we need
[19:37] them he says men of God are anointed all
[19:42] over the world to preach the gospel he
[19:44] said see I'm just one little pebble on
[19:45] the beach among many big stones so
[19:48] there's just many more that's more
[19:50] eligible more worthy more of anything to
[19:52] preach to me I'm just one little humble
[19:53] person laying out here one grain of
[19:56] wheat in the old garner Sea so he said
[19:58] you know what I mean he said any man
[20:00] that's called of God needs to preach the
[20:02] gospel so I think that's still true
[20:04] today so Paul had never never
[20:06] disassociated himself never
[20:09] disassociated himself from the fivefold
[20:10] ministry so he writes unto the Church of
[20:14] God which is at Corinth and that is a an
[20:18] interesting as verse to into the Church
[20:20] of God which is at Corinth Corinth is an
[20:22] interesting place because it's known for
[20:24] its debauchery it's known for
[20:25] drunkenness in fact when they would
[20:26] portray a Corinthian on the screen they
[20:30] would portray that the Corinthian was
[20:34] drunk that's the way they would portray
[20:36] and I don't know how they would portray
[20:37] an American on the stage rather screen
[20:40] but when they would portray them they
[20:42] would portray them as a drum so he
[20:44] speaks to the church
[20:45] churches the ecclesia that called out
[20:47] the ones who are called out of the world
[20:50] and it came ultimately to me and
[20:53] congregation it's interesting that the
[20:56] idea of a local church was already
[20:59] formed at this time we're passing notes
[21:03] here so y'all forgive us the idea of a
[21:05] local church was already formed the
[21:07] church he is speaking of the church he's
[21:14] speaking of is a church that would be
[21:18] very much like ours
[21:27] still looks like our hearing that's
[21:29] almost completely down but we're still
[21:30] recording so it would be a church that
[21:33] had deacons it would be a church that
[21:35] had a pastor it would be a church who
[21:37] had or an elder there in the church that
[21:39] would have preached to those that were
[21:41] assembled it would have deacons who
[21:43] cared for natural things they would have
[21:45] taken up offerings serve communion
[21:47] although they did it in the wrong way
[21:48] but they would have cared for those in
[21:51] need provides support for missions
[21:53] there's many things that the Corinthian
[21:55] church would have done that would have
[21:56] been recognized today though it was
[21:58] probably in a house or something some
[22:00] kind of informal place so he speaks to
[22:04] them as a church and he says to them
[22:05] that are sanctified in Christ Jesus
[22:08] called to be Saints with all that in
[22:10] every place call upon the name of Jesus
[22:13] Christ our Lord he says both theirs and
[22:17] ours and so we find the church at
[22:20] Corinth was a sovereign Church and we
[22:22] believe in the sovereign ocol Church but
[22:25] was still a part of the universal Body
[22:26] of Christ
[22:27] there were some places when poet write
[22:30] letters Romans said there were about
[22:32] three congregations in Rome when Paul
[22:35] wrote the book of Romans and yet he
[22:38] wrote to all of them he addressed them
[22:40] all and so he's saying here those that
[22:42] are sanctified to the church so those
[22:44] were sanctified called to be Saints to
[22:46] though and also to those who which in
[22:48] every place and that includes us call
[22:51] upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord
[22:53] both theirs and ours so by saying theirs
[22:59] and ours Paul's reminding us that they
[23:00] don't have a monopoly on truth so he's
[23:03] saying I'm writing to Corinth but
[23:05] Corinth isn't the only place that
[23:07] preaches the gospel they're a church
[23:10] that belongs to Jesus Christ but so we
[23:12] are all of the other churches in
[23:14] whatever city they're in or whatever
[23:16] place they're in wherever the people are
[23:19] saying sanctified ones wherever they're
[23:21] filled with the Holy Ghost wherever they
[23:22] preach the same gospel those people are
[23:25] still there and so it's theirs and ours
[23:31] 1st Corinthians 1:3 says grace be unto
[23:34] you and peace from God our Father and
[23:36] from the Lord
[23:36] Jesus Christ this is st. Paul's greedy
[23:41] and all the epistles except the pastoral
[23:43] epistles which he has the word mercy
[23:46] it's a remarkable blending of the Greek
[23:48] and Jewish greetings where the Greeks
[23:50] would say grace be to you and the Jews
[23:53] would say peace be unto you and so he
[23:58] blends those together because the church
[24:00] was united and it's a wonderful Greek he
[24:03] said I think my God always on your
[24:05] behalf for the grace of God which he's
[24:08] giving you by Jesus Christ I think this
[24:11] is important because Paul is about to
[24:12] skin the hide he's about to let him know
[24:15] that they're doing wrong but he doesn't
[24:18] discount them as Christians because the
[24:20] book of Corinthians doesn't have
[24:22] anything to do it's a book of Correction
[24:24] it's not a book of punishment but it's a
[24:27] book of Correction and we find that they
[24:29] were corrected and they repented in 2nd
[24:32] Corinthians and you know that's
[24:34] important because some many times we
[24:36] discount churches or people or groups of
[24:38] people because of the way that they act
[24:40] and we've got to remember that they
[24:42] belong to Christ he'll correct them but
[24:45] he'll put them back in their proper
[24:46] place some people would say that Saints
[24:50] would never have to struggle with the
[24:51] things that the Corinthians struggled
[24:53] with I don't believe that because
[24:55] brother Branham tells us that a Holy
[24:57] Ghost person can be driven to do minor
[24:59] things he tells the sentence and answers
[25:03] in questions and answers in 1961 he
[25:07] tells us he said you were at one time
[25:10] there was no battle you were just
[25:12] slopping along as he said but now you've
[25:14] cleaned up now you're in the battle and
[25:16] he said you become a target when you get
[25:18] the Holy Ghost you actually put yourself
[25:20] up a target and so he said if you don't
[25:23] have these these things that you're
[25:26] fighting he said sure he said you say
[25:28] sure nothing bothers me any more he said
[25:30] oh brother I believe you better go back
[25:31] and try again so we want to make sure
[25:34] that we are sensible in these things and
[25:38] know that yes it could happen and yet
[25:40] the Holy Ghost is able to keep us from
[25:42] every sin
[25:44] but the RAM says as soon as you get the
[25:46] holy ghost Satan's got every gun right
[25:48] on you shooting at you and so we've got
[25:52] to remember that that we're going to be
[25:54] shot at we're going to be we're going to
[25:57] be persecuted there's gonna be problems
[25:59] but we've got to understand and know
[26:01] that God still with us and so he said
[26:05] you just move on as soon as you get the
[26:07] Holy Ghost you're gonna get shot at
[26:08] verse 5 1st Corinthians chapter 1 and
[26:11] verse 5 says that in everything you're
[26:16] enriched by him you are enriched by him
[26:19] Christ doesn't come to take away from
[26:21] your life but he comes to bring the
[26:22] riches of His grace into your life and
[26:25] all other ins and an all knowledge just
[26:28] two Greek words and he said you are
[26:32] enriched by him that's logos and gnosis
[26:35] foreknowledge logos obviously for
[26:38] utterance of the word he said you are
[26:40] enriched by this so they had logos they
[26:42] had the word and they had an
[26:45] understanding but for some reason they
[26:47] had a problem making it work they had a
[26:49] problem living it but yet at one time
[26:53] they had been sinners and they come out
[26:54] of the world they had they were the
[26:56] church they were that called out at
[26:58] Corinth they were not a just a worldly
[27:00] bunch of people but yet they had allowed
[27:02] the world to creep back in and so we
[27:04] find in verse 6 that the testimony of
[27:07] Christ was confirmed in them he said
[27:09] even as the testimony of Christ was
[27:11] confirmed in you in other words you've
[27:13] been saved you had an experience with
[27:15] God you know what it is to meet God
[27:17] you've been there it was confirmed in
[27:20] you it doesn't merely mean that the
[27:21] truth was established among them the
[27:24] people in that area knew the truth but
[27:25] that they were living confirmations of
[27:28] the Apostolic testimony they did have
[27:31] good works they had been taught in
[27:34] different things but they were carnal it
[27:37] was evident that they were Christians
[27:39] but they were carnal Christians
[27:42] and so they were unable to do the things
[27:46] that they had need to do that they
[27:48] needed to do to do the to do the right
[27:51] thing and to live as Christians and to
[27:53] overcome in the world and so Paul was
[27:55] correcting them for that reason now he
[27:58] tells them in verse 7 he said so that
[28:01] you come behind in no gift I'd be
[28:04] something further to be said about a
[28:06] church he said in gifts you're second to
[28:10] no one
[28:11] he said waiting for the coming of our
[28:14] Lord Jesus Christ so they had they had
[28:16] they understood that he said you come
[28:18] behind it no gifts gifts of healing
[28:20] tongues all the things that he talked
[28:21] about in the book of Corinthians that
[28:24] another way to put this was you're not
[28:26] conscious of inferiority you're not
[28:29] conscious of being inferior to other
[28:31] churches but you're you believe that you
[28:34] do have the gifts you know that you the
[28:36] Spirit of God moves among you and you
[28:38] know that you're Christians you know you
[28:40] serve God you know who you are but yet
[28:42] you don't have the ability seemingly to
[28:46] live it and that seems like a paradox
[28:50] almost something that couldn't be true
[28:51] but it was verse 8 says who shall also
[28:54] confirm you unto the end that you may be
[28:58] blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus
[29:01] Christ now look that you may be
[29:06] blameless I like this
[29:09] he says it's a word it's the exact
[29:12] equivalent the word blameless and the
[29:14] English is the exact equivalent of the
[29:15] Greek and it signifies free from
[29:18] reproach brother Branham puts it this
[29:21] way about his life he said that's been
[29:23] my attitude all along he said I want to
[29:25] go out of this world with that same
[29:26] attitude that knowing that some day I
[29:28] will receive a reward if I can only be
[29:31] faithful that's what it's about it's not
[29:33] about how many are with us but can we be
[29:36] faithful if God doesn't count our
[29:38] successes he counts our faithfulness can
[29:41] we be faithful and he says I want to be
[29:44] faithful knowing that someday I shall
[29:46] receive a reward if I could only be
[29:47] faithful until that
[29:49] when the rewards are given Matthew 10 22
[29:54] tells us that we be hated of all men for
[29:57] his name's sake but he that endureth to
[29:59] the end should be saved that's what I
[30:01] want my testimony to be in the
[30:03] faithfulness and so the Corinthians were
[30:06] corrected so they could be blameless but
[30:10] they were corrected for a purpose and so
[30:12] he tells these Corinthians he said God
[30:14] is faithful by whom you were but whom he
[30:18] were called now if you go back to verse
[30:21] 1 it says Paul called to be an apostle
[30:22] of Jesus Christ of the will of God but
[30:25] now he says God is faithful by whom you
[30:28] were called and so Paul understood that
[30:30] if God was faithful to him to call him
[30:33] out of his obstinance out of his
[30:35] persecution of the Church of God was
[30:37] faithful to him he would be faithful to
[30:40] the Corinthians God is faithful by whom
[30:43] you were called unto the Fellowship of
[30:46] his son Jesus Christ our Lord brother
[30:51] Branham tells us this great creator
[30:53] Savior God is faithfully working amongst
[30:55] his own right now it was the great
[30:57] Shepherd of the Sheep it's very
[30:59] existence as for his own he loves him
[31:01] and cares for them his eye is ever upon
[31:04] them when the word says that your lives
[31:05] are hid with Christ in God it means
[31:08] exactly what it says he says though I'm
[31:12] so glad that my God abides faithful I
[31:14] can say amen to that tonight it's true
[31:17] to himself he won't lie he is true to
[31:20] the word he will back it up he's true to
[31:22] us he would lose none of us but raise us
[31:24] up in the last day he said I am glad
[31:26] that I'm resting in his faithfulness
[31:28] Philippians 1:6 being confident of this
[31:31] very thing he which has begun a good
[31:34] work in you will perform it until the
[31:36] day of Jesus Christ and that's what
[31:39] Paul's saying God is faithful even when
[31:41] the Corinthians were not faithful God is
[31:44] faithful by whom you were called unto
[31:47] the Fellowship of His Son Jesus Christ
[31:49] our Lord and so if you're called the
[31:50] fellowship he's faithful to correct you
[31:53] do you come into fellowship that you
[31:55] should
[31:57] for money in this tonight and I trust it
[32:01] and let's just spend a few minutes we've
[32:03] had some problems with the audio and you
[32:05] weren't able to watch maybe the whole
[32:06] thing but through but you'll be able to
[32:09] watch it later but I want us to
[32:12] understand the faithfulness of God even
[32:17] if we fail God as a corinthian church
[32:19] did God is faithful to bring the right
[32:22] kind of correction so that we can begin
[32:24] to live for God because that's what he
[32:26] wants we want to have the right
[32:28] testimony at the end the same one who
[32:30] confirmed it in us when we were saved we
[32:32] want to have that same confirmation at
[32:34] the end so that we can have our reward
[32:37] at the end and that's what we want let's
[32:40] bow our heads again one more time our
[32:43] gracious Heavenly Father is so grateful
[32:45] to be in your presence again and lord
[32:48] these things the storm coming and the
[32:51] internet going out but we know that
[32:52] you're still God father and these things
[32:55] happen for a reason we know that this
[32:57] epidemic that's on the earth today Lord
[33:00] the scientists don't know all they can
[33:02] do is interact Lord from a scientific
[33:05] perspective but we believe in something
[33:08] more we believe there are worse things
[33:09] and death we also believe that we have a
[33:13] healer we have a God who heals all of
[33:16] our diseases yet work sensible with
[33:18] these things and not able to gather
[33:20] together here tonight but but we know
[33:23] that wherever we are you are and you
[33:26] promised you would be faithful to us
[33:28] Lord you would confirm our faith in the
[33:31] end so we're grateful to that Lord as we
[33:33] look maybe in the future as we get these
[33:36] things ironed out it will look at more
[33:38] of the book of first Corinthians I pray
[33:40] God that you would just begin to show us
[33:42] how faithful you are I prayed you to
[33:45] heal every sick person tonight Lord as
[33:48] we go home or go to our rooms or
[33:50] whatever that it is and we go a layer
[33:52] head on our pillow may we know that you
[33:54] are faithful father to heal and to save
[33:57] and to do the things that only you can
[33:59] do
[34:00] I pray you granted now we
[34:02] in Jesus name Amen god bless you but
[34:05] we'll see you on Sunday morning
