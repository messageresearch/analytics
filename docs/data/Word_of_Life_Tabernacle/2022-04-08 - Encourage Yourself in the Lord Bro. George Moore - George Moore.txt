so happy for the invite i i have uh i i don't know that i've ever met brother ben i think i might have seen him one time at his sister's wedding and uh but i have known the pruitt family for oh my how long sister sharon it was 20 something years ago i guess when uh sister sharon brother john and a little bitty uh brother joel and tabby and becky and all of them come by i was a pastor in church over in union city and and uh they came by and i'll tell you when they told me that uh joel had started preaching i said i gotta i gotta hear this for myself so uh so i logged on uh to the to the church's stream and pulled joel up and what i what i heard was brother ben said you know my brother started preaching and i'm so happy for that he said you know the lord can speak through a donkey it's uh but i thought he did a good job saints i really did i thought he did a really good job and uh i was i was surprised i'm proud of him and and uh i've kind of got a love-hate relationship with joel i've i love him most of the time and sometimes i just want to get a hold of him you know and uh but i'm just teasing he's uh he's been a blessing to me and and the whole uh pruitt family has been all these years and so uh certainly happy to be here got uh we've been down in hot springs this weekend having some services and and got the invite to come by i looked at it on the map and uh wouldn't have been able to make it but you uh y'all have service at three o'clock in the afternoon so uh it worked out to where i could get by here and i still got to get back to nashville tonight uh so we got a little

union city there so uh i did not know they were making it so glad to see you here as well and uh so god bless you all and and uh so hopefully we can say something to be an encouragement today uh i'll just go ahead and get it out of the woods now i believe this message with everything that is within me the message changed my life i i uh started out i'd never been to church a day in my life i'd never went to uh i told the saints last night i went to one pizza party at a baptist church when i was 10 years old and outside of that i'd never been a church a day in my life until until i came into this message and that's been 24 years ago i've never seen anything that i thought was better when i when i came into this message i stopped looking brothers and sisters and and uh uh i you know people talk all the time about i guess there's kind of a thing going around about you know whether uh uh the the the bridge uh vision of the bridge was right and whether this i don't look at any of that what i'm looking at is is the word of god vindicated in our day and brothers and sisters this message has been tried and trued there's no i haven't found one iot of it that i couldn't hang my soul on and so that's what i i'm not looking at the miracles that's the bait on the hook i'm looking at what the word of god said amen and i feel so good tonight when i walked into church when we walked in that door is that the i got lost at the front door is that the front door there when i walked in that door uh i just felt i felt the spirit of god here and i felt good to be here and so uh i'm i'm just relaxed and happy to be with you all so if we could let's turn our bibles to first samuel first samuel the uh 30th chapter if you just stand while we read the word of god first samuel the 30th chapter we'll read uh the first six verses or so for a little text tonight very very familiar scripture first samuel 30 1-6 and it came to pass when david and his men were come to ziklag on the third day that the amalekites had invaded the south and ziklag and smitten ziklag and burned it with fire and had taken the women captive that were therein they slew not any either great or small but carried them away and went on their way so david and his men came to the city and behold it was burned with fire and their wives and their sons and their daughters were taken captive then david and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept until they had no more power to weep and saints unless you've been there you don't know what that scripture's talking about but there comes a time in your life where the trials are so great and the burdens are so heavy and the times are so tough that you just cry until you can't cry no more until they had no more power to weak and david's two wives were taken captives anonymous and the jezreelitis and abigail the wife of nabal the camelite and david was greatly distressed for the people spake of stoning him because the soul of the people was grieved every man for his sons and for his daughters but david encouraged himself in the lord his god let's just bow our heads heavenly father what a beautiful passage of scripture lord lord how grateful we are that it's you tonight that's our encouragement lord that it's you tonight that we lean on lord that you're the rock in the weary land you're the shelter in the time of storm you're our sufficiency lord you're all in all and father i just pray that you would help me tonight lord bless this service bless these wonderful people lord the bride of jesus christ standing before me tonight lord don't take it lightly that i have the privilege of speaking to your bride and now lord i just pray that you would lord speak through me lord move me out of the way bind my lips before i'd speak anything unpleasing to you and we'll give you the praise and honor in the name of the lord jesus christ and the bride said amen amen and you can be seated and we'll take a little text tonight of encourage yourself in the lord if you just keep your bibles there to first samuel the 30th chapter uh we'll just stay right in first samuel the 30th chapter tonight just kind of a little sunday evening bible study if you will how many of you love your bible amen do y'all believe the bible for our day as well amen amen we've got the written word and the spoken word but it doesn't change the written word does it right amen amen it's the it's the it's the it's it's it's the front sight and the rear side of the gun amen and so we find now in our text of david here uh just a little background before we get started first off david you find was a man on the run and david had spent a lot of time running and he'd been running and he'd been running from sauls everybody read your bible you know that that he that that saw and sought his life and saul had been after him and and david finally said i'm gonna perish at the hand of saul and so david moved himself across from his land onto enemy grounds and brothers and sisters we got to be so careful not to go out on the devil's grounds we got to stay on our grounds amen i i believe in getting sinners to the lord but they got to come with us we don't go with them amen so so david had first mistake that he made was getting out on the devil's grounds and david had moved across and he moved across into the philistine country and he was basically had made himself a mercenary for a philistine king and so we find that david brothers and sisters was fighting the wrong battle he wasn't just fighting he wasn't just fighting the enemy he was fighting his own people and saints will never get nowhere fighting our own people we'll never get nowhere tearing each other down we'll never get nowhere fighting amongst brothers and sisters of like precious faith god didn't call us to be mercenaries for the devil he didn't call us to attack one another he didn't call us to attack other churches yes sir he calls to live the life saints live the life before the people he didn't give us the message to memorize he gave us the message to internalize it's not something we do it's a life we live see if you're in the message you don't just come to church on wednesday and come to church on sunday it's it's a life you live every day and so we never get nowhere fighting against god's people and that's exactly the situation david found himself in fighting against god's people and it's wow he was fighting with god's people that the enemy crept into his home and the minute we keep our mind on our brothers and sisters we keep our mind on the things of the world we keep our mind on other churches we keep our mind on what's going on on facebook the enemies creeping into our homes brothers and sisters and when david come back to his home he found it in shambles he found it in ruin he found it destroyed come on yes sir right see the devil wants to keep us so occupied looking at everything else we take our our eyes off the main thing that's right come on saints you got to watch your home come on you got to guard it with your life every day you can't be absent you can't be out fighting the enemy preach come on that's the truth all right y'all love him tonight fighting on the wrong side you know in this day we've got more cases of what they call autoimmune disorders that's a that's a recent thing they didn't used to have autoimmune disorders autoimmune disorder is when your body starts fighting its own self it's when your body turns on itself when a brother is if that's those cases in the natural then it's the case in the spiritual for our day as well that the body would turn on itself and start fighting itself y'all believe that yes that's a layover seeing spirit not in lao to see it sir we've moved past laodicea amen y'all believe that y'all believe that we're in a dual dispensation where the church is rolling on in laodicea but the bride is entering into a bright age y'all believe that here amen brother man you've got believers in this church amen i i don't want no pardon leo to see you i want to come out of laodicea amen i don't want to lay out the spirit on my uh distilled spirit or my home i don't want it in my church amen yes sir we've been called to a higher calling than laodicea and so we find then that these mercenaries that david had with him and they were all fighting the enemy and the enemy moved in and took over his took over his land took over his home took over his city took all that he had and the enemy will take everything you got if you let him let's move on down in and just look here this first three verses there we find this the fourth verse excuse me the bible said that david and the people that were with him they wept until they had no more power to weep because their home had been taken captive everything they knew was gone yeah has anybody ever been there yes sir come on if you don't know what this is talking about let something happen to one of your kids one time let one of your kids start getting out in the world let let something happen let some let us get a bad doctor's report on your wife or your husband yeah yeah all right come on let one of these big trials of life and you'll figure out what it means to weep until you got no more power to weep and you'll notice that the bible said that the men were all distressed and they'd whip until they had no more power to weep and and even they even took their time to turn on david their their ruler their leader their king and they turned on him and they spake a stone in him but don't get too judgmental on those people they were emotional they were hurting saints these people were hurting and you know what hurting people say stuff they don't mean certain people act ways that they don't mean to act they're emotional emotional people aren't rational we got to have enough grace to get through that we got to have enough grace that when when people come into the church we don't know what they went through right before they got in that door we don't know what they're going through at home we don't know what they're dealing with at work we don't know what kind of stress this is in their life all we see is what we see on the outside we don't know their day to day we don't know what any none of us know what any of us is going through but saints let me assure you every one of us is going through it every one of us is fighting a battle every one of us has got trials and every one of us needs prayer not condemnation every one of us needs a safe space to come into where we can worship him every one of us needs the opportunity to be able to come into his presence look sometimes people build up i talked about it last night brother joel people build up complexes based on opinions and not facts somebody can walk into church and they've had a bad day and maybe they don't have the right kind of expression on their face and we we see them and we say oh i bet he's mad at me about so-and-so and we start getting a complex about a brother or sister when it hasn't got anything to do with you and then we start recruiting people onto our side because it's important that we're right did you see the way he looked you see the way he acted you know i ain't done nothing to him and we influence the way people feel about other people but by stating our opinions as facts saints you don't know what anybody went through before they got here today you don't know what they're dealing with at their home we've got to have enough grace brothers and sisters i read a quote last night brother brown said if you find somebody doing something wrong don't say nothing about it just pray for him he didn't say go tell the whole church and they were upset and when people get upset they say things and they do things they don't mean to do and every one of us if we'll be honest with herself has been upset and has said something or done something we did not mean to do and we want grace for ourselves but we want vengeance for everybody else when we do wrong we want forgiveness when our brother does wrong we want vengeance amen but the bible said blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy amen so don't be too hard on these brothers they they didn't mean it they were just upset and we can't be too hard on our brothers and sisters so we find in this they've been through some rough stuff you might have been through some rough stuff too but you'd have to admit this is probably a rougher day than any of us have seen everything was gone everything was taken that's true so you got hurting people hurting people yeah offending and being offended amen you know it doesn't matter if someone has something against you or not that's true you know they asked the lord peter did lord now if somebody offends me is it like seven times that i forgive them and on the eighth time that's pretty fair right seven times somebody does something bad to you seven times and then on the eighth time we can let them have it right jesus said now 70 times seven how many is that it's y'all don't watch veggie tales it's 490 times y'all 490 times did nobody have veggietales my goodness 490 times but you have to forgive so no matter how annoying joel is to me i know you all love him like i do then no matter how annoying he is unless he's a knowing 491 times in the same day which being that he might be getting close i don't know you got to forgive him [Laughter] brother brahm says this in questions and answers he said now that's that's where trust that's he said that's a test of whether you got the holy spirit or not when somebody says something evil against someone someone that claims to have the holy spirit and you say i'll i'll get even with her even if it takes me my last day oh i've been there he said see now that's where you check about your holy spirit healing line brother branham said listen here's a lovely thing you and you serve one another you're serving god and see the love of god is in every christian heart and be kind to one another forgive one another and if you don't see the scripture just alike well you believe anyhow and pray for the other person and just love one another and you'll find that there's no greater evidence of a christian in the world than love now you didn't say if you don't see the scripture just alike snip and quote a clip and copy and paste all the quotes that you can find to cut the brother down see it's we need to learn the message we need to know the message those tapes need to keep playing but brothers and sisters it's to make us better not to prove somebody else wrong it's to help us i don't want a bunch of parents that just can repeat every quote i want somebody that's living those quotes on the inside i want somebody measuring themselves by the word of god and saying lord here i am here's where your word says i should be now take me to where i should be lord. amen we're not learning the message to prove how we're right guess what we wouldn't rights none of us was right and if you're right today it's by the grace of god it's not anything we did and if we're right we can just say thank you lord and if you made me right lord think about this saints if he made you right he can do the same thing for your brother he can do the same thing for your sister amen is this all right tonight and so we find him brother branham says be kind to one another be kind to your enemies that's asking a lot be kind to one another be kind to your enemies love everybody no matter what they've done love them anyhow and if you can't do that brother sister if there ever was a time then you need to be at the altar inspiration he says and if there's anything we ought to be it's kind to one another when you see a brother a sister in fault don't never breathe it to nobody keep it to yourself and pray for that person be kind to them and if the spirit of god is in you then you will be kind to one another brother brahma said god don't let me be crowned a crab it old man don't let my wife be a crab an old woman let me grow gracefully in age amen let me let me get sweeter as the days go on [Music] let me no matter what the scars are if you've been in the message very long at all you got some scars yeah that's right you've got some complexes you've been through some trials you've been in a message very long those grudges don't hold nobody back but you and if you got a grudge against a brother or sister they don't even know about it it's not bothering them it's only bothering you it's only holding you back not them so we find then moving forward just a little bit back to our back to our text we're finding everything was going wrong with david yeah his men were turned against him his wife his children all of his goods they were gone the enemy had taken everything you know sometimes life takes more than it gives that's true and david was we'll call it at the end of his rope and the bible said that at the end of his robe david david's pastor came and preached him a powerful message all david's friends came and had a prayer meeting for him david had to encourage himself in the that's right lord the bride has made herself ready yes sir amen it's an individual affair between us and god i love my children i've raised my children in the message the best of my ability but they got to come the same way i did that's right they got to have their own experience it's not good enough me telling them about my experiences they got to come their own way yes sir amen yeah you got to have your own experience and david the bible said encouraged himself in the lord what a lesson to us sometimes you're going to find out brothers and sisters when you start stepping for the lord brother joel when you start working for the lord when you start doing what the lord has called you to do when you when you start when you take out when you feel the leadership of the holy spirit in your life and and you and you step out on faith to pursue that what the lord has led you to do you're going to turn around and look and you're going to find you're all by yourself your family they'll turn on you sometime even your even your husband your wife sometimes won't see what you see sometimes this walk is a is a lonely one it's just you and jesus the bible said david encouraged himself in the lord but i want you to notice it says that but it goes on to say specifically how it was that david went about doing that let's look at that just just for a moment now david encouraged himself in the lord seventh verse says this that david said to avatar the priest amalek's son i pray thee bring me hither the ephod now y'all know what the ephod is right it's the it's the it's the breastplate of air it's the urim of thumb oh yeah amen now we know what our you're my feminist brother braham said it was the word amen he said ours today it's the word of god amen so david said i'll tell you what i'm going to need here i'm going to need to hear some word yeah i'm going to need to see what the word says do about my situation here i'm going to need to hear it for myself i'm going to need to hear the word of god so they brought it to him and he got to looking and after he went before the ephod the bible said in the eighth verse that david inquired of the lord saying shall i pursue after this troop david went to prayer all right is that right yeah so it's a simple two-step process for you and i to use to encourage ourselves in the lord brother braham said a christian reads their bible and prays every day yes sir amen read your bible and pray hear the word and pray you see when you come to the house of the lord if brother ben stands up here and gives the message that the lord placed on his heart that is the word of god to you but then then the other part of that is you got to receive it and then after you receive it how many of you can be honest with yourself and say i don't pray enough about it amen i don't pray enough about it you know when we leave the church we should go home and be prayerful about the service that we just heard yes sir and praying for the service that is to come and we're constantly praying that god will deliver the word to us that we need to stay encouraged in our walk it doesn't happen just but it's not just all on the pastor it takes all of us pulling it takes all of us praying you dictate the quality of the service you dictate the operation of the gift and we don't spend near the time needed to invest in prayer into our services saints you get the congregation praying you want to set the house on fire get the congregation to pray amen that and and when do you do the clarity by which brother ben can bring the message it's exponentially increased amen it opens the yes sir channel sir when we listen to the message we listen to the tapes saints it's not background noise i believe it's disrespectful for it to be background noise when we listen to those tapes we need to listen to those tapes minimize the disruption and focus on what he's saying y'all believe that yes and so we find then that david did those things david looked at the ephod david consulted the lord david sought the lord and when david got the decision from the lord the lord said go get it back yes sir go take back what belongs to you now saints here's the here's the trick though it's good it's good to get the word from the lord it's really good to get the word from the lord it's good to have an answer from god it's good but then david had to do something he couldn't just say well thank you lord amen thank you lord for giving me the answer to my prayer no the bible said he had to go pursue the enemy yes sir he had to go he had to get after it saints you can't just ask the lord to answer your prayer and then when it does you just sit there on your laurels when we pray we ask god to do something we got to be looking for the answer yes sir and when he shows you what to do then then you got to do it look david was having a bad day it's okay to have a bad day it's all right everybody's got a bad day it's okay to feel sorry for yourself sometimes it's fine it's all right to spend the day moping around feeling sorry thinking you got it worse than anybody else look elijah did it elijah said i'm the only one lord i'm the only one it's just me lord i'm the only one that hadn't bowed the knee to bear there were seven thousand others that was just like him and when you think you're the only one no there's seven thousand other people going through the exact same thing you're going through and it's all right to have a bad day it's all right to get down but after a while you got to shake yourself you got to say i've had enough of it i'm done with it i'm tired of being tired i've had enough it's time for me to take back what god has given thank you me and david said i've had enough of all this crime yeah i've had enough of all this complaining i've had enough of all this bickering i'm not looking at all of y'all no more i'm looking right square at the enemy and i'm going to take back what it stole from me and he got his sights centered right on the enemy and brothers and sisters when you get your sights centered on the devil yes yes sir that's when you can go to work invasion of the usa brother brown said god may this little audience on this day wake up quickly right now before the end time comes and catches us in this condition may we renew ourselves as the how many of you want to renew yourselves this afternoon i want to be renewed today restore unto me the joy of my salvation lord i've been through some trials i've been through some tests but i'm asking you to restore me and he said rise and shake yourself and ask for the old way which is the good way and when you find it walk in it he said yes god grant that we can find the row old rugged way when we can stand together as hundreds and join our hands together and sing i'll take the way with the lord's despised few i've started in with jesus and i'm going through god help us to live and be like that amen thank you lord amen brother brown said god keeps his word he said stay out of this modern world stay out of these modern theologies yes just look to the lamb of god read your bible and pray all the time don't be weary be rejoicing happy for the redemption of the church is drawing nigh when we shall see him who died for us in tyson's spirits he said come give all you got to god say god i ain't got very much i'm just a little housewife i can't do very much lord but i can read my bible and i can pray every day i can throw out all the trash that's in my mind i can throw out all the stuff say sometimes we got to have a house cleaning sometimes we got to go through the house with the trash can get a hold of some of them games and and movies and stuff put it right in the trash it ain't good enough to do it once you got to keep going back and doing it over and over and over again you got to constantly be on patrol david got the word of the lord and it put david in action right yes sir see too many times we got the clear-cut word of god but we won't put it in action saint you don't have to ask the lord if it's his will for you to be healed it is his will for you to be healed don't believe that you don't have to ask god if it's his will to save your family it is in his word saints you apply that token to their life now leave the results up to him you do what he said i don't know what they're living like now oh maybe they're not living right it doesn't matter you apply that token anyhow yes sir get into action space brother braham says god's provide a way now when you say you've got faith for divine healing and something strikes you and says move out that's the confirmation that god has received your faith for divine healing that's right and when you got courage to put your faith in action but when you say you got faith and are afraid to let it go your faith is dead see but when you got faith and willing to let it go then god is confirming it with signs and wonders following and you'll see your healing yes sir [Music] the uncertain sound brother brown says if one church says do this and the other church says do that and one church says do this and another one says do that how can the christian know what to do sure see that's why we got one shout brothers and sisters we got one shout out these are believers brother ben i'm these are believers in here y'all believe we got one shout for our day amen the shout out the message that went forth that gathers the bride y'all believe that amen and so we find that the church says this church says that he says one says one thing one says another but i tell you my dear brother i'll tell you a place where there's no uncertain sound that's the bible that's god's eternal word it's the gospel and the gospel is the power and demonstration of the holy spirit put in action he said brothers and sisters this gospel that we preach it isn't just flowery words it is the power of the holy spirit that's put into action and we put the holy spirit in action in our life all you do you come to church you hear the word but then you gotta believe it receive it accept it and act upon it amen if you if you want to be healed you got to act healed [Music] amen if you want your family saved testify that god's saving them don't talk negative about them oh they're just getting worse and worse and worse no they're getting better god's word said they're getting better amen call those things that are not as though their words put your faith into action i like this now david put his faith into action yes he did 16th verse if y'all can pull that up i love this the bible said david he chased down those amalekites and when he found him yeah yeah oh they were having a good time oh yeah you know the enemy he's rejoicing at your infirmities oh they were having a good time they they were singing and dancing they were having a big time they was they was they was all happy because i took all of david's sheep and all of his cattle and all of his goods and they took all of his well he took his wives they took his children you know when the enemy thinks he's got the upper hand he gets he gets boastful he gets aggressive when he thinks he got the upper hand amen he gets bold when he thinks he's got the upper hand preach but the 17th verse says that david looked down on all that looked down at the enemy having a good time at his expense and david knew what the lord told him to do and the bible said that david smote that bunch of philistines or amalekites rather excuse me smote that bunch of amalekites from the twilight of one day to the evening of the next day brothers and sisters when you get your hands on the devil don't you let him up until he's dead don't you get up until it's all when you get down here in prayer don't you get up until it's finished when you're searching and you find the answer that you're looking for don't you stop until you get what you came for david didn't david didn't david didn't start fighting and get about half his stuff back david david smote amalekites from the night evening of one day until the evening of the next day he was constantly smiting the malachites they said david aren't you hungry i can't stop i'm smiting amalekites they said david look look here what somebody posted on facebook he said i ain't got no time i'm smiting the malachites david you see what so i'm so sad about you i ain't got no time i'm smiting amalekites i'm not taking my eyes off of this david didn't stop until it was done and the bible said that david recovered all for every bit of it everything that was his he took it back with him if there was five biscuits on a table he got all five biscuits back yes sir amen if there was 31 sheep he counted them out all 31 took them back david recovered all god don't halfway do nothing saints he ain't going to almost heal you he's not going to almost save your family he's not going to almost deliver you from that trouble he's not going to almost meet your needs he's not going to come pretty close to helping you pay the light bill he does it all yes sir yes sir yes he does not only does he do it all but he does a little extra yeah you know jesus fed 5 000 people with five loaves and two fish and after he got done they had to take up 12 baskets full of the fragments see not only does he do enough he does extra amen not only is he good enough for us tonight he's extra not only does he want to bless us tonight he wants to bless us extra more exceedingly abundantly above what we could ask for more than what we asked for greater than what we thought we needed
