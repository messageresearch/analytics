[19:24] believe the word of god that's what
[19:25] we're
[19:26] that's what we base our doctrine on and
[19:27] what we believe and so we're going to
[19:29] turn to the word of god first chronicles
[19:31] chapter 11
[19:32] and verse 10. it's good to have jason
[19:34] and emily with us and heavenly
[19:36] today and jason our brother david wants
[19:39] avonlea to come and i want jason to come
[19:41] so there
[19:42] i don't know where that leaves emily but
[19:45] but
[19:46] jason and i become really good friends
[19:47] and and
[19:49] we and we appreciate him very much first
[19:51] chronicles 11 and 10
[19:52] and emily as well first chronicles 11
[19:55] 10. these also
[19:57] are the chief of the mighty men whom
[20:00] david had
[20:01] who strengthened themselves with him in
[20:04] his kingdom
[20:06] and with all israel to make him king
[20:10] according to the word of the lord
[20:12] concerning israel
[20:14] i want to take for a text those words to
[20:17] make him king
[20:18] and the lord add his blessing to the
[20:20] word you may be seated
[20:22] this morning
[20:28] david didn't feel much like a king
[20:32] but the bruce when he first got to the
[20:34] cave of adullum
[20:35] he'd become a fugitive saul wanted to
[20:38] kill him
[20:40] he had to beg food and a weapon from a
[20:43] priest
[20:44] he'd pretended to be insane to get away
[20:47] from the philistines
[20:49] if you go and read those chapters you
[20:51] find that he had
[20:53] been in a bad place it's not a very good
[20:55] start to a kingdom
[20:57] doesn't look like much of a kingdom the
[21:00] world today might say the same thing
[21:03] about jesus and his kingdom they did
[21:05] when he was on earth they
[21:08] they didn't realize that he was the king
[21:10] in fact they mocked him for it and
[21:13] isaiah in isaiah 53 and 1 prophesied
[21:15] that he would come that way he said who
[21:16] hath believed our report
[21:18] to whom is the arm of the lord revealed
[21:21] it's an incredible
[21:22] report that a man would be born in the
[21:25] earth and he'd be virgin born he'd be
[21:27] the son of god to be god
[21:29] wrapped in flesh that's an incredible
[21:31] thing to believe
[21:33] you know people say today well i can't
[21:35] believe in miracles well you can't
[21:36] believe in the virgin birth then
[21:40] and so you'd have to leave that out but
[21:42] jesus came that way who hath believed
[21:44] our report to whom is the arm of the
[21:45] lord revealed
[21:47] verse 2 for he shall grow up before him
[21:49] as a tender plant and as a root
[21:51] out of a dry ground he hath no form or
[21:54] comeliness when we shall see him
[21:56] there is no beauty that we should desire
[21:58] him
[21:59] he is despised and rejected of men
[22:02] a man of sorrows acquainted with grief
[22:05] we hid as it were our faces from him he
[22:08] was
[22:08] despised and we esteemed him not
[22:14] he was homeless when he came to the
[22:16] earth in luke chapter 9 and verse 58
[22:19] jesus said foxes have holes birds of the
[22:22] air have nests
[22:23] but the son of man hath not where to lay
[22:25] his head
[22:26] makes you feel better about your house
[22:28] doesn't it
[22:31] makes me feel better about mine
[22:35] brother brahma says this way he said he
[22:37] stooped
[22:38] that we might be lifted
[22:41] that's christ's likeness by the way
[22:44] stooping so someone else can be lifted
[22:47] he stooped that we might be lifted he
[22:49] become us that we through his grace
[22:52] might become him
[22:54] he come to the homeless and became
[22:55] homeless itself that we might have a
[22:57] home
[22:59] he come to the sick and was made sick
[23:02] himself
[23:03] that we might be healed he came to the
[23:06] center
[23:07] and was made sin himself that we might
[23:10] be saved
[23:12] aren't you glad that you have a god like
[23:14] that
[23:15] aren't you glad you serve a god like
[23:16] that oh you know i know sometimes
[23:18] there's just when there's a few of us we
[23:20] we kind of get a little bit nervous and
[23:23] you think well
[23:24] people notice me but don't that just
[23:26] take all the nerves out of you you just
[23:28] want to worship him you
[23:30] you want to say man you want to you you
[23:32] want your voice to be heard because
[23:33] that's your god
[23:35] he come for the sick that was me he made
[23:38] himself
[23:39] sick so we might be healed comes a
[23:41] sinner and he's made
[23:42] sin he did no sin but he was made sin
[23:46] we might be saved
[23:49] when he died they mocked him by calling
[23:52] him the king of the jews
[23:55] in matthew 27 and verse 29 it says when
[23:58] they had platted a crown of thorns they
[24:00] put it upon his head and a reed in his
[24:02] right hand and
[24:03] they bowed the knee before him and
[24:04] mocked him saying hail king of the jews
[24:08] they spit upon him and took the reed and
[24:10] smote him on the head
[24:13] you read on down in verse 36 it says
[24:15] sitting down they watched him there
[24:18] and set up over his head his accusation
[24:21] his accusation written this is jesus
[24:25] verse 37 this is jesus the king
[24:29] of the jews they mocked him by calling
[24:33] him a king but he was the king
[24:39] don't look at what it looks like in the
[24:41] world what it looks like to the world
[24:43] god doesn't view things the way we do
[24:47] the potential doesn't lie in a person's
[24:50] money or or how good they look or what
[24:53] they've done in the past or what they've
[24:55] been
[24:55] but the potential is in the seed
[24:59] the potential is in the seat and david
[25:01] was in a bad place in his life but he
[25:03] had been anointed
[25:04] to be king and he was elected and for
[25:07] ordained by god to take that place
[25:09] and so there's nothing that could keep
[25:11] him from taking that place and you
[25:14] might find yourself in a hard time of
[25:15] life this morning and
[25:17] speaking to those sitting here and you
[25:18] watching this morning but
[25:20] you may find yourself in a difficult
[25:22] place but remember
[25:24] you were anointed to be something to do
[25:27] something
[25:28] and god is bringing you through this
[25:29] time to bring you to a better place
[25:35] brother branham talked about this bad
[25:37] place that david was in in his life
[25:39] and he's sitting there he said he was
[25:43] sitting there his throat burning him
[25:45] was in the middle of summer the
[25:48] philistines was taking advantage of that
[25:50] split between david and saul
[25:52] i could stop there and preach for a
[25:54] while but whenever there's a split or
[25:56] what the bible calls a schism in the
[25:58] body
[25:59] satan takes advantage of that right and
[26:03] that's why we have to be of one mind one
[26:05] accord
[26:06] and as much as it's possible live
[26:08] peaceably together and learn how to
[26:10] get along with each other because satan
[26:13] takes advantage of that split and satan
[26:15] took advantage
[26:16] and saul looking for david everywhere
[26:20] he said in the philistines also and then
[26:22] the philistines looking for the
[26:23] israelites
[26:24] he said talk about a time of confusion
[26:26] just about like it is now
[26:29] a time of confusion he said david taking
[26:32] refuge in this little place in this
[26:34] little shelter
[26:35] everywhere he could get to the little
[26:36] strongholds that he could hold into
[26:39] then he got up on the mountain on that
[26:40] hot middle of the summer
[26:42] when the heat was tremendous his throat
[26:44] parching and frustrations and fears in
[26:46] his heart
[26:47] and wondering oh god how could it be
[26:52] he said you poured that oil upon me not
[26:54] because i chose myself
[26:56] but you chose me why did you call me
[27:00] from hurting the sheep out yonder
[27:02] told me that you give me this to serve
[27:04] your people
[27:05] and here you've got me between the fires
[27:08] everywhere
[27:09] he said that was going through his heart
[27:11] i think brother branham spoke of his own
[27:13] experience as well that in the heat of
[27:16] the battle you begin to think and say
[27:18] lord
[27:19] i remember those nights that i laid out
[27:21] yonder on that hillside
[27:23] he said i remember when i watched them
[27:25] stars
[27:26] amen he says how they moved up yonder
[27:29] and how god talked to my little boy
[27:32] heart all of us can remember
[27:35] those days when you seem like you were
[27:38] that close to god
[27:40] but remember the same god is with you
[27:42] today
[27:44] now he's dealing with us and i said this
[27:45] a while back and i but i think it's
[27:47] important
[27:48] he's dealing with us in a more mature
[27:50] way
[27:51] than he has in the past we're not babies
[27:54] anymore
[27:55] we're not playing church anymore so god
[27:58] is dealing with us in a mature way and
[28:00] so he's letting us deal with
[28:02] things in a mature way because god
[28:04] doesn't want just a bunch of babies
[28:06] running around but he wants men and
[28:07] women
[28:08] sons and daughters that can that can
[28:10] fulfill his word
[28:13] and so in doing that he has to reach a
[28:15] place of maturity
[28:16] and david had reached that place where
[28:18] he said he's got to be trained he's got
[28:20] to go through this time
[28:21] to become a king but he can remember
[28:24] what it was like before
[28:26] he said i can remember when i got in the
[28:28] spirit one day looking at the clouds the
[28:30] shady green pastures till i screamed out
[28:32] in the spirit and saying the lord is my
[28:34] shepherd i shall not want
[28:36] yea though i walk through the valley of
[28:38] the shadows of death i'll fear no evil
[28:40] for thou art with me he remembered that
[28:44] he said oh my here he was right in the
[28:46] jaws of death right then on both sides
[28:48] the a
[28:49] though i walked through the valley of
[28:50] the shadow of death them good old days
[28:53] when the spirit was with me
[28:54] when god was with me i sang his praises
[28:57] enjoyed him
[29:00] you remember what it was like to enjoy
[29:01] being a christian
[29:04] we should be that way today but things
[29:07] get in the way don't they
[29:09] in the heat of the battle sometimes it's
[29:11] hard to know what it was like to
[29:13] remember what it was like to enjoy being
[29:15] a christian
[29:17] and then you enjoyed being a christian
[29:18] so you had to wear a mask and
[29:23] you got chased away by a hurricane
[29:27] he got sick he got old
[29:32] some of you know what i'm talking about
[29:34] he enjoyed being a christian until you
[29:35] had to deal with real problems in the
[29:37] church
[29:39] then all of a sudden the enjoyment just
[29:40] seemed like it leaked out
[29:44] but he's still the same god
[29:48] and that joy can still be there
[29:50] unexplainable in the middle of
[29:52] everything that you're going through
[29:53] in the middle of all the problems in the
[29:55] middle of all the situations of life
[29:57] that joy
[29:57] somehow comes in and just settles down
[29:59] over you and you think here i am lord
[30:01] i'm not young anymore
[30:02] i'm dealing you're dealing with me in a
[30:04] mature way but i know you still love me
[30:08] and you feel the joy of his love you
[30:09] feel the joy of deliverance even though
[30:11] you're going through a hard time
[30:15] he said i enjoyed him i remember one
[30:18] time and i'm skipping through some of
[30:19] this to save
[30:20] time but much of this comes from the
[30:23] message brother branham preached called
[30:24] why little bethlehem
[30:26] he says i remember one time little old
[30:28] lion
[30:29] come up one morning and got one of my
[30:32] sheep
[30:33] he said and the spirit of god came upon
[30:35] me and i went out and grabbed him
[30:36] and cut him to pieces i remember that
[30:39] deliverance
[30:42] you know some people don't have any
[30:44] memories of deliverance because they've
[30:45] never been delivered
[30:48] but i remember what god did
[30:51] and it helps when you're going through a
[30:53] hard time to begin to remember
[30:55] what god did for you begin to remember
[30:57] that you
[30:58] you weren't always in this hard place
[31:00] but there was a time
[31:01] when god delivered you and if he
[31:03] delivered you once he can deliver you
[31:05] again
[31:06] if he brought you out once he can bring
[31:08] you out again
[31:09] he's the same yesterday today and
[31:11] forever so as we get older in our
[31:13] christian experience brother harvey it
[31:14] ought to make us
[31:15] that much more settled and solid because
[31:18] we've seen god do it before
[31:21] we're not scared because we've seen him
[31:23] do it before if he did it before
[31:24] he can do it again he will do it again
[31:28] he said i can remember that evening just
[31:31] before the sun went down
[31:33] a bear come in and got one and i killed
[31:35] him
[31:37] amen them great deliverances you can
[31:39] remember
[31:40] when satan come after your kids you pray
[31:42] and god delivered
[31:43] you remember when satan come after the
[31:44] church and you pray and you begin to
[31:46] seek god and god brought a deliverance
[31:48] if he did it once he can do it again
[31:54] great deliverances as i remember when i
[31:57] sang his praises
[31:59] in my childhood days when i herded my
[32:02] sheep
[32:03] he said oh god take me back to that
[32:06] place
[32:09] do you love him less than you used to
[32:11] there's a problem there
[32:13] these ought to be the best days of our
[32:15] lives yes we're going through hardship
[32:18] no
[32:18] we're not going to pretend that it's not
[32:20] hard to have to deal with the things
[32:22] we've had to deal with this year
[32:24] we're not going to pretend that the
[32:25] world's just not everything's fine
[32:26] everybody agrees no
[32:28] everything's not fine but we have a god
[32:30] that's the same
[32:33] oh god take me back to that place
[32:36] take me back to my first love amen
[32:39] take me back to my first love take me
[32:41] back give me back my shepherd's staff
[32:43] give me back my herd of sheep let me
[32:44] alone
[32:45] back there to worship you
[32:50] but see god had a different plan for
[32:53] david
[32:54] there was a time when that's how he
[32:55] dealt with him was with the shepherd's
[32:57] staff
[32:58] there was a time when he was out there
[33:00] by himself and he could
[33:01] he could make the psalms and all those
[33:03] things if you go and look at the psalms
[33:04] you find david talking about green
[33:06] pastures and
[33:07] still waters and all of a sudden you say
[33:09] he says they pierced my hands to my
[33:11] feet.
[33:12] god brought him through something so he
[33:14] could reveal something in him
[33:16] so he could manifest something in his
[33:18] life god brings us through something so
[33:20] we can manifest something in our lives
[33:23] he said sometimes we think that
[33:26] he said but we're in the heat of battle
[33:29] something has got to be done
[33:33] that's the time we live in something has
[33:36] got to be done
[33:38] we can't just lay down anymore
[33:41] it's not always going to feel good when
[33:43] we come to church
[33:45] it's not always going to feel good when
[33:47] we serve god
[33:49] there's going to be hardship there's
[33:50] going to be trial but remember he said
[33:52] i'm with you amen
[33:55] the same god that was with the sin is
[33:56] with us now he said we're in the heat of
[33:58] battle something has got to be done we
[34:00] were boys once
[34:02] we're grown up men now the fight is on
[34:07] he said i remember when the sawdust
[34:09] balled up on the floor and the people
[34:11] screamed and shouted
[34:12] and you couldn't get around the place
[34:14] nowhere here nowhere here for people
[34:16] he said but it's not that way today the
[34:18] battle is on
[34:20] and we want to feel good i want to feel
[34:22] good everybody wants to feel good but
[34:25] battles don't feel good war doesn't feel
[34:28] good
[34:28] but you remember he's still with you
[34:32] amen and i believe that during those
[34:35] times he'll just drop a handful on
[34:37] purpose just it's a little bit of joy a
[34:39] little bit of peace so that you can
[34:40] experience
[34:41] what you had back then it hasn't left
[34:43] you you're just at a different time in
[34:45] your life
[34:47] it's time for grown-up men to stand up
[34:50] and be what they were called to be
[34:52] and so brother brown says oh it's not
[34:55] william branham the little boy preacher
[34:57] anymore
[34:58] you know there was a time and i
[35:00] experienced that i started preaching
[35:01] when i was 12. i know what it's like for
[35:03] people to come hear you just because
[35:05] they never heard somebody that young
[35:06] preach
[35:08] but that's not the way it is anymore you
[35:11] got to produce something
[35:14] right at some point the rubber meets the
[35:16] road you know it's fine when you're
[35:18] young and
[35:19] and my my boy's 13 years old and he he
[35:22] can have his dreams and
[35:23] just take his time and decide what he
[35:25] wants to do it's too late for me
[35:28] i got to produce something there's got
[35:31] to be milk in the fridge
[35:33] got to be bread in the cupboard right at
[35:35] some point you've got to produce
[35:37] something
[35:38] and as mature christians and those of
[35:40] you watching as well
[35:41] as mature christians we have to produce
[35:43] something in our lives
[35:45] we're required to produce something in
[35:47] this hour and it's hard there's a battle
[35:50] but he said i'll be with you during the
[35:52] battle
[35:53] but now he said you got to produce
[35:55] something there's got to be something
[35:56] different the time is
[35:58] on the battle is on the heat is on the
[36:01] time to be delivered he said the people
[36:03] everyone is found written in the book
[36:05] now the time has come
[36:08] brother branham reached that place in
[36:09] his ministry where he couldn't just
[36:11] he couldn't just go along like he used
[36:13] to he had to say something
[36:17] maybe one time the people all flocked in
[36:20] and then he began to
[36:21] open his mouth and preach and teach the
[36:24] word and when he did people began to
[36:25] leave just like they did with jesus
[36:29] and the word become a fugitive
[36:33] that's the way he was when he was here
[36:36] the word become a fugitive everywhere he
[36:37] went they looked to kill him
[36:40] the word today in the earth is a
[36:42] fugitive
[36:44] the bible says that in the slavery in
[36:46] church age in revelations 3 and 20
[36:48] he said behold i stand at the door and
[36:50] knock
[36:51] he said if any man hear my voice and
[36:53] open the door i will come into him and
[36:54] we'll sup with him and he with me
[36:56] why is he knocking he's outside the
[36:58] church
[37:00] the church nominal he's outside they
[37:03] won't let him in
[37:04] they don't want the word the word is a
[37:06] fugitive
[37:08] the word is fugitive the word is
[37:11] rejected the word is not wanted
[37:15] i pray it would never become that way in
[37:16] our churches
[37:19] so we have is the message
[37:22] if we get to where we don't we don't
[37:24] want the message anymore the word
[37:26] becomes a fugitive just tell us
[37:27] something good
[37:28] bump us up and everybody be excited
[37:30] we'll go home but the word becomes a
[37:32] fugitive
[37:33] smile to us tell us we're going to be
[37:35] prosperous tell us everything's going to
[37:36] be going good that the word becomes a
[37:38] fugitive
[37:40] he says they're knocking at the door but
[37:42] there is a people today
[37:43] that the will will believe the word will
[37:46] accept the word will stand with the word
[37:48] and there was a people there with david
[37:49] there was some men who gathered around
[37:51] him there at the cave
[37:53] when they began to gather around him
[37:54] what attracted them to him
[37:56] what was it that attracted there was
[37:58] something about it they believed
[38:00] amen they believed that he would be king
[38:05] oh it's easy to see why warriors would
[38:08] be attracted to saul
[38:11] because saul stood head and shoulders
[38:13] above the rest
[38:15] and saul used denominational methods
[38:20] to attract men to him you remember what
[38:23] he did he cut up the
[38:24] ox and sent it out to everybody he used
[38:27] denominational methods he
[38:29] he showed himself a strong man
[38:32] showed his strength and attracted the
[38:35] people
[38:36] david showed his weakness
[38:41] he's being hunted he's a fugitive the
[38:44] philistines won't take him the moabites
[38:46] won't
[38:46] nobody will take him and so he's running
[38:49] he goes into a cave
[38:51] when he goes into the cave men start to
[38:53] follow him
[38:55] why because they were attracted by
[38:58] something different than just a show
[39:00] of strength there had been many strong
[39:01] men there had been many warlords in that
[39:04] day
[39:04] there was many people who could show a
[39:06] show of strength
[39:08] and there's many people today in the
[39:09] land that can show a show of strength
[39:11] don't be discouraged because you're a
[39:13] little bride
[39:14] because there's many people that can
[39:16] show greater strength
[39:17] many people that can that can be a soul
[39:19] that can be a commanding leader
[39:21] but he's not looking for that he's
[39:23] looking for weakness
[39:25] that he can work through
[39:29] and it's not so much that he uses the
[39:31] weakness but the weakness creates an
[39:33] opportunity right
[39:36] the weakness creates an opportunity
[39:38] because when we're weak he's strong
[39:43] so it's easy to see where they would be
[39:45] attracted to saul maybe the philistine
[39:46] king
[39:47] had had all this money and these
[39:49] warriors it's easy to see why
[39:51] great men like goliath would be
[39:53] attracted to somebody like that
[39:56] but why david
[40:00] and remember david is the type of christ
[40:01] now
[40:03] they were attracted to david first of
[40:04] all because nothing else in their lives
[40:06] had worked out
[40:09] look at the kind of men that they were
[40:12] and we need to be honest about this
[40:14] and say well i have options well not if
[40:16] you come to christ
[40:18] people who come to christ are out of
[40:19] options
[40:23] look what kind of men they were first
[40:25] samuel 22 2 everyone that was in
[40:27] distress
[40:29] everyone that was in debt
[40:32] everyone that was discontented gathered
[40:36] themselves unto him
[40:38] and he become a captain over them and
[40:41] there were with him about
[40:42] 400 men that word distress means a
[40:45] confinement or disability
[40:48] anguish everyone that was anguished
[40:51] everyone that had a disability everyone
[40:54] that was in trouble
[40:56] in distress straightness they didn't
[40:57] know maybe they were being hunted
[40:59] themselves
[41:01] because of the unjust laws that that
[41:03] saul had
[41:04] made and saw was a man who liked to
[41:07] govern by fiat he'd say nobody's going
[41:09] to eat
[41:11] until i figure out why god won't speak
[41:13] to me
[41:14] all right you remember the story and
[41:16] david went down put his staff in the
[41:17] honeycomb
[41:19] and got some honey and i had the
[41:21] strength to fight and david
[41:23] and saul had disabled his own army
[41:26] because god wouldn't speak to him and
[41:27] brother branham
[41:28] type that to denominationalism and you
[41:31] look at it today
[41:32] and realize that that's still the case
[41:34] now
[41:35] here these men were in distress they
[41:38] were in debt
[41:39] and what that means is that they had
[41:41] there were usually the usury laws had
[41:43] not been enforced
[41:45] under the law you couldn't you couldn't
[41:48] put a man unfairly in debt you couldn't
[41:50] charge interest to a brother
[41:52] to another israelite you couldn't do it
[41:54] under the law but
[41:56] but somehow it was being done because
[41:58] under saul's system it didn't really
[42:00] matter
[42:01] you could still do it and so these men
[42:04] didn't
[42:04] fit under saul's reign
[42:07] they just didn't fit in with the laws
[42:10] that he had made
[42:12] and so now they didn't fit in and so
[42:15] their creditors were beating down the
[42:16] door that word means to to lend on
[42:18] interest or to give
[42:19] usury they were discontented
[42:22] and that means to be bitter they were
[42:25] angry
[42:26] bitterly discontented and they were
[42:29] bitter of soul
[42:31] and i like the way a commentator puts
[42:33] this he said not not desirous of new
[42:35] things
[42:36] not just because they were tired of saul
[42:39] not because they were merely
[42:41] dissatisfied with their present
[42:42] condition
[42:44] but those whose anxiety of soul came
[42:47] from the ever worsening condition of the
[42:49] kingdom under saul
[42:51] they could see things weren't going like
[42:52] they're supposed to be going
[42:54] they could see things just kept getting
[42:56] worse and kept getting worse
[42:58] and that drove them to a leader from
[43:01] whom
[43:02] for the future they might hope for
[43:04] better things
[43:08] and i wish you know what people say well
[43:10] where is that leader today i wish i
[43:12] could be that leader i wish someone else
[43:13] could be but that's not the way it works
[43:16] we are driven from leadership of men
[43:19] we're driven from denominationalism to
[43:22] christ the word
[43:24] because we are driven to a leader from
[43:26] whom we hope for the future
[43:28] better things there's nothing better
[43:30] coming out of denominationalism there's
[43:32] nothing better it's not the current
[43:34] condition that attracts us
[43:36] it's the promise that we know that if we
[43:38] stay under his leadership
[43:39] there's better days ahead
[43:43] it's not just well he's going to heal
[43:45] you he's going to take care of you
[43:46] everything's going to be fine no
[43:48] i'm thinking of better days i'm not just
[43:51] looking for healing in my body
[43:52] though i believe in that but i'm looking
[43:54] for complete healing of the body
[43:56] looking for a new body looking for a
[43:59] king to take his throne
[44:02] amen jesus said the same thing in mark
[44:05] chapter 2 and verse 15.
[44:08] it says it come to pass as jesus said at
[44:10] meet in his house many republicans and
[44:11] sinners said also together with jesus
[44:14] and his disciples for there were many
[44:16] and they followed him
[44:18] another place that said the common
[44:20] people heard him gladly
[44:22] they just didn't fit in with the
[44:23] pharisee system
[44:26] john 6 and 68 the disciples didn't fit
[44:29] in either
[44:30] simon peter answered him said lord to
[44:32] whom shall we go
[44:35] we're we're desperate men we've tried
[44:39] everything else
[44:41] thou hast the words of eternal life
[44:46] brother branham said here some time ago
[44:48] i went to an auditorium where another
[44:49] man a fine religious man a good brother
[44:51] famous teacher
[44:53] he said internationally known or
[44:55] nationally anyhow he was kindly
[44:57] opposed of divine healing he said he's
[44:59] changed his mind since then but that
[45:01] afternoon when
[45:02] 15 hundred people was sitting in the
[45:05] auditorium he preached on christ the
[45:07] savior of the world
[45:09] asked people if they'd come down and
[45:10] accept him and there was one woman
[45:11] walked down and shook his hand
[45:13] he said nothing against that he went out
[45:15] the audience was dismissed as
[45:17] congregation went out all nice
[45:18] well-dressed people
[45:19] intelligent looking people nothing wrong
[45:22] with them
[45:23] walking out the minister about his head
[45:25] to the people walked out in a dignified
[45:27] graceful way
[45:28] i thought my that's very nice
[45:32] but here come my group in mind come in
[45:35] on crutches
[45:37] wheelchairs straight jackets what did
[45:40] jesus say they that are whole don't need
[45:41] a physician
[45:43] those that are sick mine come in on
[45:46] crutches wheelchairs straight jackets
[45:48] that's a different thing
[45:49] for your face to buck something like
[45:51] that
[45:55] he says see just to say come down and
[45:57] accept christ and be saved
[45:59] and walk out that's not so bad but when
[46:01] you have to prove what you're talking
[46:03] about
[46:06] and the denominational church today they
[46:08] don't have to prove anything
[46:10] right they can just come and go to
[46:12] church and leave and and be in and
[46:14] some of them good people but they don't
[46:16] have to prove anything
[46:18] because you don't have to live any
[46:19] differently to be a member than you do
[46:21] to be in the world
[46:22] there's nothing to be proved but we we
[46:25] talk of a higher thing
[46:27] and see the thing is people point to bad
[46:30] things that happen
[46:31] to message people or to bible believing
[46:35] people we should say
[46:36] people who really hold to the word of
[46:38] god for this day there's
[46:40] bad things happen among us sure they do
[46:42] people fall people sin there's things
[46:44] that happen
[46:45] and people point to that and say that's
[46:46] awful but that's the way the rest of the
[46:48] world lives
[46:51] we're looking for something better we
[46:54] see something better yes these men were
[46:56] outlaws yes they had troubles
[46:58] financially yes they were distressed yes
[47:00] they had bitterness of soul
[47:02] but but they were discontented for a
[47:04] reason there's something better out
[47:06] there
[47:08] amen we believe that this morning this
[47:11] earth is not our home if coronavirus
[47:13] could teach us anything it ought to
[47:15] teach us that
[47:16] we shouldn't be scared out of our minds
[47:18] about it why because
[47:19] there's a better place there's a better
[47:22] home we're looking for something better
[47:23] david our king the son of david's taking
[47:26] his throne
[47:31] he said you have to prove what you're
[47:32] talking about he said when jesus christ
[47:34] comes down and makes
[47:35] he said but brother as long as it's in
[47:36] his gospel and he promised it
[47:39] don't let one thing shake you because he
[47:42] will do it
[47:44] do we believe that today it's in the
[47:46] gospel he promised it
[47:47] and don't let one thing shake you
[47:49] because he will do it he said he will do
[47:51] it yes sir the only thing you have to do
[47:53] is believe it and ask him to help you
[47:57] and believe that he will and he will
[47:59] take care of the rest of it
[48:02] so they were attracted to david because
[48:06] because they could see that david wasn't
[48:09] a part of that system
[48:11] they were looking for something better
[48:14] they couldn't fit in
[48:15] they didn't have other options they were
[48:18] also attracted to david because he was
[48:19] one of them
[48:22] it wasn't just that they didn't have any
[48:23] other options but david
[48:25] was like them he was being hunted and
[48:28] they were being hunted
[48:30] he was a fugitive they were fugitives
[48:32] saul had never been a fugitive
[48:35] he was always head and shoulders above
[48:37] the rest but david
[48:38] could be touched by their situation
[48:41] because he'd been there
[48:44] he'd become one of them he knew what it
[48:47] was like to be hunted
[48:49] he wasn't some man who couldn't know
[48:50] what it was like to be hungry to be
[48:52] thirsty
[48:52] he had experienced our sorrows aren't
[48:55] you glad that he has experienced christ
[48:57] has experienced our sorrows
[49:00] so if he ever become king he could
[49:02] enforce the laws
[49:03] that saul had refused or failed to
[49:06] enforce
[49:07] now listen they knew
[49:11] that if he ever become king
[49:14] the usury would stop if he ever become
[49:18] king men would stop taking advantage of
[49:21] other men because he knew what it was
[49:22] like
[49:23] to be taken advantage of if he ever
[49:26] become
[49:27] king there'd be worship in the temple
[49:29] again
[49:31] because david knew what it was like to
[49:32] worship
[49:35] if he become king there would be a
[49:37] difference in administration from saul
[49:39] there would be righteousness in the land
[49:42] amen
[49:43] oh church do you realize the same thing
[49:45] is true of christ that when he becomes
[49:47] king there'll be no more sickness when
[49:49] he becomes king there'll be no more
[49:50] death now he's our king now
[49:52] but there's coming a day when he'll
[49:53] establish his kingdom on the earth
[49:56] that's the son of david when he does
[49:58] there will be no more sin there'll be no
[50:00] more heartache there no be no more
[50:01] sorrow
[50:02] it'll be beyond perfection why he's
[50:04] different he's a different kind of
[50:06] administration than what we've
[50:07] experienced in the past
[50:09] this is satan's eden but we're looking
[50:11] for david to be king
[50:14] he was one of us so he knows what we're
[50:16] going through hebrews 4 14
[50:18] he said seeing them and we have a great
[50:19] high priest that is passed into the
[50:21] heavens
[50:22] jesus the son of god let us hold fast
[50:25] our profession
[50:26] for we have not a high priest which
[50:28] cannot be touched with the feeling of
[50:29] our infirmities
[50:31] but was in all points tempted like as we
[50:33] are
[50:34] yet without sin he said let us therefore
[50:38] come boldly unto the throne of grace
[50:42] why do we come boldly because he was
[50:44] tempted like we are
[50:46] amen he could be touched by the feeling
[50:49] of our infirmities
[50:50] so now we can come boldly into the
[50:52] throne of grace that we may obtain
[50:54] mercy and find grace to help in time of
[50:56] need
[50:58] but see if we don't understand that and
[51:02] listen to me on this
[51:03] if we don't understand that and those of
[51:04] you streaming as well i know it's harder
[51:06] to listen at home
[51:08] i've had to do that first time in my
[51:09] life this year that i can remember i've
[51:12] had the stream of service from home not
[51:13] be able to go with what i had
[51:15] chronovirus and it's hard to listen
[51:18] but but just pinch your conscience for a
[51:20] moment because remember
[51:22] a lack of understanding about who he is
[51:26] in his priestly in his high priest
[51:28] office
[51:30] will keep you from receiving the holy
[51:31] ghost and it will keep you from
[51:34] receiving the benefits of the holy ghost
[51:36] do you know that you don't understand
[51:40] that he
[51:40] became you if you don't get that he was
[51:44] a man
[51:46] and so satan tried so hard to fight that
[51:48] and make him a second person
[51:50] or a third person of the trinity but he
[51:51] became us
[51:54] god become a man and then
[51:57] he lived in that body and he experienced
[52:00] those things now
[52:02] if you don't understand that it'll keep
[52:03] you from receiving the holy ghost
[52:05] and i take that from brother branham's
[52:06] message in 1959 he said lord
[52:10] he said if there's one here tonight that
[52:11] you've knocked at their heart's door
[52:14] they haven't received jesus yet let them
[52:17] know that you want to adopt them in the
[52:18] family of abraham
[52:22] you want to oh don't you feel that the
[52:25] choice
[52:25] even delivers you in church you stand
[52:27] there knocking
[52:29] let them know jesus wants you to come in
[52:32] he wants to come into your heart he
[52:33] wants he wants you to be a part
[52:36] of what he's doing in this hour he wants
[52:37] to be to live in your heart
[52:39] living your soul but but people just
[52:42] passed on by
[52:43] but he said if there's one here who
[52:44] hasn't received that let them know that
[52:46] you want to adopt them into the family
[52:48] of abraham
[52:50] and they say well i drink i smoke i
[52:52] gamble or i lie
[52:54] steal or something let them know that
[52:56] all those things are conquered
[52:58] through christ jesus
[53:01] because he was tempted to lie he didn't
[53:04] do it
[53:06] he was tempted to steal sure become poor
[53:09] he was even tempted with women the
[53:11] prophet taught us
[53:13] but he never sinned
[53:17] oh my he was tempted like we were but he
[53:20] was
[53:21] being guarded fleshy he did no sin and
[53:23] he died
[53:24] for us and that perfect one
[53:27] became sin for us and when he becomes
[53:30] sin for us
[53:31] he said let them know that you are
[53:33] tempted in all manner like we are
[53:36] amen and so i took that where
[53:39] you know it could keep you from
[53:40] receiving the holy ghost he said there's
[53:41] many here no doubt lord
[53:43] through frustrations and doubts and
[53:44] worries
[53:46] has failed to receive the holy ghost
[53:49] now think about that and so someone's
[53:52] seeking the holy ghost
[53:53] and i've watched this before and maybe
[53:56] they're even desperate for it and you
[53:57] should be
[53:59] but if you keep frustration in your mind
[54:01] and doubt and worry
[54:03] you'll fail to receive it because you
[54:06] don't realize he was made sin for you
[54:09] he wants to give it to you more than you
[54:11] want to receive it
[54:12] he was tempted in all manner like we are
[54:15] and so you become so concerned about
[54:17] what's going on in your life that you
[54:18] can't receive him
[54:22] well i i've got this this problem
[54:25] if i could ever quit smoking then he
[54:27] would come no he wants to
[54:29] give you a new desire
[54:32] if i could ever quit gambling if i could
[54:34] ever quit looking at the wrong things on
[54:36] the internet i
[54:37] i i'd come to him then no he was tempted
[54:40] in all like manner
[54:42] like you are to take your sin
[54:46] he said let them know he said that you
[54:49] are tempted you were tempted in all that
[54:51] manner like we are yet without sin you
[54:53] took
[54:53] our place and conquered the enemy by
[54:56] your righteous life
[55:00] he's imputed righteousness to us
[55:04] right it's not that we can do it on our
[55:06] own well i'll quit
[55:07] lying i'll quit drinking i'll quit
[55:09] smoking no he imputes righteousness to
[55:11] you
[55:11] and then you quit lying you quit
[55:14] drinking you quit smoking why
[55:16] because he lived for you and he died
[55:20] for you now look he said
[55:23] you took our place and conquered the
[55:24] enemy by your righteous life that we who
[55:26] are unrighteous can still have the
[55:27] victory
[55:28] as we believe on you and claim the
[55:31] promise
[55:32] so those fears and misunderstandings
[55:34] doubts worries frustrations can keep you
[55:36] from receiving the holy ghost
[55:38] because you don't realize he's already
[55:40] taken care of your sin
[55:44] now look they were attracted to david
[55:47] because he was one of them they had that
[55:49] understanding they were attracted to
[55:52] david because they believed
[55:55] so important they believed that he would
[55:58] be king
[56:03] and all they maybe heard was the story
[56:07] that the prophet had anointed him to be
[56:10] king
[56:11] but they held to that they couldn't
[56:15] prove it they didn't
[56:16] they didn't have any maybe they weren't
[56:17] even there probably
[56:19] probably none of them were these were
[56:21] gentiles
[56:22] gentile warriors who come with david but
[56:24] why were they attracted to him because
[56:26] they believed it
[56:29] amen they believed he would be king
[56:32] and what did what did peter say to jesus
[56:35] after he said to whom should we go he
[56:38] said and we believe
[56:40] john 6 69 we believe and are sure that
[56:43] thou art
[56:44] that christ the son of the living god
[56:47] we're sure we weren't there
[56:50] at the virgin birth we we didn't hear
[56:52] the angel speak to mary but we're sure
[56:55] amen why there's something there in the
[56:57] heart that can believe
[56:59] brother branham picks it up and why
[57:01] little bethlehem he said how in the
[57:02] world
[57:03] can it ever come to pass
[57:07] the devil on both sides driving at david
[57:10] we feel that way today don't we kind of
[57:11] pinch
[57:12] in between the devil on all sides
[57:14] sickness over on this side
[57:16] and here's the the world over on this
[57:18] side pressing on us and the politics and
[57:20] things
[57:21] coming on both sides the devil on both
[57:23] sides driving at david
[57:24] he said he had taken refuge in
[57:26] strongholds in the wilderness
[57:27] and in caves trying to hide out with a
[57:30] little band of faithful warriors
[57:32] just a few believing like him but those
[57:35] men believed god
[57:38] that that would be the king he said so
[57:41] is the believers today
[57:43] who's hid out from place to place but
[57:46] yet they know who is coming to be king
[57:49] and brother randall says this i think
[57:50] this is opportune for this time now he
[57:52] said this in 1958 when there was an
[57:54] election coming up in 1960
[57:57] but he said who he said i don't care who
[57:59] is going to be president
[58:01] we know he's coming
[58:05] oh it's all right we can get excited
[58:07] about one or the other but he's coming
[58:10] i wasn't put on this earth to make a
[58:12] certain person president
[58:14] i was put on this earth to make him king
[58:17] are you with me now i don't care who's
[58:20] going to be president
[58:21] sure one one might be better than the
[58:23] other but i want him to be king
[58:28] we know he's coming and looks farther
[58:29] away than it ever did
[58:32] he said when science is trying to
[58:34] overrule and say they can build a man
[58:35] they can do this they can take a rabbit
[58:37] take the paul and make another rabbit
[58:38] and so forth trying to disprove god's
[58:40] word he's talking about cloning
[58:42] which i didn't even know existed back
[58:43] when this was
[58:45] written in 1958 but he said yet there is
[58:48] a people who believe god
[58:50] who stands just as pat as they ever did
[58:56] he said no matter what comes or goes
[58:58] they still believe
[58:59] god god is right they hold to god's
[59:03] unchanging
[59:05] hands in the midst of battle
[59:08] amen that's where we're at today in the
[59:11] midst of battle
[59:12] in the midst of tears in the midst of
[59:14] sickness and death and everything
[59:16] amen are you with me this morning church
[59:19] in the midst of sickness in the midst of
[59:21] battle in the midst of tears
[59:22] in the midst of everything they still
[59:24] hold to god's unchanging hand
[59:26] they know that he's coming king it's not
[59:29] just something they think is going to
[59:30] happen or they wish would happen
[59:32] but they know and so they don't get
[59:34] caught up in the things of the world
[59:36] because they know
[59:37] he's coming king i can tell you what i
[59:39] think is going to happen in the election
[59:41] but i don't know
[59:42] but we know he's going to be king i can
[59:45] tell you what i think is going to happen
[59:46] with the coronavirus what i think is
[59:48] going to happen with the church
[59:49] but we don't know but we know he's going
[59:51] to be king
[59:52] amen and we still hold to god's
[59:54] unchanging hand because we know
[59:56] that he is coming king why because the
[59:58] word of god says so and sons of god
[1:00:00] believe the word of god
[1:00:03] amen we know he's coming king
[1:00:08] they believed he would be king so the
[1:00:11] scripture our text said that they
[1:00:12] strengthened themselves
[1:00:14] to fight to make him king
[1:00:18] they strengthen themselves today
[1:00:22] we ask god for strength we want him to
[1:00:24] give us strength
[1:00:26] but we need to examine our modus many
[1:00:28] times
[1:00:30] why do we want strength is it to build a
[1:00:33] kingdom
[1:00:34] or to make him king
[1:00:38] why do we want strength i i want this
[1:00:41] church to be full
[1:00:43] every view her chair whatever
[1:00:46] i want it to be full sure we do why
[1:00:50] would we want anything less
[1:00:51] but why do we want strength
[1:00:56] we want to have an influence on our
[1:00:57] community but why
[1:00:59] is it to build our own kingdom to make
[1:01:02] the name of
[1:01:03] our pastor or the name of the church
[1:01:05] great in the community
[1:01:06] or is it to make him king
[1:01:11] is it to prove it that's why so many
[1:01:12] people get excited when something bad
[1:01:14] happens to somebody from another church
[1:01:19] just hang with me for a minute something
[1:01:20] bad happened to somebody else and people
[1:01:21] get all excited
[1:01:22] oh where that that man that'll bring
[1:01:24] them down so we can come up that's the
[1:01:26] way the gentiles work
[1:01:27] that's the cosmos that's the way this
[1:01:29] world works without the way christians
[1:01:31] work
[1:01:32] we're not building a kingdom here in
[1:01:34] this church
[1:01:36] we're making him king if that means i
[1:01:39] have to preach to 20 people or 50 people
[1:01:41] or 100 people doesn't matter
[1:01:42] i want to make him king
[1:01:46] my job here is not to make me king it's
[1:01:49] not to consolidate my power until i have
[1:01:51] power over the deacons in power over the
[1:01:52] trustees and power of the song leader
[1:01:54] that's not my job my job is to make him
[1:01:57] king
[1:01:58] to give him the preeminence amen to
[1:02:00] create an atmosphere brother david
[1:02:02] that's our job
[1:02:02] create an atmosphere so that the the
[1:02:05] king can
[1:02:06] come amen so the king can be in our
[1:02:09] midst
[1:02:11] we don't want to build our own kingdoms
[1:02:12] we want to make him king
[1:02:14] then when we enforce the laws when we
[1:02:16] when we have discipline
[1:02:18] whatever it is in the church we're doing
[1:02:19] it not for our own kingdom
[1:02:21] we're not doing just to make ourselves
[1:02:22] feel better to have power with the
[1:02:23] people
[1:02:24] we do it to make him king we want him to
[1:02:27] be king and he can't be king if we
[1:02:29] refuse if we just look and
[1:02:30] take sin and just leave it there no
[1:02:32] we've got to deal with it because
[1:02:33] we make him king
[1:02:37] the word is made king oh my
[1:02:41] that's why we want to be strengthened
[1:02:44] second samuel 23 and hey let's look at
[1:02:46] these men real quickly
[1:02:49] he said these be the names of the mighty
[1:02:50] men whom david had
[1:02:52] the tachmanite that said in the seat the
[1:02:55] word means the man full of wisdom the
[1:02:56] tachmanian
[1:02:58] chief among the captains so somebody had
[1:03:01] to be
[1:03:01] chief uh somebody had to be chief
[1:03:05] huh but they worked together now look
[1:03:08] chief among the captains the same was
[1:03:09] adino the s night he lift up his spear
[1:03:11] against 800
[1:03:12] whom he sue at one time that's a pretty
[1:03:16] powerful ministry he's got but why did
[1:03:19] he do it
[1:03:21] what did he do what was he fighting for
[1:03:24] to make david king
[1:03:28] and so you find in verse 9 it says after
[1:03:32] him with eliezer the son of dodo the aoi
[1:03:35] one of the three mighty men with david
[1:03:36] when they defied the philistines that
[1:03:38] were there
[1:03:38] gathered together to battle and the men
[1:03:40] of israel was gone away
[1:03:42] euros and smote the philistines
[1:03:46] until his hand was weary
[1:03:49] god give us some men like these
[1:03:53] some men and women that'll stand for god
[1:03:55] until their hand gets weary
[1:03:58] he said his hand got weary and his hand
[1:04:01] claven to the sword he got home that
[1:04:03] night and he couldn't even
[1:04:04] he couldn't even release his grip
[1:04:07] because he'd held on for so long
[1:04:08] god help me to fight like that to fight
[1:04:11] the devil like that
[1:04:12] as buddy robinson said i'll i'll fight
[1:04:15] him till he said i'll bite him joey
[1:04:16] ain't got no teeth
[1:04:17] he said and then i'll gum him to death
[1:04:22] and so that's what we have to have that
[1:04:24] we have to have a will to do that he had
[1:04:26] a will to stand there wide to make him
[1:04:28] king
[1:04:30] notice the difference in these
[1:04:31] ministries the difference in the way it
[1:04:33] operated in these men
[1:04:34] here was a great man who stood with a
[1:04:35] spear against 800. here was a man who
[1:04:37] had a sword
[1:04:38] and his hand claimed to his sword and
[1:04:41] the lord brought a great victory that
[1:04:42] day
[1:04:43] and the people were turned after him
[1:04:44] only to spoil
[1:04:46] verse 11 after him was shamma the son of
[1:04:49] aegee the heroic
[1:04:50] and the philistines were gathered
[1:04:52] together into a troop
[1:04:54] where there was a piece of ground full
[1:04:55] of lentils
[1:04:57] that barley and the people fled from the
[1:05:00] philistines
[1:05:01] but he stood in the midst of the ground
[1:05:04] and defended it these other men maybe
[1:05:08] they got to go out and
[1:05:09] evangelize but this man stood in the
[1:05:11] midst of the ground
[1:05:14] through his position right in the midst
[1:05:16] of the barley
[1:05:19] he wasn't the greatest but he was needed
[1:05:23] he stood in the midst of the ground and
[1:05:24] defended it and slew the philistines and
[1:05:26] the lord wrought a great
[1:05:28] victory
[1:05:32] and these were the the chief men now
[1:05:34] these three men
[1:05:36] were special it says because three of
[1:05:39] the thirty chief went down and came to
[1:05:41] david
[1:05:42] in the harvest time into the cave of
[1:05:43] adullam
[1:05:45] that's the time when david was at his
[1:05:48] lowest point
[1:05:52] it's a time when he was being rejected
[1:05:54] by from all sides
[1:05:56] these men come down to see how he was
[1:06:01] spend some time with him when they got
[1:06:04] down there
[1:06:05] and begin to be around him see you've
[1:06:07] got to be around him to know
[1:06:09] what it is that you can do for him
[1:06:12] before you can be a real servant of the
[1:06:14] king
[1:06:14] you got to spend time in his presence
[1:06:17] and that's why brother branham taught us
[1:06:18] as ministers to
[1:06:19] shut ourselves off and take time
[1:06:22] away from everybody for a while before
[1:06:24] the service because while we do that we
[1:06:26] come out and
[1:06:27] and somebody new may not understand that
[1:06:29] but we come out when the
[1:06:30] they call us out because we want to take
[1:06:32] even if it's just a few minutes time
[1:06:36] to get along with god because you learn
[1:06:38] what he wants
[1:06:40] when you get near him right
[1:06:43] now they come down and the troop of the
[1:06:46] philistines
[1:06:46] patched in the pitch in the valley of
[1:06:49] rephain
[1:06:50] and david was then in the hold and the
[1:06:53] garrison of the philistines was then in
[1:06:54] bethlehem he was in the cave
[1:06:56] of a dolan a stronghold and david longed
[1:07:04] david longed it was a private moment but
[1:07:08] they were near enough to him
[1:07:09] by the jt that they could know what he
[1:07:11] what he desired
[1:07:14] god help me to be close enough to him
[1:07:18] see peter james and john i don't we
[1:07:20] don't know exactly why but somehow they
[1:07:22] become close enough to jesus
[1:07:24] that when the time come for him to go up
[1:07:26] to gethsemane he had him come with him
[1:07:30] maybe the others had things to do we
[1:07:32] don't know but he had them come
[1:07:33] they were close enough they leaned on
[1:07:35] his muslim and david long said oh that
[1:07:37] one would give me drink of the water the
[1:07:39] well of bethlehem
[1:07:41] which is by the gate
[1:07:44] brother branham does such a masterful
[1:07:47] job of
[1:07:48] preaching on this and they're talking
[1:07:51] about
[1:07:51] in during that sermon of why little
[1:07:54] bethlehem he said david in all his
[1:07:56] frustrations
[1:07:58] walking back and forth thinking oh this
[1:08:00] hot day
[1:08:01] he said oh it's so hot oh saul might
[1:08:03] come from this way
[1:08:04] the philistines from this way armies
[1:08:06] around everywhere
[1:08:08] and here we are sitting in the mouth of
[1:08:10] a cave
[1:08:11] and yet the anointing oil on me how can
[1:08:13] it be oh god how can it be
[1:08:15] oh i wish i had a drink and his mind
[1:08:18] goes back to way down there by the gates
[1:08:20] of bethlehem
[1:08:22] there was a well there was just no water
[1:08:25] like that water
[1:08:27] he said now his throat is going yet
[1:08:29] anointed he said oh if i only had a
[1:08:31] drink of water
[1:08:32] now his warriors he screamed out on his
[1:08:34] despair oh someone
[1:08:36] would bring me a drink again from that
[1:08:38] old well yonder at bethlehem
[1:08:41] he said oh after dreaming all of his
[1:08:43] childhood days and the victories
[1:08:45] and see him in the place where he's
[1:08:46] sitting here between the fires he
[1:08:47] screamed
[1:08:49] oh somebody could bring me water from
[1:08:52] bethlehem
[1:08:55] he didn't pick those men out to do it
[1:08:58] but they were there they were close
[1:09:02] somebody bring me a drink remember he's
[1:09:05] a type
[1:09:06] of christ he's a type of christ
[1:09:13] once you've had a drink of bethlehem is
[1:09:15] the water you don't want nothing else
[1:09:18] you see when jesus died and and he
[1:09:21] brought his spirit back on the on the
[1:09:23] third day
[1:09:24] and then he come on the day of pentecost
[1:09:26] and and
[1:09:28] separated himself into the hearts of the
[1:09:31] 120 men and women that were there and
[1:09:34] when he did they become his body
[1:09:37] and they began to offer to god the kind
[1:09:41] of fellowship that he'd never had before
[1:09:46] think about that even when he was with
[1:09:49] adam
[1:09:51] it was god and adam but now it was god
[1:09:53] in his people
[1:09:57] think about that he'd never had this
[1:10:00] kind of fellowship with human beings
[1:10:02] that he could come down and live in them
[1:10:06] redeemed bodies amen
[1:10:09] he could fellowship his brother brandon
[1:10:11] put it with his thoughts in a way that
[1:10:13] he couldn't
[1:10:13] had never been able to do before and so
[1:10:15] he's fellowshipping with them
[1:10:17] in such a way that when they went out
[1:10:19] even they passed by in the shadow
[1:10:21] of peter people would get healed
[1:10:24] they would go by and they would say
[1:10:25] silver and gold have i numb but such as
[1:10:27] i have i give
[1:10:28] and a lame men got up and walked in
[1:10:31] their services there was such a
[1:10:33] passion for god and such a a worship
[1:10:36] that would go up we don't know exactly
[1:10:38] what they had i don't know if they had
[1:10:39] drums
[1:10:40] i don't know if they had an organ or
[1:10:41] piano what they had i don't know what
[1:10:43] they have but i know
[1:10:44] this they worshipped
[1:10:48] they worshipped there was something
[1:10:49] about it they met in caves and they were
[1:10:51] persecuted and they
[1:10:53] they met in any place they could meet
[1:10:55] they wanted to be together
[1:10:56] they defied death to be together why
[1:10:59] because they wanted to worship god
[1:11:05] so we we should forgive people who you
[1:11:08] know if
[1:11:09] let me just tell you the heart as a
[1:11:12] pastor
[1:11:13] you know i hate i don't want to tell
[1:11:14] anybody not to come to church it goes
[1:11:16] against everything in my thinking
[1:11:18] i'll forgive people for wanting to come
[1:11:20] to church and messing up
[1:11:22] it's easy to forgive people like that
[1:11:24] maybe come to church when they shouldn't
[1:11:27] the problem you have is with people who
[1:11:28] don't come to church when they should
[1:11:34] but but but regardless it's you know
[1:11:36] because it's in our heart it's not
[1:11:38] something god they make us do it's not
[1:11:39] something that
[1:11:40] jesus made them do but he was in their
[1:11:43] hearts
[1:11:45] so they gathered together in spite of
[1:11:46] persecution and trouble and
[1:11:48] i know i'm not saying anything i'm the
[1:11:50] one that said stay home if you're sick
[1:11:52] and
[1:11:52] we have to do that but listen we have to
[1:11:55] communicate with god
[1:11:57] and we at some point we have to
[1:11:59] fellowship with one another
[1:12:01] we have to because there's a desire in
[1:12:04] our heart to do it
[1:12:07] he had a drink of that jesus
[1:12:11] that spirit that was when we got to
[1:12:13] fellowship with them in such a way
[1:12:15] purity of the word purity of spirit
[1:12:19] but it wasn't long until that church
[1:12:20] lost their first love the antichrist
[1:12:22] began to work immediately
[1:12:24] that church lost their first love the
[1:12:26] little bride that he had
[1:12:28] began to be spotted by denominationalism
[1:12:30] by man over man
[1:12:32] nicoleton teaching
[1:12:35] so now david's the type of christ
[1:12:38] david christ said oh that you would give
[1:12:41] me a drink
[1:12:45] oh then i would have a drink and the
[1:12:48] three mighty men break through the hosts
[1:12:49] of the philistines and drew water
[1:12:51] out of the well of bethlehem that was by
[1:12:52] the gate and took it and brought it to
[1:12:54] david
[1:12:54] and david wouldn't drink it but he
[1:12:56] poured it out into the lord
[1:12:58] which is a type again of christ amen
[1:13:02] jesus cried i thirst but he wouldn't
[1:13:04] drink
[1:13:06] he poured out his spirit on the day of
[1:13:07] pentecost
[1:13:10] what was it it was a desire that he had
[1:13:13] think about it
[1:13:15] he has not had that kind of fellowship
[1:13:20] listen to me now from that time
[1:13:25] until recently
[1:13:29] i hope we appreciate the message of the
[1:13:31] hour i hope we understand why the
[1:13:33] prophet said behold i send you elijah
[1:13:37] to turn the hearts of the children back
[1:13:39] to those pentecostal fathers
[1:13:42] very bad because elijah's message come
[1:13:45] to turn us back
[1:13:48] so he could have that drink again
[1:13:53] amen he looked for it all to the church
[1:13:57] ages he longed for it but elijah's
[1:13:59] message come
[1:14:02] to turn our hearts back he put a sword
[1:14:06] in his hand
[1:14:09] didn't he do it supernatural the word
[1:14:12] the king's sword put a sword in his hand
[1:14:16] what for to fight for the water
[1:14:20] are you with me now
[1:14:24] and brother said look at these men what
[1:14:27] were they doing they were making david
[1:14:28] king
[1:14:31] one day he'll be king he'll be on the
[1:14:33] earth but just for one service
[1:14:36] i want to make him feel like a king
[1:14:37] again
[1:14:40] are you with me this morning i want to
[1:14:42] make him feel like a king again
[1:14:44] i wanted i want him to know what it's
[1:14:46] like to have people waiting on him
[1:14:48] and listening for his very desire and to
[1:14:52] have it brought to him i want him to
[1:14:54] taste that pentecostal
[1:14:56] water again he said look at these men
[1:14:58] they pulled their swords what was it
[1:15:00] his desire was a drink of cool water he
[1:15:03] said david what a type today of our
[1:15:05] david christ
[1:15:07] amen it was they pulled their shorts
[1:15:10] notice he said we know he's called a
[1:15:13] holy roller
[1:15:15] he's cast off to one side a fanatic and
[1:15:18] everything rejected by the churches
[1:15:21] they've got their creeds and things
[1:15:22] drawn up this christmas he
[1:15:24] preached this at christmas time and this
[1:15:26] is from 1963 he preached the message
[1:15:28] twice but in 1963 he said we know that
[1:15:32] he said but we know that this word ever
[1:15:34] remains true
[1:15:36] he said it's got to be fulfilled and the
[1:15:38] desire of christ is for men
[1:15:41] warriors to stand
[1:15:45] and the prophet in our day stood up was
[1:15:48] given a sword
[1:15:51] right say well let him do it you know
[1:15:56] you know it might have been i don't know
[1:15:57] maybe the chief among them
[1:15:59] stood up because that's kind of man he
[1:16:01] was
[1:16:02] stood up i got a sword
[1:16:06] another man looked around and said well
[1:16:08] he i don't want him to go down there by
[1:16:09] himself
[1:16:11] this is what david really wants i got a
[1:16:13] sword
[1:16:16] another man said well i got a bucket
[1:16:20] somebody had to carry a bucket
[1:16:24] somebody got carry the water so they oh
[1:16:27] my
[1:16:29] he said they pulled their swords and
[1:16:31] that's the desire of christ for men
[1:16:32] warriors to stand he said oh come
[1:16:35] stand with me by my side
[1:16:38] he's not just talking to preachers he's
[1:16:41] talking to you
[1:16:43] he's talking to me somebody will stand
[1:16:45] by his side we're not standing by
[1:16:49] the side of this message we don't but we
[1:16:51] don't stand here to make brother branham
[1:16:52] king
[1:16:53] we stand here to make jesus king and we
[1:16:56] do that by following the prophet of the
[1:16:59] age the message that he brought
[1:17:01] because god gave him a sword now he said
[1:17:04] draw your swords
[1:17:06] amen hallelujah
[1:17:11] it may not have been their idea but they
[1:17:14] were sure willing to help out
[1:17:17] amen now look
[1:17:21] he said oh come stand with me by my side
[1:17:24] i'm standing in a terrible place listen
[1:17:26] i don't stand here because i want to
[1:17:28] preempt brother bryan i'm gonna take him
[1:17:30] out of the pulpit but i'm standing here
[1:17:31] because he's
[1:17:32] he's stood in a terrible place i want to
[1:17:34] stand with him
[1:17:37] and if that's not our desire if our
[1:17:39] desire is to make our own kingdom we
[1:17:40] might as well shut the doors
[1:17:42] because the baptists have a bigger
[1:17:43] kingdom and the methodists have a bigger
[1:17:45] kingdom and the catholics have a bigger
[1:17:46] kingdom
[1:17:47] we just go join them
[1:17:50] and they got 401ks and everything to go
[1:17:52] with it
[1:17:56] i mean not bad but there's many message
[1:17:57] preachers maybe not all of us but some
[1:18:00] of them that are really good
[1:18:01] they could probably go preach in another
[1:18:02] church you know preaching the message
[1:18:04] because that's where they make the most
[1:18:05] money
[1:18:08] you know you didn't join the or become a
[1:18:10] part of this church because you just
[1:18:11] like it was easy to go here
[1:18:14] because it requires more of you than
[1:18:16] than just being anywhere you want to be
[1:18:18] there's more required of those who would
[1:18:20] stand with him in this day
[1:18:23] but he said oh come stand with me by my
[1:18:25] side
[1:18:26] i'm standing in a terrible place i
[1:18:28] challenge today
[1:18:29] he said these tapes go over the world i
[1:18:32] challenge some man
[1:18:33] some warrior who loves jesus christ
[1:18:37] we got anybody here today lord jesus
[1:18:40] christ you there
[1:18:41] watching today do you love jesus christ
[1:18:45] then stand with the prophet of the hour
[1:18:50] stand with him amen he said that knows
[1:18:54] that these things has got to be
[1:18:55] fulfilled today
[1:18:57] brethren come stand by my side and pull
[1:18:59] the word of god
[1:19:01] forget these tried systems and stagnated
[1:19:04] denominations you're living in
[1:19:06] pull the fresh word of god he said let's
[1:19:10] give
[1:19:10] jesus a good drink a fresh pentecostal
[1:19:13] water
[1:19:14] that's his desire today back to original
[1:19:17] pentecost
[1:19:18] back to the word in the heat of the
[1:19:19] battle in the in the heat of laodicea
[1:19:21] that the word cries out
[1:19:23] oh for a drink amen
[1:19:27] the word cries out all for a drink of
[1:19:30] the water of bethlehem and there's some
[1:19:31] soldiers who'll stand there
[1:19:33] with the prophet of the hour and say
[1:19:34] i'll be one who will fight for him
[1:19:38] amen i'll fight with the prophet and
[1:19:41] i'll fight to make david king
[1:19:43] are you with me now because that's what
[1:19:46] he fought for
[1:19:48] now look that's his desire today
[1:19:51] he said it's prophesied that we do so
[1:19:55] amen it's prophesied we do so in malachi
[1:19:58] the fourth chapter
[1:19:59] return the faith of the children back to
[1:20:01] the fathers again who would stand this
[1:20:03] morning
[1:20:04] like david we know that david is coming
[1:20:06] into power
[1:20:07] jesus christ is going to take the world
[1:20:10] he inherits the earth he is going to be
[1:20:13] king over the earth
[1:20:15] he's rejected today he's a fugitive
[1:20:18] among his people
[1:20:19] of course he's a fugitive to the world
[1:20:21] always was but today he's a fugitive to
[1:20:23] his own church they reject him
[1:20:26] they love their creeds and big
[1:20:27] dignitaries instead of the word
[1:20:29] do you realize if it was put to a
[1:20:30] popular vote the word would lose in
[1:20:33] every municipality and every state
[1:20:35] in every country in the world
[1:20:38] if you put it to a popular vote no one
[1:20:40] will stand with him but he's still going
[1:20:41] to be king
[1:20:43] amen you see there's a garrison of
[1:20:45] philistines around
[1:20:47] the word today said they he said they
[1:20:49] won't let it be manifested
[1:20:51] he said they won't let it be preached in
[1:20:53] its power
[1:20:54] they've cut away from it just like the
[1:20:56] bible said they do in revelation 17.
[1:20:58] he said what are they going to do going
[1:21:00] up here today and all going in this
[1:21:02] council of churches catholicism and
[1:21:04] protestantism uniting together
[1:21:06] making the mark in the image of the
[1:21:08] beast and then on down he says oh you
[1:21:10] bethlehem dwellers hallelujah
[1:21:12] i call for men warriors
[1:21:16] is not afraid i don't care if there's
[1:21:19] 800 standing on one side
[1:21:21] 10 000 on the others the other i want
[1:21:24] warriors
[1:21:25] who will come with me amen and cut a
[1:21:28] hole
[1:21:29] through this sign of unbelieving
[1:21:30] philistines the world council has got
[1:21:33] garrisoned around the word of god
[1:21:34] trying to make it creeds and feed the
[1:21:36] people
[1:21:39] where's the man who could pull his sword
[1:21:40] and stand there with a prophet of the
[1:21:42] hour
[1:21:43] it's hard to do because men begin to
[1:21:45] strengthen themselves and begin to think
[1:21:46] hey
[1:21:47] i killed 800 at one time maybe i ought
[1:21:50] to be king
[1:21:53] hey i stood in the midst of the barley
[1:21:55] i've been here for 40 years maybe i
[1:21:57] ought to be king
[1:21:58] no their desire was to make him king
[1:22:03] amen god help us today
[1:22:06] he said there's a well you believe
[1:22:08] there's still a well today

[1:22:13] in the house of david bethlehem

[1:23:07] to know that he's still god

[1:23:59] pentecostal water
[1:24:01] he said original pentecost original

[1:24:08] hollering here he said i mean a genuine
[1:24:11] holy spirit
[1:24:12] baptism that produces the life of jesus
[1:24:15] christ
[1:24:16] back into the person he had a drink like
[1:24:20] that
[1:24:21] with 120 that come from the upper room
[1:24:24] but that seed had to fall into the
[1:24:26] ground and die to produce another
[1:24:29] another fruit another bride tree
[1:24:32] a restoration of the bride tree
[1:24:35] that we could come today and give him a
[1:24:37] drink

[1:24:57] cooperate to make david king
[1:25:02] if you haven't heard anything else i've
[1:25:03] said today hear this
[1:25:06] they had to cooperate with one another
[1:25:09] to make david king
[1:25:11] one of them had to put down his sword
[1:25:12] just carry a bucket probably
[1:25:16] to make him king they couldn't say well
[1:25:18] i'll go this way you go that way no they
[1:25:20] fought together
[1:25:21] i took all three of them the the chief
[1:25:24] captain and the one standing with him

[1:25:28] by me stand by me there's got to be
[1:25:30] somebody who will represent at this hour

[1:25:58] him king

[1:26:08] be willing
[1:26:10] to make yourself less
[1:26:13] sometimes to make him king you've got to
[1:26:15] lay down your own ministries

[1:28:25] did but i don't want notoriety
[1:28:28] the greatest thing you can say about a
[1:28:30] servant is he made his lord famous

[1:28:37] lord may we be in a way
[1:28:41] as your bride lord may we be like that

[1:29:12] there's a people
[1:29:14] who exist solely to make jesus king
[1:29:17] even in that first age with all the
[1:29:19] persecution and all the
[1:29:21] all the trouble that goes on went on

[1:29:33] one thing for us to call ourselves a
[1:29:35] christian but lord
