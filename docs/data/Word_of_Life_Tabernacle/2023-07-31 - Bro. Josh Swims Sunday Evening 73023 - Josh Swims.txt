afternoon amen are you going to pull on the word of God amen every Ministry is unique and different but we have the opportunity to just pull on the word and and take a preacher out of himself where he

in the house of the Lord and for the Ben City uh surprise you tonight so surprise I'm a brother Josh we'll swim some of you know me some of you don't I see a bunch of faces I don't know so God bless you for being here this evening and uh as brother Ben silver from Brother Bill Ivey's Church at uh Living Word Tabernacle over in Missouri and we had a new brother man for a long time so about he was at with us for about 10 years or so and so we uh we had we got to know each other for quite a bit there so anyway God bless you we'll just get straight to the word this evening and uh we'll just see how the Lord leads and I'd like to kind of we'll look at we're going to look in the book of Ephesians this afternoon Ephesians chapter 2 and verse we're going to read in verse 11 but we're probably going to cover most of chapter two uh Lord permitting so we'll just see what kind of time we have and things like that uh we'll just go from here Ephesians chapter two and let's read verse 11. it says wherefore remember that you being in time past he says Gentiles in the flesh who are called uncircumcision by that which is called the circumcision In the Flesh he says made by hands that at that time he says you were without Christ it says being aliens from the Commonwealth of Israel and strangers from the covenants of promise he says having no hope and without God in the world but notice what verse 13 says he said but now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were afar off is that are made now by the blood of Christ just by our history word of prayer this afternoon Heavenly Father Lord we just thank you for allowing us to be able to assemble ourselves together with Saints of light precious Faith this afternoon but we just pray that you would just calm our nerves now Lord and just Lord help us as minister of the Gospel to help me to get myself out of the way this afternoon Lord and that that it would be you speaking to your people Lord and Lord as the the hearers that would hear this word here here in the building or wherever it may go Lord I pray that Lord that they could get theirselves out of the way Lord Lord that they could receive exactly whatever it is that they have need of there may be one here that has need of healing tonight maybe one that has need of Salvation or Deliverance of of some Demon or something Lord we know that you're more than able to take care of every situation in every condition here tonight Lord we just pray that Lord that you just help us to completely yield ourselves into the Holy Spirit now just have your way in everything that's said and done we ask in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen God bless you you can have your seats this evening as I said it's uh just good to be here this evening and been uh I guess it's been a couple years since we've been over and just brother Ben's asked me a couple of times and we just we could never get together so anyway we finally made it happen so we're just we're glad to be here so like I said if if possible this evening maybe we can look at uh here in the book of Ephesians and and uh we know that the teachings that brother Branham or the prophet of God we know that the teachings of brother Brown we can find in the message that the book of Ephesians it positionally places the believer amen is that right we we know how that brother Branham he tied that the book of Ephesians in with Joshua and how they positionally places the believer in Christ Jesus and how that you know that how that God whatever in the in the Book of Joshua it's just like it is with you and me this evening church in the Book of Joshua hear God he come down and he was speaking with Joshua and after he left the scene and hear God's speaking with Joshua and he says as I was with Joshua so will I also be with you yeah and here Joshua he was one that could we say that he carried the briefcase for Moses he was one that seen all of Moses's faults all of his failures he's seen that his temper and The Temptations and the strife and the things that he had to go through we have that same promise here tonight church that as I was can we say with brother Branham or with it with these ministers a past past days I'll be with you the the message didn't pass off the scene when when brother Branham passed off the scene we still have the we still have the same promises this evening that that they had in times past right so as I was with Joshua as I was with Moses or as I was with Moses as I was with these I'll be with you here this evening amen so we have that that positionally that positioning message this evening that Jose's positionally places us in Christ Jesus amen listen let's look at uh Ephesians chapter one and we're as I said we'll we're going to get over in Ephesians chapter two but I just got a few scriptures here that I'd like to read and and I probably may be a little different than some of your message preachers but I like to read a lot of scripture and uh it but that's where our message comes from it's brother Branham he never pointed himself or never pointed the message to himself but he showed us in the where it come from in the scriptures amen so here in Ephesians chapter 1 in verse 13 it says in whom you also trusted after that you heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation says in whom also after that you believed he says you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise he says which is the earnest church he said it's the earnest of our inheritance unto the Redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory listen we're still for the Holy Ghost this evening we're still with the Holy Spirit of promise and we know that word sealed we know from what brother Brown said in the message he said it signified a finished work is that right it signifies that you're a finished work this evening you've been positionally placed in Christ Jesus you're a finished work yeah we're we're knowing that we're able to rest upon the things of God Amen we don't have to worry about what Biden's doing we don't have to worry about the Democrats we don't have to worry about all the strife and the things that are going on all the war all the wars that's taking place and things like that we're able to rest in that church well the world's worried about their 401ks and how they're they're not going to be able to retire and all this God's got it under control we have that we have that promise in the Bible that we're able to claim that amen we're able to hold on to those Securities this evening the Lord is places down payment on you and me amen it means security right right a seal means security means ownership it means completion this evening see the Lord his place is down payment on you and me it gave you a small portion of what is to come you do you realize that this evening you have a small portion of Eternity right here you understand that this scene amen a small portion of what is to come it right it rests right in here and we're going to get into this a little further here just shortly you'll see where I'm going here just shortly Acts chapter 2 and verse 38 says then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized everyone in new every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins he says and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost that that promise that that portion amen he says for the promises unto you thank God the promise is unto you but notice what Peter notice what he says now I've got seven children I brought my we brought a van load with us from from Missouri I'm glad that I'm glad I've got a promise that I can claim hold to tonight it says it's under you it's unto your children and to them that are afar off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call amen I got children I want to see saved hey man you got children this afternoon that you want to see saved you got loved ones that you want to see saved amen yeah see so we have a promise this evening church knowing that we are positionally placed in Christ Jesus to know that we know that we know that we know Amen to know that that you have healing this afternoon who has need of healing this afternoon some there's some of you that have need of healing this afternoon Amen to know that you can overcome the devil this afternoon Amen to know that you that you're going to make a Rapture amen there's no question about it right we're able to read God's word and see that you have it you don't have to question it anymore just you just you just take it and you rest upon it amen rest upon the fact that you have it claim that tonight amen see you've been placed in Christ Jesus this afternoon there's no one that can take that away from you you believe that this afternoon amen see that was the whole purpose in the fall of the Garden of Eden we want to question God and why would you why would you create Adam and Eve and why would you create and allow them to fall and all these things but God knew that they would fall God made them in a way that he gave them the ability to make their own decisions and so he allowed them to fall but in doing that he was able to to fulfill his whole purpose of him coming down himself to in the form of a man amen if there are certain attributes about God that he wanted to be healer that he wanted to be a savior that he wanted to be a redeemer amen there was reasons why certain things happen in our lives there's reason why certain things happen in the Old Testament we can look at it and say God why did you allow those things to happen see there's a purpose and there's a reason behind it Church amen see there's a purpose in him coming down and being a sacrificial lamb to the slaughter do you you know it brings into remembrance of the story in the Book of Ruth and I don't have time to get in that tonight but talking about a kinsman redeemer to know that we have a Kinsmen Redeemer Church this afternoon to know that they were able that he's positionally placed us in Christ Jesus and to know that he as a Kinsmen Redeemer he come down and he felt your sickness yeah he felt all your pain he felt your temptations that you go through he felt the trials and the situations and all the things that you have to endure right there's a reason behind it all yeah see he's shedding his own blood that you and I could live this afternoon Church are we Worthy we're not we're not worthy on our own are we but he came down in the form of a serve and he yielded himself so that we could be worthy amen see we there's nothing that we can do ourselves this evening but we have to yield ourselves to him and to his purpose if you yield yourself into him into his purpose this afternoon you'll be made worthy amen allow that blood that was shed to come upon you listen that's the only thing that will save you this afternoon I know I know I'm talking to Believers here this evening but it's that shed blood they said shed blood the life that was in that blood amen we we know that we we know what brother Branham said if we had a vial of that blood it wouldn't do us any good but if we allow that life the spirit of the life that was in that blood to come within you and me amen that same Spirit if it resides within you and me that'll be what saves you this afternoon that's what's going to allow you to make a Rapture this afternoon that's what's going to allow you to be an overcomer yeah amen see we must identify with our sacrifice Church we've got to identify with our sacrifice just as Abel was able to come down we can go back and you can read it in the in the beginning of the book in The Book of Genesis he pulled that lamb down to the altar church he he pulled that lamb down to the altar a lamb that was willing to give its life he he laid the lamb upon the Altar and he took a rock and he started to beat that lamb he didn't do like Cain did yeah yeah Cain he he didn't want to he didn't want to get messy yeah Kane did he didn't want to he didn't want to get the blood all over could you imagine how can you imagine the scene as it's transpiring over how that came maybe Kane's looking back at him and said Abel what are you doing why are you doing that see it comes a point that you have to identify with yourself with a sacrifice amen Abel as he as he's laying that the lamb down there and the blood's going all over the place yeah he's identifying with that sacrifice he's allowing the blood to go all over him the blood's going all over the altar he he's feeling the heartbeat of that lamb is starting to leave him yes sir he's identifying himself with a sacrifice church that's what you and each and every one of us have to do this afternoon is we have to identify ourselves with a sacrifice that's the only way that we can be identified with Christ is we have to identify with him we have to allow that blood that the life that was in that blood to come upon you and me amen that shed blood this evening he identified with sacrifice Abel he wasn't ashamed he didn't regret it Church he was willing to give his life amen yes yes new this evening let me ask you a question are you willing to give your life some of you know exactly what I'm talking about see you see a couple silver-haired ones here or that know exactly what I'm talking about they no doubt giving their lives for the for the things of the Gospel maybe their whole life they've had to surrender over and maybe had to do it out from time to time because that's right certain things had transpired in their life because if you're going to be a Christian you have to give up some things you have to but you have to identify with that sacrifice maybe that's not having a fanciest house maybe it's not having the best of cars maybe it's not having all the worldly Goods that all the world possesses but you've identified with a sacrifice amen you've allowed that you've allowed that blood that the spirit is in that blood to come upon you and then you've been positionally placed in Christ Jesus as a son or a daughter of God Amen we got to be like Abel tonight willing to surrender all in you unto God you got to come to a point where you won't hesitate you won't stumble to lay down your life young people you got to come to a point that that this is a realization for you that that I know that I know that I know that I've been filled with the Holy Ghost that I've been born again amen second Corinthians chapter 5 and verse 20 it says now then we are our ambassadors for Christ as though God did beseech You by us it says we pray you in Christ instead it says be ye reconciled to God for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin see talking about identifying yourself with that sacrifice somebody that was able to lay down his life somebody that didn't know sin he didn't he didn't do anything wrong but he was able to lay down his life someone who knew no sin that that we might be made the righteousness of God in him are you willing to completely surrender everything over for him amen Ephesians chapter 6 and verse 10 it says finally my brother he says be strong in the Lord and in the power of his mind says put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against The Wiles of the devil says for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities he says against Powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places he says wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God is that you may be able to withstand the evil day and having done all to stand to stand therefore having your loins gird about with truth I believe we have some truth this afternoon amen and having on the breastplate of righteousness he says in your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace he said above all take the shield of Faith wherewith you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked it says and take the helmet of salvation and the in the sword of the spirit which is the word of God it says praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit watching there and too with all perseverance and supplication for All Saints and for me it says that utterance may be given unto me said that I may open my mouth he says boldly Church to make known The Mystery of the Gospel it says for which I am an ambassador in bonds that they're in I may speak holy is our ought to speak yeah see here Paul he's speaking to the Ephesians the Ephesian Church there and he you know he's telling that you've been made ambassadors for god listen church if God has sent you come on to be his Ambassador yeah do you realize this evening do you do you understand what an ambassador is listen all the power that's in heaven all that God is all of his angels all of his power stands behind our words if we are correctly ordained sent Messengers to the people that's a quote from Brother Branham but that's not just preachers in the in the Pulpit but he's talking about the bride of Christ amen he says God has to honor the word for he has so solemnly written that whatsoever you bind on Earth that will I bind in heaven whatever you loose on Earth that will lie loose in heaven and give unto thee the he's of the Kingdom listen Church such great promises he's given the church such great precious promises if you've been made ambassadors for for Christ this evening he says take the word of God say take the sword of God start defeating those enemies start fighting the enemies Church destroy your enemy you don't have to be bound to sickness and pain and death and all these other things and Man start to fighting those Devils start fighting those Temptations all the struggles that you grow through don't give in to him don't give him any ground amen why are you letting why are you allowing Satan to come upon your ground in squatter yeah why are you letting him take possessions it's not him be Overcomers this afternoon amen you've been positionally placed in Christ Jesus to be able to take the word of God and believe it and to be able to apply it to your lives to be Overcomers amen amen all right so let's look at Ephesians chapter two I've said all that that's a foundation of what I'm going to say tonight Ephesians chapter 2 and verse 1. well we'll just we'll go as far with this I I'm not a long-winded preacher so we'll uh I'm I'm almost we're according to clock I'm half almost half done so we'll just take as far as we can and maybe some other time we can finish it up so Ephesians chapter 2 and verse 1 it says and you hath he quickened and I love the book of Ephesians it just it does something for me when I start reading the book of Ephesians you know what here Paul he's speaking he says and you half he quickened who were dead in trespassings and sins you you realize I I know we realize we know what that word Quicken means tonight but that word quickens maybe for our younger ones sometimes we we expect everybody to know exactly what we're talking about but maybe our younger ones here don't know that word Quicken means to be made Alive Church and man it means to be made alive there was a change from Death unto life hey man you were once dead but now you've been made alive amen see there's no other thing that that could happen to any person so great as a changing from Death To Life amen amen a man get this a man if he was dying physically it could be healed physically that would be a great thing wouldn't it if you were dying of cancer and and they were able to give you treatments and chemo and everything else and but but whatever man could do and they killed all the cancer out that would be a wonderful thing to be able to save your life right but there's nothing so great is when he is spiritually dead and God has quickened him to life that that's something we were all at one time church we were all this way amen so he's taking that form of God upon himself taking that form of God upon the believer right see in placing eternal life there as I was saying earlier is Christ the Redeemer Christ the the Creator within you amen and if you've got eternal life this evening church then you always were do you realize that see it's not some pep talk that we're trying to pep you up and things like that but do you understand it in our in our in our human intellect in our human understanding it's hard for us to understand God it's hard to understand that yeah I was talking some of our our even my own kids sometimes we have these conversations and it's hard for us to understand that God always was when Earth wasn't here when stars wasn't you know there wasn't nothing around God was still there and it's hard for us in our human understanding to understand that I asked that we had a youth meeting here last weekend over at the park and I asked the I just asked the kids some questions and I asked them I said if you could speak to God face to face what's one thing that you would ask him and some of them asked that question what you know how was it how is it that this would be and you know there's things that we can't explain there's things that's what that's when faith comes in that thing we just have to believe it by faith we have to have amen and one day we'll understand it I believe when we get over there we're able to talk to God we're able to to listen to him can you imagine the conversation brother being as we're sitting there and God he we we have a question and he sets us down and he just starts explaining it's like sitting at a table with an elderly brother an old oak tree he starts telling you all the things that you he I sit down with brother uh I have some some elderly brother one some time ago and he's telling me all the things that he did back in the 60s and 70s and he starts telling me how did he come into the message he starts starts telling me all the things that he used to be a hippie and all these other things and how you come in and just sitting there and just baffling me you know just I didn't I didn't ask any questions I was just sitting there listening to him talk I believe it would be like that one of these days when we're sitting around listening to God maybe it won't be that way maybe that's just my own you know you know maybe we're already already know everything but what maybe just sitting there we're just listening to God talk and we're just think you know God just yeah you don't even have to ask he just starts talking to you yeah you just start just more than what you can understand sometimes you know and just we know God's good to us Church you know it's hard for us to understand these things amen see it's the believer taking on the form of God and God placing eternal life there if you've got eternal life as I said you always were you always work do you understand that this evening you always were because there is only one form of eternal life that's what brother Branham said we always were and the reason we were is because we are a part of God we're positionally placed in Christ Jesus we were a part of God and God is the only thing that that's eternal there is no eternal hell there is no none of these other things are Eternal at some point they all come to an end amen even the devil was a created being he's not he's not eternal right see you come to a place where you have to die out to yourself you have to die out to your sins you have to die out to your trespasses you have to die out to your old nature and if we have time and I I see that we're not going to have time but we're going to we'll get into some of this stuff you go back home and you read the book of Ephesians tonight and there's a lot of things that maybe I don't refer to in scripture but you'll find it right there in the book of Ephesians he says if you take off the old man and you put on the new and there's a whole lot of things you got to come to the point where you die out to all the old things and all get rid of all those things you take on eternal life this afternoon you put on the new man so you come to the place that you die out here brother Branham he says when a seed is placed into the ground is it in order for that life that is in it it has to in order for that life that's in it to live it has to rot if it doesn't rot he said cannot live he says in rot is to be completely done away with it's finished is it and when we get to the place that our own ideas is in our own thinking is completely gone and it's rotted away from us then the germ of Life can begin to live amen listen I'm not asking for a show of hands this evening but let me ask you something I asked the church back home this here recently you know you don't don't don't raise your hands and maybe none of you are this way but how many of you are struggling maybe you're struggling with life struggling with trying to figure out who you are trying to figure out you know because we all work we all brush shoulders with the world and things and we we all we we all have things that we struggle with from time to time right we're struggling with the things of the world maybe struggling with to overcome struggling with spiritual matters listen Church you know how to overcome you overcome of the blood of the lamb and by your testimony amen could you ever do it by yourself though no Somebody went before you and overcome for you amen it's Christ I'm just an heir of it yeah yeah you find that in the book of Ephesians that you're you're an heir to something Church you go over to Romans and you find that you're an heir to something you get to read and then the promises of God you find that you're heir to these things amen I'm just an air of it I don't have anything to do with it I'm an heir with a promise the only thing I have to do is put my faith in his promise I'm here to it tonight Church if you're struggling this evening if it seems like your neighbor is struggling this evening you've got to die out yeah right you've got to die out tonight Church you've got you've got to to die out so much that you rocked get rid of your own ideas right get rid of your own thinking that's what brother that's what a prophet of God said get rid of your own ideas get rid of your own thinking and rot out yep yep amen get rid of your hatred for your brother get rid of your hatred for your sister amen get rid of all those negative thoughts that no one loves you come on now how many times have I heard that that nobody loves me we're Christians come on we're brothers and sisters of Christ Jesus say man no one likes you listen that's the devil telling you those things hey man why are you listening to the devil for amen you know he's a liar yeah right we can go in the Book of Genesis and see where he's a deceiver right you know what he's good at it he'll come in here even in a service like this right here he may be whispering in some of your ears telling you you know that preacher's lying to you that preacher don't care about you he don't he he don't know what you're going through you don't think the devil's here tonight he comes to church the devil's most faithful member of the church has yeah he wants to see what's going on yeah yeah you'll forgive I preach this at home so I [Laughter] verse 2 says I'm I'm only on verse two so verse 2 says we're in time past you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of Disobedience listen I can look out this evening and as I said there I don't know a lot of you here I see some familiar faces but overall I don't know you and you don't know me that I know of maybe from Facebook or something like that but you know I can look out and I can see that there's things that you know some of you no doubt have struggled over time yeah yeah there was a time that you didn't serve God there was all a time that we didn't serve God right I know there was a time when I didn't serve God or even I didn't even want the things of God and I was raised in a message Church for the for the most part of my life I was raised in a message Church sit on message pew and I didn't want the things of God I was there because mom and daddy made me come maybe the same effect for some of you young ones that sitting here tonight but at some point God got a hold of my life I can remember very vividly remember I didn't hear an audible voice but I can very vividly remember the Lord coming and dealing with me when I was 13. and I pushed him away I said no I'll do it later I wasn't ready yeah yeah I can remember when he come to me again at 16. yeah but at 16 I had my driver's license I had girls that I wanted to chase I had things I wanted to do I pushed him away again but there come a time whenever the Lord started dealing with my heart with my life there come a time whenever I was 18 years old Lord he heavily come upon me and I had to surrender there has to come a time that we all have to surrender this evening church amen there was a time that we didn't walk and talk about the things of God there was a time that I didn't want to do those things I was dead to God I was an enemy but thanks be to God who is rich in Mercy Church we'll get to that here in just a minute verse 3 says among whom also we all had our conversation he says in times past in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and of the mind it says and were by Nature notice what he says we're by Nature this is exactly what I was just talking about he says we're by Nature the children of Wrath even as others listen church I remember a time when I love country music I told the churches here not long ago I had a country a stack of country music CDs This Tall yeah I love that country music that's all my daddy he said if you don't listen to country music I mean it might have been a good thing in in the sense that he didn't let us listen to rock and roll and all those other things because it could have been so much worse than what what we was listening to but you know there's still times that if I'm not careful we walk in Walmart and they got some Hank Williams Jr or something like that on if you're not careful that that old man starts trying to come back out again you know there was a time that I used to listen to country music and loved it you know there was a time that that I was fulfilling the desires and the lust of the flesh just like you and I were amen right I wanted to go to all the dances that the school had to offer I wanted to do everything that I wanted to be popular yeah I wanted there was a time that I was an alien from God I didn't I didn't I didn't have the things that he did just what he's talking about right here I was fulfilling the lust of our flesh the desires of the Flesh of the Mind that was by Nature child of the Wrath right thought I had to be cool serving the lust of the flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh but listen Church verse 4. he says but God he says but God Church who is rich in Mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us but God Church like whenever I pushed him away as I'll do it another time I pushed him away I'll do it another time but God Church who is rich in Mercy thank God that he kept coming to me and said Josh you've gotta you gotta have this you got to have what I'm trying to give you you got

I'd start tying it all in you thought I was just going off in different places but I'm trying to tie it into this afternoon we're identified ourselves with a sacrifice we've been positionally placed in Christ Jesus we've been made new we've been made alive amen set on fire for the things of God amen verse 6 says I think I'm on verse six yeah verse 6 says in hath raised us up together and made us to sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus he's placed his robe upon you this evening amen he's placed his robe upon he set you in the palace you've been made a son and a daughter of God Amen

other night at church and you know Noah he was always a part of me he's he's a sharp young man he's only 13 though so you sisters y'all just hold up for a couple more years he's he's only 13. he looks older than what he is he's almost as big as me but he's got a little ways to go about four or five more years he'll be ready but you know he was always a part of me right right come here Noah I'll

mean this boy anybody anywhere they go they said well that's a swim you're Josh swims his son but do you you know he always was a part of me yeah even whenever I was this tall go ahead and sit down son whenever I was just a little lab he was a part of me right hey man whatever whatever I was in my daddy he was still a part of me amen see that's the same way that it is with you and me tonight with you and I to that that's the way it is that we're hundred dollars of God the life that was in God's word Church Christ Jesus is in The Believer this afternoon life of God is here this evening and those that are willing to accept it you always were a part of God you didn't know it Noah didn't know that he was a part of me because he he hadn't made and made manifest yet yeah yeah I didn't know that I was a part of my daddy but at some point we become made manifest we always were a son or daughter of God Amen verse 7 says that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding Riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus for by Grace he says are you saved through faith and then none of yourselves he says it is the gift of God verse 9 says None of Works lest any man should boast see it's not anything that you can do of yourself right works are good faith and works go hand in hand together but it's not works that's going to get you there it's by God's grace this evening amen that's what Paul is trying to say works and it works in Faithfully go hand in hand but it's by great God's grace that you're going to be there brother Branham said it's only by God's grace that he would be there yeah he was a prophet of God yeah yeah verse 10 says for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus under good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them see that word created church it's Christ formed in the believer do you understand that I I was at and I told the church this several it's been maybe a year ago now and it just comes back to my mind that you know I raised a few farm animals I got some things out there and I usually go out there and feed them I got some Hogs and then and some uh goats and things like that and I go outside and I feed them early in the morning before I go to work and in the wintertime the yellow sun it didn't come up as quickly as it does in the summertime when I was out there and I was feeding these animals before I go to work and it was just a beautiful sky and I was thinking I was looking at this guy and I was thinking you know these are the same stars that Noah looked at these are the same stars that job looked at these are the same stars that whenever they were built to pyramids they were able to line up with the you all know about all those things how perfectly everything aligns up this is same stars that the prophets of old looked at cry you know I just started thinking about the creation of God and how it just started it just started ringing in so true to me and then when you start reading here in the book of Ephesians how they how the word how that God created Christ created he he Christ is formed in The Believer Christ the Creator God the Creator he's formed in The Believer Church what that ought to do you Christ the Redeemer Christ the Creator Christ the word formed in The Believer tonight man that ought to set you on fire yeah that ought to you to realize that you realize that you can speak worlds into existence tonight all right you just speak the word you know when Joshua he got in a little trouble he's seen that the the sun was starting to go down the moon's starting to come up you realize when you go back and you read the scripture Joshua didn't pray he spoke the word yeah says son stand still Moon stand still you as Believers in Christ Jesus those that have been positionally placed in crisis you're able to speak the word tonight for whatever it is that you have need of and you simply believe those words and maybe it takes maybe it'll happen instantly maybe it'll take a year maybe to take two years maybe but you keep believing it over and over and over you can hear on tape how brother Branham he would pray for different ones a blind man a different ones and maybe it didn't happen instantly but they came they kept professing what they were believing kept professing that kept confessing their healing kept professing that all everything that they believed in yeah yeah and eventually it would happen it would take place amen it's Christ the Redeemer in you Christ's a Creator in you when are we going to understand those things I believe I believe we do I'm not saying that we don't realize that because you know do you understand why it's going home time it's going home time Church it's Rapture time it's body change time the combines coming through the field are you a weed or are you a tear are you going to the Garner are you going to be burned it's going home time amen these Christ the Redeemer Christ formed in the believer we could be it it's being as Adam spoke to Eve and said this is now bone of my bone this is Flesh of My Flesh amen see we're laying down the things of this life we want we want we want nice things we want whatever it is that God would allow us to have but it comes to a point that I'm willing to lay all that down yeah I'm willing to lay down my girlfriends I'm willing to lay down my job I'm willing to lay down whatever it is that separates me from the things of God It's gotta become a realization it's something that's so real to you that I've got to have that's right that that I just can't be I can't be separated from it no longer amen yeah yeah bone is my bone flesh in my flesh laying down the things of the life taking on the things of Life to Come amen we start getting rid of all these corruptable things that that moth and Russ will corrupt and we start packing on the things of God something that's going to start taking us up Church as we get closer and closer and closer to him we just start walking just like Enoch did we just get we just start walking and walking just we're on a journey with God we just keep walking getting closer and closer and closer to God one of these days we just walk out of here meet our Lord and savior in the sky man I'm looking forward to that day how about you First Corinthians I I know this is out of the book of Ephesians but we ain't gonna be able to finish tonight anyway so we might as well take something first first Corinthians 15 and 33 says for this corruptable church must put on incorruption and this Mortal must be put on immortality amen so when this corruptable shall have put on incorruption and it's mortal shall have put on immortality says then shall be brought to pass a saying that is written death is swallowed up in Victory he says oh death where is thy sting oh grave where is thy Victory The Sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law but thanks be to God he says which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ he says therefore my beloved Brethren be steadfast he says unmovable always abounding in the work of the Lord for as much as you know that you labor not that your labor is not in vain in the Lord amen be steadfast tonight Church be unmovable when Satan comes to you and he starts whispering to you he starts telling you all them lies it starts telling you that how that you you gotta accept this sickness you gotta accept all these things to get behind me Satan I won't accept those things be unmovable be unchangeable be steadfast in the things of God amen jump back over to Ephesians chapter 2 and 11 it says wherefore remember he says that you being in time past this was our opening scripture I believe that you being in time past In the Flesh you said we're called who are called uncircumcision by that which is called the circumcision and the flesh made by hand it says that at that time he says you were without Christ being aliens from the Commonwealth of Israel and strangers from the covenants of promise it says having no hope we were all there church having no hope without God you realize you were aliens you were foreigners to the things of God you didn't have any rights you had no rights Church to the things of God you were not entitled to anything that God had to offer you the first 13 says but now but now say that with me but now amen but now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made now by the blood of Christ amen for he is our peace amen who hath made both one and has broken down the middle wall of partition between us see there's no more separation from us say man there's no more separating separating us from the things of God Amen especially in a people like this that know the word of God that know the message of the hour that know the things that you know there's no more separating you from the things of God for we are living in an age in which all the mysteries of God have been made known unto us amen the seventh seals have been revealed and the book's been opened a man see it's not some teaching of a man right as the world wants to make it be it's not some teaching of a man it's not our own interpretation of these things or our own understanding of these things the wall of partition has been broken and you brother Joel you there was once an alien foreigners of Christ can now come into fellowship with him amen and not only come into Fellowship but you're coming into his likeness your bone of his bone your flesh of his flesh yes sir you're coming into his likeness Church you're adorning yourself with the word of God you're taking upon that that word church and you're becoming more and more and more into the image that he wants you to be amen verse 15 says having abolished in his flesh the enmity even the law of Commandments contained in ordinances says for to make in himself of Twain one new man just so making peace and that he might reconcile both unto God and one body by the cross having slain the enmity thereby and came and preached peace to you which were far off and to them that were not Verse 18 says for through him we were both we both have access by one Spirit unto the father notice what he says verse 19 he says now therefore he says you're No More Strangers You're No More Strangers Church you're no more foreigners anymore fellow citizens Brother David you're a fellow citizen with the Saints and the household of God you've come into fellowship with him yeah you've been positionally placed in Christ Jesus you're no more foreign you're no more stranger to the things of God but you've come and you become fellow citizens join heirs in Christ Jesus you've got an inheritance coming Church hey man he says verses 20 says and we are built upon the foundation of the Apostles the prophets Jesus Christ himself being the Chief Cornerstone in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth to an Holy Temple in the Lord verse 22 says in whom you also are building together for inhabitation of God through the spirit see that's our position in Christ has identified himself with us with you and me tonight you have something Eternal within you we have been positionally placed and we've come into the spirit of adoption you go back over I believe it's in chapter one and now we have been made Sons and Daughters of God we have come into His fellowship tonight Church brother Branham he says here I I said I wasn't going to be able to finish I got done so brother Branham he says here and skipped over just a few things but that's all right brother Branham he says here now if it was Jesus was the fullness of God manifested he says he was the fullness of God of the godhead bodily therefore when he came to the Earth he says and was manifested in flesh he says you were here in him then because he was the word he says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and it dwelt among us and the Word was made flesh he says and therefore you walked with him he says when you were in him he says when he was on Earth he says you suffered with him get that church he said you suffered with him he said you died with him you was buried with him and now you are risen with him he says it manifested attributes of God to setting in Heavenly places he said already raised resurrected to New Life and setting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus he says oh that means so much nowadays how much more should it mean to us some you know what 60 years ago he preached it and things that are to be in 65 that's what 50 something 60 years ago however long it's been how much more should that mean to us he said oh that means so much nowadays church that means so much to us to see ourself positionally placed in Jesus Christ Through the Ages there are those that look for this day musicians could go ahead and come tonight we have the fullness of the word it's going home Tom Church do you believe that this evening
