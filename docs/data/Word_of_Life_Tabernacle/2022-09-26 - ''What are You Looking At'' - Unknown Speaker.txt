Life To Us Lord I pray that the word would be quick and made alive this afternoon through him this this day Lord and we just pray you'll be with us now each one that has come out Lord I pray he would give him a special blessing we pray in Jesus name amen are you happy to be in the house of the Lord this afternoon you would get your Bibles and turn to Hebrews chapter 12. did you enjoy that sermon this morning it's hard to follow up after that I I'm really really loud I can hear myself I feel like people back are covering their ears Hebrews chapter 12 and verse 1. wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which doth so easily easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus the author and the finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the Throne of God and if you would turn to John chapter 4 and verse 25 very familiar scripture here the woman saith unto him I know that messiah's cometh which is called Christ when he has come he will tell us all things Jesus saith unto her I that speak unto thee am he and upon this came his disciples and marveled that he talked with the woman yet no man said what seeketh thou or why talk us thou with her the woman then left her water pot and went her way into the City and saith to the men come see a man which told me all the things that ever I did is this not the Christ you may be seated may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of the word I would like to make this point today to you that she got what she was looking for this woman thank you brother David this woman here had to have known something in the scriptures in order to know that when this thing happened that the Messiah was there and I think today in order to get anything from God you have to look for something from God there's a people on Earth today I believe that are looking for a Rapture so there is a Rapture to happen but in order for that to happen there has to be someone here looking for that to happen and in this age of distractions and things that are always going on and clouding our minds and and there's always look at me and there's a billboard here and and there's something on the TV over here and there's so many things to distract us and wanting us to look at it I wonder if today if we could ever get focused back on Christ and we would see Christ then the word would be made made plain to us again and brother Branham says it like this he says the Bible said in Isaiah 45 22 he said we find that God said look unto me all the ends of the Earth and now when the Earth has come to its end or the system of the Earth has come to its end let the people look unto him he said now you might say we have heard this generation after generation we've heard this for a long time that is true he said it's been preached for a long time many ministers has took the same text he said thousands of them but here is the thing I want to ask you tonight for the next few minutes he said when you look the question is what do you see when you look what do you see when you do look that only depends on what you're looking for and if you're looking for a Revival in the church I believe you'll get a Revival from the church but if you're going to church and you're looking for some just just regular sermon or you're just looking for another another you know check the box and say well I went to church Sunday well that's good but but that's not all you should go looking and expecting something to happen he said now he said now look unto me all the ends of the Earth Moses lifted the serpent up the brass serpent he said the people looked and he said if you ever and ever he said and ever who looked got healed he said now it depends on what you're looking for and he and he goes on he said I still believe God he said I focused in on the word and now and know that truth nobody has ever been able to shake me from that he said as long as god holds my heart straight on that word I'll stay there he said Elijah one day when he was looking for something to come to bring the people to the to the to bring help to the people excuse me he said he looked and he looked to the old man 80 something years old was too tired to climb the mountain and been fasting and praying but God told him if they would repent something would happen what was he looking for he sent his servant up and said go up and look something's going to happen three and a half years and no rain he said not a cloud not even Dew Fallen but he said go look see he was expecting the rain to come go look there is coming rain but you've got to look for it and he said and Elijah goes back he said I mean geeza goes back and he looks and and looks and Elijah that little bald head sitting there in the Sun and his whiskers and his beard white beard and them little bony looking arms across his bony knees and he said Lord God he said he began to pray he said go back again now he said what was he doing he was looking for God to take care of his promise no matter how brassy the skies looked how much judgment is upon it you're looking for the promise of God so whatever you're looking for today is what you're going to receive today if you go into church and you're looking for the problems in the church you're going to find the problems in the church if you're looking to be blessed by God I believe you'll get a blessing from God and I think that's the problem as we go there and we're not looking for the right thing we're looking to see maybe who's dressed up and how and and we're looking over here to see who's there and who's not there but the thing of it is let's look to Christ in the word and there will be something revealed to you he said it depends on what you're looking for he said remember you can only see him as you look at him through the word and I I read that and it come to me a lot of times we look at the message and we're looking at it through uh through the lens of an idea or a preconceived notion of something we've heard maybe from our parents or our grandparents and and something that would be told well this has got to happen or this has got this got to take place before the coming of the Lord but what it is we're getting off track and we're looking at things to happen in the future but really the only thing we should be looking for is the coming of the Lord and he said he said remember you can only see him if you look through the lens of the word and I wonder if we could get back and look through look at the message through the Bible and it'll look different to you and I believe that with all my heart I think we looked way too often we look at the message as through a story or something and those are good things but let's not look through a story and say well the message must it must have to happen like this and then you have to throw out a quote here and you have to throw out a scripture over here to make your little idea work and it just makes you a miserable Christian I remember at one time I had struggled about the the the I'll just tell you the return of brother Branham people was always tell me it's got to happen it's got to happen but let me tell you something quit looking for a man to come back and look to the word we're looking for something to take place that's not going to happen and if it did happen it wouldn't really have that much significance because it's not in the word but let me just tell you like this what we need to be looking for is a Biblical promise of a Rapture a Biblical promise of the spirit of the Lord fallen in the last days something that will take place and you can stand your stand your steak put your stake on it the word of God says it will happen it will happen so when Elijah when they were looking for something looking for the rain to come remember all it was was just a cloud the size of a man's hand but that was the beginning of the promise being fulfilled and when you see the Pentecostal age they got to see they got to see the the first pull come forth and and they got to see the healings and and the Revival that swept the land and and that was good and they accepted that but then when the word come forth but that's what we're looking for was the revealing of the Seven Seals in our day we weren't looking for just the gift but that got your attention and then we were able to see what the full promise was for the day he said I will pour out my spirit sure he did but then he said in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God would be finished now we can look back and say we see it because we were looking for it if you wasn't looking for the coming of a messenger in this day then you probably haven't found him and if he wasn't looking for for for Noah's message in his day then I'm sure you probably never got on the boat but if you were standing there and you heard the word of God for that day and you recognized the word of the hour then you would get on that boat with Noah right if you were going to follow Moses out into the desert it may not have looked very good but if you were going to follow a man and you didn't know where you were going you knew where the end Journey was but you didn't know what laid between here and there you had to have some faith in that man and the message that he brought to you but you had to be looking for a deliverer or you would never accept him when he came and I think that's the problem today is we're not looking for the word of God to take us in a Rapture but what we're looking for is the problems in the church or I just want to be a church member and I will take my kids to church we heard this morning that's not good enough that'll just make you a miserable Christian but what we want to do is follow every word and when you're looking at the word when you look to the Bible and you look to the message of the hour remember if you'll look at it through the eyes of the word you'll see Christ we've heard recently that Christ is revealed in every chapter of the Bible and that's the truth do you believe it and sometimes and and if you look at it and you're looking at it through the entirety of the Bible and you take the message you start seeing things revealed and and you see things that are opening to you that you've never seen before it's amazing what it'll do to you it'll stimulate You by that Revelation it'll make an alive person out of a dead church member it'll make you act different it'll change your whole outlook on the life as well look when you see Christ as he is but that's what the woman at the well is looking for she was looking for a coming Messiah and maybe she wasn't actively searching but when he came by and he sat down and he told her the things that she did you must be him why because she was looking for him and so when you see the message being revealed in this day that must be Revelations 10 7. that must be Malachi 4 because you're looking for it God promised to send it to you and it's here this day the scripture is fulfilled before your eyes brother Brandon goes on down he said he said Daniel one time was standing when he saw the ending of the Gentile kingdoms he saw the image that Nebuchadnezzar had dreamed and he saw how each one would each would succeed the other and as they come down and when he looked to see what was all going to happen at the end he saw Jesus he was the stone hewed out of the mountain without hands he saw something because he was looking search the scriptures and you'll find here he said he said when brother Branham goes on he says when he throwed the three Hebrew children in the fiery furnace he said they believed in God and stood on his word is that you today do you believe in God do you stand on his word the entirety of the word not just something you think or something you hope happens but something that the prophet said and the prophet revealed and opened to you the scriptures and so now we can say that we are true Bible Believers because we can see what it said he said and he said he said what it was he said if they had to die for it they was going to stand anyhow just a little thing of bow on their knee or some other way but when he looked away and saw Jesus was the fourth man he said that was in the fiery furnace he said kept all the heat off of him he said his obedience servants that's what Nebuchadnezzar saw he was looking in the fire he was looking for him to be burned up but what did he see a fourth man walking around down there and he said he said another day Ezekiel and he goes on through these different men in the Bible and they what they would see when they would look and he said Ezekiel looked away to see him one day and he was a wheel in the middle of the wheel and way up in the middle of the air he was the Hub to the wheel and he said he said he goes down and and he just goes on and he said that's who Ezekiel Saw when he looked away he said the wheel was being turned by the power of the Lord he saw a wheel in the middle of the wheel Elijah saw a cloud the size of a man's hand no doubt Noah he didn't see the rain cloud but he saw a promise Abraham and Sarah we can just go on down through the scriptures they looked for the promised son because they knew that the word had to happen so when you read the word and it says this will happen look for it it's coming the people in the days of Noah remember they were called Fanatics too those people today you people today looking for a Rapture you're called Fanatics too people say oh the Rapture is not even a Biblical word oh but there's a catching away of the church that's Bible and a Prophet come and called it a Rapture that's good enough for me amen because we are going to be caught up the dead in Christ shall rise first and we who remain will be caught up to meet those who remain in the air and the children of Israel when we we looked at that I want to dwell on that for just a second of the children of Israel when they come down to the Red Sea there you know they're looking and they found they followed the prophet and they get down to the Red Sea and and all of a sudden they think they're following God they think oh what could go wrong and here comes pharaoh and his army and they look back and no doubt many of them were scared to death well and they say why you brought us out here just to die in the wilderness and and they got scared but there was someone there who had already seen the promised land to come and he said that's where we're going and the Lord told me to go and so he stretched out that staff over over the waters and it opened up and they saw that great miracle and what did they do on the other side they come out rejoicing Miriam come out plant her tambourine and and they were just acting like a bunch of Pentecostals over there because why they had come through a trial and now that they'd come out on the other side of the trial they were free and they realized that there was no Army going to swallow them up no more but then they continued on through the Wilderness and the next thing you know they they're there just a little bit longer than they thought maybe they'd been there 10 20 years at this point and and they got tired of eating uh you know the quail and the Mana that was coming down and oh it just that wasn't good enough for him and and you know they had already seen what God had done but it just kind of seemed like their eyes were getting waxed over a little bit and and they get on down there and they started complaining and Moses the prophet that he was was always standing in the gap for the people and and trying to you know don't don't curse the people God don't do that you know we want to have mercy on him and and Moses went on down and remember they got all the way to the promised land took him 40 years and if you look at the map that's not very far but it took him 40 years they had the worst guide apparently you know but uh but the pillar fire was guiding him but I guess the Lord was sitting there says as long as you complain we're gonna go in a circle we're just going to go in a circle I wonder today if we could ever get past our complaining enough to just step on into the promises of God but we stay here in a circle just going around and around thinking hey you know what listen listen there's nothing there's no reason to complain you have a promise of a Rapture you have a promise of being raised up even if you go first you might as well just take life as it comes I know it's easier said than done but listen to me Church there's no reason for the Christian to just spend their life in in confusion and chaos and complaining and griping all the time you see it happening in the church and you see it happening on Facebook and and they're just complaining and complaining all the time but listen we are to be called out from among those complainers and to live a Victorious life through Jesus Christ there's so many times and those those people remember that kept them just going in circles they couldn't ever go over and possess the land because they were complaining because they didn't have good enough food and they were complaining because they didn't have nice enough seats and they didn't have a good enough sound system and all these things they were complaining about but listen there was a land just a little just a little ways away that was flowing with milk and honey and grapes and all these things but what happened was they got stuck in their confusion and doubt and chaos and they get over to the land and then the spies go over and the spies that go over there and and and the and some of them come back with a bad report we can't go over what they see they saw giants well we can't take the land because there's Giants in our way this is the Promised Land by the way this is the land that God gave you and well I just can't go over but there were some Believers in there who were looking at the promise and we are more than able to take the land if there's a sickness battling you this afternoon you are more than able to overcome that there is a promised word in the Bible that tells you that by his stripes you were already healed you your family you think well they're all going out and and they're they're just running away and I can't keep them in church and and if you're doing all that you know to do in the home there is a promise for that child to return we heard that we need a home for him to come back to but if you've done your best and they still go out there's a promise that is unto you and to your children and to them that are far off if you believe that promise God has given you your children if you can only believe the promise but what are you looking at are you looking at the symptoms of the child or are you looking to the promise of God all that's what we have to look at is the promise always look at the promise and if we're having a bad day just remember there's a promise for you that you can overcome Temptation you can overcome all these things that come at you remember you are more than able you are more than conquerors more than conquerors Abraham had met God and all he saw was a promise and we're the children of Abraham correct we're the children of Abraham we are more than able we see that when John saw him brother Branham uses this illustration John Solomon said Behold the Lamb of God I wonder if when we see Christ if we really see who he really is or if we're just looking at him as a historical figure oh I see Jesus and and I see him in the scripture and he walked the roads and and it's just wonderful we see what he did and and the healings that took place and and we don't really know that when he went away he came back and lives among you you don't see him as that but you just see him as a historical God but today I'm here to tell you he is more than just a Jesus that walked in flesh but he's in your flesh today he's something more than just a man that walked the seashores of Galilee he's something more that put mud in a man's eyes and made him see he's someone more than even hung on a cross for you but I'll tell you what he is he is your savior he is your god he said Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world Behold a greater than Solomon is here Christ is in the midst of his people today you Lord you'll see him if you're looking for him you'll see him if you're looking for him if you're not looking for the spirit to come he'll never come upon you if you're not looking for the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost will never enter in you've got to be looking for it and we go on down and and do we see the promise of Christ in us and I was thinking of this thought and and I thought of of the the false teachers that would arise and would wax you over and make you cold and formal and indifferent with one another it all goes together when you get cold and as brother Ben said this morning when you get cold and you get sticky you dry up it's like a cactus out in Arizona you get too close to it to reach out and poke you we don't want that happening in the church looking for the promise of the Holy Spirit it will come and it'll make you sweet and gentle and tender towards one another and in love with one another until when you come to church it's more about come more than just about coming to church but it's about coming to fellowship with one another and fellowship with Christ who is always a present among the Believers where two or three are gathered that's a promise it's always a promise every promise in the book should be ours but it depends on if you're looking for it to come or not the word will show you Christ every time why because Christ is the word you can't look at the word not see Christ brother Graham says it like this he said now you people sitting out there he said don't you dare look to a man look to Christ he is the one he said but he promised in the last days that he would manifest manifest himself in human flesh like he did there at Sodom now your flesh My Flesh let us just open our hearts and get our own thinking away and just let the word take its course tonight in us he said then we'll see God's great gifts of his spirit manifested before us God's gifts will be manifested before us it's if we can get our own flesh and our own thinking out of the way but he said and I highlighted this part don't you dare look to any man we get our eyes on a personality we get our eyes on a certain man and we start seeing the man instead of the message I've got one here and I'll just go ahead and say this he said friends don't look to me I'm your brother don't pay no attention to me I'm just a mortal I have to die like everybody else don't you listen to me but listen to what I've said let me say that again don't just listen to me but listen to what I've said we've got a lot of hearers but not doers because they're listening to the man but not listening to what he said he said not to do that so we're not going to do it right we're looking at the promise of it don't do that and he'll tell you what will happen he said don't listen to me listen to what I've said what I said is the message don't pay any attention to the messenger watch the message keep your eyes not on the messenger but on the message he said what it said that's the thing to look to so are you looking at the messenger or are you looking at the message you say they're wanting the same but remember when he was speaking and he was saying what God told him to say remember Jesus said I can't speak anything until the father shows me when brother Branham was speaking sure what he said was a prophet but don't just look to the human man he said I'm a man I make mistakes he said but look to the message of the hour look to the word that is Christ to you it's more than just a personality it's more than a man there was a story here and it happened brother Brahm tells that it happened in Vancouver British Columbia they were giving a prize for a boy that could ride a bicycle 12 inches across for 100 yards they'd give him a new Schwinn bicycle and all the boys they thought they were fine Riders they'd go downtown for their mama and get a basket of groceries and put it under their arm and ride back and never even touch the handlebars so each one knew he was going to win this contest he said they had a little boy there little mama's boy no one cared much for him they all got on their their numbers were called and they got on the board to the ride and each one fell off but this little boy wrote it right out to the end never made a wobble and all the boys got around him and said how did you do it he said I tell you boys here's where it was said I watched what you all were doing and I seen your mistake you were looking down like this trying to keep it on the board he said I just watched to the end and held steady brother Brahm says there you are there you are quit looking to the left quit looking to the right quit looking down but look to the end what's in store for the bride what's in store for you that love God you who endure to the end you shall be saved there's a promise for you oh I may not maybe I won't make it no you will make it you are going to make it you're more than able to make it I think sometimes we we get too down on ourselves we we get to looking at our circumstances we get to looking at things that may just not work out just right and we think that that's God judging us when it's really God just just kind of bringing us back onto that little 24-inch board and letting us ride out to the end if you get off and you fall you don't get the prize at the end but remember the scripture we read if you run this race with patience run the race with patients you we get so frantic sometimes and I I tell you I tell you what I don't have a lot of notes today but I just had this on my heart quit looking to the left and right quit looking at everybody else that goes for me too quit looking at everybody else it'll distract you from what's happening right now in the bride you say well there's fanaticism over here and there's dead people over here sure there is and it'll break your heart sometimes to see people over here that oh well we don't want anybody to shout in church and uh God forbid brother Branham talks about that you know if you'll go back to the word he tells you somebody say amen and everybody looking around you know and you can hear all their necks squeak you know popping and stuff because they ain't looked around in years because nobody else said amen but but somebody say man in church and I just boy that just gets their feathers all up and and I'll tell you what somebody shouts or somebody runs the aisle and and I had somebody tell me the other day they were just so in shock that people in the message run the aisles and and I I was like hey we're the original Pentecostals I don't know what you are but we are the original Pentecostals we are not a denomination but we have went forward from the things that were the things that were and we stayed with those things and we still have them say God never took anything out of the church we're looking at the fanaticism so we just want to cut out the shouting because somebody did it wrong somebody lived a bad life somebody lived a bad life and shouted but they forget to show you all those who lived a bad life and didn't Shout they forget to point out the dead churches that have got a pastor up there married four or five times they forget to point that out but because they don't like it they have a personal preference against it then they'll stand there and condemn that thing and I'll tell you brother Branham was there one time he also was sitting in the seat of the scornful and he was condemning those people out there he was looking at him and what did he see just fanaticism but the next thing you know when the spirit of God got a hold of him he was joining him and I think if we quit looking at the people and calling them Fanatics and quit looking over here and saying well well they got out of order well maybe they did let God take care of them but I'm going to tell you this tonight quit looking at the people brother Brandon said it like this sorry I gotta jump off here for a second the brother Brandon said it like this he said he said I'll sweep my steps you sweep your steps we forget that a lot I forget that a lot I sure do I'll admit I forget that sometimes sometimes I'm trying to sweep somebody else's step too and trying to be a good neighbor trying to be a you know he's trying to help a brother out why are you sitting there so dead and why are you why are you over here shouting too much I'm just trying to help you out calm down a little bit but maybe sweep yours maybe they need that blessing in their life maybe they need to shout a little bit to break some change in their life maybe somebody over here maybe they're quiet because you don't know what they went through I'll take up for them for a minute I sure will maybe they're sitting there and you don't know what they just went through on their way to church now I'll tell you I'll take up for you for a minute but here's the thing look to the word of God always look to the word and maybe maybe I don't believe you can ever sit still too long I don't believe that the word of God can go forward and not have some effect on your life now we have different types of shouters we have different types of people in the church we have some that like to scream we have some and and I remember a church I used to go to it was always the same ones they would always scream and and you know you knew about when it's going to so you cover the kids ears and they were sleeping you knew it is about you know the note that they hit on the piano is about to get their song leader the worship was just right and maybe there was something said that they just really liked and but you know I've condemned that in the past God forgive me for that I've condemned that because I thought well that's just fanaticism and you can go find quotes and say well that's out of order but let me just go and tell you something maybe they needed that maybe that helped them through something yeah the steam had to be let off just for a minute and it didn't hurt nobody sitting in the church it didn't hurt nobody but there's somebody sitting over there that are sitting quiet and they like the other quiet people who are fine but they're sitting over there and they're condemning that side of the church we'll just say that this side's loud and this side's quiet because it is but but uh there's more people over here see and uh so so just for the sake of the art these people in the middle they're staying with the word they're just right in the middle of the road but uh but over here you'll have somebody sitting quiet and that that's okay but then they start condemning the people over here that's where it becomes wrong that's where it becomes wrong because you're standing there thinking well well that's not how you worship God that's not how you do it but it is how they do it it's okay to worship God in your own way you've got some that just cry and that's okay I had a brother come to me and tell me he said the Tabernacle they'd only cried when they got blessed I I've heard tapes where they they shouted you know brother told me that oh they only cried he said we can't be doing stuff the Tabernacle didn't do well I can't help but that they were all methodists I mean I'm sorry I mean I received a Pentecostal blessing I can't help that I can't help but you know what it doesn't matter how they worshiped how are you going to worship when you see the word how are you going to respond to it you must believe it you must stay with it and we get all we get listen the wise men didn't find Jesus by sitting back and just waiting on something to happen they looked and looked and looked and finally they were stargazers I don't know how long they looked but they looked for the astrologers they looked for years maybe and maybe they were looking for that special star maybe for the sake of the argument these men were 100 years old or 75 or however they lived back in those days and they were they were older men maybe and they were just looking and they thought maybe something would never happen but they continued to look anyway and because they continued to look they finally saw a star and who was it nothing less than the word of God being born they looked and they saw the star and when they saw the star they rejoiced with exceeding great joy when I saw the word open to me I had to Rejoice for it I had to Rejoice because it was something inside of me it wasn't the flesh getting emotional it was something inside of me that pushed me to Rejoice but when they saw the star and they rejoiced then what's next they had to go find out what that star was representing what was where was that Messiah sometimes we have to have that experience to bring us to the word of God and that's what I want to show you today when you're looking for the word along the way you may need something to help you get there sometimes and I said in a church and and I don't I don't say the Lord didn't have me in this place because I believe everything happens for a reason but the Lord had put me in a place and and I got a certain way but then he brought me to this place and I'm thankful that he did I've experienced more joy right here than I ever did in my life but I'm telling you today the joy is not just for me the joy is not just for you but it's for all that will come and look for that same star what are you looking for I'm looking for the word to be made manifest in the bride in the last days I'm looking for a church that is ready for a Rapture I'm looking for somebody who can get out of their dead formal churchology and come up higher into the message of the hour because remember the message didn't come to bind you but it came to Lucia it come to set you free from your formalities it come to set you free from your church Creeds it took you out of a denomination and it brought you in to what brother Brandon would call a glorious light a glorious gospel and when you see the light you rejoice with exceeding great joy that's what you're looking at if the wise men would have saw the star and thought that's pretty nice that's a cool looking star and just sit there to never received the word all right I'm gonna preach anyway they'd have never received the word why because it does you no good to sit there in the seat of the scornful and condemn the people that are reacting because they're reacting a little out of order but they are actually responding to the word itself I saw the star and I'm going to follow that word I saw it there must be a body of Christ somewhere and they went and they journeyed and remember they journeyed for a long time I believe brother Branham says Jesus was maybe two or three years old when they found him it took him years to find him but at some point you'll find what you're looking for if you're looking for a dead Church you're gonna find it if you're looking for an emotional church you can find it if you're looking for the word to be preached in the power of the demonstration you'll find it and it won't be over here let's just stream every service and we'll sing until you do and it won't be over here to where if you just get a little bit out of order and scream the deacons are looking at you and they're sitting there and everyone they're going to stare you down and when you get out they're going to tell you we don't do that in our church David don't be standing up in church we don't allow that around here the devil don't like no praising God around here I don't care what the devil don't like it I don't care and the bride doesn't really care about those things anymore we don't want those things among us but why in the world are we so bound up with Creeds and things that try to tell you you say well well the brother Branham he he did he did Church order a certain way and and we must do it just that way and and then you just try to make it to where the spirit can't move he didn't take the spirit out of the church he tried to get those over emotional people to come under subjection to some order we don't have that problem here we don't have that problem most churches if you're be honest with you I've been to some Pentecostal churches in my time I haven't been to a message church yet they got that out of order I'll be honest with you I've been in a church I was at a UPC Church good people I'm sure they run the aisles and they danced and sang for maybe an hour before the preaching ever started when the preaching started it lasted about 15 minutes we don't have that problem here either Mr JT said amen amen we don't have that see the word takes preeminence in a message Church you say well you're denominational no we're not denominational we are a part of the message of the hour brought to you by none other than God's servant and Prophet we are part of that message I I I'll identify myself I don't sign a card I didn't join a church but I'm part of that message I sure am I'm part of that message there's you can take yourself out of it if you want to I'm in it and I'm going to stay in it but let me tell you something we get to a to a place to where we just want to control the people and I'm not talking about our pastor here because if anybody is is not trying not controlling his brother being he tries not to do that but listen to me we want to control the people how you worship we want to control uh you know when you say Amen or we want to control the spirit of the lord we don't have time after this service to have the spirit of the Lord move so we'll just shut it down quick and get out where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty and if the spirit of the Lord is in a church there is nobody standing up there trying to shut it down where the spirit of the Lord is church take your Liberty and remember I'm not talking about just screaming and shouting every service but become free because you're looking at the word and you realize in the word is freedom in the word is is Restoration in the word is healing and when you see those things the Doom and Gloom just kind of Fade Away we don't see those things no more because we quit looking at those things we quit looking at the past and we leave the past in the past and we press forward towards the mark how many is pressing towards the Mark today we're not looking well you know they and the young people are condemned for being emotional remember this church then most of these young people have never been in a Pentecostal church but they've been in the presence of God and they found freedom they've been in the presence of God just long enough for the spirit of God to raise them up and I tell you don't condemn the Revival of the young people when you need Revival yourself you need it yourself yeah I'm not all for just jumping and shouting and screaming all the time because I know the word has to go forth and and I've been in Services where the quietness would come in and the people would cry at the altar that's wonderful that is an emotion by the way that is emotional worship whatever the spirit chooses to do is good but the spirit needs to have preeminence in every service not just in the meetings not just in when a special evangelist is here and I don't care how good of a speaker they are and maybe much better than another one but but listen when the when the pastor's standing here we should have the same preeminence as when your favorite evangelist is standing here if you go to a church with your favorite preacher that's good and maybe you shout and scream but listen church we should have the same feeling here in our church in your church you people that are not from here you should have the same reaction when the word Goes Forth if it blesses you remember the woman at the well she didn't stay at the well but she ran into the City and said come see a man what are you looking at she looked and she found the Messiah because the word had went forth and then it was time for rejoicing come and see a man who told me everything I ever done come and see a bride that's on fire for God come and see this end time body who is ready for a Rapture that's what I'm looking and for you say she ain't here yet I'm gonna stay here and I'm going to keep preaching and I'm going to keep holding on until we take a Rapture because I know that someday soon she'll be ready if she's not ready today she will be tomorrow if she's not tomorrow she will be the next day someday soon she'll take a rapture but you must look for it I'm not looking for for anything but the coming of the Lord and I believe it's soon I believe very soon is the coming of the Lord that's the thing we need to keep our eyes on have you seen the star and did you worship when you saw the star Christ appearing himself in the sky and just before I close I want to say this when we saw the cloud in the sky the cloud itself wasn't the body of Christ but it showed us where Christ was it wasn't a physical man called William Branham but it was an opening of the word and that revealing of the word is here it's open to us if you can accept that you'll Rejoice with exceeding great joy this bride can't sit still when she sees that opening of the word you can't do it I used to be one of those Quiet Ones in church I know that I used to never move but then I saw that there was an open book and it was mine and when you start eating it when you start eating it it tastes so good ah me and brother Ben we can sit down and eat if it's a good steak we don't sit there and just eat Motionless but we'll sit there that was good that was good we we like that good steak we're gonna eat some more maybe two or three more and so when you sit there and and you really like what you're eating you don't sit there with a frown I do sometimes I'm sorry I said I do we all come to church without having a bad day I know that I'm not I'm not preaching at you I'm preaching it myself okay I can have a bad day too and that's not I'm not not making excuses but I have to I have to I woe is me too sometimes but listen Church what we should do is when that word is being preached when we see the word being revealed for our day in a people in a people it's not no longer just on a tape but in a bride in a body when we see that then that's what's going to help us get it rapturing faith you know the rapturing faith a lot of people used to say and and I'll say it's true in a sense that rapturing Faith lays on the tapes the word is on tape that's right but don't leave it on the tapes the rapturing faith is in you rapturing faith is in me oh where is it it's the third pole it's in you Hattie Wright had it she had it way back in the 60s it's here quit looking for it to come you're looking for something big to happen when it's already here we looked for it and we found it and now we're looking for nothing more than the coming of the Lord but while we're here why not worship him just a little bit for what he showed us why not tell him thank you Lord for showing me this end time word thank you for making a way for me to take a Rapture that ought to make you happy that ought to make you at least smile that ought to make you listen the Baptists can't say that the Pentecostals can Scream and Shout but they don't know what you know that don't make us arrogant but that takes us to a place of understanding who we are and and understanding the revealing word for our day and that take us out of our dead formal traditions we leave those things in the past and we take a hold of a quickening power that is in the word of God and if that word don't Quicken your church it's time you grabbed a hold of the word of God and it will Quicken you it will raise you up it'll make you different it'll make you somebody it'll make you act like a Christian again it'll make you live a life this word will do all these things if you're looking for it to happen it'll take place what are you looking at today I'm looking for the word to make me something just like Jesus and if you see me and you see the rough edges and if you see me and and you say hey you say hey I see all your faults if you're looking for him you're gonna find plenty of them if you're looking brother Brandon said you're gonna get what you expect if you come to the message if the musicians would come I've got to stop if you come into the message and you're looking for mistakes you'll find them every time brother Brandon said he made mistakes but quit looking for him if all you dwell on is mistakes you're not getting fed you're giving room for the devil to breed unbelief in your life but if you'll come back to the scriptures and that word shows you that there is a bride that will be ready and then you see the word that was sent to dress that bride just accept it believe it and rejoice because your names are written in the Lamb's Book of Life do you believe that this evening rejoice and be exceeding glad because you've seen the body word of the son of man I've seen the body of Christ I'm a part of it I I came from somewhere where all I could see was just a glimmer of hope but then I stepped into a Manger I stepped into a little home somewhere where Jesus was and wherever he was I found him and I couldn't stay still no longer I couldn't hold my peace because something that I was looking for was laying right there and he was there all the time all I had to do was just go find him see Jesus has always been there healing has been there your whole life go find it if you're looking for healing I can show you in the word where it's at if you're looking for deliverance from a problem in your life I can show you a promise of Deliverance if you're looking for Christ to come in and give you the Holy Ghost I can show you there's a promise for that too there's promises all throughout the word look for them and when you see him that's Christ to you hold on to those promises and you will rejoice with exceeding great joy you'll worship God in some way some special way God will move upon your life and I've never seen a live person completely still you'll move in some way if there's no movement then maybe you're dead check it out have a doctor check yeah brother Branham calls it Dr Jesus take it back to the word feed on it let that re let that new life come in you let the quickening power take a hold of you and if you'll Stand Together as they play something how many have seen the star and have come to worship Him how many have seen the star and what it represents so it's more than just a story but he has now come into His People he began they saw him as a star he was born as a baby 33 year old man he went and died for you and then when he left he sent his spirit so that you could never have a bad day you will in your flesh but you'll never as a Christian if you look past that look past the flesh we're looking at our problems too much look past that look at the promise you get what you're looking for if you're always looking at your problems you're going to find more problems problem after problem but I'm looking today at a promise Abraham and Sarah had to do that for 25 years you may have to do that your whole life right down to the end and all of a sudden you're like God why did you wait till I'm 100 years old to send me your promise he didn't say when but he said he would if you believe that he will send you the promise just continue to look for it don't look at your circumstances but look at the promised word do we have any believers in the house tonight I believe every one of you are going to make it because I don't look at just the flesh sitting here but I see a people who are hungry for the word of God and who can sit here and can endure service after service and you can sit here and you and maybe you don't feel good and maybe you have you've had trouble at home and and maybe there's there's death in your family or there's sickness and maybe some can't even come but remember quit looking at the symptoms and look to the promise of God there's a Healer there's something you need if you just look just look let's bow our heads together heavenly father as we we bring this service to a close Lord help us not to look at each other through the eyes of of hate or jealousy or or malice or anything Lord but help us to look to you and if we see you we can see our brothers and sisters and and see that you are more than able to take care of their problem too Lord God help us to just draw near to you and and have such a sweet Spirit about us that that it would would draw others to us Lord and not to have that nature that would that would constantly Drive folks away but but Lord help us to love one another despite the differences maybe in our worshiper or the different ways we would go about serving you Lord but but help us to all strive to come under subjection to your word in our own way may we come to your word tonight and and see you for who you are you're the author and the finisher of our faith you're the king of glory you're the wheel in the middle of the wheel you're the you're the rain that's coming down from heaven you're more than life to the church and you're coming soon because we're looking for you and there's a promise that says you're coming back for those who love you and those who are looking for you and we thank you for it Lord if there's one in the building today that need to touch from you to look outside of this human Veil and to see you I pray Lord you would just sanctify their lives now and open their eyes to see the real you to see you in all of your glory today Lord I ask you to be with each member now in the church and each one that's come out tonight in Jesus name amen if there's one that would need it the altar is always

be a part of that that's right looking at Mercy I'm looking at the movie amen that's what I'm a part of I'm a part of a bride without spotter wrinkle I don't care what anybody else says he looked at me he said she's a private not spotted right now amen amen you and I aren't you glad for that tonight hey man I've often thought of that when when John was staying there and the elders spoke to him and he said he was crying he was weeping because the book was or was not able to be open it was no one Worthy and John stood there and I said he said what are we going to do he's crying he knew that all creation was lost enter touched him on his shoulder and he said don't weep John come on now he said the lion of the tribe of Judah has prevailed rebelled yes jumpers are going to look at it but he doesn't see a lion yes yes so what do you see when you look at him today but you see me remix saw a lamb yes hey man I'm so glad we could see him that way amen what a wonderful service I just had a brother Joel doesn't preach like me my goodness I I that's a that's one of the happiest things in my life my brother he's about to call the Lord and I I put I put it on him pretty heavy I held back because he's my brother and I want to make sure it was the Lord and not just the family thing you know they say you you know you're a preacher if you love fried chicken you want to quit your job
