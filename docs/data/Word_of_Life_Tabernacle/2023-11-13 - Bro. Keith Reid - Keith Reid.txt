Jamaica you young people on the front man some of you probably not old enough to remember brother Keith last time he was here but uh brother Keith's from Jamaica so you have to ask him about that after the service and what that's like that'd be exciting to live on an island like that and uh but I believe brother Keith to be a man of God and and a real preacher of the word so let's invite him

years we've spent a lot of time and here and um it's just good to see good friends Amen brother Mike sister Carl and the family amen and all the saints of God and uh you know I think brother Ben we first met online we were friends online I don't know if when you're friends online if you're real friends because but um I just love the body of Jesus Christ amen and I'm glad to be here with you um actually we were in uh South Carolina in in July and um you know the two brothers I was with Brother Joseph hammed and brother Isaiah Brooks we preached together and we made a plan that um in November the 1st and the second week I'm going to come again and uh I'm going to be there in Tennessee and then in Idaho and um you know uh in the mid midst of all that as we made the plan brother Brooks you know had changed the plan so you know I was thinking whether to go back home I said uh-uh I've not been here since 2018 and I'm coming here amen so I told Brother Joseph I said you set the ticket the way you're setting it because I'm coming to Arkansas and so I'm here amen God knows exactly what he's doing Hallelujah so we just thank him and we thank him for the word that has brought us together amen praise God we thank you for the love that we have one for the other and nothing can change that love amen there there's something about true love where nothing can change it amen praise God so amen just glad to be here with you and my wife traveling with me um I I would love to have my children traveling with me but um I don't I don't know if I should call them children or young women or so but they're gone so you know the nest is empty uh we thank God we talk every day and we keep in touch every day or many times for the day but um the experience is different and um it's one of the negative of us living into a third world country where there's not enough um opportunity for our young people you know they leave college and they're moving to the up north and so and so I guess we have about 10 of them young ones there in Canada because Canada has really opened the doors for them and we're we're sad and we're happy because we want to see them move on you know and be happy also but we we thank God for all things just thanking God that there's a day when we'll never part we'll always be together amen so as we go to the word this evening I'd like us to turn a Bibles to the book of Colossians chapter 1 just love that scripture and I'd like to speak on the background of the Bride being the manifestation of Jesus Christ amen because that's what she hears amen praise God so let us just bow our heads as we find it our gracious God and our father want to thank you for this privilege again to be in your house Lord It's not because of our goodness but because of you and so Lord God we pray that Lord God as we turn back the pages oh God may you bring forth the bread of life to us that Lord we might feed on the Eternal Body word of Jesus Christ Heavenly Father Lord God you know what your people stand in need of and we pray oh God that Lord the words that we speak might not just go void but Lord God may find Refuge oh God in the heart of your children the Lord God you would feed us you build that body around our Born Again experience because Lord God we know that we're working for the change of the body and Lord one of these days will come in the full statue of Jesus Christ and we're going to leave out of here so bless us now God as we look to your word father help us oh God to break that which we speak simply enough that our children do understand your word and be drawn closer to you we thank you God for our precious brother Joe and sister Mandy that has been been catering for us oh God and having given us that experience to bring us here this evening may you fill their store basket oh God with all that they stand in need of and Lord God we pray that the bride of Christ oh God will manifest your word we pray believing in Jesus Christ amen and amen you know winter is not my time it's just not my time I guess it's the first time I've travel this time of year so you're seeing me in a strange season amen Colossians 1 and verse2 to 18 giving thanks unto the Father which has made us meet to partak us of the inheritance of the Saints in light who has delivered us from the power of darkness and has translated us into the kingdom of his dear son in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins who is the image of the invisible God oh yeah the firstborn of every creature for by him were all things created that are in heaven that are in Earth visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or Powers all things were created by Him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence may the Lord at his Blessing to the word you may be seated you know brother brandom used the scripture when he preached Christ The Mystery of God revealed yes and I believe that that was not just a a message uh that comes in the series of anything else I think he preached it once but you know I I even look at the time that that message was preached it was uh the the seventh month and the 28th day I think it is significance because when he preached Christ The Mystery of God reveal he was actually preaching the seventh seal yes because the seventh seal brings him back to Earth in word form that's right now there in Christ The Mystery of God revealed brother bam said that Christ might reveal himself completely in Jesus Christ so all the godhead dwell in Christ bodily and I cannot see how somebody could read a passage like Colossians chapter 1 and do see that Christ is God made manifest come on Hallelujah because the Bible says he's the image of the invisible God he's a first born from the dead thank in other words Lazarus came from the dead in a corruptible body but when Christ came from the dead he come in a body that is Incorruptible can die no more can sin no more sin had no more dominion over him right he said Hallelujah not only is a firstborn but he's a creator of all things both things that are visible and invisible but the scriptures speak there that in all things he might have preeminence now if Christ is not God then God would take second place uh if Christ have preeminence but Christ must have preeminence because he not the third person he's not the second person he's not the first person but Christ is the person the Bible says in Colossians 2 for in him dwell all the fullness of the godhead bodily and the seventh angel messenger put it in that form he said all that God was uh he poured it into Christ uh and all that Christ was uh he poured it into you and I our brethren we living below privilege uh we still don't realize who we are am me that we are God God's ear on the face of the Earth by the revealed word of the hour amen hallelujah thank you Lord that God might reveal himself completely in Jesus Christ that Christ might have preeminence in the body of believer in other words not your wife not your husband not your children but Christ preeminence is first person in the body of believer but the third part is that he might take us back to Eden as if there is no fall and Brethren the message of the hour is to restore us back come on sir not into Pentecost not to the faith of the fathers but it's to restore us back to Eden before the fall are you there with me the meek shall inherit the earth Hallelujah soen they replac the first he said Christ is a revelation of God so if God is revealed to you who you know is Jesus Christ then in page 33 of Hallelujah Christ The Mystery of God revealed he said what is the Holy Ghost then it's the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you in other words if you're born again you know who Jesus is is that right amen there listen if the Revelation is hid from you you you're never born again that is why we know that the birth Hallelujah the new birth in this age Hallelujah is to embrace the message of the hour amen because the Bible Hallelujah was there with us all these years uh but we're grouping in darkness uh until Christ break the word uh to you and I and how did he do it Hallelujah he didn't do it through Wesley he didn't do it through mut he didn't do it through Pentecost but there was a messenger that was sent to you and I is that right and in 1962 Hallelujah December he preached uh sir is this the time of the end uh when we talk about all the Mysteries uh amen that were sum from the scripture amen but he went beyond that is that right uh God Was preparing you and I to receive the word of God hallelujah not a word for church uh but a word to change Us in the image of Jesus Christ amen I personally believe uh that the word of God is bringing us to a position uh where one day we will look at one another and we see not you uh amen under the star you are born under or under the family lineage that you come from uh but what we see is Jesus Christ uh made manifest on the face of the Earth again yes sir hallelujah amen so in Christ the mystery said amen the first thing was uh that God wanted to reveal himself to the people amen he couldn't do it as a great Jehovah God who covered all space Time and Eternity he could not uh amen he is too great uh to ever be revealed to people because it would be too mysterious how could that great being amen that never did begin hallelujah amen after he went beyond the cycle of hundreds of billions and trillions and trillions of years uh amen of light space uh amen and on out into it into Infinity amen hallelujah he said he love father wood thank you Lord amen for he was a father hallelujah amen and the only way he could be a father is to express as the son of man is that right amen you notice it said John 1 the Bible said in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God H said it same was in the beginning with God but he said and the Word was made flesh is that right and we beheld his glory now note these words uh the glory as of as of the Holy begotten of the father oh yeah Hallelujah so that condescending of God we could not Behold Him as God no sir so we Behold Him as a Son of God sir our Fin and Ms Hallelujah could not comprehend him as a great Jehovah God Amen standing in our mids uh so God gave us that amen but there's a day coming uh amen when all the fullness uh of the goded bodily is going to be in the Brad uh and we are going to see as he is uh oh and when we see as he is uh what a change that's going to bring to you and I he's going to change our body he's going to change our minds he's going to change our action he's going to change our thinking uh he's going to change everything uh that God can be all in all yes sir what is this that God is bringing to has brought to us we're not feeding on the words of each other we're not feeding on the words of men no sir we're feeding on the living come on now body word of the son of man Jesus Christ amen and the pattern through which God Amen chose to do this to us uh Amen brother bramus amen laid out these things to you and I amen he Hallelujah first part of the message uh He restored the faith of the fathers is the right and in the restoration of the faith of the fathers uh me we know that we are born into the kingdom of God Amen by our faith is a right uh and Peter laid it out uh he said an add to your faith virtue and to Virtue knowledge uh and to knowledge Temperance uh and to Temperance patience uh and to patience godliness uh and to Godliness brotherly kindness uh it seems that we take a child uh anden that child is growing uh amen into maturity Faith uh virtue knowledge Temperance uh amen but the secret of it all is everything that you've got need of uh is in the birth yes yes Hallelujah yes sir amen he said God didn't save you to lose you is it right and when you saved amen you don't have all the virtues uh are you there with me and you're not fully mature amen but your maturity is secure amen God's taking care of it uh there's not enough devil in hell that can stop your maturity in the word of God and the devil is going to come around uh and he's going to try to tell you every day of your life amen that you're not what the word of God Amen say that you areen but we already know that the devil is a liar he's a liar in the beginning uh he's a murderer in the beginning uh are you there with me uh am like the prodal you're going to come to yourself uh and realize who you are in the word of God come on Amen just as we have amen the work of the believer through justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen B the restoration of the briad tree Amen brother BR never stopped there he said sanctification um justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost then the Holy Ghost incarnate which is the word is the rod amen but Satan also have his Rod Amen in James 1 amen turn to 15 he said uh Hallelujah L when it's conceived uh it brings forth sin and sin when it's finished it bring forth death and that's as far as the devil can bring you is the RO but when the seals were open hallelujah amen the prophet of God was bringing it to us uh he said all the Loose Ends uh amen that were left off in the church world uh on the first seal Hallelujah he said what it is uh is a spirit of deception amen Satan is exposed Hallelujah by the revelation of the Supreme dity of Jesus Christ amen hallelujah we went through hallelujah amen a lion age amen then we went through an ox AG uh amen a dark of a coming day uh Hallelujah then through a man AG uh amen lther and Wesley amen men who are shrewd theology a and they were standing up on fundamentalism of men uh amen then it comes uhen the name exposed death is that right and in the fourth seal the name of the Antichrist amen was revealed and that name was de is that right amen but for the Seal of the believer the fourth seal brings bring Deb to a hand in you is it right where the Apostle Paul climbed to that position and and Paul said uh oh de where is thy sting and Grave uh where is your Victory amen Breen Don't Be Afraid uh not even de can stop you are you feel me for if you leave here today uh and mean you're going in the presence of almighty God is a r hallelujah amen but bre the message of the hour Lord is not that we come past the same Mountain like Israel did in the wilderness no sir year after year year after year amen they were going through the same thing the same experience uh is that right uh amen and we went through uh brother B said God bring the individual through the same process he bring the church is it right hallelujah amen we were born in this L of church age but we are not for the age is a r we're been called up uh in Revelation 41 come up higher are you there with me and there's a call in this hour Amen Let us realize uh amen it's not knowledge that take us uh in the presence of God but it's Revelation is that right uh amen that was kain's position amen Cain thought uh amen that the work that he did uh could have saved him uh amen but God needed more than work uh he need Revelation and the Revelation must bring forth uh a manifestation uh amen that the creative power of almighty God might be seen in the bride may I say to you my God Is A Healer oh yeah my God is a savior Hallelujah my God is a Divine interpretator of the word of God hallelujah my God is a god of Resurrection we can take dominion over this Hallelujah over the elements of the earth why because that's what God is bringing us to oh thank you Lord amen the fight today is that the seventh seal is is not open yeah come on is that right but what was the seventh seal it's the coming of Christ yes sir is that right amen not the physical coming of chist but the coming of the word the word coming of chist uh Amen brother Bram said uh the bride coming of Christ uh coming out of the church uh what a resurrection that was uh but what a resurrection this is uh when we are coming to the knowledge of our position in Christ pass uh amen where through the amen the church ages uh amen Our God had revealed amen as a Son of God God's anointing uh in the church uh it brought about the restoration uh of the gifts back into the church uh but we need more than the gifts uh amen being restored in the church uh we need the giv amen back in the church uh Christ uh oh hallelujah amen the word of God uh am reveal in the hearts and the mind of the believer thank you Lord amen that's why the anointed ones in the end time yes brother Brenham said we're not feeding on the words of man oh that's right man's word will fail is a rot I say something today tomorrow I change my man is that right but when God give you a word that word is eternal and he said God becomes guilty of his word until he brings it to pass uh and every promise of God amen that is given to you you can hold on to that promise uh you can hold on to that promise uh you can hold on to that promise uh and if you would believe in that promise uh Hallelujah Heaven and Earth will pass away but that promise cannot fail what God want in this hour is somebody going to take him at his word he say itth I believe it and that setts it amen hallelujah amen hallelujah amen he said John 14:23 Jesus answered and said unto him if a man love me he will keep my words oh yes and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our aboard with him oh yeah before the coming of the word those scripture meant nothing to us uh amen but now that is a living reality amen that God is in
