[45:16] unto you by the word of the lord

[45:21] the coming of the lord shall not prevent
[45:22] them which are asleep

[45:27] heaven with a shout
[45:29] with the voice of the archangel and with
[45:31] the trump of god
[45:33] and the dead in christ shall rise
[45:36] first
[45:37] and then we which are alive and remain
[45:39] oh i hope to be alive and remain i
[45:41] believe i'll be alive and remain at that
[45:43] day yes
[45:45] shall be caught up together with them in
[45:46] the clouds to meet the lord in the air
[45:49] and so shall we ever be
[45:52] with the lord i pray the lord would add
[45:53] his blessing to the word you may be
[45:55] seated this morning
[46:00] when jesus died on the cross and rose
[46:02] from the dead on easter sunday
[46:05] early in the morning almost 2 000 years
[46:07] ago
[46:08] it was not an isolated event
[46:12] it was an event that was the culmination
[46:15] of everything that had been spoken of by
[46:17] the prophets
[46:19] everything that had been spoken of that
[46:21] had been shadowed in the law
[46:24] all of the things that had come before
[46:26] him all the great men of faith that had
[46:28] come that spoke of that event and it was
[46:31] speaking of something that would come
[46:34] that would be greater
[46:35] than a law that could only tell you what
[46:38] you did wrong but it actually spoke of a
[46:40] time
[46:41] that when we could be raised from our
[46:43] sins by the power of god that we could
[46:46] be born again that we could be new
[46:48] creatures
[46:49] in christ jesus and we know that when he
[46:51] died it was not an isolated event and
[46:53] that there was a resurrection
[46:55] of old testament event or saints at that
[46:58] time in matthew 27
[47:00] verse 50 it says jesus when he had cried
[47:02] again notice with a loud voice
[47:05] he yielded up the ghost
[47:07] and behold the veil of the temple was
[47:09] rent and twain you're gonna have to help
[47:11] me this morning i'm just a little bit
[47:13] under the weather but god knows this
[47:14] morning amen amen aren't you glad to be
[47:16] in church this morning
[47:18] he said behold the veil of the temple
[47:20] was rent and twain from the top to the
[47:22] bottom the earth did quake and the rocks
[47:25] ran and the graves were open
[47:27] and many bodies of the saints which
[47:29] slept arose and came out of the graves
[47:32] after his resurrection and went into the
[47:34] holy city and appeared unto many
[47:36] remember joseph when he was down in
[47:38] egypt they carried his bones down to
[47:40] egypt or he died there in egypt and they
[47:43] he said don't leave my bones here he
[47:45] said i want them to be carried with you
[47:47] when you go into the land of promise and
[47:49] so 400 years later they carried those
[47:52] bones back into the promised land
[47:54] because he was waiting by the danny for
[47:56] this event that would take place and
[47:57] when jesus cried with a loud voice that
[48:00] the dead would begin to raise from their
[48:01] grave
[48:03] and paradise would be emptied and now
[48:05] here would come abraham and sarah here
[48:07] would come joseph here would come jacob
[48:10] all of the patriarchs would come up at
[48:11] that time and they would go into into
[48:14] another dimension now watch now what
[48:17] happened at that time that jesus was was
[48:20] here on the earth and he proved himself
[48:22] to be raised for 40 days
[48:26] and then in acts chapter 1 and verse 9
[48:28] it says and when he had spoken these
[48:30] things while they beheld he was taken up
[48:32] yeah so there was a rapture
[48:35] of christ at that time
[48:36] an ascension he said in the cloud
[48:39] received him out
[48:40] of their sight
[48:42] so it speaks of that it speaks of of
[48:45] something now he wasn't done what he did
[48:47] is he went to become a mediator for you
[48:50] and i
[48:50] to become the lamb aren't you glad you
[48:52] have an advocate with the father
[48:55] john said if any man sin he has an
[48:57] advocate with the father we're not
[48:58] depending on our own good works to make
[49:00] it in but we're depending on the blood
[49:02] of the lamb that was shed on calvary and
[49:05] that advocate is before the father that
[49:07] advocate speaks for us and that body was
[49:10] there in heaven but his spirit came back
[49:13] remember the blood cell was broken on
[49:15] calvary and when the blood that come out
[49:16] of his body was broken when the spirit
[49:19] of that was released because the reason
[49:21] there had to be blood is because blood
[49:22] showed life had been given
[49:25] life is in the blood if you've got no
[49:26] blood in you you've got no life in you
[49:28] when the blood cell was broken on
[49:30] calvary the life come out of it and it
[49:32] came back 50 days later on the day of
[49:34] pentecost yes this earth right they went
[49:37] up in the upper room after he ascended
[49:39] and they waited for 10 days and at the
[49:42] end of that 10 days here come the holy
[49:44] spirit like cloven tongues of fire down
[49:46] on them and it was the literal life of
[49:48] jesus christ coming back on each and
[49:51] every one of the believers right and let
[49:53] me tell you this brother bannon put it
[49:54] this way he said what a resurrection
[49:56] that was but what a resurrection this is
[50:01] because now we have the literal life of
[50:03] christ back on the believer again so
[50:05] that you and i can live a life of
[50:07] resurrection not by our own merit not
[50:09] because of something we've done but
[50:11] because of something he did
[50:13] and that life comes back on us and it it
[50:16] ignites us to the word yes
[50:18] it quickens us to the word it makes us
[50:21] alive to the word yes sir
[50:23] so easter speaks of a future
[50:26] resurrection and then one day you say
[50:28] well i may go by way of the grave my
[50:30] parents went by way of the grave my
[50:31] loved ones went by way of the grave yes
[50:33] they may but one day there will come
[50:34] another resurrection
[50:37] those that are asleep in christ will
[50:39] raise and when they raise then it won't
[50:41] be long we which are alive and remain
[50:44] be caught up together with them to meet
[50:46] them
[50:48] in the air right
[50:50] now watch we are
[50:52] already quickened
[50:54] as christians today i trust that
[50:57] we are christians here today and if
[50:59] you're not
[51:00] you can be quickened by
[51:02] the new birth into the life of christ
[51:04] we're quickened
[51:05] and we will not be and i want you to
[51:07] catch this this morning
[51:09] we will not be part of that future
[51:11] resurrection yeah
[51:14] unless we are raised with him now
[51:18] and many times first thessalonians 4
[51:20] i've stood at many graves and read that
[51:22] brother joe as a
[51:24] as a memorial or as
[51:26] it gives hope to people because he said
[51:27] comfort one another with these words
[51:30] and so i'll read that at the graveside
[51:32] and you believe that the person that
[51:33] went down is going to also come up
[51:36] yes right and it gives us hope that we
[51:39] know but see the person that went down
[51:41] went down believing in their mind and
[51:44] their heart
[51:45] and their life had been quickened to the
[51:47] word
[51:48] unless they were quick into the word
[51:49] before they went down they won't ever
[51:52] come up until the general resurrection
[51:53] of the dead to be judged
[51:55] but i don't want to be in that
[51:56] resurrection
[51:58] i don't want to be judged based on the
[51:59] deeds of my life and the works that i've
[52:01] done i want to be quick into the word
[52:04] now so that i don't have to pay for the
[52:06] things that i did when i lived in sin
[52:08] and did the things that i did i don't
[52:10] have to pay for that because christ took
[52:12] the penalty of my of my sin
[52:14] and through his death on the cross he
[52:16] quickens me to himself into his own life
[52:20] ephesians 2 1 and 1-7 tells us about it
[52:24] it says you hath he quickened yes quick
[52:27] and is simply to be made alive
[52:29] he has made you alive how many are alive
[52:32] this morning
[52:34] oh if you're alive there's movement amen
[52:37] if you're alive it does something to you
[52:39] it caused you to do the works of god you
[52:42] have to be quick and who were dead who
[52:44] were dead in trespasses and sins amen he
[52:47] said wherein in time past you walked
[52:49] according to the course of this world
[52:52] according in other words you did what
[52:53] everybody else does yes
[52:55] that's the way you used to live you said
[52:57] brother ben why do you live so different
[52:59] it's not because of some kind of a cult
[53:01] but in times past we we walked according
[53:04] to the course of this world but now
[53:06] according according to the course of
[53:08] god's word
[53:10] and so they walked according to the
[53:11] course of this world according to the
[53:13] prince of the power of the air the
[53:15] spirit that now worketh in the children
[53:17] of disobedience
[53:19] among whom also we all someone say all
[53:22] we all had our conversation that's
[53:25] lifestyle
[53:26] that's the way we lived
[53:28] all of us had our conversation in times
[53:31] past some of us could say amen to that
[53:33] this morning all of us have had our
[53:35] conversation in times past in the lust
[53:37] of our flesh fulfilling the desire of
[53:39] the flesh and of the mind and we're by
[53:41] nature the children of wrath even as
[53:43] others
[53:44] but god yes yes
[53:46] oh there's the merciful part this
[53:48] morning oh don't you feel good on easter
[53:50] we can read the scripture that says but
[53:52] god
[53:53] who was rich who is rich in mercy
[53:56] for his great love we're with theeth
[53:58] loved us
[53:59] oh my aren't you glad that he loves you
[54:01] today
[54:02] even when we were dead in sins hath
[54:04] quickened notice half quickened us yes
[54:08] if you've been born again you have been
[54:09] quickened you will be raised but you are
[54:12] already raised on the inside and the
[54:13] inner man even when we were dead and
[54:15] sins hath quickened us together with
[54:17] christ by grace you are saved yes and
[54:21] hath raised us up
[54:23] together
[54:25] i want you to watch this this morning
[54:28] because he does not raise you up alone
[54:33] he does not raise you up for your own
[54:35] purposes
[54:36] that's right he does not raise you up to
[54:38] be separate from the church
[54:41] separate from the body of christ
[54:43] but he raised you up together
[54:46] if you've been quick and you've been
[54:47] raised up together yes
[54:49] to sit together
[54:52] somebody say together this morning
[54:54] he's raised you up together
[54:56] to sit together
[54:58] in heavenly places in christ jesus yes
[55:02] that in the ages to come he might show
[55:04] the exceeding riches of his grace
[55:08] oh you mean it's not all but
[55:10] oh i don't know how you feel but if if
[55:12] all that he ever showed me is what he's
[55:13] already shown me
[55:15] that's more than i ever deserved
[55:18] the moment i got saved brother jesus
[55:20] that's all that he'd ever done for me
[55:22] was save my soul from sin that's more
[55:24] than i ever deserved when i've been
[55:26] healed in my body if that's all he ever
[55:28] did for me was heal me in my body that's
[55:30] more than i ever deserved what about you
[55:32] this morning but he said in the ages to
[55:35] come he wants to show you the exceeding
[55:37] riches of his grace and his kindness
[55:39] toward us through christ jesus oh
[55:42] there's a great there's a great
[55:44] knowledge he wants to give you a great
[55:46] understanding of himself he wants to
[55:47] fellowship with you through endless ages
[55:50] how is he going to do that by
[55:52] fellowshipping with you now
[55:55] by the new birth yes
[55:58] hallelujah
[56:00] hallelujah now
[56:02] branham tells us the new birth is christ
[56:04] it's a revelation god has revealed to
[56:06] you this great mystery that's a new
[56:08] birth what what is that mystery it's the
[56:10] mystery of christ in you the hope of
[56:11] glory
[56:13] the mystery of him not
[56:14] the son
[56:16] of john and sharon pruitt even though i
[56:18] am in the flesh
[56:19] understand i have a higher calling
[56:22] i'm a son of god
[56:24] amen and so now it's revealed to you
[56:27] this great mystery and that's a new
[56:29] birth he said now what are you going to
[56:30] do when you get all that group together
[56:32] where have we been raised up
[56:34] together yes
[56:36] amen well it was a shout for by the
[56:38] steward to bring us the bride together
[56:42] right that's why the prophet told us the
[56:44] shot would bring a bride together what
[56:45] are you going to do when you get all
[56:46] that group together
[56:48] oh my i believe he could do great things
[56:50] this morning i believe he can meet your
[56:51] knees brother man i don't understand
[56:53] everything you're saying you don't have
[56:54] to understand you just have to reach out
[56:56] by faith and say lord i'm not reaching
[56:58] out to a preacher i'm not reaching out
[57:00] to someone else i'm reaching out to you
[57:02] lord yes i'm reaching out to you i
[57:04] believe by faith i can touch you today
[57:06] and if i have a need that need can be
[57:08] met today
[57:10] oh my yes what are you going to do when
[57:12] you get all that group together where
[57:13] the revelation is perfectly in harmony
[57:15] and god expressing it through his word
[57:17] but the same actions the same things
[57:19] that he did making the word manifest
[57:22] he said oh if the church only knew its
[57:24] position it will one day yes he said
[57:26] then the rapture will go
[57:29] when it knows what it is he doesn't say
[57:30] the rapture will come
[57:32] amen but the rapture will go
[57:37] why because you've already been raised
[57:40] so when it's rapture time you are the
[57:42] rapture
[57:44] amen the quickening power was already in
[57:46] the body of christ so when the body was
[57:48] dead
[57:49] but the quickening power quickened him
[57:50] to the word of his resurrection and he
[57:53] was raised from the dead
[57:55] so the quickening power is already in
[57:56] you i think i put a picture on there of
[57:59] an apple tree an apple tree is a it's an
[58:01] interesting thing because
[58:03] everything that's going to be in the
[58:04] apple tree is already in it
[58:07] i want you to think about this this
[58:09] morning yes sir yeah listen what you you
[58:12] it's not a
[58:13] our religion if we can put it that way
[58:15] our gospel is not a gospel of
[58:18] tomorrow right putting things off well
[58:20] one day i'll be okay
[58:23] i just mired in sin now but one day i'll
[58:25] be all right one day one day i'll be
[58:27] able to overcome one day i'll be able to
[58:29] do these things no it's a gospel that
[58:31] lives today
[58:33] because even if you're just a sapling if
[58:35] an apple tree is just a little cutting
[58:38] that you take and you plant it in the in
[58:40] the dirt when it's in the small added
[58:42] smallest form
[58:44] it already has in it everything that it
[58:46] will be
[58:48] right the instructions are hard coated
[58:50] in it of what it'll be yes
[58:53] amen
[58:54] everything that it will be is already on
[58:56] the inside of the apple tree then what
[58:58] does the apple tree have to do
[59:00] it's just a little bitty sprout but
[59:02] every bushel of apples every blossom
[59:04] every leaf that'll ever be on the trees
[59:05] on it right then what do you have to do
[59:07] with the tree you got to plant it yeah
[59:10] water it
[59:11] and then let it drink
[59:14] it has to drink now when the apple tree
[59:16] is small it drinks more than its portion
[59:20] because it's not going to stay small all
[59:22] right
[59:23] yeah are you with me this morning and
[59:24] that's how we receive the blessings of
[59:26] god we don't we're not intending to stay
[59:28] in the condition we're in now
[59:31] one of these days i won't have to worry
[59:32] about allergies
[59:36] one of these days i won't have to worry
[59:38] about a body like this
[59:40] one of these days i'm going to be
[59:41] everything that god meant for me to be
[59:43] yeah
[59:44] i didn't mean that not to worry about
[59:45] being fat
[59:47] god loves me even though i'm fat i saw
[59:48] that look on joel's face
[59:52] bless his heart
[59:53] you're gonna sit somewhere else
[59:58] but one
[1:00:00] one of these days i'm going to be
[1:00:01] something more
[1:00:03] or something less
[1:00:06] i'm going to be more what god wants me
[1:00:08] to be are you with me this morning
[1:00:11] one of these days i'm reaching for
[1:00:13] something else and so we're not planning
[1:00:15] on being what we are so we drink more
[1:00:17] than our portion
[1:00:19] right because when we drink more than
[1:00:20] our portion it swells out and begins to
[1:00:23] push out limbs
[1:00:24] and branches
[1:00:26] right and eventually fruit we're
[1:00:28] drinking more than what we are oh if you
[1:00:30] could only understand that don't just
[1:00:32] continue to be what you are you say
[1:00:33] brother ben i am what i am this is the
[1:00:35] way my family is this is the way i've
[1:00:36] always been treated this is what i've
[1:00:38] always been don't stay there
[1:00:40] but be what god wants you to be take the
[1:00:43] word of god and drink it in and as you
[1:00:45] drink of it as you partake of it then
[1:00:47] ask god lord help me to help me to not
[1:00:49] just read it but to become it and when
[1:00:51] you become it you actually push out and
[1:00:54] you begin to manifest what was in you
[1:00:56] all the time
[1:00:58] hallelujah
[1:00:59] oh my brother branham told us that
[1:01:01] divine healing the power of god and all
[1:01:03] those other things is in every
[1:01:05] individual in here let's receive the
[1:01:07] baptism of the holy ghost for you are
[1:01:08] planted in
[1:01:10] christ yes
[1:01:12] hallelujah the holy ghost baptism yes

[1:02:53] and david tells us that the the

[1:03:11] get out i promise
[1:03:14] but the key then to the rapture and
[1:03:16] resurrection is the new birth
[1:03:19] yeah right you've got to have the token
[1:03:21] if we could put it like that or the
[1:03:22] ticket to be able to go in the airplane
[1:03:25] to be able to go in the rapture
[1:03:28] by the death burial and resurrection of
[1:03:29] christ he's quickened us together with
[1:03:31] him we become his body on the earth
[1:03:33] we're quickened to
[1:03:35] the word
[1:03:36] brother and put it this way he said
[1:03:37] jesus body was quickened after it was
[1:03:39] dead and in the grave jesus body was
[1:03:42] quickened by the word of god
[1:03:45] and transformed
[1:03:46] from a dead cold image
[1:03:49] to a resurrected glorified son of god
[1:03:53] now what word was he was he quick and by
[1:03:55] about psalm 16
[1:03:57] david spoke and said for thou will not
[1:03:59] leave my soul in hell
[1:04:01] neither will thou suffer thy holy one to
[1:04:03] see corruption
[1:04:05] right one scripture is written about the
[1:04:07] resurrection
[1:04:08] and jesus read that
[1:04:10] scripture right because he was the son
[1:04:13] of god like us
[1:04:15] he read the old testament where it said
[1:04:17] that he read david's writing i will not
[1:04:18] suffer that holy one to see corruption
[1:04:20] and the word was quickened to him
[1:04:24] hallelujah by the spirit that was in it
[1:04:27] and when his spirit with his went down
[1:04:30] into hell and preached to the souls in
[1:04:31] prison which were told by the scriptures
[1:04:33] that he did for three days and he comes
[1:04:35] back up to pick up that body he raised
[1:04:38] by believing the very word that was
[1:04:40] already written because he was already
[1:04:42] quick and to it
[1:04:44] yes oh my he said that word is to has to
[1:04:47] come to pass do you realize how powerful
[1:04:49] it would be if you and i could be
[1:04:51] quickened today to the word that he says
[1:04:53] i am the god that healeth all thy
[1:04:55] diseases yes
[1:04:57] if you can be quick into that word today
[1:04:59] i can repeat it to you you can hear it
[1:05:02] but if you could have the holy spirit
[1:05:04] settle it down in your heart you could
[1:05:05] say i'm healed
[1:05:07] no matter what the symptoms say no
[1:05:08] matter what anybody else says i'm healed
[1:05:11] oh my no matter what temptation you
[1:05:12] might go through if you could if you
[1:05:14] could if that word could be quicker to
[1:05:16] you he that believeth on me shall not
[1:05:18] perish but have everlasting life if you
[1:05:20] believe on him that word is quickened to
[1:05:22] you and it becomes alive
[1:05:25] are you with me now it could raise you
[1:05:26] up out of whatever it is in your life
[1:05:28] that keeps you back
[1:05:30] yeah do you believe that this morning
[1:05:33] and if you believe in it it's quickened
[1:05:35] to you
[1:05:36] then you've got to plant it in your
[1:05:37] heart
[1:05:39] and it'll raise you as it raised him
[1:05:42] he said that word has to come to pass
[1:05:43] it's god's word
[1:05:45] plant it in your heart if you want to go
[1:05:47] in a rapture
[1:05:48] if you want to be genuine christians
[1:05:50] place this word
[1:05:52] he said told ezekiel god said take that
[1:05:54] scroll and eat it up
[1:05:56] and he said that the prophet and the
[1:05:57] word would become the same and every
[1:05:59] promise in there has to manifest itself
[1:06:01] because it's god's original
[1:06:03] he said don't let you let some educated
[1:06:05] theologian out here try to pump it out
[1:06:07] of you
[1:06:08] yeah
[1:06:10] oh we can stop there a while
[1:06:12] don't you let him spray you with that
[1:06:14] carnal science and knowledge in
[1:06:16] education you don't get it by education
[1:06:19] he wasn't raised because of what school
[1:06:20] he went to he was raised because the
[1:06:23] quickening power was in it
[1:06:26] who am i in it quicken him to the word
[1:06:28] you're not raised because you were
[1:06:29] raised in the message it has nothing to
[1:06:31] do with it
[1:06:33] because you believe a certain doctrine
[1:06:35] or go to a certain church has nothing to
[1:06:37] do with it
[1:06:38] or how much how many novenas you say or
[1:06:41] how many how many uh rosary beads that
[1:06:44] you rub or how many tapes you listen to
[1:06:46] it doesn't matter yeah
[1:06:48] right has nothing whatsoever to do with
[1:06:50] the new birth yeah it only it can only
[1:06:52] it's it's word
[1:06:54] it's the true word but it can only be
[1:06:56] quickened by the holy spirit yes sir and
[1:06:59] if it's not quick and you won't raise if
[1:07:01] it is quicken you will raise
[1:07:03] are you with me this morning yes sir
[1:07:05] that's it
[1:07:06] that's what
[1:07:07] we were taught now
[1:07:09] and that's what we we have to believe if
[1:07:11] we believe the word now
[1:07:13] he said don't let somebody talk you out
[1:07:15] of that
[1:07:16] some theologian talks you out of that
[1:07:18] try to pump it out of you yes be quick
[1:07:20] and by the word
[1:07:22] it's the holy ghost that does that for
[1:07:24] you
[1:07:25] now he said we haven't joined nothing or
[1:07:27] bargained for nothing
[1:07:31] the christian life is not a bargain
[1:07:34] god if you'll give me peace in my
[1:07:36] marriage i'll give you so much of this
[1:07:39] that's not what it's about

[1:07:43] i'll i'll give you this i'll pay my
[1:07:45] tithes lord i'll i'll go to church yeah
[1:07:47] it's not a bargain
[1:07:50] you don't make a bargain with god lord
[1:07:52] if you take this desire to smoke to
[1:07:54] drink to

[1:08:02] things no you don't make a bargain with
[1:08:03] god
[1:08:04] we don't join nothing
[1:08:07] we don't bargain for nothing
[1:08:10] that's not how you were born into this
[1:08:11] world
[1:08:15] think about it for a minute you didn't
[1:08:17] join nothing yeah
[1:08:20] you they didn't make you sign up because
[1:08:22] you know maybe some of our kids wouldn't
[1:08:23] have signed up to be in our families if
[1:08:24] they'd known
[1:08:27] they would
[1:08:28] if you made them sign a letter of intent
[1:08:30] you know like to do in college
[1:08:32] find a letter of intent to be born
[1:08:36] yeah well that that's never going to
[1:08:38] happen in the family we just cease to be
[1:08:40] you know
[1:08:42] they never they never bargained for
[1:08:43] nothing
[1:08:44] never joined nothing it's not like okay
[1:08:46] i'll be born if
[1:08:49] if you provide me with a good home and
[1:08:51] have good clothes no at the time
[1:08:53] appointed
[1:08:54] the baby gets to the right size
[1:08:57] and it's born
[1:08:59] that's what happens when you're born
[1:09:00] into the kingdom of god
[1:09:02] at the appointed time whenever god has
[1:09:04] appointed to call you into his kingdom
[1:09:06] because no man can come to god god no
[1:09:09] man looks for god god seeks man
[1:09:12] right he's seeking you this morning
[1:09:13] you're not you thought it was you
[1:09:14] looking for him he's looking for you
[1:09:16] yeah
[1:09:17] and so at the right time he comes to you
[1:09:19] you don't get to bargain with him well
[1:09:21] i'll keep so much of the world and i'll
[1:09:22] keep this and that you don't get to
[1:09:24] bargain with him
[1:09:25] you come to him and say lord i surrender
[1:09:27] everything that i am
[1:09:29] i give everything that i have i i'm
[1:09:32] crucifying myself paul says i am
[1:09:34] crucified with christ therefore i live
[1:09:37] right not i but christ liveth in me yes
[1:09:40] amen
[1:09:41] unless you die with him you'll never be
[1:09:43] raised with him we haven't joined
[1:09:45] nothing or bargained for nothing we just
[1:09:46] believe lord to eternal life
[1:09:49] and you sealed us in there by the
[1:09:50] baptism of the holy ghost and quickened
[1:09:53] our bodies and quickened our spirits and
[1:09:55] quickened us then to see visions and
[1:09:57] prophesy speak in tongues see great
[1:09:58] signs and wonders take place
[1:10:00] see those things are the after effects
[1:10:02] we don't we don't we don't say that
[1:10:04] those things are something we work up in
[1:10:06] the church that's the after effects of
[1:10:08] it
[1:10:09] what we want is the quickening power
[1:10:11] right
[1:10:12] right but the after effects is speaking
[1:10:14] in tongues visions prophecy all these
[1:10:15] other things
[1:10:16] and see great signs and wonders takes
[1:10:18] place he said why it's the living god
[1:10:20] we're into that body when to the world
[1:10:22] is foolishness to them that perish but
[1:10:24] to we who believe it's the power of god
[1:10:27] unto eternal life we thank before father
[1:10:30] he's praying he said now let it be known

[1:11:15] water that's a symbol of what we believe
[1:11:17] in water baptism in the name of jesus
[1:11:19] christ but that's a symbol of something
[1:11:20] yes it's a symbol of the burial of being
[1:11:23] buried in a cold grave being raised in
[1:11:26] newness of life
[1:11:28] but one spirit you're baptized into his
[1:11:30] body it's the new birth that quickens
[1:11:32] you to the word
[1:11:34] yes now let me just kind of dwell on
[1:11:36] this for a moment and we'll move on
[1:11:38] because there's somewhere i want to go

[1:11:43] just close when it's time to close now

[1:11:48] down these scriptures i don't have time
[1:11:50] to go to all of them but if you've been
[1:11:51] quick into hebrews 10 25 you go to
[1:11:53] church
[1:11:56] jesus was quickened
[1:11:58] to
[1:11:59] quicken two psalms where david said i'll
[1:12:03] not leave my your soul in hell or suffer
[1:12:05] my holy one to seek corruption and he
[1:12:06] raised
[1:12:09] what is hebrews 10 25 he said don't

[1:12:41] of justification you might even be in a
[1:12:43] stage of sanctification trying to make

[1:12:46] gets quickened by the holy spirit to the
[1:12:48] word you will do what the word says yes

[1:17:04] nails in his hands brother danny was my
[1:17:06] representative
[1:17:08] he represented me
[1:17:10] and they drove his nails in his hands
[1:17:13] and he laid there on a cross he hung
[1:17:15] there on a cross
[1:17:17] for my sins
[1:17:19] my representatives put him there my
[1:17:21] rebellion my sin
[1:17:25] but his love
[1:17:27] hallelujah his love
[1:17:30] not only caused him to go to the cross
[1:17:32] but caused him to raise up from the dead
[1:17:34] when we could not limit what the laws we
[1:17:36] read do you wednesday night could not do
[1:17:38] and that was weak to the flesh god
[1:17:40] sending his own son in the likeness of
[1:17:42] sinful flesh and forth sin condemned sin
[1:17:44] in the flesh that's the gospel yes
[1:17:48] it's not self-help it's not struggling
[1:17:50] and
[1:17:51] and oh everything today is all about oh
[1:17:53] if we get you coach you enough and get
[1:17:55] you into enough classes give you a
[1:17:56] position in the church nonsense
[1:18:00] you've got to be born again
[1:18:04] you'll find your place in the house of
[1:18:05] god
[1:18:06] if you're born again
[1:18:10] but the brown said the word if you're
[1:18:11] predestined you see it
[1:18:14] there's no way to hide it from you
[1:18:16] you look there and say why it's just so
[1:18:17] plain before my face
[1:18:19] i look at it there it is i'm looking
[1:18:21] right at it i see it here it is the word
[1:18:23] every word this word by word living out
[1:18:25] he said then there's a taste of eternal
[1:18:27] life that you want
[1:18:29] you've got to hold the bible says taste
[1:18:31] and see that the lord is good
[1:18:33] there's a taste of eternal life that you
[1:18:35] want you went to church and said man
[1:18:36] there's something about it
[1:18:38] i don't understand it but there's
[1:18:40] something about it you read your bible
[1:18:42] there's something about that something
[1:18:43] that's real
[1:18:44] everything around me is fake
[1:18:46] everything in this world today is fake
[1:18:48] fake friends fake media fake news fake
[1:18:51] politics
[1:18:52] everything's fake but i see something
[1:18:54] real in the hearts of the people i see
[1:18:57] something real in their lives i see
[1:18:58] something real in the holy ghost i see
[1:19:00] something real in the move of the spirit
[1:19:02] i see something real in my bible i see
[1:19:04] something real in the message of the
[1:19:06] hour and you see that and you begin to
[1:19:08] say lord i got a taste for it you begin
[1:19:10] to want it yeah he said then there's a
[1:19:13] taste of eternal life that you want it's
[1:19:14] god's filter and when you breathe
[1:19:16] through that nothing can get through
[1:19:18] that but the holy ghost right he said no
[1:19:20] you got the evidence of the holy ghost
[1:19:21] see a holy man or a woman's taste he
[1:19:23] said they want to live they got eternal
[1:19:24] life and because this word is quickened
[1:19:27] to them they live a thinking man's
[1:19:28] filter in a holy man's
[1:19:31] taste
[1:19:32] listen jesus said because i live you
[1:19:34] will live also
[1:19:36] we know that each age as we're going
[1:19:38] down now we're 2 000 years later many
[1:19:41] things have happened since the
[1:19:42] resurrection of christ that every age
[1:19:44] was quick into the portion of the word
[1:19:45] for their day
[1:19:46] but they could not be quick unto the
[1:19:48] fullness of it because the fullness of
[1:19:49] the word had not yet come
[1:19:51] but we live in the day when the fullness
[1:19:54] of the word is here
[1:19:56] god's only provided a plan for his age
[1:19:57] his son's in the word age quickened by
[1:19:59] the spirit he said like a spark i know
[1:20:01] i'm moving fast but i'm trying to get
[1:20:03] you somewhere this morning get you out
[1:20:04] of here on time he said like a spark
[1:20:06] that's lit off something to make it
[1:20:08] alive
[1:20:08] and seated now in heavenly places
[1:20:12] in present tense
[1:20:15] already alive
[1:20:17] and subject to every promise
[1:20:22] right oh hallelujah
[1:20:24] i'm subject to the promise of the word
[1:20:27] i don't worry about it if i'm subject to
[1:20:29] the promise
[1:20:30] see i'm subject to i'm a subject of this
[1:20:33] nation i pay taxes
[1:20:35] it could be a good or bad thing
[1:20:36] depending on who you are and how much
[1:20:37] you make
[1:20:39] some of y'all just pay taxes didn't you
[1:20:41] i can see by the look on your face
[1:20:43] my money goes out monday
[1:20:47] when you pay taxes
[1:20:49] what does that make you subject to the
[1:20:51] nation
[1:20:53] right but think about it
[1:20:55] you get on the roads you drive down the
[1:20:57] road you don't think about it
[1:20:59] if there's a pothole there you're like
[1:21:00] man they wish to use my taxes better
[1:21:03] but most of the time you expect it to be
[1:21:05] there
[1:21:06] you get aggravated if it's not you walk
[1:21:08] in your house and you don't sit there oh
[1:21:10] i wonder if it'll turn on today
[1:21:12] all right walk over to the to the light
[1:21:14] said oh i wonder oh is it going to
[1:21:16] happen and you flip this oh praise god
[1:21:18] it happened
[1:21:22] but then you walk in you turn every time
[1:21:23] i walk into church i come in if i'm the
[1:21:25] first one here and i usually am i'll
[1:21:27] turn the lights on
[1:21:28] and i don't ever think about it
[1:21:30] i just expect it to work
[1:21:34] i'm subject
[1:21:36] to us hey man i'm subject to a country
[1:21:38] that has electricity when i was in
[1:21:40] africa i remember being in togo and
[1:21:42] every day the lights would go out
[1:21:44] because the warlord who leads that
[1:21:46] country the dictator was actually
[1:21:48] shutting off the electricity in his
[1:21:50] country and giving it to another country
[1:21:52] that didn't have it
[1:21:53] selling it for money putting it in his
[1:21:55] own pocket
[1:21:57] so every day you had to not be make sure
[1:21:58] not to be in an elevator i got where i
[1:22:00] wouldn't take elevators because i was
[1:22:01] afraid you'd be in the elevator when the
[1:22:03] lights went out
[1:22:05] every day the lights go out because
[1:22:07] they're subject to that dictator but we
[1:22:09] live in a country where we expect the
[1:22:10] lights to work
[1:22:12] right we live in a country where we
[1:22:14] expect there'd be a revolution if we
[1:22:15] didn't have electricity you know we we
[1:22:17] care about those things
[1:22:19] but what about the word of god
[1:22:22] amen when he says i'm the god that heals
[1:22:24] all your diseases and you get sick do
[1:22:25] you expect it to work
[1:22:30] when he says i'll lead you and guide you
[1:22:31] through life and you have a difficult
[1:22:32] decision to make do you expect him to do
[1:22:34] it
[1:22:35] he'll do it if you ask him it may not be
[1:22:38] in some great
[1:22:40] great thing where you're struck down off
[1:22:41] of your horse like paul on the road to
[1:22:43] damascus but maybe a still small voice
[1:22:45] that speaks to your heart it says here's
[1:22:46] what to do
[1:22:48] you belong in the house of god
[1:22:50] you belong with the saints of god
[1:22:56] what does that do
[1:22:58] he said you're alive and subject to
[1:22:59] every promise in the word what does that
[1:23:00] do you being a part of god seeing a part
[1:23:02] of the word other men are part of god's
[1:23:03] word seated together seated together
[1:23:06] manifest the entire body of christ
[1:23:08] because there's no leaven among you
[1:23:09] leaven among you just the word only he
[1:23:11] said seated in heavenly places in the
[1:23:13] door in other words no additives to what
[1:23:14] you are just the word in the door where
[1:23:17] he put his name christ jesus no leaven
[1:23:18] among you it brings the entire fullness
[1:23:20] of the godhead bodily among you
[1:23:23] he said it couldn't do it in luther's
[1:23:24] age couldn't do it in wesley's age
[1:23:25] couldn't do it in the pentecostal age
[1:23:27] but in the day when the son of man will
[1:23:28] be manifested revealed what is that luke
[1:23:30] 17 30. he said brought back the church
[1:23:32] together with the entire deity of god
[1:23:34] amongst his people you can't tell me
[1:23:36] there's anything that god can't do today
[1:23:40] there's nothing that god can't do he
[1:23:41] said but my case my situation my kids my
[1:23:44] my family look where they're at there is
[1:23:46] nothing but the danny that god can't do
[1:23:48] today
[1:23:49] why we're living in the word age
[1:23:51] we're living in the fullness of the word
[1:23:53] when he's done what he promised to do
[1:23:56] hey man we're not looking for it to come
[1:23:58] we're living in that time
[1:24:00] he's brought the back to church together
[1:24:01] with the entire deity of god amongst his
[1:24:03] people showing the same visible signs
[1:24:05] manifesting himself like he did at the
[1:24:06] beginning when he was manifested on
[1:24:08] earth in the form of a prophet god that
[1:24:10] was jesus christ he said oh glory
[1:24:12] promised by malachi 4 promised by the
[1:24:14] rest of the scriptures where do you
[1:24:15] worship at the house of god seated in
[1:24:17] present tense yes christ has been
[1:24:19] resurrected and i have been resurrected
[1:24:20] with him and listen there will come a
[1:24:22] day when the dead will be raised yeah
[1:24:25] now remember
[1:24:27] can i give you a few more minutes
[1:24:31] you know i always feel bad for the
[1:24:32] people that don't want to stay a few
[1:24:33] more minutes but
[1:24:34] when a preacher asks you that it doesn't
[1:24:36] mean anything right
[1:24:40] but we'll let you go in a minute
[1:24:42] oh watch i know you're wanting to eat i
[1:24:44] want to eat too
[1:24:46] and look
[1:24:48] somebody
[1:24:49] i don't even tell about that but sure if
[1:24:51] i tell about that they'll get them
[1:24:52] forget to i got a secret food
[1:24:55] secret food over there
[1:24:57] praise god no one but
[1:25:00] those who were in the in the mystery
[1:25:01] under hidden in the mystery know it
[1:25:05] now
[1:25:07] i at least get a tithing off of it
[1:25:09] me and brother stewart now
[1:25:14] everybody's thinking what in the world
[1:25:18] now the the brother branham says that
[1:25:19] there was remember there was a shout
[1:25:21] voice and trumpet remember the scripture
[1:25:22] we read to you i got to get back on
[1:25:23] track
[1:25:25] if you've noticed the thing that
[1:25:26] distracts me the most is food
[1:25:29] my wife's learned that
[1:25:31] if i'm upset or you know in a kind of a
[1:25:33] bad mood she's learned to distract me
[1:25:35] with food that's why i'm the way i am
[1:25:39] so there was a shout voice and a trumpet
[1:25:42] that's the way paul said that was the
[1:25:44] order of the rapture the shout and voice
[1:25:45] of trump we talked about the shout the
[1:25:47] shout was a message together the people
[1:25:48] together were gathered together now
[1:25:50] seated now in heavenly places in christ
[1:25:52] jesus but the romans said the second is
[1:25:54] the voice of the resurrection the same
[1:25:55] voice a loud voice in saint john 11
[1:25:57] 38-44 that called lazarus from the grave
[1:26:00] let's go to john and let's look at john
[1:26:02] and we'll go back up to verse 20 john 11
[1:26:05] and 20 and look at that scripture before
[1:26:07] we close
[1:26:08] it says then martha as soon as she heard
[1:26:10] that jesus was coming
[1:26:11] went and met him
[1:26:13] but mary sat still in the house
[1:26:16] then said martha unto jesus lord if thou
[1:26:18] hast been here my brother had not died
[1:26:20] now remember this is at the tomb of
[1:26:21] lazarus
[1:26:22] and brother branham said this would be
[1:26:23] the same voice would be the voice of
[1:26:25] jesus he spoke with a loud voice he said
[1:26:26] lazarus come forth
[1:26:28] the same voice that would be
[1:26:30] at the rapture
[1:26:31] martha said to jesus lord if thou hast
[1:26:34] been here my brother had not died what
[1:26:36] faith that is
[1:26:38] but i know
[1:26:39] that even now
[1:26:42] whatsoever thou would ask of god
[1:26:44] god will give it to thee yes she hadn't
[1:26:47] given up and he'd been dead for four
[1:26:48] days
[1:26:50] she didn't give up when he got sick
[1:26:52] she didn't give up when jesus didn't
[1:26:54] come
[1:26:55] are you hearing me now
[1:26:57] she didn't get up when she was waiting
[1:26:59] give up when she was waiting she didn't
[1:27:00] give up when all jesus was coming she
[1:27:02] didn't give up when he got there
[1:27:05] she said i believe that if you'd have
[1:27:07] been here he wouldn't have died but i
[1:27:08] know that even now whatever you ask god
[1:27:12] oh hallelujah god will give it to thee
[1:27:16] yes sir
[1:27:17] notice whatever you ask god
[1:27:19] god will give it to thee
[1:27:21] what was it she said the right thing i
[1:27:23] want to show you a woman in our our day
[1:27:25] and hour that did the same thing there's
[1:27:27] a woman by the name of hattie wright and
[1:27:29] hattie wright was a real person not just
[1:27:31] a story that we tell and there's some
[1:27:33] pictures i think on the next slide
[1:27:35] that here
[1:27:37] she had two boys that didn't serve the
[1:27:38] lord and those are the two boys and
[1:27:40] that's a picture of them being baptized
[1:27:42] and many of you know the story but
[1:27:44] hattie wright is there
[1:27:45] and brother branham was telling the
[1:27:46] story about how god moved in a
[1:27:48] supernatural way and spoke and he was
[1:27:50] able to speak and things would come to
[1:27:51] pass
[1:27:52] and and things would happen and it seems
[1:27:54] almost incredible to to the human mind
[1:27:56] to be able to even even hear it and then
[1:27:59] when he when he says it and he's telling
[1:28:01] the story to her there was a little
[1:28:03] widow woman out in the out in the sticks
[1:28:05] didn't have no money didn't have nothing
[1:28:07] she says this she said it's nothing but
[1:28:09] the truth
[1:28:11] and when she does what happens is she
[1:28:13] does the same thing she enters into the
[1:28:15] same place that martha was in now jesus
[1:28:18] wasn't there in a literal body but he
[1:28:19] was there in the form of brother brown
[1:28:21] let me shock you today jesus is still
[1:28:23] here
[1:28:27] brother branham was a part of the bride
[1:28:29] and he was the messenger to the age but
[1:28:31] he didn't when he left god didn't leave
[1:28:33] yeah come on yeah
[1:28:36] so jesus is listening today
[1:28:39] when you come to the tomb amen when you
[1:28:41] come to the hardest part of your life
[1:28:43] when you come to the moment when there's
[1:28:45] no hope when you get to the place where
[1:28:46] there's no there's no future for you
[1:28:50] right
[1:28:51] you hear the word of god maybe in a
[1:28:52] sermon like this and you just say it's
[1:28:54] nothing but the truth
[1:28:57] yeah right
[1:28:58] and he said whatever you ask for god
[1:29:00] will give it to you that's right she had
[1:29:02] a crippled sister she had other things
[1:29:03] she could have asked for money which she
[1:29:05] needed desperately
[1:29:08] but she said i want the salvation of my
[1:29:09] two children yes
[1:29:11] my two boys
[1:29:13] and brother branham said this
[1:29:16] he talked about how even the angels are
[1:29:18] filthy in the sight of god
[1:29:20] how could we as human beings ever come
[1:29:21] to god and speak and ask something and
[1:29:23] get it but jesus said if you ask in my
[1:29:25] name i'll give it to you
[1:29:28] that's what he said i didn't say that
[1:29:30] he said that
[1:29:32] and he said a woman that said the right
[1:29:33] thing
[1:29:34] caused the heart of jehovah
[1:29:37] to say ask her what she wants yeah
[1:29:40] and then give it to her he said it's
[1:29:41] incredible
[1:29:43] but true yeah
[1:29:45] oh my
[1:29:46] he said you know why the plutocrats
[1:29:48] didn't get it or the big folks like that
[1:29:51] because god knew they'd ask things that
[1:29:53] was no good for them watch
[1:29:55] mary said lord whatever you ask
[1:29:58] martha rather said lord whatever you ask
[1:29:59] it'll be done
[1:30:02] but she waited
[1:30:03] right and when the time was right he
[1:30:06] spoke and the lazarus was raised
[1:30:09] now watch we think a spoken word is well
[1:30:12] one day we're going to be able to just
[1:30:13] speak and have such faith that food will
[1:30:15] be spoken onto our table now that would
[1:30:16] be miraculous
[1:30:19] but i can also
[1:30:20] go and shoot a deer well some of y'all
[1:30:23] can
[1:30:24] i'd have to buy a gun
[1:30:28] somebody i'll take a bow and shoot a
[1:30:29] deer
[1:30:30] and go out put food on the table
[1:30:33] but there's nothing i can do about my
[1:30:35] new body
[1:30:38] think about it yeah
[1:30:40] that's what i need
[1:30:45] my children come back from youth camp
[1:30:46] today these children sitting up here
[1:30:48] young people i think about them and
[1:30:51] sitting all through the audience they've
[1:30:52] got a lot of little kids little bitty
[1:30:53] kids i get to thinking about them i
[1:30:55] think i can't even save them
[1:30:58] i can't make them christians
[1:31:00] i can't make my own children christians
[1:31:02] yeah i can't do that i can provide for
[1:31:04] them i can put food on the table i can
[1:31:06] teach them i can set them in the right
[1:31:08] way which we're
[1:31:09] commanded to do
[1:31:11] our kids don't get choices about whether
[1:31:13] or not they want to go to church
[1:31:16] we're commanded by the scripture to
[1:31:18] train up your child in the way it should
[1:31:20] go i mean set it in the right path yes
[1:31:24] but i can do that i can't save them
[1:31:27] but he can yes
[1:31:30] so i feel like martha or maybe hattie
[1:31:32] wright couldn't do nothing about my boys
[1:31:35] every teenager they can do what they
[1:31:36] want
[1:31:37] oh but she said i want the salvation of
[1:31:39] my two children yes i feel like martha i
[1:31:41] can't do nothing about lazarus being in
[1:31:43] it too
[1:31:45] but you can lord yes
[1:31:47] and she said that before that he had
[1:31:49] ever raised from the dead how much more
[1:31:51] would he do it today
[1:31:54] oh my
[1:31:55] i can't do anything about it but you can
[1:31:58] lord
[1:31:59] i can't put myself in a rapture he can
[1:32:02] yes
[1:32:03] but how's he going to do it
[1:32:05] how did he do it through hattie wright
[1:32:07] he said speak whatever you want
[1:32:12] hey man they even asked brother branham
[1:32:14] in the questions and answers i don't
[1:32:15] have time to read it to you but they
[1:32:16] asked him if he could speak and the body
[1:32:17] change would take place and he answered
[1:32:19] that he had the authority but it was
[1:32:20] sovereignly given
[1:32:22] who did he give it to yes
[1:32:25] oh church
[1:32:26] john 11 23 jesus saith and her thy
[1:32:29] brother shall rise again martha said
[1:32:30] unto him i know it shall rise again in
[1:32:32] the resurrection of the last day jesus
[1:32:34] said unto her i am the resurrection
[1:32:37] but matthew mcgarry touches on this last
[1:32:39] week and when he was preaching he didn't
[1:32:40] know what i was going to be preaching on
[1:32:41] today but he touched on this he said
[1:32:44] unto her i am the resurrection
[1:32:46] amen jesus presence is the rapture being
[1:32:49] present yes
[1:32:51] i hope you understand what's happened in
[1:32:52] this day when the word came down when
[1:32:55] the word became present among us it was
[1:32:56] more than a man it was like john
[1:32:58] pointing to a man i must decrease but he
[1:33:00] must increase here comes the man behold
[1:33:03] the lamb of god who takes away the sins
[1:33:05] of the world
[1:33:07] and so i've got to look at him and
[1:33:09] realize he is the resurrection yeah
[1:33:12] are you sorrowful today maybe you've
[1:33:13] lost loved ones and i know several of
[1:33:15] you have lost loved ones recently
[1:33:17] you put them in the grave too young
[1:33:20] but jesus says yeah i am the
[1:33:23] resurrection in the life yes
[1:33:25] he that believeth in me though he were
[1:33:27] dead yet shall he live yes
[1:33:30] and whosoever liveth and believeth me
[1:33:31] shall never die he said believe us how
[1:33:33] this
[1:33:34] she saith unto him yay lord
[1:33:37] i believe that thou art the christ the
[1:33:38] son of god which will come into the
[1:33:40] world when she had so said she went away
[1:33:42] and called mary her sister secretly now
[1:33:44] notice what she did saying the master
[1:33:46] has come and called us for thee as soon
[1:33:47] as she heard that she rose quickly and
[1:33:49] came unto him notice mary without martha
[1:33:52] could not be made perfect if we could
[1:33:54] say it that way could not come to jesus
[1:33:56] because she hadn't heard that he was
[1:33:57] there
[1:33:58] she hadn't heard oh my
[1:34:01] you're going to have to read between the
[1:34:02] lines this morning i've got to move on
[1:34:04] now jesus was not yet coming to the town
[1:34:07] but was in that place where martha met
[1:34:08] him
[1:34:10] remember when isaac came for a rebecca
[1:34:12] or when rebecca came to isaac and
[1:34:14] followed the messenger's message she met
[1:34:16] him in the field remember he left the
[1:34:19] tent and rebecca went to meet him but
[1:34:20] the brandon said remember jesus will
[1:34:22] leave the kingdom will not meet him in
[1:34:24] glory where to meet him in the air he
[1:34:25] said where to meet him in the air
[1:34:26] between heavens and earth where it's
[1:34:28] expanded to redeem us
[1:34:30] and he met rebecca in the middle between
[1:34:32] her home and his home took her into his
[1:34:33] home and married her and fell heir to
[1:34:35] everything his father had
[1:34:37] amen john 11 38
[1:34:39] jesus therefore again groaning in
[1:34:41] himself coming to the grave
[1:34:43] it was a cave remember we preached a
[1:34:44] couple weeks ago he was a man
[1:34:47] in his human flesh
[1:34:49] he was human
[1:34:50] he felt the pain and the loss that they
[1:34:52] felt
[1:34:53] lazarus was his friend
[1:34:55] and so he come groaning in himself he
[1:34:57] comes to the grave it was a cave and a
[1:34:59] stone lay upon it
[1:35:02] jesus said take you away the stone marth
[1:35:05] and martha the sister of him that was
[1:35:07] dead saith in him lord by this time he
[1:35:09] stinketh
[1:35:11] this is an incredible thing you've asked
[1:35:13] us to do
[1:35:15] by this time he stinketh
[1:35:17] he'd been dead four days
[1:35:20] i mean you don't even go around road
[1:35:21] kills been dead four days
[1:35:24] and the bigger the body is the more it
[1:35:25] stinks
[1:35:27] that's just the truth in this in this
[1:35:29] human in this flesh there's got to be
[1:35:30] something more church
[1:35:32] if all there is is this flesh we're as
[1:35:34] paul said of all men most miserable
[1:35:36] because i'll be honest with you if there
[1:35:38] is no resurrection of the dead if there
[1:35:39] is no afterlife if there's no heaven i
[1:35:41] wish i didn't know
[1:35:44] we didn't know what anything
[1:35:46] i wish it was an animal
[1:35:49] right because knowing is just torture if
[1:35:51] all there is is living and dying
[1:35:56] but in knowing
[1:35:57] why did god give us the gift to be able
[1:35:59] to reason to know
[1:36:01] because there's something more yes
[1:36:03] right
[1:36:04] there's got to be something more
[1:36:08] and and so she said by this time he
[1:36:10] stinks but this time that's the way of
[1:36:13] all bodies they decay
[1:36:14] but jesus said the nurse said i not unto
[1:36:16] thee that if thou would just believe
[1:36:18] thou should have see the glory of god
[1:36:21] hallelujah then they took away the stone
[1:36:23] from the place where the dead was laid
[1:36:25] and jesus lifted up his eyes said father
[1:36:27] i thank thee that thou hast heard me
[1:36:29] and i know that thou hearst me always
[1:36:31] but because of the people which stand by
[1:36:33] i said it that they may believe that
[1:36:34] thou hast sent me and when thus he had
[1:36:36] thus spoken he cried with a loud voice
[1:36:38] lazarus
[1:36:40] come forth
[1:36:43] and listen now the what did that jesus
[1:36:46] in
[1:36:46] god in human form
[1:36:49] spoke in the dead race
[1:36:52] who happened again in his resurrection
[1:36:54] when he cried with a loud voice here
[1:36:55] come the dead out of the graves
[1:36:58] about it at the end time
[1:37:00] in whatever form he's in
[1:37:03] listen to me when the time of the
[1:37:05] resurrection comes that's the form he
[1:37:06] speaks in
[1:37:10] think deeply about that
[1:37:12] what form is he going to be in
[1:37:14] i'll tell you what form he's in today
[1:37:16] rather than answer that question maybe
[1:37:17] that's a little bit too deep for us this
[1:37:19] morning but let's answer this question
[1:37:20] what form is he in today
[1:37:22] this yes
[1:37:24] right
[1:37:24] not just here but all of us yeah right
[1:37:27] he's in his body the church the bride
[1:37:29] right
[1:37:30] right
[1:37:30] and he that was dead came forth bound
[1:37:33] hand and foot with grave clothes his
[1:37:34] face was bound with a napkin well he was
[1:37:36] a
[1:37:37] strange creature come out of there can
[1:37:39] you imagine you know he hopped out yeah
[1:37:42] he couldn't walk
[1:37:43] all right his hand and feet are bound he
[1:37:45] comes hopping out of the grave
[1:37:49] what do you raise me for
[1:37:50] well i'm going to show something with
[1:37:52] you
[1:37:52] you know lazarus before lazarus he had
[1:37:54] to die again
[1:37:55] we're going to be raised one day and not
[1:37:57] have to die again
[1:37:59] amen and so jesus said loose him and let
[1:38:01] him go listen in the voice of the
[1:38:03] resurrection is the same voice the voice
[1:38:05] of christ
[1:38:06] and brother branham tells us he said

[1:38:21] he said if it was right
[1:38:23] he said if abraham lincoln was dead in
[1:38:24] the grave if the time was right
[1:38:25] inspiration struck i could do it but i
[1:38:27] can only do what i'm anointed to do
[1:38:30] oh i hope you hear me today
[1:38:32] your voice is when you speak through us

[1:39:52] a man yeah how does he speak what is the
[1:39:55] voice of the resurrection
[1:39:57] but the brandon taught us that the
[1:39:58] church once spoke for god
[1:40:00] you uh musicians go ahead and come i'm
[1:40:02] never gonna quit if you don't the church
[1:40:04] once spoke for god dark ages wesley and
[1:40:06] luther and brother brown said the people
[1:40:07] who took his revelation from god become
[1:40:09] the living epistles read and known of
[1:40:10] all men for their generation
[1:40:12] when the methodist failed he talked
[1:40:14] about the lutherans and the methodists
[1:40:15] when they felt god raised up others so
[1:40:17] it has gone on through the years until
[1:40:19] in this last day there is again another
[1:40:21] people in the land
[1:40:22] under their messenger will be the final
[1:40:24] voice
[1:40:25] to the final age
[1:40:27] he says the members of the virgin bride
[1:40:28] will love him they will have his
[1:40:30] potentials what are his potentials
[1:40:32] he lives yes
[1:40:35] what are my potentials brother joe i'm
[1:40:37] going to live yes
[1:40:39] because he lives i live also
[1:40:41] he was raised from the dead amen aren't
[1:40:43] you glad that he was
[1:40:45] right amen all power belongs to him they
[1:40:47] have his potentials he is their head all
[1:40:49] power belongs to him they are subject to
[1:40:51] him as the members of our bodies are
[1:40:53] subject to our heads
[1:40:55] amen he goes on to talk about the
[1:40:56] harmony between the father and the son
[1:40:59] he said nothing can harm her not even
[1:41:01] death but the seed be planted the water
[1:41:03] will raise it up again do you believe it
[1:41:04] today church
[1:41:05] can you see it is it more than just
[1:41:07] words i know i've moved fast through
[1:41:08] this but is there something on the
[1:41:09] inside of you that speaks and said lord
[1:41:12] i believe hell found my unbelief
[1:41:14] i believe there's something inside of me
[1:41:16] i believe that i have the mind of christ
[1:41:18] i believe i know i've been quick into
[1:41:20] the word
[1:41:22] amen the pride has the mind of christ
[1:41:23] for she knows what he wants done with
[1:41:25] the word she performs the command of the
[1:41:26] word in his name for she has thus saith
[1:41:29] the lord and the word is quickened by
[1:41:31] the spirit and it come to pass like a
[1:41:32] seed that is planted in water it comes
[1:41:34] to full harvest serving its purpose
[1:41:35] those in the bride do only his will no
[1:41:37] one can make them do otherwise yes
[1:41:40] right oh church you can only realize
[1:41:42] that you quit blaming others
[1:41:44] yes
[1:41:45] it's everybody else's fault my wife's
[1:41:46] fault it's my husband's fault no
[1:41:49] it's it's god in you
[1:41:53] those in the bride do only his will what
[1:41:54] is his will he said i don't know what
[1:41:55] his will is it's right here
[1:42:00] they have thus saith the lord or they
[1:42:01] keep still
[1:42:03] they know that it has to be god in them
[1:42:05] doing the works fulfilling his own word
[1:42:07] he did not complete all his work while
[1:42:08] in his earthly ministry so now he works
[1:42:10] in and through the bride she knows that
[1:42:12] for it's not yet time for him to do
[1:42:13] certain things listen
[1:42:16] it was not time for him to do certain
[1:42:17] things that he must now do
[1:42:20] what's left
[1:42:21] yeah
[1:42:22] we're not talking about just being a
[1:42:25] church on the earth because that's been
[1:42:26] here before but there's something left
[1:42:29] to do that he must now do that he
[1:42:30] couldn't do in the flesh
[1:42:32] he healed the sick he raised the dead
[1:42:35] but there's coming
[1:42:37] a general resurrection
[1:42:39] and he's going to do something through
[1:42:41] you somehow you're going to have a part
[1:42:42] in that i can't explain all of that
[1:42:44] but somehow you becoming the word in
[1:42:46] your hour is a part of that general
[1:42:47] resurrection you being the voice of god
[1:42:49] in the last days he said he will now
[1:42:51] fulfill through the bride that work
[1:42:53] but she left for this specific
[1:42:56] time
[1:42:59] listen to me and say play something
[1:43:01] softly
[1:43:04] whatever's left it's your job to do it
[1:43:07] remember i told you last week i believe
[1:43:09] it was the week before
[1:43:11] that brother branham's part was
[1:43:12] identified in 1st thessalonians 4 16
[1:43:15] because it says that
[1:43:17] it says that we which are alive and
[1:43:19] remain will not hinder those which are
[1:43:20] asleep
[1:43:21] all right brother branham went by way of
[1:43:22] the grave
[1:43:24] he was the messenger brought the shout
[1:43:26] to us
[1:43:28] and
[1:43:29] it was he went by way of the grave but
[1:43:31] somebody's got to fulfill first
[1:43:32] thessalonians 4 17 we which are alive
[1:43:34] and remain
[1:43:35] now paul says we because he believed it
[1:43:37] would be him
[1:43:40] i believe it'll be me
[1:43:42] may not be maybe my children my
[1:43:44] grandchildren
[1:43:45] maybe someone else
[1:43:46] [Music]
[1:43:47] but i believe it'll be me
[1:43:51] but whatever is left it's our job to do
[1:43:52] it
[1:43:55] brother branham said the only time i can
[1:43:56] preach is when i'm mortal
[1:43:59] he said as i am now
[1:44:02] i can only preach as long as i'm mortal
[1:44:04] i whatever's left whatever job is for me
[1:44:07] to do whatever i can be quick into the
[1:44:08] word is mine to do
[1:44:11] and only the holy ghost can quicken my
[1:44:13] life to the word
[1:44:15] he said brother ben i don't understand
[1:44:16] that you go to acts 2 38 and peter
[1:44:19] brought the prescription for that this
[1:44:21] is how the
[1:44:23] the spirit quickens your life
[1:44:25] peter said unto them repent and be
[1:44:27] baptized every one of you in the name of
[1:44:28] jesus christ for the remission of sins
[1:44:31] listen i got we got water today if
[1:44:33] you've never been baptized in the name
[1:44:34] of jesus christ following the command of
[1:44:36] scripture we can put water in there we
[1:44:38] can eat and the water will fill up and
[1:44:39] afterwards we can baptize you at some
[1:44:41] point this afternoon when the water
[1:44:42] fills up we'll be glad to do it if
[1:44:45] you've never been baptized maybe you
[1:44:47] have been baptized but you've never
[1:44:48] received the holy ghost but he said you
[1:44:49] shall receive the gift of the holy ghost
[1:44:51] what is the problem what's keeping you
[1:44:53] from receiving the holy ghost it's got
[1:44:55] to be that you haven't surrendered
[1:44:56] yourself to god
[1:44:58] you've just never given yourself over to
[1:45:00] god
[1:45:01] and that's evidence in your life when
[1:45:02] you when you stubbornly do things you
[1:45:04] know is wrong
[1:45:07] i'm talking to you sincerely today this
[1:45:08] is easter time it's a happy time it's a
[1:45:11] resurrection time
[1:45:12] but you've got to be quickened with him
[1:45:14] now or you can't be quickened with him
[1:45:15] over there
[1:45:16] you'll never be raised with him
[1:45:19] if you haven't been quickened with him
[1:45:20] now you can't speak the word you can't
[1:45:22] be the voice of the resurrection
[1:45:24] unless you have been raised from your
[1:45:26] tomb
[1:45:27] unbelief
[1:45:28] peter said you shall receive the gift of
[1:45:30] the holy ghost would you bow your heads
[1:45:31] with me
[1:45:33] maybe there's someone here
[1:45:37] as i feel the presence of the lord here
[1:45:38] this morning
[1:45:40] maybe there's someone here that
[1:45:42] you've never
[1:45:44] really been quickened by the word i'm
[1:45:45] not talking about just maybe raise your
[1:45:47] hands and
[1:45:48] accepted christ or maybe you've been
[1:45:50] baptized
[1:45:52] but you've never been quickened by the
[1:45:53] word and every eye is closed every head
[1:45:55] is bowed
[1:45:56] looking around
[1:45:59] you've never been quickened
[1:46:01] and you know that
[1:46:02] and part of surrendering is knowing that
[1:46:06] and coming to it
[1:46:09] you're not going to be able to talk your
[1:46:10] way into being a better person
[1:46:13] you're not going to be able to educate
[1:46:15] yourself
[1:46:17] and you're not going to be able blaming
[1:46:18] others is a poor strategy because pretty
[1:46:20] soon other people get tired of it
[1:46:24] you've never
[1:46:25] raised from your dead trespasses and
[1:46:27] sins would you raise your hand today
[1:46:30] would you raise your hand and just say
[1:46:31] brother ben would you pray for me
[1:46:33] this easter would be the time god bless
[1:46:35] that hand
[1:46:36] this easter would be the time that i
[1:46:38] could be raised
[1:46:40] i've heard the truth i know what's right
[1:46:43] but god sees your hand god bless you
[1:46:46] is there another that would say for the
[1:46:48] man i've struggled with these things
[1:46:50] i've struggled i know what the word says
[1:46:51] but i have a hard time doing it you just
[1:46:54] want to raise your hand and say lord
[1:46:55] help me today i want to be raised in the
[1:46:57] newness of life
[1:46:59] amen
[1:47:01] amen let's pray for those who raise
[1:47:02] their hands heavenly father
[1:47:05] lord jesus
[1:47:07] it was just one
[1:47:09] lord you you left the 90 and 9 to come
[1:47:11] to one
[1:47:13] lord but there's more than one here
[1:47:14] today
[1:47:16] they need to be raised they want to be
[1:47:17] raised
[1:47:18] or there's something in in their hearts
[1:47:21] maybe even one here that didn't raise
[1:47:22] their hand
[1:47:24] lord there's something working
[1:47:26] art inside of their life they know
[1:47:27] they're not right
[1:47:29] you know they're not
[1:47:31] and me telling it to them won't do any
[1:47:32] good
[1:47:33] but maybe by the anointing of your
[1:47:35] spirit
[1:47:36] you can move in their life and help them
[1:47:38] lord
[1:47:39] or somehow you just come down and you
[1:47:41] tell them all about
[1:47:42] what it is to be a christian
[1:47:45] i pray you granted lord
[1:47:47] lord
[1:47:48] i pray you'd baptize them with the holy
[1:47:50] ghost today if they've not been baptized
[1:47:52] in water may they be quick to go to the
[1:47:54] water and be baptized in the name of
[1:47:56] jesus christ
[1:47:58] lord
[1:47:59] and if they've never received the holy
[1:48:01] ghost may they receive it today lord may
[1:48:04] you may you quicken them to the word
[1:48:06] until they look at the scripture and
[1:48:07] they'd see everything that you say to do
[1:48:09] and they just do it there there'd be a
[1:48:11] desire in their heart to go to church to
[1:48:14] be with god's people to love you with
[1:48:15] all of their heart i pray that you do it
[1:48:18] today for them we know many times lord
[1:48:20] it's not some great thing but even the
[1:48:22] act of raising a hand lord is an act of
[1:48:24] surrender you defy gravity by doing that
[1:48:27] and it causes a person to be surrendered
[1:48:30] to you i pray you'd do it today lord i
[1:48:33] pray for those of us who have the holy
[1:48:34] ghost today who've been quickened by
[1:48:36] your spirit i pray you'd refill us today
[1:48:39] i pray there'd be an infilling of the
[1:48:41] holy ghost in this place
[1:48:43] lord know it may not be lord as usual
[1:48:46] when everybody's here and it's just the
[1:48:49] same crowd but lord may it be the day
[1:48:51] when we're gathered together
[1:48:53] lord you knew who would be here and who
[1:48:55] wouldn't be and we pray god that those
[1:48:57] who are gathered together those that are
[1:48:59] watching on the streams this morning
[1:49:01] lord would just receive a fresh baptism
[1:49:03] of the holy ghost lord that you begin to
[1:49:06] fall down on them lord like you did
[1:49:08] those in the upper room on the day of
[1:49:09] pentecost that their lives would be
[1:49:11] transformed to your word if we've gotten
[1:49:13] cold lord if we have a lack of diligence
[1:49:16] in our life towards the word would you
[1:49:17] come and change us oh god may we be
[1:49:19] raised lord may we be raised today so
[1:49:22] that we can be raised on that day so
[1:49:24] that we can be the voice of the
[1:49:26] resurrection may we be the voice of the
[1:49:28] resurrection in our families the voice
