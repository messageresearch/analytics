[41:14] blessing to you I don't want to uh keep
[41:17] you long tonight so we'll just try to
[41:19] get through it as quickly as we can uh
[41:21] how many you ready to learn from the
[41:22] word and hear the word I just have to be
[41:24] myself I'm not uh uh I wish I was Andrew
[41:27] Glover I wish I was Joel puit but uh but
[41:31] I'm just myself and so we'll just try to
[41:33] preach and but I feel so comfortable
[41:34] tonight and thank you for making the
[41:36] church that way and we want to all be
[41:38] able to sit here and just enjoy the
[41:40] presence of the Lord and and be able to
[41:42] worship God according to the dictates of
[41:43] our heart and so thank you for being
[41:45] here and making it a church like that
[41:47] you do that and I want to thank you for
[41:49] that 2 Chronicles 2621 Uzziah the King
[41:53] was a leper until the day of his death
[41:56] and dwelt D in a several house or a
[41:58] separate house being a leper where he
[42:01] was cut off from the house of the Lord
[42:03] and jotham his son was over the King's
[42:06] house judging the people of the land
[42:09] it's kind of a sobering uh text then in
[42:12] Matthew 1922 another sobering text says
[42:17] in speaking of the Rich Young
[42:20] Ruler but when the young man heard that
[42:24] saying and this is where Jesus told him
[42:27] tell all you
[42:28] have pick up your cross and follow me he
[42:32] said when he heard that saying he went
[42:33] away sorrowful where he had great
[42:37] possessions pray the Lord would bless
[42:39] his reading of the word the reading of
[42:41] the word you may be
[42:43] seated when a man named John Getty
[42:47] arrived in the island of an I am in
[42:51] 1848 the the natives wor no clothes
[42:55] practiced cannibalism in fanticide
[42:58] worshiped
[43:00] Idols when he left 24 years later they
[43:04] put a a plaque up and placed it behind
[43:06] the pulpit of the church that they built
[43:07] there and they said when he landed in
[43:09] 1848 there were no Christians here when
[43:13] he left in 1872 there were no Heathen
[43:16] that's
[43:17] influence good that's influence and I
[43:21] think sometimes we unell the amount of
[43:23] influence we have on other people
[43:26] because we think think that you know
[43:27] well my life hasn't meant much and I
[43:29] haven't you know maybe I'm not a
[43:30] preacher maybe you're not you're not a
[43:33] uh even a Sunday school teacher or
[43:35] something like that you say well I don't
[43:36] have any influence but you do have
[43:37] influence Beyond even your own life in
[43:40] fact the brandom many times would pray
[43:42] and you'd say Lord May our influence go
[43:44] beyond he said even our Lives May it
[43:47] outlive us and and that would be
[43:49] something that we would want now we want
[43:51] to influence people in the right way and
[43:53] so there's influence and there's
[43:55] leadership and it's nice when those two
[43:57] things come together right when
[43:59] influence and leadership are together
[44:01] because you can be in a position of of
[44:03] leadership and not have the influence
[44:05] that you should have for many reasons we
[44:09] want to be if we are in a position of
[44:10] leadership and we are all a leader to
[44:13] somebody in some way and so we want to
[44:16] have the right kind of influence if
[44:17] we're going to be in a position of
[44:19] leadership to be able to influence
[44:21] people so they ties these two together
[44:23] and you'll find that brandom deals with
[44:25] influence in the story of Uzziah he
[44:28] deals and and Isaiah and he deals with
[44:30] the Rich Young Ruler and the story of
[44:32] leadership and then he ties those two
[44:34] together now the the sermon on
[44:36] leadership he preaches to young people
[44:38] and the sermon on influence he's dealing
[44:40] more with uh people in positions and and
[44:44] and preachers and things like that but
[44:45] again I believe the two are tied
[44:47] together and when he deals with
[44:49] leadership the point of the leadership
[44:51] service is that you're going to reach a
[44:54] point where men can't lead you anymore
[44:55] and you got to be led by God God not
[44:57] that you wouldn't be led by a man but
[45:00] but that men can only take you so far so
[45:02] in other words he said when these men
[45:03] died they went beyond uh Earthly
[45:06] leadership and the only one that can
[45:08] give you eternal life is Jesus Christ
[45:10] that's it no human leadership no human
[45:14] ability can give you eternal life your
[45:16] parents can't give it to you your your
[45:19] pastor can't give it to you only Jesus
[45:21] Christ can do that and so if you listen
[45:23] to that and I encourage you to do that
[45:24] you young people you want something to
[45:26] do or something to listen to Listen to
[45:28] influence and listen to leadership
[45:30] brother Brandon preaches both those
[45:31] sermons multiple
[45:33] times now again they're tied together
[45:37] because the leadership in your life is
[45:38] what you're influenced by you can't have
[45:41] one really without the other an
[45:43] effective leader has got to have
[45:45] influence to lead by yeah but sometimes
[45:47] and I know all of you are thinking of
[45:49] some situation where you've had a you've
[45:51] seen somebody in a position of
[45:52] leadership but not a position of
[45:54] influence yeah sure or maybe they would
[45:57] influence somebody
[45:59] wrong but but maybe they just didn't
[46:01] have the influence take I was in a
[46:03] position in a title company here not
[46:05] long ago and and uh I had gotten our
[46:08] title company had gotten bought out by
[46:10] another title company and so I ended up
[46:13] working at Brill title in West Plains
[46:15] and the lady that was there is retired
[46:17] in fact it's changed hands again someone
[46:18] else has bought it out so I'm not
[46:20] speaking telling tales on people uh that
[46:23] are still there but uh I worked for bril
[46:26] title company compan and there was a man
[46:28] who come in a young man who come out of
[46:31] the uh property and casual insurance
[46:33] field and I'm going somewhere with this
[46:34] just just hang with me for a minute but
[46:36] he come out of the property and casually
[46:38] influence or Insurance field and he was
[46:41] become the president of the company he
[46:43] made up cards said president of Brill
[46:45] Title Company he knew nothing about
[46:47] title
[46:48] work nothing about title work but he he
[46:51] he said I've been to school he went to
[46:53] missou he graduated with a business
[46:55] degree business management you know
[46:57] nothing about title work now we had a a
[46:59] 78 or 80-year-old woman I think there in
[47:02] the office named Margaret and Margaret
[47:05] was uh a little bit of a title Savant
[47:09] and in fact I found out later she'd
[47:11] actually owned the company at one time
[47:13] and sold it to a bank made a lot of
[47:15] money and just stayed there because she
[47:17] liked it so she was an employee she had
[47:19] a she didn't have any title at all just
[47:22] an employee but I found out if you
[47:24] wanted if you wanted something done or
[47:26] wanted to know something talk to
[47:28] Margaret because she was a Fountain of
[47:30] Knowledge she'd done it for 50 years and
[47:33] she had a tremendous influence on me as
[47:35] a young person doing title she had a
[47:38] tremendous influence on me because she
[47:41] had she had experience she had
[47:44] everything that it would take to be the
[47:45] leader of a title company and this young
[47:48] man didn't have any of that and so I I
[47:50] you know he' tell us stuff and we just
[47:52] sit there nod at him and then we go do
[47:54] what we were going to do and and we
[47:56] don't want want that do we whatever
[47:58] leadership you have in your life you
[47:59] want you want to have some influence
[48:01] with that you want to be it needs to be
[48:04] to Be an Effective leader you've got to
[48:06] have influence now we don't want just
[48:09] titles you don't want to just be a dad
[48:10] you don't want to just be a father and
[48:12] say you people respect me I don't want
[48:14] to just be a pastor and and say well
[48:16] people demand respect there is a a
[48:18] certain amount of respect that goes with
[48:19] the office but you want the influence
[48:21] that that that that causes people to
[48:24] have respect you want to live in such a
[48:26] way that people would respect you and
[48:29] this is the age of what we call
[48:30] influencers an influencer is one who
[48:32] exerts influence a person who inspires
[48:35] or guides the actions of others and
[48:37] especially today in getting you to buy
[48:39] something right influencers are always
[48:42] trying to get you to buy something and
[48:44] we kind of got them around the message
[48:45] too but but but but in the in the in the
[48:48] world in the secular World there always
[48:50] got something they want you to buy they
[48:52] you don't even realize it you're you're
[48:54] scrolling through videos on Tik Tok I
[48:56] know of you people do that but or
[48:59] Instagram say or Facebook and you're on
[49:02] reals you're scrolling through there and
[49:04] and you say oh that's that's a that's a
[49:05] cute video you know and they make that
[49:07] video and they're doing something in
[49:08] their kitchen or something they're
[49:09] selling you
[49:11] something right they're that person just
[49:13] happens to always be at Sam's Club right
[49:16] or they're always they're always at the
[49:17] theme park they're always what are they
[49:19] doing they're influencing you and they
[49:22] always have a good time I I I yeah
[49:24] followed this person one time on on on
[49:26] social Med media that was in Branson and
[49:28] they were always uh I thought well
[49:30] they'll give a good re or you know idea
[49:32] where to go and what to do in Branson
[49:33] well the thing is she was always
[49:34] positive that's the best restaurant I've
[49:36] ever eaten at that's the best place I've
[49:38] ever been that's the most fun you can
[49:39] have in Branson it's was like well
[49:41] there's a reason for that she getting
[49:42] paid to do
[49:43] that right but they would influence that
[49:46] and the truth is if somebody tells you
[49:47] that you you begin to believe it right
[49:50] if you listen to it enough and and I
[49:52] want to challenge you tonight and I'm
[49:54] I'm trying not to make this boring but I
[49:56] feel it's on my heart so I want to get
[49:57] it across to us I want you and if you if
[50:00] you take notes I want you to write this
[50:01] down I want you to write this down and
[50:04] it'll go right under your picture right
[50:05] there that you're
[50:07] drawing who am I
[50:10] leading who am I
[50:14] leading while you're writing that down I
[50:17] I remember a man that used to take notes
[50:19] he was a preacher he sat on a platform
[50:21] and uh my father-in-law told me this
[50:23] story he said he said I always wondered
[50:25] because he was always keeping just deep
[50:26] detailed notes he just sitting there
[50:28] just just detailed notes every time
[50:30] preacher would preach and he said I one
[50:32] time he left his notebook up there and
[50:33] went up there and looked he had pictures
[50:34] of horses he was
[50:36] drawing on the platform so it's not just
[50:40] kids that do that who am I leading and
[50:43] then turn it this way who is leading
[50:47] me right and then who am I
[50:51] influencing and who is influencing
[50:54] me so who am I leading who is leading me
[50:58] who am I influencing who is influencing
[51:01] me and I think the answers might
[51:02] surprise
[51:04] us you kids if you ever see a turtle on
[51:07] a fence post what do you know about that
[51:10] Turtle right if you see a turtle on a
[51:14] fence post he did not get on the fence
[51:16] post by
[51:17] himself somebody put him up there if
[51:20] you're going to make it in life if
[51:21] you're going to do anything in life that
[51:22] goes for all of us somebody's got to put
[51:24] you on a fence post you you are a
[51:27] product of your influence you're a
[51:28] product of people that have influenced
[51:30] you and and and that have helped you and
[51:32] that have led you and so there's got to
[51:34] be now brother Brandon puts it this way
[51:35] he said somebody helped you when you
[51:38] made your first step right when you made
[51:42] your first step somebody helped you and
[51:45] your last step you ever make in life
[51:48] somebody will be leading you right so he
[51:51] said that's right I want you to remember
[51:53] that your first step somebody LED you
[51:54] and your last step somebody will be
[51:56] leading you we have to be led he said
[51:59] you know God likened us un sheep and you
[52:02] know a sheep can't lead itself he'll
[52:03] wander away and stray away and he just
[52:06] can't lead himself and he has to have
[52:09] somebody to lead him and the shepherd is
[52:12] supposed to lead the Sheep he said now
[52:14] that was back in the days of the Lord
[52:15] Jesus he was the Good Shepherd that led
[52:17] the Sheep but today you see we're living
[52:19] in another day everything is changed and
[52:21] perverted he said you know what man has
[52:22] to lead sheep today a
[52:24] goat and we were actually talking about
[52:27] this and the brothers didn't realize I
[52:29] had this in my notse we were talking
[52:30] about this during lunch they will
[52:32] actually take a goat and the Goat will
[52:35] will brother Joel's experienced it where
[52:37] he's seen the goat actually lead the
[52:39] Sheep up into the trailer to go to
[52:41] slaughter because the Sheep don't are
[52:43] not somebody said they're not curious
[52:45] and that that makes sense and they just
[52:47] they want they huddle together they'll
[52:48] just stay back but a goat will just lead
[52:50] them right up there and so brother B so
[52:52] what we have today is goats leading the
[52:54] Sheep to slaughter he said them sheep
[52:56] don't know where they're going so the
[52:58] goat goes up a pin up at the solder the
[53:00] Sheep don't know more no more than to
[53:01] follow a leader so it leads them right
[53:03] up into this Slaughter and the Goat
[53:05] jumps over the track and the sheep goes
[53:07] in gets killed see the goat a wrong
[53:10] leader but Jesus the Good Shepherd how
[53:13] many how many want to follow the Good
[53:14] Shepherd today Jesus the Good Shepherd
[53:17] who led the Sheep had he led them to
[53:20] life and held their hand he said but
[53:23] somebody has to lead the Sheep
[53:26] somebody has to lead the Sheep so
[53:29] brother brandom has a list of four
[53:30] leaders he said in the message
[53:32] leadership he said there's mother he
[53:35] said and then
[53:36] father he said and then
[53:39] teacher right so that's a big position
[53:41] isn't it you people that are teachers
[53:43] that's a big
[53:44] deal right and and many of you are
[53:46] parents that teach your children that's
[53:47] a big
[53:48] deal mother father teacher and then he
[53:52] said
[53:53] Jesus right mother father teacher Jesus
[53:56] Jesus it doesn't mean that other leaders
[53:59] cuz he said you'll be led all through
[54:00] your
[54:01] life right but this is the point he was
[54:04] trying to get to these young people
[54:05] these kids is that and and if you go
[54:08] back and study where brother Brandon was
[54:09] saying that in Prescott Arizona he's
[54:11] telling people in a caught in a bad
[54:13] situation that one day you may have to
[54:15] look beyond your current leadership and
[54:18] look to
[54:19] Christ you you may have to look to
[54:22] Christ and and and we want you to look
[54:24] to Christ because every other leadership
[54:26] can fail but he'll never fail you and
[54:29] he's the only one that can give you
[54:30] eternal life but it doesn't mean we'll
[54:33] reject other leaders or other influence
[54:35] but that we will follow leadership as
[54:38] they follow him so Paul puts it this way
[54:41] and I just want to do a little bible
[54:42] study for a minute we'll just look at it
[54:44] run through it real quickly 1
[54:45] Corinthians 4 uh 14 says I write not
[54:49] these things to shame you but as my
[54:51] beloved Sons I warn you for though you
[54:53] have 10,000 instructors in Christ yet
[54:55] have you not many fathers in Christ
[54:58] Jesus have begotten you through the
[54:59] gospel wherefore I beseech you what did
[55:01] he say be ye followers of me that's a
[55:05] pretty strong statement but it's all
[55:06] through the New Testament Paul says be
[55:09] followers of me for this cause have I
[55:12] sent unto you timotheus now for what
[55:14] cause to make you followers of Paul he
[55:17] said I'm going to send you another
[55:19] preacher right to help you follow what
[55:21] I've taught you more closely that's the
[55:24] same thing brother brandom said Faithful
[55:25] Men will go out from the messenger and
[55:27] teach others to be faithful as well for
[55:30] this cause have I sent un you timotheus
[55:32] who was my beloved Son and faithful in
[55:34] the Lord who shall bring you into
[55:36] remembrance of my ways which be in
[55:38] Christ you think well Paul you know if
[55:40] you if you just put in a vacuum and you
[55:42] don't know who Paul is you think he's
[55:44] being awful
[55:45] arrogant right but he's a messenger to
[55:47] the age he was the pattern for ages to
[55:50] come and so he's using his influence you
[55:53] see that he's using his influence he has
[55:56] messenger of the age to promote the
[55:57] leadership of Timothy yeah but he said
[56:00] follow me he said and then I'm going to
[56:01] send Timothy to you to remind you of my
[56:04] ways 1 Corinthians 11 uh he again he
[56:08] says be followers of me even as I also
[56:12] am of Christ see there's the key follow
[56:15] people who follow Christ if someone let
[56:17] me let me challenge you young people for
[56:19] a minute if someone just because someone
[56:22] in your POS in a position of leadership
[56:24] does something doesn't mean it's right
[56:25] right follow them as they follow Christ
[56:29] so you got to know the word well enough
[56:31] that you know when they get off of the
[56:33] word right follow them as they follow
[56:36] Christ it doesn't mean you question
[56:37] every decision and let me say this
[56:39] there's things that uh there's things a
[56:41] parent will deal with that it's not
[56:42] written in the word but they're just
[56:44] dealing with things and that's their
[56:46] job right to tell you to pick up your
[56:49] clothes we'll get to that in just a
[56:51] minute that's their job tell you clean
[56:52] your room right that's their job to do
[56:55] that but there things a pastor does
[56:57] that's like that that you just that that
[56:59] that you just got to take care of that's
[57:00] what they're that's what they're there
[57:02] for and I don't think we should question
[57:03] every decision like that but if they get
[57:05] off the word don't stay with them right
[57:09] and and and pray that God brings them
[57:11] back to the word right right so that's
[57:14] we have to follow Christ we must follow
[57:17] Christ he said now so be followers of me
[57:20] he said I Praise You Brethren that you
[57:21] remember me in all
[57:23] things right he said and keep ordinances
[57:26] is I delivered them to you and so when
[57:29] we talk about Brother brandham people
[57:30] don't understand that all the time see
[57:31] you're always saying brother brandham
[57:32] said brother brandham said why he was
[57:34] the Paul to this
[57:37] generation right he said follow me as I
[57:39] follow Christ and the ordinances the way
[57:42] that I set up the gifts and the way that
[57:43] I did this the way I told you to have
[57:45] church do that why because it works
[57:49] because it's the thoughts of God to Our
[57:50] Generation all right right he says I I
[57:53] would have you know that the head of
[57:55] every man is Christ now look where he's
[57:57] going with this he said follow
[57:59] me follow me but he said now here's the
[58:01] lead here's the headship the head of
[58:04] every man is Christ and the head of the
[58:05] woman is the man and the head of Christ
[58:07] is
[58:08] God now he goes on to say and you know
[58:11] what that chapter is he deals with women
[58:13] cutting their hair right and he says if
[58:16] she cuts her hair she dishonors her head
[58:18] which is her
[58:19] husband but and and and so what is he
[58:22] doing now look at the the headship it's
[58:25] head of her man is Christ the head of
[58:26] the woman is the man the head of Christ
[58:28] is God and that doesn't mean a woman who
[58:31] is a woman who's not married is not
[58:33] without
[58:34] headship see she she got to submit to
[58:36] the headship of leadership of some kind
[58:39] she needs the influence of Godly men but
[58:40] can I take that a step further a man
[58:43] needs the influence of Godly
[58:45] men right you you need the influence of
[58:47] somebody but don't take influen that's
[58:49] wrong take influence that's right you
[58:52] need influence you need friends you need
[58:54] people to lean on you need somebody but
[58:56] just take what's right don't take the
[58:58] wrong take the right you need men and
[59:00] I'm thankful I'm just trying to be a a
[59:03] pastor tonight if you can say it that
[59:05] way but I'm thankful for Godly men that
[59:06] have led in this church in the right
[59:09] direction I I'm thankful for men like
[59:11] Danny Ward I'm thankful for men just
[59:13] throw a name out there brother Danny but
[59:14] I'm thankful for men who lead I'm
[59:17] thankful for some of you who have been
[59:18] here a long time brother Bill and
[59:19] Brother David and now we got brother
[59:21] Harvey with us and different ones
[59:22] brother JT was a leader for many years
[59:24] in the church at brandville you guys I'm
[59:26] thankful for you because of your
[59:28] influence we're able to do what we do
[59:30] today but us young people we got to pick
[59:32] that up and be leaders and sometimes
[59:35] leadership looks like cleaning up
[59:41] junk at the fellowship hall but it's
[59:43] just the way it
[59:44] is right somebody's got to do it
[59:46] somebody's got to step in and be that
[59:48] guy and let me be that and you say well
[59:50] I'm not that kind of leader but you're a
[59:52] leader somewhere in some way all of us
[59:55] are yeah I'm thankful for that
[59:58] leadership and so we all need the
[1:00:00] leadership of of men if we can say it
[1:00:03] that way God put men male leadership in
[1:00:05] the church we all need the leadership of
[1:00:07] men but we can't let that supplant the
[1:00:09] leadership of
[1:00:11] Christ he's the head of the
[1:00:13] man right and the man is the head of the
[1:00:16] woman Christ is the head of the church
[1:00:19] look and so a man who thinks he's above
[1:00:22] leadership will fall 100 times out of a
[1:00:25] 100
[1:00:26] if he's got nobody to listen to he's
[1:00:29] going to
[1:00:31] fall if there's nobody that can tell him
[1:00:33] no all right there you need somebody in
[1:00:36] your life that can look at you and say
[1:00:38] that's not a good idea and you won't
[1:00:40] leave them right you won't get mad at
[1:00:43] them right somebody needs to be able to
[1:00:46] tell you that if there's nobody that can
[1:00:48] tell you that you don't have any
[1:00:50] leadership you got to have it and we all
[1:00:53] God does that for us he does that for us
[1:00:56] so a a man must lead in the right way in
[1:00:58] 1 Peter 3:7 he tells husbands I'm not
[1:01:00] preaching on husbands and wives tonight
[1:01:02] just fits in here uh husbands dwell with
[1:01:05] them according to knowledge so in other
[1:01:06] words he's telling you if you're going
[1:01:07] to lead your wife lead her with
[1:01:11] knowledge with knowledge what does that
[1:01:13] mean giving honor unto the wife as unto
[1:01:15] the weaker vessel as being HS together
[1:01:17] the grace of life that your prayers be
[1:01:19] not hindered so he's saying be smart
[1:01:21] about it think about
[1:01:23] it huh think about it it lead your home
[1:01:28] by the influence of your
[1:01:30] life see and and I talk to us men for a
[1:01:33] minute if we don't put any thought into
[1:01:36] our marriage relationship our prayers
[1:01:38] will be
[1:01:40] ineffective you got to put thought into
[1:01:42] that you got to in other words you got
[1:01:44] to do that
[1:01:46] purposefully the Bible says a wife
[1:01:48] should reverence her husband how many
[1:01:49] believe that what the Bible says but
[1:01:52] that means he has to influence her in
[1:01:54] that way right right brother brandom
[1:01:56] says this a husband ought to live such a
[1:01:58] life before his wife that his wife could
[1:01:59] reverence him as a Son of God yes and if
[1:02:02] he doesn't live that kind of life well
[1:02:03] then of course she wouldn't reverence
[1:02:05] him now that doesn't excuse her but it
[1:02:06] does give us a reason yeah right why she
[1:02:09] wouldn't reverence him because she knows
[1:02:10] what he's made of when is a man that is
[1:02:13] reverent man that's the kind of man I
[1:02:15] want to be I want to be a reverent man I
[1:02:17] want to be a man who lives his life with
[1:02:19] reverence not not blows off the uh steam
[1:02:21] all the time and gets mad and and and uh
[1:02:25] loses my my temper all the time and
[1:02:27] people are scared to bring something up
[1:02:28] I don't want to be that I want to be a
[1:02:29] reverent man I don't want to be a man
[1:02:32] that's involved in every little thing in
[1:02:33] the world let me be a reverent man who
[1:02:35] doesn't try to hide and be somebody
[1:02:37] different home than I am at church let
[1:02:39] me be a reverent man how many men can
[1:02:41] say Amen to that tonight Reverend and
[1:02:43] clean with his wife and before his
[1:02:45] family a real servant of God he said
[1:02:48] then the women children and all should
[1:02:49] respect that servant of God with
[1:02:52] reverence Paul again says Brethren be
[1:02:55] followers
[1:02:56] together of
[1:02:58] me that's pretty Stark isn't it Mark
[1:03:02] them which walk so as again Watch what
[1:03:04] he says he said so so make a a
[1:03:08] distinction mark them which walk so as
[1:03:10] you have us for an example so in other
[1:03:12] words we set the example if you see
[1:03:14] people doing things like we did them
[1:03:16] look at that person and say hey there's
[1:03:18] a follower of Paul and follow that man
[1:03:21] he said for many walk of whom I've have
[1:03:23] told you often and I'll tell you even
[1:03:24] weeping that they're the enemies of the
[1:03:26] Cross of Christ just because they say
[1:03:27] they believe the message don't make them
[1:03:29] a good
[1:03:29] leader don't make them a good
[1:03:32] influence who's end is destruction whose
[1:03:35] God is their belly whose glory is their
[1:03:36] shame who God is their belly what that
[1:03:38] means is they just want what's good for
[1:03:40] them they they just want to Feast on the
[1:03:43] good on on the money they just want to
[1:03:44] Feast on uh who's God is their belly
[1:03:47] doesn't mean they're fat brother
[1:03:50] jooli the bellies worth the desire can I
[1:03:52] have to explain everything to you are
[1:03:55] yall with me
[1:03:58] tonight so whose God is just means their
[1:04:00] desires their desire just follow every
[1:04:03] whim whose glory is in their shame who
[1:04:05] mind Earthly things Paul was the pattern
[1:04:08] for us he led by influence listen what
[1:04:12] brother BR said about him he said his
[1:04:13] manner of ministering set the pattern
[1:04:15] all someone say all future Messengers
[1:04:18] were to Aspire to and actually sets the
[1:04:21] patter pattern for every true minister
[1:04:24] of God he would not attain to such
[1:04:26] Heights in the prophetic realm as did
[1:04:28] Paul he said Paul's Ministry had a
[1:04:30] three-fold quality and I'll just run
[1:04:31] through those there's more to this quote
[1:04:33] if you want to go read it yourself but
[1:04:35] this is what he said those three
[1:04:36] qualities were first of all Paul was
[1:04:38] absolutely true to the word he never
[1:04:41] deviated from it no matter what the
[1:04:43] cost again he said secondly his ministry
[1:04:46] was in the power of the spirit thereby
[1:04:49] demonstrating the spoken and written
[1:04:50] word thirdly he had the evident fruit of
[1:04:53] his god-given ministry so someone says
[1:04:54] well I have a Ministry but there's no
[1:04:56] fruit of it that's a problem right the
[1:04:59] ministry will produce fruit and it's not
[1:05:01] that it's not that I would have fruit or
[1:05:02] brother Joel would have fruit but if
[1:05:04] we're faithful to our post of Duty God
[1:05:06] will produce fruit right that Ministry
[1:05:10] so brother brandom is is dealing with
[1:05:12] his church on Church order and are
[1:05:14] youall still with me
[1:05:15] tonight I'm getting through this pretty
[1:05:17] quick but he's dealing with his church
[1:05:19] on Church order he said forgive me if I
[1:05:20] try to take the place of a boss I'm no
[1:05:23] boss but I feel to you like Paul said
[1:05:25] back about his congregation you're the
[1:05:27] stars in my crown when I cross over the
[1:05:29] land over on the other side Yonder and
[1:05:31] meet you in that glorified condition I
[1:05:32] want you to stand there to shine like
[1:05:34] the stars in my crown I want you to be
[1:05:36] there he said I want to be there and I
[1:05:38] remember he said in my vision when I
[1:05:40] seen the presence of the Lord or his
[1:05:41] people in that glorious land Yonder I
[1:05:43] looked around and I told them and they
[1:05:44] told me he would judge me first by the
[1:05:46] gospel that I preach I said just exactly
[1:05:48] the way Paul preached and then millions
[1:05:51] of people screamed out we're resting on
[1:05:53] that how many are we still resting on
[1:05:54] that tonight sir he saw us there we're
[1:05:57] resting on that he said no I want it to
[1:05:59] be so and we're going to meet there
[1:06:02] someday and God never sent brother
[1:06:04] Neville and I to be bosses not at all
[1:06:06] we're just your brothers instructors in
[1:06:09] the gospel so let's all work together
[1:06:12] I've had people ask me say brother Ben
[1:06:13] what kind you know would you would you
[1:06:15] be able to tell me what kind of car I
[1:06:17] ought to buy or what kind of house I
[1:06:18] sure I'll tell you but it may not be
[1:06:22] right I like Fords I've had terrible
[1:06:24] luck with Fords
[1:06:26] you know I like Fords but my car is
[1:06:28] always in the shop I may not be the best
[1:06:30] person to
[1:06:33] ask it's been in the shop for months and
[1:06:35] we just got it back out we hit a deer it
[1:06:37] took us two months to get it back but
[1:06:40] but see I I'm not always a a good judge
[1:06:42] of those things but what do I deal with
[1:06:44] I deal with the word that's what I deal
[1:06:47] with you want a question about that and
[1:06:48] now I can have a little more
[1:06:50] Authority right a little more Authority
[1:06:52] because that but where do my authority
[1:06:54] come from from the message of the age
[1:06:55] from my headship because as a local
[1:06:58] Pastor I'm under one Messenger to the
[1:07:00] age I'm not under any other pastor but
[1:07:02] I'm under a Messer and he was under
[1:07:05] Christ right and I have confidence in
[1:07:07] the messenger and I've Got Confidence in
[1:07:09] Christ the word and I've Got Confidence
[1:07:11] in the Bible I've Got Confidence in
[1:07:13] pastors today I believe God called them
[1:07:15] for a reason right and that's leadership
[1:07:18] that's what God calls but Lord help us
[1:07:20] to have the right kind of influence with
[1:07:21] our
[1:07:23] leadership God didn't send us to be boss
[1:07:25] but to be instructors he say so let's
[1:07:28] all work together what kind of people
[1:07:30] should have influence in leadership in
[1:07:31] our lives think about this because I ask
[1:07:34] you who who do I lead who leads me who
[1:07:38] do I influence who influences me well
[1:07:41] the first place God's gifts should have
[1:07:43] a position of leadership in our lives
[1:07:45] they are gifts to us Ephesians 4:11 he
[1:07:48] gave some Apostles and some prophets and
[1:07:50] some evangelists and some pastors and
[1:07:52] teachers he gave those are predestined
[1:07:54] foraine gifts
[1:07:56] that God placed in the church and God
[1:07:59] put them there and then you say well I
[1:08:00] don't have confidence in the gift that
[1:08:02] that's in my church when you ought to go
[1:08:04] somewhere we have confidence in them
[1:08:05] yeah right right and I'm not saying that
[1:08:08] to be mean it's just the truth you've
[1:08:09] got to have confidence in the gift that
[1:08:11] realizing they're human and sometimes
[1:08:13] they'll say what bird's eye is and it's
[1:08:15] the wrong thing or something like
[1:08:18] that sometimes they don't know what
[1:08:19] they're talking about but but but but
[1:08:21] they stay they try to stay with the word
[1:08:24] right they're human beings but they try
[1:08:25] to stay with the word that's a gift
[1:08:28] right and we believe in God's gifts we
[1:08:30] still believe in the five-fold ministry
[1:08:32] here right as long as I'm here I'm going
[1:08:34] to try to preach Paul says as long as
[1:08:36] I'm in this body I'm declare to you the
[1:08:38] word of the Lord that's the pattern that
[1:08:40] we have so he gave some Apostles some
[1:08:43] prophets some evangelists pastors
[1:08:44] teachers for for the perfecting of the
[1:08:46] Saints for the maturity of the Saints
[1:08:49] for the work of the ministry for the
[1:08:50] edifying of the body of Christ until we
[1:08:53] all come in the unity of the faith and
[1:08:55] of the knowledge of the Son of God to a
[1:08:57] perfect man to the measure of the
[1:08:58] stature of the fullness of Christ that
[1:09:00] we henceforth be no more children tossed
[1:09:03] to and fro and carried about with every
[1:09:05] wind of Doctrine by the slide of men and
[1:09:07] cunning craftiness where by the
[1:09:09] lineweight deceived that's why we need
[1:09:11] leadership because there's winds
[1:09:13] blowing right and we weren't meant to
[1:09:16] respond to all that by
[1:09:18] ourselves God give us
[1:09:21] leadership right that's why sometimes
[1:09:23] leader will say something what is he
[1:09:24] preaching about that for well there's
[1:09:25] the wind blowing maybe you don't know
[1:09:28] about it but it's
[1:09:29] there right and so he's responding to
[1:09:32] that maybe he don't even know about it
[1:09:34] but it's the
[1:09:35] gift right but now look but but he said
[1:09:39] speaking the truth in love that's the
[1:09:40] key and grow up into him in all things
[1:09:43] which is the head even Christ from whom
[1:09:45] the whole body fitly joined together and
[1:09:48] compacted by that which every joint
[1:09:50] suppli every joint that's all of us he
[1:09:52] said according to the effectual working
[1:09:54] in the measure of every part maketh
[1:09:57] increase of the body unto the edifying
[1:09:59] of itself in love brother BR says now
[1:10:02] God fortified his army what with himself
[1:10:04] in the form of prophets Apostles
[1:10:06] teachers pastors he protects
[1:10:10] himself with the
[1:10:13] ministry right he said what was God
[1:10:15] doing listen did you ever think what the
[1:10:16] offices of the church is it's God's
[1:10:18] dress inside dress an apostle a prophet
[1:10:20] a seir foreseeing it before Satan ever
[1:10:23] gets to it done told it what is it God
[1:10:26] dressed up in his church these offices
[1:10:27] is God's dress wear when you see those
[1:10:29] offices pastors teachers evangelist what
[1:10:31] is that that's God's dress wear God's
[1:10:33] presence God's spirit working through
[1:10:34] man he said but now watch where he takes
[1:10:37] this because leadership can only take
[1:10:39] you so far you need to know the word and
[1:10:42] not just have a head knowledge of the
[1:10:43] word you need to you need to have the
[1:10:45] word in your heart the Holy Ghost living
[1:10:47] in you because he said if that office
[1:10:49] denies any of this word it's not God's
[1:10:51] dressing right I don't mean that they'll
[1:10:53] be they'll know everything
[1:10:55] yes but it means they don't deny the
[1:10:58] word right he said he said no he said
[1:11:01] that's a wolf and sheep's clothing watch
[1:11:03] that fellow beware of him when he just
[1:11:06] takes what the word says remember that's
[1:11:08] God because he's speaking his word if he
[1:11:11] says well it isn't oh he said oh oh my
[1:11:14] get going sheep yeah all right get going
[1:11:19] we got to have confidence what we're
[1:11:20] being fed or we might you know there's
[1:11:22] no point in
[1:11:24] it and and and I want to address this
[1:11:26] and and we'll move on but and I want you
[1:11:28] young people to understand you're not
[1:11:29] bound to a pastor for
[1:11:31] life because if if I'm the only one that
[1:11:33] represents Christ to you I believe your
[1:11:36] parents should represent that I believe
[1:11:38] the elders in the church should
[1:11:39] represent that because God may call me
[1:11:41] off the scene then what do you
[1:11:43] do right I'm here for a season all of us
[1:11:47] are because if I get to be the age of
[1:11:49] 105 I probably won't be here whether the
[1:11:52] Rapture happened or not
[1:11:55] right I mean that's that's just the
[1:11:56] truth I'm looking for a body change but
[1:11:59] if I live that long I probably won't be
[1:12:00] here I'm here for a
[1:12:02] season and and so you got to have
[1:12:05] confidence in the word that he'll give
[1:12:06] you good leadership you're not bound to
[1:12:08] a pastor for life I'm not your husband
[1:12:10] yeah Christ
[1:12:12] is your Christ is your husband we ought
[1:12:15] to believe that church you don't divorce
[1:12:17] you know by leaving me you don't divorce
[1:12:19] Christ right we don't have to get a
[1:12:21] divorce for you to go some some other
[1:12:24] church right
[1:12:26] don't don't brother BR said don't put
[1:12:27] your confidence in a man right he said
[1:12:29] when that man leaves the word of God you
[1:12:31] leave the man right he you leave the man
[1:12:33] stay with God God is the word yeah God
[1:12:36] is the word you say brother Ben why
[1:12:37] would you say that don't don't that make
[1:12:38] you nervous say that no because I
[1:12:39] believe I stay with the word with all of
[1:12:41] my heart and if I was a charlatan if I
[1:12:44] was a wolf if I was preaching false
[1:12:46] Doctrine I'd want people to
[1:12:48] leave right because I I want to be open
[1:12:51] and honest about that God I don't want
[1:12:53] to be a a nickol brother brand called a
[1:12:55] nickan someone who conquers the Le
[1:12:58] that's the Greek word to conquer the Le
[1:13:01] nicolan and but but yet we have to use
[1:13:04] Authority yes right God uses Authority
[1:13:08] but it doesn't mean he's a nickol Anon
[1:13:10] he uses headship but it doesn't mean
[1:13:12] he's a nickol niolon is to conquer the
[1:13:14] Ley Le have no voice and Le have no
[1:13:17] worship and the Le have no ability uh
[1:13:20] you know to to do anything unless the
[1:13:22] man tells them what to do but that's not
[1:13:24] who we we are at all we're the word
[1:13:26] bride of Jesus Christ sir we're each one
[1:13:29] supposed to represent the word yes uh
[1:13:31] but in mark 1:22 it tells us that that
[1:13:34] they were astonished at Jesus Doctrine
[1:13:36] because he preached like he taught like
[1:13:37] one that had Authority he didn't say it
[1:13:40] like it well it could be this way and it
[1:13:41] could be that way he spoke as one with
[1:13:43] authority in 1 Peter 4:11 Peter says if
[1:13:46] any man speak let him speak as the
[1:13:47] Oracles of God means that an oracle was
[1:13:50] something that uh in in idolatry it was
[1:13:53] something that the idol would speak
[1:13:54] through that that image he said so if
[1:13:57] any man speak let him speak as if it's
[1:13:59] God speaking through his flesh let him
[1:14:01] speak as if it's God's word yes if any
[1:14:04] man Minister let him do it as the
[1:14:05] ability to whom which God giveth listen
[1:14:08] and I'm hurrying through this so we
[1:14:10] don't uh but some of it I think we ought
[1:14:13] to dwell on a little bit but I'm
[1:14:14] hurrying through it so we don't get
[1:14:15] bored this afternoon or get tired but he
[1:14:17] said he's placed his church in the care
[1:14:19] of God ordained Spirit-filled word
[1:14:22] living men let me be one of those men
[1:14:24] may each one of us I think as as
[1:14:26] husbands as Fathers as leadership we
[1:14:28] ought to say that let me be a word
[1:14:30] living man who lead the people through
[1:14:33] feeding them the word that's how we lead
[1:14:36] yes he has not separated the people into
[1:14:38] classes so the masss are led by a holy
[1:14:40] priesthood it is true the leadership
[1:14:42] must be holy but then so must be the
[1:14:44] whole congregation there's no place in
[1:14:46] the word where preach or ministers or
[1:14:47] such mediate between God and the people
[1:14:49] or is there a place where they're
[1:14:50] separated and the worship with the Lord
[1:14:52] God wants all to love and serve him
[1:14:54] together together do you want to serve
[1:14:56] him together and love him with all of
[1:14:58] your heart you don't have to come
[1:15:00] through me to pray right right I want
[1:15:03] you to ask me ask for prayer because
[1:15:04] that makes me feel good makes me feel
[1:15:06] like you got confidence in me but I'm
[1:15:08] not the mediator between you and God
[1:15:10] there's one man there's one mediator
[1:15:12] between God and man the man Christ Jesus
[1:15:15] and that's it but there is a pastor
[1:15:18] somewhere who'll feed and Shepherd you I
[1:15:20] want to be that kind of Pastor but
[1:15:22] there's one for you if you're a child of
[1:15:24] God and I believe you are all of you
[1:15:25] with all my heart listen Peter exhorted
[1:15:29] the elders in 1 Peter 5 1-3 he says I
[1:15:33] exhort you as an elder feed the flock of
[1:15:35] God which is among you taking the
[1:15:36] oversight thereof not by constraint but
[1:15:38] willingly and and and that that you can
[1:15:40] take that two ways you say don't don't
[1:15:43] constrain them to follow you but it also
[1:15:45] quite literally means don't have you
[1:15:47] don't have to be constrained to do it no
[1:15:50] one's forcing you to
[1:15:51] preach not for filthy lucer in other
[1:15:53] words not for money but of a ready mind
[1:15:56] yes not being Lords over God's Heritage
[1:15:59] but being examples to the flock yes
[1:16:02] being
[1:16:03] examples who should lead and have
[1:16:05] influence your parents should lead and
[1:16:07] have influence how many young people how
[1:16:08] many kids up here on the front can say I
[1:16:10] believe my parents should have influence
[1:16:12] on
[1:16:13] me some of
[1:16:15] you you can raise your hand be proud
[1:16:18] it's all
[1:16:19] right some of them like you don't know
[1:16:21] my parents you
[1:16:27] parents should have influence Proverbs
[1:16:28] 23:22 hearken unto thy father that begat
[1:16:32] thee despise not thy mother when she is
[1:16:38] old
[1:16:41] Mom Mom's like
[1:16:43] amen I don't know whether that's her
[1:16:45] calling herself old or or me needing to
[1:16:47] be more respectful to my
[1:16:50] mother Proverbs 13:1 a wise son hears
[1:16:53] his father's inst instruction but a
[1:16:56] scorner heareth not rebuke all right
[1:16:58] yeah Ephesians 61 children obey your
[1:17:01] parents in the Lord for this is
[1:17:05] right this is right when does that
[1:17:07] obligation end
[1:17:09] well you know I'll say this the world
[1:17:12] sets the age of 18 but God never set
[1:17:14] that
[1:17:17] age I'll say this I told my kids long as
[1:17:20] I'm long as I'm paying your light
[1:17:22] bill looks like that may be a while yet
[1:17:28] providing you
[1:17:31] Wheels you obey your parents but an
[1:17:34] influence like again that's not a
[1:17:36] demanded thing you can only demand that
[1:17:39] for so
[1:17:40] long and they'll leave yeah but if you
[1:17:44] influence them in such a way that they
[1:17:45] say Dad I need your I need your help
[1:17:47] with this that's what I want I want my
[1:17:49] kids to be able to come to me because I
[1:17:51] want to have influence not just
[1:17:53] leadership not just control not because
[1:17:55] not just a position but influence of my
[1:17:59] children he said honor your father and
[1:18:01] mother which is the first commandment
[1:18:02] with promise may be well with you now
[1:18:04] may us live long on the earth do you you
[1:18:06] want to live you kids want to live as
[1:18:07] long as brother Bill yes huh you want to
[1:18:12] live as long as brother Bill Curtis and
[1:18:13] sister Karen honor your father and
[1:18:15] mother they must have really treated
[1:18:17] their parents
[1:18:20] well that's what it says if you honor
[1:18:23] your father and mother you'll live a
[1:18:25] long life that's a pretty good pretty
[1:18:27] good deal I
[1:18:29] think but we'll influence our children I
[1:18:32] want to talk to you parents just to say
[1:18:34] this we want to be the right kind of
[1:18:36] influence we we want to be a mother like
[1:18:38] Timothy's mother if you're a mother you
[1:18:40] want to be a mother like Timothy's
[1:18:42] mother not like
[1:18:43] herodias who give her baggage to her
[1:18:46] children right right but but like
[1:18:48] Timothy's mother who taught her children
[1:18:50] the Bible yes to have confidence in it
[1:18:52] right and so Timothy could follow Paul
[1:18:54] because his mother taught him to have
[1:18:56] confidence in the
[1:18:57] scriptures right and and so we ought to
[1:19:00] be able we should influence our children
[1:19:02] to have confidence in the men of God and
[1:19:04] to have confidence in people of God we
[1:19:07] should influence them in that way Elders
[1:19:09] should have influence the Bible says
[1:19:11] Thou shalt rise up before the Hy head
[1:19:13] what that means is you should stand up
[1:19:15] before the gray-headed
[1:19:17] person that's what that means I sh rise
[1:19:20] up in other words be respectful to those
[1:19:23] who've lived a few years
[1:19:25] y huh honor the face of the old man and
[1:19:29] fear thy God I am the Lord Proverbs
[1:19:32] 16:31 the Hy head or the gry head is a
[1:19:34] Crown of Glory if it be found in the way
[1:19:38] of righteousness yes because old folks
[1:19:40] aren't always right now they do always
[1:19:43] deserve our
[1:19:45] respect they're not always right and job
[1:19:49] 32:7 job uh this is uh elu I believe it
[1:19:53] was that was speaking here cuz he waited
[1:19:54] till job's comforters got done speaking
[1:19:56] all their stuff and he said I said days
[1:19:59] should speak multitude of years should
[1:20:01] teach wisdom but there is a spirit in
[1:20:03] man and the inspiration of the almighty
[1:20:05] gives them understanding old people are
[1:20:06] not always right but they always deserve
[1:20:10] respect I'm coming down to a
[1:20:13] close brother Bram used the example of
[1:20:15] the Rich Young Ruler whose parents
[1:20:16] taught him to make money and be moral
[1:20:19] but not to follow
[1:20:20] Jesus and he refused the ultimate
[1:20:22] leadership of the word influence of the
[1:20:25] word wasn't strong enough to overcome
[1:20:27] his desire for money and things Uzziah
[1:20:30] the example he gives there of influence
[1:20:31] was a little different he was taught
[1:20:33] correctly by Godly Parents he was a
[1:20:36] friend of prophets a mentor of the young
[1:20:38] prophet Isaiah but he tried to use
[1:20:41] influence to change his position of
[1:20:44] leadership yes he had a great position
[1:20:47] of leadership but he tried to take the
[1:20:49] influence he had in that position and
[1:20:51] make him something that he
[1:20:53] wasn't right right you know you can't
[1:20:56] make yourself something that you're not
[1:20:58] right right we don't we you can't if
[1:21:00] you're a mother and you got a great
[1:21:02] position of influence but you'll never
[1:21:03] be a
[1:21:04] preacher right and this age tries to mix
[1:21:07] that and we can't do that we need to
[1:21:09] stay in our lane we need to stay where
[1:21:10] God called us to be see Uzziah was a
[1:21:14] military genius a financial success a
[1:21:17] good administrator he wanted to be a
[1:21:19] preacher yeah he had great influence but
[1:21:22] he got to a place where he could not be
[1:21:24] led
[1:21:26] the Bible says he did that which was
[1:21:27] right in the sight of the Lord according
[1:21:28] to all that his father amiah did he
[1:21:30] sought God excuse me in the days of
[1:21:34] Zachariah understanding the visions of
[1:21:36] God he was a friend of multiple Major
[1:21:39] Prophets and as long as he sought the
[1:21:42] Lord God made him to
[1:21:45] prosper and and then go down to verse 15
[1:21:48] said he made him Jerusalem engines
[1:21:49] invented by cunning men to be on the
[1:21:51] towers upon the bworks to shoot arrows
[1:21:53] and great stones with all and his name
[1:21:55] spread far abroad and he was marvelously
[1:21:57] helped till he was strong but when he
[1:21:59] was strong oh church we want to be
[1:22:02] strong but we we don't want to think
[1:22:04] like that when he was strong his heart
[1:22:07] was lifted up to his Destruction for he
[1:22:10] transgressed against the Lord his God
[1:22:12] and went into the Temple of the Lord to
[1:22:14] burn incense upon the altar of incense
[1:22:16] and Azariah the priest went in after him
[1:22:19] and with him four score Priests of the
[1:22:20] Lord that were Valiant men and they with
[1:22:23] stod Uzziah the king and said unto him
[1:22:25] it appertaineth not unto thee Uzziah to
[1:22:27] burn incense unto the Lord they said
[1:22:29] this is not your
[1:22:30] place I say they were good men yes right
[1:22:33] who are doing their job to keep
[1:22:36] businessmen out of the pulpit yes all
[1:22:38] right right to keep people from from
[1:22:40] doing that listen we don't have to do
[1:22:42] that why would you want to
[1:22:45] to brother Joel told me earlier he said
[1:22:49] why can't I just run
[1:22:53] sound you know sometimes you people
[1:22:55] think they want a position but it's not
[1:22:57] all it's cracked up to
[1:22:59] be there's a lot of hardship there a lot
[1:23:02] of struggle there why would we want to
[1:23:04] go out of our our position and be
[1:23:06] something God has not called us to be we
[1:23:08] don't need to correct anybody else if
[1:23:10] God's not called us to do that let's
[1:23:11] just be what we are but God called these
[1:23:14] priests to correct a king but he
[1:23:16] wouldn't listen to it because he had too
[1:23:17] much
[1:23:18] influence too
[1:23:21] much so what does he do he he goes in
[1:23:24] and he gets
[1:23:26] angry he says then Uzziah was wroth and
[1:23:28] he had a sensor in his hand to burn
[1:23:30] incense and while he was wroth with the
[1:23:32] priest leprosy rose up in his forehead
[1:23:35] before the priest in the house of the
[1:23:36] Lord from beside the incence altar you
[1:23:38] talk about going down different than you
[1:23:39] come
[1:23:42] up he he he went out of that Temple a
[1:23:44] lot different with a lot different
[1:23:46] attitude than he came in but he never
[1:23:49] recovered he tried to take a place
[1:23:51] didn't belong to
[1:23:52] him I Lord I just want to be be where
[1:23:54] you called me to be I'm afraid of trying
[1:23:57] to be something that I'm
[1:23:59] not while he was angry with the people
[1:24:01] who trying to save him from himself he
[1:24:04] got leprosy leadership matters yes
[1:24:06] influence matters yes come a time when
[1:24:09] the Rich Young Ruler wish she'd followed
[1:24:11] Jesus and accepted the leadership of the
[1:24:12] word but he lifted up his eyes in hell
[1:24:14] and saw Lazarus in Abraham's bosom yeah
[1:24:18] what brother brandom said right but and
[1:24:21] in Uzziah you find him how he spent the
[1:24:23] rest of his life Life as a leper year
[1:24:25] after year unable to help his people
[1:24:27] unable to sit on his throne but brother
[1:24:29] bam used the example of Moses he said
[1:24:31] Moses chose to follow Christ yes he
[1:24:35] chose to give up everything to follow
[1:24:37] Christ and what did he do because he
[1:24:39] accepted the leadership of Christ he was
[1:24:41] picked up by Angels when he
[1:24:43] died amen it was a huge blow to Isaiah
[1:24:48] the young Prophet when Uzziah died
[1:24:50] because Uzziah had such tremendous
[1:24:52] influence
[1:24:54] Isaiah 61 says in the year that King
[1:24:57] Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting
[1:25:01] upon a throne high and lifted up and his
[1:25:04] train filled the temple Uzziah may have
[1:25:07] been banned from his Earthly throne but
[1:25:09] Jehovah was still on the throne of
[1:25:12] heaven and I want to tell you leadership
[1:25:13] May Fail but God don't fail and Isaiah
[1:25:17] realized this influence has SP in my
[1:25:19] life of a king he was a Godly King but
[1:25:21] he went wrong but but because he went
[1:25:23] wrong don't mean God went wrong right
[1:25:27] God's still for me yes amen yes God
[1:25:31] still loves me he's still on his throne
[1:25:34] he can still take care of me do you
[1:25:35] believe that tonight he can still meet
[1:25:37] my
[1:25:38] need why Isaiah submitted himself to the
[1:25:41] kingship of Jehovah he said Lord here I
[1:25:43] am send me influence was from heaven let
[1:25:47] me read this then we close brother BR
[1:25:49] said when you're playing a ball game as
[1:25:51] it's football season I was listen to the
[1:25:54] guys yesterday talk about football I
[1:25:56] thought yeah it's about that time of
[1:25:58] year as it's football season brother B
[1:26:01] said the thing we want to do is not
[1:26:04] everybody trying to take the ball away
[1:26:05] from the man that's got it yeah he's
[1:26:09] trying to guard that man protect him let
[1:26:12] him get through we're trying to make a
[1:26:15] goal I like way he said that brother BR
[1:26:17] we're trying to make a goal a
[1:26:19] touchdown we're trying to score a goal
[1:26:22] we're trying to make a touchdown could
[1:26:24] you imagine a team he had so untrained
[1:26:26] as to find one man their own man with
[1:26:29] the ball running to the field goal and
[1:26:32] then instead of trying to knock the he's
[1:26:33] running to the field goal and then
[1:26:35] instead of trying to knock the enemy
[1:26:37] away from him the opposing team he said
[1:26:40] to let your own man that's got the ball
[1:26:42] take off with it he said every man
[1:26:44] trying to take the ball out of his hand
[1:26:46] well you're bound to lose you imagine a
[1:26:49] football team I mean you're all standing
[1:26:51] up there and you guys you play football
[1:26:52] don't you started playing football can
[1:26:54] you imagine if you all lined up and them
[1:26:56] guys are looking at you them big old 300
[1:26:57] lb linemen you know and they're like
[1:26:59] this and soon as that ball snapped here
[1:27:02] they
[1:27:03] go so what are you tackling me for well
[1:27:07] I wanted the
[1:27:08] ball you always get the ball well that's
[1:27:11] cuz you can't
[1:27:15] run when you're built like me you don't
[1:27:17] run with the ball you you you block for
[1:27:19] the
[1:27:21] runner right come on we're not all built
[1:27:25] the same
[1:27:26] spiritually and most of us are blockers
[1:27:29] there's 11 guys I think is that right 11
[1:27:31] guys on a football team on one side
[1:27:33] there's 11 guys out there but Gabe is
[1:27:35] that right 11 guys on the football team
[1:27:37] Gabe teaches football coaches football
[1:27:39] sometimes and there's 11 guys on a
[1:27:41] football team and them guys none of them
[1:27:43] but one of them has the ball and he
[1:27:46] might throw it to one other one and then
[1:27:48] what happens if he throws it to one
[1:27:49] other one especially if he makes the
[1:27:50] interception then he becomes a
[1:27:52] blocker right and some times
[1:27:55] interceptions they they' saved
[1:27:56] touchdowns because the quarterback
[1:27:57] tackled
[1:27:58] somebody right because we're all on the
[1:28:00] same
[1:28:02] team oh Church look what team are we on
[1:28:07] he said he said he said you're bound to
[1:28:09] lose today we have the same thing when
[1:28:10] we see God come on the scene going to
[1:28:11] bless a certain thing let's keep all the
[1:28:13] enemies away from it let's use our
[1:28:17] influences our influences we all have an
[1:28:20] influence let me tell you when you get a
[1:28:22] 300 lb defensive tackle in your face
[1:28:24] that's an
[1:28:26] influence right that's an influence he's
[1:28:30] influencing the game he said let's use
[1:28:32] our influence as a tackle all right
[1:28:37] yes oh Church sir not Runners
[1:28:42] tackles could I could I could I be
[1:28:44] honest with you I feel like my position
[1:28:46] is not carrying the ball in this age
[1:28:47] it's a
[1:28:48] tackle right because we had a prophet
[1:28:50] who came and brought us a message and my
[1:28:53] position is to tackle for him tackle for
[1:28:56] the message let me let me be the very
[1:28:58] best I can be let me spend all the time
[1:29:00] in the waight room I can spend let me do
[1:29:02] the very best I can do to make sure that
[1:29:06] I'm blocking for the
[1:29:10] message and he said tackles let her
[1:29:12] let's use our influence as tackles not
[1:29:15] Runners tackles that protects the runner
[1:29:17] let's impact the ball through because
[1:29:19] there's no opposition all he has to do
[1:29:20] is just keep running why is there no
[1:29:22] opposition because we've taken
[1:29:24] opposition out of the way I think
[1:29:26] whoever's in this Pulpit everybody else
[1:29:28] here is a tackle right right whoever
[1:29:30] don't matter if it's me or brother Joel
[1:29:32] or somebody else when I'm sitting there
[1:29:33] I'm a tackle right it's not my job to
[1:29:35] carry the ball that night but it's my
[1:29:37] job to say Amen brother get that devil
[1:29:39] out of the way let me be a tackle let me
[1:29:42] be somebody who moves people moves
[1:29:45] Spirits aside for the for the work of
[1:29:47] the
[1:29:48] Lord we're all on the same
[1:29:51] team let's not attack one another let's
[1:29:54] tackle the
[1:29:56] devil so let's use our influence as
[1:29:58] tackles not Runners tackles that
[1:30:00] protects the runner let's impact the
[1:30:02] ball through because there's no
[1:30:03] opposition all he has to do is just keep
[1:30:04] running we should be tackles he talked
[1:30:06] about the Full Gospel businessmen how
[1:30:07] they put businessmen in the Pulpit he
[1:30:09] said those businessmen are trying to
[1:30:10] preach the gospel he's out of his place
[1:30:13] we preachers have a hard enough time to
[1:30:14] keep it level use every little influence
[1:30:16] they can find every little technique
[1:30:18] this way and that way keep it so
[1:30:19] scrupled up you don't know what to do we
[1:30:21] don't run the church like a network
[1:30:23] marketing
[1:30:24] program we don't run it like a
[1:30:27] business why and that don't mean we
[1:30:29] can't apply business techniques in the
[1:30:32] sense of we we want to make sure we keep
[1:30:33] money in the bank we want to keep sure
[1:30:35] we make sure we do those things but but
[1:30:37] we don't run it we don't think like
[1:30:39] businessmen because many times you said
[1:30:41] in a church a little church can have a
[1:30:42] revival going on someone don't want to
[1:30:43] go out there and lead a prayer meeting
[1:30:45] you said and then you got a different
[1:30:46] idea from what really the Bible says but
[1:30:48] he believes it this way anyhow he'll
[1:30:50] star to influence and draw others away
[1:30:52] from it think to do how many want to
[1:30:55] know what to do I'm closing the thing to
[1:30:57] do is protect this
[1:31:01] message let's protect we given our lives
[1:31:03] to it brother Bruce you talking about
[1:31:06] being in the meeting there all the year
[1:31:07] we given our lives to it might as well
[1:31:08] protect it yes might as well block for
[1:31:11] it brother JT how many years we spend
[1:31:15] just just just just working working
[1:31:17] working working what for this
[1:31:20] message might as well might as well
[1:31:22] block for it huh might as well block for
[1:31:25] it oh my protect the message how do you
[1:31:29] protect it by living a Godly life by
[1:31:32] going to church by supporting the
[1:31:34] ministry by by by by making your life
[1:31:37] where there's no mark on it by living
[1:31:39] above sin by doing the things you can do
[1:31:41] you think well I failed well do it
[1:31:42] better
[1:31:43] tomorrow I don't mean you're out of the
[1:31:45] game and just you might you might have
[1:31:46] missed a tackle but tackle the next
[1:31:49] one you don't want to lay down imagine
[1:31:51] if you missed a tackle and just laid
[1:31:52] down the rest of the game
[1:31:55] you want to do
[1:31:56] that keep
[1:31:59] tackling you say well I don't do
[1:32:01] anything in the church you're still a
[1:32:02] part of the
[1:32:04] team you ever you ever seen a fullback
[1:32:06] run the ball very few
[1:32:09] times said why does the that's a good
[1:32:11] question why does the halfback run the
[1:32:13] ball not the fullback don't make any

[1:32:22] is he he's in a position to block and
[1:32:24] he's willing to do whatever it takes to
[1:32:26] make the team
[1:32:30] win he says the thing to do is protect
