I wonder if we could just stand together. Let's uh can we try that hallelujah side real quick? I've got it in there, Brother Robert, I believe, on the schedule. I love this one right here. Let's just try it. I haven't done it in a while, and I probably messed it up, but I like the words to it. Oh, once a sinner far from Jesus, I was perishing with cold. But the blessed Savior heard me when I cried. Oh, that he threw his robe around me and he led me to his home. And I'm living on the hallelujah [music and singing] side. Oh, glory be [music] to Jesus.

Aren't you glad to be on the Hallelujah side? Oh my. Something about them old songs were written in hard times, but there's something about them that just tells us that there's a better place. And we're living in it. We're not waiting. Our bodies are waiting to be in a better place. But in our souls there's hallelujah ringing and so grateful for that today. Good to see each and every one of you here with us tonight. God bless you, brother JT. So good to see you back in church and tonight we're praying for Sister Clelet and each one of you. Good to have the VAS back with us today. We missed you all on Sunday. Sure appreciate each and every one of you. We love you very much. We're going to be gone for a couple of [snorts] uh couple of weeks and be back. Me and Britney, the kids will be here. So, we'll we'll be gone maybe for a little while, but uh you'll have good preaching while we're gone. So, sure you'll be looking forward to that. Ephesians chapter 1 and verse 7. I hope you're not getting tired of the book of Ephesians yet because we haven't gotten very far, but uh it won't take us this long through all of it. We're going to read verses 7 through 14 tonight. Just kind of remind ourselves of where we're at and uh to get the context what we want to say tonight. Ephesians 1, chap chapter 1, verse 7. Remember, brother Joe Adams will be with us on Sunday. Two services on Sunday. Brother Joe will be preaching both of those services. So, if you know someone that's not maybe not having church or something, you want to invite them on Sunday night, that'd be good to come here. Brother Joe, Ephesians 1:7, in whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace. wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence, having made known unto us the mystery of his will. And that's what I want to talk about tonight, but we'll read on another few verses to get the context. according to his good pleasure, which he hath purposed in himself, that in the dispensation of the fullness of times, he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven and which are on earth, even in him, in whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who workketh all things after the counsel of his own will. we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ, in whom you also trusted after that you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, in whom also after that you believed, you were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise, which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory. I pray the Lord his blessing to the word. You may be seated this evening. As we found, Paul is establishing the hearts of the visions in grace so they can receive teaching on the family, the church, spiritual warfare, etc. Brother Brandham does the same thing. He said, "I preach what Paul preached." And if you go through the message, you'll find Brother Brandham is always trying to settle the people to establish their hearts in grace so that they can receive the word of God. He says this. He said, "I'm only saying this not to mix up doctrine, but to straighten it out that we might get away from this fear and scare." He said, "You don't know who you are. You You are not going to be. But now you are the sons of God." See, we're not waiting to become sons. We are going through a process through trials, through temptation, through all of those things. Not to become sons, but to become fullgrown sons and daughters of God, to mature, to be perfected in that. But we are already sons of God. We are already seated in heavenly places. We are already in Christ. And he said, you're not going to be, but now you are the sons of God. See, you always were the sons of God. So Paul tells us that he has made known unto us the mystery of his will. And it's a very uh a very wonderful thing to know the will of God. something people have always striven to know uh that the will of God in in in uh in in history, the will of God for the church, the will of God for the people of the world, the will of God for the Jews, the will of God especially as it pertains to the individual. So God's will then is a mystery until it is revealed and then it's no longer a mystery. He said he's made known unto us the mystery of his will. Now, there's a mystery of God's will for the entire body of Christ that has been revealed in this day by the seventh angel's message, and we'll look at that in just a moment. He had to make known unto us the mystery of his will in order to get us ready to receive a a rapturing faith message, the seven thunders that would put us in a place of rapturing faith, give us rapturing faith to take us out of here. I believe all of that's taking place. It's all here for us, church. We're not looking for brother Brandham to come and give it to us. We're not looking for some other preacher to come and explain it to us. It's here for us, but we've got to take advantage of that. Maybe we'll understand that a little bit better tonight. But brother Brandham uh teaches us that that the will was revealed. But what what do we struggle with, church? We we struggle with God's will to us as individuals, &gt;&gt; right? So there's a mystery of God's will to the church. And I think most of us would say, we understand that tonight. We He said, "Brother Ben, I understand that we're in the Leoian church age. I understand that the rapture is coming. I understand that there are certain things that have to happen and Malachi 4 was to take place and all of those things and those things have happened in our time, but what about God's will for me as an individual? What does God want me to do? How does he want to place me? What does where does he want me to be? What does he want me to do?" And that's something that has to be revealed to the individual. And yet it's found in the word of God. But Brandon said this about the seals. He said the book doesn't say now Lee Vale is to be saved in time of this church age or Arman Neville or whoever. So in other words, he said the book that the lamb had in his hand in Revelation 5 was a book of names, right? It was a book of names and yet it didn't say Benjamin Puit in it. But what it said it had my identity in it. So the name had to actually be revealed to me, &gt;&gt; right? The my name would not be revealed to the age. The mystery would be revealed to the age and then my name would be revealed to me personally. So the book doesn't say our name Lee or Manval. He said it don't say that. It just shows the mystery unfolds the mystery of what the thing is. But we ourselves, &gt;&gt; yes, &gt;&gt; ourselves. You You say, "Brother Ben, it's not important that we understand these things. Why don't you preach something easier for us?" No, it is important that we understand. It's important that we get into the word. It's important that we believe the message OF THE HOUR BECAUSE IN THAT MESSAGE IS WHERE the where the revelation of the will of God for us is. That's where we find and hear our name. THAT'S WHAT CALLS US FROM ONE DIMENSION to another. Did you realize that? IT'S THE OPENING OF THE SEALS THAT CALLS US FROM THIS DIMENSION TO another dimension. &gt;&gt; Amen. The book being open AND WE SEE OURSELVES THERE. &gt;&gt; SO, so Peter's got to be seen in the book, RIGHT? JOEL'S GOT TO BE SE EVERY ONE OF YOU GOT TO BE SEEN IN THE BOOK. And and I can't see your name there. You've got to see your name there. &gt;&gt; Okay? Is that simple enough for us tonight? IT'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING I SEE. I'VE GOT TO BE SURE MYSELF. WE ourselves by faith believe it. &gt;&gt; We ourselves by faith believe it. Now we know his will is his word. How many believe that tonight? &gt;&gt; The will of God is the word of God. &gt;&gt; Someone say, "Well, I wish I knew whether uh it was God's will for me to go to church." Well, the will of God is the word of God. &gt;&gt; I wish I knew if it was the will of God for me to uh be healed. The will of God is the word of God. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Now, &gt;&gt; now let's take a specific example and as it relates to healing, I know several have been sick lately. There's laying hands on the sick. How many believe in that? &gt;&gt; Why do we believe in that? Because the word says to do it. Mark 16:18 said they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them. They shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover. So there's someone who will lay hands. There's someone who will recover. And the message of the hour reveals to us that this is his will for today. So that's what the message does. It doesn't change the Bible. It applies it. Right. &gt;&gt; Right. So brother Random come because there were men who come along and said, "Well, Mark 16 either wasn't inspired. It wasn't part of the original text or it just doesn't apply to us. It was only for the disciples." But a prophet come in our day and said, "Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever." Aren't you glad he's an ontime God? Aren't you glad he's A CURRENT GOD? NOT JUST A God of yesterday. &gt;&gt; So the message reveals to us that laying on of hands on the sick is his will for today. I know there's people don't believe in prayer lines now and don't believe in laying hands on the sick and say, "Well, that's for another day. That's for that's not for Gentiles." Brother Brandham did say that it was a gentile way was to just believe. But brother Brandham, never quit having prayer lines. Why? Because we still live in bodies of flesh. We we still live in a in a body and with a mind that's fighting US CONSTANTLY. AND SO MANY TIMES, SOMETIMES WE CAN JUST BELIEVE WHEN WE HEAR THE WORD and we CAN BE HEALED. OTHER TIMES, WE NEED HANDS LAID on us. &gt;&gt; Don't be ashamed of that, church. You say, "Well, I'm sick and I don't want TO CALL." NO. CALL FOR THE ELDERS OF THE CHURCH. THE BIBLE SAYS to do it &gt;&gt; and lay hands on the sick and they shall recover. So, Brother Brandham lets us know that's okay for today. He places that in this age, &gt;&gt; right? So, he said, "Somebody jumped on me kind of rough about that this morning. Said there's no such thing as people laying on hands on one another. It shouldn't be done." I said, "You just haven't read the Bible, brother. That's all." Paul, I said the last commission that fell from the lips of Jesus Christ was lay hands on the sick and they shall recover. He said his first commission when he gave his disciples was heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils. &gt;&gt; He said the first group he sent out, the last group he set out, these signs shall follow them that believe that cast out devils, speak with new tongues, take up serpents, drink deadly things. If they lay their hands on the sick, they shall recover. He said that's the last words he said and was received up into glory. Certainly, he said that's the great commission. I love the way brother Brandon puts this. He just believes the word. He said, "What it does, I don't know." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. [snorts] &gt;&gt; That's pretty good, isn't it? He said, "I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT LAYING ON HANDS DOES." He said, "But it does something because it's in the word." HE SAID, "IT'S JUST CARRYING OUT WHAT HE SAID, DO." &gt;&gt; SO, the Bible says to do it. The the messenger says it's for our age. But now, if you're one laying on hands or having hands laid on you, that's got to become a revelation to you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. So, it's the will of God for the age. It's it's the will of God in the Bible. It's the will of God for the age. &gt;&gt; And it's got to become the will of God for your life. &gt;&gt; Right? And that's what healing is. Brother Brandham taught us that faith is a revelation. Faith is a revelation of the will of God for our lives. God said, "I'm healed." Right? And and by faith, we appropriate that. And it's a revealed to us that I am healed. Not just that healing is for today. Because we could look at that and say, "Well, so and so could be healed or or this person could be healed or that person." But when we appropriate that faith for us as individuals and we say, "Lord, I believe I am healed. &gt;&gt; I believe I'm the one who can have hands laid on me and be healed." How many BELIEVE IT TONIGHT? I BELIEVE I'M THE ONES THAT GET ONE THAT CAN hear the word AND BE HEALED. I BELIEVE I'M THE ONE THAT CAN THAT CAN TAKE advantage of the fact that the atonement was a dual atonement for salvation and for healing. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. So if we believe that then we can take advantage of it. It becomes it has to become a revelation for ourselves. That's why many people will struggle at it and struggle at it and maybe go up to be prayed for over and over again. But R we have faith but not perfect faith because what happens is many times which it's just we just have a hard time believing it's for us. But we need to know a revelation of the will of God for our life that the word of God is true for us. Now, we know that when it comes to the scriptures, when it comes to your what you're supposed to do, who you're supposed to be, who you're supposed to marry, right? It's the will of God for many people to be married. &gt;&gt; Do you know that? But not everybody. Do you know that? That's what the Bible says. It's the will of God for some people to be married. So, if I know I'm right with the word of God, but the Bible doesn't say who to marry. That's got to be a revelation of the will of God &gt;&gt; for you. &gt;&gt; Lord knows you need that revelation. &gt;&gt; If you're going to live with that person for 50 years, &gt;&gt; right? That's got to be a revelation of the will of God to your heart. &gt;&gt; Let it be a revelation before you say, "I do." Right? &gt;&gt; Before you make a promise, let that be a revelation in your heart. My wife knew even before I knew. But it was a revelation to her. She knew I was her husband. THERE COME A TIME I KNEW SHE was my wife, &gt;&gt; right? But it had to be a revelation. It can't be somebody else says, the pastor says, people say you look good together. I don't know why I'm getting off on that, but it can't be any of that. It's got to be a revelation for you that you know, and then nothing will be able to shake that. When you have a revelation of who your wife is, who your husband is, there's nothing that can shake that. They may they may do some bad things. THEY MAY GO SOME THERE MAY BE SOME TIMES YOU DISAGREE. YOU MAY HAVE TO FIGHT FOR YOUR MARRIAGE, BUT YOU WILL FIGHT FOR IT BECAUSE YOU GOT A REVELATION. THIS IS THE WILL OF GOD FOR my life. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; SAME THING APPLIES TO A CHURCH. YOU GO TO A CHURCH and say, "Well, I'm not sure if I should be there, if I should be over there." BUT WHEN YOU GET A REVELATION OF THE WILL OF GOD THAT SAYS, "I KNOW WHERE I'M SUPPOSED TO BE, AND I'M RIGHT WHERE I'M SUPPOSED TO BE." ANYTHING. NO MATTER WHAT COMES BY, IT'S NOT GOING TO SHAKE YOU BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU'RE WHERE GOD PUTS YOU. &gt;&gt; Preachers have to have that. YOU GOT TO HAVE A A REVELATION OF THE WILL OF GOD FOR YOUR LIFE. LORD, REVEAL THAT TO ME. I CAN'T DO THAT FOR SOMEBODY, BUT God can do it for you tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. And by studying the word, reading the word, listening to the word, and then let God reveal that word, make it personal to you where you're supposed to be, what you're supposed to do. So faith is a revelation makes the word of God present tense. Brother Brandham said now he said it is not just a little thing. &gt;&gt; He said it's a mystery. &gt;&gt; God's will is a mystery and each man has to seek out the will of God for his or her self. &gt;&gt; Right? So even our sisters, you're not exempt from that. &gt;&gt; Right? You're not a lesser. When it comes to the kingdom of God, there's no male or female, no bond or you understand, right? When it comes to these things, you you you got to seek, well, my husband knows the will of God. You've got to know the will of God, &gt;&gt; right? The will of God for your healing, the will of God for your salvation, the will of God for the salvation of your children, the will of God for where you go to church and what you do and and how you help out around that. All the things that you do for your for your job as a mother. Oh church, listen. How much better mothers would there be if if mothers would have a will have a revelation of the will of God? This is what I'm supposed to do. THIS IS MY HIGHEST CALLING. THIS IS WHAT I'M SUPPOSED to be. I if if FATHERS WOULD HAVE A WILL, A WILL, A REVELATION of the will OF GOD. I'M SUPPOSED TO TAKE CARE OF MY CHILDREN. I'M SUPPOSED TO PROVIDE FOR MY FAMILY. YOU NEED YOU'VE READ THE WORD OF GOD. YOU NEED A REVELATION OF THE WILL of God. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, each one of us has a part to play. And brother Brandon says we have to seek out the will of God for ourselves. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You have a part to play. And that specific part that only you can play &gt;&gt; can only be revealed to you as an individual. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Right now, we're teaching tonight, but you just hang with me for a little bit and we'll get through it. I got a plane to catch. We're going to leave at 3:00 in the morning around that time. So, so I won't I won't be long. I promise you, you know, if you were if you've ever read a play, if you ever been in a play in high school or the Christmas play they had last year at the church, you know, there was different parts written specifically for different kids, [snorts] written specifically for for a certain person, certain character. But when if you read it without knowing what part you were playing, it wouldn't make a whole lot of sense to you, right? Because you you you can't do it all, &gt;&gt; right? You can't do it all. That's a revelation some of us ought to get, right? &gt;&gt; You can't do it all. Let other people do their job. You do your job. &gt;&gt; But in in reading a play, you you see your name there. And when you if you know that, so you you might see this is supposed to be Julius Caesar, right? Julius Caesar says uh you two Brutus. I don't remember the Latin, but Gabe, forgive me. But you know, uh, he's he's the one that says that, right? He's supposed to say that. But if I don't know that I'm playing Julius Caesar, that doesn't do me any good. &gt;&gt; But if I can put my name there. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; THEN I CAN PLAY MY PART BECAUSE I KNOW I THAT'S WHO I'm supposed to be. So the the the Bible tells us the preacher is supposed to do this. The song leaders are or worship is supposed to be this way. Let's put it like that. This is how we should worship. this is how we should sing. But the random teaches us all kinds of things like that. But there's got to be something that applies that to us. How where do we put our name there? It's got to be a revelation to the individual. So the director has got to tell you which part you play. And there is a portion of this word that speaks of you as an individual, but you got to have a a personal revelation of that. Listen, there come a time, I think I've told you this before, BUT THERE COME A TIME WHEN I SAW MYSELF, not not in a literal vision, but just in my in my heart, I COULD SEE MYSELF AS ONE OF THOSE WHO CRIED OUT, ONE OF THE MILLIONS WHO CRIED OUT. WE'RE RESTING ON THAT. AND ONCE YOU'VE SEEN YOURSELF IN THAT NUMBER, YOU CAN'T GIVE UP ON THE MESSAGE. YOU CAN'T GIVE UP ON THE THINGS THAT WE BELIEVE. WHY? YOU'VE ALREADY PLACED YOURSELF THERE. YOU'RE NOT JUST PLACING YOURSELF AS A PREACHER, NOT JUST PLACING YOURSELF AS A SINGER, BUT YOU'RE PLACING YOURSELF IN THAT NUMBER &gt;&gt; IN THE AMONG that group that receives THE WORD OF GOD FOR THE HOUR. &gt;&gt; SO, it's almost as IF I CAN SEE MY FACE THERE. YOU GOT TO BE ABLE TO SEE YOURSELF there and and recognize that THAT'S WHO YOU ARE. SEE YOURSELF IN THE WORD OF GOD. SEE YOURSELF AS HEALED. See yourself as saved. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's harder for some people than others, but God will GIVE YOU GRACE TO HAVE A REVELATION. YOU SAY, "WELL, MY PAST IS VERY DARK." BUT YOU GOT TO SEE YOURSELF AS THE CHILDREN of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, so the message teaches us that we were in God before the foundation of the world. So if we were in God, we were part of God. That means we're part of his plan. So you know, if you're too critical of yourself, you're being a little bit critical of God. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Right. You can get to a point where you just criticize yourself and you're down on yourself and and and all of that and you you just don't understand that. Especially our young people, they they they're so critical of themselves and sometimes we feed into that by being critical of them as well. But I'll say this that we we shouldn't do that because that's a son or daughter of God. They just don't know what their life's going to be yet. But but it's in God's mind. They were in the mind of God before the foundation of the earth. And brother Joel preached on that the other day. If if the word was God, brother Brandham says, "Then you were in God." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. And he said the word, the part that you're to play was in God before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; See, this is bigger than just learning how to do something and doing it. Come on. &gt;&gt; But it's actually having a revelation of the will of God that I WAS PUT HERE FOR THIS season and for this purpose. Listen, I think it ought to go deeper than just the preacher. I think it ought to go deeper than the deacons. I think IT OUGHT TO GO FURTHER THAN THE TRUSTEES and the officers of the church. IT OUGHT TO GO FURTHER EVEN THAN THE MUSICIANS. IT OUGHT TO GO DOWN TO EVERY PERSON SITTING THERE THAT SAYS, "I KNOW I WAS PUT HERE FOR A REASON. I WAS PUT HERE TO BE AN ENCOURAGEMENT. I WAS PUT HERE TO DO SOMETHING FOR THE LORD. I WAS PUT HERE TO CLAP MY HANDS IN THE SERVICE. I WAS PUT HERE. AND YOU GOT A REVELATION of that. And you say, I'M NOT JUST HERE TO BENEFIT FROM THE WORD. I WAS PUT HERE AS PART OF THE WORD IN THE PLAN OF God for this age. &gt;&gt; So then, right, &gt;&gt; my testimony means something. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; ARE YOU WITH ARE YOU WITH ME NOW? &gt;&gt; MY TESTIMONY MEANS SOMETHING. MY SUFFERINGS HAVE A PURPOSE. MY TRIAL THAT I'M GOING THROUGH HAS GOT AN END TO IT. THERE'S LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL BECAUSE I KNOW I was put here. But before the foundation of the world in the mind of God, he placed me where I am. Now, brother Brandham says nothing's out of cater. He said if the word was was God, then you were in God. The word, the part that you're to play was in God before the foundation of the world. He seen you. He knew you. &gt;&gt; Oh, I take comfort in this, Brother Stewart. He predestined predestinated you to it. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. Brother Brandham even calls the the five-fold ministry. He said, "Those are predestined gifts of God." &gt;&gt; Right? What is that? He predestinated you to it. He said, "I tell you, and and more than that, we are all predestinated to the message of the hour." &gt;&gt; He said, "I tell you, just as that eagle recognize that voice, so does a real born again Christian recognize the voice of God speaking through the word when they see it anointed and a vindicated." WHY? IT'S THE WORD SPEAKING TO THE WORD. THEY'RE PART OF THAT WORD. &gt;&gt; LOOK, he said he looked up there talking about the little chicken. He said he didn't see his old hen cluck cluck around here, join us and go over here and go to this and go to this and that. He saw a being like he wanted to be. See, this word didn't come to us in word only and letter only. Right. It come to us in a in a way that we could we could hear it, we could feel it, we could see it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. And when when when when oh my when the eagle screamed, it was uh IT WAS NOT A DISEMBODIED VOICE. &gt;&gt; BUT IT SCREAMED THROUGH A PROPHET. &gt;&gt; ARE YOU WITH me now? &gt;&gt; AND WE SAW HOW GOD WAS WITH HIM IN HIS MISTAKES. &gt;&gt; AND HE SAID, IF GOD WOULD BE WITH HIM, LIKE JOSHUA DID TO MOSES, IF GOD WOULD BE WITH HIM IN HIS MISTAKES, GOD WILL BE WITH ME IN MY MISTAKES. &gt;&gt; SO THE WORD SPOKE THROUGH A PROPHET IN OUR DAY. AND THAT EAGLE CRY, IT SCREAMED OUT TO US. AND WE DIDN'T HEAR THE CLUCK OF THE hymn that said, "Go to this AND THAT." HE SAW A BEING LIKE HE WANTED TO BE SAILING IN THE AIR, SCREAMING FREE UP IN THE HEIGHTS ABOVE ALL THE VULTURES AND THINGS OF THE EARTH. LISTEN, YOU MIGHT BE TROUBLED TONIGHT. YOU MIGHT HAVE STRUGGLES IN YOUR LIFE. YOU MIGHT BE GETTING OLDER AND FIGHTING YOUR OWN BODY. YOU MIGHT BE FIGHTING DEPRESSION OR ANXIETY. BUT REMEMBER, THERE WAS A SCREAM IN OUR DAY. AND YOU CAN YOU SEEN SOMETHING THAT YOU WANTED TO BE. I KNOW A GOD WHO DELIVERS. I KNOW A GOD WHO HEALS. I KNOW A GOD. I'VE SEEN HIM OPERATE IN A HUMAN BODY. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. He wanted to be that because it was in him to be that. &gt;&gt; Amen. [laughter] We were not born [sighs] just to struggle. We were born to overcome. &gt;&gt; We were not born JUST TO BE SICK. But before there WAS EVER ANY SICKNESS, GOD WAS A HEALER. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. He wanted to be that because it was in him to be that. And a man that's born of God, a son of God, has to have the nature of God. He has to be like God. He honors God. He's part of the word of God. And in this last days of this bride taking form, just exactly the same power that he was in at the beginning. I love that. has come up through these organizations and so forth and come out for the bride. He can't be nothing else but that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. See, you know, &gt;&gt; and I think some of us are waiting on something great for the will of God to be revealed to us. What we need to do is is desire that, to want that. Say, "Lord, reveal your will to me. I want your will to be revealed in my life. I was uh Tuesday or Monday, I think it was Monday, I was up at West Plains and and I spoke with Sister Fritz and I was talking to her and she's not here tonight, so I want to embarrass her. But Sister Fritz, as you know, is frail in her body, very, very weak. She's 92 years old. And but sister Fritz had something interesting happen in her life that intrigues me a lot and that's that she had a big part to play in transcribing the sermons of brother Brandham it to where we could read them and that was a big deal. you does anybody if you've ever listened to a realtore tape or or an unfiltered tape then you know and that's really before my time but we had them still around and and you know what that was like &gt;&gt; and somebody had to take that off of the tape and put it in a book form now most of us don't read the books anymore we read on the app right or we listen to it because it's readily available but people didn't have that and the books were much cheaper it was much cheaper to buy a book than it was to buy a tape right and you could spread it overseas you could you could translate it quicker. &gt;&gt; So, it was a big part of the message being being getting out to the world, which had to happen before we go home, &gt;&gt; right? A big part of that was people taking that message and transcribing into English, &gt;&gt; right? And listening to it and transcribing it. And so, I'm sitting there talking to her and you know, she told me something interesting. She said, you know, she said, I when I started doing that, she'd become friends with brother David Mamelis and she started doing that. It was a long-distance sort of thing. when she started, she was writing it. So, she actually wrote it and and then because she didn't know how to type. So, she's writing it and and they sent her a word processor. Well, she didn't know anything about a word processor. She had to learn how to use it cuz Sister Fritz worked in a factory and and and so she didn't know. She didn't work in an office. And and and she was want to learn how to type. And she asked Sister Mameless about it and she said something about to the effect of, "Well, you'd have to go to school to learn how to type." And Sister Fritz said she'd read where Corey Tinboom secretary was a nurse and didn't have to learn how to type. So she said, "You know what? If she could learn how to type, teach herself how to type, then I can teach myself how to type." AND SO SHE TAUGHT HERSELF TO TYPE FOR THE PURPOSE OF getting the message out. I don't know if Sister Fritz realized it because so many times she's told me this. She said, "I I just feel so useless because she's unable to do those things like she used to do." And she ended up transcribing sermons for people and doing things for that that spread the message all over the all over the world really. And and and asked her how many she did, she would do a sermon in a couple of days. And so she would have while she was working full-time and and she said probably hundreds of the sermons that we have now, she was maybe the first one probably the first one to put them on to onto book form. I'm not lifting up Sister Fritz. I want you to understand I want you young people to understand what you do matters. &gt;&gt; And you say, "Well, I don't I'm not I don't know how to do it." Some of y'all, you know, I didn't know how to set up certain things when we were brother Ivy's. I didn't know how to set up a stream, but it was on my heart to do it. And so we set up a stream for their church and and we set up where they would stream. They recorded their services on DVD and we set it up where it would stream. I taught myself to do that. I didn't realize I would need that when we came here because co shut us down. But God has a way of preparing you, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? AND IT DON'T YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A PREACHER TO DO THAT. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? You don't have to be a preacher TO LEARN HOW TO TYPE OR TO LEARN HOW TO do media or LEARN HOW TO LEARN HOW TO HELP THE SUNDAY SCHOOL OR LEARN HOW TO ARE YOU WITH ME NOW? LEARN HOW TO RUN A CAMERA. AND PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE THE IMPORTANCE of that because we're living in a day and AGE WHERE THERE'S A FAMINE FOR THE WORD OF GOD. AND I SAY LET THE WORD OF GOD BE PROCLAIMED FROM THIS PULPIT ALL OVER THE EARTH IF GOD WILL ALLOW US TO do it. &gt;&gt; We can do it in a reasonable way where we don't have to pull for money and beg for money. &gt;&gt; Right? And I know my primary responsibility is to you as a church, but I believe there's there's THERE'S SEED OF GOD SOMEWHERE OUT THERE AND MAYBE THEY'LL HEAR IT AND BELIEVE IT. I don't want to hide our light behind A BUSHEL. I I DON'T WANT TO BECOME A BASKET CASE, AS WE TALKED ABOUT, HIDING OFF SOMEWHERE. I WANT TO BE SOMEBODY WHO'S WILLING TO SPREAD THE GOSPEL. WE SHOULD NOT BE ASHAMED OF WHAT WE PREACH. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; BUT SOMETIMES THE ONLY QUALIFICATION YOU NEED IS JUST TO BE WILLING. I REMEMBER THE first time I WENT OVERSEAS. I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW, I'M NOT A MISSIONARY. I'm still not a missionary, BUT I WENT OVERSEAS AND AND I STRUGGLED WITH THAT BECAUSE THAT'S NOT WHAT I DO. IT'S NOT WHAT I'M GOOD AT. This is where I feel comfortable is right HERE IN THIS PULPIT PREACHING TO YOU. BUT WHEN I WENT OVERSEAS, BUT GOD HAS USED THAT. I've seen him use that. I've seen miracles happen cuz somebody WAS WILLING TO GO. LISTEN, SOMETIMES THE ONLY QUALIFICATION YOU NEED IS JUST TO BE WILLING. LORD, LET LET YOUR WILL BE REVEALED TO ME. AND MAYBE THAT WILL IS NOT STANDING IN A PULPIT. MAYBE IT'S NOT PREACHING THE WORD. MAYBE IT'S SUPPORTING THE WORD. MAYBE IT'S GETTING A GOOD JOB SO YOU CAN YOU CAN HELP WITH THE FINANCES. MAYBE IT'S DOING SOMETHING LIKE THAT. BUT LET IT BE HIS will and not your will. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon talked about Peter and the wolf. I said I wasn't going to hold you long and get off on a tangent like that, but I think that's important. Yeah. &gt;&gt; I I want us I challenged the older young people in Ohio when we were at the camp this year and I was grateful to be able to speak to some of the 21 and up club there and they have a group of about 60 kids and I challenged them with that story about Sister Fritz and I didn't know all the details that I heard from her yesterday or Monday but I challenged them with that because I said you can do something for the message. It's time you turn around. The message been good to you. You've been to youth camp after youth camp after youth camp. And people have been coming and telling you you're going to make it. And preachers have been preaching their guts out telling you you're going to MAKE IT. BUT AT SOME POINT, YOU GOT to turn around and say, "Hey, I'M GOING TO DO SOMETHING FOR THE MESSAGE. I'M GOING I'M GOING TO LIVE FOR THE MESSAGE. I'M GOING TO I'M I'M GOING TO PUBLISH IT. I'M GOING TO DO EVERYTHING I CAN." LISTEN, it was THERE WAS SOME WHO WERE CALLED TO GIVE THE WORD. BUT THE BIBLE SAYS, "GREAT WAS THE COMPANY of those who published it." &gt;&gt; Yes. Good. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; So, but brother Brandham typed it to Peter and the Wolf. How that you know if you've ever heard that, how many of you kids have ever seen listen to Peter and the Wolf or watched it? Parents, what are we doing? Peter and the Wolf is a is a play. You can watch it on YouTube. It's a play and it's musical. It's very fun and funny. In fact, they made a cartoon, too, if that helps. You know, that's what I watched, but But you can actually watch the orchestra version of it, too. And if you go watch it, you can see all the different instruments and the sounds they make. There's an instrument for the duck and an instrument for the uh for the wolf and different different instruments they use for the hunters. And each one it builds tension and drama. It's very important. So you guys go home and not tonight, but later go watch that and and uh let's give you permission to watch YouTube there, you know, if your parents allow it. But there's something important in that and that's that each part makes a difference. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. So there's there's a guy standing over there and I've always, you know, there's one guy plays symbols, right? And he's got them great big symbols. He's just standing there the whole time and he's just waiting and crash at the right time. You know, he plays there's a there's actually a [snorts] a symphony that was written where they had cannon, real cannon in the symphony. And if they at a certain point them cannons were just standing there at a certain point the cannons go off and that's all them guys do is light the cannon but without them there's nothing to the symphony. It doesn't have the same effect without live cannon. They found that out. So there's a there's something about the way the music is written that involves everybody in the orchestra. So brother Brandham talked about that and how people were trying to give a note that hit back in the days of Luther and Wesley. He said like that when actually the music sheet here shows that it's another day. So what is that? A revelation of the will of God. So when the composer gives it to the director, then the director can look at it and say, "Well, this was for another day, but this is for today." &gt;&gt; Right? So you got to have your timing right. &gt;&gt; In the music, you've got to have your timing. Isn't that right, musicians? You got to have the timing. You can be ever so good, but if you don't know timing, you get in trouble. So the entire reason we have a bass and drums is to keep the time right. &gt;&gt; Right. That's to keep the music flowing, keep the time right. So now look, so he said the music sheet shows us another day. We can't live in the light of Luther. He was a reformer. We appreciate his part, but we played that out. WE'RE WAY OVER HERE AT THE BACK of the book now. We can't play it out like that. And he goes into that and he talks about how the director must get in the same spirit as the composer, the one who wrote it. He said, "Then when they say the days of miracles is passed, they don't hit the right note." But when it gets in the right swing of it and the right spirit of it, he said, "How you going to do it until the spirit comes down of the composer?" He said, "Then when you say the days of miracles never pass, the symphony cries out, amen." When we hit and say Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever, the symphony cries out, "Amen. You shall receive power after this. The Holy Ghost has come UPON YOU." THE SYMPHONY CRIES. &gt;&gt; Amen's your part. I got it. He said, "THERE'S NO MORE GUESSWORK ABOUT IT." THEN HE SAID, "THE WHOLE SYMPHONY IS RIGHT IN HARMONY WITH THE WORD." HE SAID, "IT'S GOING." And he clapped his hands. That's it. He said, "OH, IT'S A magnificent thing. The director AND THE COMPOSER MUST BE IN THE SAME SPIRIT." AND SO MUST THE MUSICIANS BE IN THE SAME SPIRIT TO ACT IT ALL OUT. SO IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU'RE PREACHING OR IF YOU'RE ONE PUBLISHING THE WORD OR IF YOU'RE ONE JUST BACKING THE PREACHER, YOU STILL GOT TO BE IN THE SPIRIT OF THE COMPOSER. &gt;&gt; Come on now. That's the mystery OF THE WILL OF GOD FOR YOUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; GOOD. [snorts] &gt;&gt; And only he can reveal it to you. He said to act it all out in the world is wondering what's going on. The brother said many times we get nervous and we begin to think well it ought to be this way and we got to make it this way or make it that way. We don't have nothing to do into it. Just play our part. So we can't we don't write the music. We just play our part. &gt;&gt; That he leads us to play. &gt;&gt; He said, "Remember, there's nothing out of cater." Don't you love that? &gt;&gt; So the mystery is the mystery of his will for our lives, not for someone else. &gt;&gt; But for us, we don't need to match one another. &gt;&gt; We need to match the word. In fact, Romans says, "Who art thou that judgeest another man's servant? To his own master, he standeth or falleth." &gt;&gt; He said, "He'll be holding up for God is able to make him stand." So you'll find I'll just use this as the illustration and we'll close soon but [snorts] at some point. So Peter and John in the New Testament were you know they were kind of rivals. You remember the story how they branded the tomb and John writes and Peter set off first but John beat him to the tomb and John calls himself the one that Jesus loved. Right? He's writing the the book and he calls himself the one who Jesus loves and I love that. But he was so confident in that and and he beat Peter to the tomb and make sure to write that. It's not in any of the other gospels. Peter forgot about it, you know, and when he told Mark, but John [snorts] remembered and so they're kind of rivals and and Jesus told Peter when when Jesus appeared to him by the side of the lake, you remember? And he comes and he cooks dinner for him. Jesus cooks dinner for the disciples. &gt;&gt; And and and [clears throat] he tells Peter, he keeps telling him, "Feed my sheep." Said, "Do you love me?" And he said, ' Do you love me more than these? Do you love me more than the other disciples, Peter? Peter says, "You know I love you." He said, "Then feed my sheep. &gt;&gt; Feed my lambs." And then he proceeds to tell him how he's going to die. &gt;&gt; WHAT AN ODD THING TO TELL SOMEBODY. HE SAID, "FEED MY LAMBS." And then tells HIM HOW HE'S GOING TO DIE. LOOK at John 21:18. He said, "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, when thou was young, thou girdest thyself, and walkest whether thou wouldest, when thou shalt behold, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee whether thou wouldest not to a cross." This spake he's signifying by what death he should glorify God. See, it's telling us Peter would die like Jesus would die only upside down according to history. When he had spoken this, he saith unto them, he said unto him, "Follow me." And Peter, what a revelation of the will of God for your life. Think about it. He knows it's thus sayeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; He knows whatever Jesus said is going to come to pass. &gt;&gt; And Jesus just told him, said, "You're going to die. &gt;&gt; You're not only gonna die, you're gonna you're gonna be taken somewhere you don't want to go." &gt;&gt; Right? And Peter turned around and looked at John. It's like, okay, that's bad, but his has got to be worse, right? So, he see the see seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved, Jesus' favorite kind of or at least that's what it was perceived following, which also leaned on his breast at supper and said, "Lord," and and and this is the one who said, "Lord, which is he that betrayeth thee?" So, this is John. In verse 21, Peter seeing him said to Jesus,"Lord, what shall this man do? How's he going to die? How what's going to happen to him?" &gt;&gt; BUT JESUS SAID, "YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW THE WILL OF GOD FOR somebody else's life. &gt;&gt; You need to know the will of God for your own life. &gt;&gt; The mystery of God's will for your own life." AND AND JESUS SAID, "IF I WILL THAT HE TRIED TILL I COME." WHAT IS THAT TO THEE? FOLLOW THOU ME. And the people that heard it, brother Herald, made a doctrine out of it, just like they did with brother Brandham. And they tried to make John live forever. &gt;&gt; And then when he died, a bunch of people left the message. &gt;&gt; Same thing happened back there that happened in our day and age. But they misinterpreted Jesus' words. But Jesus didn't say that he would live till he come. He said, "What if he does? &gt;&gt; What is that to you, Peter? Follow me." &gt;&gt; Oh my. He may not have John had his own. In fact, I believe John was the only one that actually lived to be in of old age. And they tried to boil him in oil and he wouldn't boil. BUT BUT GOD TELLING PETER SAID, "YOU got you there's A WILL FOR YOUR LIFE. JUST JUST SURRENDER YOURSELF TO THAT. DON'T BE LOOKING AT WHAT somebody else is doing. SURRENDER YOURSELF TO THE WILL OF GOD FOR YOUR LIFE." BROTHER BRANDON SAID A few days ago, Brother Joseph, he's talking about Joseph Boz in Chicago. Brother Joseph encouraged me a lot. He said, 'I seen a lot of stuff rising up in the churches that should not be. Oh well. He said, I was an Irishman, you know, I had to go out and stop it all myself. I WAS GOING TO GO OUT AND SAY THIS CAN'T BE LIKE THIS AND THIS CAN'T BE like that. Can't do it because you're going to spoil God's program. You're getting stuff in there that shouldn't be all this. And I knew it was wrong. It's scripturally wrong. He said, "THE FIRST THING YOU KNOW, I BEGIN TO FIND MYSELF GETTING A LITTLE KIND OF off the line, getting bitter. I stopped out there and I went be to pray." He said, "And Joseph came down." He said, "Look," he said, "I just read the history of Martin Luther and the question was that they didn't wonder about Martin Luther able to protest the Catholic Church and get by with it. But what the wonder was with Martin Luther is all the fanaticism that followed it." And he raised up out of all of it. That's the main thing. HE SAID, "THEN I HEARD AS IT WAS that Christ said, what is that TO THEE? FOLLOW THOU ME. I'LL TAKE CARE OF THE REST." OH, IF WE COULD GET A REVELATION OF THAT TODAY, WE LOOK AT WHAT SOMEBODY ELSE DOES OR WHAT ANOTHER PREACHER IN THE CHURCH DOES OR ANOTHER PREACHER IN ANOTHER CHURCH DOES OR WHAT ANOTHER PERSON IN THE CHURCH DOES. DON'T LOOK AT THEM. FOLLOW THOU ME. &gt;&gt; I'll take care of the rest of it. YOU JUST GO AHEAD and follow me. That's the way it is. Then get back to carefree again. It's a good way to live without the cares of life and cares wearing you wearing you down making you bitter. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon makes an interesting statement. He said, "That's the reason, brethren, that we're holding up the adoption of God." &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; As our difference of life and fussing and quarreling amongst one another is the reason the veil can't drop behind us. We can go into that presence of God. We're so interested in our denominations. We're so interested in what the next fellow. What is that to thee? Follow thou me. It's an individual affair between every minister. HOW A MINISTER OUGHT TO ALWAYS GET ALONE TO HIMSELF. Even before he preaches, before he prays, before he does anything, he should get alone WITH GOD IN THAT QUIET PLACE. HIT away with God. I'll be honest with you, it's hard to get alone with God here at the church be once church has started or even before. I do that at home. I do that. I try to do that days before, hours before to TRY TO MAKE SURE MY MY MIND'S right when I'm studying. My heart's right. GET ALONG WITH GOD BECAUSE HE'S THE ONLY ONE I'M EVER GOING TO ANSWER TO. &gt;&gt; RIGHT? It's not GOING TO BE WHETHER OR NOT OTHER PEOPLE THOUGHT I did a good job. SO, I DON'T JUST PREACH WHAT OTHER PEOPLE PREACH. I PREACH WHAT GOD PUTS ON MY HEART. I CAN'T EVEN PREACH WHAT THE PEOPLE want to hear. Are you with ME ON THAT? LIKE, I CAN'T DO THAT. I'D LOVE TO DO THAT, BUT I CAN'T JUST PREACH WHAT YOU WANT TO HEAR. I GOT TO PREACH WHAT GOD PUTS ON MY HEART &gt;&gt; because I got to have the will of God, a revelation of the will of God, the mystery of God's will for my life, &gt;&gt; right? He said, "Get away." Before he does anything, he should get alone with God in that quiet place. Get away with God. Now, he said he made known to us the mystery. Are you [snorts] still with me? I've got just a few more minutes. He said, "Get the Holy Spirit on you sometime and start running that and just watch how it goes." Brother Brandham tells us he studied this in 30 minutes, two 15minute increments. He was a prophet. Cuz brother Brandham reaches into the mystery of the will of God and pulls out Melzdc. Go listen to adoption number four. He reaches into the mystery of the will of God and pulls out Melzdc. He said, "I got to run in and the mystery, how much tears the scripture packed me in back in the Old Testament, back in the New Testament, tied something together." See, the mystery of his coming, the mystery of his will, the mystery of us sitting together. He said, "Remember, it cannot be taught in any seminary. It's a mystery. YOU CAN'T KNOW IT BY EDUCATION, BY THEOLOGY. It's a mystery that's been hidden since the foundation of the world, WAITING FOR THE manifestation of the sons of God." He takes that to Melzdc. I'll skip past reading that. In Hebrews chapter 7, he talked about how Melzdc was without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, made like the son of God, abiding a priest continually. He said that he said notice this Melzdc. He said as he met Abraham coming from the slaughter of the kings, the mystery of God now being made known. Who was he? They can't find the history of him. He said he never did have a beginning. I'm skipping through here, brother Robert. He never did have A BEGINNING, SO HE COULDN'T HAVE been nobody else but law. Elohim, self-existence, self-abiding, almighty God. Brother Brandham was the was the only one who could see that. &gt;&gt; Why? God sent a prophet &gt;&gt; to open that up to us. &gt;&gt; But brother Brandham, he's using that to teach us something. And if you go listen to it, Brother Brandham's using that to teach us that the message came in perfect order &gt;&gt; because before the seals, we had to have the church ages. And before the seals, we had to before we could receive who is this MelzDC, we had to receive adoption. Right? Right? And the message of grace &gt;&gt; and the stature of a perfect man &gt;&gt; had to come before the opening of the seals, &gt;&gt; before the rapture, before Christ's mystery of God revealed, &gt;&gt; right? It come in perfect order. Now, why did it have to come like that? Because brother Brandon types it to Abraham taking his position going and getting his fallen brother and then coming back and meeting Melzdc. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Oh church, you realize what's happened in our day. We've met Christ the word. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; We didn't meet a man. We didn't meet William Brandon. We met the God Elohim. Yes, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon wasn't Elohim. But he introduced us to Elohim. &gt;&gt; So after the church takes its position, he said we're called to the adoption of sons by the Holy Spirit. And when each man TAKES HIS POSITION, WHAT GOD HAS CALLED HIM TO DO AND STAND TO THE END OF THE ROAD GOING after the lost. ABRAHAM GOING AFTER LOT CUZ LOT was part of him. &gt;&gt; Oh church, HE SAID THAT'S OUR POSITION. THAT'S OUR ADOPTION. &gt;&gt; AND WHEN Abraham received that, then he comes back and meets Melzdc. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He said first Paul took all the scare out of it. He said, "If you're called, if you're not just worked up in some kind of theology, if you're really born of the spirit, then God predestined you before the foundation of the world. Put your name on the lamb's book of life. And now we come together to sit in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. He served Abraham communion after the battle." He said the same thing Melzdc did after Abraham had got his position, set his men in order, and won the battle. Come home and Melzed, come out with bread and wine. After the battle's over, we'll eat the wedding supper with the Lord Jesus in THE NEW WORLD. DON'T BE AFRAID TO SURRENDER TO THE MYSTERY OF THE WILL OF GOD IN THIS LIFE BECAUSE WE ALREADY KNOW WHAT THE WILL OF GOD IS FOR THE NEXT ONE. WE ALREADY KNOW WE'RE GOING TO A WEDDING supper &gt;&gt; to meet Melzdc made flesh. [snorts] Listen, what is the mystery of his will? It's the fullness of adoption. He made us listen, brother Brandon says this, having made known to us the mystery of his will to adopt us. That's the mystery of his will, right? What is the mystery his will for my life? to adopt you to make you a full-g grown son or daughter of God &gt;&gt; so you can fill whatever part &gt;&gt; and then that will of God will be revealed to you. &gt;&gt; What is the mystery of the will of God for your life? It's to be one of those brethren that he was the firstborn among many brethren to play that part. Moses was 80 years old when he began to play it. The music was playing the whole time, but Moses had Moses had to stop and wait. Other people played their part and finally Moses said, "God, I'm insufficient." And God said, "Now I can use you." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But what did he tell Moses? Look, he said, "Well, is God going to give me some superpower?" No. What do you do with Moses? He said, first he revealed the mystery of the will of God. Said, "You're going to go down deliver my people." And then he said, "What's in your hand?" &gt;&gt; Right? Use what you already have. If you're a singer, God's going to use that. &gt;&gt; If you're a preacher, God's going to use that. If you're a help of some kind in the church, God's going to use that. Use what's in your hand. DON'T WORRY ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE. USE WHAT'S IN YOUR HAND. DO WHAT YOU CAN DO. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Dry stick that he had in his hand become a judgment rod because he had met the pillar of fire and had been had the mystery of the will of God for his life revealed to him. Each one of us have to meet that same pillar of fire. Look at 2 Peter 1:10. musicians come. He said, "Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure. For if you do these things, you shall never fall." Notice he just he doesn't say just make your election sure. He said make your calling an election sure. &gt;&gt; Make sure you KNOW THE WILL OF GOD FOR YOUR LIFE. Seek those things. If you do these things, you shall never fall. For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. I wonder if we know I don't know if we know that song. Speak the word, Lord. Speak the word, Lord. I think I had him put it in the in the system. Hallelujah. Oh, let's just sing this. And do you want to know the will of God for your life? Do you want to surrender to it? I do. You say, "Well, I'm old now and I maybe you waited till this time to show you what you what you've been doing all along. What's that in your hand?" Some of y'all are such an encouragement to me. And maybe that's what God called you to be. Some [snorts] of some of you are an encouragement to your family, to your children, to your grandchildren. Just be that. Become mature in that. It maybe it's a it's a singer or a song leader or something like that. But Lord, speak to me. I WANT TO KNOW THAT THIS IS WHAT I'M SUPPOSED TO BE DOING. I WANT TO KNOW. LISTEN, THAT'S WHY WE DON'T PROSTITE PEOPLE. OH, come on, church. We don't do that. I don't play those games. &gt;&gt; I DON'T GO OUT TRYING TO GET PEOPLE TO COME TO CHURCH HERE. I WANT THE PEOPLE THAT GOD SENT HERE. &gt;&gt; AND IF GOD SENDS YOU HERE, YOU GET A MYSTERY, a revelation of the mystery of God, THE WILL OF GOD FOR YOUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; WE DON'T WANT TO BUILD JUST A BIG CHURCH. WE I I want I want the pews to be full, but I want people to be there that are supposed to be there that want to be there that that's been revealed to them. THIS IS WHERE I BELONG. I'M GOING TO BE A PART OF WHAT GOD WANTS to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. Speak the word, Lord, and I'll hear it. Amen. Let's sing this together before we go tonight. Speak the word, Lord. Oh, let's sing the the the chorus now. Oh, speak [singing and music] the word, Lord. My ears long [singing] to hear you. Oh, sing it now. Speak the word, oh Lord. [singing] My heart waits to know.

Your servant will go. &gt;&gt; Sing that first verse now. [music] It's a foreign battlefield. &gt;&gt; Where I finally find your will, Lord. Then that's where [singing] we can say amen to that. I long to be. Amen. Let's take that kind of surrender tonight. Oh, in the desert without a drink or on some ship about to sing. Oh Lord, I'll go. Hallelujah. If you just speak to me. [singing] [music] Sing it now. Speak the word, Lord. Let's stand together. Speak the word, Lord. Oh, my [music and singing] ears long to hear you. Oh, can you just raise your hands to me?

Oh, speak [music] the word, [singing] Lord. Your servant will know. We have the next verse. Now, hallelujah. There's been times that I've complained. You ever been there? As I rubbed [singing] against the grain, and I recall [singing] those times you took me to my [music] knees. Oh, but there's one thing I could do. [music and singing] So I still owe this thanks [music] to you. &gt;&gt; For it was you, Lord. Aren't you glad you did? Who took my cross [music] to Calary? [singing] Sing it now with all your heart. Speak the word, Lord. Oh [singing and music] my ears, Lord, to hear you. Oh, grab me Lord. Oh, speak [music and singing] the word, Lord. Oh, my hearts to know. [music and singing] Oh, speak the word, Lord, and I'll [singing and music] be what you'd have me to be. Oh, speak the word, Lord. Your servant will go. Sing the first verse again. Oh, if it's a foreign battlefield where I finally find your will, Lord, then that's [music] where I long to be. Oh, in the desert without [singing] a drink. Glory &gt;&gt; on some old ship about to sink. [music and singing] Lord, I'll go in. You'll just speak [music] to me. &gt;&gt; Sing it one more time. Speak the word. Speak the word, Lord. My [singing] ears [music] long to hear you. Speak the word. Oh, [music] speak the word, Lord. Granny Lord, my heart aches to know. [singing] [music] Oh, speak the word, [singing] Lord. I'll be what you'd have me to [music] be. Let's speak the word. [singing] Lord, your servant will go. Before we sing [music] that again, I I a little Theo come up. He wanted to show me. We prayed for him Sunday morning with open sores on his leg and he pulled up his pants leg and showed me where it had been completely healed. I thank the Lord for that. That's wonderful. [applause] [music] Listen, church. You know, if we just be in our place [music] and be there, God wants to do miraculous things for you. You be here on Sunday and Brother Joe Adam's going to preach and I'm God can do the miraculous for you. I I'm sure that'll build your faith. God can heal you. He can take care of things in your life. You just try to do your best. Some of some can't even come to church. They're sick. But God knew that and he knew he'd be he'd reach down right where they're at tonight and heal them. I believe the same God that heal little Theo can heal you. And I believe that with all my heart. Oh, what a wonderful testimony out of the mouth of babes. Amen. Little children, he said he would speak to us. I believe that. We've seen children get their healing. By the time some of us adults grab some hold of some faith and said, "Lord, I believe. I believe. Help thou my unbelief. Speak the word, Lord. Oh, I WANT TO HEAR WHAT YOU GOT TO SAY. I want to do what you want me to do." Hallelujah. Amen. We're going to sing the chorus again and let's just sing it and if we could play it softly and I want you to I think you know it now. I want you to sing it with all your heart. Let it be your prayer now as they play it softly now. Oh, speak the word Lord. We want to hear you sing it. Long [music] to [singing] hear you. Oh, that's good. Oh, speak the word, Lord. My heart aches to know. Oh, thank you, Jesus. Speak the word, Lord. I'll be [singing and music] what you'd have me to be. [music] Oh, speak [singing] the word, Lord.

They'd sing and shout while surrounded by God's holy [music] angel band. [singing] Well, if you think it's all long gone and the miracles are done, well, I have some good news to bring to you.
