an ability to see who we are Lord and where we belong if it wasn't for you so we thank you tonight and we worship you Lord I ask you tonight to move me out of the way speak directly to your people I pray God if there'd be some need represented here in the building tonight that you would move me to that Lord and let me speak something that would be a word in due season Lord and that would be enough for us Lord and I pray that you'd heal the sick and touch those that are in need Lord those that are watching father thank you for these that have come out tonight I I pray you'd bless them abundantly May tonight be a a banner night in the house of the Lord that we can say surely Lord that you talk to us along the way I pray you grant it tonight we love you we thank you for it in Jesus name amen amen God bless you turn with me to Genesis chapter 49 Genesis chapter 49 and verse one it's good to be back with you this this evening and we don't have any plans to travel anytime soon so we'll be with you had to put up with us a little bit more uh it's good to uh good to have all of you in church tonight my goodness just about a full Wednesday night crowd and good to see that and we just love each and every one of you and uh was our hearts were thrilled to hear of the baby being born that's a miracle baby and we give that testimony when we we get an opportunity maybe maybe when we dedicated if we do that and to let us do that so but we sure we sure appreciate our families our young people and and you know they grow up and then they get married and have kids and you want to see them uh come along and and the lord to bless them and in whatever way and there'll be many trials but our God is always a faithful God he's the same yesterday today and forever he's a Healer how many believe that tonight he's a redeemer he's a savior we see our little ones even here tonight our little babies here and young people and kids God has blessed us abundantly we should never lose sight of that see our elders here in the house of God With Us have the strength to come out on a Wednesday night God bless you for coming amen I can just stand up here and Worship the Lord all night for what he's done for us our young men our young people our young ladies so thankful for all of you tonight and what God has done in our lives Genesis 49 And1 says Jacob called unto his sons and said Gather yourselves together that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days gather yourselves together and hear ye sons of Jacob and hearken unto Israel your father so this will be more than just a a father wanting his kids to do well in life but it would be an actual word spoken by a prophet spoken over these children these uh these young men and I want to deal with Ruben tonight so we'll read this Ruben Thou Art my firstborn my might and the beginning of my strength the Excellency of dignity and the Excellency of power unstable as water Thou shalt not Excel because thou wentest up to thy father's bed then defiles thou it he went up to my couch I pray the Lord would add his Blessing to the word you may be seated we dealt and began last week dealing with our allotment in the promise uh brother Stewart picked up very nicely on that on Sunday uh we enjoyed the services I got to watch some of the service Sunday morning some of the service Sunday night and as we were brother uh Ben beards he's the pastor there in in Galina and uh those people sent their greetings as well and just become a sister Church to us and so I wanted to go do that for them but while we were uh preaching for them and by the way brother Ben's going to come preach for us sometime in April last year we had him you remember the snowstorm and so I'm trying to make it as far away from a snowstorm as possible but if you'll remember he uh that Sunday morning went just a little bit lengthy and I returned the favor this weekend so we're all all good I we called the truth and the war's over so so he'll be back preaching for us at some point this spring uh but we're dealing with this uh this allotment and looking at the the 12 tribes that are were given a portion of the land and I was saying we enjoyed that Sunday brother Stuart mentioned that allotment as well when it pertained to Paul and and the New Testament and we we realized that brother brandham said that when Joshua divided the inheritance to the people he said each person was placed positionally exactly he said the way these Hebrew mothers named those children now it's not always Apparent from the name itself just what it was but brother Bram tells us in dealing with this he says uh he says if you're looking at it and you don't see how it all fits together he said remember he said the Bible's not wrong he said maybe the way you're thinking about it's wrong so we know the word of God's always right so he said uh each one they named those children how they repl in Palestine just at their place Asher Gad and AP each one Judah everyone just placed in their position he said what a wonderful picture it gets us because it's a type of God placing in the church so as we talk about this we don't want to lose sight of our type that it's God placing us and we want to find our place and our position and what our boundaries are and so and so he said it's a type of God placing in the church himself every member so if you're a part of the Church of God if you're part of the Bride tonight uh God has placed you in the church you're not here by accident he did that himself right every member men and women boys and girls all of you together all of us together he said every place every Christian to itself he talked about Solomon's Temple and I didn't have time for the full quote but he said there were some odd rocks that we don't always understand I just love that quote because I I resemble that quote little bit odd rocks we don't always understand but yet God they fit in somewhere there's a place for them in the temple of God so he said Joshua by inspiration not just mathematics but inspired by God how many uh believe that tonight he was inspired by God and he lotted each one of those Patriarchs in in their position just exactly the way their name belongs so the first son born to Jacob was reuben reuben not the sandwich I I I mentioned that I wasn't even thinking about that and I mentioned uh I was going to be preaching on Ruben and Joel said well you're going to make everybody hungry and it it didn't occur to me just what he meant at first and then uh I I mentioned it to trip and he's like the sandwich and no no Reuben the the patriarch Jacob's eldest son and so the sandwich was named after a Jewish man in New York City whose name was Reuben and so uh but and and Reuben literally you say well what deep meaning does the name have well Reuben his name literally means Behold a son we just close up and go home that's what Ruben means Behold a son or look a son and there there's more meaning to that than what we realize because remember when Leah his mother had him we've talked about Leah she Genesis 29:32 said Leah conceived and bear a son she called his name Ruben for she said surely the Lord hath looked upon my Affliction what was her Affliction she was loved less than Rachel remember Rachel was the favorite and and anytime you got two wives that'll be a problem just warning you so if you plan on having more than one wife that's a problem so you going love one more than the other it's just the way that it is and so uh she she was loved more uh than Rachel and yet it was Leah who was buried with Jacob in the place of the Resurrection so it was Leah who raised with him and so uh Leah was you could say Leah was God's choice right even for Jacob uh maybe Jacob didn't recognize that but it was so so he said surely the Lord hath looked upon my Affliction now therefore my husband love me and that's just a really pathetic uh kind of thought but so she says look a son right it's a son I had a son surely my husband will love me now so and again there was favoritism in the family and he was tricked into marrying Leah so he never did just treat her quite the same way but uh it speaks uh look you know Behold a son or look a son speaks of an eldest son who's never really treated as an eldest son because think about it and we'll get into it a little bit later but Reuben was the oldest but he didn't have the birth right he was the oldest but he didn't wasn't the first one to inherit he was the oldest but not the one not the tribe that Christ come from in in the natural right he was the oldest and all of those things just by rights looking at it the way the custom was should have come from him but it didn't so you'll find that in these birth orders and I want us to understand this that there was an allotment and there's an allotment given to you there's a certain place and something that you should be doing and yet Brother Bruce it's not we're not we're not tied necessarily there's a little room in that for us to become there there's a mystery hidden in that if I could say it that way so the land was had boundaries right and they were each given a certain allotment in the land but what was in that land was a mystery and only when it was worked by the children of Israel would it become exactly what it was supposed to be and so how each one worked it mattered in the land so there's an election right that God elected them to a certain spot and there's a placing that God has placed you in a certain spot and yet yet how you work that land matters right right so there's grace and works the two coming together brandom taught us that Grace is what God does for you he said works is what you do for God right and and and he said that uh uh he said Paul in in Hebrews was speaking what God saw he said Abraham was justified by faith and in Romans and James looked at what man saw and said he was justified by works yes right because there was room within the boundaries of that to believe or to disbelieve right to to accept What God Says and and and live the gospel or not and we still have that ability today we're free moral agents and yet you can't be what you're not once you're called and what you're place then you have room to improve that and and make that what everything you can be everything God called you to be or you could be less than that and so uh you're not helpless tonight you're not we're not sitting here saying well just what will be will be and that's not the case at all but we're Fighters we're we're warriors we come out and and we want to improve the the land that God's given us we want to build it we want to we want to do all that we can for the kingdom of God we we're not just going to sit here we're going to do something about it so we know that the promise is to the Overcomer he said your seed will possess the Gate of the enemy but somebody's got to do the possessing right somebody had to do the fighting but he promised it was possible Right somebody's got to got to pick up the gates and carry them up the hill but but but he promised it was possible it may be impossible for but it's possible for you but now that it's possible you've got to do something about it so the the the bride is the ones that will overcome they're the ones that will press the battle they're the ones that will do what God called them to do they're not just going to sit back and say well I I'm just waiting on God to do no he's already given you the word he's already given you an open book He's already given you the land to to be a part of we're in the land let's look around and see what's ours take advantage of it all right So you you're already healed how many believe that tonight healing is in the land it's part of your land right that's in the land but but we got to have the faith to appropriate that we got to have the faith to reach out and grab a hold of that that's what we do right now in in all seven Church ages there was a promise given to the Overcomer someone say it with me tonight the Overcomer in Ephesus he said to him that over cometh I give to eat of the Tree of Life Revelation 2:7 he said and which is in the midst of the paradise of God to Smyrna he said he that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death to pergamum he says uh he says to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the Hidden Mana I will give him a white stone in the stone a new name written which no man knowth saving he that received if you haven't read your church AIDS book in a while the brandom goes into each one of those and tells us what they are in thyra he said he that overcometh and keepeth my Works to the end he said well I just Coast on by but see each each age was given a part of the land and we've been given all of it brother brandom taught us these these blessings these promises were cumulative right that we don't just get one of them we get all of them to him every age we get all of it cuz the land's all ours this is the land where all the promises lay are you with me tonight this is the country where anything where all things are possible but you got to go take advantage of that right he said he that overcometh and keepeth my Works to the end to him will I give power over the Nations he shall rule them with a rod of iron and the vessels of the Potter shall they be broken into Shivers even as I received my father Sardis he said he that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white rain and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life I'm so grateful for that but I will confess his name before my father and before his angels I'm just reading these two you don't have time to go into all what they mean but he said him that overcometh in Philadelphia I make a pillar in the temple of my god oh I want to be a pillar in the temple of God he shall go no more out I will write upon him the name of my God the name of the city of my God which is New Jerusalem which cometh down out of Heaven from my God he he said I will write upon him my new name Leia he said to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me and my Throne this is our specific promise yes they all apply to us he said even as I also overcame and sat down with my father and his throne so Revelation 21:7 kind of sums it up NE neatly says now who's going to do this he that overcometh now and I kind of give you a little hint where we're going but look sometimes you got to overcome your position yes right and overcome in your position right right because how does a preacher overcome in his position how you got to fight for that right you got to fight to study you got to fight to preach you got to fight your body fight your voice fight fight the elements fight I start to say fight the people but that's not exactly right he told Jeremiah he said don't be afraid of their faces you knowuh but but you got got to fight in your position to get what God has called you to to get and to become right and so God's made you a certain thing and I've told you many times brother Daryl Ward told me years ago he said he said you may only be a 10-cent preacher he said but if you uh if you only give God an nickel he said you've robbed God of five cents right that's just basic math right but you want to be all that God's called you to be you can't be what somebody else has called you to be but you want to be all that God has called you to be so in looking at these birth pths we need to be careful that we recognize this now now he said he that overcometh Revelation 21:7 shall inherit all things someone say it with me all things and I will be his God and he shall be my son who will do that he that overcometh so God's way is never changed you are his chosen elected bride but you got to make yourself ready now how you going to do that by Grace by the provide provision of the word by what he's already given you of the word you you don't have to create a dress to put on he's given you a word to be dressed in but what do you have to do you got to put it on all right all you got to do is put it on all you got to do is take advantage we have the word we have the spirit all you got to do is grab a hold of come on Church somebody is going to do it somebody is going to grab a hold of the word and dress themselves and be made ready for the Rapture I want to be part of that group yeah so he said let us be glad and rejoice give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife hath made herself ready right that's what we do that's our part so brother brandom says about that so many he says that the Lord will take this evil spirit from me from drinking gambling lying stealing I'll Ser him but that's up to you yes sir and and you say well brother Ben I know I know that I should give that up to the Lord that's true but the giving up is what he's talking about yeah right the giving up is what you can do you can't take away the desire for alcohol but you can give it up that's right right you can't take away the desire for cigarettes but you can give it up and let him take it away so he he'll never take it away from you pull it out of your your hands as you grasp for it you've got to give it up surrender it to him and then he'll take it away right and so you got to give it up and that's how we overcome they that overcome he said shall inherit all things they that over come you have power to do it but you must be willing to lay it down see he said she has made herself ready I like that word and again it's not a self-help program but you got to be willing because the Battleground is in the mind right so if you don't want to be depressed all the time you got to be willing to get rid of that but the but peace is here for you salvation is here for you Joy is here for you you don't have to live that way you don't have to remain like that it's here for you but you got be willing to lay it down say Lord I lay it at your feet yes sir right he said you see God cannot push us through a little pipe pull us out on the other end and then say blessed is he that overcometh you had nothing to overcome he just pushed you through but you got to make decisions for yourself I have to make decisions for myself doing that we show our faith and respects to God so we see this weaving through these these young men we see God's purpose and call and election and we see their actions that don't always match that and yet it turns out exactly how God wants it to in the end right right cuz he's got everything in his control so and he knows what we'll do with it now brother BR said Abraham was promised a child but he must maintain that promise for 25 years through the ups and downs and temptations but he held to the word of that promise and Israel was promised a promis land so brother Brown ties these things together he said but they had to fight for every inch of it wherever the The Souls of your foot Treads upon that have I given you God said to Joshua but did you ever think about that and and they're out there walking said oh goody I don't have to fight but they had to walk with a sword in their hand everywhere they stepped God footsteps are possession God gave that to them but they had to fight every devil in hell trying to get them knock them off of that place listen to me Church you God's giv you a land he's giv you healing he's giv you peace he's giv you uh let you sit in Heavenly places in Christ but every devil in hell is going to try to knock you off of that place going to try to make it where you can't worship God no more going to try to make it where you can't come on Church go try to make it where you you don't enjoy church no more and you don't enjoy prayer time no more and you can't you can't read your Bible no more every devil in hell is going to try to get you so wrapped up in drama going around the church or Facebook or something else to try to make it where you don't have time to spend with God but an overcomer will grab a hold of it anyway and say this is my land this is my promise I'm going to live for God good see the land was there God gave it to them but they must fight for it right so that's a principle now you say what does that have to do with Ruben you're going to find out so God has got Amazing Grace to save you and he will do it but you'll fight every inch of your way yes brother BR talked about all how all of his ministry he fought he said but we must if we must reain so we find out the bride has to make herself ready be willing to lay aside every weight does so easily beset us so we might run with patience the race is set before us we must lay them aside ourself yeah we can't say God you come lay them aside for us we got to do that ourselves sir lay it down so he can take it away yeah are you with me now yeah how do we overcome because and we got to have something that these 12 sons that Jacob didn't have come on now in order to live in this age and be with all that God wants us to be be a perfect Bride for the groom perfect in his sight a mature bride we we're going to have to have something else that they they didn't have and that's the new birth right because what they were dealing with is just in the flesh but we have something that overcomes the Flesh and as you yield to the new birth that's what makes you an overcomer look at 1 John 5:4 remember brother Brandon said part of overcoming was humility go listen to how can I overcome part of overcoming is humbling yourself to the word of God it's humility what is that it's it's surrender it's a surrender of self-will and what what you want to do and who you are and say Lord you make me what you want me to be so we overcome differently in that way what we're fighting with many times it's not some some uh listen Church we're not always we're not fighting some website somewhere or or some person or some Doctrine many times what we're fighting is right here right we're fighting a battle right here it's going on right here that's what's trying to keep you out of church that's what's trying to keep you from loving your neighbor that's what's trying to keep you from living the gospel it's right here so you're fighting that you're fighting every day and what are you doing but but the Bible says whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world yeah and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith so it's your faith in God and said I know I can't do it on my own but I can overcome depression because God said so God said he give me peace that passes all understanding and I believe that that promise is mine that part that portion of the word belongs to me yes and I may have been put on a part of the land that has a little extra dose of anxiety but I'm not going to claim that I'm going to over come that devil in my land you get it not everybody's given the same hardships not everybody has the same trials but everybody has the same God sir and whatsoever is born of God overcometh the World by faith good Hallelujah see Reuben had to overcome his Beginnings to be all that he could be and it is possible to overcome even when your name and birth path hinder you right right even when you don't have all the advantages everything the great example that I don't have time to really get into it tonight but it was JZ in the scripture 1 Chronicles chapter 4 the Bible says JZ was more honorable than his Brethren and it really stands out there because just a long list of names just a sea of names and then suddenly the scripture says Jaz was more honorable than his Brethren his mother called his name Jaz because I bury him with sorrow if you look into that name came the sorrow that she's talking about may not have been just physical pain it may have been that there was something that happened and she'd had that baby out uh out of the normal way and and maybe he was born we would say an illegitimate child but the Bible says Jaz didn't let that bother him jabz called on the god of Israel saying oh that thou wouldest bless me indeed and my Coast so in other words I've been given a lot in life his name meant sorrow my lot is sorrowful I've been given this lot but I'm not going to let that stop me so he said it's an interesting prayer enlarge my Coast right let me I don't want somebody else's property but let me take all that God yeah has given me and that thine hand might be with me and that thou would us keep me from Evil that it may not grieve me and God granted him that which he requested see ru had some things to overcome yes Jacob on his deathbed begins to pronounce blessings on his children Genesis 49:3 he said Ruben thou are my firstborn my might the beginning of my strength the excy of dignity and the Excellency of power Ruben is doing pretty good so far well bless the Lord then he says unstable is water that means like boiling water in a pot it's going to come out it's going to spill everywhere if the heat isn't turned down he said Thou shalt not Excel because thou wentest up to thy father's bed thou defil then defil th it he went up to my couch you'll find that mentioned in Genesis 3522 how Jacob had left bethl and while they were were away from the land there's a whole series of sermons in that but while Jacob was away from the land many bad things begin to happen in his family just like when we get out of church get from where God placed us that's right right and and many bad things begin to happen and and Reuben committed a terrible sin during that time and uh went with one of his father's concubines the word unstable is literally froth froth he said you're like boiling water uncontrollable it's a dark moment but I'm thankful it wasn't the end of the story what are you going to do with your dark moments come on now what are you going to do if you make a mistake come on what are you going to do if you make a horrible mistake right he should have had the birth right should have had the blessing should have been the the the main guy yeah but he couldn't be because of what happened what are you going to do with that right you you can give in to that and just become more like that let that overtake your life right but that's not what Reuben did right come on are we going to accept it or press forward forward see and again there's this idea that well I'm predestined so whatever I'm predestined to be is just going to happen and and so I don't need to press but look at the sarop phenician woman that come to Jesus she was a gentile her allotment it wasn't her time yet but her daughter wasn't sick in the future she was sick right then yes right and she come to Jesus and said Jesus how son of David and it wasn't her time yet brother R said he she had no rights to him as son of David yeah and so he said it's not meat for me to take the children's bread healing and give it to dogs Gentiles that well a bunch of us would have left that church walked away but she said I'm not quitting church I'm not giving up on God I'm not giving up on the gospel I'm not giving up on the message because it's hard on me personally but she said Lord she said even the little dogs eat the crumbs that fall from the master's table oh that ought to be our attitude tonight that was Reuben's attitude evidently he was able somehow to overcome this and we'll see that in just a moment so so the we are not defined by the worst thought we ever had yeah or even the worst action we ever took come on church it's what you do with that we may bear the consequence of it we may bear have scars but even a man locked up in prison with a life sentence can think on his ways that's just the truth of it you say well that's just the end then he could never be a Christian maybe the only way some men would ever be a Christian that's right you might say you know and looking at this in Ruben's particular sin I know some of us would look at that and say well you know I don't have that problem praise God I thank God for that I'm not like but i' I'd never do that but the Bible says all these things happened unto them for examples and they are written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall Reuben was a type of something this is real important I just love the word of God how it all fits together in Numbers Chapter 2 and verse 10 the Bible tells us that the standard of Reuben would be on the south side of the camp and I think I have a a picture of the camp on there and if you look at the camp you'll see Reuben on the south side and his standard I don't know if you can see that but it's the face of a man so Reuben's standard is the face of a man remember the four living creatures in Ezekiel the four living creatures in Revelation there's a lion an ox a man and an eagle right and that was the four powers the four the guard of the throne Matthew Mark Luke and John right the type well if you look at the way the the camp was constructed Reuben was the head of three tribes of GAD Simeon and Reuben on the south side and his his uh his identification was a man now brother brandom tells us I just love how brother brand will drop in a nugget like this he said now the Reuben was the man he was the first one the first of Jacob's 12 sons the weakest one of the bunch right he was the man he see look a son right but he was a man he was a man obviously he was a man but what does that tell us he's flesh he thinks flesh he's carnal right and and he's a good type of a carnal believer that's why we need the Holy Ghost are you with me now yes right so so he's ruled by his passions he's run by the flesh that's what brother BR tells us here he said he's the weakest one of the bunch he said didn't Jacob say so in Genesis 49 Reuben Thou Art the first of my strength but like water you went up on my couch defile my couch live with his father's concubine he said see that's the immorals of the human being oh that'll never happen to me he said that's Humanity that's Humanity sir oh I thank God for Grace yes he said you see the animals don't have them the immorals the lion none of these things has that but the man did so part of overcoming is realizing that you are flesh you are a man Reuben you're a man and if you don't learn to turn down the heat your passions will boil over and destroy you there got to be something that controls that so A man is made in such a way that only the new birth will completely control that so it's why so many great men in the Old Testament fall in that way David was a man Samson was a man just doing what men do right but why because they were also men of God we look at it and say well look but there were many men who acted like that they were just acting like men acted but they were also supposed to be men of God and Men of God aren't supposed to act like that Christians aren't supposed to act like that so brother brandom talks about a lady coming down the street twisting herself and a curly-headed young man he said was a preacher was watching ing her and he said that man would look and lust and he said there's nothing there to hold him from doing that he just does it it's just the way men the people do now and the women the women dressed in a way to make a man do that he said and a man will do it they just do it but he said A man was born again now he'll still have thoughts he's a human being but he looks to the Cross he has to fight but if he keeps his eye on Calvary he can win that fight amen and some of us were born with a little extra passion a little extra flesh if I can say it that way a little extra tune to that and and and maybe the potential for that when maybe another man wouldn't fight that he'd fight something else but most men I'd say fight that but we don't have to live immorally just because we're men come on church at least the sisters ought to say Amen right because because we got something that'll hold us what he say you overcome by the new birth and 1 John 2:1 said my children these things right unto you that you sin not and if any man sin I'm so glad that yes we can make mistakes yes we can cater to the flesh even ask me listen don't you tell me you can't fall right because let him that think if he standing to take he lest he fall and I remember years ago you know sermons will stick with you things people say for years and I was sitting here as a 16 or 17 year old boy but Aaron McGary was standing behind this pulpit and he made the statement he said if you think he said he said people say well he wasn't really standing he said well if he thinks he's saying uh wherefore let him to think if he say take heed lest he fall he said he had to be sing or he couldn't fall that's right makes sense doesn't it right so he's a Christian but he might fall but you can't fall away right right God's got you he's going to bring you back oh I'm glad for the grace of God why we have an atonement a propitiation don't don't get don't let that ruin your life don't let that be the story of your life because you made a mistake but he is the propitiation aren't you glad for that for our sins and not for ours only but also for the sins of the world listen we are 16 elements of dirt in Ecclesiastes 12:7 it said then shall the dust return to the Earth as it was and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it that's our flesh Dust We Are to dust we shall return your flesh as far as your flesh but the B said it's no different from a horse or from a cow or anything else it's still just flesh he said boy you glorify the flesh but that Spirit has a soul in there my brother he said that's right but your flesh is just dust of the earth like the animal your flesh is no more than an animal and if you lust after the Flesh and the thing you see lust after women lust after all these different things it's still animal that's right you shouldn't do it he said the spirit of God will lead you on put you on a higher plane than that oh I say let's all come up to a higher plane let's let's come up above that we're living in an age where we can if that'll always be a battle we have to fight right I don't say that to condemn someone who's Fallen I say that to give you courage step back to the plate if you fall get back up repent but aim for for higher things in 1 Chronicles 51 it says now the sons of Ruben the firstborn of Israel for he was the firstborn but for as much as he defiled his father's bed so there were ramifications for what he did he said his Birthright was given to the sons of Joseph the son of Israel genealogy is not to be reckoned after the birthright so he's saying that it don't match the birthright don't match to genealogy because of what happened right he said for Judah prevailed above his Brethren and out of him came the chief ruler but the birthright was Joseph's right so there was Joseph had the birthright Judah out of him come the chief ruler but it should have been or we would have thought that it should have been Reuben but man's choice not always God's choice so if you go back in the scripture and again I love how it all ties together you remember there there there there's two men named Dayan and aam you remember them if you haven't read the scripture maybe you've watched the movie you know Dayan was a real squirly guy on the on the Ten Commandments movie you know he just kind of I'm sure you've all your good all us good message kids have seen that movie you know we uh uh I always thought Dayan was the best you know the best actor on that movie but but Dayan and abam were against Moses remember they come under Kora Kora was a levite Dayan and abam were reubenites and the Bible points that out to us that they were of the tribe of Reuben and so you can see that there's something there that them being direct descendants I believe they were grandchildren great-grandchildren of Reuben is found in De Deuteronomy 11:6 that the Earth swallowed them up with their families intents because they refused to come out when Moses told them to come out and they said who who made you a prince over us right now because they were from the first family they were from the ones who should have been the ones that ruled everything huh are you with me now God don't just give things like that that's not how he does it we we listen to me church we he knows who to elect to what position and who to put in what place he knows and he does it for a reason God already knew that Judah out of Judah would come David and and out of that lineage would come Christ God already knew that Joseph would get the birth right he already knew that and he wasn't he wasn't uh surprised when Reuben fell but yet Reuben again it wasn't the end of the story for Reuben we like to treat Our Heroes as if our heroes never do wrong and the bad guys never do right come on you've all seen The Lone Ranger this is going to be movie reference nights you know maybe you heard the radio show Lone Ranger could never do anything wrong he could shoot people they wouldn't die L Ranger never did wrong and the bad guys butcher City whoever was never did anything right but that's not the the true story of humanity even the best of us have two dogs fighting in us one good and one bad yes the one we cater to the most is the one who wins right now it's it's fascinating because I we've already touched on this in the story of Joseph but it was Reuben who tried to get Joseph out of the pit you remember that in Genesis 37:21 it said when they were conspiring to put Joseph to death it said Ruben heard it now of all the people that should have wanted Joseph dead Reuben should have been the one that wanted him dead because he was the firstborn but he didn't want him dead he delivered him he was the only one who said let's not kill him right yeah let's not kill him oh my and in verse 22 Reuben said unto them shed no blood but cast him into this pit is in the wilderness lay no hand upon him he may read him out of their hands so the Bible's giving us Insight that Reuben was going to sneak back there and get him out of the pit you remember later Reuben comes back and Joseph's not there because they sold him into slavery and later on when they go down there into the and and they find Joseph they don't know who he is and Joseph begin to speak very harshly to them and Reuben tells his brothers he said this is what happens this is because of Joseph not even knowing Joseph was standing there listening to him right right but he still had that on his conscience yeah come on right but you think well Reuben's all bad no he's not yeah it's Ruben overcoming come on church every one of us have to overcome something it's Reuben overcoming of all Jacob's sons he should have been the one who wanted Joseph dead but he stood in the gap for Joseph Moses knew that God saw it and when Moses pronounced the blessing in Deuteronomy chapter 33 over each tribe look what he says look how different the blessing is now he said let Reuben live hallelujah oh we always want to pronounce a death sentence on people but that's not the end of the story let Reuben live live and not die let not his men Be Few what's he saying he he recognized if you show Mercy Mercy will be returned to you that's right and God had a plan for reuben reuben ended up and we actually that's just fabulous to me we can just dwell on that all night but Reuben the tribe of Reuben now after Reuben passes away ended up not going all the way into the promised land along with a couple other tribes we'll deal with that again because it's very involved but I want to get into a little bit of that here as we have just a few more minutes before we close now the Bible says that when they come to the land they come up to the Jordan towards the Jordan Reuben had been blessed with to be Cowboys right Reuben the the PE children of Reuben were Cowboys the reubenites they had cattle and they noticed that it was a great flat plane right it was it was real nice for cattle and so uh you find in in Numbers chapter 32 when they saw the land of Jer said they had a very great multitude of cattle they were successful Cowboys and it says that behold the place was a place for cattle and again remember Reuben is the face of a man look a boy right look a sun a sun I hope I'm not stretching this so far that you can't see it but uh look it's it's he's under the that that uh the idea Reuben and you'll find this he always does what's best for himself what's best for materially and so they looked at it that way and they said well let's why don't we just stay here and Moses does an interesting thing You' have thought of all people Moses said no don't stop short you're almost there look that for 40 years yeah they talked about going into a land flowing with milk and honey and they get right to the edge of it and they said hey let's stay here right it sounds like some some of us get right to the edge of it right to the time of the Rapture right to the end time and they said well you know we're pretty comfortable here in Leia stay right here not cross over into the opening of the word not cross over into the things of God but now look and there's ramifications for that Moses told him said you can stay he said but you have to fight with us so they went and they did that and they performed honorably in in the in the land in the battles but there was always a division between them and the other tribes because they didn't go on over and let me say this whenever there's whenever you cater to carnality there will always be division oh my right because now you you've catered to the Flesh and you stayed on the outside of the full promise of God and now there's Division and it affects how you fight yeah because they went that time but after they lived in the land for a while you'll find some things begin to happen uh brother Brown said they did not fully come into the love of God's word that ought sober us up tonight they didn't fully come into the love of God's word so in in Joshua 22 they built an altar because they did want their kids to know that they were they were doing it right they they wanted their kids to know that they were Israelites even though the rest of Israel was going on over they knew they would be separated from the tribe but the rest of the tribes took offense to it and they and and and you'll find it was almost a war and it had to be talked out and finally The Diplomatic uh people got together and War was averted you'll find during the time of Deborah and baric and you can go find all of these things in the scriptures in Judges chapter 5 you'll find that during the time of the Prophet us Deborah and the and the General baric Barack Reuben was one who refused to come out and fight yeah why he was on the other side of Jordan he had all his cattle or by this time sheep because in judges 5:16 said why B us down among the sheepfolds to hear the bleedings of the flocks for the divisions of Reuben there were great searchings of heart so in other words they couldn't just follow when the trumpet sounded when Barack went and sounded a trumpet and said everybody come let's make war yeah against the Invaders of the land Ruben couldn't follow because they had to think about it well I got a job I got this I got that I got the other on right it's important we want to go all the way in we want to love the word with all of our heart yes and you find out later and again we'll maybe get back into this some other time but they they began by hting C cattle and they were shepherds by the time of the New Testament they kept Hogs yeah on the other side the ones that Jesus were Legion was on that Jesus went to but I want you to see tonight before we close that God is faithful yes amen see now when they come into the land of promise the land of promise is not the Millennium it wasn't the perfect place it was the place to fight it was a type of the Holy Ghost right type of the opening of the word a type of the land where all the promises lay and and so that's where we are is in the land we're we're we're we're in there and we got to fight but it's not a type of the Millennium because in the Millennium all wrongs are made right so if you go and look in Ezekiel and find Ezekiel and I don't have a map I don't think with me well I have a map of ezekiel's but not the original map you'll find that in the original land remember Moses allowed them to stay completely on one side of Jordan but when Ezekiel sees the tribes in order in the Millennium he doesn't see it that way he sees every tribe given an equal amount right the the map looks completely different I want you to understand something tonight many times we're placed where we are to fight to develop character to to to be what God wants us to be and God will place you maybe in a land where there's lots of sickness or in a land where there's lots of Heartache or in a land where you got to fight uh uh lust maybe or a land where you got to fight uh uh anxiety or depression God allows you to live there yes but he's not going to leave you there forever come on there is a place all right your new body won't fight with anxiety in your new body Church you won't you won't have to suffer with sickness in your new body you won't you you won't be placed there sir here you fight that but over there you don't right and in the Millennium listen in Ezekiel 486 by the border of Ephraim from the East side to the west side a portion for Reuben right in the middle right in the promised land oh Church oh my brother brandham gives an answer about a wife who refused to serve the Lord it's a very interesting answer because brother brandham said told this man said if you have the wrong one now you'll have the right one you remember the answer you'll be given the right one in the Millennium and that's that's kind of a strange statement but this proves that scripturally think about it because whatever tribe maybe ended up not taking all their land or or not becoming all that they could have been or staying on the wrong side of Jordan but in the Millennium that's good they come back into their place that's good now look what does that mean brother man makes this statement he said you just keep on going all wrong someone say it with me all wrongs will be made right there you live with your scars here but your scars go away there good Hallelujah you live with the shame here but the shame goes away there you live baby with diminished possibilities and and maybe even a diminished freedom of movement here but not over there over there if you're a child of God no matter what you did here because you're going back to God's original thought you're not you're not going to a land where you're going to fight anymore but you're going to a land of Freedom you're going to a land where God what God had purposed in his mind for you from the foundation of the world where you are now is your fighting position but over there all maps are redrawn y are you with me so far I'm almost ready to close that's why Moses didn't just make them go on into the land I'm coming to something they were pre-ordained to be in their in in place you said well they chose to be and it was a mistake yes it was the permissive will of God yes but they were supposed to be there yeah now look they were actually there were actually tribes that were supposed to be on the wrong side of the river I know that blows our minds but God puts everything the way he wants it right good I'm not just making this up brother brand said he has a permissive will he said now there's what the trouble lays we try to work on God's permissive will and he will permit it he said but also if we take his permissive will though it's not right we should never do that but he said though it's not right he will make his permissive will to work out together to glorify his perfect will that ought give some of us faith in Courage and hope and though we may not have done it right I've only heard one person ever I just use this as an analogy because we got some young people but I've only heard one person ever say that they did everything right during their dating period or their courtship and I have ever since then I've had to struggle with a thought that maybe they were a liar just just how that just keeps coming to me you know I know some of y'all brother Stewart probably did everything right you know but I didn't most of us didn't and that's not a license to do thing we want the perfect will of God marriage goes so much better God saved me from a lot of things my own stupidity are you with me now JT said he did he remembers me it's a voice of knowledge back there God saved me from that I'm I'm saying this to to help you because yeah you'll make a mistake get up huh keep going he says wrongs will be made right over there you can't do nothing about it why wallow in your tears why spend the rest of your life defensive about it just let God take care put it in the hands of God and if you have an opportunity to do good like Reuben did do it yes if you have an opportunity to show Mercy to somebody else because of what you've been through do it you never know what God might do for you yes the say each the land was provided and divvied up by inspiration and each one he said I could take the scriptures and show it to you exactly that he put them in the place where they were supposed to be positionally listen I know some of y'all doubted me on this look what he says how that the two half tribes was to stay across the river yeah some tribes were meant to be across the river how that their mothers CED that in their birth how that each place was supposed to be he had it all in control to begin with he said now after you're in that don't mean that you're out free from war right you still have to fight those of you who have crossed over those of you who have a love for the word you still have to fight for every inch of ground you stand on so see Canaan did not represent the great Heaven because it's war and troubles and killings and fightings and so forth but it did represent this that it must be a perfect walk he said a perfect walk because he said Joshua was never defeated until achen took his wedge of gold and hid it so we got to walk before God with a perfect heart and a perfect heart just saying Lord whatever is wrong with me take it out of me cleanse me oh God know my heart know the inside of me I want to be right if I do so I quickly repent I'm not going to hide it I'm not going to grab a hold of idolatry I'm going to live for you I'm going to do what's right oh church I'm so glad that there's a perfect walk that we can walk maybe not perfect in the eyes of men but in the eyes of God but now watch we can't watch what everybody else is doing you can't look over your shoulder at somebody else's alotment saying and despising them because they're on the wrong side of the river you just take care of your own plot of land and take care of your own corn don't look at over say well that other Church they do it a different way let's do it the way God wants us to do it for this season for this time for such a time as this are you with me tonight let's let's do what God called us to do said well everybody else does it a certain way that don't mean we have to do it that way let's do it according to the word we want the perfect will of God but if you make a mistake if you stumble there is an advocate propitiation made for you God puts them there for a reason God put you here for a reason though you may be in a difficult land it was a very difficult place for them to be because they were the very first tribe to be invaded every time there was an invasion Reuben was invaded first and the first one to be lost from history was Reuben but that's somehow God meant for that or he knew that would take place he put them in the spot that they could live in they could raise cattle in listen we were born in sin by his permissive will do you know that every one of us are here by permissive will unless your parents spoke you into exist existence and I don't think I think they did every one of us are born by permissive will but we are born again by perfect will because the perfect one came died on a cross for our sins musicians go ahead and come I'm so glad he came we were born again by perfect will no matter what your past was no matter what you were you were born again to sit in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus to fellowship with one another to love one another to have a perfect walk how many would like to say let let me have that perfect walk with you would you say that amen I don't know if we know that let me walk with you Jes can we stand together let me walk with you Jesus let me be in your perfect will Lord can we just bow our heads together just pray that way Heavenly Father we want your perfect will we want it for our children for our families and yet we realize we live in an imp perfect world we're here by permissive will and yet there's a part of us it's Eternal if if not we couldn't hear the call of the message come out of her my people be not partake her of her plagues we've heard it and obeyed it because there's something on the inside of us calls for a better land a place where our allotment will be set right Lord where everything's fair and equal and oh we thankful for that but Lord while we're here some may have a big land some little some may have more trouble than others some may struggle more than others but oh God help us not to give up but to fight in the land that you placed Us in fight in the family that you placed Us in fight in the church that you placed Us in Lord to be a part and to help do all that we can do oh I pray you grant it Lord we thank you for your word and say a blessing to us Lord help us to show Mercy to obtain Mercy help us to move forward to overcome we've done something wrong to not let that be the story of our life but to press on I pray you grant it Lord we thank you we thank you for your protection I thank you Lord I Thank you for all that you've done for me thank you for what you've done for
