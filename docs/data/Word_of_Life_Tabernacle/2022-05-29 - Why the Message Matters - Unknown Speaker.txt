believe he loves you today man god bless you can be seated just for a moment and then we'll go to the word in just a minute i just wanted to talk to you for a minute we've been gone on vacation for a few days i guess it's a vacation when you take your kids to branson that's not much of a vacation but for us but that's what we did and it was a vacation for the children anyway they got out of school and were able to uh to go and do that and so i'm sure they enjoyed it and i did too just getting away sometimes you need to take a service off and i'm so thankful to have ministry here that we can trust to be able to come and and take care of the services and so we appreciate that but we're back in the saddle now and we've got some several things coming up uh i know there's several gone this morning and some of them have good excuses and some of them are on vacation so but uh i can't say much can't i because we just come off but uh it's kind of that weekend so we'll only have one service today uh but uh but joe i can't figure out when you're gonna be gone and when you're gonna be here so i'm just gonna assume brother joe's gonna be here until further notice i i've been thinking he's gonna be gone for the last month and he always shows up it's like a bad penny so we're uh we're happy to have brother joe and it's always good to see uh each one of you and i miss you when you're not here and i'm sure you miss me as well so we appreciate you being here but those that aren't here i know several of them on vacation to different things and they schedule that every year and that that's a blessing to be able to spend some time with your family but it's also a blessing to be together and spend time in the word but tuesday night if you're not here and you're listening our service this week will be on tuesday night instead of wednesday so everybody's got that tuesday night brother andrew glover is going to be here and so you won't want to miss that maybe you're not usually able to come on wednesdays but if you just find a way uh to be here on wednesday or tuesday night that would be a wonderful a wonderful thing and so he'll be here on tuesday night i know we don't like change but that won't be permanent just this week we'll do that and to accommodate his schedule i try to have brother andrew in a like a lot he's been a a buddy to me and a great help here to the church and we sure appreciate our brother andrew glover i know you'll enjoy him uh brother jason jackson is having his meetings this week this coming this month i guess all month but they're having the the main part of that will be this weekend so brother danny steeman will be there on friday and saturday nights and if you get a chance to go there and i know they support us we have meetings if you get a chance to go and hear brother danny steeman i'm sure that will be a blessing to you as well this sunday morning brother john baduca is in back in town and you all heard him last year he's going to be with us sunday morning uh he'll be with spending a few days with me before we take him back to the airport to go back to africa so he'll be here sunday morning and then i'm going to take the sunday afternoon service and we'll have communion on sunday afternoon so everybody remember that and be praying about that communion on sunday night i believe that's the first sunday of the month will be it will be this coming weekend so be praying about that and then we'll also have our men's prayer meeting uh our regular men's prayer meeting on saturday morning and so we'll do that and then we're just looking forward to a good time in the lord y'all be praying with me we're gearing up for a trip to egypt uh the first part of july and then our meetings will be coming up in the middle of july and between now and then we've got a lot of services to make good use of and and to see the power of god move in our midst somebody want to see that see the spirit of the lord just fall among us and so it's an exciting time and said brother ben why are you so busy what are you trying to do because the lord is coming we don't have very long say well they've been saying that for years but i believe it today he said occupy till i come so we're going to occupy until he comes we're going to stay busy and keep doing what we can for the kingdom of god amen let's stand together and we'll read from john chapter 1 and verse 10 actually verses 10 through 12 and then romans 12 1 and 2. john chapter 1 verses 10 and 11 or 10 through 12 and romans 12 1 and 2 it says he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not can you imagine coming to your own creation and not being known by that was our god he came unto his own his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name amen romans chapter 12 and verse 1 he said i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be transformed so there's a power on the earth today that can transform you not just conform to the world but transform by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god in other words that that will could be manifested in our lives i pray that it would be so let's bow our heads together heavenly father we're so thankful to be in your presence again today and art as we think about this memorial day weekend and how we have a memory lord of those that have gone on especially those who have fought and have died for political freedom or today we also remember you and what you did for us there on the cross and how lord that you died for our freedom and so we could have our freedom in the spirit today lord and that you would come not only that you died for us but that you poured your spirit out upon us on the day of pentecost so that we could be become a tree of life a bride tree that could grow up lord we're so thankful for that today we're so thankful for these people that have gathered together i pray that you'd move in each and every life and every heart lord though there's just a smaller than usual number lord this morning yet we believe that you're still god would you just come and meet us here today lord just be with us throughout this day and we'll give you all the praise and the glory and the honor in jesus name amen amen god bless you you can be seated thank you for bearing with me i heard a story of a judge who'd been frequently ridiculed by a conceited lawyer and he was asked by a friend why he didn't ever rebuke him and he said this he said you know in our town there's a widow woman who has a dog and whenever the moon shines the dog goes outside and barks all night and he just started talking about something else and the man finally asked that judge said what about the dog and the moon you never finished the story he said oh he said the moon went on shining and and so sometimes it doesn't do a whole lot of good to respond to critics because we're the moon we're the reflection of jesus christ on the earth this message has many critics and as the lord began to put this on my heart this week as we were gone i began to think about it and i didn't really understand why i was moving in this direction this morning but i found out uh later in the week that there was a a number of people in west tennessee that have been affected and what they've been doing is people who don't believe the message have been targeting churches and pastors and they'll take a pastor's videos and they'll take them and splice them together that make it seem like he's harsh or or saying something that wouldn't be politically correct and then they'll they'll start mailing and calling each member of the church actually find out who the members are and these are people who used to be in the message and have become disaffected and they've done that in a couple of churches in west tennessee and they've been getting around to the people and trying to make them so doubt in the people's minds about the message of the hour and not knowing that but the lord had begun to lay this on my heart that why the message matters why does it matter we we're going to have critics there's going to be people who will tell you that well we should just move beyond that we don't need the message anymore we we can say the things brother branham said but we'll just leave that out of it we don't want to offend nobody we don't want to we don't want to push people into thinking or some kind of a cult or something like that but the truth is they're always going to think that it's just always going to be that way but the message still matters today there's always going to be critics john 15 and 19 jesus speaking to his disciples he said if you were of the world the world would love its own there there's a reason why they don't love us because we're not of the world he said but because you're not of the world but i have chosen you out of the world therefore the world hates you you want to know why the world doesn't like christians you don't want to know why the world doesn't like message believers specifically you want to know why especially the world doesn't like those who live it those who really live it not just say it but live it the world don't like you because you're not of them and it's evident and the farther we go along the lines get farther and farther away of what a christian looks like and what a christian acts like compared to what the world is and i'll be honest with you i don't want it there to be any mix-up i don't want to be anything like the world we're at the end time there's a group that's going up and there's a group that's staying here i don't want to be the group that stays here you say well i could be a foolish virgin well there will be many who will be saved through the tribulation period but i'll be honest with you i don't want to go through the tribulation period have you read the book of revelation have you read some of the things that are coming on the earth i don't want anything to do with that i don't want my kids to have anything to do with that i don't want to be a part of that i want to be a member of the bride i want to be one that's got his robes washed and white and been given a white robe i want to be one of those i want to be one of them and so and so i don't care what the world thinks in that way yes we want to we want to do everything we can to make sure that we're the faults are not our own that we're not being criticized because if they criticize you peter said for the things that you do then you were you you deserved it right but if they criticized you for the word's sake then you just go on because you know they criticized him too amen so in john 15 21 he says but all these things will they do unto you why for my name's sake because they know not him that sent me amen oh my they they don't hate the message because they because they hate because they hate us necessarily they hate the message because they hate him they don't even realize they don't know him they didn't know him when he came they know not him that sent me and so we'll be asked the question does the message of uh that we call the message of the hour or we can say the message of william branham which it's really not it's the message of christ and we'll go into that but does it still matter is it outdated why did we need it in the first place and we've addressed some of those things before so i won't go over it in a comprehensive way this morning but these are questions that will be asked and the message matters and the reason the the main reason that the message matters is because the message is christ the message is christ and so brother madam tells us that in the token he said we're not come together to talk about the message right it's not just something we talk about we're come to get in the message right and the message is christ he is the word so we're not talking about just the messages not books and tapes literal books and tapes the message is not a symbol or a picture or even a person in the sense of a person of the earth but the message is the person of christ and he is the word so now brother branham said look what we've seen in this day the quickening power has come to us aren't you glad for that quickening power you know what that means that's not difficult to understand the power that makes you alive to be quicker than the scripture means to be alive when you're alive you're not dead yes well that's deep isn't it when you're alive you you you have movement yes right you're not sitting there like a bump on a log you got movement when you're alive the quickening power has come to us amen that's what this message is it's not word only it's not just a legalistic reading of the word but it's alive it's alive it's powerful it's able to quicken it's able to discern the thoughts and intents of the heart the quickening power has come to us to open the seven seals he said what was that he said the intelligence of a man no the quickening power of god he said see the quickening power of god foretold this would take place the quickening power of god made the world testify to it now he's talking now about the cloud and that's where much of the criticism comes from is the cloud and the cloud to me is very simple who's picked whose face was it right it was christ that's what it was it represented something and it's not about you say well did this happen on a certain day or what that's not what it was about brother branham didn't even know it when it happened right but months later he comes and gets a picture of it and the angel the lord said turn it to the right and when he turned it he saw whose face it was so it meant something to us they saw it and it didn't mean anything to him right right but brother branham didn't see it in his group and yet he knew something had happened he was there when the angels came to him but he didn't see the cloud but then that when he saw it in the picture of it he knew what it was amen so no we're not we're not i'm not interested in a discussion about who was on what day and all of those things because that's not what it's about right you're mistaking what it's about it wasn't about brother branham and when he was hunting right it's about christ it's a sign that the quickening power came to open the seals he said the quickening power of god made the world testify to it that it's the truth the angel of the lord i told you was around in a pillar of fire quickening power that the world testifies the truth he said what does that mean to me well if the pillar of fire was around then and the people couldn't see it it's around today the pillar of fire hasn't left the earth it can't leave the earth if at least that means the holy ghost is gone right and so the pillar of fire is still here today why did god let us see it why do you why did he allow the picture to be taken why did he allow the cloud to be formed the way that it was however it was formed he allowed it to be that way why did god allow it oh my he allowed it because he knew there would be a people on the earth that needed to know that christ is here that you would face such a difficult time that you would face the end of all times when the tribulation was coming off he knew there would be a people on the earth who would be so persecuted and so afflicted and the mental battle would be so strong he knew there would be a people that needed to see that jesus was still alive oh do you believe it today do you believe he's still alive he's the same yesterday today and forever amen he he said we knew he said i told you it was around in a pillar of fire quickening power let the world testify that it's the truth and in that they didn't know what it was but we knew just look this away it's our lord up there amen he is the one he said who opened those seals he goes further he said he is those seals yes sir yes he is those seals why because the seals on the book the book was him and the book was us because we're part of him does that make sense the book was him and the book was us because it's part of him the book was the word he was the word we are the word if we're a part of him not this flesh but the inner man the flesh will never be saved but the inner man is amen the inner man comes and takes control amen becomes the control tower of the flesh now he said they didn't know what it was but we knew he said he's the one who opened those fields he is those seals for the whole word of god is christ and christ is the seals that was opened you realize why the message matters christ is the seals that was open yes you want to fight and quibble about what dates if brother ben have told a story one way and then told it another way i've told some stories here several different ways since i've been here you know why because i'm human sometimes i told a story here one day and i walked outside and my wife said you got that wrong it was a story about her and i got some of the details wrong but i was trying to make a point with it yeah and the point was well made i might add all right but i didn't get all the details right because i'm human yeah if you want to come and send me something in the mail and come and tell me and build a website tell me brother brandon was human you didn't have to do that i already knew that yeah tell me that he was a preacher like i am i know what it's like to be a preacher and to be tired and stumble over your words and i know what it's like to not be able to speak eloquently but i also know what it's like when the power of god comes down and you know it's not you speaking but it's god's speaking and he was a prophet even above even just a regular ministry he had a ministry that he heard direct from god like moses flipped to ear yes i'll listen to that yes yes right so now he's the one he is those seals the whole word of god is christ and christ is the seal that was open and so what is the opening of seals then revealing christ amen he said in the very seven angels which represented the seven churches all completed he said and we couldn't even see it they did they took the picture not us and there he is standing there supreme judge showing that he is alpha and omega the beginning and the end oh my listen it's christ yeah it's not about a man right it's not about men it's not about a bunch of preachers it's not about a bunch of just a bunch of people but it's about christ christ in a man christ in the people you understand now he said i wasn't the one that appeared down on the river i was only standing there when he appeared oh i love the way the prophet put it he said i'm not the one that performs these things and foretells these things it happens as perfect as they are he said i'm only one that's near when he does it oh my all the other all the other ministries healing ministries of that day would say come see the man of the hour come see the anointed man of god who's able to speak and and able to discern and able to do all of these things and here come a man with a true gift who come out and said it's not me i'm completely helpless until he shows up yes sir oh we would learn a lot from following that from imitating that example yes we we're completely helpless until he shows up many times we mess things up and i've often found i'm finding more and more as you counsel with people about what should i do what should i do well many times the best thing to do is not to do does that make sense the best thing to do is not to do not to not because you start messing stuff up many times what you ought to do is just sit back and wait and see what god does and then follow the word and god will lead you he said he'll put he said don't think about what you're going to say don't stress about it don't don't be anxious about it say well how will i speak to my children how will i talk to those around me about the message of the hour don't overthink it don't stress it you just live your life out in front of them and there will be an opportunity one day that you can begin to speak life into their hearts that's right because god wants to move through you you don't want to just move through a prophet but he come and showed us what you were able to do what who you are that you could speak and god would begin to honor your word but you can't do that if you're just all the time working for yourself jesus goes down through a crowd there's 5 000 people and he's he goes through this crowd and here are the the lame and the halt and the wizard thousands of people all of them sick because they're trying to get into the pool that's a disappointing way healing meeting think about it one person got healed every time the angel moved we don't even hear how often the angel moved it may not have been every day i don't believe there's it says how often it moved it just at certain times the angel would trouble the water and here they come one person whoever was quickest to get in so if you were lame or didn't have anybody to help you in or like the man with the maybe a prostate condition or something was just weak he was unable to get to the water in time so he laid there for year after year month after month year after year waiting on a moving in the water and jesus walks into that he don't go through and start making making a prayer line bringing everybody up and healing this one and healing that one but he was led by the father there was one laying there that he would speak to he didn't go to the worst case for the best case and sometimes we have to do things the best we can but the way jesus did it so he was perfectly led by the father to that one person aren't you glad that the word was perfectly led by the father to you and your condition to you and your family to you and your situation oh that ought to be enough to make a shout this morning that the word would come down into my world and speak directly to me i see myself in that sea of people i see myself like that here it comes being directed to me and i can't explain it it's all grace i can't i can't make it happen i can't call him down here he come and he said do you believe if you believe pick up your bed and walk do you want to be well and when he said it there was something inside the man said yes i believe i want to be well and when he said it there was something inside of you a seed from the foundation of the world that said yes i want to be well i believe hey man it wasn't brother branham that's the way he operated it wasn't it wasn't just brother branham doing and because sometimes when brother brown just did things he he made mistakes like we all do but when it was the father leading him yes that's why he was so careful not to just do what preachers wanted him to do right yes because the father led him we all need that leadership yeah god gives us human leadership but we need the leadership of the father beyond that because many times the human leadership will fail yes that's right he said brother brandon said i'm not the one that performs those things i'm only one that's near when he does it i was only a voice that he used to say it amen it wasn't what i knew it's what i just surrendered myself to that he spoke through it isn't me it wasn't the seventh angel oh no it was the manifestation of the son of man not the manifestation of the seventh oh that's so key not the manifestation of the seventh angel he wasn't manifesting himself or his own ministry he was manifesting the son of man amen he said the son of man is christ he's the one that you're feeding on you're not feeding on a man we're feeding this morning we're feeding yes you want to know why we're happy i love that old song can't you see why i'm happy i've been eating at the buffet yeah i've got a full seven course meal that's why i could be excited that's why my kids i want my kids to understand he said brother ben this is above the level of the kids no it's not no it's not they can understand that the lamb died for their sins they can understand that the seals have been open and the book is a new book and they can have that same excitement that same i know it's not about the excitement but even our children ought to be able to get into it to the point where they believe it where there's a quickening power that comes to them and they say lord i believe it i may not understand it all but i believe it that quickening power can come to our children to our grandchildren to the people around us he's the word and that word quickens it makes you live yes hey man we're not feeding on a man if we were feeding on a man we could just make it a we'd make it a school and and teach everybody theology but we're not feeding on a man his words will fail oh my but you're feeding on the unfailing unfailing what does that mean unfailing it means it will go to its intended purpose the word of god will not fall to the ground he said my words will not become void if god said there would be a bride there will be a bride he's we're feeding on the unfailing i could just stop there and preach for a while the unfailing body word of the son of man i'm not going to sit and parse the prophet's word and say well this you know he wasn't right about this he wasn't right about that i'm just going to believe that what i'm feeding on yes i ate chicken you know i i like chicken with a bone in it it flavors it flavors the chicken it's not dry chicken with the bone in it it's good even pork with the bone in it by the way is good if there's something about the bone in a season but you don't need the bone but you don't sit there worry about it either you're not feeding on the humanity you're not feeding on that oh i can't listen to it it's got bone in it no feed on the feed on the chicken i feed on the unfailing body word of the son of man feed on the fresh kill you don't feed on the word on the on every mannerism and everything well i gotta walk like he walked i gotta i gotta say amen like he did that's not what we're feeding on we're feeding on the body word of the son of man right more than a man it's christ now he is the word let me say amen to that today let's turn to john chapter 1 and verse 1 and we'll begin reading there and i just want to read this now in this light does the message matter does the message matter and we believe that it does and so now john 1 1 in the beginning was the word and the word the logos which is speech or a voice the word was with god and the word was god the same how do you get past that the word was god it wasn't a second person it was god the same was in the beginning with god all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made amen he is the creator amen in him was life and the life i love it life it animates you you're not dead yes god won't ever stand still for a dead church that's right right i hope you're hearing me today there's got to be life it may not be all super emotional running the aisles but there's going to be life yes there's got to be life yes if there's no life if i don't care about what i'm saying why would you care if you don't care about it why do we come to church i don't get up here and spit because it makes me feel good to do it i don't get up here and yell at you you know because it just there's probably more proper ways to speak but he chose the foolishness of preaching to display not just to not just to say the words but to demonstrate by the power of the gospel so that not only the words could be said but the sick could be healed and the blind could see and the dead could be raised and people could be put in a rapture condition god chose to do it that way because in him was life yes and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not in other words the darkness never becomes light it's always darkness it gets pushed back by the light but it's always darkness verse six there was a man sent from god whose name was gone well wait i thought we were talking about the godhead yeah now think about it he comes back he goes through the verse one down through verse six and he comes back to the godhead later but now he's going to talk about john now think about it for a moment john was not the godhead he's going to explain it he was not the word the logos right but he was a man sent from god he was not god but he was a man sent from god now why would we need to know about john when we're talking about jesus and you remember john is saying in the spiritual the same thing that matthew and mark and luke said in the natural how that they told the story of jesus birth and so now they told his natural birth remember they would go down through the genealogy matthew especially goes all the way through the genealogy it shows that jesus is the son of david and talks about how he's a rightful king that comes on the earth the lion matthew chose that and mark shows what he shows and luke shows his luke goes into the manner of his birth and shows how he's a man and all these things but now we come down into john and john takes it from a spiritual supernatural level and he shows the god part and said this is how i use god this is his lineage right and so now the light is shining in darkness how is he going to shine how is he going to announce his arrival amen how's he gonna do it there was a man sent from god yes all right so if he's gonna come a second time yeah are you with me now he came the first time how's he gonna announce his arrival he didn't announce it with a brass band he didn't announce it with a with a great kind of circus going on in a great theatrical production how did he announce it a man come out of the wilderness the spirit with the spirit and power of elijah come out of the wilderness with a with with even locusts and wild honey a man of the wilderness walked out and began to preach on the women yeah that's what he did he went to herod he said it's not right for you to have her yes and he was rejected by the people of that day but the bible said the same came for a witness to bear witness of the light yes that all men through him might believe he was not that light but was sent now think about it why do we believe a message the messenger was not that light but he was sent amen to bear witness yes he was sent to bear witness of that light amen he said that was the true light that was the true light what the logos the word that came and most made flesh that was the true life which lighteth every man that cometh into the world he was in the world now watch how he moves back now he's talking about jesus and then all of a sudden he said there was a man sent from god and now he comes right back to the word again he says now he was not that light he was sent to bear witness of that life that was the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world verse 10 he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not he came into his own and his own received him none right but as many as received him yes oh my i want to be one who receives him today yes i want to be one who receives the prophet's words because the prophets were to speak of him yes a prophet witnesses of him right so it's not him we don't worship a man we don't we don't just follow a man we follow christ in the word but christ spoke a man was sent from god and he said if you receive those who have sinned you've received me yes right so as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of god so he says i'm not going to leave you in the condition that you are. but here's this word coming down manifested in the flesh and was prophesied by elijah the prophet to come and was foretold and introduced by him and now here he comes down to make you sons and daughters of god even to them that believe on his name amen gives you the power to be born again gives you the power to live a righteous life gives you the power to live for god you don't ever have to give in to any temptation you don't ever have to give in to any sin you don't ever have to get to a place where you feel like well i just can't make it but he said he gave you power to become the sons of god amen even to them that believe on his name which were born so this is how you become a son of god you you aren't educated into it i can't i can't make you a son of god by teaching you the message you become a son of god by being born into it not of blood nor the will of the flesh nor the will of man but of god yes amen now what was john's message when he come now look here he's talking about the word and how it come and there was a man sent from god and john's message was christ because the next day john seeth jesus coming unto him and said behold the lamb of god which takes away the sin of the world yes sir and brother brandon brought that down to our day and he said he didn't say behold my baptist behold my methodist yeah amen behold my pentecostal behold my favorite preacher what did he say behold the lamb of god that's what john that's what elijah spirit that's what the messenger the forerunner did yes sir now without that prophet and i read to you not long ago in the scripture where it says that those who receive john receive christ now not all of those some received john and never received christ right but those who received john's message yes who heard john's message they didn't stay with john but they said there here comes christ and brother randall says that the focus moves from the from the uh uh prophecy to to the fulfillment and so now that like the spotlight was on john in the river and when jesus comes into the water and is baptized the spotlight leaves john and as he's exiting the river if you can see it like a play as god's great drama is unfolding here's the spotlight it left john he's standing there in the river but he's still pointing at christ follow christ that's what the message is that's why it matters amen now without a prophet in the spirit and power of elijah the people would never recognize the promised word of the hour and because and i say word of the hour because it's there's a specific thing that god must do in our day and and that's the rapture of the church and so we know that that's coming the change of the body we know that that's coming now and and we know in one sense it's already began hebrews 13 8 tells us that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever brother ben i knew that move on wait a minute jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever now what do we say christ he the message is christ right the message is christ so why does the message matter because the message is the same yesterday today and forever jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever the message matters for yesterday yes right think about it the message matters for yesterday the message gives us perspective on what yesterday has been if you ever talk to a a regular denominational christian almost regardless of what denomination they are and you begin to talk to them and begin to speak to them about these things and they are good people many of them but they begin to talk to you and you begin to realize that they have no historical way of putting what hap what is happening today into context and what has happened in the context like the 2000 years it's like it didn't even matter and so history began when my denomination formed right so suddenly we were always without any hope and all of a sudden the church of christ come along and we were all saved right and and especially the oneness people bless their hearts i've talked to them about it and and even had family that went that direction and i talked to them about i said well how do you explain what happened in the church ages well there was just no nobody baptized in jesus name so there was nobody right so god didn't have anyone on the earth and there may have been some and that baptized but the you know the world just wasn't any movement until 1906 and then people started believing in the name of jesus christ and baptizing and then and then we now we have a church and that's the truth so history started with our denomination but we don't believe that do we why don't we believe that why can you believe that your methodist grandmother if you had one can be saved right you didn't get that from a denomination right you didn't get that from from so-and-so on youtube yeah right see if the message doesn't matter let's just pick somebody on youtube to follow but who are you going to pick where are you going to find a message that gives you perspective yes now think about it that places you in a proper perspective towards history so that you can see that the seed had to fall in the ground and you can see what had to happen during denominational ages and you can see why the martyrs came and you can see the four beasts and you can see the seven church ages and you can see the seven seals and how that they begin to start you begin to see all these things come together we take that for granted they don't understand that why would i want to leave this and go to a place where i don't even know where i am or what i believe right you all understand this morning i know i'm preaching to christians here this morning you all know this but i want to reinforce your faith today so most denominations have no answer for that what's happened well the catholic church said well we've always been the church well which infallible pope was right because they're all different yeah sure yes sir revelations 1 and 12 speaks of this because no denomination has an answer for this but here comes we're taught by the message he said i turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned i saw seven golden candle sticks in the midst of seven candlesticks one like into the son of man clove with a garment down to the foot geared about the past with a golden girdle his head and his hairs were white like woah why does snow his eyes wears a flame of fire his feet like in defined brass as if they burned in a furnace his voice is the sound of many waters and he had in his right hand seven stars and out of his mouth when a sharp two-edged sword and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength yes now look you look at him say what what are these seven candlesticks what are these seven stars leaving explain to the seven char the candlesticks are the seven churches the seven stars are seven messengers but we didn't weren't able to place those seven candlesticks in history without the message right the bible tells us the seven churches but it doesn't tell you what the seven churches were but now you're at the end looking back and saying we can identify those seven churches yes that's right right yes sir and we can look back and see what they were not only can we identify the seven candlesticks but we can identify the seven stars right we can look back in history you really i i realized just one day you know i was looking to test him brother brandon had a real revelation about the people that that were those seven stars the messenger for each age because how do you choose iranius over polycarp you know and all those things and begin to look at that and brother branham explains his methodology to that if you go back in the church age but the random explains that he says i he said i did it he said i almost chose polycarp but i chose irenaeus because polycarp was too close to denominationalism brother branham just looked at history and of course was guided by the angel by the holy spirit i believe that but he looked at history and he saw these men and he said here's one who meets the qualifications he said i looked at paul he said and then look at each one and see which one was closest to paul which one followed the example of paul in that age listen just history itself would tell you if there's going to be seven messengers who was it who was the messenger for our day would it be brother would it be uh benny hen would it be earl or oral roberts earl roberts about made him up got two preachers mixed up there would it be it would it be jack cole he's a good man but would it be him who would be the messenger for our day who opened who was there when the seals were open who got amen who was there to receive it i mean just look at history who else is it going to be i believe it was a prophet you believe whatever you want to if you believe it's you that's fine go manifest it yeah all right we'll wait 50 years and see what happens yeah say well the message has been here 50 60 years and and nothing's 70 years message and nothing's happened wait a minute yeah you don't see what i see at the christmas carol said do you see what i see with eyes of balaam looking at the hinder parts you don't see what i see i've seen a lot i've got every reason not to believe this message i'm a perfect test case for those that would try to come in and grab people have been hurt amen and try to use that hurt against them but david knows what i'm talking about some of y'all do we're test cases for that we've seen the backside of it we've seen men who failed we've seen churches that failed we've seen the abuse of authority we've been there we've watched the people take the message and claim to believe the message and make a cult out of it we've seen that we've been there and done that but you don't see what i see what i see is a bride becoming flesh what i see is that word that he preached which is the same yesterday today and forever moving out of history giving me a perspective about history but moving out of history and being the same god today amen that's what i see i see a bride rising up you can see what you want to but i see a people being saved i see people being born again i see people coming to christ i see people being saved miraculously from the things of the world i see people manifesting an end time message yes we have our problems yes there's people among us that are not true there's always going to be a mixed multitude but i see god doing what he promised he would do it depends on how you look at it amen now look brother branham says this he said no matter how good you are what you quit doing what you start doing you've got to accept the person of the lord jesus christ amen he said and then when you do that he is the word and then your life fits right in the word and it manifests itself to this age that you're living in noah had to do that for the word to be manifested in his age what if moses come along he said we know what noah done we'll take noah's word we'll do it just the way noah did it we'll build an ark and float down the now river and go out of egypt why it wouldn't have worked he said see that was another age jesus couldn't have come with moses message luther couldn't come with the catholic message well actually couldn't come with the luther's message pentecost couldn't come with the westview age message and the bride can't be formed in the pentecostal denomination it just can't do it he said that's exactly right she's done organized and went out here there she sits just like the rest of them and says shut hey man he said and then he begins talking about a writer because brother random had critics in his day right and they weren't they were here that's not new they like to think well we discovered all this stuff i've heard this stuff ever since i was a kid yeah i've heard the same criticisms yeah but you go and they're not those are not unique i don't even like to highlight them because they're not unique to the message you'll hear the same criticisms about christians yeah and if you take that same methodology when you can't prove it by science you can't prove jesus rose from the dead either or for that matter even that he ever existed and then where are we at yes sir right something you're going to have to believe something to be a christian it's going to take some faith to be a christian that's just the truth sir i wish i i wish i could prove everything by science i can't it's provable by science if you believe amen right if you believe i can prove to you by science jesus throws from the dead if you believe i can prove to you this message is true by scientific truth but if you don't believe yeah i can't prove it to you because there's always going to be that element of faith god made it that way he said he hid it from the eyes of the wise and prudent and revealed and debated such as would learn amen and so that writer began to criticize brother branham and he said what said he was a devil if there was such a thing so he said he didn't believe in god he said a god that could fold his arms and set up and watch them martyrs through the early ages claim to have power to open the red sea let them women and children be tore to pieces by lions and so forth he said and then say he was a loving god i was sitting in the philippines answering questions from young people one of the young people challenged me he said what kind of a god would let would let joshua go into jericho and kill the babies that's a real question huh and you try to explain that by the word and what the purpose was and all those things but again there's got something in you has to trust in an almighty god and that he knows what's best listen there's a judgment coming on this world there's going to be a time that's going to be wife clean and that's men women boys and girls god's going to allow that sin started it god didn't do it but god it's going to be in the hands of god when he lets it happen it'll be the judgments of the almighty god we've got to bow to the omniscience of god or you'll go crazy you're never going to understand what you go through i don't know why i'm going here this morning you're never going to understand why you went through what you went through that's right you're never going to do it live in the moment i was telling a young person yesterday is about to get married i said you need to live in the moment because if you constantly and i've advised other young people the same way if you're constantly worried about what your marriage and getting married and what it's going to be like and all these things and he hasn't even asked you yet you know that's a eventually you've got to come back and live in the moment rest in the fact that you have a person who who loves you and you and you love them and and there's this there's this bond between you but nothing's signed yet right and so that god may have a different plan but rest in this fact that there there's an attraction there and you can spend time together we need to learn how to value the moment in our lives if you spend the rest of your life trying to figure out why what happened to you happened to you you're going to end up on the ash sheep for the rest of your life but god had to bring job off of the ash sheep it wasn't that joke was a bad person anybody's going gonna gonna suffer when they've been through things like that yeah and some of you all suffer in ways that i can't even i've told you many times i can't i can't even imagine doing suffering like that i saw these kids that died the other day in the school shooting and my heart just broke i thought how in the world could could a boy take his take up arms and do that to children how how could that possibly because i see my own children that i can't even comprehend losing a child even the sickness much less to to those things but even in that you've got to bow to the omniscience of god and job said i can't make it into the world i'm going to go out naked i'll never understand it and god when he come to him he didn't ever show him why never did he just said i'm your redeemer yes job where were you before the foundation of the earth oh my he said he said where were you when the sons of god shall there's a revelation when the sons of god shouted together for joy job what are you doing why are you why are you why do you keep going after these things why do you keep keep rebuking god and fight with your friends he said there's something going on you don't understand and you never will but i'm here and job cried out i know my redeemer lives amen that's what we need to know brother branham spoke of those in the going through the dark ages he said all he told him he said i know i know what you're going through yes that's all he said i've always thought that i always wanted to be that kind of friend because i try to overexplain things but don't you appreciate that friend who will show up at the funeral just say i i know you know there's very few because only only a person has been through the same thing you went through can do that most people can't do that yeah but he always can because he was tempted in every way like we were so he just tells him he said i know oh my god can you imagine the prayers that went up from anguish mothers i don't know why i'm going this direction this morning but you just hang with me you know satan will use that he'll use the hardship of your life to try to tear you away from the message yeah sure to make you not not count on it anymore because if god was real this message had life in it why would you go through what you go through why would god allow something like that why would he ever do that there's just no there's no end to the questions and he'll try to use that to tear it away but he just says can you imagine a mother praying and she kind of god don't let them kill my baby don't let them kill my baby don't let them take my baby don't let them take them away away from me and if i if i acknowledge you they'll take my baby away and they'll kill my baby you imagine i i can imagine those sunday morning services they would gather together and say this this week you know we talk about this one's sick and that one they get up to read the prayer requests and say this one got killed in the arena brother so-and-so was was fed to the sister dogs and her baby was cut out of her womb and during that time god never lifted his finger he said i know that was their age they were in that ox age i don't say we have to go through that today but the things that we do go through yeah he says i know yeah he said it's enough for him to know right if you really know that he knows that he's omniscient and that he's got everything in control and you can ever wrap your mind around that and trust that say lord i i can't comprehend it i can't make myself feel better about it but i'm going to trust you i can't force myself to be happy but i'm going to trust you these people going through that and this atheist now used that against the message of the hour against brother branham because he said he said god's real how could a god that could fold his arms set up and watch them martyrs through the early ages and claim to have power to open the red sea let them women and children be torn to pieces like my lions and so forth and then said he was a loving god he said there's no such creature see the fellow without he said the fellow without inspiration of the word fails to see it he said the first corner of wheat the bridegroom had to fall into the earth where do you hear that you don't hear that at a baptist church that come from the message of the hour the corn of wheat had to fall into the ground in order to rise again so did the first bride yes amen that was born at pentecost had to go through the dark ages like any other seed to be buried you realize when is our dying time now we're going to be birthed we're planted on the earth we're here to die we got to go through this we we had to go through this to be tested that's why we're here and he drops us handfuls of joy and handfuls of inspiration but we're here to be tested that's our purpose on the earth but we're going to a better place a place where there is no death a place where they can't rip away our children a place where no one will be lost are you with me now yes amen they had to die we don't understand that that's where you you give in you surrender yourself to the omnipotence of god he says i know i know the first bride had to die he said but it started sprouting again in luther look at the simple simplicity of this explanation the god of the past the same yesterday today and forever the simplicity of this i know i know and then but here it comes sprouting again and the first reformation it didn't look like the seed that went in but it was the light of that day the stalk then went into the tassel wesley and from the tassel it went into pentecost to shut down isn't that easy to understand we didn't get that without a message you see the message explains our yesterdays and washes away yesterday think about this we're washed by the water of the word yes where did we find out that we were justified yes yes i mean you may have understood from the scripture that the blood of jesus christ covered your sin but what does that mean what does that mean you could look at it say wait i know it says it but what does it mean for me well listen to what a prophet said he said not only is the bride washed forgiven but she is justified did you ever try the word justified to see what it means he said for instance if brother green heard that i've been drinking i've been doing bad things he found out that i didn't do it he come and said i forgive you brother branham you forgive me i've never done it what are you forgiving me about he said but if i'm guilty then i can be forgiven but i'm still not just because i did it but the word justified is though you've never done it at all he said and then the blood of jesus christ cleanses us so from sin until it's put in the book of god's forgetfulness and he's the only one who can do it he said we can't we can forgive but we can't forget he said i could forgive you but i will always remember what you've done those evil things he said then you're not just you're forgiven but in the sight of god the bride is justified she never done it in the first place amen standing there married to the virtuous son of god never sinned in the first place why here's the explanation she was four ordained she was trapped into this and now when she hears the truth and come forth the blood cleansed her and she stands there virtuous no sin on her at all where do you get that from does the message matter come on yes sir yes sir don't get that from a denominational theory the message matters for yesterday's the message matters today remember jesus christ the same yesterday yes today the message places us in christ ephesians 1 3 talks about that how we were blessed with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world we should be holy without blame before him in love there was no wesley in a pentecostal church if you think about it that truth was there during calvin's age and then it began to be lost but they went to an extreme version of calvinism and then it began to be lost and here come the spirit of god moving in the wesleyans and the pentecostals but there is no wesley or pentecostal church that i know of that teaches predestination an election why it was restored by the message a prophet had to come i just had to come what is christ christ it's the word what is the message the message is christ why do we need the message because we need christ in his fullness amen forever was an hour we need him that's today he said in the volume of the book it's written to me listen that this was restored by the message of the hour where we could see christ in his fullness and see who he was and who we are predestinated he said there's a mystery before christ or anything else was ever on earth you see his great mystery that he chose the bride knowing eve would fall from disbelieving the word knowing that she would fall but he would choose a bride that would not fall that would hold to that word regardless of what all the rest of the world had to say about it is that you this morning you're going to hold on to the word no matter what the world says he said they would hold to that word they are predestinated to stand there you don't do that because that you were because you decided to you knew that because you were predestined to stand there the adoption of children by jesus christ predestinated the church to that great glorious stand he said oh i'm so happy i stand for the message you don't stand for it because you chose to you stand for it because the word in you responded to the word yes sir amen before the foundation of the world you were predestinated to that great glorious stance that's why you stood for 50 years that's why you stood in the church i think of members here in the church some of you have stood since before i was born some of you about double me and age and and when you look back and you begin to see you stood for the message almost since it began why are you still standing it wasn't you it was predestination amen amen the message affects that it affects our conduct how does god want us to act are you still with me this morning how does god want us to act in this world is so messed up no one knows who they are who are we think about it and see as i read the scripture to begin with you'll either be deformed or transformed by them you'll either be deformed by the culture transformed by the word yes one of those two things is going to happen in the hour that we live in and i want to use as an example this morning because it leads through and sometimes we don't think about these things deeply enough and then i'll close in just a few moments if we don't get finished we'll just close anyway but i want to deal with this in first corinthians chapter 11 and verse 1 because when you look at the family today and you look at what's going on why does the message matter the message places us in christ and it places our conduct it matters today not just for yesterday because some people look back and say well god did this to a prophet god did this they accept that but the message matters today jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever and there's a reason why we're different and it begins with simple teaching yeah about the difference between men and women it's why we're not it's why we are so different it's hard to explain sometimes i know my girls get asked why do you not cut your hair huh and mom was telling me that she someone had told her why don't you trim off the dead end someone who knows better why don't you trim off the dead dead ends and just it'll make your hair so much better so why would i start doing that now after all these years but now you look at that and you begin to think why do we do things differently well because of the word right and you could say and i tell my my kids i say tell them the bible says so the bible says to do that we follow the scriptures but it's the message of the hour that brought this this present to us where we understood that it was for our day right first corinthians chapter 11 verse one be followers of me even as i also am of christ that's paul he said follow me as i follow christ verse 2 now i praise you brethren that you remember me in all things and keep the ordinances today we would say well he's taking too much on himself no he was the messenger to the age now as semester of the age this is where pastors gets get mixed up because as a messenger to the age he could do he could do things and say things about his ministry that i can't right right you don't follow me exclusively you follow the message right as long as i'm preaching that message you follow me right but a messenger to the age is under just the word himself right you follow him you follow the word you follow the man you trust if he is a messenger you'll stay with the word right yes sir right we believe we have a messenger to this age but now i don't get to say that i can't just say just give that blanket statement but paul could be followers of me he said now i praise you brethren that you remember me in all things and keep the ordinances as i delivered them to you he said but i would have you know that the head of every man is christ and the head of the woman is the man and the head of christ is god watch the family order he said this is the way it's supposed to be every man praying or prophesying having his head covered dishonoreth his head or we don't wear men don't wear hats in church and i'm seeing that creep in even into the message where people wear a ball cap and in church whether you're having church or not the sanctuary is not a place for a ball cap if i ever forget tell me that because i wear a ball cap all the time but i would expect a deacon if i come in here with a ball cap on to tell me take it off that's right because there's we don't cover our heads because that was not to be a man to do that and but now he'll talk about what a covering is in just a moment he said he said every man praying or prophecying having his head covered dishonored with his head his head is christ he's not dishonoring this be hard to be more dishonorable than my head is far just the way it looks but he he said now every and every woman that prayeth through prophesies with their head uncovered if you've got the scripture open your bibles to it where you can read with me every woman that prays or prophesies with her with her head uncovered dishonor her head for that in other words her husband remember the husband is the head of the woman christ is the head of the man he says with her head uncovered dishonor their head think about it like this because in our day and age we're taught that over and over girls don't let a man tell you you can't do for yourself but listen like this the man has responsibility for the wife and the family think about headship like responsibility that's the way it is with the church it don't make me a dictator i'm responsible right and it makes a man responsible he can't just treat his wife like a doorman he's responsible and i'm going somewhere with this now he said but every woman that praised their prophesies with her head uncovered dishonor their head for that is even all one as if she were shaven and back then it would have been an extreme disgrace a dishonor for a woman to have her head shaved completely shaved he said but if she if she cuts her hair she might as well have it shaved off he said for a woman be not covered let her also be shorn if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven let her be covered he said for a man indeed ought not to cover his head for as much as he is the image and glory of god but the woman is the glory of the man for the man is not of the woman but the woman of the man again you got to understand this in a biblical context he's not talking about some type of rulership where the man rules by fear it never works unless a husband loves his wife right it just won't work don't try it unless a husband loves his wife that's where it works but now he says the woman is the glory of the man the man is not of the woman the woman of the man neither in other words the man came first and woman come out of his side he said but this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels brother brown said that was the messengers he said a real minister would say something about it he said nevertheless neither is the man without the woman neither the woman without the man in the lord i love that scripture he's saying in the lord he said you can't do without one another right so you can't just say i'm the head you're under the headship of god right he said for as the woman is of the man even so is the man also by the woman in other words you were born by a woman every person in here was sure so if the woman come out of the man originally ever since then man come out of the woman right i think that's how it works he said but all things of god see god god was the creator verse 13 judging yourselves is it comely or is it decent that a woman pray unto god uncovered he said does not even nature itself teach you now you say well that covering i got to put a hat on in church he's going to explain himself he said does not nature itself teach you that if a man have long hair that would be covered would be long how long is long well not to cover and if you go back in the original to cover by the way if you go back and look at that to the original word cover means to be long enough to cover the shoulders and go back and look at it it's a glory to her now he said if a man have long hair it's a shame unto him it's a shame god never changed that i don't have to worry about that with most of you but men's hair because of testosterone if you understand that if you're a nurse or a doctor you'd understand that better than i would but because of testosterone present in the man and the woman has estrogen the woman's hair doesn't fall out like a man's dust thank god and sometimes it does there's always exceptions to every rule but in general that that's that's the case he said so that's nature teaching you that if a man has long hair it's a shame it wasn't built that way if a woman something's wrong he's effeminate that's what he's saying there's a lack of something and he's effeminate nature itself teaches you a man has long hair it's a shame if a woman have long hair it is a glory to her i'm about to give this up and let you preach for a minute but this is the word isn't it we believe the message of the hour he said now he said if a woman have long hair it's a glory it's not a shame it's a glory her hair is given her for covering so not a hat like the mennonite women or something would wear or the catholics would wear something or the muslims would wear a shawl or a veil he didn't say it was a veil he said he said it's not a veil it's a it's her hair that's given to her for a covering he said but if any man seem to be contentious we have no such custom the churches of god now many denominational pastors if you take this this scripture bring this verse 16 and say well see there's no custom but you can go back to any commentary you can go back to any explanation any alternate version and you'll find out that what he's saying is there's no custom of contentiousness in other words the custom in all the churches was that there's no question about this men have short hair women have long hair but the church decided this doesn't matter now look if this doesn't matter then does romans 1 matter right where he talks about men being attracted to men women attack does that matter and that's how you end up with women lesbians in the pulpit homosexuals in the pulpit right because it started in the 50s and a prophet of god looked at that coming you see why he talked about it over and over and over again and he can see where we're at today when i was told i was sitting in a in a brother's house the other day and he told me that in their school just in a rural school not far from here that there's now kids that call themselves furries i think is what they call it they give themselves a an identity of being a cat or a dog or some other kind of animal and they wear a tail in a local rural school smaller than the one here at highland that they actually they actually name themselves this and they were raising a petition because they didn't have their own bathroom their own litter box where does it end yeah well you could be whatever you want to be that's not what god said god said i made a man with with short hair i mean a woman with long hair and i wanted to stay that way because if you if you give that up about god you begin to go to all other areas and that's why brother branham was not a legalistic man he wasn't legalistic about a lot of things and he didn't just come and tell us every little way and he said i don't care how you wear it it's got to be long right and so he wasn't giving us legalism what was he telling us the word said that because there's a direct line from the women's liberation movement when they begin to cut their hair and wear pants until today when there's no difference in the gender at all and you can't even tell and we laugh at that but it comes right into the church and you can't even tell which one's which i have trouble i never had trouble as a kid i don't remember having trouble telling men from women the farmers wore overalls and and women even though they had pants and short hair but you can tell the difference i have trouble today with young people especially there are people in in in the kids of school and different places we go we'll attend at a restaurant you watch somebody come in and you gotta look for a while and you may never be able to tell whether it's a man or a woman and it's always kind of amazing to me but it's just accepted now it's just the way it is but it don't it's not accepted in your body you understand your body rejects that and that's why then you suddenly have violence and depression these kids they give them hormone blockers and everything else i know you didn't come to church necessarily to hear this this morning but we need to understand these things they give them these things and push it down their throats and say well let a kid transition even give them surgery it's barbaric there's a child that can't even decide for themselves they give them surgery to become another sex and but it started back here when the church said it doesn't matter yeah that's right the truth says for another age but a prophet does the message matter a prophet said it does matter see a church that rejects first corinthians 11 will eventually reject romans 1. how can it not because the reasons are the same if we if we hold the women to that standard we'll have fewer members and less money so if that's your standard that will change the word based on fewer members and less money you're going to have trouble one day yeah sure you understand i'm not yelling at people people can do what they want we're not a cult we don't hold one of you to this standard none of you but the word holds us all right and that's what it is the word holds it you you have to go home and be right with god after hearing the preaching of the word i don't hold you to that right i don't know what you do at home but i know this there's a god who cares about maintaining his order on the earth and there's a god who cares about you and he wants you to be right and he wants you to live before him where is pleasing in his sight i want to be pleasing to him don't you but it matters it matters more than we realize we say well don't cut your hair because the prophet said so no it leads to immorality it leads into the age that we're living in not that the people that cut their hair is are immoral that's not what i'm saying i'm saying the fact that the church allowed it then and it's come on up until it's completely gone haywire now where anything goes and they can't say anything about anything and so brother branham says this he said when you want to see the message of the hour there's nothing else you can see but that let me believe that today that's all everything else is gone the rest of it's just the filler you to see the message when no one in his group when they saw the message nothing else mattered when moses group saw it nothing else mattered when john's group saw it nothing else meant all that you could see it today that you can see it it's not a man it's christ hey man and he can give you the power to live it when the apostles group saw it nothing else mattered when luther's group saw it west is group pentecostal groups thought nothing else mattered they pulled away from everything by his foreknowledge he predestined these things to happen he knows what's in a man he knew it from the beginning what it was therefore he can make everything how many say everything this morning everything worked just exactly on clock time we get all nervous and frustrated you never seen him flustered everything's working all right just exactly the clock's ticking no he said where are you going you went from cut hair to god predestination and everything on time wait a minute he's going to bring it together he said these things that's supposed to happen all these women with short hair and these men wearing their like they got hair like their wives he said i see them absolutely have these roller curlers in their hair curl it up here in front what a perversion notice how he links it to perversion he said that's the results of satan's eating we're at the end of the end of it today that's the results of satan's eden and do like her she's trying to cut her hair like her husband her husband's letting his hair grow like his wife she is wearing his clothes he's wearing her underneath clothes she's getting masculine he's getting feminists we've watched it play out why are we different he said see it's satan's eating contrary to what god made it at the beginning that's the truth why are we different because of a message i don't want to be like this culture i don't want to be in a world where it's so confused where boys are so confused they don't know what they are and they'll play a video game and get so angry that they go shoot up a school full of children yeah sure i don't want to live in that world one day we won't but i don't want to be like that i don't want my kids confused about what they are i don't want to people say well i just want to take a stand against a cult you want to take a stand against a cult take a stand against the cult of video games that teaches people violence take a stand against the cult of pornography it teaches our young men to objectify women and teaches them that they can't even be husbands once they get married yeah are you sure i don't mean to be sound angry this morning but it just about had my feel of this world i've just about seen enough i want to go home i don't want to live in a world like that i don't want to live in a world where where you can't tell the difference and and not you can't have families anymore you realize that at the current rate of homosexuality i think the year was 2054 everybody in the world if it kept doubling at its current rate every so many years everybody in the world would be homosexual you realize in your generation some of you that are 65 and older in your generation there was one or two percent of the population you know what it is in my kids this generation 20 to 40 percent you see where we're going you say well you can't preach about that today if there ever was a time we needed to preach about it is today all right amen this is the hour when the message matters the most so what did what will satan do he'll send something to your email let's try to get you on a website they'll try to take the message away from you because this is the hour when it matters the most yes he's trying to bring everybody into his culture everybody into satan's even but we resist that why because a message come to us we were predestinated to hear it right amen the message you say well the messages are called i'll tell you what the message is the message of christ there may be cults around the message but the message of christ produces godly men women and families the message of christ produces people that live the gospel the message of christ produces people like some of you all and i'll just give you the credit right now because i may not live another day but some of y'all lived this message for years that's what the message produces and you can tell your children they can look around and see all the things going on and they can say what about him what about her and you can sit there and look at them and without any kind of arrogance at all and say but god that this message produced me this word produced me i live by the scriptures i live by the message of the hour and it produced kindness and joy and grace in my life it produced i'm not perfect but it produced something in me and it'll produce the same thing in you i remember hearing brother harold brown years ago and he said there was come a time he said when i was able to look at my son he said one day i couldn't do it but there come a time and i was able to look at my son and said son do what i do live like i live it'll bless you it'll help you that's a strong statement but paul said follow me as i follow christ i can't say that to everybody i'm not the messenger of the age but even to my children i can say son if you'll live it it'll produce a godly life daughter if you live it it'll produce love in the family it's not just a command something you have to do it'll produce love and joy and peace the fruits of the spirit the message matters i'm closing the message matters tomorrow you believe the message matters tomorrow what's in the future ain't nothing in the future in this world but heartache a system falling to pieces economic system that's going downhill but the message still matters because the message gives us hope for the future amen not just a hope but a biblical hope an expectation of what the future is you see without the message there would be no rapture we wouldn't be sure but now the message come at the end time to tell us behold the lamb of god here he is here he comes yes the bride is making yourself ready did you ever wonder what's she making herself ready with we say the word how do we know that look at revelation chapter 19 and verse 5. revelation 19 and 5 a voice come out of the throne saying praise our god oh his servants listen where did the voice come from from the throne yes what was the voice encouraging us to do to worship yes that's right well you could preach on that a voice come out of the throne saying praise god either fear him both small and great and i heard and said we're the voice of a great multitude that's the voice of many waters that's all of us as the voice of mighty thundering saying hallelujah for the lord god omnipotent reigneth let us be glad and rejoice this is what they're saying in response to the message that comes from the throne this message didn't come from jeffersonville it come from the throne of god yes brother browner's voice is not the literal voice of god but the message that he preached no matter what the vocal cords did it passed over made it to be the message that he preached amen it was a voice amen that come out of the throne come from the throne room he said and i heard that the voice of all this great multitude said in the lord god almighty reigneth let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife has made herself ready that's you and i today we have hope for the future because we're already dressed we're already waiting we're sitting there like that little bride was waiting on the man to come back from chicago here we're standing where are we standing clothed in the word of god washed by the water of the word different from the world waiting to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white aren't you glad for the final in it what is it what is it it's the righteousness of saints it's his righteousness amen given to us tran transmuted to us imputed to us verse 9 he saith unto me right blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb musicians go ahead and come we're closing this morning blessed are they which are called unto the marriage suffer the lamb he sayeth unto me these are the true sayings of god you can trust them these are the true sayings and i fell at his feet to worship him and he said unto me see thou do it not i am that fellow servant and of thy brethren that have the testimony of jesus worship god for the testimony of jesus is the spirit of prophecy there's the coming of the prophet he's standing there the bride is rejoicing can you see it where are we at what's the next verse i saw heaven open behold the lamb see the christ that came in word form this it rap finally wraps up when he comes he doesn't come back to the earth when we meet him in the air that's his second coming but it finally wraps up this cycle wraps up at the end of the marriage supper when we're riding with him and so john in the vision he sees this this man this angel this this messenger speaking to him this voice from the throne speaking oh he's speaking to him and he's saying i'm one of your brethren don't worship me and immediately he said i saw heaven opened behold a white horse he that set upon him what was the message the message jesus christ he that set upon him was called faithful and true and then righteous righteousness he does judge and make war he is the message the messenger was just one standing by when heaven's opened oh god we just see what god has done in our hour the only hope that this world has i say this world those of us who are in this world who care about it the only hope that we have the only hope for the future the only expectation is in this message and i'll always stand for it again not because i not because i chose it but it chose me this is the hope of the future it's in this message not in a man if i was trusting brother bran i'm about to give up years ago i'm not trusting brother branham i'm trusting a message from the throne that come through brother branham are you with me now i'm not if you trust me alone you're going to be in trouble i want you to trust me but i want you to trust me so much that you give up on the word go to the word find out what it says because the message is christ the word is christ and the word places us the same yesterday shows us what we were places us in history today shows us what's going on right now doesn't it it shows us what'll take place in the future i saw heaven open a white horse let's bow our heads together said heavens will pass away but the word will never pass away i know i've been all over the place this morning i felt relaxed preaching to you and some of the things i said wasn't in my notes but maybe it was for you i don't know one of the hardest things about preaching is you can't control the outcome of the message all you do is sow seeds [Music] you can't control what people do that would be a forced religion it would be a cult but you can sow seeds and maybe people come go back to the word and begin to read and say oh that's what he said that's what the scripture says that's the truth i believe it if there's a seed of god there there'll be something that says i believe it lord help my unbelief if you're struggling with something today maybe maybe you've heard from some of these messengers that would come along and try to tell you that the message isn't true maybe you kind of listen to it for just a moment you say well that means i'm not bride brother branham i was driving down the road one day and he was listening to a radio station they were talking about how there was no creation and all these things he said the devil began talking to me and said well these things aren't real see to hear that voice doesn't mean you're not a christian it just means that satan's out to get you who's he out to get he's out to get the christians he's out to get you you'll you'll hear the voices of doubt but take it defend it with the word of god don't try to stand there on your own merit or anybody else well my pastor he really believes it should take the word of god he said but he also said you take the word of god and speak it right back to him like jesus did and you can overcome that maybe you've been struggling with that you just pray and ask god to help you you'll right from your seat where you're at this morning and you just say lord i i want you to come and and just solidify these things in my mind maybe i don't understand it all i want you to come and help me to understand lord help me to do that and we'll pray for you heavenly father are we we we want you to come into our lives and be our the teacher the comforter lord that would come was to teach us all things we thank you for that lord and we want you to come in today and be the teacher beyond what i could say but by the foolishness of preaching maybe you planted a seed this morning it would show us we you are the same yesterday today and forever you are the same in every aspect except the corporal body the lord and even that corporal body lord is coming back one day we're so grateful for that today we thank you for all that you do and all that you are to us lord would you just settle every mind maybe there's someone who's gone through something in their lives and they've been struggled getting off that ass sheep oh god would you help them today i can't do that for them i wish that i could but lord would you just come and speak peace into their lives and help them to know that you know about it and that you're there with them may they feel your presence lord in these times the world's gone crazy may we feel the comforting hand of jehovah on us we would understand lord that things are that are shaking out of the world but we cannot be shaken because we are the bride of jesus christ we're so thankful lord we're thankful for revelation a solid rock a revelation of who you are a rock we can base our life on lord we thank you for the message of the hour i pray you would bring these things down into each heart we pray speak to each one individually we pray and we ask it all in the name of jesus amen amen just let's just stand and worship him can't you see thank you lord if you need special prayer the altar is open i'm happy thank you i've
