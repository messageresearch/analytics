people through the week Lord and help them Lord and their lives get closer to you we pray Ines Jesus name amen amen God bless you we're going to turn to Genesis chapter 41 and verse 41 we're going to wrap up our series on Joseph tonight although we will have a little bit of a tie-in to Abraham uh coming up as we wrap up that series as well uh I hope it's been a blessing to you I would try to get into these things and try to find something that would be a a help to people and and uh and that would be right with the message of the hour and that's on our heart so Genesis 41 and 41 this is just real good stuff in here tonight it's not something anything that you don't know but it's real good uh real good word and I I'm just thankful for the word of God it's what we live off of that's what we feed on is the word of God Genesis 41:41 and Pharaoh said unto Joseph see I have set the over all the land of Egypt and Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand and put it upon Joseph's hand and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen and put a gold chain about his neck and he made him to ride in the second Chariot which he had and they cried before him bow the knee and he made him ruler over all the land of Egypt and Pharaoh said unto Joseph I am Pharaoh without the shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt and Pharaoh called Joseph's name zna pan and he gave him to wife asth the daughter of pipera priest of an and Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt Joseph was 30 years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt and Joseph went out from the presence of pharaoh and went throughout all the land of Egypt I pray the Lord would add his Blessing to the word you may be seated Joseph types Christ in many ways but as especially in this episode of his life we know that Abraham had uh children several children other than Isaac but Isaac was the promised son so you begin to see a uh kind of a narrowing down a focus on Isaac and away from ishmail and Abraham's other children and we know that Isaac had both Esau and Jacob and you see that Jacob have I loved and Esau have I hated so there's a narrowing down of that as well but then Jacob had 12 sons but those 12 sons together would be the foundation of the children of Israel they would all be elect if we could think of it that way they would all be Israel they would all be Jacob's children and so that was how God would make the tribes and the things of Israel now that was where the promise would go to and and yet they didn't get along we found that out and and there was something something done that was terrible they sold uh Joseph into slavery we know that 10 of Jacob's sons were half brothers and were either involved in either the plot to sell Joseph into slavery or the cover up the only exception to that was Benjamin Benjamin wasn't involved because he wasn't yet born he was the only son uh of uh Jacob's actually that was born in the promised land you find in Genesis 3518 it says it's speaking of the time that uh that Rachel or or that uh uh his mother died and and as she uh came to pass as her soul was in departing for she died she called his name benon but his father called him Benjamin and benon means son of my sorrow Benjamin is son of my right hand and Rachel died and was buried in the way to ephrath which is Bethlehem so they were in the promised land at that time but the other 12 sons weren't born in the promised land they were born actually back at at Jacob's original home where he had met uh his wife and where he had where he had uh tried to he had worked all those years to get uh his two wives and so Genesis 35:23 says the sons of Leah were Reuben and Simeon and Levi and Judah and isachar and zebulun the sons of Rachel or Joseph and Benjamin and the son of Bal uh were Dan and nap the son of zilpa was Gad and Asher and it says these are the sons of Jacob which were born to him in Pat and arum except for Benjamin that's the inference there Pat and arum is where Rachel and Leah were from Benjamin was actually born in Joseph's absence and you're sitting there right now thinking what in the world why does this matter well it matters because a it's a type of the 144,000 Jews who had nothing to do do with the crucifixion of Christ who were born in his absence and so they were uh born in a different season and yet yet Joseph would would uh bring Redemption to them if we could put it that way he would find a way to to express himself to them and and reveal himself to them now I I'd made kind of a a mistake actually earlier in this series and I'll just own up to it how many human beings do we have here are we all human the rest of you I don't know what you are I actually made a mistake because I had speculated and that's not a good thing to do had speculated that one of the reasons why there was partiality in in Jacob's family was because his wife had passed away and it appears that that's the case if you look at the chronology of the scriptures but it puts Rachel's death before the story of Joseph right but that's not actually when she died she actually died after after Joseph left when we know that because of Genesis 3710 when he was telling his father his dream you remember this this verse he said his father rebuked him and said unto him what is this dream that th that thou H has dreamed shall I and thy mother see she's not dead she's living shall I and thy mother and thy Brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the Earth and again it matters because Benjamin had to be born in the absence of Joseph brother brandom kind of draws down on that point he said his little brother that had been born into the family after he had been gone he said see by his mother the first church the Orthodox Church the 144,000 were born in his absence while he was away to get his Gentile bride you remember when Jesus died the Jews said let his blood be on us and our children remember that right let his blood be on us and our children what were they saying they were saying you know there's nothing to it and it won't matter there'll never be any kind of recrimination from this but there was we found that the Jews suffered for hundreds even thousands of years and culminating in the Holocaust when they were slaughtered we find the Jews under the altar that were given white robes which is a direct parallel to Joseph giving robes to his brothers and especially the little Benjamin but they were and the random draws that parallel in the fifth seal but you find that they were they they had they they had had happened to them they paid for what they did just like we pay in this life for what we do right if you do something that's wrong if you sow a certain thing you reap that thing but I'm so glad for Grace tonight that looks even beyond that and look to that little Benjamin said well it wasn't their fault they were born in the absence and there still out of that Orthodox Church comes 144,000 Jews who will be saved as a nation at the end time born in the land right Born in the land the only generation don't you see why they had to come back into the land they had to be born in the land like Benjamin was and they had to be born in the land in the absence of Joseph while he's dealing with his Gentile bride aren't you glad he chose to deal with us he didn't have to but he chose to deal with us so in his absence he deals with his Gentile bride but he hasn't forgotten his family he hasn't forgotten his chosen people what's he going to do he's going to call 144,000 of them after he turns back to the Jews after we're gone now so they're born in the land born in his absence Revelation 7 and one tells us the story excuse me tonight I'm struggling with my voice to preaching Sunday but you just had to bear with me it says after these things I saw four Angels standing on the four corners of the Earth holding the Four Winds of the earth that the wind should not blow on the earth nor in the sea nor in any tree and I saw another Angel ascending from the East having the Seal of the Living God and he cried with a loud voice to the Four Angels whom it was given to hurt the earth and the Sea saying hurt not the Earth neither the sea nor the trees till we have sealed the Servants of God in their foreheads so he's saying don't destroy the Earth with the Winds of War right brother Brandon said this happened in World War I he said don't destroy the Earth with the Winds of War with the mustard gas and the and the and atomic weapons and all the things they were building up to he said that war just stopped suddenly right and with no explanation it was just a war of attrition that would have just kept going and but it stopped what was it it was the mercy of God God said don't destroy the Earth because there's got to be a nation of Israel right there's got to be a people born in the land there's got to be 144,000 that will be sealed so he said don't hurt the Earth he said I heard the number of them which were sealed they were sealed 144,000 of all the tribes of the children of Israel there would there would be 12,000 from each tribe except for Dan and Ephraim if you go into the seventh seal brother B talks about that their names were blotted out under the heavens for idolatry and Joseph and Levi were substituted in their place so again they're paying for what they did right right their names are blotted out but brother Brown said in the Millennium the tribes are back in order because in the Millennium is when all wrongs are made right every knot that's been tied that we we things that we did that we couldn't change we couldn't untie he said it'll be untied in the Millennium so Joseph is raised from the pit he's he takes a gentile wife in Genesis 41:45 and Pharaoh called Joseph's name zapa pan I don't know if I'm I'm pronouncing that right but I figure none of us know how to pronounce it so we'll just say that's it and he gave him to wife ath the daughter of poera priest of an and Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt it's interesting Joseph's Egyptian name means Savior and revealer of Secrets I believe that's what he is to us see we he had a name that he was given when he come to Earth the the type or the antitype of Christ when he come to the Earth he said she shall bring forth a son and thou shalt call his name Jesus for he shall save his people from their sins what is Jesus Savior savior Jehovah's savior so he takes a wife from a pagan background his brothers wouldn't have understood that the Jews would have never understood the gospel going to the Gentiles it was completely antithetical to what they were and what they had been taught about their own specialness they they just didn't understand it they wouldn't have they wouldn't have received it so what does God do God blinds his people for the purpose of saving us I I'm so grateful for the mercy of God tonight he blinds his own people for the purpose of saving people who were walking around with clubs on their backs we can say it that way people who didn't have any knowledge of God people who had no understanding at all we were Romans or or tribal people of some kind we we didn't have any understanding of God we were not a part of anything that happened in the Old Testament but God rich in Mercy opened up a door of Mercy to the Gentiles and said I'm going to while I'm in Egypt I'm going to focus my time and my attention on my Gentile wife right so he come down to buy our Redemption but he also bought Israel's Redemption Israel is God's people we are his wife but Israel is God's people listen and and again he blinded his own people to graft his wife into the Plan of Redemption he said well I don't understand that look how beautifully Paul puts it in Romans chapter 11 Romans 11:1 I say then hath God Cast Away his people God forbid God don't work like that that ought to give some of his courage tonight as God Cast Away his people God forbid for I also am an Israelite of the Seed of Abraham of The Tribe of Benjamin he said God ha not Cast Away his people which she fornew watch you not what the scripture saith of Elias how he maketh intercession to God against Israel saying Lord they've killed that prophets and dig down the altars and I'm left alone they seek my life but what say the answer of God unto him I've reserved to myself 7,000 men not bow the knee to the image of Baal so he says within Israel there's always a Remnant that will be saved right and even in Paul's time there was a Remnant he represented that Remnant that would be saved but at the end time there's 144,00 will be saved as a nation but now look he says he said even so then at this present time also there is a Remnant according to the election of Grace but the brown was always very careful with that he said all Israel be saved everyone written in the name in the Lamb's Book of Life then they'll all be saved verse 11 Romans 11:11 says I say then have they stumbled that they should fall God forbid I love Paul's language there he said God just don't you don't don't understand God at all if you think they stumbled that they should fall that that's not how God works God keeps what he calls what he forne he predestines what he predestines he he glorifies he he's not going to lose a one that's that's our God he's that big that he's able to do that if he's able to lose you he wouldn't be God right and you say well isn't my choice absolutely it is but he's able to influence you in such a way and such with such overwhelming Grace that you couldn't do anything else we find that over and over again in the scripture he doesn't come that come and change your free moral agency but he he he knew that you would believe and he causes you to believe puts something in you to believe with so he said again he said salv rather through their fall salvation has come to the Gentiles for to provoke them to jealousy he said now the fall of of them be the riches of the world and see God's fixing to do something great something Great's about to happen but the great thing that's going to happen that the world's going to see is not going to happen to us it's going to happen to the Jews right the great thing that happens to us is we're going home but the world's not going to see that they're not even going to know it happened right when if you're looking for the message to become widely accepted in the world as far as I know that's ever supposed to happen right we're supposed to be a small group that that's who we are we're a tithing of the earth a portion of a portion the elect of the elect where people that that God's going to call home in a moment in a twinkling of an eye and people won't even know they'll go on having church and going doing what they're doing people won't even know it happened except for those that are very very close to us would be the only ones that would know but here is something that people are going to know he said If the fall be the riches of the world and the diminishing of them The Riches of the Gentiles how much more their fullness right and Paul deals with Gentile arrogance if you could be grafted he said they can be grafted in again I won't read all of those verses but he basically tells us don't be arrogant because you were grafted in because just the same as you were grafted in they can be grafted in again because they're God's people he doesn't he doesn't forsake his people but this very interesting to me because he said If the fall of them would be the riches of the world how much more their fullness and it it makes you wonder what happens during that time of the tribulation period and what all how all that goes into the to the ones who are uh who make it through the tribulation period and give their lives you know the church right because the church don't go in the Rapture of the Bride does but when I I wonder how many of them will see what God's doing with the Jews and recognize what hour it is right now think about it cuz God won't be working with them but they'll see what he's doing with the Jews because the whole world will see it Romans 11:25 for I would not Brethren that you should be ignorant of this mystery Le you should be wise in your own conceits that blindness in part is happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles be com in so that's where brother brand says that last one right he said that last one's got to come in he might be your neighbor he might be one of our children sitting here right or she it might be might be somebody down the street it might be somebody in Africa we don't know who the last one is but when that last one comes in we go home amen right he said and so until the fullness of the Gentiles become in every name that's written on the book and so he said all Israel shall be saved as it is written there shall come out of s the deliverer it shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob oh my for this is my Covenant unto them when I take away their sins as concerning the gospel they're enemies for your sakes but as touching the election they are beloved for the father's sakes he says for the gifts and calling of God are without repentance they're still God's people and that's why you it's still a curse to be against Israel even though they don't believe anything right right they don't believe in the Messiah they've rejected their Messiah right but it's still a curse to be against Israel cuz they're still God's people right and that ought to make us think about how we treat one another because even if I even if I fail even if I even if you fail in some way we're still God's people we still have to treat one another right because there's still a blessing to bless God's people in a curse to go against them look at Abraham the story that we've been going through here Abraham lied and said she's my sister but when the king tried to take her he said you're as good as a dead man that's right why it's a blessing and a curse because you're still God's people amen oh that ought to that ought to really that ought to help us to understand how we should treat one another help me Lord now look he said even so he said uh he said for in times past you have not believed God yet have now obtained Mercy through their unbelief even so have these also now not believed that through your mercy they also May obtain Mercy even so he said for God ha concluded them all in unbelief that he might have mercy upon all and I love verse 33 through the end of the chapter I've read it to you before but it means so much to me because Paul starts to worship and he said all the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God right he he gets after writing this under inspiration it just moves him and he said how unsearchable are his judgments his ways past finding out and he said for who ha known the mind of the Lord who have been his counselor who has first given to him and it should be recompensed unto him again for of him and through him and to him are all things someone say all things to whom be glory forever amen so he said God did this in his own mind we just found out what he did we could have never dreamed up a plan like that but God did it see Paul knew they'd be grafted back in now John sees the 144,000 but he doesn't see how exactly they would be brought back in because that was a mystery was held until the book was open so you see what the opening of the word tells us in our day it reveals to us the place of the Jews right at the end time because before that we could only speculate at it so brother brandom in the 1950s and to kind of prove this point we could only speculate that's all brother brandom could do before the book was open because in the 1950s brother Bram was on his way to Israel and he stopped anding Cairo had the ticket in his hand for Jerusalem or Tel Aviv and the Holy Spirit told him not to go and he didn't even understand it but the Holy Spirit rebuked him told him don't go he he didn't understand why and so brother brandham says it like this he said what a beautiful setup for the ministry the Lord has given me so brother Bram recognizes that Israel will believe a prophet and he knows the gift that God placed in his life the what he was if I could say it that way was a prophet right and so he realized that he said what a beautiful setup he said I was in 200 miles of Palestine recently and I had my ticket to go on over and I thought this is the hour I know that feeling cuz when you're flying into Egypt you can see into Palestine and you w so badly just hop on over you know I want to just cancel the the ticket and go over to to Israel but he said he told him he said don't go he was almost there he said don't go he said he called me from a plane went out behind the place and prayed and he said don't go now he said I'd love to see the day when we get in there and take all those thousands of Jews and say and now is it true that if he performs The Sign of the Prophet The Resurrection you will accept him go look out yourself out some men then and bring them in here let's see if he's the Messiah the same yesterday today and forever when the Lord would do as he's doing here he said I expect to see tens of thousands of Jews come to Christ at one time that was his expectation but God said don't go now and didn't explain to him why and it was after actually the seals were open and finally he's going to preach the seven trumpets remember and God said don't do that he told him to preach the Feast of the trumpets because he said all the trumpets sounded under the six seal and it was completely to the Jews it had nothing to do with us at all so after that he said this he in that sermon he said Brother Lou pet and them sent me those Bibles they give a million of them out to them Jews coming from Iran and everywhere coming back assembling themselves together become a nation I thought this is my time and he said don't do it now the hour is not yet he said then I returned home listen he said Moses and Elijah has got to call so it won't be brother brandom doing the sign of a prophet at all in Israel and brother Brandon couldn't separate that until after the opening of the word and so now he begins to see it he said he said see now the Feast of trumpets has to be known and this one over here in Malachi 4 is not connected with that one over there not at all not at all he said now watch here the ministry will be Moses and Elijah changing and calling Israel from the Jewish Traditions he said listen from the Jewish Traditions that they had been mixed up in being prophets they'll believe him calling them to the Feast of the atonement Christ letting them re recognize Christ they'll say he's coming he'll be here I notice what their Ministry is they'll be calling the Jews together the Jews will be gathering things like that and then when he comes say Here I Am see where'd you get them scars in the house of my friends he said the same as those two prophets did remember he said the Gentile bride us to have a prophet called Elijah is to call them out of their Traditions the bride he said just the same as these prophets called Jews out of Jew Judaism to Christ the atonement so there's three prophets at the end time one to the Gentiles and after he's gone and we're gone there will be two to the Jews and brother Bram goes on a little bit further down I don't have time to read all of it but he said the calling the seals which was to the Gentiles it had to be to the Gentiles to open up to the Gentile church he said that's all we know I love this everybody's trying to get into what well what's it going to be been how exactly is it going to happen to the Jews well we don't know because that's all we know is the seals right right because the trumpets were to the Jews right and all those things that happened during the tribulation period That's to those different groups but it's not to us he said he said that's all all we know is the seals that's all we know that's all we'll listen to what's already passed think about it church when the seals were opening it meant the church Ages were blending out right it doesn't just stop and start like what we think like today is the end of the church ages and tomorrow is the eternity right but it Blends together so at the opening of the felds in in 1963 the age begins to blend out right now we're still in the lean age how many you understand that around us we can see Leonia right we're still in that age but yet we're in a portion called the bride age that's the time that we live in it's the bride age we're living in that time that God has special favor on the bride that the fullness of the word has come back so we're we we're leaving this church age to go in Rapture we're on our way out the shouts already come oh church we just recognize where we're at there's already been a message come to call us out and he said all we all we know is what's already passed right so we're not looking that's why you can say I'm not looking for another Prophet I'm not looking for somebody to change anything I'm not looking for somebody to come along and have a a great Revival and call everybody and the whole nation's going to start serving the lord and that's not what we're looking for right that'd be wonderful but it's not going to happen right because all we'll listen to is what's already passed we look for Jesus that's our Focus that and listen church as long as we're right in our Doctrine I know we make mistakes and say things that are wrong but what we believe is that Jesus is coming make yourself ready if we can have one message that's what it is Jesus is coming make yourself ready because what we believe that's all we listen to what's already pass we look for Jesus I know I'm hammering down on that but it's important he said you say now wait a minute brother Brandon I believe they're going to do this he said the last sign that Abraham and we are the Royal Seed of Abraham the bride the last sign that Abraham ever seen before the promised son come was what God in a form of a human being that could discern the thoughts of the people one man not a dozen one man no matter how many impersonations he said they had one and he discerned the thoughts was in there what and the next thing happened oh where we at church but Jesus predicted there' be a delay remember there'd be a delay and during the delay the the servant would begin to Smite his fellow servants but he said Watch and Pray that's the hour that we're living in during that time of delay but the next thing is the coming of the Lord we're we're we're laying in the presence of the sun getting right you say nothing's happening well it's like a wheat field at the very end of harvest you don't see any discernable growth because the growth's on the inside not on the outside sure we we we still shout we still speak in tongues we still have gifts we still believe in those things but that's not the focus of this age the focus of this age is to make David White ready are you with me now ready for a Rapture oh that's a hard job isn't it but the word is going to do it because he's called from the foundation of the Earth the focus of this church and every message church is not to have a great big meeting although we love big meetings but that's not what that's not our focus our focus is to make each and every one of you ready to make me ready that's a big job to get me ready what's this message going to do that's why I preach the message that's why I get into the message of the hour because that's what's going to make us ready we want to be ready to go it's been on my heart lately have that body change it's coming and we know it could be any moment just in a moment in the twinkling of an eye let me be ready Lord and no matter how long we're here that's going to be the focus because every everything we can see is already passed except for the coming of the Lord he said the next thing happened was Abraham and Sarah turned back to a young man and woman listen we live in that third day look how close we are Hosea 62 after two days will he revive us speaking of the nation of Israel and the third day he will raise us up and we shall live in his sight where we at church we're living in that time amen we're living in that time now brother BR said as soon as this church the bride is drawned together she is taken up and remember we're not drawn together in one physical place on the Earth where are we Drawn Together in Christ in the word she's taken up and that mystery of the seventh seal or the seventh seal the mystery of going I love the way he puts that and the Jews is called by The Mystery of the seventh trumpet which is two prophets Elijah and Moses and they come back see people looking for brother brandom to come back he's not coming back Elijah and Moses are coming back to the Jews but the brandom don't have to come back why the seals are open that was our part are you with me and there is where the Pentecostals he said is all mixed up they're looking for something to happen the church is done gone and that's to the Jews so they asked for the brand will we see Miracles now brother brandom I think knew what they were talking about because the Pentecostals were always looking for some kind of miracle that would just bring a worldwide Revival we believe in miracles how many believe in miracles I'm a miracle you're a miracle we've seen Miracles we've seen God do things we believe we'll continue to see that till the coming of the Lord in fact I believe in many ways it'll increase as our faith increases as we become the word right it has to because we get closer and closer to him before we go go home we believe in miracles but brother random told us he said I believe we're seeing you're seeing the last thing that will happen to the church before the Rapture so the last public sign of his coming yes sir was the same one that Abraham got when he stood there and discerned the secrets of the heart you see why Satan would like to impersonate that because if he can impersonate that and get your focus off of the message the voice behind that particular sign the B said there would be many impersonations there was only one there was only one that God Called to do that to show that sign he said he said the rain is over he said just read he said well what about our latter rain well we it's the message of the hour it's the coming of the Lord yeah there's going to be a great Revival right a great Revival our bodies are changing amen right until then don't grow weary come on huh don't get dead don't get cold don't get complacent this isn't the hour to get complacent this isn't the hour to quit church it's the hour to be ready but we're not looking for if if you're waiting on somebody to do something to put you in Revival somebody's already done something to put you in Revival Jesus isn't going to come back and show us his nail scarred hands we're going home we're going to meet with him in the air we're being caught up together to meet him listen everything that we have need of we already have just look at it church it's already here listen we're not waiting on Joseph to reveal himself to us we're his wife we belong to him we've been married to Christ the word right but the Jews are waiting on something to happen and something big is going to happen to the nation of Israel brother brandom says that's what's promised the church he said he said the reain is over just read the first three chapters of Revelation you'll see what's promised to the church he said that's what's promised church right there the church ages he said you notice the other day when we started them Trumpets the holy spirit said that don't belong here and they'd ask about the latter rain so he said now latter rain 144,000 Jews know that he said that won't they that's when Elijah and Moses that's where the Miracles take place he said the things that the people's been looking for the Pentecost is for miracles he said that's where that'll take place in that under them he said that's Elijah and Moses they Smite the Earth with curses as off they will they close the heavens that it don't rain on the days of their prophecy and God will stand and fight for them like he did and he'll bring them out under a mighty hand just exactly like he did in Egypt out of these isms of the world and he'll do that but see when we get news coverage what do we get it for oh come on church we get news coverage in the message usually it's because somebody did something bad cuz there's rotten apples right that's just the truth we get news coverage most of the time in for that and and it wasn't any different in brother bram's time brother brandham said it's because he said they expose us because the others are too big to expose so the devil's always looking to expose something going on and guess what if you're looking for problems you can find them because we're just as human as any other group of people's ever been because these bodies haven't been changed yet but they're going to be changed one day not because of how righteous we are be but because of the the atonement that's in our midst the word atonement see that's why Israel why balum couldn't curse Israel it wasn't because listen to me church this is where we get off so many times we feel like our blessing comes from well I live in in such a good way I'm so good to people and I treat people so right that and I do everything just right and all my life I've done things in a right way and because of that that's where my blessing is not where your blessing comes from your blessing comes because there's an atonement right in the camp it doesn't come from being perfect it comes because there's an atonement and whenever you try to work your way into it you know what will happen you'll begin to separate yourself from fellowship separate yourself from people because you realize they're imperfect but after a while you realize you're imperfect too and pretty soon we're everybody's sitting off by themselves and all of us have known people like that they couldn't fellowship with nobody couldn't go to church nowhere why because they they they they think well I got to get ready for Rapture I got to be and and I got to be right in myself we want to be right but we're not right we don't we're not blessed because we're right we're blessed because of an atonement that we have the fullness of the word in our midst see bam failed to see a brass serpent he failed to see a smitten Rock but we can see it today with the the the mercy seats in plain view but one day the the papers and the oh not really papers today it's digital but one day they'll they'll view the B's life would have been impossible even in brother brandom's time for that to happen but the Bible says they'll the whole world will rejoice when the two prophets die in the same day that they die how will that happen I don't know if they'll live stream it or be on cable TV or how that'll happen but somehow everybody's going to see it and we have the technology today to do it they'll watch them die and be resurrected but that's not our Miracle our Miracle is to be changed and a moment in the twinkling of an eye and go home brother Brandon said we're just to wait on the coming of the Lord just wait oh that's tough isn't it is that hard somebody gets fidgety when you have to wait isn't it hard to wait some of you husbands know how hard it is to wait I my patience has been perfected my wife is is uh bless her heart she and and Peter takes after her so whoever marries Peter's in for it but uh they do everything slow and I do everything fast and I'm always too early nervous wound up anxious and and my wife does everything too slow but she's never never blate she's most of the time she's not late she's just on time and to me that's too slow right I I I've showed up for 5 years I've showed up 2 hours early for church it just just the way it is even if I've got nothing to do I show up just in case something might need to be done show up two hours early for church so we're but but waiting is hard believe me it's hard but he said just wait that's the hour we live in and while you wait keep your lamps trimmed all fil waiting doesn't mean but he said occupy till I come keep preaching keep singing keep raising your children keep planting your potatoes keep working at your job keep doing what's right but you got to wait keep your lamps trimmed all filled full of oil pray up watch what he says every hour every hour not every day every hour just keep ready be ready be sweet and watching oh that ought to that ought to Thrill all our hearts tonight just wait be ready be sweet and watching see it's the two prophets that's Revelation 11:6 where it tells us they have power to shut Heavens r on in the days of their prophets have power over Waters to turn them to blood to Smite the Earth with plagues as often as they will that's your Miracles 144,000 elect Jews will be there and they'll believe their word but where is the Gentile bride during that time go to Genesis 42:5 it says the sons of Israel came to buy corn among those that came for the famine was in the land of Canaan and Joseph was the governor over the land and he it was that sold to all the people of the land and Joseph's Brethren came and bowed down themselves before him with their faces to the Earth and Joseph saw his Brethren and he knew them but made himself strange unto them and spake roughly unto them and he said unto them whence Come Ye and they said from the land of Canaan to buy food and Joseph knew his Brethren but they knew him not knew not him now something had happened now watch he didn't yet know about Benjamin they were fixing to tell him about Benjamin but what's happening he dealing roughly with them because there's got to come a time that Benjamin comes before him and he reveals himself to him so there's a whole sagga like almost like a game that's being played we don't have time to go all into it tonight but Joseph begins to play all this game with them what for what purpose to see their attitude towards Benjamin right and it's during that time they begin to repent and all of those things so we know in the type the 10 are actually the 10 sons are actually under the altar right crying how long but they're given white robes what is it God made a way for the elect Jew that died during the hoola and during all of those times of persecution and they're under the Altar and that's the fifth seal right but now he there's going to be 144,000 at the end that's Benjamin who was born in the land born in Joseph's absence so Joseph accuses them of being spies and they said thy servants are 12 Brethren and the sons of one man in the land of Canaan behold the youngest is this day with our father and one is not now think about it Joseph that's where he learns about Benjamin eventually Benjamin comes before him in Genesis 43:29 it says he lift up his eyes and saw his brother Benjamin his mother's son and said brother BR said his mother was that Orthodox church right the the the Orthodox Jewish church will produce a Benjamin right who had nothing to do right was born in the land had nothing to do with the with the crucifixion of Christ nothing to do with throwing him in the pit but now what what what are they doing yet he's going to have mercy to them though that he could look at them in judgment but he's going to have mercy he's going to love them he said he looked he lifted up his eyes on his Benjamin he said is this your younger brother of whom you spake unto me and he said God be gracious unto thee my son and Joseph made haste for his bowels did yearn as his heart his insides yearn upon his brother he had to run out of the chamber he was so overcome with emotion he sought where to weep and he entered into his chamber and wept there you think God don't have a heart for his people he does am he does you can see how much he loved him and and the the brothers begin to realize what they had done and they begin to say oh you know we we're get in this trouble because of Joseph it's because of what we did to Joseph not even knowing that it was Joseph that was standing there and brother Brown said he spoke to him it's great the detail brother Brown goes into with this he said he spoke to him through an interpreter in an unknown tongue right but he said he understands unknown tongues he spoke to them and through an interpreter and they be to realize what they had done but before he could reveal himself to them he had to end his dealings with the Gentiles so what does he do genesis 451 then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him and he cried cause every man to go out from me and there stood no man with him while Joseph made himself known unto his Brethren brother BR said now where will the Gentile Church be while Jesus is making himself known to his Brethren remember that the Bride of Joseph with the two children were in the palace for Joseph had commanded let everyone leave me put them all out from before me so the Gentile bride was hidden in the Palace of Joseph all right that's why we're caught away in a secret amen a secret catching away sudden secret going away of the church we're hidden in the palace for our honeymoon right Joseph had commanded let everyone leave me put them all out before me the Gentile bride was hidden in the Palace of Joseph where will the Gentile Church go in the Rapture into the palace the bride will be taken off the Earth she will be caught up before the Great Tribulation to meet her Lord in the air for three and a half years while the r retributive wrath of God is poured out she will be in the great Mary supper of the Lamb then will he return now I love this because I'm I'm picturing in my mind because the way brother Brandon puts it in the seals he said he slips off right we're at the wedding supper and we're all rejoicing and wipes the tears from our eyes but he's got something to do brother BR said he slips away from the marriage supper to go down and meet Benjamin and reveal himself to Benjamin he said he will return leaving his bride in his father's house while he makes himself known to his Brethren he slips off from his honeymoon he said I got something I've got to do and he goes down to reveal himself for the day of atonement you talk about a Revival because they'll be they'll be have been having been Tau by the two prophets for three and a half years they'll be ready they'll be ready to receive him they'll be gathered together and they've seen the mighty works that God's done they'll be ready and he'll walk down there with nail scars right and again I don't know exactly but I like to than you just is literally going to go down with nail scars and just walk among them and they're going to look at him and said where did you get those scars but the B said they'll know that he was their Messiah but they don't know how he got the scars cuz they don't know nothing about church history they don't know hardly anything they've only been taught Jewish Orthodoxy right that Jesus was just a prophet and they said we know you're the Messiah where did you get the scars he'll say in the house of my friends and there will be a weeping Zachariah tells us a weeping and a wailing and a day of atonement but we're not waiting on our day of atonement don't you see it Church our day of atonement was on Mount calary amen that's the day he made an atonement for my sin he's coming back for a day of atonement for them to show them what he did but our faith in his atonement is on in in what's already done not in what's going to come but what's already done so right now we're as good as raptured right now we're as good as oh come on church right now we're in the best place we could possibly be in why because we've accepted that atonement we've he's already been revealed to us in the fullness of the word we're ready to meet him amen oh aren't you glad for that today it's time to go home church it's time to shake off the lethargy shake off shake off the the dullness of leoda it's time to quit playing church it's time to go home amen amen Joseph was an almost perfect type of Christ musicians go ahead and come an almost perfect type of Christ but we saw the antitype we saw Christ we have have been given our atonement and listen if this story tells us anything it ought to tell us if we were ever in his plans we will always be in his plants aren't you glad for his faithfulness has he been good to you amen hasn't he been good shouldn't we worship him for that is he worthy of that brother BR said in this time everything is worship I see hour are we living can we think can we sing when I think about the Lord amen everything is worship I want you to just close your eyes and sing with me if you want to stand you're welcome to tonight and we'll just sing for a minute if you need prayer we'll be glad to pray with you but aren't you aren't you thankful for what he's done for you can we just lift our our thoughts above the cares of the world for just a moment and say when I think about him I realize he's already made an atonement for me he's already revealed himself to me listen he's going to come down reveal himself to them but he has revealed himself to us in his word the Mercer seat came in plain view by the message of the hour listen to me I know you're going through some I know I know people do I realize as we get older things hurt and we get in trouble and and and many times when we're younger we we have all kinds of problems in life I realize that but if you could just lift your eyes above that and realize what he's done for you that can't ever change your job might change your situation might change your bank account might change even your family relationships might change people that once loved you may knock you in the back there may be all kinds of things happen but he said I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you he has revealed the Revelation that you have it's going to keep you he said I saw each one of them he said I've not lost a one of them all that you've given me he said will come to me everyone that's been born again of the baptism of the Holy Ghost in This Hour will go into Rapture he won't leave one oh that ought to that ought to make a think about him and say Lord I love you I thank you for what you've done amen let's sing it now oh when I think about the Lord oh how he saved me how he raised me how he filled me with the Holy Ghost how he healed me to the utmost when I think oh can you worship Him Church oh how he picked me up and turn me around how he placed my feet on it ground oh
