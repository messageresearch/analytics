[25:53] Heavenly Father, we just count it an
[25:55] honor and a privilege to stand before
[25:56] your presence this morning with humble
[25:59] hearts. Father, we just come to you. We

[26:39] You can be seated. It's all about you,
[26:43] Jesus.
[26:45] I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've

[26:53] you. Yes, it's all about you,
[27:01] [Music]
[27:05] Jesus. When the music
[27:09] fades and all is stripped away.
[27:14] And I simply
[27:19] come, longing just to
[27:24] bring something that's of worth that
[27:28] will bless your
[27:33] heart. I'll bring you more than a
[27:37] song. For a song in itself is not what
[27:42] you have
[27:44] [Music]
[27:47] required. You search much deeper
[27:51] within through the way things appear.
[27:55] You're looking into my
[28:01] heart. But I'm coming back to the heart
[28:05] of worship.
[28:08] And it's all about
[28:10] you. Yes, it's all about you,
[28:15] Jesus. I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I
[28:20] made it. And it's all about
[28:24] you. Yes, it's all about you, Jesus.
[28:30] [Music]
[28:37] King of endless
[28:41] world. No one could
[28:43] express how much you
[28:50] deserve. And though I'm weak and
[28:54] poor and all I have is yours.
[28:58] Every single
[29:03] breath I'll bring you more than a
[29:07] song. For a song in itself is not what
[29:12] you have
[29:17] required. You search much deeper
[29:21] within through the way things appear.
[29:25] You're looking into my
[29:30] heart. Well, I'm coming back to the
[29:34] heart of
[29:36] worship where it's all about you. Oh
[29:40] yes, it's all about you,
[29:44] Jesus. I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing
[29:49] I've made it. And it's all about you.
[29:54] Yes, it's all about singing the chorus
[29:57] again. But I'm coming back to the heart
[30:02] of
[30:03] worship where it's all about
[30:07] you. Yes, it's all about you,
[30:11] Jesus. I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing
[30:16] I've made it. Well, it's all about you.
[30:21] Yes. It's all about you,
[30:25] [Music]
[30:27] Jesus. Amen. Sister Robin, would you
[30:30] come sing for us this morning? She's got
[30:32] them grandb babiesies. It's hard to get
[30:33] up. Amen. Good to have brother Malachi
[30:36] with us. He spoke for us last Sunday
[30:37] night. Good to have you here, buddy.
[30:39] Amen. Always good to have the family.
[30:41] You know, Mother's Day is funny. You You
[30:43] lose some. They have to go be with their
[30:45] mothers and you gain some. So, y'all
[30:46] that are here this morning, we just
[30:48] enter in and worship with all our
[30:49] hearts. Can we do that? Amen. shall
[30:51] behold his
[30:55] face. Oh, and with him enter heaven
[31:03] city ever to
[31:06] [Applause]
[31:07] acclaim. What a lovely name. Let me hear
[31:11] you sing it now. Oh,
[31:14] what a lovely name. The name of Jesus.
[31:20] [Music]
[31:21] reaching higher
[31:22] [Music]
[31:24] far than the brightest
[31:27] [Applause]
[31:28] star. Oh, he be
[31:31] sweeter than the songs they sing in
[31:37] heaven. Let the saint
[31:42] proclaim. What a lovely name. With all
[31:44] your hearts now.
[31:46] Oh yes.
[31:48] One, a lovely name, the name of
[31:54] Jesus, reaching higher
[31:59] far than the brightest
[32:03] star. Oh, he's sweeter than all the
[32:07] songs they sing in
[32:11] heaven. that the saints
[32:16] proclaim. What a lovely
[32:21] name. Isn't his name lovely? Amen. As we
[32:24] invite the pastor this morning, we're
[32:25] going to sing. There's none like you.
[32:28] Amen. Do you believe that this morning?
[32:30] There's nobody like Jesus. You can look
[32:33] to where he brought you from to where
[32:34] you are now. And because we know who he
[32:37] is, it's my desire to live for him with
[32:40] all my heart. On Mother's Day, we think
[32:41] about, you know, if you don't have a
[32:42] mother here this morning, he can be your
[32:44] mother. You know, sometimes you find
[32:46] yourself in life and you don't have one
[32:48] to go to or call. I've seen the post on
[32:50] Facebook. They say, "Well, I wish I
[32:52] could call my mom, you know, and things
[32:54] like that." And we're all going to get
[32:55] there if the if the Lord carries. But if
[32:58] you think of it like this, he is my
[32:59] father. He's my mother. He's he's
[33:01] everything to me. So, we do we just want
[33:03] to say there's none like him this
[33:05] morning as the pastor comes. Also forgot
[33:07] to mention my my niece. She got married
[33:09] last week. She's here this morning with
[33:10] her husband, Matthew Dutton. And so,
[33:12] it's good to have them here this
[33:14] morning. And if I missed anybody, I'm so
[33:16] sorry. But God bless you all. Let's see.
[33:18] Let's just sing this. Are you ready for
[33:19] the word of the Lord this morning? Amen.
[33:21] How many's ready for the Lord? For the
[33:23] word of the Lord. Amen. I believe he can
[33:25] come and just walk down the aisles and
[33:26] speak to every heart. If you have a
[33:27] need, just hold it while the word goes
[33:29] forth. And I believe it will. The word
[33:31] still works. Do you believe it? Amen.
[33:33] Let's sing this with all our hearts now.
[33:35] Oh, I
[33:36] worship
[33:38] you,
[33:40] Almighty
[33:43] God. There is
[33:46] none. If you believe it, would you slip
[33:48] a hand up to him this
[33:50] morning? I
[33:52] worship
[33:54] you, oh
[33:56] prince of peace.
[34:01] That is what I long to
[34:06] do. I give you
[34:10] [Music]
[34:12] praise for you are my rightuousness.
[34:17] [Music]
[34:22] I
[34:23] worship
[34:25] you
[34:28] almighty
[34:31] God. There is none like
[34:35] you with all your hearts
[34:38] now. Oh, there is none like
[34:44] [Music]
[34:46] you. And no one else can touch my heart
[34:51] like you
[34:52] [Music]
[34:54] do. And I can search for only
[34:58] eternity
[35:00] long and I'd find there is none like
[35:06] singing one with all your hearts now.
[35:10] Oh, there is none like
[35:14] you and
[35:17] you. No one else can touch my heart like
[35:22] you
[35:23] do. Oh yes, I can search for all
[35:29] eternity
[35:30] long and I find there is none like you.
[35:36] Could we raise our hands to sing? I
[35:38] worship you. I worship
[35:42] you, oh
[35:45] mighty God. Oh
[35:48] yes, there is none like
[35:53] you. Oh, I
[35:56] worship you. You are my
[36:00] prince of peace. So I love you,
[36:04] Lord. Oh, that is what I long to do. Oh,
[36:10] I
[36:11] give you
[36:15] praise for you are my
[36:23] rightousness. Oh, I
[36:27] worship
[36:29] you, oh
[36:31] mighty God.
[36:34] Oh, there is
[36:36] none like
[36:40] you. Amen. Would you bow your heads with
[36:42] me for just a moment as we turn to the
[36:45] Lord in prayer? Heavenly
[36:47] Father, you are so good to us, Lord.
[36:51] We're so thankful that you've given us
[36:53] our mothers, Lord, our families. I'm so
[36:57] thankful for eternal life, Lord, that we
[37:00] know that we've been saved. Thank you
[37:03] for peace, Lord, that passes all
[37:05] understanding. When we see, Lord, the
[37:08] signs of the times and prophecy coming
[37:10] to pass all around us, Lord, but yet we
[37:14] are safe and secure in your arms. I
[37:17] thank you for that, Lord. Lord, that we
[37:19] know how it feels when we go to bed at
[37:21] night to know that you're with us, Lord.
[37:24] I I pray that each one that is here this
[37:27] morning would experience that kind of
[37:28] love, that kind of care. Lord, we just
[37:31] want people to know you like like we do,
[37:34] like you know us. Lord, I pray that
[37:36] you'd move this morning. Lord, move me
[37:39] out of the way. I'd be a poor
[37:41] representative of your grace to these
[37:43] people. Lord, I I I don't know what to
[37:45] say, but Lord, you know what to say. You
[37:48] know the need of every heart, Lord. If
[37:50] there'd be one that's sick or maybe one
[37:53] that's not where they should be with
[37:54] you, I pray you'd heal them, Lord. Heal
[37:57] our backsightings, oh God, where we've
[38:00] come away from you, Lord. May we come
[38:02] close to you this morning. I pray you'd
[38:04] grant and we thank you. In the name of
[38:06] the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen.
[38:10] Amen. God bless
[38:13] you.
[38:15] Hallelujah. Amen. It's good to be in the
[38:18] house of the Lord this morning. Good to
[38:21] see each and every one of you here with
[38:22] us. We're so privileged to be in the
[38:25] house of God and to see some of you and
[38:27] some of our mothers, my own mother here
[38:29] this morning and happy Mother's Day to
[38:31] you and Sister Batty, I see you over
[38:33] here and different ones that have
[38:34] already been mentioned and good to have
[38:36] you those of you come honor your mother.
[38:38] It's a wonderful thing to do. Thank you
[38:40] for being here, brother Braden. And I
[38:41] know that meant the world, Sister
[38:42] Jackie, God bless you all. We'll turn
[38:45] with to the scriptures in Isaiah chapter
[38:47] 66. Isaiah 66 and 13. Brother Peter, I
[38:51] can't hardly hear myself still. I can
[38:54] hear a little bit, but Isaiah
[38:57] 66:13 and verse
[39:03] 14. It's good to have my niece and I
[39:06] guess nephew with us this morning. It's
[39:09] good to have you all. He's a westerner.
[39:10] They're he's from Idaho and I guess
[39:12] they're going to go out there and live,
[39:13] but y'all are welcome back anytime to
[39:16] come and visit. And we sure love them
[39:18] and watch Gloria grow up. She was just a
[39:20] baby yesterday. Now she's married and
[39:23] that's hard to take because my own kids
[39:25] are getting to that age too. So we sure
[39:28] we sure love our family so much. Isaiah
[39:30] 66 and 13. As one whom his mother
[39:33] comforth, so will I comfort you, and ye
[39:37] shall be comforted in Jerusalem. And
[39:40] when you see this, your heart shall
[39:43] rejoice, and your bones shall flourish
[39:45] like an herb, and the hand of the Lord
[39:48] shall be known toward his servants, and
[39:51] his indignation toward his enemies. I
[39:54] pray the Lord would add his blessing to
[39:56] the word. You may be seated this
[39:58] morning. I want to speak to you about a
[40:00] mother's love expressing the love of God
[40:04] to us. A mother's love expressing the
[40:07] love of God.
[40:09] There's something about a mother that
[40:13] expresses the nature of God in a way
[40:16] that nothing else does. There's
[40:19] something uh that an attribute of God
[40:22] that is revealed in a mother and in the
[40:25] love of a mother in a way that's just we
[40:28] just don't see in other places. It's
[40:30] been said that there's five gospels.
[40:33] Brother Brandham taught us that. He said
[40:35] there was Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, and
[40:38] mother. And he said before Matthew,
[40:41] Mark, Luke, and John get to our
[40:43] children, mother gets to them. And and
[40:46] the reason that that's so important is
[40:48] because before that baby can ever even
[40:50] have a a a cognizant thought, before
[40:53] they can ever even uh even feel or or
[40:56] know what they're feeling or before they
[40:58] can ever even know uh what they're doing
[41:00] or before they ever say a word, they
[41:03] they feel and they know a mother's love.
[41:06] And that is something about that that
[41:08] expresses the love of God to that child.
[41:11] that they may forget everything else
[41:12] that they know, but but they're still
[41:14] drawn to that. There's still something
[41:16] that pulls them to that. I'm so thankful
[41:19] for that today. That's that's the nature
[41:21] of a mother's love expressed by or
[41:24] expressing the love of God. And and I
[41:27] believe that the nature of that of a
[41:29] mother's love. And I I think you'll all
[41:32] agree with me this morning that a
[41:33] mother's love to her children is without
[41:37] condition. Right? There's something
[41:39] about a mother's love that to her
[41:41] children, you don't have to earn it. You
[41:44] don't have to you don't have to uh
[41:46] deserve it. You don't have to uh work
[41:50] your way into it. But there's something
[41:52] about the love of a mother that she
[41:54] loves you because of who you are because
[41:57] that's the baby. And she loves you
[41:59] because you're her baby and you'll
[42:00] always be her baby. And she loves you
[42:03] without conditions. When Paul describes
[42:06] agape love in 1 Corinthians 13, he says
[42:10] in verse 5, he says, "It does not behave
[42:13] itself
[42:15] unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not
[42:19] easily provoked, thinkketh no evil,
[42:23] rejoicth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth
[42:26] in the truth, beareth all things,
[42:28] believeth all things, hopeeth all
[42:30] things, endureth all things." And he's
[42:32] speaking of divine love. He's saying
[42:34] this is the attributes of divine love as
[42:38] expressed in agape love. That's the love
[42:40] of God. And so he said this is the
[42:42] attributes. This is what love is. Did
[42:45] you notice verse five? It says seeketh
[42:47] not her own. Have you ever noticed that?
[42:51] Sekeeth not her own. It speaks of
[42:54] something feminine. Now we know in the
[42:56] beginning that God when God made Adam,
[42:58] he made him male and female and and he
[43:01] created him. So he had uh he was he was
[43:03] a a man created and was first created a
[43:06] spirit and then he become a a man and
[43:09] and brother Brandham talked about how
[43:11] that he had both the feminine and
[43:13] masculine spirit in him and then those
[43:16] were separated that they were separated
[43:18] into a man and a woman and Eve come out
[43:20] of his side. And so we we find that uh
[43:23] and that's the way it still is that the
[43:25] mascul man should be masculine and the
[43:27] woman should be feminine. But it's not
[43:29] just the man that was made in the image
[43:31] of God. Remember, brother Brandham said
[43:33] it was the spirit that was made in the
[43:35] image of God. It's not the flesh that's
[43:38] made in the image of God, but it's
[43:39] actually the spirit man. He said because
[43:42] God was the spirit that was made in the
[43:43] image of God. So, while he was had that
[43:45] that that feminine characteristic, there
[43:48] was something about God that wanted to
[43:50] be expressed. So, you you couldn't have
[43:52] the gospel without a mother. There had
[43:54] to be a woman that come that that that
[43:56] bore Jesus. There had to be a virgin
[43:59] that would conceive. There had to be a
[44:01] woman's seed that would bruise the head
[44:03] of the serpent. And and so there was
[44:05] this part of of of God, if we could say
[44:07] that, that would be expressed not in a
[44:09] man or even in a father, but in a
[44:12] mother, right? And only expressed in
[44:14] that. So, and yet it's a characteristic
[44:17] of love in general that we could all
[44:19] have now. Uh but it's you see it in a
[44:22] mother. It comes natural to a mother.
[44:25] They don't have to put it on. But do you
[44:27] notice what it says? It says, "Seekth
[44:29] not her own." Seeketh not her own. I
[44:34] want you to look at that in the
[44:35] amplified version. Says, "It is not
[44:38] conceited, arrogant, and inflated with
[44:40] pride. It is not rude, unmannerly. Does
[44:44] not act be unbecomingly love. God's love
[44:48] in us." Oh, don't you want God's love in
[44:51] you? That's what we want. We want to see
[44:53] God's love displayed in us. He it says
[44:56] God's love in us does not insist on its
[44:59] own rights or its own way for it is not
[45:05] selfseeking.
[45:07] Seketh not her own. It is not
[45:11] self-seeking. It is not touchy or
[45:14] fretful or resentful.
[45:17] Oh my. It takes no account of the evil
[45:20] done to it. It pays no attention to a
[45:24] suffered wrong.
[45:26] And some of y'all can think back right
[45:28] now to things that have gone on in your
[45:30] family. You can look back at your mother
[45:31] and you can see the things that she's
[45:33] been through. And you can say, I know
[45:35] that my there was a quality of that in
[45:37] my mother that she had that maybe I
[45:39] didn't see in anyone else in the family,
[45:41] but I could see that mom was not seeking
[45:43] her own self-g good. She was not she
[45:46] didn't do what she did for herself. She
[45:48] did what she did for me and for her
[45:50] other children. A and so she did not
[45:52] seek her own. And there's a quality of
[45:54] God about that. There's something about
[45:56] there's something uh something divine
[45:58] about that seeketh not her own. And
[46:01] another version it says it does not
[46:03] insist on its own way.
[46:06] Right? Love does not insist on its own
[46:09] way. It is not selfish.
[46:14] John Calvin when he wrote about this he
[46:16] said we're the only thing required of us
[46:19] to seek not our own. In other words, if
[46:21] all that we had to do was not seek our
[46:23] own, we couldn't do it.
[46:27] Because nature would not have the least
[46:29] power to comply because just in the
[46:31] natural in the flesh, we we don't we we
[46:34] seek our own, right? The the the flesh
[46:37] wants, if you don't believe that, get a
[46:39] a toddler, right? And look at a toddler.
[46:42] What is a toddler doing? A toddler
[46:44] doesn't care. They don't care if they
[46:45] interrupt dinner. They don't care if
[46:46] they they wake you up in the middle of
[46:48] the night and and ask you for something.
[46:50] They're not thinking about you when they
[46:51] do that. Who are they thinking about?
[46:53] Themselves,
[46:54] right? The toddler is completely
[46:56] thinking about themselves. God forbid
[46:58] that we would grow up and be like that.
[47:00] But but but the toddler, that's the way
[47:02] they do. They're just that way. They
[47:05] don't they seek their own because that's
[47:06] the natural thing to do. But there's
[47:08] something God put in a mother when she
[47:10] becomes a mother that causes her to do
[47:13] things that would actually hurt her. Do
[47:15] you realize even having children would
[47:17] bring damage to the body of a mother?
[47:19] What makes her do that? Makes what makes
[47:21] her want to have children? What makes
[47:23] her want to raise children? What makes
[47:25] her want to do things and work from sun
[47:27] up to sun down and do the things that a
[47:29] virtuous woman does? It's something
[47:31] about her that seeketh not her own.
[47:35] Oh my. It's completely selfless. Just by
[47:40] our nature, we would not have the least
[47:41] power to do that. Our nature inclines us
[47:45] to love ourselves only. And it will not
[47:47] allow us carelessly to pass by ourselves
[47:50] and our own interests that we may watch
[47:52] over the interests of others or to
[47:54] spontaneously yield our own rights and
[47:56] resign it to
[47:58] another. Oh my. But love is completely
[48:02] selfless, especially as it is expressed.
[48:05] Yes. Through motherhood. Yes. A mother
[48:09] loves when she is not loved.
[48:13] I I think this is true. There's a story
[48:15] that I heard that a a teacher was asking
[48:17] a boy a question. He said he said,
[48:19] "Suppose your mother baked a pie and
[48:21] there were seven of you and and your
[48:23] parents and five children." He's trying
[48:25] to teach him fractions. He said, "You
[48:27] had your parents and five children."
[48:29] Said, "What part of the pie would you
[48:31] get?" The boy said, "A six. One sixth."
[48:35] And and the the man said, "I'm afraid
[48:36] you don't know your fractions. Remember,
[48:38] there's seven of you." He said, 'Yes,
[48:40] said the boy. But you don't know my
[48:44] mother. Mother would say she didn't want
[48:46] any pie.
[48:49] You ever seen that attribute in a
[48:50] mother, right? That she'll she'll claim
[48:53] she don't want to eat so you can eat,
[48:56] right? She's not worried about her own
[48:58] comfort. She wants to see her baby
[49:01] comfortable. She wants to see her
[49:03] children, even when they're grown, she
[49:05] wants to see them comfortable. You go in
[49:06] the house and mama ask you, "Have you
[49:08] had anything to eat?" Well, she's been
[49:10] doing that since you were a baby. Yeah.
[49:13] Right. That's why she still does it.
[49:14] It's that mother instinct in her. She
[49:16] wants to She wants to feed you. She
[49:18] wants to make sure you're okay. And you
[49:20] might be a big old boy. You might be as
[49:22] big as me and walk in there and mama
[49:23] say, "Have you had enough to eat?" Mom
[49:26] my mama worries constantly about me that
[49:28] I might waste away. You
[49:33] know, have you
[49:36] Come on, church. We've all experienced
[49:37] that, right? But what is that? There's
[49:39] something. And we look at that say,
[49:41] "Well, that's just the nature of a
[49:42] mother." But where does that come from?
[49:44] It don't come from the world. It don't
[49:46] come even from the flesh, but it comes
[49:47] from God.
[49:50] It's an attribute of of love. Listen, if
[49:53] a mother got her feelings hurt every
[49:56] time she was underappreciated,
[50:00] taken for
[50:01] granted or or every time she gave
[50:04] without getting anything in return,
[50:06] she'd go insane.
[50:10] Because most of what a mother does, we
[50:12] don't appreciate.
[50:14] We give her a card on Mother's Day and
[50:15] then we just kind of let it go, you
[50:17] know.
[50:19] But we really don't appreciate what a
[50:21] mother does. I think that's true of
[50:22] fathers as well. We don't really
[50:23] appreciate what a father does. Many
[50:25] times in the home, but we really don't
[50:27] appreciate what a mother does. It just
[50:28] it just happens. And especially we're
[50:30] trying to teach our teenagers, you know,
[50:32] as they get older, you don't realize how
[50:34] good you've got it. We work really hard
[50:36] to put things in a position where you
[50:38] can have the freedom that you do and and
[50:40] do the things that you do. And yet it
[50:42] just seems like many times it's
[50:43] unappreciated. But but yet uh you know,
[50:46] a mother, she don't she just forgets
[50:48] about it, right? You can be you can come
[50:50] in and not appreciate her and the next
[50:53] time you see her, she would love you
[50:54] just as much. All right. Yeah.
[50:57] She just forgets it because a mother's
[51:00] love is not transactional.
[51:04] She doesn't love her baby because of
[51:05] what the baby can give her. The baby is
[51:08] completely helpless.
[51:10] And if she does that, she wouldn't be a
[51:12] real mother.
[51:13] Oh my. Listen, brother Brandon was
[51:15] talking about a mother's love. And he
[51:17] said this. He talked about he talked to
[51:18] a mother on the telephone and the mother
[51:20] told him said my poor boy is in trouble.
[51:22] Oh, what a trouble he's in. And brother
[51:24] Brandham said he she said he may be
[51:26] wrong. I don't know. One says this and
[51:28] one says that. But she said no matter
[51:30] whether he's wrong or right, I love him.
[51:32] Yeah. He said there you are. I love him.
[51:35] He said to his mother said, "I've been
[51:36] so deceived by this and that." Said,
[51:38] "Mother, I believe you're about the only
[51:39] sweetheart I really have. A woman that's
[51:41] true to me and sticks to me." He said,
[51:42] "That's mother's love." He said, "That's
[51:44] a real mother that'll put her arms
[51:46] around her baby. Regardless whether he's
[51:48] right or wrong, she goes right on
[51:51] through." Because whether that boy's
[51:53] right or wrong, whether that girl's
[51:54] right or wrong, doesn't matter. Still
[51:56] her baby.
[51:58] I'm going to challenge your thinking
[52:00] here this morning. Do you realize how
[52:02] God thinks about you? He doesn't think
[52:04] about you in a transactional way. He
[52:06] doesn't look at his elect and say,
[52:07] "Well, I love them when they're good,
[52:09] and I don't love them when they're bad.
[52:11] I love them when they when they're when
[52:12] they're living right and I don't love
[52:13] them when they're not living right. But
[52:15] he looks at his elect and he says, "I
[52:16] love you. I love you on Monday and on
[52:18] Tuesday and on Wednesday all the way to
[52:20] Friday and Saturday and Sunday." That's
[52:22] why we don't give up on God's people. No
[52:24] matter how dark they may get, no matter
[52:26] how deep they may go in sin, we don't
[52:28] ever give up on God's people because the
[52:31] elect of God, hallelujah, every one of
[52:33] them is going to be around his table.
[52:35] He's not going to lose a one, right? His
[52:37] love is not transactional. And if we get
[52:40] that out of our minds and take all the
[52:42] fear away from us and we can begin to
[52:44] worship God like we ought to and love
[52:46] him like we ought to.
[52:50] It's legalism. Just transactional. Well,
[52:52] he loves you, but he loves you for a
[52:54] while, but if you do this, he won't love
[52:56] you. No, if he ever loves you, always
[52:59] will love you. Amen. Amen. Listen, your
[53:03] mother may not love other people like
[53:05] she loves you, but she loves you cuz
[53:07] you're her family. Yeah. The elect is
[53:09] God's family. You belong to God. You
[53:12] didn't choose yourself. You didn't birth
[53:14] yourself into the kingdom of God. He
[53:16] birthed you into the kingdom of God. And
[53:18] if you're God's, he will you can't get
[53:20] away from him. You may go, you may run
[53:22] as hard as you can run. You may be like
[53:24] Jonah running and going as far as you
[53:26] can in the opposite direction of God's
[53:28] will. And he'll make it work out for his
[53:30] perfect will because that's what my God
[53:32] does. Yes. Yes. That's right.
[53:36] Hallelujah. It's that attribute of
[53:38] divine love. He doesn't say, "If you
[53:39] love me, I'll love you back." But he
[53:42] says, "I love you." Yes.
[53:45] Yes. Hallelujah.
[53:48] See, a mother would rather lose an
[53:50] argument than a child.
[53:52] Yeah.
[53:54] I hope you're listening to me now. Think
[53:56] of Solomon and the custody dispute. Do
[53:58] you remember that? Two women come up
[54:01] before Solomon. Both of them bad women,
[54:05] but one of them had become a mother.
[54:09] They were both prostitutes, but one of
[54:12] them become a
[54:14] mother. And and while she was sleeping,
[54:17] the one took the baby from the other
[54:19] one, stole it.
[54:21] And so Solomon in his wisdom, he said,
[54:24] "Okay." He said, "You both claim the
[54:26] baby. Let's just cut it in half."
[54:31] And this other woman so dark
[54:35] and steeped in and whatever sin that she
[54:39] was committing and she she's there she
[54:41] said go ahead just to win this argument
[54:44] to say that I won like split the baby in
[54:47] two
[54:50] and the and the mother said first Kings
[54:53] 3:26 then spake the woman who's the
[54:55] living child was unto the king for her
[54:57] bowels that's her her heart her her
[54:59] inward inward person all that she was
[55:03] yearned upon her son she said oh my lord
[55:05] give her the living child in no wise say
[55:08] it but the other said let it be neither
[55:11] mine nor thine but divide it in other
[55:13] words I'm going to win this argument
[55:14] even if it cost me my children
[55:17] but a mother don't do that right and the
[55:20] king answered and said give her the
[55:21] living child and no wife say it she is
[55:24] the mother thereof
[55:27] how much better. I I want to bring this
[55:29] out a little bit, not just to mothers
[55:30] this morning, but how much better would
[55:32] all of our lives be if we focused on the
[55:34] well-being of others? If we sought not
[55:37] our own, but we said, "What can I do to
[55:39] help the kingdom of God? What can I do
[55:40] to help my family? What can I do instead
[55:42] of trying to promote myself and working
[55:44] so hard to make sure I I achieve this
[55:47] position or that position or this thing
[55:49] in work or this much money? What if I
[55:51] tried everything I could to help
[55:53] somebody else?" Yes.
[55:56] See, the Bible tells us in Ecclesiastes
[55:58] 11:1, "Cast thy bread upon the waters,
[56:01] for thou shalt find it after many days."
[56:06] Brother Brandham tells us you'll it'll
[56:07] come back to you buttered. I love
[56:10] that sir. Cast your bread on the water,
[56:14] for you'll find it after many days. Come
[56:17] on now. See, what you give is what
[56:20] you're going to get.
[56:22] And a mother when a mother gives
[56:24] unreservedly that's why her children
[56:26] love her
[56:28] unreservedly and it seemed like there's
[56:30] such a love for a mother many times
[56:32] because that's the love that she's given
[56:35] and that's the love that she
[56:38] receives and you know many times in
[56:41] wanting to be loved and excuse me for
[56:45] just expressing my heart to you this
[56:47] morning. Yeah. But in the meantime, we
[56:50] deal with family troubles and things and
[56:52] and all of us will have trouble from
[56:54] time to time. There will be
[56:55] misunderstandings and things and as a
[56:57] pastor, we deal with family troubles and
[56:59] things that come up. And and one of the
[57:00] things I've noticed is that is that if
[57:04] you want to be
[57:05] loved, the worst thing you can do is try
[57:09] to force someone to love you.
[57:12] It's actually the the the worst way to
[57:14] be loved is to try to guilt trip people.
[57:18] or constantly remind people you don't
[57:20] love me, you don't love me. Right? It's
[57:23] the worst way. It just creates an
[57:24] anxiousness and an
[57:26] anxiety. You can't make somebody love
[57:28] you.
[57:30] But if you That's true of marriage, too.
[57:33] You know, if that person's spirit gets
[57:35] on that person and they they want to
[57:36] leave and they want to go out and do
[57:37] something wrong and many times you
[57:40] you're standing there and what do you
[57:42] do? Well, what what can you do? Well, if
[57:44] you stand there suspicious all the time
[57:46] saying, "Well, I know you're not where
[57:48] you ought to be and you need to love me
[57:49] and you need to care for me and that's
[57:52] not the way to do it." But if you just
[57:53] love that person, love them and and
[57:56] really care for them, show them love,
[57:58] many times you'll win them back. But if
[58:00] you give people the cold shoulder out of
[58:02] a desire to be loved, it actually
[58:04] compounds the problem.
[58:07] Yeah. Right. So, you want to be loved.
[58:08] So, it's like, I won't speak to you
[58:10] until you love me. Right.
[58:14] But love seeketh not her own. I think
[58:17] I'm talking to some people this morning.
[58:20] Love seeketh not her own. So if you want
[58:23] to be loved, you love. And I understand
[58:24] there's some situation that are so toxic
[58:27] you can't you you can't put yourself in
[58:29] the middle of that battle, right? You've
[58:31] got to stand off for a while. Even the
[58:33] man in the church that Paul talked about
[58:35] that had to be had to be put away for a
[58:37] while. Don't even eat with him and had
[58:39] to be taken out from under the
[58:40] protection of the church. But when he
[58:41] repented, what did he do? He he wrote to
[58:44] the church. He said, "I want you you to
[58:45] make sure that you love him. I want you
[58:47] to make sure that you reach your arms
[58:49] out to him." I want you to make sure he
[58:50] feels welcome in the house of God
[58:52] because no matter what you've done, if
[58:54] you've repented and come back to God,
[58:56] you got a right to be in the house of
[58:57] God. Yes.
[59:00] Right. But many times people are like,
[59:02] "Well, if I, you know, they're going to
[59:04] leave the church, so I'll treat them
[59:06] badly till they come back."
[59:09] Well, that's not the way to treat them.
[59:13] Treat them with love. Well, my kids
[59:15] getting, you know, 18 or 20 years old
[59:18] and they're whatever they are and I'm
[59:21] just going to crack down on them. And
[59:23] now's the time. But brother Random
[59:24] taught us different. Treat them with
[59:25] love.
[59:27] Right? Are you with me this morning?
[59:31] See, the Bible says, "Give and it shall
[59:33] be given unto you good measure." I love
[59:37] this. pressed down, shaken together. So,
[59:41] in other words, he's not just going to
[59:43] take the if if you they were measuring
[59:44] out maybe flour or something like that,
[59:46] he's not going to take it and just just
[59:48] hand it to you, but he's going to it's
[59:50] going to be given back to you and it's
[59:52] going to be pressed down, more poured
[59:54] in, pressed down again, shaken together,
[59:57] making sure that every inch of its
[59:58] filled. You might have give you you you
[1:00:01] give, but they give the same thing and
[1:00:03] it's shaken down, shaken together,
[1:00:05] running over. shall men give into your
[1:00:06] bosom. For with the same measure that
[1:00:08] you meet with all, it shall be measured
[1:00:11] to you again. And so if we want to be
[1:00:15] loved, we should stop punishing people
[1:00:17] for not loving us. That's right. Good.
[1:00:21] Right. If you want to be loved, just
[1:00:24] love people.
[1:00:27] God help me today. I'm I'm preaching to
[1:00:29] myself as well. I'm preaching to a lot
[1:00:31] of us dads, right? who want something in
[1:00:34] return because maybe it don't come as
[1:00:35] naturally to us, right? To just love
[1:00:38] without reservation. But God loved you.
[1:00:41] Yes. Come on now.
[1:00:45] See, a mother's love is it's like God's
[1:00:47] love. It's not quidd proquo. In other
[1:00:49] words, you scratch my back, I'll scratch
[1:00:50] yours. Or what have you done for me
[1:00:52] lately? It's corrective, but it never
[1:00:56] fails. Right. Right. A mother, a mother
[1:01:00] who will allow her children to just do
[1:01:02] anything. She's not a real mother. A
[1:01:04] real mother will have a corrective love,
[1:01:06] but yet she won't be like Herodius who
[1:01:08] taught her daughter to dance and all the
[1:01:10] things that she did. A real mother won't
[1:01:12] do those things. Real mother corrects
[1:01:14] her children, but she will she she will
[1:01:17] uh she will not do it by manipulation.
[1:01:21] Does this make sense? Like God doesn't
[1:01:23] manipulate us. He loves us,
[1:01:27] right? He he don't he don't come and
[1:01:29] say, "Well, now you know now that you've
[1:01:31] done wrong, I'm going to just punish you
[1:01:34] cuz I like to do that." You know, and
[1:01:36] and for a little while, you're just I'm
[1:01:38] just going to be punished. And no, his
[1:01:40] love is so great that it's the moment
[1:01:44] you sin, listen, he's not putting you
[1:01:47] off. He's not sitting back and saying,
[1:01:50] "Well, I'm going to make them wait."
[1:01:52] He's waiting on you. Yes.
[1:01:56] When the prodigal son come running, the
[1:01:58] father didn't didn't he now he didn't go
[1:02:01] out in the hog pin. He stayed at home.
[1:02:04] But when he saw
[1:02:06] his his prodigal come running, he didn't
[1:02:09] put him off and say, "Prove yourself."
[1:02:10] He didn't come and say, "Well, now you
[1:02:12] wait for 10 years and and make sure you
[1:02:14] do what your older brother's done and
[1:02:15] then you can be saved, too." No. What
[1:02:17] did he do? He ran to him and and the and
[1:02:20] the son said, "Let me be like a
[1:02:21] servant." But he said, "You're not a
[1:02:23] servant. You're a son. Bring the fatted
[1:02:25] calf. Kill the fatted cap. Bring me a
[1:02:27] robe. Bring me a ring." Ain't that the
[1:02:30] way God did to you when you come back to
[1:02:32] God? Every time you've ever backsided on
[1:02:34] God, he was there waiting on you, ready
[1:02:36] for you to come back. He's a gentleman.
[1:02:38] He won't force himself on you. But his
[1:02:40] presence was there, Sister Pat, when you
[1:02:42] were ready to come back. He was ready.
[1:02:44] Hallelujah.
[1:02:46] He was ready to receive you. Amen.
[1:02:49] Brother Brandon said he wants to give
[1:02:50] you the Holy Ghost more than you want to
[1:02:51] receive it. Oh our church, if you only
[1:02:54] knew the love of God this morning for
[1:02:55] you, he sent you the message of the hour
[1:02:58] to tell you what was going to happen in
[1:02:59] the day that we live in. Spoke prophecy
[1:03:01] that's coming to pass in this hour. What
[1:03:03] was it? God loves you so much and he
[1:03:06] gives you these things to see. You need
[1:03:07] to get ready. You need to get you need
[1:03:09] to be right. You need to be ready to go.
[1:03:11] He He loves us so much. Yes. That he
[1:03:14] shows us all of these things. He will
[1:03:17] not force himself on us, but the moment
[1:03:19] you're ready Yeah. He'll be there. Yes.
[1:03:24] Right. Very good. It might be the last
[1:03:28] moment of time. Yes. The minute before
[1:03:32] the rapture,
[1:03:34] but if you're God's bride, he'll be
[1:03:35] there.
[1:03:38] Very good. God doesn't correct by
[1:03:41] manipulation.
[1:03:43] But you know, even a mother's love might
[1:03:45] fail.
[1:03:46] We know that there are people who call
[1:03:48] themselves mothers, who have children,
[1:03:49] who don't have the right kind of love.
[1:03:52] But God's love never fails.
[1:03:56] The Bible says, "Can a woman forget her
[1:03:58] sucking child that she should not have
[1:04:00] compassion on the son of her womb? Yay,
[1:04:03] they may forget, yet will I not forget
[1:04:06] thee." Yes. He said, "I've graven thee
[1:04:10] upon the palms," Yes. of my hands.
[1:04:13] Listen, our names are in the nail
[1:04:15] prints.
[1:04:18] Glory to God. We We were We were that
[1:04:21] part of him that was released that day.
[1:04:23] Remember the blood and the and the
[1:04:24] spirit separated. We were that part of
[1:04:26] him that was released. He said the
[1:04:29] feminist part of God was separated.
[1:04:30] That's us, the bride. Yes.
[1:04:33] Amen. It was released from him there on
[1:04:35] Calvary. We were in him. We died in him.
[1:04:38] So, you can't be judged for your sin. I
[1:04:40] know many people that think, well, if if
[1:04:42] I'm a Christian, but if I do something
[1:04:44] wrong, then God will punish me. How can
[1:04:45] you be punished for something he never
[1:04:47] saw? Your sins weren't paid for
[1:04:49] yesterday. They weren't paid for even at
[1:04:51] the moment you got saved. Your sins were
[1:04:53] paid for on the cross, and you were in
[1:04:55] him on the cross. For the man who taught
[1:04:57] us that in Christ is the mystery of God
[1:04:58] revealed. You were the mystery hidden in
[1:05:00] Christ.
[1:05:02] You young people, listen to me. You
[1:05:04] can't get away from God's love. You
[1:05:06] might run, but you can't hide. All
[1:05:07] right.
[1:05:09] Yes.
[1:05:12] I think of I don't want to take long
[1:05:14] this morning. I really don't have that
[1:05:16] many notes, but I'm reminded of Brother
[1:05:19] Brandham when one time he he his plane
[1:05:22] got stopped. The check engine light come
[1:05:24] on on the plane and over Memphis.
[1:05:28] God knows what he's doing.
[1:05:32] and his prophet was stopped at Memphis
[1:05:36] and they put him up in the Peabody Hotel
[1:05:37] and said, "We'll send a a car for you in
[1:05:39] the morning and at a certain time." And
[1:05:42] so he gets up in the morning and he got
[1:05:44] a little time. So he goes out to mail a
[1:05:46] letter. And brother Brandham, there's a
[1:05:48] detail about that that I hadn't really
[1:05:50] noticed before, but brother Brandon said
[1:05:51] he was the Lord told him said, "Turn
[1:05:54] around, go the other way." And he turns
[1:05:57] around to go the other way. He said he
[1:05:58] stopped for a while. He sat at a at a uh
[1:06:02] a window and there was some fishing
[1:06:04] reels and brother Brandham was in
[1:06:06] downtown Memphis somewhere just like we
[1:06:08] do at Bass Pro, right? You know, just
[1:06:11] Brother Brandon was in downtown Memphis
[1:06:12] looking at them fishing reels and he
[1:06:14] says he feels an he sees an Irish cop
[1:06:17] and he says, "I'm hanging around this
[1:06:18] window so much." He said, "I I thought
[1:06:19] that cop was going to think I was trying
[1:06:21] to steal them." Have you ever felt
[1:06:23] guilty in a
[1:06:25] store? That's what brother Brandon felt.
[1:06:28] But he didn't know what God was speaking
[1:06:29] to him. He didn't know what to do. But
[1:06:31] God just said, "Walk. Just go." So he
[1:06:34] leaves there. I think God had that cop
[1:06:36] there at that window for that reason.
[1:06:37] Because at a certain time, God's prophet
[1:06:39] had to come by a certain house. He said
[1:06:42] he walked down. He was seeing one of
[1:06:44] them, one of them. He said he looked
[1:06:46] over. He said there was a regular anga
[1:06:48] standing there by the fence and said she
[1:06:50] was she was standing there and she said,
[1:06:52] "Good morning, Parson."
[1:06:56] He said, "Good morning." He said he
[1:06:58] didn't stop. He said her her her scarf
[1:07:01] was wet with the dew. She'd been
[1:07:03] standing there waiting on
[1:07:06] him. And so she's uh she's standing
[1:07:09] there and she said, "Good morning,
[1:07:10] Parson." He said, "How did you know I
[1:07:11] was a parson?" Amen. She said, "I was
[1:07:14] like thisite woman." She said, "I I
[1:07:16] prayed for a son. God gave me a son."
[1:07:19] And she said, "I and and and he went out
[1:07:22] and did the things that he did." She
[1:07:23] said, "But but now he's he's dying." And
[1:07:26] she said, "If I'm" She said, "Lord, if
[1:07:28] I'm the Shunomite woman, you gave me a
[1:07:29] son. Where is your Elijah?"
[1:07:33] Hallelujah. And the prayer of that
[1:07:35] mother stopped God's prophet in the air.
[1:07:38] Are you with me now? Caused him to come
[1:07:41] down and and didn't even know why he was
[1:07:43] there, but God led him right to her
[1:07:45] door.
[1:07:46] And he said he went in there and began
[1:07:48] to pray. He said, "Mother," he said,
[1:07:49] "you pray first." He said, "When she
[1:07:52] prayed," he said, "I knew that she'd
[1:07:53] talked to God before.
[1:07:56] And she began to pray and pray for her
[1:07:59] baby. And she said, "She called him my
[1:08:00] baby. My baby." And brother Brandon
[1:08:02] picks up on that. And whenever he tells
[1:08:04] the story, he says this. He said, "But
[1:08:05] you know," he said, "there's a mother's
[1:08:07] love." Now, this young man had been a
[1:08:09] bad young man. He'd went out and got a a
[1:08:11] a sexually transmitted disease. He he
[1:08:13] he'd gotten in trouble and gotten in and
[1:08:15] a lot of he was in a lot of pain and and
[1:08:18] it was his own fault.
[1:08:20] But mama still loved him.
[1:08:24] Amen. Mama still loved him. He said,
[1:08:26] "You know," he said, "That's a mother's
[1:08:28] love." He said, "You're always mama's
[1:08:29] baby." You know that mother's love, no
[1:08:31] matter what you do, it's never forgotten
[1:08:33] the mother's love. He said, "There you
[1:08:36] are, a mother's love. No matter what he
[1:08:37] had done, still that mother's love
[1:08:39] reaches on out for her child." He said,
[1:08:41] "And if a mother's love would do that,
[1:08:44] what will the love of God do?" How many
[1:08:46] of us can testify this morning? It
[1:08:48] wasn't just a mother's love that reached
[1:08:50] out to us, but the love of God reached
[1:08:52] down in my situation, pulled me out of
[1:08:54] what I was and made me a new creature in
[1:08:57] Christ.
[1:08:58] Hallelujah. Unconditional love. Yes.
[1:09:03] Amen. Hallelujah. See, a mother's love
[1:09:06] when it's right because of its
[1:09:08] unconditional nature removes fear from
[1:09:12] the equation. Oh my. Yeah.
[1:09:15] And right and you you dads know this.
[1:09:17] Sometimes our kids will tell things to
[1:09:19] their mother they won't tell to us.
[1:09:24] Why is that? Fear has been removed from
[1:09:27] the equation.
[1:09:29] Mama's less likely to give up on me.
[1:09:34] Come on, church. Not saying it would
[1:09:36] never happen, but mama's less likely.
[1:09:42] Oh, church. I've never been scared of my
[1:09:47] mother. Now, my mother spanked me many
[1:09:49] times. Probably more than my dad did.
[1:09:51] Yes. But it didn't really hurt.
[1:09:55] But but I've never been scared of my
[1:09:58] mother. Didn't have a fear of my mother.
[1:10:01] My dad scared me. Right. And and we need
[1:10:04] like we need dads. Yeah, dads are
[1:10:07] essential in the home. Because sometimes
[1:10:09] moms will just go along, you know, and
[1:10:11] dad has to put a stop to things
[1:10:13] sometimes, right?
[1:10:16] But we need to be careful and understand
[1:10:17] that a mother is the way she is because
[1:10:19] something God put in her. That's right.
[1:10:21] Right. But I was never scared of my
[1:10:24] mother. Listen to me, church. You don't
[1:10:26] have to be afraid of God.
[1:10:28] Amen.
[1:10:30] Brother Brandon said he was before he
[1:10:32] got the Holy Ghost, he thought that he
[1:10:34] said he thought that the father hated
[1:10:36] him and Jesus loved him. He said, "But
[1:10:39] then I found out they were the same
[1:10:41] person." He said, "And Jesus is the very
[1:10:44] heart of God called love." That great
[1:10:47] attribute of God called love. That's
[1:10:50] what Jesus is.
[1:10:53] So much more than a mother's love. He
[1:10:55] said that if a mother's love would do
[1:10:56] that, what will the love of God do?
[1:10:59] Because it removes fear from the
[1:11:00] equation. Look at 1 John 4:18. There is
[1:11:02] no fear in love. But perfect love
[1:11:05] casteth out fear because fear hath
[1:11:07] torment. He that fearth is not made
[1:11:10] perfect right in love. Perfect love cast
[1:11:14] out fear. Brother said that's the reason
[1:11:16] people won't take God at his word for
[1:11:18] healing. He said they don't love him
[1:11:20] well enough. Oh my. You say, "Well, I
[1:11:21] love God." But but perfect love, when
[1:11:23] you have perfect love, it brings a
[1:11:25] perfect confidence. And if God ever told
[1:11:27] you in his word that he healed you, you
[1:11:28] just take that and say, "I believe he'll
[1:11:30] do it because mama don't lie to me."
[1:11:32] Come on, church. My my my God don't lie
[1:11:34] to me. Right? There's no fear in that.
[1:11:37] I'm not afraid. We say, "Well, I've done
[1:11:39] this. I'm afraid it won't be enough."
[1:11:40] And that's what gets in our way so many
[1:11:42] times. People could be healed. Many
[1:11:43] times people, that's why sinners many
[1:11:45] times are healed before Christian people
[1:11:47] because condemnation comes on Christian
[1:11:49] people and they say, "Well, God is going
[1:11:51] to hold my healing from me because of
[1:11:53] something I did 15 years ago." Listen,
[1:11:55] if you've repented, he don't even
[1:11:57] remember it.
[1:11:59] How could he withhold your healing when
[1:12:00] he don't remember it in the first place?
[1:12:02] You say, "Well, brother Ben, what do I
[1:12:03] need to do? Do I need to jump through
[1:12:05] cartwheels? We're done." No. He said,
[1:12:06] "If you believe," he said, "you have
[1:12:08] faith and you repent of your sins in the
[1:12:10] name of Jesus Christ, go and get
[1:12:12] baptized. if you've never been baptized
[1:12:14] and receive the baptism of the Holy
[1:12:15] Ghost and you can be changed instantly.
[1:12:19] It takes that long. Yes, that's right.
[1:12:21] To make things right with God. Yes. You
[1:12:24] don't have to have a long explanation,
[1:12:26] right? All you have to do is repent.
[1:12:28] Yes. Yes. That's true.
[1:12:33] He said if you don't love him well
[1:12:35] enough because you're scared he won't
[1:12:36] keep his word. But perfect love cast out
[1:12:38] fear which brings perfect faith and
[1:12:40] confidence. Brother Brandham even made
[1:12:41] the statement that if you had a grease
[1:12:43] burn, he said, "You weren't afraid of
[1:12:46] it. It wouldn't burn you." That's it's
[1:12:48] interesting, isn't it? But he typed that
[1:12:50] to a spiritual type. He said, "You get
[1:12:51] you got the Holy Ghost. It's operating
[1:12:53] in your body." He said, "Well," he said,
[1:12:56] "When that old snake grabbed a hold of
[1:12:57] Paul's hand," he said, there was not a
[1:12:59] bit of
[1:13:02] scare. Paul wasn't me.
[1:13:06] We had a copperhead in our yard the
[1:13:08] other day, and I
[1:13:11] I'm scared to death of snakes. I
[1:13:12] remember one time Joanna Ivy was had
[1:13:14] come home and and brother Sister Ivy
[1:13:16] were gone and Joanna called her. She
[1:13:18] said, "There's a snake on on the door
[1:13:21] and I expected to be in front of the
[1:13:22] door." I get over there and cuz I'm
[1:13:24] going to be the big big bad snake killer
[1:13:26] cuz none of the deacons were available.
[1:13:27] And I get over there and and the snake
[1:13:31] is curled up around that wreath on the
[1:13:32] front door. Big old black snake.
[1:13:34] Probably was harmless. But that thing
[1:13:36] scared me to death. I couldn't figure
[1:13:37] out how to get it out of there. Finally,
[1:13:38] I got I got a hose and I sprayed that
[1:13:42] thing off the door, you know, and and
[1:13:45] it's great big old black
[1:13:49] snake was on the door. So, I sprayed
[1:13:52] that thing, it got off and I took a hoe.
[1:13:53] I found a hoe in the yard and I took
[1:13:55] that thing and I hammered that deck, not
[1:13:57] realizing I actually broke their
[1:14:00] deck cuz I was so scared of that big
[1:14:02] black snake.
[1:14:07] I had a copperhead in the yard the other
[1:14:08] day and because evidently that's
[1:14:10] something we just do around here is
[1:14:11] copperheads in our yards. I didn't know
[1:14:13] that when I moved back here. I didn't
[1:14:15] remember that. And so I I there's a
[1:14:17] copperhead in the yard and I got a hold
[1:14:19] of that with with two shovels, you know,
[1:14:21] and took after it till the head was cut
[1:14:22] off. I took the head and cut it off.
[1:14:24] Then I mashed the head and then I threw
[1:14:26] the head
[1:14:29] away. I don't want nothing to do with
[1:14:31] that copper head.
[1:14:34] But Paul takes an old snake, a mamba, a
[1:14:37] horrible snake. He takes that snake that
[1:14:40] was instant death and it jumps, it comes
[1:14:42] out of the fire and bites him on the
[1:14:43] hand, just shakes it off and goes on
[1:14:46] gathering wood. And they said, "You're a
[1:14:48] god." They didn't know how close they
[1:14:50] were. He wasn't a god, but he had the
[1:14:52] spirit of God in him. So the man said,
[1:14:54] "You got the Holy Ghost operating in
[1:14:56] your body. There's no reason to fear."
[1:14:58] Some people are so afraid of anything. I
[1:15:00] know young people get afraid. They say,
[1:15:01] "Well, I won't be able to make a living.
[1:15:02] I want If God's called you to be a
[1:15:04] husband, he'll put something in you to
[1:15:06] make a living. If God's called you to be
[1:15:08] a wife, he'll put something in you to be
[1:15:10] a wife and a mother. If God's called you
[1:15:12] to do that, he'll give you the ability.
[1:15:13] Don't be afraid. Don't fear. Trust the
[1:15:16] Lord. No fear in love, sir. Yes.
[1:15:21] He said he looked at it, shook it off in
[1:15:22] the fire, and went on. He said it got
[1:15:24] some more sticks. It didn't scare him.
[1:15:25] Oh, Peter was walking on the water. And
[1:15:28] you know, I find it interesting that
[1:15:30] that's not written in the book of Mark.
[1:15:31] The book of Mark is basically Peter's
[1:15:32] testimony is what scholars tell us.
[1:15:34] That's Peter's testimony that he told
[1:15:36] that to Mark and Mark wrote it down. But
[1:15:39] Matthew tells about it. See, Mark tells
[1:15:42] about Jesus walking on the water, but
[1:15:44] doesn't say nothing about
[1:15:45] Peter. But but Matthew, why? Because
[1:15:48] Peter also sunk.
[1:15:50] If that had been my story, I might have
[1:15:52] left that out, too.
[1:15:55] But we all talk about Peter sinking. But
[1:15:56] he actually walked on water. The only
[1:15:58] man that we know of that's ever done
[1:16:00] that. That's right. Right. And the only
[1:16:02] reason he sank was because the Bible
[1:16:04] says the wind was contrary in the wind.
[1:16:07] He began to notice the wind. And when he
[1:16:09] noticed the wind, he began to be afraid
[1:16:12] because he knew what that kind of wind
[1:16:13] in those kind of ways could do. Oh my.
[1:16:17] He was so over. But why did he walk in
[1:16:19] the first place? He was overwhelmed by
[1:16:21] love. He said, "If you call me, I'll
[1:16:23] come to you." Listen. And the same God
[1:16:26] who called him to come and caused him to
[1:16:28] walk. Listen, you might have fallen away
[1:16:29] from God, but if you ever had an
[1:16:31] experience with God, the same God that
[1:16:33] called you in the first place is the
[1:16:35] same God that can grab you out of the
[1:16:36] water and pick you up from the place
[1:16:38] where you've fallen to. Hallelujah.
[1:16:44] The B said, "Don't have one bit of fear.
[1:16:45] Move forward." God said so. That settles
[1:16:47] it. You can't do that until you have
[1:16:49] love. Perfect love cast out all fe all
[1:16:51] fear. If I want to contribute anything,
[1:16:53] he says to my success in the ministry
[1:16:55] amongst people is this. I'll admit I've
[1:16:57] had to butcher up some meetings because
[1:16:58] I just couldn't set routine like
[1:16:59] ministers do. He said, "Many times I've
[1:17:01] had to promise this and take this back
[1:17:02] and do this and do that because God will
[1:17:04] make me do it." But if there's one
[1:17:06] thing, it's because I've loved people
[1:17:08] and people knows that. Yes. Listen to
[1:17:11] me, church. I've learned this just in
[1:17:13] the few years that we've been here and
[1:17:14] the years that I've spent pastoring and
[1:17:16] and helping in churches. I've learned
[1:17:18] this that that that I'll make mistakes.
[1:17:20] I'm going to make mistakes. If if you're
[1:17:23] waiting for me to make one, you know, I
[1:17:25] know more about my mistakes than you do.
[1:17:26] If you you know, I that's why I don't
[1:17:28] get too afraid and people talk bad about
[1:17:29] me because I I know I'm worse than what
[1:17:32] they say.
[1:17:35] I know what I would be without the grace
[1:17:37] of God on my life. I recognize that. But
[1:17:40] but but I'm going to make mistakes. I'm
[1:17:43] going to do that. But if the people if
[1:17:44] you could ever get people to love you
[1:17:46] and learn that you love them,
[1:17:49] then the mistakes just kind of go away.
[1:17:52] When there's love in a marriage, you
[1:17:53] don't pick at something all the time.
[1:17:54] That's right. I told one couple, I said,
[1:17:57] "The same things you guys are picking at
[1:17:59] constantly is the same things we do to
[1:18:00] each other all the time, and nobody
[1:18:02] notices the dishes get left unwashed."
[1:18:05] Right? By me, not
[1:18:09] her. Huh? Maybe a night when she wants
[1:18:12] me to wash the dishes and I find a
[1:18:14] convenient excuse to do something else.
[1:18:16] I've done that two or three times in my
[1:18:17] life.
[1:18:20] But but you see what I'm saying? Some
[1:18:22] don't get done and oh, your clothes got
[1:18:24] dropped on the floor and and to a couple
[1:18:26] who not in love anymore, that becomes a
[1:18:29] deal breaking thing. But to somebody
[1:18:32] that's in love, it don't even matter.
[1:18:33] They didn't even notice it. That's
[1:18:35] right. Come on, church. Boy, it got
[1:18:37] quiet.
[1:18:39] [Laughter]
[1:18:41] I had one purpose in life this morning,
[1:18:43] and that's not to embarrass my wife. So,
[1:18:45] God bless my wife.
[1:18:49] But you got to love people and they got
[1:18:50] to feel it. He said, "You take a little
[1:18:52] baby 3 months old. He don't know
[1:18:54] nothing. He's got a mind, but it is it
[1:18:56] isn't developed. He don't know who or
[1:18:59] nothing. The doctors say they can see a
[1:19:00] light, might see your hand, but they can
[1:19:02] only follow it. And he'll be just
[1:19:04] kicking his little heels and screaming
[1:19:06] to the top of his voice." Well, here
[1:19:08] comes some kind woman comes along past
[1:19:10] him, says, "Well, well, dear." He just
[1:19:12] kicks right on. He don't know who the
[1:19:15] woman is. He don't know nobody, but let
[1:19:17] that mother walk up. Just put her hands
[1:19:20] on him. That's right. Have you ever seen
[1:19:22] that? He said that settles it. Now, he
[1:19:24] said he don't know his mother, but his
[1:19:26] little spirit knows there's something
[1:19:28] about that spirit there. Hallelujah.
[1:19:32] That nothing else can inject that mother
[1:19:34] love to him. No matter how much the
[1:19:37] other person loves, it ain't the
[1:19:40] mother's love. A grandma's love will
[1:19:41] never be a mother's love only to her
[1:19:43] children. But then a mother has a
[1:19:44] special love to her children. Another
[1:19:46] person's love, a stranger's love will
[1:19:48] never be a mother's love. There's
[1:19:49] something special about a mother and her
[1:19:51] baby. She lays her hands on him, he'll
[1:19:53] dry up. See, he's ready. Because that
[1:19:54] mother, there's a love about her that
[1:19:56] goes to the baby. That the baby's little
[1:19:58] spirit recognizes that that's a love
[1:20:00] that no other love is. He said, "No
[1:20:02] wonder he ordained us to lay hands on
[1:20:04] the sick." I know there's people don't
[1:20:06] believe in that anymore, but he's
[1:20:07] ordained us to do that. Brother
[1:20:09] Brandham, at the end of his ministry, he
[1:20:11] said, "I find myself using discernment
[1:20:12] less and laying hands on the sick more."
[1:20:15] He said, "Because I just put myself up
[1:20:16] in the arms of Jesus and I just love on
[1:20:18] him." He said, "And then I lay hands on
[1:20:20] the sick." And when people believe that,
[1:20:22] right? When people believe that, because
[1:20:24] he never even said we had to pray. He
[1:20:26] said, "But if you lay hands on the sick,
[1:20:27] they shall recover." Are you with me
[1:20:30] now? If we could just believe that,
[1:20:31] things would be different. He said,
[1:20:33] "That's why." He said, "We we lay hands
[1:20:35] on the sick." He said, he said he'd take
[1:20:37] a horse when he's all bothered jumping
[1:20:39] and jerking. He said, "You western
[1:20:41] people ought to know you let the master
[1:20:42] walk in the stall and probably say, "Wo
[1:20:44] boy, lay his hands on him." He'd quieten
[1:20:46] right down, see us love. And when we
[1:20:48] love God with all of our hearts, souls,
[1:20:49] and minds, and we love one another as
[1:20:51] ourselves, our neighbors as ourselves,
[1:20:53] the people can actually feel that. Oh, I
[1:20:56] hope we can feel it for one another this
[1:20:58] morning. I hope we can love each other
[1:20:59] without any barriers, without anything.
[1:21:01] I can honestly say from my heart, I love
[1:21:03] you. And you can honestly say from your
[1:21:05] heart, you love me. I can honestly say,
[1:21:07] I want the best for you. And you can say
[1:21:09] you want the best for me. Then if that
[1:21:11] was the case, what go what limits can we
[1:21:13] place on the what could happen here this
[1:21:15] morning if we could come in one place in
[1:21:17] one accord?
[1:21:19] Amen.
[1:21:21] Hallelujah. He said you can't make
[1:21:23] belief cuz they'll know it. Lincoln said
[1:21:26] you can fool part of the people part of
[1:21:27] the time, not all the people all the
[1:21:29] time. That's right. You got love in your
[1:21:31] heart for the people, they'll know it.
[1:21:33] You might act indifferent or anything
[1:21:34] but still they know it. They can feel
[1:21:36] it. It's another dimension as we call it
[1:21:38] that injects to these people a love that
[1:21:39] they know it. They'll believe it. He
[1:21:41] said and that's when you can help the
[1:21:43] person is when you believe it. Yeah.
[1:21:46] Now, brother Brandon said that the
[1:21:47] people of Phoenix, I don't have time to
[1:21:48] read all this, but he said the people of
[1:21:50] Phoenix have become indifferent towards
[1:21:52] God. And he said this. He said the
[1:21:54] reason we become so indifferent towards
[1:21:56] God is because we're indifferent towards
[1:21:58] one another. Oh, that ought to strike
[1:22:00] our hearts, shouldn't it? Yeah.
[1:22:03] I've told you before, you can't say, "I
[1:22:05] love God and I hate my wife."
[1:22:09] But let me take that a step further. You
[1:22:10] can't say, "I love God and I hate
[1:22:12] anybody."
[1:22:14] Brother Brandon says, "Elect don't
[1:22:15] persecute elect." But we could even take
[1:22:17] that further. Elect don't persecute
[1:22:19] anybody. That's right. Elect don't
[1:22:22] persecute. God, help me to act like the
[1:22:24] elect. Are you with me now? We're still
[1:22:27] We still got a sticky nature. We still
[1:22:28] got our spirit. Sometimes we fail, but
[1:22:30] that's my desire. Lord, help me to act
[1:22:32] like the elect who don't persecute
[1:22:35] anybody. He said the reason we become so
[1:22:37] indifferent towards God is because we're
[1:22:39] indifferent towards one another. When we
[1:22:40] get in one accord, then God comes down.
[1:22:43] If you would get in one accord in your
[1:22:44] home, in one accord in the church, you
[1:22:46] could watch God begin to move. Many
[1:22:49] times when we don't get in one accord,
[1:22:50] it's why things happen the way that they
[1:22:52] do and and why we don't maybe see what
[1:22:54] we should see. Now when we're in Africa
[1:22:57] he said in India or many of the islands
[1:22:58] and so forth you notice he said one
[1:23:00] simple little miracle the people he said
[1:23:01] that well he said this afternoon or any
[1:23:03] other place look that was very wonderful
[1:23:05] we praise the lord for that so in other
[1:23:06] words don't just leave uh the the
[1:23:08] meeting and say well that was a good
[1:23:09] meeting he said but over there he said
[1:23:11] let that happen one time he said we walk
[1:23:13] right home with the same indifference
[1:23:15] let that happen one time among the
[1:23:16] heathen and the whole country will come
[1:23:18] to God every one of them will sweep
[1:23:20] right in the kingdom of God right then
[1:23:21] they believe they're humble we
[1:23:23] experienced that in Egypt when we went
[1:23:24] didn't Then people that come in the
[1:23:25] prayer line, they believed and and their
[1:23:28] belief was so strong. They didn't have
[1:23:29] any prayerline manners. They just they
[1:23:31] jumped over one another, jumped over the
[1:23:34] jumped over the boundaries, pushed
[1:23:35] through one another, pulled people
[1:23:37] aside. What was it? They they believed
[1:23:39] they were going to get healed. And many
[1:23:41] of them were healed because they
[1:23:43] believed it. What would happen if we
[1:23:45] believed it today? He said they
[1:23:47] believed. They're humble. He said, "Now
[1:23:48] that's what we got to do now." He said,
[1:23:50] "Let's just break down all differences
[1:23:51] everywhere." He said, "Now you just
[1:23:53] can't put it on. It's got to come from
[1:23:55] the inside. He said, you remember the
[1:23:56] Holy Spirit knows that whether it's
[1:23:58] coming from the inside. Let's just get
[1:23:59] all the differences away. Walk right out
[1:24:01] and say, "I love the Lord." Can someone
[1:24:03] say that with me this morning? I love
[1:24:05] the Lord and I love even my enemies.
[1:24:09] Oh, a lot less of us said
[1:24:13] that. I love the Lord and I love even my
[1:24:17] enemies. He says, if anyone says
[1:24:19] anything about you, don't let that
[1:24:21] bother you at all. Don't mar that
[1:24:23] wonderful feeling. It feels so good to
[1:24:26] be in the clear. He said, ' Don't do
[1:24:27] anything to mar that wonderful feeling.
[1:24:29] If you got to delete Facebook, delete
[1:24:31] Facebook. I've had to do it before. If
[1:24:33] you got to get if you've got to quit
[1:24:35] talking so much on the phone, quit
[1:24:36] talking so much on the phone. Whatever
[1:24:38] it takes to keep that wonderful feeling.
[1:24:40] Listen to me, church. If you got
[1:24:41] something against me, unless it's
[1:24:42] something I've done that I can correct,
[1:24:44] if it's something I've done, I want to
[1:24:45] know. But if you got something against
[1:24:46] me, you're just mad at me for no reason,
[1:24:48] I'd rather not even know it so I can
[1:24:50] keep on loving you. Because I'll tell
[1:24:52] you what, I believe the love of God can
[1:24:53] make a difference in your life. He said,
[1:24:56] "Go ahead, love them anyhow. What good
[1:24:58] does it go to do anyhow for you to get
[1:25:00] all peeved up about things? Just love
[1:25:01] them anyhow. Love everybody because
[1:25:03] they're the purchase of the blood of
[1:25:04] Jesus Christ, whether they're sinners or
[1:25:07] saints." So, I can love saints like
[1:25:10] that. That's not what he told us to do.
[1:25:12] He said, "Whether they're sinners or
[1:25:14] saints," he said, "and then you'll be
[1:25:16] able to win them to God, cuz they'll
[1:25:18] realize that you really love them." Yes.
[1:25:22] You
[1:25:25] really When I think of that, many of you
[1:25:27] know where I'm going. I think of a
[1:25:30] mother
[1:25:32] deer. One time, Brother Brandon was out
[1:25:34] hunting. He was in uh New Hampshire,
[1:25:37] northern New Hampshire near the Canadian
[1:25:40] border going from going towards Mount
[1:25:43] Washington up out in the wilderness and
[1:25:46] he said he was hunting with Bert Call,
[1:25:48] the man with lizard eyes. You've heard
[1:25:50] the story. He said when he looked at you
[1:25:52] looked like he had lizard
[1:25:54] eyes. So he he was out there hunting
[1:25:57] with him and he said Bert would kill
[1:25:59] fawns just to make Brother Brandham
[1:26:01] squirm. Just kill him. Brother Bram said
[1:26:03] there was nothing wrong with killing a
[1:26:04] fawn if the law would allow that. He
[1:26:06] said but he said he just did it for
[1:26:08] meanness
[1:26:10] and God's people aren't mean. Right.
[1:26:13] Right. But this man was he was a sinner
[1:26:16] and brother Brandon went with him and
[1:26:18] hunted with him and and he was out
[1:26:19] there. He was a good hunter and he was
[1:26:20] out there in the wilderness and and he
[1:26:23] said they hadn't found even a track all
[1:26:25] day out in the snow. Said it was about
[1:26:27] 11:00 in the morning. The deer bed down
[1:26:29] during the day. He said it was about
[1:26:31] 11:00 in the morning and late in the
[1:26:33] season all the deer were scared. He said
[1:26:36] that all of a sudden all of a sudden he
[1:26:39] said Bert pulled out this little whistle
[1:26:41] like a little call and he he made a
[1:26:44] little sound like a like a fawn. And
[1:26:47] when he did he said about 30 yards from
[1:26:50] me a mother deer just stood
[1:26:52] up. Just stood up. A dough just stood up
[1:26:56] right in the middle of that opening that
[1:26:58] they were in. and she's looking for that
[1:27:01] baby sir. And he said he made the noise
[1:27:03] again and and she began to walk towards
[1:27:06] him. He said and when Bert raised the
[1:27:08] rifle to shoot the deer saw
[1:27:11] it but she didn't
[1:27:14] run. Said because he said Bert slipped a
[1:27:17] shell in his rifle, raised it up and put
[1:27:19] the crosshairs across her heart. And as
[1:27:20] he was making a noise, the dough looked
[1:27:22] and she saw him. She looked right in the
[1:27:24] barrel of that
[1:27:25] rifle. But what was it? The baby was in
[1:27:29] trouble.
[1:27:31] She didn't care if it was life or what
[1:27:33] it taken. That baby was in trouble. And
[1:27:35] that mother's love was so great. No
[1:27:37] matter what the rifle looked like or
[1:27:38] what, whether death was right in the
[1:27:40] road, that bullet fixing to clean right
[1:27:42] through her heart, she was looking for
[1:27:43] that baby. There was a cry. There was a
[1:27:46] need. And she was a mother. She was
[1:27:49] looking for that baby. Oh my. Brother
[1:27:52] Brandon said he closed his turned his
[1:27:54] head. He covered his eyes. He he
[1:27:55] couldn't even watch it. He said, "But he
[1:27:57] noticed the silence." And he looked
[1:28:00] around. That gun's going like
[1:28:02] this. He said, "Burke dropped to the
[1:28:04] ground. He grabbed his pent leg. He
[1:28:06] said, "Leave me to that Jesus you've
[1:28:07] been telling me about." Glory. He said
[1:28:10] he saw something real. It wasn't to put
[1:28:12] on. She was willing to die.
[1:28:15] Oh, church.
[1:28:19] Oh, that the world would see that in us
[1:28:21] today. Oh, that our families would see
[1:28:23] that in us. Oh, that as fathers that our
[1:28:26] children would see that, as mothers that
[1:28:27] our children would see that
[1:28:30] she was a real mother. What was it when
[1:28:33] he seen that display of real mother's
[1:28:34] love, heroism, looking death right in
[1:28:37] the face without one stare? It captured
[1:28:40] that cruel heart of his. He said,
[1:28:43] 'Brother, if you could only find out
[1:28:45] what the love of God is. A mother may
[1:28:49] forget her suckling babe, but
[1:28:53] never never will I forget
[1:28:57] you. Good.
[1:29:01] Now, I want you to think about this
[1:29:02] because sometimes we look at that verse
[1:29:03] and say, "Well, he won't forget us. He's
[1:29:05] just not really with me.
[1:29:08] He doesn't forget me, but he doesn't
[1:29:11] really care about me. But what does he
[1:29:13] say as a mother, right? A mother may
[1:29:16] forget. So, he's likening himself to the
[1:29:19] love of a mother. A mother doesn't just
[1:29:21] not forget her
[1:29:23] baby. Oh my. She cares for her baby.
[1:29:27] Yeah. She's as close as she can be all
[1:29:30] the time. A real mother. Oh, I hope
[1:29:33] you're hearing me this morning. And he's
[1:29:35] just as close to you. You may not be
[1:29:37] able to feel him. You may have done some
[1:29:39] things that were wrong. And you know
[1:29:41] that you say, "Well, I can't I don't
[1:29:42] feel his presence anymore, but he's just
[1:29:44] as close to you as he ever was." He's
[1:29:46] waiting, brother, to the gable end of
[1:29:48] your soul, waiting on you to repent,
[1:29:50] waiting on you to come. Not just
[1:29:52] waiting, but calling, wooing, speaking,
[1:29:55] yes. Moving in your life, pulling you.
[1:29:59] True. It's a
[1:30:00] love like a mother would express to her
[1:30:03] baby. Yes. A longing in the heart of God
[1:30:07] says, "I want to be with my children."
[1:30:09] You realize how much he wants to meet
[1:30:11] with us? I know many times it's easy for
[1:30:12] us to say, "Well, it's just church." But
[1:30:15] do you know how much the Jehovah, you
[1:30:17] know, how much the spirit of God values
[1:30:20] the time that we have together?
[1:30:24] He gets to come down. You can imagine
[1:30:25] what it was like when he come down in
[1:30:27] the cool of the evening and talked with
[1:30:29] Adam and Eve. And he can do that in our
[1:30:31] homes. I know. But many times we set
[1:30:32] aside this time and he loves that so
[1:30:35] much. He values that so much. He wants
[1:30:37] to spend time. It'd be like if you set a
[1:30:39] time with your mother to have dinner
[1:30:42] with her and you didn't show up. That's
[1:30:44] right.
[1:30:46] What would happen? You You'd feel so bad
[1:30:48] because you'd think, "Well, well, I know
[1:30:51] mama really wanted me to be there."
[1:30:53] Church, could we recognize today he
[1:30:55] really wants you to be here?
[1:30:58] It's not just me that wants you to be
[1:30:59] here. It's not just the deacons that
[1:31:00] want you to be here. He really wants
[1:31:02] you. Yeah. To be here. He wants
[1:31:06] fellowship with you. A mother may forget
[1:31:08] her suckling bay, but never will I
[1:31:10] forget you. Your names are engraved upon
[1:31:11] the palms of my hand. He said Christ is
[1:31:13] looking for men and women tonight who
[1:31:15] will stand out with the love of God
[1:31:17] regardless. The world's looking tonight
[1:31:19] for someone. Oh, let's be that someone
[1:31:21] today. Can you be that someone? How many
[1:31:23] want to be that someone today? The
[1:31:25] world's looking for someone to display
[1:31:27] the real genuine faith of God. No matter
[1:31:29] what people say, what circumstances in,
[1:31:31] how I feel, what it looks like, how I
[1:31:33] heard the call of God, he's my father
[1:31:35] and I stand to accept his word. Was that
[1:31:39] something real? Mother's love showing us
[1:31:42] God's
[1:31:44] love. A mother will spend her last
[1:31:46] moments of life, and we're not going to
[1:31:48] have a second service, so just give me
[1:31:50] five more minutes this
[1:31:52] morning. A mother will spend her last
[1:31:55] moments of life fighting for her babies.
[1:32:01] Brother Brandham talked about a
[1:32:03] possum that had the nature of a mother
[1:32:06] and that possum was dying. He said in
[1:32:10] the last 30 minutes of her life, what
[1:32:13] could have been? He said
[1:32:17] she what was she doing? She was trying
[1:32:19] to get to her babies.
[1:32:23] last 30 minutes of her life, she was
[1:32:25] trying to make sure her babies were
[1:32:28] okay. I think that I
[1:32:30] know we live in a world it's it's tough
[1:32:34] because I I know I realize that some of
[1:32:35] you can't be at home with your children
[1:32:38] and I recognize that and I know you want
[1:32:40] to be. I know we got real mothers here
[1:32:41] in the church and some of our mothers
[1:32:44] have to work. We know that that's not
[1:32:45] God's original plan. It's not his way.
[1:32:48] But in the world that we live in,
[1:32:49] sometimes you got to help out. That's
[1:32:51] right. We realize that, right? But what
[1:32:53] happens is you want to do it. And the
[1:32:56] reason you're doing what you're doing is
[1:32:58] because you want the best for your
[1:32:59] children. Amen. Are you with me now?
[1:33:01] It's still a mother's love. They want
[1:33:03] the best. Don't let Satan come in and
[1:33:05] give you a mind battle about that. You
[1:33:06] you you want the best for your children.
[1:33:09] And that's a mother's love in you. It's
[1:33:10] God's love. God put that in you. But a
[1:33:14] mother possum in her last moments of
[1:33:17] life, she was willing to give all that
[1:33:19] she had Yeah. to come to the door of a
[1:33:22] prophet and leave her babies in a place
[1:33:26] where they could be cared for. Oh God,
[1:33:28] brother Brandham told us that God's love
[1:33:30] is so much greater than
[1:33:32] that. Jesus fought for us on Calvary.
[1:33:35] Like like that mother fought for her
[1:33:37] babies. Jesus fought for us. He died for
[1:33:40] us. He took his last breath for us
[1:33:42] before we ever even had the capacity to
[1:33:45] love him. Listen, we need to get this
[1:33:47] idea out of our head. Well, I love God
[1:33:49] when God loves me. God has already loved
[1:33:51] you. Yeah.
[1:33:54] Well, I love my children when they love
[1:33:55] me. Listen, they're your children. Yeah.
[1:33:58] You love them anyway. I love my parents
[1:34:01] when they show love to me. They're your
[1:34:02] parents. You ought to love them anyway.
[1:34:05] Are you with me now? And we ought to
[1:34:07] show that to one another. But how much
[1:34:09] more did he show us? With his last dying
[1:34:11] breath, he cried out, "Father, forgive
[1:34:13] them. They don't know what they're
[1:34:15] doing." What kind of a love is that,
[1:34:16] church? Why do we love him? Can you
[1:34:19] explain the love that you have in your
[1:34:20] heart for him? Can you explain why you
[1:34:22] go to the house of God? Why you want to
[1:34:24] dress right and act right and live
[1:34:25] right? Why do you do what you do? It's
[1:34:27] not because somebody stands up here and
[1:34:29] tells you what to do. It's because you
[1:34:30] love God. You love his word. Because you
[1:34:32] love him. Why do you love him? First
[1:34:35] John 4:19 tells us we love him. Because
[1:34:38] someone say because because he first
[1:34:41] loved us. We couldn't give him anything
[1:34:44] in return. But he said, "Nothing in my
[1:34:46] hands I bring. Simply to thy cross I
[1:34:49] cling." Psalms 116:12 says, "What shall
[1:34:52] I render unto the Lord for all his
[1:34:54] benefits towards me? I will take the cup
[1:34:59] of salvation.
[1:35:02] That's good. How could I
[1:35:06] pay my Lord back for his great love?"
[1:35:11] H how can I do that? He don't want to
[1:35:14] punish you. He don't want you to be feel
[1:35:17] miserable all the time. That's not what
[1:35:19] he's looking for.
[1:35:21] Oh,
[1:35:22] church. He He don't will call us to him
[1:35:25] so we can be miserable. But what does he
[1:35:27] do? He says, "If you want to love me
[1:35:30] back, take the cup." Yeah. Take what I
[1:35:34] died for and drink it. I will take the
[1:35:38] cup of salvation and call upon the name
[1:35:41] of the Lord. I can't save myself, but I
[1:35:44] can take the cup. Yeah. I can say, Lord,
[1:35:47] I believe. Help thou my unbelief. Yes.
[1:35:52] What can we do? What can we return? He
[1:35:54] said, I'll take the cup and I'll call on
[1:35:56] the name of the Lord. Yeah. I will pay
[1:35:59] my vows unto the Lord. Now, I like that.
[1:36:03] Now, in the presence of all his people,
[1:36:06] I'm not afraid to worship. Not afraid to
[1:36:08] lift my hands. Not because I it's some
[1:36:10] kind of a worked up emotion, but because
[1:36:12] there's something in my heart that loves
[1:36:14] him.
[1:36:16] Listen, church, I've tried being some
[1:36:17] other way. I can't be any other way. If
[1:36:19] I'm going to serve God, I got to serve
[1:36:21] him with all my heart. Let me love him
[1:36:23] with all my heart. I'll pay my vows now.
[1:36:26] I know what he did for me. Yes. in the
[1:36:28] presence of all his people. All I can do
[1:36:31] is drink from the cup of salvation and
[1:36:34] worship.
[1:36:35] Are you with me now? For when we were
[1:36:38] yet without strength in due time, Christ
[1:36:39] died for the ungodly. For scarcely for a
[1:36:42] righteous man will one die. Yet per
[1:36:44] adventure for a good man some would dare
[1:36:46] to die. But God commendeth his love
[1:36:48] toward us in that while we were yet
[1:36:50] sinners, Christ died for us. He didn't
[1:36:53] die for us when we were saints. He died
[1:36:54] for us when we were sinners. much more
[1:36:57] than being now justified by his blood.
[1:36:59] We shall be saved from wrath through
[1:37:01] him. For if when we were enemies, we
[1:37:03] were reconciled to God by the death of
[1:37:05] his son. Much more being reconciled, we
[1:37:07] shall be saved by his life. Not only so,
[1:37:10] but we also joy in God through our Lord
[1:37:12] Jesus Christ by whom we have now
[1:37:14] received the atonement. Listen, when you
[1:37:16] read those words and it really becomes a
[1:37:18] reality to you and the spirit of God
[1:37:21] speaks to your heart about it, no wonder
[1:37:22] the multitude in heaven cried out,
[1:37:24] "Worthy is the lamb." I wonder if we
[1:37:26] could do that this morning. I wonder if
[1:37:28] we could cry out to him, "Lord, you are
[1:37:30] worthy. You are worthy. You took the
[1:37:33] book. You took you you you suffered the
[1:37:35] cross. You opened the seals. Worthy is
[1:37:38] the lamb who loved us when we were
[1:37:40] unlovable."
[1:37:42] Hallelujah. You see, a mother's love is
[1:37:44] just a portion of God's love. Brother
[1:37:46] said, way up beyond her, above a
[1:37:47] million, 100 million miles, there's a
[1:37:49] space that big. And I don't know how
[1:37:51] wide he spread his arms, but maybe like
[1:37:53] this. He said that is perfect agapo
[1:37:56] love. He said every time you make a step
[1:37:58] this way it narrows an inch. He said you
[1:38:01] know how little it would be by the time
[1:38:02] it got to the earth. It's a shadow of
[1:38:05] the shadow of the shadows. That's what
[1:38:08] you have. That's what I have. A shadow
[1:38:11] of shadows of agile love. He said even
[1:38:14] when we have the love of God in our
[1:38:16] hearts it's it's a shadow of the shadows
[1:38:18] of what he is. Yeah. That's why when he
[1:38:21] went beyond the curtain of time, he said
[1:38:22] there was nothing but love there and
[1:38:24] nothing but perfect love can enter
[1:38:26] there. His love was so great. He showed
[1:38:30] himself to Abram and and when he showed
[1:38:33] himself to Abram, I love this. He told
[1:38:36] Abram, he said, "Walk before me and be
[1:38:37] perfect." In in Genesis 17:1, but before
[1:38:40] he asked him to walk a perfect walk, he
[1:38:42] revealed himself to him in a name. Yeah.
[1:38:45] He said, "I am the Almighty God." And
[1:38:48] that
[1:38:49] means it's it's it's the almighty God is
[1:38:51] El Shadai. It's the breasted
[1:38:54] one. Brother Brandham says he told him,
[1:38:56] "Abraham, you're old. Your strength is
[1:38:58] gone. Your arms are withered up. Your
[1:39:00] manhood's gone, but I am your mother."
[1:39:05] Think about that for a moment. He said,
[1:39:06] "I that that expression of love that's
[1:39:08] expressed in a mother, that's just a
[1:39:10] shadow."
[1:39:12] Abraham, think about it. You got to walk
[1:39:14] a perfect walk, but you can't do it on
[1:39:17] your own. You need to come up in the
[1:39:19] arms of your mother. He said, "You're 90
[1:39:22] 99 years old, but you're still a baby.
[1:39:25] You're still just a baby." He said, "I
[1:39:27] want to reveal to you my name." He
[1:39:28] revealed to him that he was he was his
[1:39:31] mother. He said, "Just take a hold of my
[1:39:32] promise and be satisfied while you're
[1:39:34] waiting. There's nothing that'll satisfy
[1:39:36] a baby like the mother." What did he do?
[1:39:38] He revealed himself as a mother to to
[1:39:40] Abraham. And so Abraham could walk
[1:39:42] perfectly because he revealed himself in
[1:39:44] that way and he rested in that
[1:39:46] revelation. We can rest in that re
[1:39:48] revelation today. We can rest in that
[1:39:50] love. Yes. As the musicians
[1:39:57] come talked about uh being in
[1:40:00] India and I'm hoping to be able to go to
[1:40:02] India later in the year. Y'all pray with
[1:40:04] me. I don't know Nepal there's war and
[1:40:07] stuff going on there right now and so I
[1:40:09] don't want to I don't want to go if
[1:40:11] that's going on and yet I felt a pull to
[1:40:13] do that and if you'all pray with me but
[1:40:17] brother Brandon talked about being an
[1:40:18] Indian crowds of people that were there
[1:40:21] he talked about the different kind of
[1:40:22] sicknesses as they would pass by and
[1:40:23] he'd pray for them he said a leper
[1:40:26] passed
[1:40:27] by had no
[1:40:29] arm and now a leper especially in
[1:40:33] countries where they don't know how
[1:40:34] leprosy works works. Exactly. And
[1:40:35] there's a lot of fear about it. In fact,
[1:40:38] in the scripture, when a leper would
[1:40:39] walk towards them, they'd cry out,
[1:40:42] "Unclean, unclean." And people would
[1:40:45] make sure they didn't even get within 50
[1:40:46] ft of them cuz they didn't want to get
[1:40:49] sick or didn't want to be around them.
[1:40:54] And brother Brandham talked about this
[1:40:55] leper and he said he come up and he said
[1:40:58] when he did he said I took him up in my
[1:41:02] arms and I be to love
[1:41:06] him and he said he just wept when he
[1:41:08] seen that somebody cared for him as a
[1:41:13] leper on the streets of India he
[1:41:14] probably hadn't felt a
[1:41:18] hug we don't realize what we take for
[1:41:20] granted church maybe he hadn't felt a
[1:41:23] hug for for many many
[1:41:30] years. Don't let your kids be like that.
[1:41:33] Love on your kids.
[1:41:35] [Music]
[1:41:38] Let your wife know you love her. Let
[1:41:39] your husband know you love
[1:41:41] him. Say, "Well, they're not perfect.
[1:41:44] Neither were you."
[1:41:45] [Music]
[1:41:48] God took that he allowed that leper to
[1:41:50] come by and brother Brown just grabbed
[1:41:52] him in his arm
[1:41:57] said oh my and when he grabbed him and
[1:42:00] and held him he said he seen that
[1:42:02] somebody cared for him and brother Ben
[1:42:05] tells her this he said the world's dying
[1:42:06] for love
[1:42:08] brothers he said now you take your
[1:42:10] brother in your
[1:42:12] arms see if it don't make things a
[1:42:14] little
[1:42:16] different. I found it's hard to demonize
[1:42:19] people when you're around them. That's
[1:42:21] why so many times a a spirit of
[1:42:24] separation will come among people and
[1:42:27] they'll separate and then criticize. But
[1:42:29] it's hard to demonize people you're
[1:42:31] around because you realize they're human
[1:42:32] like you're human. That's right. That's
[1:42:34] why we're meant to be together, huh? To
[1:42:37] worship
[1:42:38] together cuz we are human.
[1:42:42] But brother Brandon says if you take
[1:42:43] your brother in your arms, see if it
[1:42:44] don't make things a little different.
[1:42:46] See that divine love that we see
[1:42:47] expressed in a mother and yet that
[1:42:49] divine love can be expressed in each and
[1:42:51] every one of us. That same love that
[1:42:54] worked on a leper will work on your
[1:42:56] brother that you think is
[1:43:00] wrong. The one that you think, well, I
[1:43:03] ought to shove him
[1:43:05] away cuz the leprosy will get on me.
[1:43:09] said, "Take him and pull him up close to
[1:43:13] you." Well, you do after you spank your
[1:43:15] kids. I know you do it by instinct. Many
[1:43:17] of you, you spank your little children
[1:43:18] and then you grab them and hug
[1:43:20] them. Don't you know that God wants to
[1:43:23] do that to us, too? He loves you so
[1:43:26] much. But I don't want to just
[1:43:29] experience God's love. I want to be that
[1:43:32] love.
[1:43:34] Huh?
[1:43:38] Brother Ben, you preach about this a
[1:43:39] lot. It's because I need
[1:43:42] it. And I see that we need it. And I
[1:43:44] wonder I wonder sometimes if this isn't
[1:43:46] the last step that has to be taken
[1:43:50] before we can go home. Is that we learn
[1:43:53] to be mature enough to love one another
[1:43:56] because our bodies aren't going to be
[1:43:57] changed until it's time for the change.
[1:44:00] We're still going to have these sticky
[1:44:01] natures. But if we can learn to get past
[1:44:04] that and love one another, Yes.
[1:44:06] Maybe we begin to see the great
[1:44:08] commission begin to come into operation
[1:44:10] among us. I don't just want to
[1:44:13] experience God's love. I want to be that
[1:44:16] love. Oh, that I could show that kind of
[1:44:19] love to a lost and dying world. Would
[1:44:21] you bow your heads with me this
[1:44:23] morning? Maybe you're here this morning
[1:44:26] with no one looking
[1:44:27] around, every head bowed and every eye
[1:44:30] closed.
[1:44:32] You say, "Brother Ben, I've never really
[1:44:34] experienced that love of God like I
[1:44:37] should." Would you raise your hand? I
[1:44:40] see that hand. That
[1:44:42] hand. That hand. God bless the hands
[1:44:46] that little both hands
[1:44:48] up. Never really experienced that like I
[1:44:50] should.
[1:44:51] I He'll put his arms around you this
[1:44:56] morning. He'll do
[1:44:58] that. It's right where you're sitting.
[1:45:00] just just know the love of God is
[1:45:02] reaching out to
[1:45:04] you. Let's pray. Heavenly
[1:45:07] Father, Lord Jesus, I I feel Lord that
[1:45:11] these people that have raised their
[1:45:12] hand, I know some of them are young and
[1:45:14] some of them are
[1:45:16] older, Lord, but they feel like, well, I
[1:45:19] maybe I've not loved like I should or
[1:45:22] maybe they've just never ever
[1:45:23] experienced your love. They've just
[1:45:25] never really been born again. And I pray
[1:45:28] God that today would be the day Lord. We
[1:45:31] know it's not some great show, but if
[1:45:34] just your love could come down in their
[1:45:37] hearts, Lord, and make it real to them.
[1:45:40] May they see real love. Oh
[1:45:42] God, Lord, help those, Lord, those
[1:45:45] there's some of us, Lord, that maybe
[1:45:46] need to be in an altar this morning
[1:45:48] because we we get so hard,
[1:45:51] critical, Lord, because we see things
[1:45:54] that are happening. Lord, help us.
[1:45:57] Help us to take our arms and grab a hold
[1:45:59] of the leper and grab him and pull him
[1:46:02] in. Pray you grab that, Lord. Help me,
[1:46:04] oh
[1:46:05] God. Oh God, I pray that you'd move. May
[1:46:09] divine love be poured out in every
[1:46:11] heart, Lord, as we see the love of a
[1:46:13] mother. We're so thankful for our
[1:46:14] mothers, Lord, and how that expresses
[1:46:16] the love of God to us. I pray, God, that
[1:46:20] you would we would know your love like
[1:46:22] never before. that you would just wrap
[1:46:24] your arms around these, Lord, that have
[1:46:26] raised their hands. May they know you.
[1:46:28] May they experience you this morning
[1:46:30] like never before. May they believe your
[1:46:33] word and go home knowing that a change
[1:46:35] has taken place in their life.
[1:46:38] Lord, if
[1:46:41] there's Lord, a Christian here has
[1:46:43] become a
[1:46:44] hard soften our hearts.
[1:46:47] Lord, we don't want to be like that. We
[1:46:50] want to be right.
[1:46:53] or maybe a mother or a father that maybe
[1:46:55] just hasn't expressed the kind of love
[1:46:57] that you want them to express. Lord, if
[1:46:59] it's me, if it's my brother, my sister,
[1:47:01] whoever it is, Lord, I pray that you'd
[1:47:02] help us today. Soften us up. Make us to
[1:47:06] express the love of God to a lost and
[1:47:09] dying world. We pray in Jesus
[1:47:13] name.
[1:47:15] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. If you need
[1:47:17] prayer, the altar's open. You just come
[1:47:19] and pray if you want to. I know it's
[1:47:21] Mother's Day, but I feel his presence
[1:47:23] here. And we've got all day. If you want
[1:47:25] to pray,
[1:47:27] I we won't hold you. If you want to
[1:47:30] come, come. God bless you this morning.
[1:47:36] Oh, could we raise our hands and sing it
[1:47:38] to you?
[1:47:39] Oh, it shall
[1:47:46] forever more.

[1:48:14] great love of God this morning?

[1:48:19] own way this morning, we'll just take a
[1:48:20] moment. Lord, I love you. I'll pay my
[1:48:23] vows in the midst of the congregation.
[1:48:25] Lord, I I couldn't save myself, but you

[1:48:33] lowest hell for me. Oh, it goes beyond.
