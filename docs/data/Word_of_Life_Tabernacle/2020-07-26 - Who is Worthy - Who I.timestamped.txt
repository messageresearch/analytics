[48:04] and i'm sure it'll be a blessing to you
[48:07] he was working in the area and able to
[48:08] come
[48:09] so i'm glad he's able to do that
[48:11] revelation chapter 5 and verse 3 and no
[48:13] man in heaven
[48:15] nor in earth neither under the earth was
[48:17] able to open the book
[48:19] neither to look thereon and i went much
[48:23] because no man was found worthy to open
[48:25] and to read the book
[48:27] neither to look there on i want you to
[48:29] take special notice of that this morning
[48:31] no man was worthy to open but no man was
[48:34] worthy to look at it
[48:35] but was open and one of the elders saith
[48:38] unto me we've not
[48:39] behold the lion of the tribe of judah
[48:42] the root of david
[48:43] have prevailed to open the book amen
[48:46] aren't you glad that he did
[48:48] you have prevailed or in other words he
[48:50] has overcome to open the book
[48:52] and to loose the seven seals
[48:56] thereof i pray the lord had his blessing
[48:58] to the word you may be seated
[49:02] see my sister becky back there good to
[49:04] see you this morning in laney
[49:06] to have you with us this morning good to
[49:09] have all of you with us this morning
[49:12] i want to speak to you this morning on
[49:14] the subject of who is worthy
[49:17] and maybe take it a little bit
[49:18] differently than what we would normally
[49:20] think about it
[49:22] we know that no one but our lord was
[49:24] worthy to open the book
[49:27] we know the lamb was the only one
[49:30] because they looked all
[49:31] through heaven they looked on the earth
[49:33] they looked back through time
[49:35] and no one was worthy and so he had to
[49:38] there had to come the lamb
[49:40] it was god wrapped in flesh that come
[49:42] down
[49:43] and then he died as the son of god for
[49:45] our sins
[49:46] and and we and he was resurrected on the
[49:49] third day and he overcame he prevailed
[49:51] to open the book
[49:53] and so in his prevailing he loosed the
[49:57] seven seals of the book
[50:00] but how do we find a people
[50:03] that are worthy to look at what was
[50:05] opened
[50:07] that are worthy to see what it was and
[50:09] and so the book had something in it and
[50:12] brother branham calls it a book of
[50:13] redemption he calls it a title deed he
[50:15] calls it a book of names
[50:17] and in the breach brother brown says now
[50:19] the book he said remember is seal
[50:21] he said here is one here it is this seal
[50:24] then another one is wrapped a seal
[50:26] another one was wrapped to seal he said
[50:27] it's a book of redemption
[50:29] and the whole thing together makes the
[50:30] book and it's sealed with seven seals
[50:33] and again he says he saw one sitting
[50:35] upon the throne with this book in his
[50:37] hand in his right hand
[50:39] think of it now and then in this book
[50:40] was a title deed and we talked about
[50:42] that how it was the
[50:43] guarantee the abstract title deed to the
[50:45] earth
[50:47] so he said it's a title deed to
[50:48] redemption
[50:50] so it was sealed with seven seals and
[50:53] he says the lamb is the only mediator do
[50:56] we still believe that today
[50:57] the lamb is the only mediator amen
[51:00] see he was the one that came forth and
[51:02] what did he do now he's been back here
[51:04] interceding until his blood
[51:06] has atoned for every person
[51:09] and and which people are that he said
[51:11] and the lamb now
[51:13] knows what's written in the book
[51:17] so he does not take the book brother joe
[51:19] to find out what's written in the book
[51:22] he doesn't take the book take the book
[51:24] so that he'll know the mystery of the
[51:25] book
[51:26] brother branham tells us he doesn't open
[51:27] it for himself
[51:29] but he opens it for us
[51:32] right he takes the book because
[51:36] he's been back here in her seating and
[51:37] he knows what's written in the book he
[51:38] doesn't take it because he doesn't know
[51:41] but he takes it because he does know
[51:44] and he's going to do something so
[51:46] brother brown said so he knowed from the
[51:48] foundation of the world
[51:50] he said their names were in there
[51:53] their names were in there who are their
[51:55] names those were the
[51:56] those who would be redeemable those who
[51:59] would be redeemed that's the book of
[52:00] redemption
[52:02] and so the ones who were redeemable
[52:03] their names were there
[52:05] and so he says that he knew that from
[52:08] the foundation of the world so he stood
[52:10] back there and done mediator work like
[52:12] this
[52:12] he said until immediate mediatorial work
[52:15] till everyone
[52:16] that's been put in the book has been
[52:18] redeemed and it's finished
[52:22] right now these seals were broken for a
[52:25] reason
[52:28] for a reason and brother brown explains
[52:29] that he said the seals was broke why
[52:32] he said in the last church ages to
[52:34] reveal these last church age to reveal
[52:36] these truths why
[52:38] the lamb broke the seals and revealed
[52:41] them to his church
[52:42] in order to collect his subjects for his
[52:45] kingdom
[52:46] his bride so the reason why he did it
[52:49] was to get us
[52:50] we could say it that way to claim us
[52:54] amen to rapture us the seals had to be
[52:57] broken
[52:59] it tells me the seals had to be broken
[53:01] before the rapture
[53:03] not after the saints rise but the seals
[53:06] were broke before
[53:07] the rapture amen and so
[53:11] now he said he wants to bring his
[53:12] subjects he said he wants to bring his
[53:15] subjects to him
[53:16] now and that's what he's doing we're
[53:19] drawing he wants to bring us to the word
[53:21] now so we can go at home with him
[53:24] so this is the hour when we are drawing
[53:26] close to him drawing close to the word
[53:29] he's done that in our in our hearts and
[53:31] our souls but there's coming a time of
[53:33] full redemption when these bodies are
[53:34] changed as well
[53:35] so brother brown says talk about a happy
[53:37] time when them seals broke
[53:39] john must have looked in and seen past
[53:41] the curtain of time
[53:43] now notice he said john looked in and
[53:46] seen past the curtain of time
[53:48] and said there is john
[53:53] now that kind of lays the background for
[53:54] where i want to go today because
[53:56] as he said who is worthy to open the
[53:59] book and to look thereon
[54:02] well john must have been worthy
[54:05] right john must have been worthy who is
[54:08] john in the book of revelation john is
[54:10] the type of the bride
[54:12] so there must have been a worthiness
[54:14] that was placed on him that wasn't there
[54:16] before
[54:18] right because he wept with the rest of
[54:22] them because there was no one worthy
[54:25] and john wept and the elder said don't
[54:27] weep john
[54:28] because the lion of the tribe of judah
[54:30] had prevailed
[54:32] so he was just like the rest of them he
[54:33] was standing there without any hope
[54:35] without any
[54:36] here the whole book everything he said
[54:38] brother robert said he knew everything
[54:39] would be lost
[54:41] the earth and everything on it would be
[54:42] destroyed because
[54:44] because that was the title deed to
[54:45] redemption but
[54:47] now because the book was open he's able
[54:51] to look amen
[54:54] he was found worthy to look what
[54:56] happened a lamb
[55:00] john was worthy because the lamb was
[55:02] worthy don't ever forget that you're
[55:04] only
[55:05] as worthy as your lamb is you're only as
[55:08] worthy as your husband is when you're
[55:10] the bride of christ you're only
[55:11] as worthy as christ and nothing we can
[55:13] do can change
[55:14] that you're only as worthy
[55:17] as he is no matter what you've done no
[55:20] matter how many times you go to church
[55:22] how well you pay your tithe
[55:23] those things are things that christians
[55:24] do but but you're never more worthy than
[55:27] your lamb
[55:28] and nothing that you've ever done could
[55:30] ever take the place he
[55:32] he gives you he imputes his worthiness
[55:34] to you
[55:36] oh my aren't you glad that he did that
[55:39] for us today
[55:41] he imputes his worthiness to us he
[55:43] credits it to us so imputation is a
[55:45] credit
[55:45] it's like if you had a bank account and
[55:47] the and the bank account was empty
[55:49] and maybe overdrawn and you didn't have
[55:51] a way to do it and i walked up there one
[55:52] day and and put
[55:54] fifty thousand dollars in your bank
[55:55] account what would you do it was
[55:57] imputation you didn't do anything
[55:59] you didn't deserve it you the one that
[56:01] run it in the red
[56:03] but somebody credited to your account
[56:06] and so his holiness was credited to us
[56:08] his righteousness
[56:10] was credited to us his worthiness was
[56:13] credited to john
[56:14] so john can now take the book and look
[56:16] at it
[56:18] see his name in it aren't you glad for
[56:22] the word this morning
[56:24] no man was worthy but now john could
[56:27] look
[56:29] and so we feel unworthy but
[56:32] you're only as unworthy as your lamb is
[56:35] what does that say about the lamb
[56:39] now brother branham takes this a little
[56:42] further
[56:43] and he says you know we're not seeing
[56:45] actual names there he says it this way
[56:47] the book doesn't say now lee vale
[56:50] is to be saved in the time of this
[56:51] church age or arma neville
[56:53] or whoever no it don't say that
[56:57] it just shows the mystery it shows the
[57:00] mystery unfolds the mystery of what the
[57:02] thing is
[57:03] we ourselves by faith
[57:07] believe it
[57:11] no matter how many times you read it and
[57:13] you look at it and you listen to the
[57:14] tapes you can go in and look at the
[57:16] opening of the word
[57:17] all these things you're never going to
[57:18] hear him say your name
[57:21] right unless you happen to be there and
[57:24] we're called out in the prayer lines or
[57:26] he was your friend or something like
[57:27] that but you're never going to hear him
[57:28] just say armand neville's in the book
[57:31] ben pruitt's in the book
[57:33] right whatever your name is you're in
[57:36] the book
[57:37] you're never going to hear him say that
[57:38] but by faith you believe it
[57:41] why because there's an identification
[57:43] there
[57:45] something about it amen something about
[57:48] the opening of the word and this is why
[57:49] we don't want to attract the people's
[57:50] attention
[57:51] by anything else we don't want to
[57:53] attract the people's attention by pencil
[57:55] or even by by miracles and signs those
[57:58] those things go along with the opening
[58:00] of the word
[58:00] but we attract the people's attention by
[58:02] the word
[58:04] because it is the word that changes us
[58:07] it's the word that makes us worthy amen
[58:10] and it's the word that shows us who we
[58:12] are now
[58:13] so brother battle says it just shows the
[58:15] mystery unfolds it but we ourselves by
[58:17] faith believe it
[58:18] someone said now and this is a
[58:21] continuation of the same quote so
[58:23] brother ryan was continuing in his
[58:24] thought
[58:25] he said someone said well there is no
[58:27] need in me trying it
[58:29] brother branham said there's only one be
[58:30] saved out of jeffersonville
[58:33] he said now see it's showing a parable
[58:35] that's where people misunderstand things
[58:36] that brother branham said
[58:38] he said it's showing a parable that
[58:40] isn't it there might be thousands saved
[58:43] he said i don't know i hope every one of
[58:45] them is saved
[58:47] but i don't know but here's the way i
[58:49] want to believe it
[58:50] i'm that one amen
[58:54] and then he says you believe the same
[58:55] for you
[58:57] because they thought well if brother
[58:58] branham said there'd be one in
[58:59] jeffersonville and he's there
[59:02] then where does that leave everybody
[59:03] else
[59:05] we know he's a prophet so that just
[59:06] leaves everybody else listen the devil
[59:08] can give you any excuse in the world
[59:10] to try to make you think you can't make
[59:12] it but you can make it if you want to
[59:13] make it
[59:16] right and so he said there might be
[59:17] thousands he said you believe the same
[59:19] for you if you don't then there's
[59:20] something wrong with your faith you're
[59:22] not sure
[59:23] what you're doing now notice how he
[59:25] takes this and he says
[59:27] he he takes it to his own ministry he
[59:28] said how can you walk up there in the
[59:30] face of death
[59:31] when you're not too sure whether you're
[59:32] saved or not he talks about when you die
[59:35] and then he says how can you go down
[59:36] here
[59:37] and say to this crippled man laying here
[59:39] blinded and twisted up thus saith the
[59:41] lord
[59:42] rise up jesus christ makes you whole you
[59:45] say well i could never
[59:46] say that what peter and john did they
[59:49] said look on us
[59:51] and they said rise up and and be whole
[59:54] and and what was that doing that they
[59:56] something inside of them inspired them
[59:58] to that
[1:00:00] it wasn't just them saying it but there
[1:00:03] was inspiration there
[1:00:04] and when they saw it it was thus saith
[1:00:06] the lord they believed it
[1:00:09] so he said you have to know what you're
[1:00:11] talking about
[1:00:13] because you go say that to somebody that
[1:00:15] just like the pentecostals do today
[1:00:17] just tell everybody that and thus saith
[1:00:19] the lord thus saith the lord well if
[1:00:20] it's not true you're a false prophet
[1:00:23] right but if you have inspiration of
[1:00:25] that and you know that it's true
[1:00:27] it won't be just a feeling but it's it's
[1:00:30] you know that it's true
[1:00:32] he said you better know what i have to
[1:00:33] know what you're talking about you say
[1:00:35] he said well say death claims everything
[1:00:37] it's all gone
[1:00:38] yeah he said but when the word of god is
[1:00:41] revealed
[1:00:43] i think i skipped over the second part
[1:00:44] of that yeah he said how can you stand
[1:00:46] go back to that part before i'm sorry he
[1:00:49] said how can you stand that old
[1:00:50] cold stiff body laying there that's dead
[1:00:53] and been dead for hours and hours
[1:00:56] and laying there cold and stiff and say
[1:00:57] thus saith the lord rise up to your feet
[1:01:01] brother makes the bold statement that if
[1:01:03] abra if if god told him if the angel
[1:01:05] lord told him
[1:01:06] that abraham lincoln would rise from the
[1:01:08] dead
[1:01:10] he'd call the newspapers and tell them
[1:01:12] and he'd gather all around abraham
[1:01:14] lincoln's grave because he believed it
[1:01:15] would take place
[1:01:17] he said but god hasn't told me that
[1:01:20] right he could only do what god told him
[1:01:21] and jesus said the same thing
[1:01:23] but here he said how can you stand that
[1:01:25] old cold stiff body laying there instead
[1:01:27] been dead for hours and hours
[1:01:28] laying there cold and stiff and say thus
[1:01:30] saith the lord rise up to your feet you
[1:01:32] better
[1:01:32] he said you have to know what you're
[1:01:34] talking about
[1:01:36] well say death claims everything it's
[1:01:38] all gone yeah but when the word of god
[1:01:40] is revealed
[1:01:41] and you know it's god that changes
[1:01:44] things
[1:01:46] right so if you keep it all as a whole
[1:01:50] he's saying you won't see your name
[1:01:51] there but it's a revelation
[1:01:54] it's a revelation the same kind of
[1:01:55] revelation that brother branham or
[1:01:56] someone else would have to get
[1:01:58] in order to raise up a dead person
[1:02:02] i hope you're with me this morning see
[1:02:04] we're going to have to have that kind of
[1:02:06] a revelation about what we believe
[1:02:09] because these bodies have to change so
[1:02:12] there's going to have to be a people who
[1:02:13] are sure
[1:02:15] they're positive that they're going to
[1:02:17] make it they're positive that they're
[1:02:19] going in the rapture
[1:02:21] they're not worried that satan might be
[1:02:22] able to thwart it or take it out but
[1:02:24] there's got to be a people and that's
[1:02:25] why i believe
[1:02:26] these things were revealed in this hour
[1:02:28] we predestination election and all these
[1:02:30] things
[1:02:31] he taught he says you're the gene seed
[1:02:32] of god you can't die anymore then god
[1:02:34] could die
[1:02:35] how could how could we ever believe
[1:02:37] those things we believe it because it's
[1:02:38] who we are
[1:02:40] and he tells us that in this hour
[1:02:42] because we've got to be the ones to
[1:02:45] take this old dead body
[1:02:49] one thing to speak to a dead body in the
[1:02:51] casket and say rise up that's been dead
[1:02:53] for hours and hours but we've got to be
[1:02:55] able to save
[1:02:55] this old dead body rise up from dead
[1:02:59] denominations increase
[1:03:01] and one day you're going to speak or you
[1:03:04] hear me today church you're going to
[1:03:05] speak
[1:03:06] and it'll be the last time and all of a
[1:03:07] sudden things will change in a moment in
[1:03:09] the twinkling of an eye
[1:03:10] you go into a new body what is it it's
[1:03:13] something inside of you you're positive
[1:03:15] you have the earnest of it today
[1:03:18] you know just like john john could
[1:03:20] rejoice because he looked there and said
[1:03:21] there's john
[1:03:23] and we can rejoice and say that's me
[1:03:26] mama that's me like the little boy in
[1:03:29] the mirror
[1:03:31] now he said
[1:03:35] well say death claims everything it's
[1:03:37] all gone yeah but when the word of god
[1:03:38] is revealed
[1:03:39] and you know it's god that changes
[1:03:41] things
[1:03:43] that's right what makes you worthy
[1:03:47] what makes you worthy to be able to do
[1:03:49] that to be able to look and see that
[1:03:51] you're redeemed to partake in that
[1:03:52] redemption
[1:03:55] and no one was worthy but john looked
[1:03:59] how was he able to look at it now we
[1:04:01] know that if you're a seed of god you
[1:04:03] always were a seed of god
[1:04:05] you didn't become one when you were
[1:04:07] saved that seed was
[1:04:09] was given germination it was given life
[1:04:13] it came alive but there was always a
[1:04:16] life just like a seed that you would
[1:04:18] plant in the ground always a life inside
[1:04:19] of it
[1:04:22] it had been recently i've heard that
[1:04:25] china has been mailing people seeds
[1:04:28] they don't know what they're for people
[1:04:31] are getting them in the mail
[1:04:32] it's true i've seen the packages on some
[1:04:33] of them they're mailing people seats
[1:04:35] and they've got chinese writing on them
[1:04:37] and i guess they think people are just
[1:04:38] going to go out there and spread them
[1:04:39] out in their yard
[1:04:41] and it might be an invasive species or
[1:04:42] something they don't know what it is why
[1:04:44] would they have these seeds
[1:04:45] why is china mailing people in in rural
[1:04:49] counties and things seeds so they're
[1:04:51] asking you not to plant them
[1:04:53] that's your public service message for
[1:04:54] today
[1:04:56] don't plant those seeds but why are they
[1:04:58] doing that because they expect them to
[1:04:59] come to life
[1:05:02] right they expect that somehow the seed
[1:05:04] will find a way
[1:05:06] even if whatever it is if it's some
[1:05:08] company trying to promote themselves or
[1:05:09] if it's some
[1:05:10] if it's a chinese government trying to a
[1:05:12] real conspiracy theorist you could say
[1:05:14] well it's the government trying to
[1:05:15] spread these wild seeds all over the
[1:05:17] country and try to
[1:05:18] invasive species and kill our crops it
[1:05:20] could be
[1:05:22] we don't know but what it is they expect
[1:05:24] that seed to come up
[1:05:26] and it won't come up in the package but
[1:05:27] when you put it in the right atmosphere
[1:05:29] it'll come up
[1:05:30] and that's the way we are as as
[1:05:32] christians if you put a christian put a
[1:05:35] a person who's a seed of god but not yet
[1:05:37] been born again in the right atmosphere
[1:05:39] that seed will begin to quicken
[1:05:41] a seed begins to come to life now but if
[1:05:44] you were
[1:05:45] a seed of god today you always were a
[1:05:46] seed of god
[1:05:48] your name was on the book before time
[1:05:50] began we know that
[1:05:52] yet you were born in sin and when you
[1:05:54] were born i think we misunderstand this
[1:05:56] we have exactly the same
[1:05:58] standing as anyone else no we're not the
[1:06:01] same as everybody else
[1:06:03] but we have the same standing with god
[1:06:07] we're enemies to god when we're born
[1:06:12] whether we're elected or not we're
[1:06:15] enemies of god we're sons we can be
[1:06:16] redeemed
[1:06:18] but we come into the world enemies to
[1:06:19] god
[1:06:21] we're born in sin shape and iniquity
[1:06:24] coming to the world speaking lies all of
[1:06:26] us are
[1:06:27] we have that serpent nature but
[1:06:31] you are different but the difference is
[1:06:35] not necessarily
[1:06:36] you know and as i said if you look at
[1:06:39] worthiness as what you've done
[1:06:42] and you think back over your life and
[1:06:43] think well i didn't do as many bad
[1:06:45] things as this person did
[1:06:47] that must mean i'm the seed of god i
[1:06:50] don't know where we get that
[1:06:52] the truth is you might do more bad
[1:06:54] things
[1:06:57] because the seed what the seed does is
[1:06:59] not just keep you from doing bad things
[1:07:02] and we watch brother branham's life and
[1:07:04] we see sometimes how
[1:07:05] things happen in his life and and you
[1:07:07] see that and you think well
[1:07:09] that'll be the way my life is but
[1:07:11] someone has said that
[1:07:12] you know brother branham tried to kill
[1:07:14] himself because he got so
[1:07:16] uh so upset about his wife dying he
[1:07:19] tried to
[1:07:19] try to put a pistol to his head well you
[1:07:21] might try that and be successful
[1:07:26] don't go there because you might try
[1:07:29] that and be successful
[1:07:30] god was protecting his prophet and god
[1:07:32] may protect you in
[1:07:33] very similar ways but he's protecting
[1:07:35] you for some purpose
[1:07:38] but but as seed it doesn't mean we can't
[1:07:40] get that down
[1:07:43] right and a prophet of god took a rifle
[1:07:46] and tried to kill a bunch of boys
[1:07:49] and would have done it but god protected
[1:07:51] him because he spent the rest of his
[1:07:52] life in juvenile prison or whatever that
[1:07:54] it was and
[1:07:55] we could have never had a message god's
[1:07:58] protecting he said don't ever smoke
[1:07:59] drink or
[1:08:00] defile your body in any way because i
[1:08:02] got a work to do when you get older
[1:08:03] we look at that say well that's because
[1:08:05] he was seed no that's because he was a
[1:08:06] prophet
[1:08:08] god had something for him to do god
[1:08:09] might do that he might keep certain
[1:08:11] individuals for from certain things so
[1:08:12] that they can
[1:08:13] produce something later in their life
[1:08:15] and but but then others he may let him
[1:08:16] go through those things
[1:08:19] right and so you're different but you're
[1:08:22] different in the way
[1:08:23] jacob was different jacob was not a
[1:08:26] better man than esau
[1:08:30] you know proof of that and questions and
[1:08:32] answers brother brown says esau was a
[1:08:33] far better man
[1:08:35] in every way you wanted to take it than
[1:08:38] jacob was
[1:08:40] that's pretty blunt isn't it he was a
[1:08:43] better man
[1:08:43] in every way you wanted to take it than
[1:08:45] jacob was
[1:08:47] he explains that a little further in the
[1:08:49] ephesians church he said now both of
[1:08:50] them was religious
[1:08:52] but esau when it come to works and these
[1:08:54] as a good legalist
[1:08:55] he was probably a better boy all the way
[1:08:57] around than jacob was
[1:09:00] he said did you know that jacob was just
[1:09:01] a little boy that hung around with his
[1:09:02] mammy all the time
[1:09:04] but esau got out and worked went out and
[1:09:06] got venison to give his old blind daddy
[1:09:08] who was a prophet
[1:09:10] now think think in message terms about
[1:09:13] the story of jacob and esau
[1:09:15] how much better of a message person esau
[1:09:17] was
[1:09:19] than jacob was because esau
[1:09:23] cared for a prophet esau
[1:09:26] got out and worked huh
[1:09:30] i'm not those are good things those are
[1:09:34] things jacob should have done
[1:09:38] but he didn't do it he saw got out and
[1:09:40] worked he saw
[1:09:41] got the deer he was a hunter he was a he
[1:09:44] would have been a great
[1:09:45] message person
[1:09:49] was tough he was a man's man
[1:09:53] but jacob he says he saw got out and
[1:09:56] worked
[1:09:56] he tried to take care of him but jacob
[1:09:57] only had one thing in mind
[1:10:00] he wanted that birthright he didn't care
[1:10:03] how long he had to hang around
[1:10:05] or whatever he had to do the main thing
[1:10:08] in his life
[1:10:10] was the birthright
[1:10:13] and esau despised it
[1:10:16] esau was a good man but it wasn't
[1:10:19] important to him
[1:10:22] oh i hope you hear me today the word of
[1:10:24] god has got to be important to you
[1:10:27] and i think satan is challenging us
[1:10:29] today with all that we're going through
[1:10:31] is the word of god important enough to
[1:10:33] us
[1:10:34] for us to seek it out is it important
[1:10:37] enough to us
[1:10:38] so that we would be immersed in the word
[1:10:40] of god or do we just spend all of our
[1:10:42] time doing other things
[1:10:44] is it important to us now he said the
[1:10:47] main thing was the birthright and esau
[1:10:49] despised it
[1:10:50] in harvest time again brother brown said
[1:10:51] no esau morally was a better man than
[1:10:53] jacob
[1:10:55] but he didn't have respect to his
[1:10:57] birthright which was the word
[1:11:01] oh my he could just cross the word not
[1:11:04] think anything about it
[1:11:08] what qualified jacob
[1:11:11] we talk about bride material bride
[1:11:14] material and that
[1:11:15] comes from where brother brown talks
[1:11:17] about there being a lady said like it
[1:11:18] had some goods
[1:11:19] she'd take a piece of material and she'd
[1:11:21] cut out a part of that material and she
[1:11:24] said that was like the bride and the
[1:11:25] rest of it he said it's all the same
[1:11:26] material
[1:11:28] right you take the materials all all the
[1:11:31] same but he cuts his bride he chooses
[1:11:34] out of that material a pattern
[1:11:36] right for his of his bride and and bride
[1:11:39] material brother brandon mentions bride
[1:11:40] material a couple times in the message
[1:11:42] what it was to be bribed material but
[1:11:44] never in the context that sometimes we
[1:11:45] take it to be
[1:11:47] and we've taken that to be if your bride
[1:11:48] material you won't do certain things
[1:11:51] if your bride material you won't you
[1:11:53] won't go you want you won't fall that so
[1:11:55] far
[1:11:58] your flesh is the same as any other
[1:11:59] flesh the material is all the same
[1:12:02] the part that qualifies you to be in the
[1:12:04] bride is the seed
[1:12:09] no god does work in your life prior to
[1:12:12] you being born again
[1:12:14] but jacob wouldn't have been considered
[1:12:15] bride material
[1:12:17] he didn't hunt her fish was a mama's boy
[1:12:22] what qualified him
[1:12:25] it was a seed it was god's election
[1:12:30] now look not even the natural seed same
[1:12:32] parents
[1:12:33] but look now we know that god allowed
[1:12:37] your think about this for a moment he
[1:12:38] allowed your great grandparents to me
[1:12:40] let's say
[1:12:42] and farther back than that because he's
[1:12:44] god he can go all the way back
[1:12:46] but let's just keep it where we can
[1:12:47] understand it your great-grandparents
[1:12:49] met somewhere now you don't know and
[1:12:52] i don't know your great-grandparents but
[1:12:54] let's just say mine because
[1:12:55] i know my family wasn't any good and
[1:12:59] your great-grandparents might have met
[1:13:01] in a bar
[1:13:03] god allowed them to meet
[1:13:06] there might have been a situation where
[1:13:08] there was uh and we look at this today
[1:13:10] people
[1:13:10] again misunderstand because what brother
[1:13:12] branham taught
[1:13:13] it's such an awful sin to cohabitate
[1:13:17] without marriage
[1:13:18] it's a horrible thing and when children
[1:13:20] were produced by that in the old
[1:13:21] testament they couldn't come in the
[1:13:22] congregation of the lord brother brown
[1:13:24] talks about the blood of christ takes
[1:13:25] care of that
[1:13:27] right removes that but say your great
[1:13:28] grandparents you don't know
[1:13:30] you know there may have been way back
[1:13:31] there somewhere an illegitimate child
[1:13:35] an unmarried person that come together
[1:13:37] and god allowed that to happen he didn't
[1:13:39] make it happen but he allowed it to
[1:13:41] happen knew it would happen and caused
[1:13:42] things to
[1:13:43] fall a certain way
[1:13:47] think about that he allowed and we think
[1:13:49] of this all in the good that god allowed
[1:13:51] my grandparents to come together and
[1:13:52] they were good people my great
[1:13:54] grandparents to come together they were
[1:13:55] good people and that made me a good
[1:13:56] person no
[1:13:57] that's not the purpose of what he's
[1:13:59] doing
[1:14:00] he's not producing good people
[1:14:05] he's bringing the elect to a birth
[1:14:10] i wish we'd realize that i'm trying to
[1:14:12] stay out of your
[1:14:13] your space here trying to distance from
[1:14:16] you but
[1:14:17] but you know i wish we'd recognize that
[1:14:20] god is not
[1:14:20] looking for good people he didn't come
[1:14:23] to this church to make us a bunch of
[1:14:24] good people
[1:14:26] he didn't bring us here because the
[1:14:27] baptist can do that the assembly of god
[1:14:29] can do that there's lots of people out
[1:14:31] there that can better your life
[1:14:33] that can teach you how to have a better
[1:14:34] life that's not what he's doing
[1:14:36] but why did he bring your
[1:14:37] great-grandparents together your
[1:14:39] grandparents together your parents
[1:14:40] together
[1:14:41] what did he do it for to bring you to a
[1:14:44] place of a birth
[1:14:49] god help us today maybe he had to
[1:14:52] bring you down to a place where you you
[1:14:55] just had to understand you were so
[1:14:57] wicked
[1:14:58] in order to be saved so he allowed
[1:15:02] sinners to meet one another
[1:15:04] and people in an awful family he doesn't
[1:15:07] just allow the good side but he allows
[1:15:09] the bad side
[1:15:12] and you see that in jacob that of all
[1:15:15] the genes that jacob could have gotten
[1:15:16] he got the worst
[1:15:17] ones now if you go back and study their
[1:15:21] families you'll find out that
[1:15:23] in isaac and rebecca's family there were
[1:15:25] certain
[1:15:26] certain traits that were there
[1:15:29] and some of those traits were good these
[1:15:32] were men who start began nations they
[1:15:34] were great men
[1:15:36] patriarchs and but they also had some
[1:15:40] problems
[1:15:42] so in this family were things you see in
[1:15:44] esau there was
[1:15:45] the ability to go out and make way for
[1:15:46] themselves and do all of these things
[1:15:48] become a great man financially in this
[1:15:52] family with all those things but also
[1:15:53] the things you see in jacob
[1:15:56] jacob got a double dose of it
[1:16:00] because god allowed and even drew isaac
[1:16:02] and rebecca together
[1:16:04] but there was a strain of cowardice and
[1:16:06] deception in isaac's family
[1:16:10] you can go back to abraham and see it in
[1:16:12] isaac himself and see it
[1:16:14] abraham lies about his wife twice
[1:16:19] isaac does it once
[1:16:23] and it comes on down and but those men
[1:16:27] were good men
[1:16:28] they were godly men but that strains in
[1:16:31] the family
[1:16:33] and then here on rebecca's side if you
[1:16:36] look at rebecca's side and find out that
[1:16:38] that rebecca and come from in her own
[1:16:41] country was where laban was
[1:16:42] and you'll find out that in her country
[1:16:44] and that's where rachel come from that's
[1:16:46] on that side there were there was
[1:16:49] manipulation
[1:16:52] think about it laban was constantly
[1:16:54] manipulating
[1:16:56] and and so jacob gets that too
[1:16:59] you look at rebecca herself she
[1:17:01] manipulates her own husband to get jacob
[1:17:03] the blessing
[1:17:06] so there's a strain of that and it comes
[1:17:09] out in jacob and jacob is
[1:17:10] manipulative cowardly and deceptive
[1:17:16] and he's the worst of the whole bunch
[1:17:19] because it kind of that gene didn't
[1:17:20] manifest itself really fully
[1:17:23] until jacob's time and we talked about
[1:17:24] gene expression and how
[1:17:26] that if you take a mouse and you scare
[1:17:29] the grandfather
[1:17:30] with the electric shock the grandkids
[1:17:32] although they've never been shocked to
[1:17:34] be still scared of that
[1:17:35] because it's in their genes it's just
[1:17:37] how they're expressed and
[1:17:39] but but you take them you take those
[1:17:41] same mice and put them in a loving
[1:17:42] family give them a mother and let them
[1:17:45] be in a loving family
[1:17:46] those same mice won't express those
[1:17:48] genes
[1:17:50] so jacob when he was growing up had
[1:17:51] problems at home because
[1:17:53] isaac favored one child and rebecca
[1:17:54] favored the other one
[1:17:58] right growing up in the prophet's home
[1:17:59] but they had problems
[1:18:01] should give us all of us comfort
[1:18:04] but they had problems there in the
[1:18:06] prophet's house they there was a strain
[1:18:08] of these things in and they come and it
[1:18:10] seemed like the worst of it come out in
[1:18:11] jacob
[1:18:13] now brother brown tells us that he said
[1:18:16] you were in your great great great
[1:18:17] grandfather all the way back
[1:18:19] physically speaking he said then that's
[1:18:22] what you are in physical being
[1:18:24] nature sometimes a child would be born
[1:18:27] in the family red-headed
[1:18:29] it astonishes the father because there's
[1:18:31] nobody he knows of his people
[1:18:33] red-headed or the mothers but if you go
[1:18:35] back to several generations
[1:18:37] you'll find out somebody was red-headed
[1:18:40] that seed keeps coming on down and you
[1:18:43] come the nature
[1:18:45] of one from way back
[1:18:50] so you have a child and you think where
[1:18:52] did he come from
[1:18:53] i look at my own children brother on it
[1:18:55] and i think peter's skinny as a rail
[1:18:58] and that boy eats constantly some of
[1:18:59] that's his age it'll catch up to him but
[1:19:01] i wasn't like i wasn't that skinny when
[1:19:03] i was that age wasn't built like that
[1:19:05] at all and and you think where did that
[1:19:07] come from well maybe his mother what
[1:19:09] could have come from my side
[1:19:10] but just way back right and
[1:19:14] you look at all of our children are
[1:19:16] different and then you see some of
[1:19:18] yourself in them and you see things that
[1:19:19] you never saw in you
[1:19:20] where did that come from
[1:19:24] well it come from way back plus how they
[1:19:26] were raised
[1:19:28] right because you did raise them you are
[1:19:30] raising them so that
[1:19:32] does make a difference so now he said
[1:19:35] you'll go back several generations
[1:19:36] you'll find out somebody was redheaded
[1:19:38] that seed keeps coming on down
[1:19:39] you come the nature of one from way back
[1:19:42] and so you have to watch that there's
[1:19:43] certain traits in your family
[1:19:45] and some of those things are in our
[1:19:47] flesh still
[1:19:49] the new birth does not save the flesh
[1:19:53] what it does is set a control tower
[1:19:55] there
[1:19:58] so that you don't have to do any sin
[1:20:01] there's a control tower there to keep
[1:20:02] you from it but if you do sin you have
[1:20:04] an advocate with god
[1:20:06] but you won't live in sin because if you
[1:20:09] live in sin that control tower there's
[1:20:11] no way that could be there and you just
[1:20:12] live in sin
[1:20:14] right it's impossible because that
[1:20:16] control tower will bring you to
[1:20:18] repentance
[1:20:19] so it takes dominion over the flesh but
[1:20:21] those genes are still there
[1:20:23] brother charlie cox told a story i
[1:20:25] remember from his testimony how that he
[1:20:27] told a story
[1:20:28] uh he had a problem with how he spoke to
[1:20:30] his wife none of us have ever had that
[1:20:33] problem
[1:20:34] but he had a problem with how he spoke
[1:20:35] to his wife and he would speak to her in
[1:20:37] the wrong way and then he wouldn't speak
[1:20:38] to her for days
[1:20:40] and it comes from his
[1:20:44] his fam his family his dad was worse
[1:20:46] than he was
[1:20:47] and his grandparents but he didn't
[1:20:49] realize that and he talks to brother
[1:20:50] branham about it how
[1:20:51] how do i overcome this and and brother
[1:20:53] branham just asking he says
[1:20:55] well he says that come from way back
[1:20:57] probably your great-grandparents
[1:20:59] and he said well how do i get rid of it
[1:21:01] and brother brad i'm just asking him
[1:21:02] said how old are you
[1:21:04] that's all he said never prayed for him
[1:21:08] never talked to him anymore i just said
[1:21:09] how old are you and the reason was
[1:21:11] because brother charlie being
[1:21:12] a saved man a born again believer
[1:21:15] and i believe you are this morning if
[1:21:17] you're a born-again believer then
[1:21:19] as time goes on you'll overcome that
[1:21:22] brother charlie said
[1:21:23] his testimony was that he did but
[1:21:26] there's things that
[1:21:26] just the way you are and it helps us
[1:21:28] kind of deal with other people too you
[1:21:30] got to have love for somebody that's
[1:21:31] different because
[1:21:32] you're just not going to think like they
[1:21:33] do that's why marriage is so hard
[1:21:36] right because you you're not going to
[1:21:39] think like somebody else
[1:21:42] huh and maybe years later you get to
[1:21:44] where and brother danny was talking to
[1:21:46] me how that you guys think alike you
[1:21:47] know and sometimes you can kind of read
[1:21:48] each other's minds and
[1:21:50] and and that's what he said sister vicky
[1:21:52] i don't know
[1:21:54] she said back there thinking well he
[1:21:55] don't read my mind very well
[1:21:59] but you know that's that's something
[1:22:02] that we
[1:22:03] that's something that that marriage does
[1:22:05] is brings together those two strains and
[1:22:07] we got to work that out
[1:22:09] but you put god in the middle of that
[1:22:10] it'll work it out
[1:22:12] amen someone says what what who's the
[1:22:15] one that i'm supposed to be married to
[1:22:17] the one you're supposed you're married
[1:22:18] to now
[1:22:20] if you're a married person the person
[1:22:23] that you were that was you were meant to
[1:22:24] be with is the one you're married to
[1:22:28] why would you ever think anything
[1:22:29] different
[1:22:32] if you're in the church you're believing
[1:22:33] god for healing you're believing god for
[1:22:34] salvation why would you ever think i
[1:22:36] can't be saved
[1:22:38] well this marriage is useless i'll just
[1:22:39] move on to another one no god put you
[1:22:41] there for a reason
[1:22:44] i'm just hopeless there's no way no god
[1:22:46] put you there for a reason who is worthy
[1:22:51] god made you the way you are allowed you
[1:22:53] to be the way that you are
[1:22:56] so why why you say well if i had
[1:22:59] it was the bride i'd have better genes
[1:23:01] some of the brown says you were all
[1:23:02] pre-planned by god
[1:23:04] nothing happens by chance with god he
[1:23:07] knows all about it it's all pre-planned
[1:23:09] he said for many generations back
[1:23:11] what was it pre-planned for
[1:23:14] he never said it you were pre-planned to
[1:23:16] be a good person
[1:23:18] he said you were pre-planned so that you
[1:23:20] could be here tonight
[1:23:23] you were pre-planned so that you could
[1:23:25] be here tonight why
[1:23:27] what is that an opportunity you were
[1:23:29] pre-planned so you would have an
[1:23:31] opportunity to be saved amen
[1:23:35] and he did whatever it took to get you
[1:23:37] here
[1:23:40] are you with me say what is my life why
[1:23:42] did it go the way it did why do i have
[1:23:44] the genes that i do why have i expressed
[1:23:46] the things that i have
[1:23:46] because he brought you all this way so
[1:23:49] that you could be where you are
[1:23:51] so that you could be here today
[1:23:57] he brought jacob he had to nature him in
[1:23:59] such a way that it would force him into
[1:24:01] an encounter
[1:24:03] with the angel of the covenant it
[1:24:06] doesn't excuse what he did
[1:24:08] doesn't make it right but there come a
[1:24:10] day when jacob changed
[1:24:13] amen and we'd have probably given up on
[1:24:16] him a lot
[1:24:17] a lot before god did but god waited
[1:24:20] until he was 80 years old
[1:24:22] when he was about 80 years old he's
[1:24:24] there by the side of the
[1:24:25] of the creek and here comes an angel and
[1:24:28] he wrestles with him all night
[1:24:31] now look
[1:24:35] paul deals with pharisees still have
[1:24:37] some today
[1:24:39] and a lot of times legalism manifests
[1:24:41] itself in strange ways
[1:24:43] i don't find it so much you know
[1:24:45] legalism will manifest itself in
[1:24:47] in touching on taste not handle not and
[1:24:50] don't wear short long
[1:24:51] or long short sleeves and don't you know
[1:24:53] you have to measure your skirts and
[1:24:55] things like that that we call that
[1:24:56] legalism
[1:24:57] it does manifest itself in that way but
[1:24:59] more often what i find is it manifests
[1:25:01] in a critical spirit
[1:25:04] and so the legalist is critical of
[1:25:05] everybody and sometimes themselves
[1:25:09] and illegalists can actually put
[1:25:11] themselves out of the rapture
[1:25:14] and paul dealt with these legalists and
[1:25:16] pharisees in romans two and three
[1:25:18] these jews that thought they knew
[1:25:19] everything but they did they didn't do
[1:25:21] what they what they taught
[1:25:23] but he says and thank you sal this o man
[1:25:25] that judges them which do such things
[1:25:26] and do us the same
[1:25:28] that thou should escape the judgment of
[1:25:29] god
[1:25:31] but listen what he says or despises thou
[1:25:34] the riches
[1:25:36] of his goodness and forbearance and
[1:25:39] long-suffering
[1:25:41] not knowing that the goodness of god
[1:25:44] leadeth thee to repentance
[1:25:48] pharisees he said can a pharisee be
[1:25:50] saved paul was
[1:25:52] paul said he was the chiefest of sinners
[1:25:54] because he was a sinner he was a
[1:25:55] pharisee
[1:25:58] and god had to knock him down to make
[1:26:00] him realize he needed to be saved
[1:26:04] you despise the riches of god's goodness
[1:26:06] and forbearance and long-suffering
[1:26:08] not knowing that it's the goodness of
[1:26:09] god
[1:26:11] it's actually leading you to repentance
[1:26:13] it's not
[1:26:14] you say well god blessed me yes it's his
[1:26:16] goodness
[1:26:19] it's his goodness it's leading you to
[1:26:21] repentance
[1:26:23] he's let you be here this morning or
[1:26:24] wherever that you're at today are you
[1:26:26] watching you listen
[1:26:27] you think god let me be here for a
[1:26:28] reason why did he have me here
[1:26:30] because he's leading you to repentance
[1:26:33] yes he's blessed you yes he's good to
[1:26:35] you yes there's times he withholds his
[1:26:37] blessings from you there's times you put
[1:26:39] allow you to go through things why
[1:26:41] because the forbearance of god
[1:26:42] he wants you to be led to repentance
[1:26:48] he saw got all the good genes as we said
[1:26:51] and despised the birthright jacob got
[1:26:53] all the bad genes and coveted the
[1:26:54] birthright
[1:26:58] because the bible says the children
[1:26:59] being not yet born neither having done
[1:27:00] any good or evil
[1:27:02] that the purpose of god according to
[1:27:03] election might stand
[1:27:06] not of works but of him that calleth
[1:27:11] esau thought he was right but jacob knew
[1:27:14] he was a sinner
[1:27:17] he saw all all that happened when thing
[1:27:19] bad things happened to esau he just got
[1:27:21] angry
[1:27:22] and blamed jacob for it i wanted to kill
[1:27:25] him
[1:27:26] but when bad things happened to jacob it
[1:27:28] led him over time
[1:27:30] eventually to repentance
[1:27:35] now watch not everybody's called for the
[1:27:38] same things
[1:27:39] and so you look at things that have
[1:27:41] happened in your life and genes that
[1:27:42] you've been allowed to inherit you think
[1:27:44] why this one why not the one that was
[1:27:47] able to make
[1:27:47] money right
[1:27:50] why not i've often wondered why i didn't
[1:27:53] get the
[1:27:54] sales gene from my dad my dad got
[1:27:57] had the sales ability he could sell
[1:28:00] things
[1:28:01] i didn't get that gene and i tried it
[1:28:05] i tried i went the same business he did
[1:28:06] i was his son great things were expected
[1:28:10] i couldn't sell nothing because here i
[1:28:12] was i was
[1:28:13] i felt such empathy for people i'm
[1:28:15] sitting there thinking you don't need
[1:28:16] this
[1:28:16] you know that's not the way to sell
[1:28:18] things
[1:28:20] right and my dad could sell
[1:28:25] you know he could sell a
[1:28:28] snow ice cream to an eskimo as the
[1:28:30] saying is
[1:28:32] he could sell anything i couldn't sell
[1:28:34] nothing why didn't i get that gene
[1:28:36] but god allows you to be who you are
[1:28:41] and and so god had to bring jacob the
[1:28:43] way that he was
[1:28:45] because he was going to break that
[1:28:46] generational curse
[1:28:51] that had limited itself in in abraham
[1:28:53] and in isaac but in
[1:28:55] but in jacob it would be manifested so
[1:28:57] it could be broken
[1:29:00] i hope you're hearing me today some of
[1:29:02] you got kids that are struggling and
[1:29:04] some of them are out and you think why
[1:29:05] did they have to go through those things
[1:29:07] in here i've been able to live for the
[1:29:08] lord and here they
[1:29:09] they're doing these things and i wonder
[1:29:10] why they have to go through those things
[1:29:12] because it has to be expressed so that
[1:29:15] it can be broken
[1:29:19] why because it would be joseph who would
[1:29:22] be the type of christ
[1:29:24] in perfection
[1:29:27] and let's look at it brother says
[1:29:29] abraham was the foundation of faith
[1:29:31] he said now let's say it had four
[1:29:32] foundations he's speaking on the
[1:29:33] masterpiece
[1:29:35] he said the foundation of faith was
[1:29:36] abraham the foundation of love was isaac
[1:29:39] the foundation of grace was jacob
[1:29:41] god's grace to jacob anyone knows that
[1:29:45] now think about this if all we had was
[1:29:47] abraham and isaac and then a skip to
[1:29:49] joseph
[1:29:51] we wouldn't have an example of grace
[1:29:54] in the in in those patriarchs but now he
[1:29:57] built his foundation
[1:29:58] he says faith and love and grace
[1:30:03] but in joseph was perfection there is
[1:30:06] where he could set the monument
[1:30:07] monument not the first foundation the
[1:30:10] second foundation
[1:30:10] the third foundation but on the fourth
[1:30:12] foundation
[1:30:14] abraham betrayed portrayed christ of
[1:30:16] course so did isaac in love abraham did
[1:30:18] in faith isaac didn't love
[1:30:20] jacob did by his grace
[1:30:23] amen he said because jacob means
[1:30:25] deceiver
[1:30:26] and that's what he was but god's grace
[1:30:30] was with him
[1:30:31] and when it but when it come to joseph
[1:30:33] there's nothing against him
[1:30:35] just one little scratch there was one
[1:30:37] little scratch where that gene
[1:30:39] come through remember what it was it's
[1:30:41] when he told his
[1:30:42] his parents or he told he said told his
[1:30:45] family he said go tell pharaoh
[1:30:46] that you're not shepherds
[1:30:50] that you heard cattle because this would
[1:30:53] tell them something different because
[1:30:55] they hate shepherds
[1:30:57] it's an abomination to them that little
[1:31:00] manipulative lying gene
[1:31:03] snuck in what was it for
[1:31:06] joseph perfect in every other way what
[1:31:09] was it for
[1:31:10] to show us that he wasn't the one
[1:31:13] amen amen he said well i'm just going to
[1:31:17] be perfect today
[1:31:17] from now on everything will be just
[1:31:19] right and those genes won't no they'll
[1:31:20] be from time to time
[1:31:21] you're just going to have to overcome
[1:31:23] them
[1:31:26] why because that little scratch shows
[1:31:29] you're not him but you're his bride
[1:31:31] you're not perfect because you're you
[1:31:33] you're perfect because you're the bride
[1:31:34] of christ
[1:31:37] amen
[1:31:40] it was a man i don't usually stop to
[1:31:42] tell a story and kind of in the middle
[1:31:43] here i'm not i'm
[1:31:44] i'm not that far from being done but i
[1:31:47] don't want to scare you
[1:31:49] but there was a man by the name of
[1:31:50] george young who was a carpenter and a
[1:31:52] preacher
[1:31:54] and in the late 1800s he
[1:31:57] labored in obscurity and served in small
[1:31:59] rural areas in the united states
[1:32:02] we don't even have a reliable record of
[1:32:04] the dates of his birth and death he was
[1:32:05] pretty much
[1:32:07] you know somebody that nobody knew
[1:32:11] his income was so small he had
[1:32:12] difficulty supporting his wife and
[1:32:14] family
[1:32:15] and he was one of them guys that was
[1:32:16] wishing he had that rich gene
[1:32:20] he kept on diligently serving the lord
[1:32:23] though through all those years and
[1:32:24] he died young as a middle-aged man
[1:32:30] they during this time that he was
[1:32:31] working
[1:32:33] after years of effort and sacrifice the
[1:32:36] youngs finally got to a place where they
[1:32:37] could build a house
[1:32:39] they were delighted with their new house
[1:32:40] but he went off to preach and somebody
[1:32:42] burned it down
[1:32:44] that's all they ever had they put
[1:32:47] everything they had into it that's all
[1:32:48] they ever had
[1:32:49] they were left homeless
[1:32:53] during his lifetime he writes a song
[1:32:57] and the title of it and you'll probably
[1:32:58] recognize it as god leads his dear
[1:33:00] children along
[1:33:02] god leads his dear children along
[1:33:05] and this has become such a blessing to
[1:33:07] so many people
[1:33:09] he wrote both the words and the music
[1:33:10] and there was a hymn writer by the name
[1:33:12] of halder lunas who was a great
[1:33:14] hymn writer and composer of hymn books
[1:33:15] and and he decided to track down he'd
[1:33:18] heard that this man's wife was still
[1:33:20] alive
[1:33:21] and he wanted to get the story of the
[1:33:22] hymn and so he goes to track her down
[1:33:25] and when he finally stops at a gas
[1:33:27] station in a small town where she lived
[1:33:29] and asked where she was
[1:33:32] and where the address that he had
[1:33:33] someone had given him was for and
[1:33:35] and the attendant said that's the county
[1:33:37] poor house
[1:33:39] that's where the people go don't have
[1:33:40] anything
[1:33:42] not knowing what to expect he made his
[1:33:44] way there and he found mrs young a tiny
[1:33:46] elderly woman
[1:33:48] and those horrible surroundings just
[1:33:50] just awful
[1:33:52] that in that day that she would have
[1:33:53] been in and but she had the joy of the
[1:33:56] lord
[1:33:58] and she spoke to the man to mr lillian
[1:34:00] as how he
[1:34:01] how the lord had guided her and her
[1:34:02] husband over many years
[1:34:05] and then she exclaimed to him she said
[1:34:06] doctor lillian has god
[1:34:08] led me here
[1:34:12] do you think god would have led you
[1:34:13] somewhere else other than the poor house
[1:34:16] but she said god led me here now think
[1:34:18] about this here this man
[1:34:19] never was really able and probably
[1:34:21] people other preachers probably looked
[1:34:22] down on him and said well he's just not
[1:34:24] much of a preacher
[1:34:25] he's not much of a businessman he's not
[1:34:27] much of a
[1:34:28] here he's worked all his life not been
[1:34:30] able to do anything wrote one hymn
[1:34:33] that people enjoyed but his wife said
[1:34:37] years later god led me here i'm so glad
[1:34:39] he did for you know about every month
[1:34:42] someone comes into this place to spend
[1:34:43] the rest of their days
[1:34:46] so many of them don't know jesus she
[1:34:48] said isn't it wonderful
[1:34:50] how god leads
[1:34:54] these are the words that her husband had
[1:34:55] written so many years before he said in
[1:34:57] shady green pastures so rich and so
[1:34:59] sweet god leads his dear children along
[1:35:02] where the waters cool flow bases to
[1:35:03] where he was feet god leads
[1:35:05] his dear children along some through the
[1:35:07] water some through the flood
[1:35:10] some through the fire but all through
[1:35:12] the blood
[1:35:13] some through great sorrow but god gives
[1:35:16] a song
[1:35:18] in the night season and all the day long
[1:35:21] god led me here
[1:35:25] he went on he said sometimes on the
[1:35:26] mount where the sun shines so bright god
[1:35:28] leads his dear children
[1:35:30] along sometimes in the valley the
[1:35:32] darkest of night
[1:35:34] god leads his dear children along those
[1:35:36] sorrows befall us and evils opposed
[1:35:40] god leads his dear children along
[1:35:41] through grace we can conquer
[1:35:43] defeat all our foes we believe that
[1:35:45] today
[1:35:46] god leads his dear children along and
[1:35:49] then he wrote this
[1:35:50] as the last verse he said away from the
[1:35:52] mire away from the clay
[1:35:54] god leads his dear children along
[1:35:57] leading us out of ourselves leading us
[1:35:59] out of this clay
[1:36:00] out of this meyers what he was doing to
[1:36:02] jacob
[1:36:03] god leads us their children along the
[1:36:05] way up in glory eternity stay
[1:36:08] god leads his dear children along
[1:36:12] you'll find brother branham quotes the
[1:36:14] chorus some through the waters some to
[1:36:16] the flood
[1:36:18] he quotes the course over and over again
[1:36:20] in the message
[1:36:21] and in 1956 he he's used it like this he
[1:36:25] said i'm so glad
[1:36:26] that god takes us through the wilderness
[1:36:28] journey
[1:36:29] there he can get us alone
[1:36:33] you see what i was saying when i'm
[1:36:34] talking about this this trial that we've
[1:36:36] had this government 19 this trial
[1:36:38] sometimes god has to get you alone
[1:36:42] there he can get us alone get out alone
[1:36:46] with god and in this wilderness
[1:36:49] experience
[1:36:49] isn't it strange he's speaking of how
[1:36:52] the children of israel were led
[1:36:53] right to the waters of mary led to
[1:36:55] bitter waters he said isn't it strange
[1:36:57] how god leads us into great tribulations
[1:37:00] and trials
[1:37:00] look how those israelites were led look
[1:37:03] at the waters of mara
[1:37:05] how the wilderness of sin and all the
[1:37:06] different places
[1:37:08] how the path of god leads he quotes the
[1:37:11] course some through the water
[1:37:12] some through the floods some through
[1:37:14] deep trials but all through the blood
[1:37:17] god leads his children strange peculiar
[1:37:19] ways
[1:37:21] but god works in mysterious ways his
[1:37:24] wonders to perform
[1:37:26] it has to be mysterious
[1:37:29] or he couldn't perform the wonder
[1:37:34] amen if he hadn't led him to an
[1:37:37] impossible situation at the red sea
[1:37:39] he couldn't have performed the wonder if
[1:37:42] he hadn't allowed him to come through
[1:37:43] the wilderness of sin and through the
[1:37:45] waters of mary the tree could have never
[1:37:46] been thrown in to sweeten the bitter
[1:37:48] waters
[1:37:51] he was leading him along and brother
[1:37:53] mark said it has to be mysterious or he
[1:37:55] couldn't perform the wonder and the path
[1:37:56] of our life is mysterious we don't
[1:37:58] understand it
[1:37:59] why are these things expressed in my
[1:38:01] life why did i have to go through this
[1:38:02] why did i do that god leads his dear
[1:38:06] children along
[1:38:08] he allows you to go through things to
[1:38:10] see what you'll do
[1:38:14] and he allows you to go through things
[1:38:15] to bring you to a place
[1:38:18] of repentance genesis 32 24 says jacob
[1:38:21] was left alone
[1:38:23] and a man wrestled with him until the
[1:38:25] breaking of the day
[1:38:27] when he saw that he prevailed not
[1:38:28] against him he touched the hall of his
[1:38:30] thigh
[1:38:31] the hollow of jacob's thigh was out of
[1:38:33] joint as he wrestled with him
[1:38:36] and he said let me go for the day
[1:38:38] breaketh
[1:38:40] he said i will not let thee go except
[1:38:42] thou bless me
[1:38:44] look at his desperation his
[1:38:45] determination
[1:38:47] and brother brandon picks it up in
[1:38:48] desperation and says you know a man can
[1:38:50] prevail over god
[1:38:53] a man can prevail over god he said here
[1:38:57] he said i will not let thee go he said
[1:39:00] except thou blessed me and he said unto
[1:39:02] him what is thy name
[1:39:04] what i what identity do you have
[1:39:07] he said jacob supplanter deceiver those
[1:39:10] are my genes
[1:39:12] that's who i am that's who my parents
[1:39:14] were
[1:39:15] that's who my grandparents were it runs
[1:39:18] in the family and it's
[1:39:19] i have the worst case of it in the whole
[1:39:22] family
[1:39:24] are you with me now i have the worst
[1:39:27] case of it in the whole family
[1:39:29] jacob what is your name
[1:39:32] jacob he said my name shall be called no
[1:39:35] more jacob
[1:39:36] but israel as a prince that has power
[1:39:40] with god
[1:39:41] and with men and has prevailed
[1:39:45] what did jacob overcome when he wrestled
[1:39:47] with the angel he overcome himself
[1:39:52] church you realize that's the power we
[1:39:56] have with god
[1:39:57] it's the power there's something in that
[1:39:59] seed that if we can ever get that that
[1:40:01] experience with god if we can ever get
[1:40:03] close to and get in that atmosphere like
[1:40:04] jacob was
[1:40:05] get along with god we can overcome
[1:40:07] ourself
[1:40:08] we don't have to be this way we're not
[1:40:10] confined to it we're not
[1:40:12] we're not predetermined to be just like
[1:40:14] our parents we're just like our
[1:40:15] grandparents were
[1:40:16] just like what everybody says we were or
[1:40:17] the way we were raised
[1:40:20] oh my but as a prince
[1:40:23] you prevailed with god god showed grace
[1:40:26] to jacob to come by his way
[1:40:28] and change his walk let's go back
[1:40:32] what made john worthy it wasn't
[1:40:36] the natural genes that he had in him
[1:40:38] what made him worthy to look who makes
[1:40:40] you worthy to look
[1:40:41] or me who is worthy to look and see
[1:40:46] what are you looking for you're looking
[1:40:48] to see your identity there you're
[1:40:49] looking to see your name
[1:40:50] you're looking to see your
[1:40:51] identification as an eagle
[1:40:56] you see something there that's me i
[1:40:58] can't belong to a system
[1:41:00] i can't belong to a denomination i don't
[1:41:02] belong out there i'm uncomfortable
[1:41:04] around the way the world acts in the way
[1:41:05] that they do i'm just not comfortable
[1:41:08] doing that
[1:41:09] you know we watch and we go places and
[1:41:11] enjoy some of the things they enjoy
[1:41:12] but we would never be comfortable
[1:41:14] sitting under those denominations why
[1:41:16] why is it because there's something
[1:41:18] inside of us something inside of us that
[1:41:20] have been awakened
[1:41:21] to a better gospel a better life
[1:41:25] we couldn't go back those that have went
[1:41:27] back there's just nothing inside of them
[1:41:29] that has been awakened yet
[1:41:32] we couldn't go back for anything
[1:41:35] why we're an eagle
[1:41:38] no one but the lamb was worthy but he's
[1:41:41] made us worthy
[1:41:44] amen you remember the story
[1:41:48] that jesus told in luke of how that he
[1:41:52] the master set a feast and he invited
[1:41:54] everyone to it
[1:41:55] each one made an excuse he says i bought
[1:41:59] a cow
[1:42:00] got to go look at it bought a field
[1:42:03] haven't haven't
[1:42:04] looked at it yet another one said i
[1:42:07] married a wife he didn't even give an
[1:42:08] explanation that was enough
[1:42:12] i married a wife
[1:42:16] all excuses excuses like noses
[1:42:18] everybody's got one
[1:42:22] they all had one and so the servant came
[1:42:24] back and was commissioned to go and
[1:42:25] invite them in
[1:42:27] showed his lord these things in luke 14
[1:42:29] 21 of the master of the house being
[1:42:30] angry
[1:42:30] said to his servants go out quickly into
[1:42:32] the streets and lanes of the city
[1:42:34] bring in the poor and the maimed and the
[1:42:35] halt and the blind
[1:42:37] and the servant said lord it has done as
[1:42:39] though it was commanded yet through his
[1:42:40] room
[1:42:41] and the lord said unto the servant go
[1:42:42] out in the highways and the hedges
[1:42:44] and compel them to come in that my house
[1:42:47] may be filled
[1:42:48] i say unto you that none of those men
[1:42:50] which were bidden shall taste of my
[1:42:52] supper
[1:42:54] brother brother said did you notice
[1:42:56] those three pulls that this is in
[1:42:57] is your life worthy of the gospel if you
[1:43:00] haven't listened to a tape lately go
[1:43:01] listen to that
[1:43:03] go listen to is your life worthy of the
[1:43:05] gospel it's an amazing thing
[1:43:07] is your life worthy of the gospel you'll
[1:43:10] find that brother branham doesn't place
[1:43:11] it just on us
[1:43:12] but the reason we don't live a worthy
[1:43:14] life is because we're not born again
[1:43:17] the reason we don't live a life worthy
[1:43:19] of the gospel he says because there's
[1:43:20] not been a change
[1:43:22] go listen to it is your life worthy of
[1:43:24] the gospel
[1:43:26] the brother brother says there was three
[1:43:28] polls or three terms of it
[1:43:31] he said when they went out first and
[1:43:32] called to them that were forbidden to
[1:43:34] come they didn't do it
[1:43:35] he said there went out a healing
[1:43:36] campaign went out to get the blind in
[1:43:38] the hall
[1:43:38] still there was room so we went out and
[1:43:41] compelled the good bad and indifferent
[1:43:43] that they should come in you know why
[1:43:46] because they would come
[1:43:50] you don't understand the willingness to
[1:43:52] come is is the
[1:43:53] biggest requirement the willingness to
[1:43:56] come
[1:43:57] but god because you're the elect chose
[1:44:00] you
[1:44:01] and so he caused you your grandfather to
[1:44:03] meet and your grandmother and all down
[1:44:05] through your line to bring you to a
[1:44:06] place where you would be willing to come
[1:44:11] and so here they were out in the hedges
[1:44:13] and how was they weren't
[1:44:14] expecting to get invited anywhere they
[1:44:17] were just sitting by the hedges
[1:44:18] maybe some of them drunks and
[1:44:20] prostitutes and everything else
[1:44:22] where does he go in the in the hedges
[1:44:24] and the highways and tell them come here
[1:44:25] come here he even had to lead them in
[1:44:27] had to grab them by the hand and show
[1:44:28] them where the house was
[1:44:30] they'd probably never been to a fancy
[1:44:32] dinner probably had to set them up and
[1:44:33] show them which fork to use
[1:44:35] had to show them how to eat the feast
[1:44:36] and everything else but what was it they
[1:44:38] were counted worthy
[1:44:39] because they were willing to come
[1:44:45] no but that was the third poll
[1:44:49] the third poll is what called them
[1:44:51] brother branham and recognizing today in
[1:44:52] this message
[1:44:53] he said don't begin to think that you've
[1:44:55] got the world council at your hand
[1:44:56] you've got the best dressed members of
[1:44:57] that
[1:44:58] god is able of alley rats out here to
[1:45:00] rise up children to fulfill
[1:45:02] his word prostitutes street walkers
[1:45:05] drunkards
[1:45:06] gamblers he is able to do it
[1:45:09] he is still god do we believe that today
[1:45:13] he's still god first corinthians 6 and 9
[1:45:17] paul says know you not that the
[1:45:18] unrighteous shall not inherit the
[1:45:20] kingdom of god
[1:45:21] be not deceived neither fornicators nor
[1:45:23] idolaters nor adulterers nor effeminate
[1:45:26] nor abusers of themselves with mankind
[1:45:28] it's all of the sexual
[1:45:30] sins and here the material says
[1:45:32] northeast nor covetous nor drunkards nor
[1:45:34] revilers nor extortioners
[1:45:36] shall inherit the kingdom of god
[1:45:40] where does that leave everybody it
[1:45:43] leaves us
[1:45:44] no one was found worthy he comes back i
[1:45:47] love this next verse and such
[1:45:49] were some of you
[1:45:54] some of you were effeminate i'm not
[1:45:58] saying
[1:45:58] some in this congregation you understand
[1:46:00] but some of those that were called
[1:46:02] some of those who were the elect during
[1:46:05] their lifetimes
[1:46:07] were effeminate or abusers of themselves
[1:46:09] with mankind or fornicators are
[1:46:11] idolaters or adulterers or thieves or
[1:46:14] covetous or drunkards
[1:46:16] or revilers or extortioners some of you
[1:46:20] but you're washed
[1:46:24] that's what we want to see it's not it's
[1:46:26] not that well
[1:46:27] my life if i was elected god would leave
[1:46:29] me a different path no
[1:46:31] but are you willing to be washed are you
[1:46:33] willing to stay
[1:46:34] and i found in my life and i think we'll
[1:46:36] find as we go on closer to the end that
[1:46:38] it's those who are nothing
[1:46:40] who are willing to stand and be washed
[1:46:42] and those who have material things who
[1:46:44] have something to hold on to
[1:46:45] something to grab onto some some pride
[1:46:47] some arrogance about themselves to think
[1:46:49] there's something
[1:46:50] those are the ones who hold back and
[1:46:51] will not willingly give themselves to
[1:46:53] god
[1:46:55] but those who are nothing are willing to
[1:46:56] lay themselves down at the altar
[1:46:58] and say i'm nothing i came from nothing
[1:47:00] i'm going to nothing
[1:47:01] i need god in my life the third poll
[1:47:05] went to those
[1:47:06] who were willing to come
[1:47:12] but you're washed you're sanctified but
[1:47:14] you're justified
[1:47:16] it's as though you never did it in the
[1:47:17] first place in the name of the lord
[1:47:19] jesus and by the spirit of our god
[1:47:24] jesus tells the story of the pharisee
[1:47:25] and the public and the pharisee
[1:47:27] is standing there and says telling god
[1:47:29] what he's done
[1:47:31] lord i'm a blessed man i've i've
[1:47:34] given ties of all that i possess
[1:47:37] i fast twice a week but he's got me beat
[1:47:40] there
[1:47:43] i've got all the i do everything right
[1:47:47] i'm able to come close to the holy of
[1:47:50] holies
[1:47:52] and the sinner the publican stands afar
[1:47:55] off
[1:47:56] way back i don't even think he's worthy
[1:48:01] to come in
[1:48:02] but he stands back there and he says
[1:48:04] smites himself on the breast he said
[1:48:06] lord have mercy on me
[1:48:09] a sinner jesus said who went just who
[1:48:12] went down justified
[1:48:15] he said the republican did
[1:48:20] first corinthians 1 26 he said for you
[1:48:21] see your calling brethren
[1:48:23] not many wise men after the flesh are
[1:48:24] called not many mighty not many noble
[1:48:26] are called
[1:48:27] we went through that in our teaching in
[1:48:29] corinthians and i'm hoping to be able to
[1:48:30] pick that up pretty soon
[1:48:32] and continue with that because it's such
[1:48:33] a marvelous thing that paul chose us
[1:48:36] he says not many mighty not many nobler
[1:48:38] called but god has chosen the foolish
[1:48:40] things of the world
[1:48:41] to confound the wise god has chosen the
[1:48:45] weak things of the world to confound the
[1:48:47] things which are mighty
[1:48:48] base things of the world things which
[1:48:50] are despised that god chosen yea
[1:48:52] things which are not to bring to not
[1:48:54] things that are
[1:48:55] and no flesh should glory in his
[1:48:57] presence
[1:48:58] we get there none of us are going to be
[1:49:00] able to say i did something to earn it
[1:49:08] he goes on to say but of him are you in
[1:49:10] christ jesus now now watch the wording
[1:49:12] of that but of him
[1:49:13] of who of god are you in christ jesus
[1:49:16] that's you're identified with christ
[1:49:18] you're his bride because god chose you
[1:49:20] to be
[1:49:21] of him are you in christ jesus who of
[1:49:24] god has made unto us
[1:49:25] wisdom he imputes to us he's made unto
[1:49:28] us wisdom
[1:49:28] unto us righteousness and sanctification
[1:49:30] and redemption
[1:49:32] that according as it is written he that
[1:49:34] glorious let him glory in the lord
[1:49:41] jesus had a dinner in matthew 9. i won't
[1:49:43] read it all and i've got them on there
[1:49:44] but we'll just skip past
[1:49:46] matthew 9 10 through 13. you go read it
[1:49:49] he call all the pharisees or republicans
[1:49:51] and sinners come and sit with him to eat
[1:49:52] and the pharisees got onto him for it
[1:49:54] and he said
[1:49:56] they that behold need not a physician
[1:49:58] but they that are sick
[1:50:01] but go and learn what that means i will
[1:50:03] have mercy and not sacrifice
[1:50:06] i am not come to call the righteous but
[1:50:09] sinners to repentance
[1:50:13] he didn't come i love the way jesus
[1:50:16] as he followed the leadership of the
[1:50:18] father you remember
[1:50:21] it was nicodemus who came to jesus by
[1:50:23] night
[1:50:25] the rich young ruler came to jesus
[1:50:28] right but jesus said i must need to go
[1:50:31] by samaria
[1:50:35] you ever thought about that they come to
[1:50:37] him
[1:50:38] the wealthy and and and the learned come
[1:50:40] to him and said you must be a prophet we
[1:50:42] know you're a man of god
[1:50:44] or you couldn't do these things but they
[1:50:45] were afraid to make a commitment
[1:50:47] and the rich man even went away
[1:50:48] sorrowful the rich young ruler
[1:50:51] but he come to a well where there was a
[1:50:54] woman
[1:50:56] who was so messed up that on the outside
[1:50:58] was just as black as could be but
[1:50:59] brother brown told us she had
[1:51:00] representation
[1:51:02] there was something on the inside he
[1:51:04] could that could connect with it
[1:51:07] not nicodemus or even gamaliel who was a
[1:51:10] great teacher and even
[1:51:11] friendly to the christians but the woman
[1:51:13] at the well
[1:51:15] not simon pharisee but the woman of ill
[1:51:18] fame
[1:51:21] not caiaphas but the thief on the cross
[1:51:24] are you beginning to see a pattern
[1:51:28] no something interesting about this is
[1:51:30] it's the woman at the well it's the
[1:51:32] woman
[1:51:32] of hill fame and in one scripture if
[1:51:35] it's the same instance it calls her mary
[1:51:36] but
[1:51:37] then we know caiaphas name but not the
[1:51:40] thief on the cross
[1:51:41] we know simon pharisee's name but not
[1:51:43] the woman that washed his feet
[1:51:46] we know naked nicodemus's name but not
[1:51:48] the woman at the well
[1:51:52] but he knew their name
[1:51:56] hallelujah he knows their name
[1:52:00] so they don't go by name in the
[1:52:02] scripture but he knew exactly who they
[1:52:04] were
[1:52:05] amen had a privilege many years ago
[1:52:09] i say many years ago it's all relative
[1:52:11] to how old you are
[1:52:14] but a few years ago and forgive me for
[1:52:17] as paul said my folly in mentioning this
[1:52:19] because it
[1:52:20] it's a touchstone for me in my life when
[1:52:22] i pastored at bransville
[1:52:24] i was pastored to a little lady by the
[1:52:26] name of may brown
[1:52:29] and it was a simple farm wife who lived
[1:52:31] near gerst springs area in alton
[1:52:33] missouri and then she moved to west
[1:52:35] plains at some point in her life and
[1:52:36] her husband had died fairly young and
[1:52:39] and she lived many more years and
[1:52:41] i was her pastor for about five years
[1:52:44] had a small house in west plains i
[1:52:47] remember going in the floors weren't
[1:52:48] weren't level and
[1:52:49] it was just old and because she was
[1:52:51] there by herself for so many years
[1:52:54] and after many many years she got put in
[1:52:56] the nursing home and
[1:52:58] and when she got put in the nursing home
[1:53:00] i thought well she's just not going to
[1:53:01] make it because she was independent and
[1:53:02] liked to do things and
[1:53:03] she got in the nursing home she
[1:53:05] flourished she was just that kind of a
[1:53:07] person she loved being around people and
[1:53:09] telling them about the lord and things
[1:53:10] and fellowship with people she was just
[1:53:12] a saint of god but
[1:53:14] she was a simple woman and she attended
[1:53:16] faithfully at bransville but
[1:53:18] you know sometimes we get arrogant about
[1:53:20] things
[1:53:22] and not her but me i remember preaching
[1:53:26] one time and
[1:53:27] i was preaching on something like this
[1:53:29] morning on the seals
[1:53:32] and this these things were opening up to
[1:53:33] me as a young man and i was preaching
[1:53:35] these things and
[1:53:36] and and as i was preaching these things
[1:53:38] i looked over and sister brown was
[1:53:40] sitting there with her head
[1:53:41] like this and looked like she wasn't
[1:53:43] listening
[1:53:44] it looked like she was asleep as far as
[1:53:46] i could tell but she would sit that way
[1:53:47] sometimes in church
[1:53:48] and i thought she was asleep she was at
[1:53:50] that time probably 95
[1:53:53] something like that and she's sitting in
[1:53:56] church
[1:53:58] seemingly asleep and i remember thinking
[1:54:00] while i'm preaching she's not getting
[1:54:02] any of this
[1:54:03] you know when you've got just a few
[1:54:04] people you you get to know them
[1:54:06] and you get to know how their
[1:54:07] expressions and how they respond i
[1:54:08] thought she's not getting anything out
[1:54:10] of this
[1:54:11] and after the service so i walk i'll
[1:54:14] never forget walking out
[1:54:15] but jt had brought her and he'd already
[1:54:17] gotten in the van and she's standing out
[1:54:19] there waiting on me she's excited
[1:54:20] she said brother ben she said i want you
[1:54:22] to know that sermon was for me
[1:54:27] she said she said there's something
[1:54:30] about those seals
[1:54:33] and i knew she'd been saved back in
[1:54:34] pentecost and and
[1:54:36] and the story was that when she went to
[1:54:39] years ago she had been in brother
[1:54:40] bennett's meetings and if you go to a
[1:54:42] message called future home of the
[1:54:43] heavenly bridegroom in the earthly bride
[1:54:45] i got the quote so you could see it and
[1:54:48] brother man says ladies sitting there
[1:54:49] looking at me right on the end of the
[1:54:50] seat she got sinus trouble she'll
[1:54:52] believe it
[1:54:52] god will heal her he said mrs brown
[1:54:54] believe with all your heart
[1:54:56] jesus christ will make he said you're a
[1:54:58] stranger to me
[1:55:00] but he knows you
[1:55:03] and we got thinking about these women
[1:55:04] that we don't know their names but
[1:55:06] but jesus knew who they were they were
[1:55:10] in the book
[1:55:11] and the pharisees whose names we knew
[1:55:12] they're not in the book but here's a
[1:55:14] woman
[1:55:14] whose name we didn't know she was in the
[1:55:17] book and
[1:55:18] and and he says you're a stranger to me
[1:55:20] but he knows you
[1:55:22] he said you believe it raise up your
[1:55:23] hand and she was healed of her sinus
[1:55:26] problems
[1:55:27] she went there with someone else and
[1:55:28] praying for someone else to receive a
[1:55:30] greater healing but she got what she
[1:55:32] needed that night
[1:55:33] and her testimony was she never had
[1:55:35] problems a problem with that
[1:55:36] specific thing again and ag and i
[1:55:39] remember
[1:55:40] preaching about the seals and thinking
[1:55:41] she's just not getting it she i thought
[1:55:43] well she's probably
[1:55:44] that pentecostal age you know she
[1:55:46] probably don't mean anything to her
[1:55:48] but she says brother ben that's that
[1:55:50] sermon was for me she said
[1:55:52] i've been listening to those seals
[1:55:53] you've been talking about i know there's
[1:55:54] something there
[1:55:56] for me something i need to know you know
[1:56:00] what i believe
[1:56:01] i believe she looked in
[1:56:05] i believe god led a 95 year old simple
[1:56:07] woman who as far as i know never had a
[1:56:09] driver's license
[1:56:10] never never was a big name person other
[1:56:12] than god spoke her name on tape
[1:56:15] through a prophet you understand but but
[1:56:17] she was never a
[1:56:19] you're just a simple woman she never
[1:56:20] tried to travel on it and tried to
[1:56:22] go out and say what an important person
[1:56:24] she was but she was just a person who
[1:56:26] believed in the mercy of god
[1:56:27] but she looked in and god showed her
[1:56:30] then he took her home
[1:56:33] oh church if you could just realize he
[1:56:35] wants to show you today
[1:56:37] he wants to show he doesn't matter how
[1:56:38] simple the simpler the better
[1:56:40] he wants you to see it's me
[1:56:44] i can't be lost i'm a child of god how
[1:56:47] could i be lost
[1:56:49] this is where i belong no matter what
[1:56:51] i've done no matter what's going on in
[1:56:53] my life
[1:56:53] this is who i am i can see
[1:56:57] my name in the book you can see my
[1:57:00] identification
[1:57:05] musicians go ahead and come i'm never
[1:57:07] going to quit if they don't
[1:57:13] brother branham talks in the sardisian
[1:57:17] church age and
[1:57:18] he's talking about revelations 3 4 where
[1:57:20] it says dies a few names even in sardis
[1:57:23] which have not defiled their garments
[1:57:26] they shall walk with me in light for
[1:57:28] they are worthy he said a few names
[1:57:31] not many he said that age wasn't what
[1:57:34] everybody thought it was this great
[1:57:36] outbreak of the
[1:57:37] protestant church there were just a few
[1:57:39] a few
[1:57:41] lutheran messenger and a few others
[1:57:44] thousand few names even in sardis
[1:57:46] which have not defiled their garments
[1:57:48] and they shall walk with me
[1:57:50] in white for they are worthy
[1:57:54] brother brother says do you realize who
[1:57:56] is saying this it is jesus the worthy
[1:57:58] one
[1:57:59] himself amen
[1:58:03] this is the only one who has accounted
[1:58:05] worthy to take the book out of the hand
[1:58:06] of him who sits on the throne and now
[1:58:09] this worthy one is saying to his saints
[1:58:11] you
[1:58:11] are worthy amen
[1:58:15] amen you are worthy here is this one
[1:58:18] he said the only one qualified to judge
[1:58:20] he said and indeed all judgment is
[1:58:22] committed unto him and he says
[1:58:24] you are worthy he said these words are
[1:58:27] as astounding as are the words in romans
[1:58:29] 8 33 be
[1:58:31] it's the last part of the verse he said
[1:58:32] god says i am righteous
[1:58:36] that's where paul says who shall lay
[1:58:37] anything in charge of god's elect it is
[1:58:39] god who justifies
[1:58:42] god says i'm righteous they're in the
[1:58:46] white light of god's righteousness hear
[1:58:48] the sweet voice of jesus
[1:58:49] as he says these are mine they are
[1:58:52] righteous they are worthy
[1:58:54] they shall walk with me in white
[1:58:58] brother said he doesn't put on a
[1:58:59] different colored rope than they have on
[1:59:02] but a white robe the same color
[1:59:06] as those who walk with me they will walk
[1:59:07] with me and white
[1:59:11] listen verse 5 says he that overcometh
[1:59:13] that's the key
[1:59:15] he that overcometh every one of us has
[1:59:17] to overcome
[1:59:18] we've got to overcome this every one of
[1:59:21] us has got overcome we say when do you
[1:59:22] stop overcoming
[1:59:23] when you're gone when you're leaving the
[1:59:25] rapture or when you when your body is
[1:59:27] changed or when you
[1:59:28] when you go by way of the grave that's
[1:59:30] when you have to you get to stop
[1:59:31] overcoming but until then you have to
[1:59:33] overcome
[1:59:33] every day paul said i keep running my
[1:59:37] body bringing under subjection yes i'm
[1:59:38] saved yes i'm
[1:59:39] i've been redeemed but i want to be
[1:59:41] worthy how can i be worthy
[1:59:43] he give me the power to overcome he
[1:59:45] makes me worthy by his blood
[1:59:48] these were counted worthy because there
[1:59:51] was the few
[1:59:52] that kept his name he said he that
[1:59:54] overcometh the same shall be clothed in
[1:59:56] white raiment i will not blot out his
[2:00:11] of god speak the name
[2:00:14] amen
[2:00:20] i think the bride has a part in that i
[2:00:22] don't understand all that but somehow
[2:00:24] bride has a part and all of this that
[2:00:26] voice speaks the name
[2:00:29] amen amen you'll speak
[2:00:32] and those that you're those that you
[2:00:34] have died and you knew the ones that you
[2:00:36] knew all of a sudden will start coming
[2:00:39] god speaks the voices in the bride
[2:00:43] you want to quote for but the brown says
[2:00:45] that the voice is in the bride
[2:00:46] and they speak the name and when they
[2:00:48] speak suddenly
[2:00:50] things start materializing
[2:00:55] amen god knows who they are everyone
[2:00:58] that's down to the ages that have been
[2:01:00] went by the way of the grave that
[2:01:01] created voice begins to speak and as he
[2:01:04] speaks
[2:01:05] they raise from the dead they come back
[2:01:08] out of that other
[2:01:09] dimension where they are and they come
[2:01:10] back and they begin to appear
[2:01:13] we're gathered together with them to
[2:01:14] meet our lord in the air they're worthy
[2:01:17] they'll walk with him in white he said i
[2:01:20] will confess his name before my father
[2:01:23] and before his angels the first
[2:01:25] resurrection led at the second
[2:01:26] resurrection
[2:01:27] confessed the name of those who stood
[2:01:29] for the bride
[2:01:31] those who went through the tribulation
[2:01:32] period confess his name before my father
[2:01:35] and before his angels what happened
[2:01:37] when john looked he worshipped
[2:01:45] what else could you do
[2:01:49] what else could you do you can't defend
[2:01:52] yourself
[2:01:53] you can't be a better person and say
[2:01:54] well i'll do this and i'll i'll go
[2:01:56] through these steps no
[2:01:57] worshipped
[2:02:00] brother brown kind of doesn't play on
[2:02:02] words he said everything under the
[2:02:03] heaven and the earth and everything else
[2:02:04] said
[2:02:05] heard i say john he said was shouting up
