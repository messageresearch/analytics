[55:28] today.
[55:29] We thank you for being our friend, our
[55:32] help in time [music] of trouble, a very
[55:35] present help in time of trouble. Thank
[55:39] you for that today, Lord [music] Jesus.
[55:42] Lord, I need you this morning more than
[55:44] any at any other time. These people need
[55:48] you, Lord. And so we come, we approach
[55:50] boldly [music]
[55:51] the throne of grace, believing, Lord,
[55:54] that there is a sacrifice made for us,
[55:56] an atonement for sin. Lord, I pray we
[55:59] would each one be covered by the blood.
[56:02] Lord, if we've committed any sin or done
[56:04] anything that would be wrong, I pray you
[56:06] would cover us this morning. How we each
[56:09] one [music] need you, Lord. We stand in
[56:11] need every day, every hour, Lord.
[56:15] Lord, we pray that that chain that your
[56:17] prophet talked about of the word of God
[56:18] would be so strong in our lives, only as
[56:21] strong as its weakest link. May there be
[56:23] no weak links, Lord, in our lives. May
[56:25] we may we believe your word, have
[56:28] confidence [music] in it. Pray that
[56:30] you'd grant it today. We thank you for
[56:31] all that you've done. Pray that you'd
[56:33] help our Lord, those that are out. I
[56:36] think of our elders this morning, Sister
[56:38] Betty [music] and Sister Cletus
[56:39] especially this morning. I pray you'd
[56:41] reach down and help them. Lord, there's
[56:43] nothing we can do, but Lord, I know
[56:46] you're a God who can do all things.
[56:48] [music]
[56:48] Pray you'd granted today. Thank you for
[56:51] your word. Thank you for your goodness
[56:52] to us. We ask all these things in Jesus
[56:55] name.
[56:57] Amen.
[56:58] Amen. [music] Thank the Lord. Romans
[57:01] chapter 8 and verse 18. Romans chapter 8
[57:04] 18 and 19. Want to mention to you while
[57:06] you're turning there this morning that
[57:09] tonight's service will be focused to the
[57:10] youth, but you're all welcome to come.
[57:13] We want you to come, but it'll be
[57:15] focused on that. Brother Joel will be
[57:16] preaching tonight. Uh, brother uh Joe
[57:19] Adams is going to be here next week.
[57:22] It's been several years since he's been
[57:23] here. So, I know you're looking forward
[57:25] to hearing brother Joe again, and he'll
[57:28] be here with us. And I I won't be here.
[57:30] I'll be in Arizona. Um going out there
[57:32] to a meeting at brother Israel Pose and
[57:35] and then going to be preaching a couple
[57:37] times out there. So you keep me and
[57:38] Britney in your prayers. The kids are
[57:40] going to stay here and this is what
[57:41] we're going to attempt to do is to go
[57:43] and be gone for about a week or a little
[57:45] longer and leave the children here. And
[57:48] so u we we'll try to do that not have to
[57:51] take an early flight back. We're not
[57:52] used to being separated from our
[57:54] children. So but we're getting older,
[57:56] you know, and and they can take care of
[57:58] themselves now. So you'll be praying for
[58:00] my wife especially that we'll be able to
[58:03] do that and also we have to get on an
[58:04] airplane so you all know about that and
[58:07] uh so be praying for us but I know
[58:09] you'll enjoy brother Joe coming in and
[58:12] that'll be a real blessing to the church
[58:14] and uh so we'll we'll be uh doing that.
[58:17] Romans chapter 8 and verse 18. Do you
[58:19] love the Lord this morning?
[58:22] For I reckon that the sufferings of this
[58:24] present time are not worthy to be
[58:27] compared with the glory which shall be
[58:30] revealed in us. For the earnest
[58:34] expectation of the creature or the
[58:36] creation
[58:38] waiteth for the manifestation
[58:41] of the sons of God. So we can say it
[58:43] like this. the the the earth is waiting,
[58:46] holding its breath, waiting for the sons
[58:50] of God to be manifested. I pray the Lord
[58:52] would add his blessing to the word. You
[58:54] may be seated this morning as we've uh
[58:56] been dealing at some length with
[58:59] adoption and manifestation of sons. And
[59:02] we're going to continue on that
[59:03] manifestation of sons this morning. We
[59:06] know when Jesus was born in flesh that
[59:10] he was the perfect manifested son of God
[59:14] that being born here in the earth that
[59:17] uh if we wanted to know what a
[59:19] manifested son looked like then we need
[59:21] to look at Christ and we need to be like
[59:23] Christ and that is what we're talking
[59:25] about. It just kind of makes it a little
[59:27] bit simpler if you think about it that
[59:29] way. We're just talking about being like
[59:32] Jesus. We're supposed to use him as our
[59:34] example and not just as our example but
[59:37] also to let his spirit come in us so
[59:39] that we can become like him, walk like
[59:41] him, talk like him, be like him.
[59:45] And we know when Jesus was born that he
[59:47] was God in flesh. How many know that
[59:49] today?
[59:50] &gt;&gt; When Jesus was born, he was Jehovah in a
[59:52] manger. Brother Brandham said it was
[59:54] little Jehovah crying over in a manger.
[59:57] It was little Jehovah uh the nursing at
[1:00:00] his mother's breast. It was little
[1:00:01] Jehovah that that was the one who was
[1:00:04] there and he was actually a baby and and
[1:00:08] yet he was God. He was all the God he
[1:00:11] would ever be at that moment. He he was
[1:00:14] God's DNA. And even Brandham said the
[1:00:17] blood cell and the egg were both created
[1:00:20] in the womb of Mary. He was the very
[1:00:22] creation of God and and he was born into
[1:00:25] the world. And yet when he come into the
[1:00:28] world, he did not come into the world
[1:00:31] speaking thus sayeth the Lord.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; Right? We just don't expect that, do we?
[1:00:36] And that sounds kind of ludicrous, but
[1:00:38] but he wasn't born a full-g grown man.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; And so he was the word, but he couldn't
[1:00:44] speak.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; Right. He was the word, but he couldn't
[1:00:47] he couldn't uh he couldn't heal the
[1:00:50] people.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; His little hands wrapped around his
[1:00:52] mother's finger. Right. a and and
[1:00:55] grabbed a hold of his mother's finger,
[1:00:56] but his touch did not heal the people.
[1:00:59] There's no record of it as a even as a a
[1:01:02] child or a young man. And yet he was
[1:01:04] God. Are you with me so far? The same is
[1:01:07] true of us when we're born again into
[1:01:09] the kingdom of God. We are as much we
[1:01:12] have all the potentials of the
[1:01:14] resurrection. We have everything in us
[1:01:16] that will ever be. We we whatever God is
[1:01:19] going to do for you, he's already put in
[1:01:22] you when you're born again. Right? that
[1:01:24] seed. In fact, before your new birth,
[1:01:26] before you even come to an understanding
[1:01:28] of it, a knowledge of it, YOU ALREADY
[1:01:30] CHOSEN BY GOD, ELECTED by God to be what
[1:01:32] YOU'RE GOING TO BE. HOW MANY CAN TAKE
[1:01:34] COMFORT IN that today? A and God doesn't
[1:01:37] miss. He doesn't make a mistake. HE
[1:01:39] DOESN'T HE DOESN'T MESS UP HIS PROGRAM.
[1:01:41] WHATEVER YOU'RE GOING TO BE IS WHAT
[1:01:43] YOU'RE GOING TO BE.
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; But yet, when you come into the world or
[1:01:47] you come into THE CHURCH, YOU DON'T
[1:01:49] START speaking all at once. And and so
[1:01:52] many people get discouraged cuz they're
[1:01:53] like, "Well, I'm not like brother so AND
[1:01:54] SO. I'M NOT LIKE SISTER SO AND SO." WE
[1:01:57] DON'T EXPECT YOU TO BE. YOU COME IN AS A
[1:01:59] BABY. You're born as a baby. LET THE
[1:02:01] YOUNG PEOPLE BE YOUNG PEOPLE. LET THOSE
[1:02:03] WHO COME IN OFF THE STREET COME IN AND
[1:02:05] HAVE A REAL EXPERIENCE WITH GOD. LET
[1:02:07] THEM BE BABIES, BUT you know, BABIES
[1:02:09] HAVE TO GROW UP. SO, LET US AS ELDERS,
[1:02:11] LET US GROW UP INTO THE FULL
[1:02:13] MANIFESTATION OF THE WORD of God.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:02:19] Uh, excuse me this morning. Sometimes we
[1:02:22] pick a fight or or or get upset at
[1:02:24] younger people for having wrong ideas or
[1:02:27] we we get upset at new people for living
[1:02:29] in ways maybe that we wouldn't live. But
[1:02:32] let's let's us AS ELDERS, LET'S LET'S be
[1:02:34] the example of that. Let's do LET'S BE
[1:02:37] MORE THAN JUST SOMEBODY WHO CAN SEE
[1:02:39] SOMEBODY ELSE'S FAULTS, BUT LET'S BE
[1:02:41] SOMEBODY WHO'S GROWN UP INTO A MATURE
[1:02:43] CHRISTIAN that can preach the word of
[1:02:45] God. You say, "Well, I'm not a
[1:02:47] preacher." Will you preach with your
[1:02:48] life?
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; PREACH WITH YOUR LIFE. PREACH WITH THE
[1:02:51] WAY YOU LIVE EVERY DAY.
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; AMEN. That's what I want to do. Jesus
[1:02:56] was born God in flesh. He was that part
[1:02:59] of God called the son of God. Fully a
[1:03:02] son of God. Emmanuel, God with us. Even
[1:03:06] at 12 years old, he was the word
[1:03:08] correcting the error in the temple.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; We know he had to be tempted and he had
[1:03:13] to be tested and he had to learn. And
[1:03:16] that's hard for us to understand because
[1:03:18] obviously God knows all things and Jesus
[1:03:21] had access to that knowledge. But he had
[1:03:24] to learn how to surrender himself
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; to the father that lived within him.
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; How how do we know that? BECAUSE HE
[1:03:31] SAID, "NOT MY WILL, but thine be done."
[1:03:34] HE HAD TO LEARN HOW TO DEPEND ON THE
[1:03:36] WORD. HOW DID JESUS GO INTO A GRAVE and
[1:03:39] believe that he would come up again?
[1:03:40] Because he believed the scripture that
[1:03:42] SAID, "I WILL NOT SUFFER MY HOLY ONE TO
[1:03:44] SEE CORRUPTION. OH, NOT LEAVE YOUR SOUL
[1:03:46] IN HELL. SO IF HE believed that, he had
[1:03:48] to learn to believe that. CAN I SAY IT
[1:03:50] THAT WAY? HE HAD TO REACH A PLACE IN HIS
[1:03:52] LIFE THAT THAT HE COULD HAVE FULL
[1:03:54] CONFIDENCE IN THAT. YOU SAY, WELL, he
[1:03:56] just always knew those things that not
[1:03:58] according TO THE SCRIPTURE. THE BIBLE
[1:04:00] SAYS, THOUGH HE WERE a son, come on,
[1:04:02] sir.
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; Again, AS MUCH SON HE WOULD EVER BE
[1:04:05] FULLY a son, HAVING ALL THE POTENTIALS
[1:04:08] HE WOULD EVER HAVE, yet learned he
[1:04:10] obedience
[1:04:12] by the things which he suffered.
[1:04:15] He learned to be obedient to the word to
[1:04:18] the oh God TO TO THE MANIFESTATION OF
[1:04:22] GOD IN HIM.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; And he Oh, that's why we still NEED TO
[1:04:26] PRAY.
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; WE STILL NEED to surrender ourselves. WE
[1:04:29] STILL NEED TO REACH OUT. WE STILL NEED
[1:04:31] TO PRESS. WE STILL NEED TO DO EVERYTHING
[1:04:33] WE CAN FOR THE KINGDOM OF GOD. YES,
[1:04:35] WE'RE ELECTED. YES, WE'RE CALLED. YES,
[1:04:37] WE'RE THE PREDESTINED CHILDREN OF GOD.
[1:04:39] BUT WE STILL NEED COME ON, CHURCH. WE
[1:04:41] STILL NEED REVIVAL. WE STILL NEED GOD TO
[1:04:43] MOVE IN OUR MIDST. WE STILL NEED THE
[1:04:45] PRESENCE OF GOD TO COME DOWN ON US. WHY?
[1:04:47] WE ARE SONS. BUT WE LEARN OBEDIENCE IN
[1:04:50] LIFE.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; HE BECAME THE AUTHOR. HE BECAME THE
[1:04:56] author
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; of [snorts] eternal salvation unto all
[1:04:59] them that obey him. He did not take a
[1:05:02] shortcut
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; to the throne,
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; but he took the way that God called him
[1:05:08] to be. Many people confuse activity for
[1:05:11] the leadership of the Lord. We want
[1:05:13] activity. We want to press. We want to
[1:05:15] do make sure that there's something in
[1:05:18] there to give out.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; Before you go. Now look, he he's made
[1:05:24] perfect and become the author of eternal
[1:05:25] salvation. Brother Brandham said
[1:05:26] shortcuts. He said tonight they're out
[1:05:29] here today. They're going on. Oh my.
[1:05:31] Tomorrow they want to preach.
[1:05:33] Pentecostal people letting them do that.
[1:05:34] I just say upfront. I'm not talking
[1:05:36] about any preacher this morning. I want
[1:05:38] us all to to fellowship with this and
[1:05:40] and understand this. These ministers
[1:05:43] here have have a lot of experience and
[1:05:45] and uh and and a lot of of uh I believe
[1:05:49] they're not noviceses at all. The
[1:05:51] brothers we have in the church, aren't
[1:05:52] you glad for that? And brothers we have
[1:05:54] stand behind the pulpit. So, I'm not
[1:05:56] pointing this to them at all. But he
[1:05:58] talked about preachers how the
[1:05:59] Pentecostals would bring someone off the
[1:06:01] street, make them a preacher the next
[1:06:03] day. He said tomorrow today he said go
[1:06:06] they're going on mine tomorrow they want
[1:06:08] to preach. He said Pentecostal people
[1:06:10] letting them do that too. They want a
[1:06:12] shortcut to heaven. Hallelujah. All they
[1:06:14] have to do is go down there and just
[1:06:15] don't think nothing at all and say
[1:06:17] hallelujah. I I got on Elijah's garment.
[1:06:19] I'm going out tomorrow to cast out
[1:06:21] devils. Come on. You you guys see it all
[1:06:24] over Instagram and all over Facebook and
[1:06:26] all over social media today. Everybody's
[1:06:29] a prophet and everybody's casting out
[1:06:30] devils and everybody's doing all this
[1:06:32] stuff and they don't have THE LIFE TO
[1:06:34] MATCH UP WITH THAT.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon believed in shouting. He
[1:06:37] said he believed in jumping. He said,
[1:06:39] "BUT DON'T JUMP NO HIGHER than you can
[1:06:40] live."
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; So he said THEY WANT THE SHORTCUT TO
[1:06:44] HEAVEN. He said taking as much of the
[1:06:47] world as they can take. You can't take
[1:06:50] any of it. Is that right, Jonah? You
[1:06:52] can't take any of the world. Amen. AMEN.
[1:06:55] THERE'S NO SHORTCUTS. YOU COME THE WAY
[1:06:57] OF CALVARY. YOU COME THE WAY OF THE
[1:06:59] BRASS ALTAR. AMEN. You come the way of
[1:07:01] the brazen serpent. He said you die. You
[1:07:04] actually die. You die. You literally die
[1:07:07] to yourselves. How many believe THAT
[1:07:09] TODAY? YOU DIE TO THE THINGS OF THE
[1:07:11] WORLD AND ARE BORN A NEW. AMEN. NO
[1:07:13] WORLD. The things of the world is dead.
[1:07:16] There's no shortcuts. HE SAID THEY WANT
[1:07:18] TO COME RIGHT QUICK. THEY DON'T WANT TO
[1:07:19] GROW. BUT HE said we grow in the Lord.
[1:07:22] It takes growth and experience. Somebody
[1:07:24] say that with me this morning. growth
[1:07:26] and experience.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; People are told out on the West Coast
[1:07:30] now, he said, "Oh, we got the immortal
[1:07:32] baptism." Brother Brandham was seeing
[1:07:33] the beginnings of that, the charismatic
[1:07:36] movement,
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; Pentecostal babies. [snorts]
[1:07:41] We got a Pentecostal baby here in the
[1:07:43] church.
[1:07:45] But brother seen the beginning of that
[1:07:47] and says, "We baptized you in water. You
[1:07:49] turned right back to a young man right
[1:07:51] there, a young woman said they got
[1:07:53] Elijah's garments. They got manifested
[1:07:54] sons of God.
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; Now, we believe in manifested sons.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; Right? We believe in sons of God being
[1:08:00] manifested, but not overnight.
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; And here's this is the key.
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; NOT OVERNIGHT. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT
[1:08:06] HAPPENS YOUR ENTIRE LIFE. WHEN WILL THE
[1:08:08] SONS OF GOD BE FULLY MANIFESTED? IN the
[1:08:11] millennium when we have the character
[1:08:12] for it.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; I BELIEVE THERE ARE SOME SONS THAT CAN
[1:08:15] COME TO THAT. THEY SAY, "CUZ WE SAW ONE
[1:08:17] THAT DID THAT. GOD SHOWED US A PROPHET
[1:08:19] AND COME TO SUCH A MATURITY IN HIS LIFE
[1:08:21] THAT HE COULD SPEAK AND AND THINGS WOULD
[1:08:23] HAPPEN. BUT HE SAID, "I DON'T JUST DO
[1:08:25] THAT ON MY OWN." HE HAD THE MATURITY TO
[1:08:27] WAIT UNTIL GOD TOLD HIM TO DO IT.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; SO, it's the manifestation of sons. BUT
[1:08:34] IT'S NOT TONIGHT you're a sinner,
[1:08:35] tomorrow you're manifested sons of God.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; He said nonsense. Where you get that in
[1:08:39] the word? Babies are not born men.
[1:08:41] They're born babies and grow to men.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; Right? baby can put on a tie and wear
[1:08:49] dress clothes and they're still not a
[1:08:52] man.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; And but listen, when it's a baby doing
[1:08:59] that, there's no shame in that.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; Are you with pal? You say, "Well,
[1:09:03] they're not, you know, they're just
[1:09:05] they're just kind of pretending to be a
[1:09:06] Christian, just coming to church and
[1:09:08] they're not really doing everything they
[1:09:09] should be doing." Well, you did two at
[1:09:11] one time.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; You kind of come and assimilated
[1:09:14] yourself, too. A and you didn't always
[1:09:17] have every work of grace in your life
[1:09:19] and YOU HAD TO STOP START AT THE BOTTOM
[1:09:21] OF THE PYRAMID LIKE EVERYBODY else did.
[1:09:23] BUT THANK GOD IF YOU'VE REACHED THE TOP,
[1:09:26] if you're up there with brotherly
[1:09:27] KINDNESS AND LOVE, YOU CAN REACH BACK
[1:09:29] DOWN TO SOMEBODY A LITTLE LOWER AND SAY,
[1:09:31] "COME ON UP WITH ME. I'LL HELP YOU WALK.
[1:09:33] I'LL HELP YOU MOVE UP FARTHER."
[1:09:37] So the Bible says that after teaching
[1:09:40] the rabbis in the temple and Jesus did
[1:09:42] that at 12 years old, HE HAD SO MUCH
[1:09:45] KNOWLEDGE OF GOD AND HE HAD SO MUCH
[1:09:47] UNDERSTANDING AND THE SPIRIT OF GOD
[1:09:49] moving him in him. He he was God
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; and he was preaching AT 12 YEARS OLD,
[1:09:54] PREACHING to the to the to the Pharisees
[1:09:57] and the rabbis in the temple. And then
[1:09:59] in Luke 2:52, it tells us after the his
[1:10:03] parents come and got him, he subjected
[1:10:04] himself to them.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; And after he had already corrected the
[1:10:08] error in their lives, Jesus increased in
[1:10:12] wisdom and stature and in favor with God
[1:10:17] and man.
[1:10:18] Now I want you to understand he was
[1:10:20] deity walking,
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; right? But he increased.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; So how did he increase? He did not add
[1:10:28] from the outside.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; A lot of people misunderstand the
[1:10:32] stature of a perfect man. It's not
[1:10:34] adding something from the outside.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; Very good.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; It's growing in what's on the inside.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; Right. And so you HAVE TO HAVE SOMETHING
[1:10:42] ON the inside. Brother Brandon taught
[1:10:44] us, we talked about, I think last week
[1:10:46] or the week before, you got to have that
[1:10:47] foundation of faith or you can't get
[1:10:50] started. And so YOU GOT TO BELIEVE GOD
[1:10:53] FIRST. How many believe God this
[1:10:54] morning?
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; Got to believe that he is. and he's a
[1:10:57] rewarder of those that diligently se
[1:10:59] serve him, seek him, and yet you you've
[1:11:02] got to increase. So Jesus increased. He
[1:11:04] was deity and and you got to start at
[1:11:08] the bottom. But he increased in wisdom
[1:11:10] and stature. So he was increasing into
[1:11:13] the stature of the perfect man and in
[1:11:17] favor with God and man.
[1:11:22] church, you don't understand like like
[1:11:24] he WAS DOING WHAT GOD WANTED HIM to do.
[1:11:28] It's not that. See, when you're born
[1:11:29] again, God loves you. You're in FAVOR
[1:11:31] WITH GOD. YOU'RE ACCEPTED IN THE BELOVED
[1:11:33] AS WE TALKED ABOUT WEDNESDAY NIGHT. YOU
[1:11:35] YOU LISTEN, you don't have to worry
[1:11:37] about God loving you. Jesus didn't have
[1:11:39] to worry about the father loving him.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; RIGHT. GOD LOVED HIM. YET, he increased
[1:11:44] IN FAVOR WITH GOD. AND MAN, WHAT WAS HE
[1:11:47] DOING GOING THROUGH HIS TIME? BROTHER
[1:11:50] SEAN TALKED ABOUT WHERE WHERE HE WAS
[1:11:52] BEING CHILDRAINED AND BROUGHT TO THAT
[1:11:54] PLACE WHERE THE FATHER COME DOWN AND
[1:11:56] SAID, "THIS IS MY BELOVED SON. HEAR YE
[1:11:58] HIM." LISTEN, IF GOD WALKING IN FLESH,
[1:12:01] THE FULLNESS OF THE GODHEAD BODILY, HAD
[1:12:03] TO BE BROUGHT THROUGH A TRAINING PERIOD,
[1:12:05] HAD TO COME TO HIS ADOPTION, HOW MUCH
[1:12:07] MORE OUGHT EVERY CHRISTIAN BE WORKING
[1:12:09] AND AND DOING EVERYTHING THEY can for
[1:12:11] that goal.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; But it's not a it's not just something
[1:12:15] you add. It's not something you just get
[1:12:16] out of the air or you get out of a book.
[1:12:19] It's something that happens from that
[1:12:20] divine nature. It's been birthed on the
[1:12:23] inside. Brother Brandham said uh and the
[1:12:27] Bible teaches us that the Holy Ghost in
[1:12:28] us is deity, right? But it's the earnest
[1:12:31] of our salvation.
[1:12:33] It's just the earnest of it. So it's the
[1:12:35] beginning of it.
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:12:39] So the quickening power of your
[1:12:41] resurrection, he says, when you receive
[1:12:43] the Holy Spirit is then dwelling in you,
[1:12:47] the potential of it,
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; the potential of it. So when you're born
[1:12:54] again, you say, "Well, praise God. I'm
[1:12:55] already resurrected." Yes, you are.
[1:12:58] Right? The pot in potential form.
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; The seed is in you
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; to be resurrected. And God never planted
[1:13:06] a seed that didn't come up. Amen.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; So we can take a a great we can rest in
[1:13:11] that. We don't have to worry. We don't
[1:13:13] have to to govern our lives in such a
[1:13:15] way of fear and scare and worry about
[1:13:18] things because we know he's got us. And
[1:13:22] yet we have to grow. That seed's got to
[1:13:24] grow once it's quickened. He said the
[1:13:26] quickening power of your resurrection
[1:13:27] when you receive the Holy Spirit is then
[1:13:29] dwelling in you the potential of it. He
[1:13:32] said, "Notice, you are now on your way
[1:13:34] growing to the full resurrection.
[1:13:38] No tree just comes UP OVERNIGHT. IT'S
[1:13:40] GOT TO GROW as we grow in the grace and
[1:13:43] knowledge of God.
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE BAPTIZED INTO THE HOLY SPIRIT."
[1:13:47] He said, "Now, AS THE PENTECOSTAL CHURCH
[1:13:49] BAPTIZED IN THE HOLY SPIRIT, it's begin
[1:13:51] growing." I want to I want to address
[1:13:53] something as it comes to my mind. You
[1:13:55] know, we we feel like, well, the church
[1:13:57] needs to always be in revival, and it
[1:13:59] does. We should strive to stay in
[1:14:01] revival, but individuals within the
[1:14:03] church are not always going to feel like
[1:14:05] they're in revival BECAUSE SOMETIMES GOD
[1:14:08] WANTS YOU TO BE TESTED. SOMETIMES HE'LL
[1:14:11] ACTUALLY WITHDRAW HIMSELF FROM YOU and
[1:14:13] wait to see what you'll do. We find when
[1:14:16] when Abraham, remember when he had
[1:14:18] Ishmael, the the Bible tells US THERE
[1:14:20] WAS A SILENT PERIOD of 12 years in
[1:14:23] between THE TIME ISHMAEL WAS BORN AND
[1:14:26] GOD SPOKE TO ABRAHAM AGAIN. THERE'S NO
[1:14:29] RECORD BETWEEN THAT 12 YEARS THAT GOD
[1:14:30] EVER SPOKE TO ABRAHAM. WHAT WAS IT? IT
[1:14:32] WAS A TESTING TIME. IT WAS A PROVING
[1:14:34] TIME. GOD WASN'T PUNISHING HIM, BUT HE
[1:14:37] WANTED HIM TO STILL BELIEVE. THERE'S
[1:14:39] STILL A PROMISE FOR YOU. EVEN THOUGH
[1:14:40] YOU'VE MESSED UP, EVEN THOUGH YOU'VE
[1:14:42] DONE WRONG, GOD WASN'T PUNISHING HIM FOR
[1:14:44] doing wrong. HE WAS TRYING TO PROVE TO
[1:14:46] HIM, I'M STILL THE GOD WHO'S GOING TO
[1:14:48] MEET MAKE THE PROMISE REAL IN YOUR LIFE.
[1:14:51] YEAH.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; SO SOMETIMES WHEN WE DON'T FEEL GOD LIKE
[1:14:53] WE THINK WE SHOULD AND MAYBE THE CHURCH
[1:14:55] ISN'T AS ON FIRE AND WE JUST DON'T ENJOY
[1:14:58] CHURCH LIKE WE THINK WE SHOULD. WHAT IF
[1:15:00] GOD IS USING THAT TO MATURE YOU?
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; HUH? What if he's changing you in that?
[1:15:07] WHAT IF WHAT HE WANTS IS NOT JUST A GOOD
[1:15:10] SERVICE, BUT WHAT HE WANTS IS A IS A
[1:15:12] FULLGROWN CHRISTIAN, A MATURE SON OR
[1:15:14] DAUGHTER OF GOD. HE WANTS SOMEBODY WHO
[1:15:16] WILL WORSHIP WHEN THEY DON'T FEEL LIKE
[1:15:18] IT. SOMEBODY WHO WILL PRAY. COME ON
[1:15:19] CHURCH. SOMEBODY WHO WILL LIFT THEIR
[1:15:21] HANDS EVEN WHEN EVERYBODY ELSE ISN'T
[1:15:23] DOING IT. SOMEBODY WHO'LL LIFT THEIR
[1:15:25] VOICE EVEN WHEN EVERYBODY ELSE IS
[1:15:26] SILENT. SOMEBODY WHO'LL PRAISE HIM
[1:15:28] THROUGH TRIBULATION AND TRIAL AND
[1:15:30] EVERYTHING GOING ON IN their life.
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:40] Some of you have been through some
[1:15:41] things,
[1:15:43] made some mistakes, made some errors.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; You know you're not tied to that the
[1:15:47] rest of your life.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:50] God used it to help you grow.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you just got to let it be and
[1:15:56] move on. Correct the error and just move
[1:15:58] on and
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; and live for him.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham talked about how it
[1:16:04] come up. The tree, the bride tree came
[1:16:06] up. He said limbs has died. It was
[1:16:10] pruning them off, but the tree is still
[1:16:12] growing. It's still going on because
[1:16:14] it's got to come to the resurrection.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:16:19] Amen. So when you're being pruned,
[1:16:21] things are being pruned off your life,
[1:16:23] don't look at that and say, "God, why
[1:16:24] are you doing this to me?" But say,
[1:16:26] "Lord, keep it up."
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; I know I can't go like this. I've got to
[1:16:30] change, mature into something that you
[1:16:33] want me to be.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; He said they're led by the spirit to
[1:16:37] quicken the word to you who is
[1:16:39] believers. He said the word keeps
[1:16:42] quickening. He said, "As you come to
[1:16:44] first limb, second limb, third limb on
[1:16:48] up."
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; So I don't know which limb you're on
[1:16:50] this morning, but you as an individual,
[1:16:53] as you come to first limb, second limb,
[1:16:56] third limb, it keeps quickening, the
[1:16:58] spirit of God keeps quickening to you.
[1:17:00] Now, it depends on what kind of tree
[1:17:02] that you are, what what kind of uh how
[1:17:05] fast them limbs come out,
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; right? And God's GOT A CERTAIN FRUIT
[1:17:09] that he wants to produce in your life.
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right? And maybe you're a a tree
[1:17:13] that CAN COME UP FAST AND START
[1:17:16] PRODUCING EARLY, but maybe you're one of
[1:17:18] those pecan trees that take forever
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; to produce. I believe IT'S 25 years to
[1:17:24] produce a first crop of pecans.
[1:17:27] Think about that for a minute. A SORERO
[1:17:29] CACTUS in in the desert puts out its
[1:17:32] first arm at 75 years old. It's not too
[1:17:37] late for some of y'all.
[1:17:40] It's drinking. It's drinking. It's
[1:17:42] taking in nutrients. IT'S GROWING. IT'S
[1:17:45] IT'S IT'S JUST constantly swelling up.
[1:17:47] And but it just looks like this. And you
[1:17:49] know, those aren't the pretty ones.
[1:17:50] Nobody takes a PICTURE IN FRONT OF A
[1:17:52] HALF-GROWN SORRO,
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? You find the pretty sorro. YOU
[1:17:57] FIND THE GREAT CACTUS THAT'S GOT ALL THE
[1:17:59] BEAUTIFUL ARMS OUT. THAT THING'S LIKE
[1:18:01] 150 YEARS OLD. IT'S ALMOST READY TO DIE,
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? IT'S LIVED ITS LIFE. NO WONDER
[1:18:08] IT'S GOT LIMBS. IT'S ABLE COME ON. SOME
[1:18:10] OF Y'ALL KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
[1:18:11] YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH SOME THINGS. THAT'S
[1:18:13] WHY YOU'RE ABLE TO RAISE YOUR HANDS.
[1:18:14] THAT'S WHY YOU GOT LIMBS TO BE ABLE TO
[1:18:16] PUSH OUT. YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH SOME
[1:18:18] THINGS. YOU YOU YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH THE
[1:18:19] BATTLE OF LIFE. WE SHOULD NOT DESPISE
[1:18:22] THOSE THAT ARE GROWING AROUND US.
[1:18:27] [sighs]
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; So the oak tree takes years. You plant
[1:18:30] an oak tree for the next generation,
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; right? You plant an oak tree for
[1:18:37] something coming. If you're young, you
[1:18:38] plant it for when you're old
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; or you plant it for the next generation,
[1:18:42] but you plant a pine tree or something
[1:18:44] like that, it comes up a little bit
[1:18:45] quicker. But it's also more breakable,
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; right? So, if you want something solid,
[1:18:50] many times it takes time. Now, brother
[1:18:53] Brandon said, "What does a tree have to
[1:18:54] do?"
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; When you plant it, the only thing you
[1:18:56] have to do is water it
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; and then it's got to drink. Yeah,
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; the leaves are in it. The apples are in
[1:19:02] it. Everything is right in the tree. But
[1:19:06] it's got to drink. You know where I'm
[1:19:07] going with this? It's got to drink more
[1:19:09] than its portion.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; And as it drinks, IT PUSHES OUT, PUSHES
[1:19:14] OUT LEAVES, PUSHES OUT BLOSSOMS, PUSHES
[1:19:17] OUT APPLES.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; And after a while, PEOPLE BEGIN TO SEE,
[1:19:21] WELL, I HADN'T NOTICED THAT tree was
[1:19:22] producing. We've got pimmen trees near
[1:19:25] us. I don't know how long a pimmen tree
[1:19:27] takes to grow, but when we take a walk,
[1:19:28] sometimes I like to look down at the pim
[1:19:30] pimmen trees and and see and I I felt
[1:19:33] like Jesus walking seeing the fig tree
[1:19:35] this year. There were no pimmons on the
[1:19:37] pimmen trees. And finally, we got down
[1:19:39] to one. It had one lonely pimmen
[1:19:43] on that tree, but we still know how the
[1:19:44] weather's going to be because of that.
[1:19:46] You know,
[1:19:49] [laughter]
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; it has not really. I'm kidding. You
[1:19:53] know, I know that's not always 100%
[1:19:56] accurate, but you know, the pimantry,
[1:19:59] it's got a purpose. Just one purpose,
[1:20:00] give out pimmons. But yet, all the
[1:20:02] pimmon trees we walk by wasn't doing it.
[1:20:04] BUT THAT ONE PUT OUT ONE. YOU CAN
[1:20:06] IMAGINE HOW STRANGE IT MUST SEEM. If
[1:20:07] you're walking by a bunch of trees,
[1:20:09] never had a pimmen on them. Years later,
[1:20:11] you're walking by the same one. Here
[1:20:12] it's full of pimmens. WHAT IS IT? THAT
[1:20:14] FIRST ONE ACTUALLY looks odd to it. BUT
[1:20:16] AFTER A WHILE, you get used to seeing
[1:20:17] it.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; Listen, it would be strange to see some
[1:20:20] of you backslide.
[1:20:23] Right? BECAUSE YOU'VE LIVED THE LIFE FOR
[1:20:25] SO LONG. IT WOULD BE STRANGE TO SEE YOU
[1:20:27] GO OUT IN the world. I mean, just go out
[1:20:28] in the world and live like the devil.
[1:20:30] IT'D BE STRANGE TO SEE THAT. But you get
[1:20:32] a newborn Christian, it's not so strange
[1:20:34] to see them FAIL AND FALL. WHY IS THAT?
[1:20:36] I'm not condoning it. I'M I'M EXPLAINING
[1:20:38] IT. WHAT IS IT, GOD? THEY HAVEN'T
[1:20:40] REACHED THIS PLACE OF MATURITY YET.
[1:20:42] LISTEN, WE DON'T GIVE UP ON OUR
[1:20:43] SALVATION BECAUSE WE FAIL, BUT WE PRESS
[1:20:45] ON. LISTEN, BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID DAVID
[1:20:47] DIDN'T LOSE HIS SALVATION WHEN HE DID
[1:20:49] WHAT HE DID, BUT HE LOST THE JOY OF IT.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; HUH? HE SAID, "RESTORE UNTO ME
[1:20:54] [screaming] THE JOY OF MY SALVATION."
[1:20:57] LISTEN, THAT'S WHAT MANY OF US need
[1:20:58] today.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; Cuz we're not just quickened once. Did
[1:21:01] you know that? We're quickened many
[1:21:03] times by the SPIRIT OF GOD. I PRAY THAT
[1:21:06] WE WOULD BE QUICKENED THIS MORNING IN
[1:21:07] THE HOUSE OF GOD TO RECEIVE THE WORD OF
[1:21:10] GOD AND TO PRESS FORWARD IN THE KINGDOM
[1:21:12] of God.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:21:14] He said it's got to keep drinking,
[1:21:16] drinking, drinking in order to push out.
[1:21:18] And when we take a promise of God, drop
[1:21:20] it into our heart. He keeps watering it
[1:21:23] with faith and it keeps pushing out,
[1:21:26] pushing out. Hallelujah.
[1:21:28] He said when Christ is planted in our
[1:21:30] heart, the Holy Ghost, only thing we do
[1:21:33] is drink in this word of God and it
[1:21:36] pushes out salvation. It pushes out
[1:21:38] divine healing. It pushes out glory. It
[1:21:42] pushes out. Everything that we have need
[1:21:44] of is right in us when we're planted
[1:21:46] in Christ Jesus. Now, we're gonna start
[1:21:49] preaching here in a minute.
[1:21:52] I just I'm not gotten yet to what I want
[1:21:54] to preach on. So, you just forgive me
[1:21:56] this morning. I won't hold you long.
[1:21:59] Help us. Lord is right.
[1:22:02] We must add virtue to our foundation of
[1:22:04] faith. Now remember second Peter chapter
[1:22:06] 1:5
[1:22:08] Peter says beside this giving all
[1:22:10] diligence add to your faith virtue
[1:22:13] and to virtue knowledge. So here's where
[1:22:16] we're at. We've laid a foundation and
[1:22:19] we're about to add to our faith virtue.
[1:22:23] Brother Brandon said here's what we do.
[1:22:24] What's the first thing? Have faith and
[1:22:25] be born again. That's laying the
[1:22:27] foundation. First pour your foundation.
[1:22:29] Then to your faith add virtue. I want to
[1:22:33] say something about add that word add in
[1:22:35] the in the in the uh New Testament. The
[1:22:38] u the authorized version or the King
[1:22:41] James version tells us to add one virtue
[1:22:43] to another. But the in the Greek it's
[1:22:46] actually to develop one virtue
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; in the exercise of another. So it's an
[1:22:50] increase by growth
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; not by external junction.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; So so it's an increase that comes from
[1:22:57] the foundation.
[1:22:59] each new grace springing out of
[1:23:01] attempting and perfecting the other. So
[1:23:04] it it's like this. In your faith supply
[1:23:05] virtue and your virtue knowledge,
[1:23:07] brother Brandham says it this way. He
[1:23:09] said when he's born again, he said then
[1:23:11] he's in line of fellowship because he's
[1:23:13] a new creation.
[1:23:15] He said that old suspicious doubting
[1:23:17] character he was. Do you remember that
[1:23:20] old suspicious doubting character you
[1:23:22] were?
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; Do you remember him or her?
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; Remember them? They were suspicious. But
[1:23:28] now YOU'VE LEARNED TO TRUST GOD.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; WHY? WHAT HAPPENED? RIGHT? You've been
[1:23:32] born again.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; But he SAID THAT OLD SUSPICIOUS DOUBTING
[1:23:36] character he was in is dead. Now he's a
[1:23:38] new creation. So you see, he don't have
[1:23:41] to add anything to his now because it'll
[1:23:45] automatically
[1:23:46] be added.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; Now that's a striking statement, brother
[1:23:49] Ram. You just told us add and ADD AND
[1:23:51] ADD. BUT HE'S TALKING ABOUT THE KIND OF
[1:23:52] ADDITION that comes from within because
[1:23:55] the believer's been born again. So you
[1:23:58] add to your faith or or uh to your faith
[1:24:00] is added virtue. Virtue is actually
[1:24:04] manliness, valor, excellence. It's uh
[1:24:08] comes from a word that means to be
[1:24:10] stronger, to be a man. That's what it
[1:24:13] means to be stronger. It's strength.
[1:24:15] Virtue is strength. So let faith supply
[1:24:19] strength in in Luke 8:46 Jesus uses
[1:24:22] actually a different Greek word but it's
[1:24:24] dunan dunanimous which is a very similar
[1:24:28] meaning it also means strength and it's
[1:24:30] translated virtue in the English
[1:24:32] supernatural strength in Luke 8 verse 43
[1:24:35] it says a woman having an issue of blood
[1:24:37] 12 years which had spent all her living
[1:24:39] upon physicians neither could be healed
[1:24:41] of any came behind him and touched the
[1:24:44] border of his garment. Now notice now
[1:24:46] Jesus has grown up. We've fast
[1:24:49] forwarded,
[1:24:50] right? Remember when you could had a VHS
[1:24:52] tape and you or or a cassette tape and
[1:24:55] you hit the fast forward and make that
[1:24:56] little sound? We fast forwarded to Jesus
[1:24:59] in his ministry, right? And he's healing
[1:25:02] the sick, raising the dead. He's the son
[1:25:05] of God. He's a manifested son of God.
[1:25:08] And so what's happening now is he has
[1:25:10] something in him to give out,
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; right? He's got something in him.
[1:25:16] Listen, he he preached the SERMON ON THE
[1:25:18] MOUNT AS an adult. HE DIDN'T PREACH THE
[1:25:21] SERMON ON THE MOUNT AS a baby in the
[1:25:22] manger.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; Didn't you understand that this morning?
[1:25:26] HE DIDN'T COME OUT THERE AND SAY and
[1:25:28] say, "Blessed are the meek."
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; Right? That' been that'd been a strange
[1:25:32] one, wouldn't it? A little bitty baby
[1:25:33] laying there and said, "Blessed are you,
[1:25:35] mother." You know, but what did he say?
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; That's what he said. Said, "You know
[1:25:43] what? The words of Jesus were when he
[1:25:45] come to you. Absolutely. Same as your
[1:25:47] baby was and I and mine were and and you
[1:25:50] were when you were a baby. He screamed.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; HE CRIED FOR HIS MOTHER.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; Was the cry of Jehovah.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; Are you with me, church?
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; He wasn't full grown. HE WAS JUST A
[1:26:03] BABY. BUT NOW HE HAD GROWN UP. AND A
[1:26:06] WOMAN THAT needed help. YES,
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; SIR.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; AND FOR 12 YEARS, SHE HAD BEEN TO EVERY
[1:26:11] DOCTOR THAT SHE COULD GO TO. AND SHE'D
[1:26:13] BEEN TO EVERY KIND OF A PHYSICIAN THAT
[1:26:15] SHE COULD. She'd been down to the maybe
[1:26:17] the psychiatrist and the psychologist
[1:26:19] and the AND THE MARRIAGE COUNSELOR. AND
[1:26:22] THERE nothing wrong with any of that,
[1:26:23] BUT SHE'D BEEN DOWN TO ALL OF THEM.
[1:26:25] SHE'D BEEN DOWN TO THE TO THE DOCTOR.
[1:26:27] SHE'D BEEN DOWN TAKEN THE PILLS. SHE'D
[1:26:29] DONE EVERYTHING THAT THEY TOLD HER TO
[1:26:30] DO. AND THE BIBLE SAID IT JUST TOOK ALL
[1:26:32] HER MONEY. IT DIDN'T ACTUALLY HELP HER.
[1:26:34] BUT ONE DAY, SHE COME IN CONTACT WITH
[1:26:36] JESUS. AND HER FAITH REACHED A PLACE IF
[1:26:39] I CAN JUST TOUCH THE HYMN OF HIS
[1:26:41] GARMENT. I BELIEVE HE'S THE MANIFESTED
[1:26:44] SON OF GOD. I BELIEVE IN WHAT HAS BEEN
[1:26:46] TOLD ME. I BELIEVE IN THESE MIRACLES
[1:26:48] THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE. AND AND IT
[1:26:50] INCREASED HER FAITH UNTIL SHE WENT AND
[1:26:52] TOUCHED SHE PRESSED HER WAY THROUGH THE
[1:26:54] CROWD UNTIL SHE TOUCHED THE HYMN.
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; Of his garment.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; The hymn of his garment. Oh, church.
[1:27:04] And Jesus said,
[1:27:07] "And immediately hear her her BLOOD
[1:27:09] ISSUES STAUNCH." And Jesus said, "Who
[1:27:12] touched me?" And when all denied Peter,
[1:27:14] and they that were with him said,
[1:27:15] "Master, the multitude throng thee and
[1:27:18] press thee AND SAYEST THOU, WHO TOUCHED
[1:27:21] ME?" And Jesus said, "Somebody hath
[1:27:24] touched me?"
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; For I perceive that virtue
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; is gone out of me.
[1:27:31] See, he was that pyramid, right? He had
[1:27:34] virtue added to his faith.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; He He had virtue, something in him that
[1:27:41] he could give out to her, sir.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; And she was able to appropriate that by
[1:27:46] faith. DON'T YOU BELIEVE HE'S STILL THE
[1:27:47] GREAT HIGH PRIEST THAT CAN BE TOUCHED BY
[1:27:49] THE FEELING OF OUR INFIRMITY? DON'T YOU
[1:27:51] BELIEVE YOU CAN STILL TOUCH THE HYMN OF
[1:27:53] HIS GARMENT THIS MORNING? IF YOU'RE SICK
[1:27:55] OR IN NEED OR WORRIED OR STRESSED OUT
[1:27:57] THIS MORNING, YOU CAN STILL GRAB A HOLD
[1:27:59] [screaming] OF THE HEM OF HIS GARMENT
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; AND TOUCH JESUS.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Somebody touch me." And
[1:28:08] when the woman saw that she was not hid,
[1:28:11] she came trembling and falling down
[1:28:12] before him, she declared unto him before
[1:28:15] all the people for what cause she had
[1:28:17] touched him and how she was healed
[1:28:20] immediately.
[1:28:22] Now what did he say? Somebody touched
[1:28:25] me. Virtue virtue went out from me.
[1:28:29] Virtue went out from me. So he had
[1:28:33] conducted his life and followed the will
[1:28:35] of the father until there was virtue in
[1:28:38] him to give out.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; Now you say, well that that that could
[1:28:43] have come when he was a baby. But again,
[1:28:46] this didn't happen when he was a baby.
[1:28:47] Many people probably held him in their
[1:28:49] arms. Yeah,
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; they may have passed him around like we
[1:28:51] do some of our babies here in the church
[1:28:53] from person to person and they held
[1:28:56] JESUS AND MAYBE FELT NO virtue
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; and he didn't get weak. In fact, in that
[1:29:00] very crowd, THERE WERE MANY WHO TOUCHED
[1:29:02] HIM BUT THEY DIDN'T TOUCH HIM IN the
[1:29:03] right way.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; Right. They they they even brother
[1:29:05] Brandon said the soldiers laid THEIR
[1:29:07] HANDS ACROSS HIS FACE and they didn't
[1:29:09] feel no virtue.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; BUT A WOMAN COME BY FAITH AND FELT THAT.
[1:29:13] RIGHT?
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; But he had reached a maturity in his
[1:29:17] life before he began his ministry. He'd
[1:29:20] reached a maturity and then God
[1:29:22] evidenced it. He said, "Behold the lamb
[1:29:23] of God who takes away the sins of the
[1:29:24] world." He said, "This is my beloved son
[1:29:27] in whom I'm well pleased and pleased to
[1:29:29] dwell in." He said, "Hear ye him." And
[1:29:31] so, he's reached that. He's reached that
[1:29:33] place. He's a he's in his ministry doing
[1:29:35] what God called him to do. And here he
[1:29:37] has a strength and a virtue for others.
[1:29:39] But you know what we sing? We've sung it
[1:29:41] all our lives. I love the song. Brother
[1:29:42] Brandon said it was one of his favorite
[1:29:44] old hymns was to be like Jesus,
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; right? To be like Jesus. What does that
[1:29:50] mean? It means to have virtue like
[1:29:52] Jesus,
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? TO HAVE SOMETHING WITHIN US TO
[1:29:56] give out,
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN WE CHANGE OVER and it's a
[1:30:01] wonderful thing to watch as a pastor
[1:30:02] because you get to watch people for
[1:30:03] years and people who are going through a
[1:30:06] trial many times need help. And people
[1:30:10] after they've COME OUT OF A TRIAL
[1:30:11] STRONGER than they were before, they can
[1:30:13] give help.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; And it's a wonderful THING TO WATCH THAT
[1:30:17] TRANSFORMATION, brother Paul, from
[1:30:19] somebody who needs constant attention
[1:30:21] and needs help and all THOSE THINGS AND
[1:30:23] THEN AFTER A WHILE THEY GET TO A PLACE
[1:30:25] WHERE THEY CAN receive help.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; There's something in them to receive
[1:30:28] help. OH GOD, I PRAY THAT'D BE SOMEBODY
[1:30:30] WHO COULD RECEIVE HELP.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; Oh my. And also give help. Listen, if
[1:30:35] you DON'T RECEIVE IT, YOU CAN'T EVER
[1:30:37] GIVE IT. I KNOW THERE'S PEOPLE WHO WHO
[1:30:39] FEEL LIKE, WELL, I I, you know, I just
[1:30:41] won't bother nobody. I won't I DON'T
[1:30:43] NEED ANY HELP. I don't need any counsel.
[1:30:45] I don't need to hear preaching. I I JUST
[1:30:47] WON'T BOTHER NOBODY till I get things
[1:30:48] right. I work things out in my own mind.
[1:30:50] Listen, you can't do that. It's no shame
[1:30:52] in looking for help. EVERYBODY NEEDS
[1:30:54] HELP FROM now now and then. EVEN JESUS
[1:30:56] WAS IN A FLESH BODY AND WHEN HE WHEN THE
[1:30:59] DISCIPLES COME WITH HIM, HE SAID, "PRAY
[1:31:00] WITH me for an hour.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; PRAY WITH ME. STAND WITH ME. YOU NEED
[1:31:04] SOMEBODY PRAYING FOR YOU. YOU NEED A
[1:31:06] CHURCH BODY OF FELLOWSHIP.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; But it's wonderful to watch that
[1:31:11] transfer over in life where somebody is
[1:31:14] very needy and then they get to a place
[1:31:16] where they can help.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; And then because they're human beings,
[1:31:20] maybe they get older
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; and they need help again and then
[1:31:24] there's others who have virtue,
[1:31:26] right? Strength to help. Listen, virtue
[1:31:30] is strength for others. Brother Brandon
[1:31:31] said, "Virtue, before you can let it
[1:31:33] out, you've got to have it first."
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; YOU HAVEN'T GOT IT, IT WON'T come out.
[1:31:41] There's nothing for it to come out of.
[1:31:45] I could go many different ways with
[1:31:46] this. It's why it's important for
[1:31:47] preachers to hear preaching.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; It's why it's important for preachers to
[1:31:52] pray and and song leaders to pray and
[1:31:55] and deacons to pray and people WHO ARE
[1:31:57] GOING TO HELP SOMEBODY ELSE.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:32:00] need to be helped
[1:32:03] [clears throat] themselves.
[1:32:04] Are you with me? If you can't receive,
[1:32:07] you can't give out. That's right.
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; If you can't be led, you can't lead. If
[1:32:12] you don't have strength coming in, YOU
[1:32:15] CAN'T HAVE STRENGTH GOING OUT. WHAT ARE
[1:32:18] WE TRYING TO DO WITH our young people?
[1:32:19] OUR OUR YOUNG PEOPLE, YOU KNOW, WE'RE
[1:32:21] WE'RE PUTTING A LOT INTO them right now.
[1:32:23] We're trying to pour into them. WE WANT
[1:32:25] TO DO THINGS FOR THEM AND DO EVERYTHING
[1:32:27] WE CAN. I THINK US parents ought to
[1:32:29] support what the Sunday school teachers
[1:32:31] do. We're trying to pour something into
[1:32:33] them and they may have a Christmas play
[1:32:35] this year. I don't know about that. I I
[1:32:36] trust that they will. And that'll be A
[1:32:39] IT TAKES A LOT OF EFFORT to do that. And
[1:32:41] we ought to SUPPORT THAT IF WE CAN. WHY?
[1:32:43] BECAUSE THEY'RE TRYING TO PUT SOMETHING
[1:32:44] INTO OUR CHILDREN. SUNDAY SCHOOL, WE'RE
[1:32:46] TRYING TO PUT SOMETHING IN. PREACHING
[1:32:48] THESE YOUTH SERVICES WE HAVE AND THINGS
[1:32:49] THAT WE'RE TRYING TO PUT SOMETHING IN TO
[1:32:51] THE CHILDREN. WHY ARE WE TRYING TO DO
[1:32:53] THAT? BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT THEM TO STAY
[1:32:55] CHILDREN. WE WHEN THEY GROW UP, WE KNOW
[1:32:56] THEY WILL. WHETHER WHETHER THEY GROW UP
[1:32:58] SPIRITUALLY OR NOT, THEY'LL GROW UP
[1:33:00] NATURALLY.
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; And we want them TO GROW UP SPIRITUALLY
[1:33:03] WHERE THEY CAN BE A HELP, WHERE THEY CAN
[1:33:05] BE THE deacons and be the song leaders,
[1:33:07] be the musicians, AND BE BE THE PASTOR.
[1:33:09] COME ON, CHURCH. SOMEBODY'S GOT TO DO IT
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; IF THE LORD CARRIES. SO, LET'S POUR INTO
[1:33:14] THEM SO THAT THERE'S NOT A A DEFICIT OF
[1:33:17] STRENGTH IN THE NEXT GENERATION, BUT
[1:33:20] THAT VIRTUE will flow from one
[1:33:21] generation to another.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:24] I don't know about you, but I want to
[1:33:26] have a place that my kids can come to
[1:33:30] and touch the hymn of his garment.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; IF WE ARE THE [screaming] BODY OF
[1:33:35] CHRIST,
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; I WANT THERE TO BE A PLACE ON THE EARTH.
[1:33:39] [snorts]
[1:33:40] AND I'VE thought a lot about this
[1:33:41] recently and I'm going to talk about you
[1:33:42] because y'all have pulled together so
[1:33:44] well. But I see so many churches fuss
[1:33:46] and fight with each other and carry on
[1:33:48] and and and and deacons at each other's
[1:33:50] throat and preachers at EACH OTHER'S
[1:33:51] THROAT AND EVERYBODY'S THINKING ABOUT
[1:33:53] DOING THIS OR DOING THAT AND THERE'S NO
[1:33:55] UNITY. AND I WANT TO ASK THE CHURCH, ARE
[1:33:57] YOU are are do you want a church? DO YOU
[1:34:00] WANT A PLACE FOR YOUR CHILDREN TO COME
[1:34:01] OR DO YOU WANT A FUSS?
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU CAN'T HAVE BOTH.
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; You're going you're GOING TO DESTROY IT.
[1:34:09] YOU'RE GOING to You're going to cook the
[1:34:11] go the the the the golden egg that the
[1:34:13] goose laid. Maybe that's the wrong term.
[1:34:16] Kill the goose that laid the golden egg.
[1:34:18] I'll get my metaphors right in a minute.
[1:34:22] Do you WANT TO FIGHT OR DO YOU WANT to
[1:34:24] have church?
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE PREACHER
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; OR DO YOU WANT YOUR KIDS TO HAVE
[1:34:29] confidence in the man of God?
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; Well, come on, church. DO YOU WANT TO
[1:34:32] PUT EVERYBODY DOWN OR DO YOU WANT PEOPLE
[1:34:34] TO BE ABLE TO HAVE CONFIDENCE IN LOVE
[1:34:36] going to the house of God? you you can't
[1:34:38] have both.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; So we want to put VIRTUE INTO THE NEXT
[1:34:42] GENERATION. The only way we can do that
[1:34:43] is by having virtue ourselves. If we
[1:34:46] DON'T HAVE STRENGTH COMING IN, you can't
[1:34:48] have strength going out. Now brother
[1:34:50] Brandham makes this allegory and he says
[1:34:53] he said, "What if SOMEBODY COME TO DRAW
[1:34:55] from us and they and the check bounced,
[1:34:59] right? IF SOMEBODY COME TO TOUCH THE
[1:35:02] HYMN OF YOUR GARMENT, we put it like
[1:35:04] that. They had confidence in you and
[1:35:06] faith in you that that you were
[1:35:10] we're the body of Christ, are we not?
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; Somebody had confidence in faith in you
[1:35:14] that you could help.
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; And maybe you you just not been
[1:35:22] receiving
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; because of something. You know,
[1:35:24] something's just kept you. You've got
[1:35:26] some besetting sin in your life or some
[1:35:28] little issue that you've just not been
[1:35:30] following the word or maybe you got a
[1:35:32] critical spirit or something on you and
[1:35:34] you just not been receiving. And at that
[1:35:36] moment that baby needs prayed for.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; And that moment that that elder is on
[1:35:43] their last leg and you didn't know and
[1:35:44] you're asked to pray that moment
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; they need virtue.
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; Now all of us have experienced a virtue
[1:35:51] deficit at some point in our life. Yeah,
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; if you don't believe me, you know, come
[1:35:55] to my house on Mondays, you know,
[1:35:58] look at Elijah after he preached to
[1:36:00] Jezebel and declared the word of the
[1:36:02] Lord and KILLED ALL THE PROPHETS AND
[1:36:04] then runs from Jezebel and tells GOD TO
[1:36:07] TAKE HIS LIFE. HE DON'T HAVE THE
[1:36:09] STRENGTH TO GIVE OUT. But what did the
[1:36:11] angels do? THEY COME DOWN TO HIM AND AND
[1:36:13] THEY HAD A HE HAD A JUNIPER TREE
[1:36:15] EXPERIENCE AND THE ANGEL WITH THE
[1:36:16] SOFTEST HANDS CRESTED HIS BROW. THE ONE
[1:36:19] WHO KNEW HOW TO COOK. I DIDN'T KNOW
[1:36:20] THERE WERE ANGELS KNEW HOW TO COOK, BUT
[1:36:22] BUT THE BRANDON TOLD US THERE WERE. THEY
[1:36:23] COOKED CAKES, HE SAID, AND JOHNNY BREAD
[1:36:25] AND AND WHATEVER that is. AND AND AND
[1:36:27] CORNBREAD, WHATEVER IT IS. AND THEY THEY
[1:36:29] PUT IT TOGETHER AND AND COOKED IT FOR
[1:36:31] HIM. AND WHEN THEY DID, WHAT IT WHAT
[1:36:33] HAPPENED? IT STRENGTHENED HIM SO MUCH
[1:36:35] THAT HE WAS ABLE TO GO ALL AND DO ALL
[1:36:37] THAT GOD WANTED HIM TO DO. OH, CHURCH,
[1:36:39] DON'T YOU REALIZE THERE'S VIRTUE FOR
[1:36:41] YOU? SOMETIMES YOU JUST GOT TO SIT UNDER
[1:36:43] A juniper tree for a while and take it.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; BUT BUT THERE'S VIRTUE FOR YOU. THERE'S
[1:36:48] VIRTUE. THERE'S STRENGTH GOD WANTS TO
[1:36:50] GIVE YOU. AND GOD, HELP US TO TAKE
[1:36:52] ADVANTAGE OF THAT AND DRAW FROM THE
[1:36:54] STRENGTH OF THE WORD SO WE CAN BE READY
[1:36:57] SO THE CHECK DON'T BOUNCE WHEN SOMEBODY
[1:36:58] TRIES TO cash it.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; I probably shouldn't get into this cuz
[1:37:04] I'm going to make somebody feel bad
[1:37:05] because I know some of y'all do have
[1:37:08] done that. I do it too. Have done it in
[1:37:11] the past. Thank God I haven't done that
[1:37:13] in a long time. But you ever bounce a
[1:37:15] check?
[1:37:17] Nobody going to raise their hands. Some
[1:37:19] of our young people are like, "We never
[1:37:20] wrote a check." We talking about
[1:37:22] bouncing a check. We don't write checks
[1:37:24] anymore. Used to we, you know, checks
[1:37:28] would bounce cuz it take a couple days
[1:37:29] and you had hope,
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; you know, that there would be money in
[1:37:33] the account. Some of y'all know what I'm
[1:37:35] talking about. That's the way some of us
[1:37:37] live spiritually. You know, we write
[1:37:39] that check. Oh, I'll pray for you,
[1:37:40] buddy. I'll be praying for you. And you
[1:37:42] just hope that that check don't bounce.
[1:37:44] Come on.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; But when you reach a place of maturity
[1:37:48] in your life, you realize, hey, the
[1:37:49] money's got to be there before you write
[1:37:51] the check.
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; If I got nothing to give, I I've had to
[1:37:56] reach that I'm maturing as a pastor, and
[1:37:58] I haven't reached that place yet.
[1:37:59] Someday I'll be as mature as some
[1:38:01] others, but I I'm not reach that place
[1:38:04] of maturity yet, maybe. But you, you
[1:38:06] know, I I am beginning to realize that I
[1:38:08] can't give what I don't have.
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; Right. I I can't do that if I'm wore out
[1:38:14] and I've I've done, you know, just just
[1:38:17] doing whatever I wanted to do and and
[1:38:19] hanging out with people or doing
[1:38:20] whatever I want to do. Like, if I'm wore
[1:38:21] out from doing that, I can't preach the
[1:38:23] way I want to. Right? If I'm up all
[1:38:25] night Saturday night, I can't preach the
[1:38:26] way I want to. I believe God gives us
[1:38:28] grace if we have to do it. But when we
[1:38:30] can, when I can, I go to bed early on
[1:38:32] Saturday or I get I do what I need to do
[1:38:34] on on Saturday to get ready for Sunday
[1:38:36] or Friday to get ready for Sunday
[1:38:38] because I'm learning that if I don't
[1:38:40] have
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; have it to give, I I'm no good to
[1:38:43] people.
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; I'm learning that it's not how much you
[1:38:46] preach, but how well you present the
[1:38:49] gospel. AND AND IT'S THE QUALITY OF WHAT
[1:38:51] YOU GOT TO SAY, NOT JUST HOW MANY WORDS
[1:38:54] you say.
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; Right. AND AND WE ALL HAVE to learn
[1:38:59] that. And and IN OUR OWN LIVES, YOU GOT
[1:39:00] TO LEARN THAT IT'S NOT JUST, WELL, I'LL
[1:39:02] PRAY FOR YOU AND I'LL PRAY FOR YOU. YOU
[1:39:04] want to pray for people, BUT YOU GOT TO
[1:39:05] BE IN A PLACE WHERE YOU CAN PRAY for
[1:39:07] people,
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; you know, and and people get discouraged
[1:39:11] when they can't empty the hospital, but
[1:39:13] you got to you GOT TO GET FILLED UP
[1:39:15] BEFORE YOU can go out and lay hands on
[1:39:17] the people. And that's that's a and I
[1:39:20] understand the Bible CALLS US TO DO THAT
[1:39:22] AND TO BE THAT. We're called to be sons.
[1:39:24] We're called to lay hands on the sick
[1:39:25] AND THEY'LL RECOVER. WE'RE CALLED THAT
[1:39:27] BY THE WORD. AND I BELIEVE IF I do it,
[1:39:28] no matter how tired I am physically,
[1:39:30] THAT THAT'LL GO TO YOU. But but I GOT TO
[1:39:32] HAVE SPIRITUAL VIRTUE IN MY LIFE IN
[1:39:34] ORDER TO give spiritual virtue out.
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; Are you still with me?
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRANDON SAID IT MIGHT BE YOU
[1:39:41] SAY, "WELL, I WONDER WHY MY why my
[1:39:43] account is empty." Brother Brandon said
[1:39:44] it might be the reason you don't have it
[1:39:46] because many churches teach you don't
[1:39:47] have to have it or the days of its past.
[1:39:50] I'm glad that's not the case here. Come
[1:39:52] on.
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; Right. We preach that the days of
[1:39:54] miracles are not past, but they're
[1:39:55] present.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; That testimony of Lizzie Joe being
[1:39:59] healed has gone around the world now.
[1:40:00] I've seen it posted by people and gone
[1:40:03] around the world, and I I appreciate
[1:40:04] that. Let's be a strength to people.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; Let's be a strength. We don't have to be
[1:40:08] known everywhere, but when we can be a
[1:40:10] strength, let's be a strength.
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; Listen, he said they they preached the
[1:40:15] days of miracles past. They don't have
[1:40:16] to have it. Only thing you have to do is
[1:40:17] just join church. Yeah. Days has passed.
[1:40:19] He said if virtue went from him to heal
[1:40:22] the woman that was sick, he's expecting
[1:40:23] the same virtue in his church BECAUSE HE
[1:40:27] WAS OUR EXAMPLE. AND IF HE HAD VIRTUE to
[1:40:29] give to the people, he expects us to
[1:40:30] have virtue to give to the people. What
[1:40:33] is virtue? VIRTUE IS STRENGTH, POWER.
[1:40:35] AND PETER SAID HERE, ADD VIRTUE. PETER'S
[1:40:37] talking about building the house of God.
[1:40:39] See, the temple of God, FIXING IT TO A
[1:40:41] PLACE, HE SAID, AFTER YOU HAVE FAITH,
[1:40:42] YOU MUST HAVE VIRTUE with it. Have
[1:40:44] virtue for who? FOR THE WHOLE WORLD. CUZ
[1:40:49] YOU DON'T KNOW WHO MIGHT BE WANTING TO
[1:40:50] PULL VIRTUE OUT OF YOUR LIFE. AND YOU
[1:40:52] MIGHT BE ABLE TO STRENGTHEN SOMEBODY
[1:40:54] ELSE. IT MIGHT BE THE CASHIER AT THE
[1:40:56] GROCERY STORE. IT MIGHT BE SOMEBODY YOU
[1:40:58] DON'T BARELY EVEN KNOW. IT MIGHT BE A
[1:41:00] NEIGHBOR. IT MIGHT BE SOME SOME OF Y'ALL
[1:41:01] ARE NURSES. YOU'RE DOING A GREAT WORK.
[1:41:03] WELL, WHO KNOWS THAT YOU MIGHT GIVE
[1:41:05] VIRTUE OUT TO SOMEBODY WHO NEEDS VIRTUE.
[1:41:07] I KNOW YOU'VE EXPERIENCED THAT, BROTHER
[1:41:08] LOGAN, WHERE SOMEBODY NEEDED STRENGTH
[1:41:10] AND YOU HAD SOMETHING TO TELL THEM,
[1:41:12] SOMETHING TO GIVE THEM. LET'S DRAW IN
[1:41:14] ALL WE CAN SO WE CAN HAVE VIRTUE FOR THE
[1:41:16] whole world. Come on. Yes.
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; Not just think about ourselves,
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; think about others.
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; Good.
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; It's kind of virtuous tied to how we
[1:41:28] live.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; See, there's a direct link to how we
[1:41:31] live and the power in our prayers.
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; Do you know that? You say, "Oh, that's
[1:41:35] not true. Why were the disciples not
[1:41:37] able to heal the child with epilepsy?"
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; Think about it. We'll answer that in a
[1:41:44] in a moment. You see, preaching doesn't
[1:41:46] save us.
[1:41:48] It doesn't save me to preach,
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; right? I should say it that way.
[1:41:53] Preaching does not save me.
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; I could lay down my Bible today and
[1:41:57] never preach again. I would not be lost.
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; Do we understand that?
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; Works don't save you.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; Nothing you do can save you.
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; That's on him. You can't by your own
[1:42:11] effort
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; avail yourself of the cross of Calvary.
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; He did that for you and had you in his
[1:42:17] mind or you can't you can't make get
[1:42:18] blood out of a turnup. Brother Brandon
[1:42:20] said, right? That's got to be something
[1:42:21] he did for you.
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; Works do not save you. But the virtue I
[1:42:27] have to help others depends on how much
[1:42:30] confidence I have in my own life.
[1:42:34] Now, that's just the truth. Look what
[1:42:36] Look what John says. My little children,
[1:42:39] let us not love in word, neither in
[1:42:40] tongue, but in deed and in truth. AND
[1:42:44] HEREBY WE KNOW THAT WE ARE OF THE TRUTH,
[1:42:46] and shall assure our hearts before him.
[1:42:49] &gt;&gt; FOR IF OUR HEART CONDEMN US.
[1:42:53] NOW LOOK WHAT HE'S SAYING. JUST BECAUSE
[1:42:55] YOUR HEART CONDEMNS YOU DON'T MEAN
[1:42:56] YOU'RE LOST.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; When you WERE LOST, IT PROBABLY DIDN'T
[1:42:59] CONDEMN YOU.
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; BUT YOUR HEART CONDEMNS YOU NOW BECAUSE
[1:43:03] YOU HAVE BEEN SAVED. IT FEEL IT MAKES
[1:43:05] YOU FEEL BAD WHEN YOU DO SOMETHING
[1:43:06] AGAINST THE WORD. YES.
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; IF OUR HEART CONDEMN US, GOD IS GREATER
[1:43:11] THAN OUR HEART AND KNOWETH ALL THINGS.
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; HE KNOWS YOU'RE HIS CHILD. HE KNOWS
[1:43:16] YOU'RE YOU'RE THE ELECTED CHILDREN OF
[1:43:18] GOD.
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; BELOVED, if our heart condemnth not.
[1:43:23] Now, here we come. Remember, we're
[1:43:25] beloved in him.
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; We're in him. We're the beloved. He's
[1:43:30] greater than our heart. BUT IF OUR HEART
[1:43:32] CONDEMNTH NOT, then we have confidence
[1:43:36] toward God.
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; AND WHATSOEVER WE ASK, WE receive of
[1:43:42] him. Because I know you say, "Well, this
[1:43:45] is legalism." No, it isn't. It's virtue.
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; Do Do you want to HAVE SOMETHING TO
[1:43:50] GIVE? Then you need to have confidence
[1:43:53] in the atoning work of Christ first and
[1:43:57] then in what the atoning WORK OF CHRIST
[1:43:58] HAS DONE IN YOUR LIFE. and then you can
[1:44:01] begin to help somebody else.
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; He said, "Whatever we ask, we receive of
[1:44:07] him because we keep his commandments and
[1:44:10] do those things that are pleasing
[1:44:13] in his sight." I I think this morning as
[1:44:16] we kind of gear down now on what we want
[1:44:18] to talk about this morning and this
[1:44:20] virtue, we need to think on our ways.
[1:44:23] I played that that tape for my children
[1:44:26] this morning on the way. I was listening
[1:44:27] to it. already listened actually to
[1:44:29] brother Brandon preaches it three or
[1:44:30] four times and I listened to one of them
[1:44:32] and I listened to another one on the way
[1:44:33] to church and [snorts]
[1:44:34] part of it and in that sermon brother
[1:44:37] Brandham uses the text from Psalms 119 I
[1:44:40] thought on my ways and I turned my feet
[1:44:42] unto thy testimonies
[1:44:45] I thought on my ways brother Brandham
[1:44:46] deals with a sinner how they have to
[1:44:47] think on their ways then he deals with a
[1:44:48] church member he said or a person who's
[1:44:50] been saved and how we need to think on
[1:44:53] our ways
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; right and so it's not just for sinners
[1:44:56] but when we think on the Lord when we
[1:44:58] think of what we're doing,
[1:45:00] then then we turn our feet unto thy
[1:45:03] testimonies.
[1:45:05] So, Brother Brandham uses the
[1:45:07] illustration uh in one of those times
[1:45:09] that he preaches that sermon, he uses
[1:45:12] the illustration
[1:45:14] and from, you remember when uh he was in
[1:45:17] trouble with taxes and all it was is he
[1:45:20] had signed a bunch of checks and put
[1:45:21] them into the ministry because he had
[1:45:23] personally signed them. They charged him
[1:45:24] with a big chunk of money for taxes and
[1:45:27] he was upset about it. He ended up
[1:45:29] settling with the government and paying
[1:45:30] it off, working to pay it off. And he
[1:45:33] was so upset he almost quit preaching.
[1:45:34] It was just an awful time in his life
[1:45:36] cuz here he'd done everything he could
[1:45:37] to help people and give it all away and
[1:45:39] they come after him anyway.
[1:45:41] And he talked about how that the
[1:45:43] government was so corrupt and the
[1:45:44] tobacco companies and and all these
[1:45:46] people had all these lawyers to, you
[1:45:48] know, and they could spend all this
[1:45:49] money and not pay any taxes. And then
[1:45:51] they were charging preachers taxes,
[1:45:54] right? Who were helping people. He just
[1:45:56] had to do it differently. So he didn't
[1:45:58] get charged that. And so, Brother
[1:45:59] Brandon was going through that time in
[1:46:01] his ministry. And and he talked about a
[1:46:03] tax man that called. You all know the
[1:46:05] story. and and the tax man called and
[1:46:08] the tax man said uh or it was actually
[1:46:11] the attorney I believe brother
[1:46:13] Brandham's attorney but they they needed
[1:46:14] brother Brandham they talked to him
[1:46:16] about it and so the attorney called and
[1:46:19] he said I [snorts] I need to talk to
[1:46:21] brother Brandham and and and me goes
[1:46:24] Bill and
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; brother Brandham says tell him I'm not
[1:46:29] here as he stepped outside the door
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; right and I know some of us have done
[1:46:35] that Of
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; course, now we got caller ID and we
[1:46:38] don't have to, you know,
[1:46:43] &gt;&gt; just make them think we're not there,
[1:46:44] you know.
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; So, but he had caller I he didn't have
[1:46:49] that and back then he had she answered
[1:46:51] the phone and and so brother Brandon
[1:46:53] said, "I started out I got my hat and I
[1:46:56] went down to make a sick call."
[1:46:58] Now,
[1:47:00] the way God dealt with brother Brandham
[1:47:02] on this was sort of severe.
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; But I think it was to teach us a lesson.
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; I I really do believe that. And because
[1:47:10] brother Brandham had to live in a place,
[1:47:12] and let me just say this, if you've got
[1:47:14] if you got if God's got really something
[1:47:15] to do in your life, then he's got to get
[1:47:17] you to a place of maturity, maybe beyond
[1:47:19] others,
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; to get you a place where you can give
[1:47:21] out
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; and be a help. So here and that's why
[1:47:27] people who want to be prophets, who
[1:47:29] would want to be a prophet,
[1:47:31] right? Who would want to be a pro? Who
[1:47:32] would want that kind of that kind of
[1:47:34] responsibility?
[1:47:36] And I'd say that even about a pastor or
[1:47:38] something like that. Who would want
[1:47:39] that? They would wish that on themselves
[1:47:41] because you're responsible for people
[1:47:43] and for what you say. But the random was
[1:47:45] responsible to an age.
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; And he had great responsibility and God
[1:47:49] held him to that. And he said, "I start
[1:47:51] out, I got my hat, went down to make a
[1:47:52] sick call and went into the room to pray
[1:47:54] for a little sick baby. Man had been
[1:47:56] waiting a long time with this baby. I
[1:47:58] WENT IN TO PRAY FOR IT. WHEN I STARTED
[1:47:59] TO LAY MY HANDS ON IT, something said to
[1:48:01] me, "Can you lay your lying hands on
[1:48:05] that child?"
[1:48:09] Now, think about this. Brother Brandham
[1:48:10] had an advocate, did he not? Same one we
[1:48:12] do.
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; Right? That sin wasn't going to take him
[1:48:16] out of the kingdom.
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; He was covered.
[1:48:21] Are you with me?
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; We're covered.
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said it's having like
[1:48:25] having a license to speed. Did you know
[1:48:26] he said that?
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; He said it's like if you He said if the
[1:48:30] speed law doesn't apply to you, he said
[1:48:32] then you can go as fast as you want.
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; Right? And if you get stopped, you can
[1:48:36] tell the man. He said I it don't apply
[1:48:38] to me. I've been given permission by the
[1:48:39] mayor. Drive as fast as I can go. Right?
[1:48:42] So I can go as fast as I want. So that's
[1:48:44] the way a Christian is.
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; You can live however you want to. I'M SO
[1:48:48] GLAD HE PUT SOMETHING in me to want to
[1:48:50] live for God.
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; But yet, SO THAT WASN'T THAT THE SIN
[1:48:54] WASN'T COVERED, BUT WHAT WAS IT? IT WAS
[1:48:57] BROTHER BRANDHAM'S CONSCIENCE.
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; IT WAS BROTHER BRANDHAM'S OWN CONSCIENCE
[1:49:01] SAID, "CAN YOU LAY your lying hands on
[1:49:04] that child?"
[1:49:05] Just proved how close he lived to God.
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; Because most of us maybe wouldn't be
[1:49:10] bothered by that, but he was. And the
[1:49:12] Bible SAID IN 1 JOHN 3:21, "IF OUR
[1:49:14] HEARTS CONDEMN US NOT, THEN WE HAVE
[1:49:16] CONFIDENCE in God." HE SAID, "THAT'S
[1:49:18] WHAT'S THE MATTER TODAY THAT THE
[1:49:19] CHRISTIAN CHURCH CAN'T GET ANYTHING DONE
[1:49:22] IS BECAUSE OUR HEARTS ARE CONDEMNING US
[1:49:23] WITH UNCONFESSED SINS."
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; He said, "It's not easy for me to tell
[1:49:27] this, but it's the truth." He said,
[1:49:28] "That's the way to be truthful."
[1:49:31] I've told you the story, and I don't
[1:49:32] have time to tell it again today, but
[1:49:33] about the dove flying away. G get me to
[1:49:35] tell if you haven't heard it. Some of
[1:49:36] our folks are new, but when we were
[1:49:39] young and married couple, I got angry
[1:49:40] and slammed the door at something. And
[1:49:43] and when I did, I walked outside of our
[1:49:45] little place here right next to Sister
[1:49:47] Fritz here in West Plains. There was a
[1:49:48] dove sitting right there by by my door
[1:49:50] and it flew away AND MY HEART SMOKED ME.
[1:49:53] I went back in AND APOLOGIZED TO MY WIFE
[1:49:55] BECAUSE BROTHER BRANDON SAID THAT DOVE
[1:49:57] WOULD FLY AWAY WHEN WE GOT TO ACTING
[1:49:59] LIKE A WOLF.
[1:50:01] &gt;&gt; Anybody ever been there? Amen.
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandon said, I STARTED TO
[1:50:05] PRAY AGAIN. LISTEN, he tries TO JUST
[1:50:08] IGNORE THAT AND TRIED TO PRAY AGAIN. I
[1:50:10] SEEN I WASN'T FIT TO PUT MY HANDS on
[1:50:12] that baby. I SAID, "SIR, I WILL SEE THAT
[1:50:14] YOUR APPOINTMENT IS HELD. YOU JUST STAY
[1:50:16] HERE." I RUSHED TO THE PHONE, CALLED THE
[1:50:18] ATTORNEY. I SAID, "CAN I SPEAK TO YOU A
[1:50:20] MINUTE?" HE SAID, "SURE, BUT THE OTHER
[1:50:21] fellas are done gone." I SAID, "JUST
[1:50:22] STAY IN YOUR OFFICE A few minutes." I
[1:50:24] RUSHED DOWN THERE, WENT INTO the room. I
[1:50:25] SAID, "ATTORNEY, I WANT TO TELL YOU
[1:50:27] SOMETHING. WHEN YOU CALLED A LITTLE
[1:50:28] WHILE AGO, I WAS THERE." I said, "WHEN
[1:50:30] YOU CALLED, YOU HAD ME SO NERVOUS. I
[1:50:31] HARDLY KNEW WHAT I WAS DOING. I WAS
[1:50:33] ALMOST BESIDE MYSELF. I SAID, I HAD MY
[1:50:35] WIFE TO ANSWER LIKE THAT, BUT IT WAS A
[1:50:36] LIE AND I LIED TO YOU AND I CAUSED MY
[1:50:38] WIFE TO LIE. He said, "Well, you wasn't
[1:50:40] in there just then, Billy." She said,
[1:50:42] "You wasn't?" I said, "I wasn't, but I
[1:50:43] run out of the house and run behind the
[1:50:44] house to keep from being in there." I
[1:50:46] said, "It's a lie." Anyhow, I said,
[1:50:48] "Will you forgive me for it?" Walked
[1:50:50] across the floor, looked me right
[1:50:51] straight in the eye. I could see in his
[1:50:52] gray eyes little tears BEGIN TO FORM. HE
[1:50:54] TOOK ME BY THE hand and hugged me. HE
[1:50:56] SAID, "BROTHER BRANDON, I'VE HAD GREAT
[1:50:57] CONFIDENCE IN YOU, BUT I GOT MORE THAN
[1:50:59] EVER NOW." WHY? WHEN WE THINK ON OUR
[1:51:01] WAYS. I WENT AND PRAYED FOR THE BABY.
[1:51:03] WHAT WAS THAT? HE HAD VIRTUE NOW TO GIVE
[1:51:05] CUZ HIS HEART WASN'T IN CONDEMNATION.
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; YES, WE HAVE FREEDOM IN CHRIST. YES,
[1:51:10] WE'RE DELIVERED FROM SIN. YES, WE DON'T
[1:51:12] HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT LIVING SOME KIND OF
[1:51:14] LEGALISTIC LIFE, BUT WE WANT TO BE SO
[1:51:16] CLOSE TO HIM BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT OUR
[1:51:18] HEART CONDEMNING US. SOMEDAY IT'LL BE
[1:51:20] OUR CHILDREN THAT NEED PRAYER. SOMEDAY
[1:51:22] YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO REACH THE PASTOR.
[1:51:24] SOMEDAY YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO REACH THE
[1:51:25] ASSOCIATE OR SOMEBODY ELSE. SOMEDAY
[1:51:27] YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO LAY YOUR HANDS
[1:51:28] ON SOMEBODY AND EXPECT THAT PRAYER to be
[1:51:30] he be be met.
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; HOW YOU GOING TO GET TO THAT PLACE, LIVE
[1:51:34] A LIFE THAT'S HOLY BEFORE GOD.
[1:51:39] &gt;&gt; Something comes up, just repent of it
[1:51:40] and let it
[1:51:41] &gt;&gt; let it go and move forward.
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; Make it right if you can.
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; That's why the disciples couldn't heal
[1:51:50] the epileptic child.
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; The Brown said they didn't have
[1:51:53] confidence in who they were.
[1:51:58] Brother Brandon [snorts] said, "Remember
[1:51:59] they had the word and the word was
[1:52:00] fleshed in. The word told them, I give
[1:52:02] you power and they had the power, but
[1:52:05] they didn't have faith to operate the
[1:52:06] word that was in them. But Jesus had it.
[1:52:09] He was the word and he had faith that
[1:52:10] what he said would happen." He said,
[1:52:11] "Oh, bring him here. How long will I
[1:52:14] suffer you?" He had faith with his
[1:52:16] power. How did he? He said, "I can't do
[1:52:18] nothing in myself." Why? He relied upon
[1:52:20] what he was. He relied in knowing that
[1:52:22] he was the word. So that's primarily
[1:52:26] church. Even beyond how we live, we need
[1:52:28] to rely on who we are,
[1:52:30] &gt;&gt; right? And how we live is just an
[1:52:31] evidence of who we are.
[1:52:34] [snorts] But he had faith in God who
[1:52:36] made him the word. He was God the word
[1:52:38] and they was in him. That gave him faith
[1:52:40] because he understood his position. He
[1:52:42] knew what he was because the scripture
[1:52:44] had said he was this. And here every
[1:52:47] scripture tied in to prove he was
[1:52:48] exactly what the scripture said he would
[1:52:50] be. And he knew what he was. Therefore,
[1:52:53] he relied upon what God had made him.
[1:52:55] And if he did that, then can't we rely
[1:52:57] upon what God made us
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; as believers.
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; THESE SIGNS SHALL FOLLOW THEM.
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; Someone say them.
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; That believe.
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; He had faith in what he was.
[1:53:11] &gt;&gt; And if you are a believer, YOU HAVE
[1:53:13] FAITH IN WHAT YOU ARE. YOU'RE a
[1:53:14] believer. And if you got FAITH IN GOD,
[1:53:16] THE BIBLE SAYS IF OUR HEARTS CONDEMN US,
[1:53:18] THEN WE CAN'T HAVE FAITH. BUT IF OUR
[1:53:19] HEARTS DON'T CONDEMN US, THEN WE HAVE
[1:53:21] FAITH. HAVE CONFIDENCE TOWARDS GOD. BUT
[1:53:22] AS LONG AS YOU'RE DOING THINGS THAT'S
[1:53:24] WRONG, YOU CAN'T HAVE CONFIDENCE TOWARDS
[1:53:26] GOD. SO, SEE, YOU'LL AUTOMATICALLY KNOW
[1:53:28] THAT YOU'RE WRONG. YOU CAN TELL YOURSELF
[1:53:30] YOU'RE RIGHT. TELL YOURSELF IT'S OKAY.
[1:53:33] TELL YOURSELF IT'S NO PROBLEM ALL YOU
[1:53:35] WANT TO, BUT ON THE INSIDE, YOUR INNER
[1:53:37] MAN KNOWS THAT IT'S WRONG.
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; Don't violate that. Listen, I don't
[1:53:44] preach legalism. You all know that.
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; I don't do that. I don't harp on how our
[1:53:49] sisters DRESS OR HOW HOW PEOPLE DO
[1:53:51] THINGS. BUT LISTEN, YOUR HEART KNOWS.
[1:53:55] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; You wear that AND AND YOU KNOW THAT IT'S
[1:53:58] WRONG. EVEN OUR young people, my own
[1:54:01] daughters AND THOSE AND THEY KNOW when
[1:54:03] there's something, they know some of
[1:54:06] y'all got daughters old enough to know
[1:54:07] this. And I I say daughters, not to
[1:54:09] single one out, but [snorts]
[1:54:11] but you get daughters that are old
[1:54:12] enough, you know, and they'll come out
[1:54:14] on Sunday morning. Maybe y'all don't
[1:54:16] watch your children's dress this
[1:54:17] closely. maybe they haven't reached that
[1:54:18] age, but I do I'm not legalistic, but I
[1:54:21] don't want them going out in a way that
[1:54:22] would be embarrassing to them or to me.
[1:54:25] And so, I watch them and and I always
[1:54:27] compliment them when they're dressed
[1:54:28] nicely, you know, and if they come out
[1:54:30] and they're see-through shirt or
[1:54:32] something like that, and I don't have
[1:54:34] that problem very often, but I, you
[1:54:36] know, I'll say something to them, you
[1:54:38] need to put something under that, you
[1:54:40] need to change that, and you need to fix
[1:54:41] that.
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; We're going to the house of God or we're
[1:54:44] even going to town,
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; right? we we need to fix that. And so
[1:54:48] I've done that. But if you ever notice
[1:54:50] that kid even knows
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; because they'll try to slip around me,
[1:54:54] you know,
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; they don't want to be seen when they're
[1:55:01] in that condition. I don't have to tell
[1:55:03] you. Listen, your heart.
[1:55:07] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? It knows.
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; It knows.
[1:55:12] I believe that many of us are Christians
[1:55:13] this morning. And I believe there's a
[1:55:15] time to preach those things and we will
[1:55:17] and we have dealt with those things but
[1:55:19] your heart knows.
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; If your heart condemns you, just don't
[1:55:24] do it.
[1:55:27] [snorts]
[1:55:27] &gt;&gt; Are you with me this morning?
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; You put that cigarette in your mouth and
[1:55:31] you think every time you're destroying
[1:55:33] your confidence towards God,
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; huh? I don't condemn you. Do you
[1:55:37] realize, Brother Brandon baptized people
[1:55:39] who smoke cigarettes?
[1:55:41] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:55:42] &gt;&gt; Sure he did.
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah. I'll pray for people that smoke
[1:55:46] and and and and can't get kick that
[1:55:48] habit. Some of y'all had habits you
[1:55:50] couldn't kick all the at the first and
[1:55:52] &gt;&gt; you had to overcome things.
[1:55:55] &gt;&gt; And that person can be saved even. But
[1:55:56] God will deliver you of that if you let
[1:55:58] him.
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; But what you're doing IF YOU'RE NOT
[1:56:02] CAREFUL IS YOU YOU smoke and then it's
[1:56:04] it's giving condemnation to your heart.
[1:56:06] You get to a place where you don't have
[1:56:07] any strength in YOUR LIFE AND NO VIRTUE
[1:56:09] TO EVEN OVERCOME YOURSELF MUCH LESS GIVE
[1:56:10] TO ANYBODY ELSE. AND WHAT IS IT? If you
[1:56:13] LAY THAT THING DOWN, IF YOU GIVE IT TO
[1:56:15] JESUS, YOU BUT I CAN'T. BROTHER BEN, WHY
[1:56:16] DON'T YOU COME AND TRY THE ALTAR ONCE IN
[1:56:18] A WHILE AND SEE IF GOD WON'T TAKE THAT
[1:56:20] THING FROM YOU, DELIVER YOU OF that
[1:56:22] thing.
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; He said, if you know you're wrong,
[1:56:29] he said, [snorts] you automatically know
[1:56:30] that you're wrong, you automatically put
[1:56:32] yourself back there a sinner. You might
[1:56:34] be saved,
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; but because you're doing something, you
[1:56:37] know it's not right. So you
[1:56:40] automatically know that you're wrong.
[1:56:42] And so you put yourself as a sinner.
[1:56:46] But when your heart don't condemn you,
[1:56:50] when your heart don't condemn you.
[1:56:54] You see the difference? Look, brother
[1:56:56] Trip, excuse me for using you, but you
[1:56:58] had a wreck on the way home from church
[1:57:00] here a while back.
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; Could have died. God spared him. Amen.
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; You remember in that service we prayed
[1:57:06] before our young people left to protect
[1:57:08] our young I didn't know what I was
[1:57:09] praying and God protected brother Trip.
[1:57:11] I believe that with all of my heart.
[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; He's alive today cuz God protected him.
[1:57:18] &gt;&gt; But how much confidence could you have
[1:57:19] if you're leaving a bar?
[1:57:23] &gt;&gt; Come on church.
[1:57:25] &gt;&gt; This is for our good. I'm not trying to
[1:57:26] scold you. HOW MUCH CONFIDENCE COULD YOU
[1:57:28] HAVE IF YOU JUST WATCH THIS R-RATED
[1:57:30] MOVIE AND somebody calls for prayer?
[1:57:35] How do you have that CONFIDENCE TO BE
[1:57:37] ABLE TO TALK TO SOMEBODY? LISTEN, you're
[1:57:39] still a believer. Are you with me now?
[1:57:42] You're still, if you've ever been a
[1:57:43] believer, if you've EVER GIVEN YOUR
[1:57:44] HEART clear all the way to God, YOU'RE
[1:57:46] STILL THAT WAY. YOU DIDN'T SUDDENLY NOT
[1:57:49] BECOME A CHRISTIAN, BUT YOU NEED TO
[1:57:51] THINK ON YOUR WAYS.
[1:57:52] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:57:53] &gt;&gt; SO THAT YOU HAVE VIRTUE TO GIVE OUT TO
[1:57:55] SOMEBODY ELSE. LORD, help me to be that
[1:57:57] way.
[1:57:59] &gt;&gt; See, WE AUTOMATICALLY PUT OURSELVES BACK
[1:58:00] THROUGH A CENTER BY KNOWING THAT YOU'RE
[1:58:01] WRONG. BUT WHEN YOUR HEART DON'T CONDEMN
[1:58:03] YOU AND YOU KNOW YOU'RE a believer and
[1:58:04] there's nothing between you and God, YOU
[1:58:06] CAN ASK WHAT YOU WILL AND KNOW THAT
[1:58:08] IT'LL BE GIVEN BECAUSE IT'S THE WORD
[1:58:09] THAT'S GIVEN TO YOU JUST LIKE IT WAS TO
[1:58:11] THOSE DISCIPLES. HE SAID THE ONLY THING
[1:58:14] YOU HAVE TO DO THEN IS HAVE FAITH IN
[1:58:16] WHAT YOU ARE. HAVE FAITH IN WHAT THE
[1:58:17] WORD SAYS. WHAT BROTHER BRANDON TELL THE
[1:58:19] PEOPLE WHO COME UP FOR PRAYER. HE SAID
[1:58:21] FIRST IF THERE'S ANY UNCONFESSED SIN, HE
[1:58:23] SAID YOU MAKE THAT RIGHT. YOU YOU PRAY
[1:58:25] TO GOD. HOW LONG DOES THAT TAKE, BROTHER
[1:58:27] BEN? JUST A SECOND. A MOMENT. IT JUST
[1:58:29] TAKES A MOMENT IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD TO
[1:58:31] RELEASE YOU FROM ALL OF THAT. HE SAID,
[1:58:32] "MAKE THAT RIGHT AND THEN COME IN FAITH,
[1:58:34] CONFIDENCE, BELIEVING WHAT God's done
[1:58:37] for you.
[1:58:38] &gt;&gt; You don't HAVE TO HOLD YOURSELF HOSTAGE
[1:58:39] TO THE SINS OF THE PAST. LET IT GO. LIVE
[1:58:42] A DIFFERENT LIFE. LET WALK IN THE
[1:58:44] SPIRIT."
[1:58:45] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THE BIBLE SAYS, "THERE IS
[1:58:47] THEREFORE NOW NO CONDEMNATION TO THEM
[1:58:49] WHICH ARE IN CHRIST JESUS, WHO WALK NOT
[1:58:51] [screaming] AFTER THE FLESH, BUT AFTER
[1:58:53] THE SPIRIT." HE SAID in Galatians 5:16,
[1:58:55] "THIS I SAY THEN, WALK IN THE SPIRIT AND
[1:58:57] YOU SHALL NOT FULFILL THE LUST OF THE
[1:58:59] FLESH."
[1:59:02] &gt;&gt; This virtue has to come from within. It
[1:59:04] can't be put on.
[1:59:06] [snorts] Jesus said, "Consider the
[1:59:08] lily."
[1:59:09] I want to
[1:59:12] fast forward past the quote on this, but
[1:59:14] brother Brandham talked about the lily
[1:59:17] [snorts]
[1:59:18] and he talked about how it had something
[1:59:20] to give out. He called it an unselfish
[1:59:23] odor.
[1:59:25] Unselfish odor.
[1:59:28] He has it. Before he can give out honey,
[1:59:31] he has to have it.
[1:59:33] &gt;&gt; And so what does the lily do? It comes
[1:59:35] through trials. Comes through the muck.
[1:59:37] Are you still with me this morning? I'm
[1:59:38] about to close.
[1:59:39] &gt;&gt; It comes through the muck and the mire
[1:59:42] and the darkness and the gloom of the
[1:59:45] earth. We all come through that those
[1:59:47] stages and the lily begins to press its
[1:59:50] way towards the light,
[1:59:52] &gt;&gt; right? It begins to press its way. How
[1:59:54] many are pressing their way this
[1:59:55] morning? You begin to press your way
[1:59:57] toward the light. Little lily, all that
[1:59:59] would it would ever be was in the seed.
[2:00:02] But it's got a purpose. It's got to
[2:00:04] serve the purpose of God. And so it
[2:00:06] pushes its way up to the muddy bottom of
[2:00:08] the pond. Pushes its way up through the
[2:00:10] dark waters, to the brighter waters, up
[2:00:12] into the sunlight. And when it gets UP
[2:00:15] IN THE SUNLIGHT, IT COULD BE OF HELP to
[2:00:17] somebody. And brother Brandon says
[2:00:19] before YOU CAN GIVE OUT VIRTUE, YOU HAVE
[2:00:21] TO HAVE IT. THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TO PREACH
[2:00:24] FAITH. WHERE FAITH IS PREACHED FROM THE
[2:00:25] WORD THAT CHILDREN LIVE BECAUSE YOU GOT
[2:00:27] TO HAVE FAITH TO BELIEVE. WE GOT TO
[2:00:30] PREACH THE WORD BECAUSE YOU GOT TO HAVE
[2:00:31] THE WORD TO BE ABLE TO HELP SOMEBODY
[2:00:33] WITH THE WORD.
[2:00:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:00:35] &gt;&gt; Many times virtue comes through trials.
[2:00:37] So [snorts] Job one time wanted to talk
[2:00:40] to God and he talked to him like this.
[2:00:43] He said, "Lord," he said, "if I could
[2:00:45] just find God."
[2:00:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:00:47] &gt;&gt; You ever been like that? You've gone
[2:00:48] through a trial, maybe you've been sick,
[2:00:49] and if I COULD JUST FIND HIM,
[2:00:52] &gt;&gt; he said, "I'd go to his throne room." I
[2:00:55] SIT DOWN IN FRONT OF HIM AND I'D TALK TO
[2:00:56] HIM. AND HE SAYS THIS. HE SAID, "WOULD
[2:00:59] HE USE HIS GREAT strength against me?"
[2:01:02] He said, "No." He said, "He wouldn't USE
[2:01:04] HIS GREAT POWER." HE SAID, "BUT HE WOULD
[2:01:05] PUT STRENGTH IN ME." Will he plead
[2:01:07] against me with his GREAT POWER? NO. HE
[2:01:09] WOULD PUT STRENGTH IN ME IF I COULD FIND
[2:01:12] HIM. HE WOULD GIVE ME VIRTUE. OH, HOW WE
[2:01:14] NEED TO BE IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD EVERY
[2:01:16] MOMENT OF OUR LIVES. HOW WE NEED TO
[2:01:18] DWELL IN HIS PRESENCE. COME ON, CHURCH.
[2:01:21] DAVID SAID, "I WANT TO DWELL IN THE
[2:01:22] PRESENCE OF THE ALMIGHTY. I WANT TO LIVE
[2:01:24] A [screaming] LIFE THAT'S HOLY BEFORE
[2:01:26] GOD. I WANT TO LIVE LIKE I'M LIVING IN
[2:01:28] THE TEMPLE. I WANT TO BE IN THE HOUSE OF
[2:01:30] GOD EVERY TIME I GET A CHANCE TO. I WANT
[2:01:32] TO LIVE FOR GOD EVERY EVERY MOMENT THAT
[2:01:33] I CAN. I WANT TO PRESS INTO THE KINGDOM
[2:01:35] OF GOD. WHY? NOT BECAUSE I I'M NOT
[2:01:37] SAVED. KNOW I AM SAVED. THAT'S WHAT
[2:01:39] MAKES ME WANT TO DO IT. I WANT TO BE A
[2:01:41] GIVE WHAT THAT VIRTUE THAT I HAVE TO
[2:01:44] somebody else.
[2:01:46] &gt;&gt; He put strength in us.
[2:01:49] Brother said he may commit you to death
[2:01:50] as he did Paul. He may commit you to
[2:01:52] suffering as he did Job. That's his
[2:01:54] priority. He's sovereign, but it's with
[2:01:56] a purpose. If he didn't have a purpose,
[2:01:57] he'd be the author of frustration, not
[2:01:59] of peace.
[2:02:00] &gt;&gt; His purpose is that after we have
[2:02:02] suffered a while,
[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; yes,
[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; we would be made [clears throat]
[2:02:05] perfect.
[2:02:08] Jesus growing up from a child
[2:02:13] to our redeemer cross.
[2:02:17] He was actually made perfect by the
[2:02:20] things that he suffered.
[2:02:23] I want to ask you this this morning. If
[2:02:24] he became the stature of a perfect man,
[2:02:27] a manifested son, what would a
[2:02:29] manifested son look like? It look like
[2:02:30] him
[2:02:32] filled with virtue to give a dying
[2:02:34] world. If he did that by suffering,
[2:02:38] how will we get it any other way?
[2:02:41] &gt;&gt; Let's go back to our original scripture.
[2:02:43] As the musicians come, for I reckon
[2:02:45] that the sufferings of this present
[2:02:49] time.
[2:02:52] I want you to think about this for a
[2:02:53] moment. the sufferings, how difficult it
[2:02:56] is to get to church sometimes, and
[2:02:59] how much pain you've gone through,
[2:03:04] people did wrong to you. God just let
[2:03:06] him do it.
[2:03:10] Cheated you, lied on you, he just let
[2:03:12] him do it. He stood by
[2:03:14] because he's doing something for you.
[2:03:19] He He You go through sickness.
[2:03:22] Some of you all uh I I get
[2:03:27] proud of you at times because I I start
[2:03:30] thinking, you know, I could you couldn't
[2:03:31] hardly tell. I know some how sick some
[2:03:33] of y'all are sometimes how how you feel
[2:03:35] and I know because you've told me
[2:03:38] and yet you still have a smile in the
[2:03:40] house of God and still worship the Lord.
[2:03:43] And I think, oh God, what is he doing?
[2:03:47] There's virtue in you.
[2:03:49] But God's doing something in your life.
[2:03:51] if you may stand by for a moment
[2:03:54] because he said I reckon that the
[2:03:55] sufferings you put whatever you're going
[2:03:57] through in that of this present time are
[2:04:01] not worthy brother Cochran to be
[2:04:02] compared with the glory
[2:04:08] THE SUFFERING SAID GOD WHY DIDN'T YOU
[2:04:10] HEAL ME BROTHER BRANDHAM EVEN HAD THE
[2:04:12] QUESTION Lord why would you heal me now
[2:04:14] I suffered all these years he suffered
[2:04:16] with his stomach all them years his
[2:04:17] nerves he said why would you heal me NOW
[2:04:20] HE TOOK HIM OFF THE EARTH, BUT HE WAS
[2:04:22] SHOWING HIM SOMETHING. HE WAS MATURING
[2:04:23] HIM. He was growing him, MAKING
[2:04:26] SOMETHING OUT of him.
[2:04:28] The suffering is NOT WORTHY TO BE
[2:04:30] COMPARED WITH THE GLORY WHICH SHALL BE
[2:04:32] REVEALED IN US.
[2:04:35] For the earnest EXPECTATION OF THE WHOLE
[2:04:38] EARTH, THE CREATION waiteth for the
[2:04:41] manifestation
[2:04:42] of the sons of God.
[2:04:47] What did Jesus do when he come to the
[2:04:48] earth? HE GAVE ALL OF HIS STRENGTH.
[2:04:50] THAT'S WHAT THAT HE SAID VIRTUE. BROTHER
[2:04:52] said he got weak.
[2:04:58] He gave ALL OF HIS SUPERNATURAL strength
[2:05:02] for one woman who touched the hymn of
[2:05:04] his garment.
[2:05:06] We can't give what we don't have.
[2:05:09] Let's draw from him today. He's still
[2:05:11] the great high priest. He's the one who
[2:05:13] can WALK THROUGH AND CLEANSE THE WOMAN.
[2:05:16] AMEN. ONLY THE HIGH PRIEST COULD DO
[2:05:18] THAT. We just heard that the other day.
[2:05:20] BROTHER WAYNE LAWSON PREACHED A SERMON
[2:05:22] ON THE GREAT HIGH PRIEST AND HE TALKED
[2:05:23] ABOUT HOW ONLY THE HIGH PRIEST COULD
[2:05:25] HEAL A WOMAN IN THAT CONDITION. COULD
[2:05:28] PRONOUNCE HER CLEAN.
[2:05:30] Only the high priest, HE IS A GREAT HIGH
[2:05:33] PRIEST WHO COULD BE TOUCHED BY THE
[2:05:35] FEELING OF OUR INFIRMITIES. LET'S DRAW
[2:05:38] FROM HIM THIS MORNING. LET'S REPENT OF
[2:05:40] OUR SINS. LET'S GET RID OF ANYTHING THAT
[2:05:42] WOULD HOLD US BACK FROM THE THINGS OF
[2:05:43] GOD. LET'S BE QUICKENED OVER AND OVER
[2:05:46] AND OVER AGAIN UNTIL WE REACH A PLACE
[2:05:48] WHERE WE CAN START HELPING SOMEBODY
[2:05:49] ELSE. THERE WILL COME A DAY, BROTHER
[2:05:51] JAMES, WHEN YOU CAN HELP SOMEBODY. THERE
[2:05:53] WILL COME A DAY WHEN YOU CAN GIVE OUT.
[2:05:56] WHY DON'T YOU DRAW IN RIGHT NOW? DRAW IN
[2:05:58] WHILE YOU'RE IN THE HOUSE OF GOD CUZ
[2:05:59] THERE WILL COME A TIME YOU WHEN THE
[2:06:01] WORLD NEEDS YOU.
[2:06:03] &gt;&gt; YES.
[2:06:03] &gt;&gt; WHEN YOUR FAMILY NEEDS YOU.
[2:06:06] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:06:08] OH, let's be ready.
[2:06:12] said, "But brother Ben, he's not using
[2:06:14] me. Maybe he's building up that virtue
[2:06:16] in you for the sake of one
[2:06:20] for the sake of one lost soul. Maybe
[2:06:23] that LOST SOUL BE THE last one."
[2:06:27] You say, "Brother Ben, why do you do
[2:06:29] what you do?" We travel AROUND THE WORLD
[2:06:31] PREACHING THE GOSPEL WHEN we can. And I
[2:06:33] appreciate y'all making time for us to
[2:06:35] do that. Brother Joel goes and I go, and
[2:06:37] brother Stewart goes and we work here
[2:06:39] and YET WE GO. AND WHAT ARE WE DOING?
[2:06:41] TRYING TO BUILD STRENGTH IN OTHER
[2:06:42] PEOPLE. LISTEN, CHURCH, IT'S NOT JUST
[2:06:45] ABOUT US.
[2:06:47] If we have a little strength, let's give
[2:06:50] it to somebody. Let's be like the lily.
[2:06:54] While we have this opportunity, we don't
[2:06:56] know how many services everybody wants
[2:06:58] to rush out of the building, but I'm
[2:07:00] not. It's just in general our culture.
[2:07:02] We're just ready to go.
[2:07:04] Yeah. What if he could put a little
[2:07:05] virtue in you if you just waited a
[2:07:07] moment and and Lord, forgive me of my
[2:07:10] sins.
[2:07:12] Wash me again in your blood. [laughter]
[2:07:14] CLEANSE ME FROM ALL UNRIGHTEOUSNESS.
[2:07:16] SEARCH MY HEART. If I've done anything
[2:07:19] that would make it WHERE MY CONSCIENCE
[2:07:21] WOULD AFFECT ME AND I WOULDN'T BE ABLE
[2:07:22] TO PRAY FOR SOMEBODY, TAKE IT OUT OF ME,
[2:07:24] LORD,
[2:07:26] so you could come and make a difference
[2:07:30] in my life. Some of y'all have family
[2:07:31] that's broken and destroyed by sin. And
[2:07:35] maybe you're the only one even COMING TO
[2:07:36] CHURCH OR SERVING GOD. LET HIM PUT
[2:07:38] VIRTUE IN YOU FOR YOUR FAMILY. LET HIM
[2:07:40] PUT VIRTUE IN YOU FOR YOUR CHURCH.
[2:07:43] Oh God, feel his presence here this
[2:07:46] morning. Let's just bow our heads.
[2:07:49] Hallelujah.
[2:07:51] I think every minister has felt that. I
[2:07:53] felt that myself many times praying for
[2:07:55] someone and their faith just draws the
[2:07:57] strength right out of you. Lord, help me
[2:07:59] have the strength, the spiritual
[2:08:01] strength to be able to give that.
[2:08:05] I wonder if we could all pray that way
[2:08:08] with every head bowed and every eye
[2:08:09] closed. Maybe you'd like to just slip up
[2:08:10] a hand to him and say, "Lord, I want
[2:08:12] that kind of virtue. Help me to receive
[2:08:15] so I can give. Help me. Help me, Lord. I
[2:08:19] want to not JUST BE A TAKER. I want to
[2:08:21] be a giver. I want to be a help. I have
[2:08:23] a purpose in life." Oh, granny Lord. Oh,
[2:08:27] my hands are up to. I [laughter] I want
[2:08:29] to be like the lily.
[2:08:31] Oh, brother Rams, there's a type of a
[2:08:33] pastor. I want to be somebody who people
[2:08:36] could draw on.
[2:08:38] Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, I pray
[2:08:41] you'd help us today. Lord, may we not
[2:08:44] spend all of our time worried about what
[2:08:46] somebody else is doing, but us, Lord.
[2:08:48] It's me, OH LORD, STANDING in the need
[2:08:50] of prayer. Oh God, may we may you may
[2:08:53] you put strength in us, oh Lord, in our
[2:08:55] families, oh God, so we can be a
[2:08:58] strength to others. If our hearts
[2:09:00] condemn us, Lord, that we we Lord,
[2:09:04] repent today. And we ask your mercy.
[2:09:08] Forgive us of every sin. Forgive us of
[2:09:10] every shortcoming, Lord. Lord, WE'RE NOT
[2:09:13] SINNERS. WE KNOW WE'VE BEEN SAVED BY THE
[2:09:15] BLOOD, BUT LORD, THERE'S MANY THINGS
[2:09:16] THAT WE DO maybe that are wrong, Lord,
[2:09:18] and we don't mean to do it, OH GOD. BUT
[2:09:20] MAY WE COME CLOSE TO YOUR THRONE. MAY WE
[2:09:23] LIVE RIGHT CLOSE TO YOU, LORD, FOR THE
[2:09:25] SAKE OF YOUR PEOPLE. FOR THE SAKE OF OUR
[2:09:27] CHILDREN, FOR THE SAKE OF ONE ANOTHER,
[2:09:29] LORD. So I pray you'd grant it, Lord.
[2:09:32] Take all the bitterness and the strife
[2:09:34] and the fighting and the fussing. Take
[2:09:35] it away from us, God. Oh God, I pray
[2:09:39] you'd grant it today. Take away all the
[2:09:42] sin, all the besetting sin, Lord. All
[2:09:45] the uncleanness, all the unclean
[2:09:47] thoughts, all the unclean words and
[2:09:49] deeds. Oh God, take it away from us
[2:09:51] today.
[2:09:53] Let us be helpful. Let us be a virtue
[2:09:57] giver. I pray you'd grant it today in
[2:10:00] Jesus name.
[2:10:03] Hallelujah.
[2:10:05] Hallelujah. Could we sing this? Search
[2:10:07] me oh God.
[2:10:09] Oh Jesus.
[2:10:10] &gt;&gt; Search [singing]
[2:10:12] [music] me,
[2:10:15] &gt;&gt; oh God. [singing]
[2:10:17] The altar's open. If you need to come
[2:10:18] and pray, [music]
[2:10:20] you just talk to the Lord now before we
[2:10:21] close.
[2:10:23] [singing]
[2:10:24] &gt;&gt; My heart
[2:10:27] [music and singing]
[2:10:30] Lord. Oh.

[2:10:37] Hallelujah.
[2:10:38] &gt;&gt; Oh.
[2:10:41] [singing]
[2:10:43] Oh, Lord. No
[2:10:46] my [music] if anyone else needs prayer
[2:10:48] you're welcome to come. I pray
[2:10:59] [singing]
[2:11:00] there be
[2:11:06] some wicked
[2:11:09] wicked way
[2:11:12] in me. [singing]
[2:11:18] right now.
[2:11:18] &gt;&gt; Cleanse
[2:11:21] me
[2:11:23] from [singing] every
[2:11:27] sin
[2:11:29] and set
[2:11:32] me
[2:11:35] free.
[2:11:37] [singing and music]
[2:11:40] Oh, I
[2:11:44] praise
[2:11:46] thee, [singing and music]
[2:11:47] Lord,
[2:11:51] for [singing and music] cleansing
[2:11:55] me
[2:11:57] from [singing and music] sin.
[2:12:04] &gt;&gt; [singing]
[2:12:06] &gt;&gt; Fulfill
[2:12:08] thy word
[2:12:11] [music]

[2:12:26] Oh, fill [singing]
[2:12:29] me
[2:12:31] with fire.

[2:13:11] Oh Lord, [singing]

[2:13:25] it holy. [singing]

[2:13:53] [singing]
[2:13:56] Oh, take
