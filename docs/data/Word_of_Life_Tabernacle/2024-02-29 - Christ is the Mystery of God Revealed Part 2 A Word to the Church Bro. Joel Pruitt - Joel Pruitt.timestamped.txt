[46:25] anyway way and he said when the
[46:26] preaching started going forth he said I
[46:28] just started he said I got so blessed
[46:30] and he said then I started feeling
[46:31] better and he and uh I I want to say
[46:34] that it's wonderful when you see
[46:35] somebody that just makes an effort like
[46:37] that and then you see God come down and
[46:39] bless them for making the effort and so
[46:41] I believe God will do that for us
[46:42] tonight don't you it doesn't matter
[46:44] really who standing here so much I know
[46:46] you'd rather have your pastor I would
[46:47] too and it' be a whole lot easier on me
[46:50] and and I'd enjoy it a whole lot more
[46:51] but uh but we want to keep that family
[46:54] in prayer as well uh for sister
[46:55] Britney's family and they're doing the
[46:57] burial tomorrow down in Mississippi so
[46:59] continue to remember them if you have
[47:01] your Bibles Colossians chapter 1 and I'm
[47:03] doing something a little different
[47:04] tonight I've asked my brother to show me
[47:06] how to do PowerPoint and he has and uh
[47:10] that could be a bad thing so you just
[47:12] bear with me
[47:13] tonight uh try something new on y'all
[47:16] how about that I'd like to deal with uh
[47:20] actually a part two of something a part
[47:22] of the sermon that he's been dealing
[47:23] with that Christ is the mystery and so
[47:26] uh we're going to steal some of that and
[47:27] if I mess it up he'll come back next
[47:28] week and correct me on it um but
[47:31] Colossians chapter 1:8 just before
[47:32] you're seated and he is the head of the
[47:34] body the church who is the beginning the
[47:37] firstborn from the dead that in all
[47:40] things he might have the preeminence and
[47:43] you may be seated may the Lord add his
[47:44] Blessing to the reading of the word if
[47:46] you give me just a little more monitor
[47:48] that'd be good not not too much not to
[47:50] squeal just a little more amen now
[47:53] brother Brandon in this message how
[47:55] many's heard Christ is the mystery
[47:56] recently I know some of you have if you
[47:58] get a chance go listen to it it is a
[48:00] long sermon it's just a few seconds
[48:02] short of 4 hours um so I don't expect
[48:05] you to go home tonight and listen to it
[48:07] um but if you get a chance to go listen
[48:08] to that message maybe if you can do it
[48:10] in Parts it it is a wonderful wonderful
[48:14] message that brother Brandon brings to
[48:15] the people and he's getting ready to go
[48:17] away and he's going to go uh for for a
[48:20] length of time I think he says on there
[48:22] that it may be months before he's back
[48:23] to preach for the Tabernacle and so he's
[48:25] trying to give him a whole lot at once
[48:27] because he's not going to be there for a
[48:29] while and brother brandom's talking
[48:32] there to the people and he's really
[48:35] given brother Neville uh a good word
[48:38] there he's trying to tell the people you
[48:40] know you respect your pastor and love
[48:42] your pastor because God placed him there
[48:45] uh brother brandham could have chosen a
[48:46] lot of men but he chose brother Neville
[48:49] and uh and and he did that for a reason
[48:51] you know I don't believe God uh would
[48:53] have let him choose someone that would
[48:54] have been wrong the wrong man for the
[48:56] job just like I don't believe he lets I
[48:58] don't believe God chooses the wrong
[48:59] people to be in the bride I don't
[49:00] believe he chooses I just don't believe
[49:02] God's wrong how about you and so we
[49:04] believe what he says and what he does
[49:06] and and so uh in that situation brother
[49:09] brandham goes on to talk about brother
[49:11] Neville here and uh and and it's
[49:14] paragraph 77 there and I want you to
[49:16] remember that brother Neville here left
[49:18] in this church in the church in the
[49:20] charge of this Tabernacle under the holy
[49:22] spirit that he has left here and he
[49:24] believes this message and teaches it
[49:26] just the same as I do now there are
[49:29] people out there today who doesn't
[49:30] believe a minister should preach but
[49:32] here is brother brandom saying that
[49:33] brother Neville would would would teach
[49:35] it uh just like he did and so uh he
[49:39] didn't say he's going to when I leave
[49:40] here he's going to take this tape and
[49:42] break it down and just give you give you
[49:43] an hour every Sunday or an hour you know
[49:46] 30 minutes every service until I get
[49:48] back no he actually PR brother Neville
[49:50] in position to preach the word and so
[49:53] you understand when there's a spirit
[49:54] that comes among you that says that we
[49:56] don't need preachers anymore that did
[49:57] not come from the message how many knows
[49:59] that to be true that didn't come from
[50:01] the message that is uh that is some
[50:03] other Spirit that's tried to come in and
[50:05] cause Discord among the Brethren and and
[50:07] and Scatter the message but that is not
[50:09] what brother brandham taught uh and he
[50:11] actually under the Holy Spirit and
[50:13] that's what we all have to do if a
[50:14] minister stands here I can't come up
[50:16] here if I didn't really sit down and
[50:18] study I I don't think it's something we
[50:19] just stand here and throw something
[50:21] together and come up here and try to
[50:22] give it to you in that case you probably
[50:24] could have just stayed home right and so
[50:26] what we're trying to do tonight is under
[50:28] the holy spirit let him speak something
[50:30] that would actually change your life and
[50:33] and actually help you grow in the word
[50:35] and so that's something I can't do
[50:36] personally but if God would use me to do
[50:38] it or use brother Ben or brother Stewart
[50:40] God can use men and we know he still
[50:43] uses men he always has hasn't he and so
[50:45] he always will he doesn't change his
[50:47] program so brother brandom says here uh
[50:50] he says he believes this message and
[50:51] teaches it just the same as I do uh Paul
[50:53] here in Philippians 2:19 says says but I
[50:56] trust in the Lord Jesus to send uh
[50:58] timotheus shortly unto you that I also
[51:01] may be of good Comfort when I know your
[51:04] state for I have no man like-minded who
[51:07] will naturally care for your state for
[51:09] all seek their own not the things which
[51:11] are Jesus Christ but ye know the proof
[51:14] of him that as a son with the father as
[51:17] a son with the father he has served with
[51:19] me in the gospel so Paul himself didn't
[51:23] want to just go around and just send the
[51:24] letters but he wanted some men put in
[51:26] place to do the work that they were told
[51:28] to do and so I know this may not sound
[51:31] like it's coming together just yet but
[51:33] let me try to get somewhere
[51:34] tonight God puts men in the church God
[51:37] set the pastor in the church how many
[51:39] believes that the pastor you have is the
[51:42] man that God chose for the for this hour
[51:44] to Pastor you and that's just the truth
[51:47] of it because if we believe that God is
[51:49] God and we all do here tonight or we
[51:51] wouldn't be sitting here if we believe
[51:52] God is God and His word is true then we
[51:55] believe believe what a prophet said
[51:56] about the ministry in the church and so
[51:58] I think maybe tonight uh I I don't want
[52:01] to sound like I'm beating anybody over
[52:02] the head and and and rebuking anybody
[52:04] because you I believe you all treat your
[52:06] pastor well and and and I I believe he
[52:08] knows that but tonight I think we need
[52:10] to understand that when a man is put
[52:13] here he's not just put here uh you know
[52:15] we we can criticize the man all you want
[52:16] to but God put him there for a
[52:18] reason and uh you you know you can find
[52:20] faults with any human right well
[52:23] somebody say Amen or I might go to sleep
[52:24] up here
[52:26] because what what it is is God has put
[52:28] the pastor in the church a as a shepherd
[52:32] and that Shepherd has different jobs he
[52:34] can feed the sheep he has to guard the
[52:36] Sheep right because he has to watch
[52:39] every spirit that would try to come in
[52:41] to hurt the sheep that are sitting here
[52:43] that's what a pastor does a pastor's not
[52:45] just here to make you feel good a
[52:47] pastor's not just here to preach a
[52:49] sermon that you say well uh you know
[52:51] what that was pretty good maybe next
[52:53] week he'll get better or you know maybe
[52:54] one of these days he he grow up and
[52:55] really learn how to preach you know but
[52:57] but really he's preaching what the lord
[52:59] has laid on his heart regardless of what
[53:01] you think or what I think he ought to be
[53:02] preaching what he preaches is from the
[53:04] Lord and I believe you have a pastor
[53:07] here and he may listen to this and get
[53:08] on to me for this but I believe you have
[53:10] a pastor who has fully yielded to the
[53:12] message of the hour and what God would
[53:14] have him speak from behind this Pulpit
[53:16] he does not want nonsense in the church
[53:18] he does not want anything coming over
[53:19] this Pulpit but what the prophet said
[53:22] come on somebody you know your pastor
[53:24] well enough to know that so that's what
[53:25] brother Brandon wanted in a man under
[53:27] the leadership of the spirit to preach
[53:29] when he was gone when he was absent and
[53:31] when Paul couldn't be there he wanted
[53:33] timotheus and these other brothers to be
[53:35] able to stand there in his absence and
[53:37] say what a prophet said say what the
[53:39] word said and actually stay with the
[53:42] word and straight on the word so brother
[53:45] Brandon would say here he said in any
[53:47] time that you would want to uh you can
[53:49] see fit to come to hear Brother Neville
[53:51] he certainly would do you good I'm sure
[53:54] he's a great ser servant of Jesus Christ
[53:56] now that that's High Praise coming from
[53:58] a prophet that he's not just saying
[54:01] brother Neville's just here because we
[54:03] got to have somebody know go hear the
[54:05] man listen to the man he's actually
[54:07] ordained there for a purpose can you say
[54:09] Amen so as God would use brother Neville
[54:11] in that place God would use a pastor
[54:13] today when the prophet can't be on the
[54:15] scene anymore would would we love to
[54:17] have him standing here and Healing The
[54:18] Sick and or Discerning the thoughts and
[54:20] and calling the glory of God down and
[54:22] and telling you who you are sure we'd
[54:23] like to see that in person but blessed
[54:26] are you that have not seen and yet
[54:28] believe why because there's been young
[54:30] men who have taken this message and have
[54:32] carried it on and brother brandham said
[54:34] we would do that until the coming of the
[54:36] Lord and so we are standing here as as
[54:38] as prophecy being
[54:41] fulfilled and so that's what a man of
[54:43] God is to do today a pastor is to stand
[54:46] here and preach the word now brother
[54:48] Brandon didn't say how many times a week
[54:50] he had to preach or how long he had to
[54:52] preach necessarily because I can get you
[54:53] quotes on both sides of that but what
[54:55] he's trying to do is say you got to have
[54:57] somebody who is not afraid to take the
[54:59] word of God and stand here and actually
[55:01] give it to the people he's not worried
[55:03] about his income he's not worried about
[55:05] how much money he loses if half the
[55:07] church leaves no he's got to preach the
[55:08] word regardless not trying to hurt
[55:10] anybody but preach the word regardless
[55:13] and brother brand talking about brother
[55:15] Neville just a little longer here before
[55:16] I go farther he says he says I've know
[55:18] Orman Neville since I was a little boy
[55:21] and he hasn't changed one Speck only got
[55:23] closer to God he said I remember when I
[55:26] first saw him I was invited to his
[55:28] Methodist platform and when I come back
[55:30] here to the Tabernacle I said someday
[55:31] I'll baptize him in the name of Jesus
[55:33] Christ and here he is with the message
[55:35] now going on a real Gallant servant and
[55:39] brother Neville goes through many
[55:40] strains and heartaches that he doesn't
[55:42] show here at the Tabernacle but being
[55:44] that the Lord lets me have a little
[55:46] sight into people's life I know what he
[55:48] goes through a whole lot of it see and
[55:50] he certainly goes under a lot of Labor
[55:52] and strains and things and you people
[55:54] here hold him up like Joshua and Caleb
[55:57] held up the hands of Moses as he was
[55:59] bringing the word amen so we're here to
[56:02] hold up the message and you're also here
[56:05] to hold up your pastor's hands when he
[56:07] just maybe he's not having his best day
[56:10] you know your pastor is not going to
[56:11] come up here you don't know what's been
[56:12] happening in the back room you don't
[56:13] know what he's been dealing with all
[56:15] week well come on somebody you don't
[56:17] know the trials he goes through and you
[56:20] may not see that and he don't want you
[56:21] to necessarily have to see that it's not
[56:23] your burden to see that but what he
[56:25] wants to do is try to come out here
[56:26] every time and give it 100% and give it
[56:29] his very best but it's not always going
[56:31] to look like 100% to the people who have
[56:33] never been on the in the experience with
[56:35] that maybe you've never dealt with the
[56:37] problems in a church or you've never
[56:39] dealt with a situation and so you
[56:41] wouldn't understand it that's okay you
[56:43] don't have to understand it but what you
[56:44] do have to do is sometimes you got to
[56:46] trust your pastor trust God that he put
[56:49] him there and and just hold up his hands
[56:51] when he's getting frail when he's
[56:52] getting weak and maybe when he's getting
[56:54] down a little a little bit pray for him
[56:56] a little extra harder how about that and
[56:58] so brother Bram said you just don't know
[57:00] what he went through and brother Bram
[57:02] takes that from Exodus
[57:04] 17:8 he said uh then came amalec and
[57:06] fought with Israel and Reed him and
[57:08] Moses said unto Joshua choose us out men
[57:10] and go out and fight with AMC tomorrow I
[57:13] will stand on the top of the hill with
[57:15] the rod of God in mine hand so Joshua
[57:17] did as Moses had said to him and fought
[57:19] with amch and Moses Aaron and her went
[57:21] up to the top of the hill and it came to
[57:23] pass when Moses held up his hand that
[57:25] Israel prevailed and when he let down
[57:27] his hand amalec prevailed but Moses's
[57:30] hands were heavy and they took a stone
[57:32] and put it under him and he sat there on
[57:35] and Aaron and her stayed up his hands
[57:37] the one on the one side the one on the
[57:39] other side and his hands were steady
[57:41] until the going down of the Sun and
[57:43] Joshua discomforted amalik and his
[57:45] people with the edge of the sword so you
[57:47] see they were holding up Moses's hands
[57:50] Joshua had to do
[57:51] something and so he had to actually go
[57:54] and fight this Army that was coming
[57:56] against him so and today that's what a
[57:58] pastor may have to stand here and do
[58:00] there may be some wolf that would come
[58:02] in there may be a spirit that would come
[58:03] in well come on it can come on good
[58:05] people bad people it can come on good
[58:07] people here in the church it can come in
[58:09] in any way you see fit I mean it could
[58:11] come in on a minister it could come in
[58:13] on a lay member it could come in on
[58:14] anybody but the pastor has to stand
[58:16] there and with the word of God because
[58:18] the word is a deserter right and so if
[58:20] the word is a deserter then he preaches
[58:22] that word and it will cut off those
[58:25] things that would try to come in and
[58:26] hinder and maybe a pastor has to make a
[58:28] decision that we don't like or maybe he
[58:30] has to say something you just wouldn't
[58:32] wouldn't sit real well but brother
[58:33] brandom said you would sit and listen to
[58:35] that man right because he said if you
[58:37] would get up and go out it would show
[58:38] your raising or it would show this but
[58:40] what we need to do today is is just cut
[58:42] out the pettiness come on somebody cut
[58:45] out the pettiness come to church and
[58:47] expect to hear from God and let the
[58:49] pastor be the pastor and let's just
[58:51] listen how about that and so maybe I'm
[58:53] saying things he wouldn't say here
[58:54] tonight but I want to just go this way
[58:56] because brother brandom in this sermon
[58:58] if I could subtitle this I would say
[59:00] it's a word to the
[59:01] church brother Brandon in the word of
[59:03] the church says love one another above
[59:05] everything how many agree to that we're
[59:08] not here to pick fights with nobody
[59:10] we're not here to pick on
[59:13] anybody but but sometimes we think
[59:15] somebody's against us and they're really
[59:16] not so let's love one another if you see
[59:20] a brother in ER brother BR said don't
[59:21] worry about it he said just just pray
[59:23] for that brother that's what we should
[59:25] do as lay members in the church I'm one
[59:27] of you right I'm not the pastor here I'm
[59:30] I'm a lay member in this church what we
[59:31] do is we love one another we pray for
[59:33] one another now I'm telling you this is
[59:35] what the word says now you may not
[59:36] disagree with it you can sit on me all
[59:38] night if you want to but it's what the
[59:39] word says love one another above
[59:42] everything love one another don't matter
[59:44] what the devil tries to say now you're
[59:46] all one great big sweet group now but
[59:49] remember my warning see Satan won't let
[59:52] that stay that way right right he
[59:55] wouldn't let the Tabernacle stay that
[59:57] way he's not going to let this church
[59:58] stay that way something's going to try
[1:00:00] to break it up or you know that's just
[1:00:02] the way it is the devil is always on the
[1:00:04] job but we've got to stay prayed up
[1:00:07] Church we've got to stay in a place
[1:00:09] where we're so in love with one another
[1:00:11] that if something would come in and try
[1:00:12] to break this church up we don't have to
[1:00:14] take sides with that
[1:00:16] nonsense and so he said remember my
[1:00:18] warning see Satan won't let that stay
[1:00:20] that way no sir he'll shoot everything
[1:00:22] if he has to bring somebody in to make
[1:00:24] his Target he'll bring some critic or
[1:00:26] unbeliever in and sit him down and cause
[1:00:28] him to fellowship with you under the
[1:00:30] quietness and things and then he'll
[1:00:32] shoot that guy with some kind of a
[1:00:34] poison stuff and he'll start through the
[1:00:36] church with it so it don't have to be
[1:00:37] somebody new that comes in it could be
[1:00:39] somebody sitting here that is just a
[1:00:41] good quiet Christian but the devil might
[1:00:43] go to work on them well the pastor's
[1:00:45] against me today well come on church I
[1:00:46] might as well preach for a minute the
[1:00:47] pastor's not really on my side no more
[1:00:50] so I think I'm just going to start
[1:00:51] talking bad about him on this person
[1:00:54] over here they hadn't shook my hand in
[1:00:56] three Sundays I might as well start
[1:00:57] talking bad about them the devil is
[1:00:59] always on the job to seow Discord among
[1:01:02] this church it's not just the our
[1:01:04] brother's Church our sister's church and
[1:01:07] and you say well maybe this church don't
[1:01:08] have that problem no the devil's working
[1:01:10] on every church that is trying to win
[1:01:12] lost souls he's working on everybody if
[1:01:15] you're a Christian here tonight the
[1:01:17] devil's working on
[1:01:18] you and as our Pastor said Sunday that
[1:01:22] shows he hadn't got you yet all right
[1:01:24] and so I'd be a little worried if he
[1:01:26] wasn't working on us I'd be a little
[1:01:27] worried if the devil wasn't coming in
[1:01:29] trying to cause Discord Among Us that
[1:01:31] shows we've got Unity that shows we've
[1:01:33] actually got something going on because
[1:01:35] the devil tries to come in you know
[1:01:37] every time you see sickness strike the
[1:01:38] church that's not God doing it that's
[1:01:40] the devil working on the church every
[1:01:42] time you see somebody come in and and
[1:01:44] they're just trying to pull this little
[1:01:46] group off to one side and this little
[1:01:47] group over here trying to make little
[1:01:49] clicks and little isms and I tell you
[1:01:51] that's the devil working that doesn't
[1:01:53] mean the people people are devils now
[1:01:55] that come on somebody we're not calling
[1:01:57] the PE but the devil will work on those
[1:01:59] people and the devil could work I mean
[1:02:01] you know he could get into a good man he
[1:02:03] could work you know he could get into uh
[1:02:05] you could take the best man in this
[1:02:06] building and the devil could be working
[1:02:08] on him trying to get him to say
[1:02:09] something that would cause a little
[1:02:10] problem in the church it's just the way
[1:02:13] it is so we've got to keep our guard up
[1:02:16] and so that's why the scripture we
[1:02:17] started off with was Christ is the head
[1:02:19] and he must have the preeminence don't
[1:02:22] look at your problems don't look at the
[1:02:24] little things that might come up in the
[1:02:25] church but keep Christ in the focus keep
[1:02:28] Christ as the head of the church and and
[1:02:30] the pastor is always subject to the
[1:02:33] word I promise you your pastor is not
[1:02:36] standing here and preaching his own
[1:02:38] Doctrine he wouldn't do that I won't
[1:02:40] stand here and preach my own doctrines
[1:02:43] I'll stand here and tell you what a
[1:02:44] prophet said I'll stand here just like a
[1:02:46] prophet did and give you a warning that
[1:02:47] things might come into the church there
[1:02:49] a pastor can stand here and do that to
[1:02:51] you but a but I promise you the pastor
[1:02:53] that stands here here is not one that is
[1:02:55] trying to promote himself come on
[1:02:58] somebody he's trying to promote the
[1:03:00] message of the hour and he's doing it
[1:03:02] with the best the best intentions at
[1:03:04] heart he he wants the best for this
[1:03:06] congregation he wants the best for every
[1:03:09] person in this building but when he sees
[1:03:11] the wolf coming in trying to hurt you it
[1:03:13] is his job to try to cut that thing off
[1:03:17] you say well that's a little bit harsh
[1:03:18] that's a no no that's the that's the
[1:03:20] pastor's Duty oh the pastor is supposed
[1:03:22] to just create a great big loving
[1:03:24] environment no the pastor has to be he
[1:03:27] he's almost like the father of the
[1:03:29] church sometimes it ain't
[1:03:32] fun I hope you still love me after I get
[1:03:34] done with this tonight it's a little out
[1:03:36] of my comfort zone on what I'm doing but
[1:03:38] I'm trying to tell you this because I
[1:03:41] believe it's important to know it don't
[1:03:43] matter how good our services are it
[1:03:45] don't matter how how how good our
[1:03:47] fellowship is if we're going out them
[1:03:49] doors and talking bad about each other
[1:03:51] and running the pastor down and running
[1:03:52] the deacons down and running this one
[1:03:54] running our Sunday school teachers and
[1:03:56] running a person that maybe not they
[1:03:57] don't hold a position in the church but
[1:03:59] we're running them down and trying to
[1:04:00] say well this one you know maybe maybe
[1:04:02] if I could do a better job well I wish
[1:04:04] you would you know that that's just the
[1:04:06] way it is there there's always going to
[1:04:08] be that but you realize that's the devil
[1:04:10] trying to get on you right after a good
[1:04:12] service the devil's always I tell you
[1:04:15] the best Services is usually you'll have
[1:04:16] some problems follow that because the
[1:04:18] devil's trying to come in now we don't
[1:04:20] have any problems that I know of but I'm
[1:04:22] going to tell you this the devil will
[1:04:24] come in if he hasn't he will he may not
[1:04:27] come in tomorrow he may not come in next
[1:04:29] year but he will come in keep your guard
[1:04:31] up when the Devil comes in and tries to
[1:04:33] hurt the church now I don't believe
[1:04:36] brother Brandon was just making this
[1:04:37] warning to the brandom Tabernacle I
[1:04:39] don't believe he was just making this
[1:04:41] warning to for brother Neville that we
[1:04:43] need to lift his hands up and we need to
[1:04:45] help brother Neville no no brother
[1:04:47] Neville had to be there to hold the
[1:04:48] hands of a prophet up and then he told
[1:04:50] the church to hold the hands of brother
[1:04:51] Neville up we need to help one another
[1:04:53] because we're in a fight for our lives
[1:04:56] with the Devil
[1:04:57] Himself brother bam said now don't you
[1:05:00] take sides with it he's talking about
[1:05:02] that if if if the devil would come in
[1:05:04] and shoot someone full of poison don't
[1:05:06] you take sides with it and many times
[1:05:09] what you'll see in a church I is is I've
[1:05:12] seen this happen uh just being on the
[1:05:14] inside of some of this I've seen I've
[1:05:16] seen people sit there and the pastor
[1:05:18] have to deal with something and then
[1:05:20] somebody in the church thinks well the
[1:05:22] pastor is kicking people out or he's
[1:05:23] running people off no you don't know
[1:05:25] what the pastor had to deal with now
[1:05:27] I'll say that and get in trouble later
[1:05:28] but that's just the truth of it because
[1:05:31] what you don't know is a pastor has to
[1:05:34] sit there and study sometimes for hours
[1:05:37] hours after hour day after day just to
[1:05:39] get one sermon and then if you get a
[1:05:41] spirit that comes in you get so in tune
[1:05:44] with God you'll feel when a spirit is
[1:05:45] against you you know that can hinder a
[1:05:47] whole service it can actually you can
[1:05:49] feel when people aren't for you you can
[1:05:50] feel when people are are setting on you
[1:05:52] you know that's just what you learn it's
[1:05:54] what you feel and and and sadly you wish
[1:05:56] you didn't you wish you could stand here
[1:05:57] like a robot but God didn't call robots
[1:06:00] God called men we feel things just like
[1:06:02] you feel things we want the service to
[1:06:04] be good just like you want the service
[1:06:05] to be good but did you know many times
[1:06:07] it's the attitude of the people and the
[1:06:10] way they come to church determines the
[1:06:13] outcome of the
[1:06:15] service now that don't that that don't
[1:06:17] mean a preacher can't don't they should
[1:06:19] they have to study we have to stay in
[1:06:21] the word we have to give our give it
[1:06:23] 100% sent it's not okay for us to just
[1:06:25] walk in out of work and stand up here
[1:06:28] and just start rattling off at whatever
[1:06:30] comes to our mind that's not what the
[1:06:32] prophet taught the prophet himself would
[1:06:34] stand there and read notes while he's
[1:06:36] preaching a message that's the prophet
[1:06:38] of God who who an angel would come and
[1:06:40] speak lift to ear but a prophet would
[1:06:42] have to stand there and actually read
[1:06:44] his notes because when he was in that
[1:06:45] study many times when you're in the
[1:06:47] study and when you're doing that that's
[1:06:49] often times when the Holy Spirit really
[1:06:51] comes in and shows you something what
[1:06:54] happens is a lot of times it's so real
[1:06:55] in there and you come out here and
[1:06:57] you're like man I wish it could be the
[1:06:58] same way but sometimes you just got to
[1:07:00] break some barriers down yeah and that's
[1:07:03] what you've got to do as a people of the
[1:07:04] church you got to break down that
[1:07:06] barrier because you're going to church
[1:07:07] with your guard up well the pastor may
[1:07:09] say something I don't like put that
[1:07:11] thing
[1:07:12] down sir come on
[1:07:15] somebody I got you for at least another
[1:07:17] 15 minutes so you're going to have to
[1:07:19] might as well respond you know but but
[1:07:21] listen the devil is always is going to
[1:07:24] try to make you come to church with a
[1:07:26] complex he wants you to come in
[1:07:28] somebody's against me today somebody
[1:07:30] don't like me somebody's doing this
[1:07:33] somebody's doing that you know the devil
[1:07:36] is always on the job and that's just you
[1:07:39] know we know that and he's not going to
[1:07:41] stop so what we got to do is recognize
[1:07:44] the devil and his tactics and what he's
[1:07:47] going to do take a warning from the
[1:07:49] prophet that the devil will come in and
[1:07:51] try to disrupt our church come on
[1:07:52] somebody the devil devil is always on
[1:07:54] the job but what you've got to do is
[1:07:56] stay prayed up stay sweet with one
[1:07:59] another brother said stay in love with
[1:08:02] one another he goes on down here he says
[1:08:03] he says you stay right loving and sweet
[1:08:06] and kind to one another pray for that
[1:08:07] man that he'll be saved too yes sir we
[1:08:10] don't we don't want to call we don't
[1:08:11] want anybody to be lost we don't want
[1:08:13] anybody to be listen Church we're not
[1:08:16] here just you know somebody uh told me
[1:08:18] recently you know a church is like a
[1:08:20] hospital that's right but when that
[1:08:21] doctor has to set your arm or when that
[1:08:24] doctor has to stitch something up or
[1:08:26] when the doctor has to go to work on you
[1:08:27] it may not feel good for a minute but it
[1:08:30] is a hospital we don't want to kill the
[1:08:33] patients it ain't a funeral home we do
[1:08:35] want to help the patients but they got
[1:08:37] to want to be helped if you go to a
[1:08:39] hospital you want to be helped if you go
[1:08:42] to you you're putting your hands you're
[1:08:44] you're putting your life in the hands of
[1:08:46] the doctor and when you come to church
[1:08:48] you're putting your the the lives of
[1:08:50] your children in the hands of that
[1:08:51] Pastor many times because you believe
[1:08:53] that that Pastor is ordained to carry
[1:08:55] you through but now there is a thing for
[1:08:58] you to do you can absolutely hold that
[1:09:01] Pastor accountable to the
[1:09:02] word but but but remember make sure it's
[1:09:06] the word that you're holding accountable
[1:09:07] to and not your own beliefs and
[1:09:10] complexes I hope yall are okay today I
[1:09:13] I'm not trying to preach at anybody I'll
[1:09:15] preach at myself I I uh I'll say this I
[1:09:18] I was sitting and I heard this tape that
[1:09:20] I'm we're going through Christ is the
[1:09:21] mystery I heard this in the church I
[1:09:24] used to go to they played it from the
[1:09:25] very first second to the very last
[1:09:26] second one time and I will say that my
[1:09:29] attitude towards a pastor that day
[1:09:30] wasn't
[1:09:31] great 3 hours and 59 minutes and some
[1:09:34] change on a Sunday morning we're not
[1:09:36] going to hold you that long tonight
[1:09:38] because I'm dealing with like 10 10 10
[1:09:41] 10 verses or you know we're not we're
[1:09:43] all going to hold you long so I'm almost
[1:09:45] done but but you see many times the
[1:09:48] devil can get in because the service was
[1:09:49] 10 minutes too
[1:09:51] long or the song leader didn't sing the
[1:09:54] song you wanted or all the musicians
[1:09:56] wasn't
[1:09:59] there it happens life happens people get
[1:10:03] sick people can't go to church that
[1:10:04] happens that really does now I I'm not a
[1:10:07] person that actually takes up for
[1:10:09] missing church but I'll say this
[1:10:10] sometimes you just can't go there is a
[1:10:13] difference in uh wanting to miss church
[1:10:16] and having to miss
[1:10:18] church uh so I believe it's in your
[1:10:20] heart that really matters if you want to
[1:10:22] be there and you can be there then you
[1:10:23] you go right if you want to be at a if
[1:10:26] you want to go to a ball game and you
[1:10:27] can go to a ball game you go to the ball
[1:10:29] game if you want to go go to work on
[1:10:31] Monday morning and you can go to work on
[1:10:33] Monday morning you do go to work on
[1:10:35] Monday morning if you can go to church
[1:10:37] on Sunday morning you want to go to
[1:10:39] church on then you go right what happens
[1:10:42] is a lot of people may not want to go uh
[1:10:45] now now that that's that's up to them
[1:10:46] that's between them and the Lord really
[1:10:48] uh I I I've never never liked that
[1:10:51] myself but that's just me uh now we'll
[1:10:53] get to what a prophet said about in a
[1:10:55] minute and that way you can be mad at
[1:10:57] him and not me tonight I want to go to
[1:10:59] church here Sunday so if that's okay
[1:11:01] with you or just keep on going he said
[1:11:03] pray for that man he'll be saved too or
[1:11:06] that woman whoever it is just pray for
[1:11:08] them and stick one with another how many
[1:11:11] likes that this is a word to the church
[1:11:14] it's a warning to the church don't let
[1:11:16] bitterness come amongst you backbiting
[1:11:18] don't let it come among you H you know
[1:11:20] this is as much for me as it is you
[1:11:22] tonight I can get out of line and say
[1:11:24] something that I shouldn't
[1:11:27] say that's just the truth of it and I
[1:11:30] have to be man enough to stand here
[1:11:32] after doing that and face you people
[1:11:34] again but we have to do that with each
[1:11:37] other you ever you ever have a big
[1:11:39] family there's eight of us in our family
[1:11:41] I can see my brother sitting there
[1:11:42] watching right now and he's just
[1:11:43] sweating because he don't know where I'm
[1:11:45] going with
[1:11:46] this and you see how they how they are
[1:11:48] in the family you got the bigger ones of
[1:11:49] the oldest and they ate more than the
[1:11:51] rest of us you know and uh so so we all
[1:11:55] we all we all but we didn't all get
[1:11:57] along right nobody else had that problem
[1:12:00] in their family did they everybody else
[1:12:02] is angels in here I see the Halos most
[1:12:04] of them burn
[1:12:06] out but y'all get your family together
[1:12:09] on Thanksgiving and everybody gets along
[1:12:11] so well there's no fussing there's no
[1:12:12] fighting there's no you know there's
[1:12:14] there's just nothing it's all so perfect
[1:12:17] not in my family but in
[1:12:19] somebody's but you see that's the way it
[1:12:21] is a lot of times in the family of God
[1:12:23] now brother brandham actually tells us
[1:12:25] one place he says you know he says us
[1:12:26] Brams he says we would fight in the
[1:12:28] backyard but we come out front and he
[1:12:30] said' don't you touch one of them he
[1:12:33] said then you got to tangle with all of
[1:12:34] us now that's the way we should be now
[1:12:36] I'm not telling you go fight in the
[1:12:37] backyard but if you do have a difference
[1:12:39] settle it in the backyard this right
[1:12:42] here is a place of worship this is a
[1:12:44] time to lay down your pettiness this is
[1:12:46] the time to lay aside your indifferences
[1:12:49] and come and worship God it's a time
[1:12:51] when we we have to realize that the
[1:12:53] devil may have got on somebody today and
[1:12:55] caused them to say something we didn't
[1:12:57] like but that's okay it's not going to
[1:13:00] stop my praise in the house of God it's
[1:13:02] not going to stop me from getting a
[1:13:03] blessing I could stand here and say
[1:13:05] something you don't like that's okay
[1:13:07] spit out the seed and take the Cherry
[1:13:10] what brother brandham say he that's what
[1:13:11] he said to do so why can't we just do it
[1:13:14] let's love one another let's not pick on
[1:13:16] one another let's not always look for a
[1:13:18] fault in another brother because there's
[1:13:20] always going to be a penny and a dime
[1:13:22] and a quarter you pull your change jar
[1:13:24] somebody's got a change jar here mine's
[1:13:26] empty I cash it in now but but but
[1:13:29] really you think about it you got a
[1:13:30] change jar and you start dumping that
[1:13:31] out do you know that's all worth
[1:13:33] something every bit of it's worth
[1:13:35] something if you're a penni's worth be a
[1:13:38] Penny's worth be the best Penny you can
[1:13:40] be may maybe if you work a little harder
[1:13:42] at it you can be a
[1:13:43] nickel but whatever you are be the best
[1:13:46] of that but let's not condemn a penny
[1:13:48] because we're a a a quarter let's not
[1:13:51] condemn a dime because we're a quarter
[1:13:53] see you don't ever want to get that
[1:13:55] mentality of I'm better than somebody
[1:13:57] else we're all Sinners saved by the
[1:13:59] grace of God every one of us sitting
[1:14:02] here at best is just six foot of
[1:14:05] dirt 6'2 whatever the tallest person in
[1:14:09] here 52 of
[1:14:12] dirt for real I didn't miss that by much
[1:14:14] did
[1:14:15] I but but that's what we all are we're
[1:14:18] just made up brother B calls it potach
[1:14:20] and calcium we're just made up of this
[1:14:23] that that's all we are we're humans
[1:14:25] There's a sticky nature to this Humanity
[1:14:27] that we can't overcome right now we can
[1:14:30] we our our our spirit can lead us to
[1:14:32] where maybe that maybe we we don't have
[1:14:34] to use that sticky nature so much and we
[1:14:36] can be like we don't have to poke
[1:14:37] everybody that comes by no maybe once in
[1:14:40] a while we can at least be a desert
[1:14:41] flower right sir at least look good sir
[1:14:45] maybe we don't feel good maybe if you
[1:14:48] did touch us we'd poke you but but but
[1:14:51] you see what I'm saying church we we
[1:14:52] don't need to to really let our we don't
[1:14:54] need to let what happened outside these
[1:14:56] walls come in here and affect our
[1:14:57] services we don't need to let what
[1:14:59] somebody said about our church affect
[1:15:02] our church we're a family here the very
[1:15:05] best of us and the very worst of us our
[1:15:07] family here we love one another we get
[1:15:10] over things come on somebody we let
[1:15:13] stuff go we don't hold on to grudges
[1:15:16] anymore I've got family that might have
[1:15:18] got mad at one Thanksgiving dinner and
[1:15:20] the next year at Thanksgiving I'm eating
[1:15:21] with them again what what is it we got a
[1:15:24] common we have a common thing that we
[1:15:27] enjoy and that's the
[1:15:29] food we're prits we love food you know
[1:15:32] but if you come here to church then I
[1:15:34] believe you're coming here for the word
[1:15:36] of God and so we have something in
[1:15:38] common that we can Fellowship around you
[1:15:41] don't have to agree with my opinions on
[1:15:43] it I don't have to agree with your
[1:15:45] opinions on it but we want to keep the
[1:15:47] devil out of our conversations and love
[1:15:50] one another regardless now what's
[1:15:52] preached over over this Pulpit is the
[1:15:54] word of God if you don't like it the way
[1:15:56] it's preached go back and study it find
[1:15:59] out if it's right I'd say more often
[1:16:02] than not you're going to find it's the
[1:16:04] truth because I'm not afraid to stand
[1:16:07] here and say what a prophet said your
[1:16:09] pastor is not afraid to stand here and
[1:16:10] say what a prophet said it don't always
[1:16:13] feel good to say it but it's a truth
[1:16:15] anyway now what you do with that is
[1:16:18] completely between you and God but what
[1:16:20] we do regardless of what you do with
[1:16:22] what I say tonight
[1:16:23] I still love you when I walk out that
[1:16:25] door I still love you when I'm standing
[1:16:27] here there is no bitterness here because
[1:16:30] somebody said well brother Joel I didn't
[1:16:31] agree with what you said tonight well
[1:16:33] that's that's absolutely okay if you can
[1:16:36] disagree with these hundred quotes You
[1:16:38] can disagree with the prophet and you
[1:16:39] can disagree with it if I said something
[1:16:41] in here tonight that was on my own you
[1:16:43] have a right to disagree with it and
[1:16:45] even the things that I've read to you go
[1:16:48] take them back to the message go take
[1:16:50] them back to the scriptures you have
[1:16:52] that right but just because you have
[1:16:54] that right don't let the devil come in
[1:16:56] there and say well he was wrong I'm not
[1:16:58] going to fellowship with him no more no
[1:17:00] why do we go to these other churches in
[1:17:01] fellowship with them we're not telling
[1:17:03] you they're 100% right but what we're
[1:17:05] telling you is they're our brother we
[1:17:06] don't know what they preach but we
[1:17:08] believe they preach the message of the
[1:17:09] hour we have confidence that they preach
[1:17:11] the message of the hour we're not
[1:17:13] sitting there every service they might
[1:17:15] say something you don't agree with
[1:17:16] that's okay we can love them anyway and
[1:17:19] that's what brothers and sisters do we
[1:17:22] get along regard less of how we feel we
[1:17:25] get along regardless of the little spats
[1:17:28] that we might have had I might have said
[1:17:30] something offended somebody and I
[1:17:31] apologize for that maybe I didn't know I
[1:17:34] did it so maybe I didn't apologize well
[1:17:37] and that comes back at me too there's
[1:17:39] people that say things you're like well
[1:17:40] I wonder if they really meant that you
[1:17:41] know if you just let that get to you the
[1:17:43] devil will use that to hurt you and your
[1:17:46] brother but a lot of times you're the
[1:17:48] only one getting hurt because your
[1:17:50] brother don't know what he did wrong go
[1:17:52] to him and tell him if you have to but
[1:17:54] I'll tell you this sometimes let's just
[1:17:55] not take something Petty to somebody and
[1:17:57] say well you mispronounced this or you
[1:17:59] did this CU I don't want to hear it
[1:18:01] now but but let's love one another are
[1:18:04] we a family here or not do we love one
[1:18:07] another or not I know you're not all
[1:18:08] here tonight there's some of you
[1:18:09] streaming so this next part I don't want
[1:18:11] you to take it wrong I've only got five
[1:18:14] minutes
[1:18:15] left I'll read it just as quick as I can
[1:18:18] brother Bram said stay with your
[1:18:20] pastor he's the shepherd and you give
[1:18:23] him respects he'll lead you through
[1:18:27] because he's ordained of God to do so
[1:18:30] now brother Bram said now do you
[1:18:31] remember that and the congregation
[1:18:33] says there you go the enemy will come in
[1:18:37] sir and when he does just cling that
[1:18:40] much closer
[1:18:42] together I like that we don't have to
[1:18:45] separate because the devil tries to
[1:18:47] divide us we can actually get closer
[1:18:49] together use what the Satan meant for
[1:18:51] what what the devil meant for for evil
[1:18:53] use it for good let that thing bind you
[1:18:56] together take that Spirit of of
[1:18:58] depression that's trying to bind you in
[1:19:00] a service and you know what say I'm
[1:19:02] going to have my breakthrough and I'm
[1:19:04] going to praise God anyway you might be
[1:19:05] the loudest person in church that day
[1:19:07] because the devil tried to give you
[1:19:09] depression you might be the best
[1:19:11] worshipper there because the devil tried
[1:19:13] to stop you and you realize hey the
[1:19:15] devil's here working on one side I'm
[1:19:17] going to give God my praise cuz there
[1:19:20] ain't no Rock going to cry or shout or
[1:19:22] pray
[1:19:23] in my place the enemy will come and when
[1:19:26] he does cling that much closer and the
[1:19:28] one that the devil is using for an enemy
[1:19:30] will either get out or come in and be
[1:19:32] one of you they don't always have to
[1:19:35] leave they can actually sit here and
[1:19:37] come under subjection to the word of God
[1:19:40] and actually be one of you and what do
[1:19:42] we do then we forget about it and love
[1:19:45] that brother or sister just like they're
[1:19:47] one of
[1:19:48] us and if they leave us pray for
[1:19:51] them pray God would restore them pray
[1:19:54] God would save their soul if he can't do
[1:19:56] it here pray he does it somewhere else
[1:19:58] we don't ever cut anybody out we're not
[1:20:00] God we can see things sometimes that are
[1:20:03] coming brother called us fruit
[1:20:04] inspectors sometimes we can see things
[1:20:07] sometimes you can see things coming but
[1:20:08] we're not God we don't have the final
[1:20:11] say over a person's
[1:20:12] life I'm thankful for that somebody
[1:20:15] might have counted me out at some point
[1:20:17] somebody's counted you out at some point
[1:20:19] but God has not counted you out you're
[1:20:22] still here here why because you're still
[1:20:24] wanting the word of God and if you're
[1:20:26] wanting the word then there's something
[1:20:28] in you that desires the word and when
[1:20:31] those two things meet it creates a
[1:20:34] Powerhouse that can't be
[1:20:36] stopped brother bam says
[1:20:38] here he says he either become become one
[1:20:41] of you said that's all don't never Clan
[1:20:43] among one or talk make yourself clannish
[1:20:46] let's not ever do that it's a warning
[1:20:48] from a prophet I think it's okay to
[1:20:49] apply it to
[1:20:50] ourselves I don't want to become clish
[1:20:52] with one person in the church and never
[1:20:54] speak to somebody else I I want to do
[1:20:56] everything I can to love everybody in
[1:20:58] this church well you say you didn't

[1:22:48] it okay he said and God wants us as a
[1:22:53] body of Believers to stay right exactly
[1:22:57] with one another where with one

[1:23:13] watch it sometimes you look at the ones
[1:23:14] that aren't here and we miss a good
[1:23:16] service over that because the devil's
[1:23:17] taking so many out sick and we're like
[1:23:19] well the church ain't full what's
[1:23:21] happening it's the devil that means you
[1:23:24] need to be here that means you need to
[1:23:26] be here so you can come and you can
[1:23:27] worship because the devil kept somebody
[1:23:29] away don't mean he has to keep you away
[1:23:31] well there's not going to be many there
[1:23:32] tonight maybe I can stay home no let's
[1:23:34] just come to church if you can and if
[1:23:37] you have a desire to come to church and
[1:23:40] you will receive a blessing it may be
[1:23:43] something you hear tonight six months
[1:23:45] down the road you needed it and you
[1:23:48] you're like hey I I thought that sermon
[1:23:50] was a wasted 40 minutes but it actually
[1:23:53] did me some good so don't judge nothing
[1:23:55] before it's
[1:23:57] time give me some Grace all right all
[1:24:00] right I'm almost done okay 1 Corinthians
[1:24:02] 12 let's read that just before we get
[1:24:04] out of here for one for by one Spirit we
[1:24:06] are all baptized into one body whether
[1:24:10] we be Jews or Gentiles whether we be
[1:24:11] Bond or free we have been all made to
[1:24:14] drink into one spirit for the body is
[1:24:17] not one member but many if the foot
[1:24:19] shall say because I am not the hand I am
[1:24:21] not the body is it therefore not of the
[1:24:23] body and if the ear shall say because I
[1:24:25] am not the eye I am not of the body is
[1:24:27] it therefore not of the body if the
[1:24:29] whole body were an ie where were the
[1:24:31] hearing if the whole were hearing where
[1:24:34] were the smelling but now God has set
[1:24:36] the members every one of them in the
[1:24:38] body as it hath pleased him it may not
[1:24:41] please you and it may not please me but
[1:24:43] it pleases God and that's all that
[1:24:45] really matters I didn't come to church
[1:24:48] to be to to please myself you didn't
[1:24:50] come to church to please yourself but it
[1:24:52] pleased God that you could come and say
[1:24:54] here tonight and he said now brother B
[1:24:57] goes on he said now you've got tapes on
[1:24:58] that what you've got tapes on what we
[1:25:00] believe you've got tapes on discipline
[1:25:01] in the church how we behave oursel in
[1:25:03] the Church of God referring to church
[1:25:05] order there he says and how we got to
[1:25:07] come here together and sit together in
[1:25:10] Heavenly places now now that we've got
[1:25:13] tapes on that we know a prophet taught
[1:25:15] us that so all we have to do is just say
[1:25:18] you know body I don't care how you feel
[1:25:20] today I'm not talking about real
[1:25:21] sickness don't don't jump on me all at
[1:25:23] once if you got the flu stay home you
[1:25:26] know you got Co stay home you understand
[1:25:29] that but when you can come to church
[1:25:32] then you should go to church right I I
[1:25:34] think that's self-explanatory but I I
[1:25:36] didn't want to get in trouble 1
[1:25:37] Corinthians 14:37 says if any man think
[1:25:40] himself to be a prophet or spiritual let
[1:25:42] him acknowledge that the things that I
[1:25:43] write unto you are the Commandments of
[1:25:45] the Lord now this is the last quote and
[1:25:48] then we'll and then we'll we'll we'll
[1:25:49] stop he says don't stay home
[1:25:53] if God is in your heart you can't hardly
[1:25:56] wait for them doors to open out yonder
[1:25:58] to get in there to fellowship with your
[1:26:00] brothers
[1:26:02] now I'm not I'm not talking about the
[1:26:05] people that are sick we understand if
[1:26:07] you want to be here and you're sick and
[1:26:09] you can't come we understand that I hope
[1:26:10] they're streaming tonight uh or
[1:26:11] streaming somebody tonight and and so we
[1:26:15] we want you to be in church but we
[1:26:17] understand sickness happens now I you
[1:26:21] know we'll leave it to
[1:26:23] that pray that devil off of you maybe
[1:26:26] sometime but I understand you know
[1:26:27] there's contagious stuff goes around and
[1:26:28] if you bring it to church then the whole
[1:26:30] church is gone you I understand that we
[1:26:32] we we understand we're we're we're
[1:26:33] sensible around here too we're not
[1:26:35] trying to you know drag your kids to
[1:26:36] church with 104 fever and all that or
[1:26:38] you know if they should be in the
[1:26:39] hospital take them to the
[1:26:42] hospital he said if God is in your heart
[1:26:45] you can't hardly wait for them doors to
[1:26:46] be open to fellowship with your brother
[1:26:48] he said if you don't feel that way then
[1:26:49] I tell you it's time you got to pray
[1:26:52] this is a desire in a Believer you want
[1:26:54] to be in church you want to be in the
[1:26:57] house of God you can't hardly stay home
[1:27:00] you can't hardly make yourself stay home
[1:27:03] if God is in your heart now there's the
[1:27:05] disclaimer if God is in your heart now
[1:27:09] now he said now we're in the last days
[1:27:11] we're exhorted in the Bible he said uh
[1:27:14] to much more as we see that day
[1:27:15] approaching so it's even more important
[1:27:17] now to go to church than it ever was and
[1:27:21] I'm not saying how many every church is
[1:27:23] local Sovereign you understand that you
[1:27:24] can if you have one a week go to that
[1:27:26] one time a week if you have three a week
[1:27:28] if you have seven a week no no that
[1:27:30] might be a little crazy actually but uh
[1:27:33] I can't I don't even think Ben can find
[1:27:35] enough preachers for that because I
[1:27:36] ain't doing it but but but think about
[1:27:39] it if if God is in your heart then what
[1:27:41] do you want you want to do the word of
[1:27:44] God right and the Bible tells us that
[1:27:48] much more as we see the day approaching
[1:27:50] to go to church this ain't just
[1:27:52] something a prophet got up and said he
[1:27:53] took the word and backed and said what
[1:27:55] the word said you see this wasn't just
[1:27:58] his seeing people staying home and
[1:27:59] saying I'm going to get up and preach
[1:28:00] with them people no he was taking the
[1:28:02] word of God and speaking to the people
[1:28:05] he he wanted to tell the people this the
[1:28:07] devil's going to come in the devil's
[1:28:08] going to try to make you stay away the
[1:28:10] devil's going to try to make you mad at
[1:28:11] somebody well I'm not going to go to
[1:28:13] church because of the Hypocrites but you
[1:28:14] went to
[1:28:18] Walmart and how many Hypocrites are
[1:28:21] there I'm not judging but you know the
[1:28:24] people that are staying out of church at
[1:28:25] Walmart
[1:28:27] anyway uh he said this will all men know
[1:28:29] you're my discip my disciples I skipped
[1:28:31] one there brother Robert when you have
[1:28:33] love one for the other that's right stay
[1:28:35] right together if the brother you think
[1:28:36] he's a little wrong or the sister say
[1:28:38] Lord don't let me never have the root of
[1:28:40] bitterness spring up because it'll
[1:28:42] affect him and it'll take the Christ
[1:28:45] right out of my
[1:28:47] life bitterness we don't want it it
[1:28:50] don't have no place in the church we
[1:28:51] don't need it in the church and and and
[1:28:54] I musicians can go ahead and come
[1:28:55] because I am out of
[1:28:57] time he said now he said that poison
[1:29:01] acids of malice and jealousy and hatred
[1:29:03] that will just take the Holy Spirit
[1:29:05] right away from you it will run him from
[1:29:08] the Tabernacle here it'll do the same in
[1:29:11] Hardy Arkansas church this ain't just
[1:29:13] the brandom Tabernacle if you let malice
[1:29:15] and jealousy and hatred come among you
[1:29:17] it'll run the spirit right out of the
[1:29:19] Pew you're sitting in because how can
[1:29:22] how how can Darkness and Light walk
[1:29:24] together they can't do it so you've got
[1:29:26] to get that thing out of you let that
[1:29:28] thing go let that Darkness just drop
[1:29:30] that Darkness drop that drop that
[1:29:32] bitterness at the door my old boss used
[1:29:34] to say check your attitude at the door
[1:29:36] but I'm not telling you that tonight
[1:29:38] because you all deal with things every
[1:29:39] day you're dealing with things that
[1:29:41] maybe I don't understand you're dealing
[1:29:43] with things maybe I couldn't handle God
[1:29:46] let you handle it because you can and
[1:29:48] maybe I'm dealing with things that you
[1:29:49] couldn't handle but that's that's the
[1:29:51] way it is is but but when we come to
[1:29:53] church we're coming to hear the word of
[1:29:55] God it don't matter about my complexes
[1:29:58] it don't matter what I think about
[1:29:59] somebody else let me just hear from God
[1:30:02] and I can be blessed in the house of
[1:30:05] God he said that will just he said he
[1:30:07] said it'll kill the spirit of God or
[1:30:09] drive it away from here it'll hurt your
[1:30:11] pastor it'll do everything see don't you
[1:30:13] do that you just wax that much closer
[1:30:16] together and take the Buckle as the
[1:30:18] brother testified a minister here the
[1:30:20] other night he said about having a
[1:30:21] buckle see he said just buckle on the
[1:30:23] whole armor of God just pull her on
[1:30:25] tighten it up move right up close to one
[1:30:27] another can you say Amen to that he said
[1:30:30] love one another anyhow talk nice about
[1:30:33] one another well I can't think of
[1:30:34] nothing think of
[1:30:37] something and if you can't say something
[1:30:40] nice but he said talk nice about one
[1:30:42] another you know I may not see anything

[1:30:46] glowingly great but I can tell you

[1:31:01] about our differences let's love one
[1:31:02] another above all let's love one another
[1:31:05] your Mysteries don't matter if you can't
[1:31:07] love one another Paul said it's just a a
[1:31:09] sounding brass and a tinkling symbol but
[1:31:12] love one another above everything else
