changed I I uh we we four days after I was here the last time we moved uh to Tucson Arizona so um been out there since uh since about the middle of November I guess time we got everything squared away and started a new job and have been busy with the things of God and and we've been traveling all over the place and uh preaching about every weekend we can and and uh so just been happy to be in service of the Lord is that are you happy to be in the service of the Lord this morning amen amen uh certainly uh have missed being in the South though everybody nobody talks right out there if I got um you know and I moved to that foreign country there in northern Mexico I think they call it and uh or Tucson or whatever it's called but anyways we uh adjusting to life out there now Lots happened my uh uh my son-in-law and and oldest daughter and two grandbabies moved out there with us and so I've got all of my family there my middle daughter and my she was uh she'd come over here to some meetings with me a couple times and uh she got out there and I'll tell you if you've got a daughter um boys is they're just like cockroaches you can't you can spray the house down and do everything

for them sister Brandy asked that I greet everyone for her as well and and as you can imagine as a mother of a of a girl that's engaged she is frantically preparing for a wedding so uh God bless you all this morning so before we get started this morning there's a quote that's been is it all right if I read you a quote Yeah yeah um there's a quote that's been uh not it's not I'm not going to preach on that this morning but it's a quote it's kind of been my my rallying cry the past couple months or so and and sometimes you just read a scripture or you read something a message that just it just kind of speaks to you and this has been that for me and uh it's from the message of why and brother Branham makes this statement he said we just don't know what lays ahead yet tonight he says I like that because you can be expecting just anything to happen and he says we don't know just what time that God might just come into us here and just give us another Pentecost and Saints I love that this morning I I love that we serve the almighty God today and and I love that the possibilities today are endless I love that God can do anything he chooses to do for you and I today I love that we don't know just what lays ahead yet we we don't know what might happen in this service we don't know what God might do today we we don't know what things God can work for us we we know he's the same yesterday today and forever we know that he still heals the sick we know that he still raises the dead we we know that he still gives the baptism of the Holy Ghost we know these things we don't know what he might do for us today I love that and he said we don't know just when God might just come into us here and just give us another Pentecost and I I don't know why Pentecost got to be a bad word Saints but I'm not talking about Pentecost like an organization I'm talking about Pentecost like I'm a Believer and I got a Pentecostal experience the Lord yes sir I'm not talking about Pentecost like I'm trying to uh work something up I'm talking about I believe in a Pentecostal blessing for the believer he said that's what we need so I've indicated Prophet said today that that's what we need is another Pentecost he said and I would be so happy to be right in it with you to enjoy the fellowship the freshness of the Holy Spirit and I tell you our lands really needed he said so he Saints of the prophet of God said that what we need is a new Pentecost he said well when he said our lands need it this church needs it Hardy Arkansas needs it Tucson Arizona needs it we all need it today and I'd be so happy to be a part of it with you yeah and it's a possibility today amen and we'll touch up the monitors a little bit I'll be hoarse if we don't so I think we can start preaching let's all stand and turn her Bibles to Galatians the third chapter how many of you love the Lord today amen my goodness it's so good to be in the house of the Lord amen Galatians the third chapter so you love God's word today amen Galatians 3 chapter 26 verse for ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus turn around or Shake somebody's hand say you're a child of God today amen amen we are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus do you love that just morning things for as many as you have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ and there is neither Jew nor Greek there is neither Bond nor free there is neither male nor female for ye are all one in Christ Jesus and if you be Christ then you are Abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise let's just bow our heads Heavenly Father we thank you today that we can speak to the Bride of Jesus Christ the heir of the promises of Abraham the purchase of the blood of Jesus Christ I thank you Lord for this opportunity I don't take it lightly father and I pray that you would bless each one here today Lord I ask oh God that you would watch over the further part of this service Lord If It Be Your Will or we just ask that it'd be another Pentecost father we ask oh God you do exceedingly abundantly father above what we could even think or ask for I ask you to Watch Over Me Lord and bind my lips before I'd speak anything unpleasing to you and will commit it into your hands now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen God bless you you may be seated and all right brother turn to monitors halfway back to where we just came from amen all right so I'm gonna take these glasses off I don't really need the glasses to to read I'm just really dumb and I think the glasses make me look smarter so and I'd like to take a little text this morning on errors according to the promise airs according to the promise and and I come across this a few months ago I was getting together uh the documents needed uh to get a passport for my wife and and we were going to Canada I was holding some meetings up in Saskatoon or or close to Saskatoon and as I got to researching getting the documents together we were missing uh uh her her birth certificate didn't have her parents names on it and so if you've ever tried to get a passport they're really particular about it and there's a given number of things you got to have and if you don't have those things then what they'll do is there's some substitute documents that you can have and so uh I got to research in those substitute documents and I I uh what I found was that you can get many of the documents that you need off of a website called ancestry.com anybody looked at that yeah y'all have well it's probably a gimmick all right but uh it but they got it set up to hook you and so I got in there plugging in my relatives and plugging in you know my father mother and then their parents and and I got to research it and and before you know it I've been on that thing an hour plugging in names and finding out who my uh genealogy was now anybody done that this morning and so so I was I was punching all that stuff in and and uh I come to the the realization saints that I don't really come from much and uh I was a little bit uh discouraged I might be discouraged ain't the right word maybe disappointed it would be the right reason right word is is to say that I didn't come from a religious family would be an understatement Brother David I had to go back 250 years in my genealogy to find any record of anybody that had been baptized or went to church anywhere and so and so to to say I didn't come from very much that's that's an understatement and I I you know what I want if if you children if you are born into a message home you are blessed today you're a blessed person to be born into the message of the hour it's it's a blessing to be but to be born into that and if you're but that's just not the hand that I was given it's not how I came up I didn't come up that way that's what I want for my children that's what I want for my grandchildren is to be raised in the message of the hour it's just not what my hand was it's not how I was brought up and and I had to go back 250 years to find anybody that even went to church in my family and so that's how it was but brothers and sisters I'll tell you this Levi paid tithes when he was in the loins of of Abraham is that right and so when Levi came into the into the word and he came into the when he came into the world he he was blessed when he came because of what Abraham had done before him amen and if you and you were born in the message you were blessed when you got here amen if your parents loved the Lord and you were raised in a message home you were blessed when you got here but I'll tell you this Saints if you can't be a Levi you can be an Abraham [Applause] you might not have been born into the best circumstances but you can start the blessing for your home you might not have come into the message of the hour in your home but you can start it for future Generations if there is any amen you can start and you may not be Levi today but you can be Abraham today is that right thanks and we find in our natural lineage and our natural genealogy that we get all kinds of problems that can be passed down into that there's all kinds of things that you can get that are uh unpleasing characteristics from your family saints come on somebody this morning I wish y'all helped me preach a little bit yeah and if you got a especially if you got a background like mine there's all kind of stuff you're going to get and and and you know uh you may not be able to to do anything about some of these negative attributes we find brother Branham in the message talks extensively about it and he talks a lot about complexes and he talks about sickness and infirmity and and these things that can be passed down from generation to generation to generation these things can be passed down to you and I today amen you know and and even if it's not a negative characteristic even if it's not a negative attribute you're going to find Saints as you get older you just do things the way your parents did them I remember seeing my dad do things and thought I will never do that I'll never do that and I have to fight to the nail not to be just like that today there's just things and ways that we have about us they're just they're just it's like our parents it's like your mom it's like your dad it's like your grandparents you just do things you have ways the same and so we find it all this that builds up and and you know like for example when my grandson when he's throwing a fit my wife looks at him and says well he's a more yeah now I'm assuming she's not talking about his rugged good looks I I'm assuming it's this terrible disposition that she's talking about we just got waves come on somebody's got waves and we find in our natural bloodline that we can get complexes and and I know we know about complexes but I don't know if we recognize or realize how much complex is control what we do and how much they impact how we live our life and and you do things subconsciously that you don't realize it and it and it builds up in your life and it just it it changes the way you behave and act and you find it there's many times where things will upset you or things will bother you that don't make no sense why they bother you has anybody here ever been mad and you don't know why you're mad you're just mad about it for something for no reason it's it's a complex it builds up and and it bothers you and it impacts your life and it impacts her relationships and these kind of things and there's no rational reason why and brother Brown says my Christian Brother's sister he say he's talking about somebody had a stubborn complex now now he said stubbornness was a complex now I'm preaching on that I know ain't nobody in this church dealing with that today I'm just telling you like for other churches y'all go tell them about it all right he said come on my Christian brother sister whoever may be now most times when you find people that's got stubborn Spirits it's usually a complex that causes this either they have inherited from a mother father uncle aunt grandmother grandfather somebody like that and if you'll trace it back down through your life he said now I've taken this by experience under discernment because I've met cases on the platform thousands of those that had that spirit and the first thing you know I chase that Spirit right by the sermon and find out that there was a granddaddy or grandmother there was something else back down there and you inherit that by Nature he says now aren't you glad today that there's somebody else you can blame for how weird you are huh yes there's things and ways that you have and things you have to deal with you didn't have nothing to do with Saints it was something but back before you it's passed down and passed down and passed down so some of our weirdness and our own fault it's just yeah but we got to deal with it don't we is that right Saints and so we find also that sickness can be passed down and sickness that runs in families and and and and you find that some people deal with like maybe heart disease or cancer or different things that run in your family and and you know for example all of the Moors all the Moore's family dies of cancer I don't know if it's because of that it runs in our family or because they all smoke like freight trains or or what it is but but we all but these sicknesses can run in our family right and brother Brandt talks about complexes and he talks about his complex and he says let me talk to you about sickness he says because that sickness is an attribute of sin and he said before we had sin we had no sickness and sickness came because of sin and he said maybe not something you've done something that you inherited yeah it wasn't even your sin in some cases and then he goes on talking about a complex and he makes his confession of having a complex and he says that I pray that God will place into my heart that's something that I lost out there in that complex he was talking about you know he preached so hard and the people wouldn't receive it and all of those things and he said he had that complex and then he makes this statement brother Joel he said it's so easy to build a complex so not only do we have complexes that were passed down to us but then we can easily build our own complexes and then we become responsible for some of our own weirdness so you got you got complexes that's coming at you and you got complexes that you build amen right right so we pass these things down and we build new ones and and so I want to look at some of those this morning just so we're clear but brother Brennan talks about all kinds of different complexes and I want to touch a few of them today but if you look into the message it's extensive so it's apparently a big problem and we find that one of the complexes he talked about that was shocking to me was self-pity and he said self-pity is a complex he says a complex self-pity he's talking to a woman he says you're in a pitiful condition then that's really true when you get to pitying yourself and you want everyone to pity you and you pity yourself now Saints we all know somebody let's feel sorry for this self a lot when I said that y'all probably thought of somebody just make sure nobody's thinking about you when I say that you say self-pity well that doesn't seem like a big deal well I'll tell you Saints self-pity complex can stop you from receiving every blessing that God has for you you see self-pity wants attention and you find then that when people want attention what they begin to do is they're scared to receive their healing for example they don't want to receive their healing because they're scared if they get healed people will quit feeling sorry for them now if we'll be honest we've all come to the point in our life where we have just established that day that we don't feel good maybe we already called in sick to work Brother David and we don't want to be healed come on come on that's a complex now everybody likes somebody to feel sorry for them right everybody likes that a sensation everybody likes that feeling all right now your husband you know when you when you hurt you like your back sore your back's tired or something you go home you want Mama to feel sorry for you come on now the more house ain't the right place to go for that but it can stop it you say well I don't believe that brother George I don't believe that self-pity can stop my blessing well let me read it to you brother Brown says notice I want to Mark in your remembrance he said of course it's on tape here aren't you glad that it's on tapes that's worse you don't have to just take my word for it you can shake it for yourself I'm glad we got the taste today I'm glad we got some we can go back to in reference he said of course it's on tape here now the one thing that's the matter with the people that they don't get healed it's not because that he said look I've wondered here sets one Hill here sets another one notch Linger on and on and on here's another one here's another one and he said there's something wrong somewhere and I think it's this it's a complex that people build up especially people who's been sick a while he's sitting out now he said you'll resent this when I tell you but it's true now see that's why I like the message thanks sometimes it hurts and sometimes it cuts but it's always true see come on yeah he said you'll resent it when I tell you this he said but and he said this he said you'll resent it when I tell you but it's true he said you take a child that's been petted that child becomes to a place till it just wants to be petted it builds up a complex he said he said you can't do nothing with that child until you shake him right good he said now that's the same thing when a person gets sick they become self-pityed he says oh Mom in such a condition oh I've prayed for the people that say well I don't believe I I feel any better he said you'll never feel any better like that he said that's not it if that's the attitude don't even approach him at all because it's not right in his sight don't have a complex but come with a Burly robust Faith it's a subtle thing God said so that settles it right now he said so he said people listen get healed that and get that one won't this thing gets healed that one doesn't this one gets healed that one does he said a complex builds up where they get self-pity yes come on say sometimes we don't get better because we don't want to and then we claim everything for our own you know like we say well well I'll tell you brother I don't feel too good today my high blood pressure is acting up well it's not my high blood pressure it's the devil's high blood pressure I'm not taking that for myself I don't want you Boxing Around snakes oh my congestive heart pain my kidney problems no no it's not yours that's the devils and we're not taking that box of rattlesnakes hand it right back to him Saints amen brother Brown talks about the relationships that you're in and how the people that you associate with can cause a complex in you yes now he gives the example of the two twin girls he said they were Ube people he said they were real Christians and he said they really believed in God and he said they were Twins and they went to school and he said one twin was a little healthier than the other twin and they said when they go to school the people at school would make fun of them because they didn't go to dances and they didn't drink and it didn't smoke and it didn't do all kinds of evil things and he said to one twin she was so strong that when they tell her she'd say I don't care what they say I'm here to serve the Lord and she say they can go jump in a ditch I think it said River but we ain't really got rivers in Tucson River's got water in them but they call a river in Tucson's a ditch see River's got water in it yeah and so but he said they can go jump in the river I'm here to serve the Lord is that your testimony today I don't care what they do I don't care what they say I'm here to serve the Lord today and and the other one though he said it got to upset her the other twin girl that got to upset her it got to bothering her and they kept making fun of her and they got to bothering her and he said she finally ended up in the insane institution yeah he said she went insane they had her in the insane Institution for two years of course brother Rand went and prayed for him brought her out so it stands to reason saints that if if the people that we're around can develop complexes in us then we can develop complexes in others come on somebody yeah and I'll tell you Saints as a parent we have to be keenly aware not to develop complexes in our children yeah we got to be real careful or say in front of our kids because we impact the way they think and what they feel and what their opinions of other people right right oh y'all go ahead and get quiet but that's the true Saints that's the truth we got to watch what we say in front of our kids I'll give you the example brother Brown used of Elisha and his she-bears now the prophet of God said that that that they've seen Elijah go up and they didn't know if they believed it or not and their parents will sit at home making fun is that right thanks and he said he said instead of telling them not to say nothing about it he said they were sitting at home and they heard their Papa and Mama sitting at the table laughing one to another and saying no why don't you know said that old Holy Roller was taken up you ever seen anything like that and he said he he goes on talking about that and he said he they called it nonsense and they and they mocked it and they made fun of it and he says then they said because he won't come to our churches see the Elisha wouldn't come to their Church Elisha wouldn't fellowship with they made fun of it see and he said uh caught some kind of Witchcraft or some kind of hoodoo and he made fun of it he said if they'd been taught reverence and respect they'd have walked out there before that prophet of God and ask a prayer for themselves but he said instead they've been talked to Snicker and laughing to make fun about like the children of today he said he said so Elijah uh cursed them Elijah cursed them in the name of the Lord not because of the children listen to this but because of the irreverent parents that has brought the children up that way to disrespect God see they thought they were disrespecting the prophets but actually they were disrespecting God so you got to be careful what you say about God's prophets he said they thought they was disrespecting the prophet but they were actually disrespecting God and he said two sea bears come out and kill 42 of them he said God demands respect and when they disrespect His prophets they disrespect him no matter how much they didn't believe they ought to kept their mouth shut he said that's right what a lesson says and we need to keep our mouth shut sometime don't we and I'll go a step further I don't want to hear any disrespect to God's prophets and I don't want to hear any disrespect to God's servants either come on now amen because it's not the man it's the god in the man amen see they thought they were disrespecting a man but they were actually disrespecting God amen he said Elisha didn't go to their Church you know we get the same kind of ideology in this message and if they don't go to our church and they don't fellowship with our group they're not there oh they got a fellowship here they got a fellowship there they were the best in the world at labeling people yeah oh they go over there I bet you they I bet you they're Thunders I bet they're peruse you I bet you we got all these different names for everybody he preached at that church I bet he believes this I bet he's returned I'll bet he's this and that yeah come well I'll tell you what since I'm not any of those things I'm a Believer today amen I'm not any of those things I just want to believe a message amen man I don't want no labels man that you know what there can be news flash there can be Christians that don't go to our church yes yes there are believers in other churches Brother David can you believe that Saints can you believe it today now we find the same thing in the Bible if you want to jot it down it's Mark the 9th chapter and and in my bowel in my Bible it says it's titled an intolerance rebute and it was John talking to Jesus and he said Master we saw one casting out devils in thy name and he followed not us and we forbade him yeah so they run across a guy casting out Devils Saints now that's a pretty good thing to do isn't it this man was casting out devils in the name of Jesus and Saints we can all use some more people running around casting out devils and he was casting out devils and John said but he didn't go to our church so he said stop doing that you don't go to our church is that right or wrong Saints Mark the 9th chapter 38th verse if you want to look at it he said but Jesus said forbid him not yeah for there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name that can lightly speak evil of me well he that is not against us is on our part yes yeah amen if they ain't bothering us leave them alone if they're doing the work for the Lord leave them alone they don't go to our church leave them alone if they're not against us they're for us amen so we passed a lot of judgment don't we say you know we impact the way other believers feel about other believers we impact I think we'll all say we're guilty of having an opinion or an idea about somebody that we don't even know based on something we've heard somebody else say come on we feel like this church believes that or this church believes that or that brother there he goes over there Saints I'll tell you this I've been around long enough to know if you didn't see it for yourself you don't know [Applause] come on somebody they'll be preach this morning now we don't know I don't know what goes on another church I'm not there I don't know what goes on over here I'm not there [Music] and if you repeat things that other people say you can be found guilty of repeating somebody else's ignorance try oh come on preach ER brother Brown said fear was accomplice too yeah yeah he said there's a lady sitting here suffering with the fear a complex of fear upon her and I'll tell you Saints it surprises me how many people we got that are afraid in this message today we don't serve a fear-based religion this is not about fear I don't love the Lord because I'm scared he'll send me to hell I don't live the message because I'm scared I'm going to be punished I'm not trying to avoid judgment today I love the Lord today I love him today's thanks I serve him because I love him because of what he did for me he changed my life thanks [Music] amen he died for me so I want to live for him not because I'm scared I'll go to hell not because I'm scared he's going to be disappointed I love the Lord you love the Lord we don't do what we do because we're scared we're doing what we do because we love him and if you love somebody you don't want to disappoint them right if you love somebody you want to you want to do everything you can to make them happy too much legalism too much fear base come on come on you know the devil uses our desire to be a True Believer against us yeah yeah the devil uses our desire to be the perfect will of the Lord to scare us to death yeah or don't go over there that might not be in the Lord's willing he has people running around all over the place you know there's Believers in the message today that are scared to listen to the wrong tape they're scared to listen to a tape because it might be the wrong taste you know what the easiest job in all the world is to pick out a good tape yeah yeah look here thanks look you don't have to be afraid you can close your eyes and pick a tape and when you get it it's gonna be all it's the word of God [Applause] close your eyes again grab another wow it's the word of God you don't have to be scared of what tape to listen to all right come on you don't open your Bible and think oh I don't want to read the wrong scripture today us the word of God let me look at this page it's the word of God is that right thanks we don't have to be afraid of what we listen to or easiest job in all the worlds pick a good tape uh there are people they're afraid to go to church right yeah they're scared to go to church they're scared they might go to the wrong Church they're scared the preacher might say something wrong yeah it's like if the preacher's saying something that you don't agree with causes you to throw your hands up and walk away you got bigger problems than that yeah afraid to go to church you know what it isn't God that wants to keep people out of church I'll tell you that it's not the spirit of Christ they want people to stay home yeah come on somebody yeah God wants you to come to church it's the program of God it's never changed it's always been this way and then we gather this is the New Testament church today yeah well come on Amen We Gather here in the house of the Lord we praise the lord we sing songs amen amen is that what we do sex and somebody preaches the word yes uh we don't need to over complicate that we don't need to be afraid Saints people afraid some people are afraid to hear a preacher preaching the gospel is the will of the Lord Saints yes people get a fair complex on them and it'll even stop them from receiving the Holy Ghost yes yes they won't they although they'll be scared to get the Holy Ghost because they're afraid oh they don't look fanatical yeah yeah they're afraid to praise the Lord because they don't want to look fanatical they get they get scared you shout too loud and they don't want to be fanatical preach amen say so I know what I'm shouting about yeah I know what I'm happy about I know what God did for me yes sir amen I'm not just I'm not delusional today I'm I'm happy today man I'm not trying to work nothing up but I'll tell you when I think about what God did for me it makes me happy when I think about the goodness of God it creates an emotion in me right or wrong Saints creates an emotion so how do you know what the will of the Lord is well brother Brown said his will is his word that's right so if you went over to the will of the Lord or not is it in the word because it's in the word it's his will yes we don't have to over complicate it that's right yeah now brother Brown said now she's a true bride was so sold out to him that she uses no mind of her own his mind of course is his will and his will is his word Brothers so another complex that stops us from getting anywhere with God is the complex of pride yes Pride he said there's another little door called Pride he says oh what a horrible little black devil is all pinned up in the heart of pride yeah now like brother Joel said you just don't feed that devil y'all gonna get that in a minute come on it's just thinking you're better than somebody else how in the world says can we ever feel like we're better against somebody else says there ain't one thing we did since there's not one thing that we did to be here today right that's not one thing we had to do with it there's not one thing you can do to see this message there's not one thing you can do to believe it it's ordered of the Lord God did that for you if you see this today you're blessed you're not better than somebody you didn't do nothing you didn't work your way into it God just blessed you with it he gave it to you God gave it to us Saints we didn't do anything to deserve it I wasn't looking for God he came looking for me yeah how could we ever feel better than someone I don't ever want to get to myself to a place to where I'm so good so high so mighty that I can't talk to a sinner yeah I don't get so religious that I can't be associated with somebody now why would anybody want to be around somebody like this how would we ever win somebody to the Lord how do we ever witness to somebody and treating them like we're better than them it's not one thing we did Saints not one thing we did come on oh God he did it all Jesus Paid It all all to him I owe yes he did it yeah thank you Lord says well I I wouldn't send my children over there they don't dress right the people that goes there isn't my class he says if Christ is Lord in your heart you're all one class because of one spirit we're all baptized into one body Pride feels just a little complex that we have and he says you don't want Jesus to touch that because it would degrade your social standing in the community there's a striking here Saints he said I'd rather degrade my social standing in the community than to rub my name off of the Lamb's Book of Life old man yeah you know people can get so proud yeah that they're almost ashamed to mention this message yeah they're almost as scared you know people say well where do you go to church at well um I'm non-denominational no we're not non-denominational Saints we believe a message come on somebody yeah I'm not ashamed of this message I'm not ashamed of what God did for me thank you Lord people get so proud they're too proud to yield to the Holy Ghost yes yes they get so proud that if the spirit of God can be moving and they won't yield to it because it scares somebody might look at them yeah they're scared to pry themselves up out of the chair one time yeah scare somebody to think something about them saints if you're here to Worship the Lord that's your focus don't worry about what anybody else thinks don't worry about what everybody else says make yo jump in the river I'm here to serve the Lord I'm here to Worship the Lord I don't care if they like it or not David said I'll tell you what you hide and watch come on yeah come on back tomorrow if you want to see some more of it yeah yeah we're not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ I'm not ashamed to worship the god the in a way that's called heresy that's the way I worship the god of my father amen we get so prideful we're scared to yield to The Holy Spirits we become starchy brother Brown says you cannot come starchy you can't come start you think about it says if you're blessed to hunger and thirst after righteousness to hunger and thirst that's a righteousness you're blessed just to have that desire now think about if you'd been about four or five days without anything to eat yeah and and you looked up here and I had a big fine steak and a nice glass of water for you up here don't tell me you're going to come dignified after four days and not eating right you desperation will strike after four days of not eaten desperation strikes and you forget everything else going on and your sole focus is on getting something to eat yes it's all you can think about that's the way we got to get with God yeah yeah but instead we get to be at kind of half-mast Christians yes you know half-mast where you can get to about right here or so yeah come on thanks I'll take a holy ghost service over anything else in the world I'll take a holy ghost service over in it if you offered me a trip to Disneyland or a holy ghost service I'll take a holy ghost service a hundred times out of a hundred I don't just want to live a message live on Sunday it is my life Saints I ain't got no other Hobbies all right this is my life this is what I live for I don't also come to church the church is my life that's good yes and I'll take this over anything else because this is eternal life this is better than vacation this is this is better than entertainments this is eternal life I love it I love to be in the atmosphere I love to be in the house of God I love to come and fellowship I love it do you love it this morning and we got people so proud they're so proud there's two proud to even humble themselves to sit under a Ministry yeah yeah that's true yeah I'll tell you since if you're a believer in this message and you say you're a Believer and you don't go to church and you don't have a pastor I would question your experience and now today we've gotten into the habit I guess maybe with the Advent of the streaming and so forth to where many Believers are claiming somebody else as their pastor I'm on preach say it's your pastor he don't live 12 hours away he don't live on the other side of the country he he don't let your pastor goes to church with you am I off base here Brother David am I looking at something wrong I can't my I can't claim my pastor my pastor needs to know who I am okay all right brother so and so that I've never met can't be my pastor amen I can stream his Services every Sunday I can listen to him preach that don't make him my pastor amen our question does he even know your name does he know who you are and you say well well no brother George I don't have that Pastor like well brother Branham is my pastor and I hear that in a lot brother Branham is my pastor well okay I'll go with you on that because Elijah was Jezebel's Pastor is that right we know that all right well let's look at what your pastor says then yeah come oh yeah let's just look at what your pastor said man his arm and spirit he says a new testament Prophet is a preacher he said we all know that just any Minister that's a preacher is a prophet now look that's true but that ain't the same kind of prophet like brother Brown a new testament Prophet if he's prophesying preaching not to try to edify himself or make a big name or to edify his organization which he should be in an organization now now context is critically important so don't leave out of here and say what brother Branch said join an organization he says here I am without one but yet preaching you should be that's right every man ought to have a church home yeah you ought to have a place not just to float about from Pillar To Post but have somewhere that you go to church and you call it your church somewhere where you pay your tithes and somewhere you help support the cause take your choice but then don't never disfellowship the other man because he don't belong to your group see discern his spirit and see if he's got the same purpose in his heart then you got fellowship with one another yes yeah you're working for one great cause that's the cause of Christ yes so so the Pastor said find your church go to it support yeah yes but see people don't want nobody tell them what to do that's right they don't want to listen to nobody come on they don't want nobody holding them accountable yeah yeah they won't do what they want to do yeah yeah they don't want to answer to nobody yeah yeah so so it's Pride Saints it's Pride that keeps people from doing that people people can get to where they don't want anybody to tell them what to do since if you go to a church very long and you've been going there for a while and you've never been condemned you're going to the wrong Church come on free that's TV preaching that's what that is come on I go to the house the Lord to be corrected since I you know what it don't feel good at the time I don't always like it but I like the results of it yes I need it Saints I I need to be corrected amen I like the results of it because my desire is I want to be a better Christian today than I was yesterday man people get kind of territorial in churches sometimes though and they get to where they got you know they got their own territory that they kind of Patrol and and you know one sister she got the she got the cake decorating Ministry and any cake that gets decorated in this church I'm the one that does it don't know come on don't nobody ever fight over the church vacuuming Ministry we'll get proud yeah well you're proud you know what Saints you can't have enough gifts in the church that's right you can't have enough musicians you can't have enough good preachers you can't have enough good Sunday school teachers you can't have enough good people say yeah come on if God's blessing the church say Amen thank the Lord nobody can take your place nobody can do what you do there's no amen like you're amen amen there's no handshake like your handshake there's no hug like your heart nobody can take your place nobody can do what you do we don't have to be proud we don't have to be come on preach how many of you a little lower this morning amen Amen brother Brown said in that stubbornness complex I'm gonna finish that quote here just as we uh as we finish up he says stubbornness is not of God he said and now the only way to get away from that is you have to have faith to overcome that you're a Christian you're a son and daughter of God which whatever you may be and you'll never be able to just stand and rebuke it and rebuke it and rebuke it it's like tantalizing a rattlesnake he said he says it's laying there ready to bite you right he says if you'll just ignore him and walk away from him he can't hurt you see so when you feel that you got a stubborn Spirit lay the thing on the Altar and believe that God that the thing is dead and you'll never have it no more and go on and don't even pay any attention to it no more and the thing will leave you resist the devil and he will flee from you yes so there's a lot of complexes we deal with there's a lot of them that's been passed down to us right there's a lot of them that we develop ourselves and they're working in our lives and we're dealing with them so they said you know in in marriages you deal with them the husband can't understand what the wife's talking about because it's not his complex the wife can't understand what the husband's talking about because it's not her complex it's it's individual complexes you find you deal with it in churches brother Randolph said we gotta get over one another's peculiarities and we have to deal with these things we have we and we do deal with them saints but we don't have to be subject to them yeah yeah that's right Brothers said they get complexes he says you don't get no complex by the blood of Jesus Christ you get love yeah see we don't have to accept these complexes we might have dealt with them we might have been passed down some we might have developed our own but we don't have to accept them yeah now the Bible says it and I'm I'm gonna you can turn them if you want to Genesis the 12th chapter now heirs according to the promise everybody says you're Abraham's seed and your heirs according to the promise yes yes your heirs according problems we talk about that all the time but do we ever really look at some of the promises that Abraham was given now in Genesis the 12th chapter uh the first verse the Lord said to Abram he said get thee out of thy country and from thy Kindred and from thy Father's House unto a land that will I will show thee so the very first promise that God made to Abraham was the promise of the promised land yes now to you and I that's the Holy Ghost come on somebody yeah y'all got to know that our promised land today is the Holy Ghost is that right thanks is that message teaching right there our promised land is the Holy Ghost Saints the Holy Ghost is a promise to you your heirs according to the promise yes and I will make of thee a great nation and I will bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing so the second promise that God made Abraham the first thing he promised was the promised land the second thing was a Godly heritage he promised not somebody else's loins out of you I will make a great nation now to you and I that's the token God has promised you your family come on somebody yeah God has promised your family God has promised the Holy Ghost yes God has promised your family yes yes third verse and I will bless them that bless thee and curse them that curse thee and in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed so the third promise God made Abraham he promised him the Holy Ghost he promised the token the third promise was he promised blessing upon his life he promised that he would fight his battles for him and blessed I Will Bless thee yes yes and I will curse those that curse thee yes yes see we need to let go and get out of God's way sometimes yes and let God handle it amen he promised he would handle it he promised he would do it for us y'all believe that today and in my heavenly lineage brothers and sisters there were all kinds of blessings passed down not in my natural image but in my heavenly in my heavenly letters when I took on Jesus Christ I became Heir yeah and in my heavenly lineage all kinds of blessings am I am I Earthly lineage I got complexes I got sickness I got nervousness I got all kinds of negative attributes but in my heavenly letters I gotta heal I got overcoming power I got salvation I got eternal life I got the family saved I got hope I got joy I got peace I got goodness I got Temperance I got journalists I got patience yes is that right thanks and my heavenly lineage supersedes my natural language amen that's good now let me reach this quote he said when Jesus atoned for sin he killed sin and every one of its attributes now there's another quote where brother Brown said if you're fighting a dragon or a large reptile he said he said and you're fighting him and he said he's got his claw in your side digging at your side you got two choices you can attack the claw yeah yeah or you can knock it in the head and it'll take care of the claw yeah see Jesus knocked it in the head now we're busy treating symptoms yeah we're busy treating oh I got this going on I got that going on Jesus knocked it in the head he said he killed sin and every one of its attributes he killed the serpent from his head now this is a quote that struck me he says then if he atoned for sin he atoned for sickness it could because sickness is secondarily an attribute of sin our worry our troubles our fears and all those things are attributes from sin so not only did he atone for our complexes not only did he turn for our sin not only did he turn for our sickness but it's all for our worry it's on for fear he had told for our stubbornness yeah thank you Lord good preaching any atone for those complexes too yeah now the devil likes to tell you this let's say you come from a family like mine or or you've got some kind of history in your family maybe you maybe your father had some kind of mental issue or nervousness or something and maybe his father had some kind of mental issue or nervousness or something then what the devil likes to do is every time you get upset the devil says you're going to be just like your father that's right you're going to turn out just like he did you're gonna I bet you're getting mental illness too I I bet you're getting nervousness too I I bet or let's say you got some kind of let's say you got some kind of family disease that runs in your family maybe you got heart disease runs in your family or maybe you got cancer or something runs in your family and and you know you maybe your maybe your father had cancer and his father had cancer and his father had cancer then every little pain or ache or a little feeling you get yeah the devil tells you I bet you got cancer oh that's true yeah well you know what the devil's right you are going to turn out like your father oh my God Hallelujah you're gonna turn out just like yours yeah you're gonna walk like he walks you don't talk like he talks his words will proceed out of your mouth The Works that he did you'll do also glory to God the works he did he'll do also when he laid hands on his sick they recovered when you lay hands on a stick they'll recover Y when you pray it'll come to pass when you say to this mountain you'll turn out just like him yes when he had love you'll have love when he gave peace you'll get peace just like your father and all the blessings of God or but watch how powerful the blood of Jesus Christ is he says if you have an inbred weakness from some sickness that you inherited from your peoples back in Generations he said we each one are growing weaker and wiser he said the blood of Jesus Christ atoned for that at Calvary see if your grandfather had cancer and your father had cancer Jesus atoned for that that's Calvary you ain't got no cancer right he says sickness to say the devil and sickness is an attribute of sin because of sin we had sickness not because maybe you sinned but something that come down through the generations he visited even to the third and fourth generation but the blood of Jesus Christ taken away sin and taken away sickness so so your father was nervous and you and your grandfather was nervous and your great-grandfather was nervous Jesus atoned for that at Calvary you ain't got no nervousness yeah that's good yes sir he said you're all children of Abraham the Bible said so and we've been dead in Christ take on Abraham's seed and her heirs according to the promise we're heirs to the promise that Abraham because Abraham was given the promise now if we are his heirs with Abraham then we are Abraham's children and the same faith that Abraham had we have ourselves and when God makes a promise just know it's going to happen they say I ain't got no faith brother George he said you did he said you got the faith of Abraham Are you standing in the promises of God today it's going to happen you need a token applied it's gonna happen you need a holy ghost it's going to happen oh God you need the fruits of the spirit it's gonna happen you need love joy it's going to happen it ain't your family saved it's gonna happen to be delivered from fear or anxiety or depression is going to happen [Music] right you're an heir yes sir
