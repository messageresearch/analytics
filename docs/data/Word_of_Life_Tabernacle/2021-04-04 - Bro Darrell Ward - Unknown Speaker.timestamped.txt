[32:39] coming to him saying master we would
[32:42] that thou
[32:43] should do for us whatsoever we shall
[32:46] desire

[32:50] i should do for you
[32:54] and they said unto him grant unto us
[32:56] that we may sit on thy right hand
[32:58] and the other on thy left hand in thy
[33:01] glory

[33:39] with
[33:40] shall ye be baptized
[33:44] amen let us bow our heads i want to
[33:46] speak to you for a few minutes this
[33:48] evening on
[33:49] ye shall indeed
[33:55] heavenly father
[33:59] lord we are so grateful this evening to
[34:02] gather
[34:03] here in your name
[34:06] and lord it's with thanksgiving in our
[34:08] hearts
[34:10] that we come before you in prayer
[34:15] for lord in this time of the season that
[34:17] we are in of easter
[34:21] it means so much to us lord
[34:25] it wasn't enough that you were born
[34:29] it wasn't enough that you ministered and
[34:31] did miracles
[34:33] it wasn't even enough that you went to
[34:35] calvary and died
[34:38] for lord if you had not raised
[34:40] hallelujah
[34:42] we would still be lost in our sins
[34:45] but oh god easter means so much to us
[34:49] lord because we can point to an empty
[34:52] tomb lord
[34:54] knowing that the grave could not hold
[34:56] you and the life that you lived
[34:58] has been sent back upon the church lord
[35:01] and father i pray tonight in this hour
[35:04] that we're living in lord
[35:07] may our understanding of our hearts lord
[35:09] be
[35:10] illuminated by your word
[35:13] that we could see who we are in the word
[35:16] lord
[35:17] for your prophet taught us dear god that
[35:20] you had perfect faith
[35:21] when you were here because you knew who
[35:23] you were in the word
[35:26] and oh god may we see tonight that we
[35:29] are not
[35:30] church members dear god we are not an
[35:33] organization or a denomination but we
[35:35] are sons and daughters of god
[35:38] we are your people lord in the
[35:40] workmanship of your hand
[35:43] i pray father tonight may the same
[35:45] anointing that raise my lord from the
[35:47] grave
[35:48] may that same anointing tonight move
[35:50] upon every need that's in this building
[35:53] lord
[35:54] that when we leave the service may we
[35:56] say did not our hearts burn within us
[36:00] for you vindicated your presence among
[36:02] us lord
[36:03] bless brother ben the officers of the
[36:05] church bless the ministers that are here
[36:07] lord we ask
[36:08] that you bless their ministries in a
[36:10] great way use them dear god
[36:12] in this last day that the world once
[36:14] more may know that you're the same
[36:15] yesterday today and forever
[36:18] lord i surrender myself into your hands
[36:22] may you use me tonight we pray for we
[36:24] ask these things in jesus name
[36:26] and the bride says amen god bless you
[36:30] since you may be seated
[36:35] you know i am so happy what easter means
[36:37] for us
[36:39] and what easter has done for us
[36:42] you see to the world easter is about
[36:44] bunnies and
[36:45] coloring eggs and chocolate eggs and all
[36:49] the things that they do and hanging eggs
[36:51] on a tree
[36:51] that's the world's interpretation of
[36:53] easter but easter means much more
[36:55] than that to us amen
[36:59] but easter is the promise that we hold
[37:01] in our heart of the resurrection amen
[37:04] that the life he lived could be sent
[37:06] back to us
[37:08] and i am so glad that we can point to an
[37:10] empty tomb today and say he
[37:12] is not there and we they can say
[37:16] how do you know he's not there i know
[37:18] he's not in that tomb
[37:20] because he is in my heart amen
[37:24] making himself the same yesterday today
[37:27] and forever
[37:29] now in our scripture reading this
[37:30] evening we find in the bible there are
[37:33] two accounts of this event
[37:35] mark says it was james and john who
[37:37] asked jesus this question
[37:40] and matthew says it was their mother
[37:42] that asked jesus
[37:44] this question but both matthew and mark
[37:47] they both agree that it was james and
[37:50] john
[37:50] who answered we can and i believe this
[37:55] evening that
[37:55] every person in this building by faith
[37:58] and the grace of almighty god tonight
[38:00] that we can answer the same question
[38:03] with we can
[38:05] amen we can cast out devils we can live
[38:08] a godly life
[38:09] we can't overcome laodicea
[38:12] amen we can
[38:16] now we find in this passage that they
[38:18] were asking
[38:19] a question they were desiring a position
[38:22] in his kingdom
[38:23] one was wanting to sit in his right hand
[38:25] and the other was wanting to sit in his
[38:27] left hand
[38:28] and jesus said unto them you don't know
[38:30] what you're asking
[38:32] you want to be a part of this kingdom
[38:34] you want to be a part of this program
[38:36] you want to be a part of what's
[38:38] happening
[38:40] he said can you drink of this cup that i
[38:43] drink can you be
[38:44] baptized with this baptism that i am
[38:46] baptized with
[38:48] notice he never sent a cup he never said
[38:52] a cup
[38:53] he said this cup and he never said a
[38:56] baptism
[38:57] but he said this baptism
[39:00] this cup this baptism
[39:04] the same cup the same baptism and they
[39:07] said we can
[39:09] and jesus said ye shall
[39:13] not maybe not could be not hope so but
[39:16] ye shall indeed
[39:20] amen
[39:23] and be baptized with this baptism yes
[39:29] amen the same cup
[39:32] the same baptism jesus said ye shall
[39:36] indeed that ought to give every one of
[39:39] us courage tonight
[39:40] that ought to give every one of us faith
[39:42] tonight that jesus said we can
[39:47] like elijah and elisha in the bible
[39:50] elisha followed him for 10
[39:52] years and it came to pass that when
[39:55] elijah was going to leave the scene
[39:57] he asked elisha what do you want from me
[40:03] you followed me all these years what do
[40:05] you want
[40:07] notice what elisha said he didn't say i
[40:10] want the
[40:10] i want your ministry but he said i want
[40:13] a double portion
[40:15] of your ministry
[40:19] and elijah said you have asked a hard
[40:21] thing
[40:23] but nevertheless if you see me when i go
[40:27] you shall come on
[40:30] there's that word again ye shall
[40:35] have what you asked for so what did it
[40:39] do and he like
[40:39] it called elisha to have a singleness of
[40:42] mine
[40:42] a scenario survive a singleness of
[40:45] motive a singleness of purpose
[40:47] and that was to keep his eyes on elijah
[40:52] and when elijah went up elisha began to
[40:55] cry out
[40:56] you promised me
[40:59] that i could have the ministry that you
[41:01] had a double portion of it
[41:04] and down out of heaven came the mantle
[41:08] the same mantle that elijah struck the
[41:11] water
[41:11] and the water parted and he went over
[41:14] now elisha picks up the same mantle
[41:18] not amen mantle but the same mantle
[41:23] and he goes back to the same water with
[41:26] the same mantle
[41:27] with the same anointing
[41:31] and he strikes the water same water
[41:35] same god come on
[41:40] same anointing same metal and he got the
[41:43] same results
[41:46] he stuck the water he said where is the
[41:49] god of elijah
[41:52] he wasn't asking a question he was
[41:54] making a statement
[41:57] where is the god that anointed elijah
[42:00] where is the god that anointed jesus
[42:02] christ he's in the bride today amen
[42:08] where is the god of elijah he was making
[42:10] a statement
[42:11] the same god that was with elijah it's
[42:13] now with elisha amen
[42:16] took the same mantle to the same water
[42:18] with the same god
[42:20] and got the same results because it was
[42:23] the same ministry
[42:25] elijah did four great miracles elisha
[42:28] done eight a double portion
[42:32] you see greater
[42:36] not in quality
[42:40] not in quality because he's parted the
[42:42] same water
[42:44] elijah did with the same anointing
[42:51] so it wasn't a greater quality but it
[42:54] was a greater
[42:55] quality more works than this shall you
[42:59] do
[43:00] elijah done for elisha danny showed he
[43:03] had a double portion
[43:06] of the same ministry look at ruth and
[43:08] boaz
[43:09] ruth followed the instructions of naomi
[43:12] she goes down to the threshing floor
[43:14] in the barley season naomi said cover
[43:16] yourself
[43:17] go down there mark the spot where he
[43:19] lays and when he lays down
[43:21] you lay down at his feet
[43:25] amen and about the midnight hour boaz
[43:28] awoke
[43:29] there's a lot of people awakening amen
[43:32] in the midnight hour boaz awoke
[43:36] and he said who's here who's here who's
[43:39] there
[43:40] and she said it's ruth
[43:45] thy handmaid spread thy skirt thy
[43:48] garment
[43:48] spread thy garment over me for thou art
[43:51] a near
[43:52] kinsman and boaz spread his
[43:55] garment over ruth not another garment
[43:59] the same garment
[44:06] amen and the bible said she rose up
[44:09] early in the morning
[44:10] and he said take your veil and he
[44:12] measured out six
[44:13] barleys of pure wheat
[44:17] one barley one measure for each day
[44:27] you said that wrong one one measure for
[44:30] one day first
[44:31] each day you said six he got six
[44:33] measures they're supposed to be seven
[44:36] well but you see he only gave her a
[44:38] measure for the first six days
[44:40] the sabbath day she didn't get a measure
[44:43] she got the lord of the harvest amen
[44:48] oh don't you see where we're at for us
[44:50] all that luther had all that wesley had
[44:52] all that pentecost said we are the
[44:54] fullness of the church ages amen
[44:58] hallelujah we don't get a measure in
[45:00] this hour
[45:01] we get healed amen
[45:07] the two the two becoming one
[45:11] the lord of the harvest the two becoming
[45:13] one
[45:14] she laid at his feet with the same
[45:16] garment he was covered with
[45:18] elijah and elijah shared the same robe
[45:20] bow as a roof share of the same garment
[45:22] and jesus turned to james and john he
[45:25] said can you drink
[45:27] of the same cup that i drink from
[45:32] and they said we can
[45:36] he said to them can you share in what i
[45:39] am partaking of
[45:40] can you be a part of this
[45:44] and they said yes
[45:48] yes we can
[45:53] what is the cup can you drink of this
[45:56] cup i drink from
[45:57] what is this cup he was asking can you
[46:00] drink of this cup i'm drinking for him
[46:02] what is the cup we get a glimpse of it
[46:07] in the garden of gethsemane when praying
[46:09] to the father he prayed to the father
[46:12] lord if it be possible take this cup
[46:16] for me
[46:19] don't make me drink this cup
[46:24] what is this cup and then after
[46:28] praying until he sweat till his blood
[46:30] become his sweat become great droplets
[46:32] of blood
[46:33] because he was sweating it out in the
[46:35] garden of gethsemane
[46:36] calvary was not an easy thing because he
[46:39] went there as a man
[46:42] the only time in the bible you'll ever
[46:44] find that jesus will was ever
[46:46] was ever even come into play ever come
[46:48] into view it was always the will of the
[46:50] father
[46:50] but here in the garden of gethsemane
[46:52] when he sweating it out after the
[46:54] anointing had left him he said father
[46:56] your god you can do anything
[47:01] don't make me drink this cup
[47:05] what is this cup the prophet said it is
[47:11] a cup
[47:12] of bitter persecution
[47:15] he was a man of sorrow
[47:20] acquainted with grief
[47:26] jesus never said we wouldn't have sorrow
[47:28] he never said we would not have grief
[47:31] he never said that come on
[47:36] this cup that he drank of the bible said
[47:38] a man of sorrow
[47:40] acquainted with grief he was called
[47:42] beelzebub
[47:45] he was told he had a devil
[47:49] he was mocked made fun of rejected
[47:53] lied on persecuted killed
[47:58] it is a cup of persecution it is the cup
[48:00] of rejection
[48:01] by the world
[48:05] are you hearing me this cup he drank
[48:07] from
[48:08] it it's a cup of rejection by the world
[48:11] humiliation
[48:12] by the world a cup of bitterness a cup
[48:16] of ridicule
[48:16] a cup of hatred the cup
[48:20] of death
[48:24] that's the cup he drank from a cup of
[48:27] bitter persecution
[48:28] a cup of humiliation where they stripped
[48:30] him off naked
[48:31] and hunky between the heavens and earth
[48:34] and he watered there in his own blood
[48:36] till they strapped him and tore great
[48:38] pieces of flesh from his body
[48:40] that was the cup he was drinking from
[48:45] and he asked him can you drink this
[48:49] cup a
[49:01] can you drink this cup sometimes the
[49:04] prophet said the torture
[49:05] sometimes the torture that a sign has to
[49:08] go through
[49:09] is amazing the torture that jesus went
[49:12] through
[49:13] to prove the sign of god
[49:16] the torture he went through to prove he
[49:19] was
[49:20] the messiah
[49:24] come on a cup of persecution
[49:28] the cup of rejection yeah
[49:31] come on yes this disciples
[49:36] can you drink this cup and they said we
[49:39] can
[49:40] we can we can bear the reproach
[49:45] and he said ye shall
[49:48] indeed
[49:51] drink this cup
[49:59] and they did
[50:05] they did they said we can
[50:08] he said you shall and they did drink of
[50:12] that cup
[50:14] even to the point that paul said after
[50:17] his confirm
[50:18] his conversion he said well you have
[50:19] heard of my conversation in times past
[50:21] in the jews religion how that beyond
[50:23] measure
[50:24] i persecuted the church of god and
[50:27] wasted it
[50:29] they were thrown in jail they were
[50:31] beaten they were persecuted
[50:33] all drinking from the same cup
[50:37] the apostles said they returned
[50:38] rejoicing because they were counted
[50:40] worthy
[50:41] to bear the reproach of his name
[50:45] look at the disciples look at him they
[50:47] drank from that cup
[50:48] he drank from because he said you shall
[50:51] indeed
[50:52] drink of this cup matthew was killed by
[50:55] a sword in ethiopia
[50:56] mark died in egypt after being dragged
[50:58] by horses through the street till he was
[51:00] dead
[51:01] luke was hanged in greece john was
[51:03] boiled in oil
[51:04] sentenced to the isle of aleppatmus he's
[51:08] the only one that died of old age
[51:10] he topped the bride
[51:15] they tried their best to kill john but
[51:17] they couldn't
[51:19] and john taps the bride amen
[51:23] peter was crucified upside down james
[51:26] was thrown off the roof of the church
[51:28] and when they found that he didn't
[51:29] that that didn't kill him they beat him
[51:32] to death
[51:34] with clubs james the son of zebedee
[51:37] was beheaded at jerusalem his guard
[51:40] was so moved by james's faith
[51:43] that he repented and declared his faith
[51:46] in christ
[51:47] and was beheaded with james
[51:51] james in the midst of bitter persecution
[51:54] had such a testimony
[51:55] that the one who was guarding him
[51:58] converted to christianity
[52:00] and died beside james oh god give me
[52:03] that kind of testimony
[52:09] oh my god bartholomew was beat to death
[52:14] with a whip
[52:15] andrew was crucified thomas was stabbed
[52:17] to death with a spear in india
[52:19] jew was killed by arrows mathias was
[52:21] stoned
[52:22] and then beheaded drinking
[52:26] from the same cup the cup of bitter
[52:28] persecution
[52:29] the cup of rejection the cup of death
[52:32] why
[52:33] because they were christians
[52:38] prophet said not only is a candlestick
[52:40] of gold it is a beaten code
[52:42] handcrafted of beaten goat according to
[52:43] her blueprints which are spirit given
[52:45] outside of her lord and master jesus
[52:47] christ was ever a people so beaten and
[52:49] purged
[52:50] as the bride of jesus christ surely it's
[52:52] just fulfilling the suffering that
[52:54] christ has left behind
[52:55] her goods are disposed her life is in
[52:57] jeopardy she's accounted a sheep for the
[52:59] slaughter
[53:00] she is killed all the day long she
[53:02] suffers much
[53:03] but it all retaliates retaliates not
[53:06] neither does she cause others to suffer
[53:09] worthy
[53:10] of the gospel is this lovely bride of
[53:13] christ
[53:14] and as gold is a malleable whereas brass
[53:16] will break with the beating
[53:18] this gold of god
[53:21] will bear her suffering for the lord
[53:26] not bowed not broken not destroyed
[53:31] but formed as a thing of beauty and a
[53:34] joy
[53:35] forever formed
[53:38] as a thing of beauty formed as a thing
[53:42] of beauty
[53:43] and joy forever by the trials
[53:46] and the testings of this life
[53:50] ye shall indeed drink but the trials
[53:53] and the testings and the persecution and
[53:56] the hatred
[53:56] does not destroy us but it molds us and
[54:00] shapes us
[54:00] into a thing of beauty
[54:04] the bible said he had no beauty they
[54:06] needed to desire him
[54:07] where is his beauty i'm looking at it
[54:10] you are the beauty of the lord amen
[54:16] he shall indeed drink
[54:22] many people are think that christians
[54:24] god loves us
[54:26] god loves us therefore we should never
[54:28] be sick
[54:29] we should never have heartache or sorrow
[54:33] we should never have to bury loved ones
[54:36] we should never have to come on somebody
[54:38] we should never have to bury our
[54:39] children our wives our husbands
[54:43] we're god's people we follow his message
[54:46] we believe his prophet
[54:51] we should never have battles we should
[54:53] never be faced with pandemics
[54:55] we should always be blue skies smooth
[54:57] sailing everything should just be
[55:00] beautiful just a picnic
[55:03] want a little bit more ice cream
[55:08] but you see that's lovely that is a
[55:10] lovely picture
[55:11] but the only problem is jesus never
[55:14] said that he never said we wouldn't be
[55:17] persecuted he never said we wouldn't be
[55:19] mocked and laughed at
[55:21] and hated and recued and ridiculed he
[55:23] never said
[55:24] we wouldn't get sick he never said we
[55:27] wouldn't battle cancer
[55:28] but he did say no matter what you face i
[55:31] will never leave you
[55:33] nor will i forsake you
[55:35] [Applause]
[55:38] many times we are led to that spot why
[55:41] is it
[55:42] if i go to church and i live before god
[55:44] with all my heart
[55:45] and i try to be just an honest person
[55:47] and all that christianity requires
[55:49] why is it that these things happen but
[55:52] you know
[55:53] many times they are blessings
[55:56] in disguisement
[56:00] i think there's something a bitter cup
[56:04] and many times it's actually blessings
[56:07] because according to romans 8 28 all
[56:10] things
[56:10] work to the good that's pandemics too
[56:17] all things work to the good all things
[56:21] then no matter what i face in life
[56:24] somehow even though i may not understand
[56:27] it
[56:27] somehow it's for my good.
[56:32] i've preached ever since i was a young
[56:34] man god opens blinded eyes
[56:36] i preached that because i believed that
[56:39] but now i can preach it with authority i
[56:42] can preach it with assurance
[56:44] because i have seen blinded eyes open
[56:47] [Applause]
[56:49] but it took the suffering of losing
[56:50] loved ones in an automobile accident
[56:53] it took the suffering of seeing my baby
[56:55] lay on life support
[56:56] for nine days and the doctor said she'd
[56:58] never walk again she'd never talk again
[57:00] she'd never see again you have to go
[57:02] through the suffering
[57:04] hallelujah but yet god has took those
[57:06] things and
[57:07] changed my ministry
[57:12] these things happen many times they're
[57:14] blessings and disguise but many times
[57:16] we can't understand them
[57:20] brother now do you understand no but he
[57:23] never asked me to understand
[57:24] he just said can you trust me can you
[57:27] trust me
[57:28] that i'm doing something good for you
[57:33] sometimes we can't understand them
[57:35] things but if you'll just let them alone
[57:38] god will work it out just right
[57:41] i think many times the problem is we try
[57:44] to work it out
[57:47] if we would just give it into the hands
[57:49] of god
[57:50] i mean brother david was talking about
[57:52] covey back in the back room i remember
[57:54] that day 9 day 10 i thought i was going
[57:56] to leave this world matter of fact on
[57:57] day 10 when my fever was 104.4 and my
[58:00] body was shaking like brother david said
[58:02] like an earthquake on the inside of my
[58:04] body
[58:04] i could not quit shaking but sitting
[58:06] there in the bathroom floor i said god
[58:08] live or die my life is in your hands
[58:14] amen sometimes god don't ask us to
[58:16] understand it
[58:17] he just says can you trust me can you
[58:19] trust me i'll bring you through the fire
[58:21] i'll bring you through the flood i'll
[58:23] bring you through the troughs
[58:25] don't be afraid to drink the cup you
[58:27] shall indeed drink the cup
[58:33] many people try to introduce
[58:34] christianity so many promises today the
[58:37] prophet said amongst christian people
[58:39] so many ministers promised the people a
[58:40] thoughts false thing
[58:42] if you'll just come to christ all your
[58:44] troubles are settled
[58:46] he said but i tell you when you come to
[58:48] christ that's when your troubles
[58:50] begin
[58:53] because the prophet said the devil hates
[58:55] the spirit of god and because he cannot
[58:57] overcome the spirit of god
[58:58] therefore he tries to destroy the
[59:00] vessels
[59:01] in whom the spirit of god dwells
[59:08] all famous pictures before they can ever
[59:10] go into a hall of fame
[59:12] they must first have to pass through
[59:14] critics
[59:17] he said i like that because it's about
[59:18] like the church listen to this quote
[59:20] before the church can ever go into the
[59:24] great rapture
[59:26] first it has to come through the critics
[59:31] all that live godly in christ jesus
[59:33] shall suffer
[59:34] persecution there is no excuses
[59:39] just before the great rapture the church
[59:43] must go through
[59:44] the hall of critics i remember years ago
[59:47] when i came to camp
[59:48] back in 1987 88 89 just a young boy
[59:52] the days were different then nobody
[59:54] persecuted this message
[59:55] nobody was on the internet nobody was on
[59:58] facebook
[59:58] slandering this message slandering this
[1:00:00] prophet but look where we're at right
[1:00:02] now
[1:00:02] you type in the name william branham you
[1:00:04] type in the message of the error and all
[1:00:06] you find is hatred
[1:00:08] come on somebody why do you not see
[1:00:11] where we're at in time
[1:00:12] do you not see that this message is now
[1:00:15] passing through a hall of critics
[1:00:16] the prophet is passing through a hallow
[1:00:18] critic does it tell us
[1:00:20] just how close we are because the
[1:00:22] prophet said before that great rapture
[1:00:24] the church will go through the hall of
[1:00:27] critics
[1:00:30] drinking drinking from the cup
[1:00:35] that the bridegroom drink from
[1:00:39] because the same word speaks for the
[1:00:41] groom speaks also
[1:00:43] for the bride
[1:00:47] there is none that's deferred all have
[1:00:49] to pass through the line of persecution
[1:00:51] and criticism then if we can pass
[1:00:53] through that with such a life
[1:00:55] that the critics can't point their
[1:00:56] finger to anything that's true
[1:00:58] then the pitcher is ready then for the
[1:01:01] great hall of fame
[1:01:03] before the church can ever be raptured
[1:01:05] and taken through the hall of fame
[1:01:06] it goes here through the hall of critics
[1:01:10] all that live godly in christ jesus
[1:01:12] shall suffer
[1:01:13] persecutions it must go through
[1:01:15] criticism
[1:01:16] no criticism no glory
[1:01:21] [Music]
[1:01:23] can you drink this cup of bitter
[1:01:27] persecution if you're ever to get the
[1:01:31] glory
[1:01:31] if you're ever to be put in the hall of
[1:01:33] fame you must drink
[1:01:36] from this cup
[1:01:42] amen you see everybody comes to church
[1:01:46] with this blue skies and smooth sailing
[1:01:50] but it's in the times of trouble that
[1:01:51] you see people all of a sudden disappear
[1:02:00] it must go through criticism no
[1:02:02] criticism
[1:02:03] no glory remember if you follow christ
[1:02:07] you'll be hated by people for all that
[1:02:09] live godly in christ jesus
[1:02:11] shall suffer persecution if you come to
[1:02:13] christ you'll not come by any church or
[1:02:15] any denomination
[1:02:16] or any creed you'll come by the blood
[1:02:19] that's the only avenue
[1:02:20] in the gentile church the real true
[1:02:23] church of god
[1:02:24] has exposed herself to public
[1:02:26] persecution by taking god at his word
[1:02:29] and saying i believe that divine healing
[1:02:31] and the power of the resurrection
[1:02:33] i believe that jesus christ is the same
[1:02:35] yesterday today and forever
[1:02:37] when all these old cold formal mornings
[1:02:39] say the days and miracles has passed
[1:02:41] we expose ourself at his feet hallelujah
[1:02:45] we rejoice like the apostles when they
[1:02:47] returned because they counted worthy the
[1:02:49] better reproach of his name
[1:02:51] and hundreds of years later hundreds of
[1:02:53] years later
[1:02:54] the same holy ghost working in the same
[1:02:57] kind of people
[1:02:58] causing the same results from the
[1:03:00] outside to a point of a scornful finger
[1:03:03] and also the same results on the inside
[1:03:06] for a resurrected lord jesus stretching
[1:03:09] forth his hands
[1:03:10] to do signs and wonders that he did at
[1:03:13] the beginning
[1:03:15] hundreds of years later the same kind of
[1:03:17] people amen
[1:03:20] bearing the reports of those on the
[1:03:22] outside pointing the finger at you
[1:03:24] calling you a cult calling you a man
[1:03:26] follower
[1:03:29] hold on somebody pointed their finger at
[1:03:31] us
[1:03:32] saying were occult
[1:03:35] but at the same time on the inside the
[1:03:38] same jesus
[1:03:39] stretching forth his hand to do signs
[1:03:41] and wonders
[1:03:45] the bible said we are troubled on every
[1:03:47] side yet not distressed
[1:03:50] we are perplexed but not in despair
[1:03:53] persecuted
[1:03:54] but not forsaken
[1:03:59] cast down but we are not destroyed
[1:04:02] i want the devil to know tonight he will
[1:04:05] never
[1:04:05] destroy this bride
[1:04:10] she cannot be stopped
[1:04:24] he said can you drink the cup i drink
[1:04:25] from that's bitter persecution
[1:04:28] yes and he said you shall indeed drink
[1:04:31] we proved it by the bible and the
[1:04:33] message that his words were true
[1:04:36] it was true for them it's also true for
[1:04:39] us
[1:04:42] you shall indeed drink from this cup did
[1:04:44] they drink it we proved it by the bible
[1:04:46] and we proved it by the message
[1:04:48] that the same kind of people following
[1:04:50] the same lord jesus
[1:04:52] gets the same results
[1:04:57] drinking from the same cup
[1:05:00] but he doesn't stop there you see my
[1:05:03] brother my sister
[1:05:04] if that part is right
[1:05:08] if that part is right then the rest of
[1:05:10] the saiyan
[1:05:11] is also correct
[1:05:15] he said ye shall indeed drink of this
[1:05:18] cup
[1:05:20] but then he also said and you shall be
[1:05:23] baptized
[1:05:26] ye shall be baptized with the same
[1:05:29] baptism
[1:05:30] that i am baptized with do you
[1:05:32] understand his baptism what did it
[1:05:34] produce for him though they took the
[1:05:35] life out of his body
[1:05:37] his baptism raised him up again
[1:05:41] and we are baptized with the same
[1:05:42] baptism go ahead
[1:05:44] take my head off my daddy will give me a
[1:05:47] new one
[1:05:49] oh hallelujah the same baptism he had
[1:05:53] we are now in possession of that same
[1:05:56] baptism
[1:05:56] what did it do it changed his body
[1:06:01] what will it do for us it'll change my
[1:06:04] very body amen
[1:06:06] [Applause]
[1:06:09] baptized with the same baptism that i'm
[1:06:12] baptized with
[1:06:13] of people so persecuted
[1:06:16] so hated so ridiculed
[1:06:22] huh type in william branham on the
[1:06:25] internet and see what you get
[1:06:29] people so hated so persecuted so laughed
[1:06:33] at
[1:06:34] huh and most of it's coming from people
[1:06:37] who used to walk among us
[1:06:47] at the same time of people so persecuted
[1:06:50] and people so hated are people so
[1:06:53] criticized
[1:06:53] and at the same time of people so
[1:06:58] anointed
[1:07:00] not a church member not an organization
[1:07:04] not a messiah
[1:07:07] an anointed one standing on the earth in
[1:07:09] this hour
[1:07:15] same persecution same hatred
[1:07:19] but at the same time the same anointing
[1:07:22] he was the messiah and we are
[1:07:26] we are the messiahs
[1:07:33] you need to start looking at yourself
[1:07:35] the way god sees you
[1:07:40] like the little boy looking to the
[1:07:42] mirror he said why mama that's me
[1:07:44] and god has given us a mirror it's the
[1:07:46] mirror of his word
[1:07:47] and a mirror word mirror shows a word
[1:07:50] image amen
[1:07:52] we need to look into this word and see
[1:07:54] that boa hallelujah
[1:07:55] ruth was tapping me mary was stopping me
[1:07:58] enoch was typing me
[1:08:07] anointed messiahs
[1:08:10] like ruth she laid down she pulled the
[1:08:13] same cover
[1:08:14] over her that he was covered with
[1:08:18] like elisha when elijah was taken up
[1:08:21] elijah throw down the mantle and elisha
[1:08:24] wore the same
[1:08:25] metal elijah war
[1:08:30] same spirit same thing with a double
[1:08:33] portion
[1:08:34] same power no greater
[1:08:39] no greater power
[1:08:45] not the quality but the quantity
[1:08:49] just a double portion why because that
[1:08:52] anointing
[1:08:53] was on one man called jesus now that
[1:08:55] same anointing is on a mini-membered
[1:08:57] body
[1:08:58] called the bride and what is the bride's
[1:09:01] name
[1:09:02] mrs jesus christ what double portion
[1:09:05] more because now
[1:09:08] there's an anointed people in arkansas
[1:09:10] there's an anointed people in louisiana
[1:09:12] there's an anointed people in south
[1:09:13] africa
[1:09:14] all around the world the messiahs
[1:09:19] god walking in flesh god living in flesh
[1:09:23] god expressing himself through me
[1:09:25] through you
[1:09:33] same skirt same robe same cup
[1:09:37] same baptism
[1:09:42] can you be baptized with the same
[1:09:44] baptism
[1:09:45] i'm baptized with
[1:09:48] what is that baptism it's the holy ghost
[1:09:53] it's the life of god manifested in flesh
[1:09:59] [Music]
[1:10:00] like a cucumber a cucumber is a
[1:10:03] vegetable
[1:10:05] you sisters that make pickles you know
[1:10:07] all about baptism
[1:10:10] that's right there's actually two terms
[1:10:13] one is bapto
[1:10:14] and the other is baptizo one means to
[1:10:17] dip
[1:10:19] and the other means to be pickled
[1:10:26] john said john said i will baptize you
[1:10:29] with water but there's one coming after
[1:10:33] me
[1:10:36] he shall baptize you with the holy ghost
[1:10:40] two different baptisms jesus said you
[1:10:43] shall indeed
[1:10:44] be baptized with the baptism i'm
[1:10:47] baptized with
[1:10:48] you know it's not saying we all have to
[1:10:50] go to jordan and be baptized in the same
[1:10:52] water
[1:10:54] that's 2 000 years ago the water he was
[1:10:56] baptized in is way
[1:10:58] downstream now
[1:11:02] but he's not talking about dip like you
[1:11:04] dip a pickle in boiling water
[1:11:10] but he's talking about a different
[1:11:11] baptism like a pickle when it's baptized
[1:11:15] in
[1:11:15] vinegar it goes to a transformation
[1:11:19] it's no longer a cucumber it becomes a
[1:11:21] new creation
[1:11:23] [Music]
[1:11:24] it becomes a new creature it becomes a
[1:11:27] pickle it's
[1:11:28] changed forever and he said ye shall
[1:11:31] be baptized he shall be changed forever
[1:11:35] [Applause]
[1:11:36] not a church member not a baptist not a
[1:11:39] methodist
[1:11:40] not even a message believer but sons and
[1:11:42] daughters of god
[1:11:43] made in his image both of his bones
[1:11:45] flesh of his flesh
[1:11:46] spirit of his spirit life of his life
[1:11:49] she
[1:11:50] is him
[1:11:57] [Music]
[1:12:00] and he said can you can you be baptized
[1:12:04] like that and i say yes lord
[1:12:08] easter has made the way for us
[1:12:14] to receive this baptism
[1:12:19] he said you can't you shall indeed
[1:12:23] the things i do to the church
[1:12:26] greater than you now it couldn't be
[1:12:28] greater in quality
[1:12:30] it had to be greater in quantity because
[1:12:32] he stopped nature he raised the dead he
[1:12:33] healed sick
[1:12:34] everything that could be done he did it
[1:12:36] see give life back to the dead and
[1:12:38] everything so nothing could be done any
[1:12:40] greater
[1:12:40] in the quality but it's the quantity
[1:12:46] more people doing what he did
[1:12:50] you see the worst mistake satan ever
[1:12:52] made was when he put that stinger in
[1:12:54] jesus
[1:12:56] he thought he was stopping jesus but all
[1:12:59] he did was open up his side
[1:13:03] so his church could come out
[1:13:08] that day at calvary there was one come
[1:13:10] on
[1:13:11] but that day in the upper room that was
[1:13:13] 120
[1:13:15] and today in this evening time with the
[1:13:18] return
[1:13:19] of the restoration of the word comes the
[1:13:21] restoration
[1:13:22] of the anointing amen
[1:13:29] amen these things i do shall you do also
[1:13:33] and more greater shall you do because i
[1:13:35] go to the father
[1:13:37] the same baptism that i have you'll have
[1:13:39] it too the same spirit that was on
[1:13:41] christ
[1:13:42] the same spirit that was on christ the
[1:13:44] same spirit that was on christ
[1:13:46] is on you
[1:13:52] but you see that'll do you no good if
[1:13:54] you don't believe that
[1:14:01] the same spirit that was on christ is on
[1:14:03] you
[1:14:07] not just the prophet people trying to
[1:14:10] preach today
[1:14:11] that it's just on the prophet that
[1:14:13] preacher shouldn't even preach no more
[1:14:15] just play tapes
[1:14:16] that's a lie
[1:14:17] [Music]
[1:14:19] if they listen to the tapes they were
[1:14:20] listening to if they really heard it
[1:14:22] they would denounce that thing
[1:14:25] [Applause]
[1:14:25] [Music]
[1:14:27] the prophet never taught that the
[1:14:29] message does not teach
[1:14:32] like geronimo speaking of his native
[1:14:34] blood he said i do not think i'm useless
[1:14:37] or the great spirit would not have
[1:14:38] created me
[1:14:39] and i would like to tell them i do not
[1:14:42] think i'm useless
[1:14:44] or god would have not made me an
[1:14:48] [Applause]
[1:14:54] evangelist
[1:14:56] you see where the attack is where's the
[1:14:58] attack today
[1:15:00] amen
[1:15:04] the attack is on the bride jesus said
[1:15:07] the same cup i drink you'll drink the
[1:15:08] same baptism i baptize with you shall be
[1:15:10] baptized with and the same things that i
[1:15:13] do
[1:15:14] shall you do also what did he do
[1:15:17] he spoke in tongues cast out devils
[1:15:19] preached the gospel
[1:15:27] oh my god
[1:15:31] let me pull that that's what he said
[1:15:36] the thing's the same thing that i do
[1:15:38] show you also
[1:15:39] what did he do spoke in tongues cast out
[1:15:41] devils preached the gospel
[1:15:44] healed the sick the same thing that he
[1:15:46] did
[1:15:47] we can too and at the end of our days
[1:15:53] um at the end of our days has he raised
[1:15:56] him from the dead
[1:15:57] so will we who are in him
[1:16:01] he will also raise up my brother my
[1:16:04] sister don't you realize
[1:16:05] the resurrection
[1:16:08] what is easter it's you it's me
[1:16:11] the resurrection is in us
[1:16:14] [Applause]
[1:16:16] you see what messiah is messiah it's the
[1:16:19] kingdom
[1:16:20] of god anointed once them anointed with
[1:16:23] the same spirit
[1:16:24] he was anointed with one said to him one
[1:16:27] day when my son sit at thy right hand
[1:16:28] and i left it
[1:16:29] he said can you drink the cup i drink
[1:16:31] can you be baptized with the baptism i
[1:16:33] baptized with she said yea
[1:16:34] and he said you will but the kingdom
[1:16:36] just sit at the right hand and the left
[1:16:38] is not mine to give
[1:16:39] so it showed it showed we could
[1:16:43] we could drink the same cup
[1:16:47] of persecution be called beelzebub or
[1:16:49] whatever it might be
[1:16:51] huh oh yeah yeah that's what they call
[1:16:54] the fifo ministry today
[1:16:56] huh they call us korra and dathan
[1:17:04] [Music]
[1:17:06] you think the baptist calling me that
[1:17:09] it's my own brothers david said i was
[1:17:12] wounded in the house of my friends if it
[1:17:14] had been my enemy i could have
[1:17:15] understood it
[1:17:16] but it were my friends
[1:17:21] who put jesus to death it was not the
[1:17:24] it was not the drunk
[1:17:26] it was the religious people who supposed
[1:17:28] to have knew him
[1:17:34] he said we have moses to our prophet he
[1:17:36] said if you even knowed moses
[1:17:38] you would have known me for he spoke of
[1:17:40] my day
[1:17:44] [Laughter]
[1:17:48] hallelujah amen
[1:17:52] theo's about whatever it might be and
[1:17:54] she'd be baptized with the same spirit
[1:17:55] he baptized with
[1:17:56] so if he was called messiah which he was
[1:18:00] because he was anointed with that holy
[1:18:01] spirit and any church that's anointed
[1:18:04] with the ham
[1:18:04] with the same holy spirit any church
[1:18:07] that's anointed with the same holy
[1:18:10] spirit
[1:18:10] is a messiah a littler
[1:18:15] smaller a littler smaller
[1:18:24] god
[1:18:26] you see the prophet said as long as we
[1:18:27] fuss and fight among ourselves we still
[1:18:29] walk as men
[1:18:31] we still walk as men so that tells me
[1:18:33] there must be another way
[1:18:34] that you and i can walk on the earth
[1:18:37] when jesus walked on the earth he did
[1:18:39] not walk
[1:18:40] on the earth as a man nor as a god but
[1:18:42] he walked on the earth as a god-man
[1:18:46] and they asked him what country are you
[1:18:47] from what race are you from
[1:18:50] what nation are you
[1:18:55] i was down at san carlos on the apache
[1:18:57] indian reservation
[1:19:00] and there's an indian dinner had a big
[1:19:02] old t-shirt big old letters on it
[1:19:03] said watch out white man this is apache
[1:19:06] land
[1:19:10] i said my mama party indian
[1:19:17] so i said we need to make us a t-shirt
[1:19:19] say watch out devil
[1:19:20] this is bride land this is broad country
[1:19:23] this is god nation amen
[1:19:25] this is who we are anointed messiahs
[1:19:30] sons and daughters of god
[1:19:35] [Music]
[1:19:40] any church any church that tells me
[1:19:43] whether it's in worth whether it's in
[1:19:45] hardy
[1:19:45] whether it's in missouri whether it's in
[1:19:47] tennessee whether it's in south africa
[1:19:49] whether it's in canada
[1:19:51] any church that's anointed with the same
[1:19:53] holy spirit
[1:19:54] is a messiah a littler smaller
[1:19:58] god and someday
[1:20:02] when this body is resurrected i hope
[1:20:04] beforehand
[1:20:05] that god can get a hold of a bunch of
[1:20:07] people
[1:20:09] that god can get a hold of a bunch of
[1:20:11] people that'll manifest his power
[1:20:14] in every dimension that it's supposed to
[1:20:17] be manifested in
[1:20:19] that before this thing wraps up that god
[1:20:22] can get a group of people in his hand
[1:20:25] that will manifest all he intended for
[1:20:28] the people to be
[1:20:29] for the church of the living god to be

[1:26:09] it just don't match but you see what
[1:26:13] happened was
[1:26:14] what happened was one day somebody came
[1:26:17] to his door
[1:26:18] with the book and the book was opened
[1:26:21] and it revealed to him
[1:26:23] his true identity you see he was not a
[1:26:27] jew from new jersey
[1:26:28] he was a sioux indian from south dakota
[1:26:31] adopted as a baby by a jewish family
[1:26:34] raised in a jewish home like that eagle
[1:26:37] was raised
[1:26:38] in a chicken barnyard but one day the
[1:26:41] books was open
[1:26:42] and it revealed his true birth
[1:26:46] it revealed his true genetics
[1:26:50] and when he found out that he wasn't a
[1:26:52] jew he was a sioux
[1:26:54] who could make that up when he found out
[1:26:57] that he wasn't a jew he was actually a
[1:26:59] sioux
[1:27:00] he started going back to the old ways
[1:27:03] the red path started talking about
[1:27:06] elders
