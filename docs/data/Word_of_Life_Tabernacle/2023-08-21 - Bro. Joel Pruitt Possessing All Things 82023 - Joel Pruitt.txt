there's a sickness in your body I wonder if we could just put your hand up to the Lord and your heavenly father Lord as we come together tonight your presence we believe you're here and it's worth being here maybe we're tired and body so lord it's worth coming together just to fill your presence God I pray you would move me out of the way and just let a blessing fall upon these people here tonight oh God it's nothing I can say to the people Lord you've been so good to us and Lord we believe that we want to return that tonight we want to return our love to you by worshiping you tonight in spirit and Truth but Lord we just ask Lord if there's one Among Us that needs salvation or refill into the Holy Ghost Lord anything that they would have need of tonight I pray that this could be their night Lord may we just go away from here better Christians Believers Lord and a message that can restore us back to all things that we have need of I pray you would just be with us now through the remainder of this service in Jesus name are you happy to be in the house of the Lord this afternoon I heard a few of you are the rest of you ate too much well praise the Lord I didn't eat too much at this time so maybe we can get through this but if you have your Bibles while you're standing turn to Second Corinthians chapter 6 and verse 10 we'll just read this one verse and then you can be seated second Corinthians 6 and 10 as sorrowful yet always rejoicing as poor yet making many rich as having nothing and yet possessing all things I wonder how many could say that together possessing all things that's us we are the possessors of all things you may be seated may the Lord had his blessings to the reading of the word the word possessing means having or holding by absolute right how many knows that to be true brother Branham teaches us that in the message we get this timer started here before I forget you all said Amen to that and so brother Braham talking about the possessing all things and there are several sermons there you can listen to where brother Brown speaks on possessing all things and and he actually goes in and he ties it with Abraham and and you know he's the father of Nations and he was given everything he could see he said you look this way and you look that way everything you can see is yours how many knows that to be true and if we are Heirs of Abraham's as Abraham's children then we also have the same promise that Abraham had you know that to be true tonight and so brother Brandon would say he said we find Abraham and in obedience left his home left his land and separated from everything all his Earthly possessions to travel in a Strange Land sojourning a type of the church he said we're asked to forsake everything that's in this world in order to follow Christ now that doesn't mean you can't live here you can't have jobs here you can't be around friends here but what it does is you have to lay down every sin that would so easily beset you and to keep you out of the promised land you cannot be tied to this world and expect to make a Rapture so you have got to move past this world and it's thinking it's understanding and maybe that maybe there would be an idea that a church would try to put upon you but what we have to do is follow the word and that's what Abraham did here he forsake he would forsake everything to follow after Christ and so he said we find Abraham following on year after year and he said he took some portion with him which was his father and he died right away and then he took his nephew which was lot and lot separated himself for argument's sake and went down to live in Sodom yet he was a part of Abraham imagine that he was already called out a part of Abraham and yet he wanted to go back why because it was attractive to him it looked like he could be something special there it looked like he could have a position there and yet if he went over here with Abraham we're going to be in a desert we're not going to have anything it looks like we're going to starve to death we're going to be poor and I can go back down here be the mayor of the city I can have look I can have position in the church I can do something special but that's not what God had called them to he had called them for something greater but he had to test them for a while Abraham was going to face Giants he was going to face Kings and he had to defeat all them to get the promise that was to come and so he said uh God gave the land and all that was in the land to Abraham and he was the heir of all of it God said look east west north and south and all of it belongs to you and to your seed how many Seed of Abraham do we have here today brother Brandon would call you Royal Seed of Abraham he said and so now one day Abraham had it kind of rough and lot was having it easy waiting in sin he said how easy it is and how pleasing sin looks to be and how innocent it looks if you're not careful Satan will trap you in a sin that does not look bad because you probably wouldn't do it but if he can get you to do something that's just a little bit wrong and then you go a little farther and a little more and a little bit more like this and then he could trap you into a situation but what God wants is not mixers with the world but he wants separators to be called out that does not mean to be separated from your brother from your sister but it means to leave everything that would hinder you from taking your land and your promise and so brother Brandon would go on he said he said now you say as long as I believe he said he said lot would say as long as I believe I believe in God so why can't I go down here and Sodom and it'll be all right I'm a Believer he said but it wasn't all right because just being a Believer is not enough to get you out of here but you've got to be obedient and be a believer because if you're a real believer then you're not going to leave the word beside and say well I'm just going to go on by my own carnal thinking brother random would say this multiple times and I pulled up a list of it the other day but he said God wants separators from the world and the world wants mixers and that's what the world wants why can't we all get along why can't we all just be together and be equal and and all these things but God wants separators to come out of the denominations but also to come out of the sin it's not enough just to sit in a message Pew or to sit in a message Church lot could do that lot could go to church every Sunday and say I'm a Believer but it wasn't good enough to get him out of the condition he was in I think people have got to be hungry enough to get out of the cold dead conditions to be called out you say brother I don't see a successful path that way but God didn't say I'm going to show you a bunch of glittery Stars over here and and you're going to be the best and you're going to be the mayor no he said just come and follow me we'll work out the details on the end but you've got to have faith to go this way it don't take any faith to go to Sodom and become popular it doesn't take any faith to go this way and and become one of the one of the elites but it takes Faith to go down here by yourself in the desert and not have any money not have any status it takes Faith to live like that and that's what Abraham's seed would do we may not be the biggest church in town but we can have the spirit of God Among Us because we're following the word of God brother Ram goes on he said see God when he called Abraham he called him to separate himself from everything and that's what we have to do God calls us to a total separation from sin he said come out from among it be not partakers of it shun it the very appearance of evil separation completely annihilated from it he said stay your distance away from it don't tread upon its grounds no matter how nice it looks so when the world can show you a better way that looks easy stay away from it don't tread on its grounds and we'll get to something here in a moment but brother Branham would go on down and he said he's talking about lot he said now see it looked like it was easy for a lot but remember lot had to pay the price as well he said now after this come up he said there comes a king that went on a war path with a little tribe of people and he swept down through the valley and took all the little groups little kingdoms out and and come into Sodom and took the king of Sodom and Gomorrah and took lot his wife his daughters his children all of them and all of their possession all they had and went right on out through cleaning out the country as it went he said oh what a horrible thing the wages of sin is death and he said lot realize no doubt walking along there and maybe with a rope or a chain around his neck as a slave his children young girls to be ravished and his wife and everything and and probably die at any time he disobeyed one order and maybe going into another kingdom somewhere to be a slave the rest of his days so what looked like a better way was death we don't know oh the end of all the situations we're going through but God who is rich in Mercy has called us to things that maybe we don't know but he knows the end time he knows what we're going through and he knows exactly that there will be a people that will follow him you're not going to go after the shiny and the glamor and the things of the world but what you're going after is the promise of a rapture that's what we want tonight we don't need just another uh another church and another big big preacher and and somebody stand up here and tell you how good you are you are you are the Seed of Abraham I can tell you you've got a promise but we've got to follow the word of God or else we'll fall in the same category of slot I'm not trying to beat anybody over the head I'm not trying to be hurtful or anything to you but we've got to follow the word for our day if we want to be called the elected seed of God God didn't call us just to to to follow along behind and say well I'll see how it turns out up front and then my maybe I'll Abraham could have said well show me what the end's going to be no he would have seen a time of Trials he would have seen happen to go fight kings take his servants and go fight kings that would come against him you know if if God could show you after you become a Christian what it's going to be like you might not have become a Christian oh come on somebody it's it's not a flowery bed of ease but it is a it is a rough way of going but God knows what it takes to get you to the end he knows what it takes to get you to have the faith that Abraham needed because when Abraham come among those Kings Brothers said he had no idea how to fight he had never fought in a war but he got his servants and they went down there and they slaughtered every one of them why because he knew he was in the will of God well I hope you hear me tonight church if you know you're in God's will then it takes all the guesswork out of it but it puts you in a position of faith and believing because you're no longer to say well I hope this is the will of God I hope this is the way I should go but if it's the word of God it's the will of God every time and in the will of God there will be freedom to worship in the will of God there'll be freedom to sit down by the tent and entertain the angel of the Lord see when you're in bondage like lot was he wished he could be where Abraham was when the angel of the Lord come by but see the angel of the Lord come to who Abraham and he comes to who now his seed after him and so what we need to do today is entertain the angel of the Lord because he's promised to come by us as well he didn't he didn't go down there a lot we we're not called out to be followers of Billy Graham or Oral Roberts or or The Messengers to Sodom they had a message and we appreciate that and thank God for it but we were called out by a messenger to show us that Christ was still alive and it should produce such a faith in us it should produce such a thing of inside of us that we would no longer be wanting to go back to the things of the world but we would be called out and we could be set aside so that when the angel comes by we can entertain him with our presence and we can worship him in the way we ought to we can say Lord I don't want to go back to the things of the world anymore but I've met the angel and now he's gave me a promise personally that's what we want we want to come aside and entertain the angel like we know we should because God has called us for such a time as this brother random said Abraham he found out that law had been taken that was a part of Abraham's possession Abraham might have said God you told me if I'd obey you and walk in here in this land you would give this to me it belongs to me even his heart went out to lot after lot had already made the wrong decision and his heart still went after lot he said and lots part of this and I'm going after him you got children out there today maybe they went after something fancy or something that that was a little bit glittery and you're like hey this was the way over here but you know you can't change their mind all you can do is say this is the way God has told us to go maybe they make the wrong decision but they're still part of the promise I'm thankful for that tonight we still have a promise he said so he garrisoned or gathered together as servants and put an arm on them and he took his servants down there and and took out until he pursued and found this King that King that had taken lot and his family captive he went and found him he said look what a great army they were then but under the directing of God the chief General he separated himself and fell in upon them and slaughtered the Kings and brought back lot and all the little kingdoms and brought them back to them to their Homeland again he said what a picture of Christ and Abraham there coming after the enemy had captured everything and Christ come and brought us back again that's what we are we have been redeemed from what we were I'd say there's many of us who went the way of law at times but God has sent his Angel down and he went after us he come down there and he said yes you went the wrong way yes you you and your family have went astray but God has said something in your hour to call you back and he said he said I'm going to bring you back to the land where I'll tell you what how do you know you're in the right land because in this land there's peace in this land there's joy in this land there there I'll tell you what there's not going to be a bunch of people sitting around trying to figure out who's bride and who's not no just come on over to the land and if you follow the word of the hour there's going to be a Rapture for you and for your family and for them that are far off we're not trying to sit over here and tell you how to well I've said this a lot and I'll say it again we're not trying to sit over here and dictate how you worship just come over and get in the land where the freedom is that's how you know brother Stewart was talking about the land last week and it got me thinking how do you know you're in the land because in the land there's no more bondage I'm not tied down to that King no more Abraham come down there oh I hope you hear me now Abraham had come down there with his servants oh I might do a little twist here on words but a prophet of God would come down here with his message his servants with the message of the hour would come down here and it would lose slot would loose you from your sins and from the way that you were and now you can walk freely because you come back to the land that God had prepared for you oh I hope you hear me tonight church we are not no longer in bondage we're no longer slaves we are no longer with a rope around our neck brother random said or a chain holding us back but we have found freedom in the message of the hour we have found joy in the message of the hour we have found all the promises of God in the message of the hour we are in the land of promise now we're not looking for it but it's here all you have to do is if you strayed from the land then come back to the land if you found yourself down there and you say well I'm in I'm in this certain church and and this church over here they made me a deacon or they made me a preacher but you know you're out of your position go back to your position even if it means you got humble yourself I bet lot wasn't a mayor no more but he still had to be brought back to the right land we don't need to be trying to go after position or status we need to be going after the word of God and he will put us in position for a rapture program said I like this he said Abraham was heir to All by The Promise so he could lay claim to everything that was in the land he oh I hope you hear me everything that is here tonight I'm not saying just in this church but if you have found your position in the land then God has claimed you for his own and then you have a promise that not just not not just Abraham's promise but you also have a promise of your seed as well because you are the Seed of Abraham and to you you and your children have the same promise but you must be an abrahamic people and have the same Faith he had well I hope you hear me now but if the people of God today would have the same faith that Abraham had then you can claim your children you can go after your lost loved ones just like Abraham would go after his heart or you don't have to be scared of the Kings down there that are holding them you don't have to be scared of the way that they're all entrapped in the world you say well you don't know how bad they are I don't know how bad they are but I know how bad I was and God went after me and God went after you some of you sitting here know as the preacher said this morning some of you know you shouldn't be here but you are here God who is rich in Mercy God come after you when you didn't deserve to become after he looked beyond your faults and saw a seed in there there was an abrahamic seed and he said that's my son or daughter that's my nephew that's my that's my grandson that's somebody that belongs to me because they were meant to be in the land oh you were meant to be in the land you were meant to live and be destroyed by Sodom but sometimes we all find ourselves in a position that lot was in because it looks so easy to be a sinner it looks so easy to just live like the world you don't get condemned for dressing like the world is that all right you don't get condemned for doing things like the world you know the world won't condemn you for sitting at home on Sunday and that's okay you know some can't be here and things like that I'm not talking about them but what I'm saying is the world would like you to do a certain thing I I read a statistic online and I don't remember the number but but the amount of people since covet who stay home and stream Now versus before has almost doubled now what happened kova didn't do it it may have for that year but now that the churches are open what is it people have found an easier way to worship God but there's no way like the Bible way to worship God he said come together and that much more as you see that day approach it then what is the believer is going to do they're going to say Amen to it and they're going to go to church when they can and get to get to those doors as soon as they can brother bear said if God is in your heart you can't wait for them Church doors to open at Young Yonder I understand there's I'm not preaching to anybody that's me it's easier to sit at home it's easier to go the way the world would want you to go there's a pattern that the world would like you to follow there's a pattern of the way they say well why don't you dress like the world well with a very statement dressed like the world is is alarming right because God's people didn't dress like the world so when they say dress like the world okay you want me to go back and dress like they did in Sodom and Gomorrah because we are a set-aside separated people we have to live here we have to be among them but we have to act different because Abraham he even had to get out of the country it got so bad down there but lot who was part of his seed and it was stuck down in there by the glamor and the things that were in the city and and because it was easier to live there maybe they had better water brother Ram said that Abraham was over here and he had to fight for his water and it was hot and he was in the desert and things didn't go easy for Abraham despite what people might tell you Abraham had a rough go of it and he said lot was having a pretty easy time but what did it do lot found himself in bondage by what he thought was easy and Abraham was set aside for service waiting on something and guess who came to Abraham the angel of the Lord so what you're going to get what you expect if you're over here living for the world you're going to fall into the traps of the world you're going to get what the world's got to offer you it'll be bondage it'll be it'll be a lust and and these bad immoral TV shows and uncensored television brother brand would call it and all these things like that but over here where Abraham was at oh there was a visitation from the angel of the Lord but he had to be expecting him to come and when he come he was ready to entertain I think if we would come to church that way sometimes be like I'm ready to entertain the angel of the Lord because I don't just want him to come I know he's coming I don't I don't just expect the church to be another service but I expect God to show up and change my life for the better I don't just come to be to be a number in the church or or say well it's easy because it's not easy going to church three times a week or two or whatever you can do but what it is it it is a it's a sacrifice but what we're doing is we're setting ourselves aside waiting for the visitation of the Angel who has promised that where two or three would gather I will be in the midst so that's what we want we want to be visit we want to have a visitation how many wants to visitation today we don't want to just be set over here in the world but we want a visitation from the from the angel of the Lord and I believe in our hour we have had that if we can just come over here and hear the word of God preach because the word of God today is the same word it is a revealed word just like it was to Abraham when the angel would come and he would tell him and he would he would turn his back to the tent and he would reveal the secrets of Sarah's thought do you realize the same Angel of the Lord has revealed himself again in our day and we can look back and say look we're not following after strange doctrines we're not following just another denomination but God has come down in the veil of human flesh and turned his back to the people and can tell you where you come from he can tell you what your name was he can tell you what you had need of and did you realize that that angel did not leave the scene when brother Brandon went home to be with the Lord but he's here in the bride today because he said ask what you will and it shall be given to you I say whatever you say whatsoever you have need of if you have need of something God can give it to you today it's not by might not by power but by the spirit of God that is here among the people today oh I'll tell you well that's why I don't want to sit in the dead church because I want to be in a church that's got Authority when they have a sickness we can gather together you can call for the elders and they can lay hands on you we don't just do that just for a show we do it because we believe if we do according to the word of God then God's going to show up and he's going to change lives and heal the sick and raise the dead or I'll tell you what take the limits off of God today and you'll realize that there are resources that have not even been tapped into yet because God is still a Healer God is still a saver of souls today oh I don't want to hear that stuff about it's over if God has placed a calling in your life then that tells me it's not over for you yet if God has come down and he said listen you're one of mine and he's called you out of Sodom and he said I want you to come over here with a Abraham's group God is not calling someone who is lost but he's calling someone who has a Seed of Abraham on the inside He is wanting you oh I hope you hear me now he wants you more than you want him sir he wants to give you something that maybe you don't even know you won't yet Abraham did not know what was coming but he knew that if he followed the word of God he would be a possessor of all things brother random would say I don't have time to read it all I'm running out of time already he said Abraham was the poorest man in all the country you know that Abraham was the poorest man in all the country because he lived out in the desert and lived in peace with God sounds like a pretty good place for the Helen he lived in peace with God and lot was rich and lived in the city now but the brand is not knocking you before being rich and telling you you got to be poor he's not doing any of that but you have to be careful where your priorities are when you get to this position so if God gives you something then you better know how to handle it or he's not going to give it to you right if he gives you lots of money if you're a seed of God he's not going to just let you be the richest man in the world unless he knows you can handle it and benefit the kingdom of God that's just as simple as I can put it he said and he said and he lived in peace with God he said but lot was rich and lived in the city and become governor of the city he said in the gate he was a judge and judge the city and had all the riches and things but Abraham was in the desert perhaps the poorest man in the land and yet a claim to possess all somebody say oh he had claimed to possess all he said that's what I like oh tonight we may not be rich in this world's Goods but we possess all things so you may not look like the richest person in hearty or fair or wherever you live but you are a possessor of all things the Earth you stand on is yours the air you breathe is yours everything that you look around you say well well that was for Abraham brother Brandon would say it like this he said if a rich man leaves his son money no matter if he's a drunkard no matter what he's been doing no matter how bad that person is if his father left him an inheritance is his inheritance now I don't care how you've lived I don't care what you've done if your father has left you an inheritance it's yours to possess I don't care what you've done you say you don't know what my past is but I know your future because the word has come and told me so come on I was lost and I'm done but God he sent somebody and he loved you so much you know you think of God as being a god of wrath and and he is he hates sin he hates all these things but he loved you so much that he took his only son and let him die for you so that you could possess eternal life now reverse order Jesus himself could have possessed eternal life himself never had to die and you would be lost but in order to possess The Inheritance that God was going to give you he had to sacrifice something so is it today for the believer if you want the blessings that God has for you you may have to sacrifice something to possess all things you may not get what you want all the time but you will possess eternal life it don't really matter what you know it's just a space of time we live here brother Danny and some of you men brother Bill you've been here and you can you can look back on that he's talking about the 70s earlier and things like that you look back and really we had you hadn't been here that long to us young people it looks like you've been around a while but you hadn't been here that long you know time goes by like that your kids are grown and I look around and I'm just a kid and I've got kids but you know what it is time this goes back we're just in a little space of time here and yes we want to be comfortable where we're at and we should provide things for our kids and do things we should do all those things but don't forget the main thing because the main thing is show your children away to eternal life because just like lot the the shiny things are going to pass away the shiny things may even put you in bondage but you've got to be called out of the shiny things into a glow of the spirit of God in your life you've got to move away from things that are just so pretty and maybe you've got it so easy brother I think it's time that if we look at and you say well brother Joel I haven't had it easy well don't don't complain about it thank God for the rough things you've had to go through because he's the one that brought you through them oh I think we we blame God for putting us through rough things let's thank him for bringing him through bringing us through that's what we need let's just give God praise when we come to the house of God let's give God thanks for what we've got let's give God praise for what we've caught because it may not be what we wanted but it's what we needed and that we are a possessor of all things you say well I don't have what I want I don't have the nicest car or the nicest truck it don't really matter what you got here because over there your father owns a cattle on a thousand hills and I believe I'll tell you what I believe you are an heir to every one of them God rich in Mercy made you an heir of all the promises brother bam talks about he said today the True Believer is cast out from among the people called a fanatic a Holy Roller take this off I'm about that time I'll ruin it The Fanatic or Holy Roller he said some kind of a religious fanatic and yet is heir to the whole heavens and Earth blessed are the meek they shall inherit the earth he said oh my talk about push you out in a cabin or somewhere and hardly enough money to pay your rent yet you own it all see God doesn't judge you by your status here on Earth he judges you by your status in heaven what have you given to God well you know brother being preached this morning can we give everything we got can we give him our best can we do for God you know what we want to do for our children we want to give him the best we can we want to work for him we want to we want to take them places and have fun with them you think God doesn't want to do the same for us God wants you to be happy he wants you to be healthy but see he lets us go through child training sometimes so that we can see the goodness of God so that we can see that that even though we failed him many times even though we didn't deserve to be taken out and taken on this wonderful thing we're calling a Rapture and taking up out of here we didn't deserve any of that but God who is rich in Mercy said you know what you are my seed I promised up Abraham and I promise to you and I promise to all them afarov as many as the Lord God would call I promised every one of you eternal life and I won't leave one of you behind I'm going to take you with me he said he said have to work and toil and sweat for a few dollars to make an honest living to put shoes on your children's feet and feed their hungry he said he said but yet you possess he said Oh my he said I like that possessor of the earth he said what is it the believer how many Believers we have here today he said what is it to believe or he said he said the believer has a title an abstract deed that's right by Jesus Christ that he shall be the possessor of the entire universe he said that's right the meek shall inherit oh I think we've got to defeat some enemies today to possess what God has for us because he's going to try to hold you down by the things of the world say well I'm poor and I've got to be rich that's Satan trying to play on your emotions the main thing is be rich in love be rich in Hope be rich in faith and God will add to these things he will he will bless you he will bless Abraham's seed you don't ever have to beg for bread God will provide for you in your time of need but the main thing is you're following God and not going after the things of the world he said I'd apply it today this is the application part brother Graham said I'd apply it today I'd say the church could say Lord God here's my brother he's talking about sickness here he said he's laying here stricken with cancer he's stricken with tuberculosis he's got so and so he said I lay hold of a promise it's my possession you got kidney problems you've got headaches all the time or backaches or or cancer or or whatever it is or or you know let's just bring it home maybe you've got a lust problem or or maybe you've got something that's it's not a health but maybe it's maybe it's a spiritual problem maybe you're cold in your walk do you realize the promise that you have and that you don't have to stay there you can be called out into the land where the promises are I think In the Flesh we get in those the land where the promises have been taken away from us but if you get back in your position now where is the believer's position in Christ and Christ is the word so if if I am in the word if I am walking according to the word then God is obligated you say we don't use that word God is obligated to provide for you if you'll follow his word well that's uh it takes Faith first you have to believe that the word is true and then you can lay aside everything else that would hurt you from following the word say Lord I have to give this up to follow the word but I'm going to follow it anyway what are you doing you're taking a step of abrahamic faith brother Brian would call it and when you do that then you take that step of faith and I promise you God will provide for your knees God will not leave you comfortless but he will come to you with the Holy Ghost he will not leave you begging for bread he said I've never seen seen his seed forsaken or a seed begging for bread and he will not do it for you either you said brother Joel I've been I've been poor I've been broke I've been there too but God is not leaving you helpless and hopeless and and all these things but what he's doing he's trying to bring you back to a place of grace and mercy did you ever see a child when they're walking and you hold their hand and they fall down you know the worst thing you can do is pick them up and hold them but let them get back up and try to walk again and God's doing the same thing for you to day he's letting you fall down and take your lumps here because it's like a man said one time he said this is boot camp God's teaching you how to walk by faith down here is that right you say what man why did why did God give me a harder road than you he knew you needed it sometimes I wonder but it will be worth it all when we're in the land a promise he said brother I'm talking about the going after your enemy to lay the whole to lay hold of your possession that's what Abraham did he went after the enemy he didn't go back down to Sodom and say you know I guess I'll hang out here for a while and see if they come back no he went after the enemy the enemy's trying to bind you today you're trying to bind your worship come on somebody he's trying to bind your your family he's trying to bind you to a sickness he's trying to bind you by Financial struggles he's trying to buy into your mind but I challenge you today to go after that enemy and take back what's yours I challenge you not to leave it there and let it go undone I say bring it back and it's yours bring that thing under subjection because whatever you speak in this age can be the saith the Lord because it's going to the word what does that say of the Lord what the word of God is so you say I have a promise that's the saith the Lord I'm going after my family that's the saith the Lord I'm going after all those that that that that have misused me and I'm gonna I'm gonna say you know what I forgive you that's a Biblical principle I say that's the saith the Lord if it's in the word of God we can go boldly and say I'll take it back everything that the devil stole from me I'm taking back my joy I'm taking back my peace I'm going to live in the land of promises where all the promises are why because God has given it to Abraham and I'm his seed I'm heir to it all he said go after that enemy that devil and Slaughter it just the same as Abraham slaughtered the Kings and brought back his possession he said amen I like that it's to the believer Abraham had a right to the promise did you know you have a right to the promise can you say amen and the promise was his yet he had to fight to possess it he said amen there you are the believer today yet we're heir to all things he said we're going to have to fight for it but you're heir to it that seems strange doesn't it why don't you just give it to me Lord because he wants to see if you'll fight for it are you are you willing to fight for it are you willing to fight for what God has given to you are you willing to fight for your god-given rights well come on somebody you're either willing to fight for it or it ain't worth having in the first place but I say today if you want your children back fight for them if you want the spirit of God back in the services again fight for it don't sit there and give in to what the devil's trying to tell you fight for your god-given right fight for what's yours it's not fighting for something that somebody else has got it's fighting for your own right God doesn't just give things to you though he wants you to have it but he wants you to get up and walk and come and take a step and I remember when when Jason was a little boy if he wanted something and he was just learning to walk we'd hold out something he liked and wanted and you know sometimes he'd crawl and we wouldn't give it to him but he'd get up and try to walk and we'd you know he could come and find it going to find out he's a better Walker than he thought he was some sometimes you got more faith than you think you do is that right sometimes you just gotta go take the land of promise and defeat the devils in your way they're bigger than you are defeat them anyway they've got oh brother brother Joel you don't know how how much of a hole they've got on me I'll quit giving them so much praise and go take the land quit giving the devil all the glory and go take what God's given to you God's a big God he's a good God but he wants to see his children respond sometimes he wants to see if you're willing to fight for your possession because all things are yours you can possess them but you got to fight for it we're going down here and try to close I'm running out of time I've got three minutes left you think I'll stay with it brother Brian said if you've never received the Holy Ghost as yet don't know nothing about it something in your heart telling you want it he said stay right there and fight for it don't give up easy you know when you want something bad enough you won't give up he said stay right there he said that's eternal life that's what you're heir to stay right there he said look Satan right in the face and say you are the robber you're the one he said I've come to possess what Jesus Christ died for me to have now hand it back he said get out of my way sometimes you got to talk to the devil like that get out of my way Satan I'm coming to take what's mine he said then the first thing you know the Holy Ghost will pour upon you and something happens he said what is it God Vindicated that he keeps his word he said that's just exactly he said then after you see the word is Vindicated to you you are saved he said what do you he said do you have the Holy Ghost then what Abraham had won the Victory and here he come marching back he was going down with his faith laying on the word that he could bring it back what he had lost and here he come back with it marching the Victor's March he said that's the same thing you can do if you don't have eternal life ask God that's what he said just ask God confess your sins believe on the Son of God accept the baptism of the Holy Ghost and say God I come for it I'm here to receive it then you come back on the Victor's March I think it's time to see some victory marches back in church I think it's time when we see we've already come we've already fought it out with the devil well I'll tell you what it was a hard fight but we're still here I've got the victory I'm on the victory march today that's why I I don't see it I don't see why we should come and feel all defeated at church because the fact that you made it ought to put you on the victory march the fact that you're here I I look and see people sitting here that maybe shouldn't have been here maybe you wasn't here maybe he was in the world just a few years ago but you hear that's why you're on the victory march tonight and you say I'll tell you what I was down there in Sodom I was chained the Kings had come and got me the kings of the world the principalities of the air they were trying to come after me but there was a message to come down and got a hold of me and it took chains off of me oh my and he said I am one of yours and God had come down there and got a hold of me where I was where I was dead and sin and trespasses but he didn't leave me there he brought me out and now I'm sitting with the other believers in the house of God in Heavenly places where all things are possible where the heavenlies are you can ask what you will you can say to this mountain be moved and if it needs to be moved then it'll be moved but listen to me Church what you got to do is you've got to believe the promises for your age you've got to believe the promises for your hour I believe today there is going to be a little group that is getting ready for a Rapture you may not look like the world's best but God has called you out you may not look like the mayor of the city but God has called you out you may not look like somebody that we would pick for president but God has called you out and sets you aside he said I'm not going after the elite necessarily but I'm going after the meek because they are going to inherit the earth they are here because of grace of God they are here because I wasn't gonna lose one of them oh come on somebody you are here because God had saw you in the shape you were in and he said I'm not leaving you there but I'm sending my son for you he's already died oh I don't even see your sin no more because I promised son that came and the promise happened we can say today this day that scripture was fulfilled because we can see our young people coming back to the Lord we can see our old people getting on fire for the Lord we can see our brothers acting like men we can see our sisters dressing like sisters what is it it is a promise of the hour we are possessing that Promise by living out the word as the Bride of the end time I wish somebody had preached with me for a minute God has not given you just another organizational idea but he has given you a possession he has given you the attitude that I'm going to take what's mine I'm going to take back what the devil stole from me I'm not leaving it down there oh come on somebody you say well I just don't feel good in church no more because when not having services like we used to well whose fault is that the angel of the Lord is here I say it's time that we act like that the angel of the Lord is here entertain him while he comes by entertaining when he's moving Among Us don't act like a dead formal Baptist Church member but if he's here and you know he's here because why a promise of God's hand where two or three we're together is there two or three with me here this afternoon then the presence of God is here and where he is there is Liberty to Worship in the way that some will call crazy some will say that's out of order but we're going to worship anyway some will tell you you can't praise God like that in a mess oh come on somebody God may say you may say you can't worship like that in the message church because that's how to order I say get out of order for a while and have church I say get out of order for a while and let God move on your families again get out of order long enough to see the salvation go down there and take what's yours and then do the victory march that's what he said dude that's what he said to do well take what's yours Moses went down to Egypt and I'm about to close don't get scared Moses went down to Egypt and he come out with all them people and after they defeated the object in the way they had to go through what a challenge of faith God wanted to see are you going to go are you going to run back there to Pharaoh's Army but no they they realized that in their age there was a Vindicated Prophet among them there was somebody that was called to call them out and all they had to do was to follow the word for the day and if they did there was life on the other side and it might get misused and misquoted but I'll say this once they come out and they could look behind them and they could see Pharaoh's Army was dead I say once you've seen that devil that has been defeated in your life once you've overcome sickness once you've overcome some sort of a sin that is trying to hold you back once you've overcome something in your life you can shout like nobody else because those people in the sea couldn't shout no more they were the deadest church members in the land but there was somebody there was somebody shouting it wasn't those that were drowned with Pharaoh's Bunch it was the people who'd come through it was God's people that could shout and dance like nobody why because they had overcome the world they had come out on the other side and I say today church it's time that we overcome our sin that is holding us back you say what is that sin I don't know examine your own life and say Lord I'm giving that back to the devil where it come from and I'm going to worship the house in the house of God in the way they call crazy I'm gonna act like a fool because I'm here to give God glory I'm here to give God praise I'm not here just to show up I'm not here just to be another preacher I'm not here just to be another church member I'm not here just to sing another song but I'm here to put my praise with your praise and stomp on the head of the devil put your head on the neck of that devil and say Satan you're a liar Satan you can't have my family Satan you can't have this church you can't have us the girls were marching on in Victory how many people's gonna march on in Victory you say but it's Sunday afternoon I'm tired where'd you get that tiredness back to the devil where it come from and March on in Victory oh come on somebody I'm out of time I should have said it for 45 instead of 40. can somebody say praise the Lord and some has anybody overcome and anybody there ever come something I don't know you name it don't have to name it out loud praise the Lord but you name it whatever is it whatever you think of I've overcome something I'll guarantee you every one of you has overcome something think back to what God did for you and then try to keep us quiet if you want to because I can look back and say I shouldn't have been here I didn't believe in Preachers I was over there sitting I said good people sitting there saying well the preachers got it all messed up preachers are all wrong I've never heard a good one I guess I know but no you know Satan will try to blind you by something and sometimes he'll use something close to the word but remember if it's one word off get away from it so if Satan says you can have some of your children get away from it if Satan says well you can say a man in church but don't you dare shout hallelujah say Satan take that you can sing in church but it better I'm gonna get myself in trouble you can sing in church but it better be songs from the 50s and 60s because the new ones aren't anointed well come on somebody you know people aren't bad to say that but Satan will use good people to say bad things to hinder your walk in the Lord I'm not saying people are bad I'm saying that don't let Satan talk to you I don't care how it is I don't care what he says if it's not in the word leave it alone stomp on that devil and then get back in here worship God well that's all right this none of this is in my notes I'm so far off of I don't know where I'm at but let me tell you this you can't stay away from where the presence of God is if you're an eagle because where the carcass is where the word of God is and there will be an atmosphere you ever been around a carcass there will be an atmosphere hahaha right now Eagles don't feed on dead carcasses right if you if you're smelling that kind of stuff you're in the wrong Church if it smells dead get away from it but as Eagles we have looked down there and you can fly over the highest you can be however I didn't go to school I don't know how high an eagle flies but you can look down in that stream and you can see that little trout from a thousand feet in the air probably not that high and you're looking at maybe higher I don't know and you look down in there and you look in that stream and you can see the word down there so I gotta have me some of that did you know that's what it is when we come together we come here and the word of God is being preached sometimes sometimes it's just me up here rattling but you come together because we love one another right but more importantly we come here because we love the word of God and we want to be fed on the body word of God right that's what we come for that's what we need we need the Holy Ghost back in our services right we need the Holy Ghost in US and I believe that if you want it you can possess it you say well it didn't come the first service I come I come expecting and it didn't come well you sometimes you got to wait a while sometimes you got to keep coming keep going and say you know what I'm going to go every service I've been here 10 services in a row and God didn't move me like I wanted him to but you come that one time and God does something so special for you and you can testify of it but you have not because you right so what do you want I want the blessings of God I want healing I want my children you can have it because of who you are you are in your position so take what's yours I hope somebody hears me now take what yours in closing I'll say this David danced before the Lord and when they laughed at him oh come on somebody but you know what the ark was on its way back to where it belonged when you see a believer see it don't have to be something God's doing for me but when I see other believers that are being in their position and coming back to the Lord that does something for me when you see some somebody making a decision to be baptized that ought to do something for the whole church when you see I I don't need to pick on you but when I saw sister Stephanie come back to the Lord it did something for me it lit a fire inside of me why because I know God's still moving among his people today and I can say there's another Seed of Abraham who's called out I can see brother trips sitting there and worshiping the Lord and I can say why because God who is rich in Mercy didn't want to lose the one of them and he knew the Rapture is coming and so why don't we just reach out today and say Lord I want more of what you got for me and I believe he'll pour it out on you tonight let's stay under our feet musicians come what do we want today do you want a promise to be fulfilled in your life you possess all things [Music] now who are you the Bride of Jesus Christ and if I could put it this way she possesses all things how many bride do we have here how many believe you're the Bride of Jesus Christ you possess every promise written in the word because it wasn't written to the unbeliever it was written for you it was given to you oh my it was written for you it's Abraham he said we find out that he met him he can go and play something there he said we find out that Abraham met Melchizedek After the Promise had been Vindicated then he had Fellowship Melchizedek come out to bless Abraham he said Blessed Be Abraham blessed be the god of Abraham and the possessor of heavens and earth he said my how I like that believer's promise he said you say what's what's that got to do with us to every believer the believer's promises eternal life listen to this last part the believer's promise is life joy peace long-suffering gentleness patience fruits of the spirit Divine Healing isn't all these things that we have just by being a believer we can't just say it it's got to be from the heart he said it belongs to you but you cannot have it until you fight for it it may be hard coming to church fight your way through that it may be hard to put God first at times but do it because your possession is important I wonder if we could play something and and we could bow our heads and program goes on down here he said this actual Earth he said I'm an heir you're an heir every believer is an heir see he didn't say just the prophet was the heir every believer is an heir said you say brother Brandon what about what about out there where you can't see how how do you know he said it's still mine he said Heaven belongs to me he said I'm glad it's mine God said so he said that's right well you've never seen how do you know it's there he said I know it's there anyhow because God said so I wonder how many of us could say it may not be easy but I'm possessing the promise because God said I could [Music] and if he said it that's enough for me [Music] he said we're all heirs together foreign [Music] why didn't he kill me because he couldn't God wasn't ready he could come as much as he want to but he can't take you he said he paid my debt a long time ago I paid my debt a long time ago when I believed on Jesus Christ who's Alive forevermore he said now death listens to what we say he said you say a possessor of death he said that's what Paul said so you're not just possessor of all things on here but you're a possessor of death itself said Paul said fixing to cut his head off he said oh death where's your sting show me where you can scare me he said death said I'll squeeze you down and put you in the grave he said you'll rot and Canker he said oh thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ yes sir death Hell In The Grave I possess it all because he conquered it all for us the possessor [Music] you don't have to even die of death because a Believer doesn't die how many possessors do we have in the building today I wonder if we could sing this with all our hearts [Music] oh
