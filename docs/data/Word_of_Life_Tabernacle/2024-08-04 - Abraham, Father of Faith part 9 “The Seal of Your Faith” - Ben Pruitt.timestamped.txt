[49:03] forward to that good to see everyone in
[49:04] the house of the Lord this morning
[49:06] Romans chapter 4 I'm sorry Genesis
[49:09] chapter
[49:10] 17:9 we're going to go to Romans 4 next
[49:13] after you're
[49:14] seated Genesis 179 God said to
[49:17] Abraham Thou shalt keep my Covenant
[49:20] therefore th and thy seed after thee in
[49:23] their
[49:24] Generations this is my Covenant which
[49:26] you you shall keep between me and you
[49:28] and thy seed after thee every Manchild
[49:31] among you shall be
[49:34] circumcised you shall circumcise the
[49:36] Flesh of your foreskin it shall be a
[49:39] token of the Covenant betwix me and you
[49:43] pray the Lord would add his Blessing to
[49:44] the word you may be
[49:49] seated as we followed Abraham in his
[49:51] journey of faith we found that he'd been
[49:53] called out of er the caldes he'd been
[49:56] separated from his Brethren he seen the
[49:59] promise confirmed with signs and wonders
[50:02] it's had Jehovah reveal himself as El
[50:06] Shai now his faith must be
[50:10] recognized by an irreversible seal in
[50:14] his flesh a token of the Covenant in
[50:17] Romans chapter 4 Paul deals with uh
[50:20] circumcision what it is and what it
[50:22] isn't and he makes the argument that it
[50:24] wasn't the act of circumcision that was
[50:26] was the uh what Justified Abraham but it
[50:29] was actually circumcision was a seal of
[50:32] his faith that he had and so it was
[50:35] faith that actually saved Abraham Romans
[50:37] 4:1 what shall we say then that Abraham
[50:39] our fathers pertaining to the flesh has
[50:41] found for If Abraham were justified by
[50:43] works he ha where of to Glory but not
[50:46] before God for what sayith the scripture
[50:48] Abraham believed God and it was counted
[50:51] unto him for righteousness now to him
[50:54] that worketh is the reward not reckoned
[50:56] of Grace but of debt in other words if
[50:58] if you get in based on your works then
[51:01] then you it's because God owed you
[51:03] something and God do will owe nothing to
[51:06] anyone right he's not going to owe
[51:08] anybody and so our works are even the
[51:12] Bible says our righteousness is like
[51:13] filthy
[51:15] rags but he says it's not reckoned of
[51:18] Grace but of debt but to him that
[51:19] worketh not but believeth on him that
[51:22] justifieth the ungodly his faith is
[51:25] counted for righteousness even as David
[51:28] also describeth the blessedness of the
[51:30] man un whom God imputeth righteousness
[51:32] without works saying blessed are they
[51:35] whose iniquities are forgiven and whose
[51:37] sins are covered blessed is the man to
[51:40] whom the Lord will not impute sin I
[51:42] believe that's us today the Lord will
[51:45] not impute sin to his elect yes to those
[51:49] who believed on him he said cometh this
[51:51] blessedness then upon the circumcision
[51:53] only or upon the uncircumcision also for
[51:57] we say that Faith was reckoned to
[51:58] Abraham for righteousness how was it
[52:01] then reckoned when he was in
[52:02] circumcision or in uncircumcision he
[52:05] said not in circumcision but in
[52:07] uncircumcision other words before he was
[52:09] circumcised he received the sign of
[52:12] circumcision so circumcision was not the
[52:15] beginning of Abraham's faith it was the
[52:17] end of it it was it was God saying that
[52:19] his faith was real a seal notice that
[52:23] word a seal of the righteousness of the
[52:25] faith which he had had yet being
[52:27] uncircumcised that he might be the
[52:29] father of all them that believe though
[52:31] they be not circumcised that
[52:32] righteousness might be imputed unto them
[52:34] also and the father of circumcision to
[52:36] them who are not of the circumcision
[52:38] only but who also walk in the steps of
[52:40] that Faith of Our Father Abraham which
[52:43] he had yet being uncircumcised for the
[52:45] promise that he should be the heir of
[52:47] the world was not to Abraham or to his
[52:50] seed through the law but through the
[52:52] righteousness of Faith so he's saying
[52:53] that circumcision is not what saved
[52:55] Abraham it was the Seal of his faith it
[52:58] was proof of the Covenant that God
[53:01] made if you're going to go to heaven
[53:04] it's going to be because God picked you
[53:07] he called you he he he oh he he woed you
[53:11] he he brought you he he changed your
[53:14] mind he he brought you to a place in him
[53:18] that you could go that you would be
[53:20] worthy he made you worthy to go and so
[53:22] we realize that's all God right there's
[53:25] nothing we have to do in that
[53:27] but yet if we have that if we are that
[53:29] person if we have that kind of Faith to
[53:31] believe God if he's placed that dep
[53:33] positive faith in our life there's got
[53:35] to come a time where he seals us or he
[53:38] he actually gives us proof of the
[53:41] Covenant that's what circumcision was to
[53:43] Abraham it was proof of the Covenant now
[53:47] I know there's many people might ask
[53:48] well why do I need the baptism of the
[53:50] Holy Ghost why isn't it enough that I'm
[53:53] a Believer isn't it enough that that I
[53:56] say well well I I believe the message I
[53:58] believe uh what brother Ben says I
[54:00] believe the preachers I I believe the
[54:03] Bible isn't that enough well if you
[54:06] really believe God seals that Faith with
[54:10] the Holy Ghost and so you find that if
[54:13] if you don't have the baptism of the
[54:15] Holy Ghost and yet you're relying on
[54:18] Election you're relying on on faith you
[54:21] you'll realize that you you've you've
[54:24] misapplied something because if you
[54:26] really had faith and you're an elected
[54:28] seat of God and you've repented fully of
[54:32] your sins you shall receive the gift of
[54:35] the Holy
[54:37] Ghost so brother brandom he went through
[54:40] a time and he told it many many times in
[54:42] his ministry where he talked about the
[54:44] dean of a Lutheran School Who challenged
[54:46] him on why he needed the Holy Ghost and
[54:48] and the man told him he said isn't faith
[54:52] enough isn't faith enough it's a great
[54:54] question and he and brandham told him
[54:57] but or he told brother brandham but
[54:59] Abraham believed god brother brandham
[55:00] and it was imputed to him for righteous
[55:02] because he believed what more can a man
[55:05] do but believe good question right what
[55:09] more can a man do but believe I said
[55:12] it's all a man can
[55:14] do right that's all a man can do that's
[55:17] all Abraham could do it's all you can do
[55:20] this morning is
[55:22] Bel he said it's all Abraham could do he
[55:25] said it's all a man could do you believe
[55:27] and accept Christ as a personal savior
[55:30] that's your faith but remember God gave
[55:33] Abraham a seal of circumcision as a
[55:36] confirmation of his faith so it's not
[55:40] just believing but it's being it's God
[55:43] saying you believe it's not just me
[55:45] saying I believe but it's God saying you
[55:49] believe that's right are you with me
[55:51] now now he said but Abraham believed God
[55:55] was isn't that enough now and and I said
[55:58] then that was the Old Testament in the
[55:59] New Testament when we say we believe he
[56:02] said God gives us the baptism of the
[56:04] Holy Ghost which is a seal of
[56:07] Confirmation and I'll say this without
[56:10] it you're not
[56:11] sure without it you you'll draw back
[56:14] without it when the tough times come you
[56:17] you you you'll you'll Wilt like a flower
[56:19] in the summer heat you won't be able to
[56:22] to press on you won't be able to make it
[56:24] especially the age that we live him
[56:26] because you don't have what it takes
[56:29] you're not really sure without the
[56:31] baptism of the Holy Ghost but with the
[56:33] baptism of the Holy Ghost you can prove
[56:36] and I'll say this you other people may
[56:37] not believe it but you can still prove
[56:40] it it's been proved to you in your own
[56:42] life that your faith was effective
[56:45] because you received the baptism of the
[56:47] Holy Ghost so now he said he said
[56:50] Ephesians 4:30 says grieve not the holy
[56:53] spirit of God whereby you're sealed
[56:55] until the day of your Redemption see
[56:56] it's a seal that God has recognized your
[56:59] faith but if he hasn't given you the
[57:02] Holy Ghost yet he's never recognize your
[57:05] faith now it's real important church if
[57:09] you don't have the baptism of the Holy
[57:11] Ghost this morning and I won't take a a
[57:14] show of hands but but I know there'd be
[57:16] many maybe that would wonder and do I
[57:19] really have it and and sometimes a
[57:20] person can have it and wonder about that
[57:22] we know that's true but I'd say for most
[57:25] of us we had a definite experience with
[57:27] God we know we receive something from
[57:30] God yet the devil will attack you on
[57:32] that he'll try to make you think you're
[57:34] not saved when you are and he'll try to
[57:36] make you think you are saved when you're
[57:38] not but yet most of us I think we we've
[57:41] had a definite experience with God we
[57:42] know we have it and yet if you don't
[57:45] have it you say but but I'm a Believer
[57:47] brother beny you're right you are a
[57:48] Believer I don't want to minimize the
[57:51] the believing in your life but you
[57:53] haven't believed enough yeah that's
[57:55] right
[57:57] church I I take that from a quote I
[57:59] don't have it with me this morning
[58:00] brother B said your faith wasn't strong
[58:03] enough you haven't believed enough there
[58:05] hasn't been uh there's something that's
[58:07] got to happen in your life where Beyond
[58:11] it's not just me saying I believe but
[58:13] I've I've surrendered everything to God
[58:15] I've completely given up myself to God
[58:17] I'm a I'm a I'm a vessel being willing
[58:20] I've been Justified and Sanctified and
[58:22] I'm willing to serve him and when I get
[58:25] in that condition then God fills me with
[58:27] the Holy
[58:29] Ghost but you believe you say well I
[58:32] believe but I but I just don't know
[58:33] about that Holy Ghost you don't believe
[58:35] in
[58:36] us right because if you really believe
[58:39] God confirms that faith if you believe
[58:41] like Abraham believed God seals you with
[58:45] the Holy
[58:46] Ghost so if you don't have it what do
[58:49] you do what can I do what more can a man
[58:51] do believe believe fully but that's more
[58:54] than just saying I believe but it's when
[58:56] you when you believe it it produces an
[58:59] action in your life you get under the
[59:00] message of the hour you get under the
[59:02] token you you become under the blood you
[59:05] begin to act like a Christian walk like
[59:07] a Christian you
[59:09] believe and God seals
[59:12] that and and Peter said the same in Acts
[59:15] 238 Peter said repent and be baptized
[59:17] every one of you in the name of Jesus
[59:18] Christ for the remission of sins you
[59:21] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[59:24] if your faith is right God will confirm
[59:27] it right and and it's not like you say
[59:30] well I'm not perfect brother Ben I must
[59:32] not have it it didn't never say you'd be
[59:34] perfect said you'd be
[59:36] sealed right he never said that you'd
[59:38] never make a mistake he said you'd be
[59:40] sealed and to be sealed means you can't
[59:43] be lost right oh that's something we
[59:45] ought to want on it's not something
[59:47] scary it's not something that out there
[59:49] somewhere that well the Pentecostals
[59:51] have but we can't really have it no no
[59:53] it's something we should want it's the
[59:54] literal Life of Christ living in you
[59:57] where you couldn't you couldn't leave
[59:59] this message if you wanted
[1:00:01] to why because there's something inside
[1:00:03] of you that's sealed you we talked about
[1:00:05] Wednesday night a mainspring something
[1:00:07] inside that that has made you uh do what
[1:00:10] you do and you don't do it to you don't
[1:00:12] pretend to be a Christian anymore but
[1:00:13] you are a Christian yeah so he said God
[1:00:17] recognized Abraham's Faith he believed
[1:00:19] God it was imputed to him for
[1:00:20] righteousness that's true but then God
[1:00:23] gave him the seal circumcision as a
[1:00:25] signed to him
[1:00:26] not that his flesh circumcised had
[1:00:28] anything to do with his soul but it was
[1:00:30] a sign that God had recognized his faith
[1:00:33] and he gives us the sign of the Holy
[1:00:35] Ghost that he has recognized us as
[1:00:40] Believers again he said now when we
[1:00:41] receive Christ as our savior and if
[1:00:44] we're sincere in that that that's that's
[1:00:46] important if we're sincere in that then
[1:00:49] God gives us a sign that he has received
[1:00:52] our faith in Christ by giving us the
[1:00:54] Seal of circumcision which is the Holy
[1:00:56] Ghost I don't believe you have to wait
[1:00:57] for years and years to receive the
[1:01:00] baptism of the Holy Ghost I don't
[1:01:03] believe you have to wait one minute
[1:01:05] right if you really believe yeah you can
[1:01:08] receive it yes in fact there's places in
[1:01:11] the in the New Testament where they even
[1:01:13] received it before they were baptized
[1:01:15] because God knew they would go and get
[1:01:18] baptized right and so God confirmed
[1:01:20] their faith because their faith was so
[1:01:22] strong that even when they heard the
[1:01:24] word the the Holy Ghost fell on him
[1:01:26] right then what is it I believe he can
[1:01:29] fall on you this morning while you're
[1:01:31] hearing the word the Holy Ghost can come
[1:01:33] down on you fill you with the Holy Ghost
[1:01:36] yes oh my what it's a seal it's
[1:01:39] something that you know it happened to
[1:01:42] you and again the devil tried to talk
[1:01:44] you out of that but don't listen to him
[1:01:47] you just believe it now he said uh
[1:01:50] that's the Seal of circumcision grieve
[1:01:53] not the holy spirit of God whereby
[1:01:54] you're sealed to the day of your
[1:01:55] Redemption not to the next meeting but
[1:01:57] to the day of your Redemption if you say
[1:01:59] oh I'm a Believer and God has never
[1:02:01] given you the Holy Ghost yet he's never
[1:02:03] recognized it you're just confessing
[1:02:04] that you believe he said but when all
[1:02:07] the doubt he said I'm not saying you're
[1:02:09] not a Believer now in a certain portion
[1:02:11] you are a
[1:02:12] Believer right so all of you this
[1:02:14] morning I believe in a certain portion
[1:02:16] you're a Believer but if you haven't
[1:02:18] received the baptism of the Holy
[1:02:20] Ghost right then then you haven't
[1:02:22] believed in us in a certain portion
[1:02:24] you're a believer but when God has found
[1:02:27] fa or you found favor with him he
[1:02:29] recognizes you to be his child and he
[1:02:32] knows your heart and he sees your
[1:02:34] sincerity he knows all things are cut
[1:02:36] away from you see this is why I don't
[1:02:38] believe you got to work your way up to
[1:02:40] it you say well if I could quit this and
[1:02:41] quit that and quit that but it's not
[1:02:43] working your way God knows that moment
[1:02:45] when you're at the altar that moment
[1:02:46] when you're home kneeling by your bed
[1:02:48] that moment when you're hearing the word
[1:02:50] and suddenly in your heart you say lord
[1:02:52] it's over I'm done with this stuff I'm I
[1:02:54] Repent Lord and that moment you can
[1:02:56] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:02:58] why because he recognizes your sincerity
[1:03:02] he knows you mean it when you repent he
[1:03:04] knows you're going to do everything you
[1:03:05] can to walk away from it and listen you
[1:03:07] can't do it by yourself you need a
[1:03:09] Helper and so he brought a helper he he
[1:03:11] sent his own life back to you to help
[1:03:13] you through
[1:03:15] life amen so you got to have the baptism
[1:03:19] of the Holy Ghost he said he said if you
[1:03:22] you say I'm a Believer God has never
[1:03:23] give you he said you you're just
[1:03:26] confessing but he said when God has
[1:03:28] found favor he said then he seals you
[1:03:31] into the kingdom of God by the Holy
[1:03:34] Ghost proving to the world he has
[1:03:36] accepted now listen what faith you
[1:03:39] profess to have in him so it's not just
[1:03:42] me saying I believe but it's him saying
[1:03:46] him recognizing my faith in Acts chapter
[1:03:49] 7 and verse 6 it it tells the story of
[1:03:53] how uh that God brought abraam out God
[1:03:56] spake on this wise that his seed should
[1:03:58] sourn in a Strange Land remember God
[1:04:01] told Abraham this that they should bring
[1:04:04] them into bondage and treat them evil
[1:04:05] 400 years and the nation to whom they
[1:04:09] shall be in bondage will I judge said
[1:04:10] God and after that shall they come forth
[1:04:11] and serve me in this place and he give
[1:04:14] him the Covenant of
[1:04:15] circumcision so Abraham begat Isaac and
[1:04:18] circumcised him the Eighth Day and Isaac
[1:04:20] beat Jacob and Jacob beat the 12
[1:04:24] Patriarchs so then we know that Joseph
[1:04:26] then is sold into slavery and they were
[1:04:29] removed from the land of promise all of
[1:04:31] those years yeah here God had given the
[1:04:33] promise to Abraham but he said you're
[1:04:35] not even going to be in the land of
[1:04:37] promise for 400
[1:04:38] years but now he said you're going to
[1:04:40] come out we talked about it a few weeks
[1:04:42] ago with a great substance and Moses
[1:04:45] wouldn't take anything less than that so
[1:04:48] he said you're going to come out with
[1:04:49] your flocks with your herds with
[1:04:51] everything that you've got now so they
[1:04:53] had a promise that Egypt would be judged
[1:04:55] and they would come forth with great
[1:04:57] substance there now in when Moses came
[1:05:00] and we know Moses was a a a messenger
[1:05:02] with a message of Deliverance when he
[1:05:05] came there were people there were
[1:05:07] Jews there in that land who had carried
[1:05:09] the Covenant of circumcision down to
[1:05:11] that
[1:05:12] age they they they had as a nation they
[1:05:15] kept that but yet they did not believe
[1:05:19] Moses message right right and God was
[1:05:22] fixing to give them a different token y
[1:05:26] then circumcision to say who could go
[1:05:28] over and who couldn't but the brandom
[1:05:30] calls it separating the bride from the
[1:05:32] church right he was going to separate
[1:05:35] the elect from the non-elect separate
[1:05:38] those who would hear the message and
[1:05:39] those who wouldn't and the way that he
[1:05:41] would do that because to Abraham it was
[1:05:44] the Covenant of circumcision but yet
[1:05:46] there were circumcised Jews who did not
[1:05:48] believe Moses
[1:05:50] message right they were Jews they could
[1:05:52] prove it their firstborn though would
[1:05:56] still die in the in the plague because
[1:05:59] the token changed from circumcision to
[1:06:02] Blood on the doorpost you all know the
[1:06:04] story right and exodus 12:13 it says and
[1:06:08] the blood shall be to you for a token
[1:06:11] upon the houses where you are so it's no
[1:06:13] longer a sign in in our physical flesh
[1:06:16] but now it was a sign of Blood on the
[1:06:19] doorpost a physical Blood Brother BR
[1:06:21] said blood like paint they would take
[1:06:23] the blood like paint and paint the doors
[1:06:25] the post of the door and the blood shall
[1:06:27] be to you for a token upon the houses
[1:06:29] where you are and when I see the blood I
[1:06:33] will pass over you and the plague shall
[1:06:36] not be upon you to destroy you when I
[1:06:38] smite the land of Egypt now watch how
[1:06:41] God changed the Covenant or or or the
[1:06:44] Seal of it he didn't change the Covenant
[1:06:46] but he changed the seal of it he changed
[1:06:48] the token of it and it was no longer
[1:06:50] circumcision alone but now it had to be
[1:06:54] a person who they could be circumcised
[1:06:57] but that wasn't enough it had to be
[1:06:58] someone under the Blood Brother BR said
[1:07:01] get the point now the Jews no matter how
[1:07:03] much they could prove that they were
[1:07:04] circumcised but the token had to be
[1:07:06] showed if not there the Covenant was not
[1:07:09] effective it wasn't same now same thing
[1:07:13] no matter what you do oh I want to I
[1:07:16] want to convey to you this morning the
[1:07:18] importance of it yeah I I want to preach
[1:07:21] to you in a way that you'll understand
[1:07:24] what what how a solemn this is and how
[1:07:27] important this is especially in the hour
[1:07:28] that we live in you young people it's
[1:07:30] the Holy Ghost isn't optional right
[1:07:33] right right it's it's life or death it
[1:07:36] separates those who go in the Rapture
[1:07:38] from those who go in the tribulation
[1:07:41] period right and some of y'all come to
[1:07:43] church and I appreciate that and all of
[1:07:45] us do and I'm not trying to
[1:07:46] dechristianize anybody but if you don't
[1:07:48] have the Holy Ghost Now's the Time to
[1:07:49] get it it's it's not enough just to come
[1:07:52] to a church and hear brother Ben preach
[1:07:54] it's not enough just to sit there and be
[1:07:56] raised in the house of God be raised in
[1:07:58] a Christian home you must receive the
[1:08:00] baptism of the Holy Ghost you've got to
[1:08:02] have the
[1:08:04] token and so he said the same thing no
[1:08:06] matter what you do no matter how much
[1:08:07] you can explain the Bible you might be a
[1:08:10] Bible student you might say I'm a
[1:08:12] Believer in everything but still the
[1:08:13] token is
[1:08:16] required I know that's changed today
[1:08:19] people say well you can just go do this
[1:08:20] or that or go to the certain meeting go
[1:08:23] to a certain Camp go to a certain Church
[1:08:26] uh uh listen to a certain tape and
[1:08:28] that's the token that's
[1:08:31] nonsense right the token is way more
[1:08:33] than that it's way more important than
[1:08:36] that what is it it's a it's a life that
[1:08:39] comes inside of you and lives through
[1:08:43] you now he he said now you're under the
[1:08:46] spirit under the Holy Spirit you're
[1:08:48] under the holy spirit so you can feel
[1:08:50] the effects of it you believe the
[1:08:52] message of the day how many believe the
[1:08:55] message
[1:08:56] I don't believe we should be ashamed of
[1:08:57] that you believe the message some of you
[1:09:00] uh I don't want to get off here but some
[1:09:03] of you have uh have experiences with
[1:09:06] people who were in the
[1:09:07] meetings some of you may have have had
[1:09:11] uh we had a lady here during the
[1:09:13] meetings who was called out on a tape
[1:09:16] and she told me the tape and where it
[1:09:17] was and I went and found it and there's
[1:09:20] people all over this area that were
[1:09:22] called out sister Alexander and we knew
[1:09:24] sister Brown different ones were called
[1:09:26] out and and you could see it was proof
[1:09:29] that God knew the secrets of the hearts
[1:09:32] you believe the message I believe
[1:09:34] there's ever message Believers that that
[1:09:36] you are that you believe the message
[1:09:38] today but see believing the message is
[1:09:40] not
[1:09:44] enough I know people will fight you on
[1:09:46] that but it's it's true it's not enough
[1:09:49] it w't you can believe the message I
[1:09:50] know people who believe the message who
[1:09:51] don't live it at all but they'll tell
[1:09:54] you they believe it they won't hear
[1:09:55] nothing against the prophet right they
[1:09:57] won't hear nothing against brother
[1:09:58] Brandon but they didn't believe in us
[1:10:00] right right they believe but they didn't
[1:10:02] believe in us they may believe enough to
[1:10:04] listen to a tape but not enough to do
[1:10:06] what he said I remember a family in in
[1:10:09] the Dyersburg area they were wonderful
[1:10:11] people and yet but they had vices and
[1:10:13] things in their life and they didn't go
[1:10:15] to church and every once in a while
[1:10:17] they'd show up but but that family that
[1:10:19] more they believe this message they
[1:10:20] would stand for this message they'd
[1:10:21] listen to it and I had a young man
[1:10:23] confess to me he said you know he said I
[1:10:24] could listen to to a tape while smoking
[1:10:27] cigarettes and stand there smoking
[1:10:29] cigarettes and a prophet preach against
[1:10:30] it and amen it and say it was true but
[1:10:33] what did he need he needed more than
[1:10:35] just a an acknowledgement that it was
[1:10:37] true he needed the token
[1:10:43] itself today that young man still
[1:10:45] believes this message but he don't live
[1:10:49] it are you with me now well we don't
[1:10:52] want to do that we want to be more than
[1:10:53] just blessed good you we need to believe
[1:10:55] the message but we want more than that
[1:10:58] he said you under the Holy Spirit you
[1:10:59] believe the message of the day you
[1:11:01] believe the power the pillar of fire you
[1:11:03] believe that see and you do he said now
[1:11:05] look just to believe it is not
[1:11:08] enough oh Church to walk around where
[1:11:11] it's at isn't enough right well that's
[1:11:13] to make yourself
[1:11:15] worse he said for he that knoweth to do
[1:11:17] good and doeth it not to him it's sin
[1:11:19] yeah so at some point it becomes a
[1:11:22] problem because you're hearing it preach
[1:11:24] and you're not doing anything you're
[1:11:25] hearing
[1:11:25] right right at some point that's a
[1:11:28] problem and there comes a hardness and a
[1:11:30] coldness like Pharaoh hearing before
[1:11:32] Pharaoh heard Moses message he he didn't
[1:11:36] have hardness in his heart like he did
[1:11:38] afterwards but as Moses continually came
[1:11:41] Pharaoh's heart was hardened by the
[1:11:43] message by proximity to the
[1:11:46] messenger oh my now look he said to
[1:11:51] believe it's not enough to walk around
[1:11:52] where it's at isn't enough that's to
[1:11:53] make yourself worse he didn't know to do
[1:11:55] good to do it do it not to him in sin he
[1:11:57] said apply it
[1:11:59] church now don't fail he said will you
[1:12:02] now I I'll ask you that question this
[1:12:04] morning you said but brother Ben I I
[1:12:06] know i' I've had the Holy Ghost well
[1:12:08] it's time to put it on
[1:12:09] display right time to apply it in our
[1:12:12] lives he said don't let the sun set
[1:12:15] don't don't don't rest day or night
[1:12:17] don't take no
[1:12:18] chance it won't work children it won't
[1:12:21] work you must have the token all right
[1:12:24] yes you say I believe
[1:12:26] yes I go I yeah I believe the message
[1:12:28] that's all right that's good but you
[1:12:30] must have the token he said do you hear
[1:12:32] brandom Tabernacle you must have the
[1:12:34] token
[1:12:35] displayed oh my without it all you're
[1:12:38] believing is in vain listen that they
[1:12:40] gotten so carnal they they set up a a
[1:12:42] token tape and put that in and say well
[1:12:45] that's the token in your house no it's
[1:12:46] not because if your house burnt down
[1:12:48] you'd lose your
[1:12:51] token if your house flooded you'd lose
[1:12:54] your token
[1:12:55] but this token can't be lost it's a seal
[1:12:58] to the day of your Redemption you
[1:13:00] couldn't deny this message no matter
[1:13:02] what they did to you why it's a token
[1:13:05] it's a seal no matter what you go
[1:13:07] through you'll go through trials you'll
[1:13:09] go through troubles you'll have
[1:13:10] situations in life every one of you
[1:13:12] Elders can speak to these younger people
[1:13:14] and say your life is going to be
[1:13:16] difficult there'll be a tough road up
[1:13:17] ahead but you got to have something
[1:13:19] that'll keep you something that'll keep
[1:13:21] that clock ticking around there's got to
[1:13:23] be a seal in your life
[1:13:25] a token that God says this is a Believer
[1:13:29] this is my child yes sir and that's what
[1:13:32] it'll keep you yeah good understanding
[1:13:35] it's never going to keep you it's a good
[1:13:37] thing to understand that's never going
[1:13:39] to keep you right takes his
[1:13:42] life inside of you you say I believe I
[1:13:46] go but you must have the token said
[1:13:48] without it all you're believing is in
[1:13:51] vain yeah he said you'll live a good
[1:13:54] life you listen to what the word says
[1:13:56] you go to church you try to live right
[1:13:59] that's fine but that's not it when I see
[1:14:02] the
[1:14:03] blood that's the
[1:14:06] token again and I'm taking these things
[1:14:08] from the token message by the brand
[1:14:09] preach in September
[1:14:12] 1963 he said don't just come this far
[1:14:15] and say I believe the message you obey
[1:14:17] the
[1:14:18] messenger well we can stop there for a
[1:14:22] while see a prophet warning I believe
[1:14:25] there was a there's a spirit on the
[1:14:27] earth yeah because if Satan can't get
[1:14:29] you to deny the message and say it's
[1:14:31] false he'll get you to accept it and not
[1:14:34] obey
[1:14:36] it right that's the next step that's
[1:14:38] that's the next best thing in fact Satan
[1:14:40] would almost rather you do that because
[1:14:43] then you'll be deceived you won't be
[1:14:44] looking for nothing
[1:14:46] else right so he trying to get you to
[1:14:48] deny it but if you can't get you to deny
[1:14:49] it he'll get you to accept it but he'll
[1:14:53] he'll get you to accept part of it a
[1:14:55] portion of Faith right and just stay
[1:14:57] there but you can't stay there and I
[1:14:59] believe the elect will go on into
[1:15:02] salvation he said now he said you obey
[1:15:05] the messenger coming to Christ you say
[1:15:07] well I believe every word said brother
[1:15:10] Brandon that's good but that's just
[1:15:13] being able to
[1:15:17] read even you know a person with sense
[1:15:22] ought to be able to believe serpent seed
[1:15:25] you can explain that
[1:15:26] logically to people a person with sense
[1:15:30] ought to be able to believe in in Jesus
[1:15:32] name baptism in the name of the Lord
[1:15:34] Jesus Christ a person just has a head
[1:15:37] knowledge could explain that but the
[1:15:39] random said it didn't even take
[1:15:40] Revelation to believe that right because
[1:15:42] it's so clear right just a person with
[1:15:45] sense ought to be able to do it and
[1:15:47] that's what's happen sometimes preachers
[1:15:48] without the Holy Ghost but they got a
[1:15:50] lot of head knowledge a lot of sense
[1:15:53] yeah right and and and they preach it
[1:15:56] and it comes across and people believe
[1:15:57] it oh church but we need more than that
[1:16:02] we need more than that we need the life
[1:16:04] of that within us but he said don't just
[1:16:07] say you say well I believe every word
[1:16:09] said you say well that that means I have
[1:16:11] the baptism of the Holy Ghost I I think
[1:16:13] you you know an Evidence the evidence of
[1:16:15] the Holy Ghost is is believing the word
[1:16:18] of your day but it's not just it's not
[1:16:22] just a mental Ascent to that word it's
[1:16:24] not not just saying I believe it but
[1:16:28] believing is like Abraham are you with
[1:16:30] me now you got to follow in the
[1:16:32] footsteps of Abraham and so if you
[1:16:35] believe the word you follow the word to
[1:16:38] baptism you follow if you believe what
[1:16:40] acts 238 says you follow him to baptism
[1:16:43] if you believe this message is true
[1:16:45] you'll start listening to it right right
[1:16:47] if you believe that this that that that
[1:16:49] you ought to go assemble yourself
[1:16:51] together you'll come to church right if
[1:16:53] you believe if you really believe you
[1:16:56] say well I believe and you don't do it
[1:16:57] well it shows that you didn't really
[1:16:59] believe your faith wasn't strong enough
[1:17:03] oh but we need a strong faith today to
[1:17:04] be like Abraham not just say well I
[1:17:06] believe every word said but there's a
[1:17:08] comfort to that with some people they
[1:17:10] say well I believe everything brother BR
[1:17:12] said Is is true and so uh that that
[1:17:15] means I must have the Holy Ghost no it
[1:17:17] must be the life inside of you that
[1:17:20] repeats that word
[1:17:22] back oh my
[1:17:26] because you say every word well maybe
[1:17:28] you haven't heard every word are you
[1:17:31] with me now but there might be a person
[1:17:33] who's got one page of one
[1:17:36] book but they've got the Holy
[1:17:39] Ghost right when we were in Egypt we
[1:17:41] realized the whole world doesn't have
[1:17:43] the message right right and what they
[1:17:46] have sometimes is translated in a way
[1:17:48] that don't make a lot of
[1:17:49] sense but if they could get one that
[1:17:51] gets the Holy Ghost and teach that one
[1:17:55] it would begin to
[1:17:56] spread I hope they're hearing me I know
[1:17:59] some of our Egyptian Brothers in fact I
[1:18:01] think brother mcgall was listening today
[1:18:04] a a and and you need one person sir in a
[1:18:08] country to get on fire for God sir one
[1:18:11] person could change
[1:18:13] Egypt it's happened
[1:18:15] before huh Moses went down one person
[1:18:19] went down into Egypt and made a
[1:18:21] difference one person with the baptism
[1:18:23] of the Holy Ghost could make a
[1:18:24] difference in that country where people
[1:18:27] are hungry and wanting to receive the
[1:18:28] word I've been there I've seen it one
[1:18:30] person will think what one person with
[1:18:32] the baptism of the Holy Ghost could do
[1:18:34] in your home you may not have every word
[1:18:36] or every every jot and every TI but
[1:18:38] you've got the Holy Ghost and so
[1:18:40] whatever word you do have you
[1:18:42] believe us having the word like we do we
[1:18:45] got it all on our phones we got it all
[1:18:46] on our tablets we got it all on our
[1:18:48] computers what does that do it makes us
[1:18:49] responsible to it we become responsible
[1:18:53] to it oh a church if could just get the
[1:18:55] Holy Ghost with that are you with me now
[1:18:59] one person can change your family don't
[1:19:01] let the devil lie to you say well it's
[1:19:03] too late that they're too far gone
[1:19:05] they've turned against the message or to
[1:19:06] now one person with the baptism of the
[1:19:08] Holy Ghost that really gets on fire for
[1:19:10] God I'd like to see one young person in
[1:19:12] this church really get on fire for God
[1:19:14] and begin to serve God with all their
[1:19:16] heart one young person could change a
[1:19:18] youth

[1:21:36] preach more on the mark of the beast and
[1:21:38] things that are coming and and brother
[1:21:40] brandom answers that in the token
[1:21:43] message because there's the there
[1:21:45] there's many things that are going on
[1:21:47] right now I believe are fulfillment of
[1:21:50] Prophecy but what God is doing right now
[1:21:53] is the token
[1:21:55] yeah I hope you're hearing me today
[1:21:58] that's what God's going to
[1:22:00] do in the tribulation period what he's
[1:22:03] going to do with the Jews what he's
[1:22:05] going to do right he he's going to he's
[1:22:07] going to there's going to be many things
[1:22:09] done after we leave here and then
[1:22:12] prophecy will be
[1:22:13] fulfilled but for our part we're at the
[1:22:16] end time he said look he said I don't
[1:22:19] see nothing
[1:22:21] left now people can try to take that and
[1:22:23] say well brother BR said all right this
[1:22:24] Trail against that must mean something
[1:22:26] mysterious or something like that how
[1:22:28] you can't make that fit with
[1:22:31] this right if you're going to take it
[1:22:33] literal you can't make it fit with this
[1:22:34] I don't see nothing left you say what
[1:22:37] about the mark of the beast those who
[1:22:38] reject the holy spirit is already marked
[1:22:41] by the
[1:22:45] Beast you say there something coming
[1:22:48] absolutely sure there's a system there
[1:22:51] that's all that will come but BR said in
[1:22:52] literal form but it's already here in
[1:22:56] spirit it's been here since since Jesus
[1:22:59] left when the Catholic Church first
[1:23:01] started and they began to charge for
[1:23:03] novenas and charge for for salvation but
[1:23:07] he said touch not the oil and the wine
[1:23:09] the mark of the beast is always been
[1:23:11] here and and I've seen a theology lately
[1:23:14] and I hope it don't touch us but we're
[1:23:16] influenced by these things in a way
[1:23:18] maybe in the past we wouldn't have been
[1:23:19] I've seen this theology that Revelation
[1:23:22] uh really matters to the church in this
[1:23:23] sense that the Rapture what they're
[1:23:25] saying is there's not really a rapture
[1:23:27] we just all go through the tribulation
[1:23:28] period so everybody get ready I'll say
[1:23:31] this they probably
[1:23:32] will but that's not the
[1:23:35] message right the message is those who
[1:23:37] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:23:39] are like the Israelites under the token
[1:23:42] under the blood they we go home we're
[1:23:44] not getting ready to to to make it
[1:23:45] through the tribulation we're going
[1:23:49] home and he said you say what about the
[1:23:51] mark of the beast those who reject the
[1:23:53] holy spirit's already marked by the the
[1:23:54] Beast the punishment will come later and
[1:23:57] brother Brown goes into that and he
[1:23:58] explains that when Jesus was here he
[1:24:00] only read that part of the scripture
[1:24:02] pertained to the day he was living in
[1:24:04] remember he said he said uh to bind up
[1:24:07] the Brokenhearted the Lord has anointed
[1:24:09] me he said to have bind up the
[1:24:10] Brokenhearted and all of these things
[1:24:12] and when he gets done he said this day
[1:24:14] the scripture is fulfilled but he closed
[1:24:17] the book and didn't finish the chapter
[1:24:19] in fact he stopped right in the middle
[1:24:20] of a verse why did he do that he said
[1:24:23] the rest related to his second
[1:24:25] coming right he said so he was preaching
[1:24:28] the message for that day and brother B
[1:24:30] deals with that and he says he said now
[1:24:33] this is what he's going to do
[1:24:36] today this is what he is speaking
[1:24:38] through his anointed Spirit to the
[1:24:40] church today now is the hour now is the
[1:24:43] time receive it people receive it what
[1:24:45] is what is he speaking receive the
[1:24:47] baptism of the Holy Ghost receive the
[1:24:50] it'll be the message of the church until
[1:24:51] we leave
[1:24:52] here the prim AR message of the church
[1:24:55] is receive the baptism of the Holy
[1:24:59] Ghost
[1:25:00] Hallelujah brother BR said when we see
[1:25:02] those things upon the Earth today oh

[1:28:39] why have you tried to not have grudges
[1:28:41] against churches and against people and
[1:28:42] tried to reach out and go to meetings
[1:28:43] and things because a prophet of God said
[1:28:46] now is the time to quit fussing with one
[1:28:50] another believe the message of the Bible

[1:28:56] and respect one another men respect your
[1:29:01] wives why would he put that in the token
[1:29:05] because when the spirit of Christ is in
[1:29:07] you what did Paul say husbands love your
[1:29:09] wives as Christ loved the
[1:29:12] church when the spirit of Christ is in
[1:29:14] you you brings a respect for your
[1:29:17] wife oh God help us today he said you
[1:29:21] respect your hom let bring your home
[1:29:23] together because remember the lamb this
[1:29:25] lamb is for the home that requires Godly
[1:29:27] leadership I know people don't believe
[1:29:29] in leadership today but God called men
[1:29:31] for a reason called husbands for a
[1:29:33] reason called men to be pastors for a
[1:29:35] reason cuz somebody's got to bring the
[1:29:37] church together somebody's got to bring
[1:29:40] the home
[1:29:41] together are you with me now of
[1:29:44] leadership for a reason and he said not
[1:29:47] bring your home together because
[1:29:48] remember the slam is for the home not
[1:29:50] just one for the whole home had to be
[1:29:52] brought you say well I don't have a
[1:29:53] husband I don't have that opportunity
[1:29:55] but you come together with the word and
[1:29:57] then come together with Christ and let
[1:29:59] and let that be something in your life
[1:30:01] you say well I may have this but build
[1:30:03] it up in your life let it be a strong
[1:30:05] point where you listen to other
[1:30:08] people huh I'm just preaching this
[1:30:10] morning you you forgive me but I just
[1:30:12] feel welcome this morning is is isn't
[1:30:15] the Lord wonderful to
[1:30:17] us you got to listen to to leadership or
[1:30:19] do do you any good huh Rahab had to she
[1:30:24] had to tell the message to her family
[1:30:27] right now she was the one who led them
[1:30:30] she wasn't married but she led her whole
[1:30:33] family to
[1:30:35] Christ right I hope you're hear me today
[1:30:39] she led her whole family as a as a
[1:30:41] single woman we'd call her today she led
[1:30:43] them to Christ as a single uh woman but
[1:30:46] now look how did she do it under the
[1:30:48] influence of Josh of the of the two
[1:30:51] witnesses who come in who were under the
[1:30:53] influence of Joshua she come under
[1:30:56] leadership and when they said hang the
[1:30:58] cord outside the the window she hung the
[1:31:01] cord outside the window and what
[1:31:03] happened to her her whole family was
[1:31:07] saved are you with me
[1:31:10] now oh my we should love each other let
[1:31:14] me believe that
[1:31:15] today bring your home together the lamb
[1:31:18] was for the home not just one for the
[1:31:19] whole home had to be brought everything
[1:31:21] had to be brought and we should love
[1:31:22] each other and Believers should separate
[1:31:24] themselves from the world he said notice
[1:31:26] they were not just yet come together to
[1:31:27] talk about the message they come
[1:31:29] together to apply the blood to apply the
[1:31:31] token that's what you must do Pastor
[1:31:33] Neville now he's preaching to me I just
[1:31:36] put my name in there instead of brother
[1:31:38] Neville's but he's talking to the pastor
[1:31:40] of the church because brother Brandon
[1:31:41] believed in pastors that's what you must
[1:31:44] do Pastor Neville and to this
[1:31:46] congregation trustees deacons to you
[1:31:49] Brethren it's time we laid aside all the
[1:31:51] foolishness of the world time we laid
[1:31:53] everything else we've seen enough now
[1:31:55] till we are positive sure and the token
[1:31:58] must be applied without it you're going
[1:31:59] to perish you must perish that's the
[1:32:01] only thing oh don't come together and
[1:32:03] say I believe it get beneath it get into
[1:32:09] it what it's a token it's the literal
[1:32:12] life of Jesus Christ coming back on the
[1:32:15] believer now there were Jews remember
[1:32:19] when when Christ died there were Jews at
[1:32:21] the temple offering bloody
[1:32:24] Lambs doing everything that the law
[1:32:27] required keeping the letter of Moses law
[1:32:30] but their faith was not
[1:32:32] recognized what was it the Lamb of God
[1:32:35] was on
[1:32:36] Calvary oh
[1:32:38] Church the Lamb of God was on
[1:32:41] Calvary and they tried because what what
[1:32:44] happened it changed from circumcision to
[1:32:46] the literal blood now it would change
[1:32:48] from the literal blood to the
[1:32:51] life right and they offered Lambs and at
[1:32:54] that moment that he died the lamb was no
[1:32:57] longer
[1:33:00] effective and all that you
[1:33:02] get when you slay a lamb today a
[1:33:05] physical lamb is a stinking
[1:33:10] carcass that's
[1:33:11] it that's all you get when you try to
[1:33:14] work your way
[1:33:15] in that's all you get when you try to
[1:33:17] say well I pay my ties and I go to
[1:33:18] church just a stinking carcass there's
[1:33:22] no life in it but if you can believe un
[1:33:25] the salvation of your soul if you can
[1:33:27] believe to the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:33:30] something that seals you into the
[1:33:31] kingdom of God see he made one sacrifice
[1:33:34] forever look at Hebrews chapter 10: 11
[1:33:37] he said every priest standeth daily
[1:33:38] ministering and offering often times the
[1:33:40] same sacrifices which can never take
[1:33:42] away sins but this man after he had
[1:33:44] offered one sacrifice for sins forever
[1:33:47] set down on the right hand of God from
[1:33:49] henceforth expecting till his enemies be
[1:33:51] made his foot stol for by offering Heath
[1:33:54] perfected forever someone say forever he
[1:33:57] had perfected forever them that are
[1:33:59] Sanctified was it on the day of
[1:34:01] Pentecost the Spirit come back on the
[1:34:02] disciples as a token he'd recognized
[1:34:04] their faith listen what he told them in
[1:34:06] Luke 24:49 behold I send the promise of
[1:34:09] my father upon you but te you in the
[1:34:10] city of Jerusalem until you be endued
[1:34:12] with power from on high what was it
[1:34:15] before they could begin their Ministry
[1:34:16] they needed to be sealed before you can
[1:34:18] begin working for God you need to be
[1:34:21] sealed oh my
[1:34:24] we must have the Holy Ghost or we cannot
[1:34:27] manifest the word for our
[1:34:30] day
[1:34:32] Paul Paul found some Baptist Believers
[1:34:35] in Ephesus I'm going to skip through
[1:34:37] some of this brother Robert because I'm
[1:34:38] running out of time but you all know the
[1:34:40] story how that they were baptized under
[1:34:43] John's
[1:34:44] baptism and then said Paul in verse four
[1:34:46] John verely baptized with the baptism of
[1:34:49] repentance saying unto the people they
[1:34:51] should believe on him which should come
[1:34:52] after him on Christ Jesus he said when
[1:34:56] they heard this they were baptized in
[1:34:57] the name of the Lord Jesus and when Paul
[1:35:00] had laid his hands upon them the Holy
[1:35:03] Ghost came on them they spake with
[1:35:05] tongues and prophesied what was it what
[1:35:08] brought the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:35:09] their faith in the word and their
[1:35:12] obedience to it brother BR said full
[1:35:15] obedience entitles us to the Token look
[1:35:18] he said how did Abraham prove his faith
[1:35:20] by by circumcision now look that's how
[1:35:22] Abraham proved his faith how did Moses
[1:35:24] prove his faith how did they do that in
[1:35:26] Moses time the blood was on the
[1:35:28] door right how do we prove our faith
[1:35:31] today are you with me now how do we
[1:35:34] prove our faith is effective the baptism
[1:35:36] of the Holy Ghost right we we don't just
[1:35:39] wait forever listen if it's a struggle
[1:35:42] for you and I know some people that
[1:35:43] struggle for years about whether or not
[1:35:45] they have it and I'll say this I'll say
[1:35:48] this have you fully
[1:35:50] surrendered because if you've not fully
[1:35:52] surrendered you don't don't you won't
[1:35:54] get
[1:35:55] it right but if you fully surrendered
[1:35:57] and repented and your faith is in the
[1:35:59] blood not in a man but in the blood to
[1:36:02] cleanse you from sin you shall receive
[1:36:05] the gift of the Holy Ghost I think
[1:36:07] sometimes people are looking for some
[1:36:08] great emotional experience and I believe
[1:36:10] there is a definite experience but it
[1:36:13] might be as simple as you lifting your
[1:36:15] hands during the service and saying lord
[1:36:16] it's
[1:36:18] me it's for me this service was for me
[1:36:23] and he baptized you with the Holy Ghost
[1:36:25] right there that's
[1:36:27] right you might have done that and then
[1:36:29] the devil fought you ever since you why
[1:36:31] the devil start fighting me so
[1:36:34] much oh you believe to the Holy Ghost to
[1:36:37] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and and
[1:36:39] the devil's trying to take that away
[1:36:40] from you but I'll tell you what you will
[1:36:42] see you'll see a change in your life
[1:36:44] you'll see there's a desire you didn't
[1:36:46] have before to go to the house of God to
[1:36:48] be around God's people to love him with
[1:36:50] all of your heart there'll be something
[1:36:52] there we didn't exist before am oh my
[1:36:56] look brother said the Holy Ghost is our
[1:36:58] witness he is the proof he's the seal he
[1:37:01] is the Bonafide rights he is the
[1:37:04] abstract deed to every word God
[1:37:07] spoke so the word is like a deed that
[1:37:11] you get a warranty deed is what we call
[1:37:13] it you get a warranty deed I could sign
[1:37:15] a deed to you and not even own the
[1:37:17] property right I could I could lie to
[1:37:20] you and and give you a deed but it could
[1:37:22] be fake
[1:37:24] but what do you do you don't just take a
[1:37:26] deed do you huh you shouldn't I spent 15
[1:37:30] years in Land Title work don't just take
[1:37:31] a
[1:37:33] deed if a property is not worth giving
[1:37:36] you an abstract to or a title insurance
[1:37:38] then it's not worth
[1:37:40] buying right because because you don't
[1:37:43] know anybody might have rights to that
[1:37:45] property just because somebody says you
[1:37:48] see the parallel just because somebody
[1:37:50] says they're a Believer doesn't mean
[1:37:52] that God has recognized
[1:37:54] so he said the Holy Ghost is the
[1:37:56] abstract deed to every word God spoke
[1:37:58] not just a deed but an
[1:38:00] abstract Hallelujah see we are not our
[1:38:03] own witness he is our
[1:38:05] witness so possessing a deed to property
[1:38:08] doesn't prove ownership of it it's an
[1:38:10] Evidence but not proof yes you might
[1:38:14] have things in your life you say well
[1:38:15] this happened and this happened and I
[1:38:17] it's an Evidence but the proof is the
[1:38:19] abstract a deed is a claim to rights but
[1:38:22] a deed can be forged but the deed must
[1:38:24] be sent to the Abstract Company the
[1:38:26] title must be searched back to the
[1:38:27] beginning to really have the proof the
[1:38:30] abstract with your name on the front
[1:38:32] look when you get the abstract back or
[1:38:34] today we do title insurance but back in
[1:38:36] the day when you had an abstract you you
[1:38:37] get it back and it's got your name on
[1:38:39] the front because there's a line there
[1:38:41] that has all the people in
[1:38:44] title right and if it says you and
[1:38:46] others you got a
[1:38:49] problem right if it says you subject to
[1:38:51] the terms and conditions you got a
[1:38:54] problem but if you could ever get an
[1:38:56] abstract that just says Ben pruit owner
[1:39:00] Ben pruit grantee Ben prit current owner
[1:39:03] whatever language they use Ben prit and
[1:39:05] I know that's a guarantee the company
[1:39:08] will stand behind it that they search
[1:39:10] old church they've searched it all the
[1:39:12] way back it's a guarantee I own the
[1:39:15] property I can enforce the rights to the
[1:39:17] property the law will stand behind my my
[1:39:21] deed they won't just stand behind a
[1:39:22] warranty deed but they got to stand
[1:39:24] behind the abstract to the deed oh
[1:39:26] Church they oh if you got a deed but the
[1:39:29] abstract comes out in somebody else's
[1:39:30] name that's what the law stands behind
[1:39:33] it's somebody else's name but what
[1:39:35] happened God gave you a deed and he gave
[1:39:38] you an
[1:39:39] abstract Amen brother BR said God gave
[1:39:42] Abraham a promise Abraham believed God
[1:39:44] it was imputed unto him for
[1:39:45] righteousness but he sealed the Covenant
[1:39:47] by the Seal of circumcision God gives
[1:39:50] you a promise potentially that you will
[1:39:52] receive it and you're going to be raised
[1:39:53] up see that's the deed the deed says
[1:39:57] right if the Same Spirit dwells in you
[1:39:58] it also Quicken your mortal body the
[1:40:00] deed said we shall not all sleep but we
[1:40:02] shall all be changed in a moment in the
[1:40:03] twinkling of an eye that's what the deed
[1:40:05] says right it's a promise of a
[1:40:09] resurrection it's a promise you can live
[1:40:11] in L on and sea and not be overcome by
[1:40:13] it it's a promise of healing it's a
[1:40:15] promise of salvation of your children
[1:40:17] it's a promise yes the deed is a promise
[1:40:21] sir but just a promise alone it's not
[1:40:23] what Abraham needed he needed the Seal
[1:40:25] of the
[1:40:26] promise and God give you a promise he
[1:40:29] said potentially that you will receive
[1:40:31] it you're going to be raised up this
[1:40:32] body is going to be glorified with him
[1:40:34] at the end time but you see you've got
[1:40:35] to get a clearance on that deed that was
[1:40:38] literally my job it's what I did I went
[1:40:40] to the courthouse starting up here in
[1:40:41] altta Missouri and I worked over in uh
[1:40:44] in paragold and up in poper Bluff as
[1:40:46] well and my job as I as I went through
[1:40:49] different jobs I've done every job in an
[1:40:50] abstract company my job initially was
[1:40:53] simply to look and see who had a lean
[1:40:56] who had rights and so I had to be very
[1:40:59] careful in search because the company
[1:41:01] would stand behind that search we had
[1:41:04] skin in the game we would stand behind
[1:41:06] it and so I had to very carefully back
[1:41:09] then we went through index cards I'm
[1:41:11] flipping through the cards I'm seeing
[1:41:13] well here's a
[1:41:14] judgment here's a debt that's not paid
[1:41:17] here's a lean here's a
[1:41:19] mortgage right so I was physically going
[1:41:22] through the papers now it's done on
[1:41:23] computer I was going through the papers
[1:41:25] this is this way and this is that way
[1:41:28] and as I was going through it and then I
[1:41:29] prepared document that it was called a
[1:41:32] commitment and see that's as far as many
[1:41:34] people have ever come right they've come
[1:41:36] to the statement the stage where they've
[1:41:38] got the document showing what's wrong
[1:41:40] but it's never been cleared but there
[1:41:43] was a closing agent and I did that job
[1:41:45] for a while too and the closing agent's
[1:41:47] job was to strike off all of that to
[1:41:51] make sure it all got settled it wasn't
[1:41:53] enough in order to sell the house you
[1:41:55] don't just expose the sin but you got to
[1:41:57] clear it
[1:41:58] off glory to God cuz you want to give a
[1:42:01] clear deed oh my listen you don't want
[1:42:04] to go through Leo the sea without a
[1:42:05] clear deed you don't want to make it
[1:42:08] through life you young people getting
[1:42:09] married don't get married until you have
[1:42:10] a clear deed to your salvation you have
[1:42:14] the baptism of the Holy
[1:42:18] Ghost you got a clearance on the deed
[1:42:22] and that clearance is when everything
[1:42:23] someone say everything against it has
[1:42:26] been stricken off and you got the
[1:42:27] abstract to it you got the seal it's
[1:42:30] yours you don't have to call the old sin
[1:42:33] and and argue with it the closing agent
[1:42:35] did
[1:42:38] that Hallelujah I spent many hours on
[1:42:41] the phone with old bankruptcies and old
[1:42:43] cases and attorneys why did I do that so
[1:42:46] they wouldn't have to why do you have
[1:42:48] the Holy Ghost you don't have to argue
[1:42:49] with what happened and and say well I I
[1:42:51] can't ever be the any different I can't
[1:42:53] ever be the same but God said I'm going
[1:42:55] to strike it all off let the Holy Ghost
[1:42:57] come in and clear the deed until you
[1:43:00] know there's therefore now no
[1:43:01] condemnation to them that are in Christ
[1:43:03] Jesus who walk not after the flesh but
[1:43:05] after the
[1:43:06] spirit Hallelujah you got to get a
[1:43:09] clearance on that deed the clearance is
[1:43:11] when everything against it been stricken
[1:43:13] off you got the abstract to you got the
[1:43:14] seal it's yours everything on it belongs
[1:43:16] to you and when we believe listen how
[1:43:19] simple this is when we believe on Jesus
[1:43:22] Christ for our savior and repent and are
[1:43:24] baptized and come up to believe him God
[1:43:28] recognizes our repentance and our faith
[1:43:30] towards him and sends down the abstract
[1:43:33] and the abstract is the Assurance it's
[1:43:36] the guarantee that everything was ever
[1:43:37] held against you you thoroughly repented
[1:43:40] Hallelujah and the property is bought
[1:43:42] and you hold the abstract for the
[1:43:44] Assurance he said let somebody try to
[1:43:46] put you off the land say he belongs you
[1:43:50] with the abstract in your hand I see you
[1:43:52] could have the deed in your hand he'll
[1:43:54] laugh at you right the letter alone but
[1:43:58] if you got the abstract you got the deed
[1:43:59] and you got the
[1:44:01] clearance oh Church you apply the token
[1:44:04] with that
[1:44:05] word what happens he said let him try to
[1:44:08] do there ain't no law in the L do it
[1:44:09] because you hold the abstract there's no
[1:44:11] devil no church or any theology that can
[1:44:14] overstep the boundaries of God's proof
[1:44:16] and Abstract that the baptism of the
[1:44:17] Holy Ghost has recognized Us in Jesus
[1:44:20] Christ we're just as sure to raise as he
[1:44:22] raised CU potentially we've already
[1:44:24] raised in him what does it do to our
[1:44:27] mortal bodies it turns our opinion come
[1:44:29] on Church it turns our opinion changes
[1:44:32] our Notions it sets our affections on
[1:44:34] things which are above and the smoking
[1:44:36] drinking gambling the things you used to
[1:44:38] do is dead it's beneath you you're
[1:44:40] quickened this quickening power brings
[1:44:42] your body into a raptured condition
[1:44:44] already he said notice the Pentecostal
[1:44:46] people if there they got quickened by
[1:44:47] the Holy Spirit listen to me when those
[1:44:49] Pentecostal group up there on the day of
[1:44:50] Pentecost received their abstract Deed
[1:44:52] from God sure J glorified their souls
[1:44:54] they screamed they saw tongues of fire
[1:44:56] separated upon each of them it's so
[1:44:58] quick in their body they couldn't even
[1:44:59] speak in Earthly language anymore it
[1:45:01] quickened their body to a Heavenly
[1:45:03] language the place they're going to oh
[1:45:06] church that's why so many times when
[1:45:08] they receive the baptis of the Holy
[1:45:09] Ghost they spoke in tongues why it's not
[1:45:11] an Evidence what is it it you're just
[1:45:13] changing their
[1:45:15] language to a Heavenly language it's not
[1:45:18] the evidence of the Holy Ghost but it's
[1:45:20] God's doing something are you with
[1:45:23] now the place they going to quickening
[1:45:25] power of God shook their mortal body so
[1:45:27] to their entire mortal language was
[1:45:28] transfigured transformed into an
[1:45:30] immortal language what a quickening
[1:45:32] power what something that belongs if the
[1:45:35] spirit that raises up Jesus from the
[1:45:36] dead dwells in your mortal bodies it
[1:45:38] shall also Quicken your mortal bodies we
[1:45:39] are quickened them by the power of the
[1:45:41] Living God tongues Quicken to a new
[1:45:43] Heavenly language to speak to them are
[1:45:45] rapturing up raising up into a different
[1:45:48] atmosphere than what they had ever lived
[1:45:49] in Hallelujah I got to move on
[1:45:56] brother BR said the abstract was
[1:45:57] designed to give them every promise that
[1:45:59] was on the
[1:46:00] grounds words everything that was in the
[1:46:02] deed the abstract was designed to
[1:46:05] enforce that title to
[1:46:06] them therefore they laid hands on the
[1:46:09] sick they was healed they spoke in new
[1:46:11] tongues they done great signs and
[1:46:12] wonders because that was in God's
[1:46:13] promise when Jesus died redeem that back
[1:46:16] to in the grounds that belonged to sons
[1:46:17] of God he demonstrated what God was
[1:46:20] listen what he says I'm closing in just
[1:46:22] a moment
[1:46:24] he said how dare we to socialize
[1:46:30] that and put it into an organization how
[1:46:34] dare we care what our last name
[1:46:38] is how dare we to socialize that go a
[1:46:42] step further just because you you belong
[1:46:44] to a big church or a small church I
[1:46:46] don't know if we're big or small I don't
[1:46:47] know what we are mediumsized I
[1:46:50] guess I don't I don't how dare are
[1:46:54] we to socialize
[1:46:57] it it's the power of God we don't
[1:46:59] socialize it we treat people right but
[1:47:02] it's not a social
[1:47:03] Affair we don't put it in an
[1:47:05] organization and say you're the bride if
[1:47:07] you listen to this you're the bride if
[1:47:10] you believe this Doctrine you're the
[1:47:12] bride if you follow this man it's
[1:47:14] nonsense how dare we to socialize that
[1:47:18] put it into an organization we have no
[1:47:20] no rights to do that I don't control the
[1:47:23] baptism of the Holy Ghost listen we
[1:47:25] baptize people here sometimes I go to
[1:47:27] other churches I'm completely fine with
[1:47:29] that right why because if they receive
[1:47:32] the baptism of the Holy Ghost God gets
[1:47:34] to lead them where they go are you with
[1:47:37] me now how dare we to socialize that
[1:47:40] it's just our church that'll make it
[1:47:42] it's
[1:47:43] nonsense have no rights to do that it's
[1:47:45] the Holy Spirit today hunting out honest
[1:47:48] hearts that will believe that message
[1:47:50] everything in the Bible that was
[1:47:51] promised is to that belever and when you
[1:47:53] accept it in his fullness and God knows
[1:47:55] that you'll do it he gives you the
[1:47:57] abstract to that and then every promise
[1:48:00] that's made is in your possession and
[1:48:03] the Holy Spirit is there to Quicken that
[1:48:04] to you oh my what kind of people should
[1:48:07] we be oh my you say well that means it's
[1:48:09] all over then no that just means you
[1:48:11] entered into the
[1:48:12] land now it's time to fight you remember
[1:48:15] I think it was brother Shawn made the
[1:48:17] statement he said when they entered the
[1:48:18] land he said the promises became real
[1:48:21] and so did the Giant
[1:48:25] the promises were just a story but the
[1:48:28] Giants were just a story too depends on
[1:48:30] which story you're going to
[1:48:32] believe right whose report are you going
[1:48:34] to believe well they believe God's
[1:48:36] report when they got there the promises
[1:48:38] was real the Giants were real Caleb
[1:48:41] never said there's no Giants in the land
[1:48:43] what did he say we're more than able to
[1:48:45] take the
[1:48:47] land God never did say when you receive
[1:48:49] the baptism of the holy ghost things
[1:48:50] will go easy some of you young Christian
[1:48:52] you need to hold on to the horns of the
[1:48:54] altar hold on to God God never said it'd
[1:48:57] go easy he never said your bank account
[1:48:59] would look good and and all your
[1:49:01] relationships would just be magically
[1:49:02] healed and everything would take no but
[1:49:04] he said there's the power to do that you
[1:49:07] got the rights to it you just got to go
[1:49:08] claim it and possess
[1:49:11] it musicians go ahead and come you say
[1:49:14] brother Ben I I struggle with knowing
[1:49:16] whether I have the token or not brother
[1:49:18] Brandon preached desperations after he
[1:49:21] preached the token Sunday morning
[1:49:23] the three-hour sermon and then he comes
[1:49:25] back that night and preaches
[1:49:26] desperations has a prayer
[1:49:29] line and when he preached
[1:49:32] desperations and if I was going to
[1:49:34] listen to the Token I'd listen to
[1:49:35] desperations right after it's
[1:49:38] important because brother brand picks up
[1:49:40] on that he said I can feel a spirit he
[1:49:43] said people say how do I
[1:49:44] know how do I know brandom how do I know
[1:49:49] he said look what were
[1:49:51] you and what are you
[1:49:56] yes there is how you know it wouldn't be
[1:49:59] faith if we got some kind
[1:50:02] of we got some kind of letter from the
[1:50:05] pastor told us now you have the Holy
[1:50:07] Ghost plus he could be
[1:50:09] [Music]
[1:50:11] wrong there's no faith in
[1:50:14] that but look what were you not how many
[1:50:18] tapes did you listen to how many
[1:50:19] services did you go to did you always
[1:50:22] get just exactly 10% of your ties you
[1:50:26] know what were
[1:50:28] you what are
[1:50:30] you there is how you know what was you
[1:50:34] before this token was applied what are
[1:50:37] you after it's
[1:50:41] applyed Raab sat in that house and she
[1:50:44] said I'm going to apply the token
[1:50:46] before her family was divided but now
[1:50:49] they come together under a promise amen
[1:50:52] and when death came all around them
[1:50:55] listen to me Church death is in the land
[1:50:58] death is all through leoda you said well
[1:51:00] I don't know whether I want to serve God
[1:51:02] or not there's death in the land there's
[1:51:05] death in the pot it's full of
[1:51:08] death it was death all around her houses
[1:51:11] started crumbling to her right houses
[1:51:13] started crumbling to her left and her
[1:51:15] house was right on the wall it should
[1:51:17] have
[1:51:18] fell but it didn't fall
[1:51:23] hallelujah what were you Rahab and what
[1:51:26] are you and brother B said she she
[1:51:29] married that that that Prince among the
[1:51:31] people that General and what did she
[1:51:32] become he said she got a house in
[1:51:34] Bethlehem she'd come from a place of
[1:51:36] harlotry to a beautiful home in
[1:51:38] Bethlehem what were you and what are you
[1:51:41] today this is how you
[1:51:44] know what was you before this token was
[1:51:47] applied what are you after it's applied
[1:51:49] what was your desires before and what is
[1:51:51] your desire is after then you know
[1:51:54] whether the token is applied or not and
[1:51:56] these other things he's talking about
[1:51:58] tongues and signs and all of that will
[1:52:00] just automatically go with that right
[1:52:03] not everybody speaks in tongues not
[1:52:05] everybody shouts but we all
[1:52:08] change we all change we all sitting
[1:52:11] there like Rahab once we believe the
[1:52:13] message and we watch DEATH coming all
[1:52:14] around us can you imagine being there
[1:52:16] under the token when Moses spoke that
[1:52:19] and the death angel in every home there
[1:52:21] was there was a a mayy
[1:52:23] dying but in the homes of the
[1:52:26] Believers there was
[1:52:29] life oh my I believe it's that way
[1:52:33] today would you bow your heads with me I
[1:52:35] know
[1:52:36] people I know people are down on this
[1:52:38] message and say well it doesn't produce
[1:52:40] nothing I challenge that I challenge The
[1:52:44] [Music]
[1:52:46] Narrative compare where we're at with
[1:52:49] where the world
[1:52:51] is just comp compare it for a moment
[1:52:53] compare where we're at to where the
[1:52:54] worldly church is I'm not trying to make
[1:52:57] you feel special or above people that's
[1:52:59] it ought to Humble us today compare
[1:53:02] where you're at the opportunity that you
[1:53:03] have in your life to live for God and
[1:53:05] love God with all your heart compare
[1:53:09] that compare it with what you
[1:53:12] were compare where you're at today
[1:53:15] you'll have to come to this conclusion
[1:53:17] this message
[1:53:19] Works what the messenger said was true
[1:53:22] what he said wasn't to follow him he
[1:53:24] said not for one moment do I bring a
[1:53:26] message so people would follow me but
[1:53:28] that they could have a deeper
[1:53:29] relationship with Jesus Christ they
[1:53:32] could come under the token and be
[1:53:37] saved every head bowed and every eye
[1:53:39] closed if you've
[1:53:40] never never received the baptism of the
[1:53:43] Holy Ghost why don't you believe to it
[1:53:45] this
[1:53:46] morning believe to it just believing is
[1:53:49] not enough but you believe to it it's
[1:53:51] it's a real experience with God believe
[1:53:54] to it you hold on to that maybe you're
[1:53:57] not sure well where were you take an
[1:54:00] honest appr praisal where where were you
[1:54:02] and what are
[1:54:03] you then you can know and let the Holy
[1:54:06] Ghost bring Assurance in your heart
[1:54:08] maybe you're a Christian today that you
[1:54:12] feel kind of backslid but you know you
[1:54:14] received the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:54:15] you know that but you just kind of
[1:54:17] backit on God why don't you just talk to
[1:54:20] God for a minute yourself and say Lord I
[1:54:23] I know that I I'm not where I should be
[1:54:25] Lord would you refill me with the Holy
[1:54:28] Ghost today not that he ever left you
[1:54:31] but it just lost its effect on you you
[1:54:34] just don't have feel the same in the
[1:54:36] service anymore it's got less effect see
[1:54:38] the token was a visible Sign In the
[1:54:40] Flesh it's got to be something that has
[1:54:42] a real effect in our lives you say
[1:54:45] brother brother Ben I want you to pray
