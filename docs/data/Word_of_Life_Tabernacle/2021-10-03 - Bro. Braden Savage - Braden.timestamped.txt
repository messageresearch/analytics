[0:00] find some food he said i'm going to wait
[0:02] here
[0:03] so he sends his disciples away
[0:05] why
[0:06] because he knew
[0:08] that he was desiring fellowship with
[0:10] someone
[0:13] so he's waiting at the well and all of a
[0:16] sudden he looks coming down the road and
[0:17] there's this woman carrying uh a pot
[0:22] oh she looks rugged she looks she looks
[0:24] uh a wore out jesus knew what kind of
[0:27] woman she was
[0:28] but it didn't bother him
[0:30] oh my sometimes when those kind of
[0:32] people walk into our churches we begin
[0:34] to get judgmental we begin to look down
[0:37] upon them and say oh how can they ever
[0:39] receive what we've got listen in church
[0:41] if that's your attitude here this
[0:43] morning you need to find an altar
[0:44] somewhere and get right with god amen
[0:47] because that's the kind that god came to
[0:49] i remember where i was amen when god say
[0:52] my soul and many times we need to go
[0:55] back and remember what we was before god
[0:57] saved our soul
[1:01] amen so here she came he began to tell
[1:04] her the secrets of her hearts amen the
[1:06] very things that she was that she was
[1:08] going and how she had had
[1:10] five husbands and the one she was living
[1:12] with was not hers it was someone else's
[1:14] and and and as he began to to discern
[1:17] her and tell her these things amen
[1:19] something had been opened to her and he
[1:22] and and she realized that this is the
[1:24] messiah amen that i was taught about
[1:27] amen
[1:29] by my mother and by my father this is
[1:31] him amen and she went into the city and
[1:34] began to tell everybody amen about this
[1:37] risen savior that this savior that has
[1:39] come let me tell you a woman that was a
[1:42] prostitute amen went into the city with
[1:45] a testimony that he's here the messiah
[1:48] is here
[1:50] both were hungering she was hungering
[1:53] for something greater than a natural man
[1:56] say man he was hungering amen for
[1:59] something and when those two desires met
[2:02] amen it brought peace it brought
[2:04] satisfaction amen it took all of her
[2:07] frustrations away
[2:10] hallelujah
[2:11] oh to think that jesus
[2:14] thirsts and hungers for your fellowship
[2:16] this morning
[2:20] five minutes in the presence of jesus
[2:23] all her questions and all her doubts
[2:25] were dissolved all of her frustrations
[2:28] were no more everything became crystal
[2:30] clear to her
[2:32] what a hiding place
[2:34] hey man it wasn't in a great revival
[2:36] meeting
[2:38] it wasn't where everyone was dancing and
[2:40] shouting around the church it was her
[2:43] and jesus alone
[2:48] something was happening in the heart
[2:51] instead of on the outside
[2:55] i believe
[2:58] i believe
[3:00] that we have be we have come to a real
[3:03] crucial time in the ranks of the message
[3:08] i'm going to say these i'm going to say
[3:09] this and i've said it to the church
[3:12] and i want to say this here
[3:14] i'm not scared
[3:15] of who might call me
[3:17] but this is a real crucial time that we
[3:19] have come to in the ranks of the message
[3:22] to where if you're not having a meeting
[3:23] once a month
[3:25] amen and and you're not on your feet
[3:28] shouting and dancing around the church
[3:30] you're just not a spiritual person
[3:34] that's the biggest lie from the devil
[3:36] that you'll ever hear
[3:41] paul said this
[3:42] paul said this
[3:44] though i speak with tongues of men and
[3:46] angels and have not charity now brother
[3:49] braden are you saying that you're
[3:51] against shouting are you saying you're
[3:52] against dodging nope i've done it all
[3:54] myself i'm not against none of those
[3:56] things
[3:58] but if we if we emphasize so much upon
[4:02] those things have we not done the same
[4:04] thing that pentecost did
[4:06] amen and and say that you got to speak
[4:09] in tongues amen and you received the
[4:11] holy ghost have we not done the same
[4:13] thing listen church i'm not just
[4:15] desiring to go back to pentecost amen
[4:18] we've got something greater in this day
[4:20] amen that god has given us a message of
[4:22] malachi 4 that not only restores us back
[4:25] to pentecost the restoration of the
[4:27] gifts amen but we'll get us out of this
[4:29] past house
[4:31] amen and we've got to be able to stand
[4:32] still long enough that the word will
[4:35] dress us in this day
[4:36] and find amen the will of god for our
[4:39] day
[4:42] though i speak with tongues i'm in
[4:43] angels and have not charity i am become
[4:46] as a sounding brass or a tinkling symbol
[4:49] and though i have the gift of prophecy
[4:51] and understand all the mysteries and all
[4:54] the knowledge and though i have all
[4:56] faith
[4:57] so that i can remove mountains and have
[4:59] not charity i am nothing
[5:04] and though i bestow all my gifts to feed
[5:07] the poor and though i give my body to be
[5:10] burned and have not charity it profiteth
[5:12] me nothing
[5:19] the emphasis
[5:21] have been turned from the most important
[5:22] thing to outward manifestations like
[5:24] pentecost
[5:28] preachers have even become
[5:30] to the spot that if they can't get
[5:32] everyone on their feet
[5:34] then they just didn't have church
[5:38] emotions are all right
[5:41] i know the prophet even said
[5:43] that a dead fish can't float upstream
[5:45] but you get one woman's life in it and
[5:47] it'll buck the currents i understand
[5:48] that
[5:50] but i frayed that we are getting that
[5:52] type of emotions that he's speaking of
[5:54] amen mixed up with what what is going on
[6:01] i believe as a holy ghost-filled person
[6:03] i've got emotions
[6:06] is that right
[6:07] i believe i've got emotions amen this
[6:10] kind of emotion that when trials come
[6:12] and they hit me hard i've got an anchor
[6:14] in the inside that will keep pushing me
[6:16] forward amen it's not a shout all the
[6:18] time it's not a hallelujah all the time
[6:21] sometimes it is but not all the time
[6:24] it's something that will anchor me it's
[6:26] something that will buck the currents of
[6:28] life
[6:32] emotions are right and i'm glad when god
[6:34] drops in an extra handful for us
[6:37] but emotions won't take you very far
[6:42] i just got done listening to the prophet
[6:44] you can take elijah in the bible
[6:46] amen monday morning's going to roll
[6:49] around
[6:51] after a good emotional meeting
[6:55] and troubles are going to come your way
[6:58] and if all you've got is a foundation is
[7:00] emotions you're gonna find yourself in a
[7:02] wreck
[7:04] because when troubles start coming in
[7:06] like a flood amen and all you've got is
[7:09] a foundation is emotions your emotions
[7:11] are gonna be here they're gonna be like
[7:13] a roller coaster up one day down one day
[7:15] up one day down one day amen but if
[7:17] you're anchored in god's word amen you
[7:20] can weather the storms amen why because
[7:22] you know the anchor holds it's in the
[7:25] cleft of the rock
[7:26] it's not in your it's not in your spirit
[7:29] realm amen where there's reasoning
[7:31] imaginations emotions it's not in that
[7:34] it's not anchored in that it's not
[7:35] anchored in your outside five senses but
[7:37] it's anchored amen down in the soul
[7:40] where the word of god has been put put
[7:42] in there and you can anchor on that
[7:49] the pentecostal said
[7:51] clap your hands
[7:53] and shout
[7:54] till you speak in tongues and you've got
[7:56] it
[7:57] but we found out
[7:59] we didn't have it
[8:01] there's one more thing left he says and
[8:03] god take me to a cave where i can find
[8:05] it let's get that still small voice
[8:08] that's something that puts the cream in
[8:10] the life
[8:12] that's something that though you speak
[8:14] in tongues of men and angels and have
[8:15] not that you're nothing
[8:17] though you can prophesy and speak with
[8:19] tongues and show signs and wonders and
[8:22] work miracles and do great signs but if
[8:24] that little still small voice isn't in
[8:27] there you're nothing says the scripture
[8:30] that's what we're listening for now
[8:34] but burnham declares that he said that's
[8:36] what we're listening for
[8:38] now
[8:41] now watch what he says
[8:44] he says we've had the thunders
[8:46] we've had the fire
[8:48] we've had the rushing mighty winds and
[8:50] the earthquakes but god send us that
[8:53] still small voice he said that's what we
[8:56] need
[8:57] listen brother we need that still small
[8:59] voice a still small voice that spoke
[9:02] jesus said you couldn't hear his voice
[9:04] in the street you didn't hear him crying
[9:06] he was our pattern look at him he was
[9:08] compared his spirit like a dove gentle
[9:12] it's a great things or quiet things did
[9:14] you know that friends he said great
[9:16] things are quiet things
[9:20] oh brother braden you're saying we can't
[9:22] jump shout no more no i'm not saying
[9:24] that church
[9:32] do you realize that the sun
[9:34] is roughly 109 times bigger than the
[9:37] diameter of the earth
[9:41] google says that one million earths
[9:43] could fit inside the sun
[9:46] and yet it rises in the morning and sets
[9:49] in the evening and we never hear it
[9:52] great things are quiet things
[9:58] i think many in the ranks
[10:00] have forgotten the core principles
[10:02] core principles of what malachi 4
[10:05] brought to us
[10:08] the message of the hour is not just
[10:10] bringing us back to pentecost
[10:12] if so then why didn't the first church
[10:13] rapture
[10:17] but the message of malachi 4 is to bring
[10:20] the furtherance of the word amen the
[10:23] opening of the word of those seven seals
[10:25] amen to stabilize us to weather every
[10:28] storm
[10:29] amen a rock amen of revelation that
[10:32] brings stability in the times of storms
[10:35] a peace that is there in the midst of
[10:38] the darkest times
[10:40] to bring such a groaning for lost souls
[10:47] let me read you something
[10:49] if i can find it
[10:54] in the message
[10:55] in 65 the message christ is revealed in
[10:57] his own word
[11:00] brother branham said this he says now
[11:02] the stabilizers have been put on the
[11:05] ship
[11:07] now he's talking about the great
[11:08] revivals
[11:10] amen are over he says
[11:12] he says as a nation the revival is over
[11:15] it is no more
[11:17] and he says but now the stabilizers have
[11:19] been put on the ship great and fearful
[11:21] waves are out before us but we know just
[11:23] beyond that wave yonder we're nearing
[11:26] the store he says so just stay stabled
[11:29] in the word he says stay with god
[11:34] stay with god
[11:38] he was talking about the great revivals
[11:40] are over
[11:42] so many are trying to relive that
[11:46] amen and missing the more that god
[11:48] amen is desiring for us to live
[11:52] many are living from meeting to meeting
[11:54] and if a person wanted to not have a
[11:56] home church amen he could actually go to
[11:58] church every sunday and have a meeting
[12:01] to go to
[12:03] meetings are great i love going to
[12:05] meetings
[12:06] but brother branham called those people
[12:08] who live from meeting to meeting
[12:10] camp meeting cramps
[12:13] they think oh i've got to go here before
[12:16] god can do something for me
[12:19] i've got to go over here where this
[12:20] great man of god is before i can be
[12:23] healed i've got to go here where this
[12:25] great man of god is and this group of
[12:28] people is amen before god can reveal
[12:30] himself to me church he can reveal
[12:32] himself to you amen he can give you the
[12:35] holy ghost on the backside of the desert
[12:37] out in the deer woods he can do whatever
[12:39] he wants to when you're willing to
[12:41] surrender everything to him amen god can
[12:44] come down
[12:46] hey man i was listening this morning
[12:47] brother branham said that there was a
[12:48] man they were out at the shooting range
[12:50] shooting gallery and they were shooting
[12:52] he was a great businessman of some sort
[12:55] and he and he looked at brother branham
[12:56] he said brother branham he said he said
[12:58] i don't have that holy ghost that you're
[13:00] talking about that you have he says i
[13:03] want that holy ghost do you thank god
[13:05] amen would allow me to have it brother
[13:07] brahm said sure it's for you brother
[13:10] and he said well i'll tell you what i'll
[13:12] do he said i'll go i'll go up here into
[13:14] the city and i'll rent one of these nice
[13:17] big hotel rooms amen that's real nice
[13:19] and real plush and we'll go in there and
[13:22] maybe god will give me the holy ghost in
[13:24] there he said sir you don't need that
[13:26] fancy hotel room he said god can meet
[13:29] you right here
[13:31] and that man said you mean in a shooting
[13:33] gallery he said he can meet you anywhere
[13:35] that you can open your heart to
[13:37] receiving
[13:38] hey man it's not in the big numbers it's
[13:41] not in the biggest meetings church amen
[13:43] when you open your heart and say god i
[13:45] want more of you he can meet you there
[13:48] it may be on the way to work sisters or
[13:50] brothers it may be amen when you least
[13:53] expect it but god can meet you there
[13:58] we're running to meetings here in a
[14:00] meeting here and this man of god here
[14:02] and this man of god here and we're
[14:04] missing the most important thing that's
[14:06] having a relationship with god
[14:10] i know we've got great men in this day
[14:12] i'm not downing them
[14:15] but many are getting their eyes on them
[14:25] go back
[14:26] brother branham
[14:28] talks about in the message perfect
[14:29] strength by perfect weakness
[14:32] before he even starts his ministry
[14:35] his message
[14:36] he's talking about the servant before
[14:39] that he made a statement where
[14:41] that he didn't really just agree with
[14:43] altar calls
[14:44] you probably remember the sermon
[14:47] and and and he was getting some flack
[14:49] about it so he comes along in perfect
[14:52] strength by perfect whitney and he
[14:53] explains this he said he said it's not
[14:55] that i'm against altar because he said
[14:57] i've made a many one myself and i'll
[14:59] make many more
[15:01] he said but what what happens is he says
[15:04] when we call an altar call he said
[15:07] he said when you shouldn't even have to
[15:09] call an altar call if god is dealing on
[15:12] a person amen god's already doing the
[15:14] work let him work
[15:17] he said but men they begin to collect
[15:20] too much
[15:30] lord help me
[15:39] let me just tell you this church
[15:42] i've been a part of some great prayer
[15:44] lines and i've seen some great
[15:46] things take place
[15:48] just to let you know that i'm not
[15:50] against prayer lines
[15:51] but i've also seen the other side of it
[15:55] in the same prayer lines
[15:58] they'd call all the ministers to come up
[16:02] and i would just come and take a place
[16:08] and because
[16:09] i wasn't in their little group
[16:12] they took me
[16:14] and said here
[16:15] we're going to place you back here
[16:17] at the end of the line
[16:19] and we're going to place this one with
[16:21] great faith
[16:23] in your spot
[16:27] you see
[16:28] men
[16:30] begin to collect too much
[16:32] and it's not what god wants
[16:35] they're forgetting the main thing
[16:39] how did he know what kind of faith i had
[16:42] how did he know the things that god has
[16:43] done through my life
[16:50] i'm not interested in man's work
[16:53] neither should we be as the bride of
[16:54] jesus christ we should be interested in
[16:57] what god is doing
[16:59] amen and make sure that we are amen in
[17:01] that in that hiding place amen
[17:04] reflecting amen the very life of jesus
[17:06] christ
[17:15] still love me
[17:21] this is why i believe it's a real
[17:23] crucial time
[17:28] brandon refers to this in the vision
[17:31] that he's seen of the three pulls of his
[17:32] ministry
[17:34] he refused to that he refers to that
[17:36] light going over and hanging over a
[17:38] little building
[17:40] many has taken it that he's got to come
[17:42] back and and preach and attend well if
[17:44] you if you go and you listen to it amen
[17:47] his his attention is off the big tent
[17:50] it's not on the big tent no more but
[17:52] it's where that angel of the lord is
[17:54] hanging over it's a little wooden
[17:56] building he said
[17:57] he said that's where the attention amen
[18:00] was that that his focus was on it wasn't
[18:03] on the big tent no more but it was on
[18:05] the little building and brother branham
[18:06] even referred to it in one spot as a
[18:09] little closet or something
[18:12] and he refers to that light going over
[18:15] and hanging over a little building and
[18:16] he actually refers to us as a closet and
[18:18] the angel of the lord told him i'll meet
[18:21] you in there
[18:23] and he also said that this is the third
[18:25] pull and it will not be a public show
[18:30] and the angel of the lord gives him
[18:31] scripture to back it up and he begins to
[18:34] quote jesus and when thou prayest thou
[18:36] shall not be as the hypocrites are for
[18:38] they love to pray standing in the
[18:40] synagogues and in the corners of the
[18:42] streets that they may be seen of men
[18:44] verily i say unto you they have their
[18:47] reward but i'm looking for a greater
[18:49] reward
[18:52] be thou when thou prayest enter into thy
[18:54] closet and when thou hast shut thy door
[18:57] pray to thy father which is in secret
[18:59] and thy father which seeth in secret
[19:01] shall reward thee openly
[19:16] brother branham said the first pull
[19:18] was when he would lay his hands upon the
[19:20] person
[19:21] and he would
[19:22] know what they were suffering with
[19:25] he said the second pool come along and
[19:27] it was the discerning of the hearts he
[19:28] could look down and without touching him
[19:30] and laying hands upon them and be able
[19:32] to see amen what their condition was
[19:35] what was going on in their lives and he
[19:37] would begin to discern and call those
[19:38] things out
[19:40] but he said the third pull was those
[19:42] revelations of those seven seals coming
[19:44] forth he said and being made known is
[19:46] that right
[19:48] he said that third pull he said you know
[19:50] we want to we want to we want to we want
[19:52] to look at all the shouting we want to
[19:53] look at all the dancing we want to look
[19:55] at all that and then they want to say
[19:56] that we're in the third pool this is the
[19:58] third pull those things come under the
[20:00] second pole
[20:02] but we're not in the second pool no more
[20:04] we are in the third paul ministry church
[20:07] where god is speaking his word through
[20:09] his bride amen we cannot speak his word
[20:12] if we can't find that hiding place
[20:15] amen brother branham said that room amen
[20:18] he said the angel told him he said i'll
[20:20] meet you in there amen and there is
[20:22] where that third pool opened
[20:25] i'll meet you in there
[20:27] you want the third pool open in your
[20:29] life go in there
[20:31] amen it's not a natural building that we
[20:33] got to go to we don't have to go to
[20:35] headquarters in jeffersonville we don't
[20:37] have to be in this church it's not your
[20:39] pastor it's not your mother it's not
[20:41] your father amen it's finding that
[20:43] secret hiding place that you and god is
[20:45] alone and you can meet him there and he
[20:48] can meet you there
[20:58] brother branham said eliezer sweated it
[21:00] out
[21:01] until he found character
[21:04] after he found character
[21:07] then he had to get her to stand still
[21:09] long enough to listen to his message
[21:11] of isaac
[21:14] that's the message of the hour church
[21:17] stand still
[21:19] stand still
[21:20] and hear the message
[21:26] how is
[21:27] how is a wife how is a how is a husband
[21:30] ever going to know
[21:32] what her the character of her husband or
[21:35] his wife is if they're always hollering
[21:37] and screaming and they never sit still
[21:39] long enough to listen to him speak
[21:52] mama
[21:54] help us lord
[21:59] moses
[22:00] abraham said this in queen of sheba
[22:02] he said moses knowed the word real well
[22:05] but that blessed hiding place
[22:07] was it not ridiculous was it not
[22:09] ridiculous to see moses standing in a
[22:11] king's court with all the celebrities
[22:14] with the finest of language trained in
[22:16] all the wisdom of the egyptians and
[22:18] smart but god had to take him out behind
[22:20] the mountain for 40 years
[22:23] god's schooling is always right amen
[22:26] god's schooling is his man and remember
[22:29] as trained as an egyptian a sheepherder
[22:32] was an abomination and it isn't it
[22:34] strange to see how foolish it would seem
[22:37] in the hearts of men with wisdom with a
[22:39] man with all of his great intelligence
[22:41] with all of the great armies of egypt
[22:43] laying at his command that he could do
[22:45] whatever he wished to and would step
[22:47] away from his education watch how the
[22:49] prophet is wording this and would step
[22:52] away from his education step away from
[22:54] his worldly wisdom step away from his
[22:56] great associates
[22:58] and go out behind the desert and become
[23:00] into abomination to the people that he
[23:03] once associated with
[23:05] he said may i say this with reverence
[23:07] it's tonight when god calls me and many
[23:10] times he has to step out of the
[23:11] political ranks out of the social ranks
[23:14] and walk out into a place
[23:17] if it would be necessary if his
[23:19] associates had to say he's gone crazy or
[23:21] become a holy roller but it's that
[23:23] secret place it's that spot he says oh
[23:25] don't miss it church my loyal friends
[23:28] every one of you that's received christ
[23:30] of all your teachings your fine pastors
[23:33] your great affiliations with your
[23:34] churches which is all right don't
[23:36] misunderstand me but you're trying to
[23:38] place that before this
[23:41] but that little time that god gets you
[23:43] away from all your associates gets you
[23:46] away back in the corner and brings you
[23:48] into a place in a secret place where
[23:50] that the wisdom of the world becomes so
[23:53] insufficient to you where all the
[23:56] education that you ever had doesn't mean
[23:58] nothing into that divine presence till
[24:01] the lust of the eye gets so dim you
[24:03] can't see it anymore until the love of
[24:05] money is completely vanished away from
[24:08] you and when you stand there alone with
[24:11] jehovah god
[24:13] that's the thing that counts
[24:15] that's the things that make make you
[24:17] forget all you ever knew
[24:20] that's where moses had to get
[24:23] and what a beautiful picture he said god
[24:25] revealing himself there
[24:27] in a burning bush
[24:29] and moses now watch moses know more
[24:33] about god in five minutes in the
[24:35] presence of that burning bush than he'd
[24:38] learned 40 years in egypt
[24:40] that's the place to be alone with god
[24:43] amen that's the place amen amen i
[24:47] believe that's what the prophet amen
[24:49] back in where art thou uh what does thou
[24:51] hear when he said this is what we're
[24:53] waiting for this is what we're looking
[24:55] for amen this is what he was speaking
[24:57] about is that hiding place to be alone
[25:00] with god
[25:02] moses think about this now
[25:05] there he was on the backside of the
[25:06] desert
[25:08] that's where god revealed himself to
[25:10] moses
[25:11] hey man think about this none of this
[25:13] sheep was back there
[25:15] it's very important as a pastor that
[25:17] your pastor gets away
[25:20] amen alone with god
[25:22] amen and finds that place
[25:26] and not only that but it's important for
[25:28] you
[25:29] amen to find that place
[25:31] amen and i guarantee you if you find
[25:33] that place and he finds that place when
[25:36] you come to the house of god you'll be
[25:38] in tune with what's being preached and
[25:40] you'll be able to say amen pastor amen
[25:43] pastor that's the truth
[25:46] amen god was just dealing with me down
[25:48] that yesterday i just had a conversation
[25:51] with the lord yesterday about that
[25:52] praise be to god oh what does it bring
[25:55] it brings stimulation by revelation
[26:00] but there he was
[26:02] none of his sheep was back there his
[26:03] wife wasn't there his children wasn't
[26:05] there his father-in-law jethro wasn't
[26:07] back there none of that was back there
[26:10] amen it was just him and god
[26:14] god revealed himself to him there in the
[26:16] presence of that burning bush and the
[26:18] bible said that when he came off the
[26:20] mountain amen back to his wives and
[26:22] things amen that his whole face shined
[26:25] with the glory of god
[26:28] amen that's what amen the hiding place
[26:31] will do for a believer amen you will
[26:34] come away from there reflecting the very
[26:36] light of god
[26:38] amen amen listen church it's not the
[26:41] rippling waters the prophet said the
[26:43] shallow streams the rippling waters amen
[26:46] that shines and reflects the stars in
[26:48] the heavens no he said but it's the
[26:50] small deep amen steel pool of water that
[26:54] can reflect the the the light of the
[26:56] stars and you could see the stars
[26:58] reflecting even off the water it's not
[27:01] the big rippling waters it's not the big
[27:03] meetings what we're looking for it's not
[27:06] some great man that we're looking for
[27:08] it's jesus that we need a long time with
[27:11] him that's where we need to be
[27:15] i have nothing against meetings i have
[27:16] nothing with shouting i have nothing
[27:18] against all these things but we're
[27:20] getting the cart before the horse many
[27:22] of them amen ain't got an ounce of god
[27:24] in them amen they're more worried about
[27:26] a paycheck amen than they are the souls
[27:28] of the kingdom of god
[27:40] forgive me
[27:44] i believe with all my heart that if the
[27:46] prophet of god was here in this day he
[27:48] wouldn't just be going to the
[27:49] pentecostal church amen and crying out
[27:51] against what they're doing he would be
[27:53] in his own churches
[27:59] where have we got church
[28:01] where are we at
[28:03] we're at the end time
[28:04] and satan is so deceitful
[28:07] that the bible says that he would
[28:09] deceive the very elected if it was
[28:11] possible but it's not possible
[28:13] amen because god said that he would cut
[28:15] the work short amen before that would
[28:18] happen
[28:19] so that ought to show you how deceitful
[28:21] the devil is
[28:23] amen that the only reason that you can't
[28:25] be deceived is because god is going to
[28:27] cut the work short
[28:41] i was in a meeting a while back
[28:44] i was enjoying the word of god
[28:47] just just taking it in
[28:50] i was sitting there
[28:52] people standing up on all sides of me
[28:55] which was fine i wasn't condemning them
[28:58] it was a wonderful time in the presence
[28:59] of the lord
[29:03] i think i might have been me and my wife
[29:05] might have been the only ones that
[29:06] wasn't on her feet
[29:08] but i i just didn't feel that
[29:09] inspiration i was i was hungering for
[29:11] what was being said i wanted to hear it
[29:15] so i was listening in with all that i
[29:17] could
[29:18] because i don't know about you when i
[29:19] come to the house of god
[29:21] i i want to know where my faults are i
[29:23] want to know where i'm wrong i want to
[29:24] know how i can better myself i want to
[29:27] know how i can climb the ladder
[29:30] so i was listening with all all my heart
[29:32] all that was within me
[29:34] all of a sudden the preacher
[29:36] he said
[29:37] if you all felt like these others that
[29:40] are standing you'd be standing up to
[29:47] oh brothers and sisters
[29:52] i want more than just to return to
[29:53] pentecost
[29:56] do you understand what i'm speaking of
[29:58] this morning
[30:06] i wasn't condemning those who were
[30:07] standing
[30:08] but to be condemned
[30:11] for not standing
[30:12] in a message church
[30:15] i say that's a shame
[30:17] i say that's a discredit to the message
[30:19] that the prophet of god brought
[30:21] because he never touched
[30:23] never never taught such stuff
[30:34] well brother brandon what about what do
[30:35] you do about brother branham when he
[30:37] when he talks about uh coming to himself
[30:40] and his he's sitting on the pulpit and
[30:42] his legs dangling over that wasn't in
[30:44] his own church where he taught the truth
[30:48] think about these things
[30:51] most of the time he was speaking to
[30:52] pentecostal people and he knew and he
[30:54] knew what they liked
[30:56] but when it come down to the latter part
[30:58] of his ministry you didn't see him you
[31:00] didn't see him preaching that way very
[31:02] much
[31:03] why because
[31:04] he was coming to something he was trying
[31:06] to bring the people amen further up the
[31:08] ladder amen than just pentecostalism he
[31:11] was trying to bring him above emotions
[31:14] i know these things ain't popular
[31:18] you you find in the word of god where
[31:20] i'm wrong and you come to me you have
[31:22] that you have that obligation
[31:27] yeah there's all kinds of quotes that
[31:29] brother branham talked about
[31:30] you know
[31:32] you got emotions you you there's all
[31:34] kinds of quotes but there's all kinds of
[31:35] quotes that he also talked about the
[31:37] very thing that i'm speaking of
[31:40] so there's got to be a balance
[31:42] there's got to be a balanced church
[31:44] we do not base our our relationship with
[31:47] god on how much we dance and how much we
[31:48] shout
[31:50] that's not what we base it upon that's
[31:52] just emotions that's just that's just a
[31:55] a wave of the holy spirit coming by i've
[31:58] seen many that have shouted and danced
[32:01] and run the church around amen and so
[32:03] loud that you couldn't even hear the
[32:05] preacher amen and go out and sit in a
[32:07] bar room monday through thursday
[32:16] what are we getting them what are we
[32:18] getting people to as ministers i think
[32:20] about this a lot what are we getting
[32:21] people to
[32:23] what are we getting our young people to
[32:33] i'm trying to close i need to
[32:35] before i get stoned
[32:38] brother branham said this and what does
[32:39] thou hear he said why men to suit
[32:42] himself if they don't get a revival once
[32:44] in a while on their spirit notice on
[32:46] their spirit
[32:48] they become so carnal and so indifferent
[32:50] till they get self-styled starchy
[32:53] and self-righteous
[32:56] they read and study and that's good but
[32:57] that ain't the thing we're talking about
[33:00] you know more about the word it's good
[33:02] to know the word but it's better to know
[33:04] the author of the word
[33:06] amen that little something that you
[33:08] leave out hey man that's something in
[33:10] your heart that makes you what you are
[33:12] that's the thing brothers and sisters
[33:15] amen that's the quote that we read while
[33:17] ago that certain thing that puts the
[33:20] cream down in your life
[33:22] that's what i desire
[33:24] that's what i'm longing for
[33:26] amen can we stand together and sing that
[33:28] song
[33:29] in the presence
[33:31] of jehovah
[33:41] let me say this
[33:45] i would rather
[33:48] know my lord
[33:50] in a personal way
[33:51] if i've never shouted one time
[33:54] if i never spoke in tongues one time
[33:56] i would never know the author of this
[33:58] word
[34:00] wouldn't you
[34:01] amen because it's going to take you in a
[34:03] rapture one day
[34:05] when you when that call to go up
[34:08] when you hear that this right here will
[34:10] take you up no one the author will take
[34:12] you up but just having under your belt
[34:15] that i shouted
[34:16] that i spoke with tongues
[34:18] that i prophesied in your name
[34:22] that i had great miraculous healings and
[34:24] all those things
[34:26] that's not going to take a person up
[34:30] i want to have that love in my heart
[34:32] that paul spoke about
[34:34] though i speak with tongues
[34:36] and have not charity
[34:38] i am nothing
[34:40] so let's get in his presence this
[34:41] morning can we do that
[34:43] hey man now i didn't read a quote and i
[34:46] probably should have because i come down
[34:48] on this pretty hard i'll admit
[34:51] but brother branham said
[34:54] he said i wish i could find it because
[34:56] i'll misquote it
[34:58] he said
[34:59] you may never speak in tongues but yet
[35:02] you might
[35:03] but we put all of our emphasis on
[35:04] speaking in tongues
[35:06] he said you may you may never shout but
[35:09] yet you might
[35:10] but we put all of our emphasis on
[35:12] shouting
[35:13] see he's bringing a balance to it he's
[35:15] not against it
[35:16] he done it himself
[35:18] but there's a there's a there's a
[35:20] balanced church
[35:21] and i'm afraid
[35:23] there's a spirit amongst us
[35:25] that is leading us away
[35:27] from that balance
[35:29] and the more we get away from that
[35:30] middle of that road
[35:32] the further off we're going to go
[35:35] it's time to come back
[35:36] come back to what's most important
[35:39] to get in his presence
[35:41] to find yourself lost there to where you
[35:44] don't care about what your wife's
[35:47] cooking or where your next meal is
[35:49] coming from all you're worried about is
[35:51] to get in his presence
[35:53] and you know if you can get in his
[35:54] presence he'll make all wrongs right
[35:57] he'll make everything all your
[35:58] frustrations everything that you're
[36:00] struggling with he'll make it all right
[36:02] oh i believe that let's sing that
[36:05] in
[36:06] the presence
[36:08] [Music]
[36:17] god almighty
