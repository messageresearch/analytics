praise and the glory and the honor for doing that I pray especially for those that are sick Lord and I pray that you lift them up tonight and help them Lord give them encouragement in their Spirit Lord and in their bodies that they can know that you are a Healer or that you are their healer I pray you've granted tonight we ask in Jesus name in amen turn with me if you would to Luke chapter 24. chapter 24 and verse 44 will have you stand while we read the word and then you can be seated we'll read down through verse 49. it's good to have each and every one of you with us tonight and those that are watching by way of stream could have our visitors tonight God bless you thank you for being here a book of Luke chapter 24 and verse 44 while you're turning there I I've been thinking about this year and the end of the year and all the different things that we get to do with our families and things and boy it's my time of year I'll tell you that I I enjoy the food more than anything but also enjoy the fellowship I enjoy being around uh being around other Christians and being around family and all those things so this Sunday would be our last opportunity to eat together before Thanksgiving and just in case you don't have enough meals planned for that week you're welcome to eat with us here at the church in between services and I think some of them are going to fix some turkey and some ham and some different things for the season so you're welcome to do that that'll be our our our gift to you if you come you don't have to bring anything we'll bring enough to feed you I'm sure my wife will not put her on the spot but but you're welcome to come and be a part of that or bring your food and and we'll we'll have two services this weekend and I'm going to preach in the morning and then I'm going to eat and then brother Joel's going to take the afternoon service so he can't eat see before he preaches so but that's all right we'll bear each other's burdens on that day amen do you love the Lord tonight so good to be in church on a Wednesday night beginning to feel a little bit more human so so I'm thankful for that and I trust that you all are doing good and you're here tonight and Trust it'll be a blessing to You Luke 24 44 he said unto them these are the words which I've spoken to you while I was yet with you that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the law of Moses and in the prophets and in the Psalms concerning me then he opened either understanding that they might understand the scriptures and said unto them thus it is written and thus it behooves Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day and that repentance and remission of sin should be preached in his name among all nations beginning at Jerusalem your Witnesses of these things behold I send the promise of my father upon you but Terri ye in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high I pray the Lord would add his Blessing to the word you may be seated mm-hmm what a wonderful thing it must have been to sit in a room with Jesus and have him open the scriptures can you imagine what that must have been like they're sitting with a resurrected Christ yes and him with no limitations on maybe I'll say the wrong thing or do the wrong thing I think about that and I think how many times do I use the wrong illustration or or talk about the wrong thing but Jesus would have had a perfect understanding of the scriptures yes and being the word himself and he was sitting there with them and he was telling them perfectly what was in the scriptures what a what a wonderful time that must have been a a real a real pleasure to sit there and listen to him and all their questions were answered and and yet there was something they needed you'll have to restart that computer to get that to work there was something that they needed before they could begin to do the work that he had for them to do because anytime we are chosen by God how many believe you're chosen tonight by God you're chosen by God if you're chosen by God then there must be a work for you to do there's something that God wants for you to do and and you can be he can train you he can teach you even the greatest Ministries on the earth could teach you and you could sit under them you could even do Miracles and and be under the influence of a mighty anointing and yet you need something to be able to perform the work the specific work that he wants you to do and what's going to do that it takes the Holy Ghost and that's what they yet needed and so he said I don't want you to go out immediately and begin to tell the people about my resurrection I I don't want you to uh to to to uh go out and begin to teach others he said I want you to go up and sit in a room yes until you're endured with power from on high and then when you're endued with power from on high I'm going to give you the ability to do exactly what I want you to do aren't you glad he has that same ability today amen they were our Lord's chosen men they had been chosen for this specific purpose and for this specific time and yet they could not without his power manifest the word of their day yes and so he said I want you to go up he said until you're endued with power from on high now that word endued with power is literally to be clothed in Dynamics Dynamics is the Greek word that means the power or the ability to perform an activity so it's more than just a feeling but it's actually an ability to do what you're supposed to do amen and that's what we need tonight we need the ability to live the word and that is what the dynamic says brother Branham talks about it comes from that word dynamis it is the ability to do what God wants us to do so when you begin to talk from it is the rising of the Sun and begins to uh preached this Easter Sermon as we're studying this tonight he begins to talk about the Dynamics and listen how he describes it he said but now for instance what if we were going to go back to Tucson this afternoon and each of us was going to go in a big Cadillac well that sounds good doesn't it brother Joe I like a Cadillac and and especially back in the day the Cadillac was a great big roomy car a beautiful car and he said it was brand new and all of the seats were made out of dough skin softest leather soft and easy to sit in all the floorboards were plush the steering wheel was nickel plated and had diamond studs all over it and the engine was mechanically tested to be exactly the right engine and the wheels all had the bearings greased up and the tires were all puncture proof and blow out free and I'd all been tested scientifically now I'll just be honest with you I've got a vehicle I've got two nice Vehicles right now and they're both in the shop I got both of them and then they're both they're uh both forbs actually so maybe that's the problem but they're both in the shop and so we're driving Peter's little Saturn and and I've driven it up here today I'm kind of humbled by that I'll be honest with you and it hurts your back to get in and out of it but but it runs hahaha and both the other two were in the shop right now and and so it don't matter how good it looks or how pretty it is how nice the leather is and and how how comfortable the seats are if it don't run it's not going to get anywhere it won't take you anywhere it won't do the work that it was intended to do right but say these these Cadillacs have been pushed off the assembly line both of them and both of them filled up with gasoline yeah that's the running power the gasoline because it is the octane but now when you're going to start them although both of them look just alike now listen church this is so important to us this is so important because we can have everything set just the way we want it to be set in the church we can have everything running smoothly and everything be just right but if he said that the running power is there both of them look just alike but if there's one of them that don't have any Spark yeah any firing power yes now an engine an internal combustion engine is is engineered it's made to run off spark yeah and without spark it'll never go anywhere no matter how much of the other is there the spark has got to be there listen to me church we were not made to run off just the word only right are you hearing me we were not made just to run off the knowledge of the Son of God we were not made just to run off knowledge of the scriptures or knowledge of the message or knowledge of one another but we were made to run off spark yeah right right and you've got to have the other two yeah yeah but you're made to run off spark a church runs on spark right there's got to be a spark of the Holy Ghost or things begin to start falling apart it will not operate the way it's supposed to without the spark yes yes without the empowerment of the Holy Ghost without that Supernatural element Brother game we are unable to be his body on the Earth foreign it will not work otherwise it wasn't engineered that way well you say the power is in the gasoline he said but I don't care how much power is in the gasoline unless there's a spark there to manifest that power are you hearing me tonight unless there's a power there to confirm that that's gasoline it just might as well be water yeah how are you going to prove that it's gasoline because it makes the car run how's it going to make the car run it's got to go through the combustion process and a spark has got to meet with the air and the gasoline yeah oh you hear me now the spark has got to be there in order for it to produce the power to run to the wheels right now we don't need power just to shout with we don't need power to run the aisles with we don't need power that that'd be wonderful but that's not what we need power for that's just the effects of having power but while we need power for is actually to live with yeah yeah it's to perform the works of a bride to be the Bride of Jesus Christ at the end time we need power to be able to do that yes right to love one another right yeah yeah that's right to treat one another right yes just to be Christians yeah yeah you could I can tell you all day how to be a Christian and explain it to you from the Bible but unless there's a spark there of Life it'll never make sense to you you'll never be able to reproduce it see there's a spark there has to be a spark to manifest the power yeah now you could say well the power is on the tapes sure if there's a spark to set it off the power is in the preaching yes if there's a spark to set it off the powers is in the Bible yes right the power's in the gasoline but there's got to be a spark a life to set that off yeah the gasoline represents the word and so no matter how much theologians claim how well you got your church set how much education you got how much like the Bible yeah until that wave sheath remember we talked about that two weeks ago until the Holy Spirit comes upon that person to Quicken that word the gasoline represents the word it's the truth but without the spirit it won't move now let me give you an example of that you could maybe something's been done to you and and there's a problem between you and somebody else now you know that the word says to forgive that person right we know that the Bible says when you stand praying forgive yes right you know it says to do that huh and some of us carry things for years yeah knowing what the word says yes and we'll hear a sermon about forgiveness and it'll eat us up because we know we haven't done it yeah I'm just using that as an example but we'll sit there and not do it anyhow and and and it'll remain that way yeah that word needs to meet a spark yes of the Holy Ghost that'll make us forgive that'll make us because that's what Christians do well I hope you hear me now that's why we need the presence of God Among Us we need the power of God in our services we need God manifesting himself we need not just in our services we need it at home we need to reach a place where we can pray through or we can talk to God and we know he's listening where where we have that that feeling of his presence why we've got to have that spark right in order to forgive like we should that's good how are we going to treat people right now we're going to have brotherly love yes yes unless we have a spark right right and that's what's lacking in so many places but whenever you see any fruit of the spirit lacking in your life Joy yeah right you know the Bible says count it all joy but that's just difficult isn't it yes yes when you're just living your everyday life and and you find yourself going through trial after trial after trial and the kids just keep getting sick and and the people just keep getting sick and and the job keeps getting harder and the world keeps getting worse and everything keeps getting darker and darker and darker and politics is messed up and and the church seems messed up everything seems like it's going down and we begin to look at it and think where or where do I find where can I find joy you need a spark to make that word live in your life you can say I know I'm going through a trial but there's joy in my heart yes in spite of the trial I can have joy are you with me tonight yeah yeah I know it's hard to be joyful when you don't feel good I know what that feels like I don't feel as bad as some of y'all do because I'm not that old but I know what it's like to feel bad and stand up here in the pulpit and feel bad but he said count it all joy yeah and again what do I need a spark to make that live a spark to make that word ignite and begin to work see but the band says the gasoline represents the word it's the truth but without the spirit it won't move we have put too much stress on the mechanics and nothing on the dynamic yeah it needs the dynamic power of God the resurrection power of Jesus Christ upon the church to manifest and to bring to pass that this is gasoline we can go out and we can tell the world and say well you know we have we have the Bible Well other religions say they have a book right and they'll tell you it's true the muhammadans will tell you the Muslims will tell you all my our book is true the Quran is right it comes directly from God to Muhammad and he wrote it down they say that their Bible is true well how can you prove that this is gasoline right are you with me now yeah how can you prove that this is the truth how can you prove this message is true it's when it works yes when it does what it says it would do we've got to prove that to our generation brother Brandon proved that to his generation but somebody has got to prove it in this generation it's not enough to live on what somebody did 40 years ago but somebody did 50 years ago but somebody's got to prove in spite of difficulty in spite of it somebody's going to live right somebody's going to be Godly somebody's going to be holy somebody's going to have families that love one another somebody's going to have a church are you with me now where the power of God is there where healing is there we're signs and wonders are present somebody's gonna do that this might as well be us how somebody's got to do it somebody's got to prove that this is gasoline somebody's got to prove and that's what they needed they needed to go into the upper room until they could begin to prove God began to manifest through them yes until there was a spark oh my he said it might be in a gasoline can it could still be water but the only proof of it is put this life on it and it'll prove whether it's gasoline or not and again the reverse is also true it's got to be real gasoline yeah yeah right it's got to be the word when you try to put the holy spirit in a denomination you're you get a splutter you ruin your engine by getting it full of carbon but oh I'm so glad there's a ten thousand octane power of the word of God now notice he said there is a 10 000 octane power the word of God and the Holy Ghost to light it up and to resurrect the power of God into a man's life or a woman's life or into a church yes how to resurrect the power of God into a church to shoved that Cadillac down the road Yonder under the dynamic power of the Holy Ghost which came back and was waved over the people of the day of Pentecost making him the same yesterday today and forever you say well how do you know that it's possible how do you know that a church can be under that situation and how do you know that a church can do the works of Jesus Christ and we know it because they did it yes right right we know it because they did it we've seen it done we know what this car can do given the right Spark right we know what it can do go read the book of Acts we know exactly what the word does when it's forgiven the proper spark and it doesn't create a denomination it doesn't create a cult of some kind it doesn't create a bunch of people that can't get along although that's that's in the human part but it does create a church that's full of the Holy Ghost it does create a people that love one another it does create somebody that the world can look at them and say you're Christians yes I may not agree with you but you're a Christian yeah right that's the way we ought to be our message ought to be unimpeachable to the world when it comes to our personal conduct how can we do that a spark yes brother Branham begins to make a the argument that there must be a bride at the end time that has these Dynamics right so he doesn't just leave it in a previous age and say this is the way it was yeah but he's saying this is how it is yes this is the principle of the wave Chief it's saying if it was waived it must be waved back if it come in in Grain form it's got to come in loaf form as we talked about the wave offering in Israel he said there was the first Chief come up from all the prophets which was the Son of God the king of all prophets we know when Jesus came he was the anti-type he was the he was the end result of all the what the prophets had foreshadowed there was David that come and there was there was Joseph and there was Abraham and Isaac and and Jacob and there was all the different prophets that come in Jeremiah and Isaiah and each one of them Ezekiel but they only foreshadowed who he was and they only had a portion of and each one of them failed in in some way some of them spectacularly if I can say get the word out some of them failed spectacularly they they just they seemed like they had it all right David was a man after God's Own Heart and a man after God's Own Heart and then all of a sudden he goes out and does what he did and had a man killed and committed adultery and say how in the world could that possibly happen he was only a type looking forward but there was one that come that did no sin yes yes right there was one that come that that was king of all the prophets that was the son of God yes are you with me now yes there was one who come and was that perfect one and his name is Jesus Christ no other man can fill that place right there was one lamb who was worthy to take the book and open the seals one man who could come for our Redemption yes one man the Son of God the king of all the prophets and every Prophet leading up to that time foreshadowed him but just as there had to be one oh I'm we're about to say something church just as there had to be one son of God who was the Fulfillment of all that had been written about the groom come on there also has to be a bride for the game are you hear me this is a great truth I want you to understand this there has to be a bride yes don't let Satan come and tell you whether it's nobody nobody's doing it right and the message is going downhill no there's got to be a bride somewhere there's got to be a people somewhere because just as there had to be a son there has to be a bride oh my every Prophet foreshadowed him but there has been churches I remember there were prophets there were prophets he's told Moses he said I'll raise him up a prophet like you I told David David said they pierced my hands and my feet there was prophets prophets prophets but finally there came the prophet there was churches churches churches Brides brides churches Brides brides what was it people in every age who come on and had a portion and had a good thing that they had had justification and sanctification and and the holy ghosts and different things that they had but there's got to come one yes there's got to come one who's a real bride there has to come a real bride just like there had to be a real group there has to be a real bride there must come one aren't you glad to be one of them we've got to be part of that one this is the end time this is it this is this is the end of all things there must come one that's not only got the mechanics but the Dynamics of it there's got to be a people that are come that come along that are actually able to put it in motion again and the car run like it should not sputter around on some denominational system but run like it was supposed to love like they're supposed to walk like they're supposed to live like they're supposed to there's got to be coming one I don't care what they do out in the world come on well there will come a maybe a political Revival politics is gone yeah you realize that just a few years ago gay marriage was illegal yeah yeah and just use one example there's many things but just a few years ago gay marriage was illegal and not only this state but in every state in the Union now it's legal and just today they did a test vote in the Senate to write it into the law yeah and enough Republicans voted for it so that they could pass through the Senate and it'll it's going to pass and that's Republicans voted for it we're not going to find Salvation in politics yeah that's not where our help comes from but David said I will lift my eyes to the hills from whence cometh my help my Help Cometh From The Lord the Lord of heavens and earth I'm not going to look at politics for my salvation I'm not going to look at these things but there's coming a bride the word said that there would be a people who would live right no matter what the schools do no matter what the churches do no matter what the what politics does there's got to be somebody who represents God on the earth at the end time there must come one that's not only got the mechanics but the Dynamics of it do you believe that tonight there must come one that makes that shirt but the Dynamics that makes that church live moving the power of his resurrection he said until we come to that place until we find that place what good does it do to polish the hubs what good does it do to give her a facelift or a simonized job how many remember what a simonize is Simon has the wax I had to look it up simonizes wax and it's a certain brand of wax and that'd become a uh what you call it when you wax your car or simonized job what good does it do to give it a facelift what good does it do to sit there and wax it again I've got that I've got a beautiful Ford Expedition got comfortable seats heated and cooled what good does it do me in the shop are you with me now perfect timing for me to preach this sermon you see all those other things are programmed you can have program and we we should we should do things for our young people yeah we should have good music we should have good views we should we should make it comfortable in the house of God we should do everything we can to help people yeah not just ourselves to help people we should help people in the community help people around us we should be nice to people we should treat people right we should do everything we can that we're here we might as well do it yeah we should do everything we can for the community but all of that is programmed yeah yeah all of that is programmed if there's no Dynamics it'll never go down the road right but this church is different this this car is different because it operates like what he said it would operate yeah somebody's got to have the spark yes yes might as well be us yeah yeah she programmed without the spark is dead yeah but the parent said no matter how much the mechanics proved to be right there's got to be a Dynamics to make it work that's what he proved Hallelujah that's what Easter proved he wasn't only the word but he was God himself the Dynamics in the work aren't you glad for that tonight that made the body of Jesus Christ cold stiff and dead in the grave shaken to life and raised again and roll away the stone I am he that was dead so dead to the son said he was dead the moon said he was dead the Stars said he was dead all nature said he was dead and now the whole world has to recognize he's alive again he was not only the mechanics God's word he was the Dynamics to prove it and if he being the groom the bride has to come forth because it's part of him has to come forth oh that ought to give us courage faith right we can be that we can be that I know that's hard when you're sitting at home caring for your children yeah and they're sick I know that's difficult when you struggle through school and work and you drag your kids to church and everybody's mad at each other it's hard to feel like the one so maybe it's somebody else but he didn't call Perfect People the first time all right but he went and he got a tax collector yeah and he got a fisherman yeah yeah and he got a and he got a bunch of uh he didn't send and a bunch of people that didn't know nothing couldn't write their name in boxcar letters a bunch of illiterate ignoramuses is what the Pharisees called them a bunch of people that didn't know anything about letters but they but they would follow him called a bunch of people who had problems a bunch of people who messed up a bunch of people who even denied him but he said I want you to go get the spark so that it'll change you I want you to get a spark so that you can begin to work he said I'll provide you the mechanics and then I'm going to give you the Dynamics on top of it hey man he was the Dynamics to prove the Mechanics Work Hallelujah and is he being the groom the bride has to come forth because it's part of him and it can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all the revelations any others has spoke of the Bride In other words whatever they foreshadowed it can only manifest does something different from the groom it isn't the bride because she is flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life power of his power she is him yes as man and woman are one and a woman taken from his side she's taking a spirit the feminist Spirit from him the flesh from his side made both mechanics and Dynamics the wife yeah the wife yeah yeah not a wife the wife yeah not a church the church are you with me now hey man he said the spirit of him and the Flesh of him put it together made mechanics and Dynamics I'm losing my voice if I gotta get through the rest of this and we'll close look he said until the Church of the people all these Easter Bunny ceremonies big churches the finery will fail and pass away until that church becomes both Dynamics and mechanics and the spirit of God that moved him to do the things that he did if he hit on 16 cylinders so will the bride yeah I love the way brother Branham describes this vehicle yes yes he doesn't describe it as a four-cylinder yeah huh or an eight cylinder that shuts down to six like some of them do or a six cylinder that shuts down to four he doesn't describe it as a gas saver yeah yeah a Hugo are you with me now all right he doesn't describe this church as a Hugo yeah he doesn't describe it as a little Saturn like I got sitting outside he doesn't describe it as little thing that you just have to drop down on the gas pedal you just barely get up to 40 miles an hour he said it's 16 cylinders yes that's a big engine yeah yeah tell you what that engine will make some noise yeah sure will that's right yeah a 16 cylinder engine you ain't gonna get it to be very quiet yeah it's not a gas saver it's got plenty of gasoline but a big tank hey man hey man he said he said he hit on 16 cylinders so will the bride he said in John 14 12 he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also I'll give him a charge of my Dynamics in his mechanics that the world will not be able to withstand it and I'll raise him up again at the last day he said that's the Easter message the Dynamics and the mechanics together he said the mechanics without the Dynamics is no good neither is the Dynamics without the mechanics you can scream and shout and jump up and down all you want to and deny this word it won't do any good yeah you're just cranking around the Pistons you see got the spark there to fire but no gasoline to fire it by e it'll only work as they come together so he said one will sit still yeah and the other one will go up now let me show you this in the scripture before we go can we do that we got time to do that yes I promise I won't hold you much longer Matthew 25. this is a parable of the wise and foolish virgin remember one sit still one goes up right right what's the difference the Dynamics yes yes right Matthew 25 and 1 then show the Kingdom of Heaven be likened unto ten virgins which took their lamps and went for it to meet the bridegroom they all had lamps and five of them were wise and five were foolish now how do we know that they were wise and which ones were wise and which ones were foolish it tells us today that we're foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them we know oil in the scripture is the type of the Holy Spirit they had no charge no spark no oil yeah right you see it's just a different type but it's the same same concept there's no no power so but the wives took oil in their vessels with their lamps so these have lamps wicks they're they're trimmed they're cleaned up they're ready but no oil these have the same lamps the same wicks sing the same songs right hear the same preaching right what's the difference one has oil in their vessel while the bridegroom tarried verse five they all slumbered and slept and at midnight there was a cry mate behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him I believe we've heard that Midnight Cry then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps they all arose and trimmed their lamps and the foolish fed to the wise give us of your oil for our lamps are going out but the wise answered saying not so this is a personal salvation right we can't give you ours you can't get it from your grandmother right you don't get it from the preacher you don't get it you got to get some yourself yes oh you hearing me now you're not born into it you can't just become a part of the church but you've got to have the oil he said go to them that sell and buy for yourselves and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut afterward came also the other virgin saying Lord Lord open to us but he answered and said verily I said to you I know you not watch therefore for you know neither the day nor the hour We're in the son of man cometh listen they both looked alike they both had the same thing they both had the same lamps same style of lamp bought it at the same store sir are you with me now everything looked the same but one had one didn't one could make a fire and the other one couldn't the Brother Bear said they both might look alike both claim to be churches both claim to be bride but one has mechanics and Dynamics brings it to pass of what he said is the truth it just won't move no matter how good the mechanics is until the Dynamics come when the Dynamics come that fire is made to connect with the octane in the gasoline see it's engineered for that and he doesn't leave us with a low octane either he said this is a thousand octane it's a 16 cylinder car running a thousand octane guests you gotta you gotta fire to that but the Harold it's going to do something but he said without that it just won't move he said when that explodes it causes a combustion and that combustion moves every motion every move for he is the same yesterday today and forever right that's the resurrection that's the real power of God mechanics with the Dynamics he said notice it's the spirit that quickens it's the spark that fires it's not the gas that fires it's the spark that fires the gas you can do nothing without me but with me you can do all things as he is the word it's the father living father sent me so send I you as the father has fired me and pushed me into everything I do only that which is pleasing to God now as he sent me so send out you with the same mechanics and it takes the same Dynamics to operate it and these signs shall follow them to claim to have the mechanics the Dynamics will take its place Paul said the gospel came to us not in word only through gasoline only but through spark also to make it move there you are it came to us in that manner for Our Gospel hey that's first Thessalonians 1 5 came down to you in word only also in power and in the Holy Ghost and in much Assurance as you knew what manner of men we were among you for your sake you saw it work you saw it work musicians go ahead and come I'm done I promise you I wouldn't take long look on the mechanics and Dynamics both present they're both here right right a prophet told us that the mechanics are here the word has been revealed the Dynamics are here why do we sputter think about it you ever get to drive in your spiritual car down the road brother Joe and it feels like you're driving a four-cylinder you come to church on Wednesday night and you just I made it oh another service I don't know if I can make it back or not but I'm here tonight preacher preach me happy fill me up with gas you don't have a a problem with being not empty on gaps that's not your problem you ever want to say well I've got the mechanics and the Dynamics I don't understand I'm moving but I'm sputtering I'm moving but I'm my spark plugs are all fouled up you know an engine was made to run at a certain speed if you've got a 16 cylinder engine and you go out there and you you run that engine on idle constantly yeah yeah you know what's going to happen to it some of you know engines better than I do huh what's going to happen to you that's why you don't buy an x a car that used to be a police car or a taxi because it may have low miles but it's been idling for a long time and when you don't put your foot on the gas foreign we've been driving this car like it's a little Pinto first car that I got a hold of was a Ford a Ford a Ford uh tempo Pinto's older than that isn't it I had a gray Ford Tempo that thing would just barely get up and down the mountains just barely move remember I bought that car and come outside the very first morning me and my brother went together to get that car and we got it down the very first one we bought some used tires and put on it and the very first morning we looked outside and all four tires were flat huh but we we thought that thing was but it got us around but it wasn't very good I don't like that my wife will tell you I've been having a hard time with this little car I don't like that I like to be able to go up a hill I like to be able to pass somebody are you with me now you're sputtering he ever found yourself like that I do you're sputtered you're sitting behind it's like you're sitting back on one of these Hills it's two-lane roads and you got in

word you're not driving a denominational vehicle Lord begin showing me this thing and I thought God too many times I sit behind that great a big old trash truck I'm sitting back there crying oh God if

trash truck I'm tired of being depressed constantly and being laid back at home and wondering why I can't get to the house of God put your foot on the gas you're the only one that can do it push down on the gas you've got 16 cylinders you've got a full tank push your foot down on the gas let that car go at some point you're going to have to pass but there's danger in that not in the car you've got you'll make it put your foot on the gas are you with me now sorry I held you over let's bow our heads together if you're idle long enough you're going to get fouled up foreign on something to happen

believing you said I'm a child of yours you said I belong to you you said you would give me the spark now I have the holy ghost in my life you said that we can live it you said that we're gonna make it you said that the world may say differently but I know this car is capable I know this vehicle is capable of taking me all the way through you said it Lord put your foot on the gas tonight wherever

you'd help us understand that tonight to know it Lord give us the spark the Lord that'll let us continue on maybe if some some spark plugs have gotten fouled up some things for the world have gotten in gotten our attention oh God Clean us up tonight or let the Holy Spirit come down and set the Gap just right so the mixture of will be just right so we'll get there just what the word that we need to hear so that we're not caught up in the things of the world oh God help us to be ready and watching we know your coming is very soon I pray you granted tonight we love you thank you for giving us
