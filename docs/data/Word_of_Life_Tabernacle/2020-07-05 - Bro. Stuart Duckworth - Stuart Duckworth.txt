sister corrine allen just takes brother ben this morning said she was she was sick and going to be going going to the doctor tomorrow so just remember her in prayer god would just touch her and also continue to pray for sister jane her friend diane she has stomach cancer and they there's no way to operate or or cure so they start chemo thursday she's not able to hold food or water down so just be in prayer for prayer for that request there that god would just send a special touch her way amen we know that you know sometimes man man men doesn't know the answer but but god does amen we'll just have brother ben come he's just going to take these requests and and maybe just give us just a few announcements but and i guess i forgot we're not taking up offerings so it's in the back so you get up here and you get nervous but here's where the pin thank you brother allen you can be seated for just a moment and thank you for being here this morning um i know that uh for me uh i've been shut up in the house for a while and so to be in the house of god is a great thing just to be able to be here and and uh thank you very much for your prayers we've had a rough time of it over the last couple of weeks but you know whenever you look at your own situation you realize that someone else has worse situation than you do that's always the case and so i am grateful that it wasn't as bad for us as it was for some others um i know of pastors who have been in the hospital there's a couple of pastors that i know in the hospital now from this and so continue to pray for them and we know that god has all things in control and so it wasn't as bad for us as it was for some others you might be able to tell i'm still just a little congested i'm not contagious i haven't been for a while but i will stay away from you just in case and to make you feel better today and you know going through this has been one of the hardest things that i've ever been through and then starting off pastoring the church and doing this but there must be a reason for it and it's going to produce a character in us that hasn't been there before that wouldn't have been there every generation goes through its trials and its troubles and this is our generation this is what we have to deal with and so we're grateful and i am again i'm so thankful for every one of you keep my family and your prayers they're going to be shut up for a while because of the way that it's worked it's going to be a couple more weeks before they're able to leave the house and my kids especially the older ones are about to go crazy so you remember them in in your prayers and and it'll be a little while before they'll be able to be back in church just because of the timeline and things and and uh pray for your church and uh we're thankful to have each one of you here the herrings i think this is probably your last service before you move so we're grateful to have you we we're grateful that we've been able to adjourn with you and hopefully you'll continue to come and and i wish there could be more here this morning i know some are gone some are sick and many are concerned about the situation that we're in but if you're listening this morning just pay attention to the word of god and i believe god will will bless you stand with me if you would and we'll go to um prayer i stand up here i'm going to preach and without any notes that we would be here a while so brother stewart is going to preach this morning and i'm grateful to him for doing that those of you that were here wednesday night brother allen preached and i i understand he did a magnificent job and i'm apologized that we couldn't get the streaming working but uh you'll just have to come back next time brother allen is speaking and and i understand it was just a wonderful sermon and we know that god has all things in his control do you believe that this morning do we really believe that when we get done with this there's not going to be anything left but our reliance on god that's it that's all we're going to be able to rely on we can't rely we've taken all the measures we can take to keep each other safe and in the end it's going to be up to god and that's all we can do and so we're grateful we'll continue to do everything we can to keep you safe but we're grateful that god is still on the throne he's still the same yesterday today and forever all of the preachers that we had coming in have had to cancel either i've had to cancel on them or they've had to cancel on me i apologize for that the lord must have wanted us to hear brother allen by the steward and and uh and do some more things here at the church um we were going to have communion next week we'll push that back at least one more week just to uh make sure that everybody can be here and uh so we'll do that god bless you let's bow our heads together you have a special need you'd like to make known by way of uplifted hand this morning we know that god is here where he

already this morning we certainly love you and and uh and just know that god god is faithful and god is is with us amen amen amen let's let's turn to the scriptures this morning if we can to isaiah 45 if you brought your bibles this morning it seems like it's been a while since i i preached so we'll we just believe that god is faithful amen amen just a little thought that we had on our heart isaiah 45 for thus saith the lord that created the heavens god himself that formed the earth and made it he hath established him he created it not in vain he formed it to be inhabited and i am the lord and there is none else and i have not spoken in secret in a dark place of the earth i said not unto the seat of jacob seek ye me in vain i am the lord i the lord speak righteousness i declare things that are right assemble yourselves and come draw near ye that are escaped of the nations they have no knowledge that set up the wood of their graven image and pray unto a god that cannot save tell ye and bring them near ye let them take counsel together who hath declared this from ancient time who hath told it from that time have not i the lord and there is no god else beside me a just god and a savior and there is none beside me and look unto me and be ye saved all the ends of the earth for i am god and there is none else amen let's just bow our hearts before the lord today just you'd have a need to slip that up to him and we know that he's here he's present he's on the scene we know that he's here with his people his people in in our midst amen lord jesus we come before you today lord and lord we're just a thankful people lord that we can come and gather in your presence lord we can come lord for a few moments lord and worship you lord and lord to come and gather around your word and how it's so anchored in our hearts lord lord and we love just to be in your presence and lord we just ask that you come today in a special way to your people lord just speak to every heart every individual you know their needs or situations just come by our way lord may your presence lord just come and fill this place lord fill every heart every life lord touch every knee we ask lord bless your word as it would go forth and it's blessed to your people's heart we ask in jesus name we pray amen amen can you say praise the lord this morning amen amen he's saying here he's saying look unto me amen the creator the creator of heaven and earth he's saying he says that he formed the earth to be inhabited amen he didn't form it just for for no reason but for a purpose that that it would be inhabited amen amen and this earth is actually what's meant to be our dominion amen and not only this this earth that we walk upon but this earth this body that that we walk in amen that god has redeemed that he paid a price for amen that we could live in this life amen under under under the word amen living living in the word for our day in our lives amen aligning with the word amen and having dominion over the things of this life amen to be subject to god's word he formed he formed us to be inhabited by his presence amen in him alone is salvation in him alone is redemption amen in him is to be a healer amen to be our god and we we know today that he is our father and he wants to express amen to his attributes to his family who he is this morning amen that he's a savior that he's a redeemer that he can bring you out from any situation amen no matter how far you would fall and he can bring you out because that that is an expression of who he is that that's who god is to you and i amen and he wants he wants to be our healer he wants he wants to be your god he wants to express himself as that but he's saying look he's saying to us in the word here he's saying look there there's none else beside me i am god alone amen this morning he's the true and living god leading his people amen healing his people amen amen bringing us through amen he's the god that has spoken amen and revealed himself to us in these last days amen aren't you thankful for that and that god came by your way one day and revealed himself to you and i'm thankful for that i'm thankful for a prophet in the end time that that pointed us to christ i mean he didn't he didn't point us to a denomination or some system but he he pointed us back to the word away from these systems amen that will have an end he would preach to us sermons uh towering them looking unto jesus look away to jesus amen and a true prophet will never point the people to himself but he'll point them to the word he'll point them to christ amen and he says in here looking unto jesus he says that's been the call for years look unto me ye ends of the earth he said i would like to kind of turn that just a little bit look especially unto me at the end of each world system listen to this because he always makes himself known so real at the end of the world system when it's coming to its end he said look unto me all yins i might say the scripture the ends the ends of the earth amen so at the end at the end of the system at the end and there's been many ends of different civilizations in different times throughout history and god always comes and makes himself known and he's making himself known amen because we know we're at the end of the end of the end and as brother adam said he he always comes down at the end and makes himself known and so real that the people will be without without anything they'll have no excuse amen and i believe this morning i believe he's still making himself known to his people amen i believe he's a faithful god this morning do you believe that i believe he's still making himself known still revealing himself amen still showing more of himself revealing and manifesting himself to those who have recognized their day and its message that he's saying look look to me amen look away from this world look away from these systems and look unto me because i'm god and there is none beside me amen if you look at the world and the condition that we see you know you know no doubt some of the elders here have seen strange times but i bet if we got together and started asking them one by one have you ever seen anything quiet like we're going through now and i bet most of them would say this is a different time it's not just one thing that we're dealing with or two things or three things but it's multiple multiple things that are coming upon the earth amen and we know that when when the daylight is breaking it right before the break of daylight it gets dark that's the most darkest time that there is right before the breaking of the day amen that that's the that's the dismal time that we live in amen but he said in the evening time there shall be light there shall be light among my people there will be gross darkness but among you there will be light amen it's a dismal day it's a dark day it's a time when all kinds of things are coming upon the earth amen but god is faithful this morning amen and he's saying look unto me he's saying this morning i am god i am the god that heals all thy diseases amen i'm your deliverer i'm your redeemer amen just had this thought that you know what's coming true that this world can't sustain itself anymore and it's got to come to that point and we know that this earth that we're walking upon is as he said in the scripture it must be inhabited god created it to be inhabited but this condition that it's in is becoming unfit more unfit amen and god we know that god will send a fire god will send a holy fire amen and cleanse this earth that he and his people can walk walk upon this earth with no sin no sickness no disease amen that's where we're coming to it's got to come to that spot amen to where god actually does that we see it more and more we know we know we understand where we're at we know that america brother branham said to turn down the gospel it's beyond redemption and i believe while we're here we should always continually try to stand for what's right we should try to try to lean more amen to what's right and try to try to have a at least a decent place to live while we're here but we know that it's beyond redemption we know that america has turned down god and if it wasn't for you and i still being here this place would be destroyed we know that politics are rotten we know that there's no hope in that we know that there's no there's no hope in that it's rotten to the core and it's over with aren't you thankful amen this morning that you've heard god's voice that your hope is not in a god that cannot save that it's not in politics it's not in in some civilization or some some superpower somewhere amen that's a god that cannot say this morning amen but i believe we're a people that have heard his voice amen we've recognized his voice and we've taken heed amen he's declaring he's declaring continually come out of her my people come out of this system this system that will have an end amen god's voice in this day i believe has shook the earth he said in there as we read it earlier i the lord speak righteousness i declare the things that are right amen as the truth goes forth amen amen as the truth goes forth amen if you'll accept that it's mercy to you but brethren say if you reject it that becomes judgment amen to us it's mercy but to them it becomes judgment the thing that saved noah was the very thing that destroyed the world in his day is that right we understand these things to be able to accept the truth to be able to to be able to believe it and hold on to it as mercy for you and i do you believe that this morning jesus said let every man's word be allowed mind be the truth and it's coming to that amen we've got to stand on the word of god we've got to stand on what we believe is truth amen and unwaver from that stay there and stand there and take your stand amen in this in this life amen amen his word is our true reality in the midst of chaos so in the midst of chaos in the midst of what you can see or what you can hear amen amen lying vanities to you and i amen because we have a different reality we have a truth we have something that set us free amen something that's that's freed us from this world amen amen has become a reality to us apart from these other things though we're walking in the midst of it though we're in the midst of chaos you and i this morning we have a different reality we have the reality of god's word of his promised word amen amen as we've said it before and as the scripture says his word is spirit and in his life amen it's what holds us in this age amen it's what holds us it's more than life to us and we can say that that our hopes aren't in politics in the in this nation but my hope this morning is in jesus amen my hope is in the return and the coming of the lord jesus amen the kingdoms of this world will be shaken amen the earth is being shaken as the scripture says the earth is being shaken and the heavens also and that which is not founded upon christ amen upon christ the word will crumble it will fall it will have an end it will be no more anything that has a beginning has an end do you believe that but you and i this morning you and i this morning amen we've recognized something different amen amen we've recognized amen we founded ourselves upon something different amen we've received that eternal life amen in our nature is no more of the world amen our our soul and the nature of it was to sin and to do the things of the world amen amen but when god came in and man he didn't he didn't change who you were amen he didn't he didn't kill your spirit or kill kill your body off but he changed that nature that old nature died with inside you amen the nature of the world and you took on god's nature and when you receive that eternal life well i can tell i haven't preached in a while because i got zero voice right now that's not a good feeling when you're about five minutes in you love the lord this morning amen i have to get my voice conditioned back or speak a little different amen anything that had a beginning will have an end amen so when you receive that eternal life amen it's because you were an eternal creature before you didn't just one day become an eternal creature but because you were you were part of god you could receive that eternal life we understand that the brotherhood said it like this you you can no more die than god can die is that right in the book of hebrews and just continue with that thought that this world amen and everything is going to be shaken and it says for a year not coming to the mount that might be touched and that with with that burn with fire nor unto the blackness and darkness and tempest so so moses he came under this mountain and then he came into this this mountain that that he you might not be touched and burned with fire and darkness and it said and he exceedingly feared and quaked but i say this morning that we have not come amen we have not come to a place of fear amen but as the scripture says you have come to mount zion under the city of the living god the heavenly jerusalem amen this morning to an innumerable company of angels we've come we've come not to a place of fear but we've come to a place of identification amen to the living god amen there's an innumerable company of angels we've not come to fear this morning this morning we've come to the portion of the word for our day amen not a place of uncertainty amen amen we've heard a trumpet and that trumpet did not give an uncertain sound amen but it was a sound that came from the scripture amen and we know who we are this morning we've recognized who we are in the word founded this morning upon thus saith the lord amen recognizing what we've come to amen not a place not a place of fear amen but recognizing that we are the rapture that we are the last and final group amen the last and final overcomer am in the final voice to the final age but those things that that can't be shaken they shall remain if you can be shaken you will have an end and that's how steady we must be anchored amen when the shaking time comes we shall remain it goes on in hebrews wherefore we're receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have grace whereby we may serve god acceptably with reverence and godly fear amen do you love the lord this morning revelation 10 the bible declares that time should be no more and we can see the world can see what we're coming to they can feel it but they don't under actually understand how close we are they don't really truly understand what lays ahead but you and i this morning we have an understanding we can look into the word we can look into the message and then we can have an understanding and we can prepare ourselves and we can make ourselves ready because god has given you an understanding he's gave you you mercy he's gave you his word that we can prepare our lives for what lays ahead that we can escape the judgments and i'll say this morning as the scripture says the lord is not slack concerning his promise amen we are living in the very long suffering of god and then he's allowing things to go on he's allowing it to go further because he had a desire that none would be lost god god desired that no man would be lost he wants people to come in he wants people to be saved he wants people to be filled with the holy ghost and i say great is it salvation today amen has not diminished he's saying look look unto me there is none other i am god and there is none other beside me i alone amen in me alone is salvation in the seventh seal and i'll just read some of this everything runs out in time the end of time at the end of the seventh seal notice it's the end of the church ages the end of the seventh seal it's the end of the trumpets it's the end of the vials and even even in the ushering in of the millennium that's on the seventh seal it's just like a firing rocket into the air and and that rocket explodes here and it goes up and then it explodes again and it puts out five stars and one of those stars explode and it blows out five stars from it and then one of them stars explodes and it blows out five star stars from it and it fades on out and he said that's the seventh seal it just ends the time for the world it ends the time for this it ends the time for that it ends the time for this it's the it ends the time everything just ended up on that seventh seal and christ the mystery of god reveal god's great mystery of how it's a secret he kept it secret nobody knows nothing about it even the angels didn't understand it seemed he didn't reveal it that's the reason under our seventh mystery when the seventh seal was opened there was silence jesus when he was on earth they wanted to know when he would come he said not even the son himself don't even know when it's going to happen see god has us all to himself it's a secret and that's the reason there was silence in heaven for the space of half an hour and seven thunders under their voices and and john was even forbidden to ride and see the coming of the lord and that's one thing he hasn't revealed yet of how he will come and when he will come it's a good thing that he does him but he says he's re he showed it or revealed it in every top that's in the bible therefore the entire bible is the revelation of god's mystery in christ so we see the seventh seal this is coming it's the coming of the lord and it goes on that no man knows the day nor the hour we know that he comes as a thief unto that to in the night and then he comes to those that are looking for him and then jesus asked the question will i find faith when i return will i will i find those that have stayed true to my word true to me amen i mean he's not going to be able to show us the exact day because if we knew the exact day we'd put it off because that's the human thing amen by this bride amen stays ready she has made herself ready amen we're living in the season of fulfillment amen and you've heard these things before but the day amen we're living in the day when the very back part of god's mind has been shown his very purpose through the ages and what god has been trying to accomplish amen you have an understanding amen god's mercy has been extended to you we understand that the sixth seal is tribulation and we clearly see we clearly see how that is coming upon the earth we see the signs we see the effects of it being shown we see the people getting in the spirit of destruction and then you see it even even more evidently and brother ram said it come to a place it was total insanity the people would lose their minds i mean they don't they don't understand what's wrong they don't understand what's right they can't discern between right and wrong and that's the faculty that's the mental faculty of the people that you and i live in they have no understanding oh be thankful this morning if i can make that clear to you be thankful this morning amen that you have an understanding of the hour that we live in amen that you've you've accepted god's mercy and you're preparing yourself you're making yourself ready we know that the seventh seal is the coming of the lord we also see the effects of it amen we see the effects of the opening of the word in our day how it's affected our lives amen how we walk differently than the world and the religious world amen we know amen we understand amen we see the time that we live in amen amen well we know that he was solid in that seventh seal and i'm no teacher i don't even know why i'm getting into this i know very little there's brothers that know way more than me i know nothing but these are just things that i had that were in front of me we know that the coming of the lord we know that the father only knows the day and the hour is that right and we know that brother said it's been revealed in every type through through lives and people through the scripture he revealed his coming he revealed amen amen they that he was going to come again amen he's revealed it in every top in the scripture amen and he's revealing it in you and me he's revealing his coming in you and me amen we're the final voice to the final age amen he's making himself known here to his people amen he's making himself known amen by saving us from our sins amen amen sanctifying our lives and then performing his word and you and i amen filling us with the holy ghost amen bringing us to a spot amen amen in his grace in you and i it's mercy and you and i and man bringing us to a spot sealing us with the holy ghost and then sealing the devil out and sealing himself in and then we see manifesting himself among his people appearing among us amen no though we all always don't always feel his presence amen but amen but we got to walk by faith amen jesus didn't say did you feel it but did you believe it amen he said will i find faith when i return not not will i find an emotional people that that just thrive on emotion but will i find faith will i find a people that are anchored amen that are steady amen amen but he comes by amen among us appearing among us amen with his presence amen and when he comes by it doesn't happen every service amen you don't feel it every service amen but he kind of lets you know every now and then and when he appears among you you feel his presence sweep in and then the preacher comes and preaches something and it speaks to your heart and man he's appearing to you and then he's showing you that he's here and then he comes and discerns your thoughts and your intents and when the preacher didn't know nothing about it the deacon didn't know nothing about it mama didn't know nothing about it amen but god spoke to those people he came and discerned your your thoughts letting you know that he cares about you amen he came and he called out your sin and then he cut he didn't let you continue on and you're wrong can you say amen this morning god won't let us get by with nothing hey man he'll call call you out amen because you're his child he cares that much about you then he'll chastise you amen because we're his children we're his family is that right amen he's appearing among us the signs of his presence amen manifesting his word amen not just an emotion but we see his word among us amen amen this morning amen the bride had made herself ready amen we're a people praying praying watching waiting we see the hour we understand the hour amen we're living in the final age and the grandest of all ages and then it's the ending of time and the blending in of eternity amen blending in amen time ending in eternity blending in amen we know that we also live in the most sinful age the powers of satan many times harder to fight against than it was in any other age it's the most deceiving age that there ever was that's the question this morning are you blending in with this world what are you blending in with or are you more wrapped up in this world and and letting the cares of god the the cares of this life rather take it out of you or are you becoming one with god's word for this hour and blending in with the place we're going you're going one place or the other you're not halfway or in between amen you're either becoming one with the word or you're taking on the judgments of this world brother branham says here he said people say look if they mention the word look means to pay attention to look up or to look at look out and god is saying here look unto me i am god and there is none other and he goes on and says i wonder in a time that we are living in now what could we look at that would be more solid than god and god is the word so look to the word of god today for your answer the bible has the answer for this day it has had it for other days it's got it forever because it's christ the same yesterday today and forever you say what does god want me to do what what do i need to do amen what's the will for my life well god's word is his will that's his perfect will amen if you want to know what to do if you don't know what to do look into his word amen god's got something there for you amen just specifically for you as an individual amen god's got a perfect plan he's got a perfect will for you and i and that's his word amen that's his will amen that's our absolute this morning it's perfect within itself amen it's unlimited in its power amen the absolute the word of god it's it's it's the amen it's the everything and he this morning is the king of kings and the lord of lords amen he is our everything working up a decent sweat that humidity you don't stay outside in arkansas it comes in the buildings too that's just how it works here amen he's our absolute amen there's something that's holding you and i amen something greater than ourselves something greater than our own understanding but it's christ in you amen he's the lighthouse that gives us direction amen through the storm amen through the storms of life he he's with us amen he's the he's with us in the boat he's the lighthouse he's whatever we need him to be i mean he's the calm in the storm amen and if the storm don't ever come he'll bring you to the other side he's whatever he he's whatever we need him to be he's our god amen amen i want to be identified among those amen who trusted god in their day amen i want to be identified with those that amen through the storms amen through the fire amen through the sickness through the trials of life amen that are going to come they're inevitable they're going to come and you're going to go through these things amen but i want to be identified amen with the people that stood true with god amen the trusted god that depended on god to bring them hebrews says we're compassed about with a great cloud of witnesses there's many that's going on before us and they're cheering you and i on and they're cheering you and i on that we can make it and that you can make it that you can make it through the other side if you'll if you'll put your trust in him if you'll put your confidence in him he'll bring you through amen lay aside every weight everything that's holding you back anything that you hold dear lay that aside this morning lay it aside amen it don't mean that much when it's all said and done it's not going to mean nothing this world's not going to mean nothing anything that you can accomplish it ain't going to mean nothing amen lay it aside today amen and run the race with patience amen look to jesus look to me he said look to him this morning amen the author and the finisher of your faith look to him this morning amen who is the beginning and the end look to him this morning amen this began a good work in you amen and he will perform it amen until the day of jesus christ and then he's taking it upon himself the one that started it we'll finish it amen i want to be identified as we said i want to be identified this morning amen i don't want to be of those that draw back but i want to go forward i want to march forward amen if there's anything waiting me down let me drop it off if there's anything in my life god call it out amen i want to march forward i want to i want to run this race amen because there's nobody else amen we're the final voice to the final age one time the king of assyria he was upset because when he would try to plan an attack amen it would always get messed up before he could carry out his attack it meant elisha the prophet would tell the king of israel his plans and the king of assyria thought is there a spy in the camp who who would do this amen to to you and i who who among us would would tell our secrets and one spoke up and said he was then told of the of the prophet elijah and how he could even hear what was spoken in the bed chamber so the king of assyria spent sent spies out to search where elisha was in second kings 6 and 14 therefore sin he hit there are horses and chariots and a great host and they came by not and compassed the city about and when the servant of the man of god was risen early and gone forth beholden hosts can pass the city both with horses and chariots and his servant said unto him at last my master how shall we do and he answered fear not for they that be with us are more or more than they that be with him and elisha prayed and said lord i pray thee open his eyes that he may see and the lord opened the eyes of the young man and he saw and behold the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about elisha amen amen we could echo that this morning amen there's more with us than against us amen and brother branham says there's sometimes there is things happening around us that we cannot understand others are saying they can't they they see things and others see nothing about it but it depends on what you're looking at it depends on if you're understanding i mean if you're if your spiritual vision has been open or if you're just looking at the natural things around you looking at the chaos looking at the situation look at how bad it could be but if your eyes could be open you would see that god's with you you see that there's an innumerable company of angels with you and that god is watching over you keeping you safe working everything for your good amen he's a supernatural god he's beyond this human element amen that we sometimes so depend on amen god is beyond that amen our supernatural the supernatural god that we serve is beyond that amen he's a waymaker this morning i mean it's a miracle working god amen working his will in you and i working all things for our good amen making a way when there is no way brother branham says here you see elisha when he rose up he looked he saw something that hazel didn't see and so he prayed god opened this young man's eyes and now his eyes were wide open he said but he said open his eyes that he might see and when his eyes when his eyes spiritually came open the whole mountain was full of chariots fire and angels and all all around the prophecy it was different when his eyes came open and he said now people look at the word literally he said and that's the way you're supposed to look at it but it declares itself both literally and spiritually and the spirit makes the word live the promise amen your own understanding your own vision will only take you so far amen but it takes the mind of christ it takes something supernatural amen for us to be able to to really have faith amen to be able to understand and know what is around us amen you love the lord this morning that's the question what do you what do you see today what do you see this morning do you see us as a defeated people amen do you see our god as a god of history amen if that's what you're looking for if that's what your expectation is that's what you're going to see and what what you're looking for amen what what you see is is what your expectation is amen what what you seek god to be what you know god to be that ought to be our expectation amen that this morning god's my healer and that this morning there's no disease there's no sickness too greater from through great for my god amen it depends on what you're looking at is he some god of history is he a god of of just william branham's day or is he still god today you understand amen and we can look back at those things and and draw faith and and see what god what god was doing amen amen when brother branham left the scene god didn't leave his people he's still here with us in the midst of his people amen brother brennan would say in a message who is god he said the jehovah of the old testament is the jesus of the new the holy spirit in this day standing here to make good on any promise that he has made amen amen we can see the god that stood with his people in the old testament amen we can see the god that walked in the days of calvary in the days of jesus we can see that god amen but he came to you and i in this day amen he came to you and i amen and you come and discern the thoughts and intents of the heart and then he came and gave us a sign that he was here is that right and then he identified himself among his church in such a way amen like he had never done before amen and he's here this morning amen if you'll let him amen if you'll let him if your expectation will come to a place he'll come down from glory he'll come down in your situation and reveal himself to you amen amen just continue that thought you know he says look look unto me amen amen and as brother john says it says pay attention amen look look up look beyond amen the things that are going on around you look up unto me and jesus speaking to us here in luke 21 and he said and there shall be signs in the sun and in the moon and in the stars and upon the earth distress of nations with perplexity the sea and the waves roaring men's hearts failing them for fear and for the look after those things which are coming on the earth for the powers of heaven shall be shaken and then shall they see the son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory and when these things begin to come to pass then look up and lift up your heads for your redemption and draw nigh so we'll see signs we'll see things any he identifies the distress there would be distress and then there'd be there'd be sorrow there'd be pain and then people would be living under anxiety amen they don't know how to handle amen what's going on around them they don't have anything else greater than themselves amen so they they come they become under distress they they become under anxiety it's a time of perplexity and that word means the inability to deal with or understand something complicated or something unable to be explained i mean they don't have an understanding of what's taking place they don't know how to deal with it amen thank god for the holy ghost this morning thank god for the holy ghost that keeps you and i amen amen and we don't have to live under anxiety we don't have to live under fear amen amen we're told amen to look to look up lift up lift up your heads for your redemption strong now amen this morning let's look away to jesus and then here is wallace look unto him because the time of redemption is near amen the time of full redemption is here amen he's going to come down and deliver his people from an unfit and corrupted sinful world amen he's going to come down in the time of redemption and change these old bodies and give us a body like his own glorious body that's a time we've all longed for he's saying look up look to me look up amen for you the day of redemption is near amen do you love the lord this morning i got a few more pages here amen to us this morning his word is life amen it's what we it's what we live upon it's what we draw it's our source this morning amen and we're under expectation to see him amen you think of the coming of the lord and how great of a time that is but it's a dreadful time for the unbeliever in the the world living under condemnation living under the guilt of sin the church world living under the deception of the day eminent sublime leading in the blind and in confusion it's babylon but you and i have been called out of that amen amen and amen in the word has brought an understanding to you and i amen so they're living in perplexity they're living in distress because they don't have an understanding of what's coming upon the earth and they're living in fear of the unknown and brother brahm says here an invisible union of the bride of christ he said well look the whole world proves it's insane look at the murders and the things that's going on now in the world see insanity it says the whole thing is coming to fulfill revelations maybe we might get into this so we were those hideous things then is not natural the spiritual things that make people scream for the rocks and the mountains and everything to fall on them he said the complete total insanity this world will go into right away he said it's almost there now why you see it at the footsteps there it is that's marching right out on the street right down the church pew total insanity do things that a human being wouldn't think of doing and being civilized so it was spoke even in that day decades ago that the insanity was coming upon the earth and then you see it right before you today you see the people living in fear you see them the violence that's upon the earth amen and if it wasn't for the holy ghost and the revelation of the hour we'd be we'd be in that very condition amen but thank god this morning that you're sealed amen by the holy ghost amen the holy ghost keeping you amen until the day of redemption amen amen holding forth amen the light holding forth the word of god amen being a bride and shining light in the time of darkness amen in a dismal time emmitt in a time of anxiety walking in the light having an understanding knowing where you are knowing who you are amen what an opportunity to shine in this day don't don't back off what you believe amen because when the time gets darker the darker gets amen the brighter that light shines the brighter those stars shine aren't you thankful this morning that you have a place of refuge aren't you thankful that you have a place you can go that you can let off the pressure amen you can come amen we can come into christ and then we can come and and not try to figure it out for ourselves but we can come to him amen and let off the pressure amen we can come to him and for whatever we have need of i'll try to try to hurry this up here a second timothy 1 for god has not given us a spirit of fear but a power in love and a sound mind amen fear has no hold on you and i this morning amen if there's something bothering you amen amen come to that place of refuge this morning amen if there's a fear of being lost you don't have to live that way there's a fear that god doesn't love me you don't have to live under that if there's a fear that you're gonna miss the rapture amen god will come and give you an assurance this morning i can think back when i when i got saved when i first come to god and and thinking of before i had him that i i i was scared that i would die lost and we've all we all can probably remember that remember being in that condition that you needed god that that you needed someone to save you but i can remember amen after i got saved and dedicated my life to god god filled my life amen the fear of death and then the fear of dying was no longer there the fear of where you're going to go and where you'll end up amen it leaves you because you know where you're going and then you know who your faith and your trust is amen amen nobody wants to die nobody wants to go amen but you've got a faith and a confidence that god will bring you amen bring you across the river amen and that's what that's what god does for his people amen amen he he brings us from these fears amen the fears of life and the fears that we're not going to make it amen amen it gives us a faith in our faith this morning it recognizes that that he is god and there's none else beside him amen that he's faithful and true amen do you love the lord this morning amen we recognize that he's in the midst of the church amen we can hear him speaking amen i am he that liveth and what's dead but behold i am alive forevermore in the church age book it says here don't fear john don't fear little flock all that i

yours to use you speak the word and i'll perform it and that is my covenant and it can never fail what assurance that is amen that a god before us who can be against us and no weapon formed against
