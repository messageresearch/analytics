[41:37] brethren though a man say he hath faith
[41:41] and have not works can Faith save him if
[41:45] a brother or sister be naked and
[41:48] destitute of daily food and one of you
[41:50] say unto them depart in peace be ye
[41:53] warmed and filled not withstanding you
[41:56] give them not those things which are
[41:57] needful to the body what do it profit
[42:00] even so faith if it hath not works is
[42:03] dead being alone yeah a man may say thou
[42:06] Hast faith and I have Works show me my
[42:09] show me thy faith without thy works and
[42:11] I will show thee my faith by my works
[42:15] and thou believest that there is one God
[42:17] and thou doest well the Devils also
[42:19] believe and tremble but wilt thou know a
[42:23] vain man that hath faith without works
[42:26] is dead and he continues on there we'll
[42:29] go down to F uh verse uh number 24 ye
[42:33] see then how that by works a man is
[42:36] Justified and not by faith only likewise
[42:39] also was not Rahab the Harlot justified
[42:41] by works and when she had received the
[42:44] messengers and had sent them out another
[42:46] way for as the body without the spirit
[42:49] is dead so faith without works is dead
[42:53] Also may the Lord add His blessings to
[42:55] the word you may be seated
[42:57] and if I could take for a thought
[42:59] tonight faith without works is dead and
[43:03] I would say you're pretty familiar with
[43:04] that scripture I know we've all we've
[43:06] all read it and I know also there in the
[43:08] book of James uh he talks about he talks
[43:11] about you could be hearers there's
[43:12] hearers not to be hearers of the word
[43:14] only but doers also y'all okay so far
[43:17] amen you're still there all right I know
[43:19] you've ate a lot and the dessert was
[43:20] good but give me 45 minutes and I'll
[43:22] quit and he said but but you know James
[43:25] tells us there that in the book there he
[43:27] says that uh he says you know you can't
[43:30] be hearers only that doesn't mean you
[43:31] shouldn't ever hear the message that
[43:32] doesn't mean you shouldn't ever read
[43:34] your Bibles but if that's all you do and
[43:36] you don't apply it or have a Works to
[43:38] follow that then uh it that doesn't do
[43:40] any good I mean why do you go to church
[43:42] to become a better Christian amen it
[43:44] doesn't do you any good to go if you're
[43:45] not going to apply what you learn at
[43:47] church to your daily life or amen apply
[43:50] what you read in the Bible to your daily
[43:52] life I mean there's got to be something
[43:54] to follow the faith that you claim to
[43:56] have and it's more than just saying I
[43:58] have faith or saying I believe the
[43:59] message or saying all the right things
[44:02] but you've got to have an action to
[44:04] follow up the faith can you say amen and
[44:07] so brother Brandon would say it like
[44:08] this he said there's one thing to teach
[44:10] something there's another thing for God
[44:12] to confirm it and say it's the truth
[44:15] there's one thing to say something it's
[44:16] another thing to do something it's not
[44:18] hearers it's doers and he quotes what we
[44:21] just read he said show me your faith
[44:23] without your works and I'll show you my
[44:24] faith by my Works he said if you believe
[44:26] it you'll act upon it that's it and then
[44:29] your faith becomes Works he said now
[44:32] notice he said I'll show you my faith by
[44:35] my works now now Abraham we know was the
[44:38] father of Faith Can you say amen I wish
[44:41] y'all would get with me just a little
[44:42] bit better y'all look like you're in a
[44:43] food coma tonight I wonder why amen but
[44:45] let me go ahead and tell you something
[44:47] without faith it is impossible to please
[44:49] God so you've got to have faith Works
[44:52] does not uh works works alone does not
[44:54] produce Faith but faith will produce
[44:56] works and then you can show your faith
[44:59] by your Works can you say amen and so
[45:02] Abraham remember he already had the
[45:04] faith when Isaac when the promise of
[45:06] Isaac was to come amen the the promise
[45:09] was there and the faith was there but
[45:11] then there had to be a work he had to
[45:13] hold on to the promise that was
[45:14] something that he had to do so it wasn't
[45:16] good enough for Abraham to say well am
[45:19] mean God's going to send us his son but
[45:20] we don't have to prepare for the sun no
[45:23] he had faith enough to put his faith
[45:25] into action and prepare PR for the son
[45:27] that was to come can you say amen amen
[45:30] so we're not looking we're not looking
[45:32] at the message and saying well the
[45:33] message is going to get me out of here
[45:34] in a Rapture no you need to live the
[45:36] message or the message ain't going to
[45:37] get you out of here right is that right
[45:40] amen so we say well the message is is
[45:42] powerful enough and and God loves me so
[45:44] I don't have to put any Works behind it
[45:46] amen if you love God you'll do what his
[45:48] word said I know we fall down I know we
[45:50] make mistakes and I know many times the
[45:53] flesh is getting in the way of us
[45:54] serving God like we should amen but if
[45:56] we're really sold out to the message of
[45:58] the hour and we're really sold out to
[46:00] being a Christian then our works will
[46:02] show what our faith is on the inside is
[46:05] that all right so far amen so faith is
[46:08] what God sees works is what your
[46:10] neighbor
[46:11] sees faith God knows if you have faith
[46:13] or not God knew if you had faith and
[46:15] amen he but he sent you a promise
[46:17] because he knew you would believe it he
[46:18] knew you would have the faith for it
[46:20] amen he didn't send just anybody a
[46:22] promised son but he sent Abraham a
[46:24] promised son amen but he knew that he
[46:26] would get an action and believe that
[46:28] what God had promised he was able to do
[46:31] also can you say amen and so tonight
[46:33] what we say is is is be it unto me
[46:36] according to Thy word amen I'm going to
[46:38] put your faith Lord the faith that he's
[46:40] put inside of me I'm going to put that
[46:42] faith in action how about you tonight
[46:44] amen he's given us the message of the
[46:46] hour amen he's given us the word of God
[46:48] it's time that we put it into action in
[46:50] our daily lives is that all right amen
[46:53] so in in order to you say well I have
[46:55] faith to move mountains and if you do
[46:57] that's fine but until you take the
[46:58] action of speaking to the mountain then
[47:01] you didn't show you had the faith right
[47:03] amen if there's something in your way
[47:04] that needs to be spoken to amen the
[47:06] faith on the inside of you will take an
[47:09] action to speak to that thing that's in
[47:11] your way do you believe that tonight
[47:13] amen so brother uh brother Brandon would
[47:14] say it like this in the story of Abraham
[47:17] being the father of Faith he said I'm
[47:18] going to call the seed from Isaac and he
[47:19] said I want you to take Isaac out there
[47:21] and kill him the only hope that he had
[47:23] was in Isaac and so he said you just
[47:25] imagine Abraham taken his his promise if
[47:28] you will up to the mountain to be killed
[47:30] amen and and and he knew that that was a
[47:32] miracle from God he knew that was a
[47:34] promise from God and he knew that God
[47:36] was able to also spare his life when he
[47:38] got up to the mountain amen can you say
[47:40] Amen today amen so God I'm turning to
[47:43] steart up here already I've said amen
[47:45] more than I've said anything else but
[47:46] amen what we what we've got to remember
[47:48] tonight is if God made the promise God
[47:50] is more than able to keep the
[47:53] promise and so what we have to remember
[47:56] in the scriptures is God he didn't give
[47:58] just everybody the promise he didn't
[48:00] just give everybody the gift of faith
[48:02] but when he gave them the faith he
[48:03] expected them to step out on the
[48:05] impossible and make it a reality amen I
[48:08] believe today that God has given Faith
[48:10] to you because you know how to use your
[48:13] faith amen it might just be a little bit
[48:15] of Faith but I believe a prophet said
[48:16] one time he said you've got more faith
[48:18] than you realize you've got amen you've
[48:20] got more faith than what you realize you
[48:22] even needed amen but when the devil puts
[48:25] something in your life to where you need
[48:26] faith you'll realize that on the inside
[48:28] of you is something that will raise up
[48:31] and it's something you may not even
[48:32] known that you had am me it'll raise up
[48:34] and say it'll say you know what just
[48:36] like my father Abraham just like he
[48:39] spoke his son just like he prepared for
[48:41] a baby that he knew he couldn't have
[48:43] amen but he spoke possible The
[48:46] Impossible and so I believe tonight we
[48:48] need to speak our faith and speak the
[48:50] promises over our lives and and be
[48:52] positive amen I believe we should never
[48:54] have a negative testimony but speak
[48:57] positive over your church speak positive
[48:59] over your family speak positive over
[49:01] that situation that's all around you
[49:03] listen Church the devil is always full
[49:05] of negativity and he wants to ruin your
[49:07] life with depression and anxiety and
[49:09] everything that'll come against you but
[49:11] we serve a god of the impossible we
[49:13] serve a God who is more than able and I
[49:16] say tonight we need to take a hold of
[49:18] the word of God and let our faith be
[49:20] shown tonight by the action we take I
[49:22] believe coming to church is an action of
[49:25] faith if if you believe in the word of
[49:28] God and the and when he says you know we
[49:30] should we should not forsake the
[49:31] assembling of ourselves together we
[49:33] believe that there it's there for a
[49:35] purpose and so we put our faith in
[49:36] action and we show up at church amen so
[49:40] it's an action it may not be something
[49:41] we always uh enjoy it may not be
[49:44] something that's easy to do but it's an
[49:45] action of Faith that's right you come
[49:47] out here where there's a hundred other
[49:49] people with germs and things like that
[49:51] and you know you're you're just in this
[49:53] you're in this tube full of people and
[49:55] they breathe on you and they Shake Your
[49:56] Hand and and they look at you funny
[49:58] sometimes but you're here and you're
[50:00] you're putting your faith in
[50:01] action is that all right tonight so
[50:04] everything we do amen if it's according
[50:07] to the word is an action of faith when
[50:10] you're baptized it's an action of your
[50:12] faith amen when you receive the Holy
[50:14] Ghost it's an action that you believed
[50:16] and it's an action of Faith so faith
[50:18] without works is dead if you say you
[50:20] have faith and there's no Works to
[50:22] follow the faith then it is dead can I
[50:25] get an amen here tonight somewhere amen
[50:27] I believe that what we need to realize
[50:29] is we need to act on what we say We
[50:32] Believe come on you say I believe the
[50:34] message let's act on the message can we
[50:36] do that anden I believe the Bible let's
[50:37] act on the listen church we need our
[50:39] faith to become an action not just
[50:42] something we say we have but something
[50:44] that we can show the world that I really
[50:46] believe this message I would die for
[50:48] this message amen I'm going to go to
[50:50] church when I don't feel like going amen
[50:52] I'm going to show up and show the devil
[50:54] whose side I'm on why because we have
[50:56] faith that God is going to meet us right
[50:59] here in the house of God Amen if we do
[51:01] that we realize that it's not just our
[51:03] works that save us amen but it is the
[51:05] faith that is saving us but our works
[51:07] are showing that the faith is really
[51:10] there is that okay amen so Abraham went
[51:13] on a three days journey and he went into
[51:14] the mountain and remember he takes his
[51:16] son and he lays him there and he says
[51:18] Lord Brother random dramatizes the story
[51:21] and he said you know he said he said
[51:22] here's the Altar and here's the
[51:24] sacrifice and he said but where's the
[51:26] lamb amen but he knew that God was not
[51:28] going to allow he said brother brand
[51:29] said he knew that if he took Isaac's
[51:31] life God was able to raise him up again
[51:33] because he received him as one even from
[51:36] the dead and so he realized that he
[51:38] couldn't that his seed was going to come
[51:40] through Isaac even if he had to take his
[51:42] life amen that's the faith of Abraham
[51:45] and we are Abraham's seed amen that
[51:47] faith is in you but we need to recognize
[51:50] our faith tonight and act on the faith
[51:52] listen we was talking in the back room
[51:54] it's not a reckless Faith it's not
[51:56] something out outside the word we don't
[51:57] go speaking children into existence if
[51:59] the Lord didn't tell us to amen but if
[52:01] God has given you a word if God has
[52:04] shown you in the word where you are to
[52:05] believe the word of God and act on the
[52:08] word then you can take that to the bank
[52:09] and you can act on it and God will back
[52:12] up his
[52:13] word amen so we don't have Reckless
[52:15] faith we don't go go around creating
[52:17] mountains where there don't need to be
[52:18] mountains and we don't need to go go
[52:20] around creating things and amen calling
[52:22] things that that we've never really you
[52:24] know well we just like this to be over
[52:26] here I mean there there's a lot of
[52:26] things I would like to do I'd like to
[52:28] pick up Hardy Arkansas and move it south
[52:30] for the
[52:32] winter come on or move it to Tucson for
[52:34] the
[52:35] winter they come out here to experience
[52:37] the wonderful weather we have but you
[52:40] just think about it tonight we we all
[52:43] say we have faith if I ask you for a
[52:44] show of hands everybody in here says
[52:46] they have
[52:47] faith right how many's got faith
[52:51] everybody's got faith but now where the
[52:53] devil will challenge you the pastor even
[52:56] has faith
[52:57] the devil will challenge you on that
[53:00] Faith tomorrow morning man when you when
[53:02] you get a headache as as high heal with
[53:05] way too often when you get a headache
[53:06] and you realize that nothing is too hard
[53:08] for God and and you don't have to suffer
[53:11] with that thing but we allow the devil
[53:13] it seems like temporary residence in our
[53:15] minds and we allow the devil to do
[53:17] things because we really don't feel like
[53:19] standing for the word of God because
[53:21] it's too hard but nothing's too hard for
[53:23] God yes amen and so we realize that
[53:27] Abraham he already had the
[53:29] child it would have been really easy for
[53:31] him to stay home and be like I've
[53:33] already got the promise I don't need to
[53:35] go sacrifice my kid I've already been
[53:38] blessed I don't really need to go to
[53:41] church I've got a job I don't really
[53:43] need blessings from God but you know you
[53:45] really do because you're going to find
[53:46] out again that you really do need
[53:49] God you really do need God because it
[53:52] just because things are going good
[53:53] that's the time you need to remember
[53:54] where your blessings came from that's
[53:56] when you still need to act on the faith
[53:58] that brought you to the blessings you're
[54:00] experiencing now amen so we realize amen
[54:03] we we get cold on God we we uh we we let
[54:06] things happen because we we feel blessed
[54:08] we get we get into a leot of sin
[54:11] condition don't we we all do I I do and
[54:13] and you get into a leoty and condition
[54:15] you don't pray as much and you don't
[54:16] seek God as much and you don't really
[54:19] feel the fervency in your heart anymore
[54:21] but I want to tell you that's the time
[54:22] when you need to realize don't get cold
[54:24] on God because there's going to be
[54:25] another Val coming up where you're going
[54:27] to need the hand of God and don't just
[54:29] put him on the outside when times are
[54:31] going good but remember where your
[54:33] strength came from remembered where your
[54:35] help came from amen remember where the
[54:38] sun came from remember when the when the
[54:40] winters are cold and the ice is on the
[54:42] roads amen remember there is a sunshine
[54:44] coming amen and thank God for the good
[54:46] days because there's going to be some
[54:48] bad days when you got to call him on the
[54:50] scene amen I believe we need to let our
[54:52] faith become in action just more than we
[54:54] ever have why because we have let our
[54:56] faith yeah we we we we we let our faith
[54:59] build in the bad times and and we start
[55:01] saying well I need a touch from God and
[55:03] so you start praying more don't we do
[55:04] that amen when things are rough and when
[55:06] our kids are backsliding well somebody
[55:08] say Amen tonight amen when you've you've
[55:10] been there you you've went through a
[55:11] financial difficulty and you start
[55:13] praying and the next thing you know you
[55:15] find yourself in a in a in a better job
[55:17] and a better car and a better house and
[55:19] and you just get a little cold on God
[55:21] Amen but you need to look up to where
[55:23] them apples are coming from Amen brother
[55:25] said don't be like that pig eating
[55:26] apples Under The Apple Tree and always
[55:28] just eating and never looking up but let
[55:30] us look up to where our blessings are
[55:32] coming from and put our faith in action
[55:34] again that even when the times are good
[55:36] let's serve God and when the times are
[55:38] bad let's serve God it doesn't matter
[55:40] what we're going through what we're not
[55:41] going through it's the time to put your
[55:43] faith in action and show the devil whose
[55:46] side you're on it's good to go to church
[55:48] when you don't need church it's good to
[55:50] go to church when you do need Church
[55:52] well can you say Amen tonight we need to
[55:54] put our faith in action as Abra abam
[55:56] seed I believe we're living below our
[55:58] privileges I believe we're living way
[56:00] down here when brother brandham taught
[56:02] us that there are untapped resources
[56:04] amen that we need to tap into and there
[56:06] are things that we are not attaining
[56:08] because we have gotten to to a
[56:10] comfortable level amen but I believe
[56:12] there needs to be a more of a fervency
[56:15] in our lives when we come to church
[56:17] anden when the spirit of God is moving
[56:18] in the building I want to participate in
[56:21] the worship and in the presence of God
[56:23] while he's here amen I don't want to get
[56:25] So Satisfied
[56:26] with the way my life is that I can't cry
[56:29] out to God even in a blessed State I
[56:31] want to say Lord thank you for blessing
[56:33] me thank you for saving my soul thank
[56:35] you for bringing my children to me amen
[56:37] and then when the bad times come you'll
[56:40] have a a connection there you've talked
[56:42] to him before and you know that you can
[56:44] reach out one more time and say Lord
[56:46] thank you for blessing me but I'm in a
[56:48] trial right now and then watch him come
[56:50] on the scene and bless you like never
[56:52] before anden that's the way Abraham was
[56:54] he'd already received blessings he had
[56:56] already seen the goodness of God what
[56:58] about you you've all seen the goodness
[57:00] of God in your life amen but then when
[57:02] he come to a place of decision where he
[57:04] had to serve God and put his faith in
[57:06] action or he had to just go ahead and
[57:09] say well I don't need to do that but the
[57:12] Lord told him to and you'll watch and
[57:14] when he puts his faith in action there
[57:17] arose a lamb I mean there was a lamb in
[57:19] the wilderness and and that lamb was the
[57:21] ram excuse me was there because brother
[57:24] BR said he had to be put there by God
[57:26] because there's no way that he would be
[57:28] there amen with with with with with no
[57:30] water and no grass up there in the top
[57:32] of the mountain but he said he was
[57:33] caught in the thicket and he said that
[57:35] was God's provided Ram to take his place
[57:38] why because of the faith of Abraham God
[57:41] would have never put the ram there and
[57:43] Abraham said I'm not going to the
[57:45] mountain I'm not going to sacrifice my
[57:46] son but God shows up when you're in
[57:49] obedience to his word can you say amen
[57:51] amen that's when we got to put our faith
[57:53] in action if you put your faith in
[57:55] action I believe you'll see
[57:56] the glory of God when you come to church
[57:59] if you if you come in faith believing
[58:02] that God's going to come then you don't
[58:04] have to worry if he's going to show up
[58:05] or not he'll be there he'll provide a
[58:07] service that you need he'll provide the
[58:10] word that is needed to be preached he'll
[58:11] provide the spirit that you need to be
[58:13] in for your soul that come on church we
[58:15] just need to believe again that God is
[58:18] still in the saving Soul business he's
[58:20] still in the healing business amen he's
[58:22] still God and he changes not the same
[58:25] God that could could provide a ram in
[58:26] the wilderness is the same God that can
[58:29] provide for you today whether it's a job
[58:31] or whether it's for your children well
[58:33] come on somebody amen we need to realize
[58:35] that the same God is still here and he's
[58:37] still working he never stops working
[58:40] he's still working he's still a way
[58:42] maker he's still God and he changes not
[58:45] is that okay tonight I think we just
[58:47] need to realize that God is good amen in
[58:50] the bad times he's still good and let
[58:52] our faith go into action Amen brother
[58:56] talks about him he said he said the Holy
[58:58] Spirit grabbed his hand and said Abraham
[59:00] stay your hand I know you love me why
[59:03] because he met the requirements of God
[59:06] he went where God told him to go he was
[59:09] in obedience to God and then God
[59:10] provided a way of Escape can you say
[59:13] amen and brother brandom said he said I
[59:16] don't doubt he said about that time he
[59:18] said he said that thing he said that RAM
[59:19] bleeded and he brother brandom has a
[59:21] little fit here he says hallelujah
[59:23] praise our God he said well come on
[59:25] somebody you know sometimes we get way
[59:26] too quiet in church and I know I harped
[59:28] on that a lot but that's because I get a
[59:30] lot of these Sunday afternoon
[59:32] Services you say brother Joel why you
[59:34] always preaching about people shouting
[59:35] in church because I have to look at you
[59:37] when you're in a food
[59:39] coma and you're all sitting there
[59:41] looking at me like brother Joel would
[59:43] you quit harping at us I will when you
[59:44] start
[59:46] shouting when you I'm sorry that wasn't
[59:49] in my
[59:50] notes so you don't have to believe it
[59:54] come on but you know he is the same God
[59:57] and you know we we tend to let me just
[59:59] speak for myself we tend to shout a
[1:00:01] little bit more when we see the
[1:00:03] blessings of God in our life right on
[1:00:06] but when you don't feel
[1:00:08] him he's still there Abraham didn't feel
[1:00:12] very good when he was about ready to
[1:00:13] take his son's life but he said even now
[1:00:17] you're more than able to provide a
[1:00:20] sacrifice come on somebody even in the
[1:00:23] valley that you're in today there is
[1:00:25] Faith on the inside of you that you
[1:00:27] don't even know you've got but if you
[1:00:28] would just go ahead and say I'm going to
[1:00:30] go in obedience to the word of God come
[1:00:32] on somebody amen God might put you in a
[1:00:34] place where it's where you struggle for
[1:00:36] a while I know I know you know sometimes
[1:00:38] in this area it's jobs and and you
[1:00:40] struggle maybe to get a job or you
[1:00:42] struggle you struggle to get in church
[1:00:43] because you have to drive away listen I
[1:00:45] believe if we'll just be in obedience to
[1:00:47] the word of God that God is required to
[1:00:49] back up his word I believe if we'll go
[1:00:51] in obedience and we'll say you know what
[1:00:53] I'm surrendering my will to your way I'm
[1:00:56] s I'm surrendering what I am to the to
[1:00:58] the will of God and I believe that if
[1:01:00] we'll do that and put our faith in
[1:01:02] action God will honor the faith in this
[1:01:04] bride I believe that with all of my
[1:01:06] heart I believe he will come on somebody
[1:01:08] amen I believe if God has chosen you to
[1:01:10] be here then he'll provide a way for you
[1:01:11] to be here if God has placed you here
[1:01:14] then God will give you what you have
[1:01:16] need of to make it through life's
[1:01:17] journey amen God did not promise to
[1:01:19] leave you or forsake you but he said I
[1:01:21] will never leave you or forsake you I
[1:01:24] will always be with you I will always be
[1:01:26] in you amen just let your faith go to
[1:01:29] work tonight and God will move on the
[1:01:31] scene in your situation can the church
[1:01:33] say amen amen think about think about
[1:01:36] the woman at the well if you think about
[1:01:37] her brother Ben mentioned her this
[1:01:39] morning you think about that she goes
[1:01:41] out there she wasn't even expecting to
[1:01:43] meet
[1:01:44] Jesus but when she met him she
[1:01:47] recognized him why because she was
[1:01:50] taught that he would come we were taught
[1:01:52] that he was going to come we knew that
[1:01:54] Messiah would come and tell us all these
[1:01:56] things but where is he and he said I am
[1:01:58] he I believe he'll make himself known to
[1:02:00] you if you'll just be at the right place
[1:02:03] at the right time I believe if we're
[1:02:05] waiting at the well today that he will
[1:02:07] send us amen someone that we're going to
[1:02:10] recognize his presence amen I believe
[1:02:12] tonight we need to just come to the well
[1:02:14] and realize that he is waiting by the
[1:02:17] wellside even for you tonight amen I
[1:02:19] don't care if you've been in sin I don't
[1:02:21] care if you've fallen from grace and
[1:02:23] amen the church might not have accepted
[1:02:25] you or amen the pastor maybe look at you
[1:02:27] and say well I don't know how they're
[1:02:29] going to make it amen but if you made it
[1:02:31] to the well of Grace tonight amen it was
[1:02:33] by the faith that was on the inside of
[1:02:35] you and when you recognize that God is
[1:02:37] here and his word is still true you can
[1:02:40] say Amen come see a man that changed my
[1:02:42] life come see a man I believe we ought
[1:02:45] to be on fire for God to say come see a
[1:02:47] message that has changed my life amen
[1:02:49] come see what God is doing for me amen
[1:02:52] but we've been so discouraged because of
[1:02:54] the the trials we faced and because of
[1:02:56] our past and we're looking saying lord
[1:02:58] well can you really change me can you
[1:03:00] really save me if he did it for me he
[1:03:03] can do it for you come on somebody
[1:03:05] somebody in the building has been so far
[1:03:07] removed from grace that you thought
[1:03:09] there wasn't a way back amen but you're
[1:03:10] sitting here today because Grace is good
[1:03:14] God is good and Grace is here and come
[1:03:16] on somebody listen I'm not trying to
[1:03:18] work you up tonight but you need to get
[1:03:19] praise because God has given you another
[1:03:22] chance to sit in the house of God I say
[1:03:24] God you been good to me your grace still
[1:03:27] amazes me amen your love is still
[1:03:29] running after me nothing is going to
[1:03:32] take me out because his grace his grace
[1:03:36] amen he saw in me a faith that I didn't
[1:03:38] know I had he saw in me grace mean he
[1:03:41] saw in me amen a Son of God before I
[1:03:44] ever knew there was a Son of God in Me
[1:03:46] amen and I believe with all my heart
[1:03:48] that if I put my faith in action then
[1:03:49] God is going to take care of everything
[1:03:51] else oh yeah what can you say Amen all
[1:03:54] I've got to do is do my part
[1:03:56] I can't save
[1:03:58] myself I can't do nothing to enter in
[1:04:01] but I can show up and give him myself
[1:04:04] and then God will take over amen by the
[1:04:06] faith that is on the inside of me amen
[1:04:09] The Works that I do will show that I do
[1:04:11] believe the message of the hour I will
[1:04:13] show up and do what God told me to do
[1:04:15] but it's not what's going to save me
[1:04:17] he's going to save me by his Amazing
[1:04:19] Grace because I've showed up and I'm
[1:04:21] just a vessel that he can
[1:04:23] fill ammen brother Justin God has put
[1:04:26] you here and if he put you here he
[1:04:27] provides amen when the going gets tough
[1:04:30] sometimes it gets hard sometimes it's
[1:04:32] the devil's going to attack your mind
[1:04:34] and the devil's going to attack your
[1:04:35] finances and and I know I'm not I'm not
[1:04:38] preaching about Prosperity tonight amen
[1:04:40] but you know God is is concerned about
[1:04:42] the little things in your life and God
[1:04:44] is concerned about all that you have
[1:04:46] whether it's your finances or whether
[1:04:48] it's your health well can you say man
[1:04:50] whether it's your children whether it's
[1:04:51] a church you go to God is concerned
[1:04:54] about it he cares for you but do you
[1:04:56] care for
[1:04:58] him that's it he cares he cares enough
[1:05:02] to die for you do we care enough to live
[1:05:05] for him well can you say amen and so I
[1:05:09] want to tie this into this I believe
[1:05:10] it's a seed on the inside of you that is
[1:05:13] planted a
[1:05:14] faith so the faith without works is dead
[1:05:18] that doesn't mean the faith isn't there
[1:05:20] come on but the faith is not in action
[1:05:23] come on we okay so far amen and the
[1:05:26] faith until it becomes in action is is
[1:05:29] just dead it's just there but it has
[1:05:31] never taken an action so you say I have
[1:05:35] faith I I I know people that say I
[1:05:37] believe the message you can say well I
[1:05:38] have faith I I have the faith of the
[1:05:40] message amen but they don't believe in
[1:05:41] going to church anymore and and and you
[1:05:44] can't say you can't say you love God and
[1:05:47] hate your brother come on you can't say
[1:05:49] I love God but I don't want to assemble
[1:05:51] with his people well can you say Amen
[1:05:53] you can't say I love God but but I come
[1:05:55] on well I just love preaching Sunday
[1:05:57] afternoons I plow a little bit and that
[1:06:00] takes me back to the farming
[1:06:02] days you just plow and you plow and you
[1:06:04] plow well praise the Lord I got the boys
[1:06:07] awake tonight
[1:06:08] Hallelujah y'all still
[1:06:11] okay amen there's a seat on the inside
[1:06:14] of you that you didn't put
[1:06:16] there come on it was planted on the
[1:06:19] inside of you and the the thing about it
[1:06:22] is we have to remember that there's
[1:06:24] nothing we can do
[1:06:26] in ourselves but surrender in order for
[1:06:29] that seed to mature you can't save
[1:06:32] yourself you can't baptize
[1:06:35] yourself come on there's a lot of things
[1:06:37] you can't do by yourself I guess you
[1:06:39] could baptize yourself now that I think
[1:06:41] about
[1:06:41] it technically you could dunk
[1:06:44] yourself I guess if you were in a place
[1:06:46] where there was nobody to baptize you
[1:06:47] you can do
[1:06:50] that sorry about the false Doctrine
[1:06:54] Pastor you take communion by yourself
[1:07:00] too I got to make you do something
[1:07:04] whether it's laugh cry or something you
[1:07:06] know but the truth of it
[1:07:08] is we didn't get here on our own come
[1:07:11] on the turtle on the fence post he
[1:07:15] didn't get there by himself right come
[1:07:17] on but we need to recognize who put us
[1:07:20] here and that should put a faith in us
[1:07:23] can you say Amen that should put a faith
[1:07:25] in in us that we would know that if God
[1:07:28] has brought me this far if God has put
[1:07:31] me on top the fence post then God's able
[1:07:34] to do whatever God wants to do and so
[1:07:37] that should create a faith in us that
[1:07:39] would actually say you know what I mean
[1:07:41] if the word of God says it I'm going to
[1:07:43] stake my life on it why because it's
[1:07:46] true even if I don't understand it even
[1:07:48] if I don't know how God's going to do
[1:07:50] something I believe he can do it even if
[1:07:52] and the three Hebrew children are a good
[1:07:54] example of that amen they were in the
[1:07:56] fiery furnace and he and the King had
[1:07:58] put them there amen they said well even
[1:08:00] if we go in there God is able to to to
[1:08:04] uh to to keep us from the flames and God
[1:08:06] is able to Deliver Us from the furnace
[1:08:08] God is more than able even if he's even
[1:08:10] if you've been put in a bad situation
[1:08:13] can you help me preach for a few minutes
[1:08:14] amen if God has put you in a bad or if
[1:08:17] the devil has put you in a bad situation
[1:08:19] God had to allow the situation to come
[1:08:21] so we should not lose Faith over the
[1:08:23] hard times that we've been put in
[1:08:26] we need to let our faith grow in the
[1:08:28] hard times and in the good times because
[1:08:31] if you see the blessings if you're on
[1:08:32] the fence post and God put you there
[1:08:34] then thank God for placing you on the
[1:08:36] fence post and if you can't see the
[1:08:39] blessings of God then you need to look
[1:08:41] around and say you know what I'm going
[1:08:42] to stay here and I'm going to worship
[1:08:44] God and I'm going to do what God said
[1:08:47] and I know that God is going to bless me
[1:08:49] why because his word has never returned
[1:08:52] to him void and if God has promised
[1:08:55] something to you hold on to the promise
[1:08:57] and put your faith in action and so
[1:09:01] that's the works of Faith now remember
[1:09:02] we we started out with faith without
[1:09:04] works is dead but I want you to notice
[1:09:06] that that your faith is not what saves
[1:09:08] you amen Works don't save you you can't
[1:09:10] pray your way into heaven you can't work
[1:09:12] your way into heaven if if you could do
[1:09:14] that amen the Catholic Church would have
[1:09:16] a good idea amen they could work their
[1:09:17] way and work their way and say so many
[1:09:19] Hail marries and things like that that's
[1:09:21] not what saves you amen but if you love
[1:09:24] God then you look at his word and read
[1:09:26] his word and you won't just let the
[1:09:27] letter set there but you'll apply the
[1:09:30] letter to your heart and you will obey
[1:09:32] what the word of God has already told
[1:09:34] you to do listen it's not something that
[1:09:36] we we say well if I didn't read my Bible
[1:09:38] today I'm going to hell that's not true
[1:09:39] at all if you're saved you can't be lost
[1:09:42] but if you're really saved there's going
[1:09:44] to be a desire on the inside of you to
[1:09:46] pick up your Bible and read it well can
[1:09:48] you sayen if you're really a message
[1:09:50] believer the tapes are not going to get
[1:09:52] Dusty on the shelf or you're never
[1:09:54] you're going to listen to the mess
[1:09:55] message of the hour at some point in
[1:09:57] your life you're not going to go through
[1:09:58] your whole life and say well I don't
[1:09:59] need the message no if you're a real
[1:10:01] message believer it's on the inside of
[1:10:03] you and it longs to hear the voice of
[1:10:06] the Prophet can you say amen that's
[1:10:08] right is that okay tonight you know I
[1:10:10] think that's something listen I know
[1:10:11] people in the message say we don't need
[1:10:13] the tapes anymore I'm going to go and
[1:10:14] tell you something news flash the
[1:10:16] message is a part of you you can't help
[1:10:18] but feed on
[1:10:19] [Applause]
[1:10:21] it well I don't need the message I don't
[1:10:23] need it I don't well yes you do yeah
[1:10:25] because the message is what's going to
[1:10:26] call a bride to get out of here in a
[1:10:27] Rapture well can you say amen amen I
[1:10:30] believe we've let the we've let the
[1:10:31] message get cold in our homes because we
[1:10:33] don't we don't put our faith in action
[1:10:35] but if you've really got faith that God
[1:10:37] sent a prophet in this day to call out a
[1:10:40] bride then your faith will be an action
[1:10:42] to believe what he said is that okay to
[1:10:46] speak to your mountain is the action of
[1:10:48] faith brother BR goes on down like
[1:10:51] this I'm almost out of time so I'll
[1:10:53] hurry
[1:10:55] he said now what did Abraham do he
[1:10:57] staggered not at the promises of God at
[1:11:00] the
[1:11:00] impossibilities he staggered not at the
[1:11:03] impossibilities is that Gooden so when
[1:11:06] you look at something in your life that
[1:11:08] is
[1:11:09] impossible he man we don't we don't
[1:11:10] stagger at that we don't believe that
[1:11:12] God can't do it because God can do
[1:11:16] whatever he wants to do that's right God
[1:11:19] is more than able you believe that
[1:11:21] tonight and so that's the faith of
[1:11:23] Abraham and brother Brandon would say it
[1:11:25] like this he said it makes you act funny
[1:11:28] come
[1:11:29] on well anybody else here want to act
[1:11:32] funny then you just need more faith of
[1:11:34] Abraham because brother Ram told tells
[1:11:37] us that that the reason that Abraham
[1:11:38] acted funny was because he was holding
[1:11:40] on to a promise and going around
[1:11:42] testifying of the goodness of God and
[1:11:44] saying me an old man and brother Brandon
[1:11:46] would would say it he said he would go
[1:11:47] into the and he would be be telling
[1:11:49] people you know we're going to have a
[1:11:50] baby me and Sarah's going to have a baby
[1:11:52] and and I usually pick on Bill and Sarah
[1:11:53] if I say something like this are Bill
[1:11:55] and Karen when I say something like this
[1:11:57] maybe she's already been changed to
[1:11:58] Sarah I'm not
[1:12:00] sure but I usually pick on them because
[1:12:02] they're the uh oldest in the
[1:12:05] church and uh although sister Karen's
[1:12:07] not old
[1:12:10] but I love it when I get into these
[1:12:14] situations but he says but he goes
[1:12:17] around testifying of the goodness of God
[1:12:19] and the people call him a fanatic and
[1:12:20] they say you know you're crazy for
[1:12:22] believing what you believe and and you
[1:12:24] know I'll be honest with you the world
[1:12:26] if they're not calling you crazy if
[1:12:27] you're fitting in with the world you
[1:12:28] probably ought to check your
[1:12:29] testimony yes sir because the world is
[1:12:32] is is imity with God it is not amen God
[1:12:35] and the world they don't they don't get
[1:12:37] along they don't they just don't go
[1:12:39] together amen the the ideas that the
[1:12:41] world has that the way God is and the
[1:12:44] type of love that the world says he is
[1:12:46] is just not true amen we are we are not
[1:12:49] to be we are not to be partakers of what
[1:12:51] the world thinks but we are to be
[1:12:53] partakers of what the word of God has
[1:12:55] already said amen you say I need the
[1:12:57] word I need a word from the lord well
[1:12:58] I'll tell you the word from the Lord is
[1:13:00] right here amen you say well I need to
[1:13:03] hear the voice of God I will if you'll
[1:13:05] just speak what the word says that is
[1:13:07] the voice of God speaking out of your
[1:13:08] own mouth and so tonight if you say I
[1:13:11] need something from God speak over your
[1:13:14] situation and that is just as good as
[1:13:16] God coming down and speaking
[1:13:19] himself why because it is God in you
[1:13:22] Christ in you and it is the stronger man
[1:13:24] as for the been preached this morning
[1:13:26] the strong man of the house has come
[1:13:28] down and spoke over your situation but
[1:13:30] he uses your hands and he uses your feet
[1:13:33] and he uses your voice it is God in you
[1:13:36] that is overcoming the world Amen by the
[1:13:38] faith that is already on the inside of
[1:13:40] you amen the faith is not just something
[1:13:43] amen that we talk about can you say Amen
[1:13:45] the faith is not something we think we
[1:13:47] have but it is an assurance that we have
[1:13:49] the faith in our heart and me when I was
[1:13:51] baptized I didn't know really if I if I
[1:13:53] was going to get the Holy Ghost but I
[1:13:55] believed if I did get baptized that I
[1:13:57] would receive the Holy Ghost and so I
[1:13:59] held on to that promise that I needed to
[1:14:01] be baptized and if I was baptized I
[1:14:03] would receive the Holy Ghost I didn't
[1:14:05] right then but about six months later I
[1:14:07] did and I'm thankful to God tonight that
[1:14:09] because I obeyed his word he backed up
[1:14:12] his word and gave me a desire to live
[1:14:14] out this message and the desire has
[1:14:17] never died listen you say how do I know
[1:14:19] I got it because there's a fervency on
[1:14:21] the inside of you to serve God Amen come
[1:14:25] on can you say Amen there's something on
[1:14:28] the inside of you that says I I I want
[1:14:30] to please God I want to do what the word
[1:14:32] of God says listen I'm not I'm not so
[1:14:34] legalistic that I say everybody am in
[1:14:36] the mid of the service is not a
[1:14:38] Christian I don't ever want to get that
[1:14:39] way although I am a legalist on that and
[1:14:41] everybody's told me so but but but I'm
[1:14:43] not put listen I don't put people out
[1:14:45] because of that some people can't go
[1:14:46] some people miss church some people the
[1:14:48] world is putes in place I understand all
[1:14:50] that but there needs to be a desire in
[1:14:53] your heart to obey the word yes amen the
[1:14:56] desire is one thing if you've lost the
[1:14:57] desire then you need to get back and get
[1:14:59] a refilling of the Holy Ghost if you've
[1:15:02] lost the desire I'm not saying amen that
[1:15:04] you'll never do anything wrong but your
[1:15:06] desire is to please God Amen it's not in
[1:15:09] my heart Amen to fail God and if I do
[1:15:12] fail God there's something on the inside
[1:15:14] of me an action of faith that calls me
[1:15:16] back and puts me in line with the word
[1:15:18] again that's the action of faith I'm
[1:15:20] talking about I'm not talking about your
[1:15:21] Works saving you or your Works taking
[1:15:23] you in a Rapture and but I'm talking
[1:15:25] about the works you do bear witness of
[1:15:27] the one that is on the inside of you
[1:15:30] amen Jesus would stand there and he
[1:15:32] would say the works that I do bear
[1:15:33] witness of my father and I would say
[1:15:36] today the works that you do bear witness
[1:15:38] of the faith that is on the inside of
[1:15:41] you it's the truth it's the truth if if
[1:15:44] you're if you're working for the devil
[1:15:46] then don't tell me you're in service for
[1:15:48] God Amen but if you're trying your best
[1:15:50] and yes you're falling down yes and
[1:15:52] you're making mistakes amen but there's
[1:15:54] a desire your heart to please God I say
[1:15:57] just hold on to that desire because I
[1:15:59] believe that God will come through for
[1:16:01] you and he'll move mountains for you
[1:16:03] he'll make situations me turn around for
[1:16:06] you and me he'll save the children in
[1:16:08] your family that need to come back come
[1:16:10] on somebody you need to recognize that
[1:16:12] God is still God and if the desire to
[1:16:15] serve him is on the inside of you just
[1:16:18] hold on to that desire amen that desire
[1:16:20] that is on the inside of you it is
[1:16:22] holding you until the day of your
[1:16:24] Redemption it is a seal from God Amen
[1:16:27] the people that have lost their desire
[1:16:29] we need to pray for them amen the ones
[1:16:31] that just don't they don't believe that
[1:16:32] there's anything Amen to to to attain by
[1:16:35] by doing what the word of God says amen
[1:16:37] but the word of God is Not Just A Book
[1:16:39] of Rules it is not a book of dos and
[1:16:41] don'ts amen but it is a book that shows
[1:16:43] you there is a Redemption plan and if
[1:16:46] you can find yourself in the Redemption
[1:16:48] of the open book then you'll find out
[1:16:50] that God has placed you as a son or a
[1:16:53] daughter of God and all the time every
[1:16:55] move that you make is in the plan of God
[1:16:58] and you cannot get outside of his will
[1:17:00] without God allowing you to feel
[1:17:03] something maybe it's something in your
[1:17:04] job or something in your church and God
[1:17:06] will bring you back in line with the
[1:17:08] word amen you can't serve God on your
[1:17:10] own but something on the inside of you
[1:17:13] cannot deny this message something on
[1:17:15] the inside of you has held you this far
[1:17:18] it will lead you all the way home amen
[1:17:21] this message is not something just to be
[1:17:23] looked at or talked about but it's
[1:17:25] something to be
[1:17:27] lived am man we can I saw an
[1:17:29] illustration at camp where there was a
[1:17:31] there was a man there preaching and he
[1:17:33] was he was talking about the message and
[1:17:35] he made it a guitar stand and he said
[1:17:36] that's the message and if I just set it
[1:17:39] there and I I don't pick it up or I
[1:17:40] don't use it then it doesn't do me no
[1:17:42] good I can look at the message I can
[1:17:43] talk about the message I can say I know
[1:17:45] the message but I've got to use the
[1:17:47] message I've got to pick that up and use
[1:17:49] it for its intended purpose amen this
[1:17:51] message is the word of God Amen it is to
[1:17:54] make you make you overcome in a world
[1:17:57] where all the Devils of hell are against
[1:17:59] you but greater is the strong man than
[1:18:01] all the Devils that are coming against
[1:18:03] you and me is the word of God the faith
[1:18:05] that is in you is what you need for a
[1:18:08] Rapture than you Lord that's right that
[1:18:11] little bit of faith that you can't see
[1:18:13] that little bit of faith that sometimes
[1:18:14] you can't feel is all you
[1:18:17] need because if you didn't have that
[1:18:20] Faith you wouldn't be sitting here today
[1:18:22] that's right that's right Faith brought
[1:18:24] you to church
[1:18:25] come on faith did you say well I brought
[1:18:28] myself to church sure you did you
[1:18:31] wouldn't be here if it was you come on I
[1:18:34] wouldn't be here either especially if
[1:18:36] you had to hear me especially if I had
[1:18:39] to hear me talking to
[1:18:42] myself sometimes I feel that way in the
[1:18:44] Pulpit you
[1:18:46] know Lord what am I doing up here it
[1:18:49] makes you act funny that's all I got out
[1:18:51] of that quote but you know what praise
[1:18:53] the Lord we'll keep going he said
[1:18:54] decisions are odd to the
[1:18:57] world that's right can the church say
[1:18:59] Amen am but it's a Believer no matter
[1:19:03] how strange it seems he said the Bible
[1:19:06] says that Abraham was fully persuaded
[1:19:08] that God was able to perform what he
[1:19:09] said he would do and that ought to be
[1:19:11] the achievement of every believer this
[1:19:15] afternoon amen somebody say Amen to that
[1:19:18] that ought to be the achievement of
[1:19:19] every believer this afternoon God is
[1:19:21] able to keep every word that he said he
[1:19:24] do I don't care how little it is I don't
[1:19:27] care how big it is I don't care how
[1:19:29] impossible it seem God Specializes in
[1:19:33] the
[1:19:34] impossible yes he does and if he does
[1:19:36] that for one person he is obligated to
[1:19:39] do it for every one of us brother Lucas
[1:19:41] every person in the building it listen
[1:19:43] God cannot do one thing for Abraham and
[1:19:46] then not do it for you that's right well
[1:19:49] can you sayen Abraham was the father of
[1:19:51] Faith but it wasn't just for Abraham
[1:19:53] that is to show that you with that faith
[1:19:56] can achieve the same thing that Abraham
[1:19:59] achieved amen at one he finally got to a
[1:20:01] place amen that body had to get changed
[1:20:03] again and I'm looking for that body to
[1:20:06] be changed in my life listen church I I
[1:20:08] we're not just here to be Christians but
[1:20:10] we're looking for
[1:20:11] rapture we need to I I I think faith is
[1:20:14] one of the greatest things the church
[1:20:15] lacks today because we don't recognize
[1:20:18] the faith that we already
[1:20:20] have and so we live below our privileges
[1:20:23] you have faith but live down here
[1:20:25] worried if God's going to take care of
[1:20:26] you tomorrow come on can you say Amen
[1:20:30] but if God has given you the faith then
[1:20:33] he will take care of you thank you Lord
[1:20:36] so sometimes if it's in the will of God
[1:20:38] step out on faith if it's in the word of
[1:20:41] God do it and worry about the
[1:20:44] repercussions
[1:20:47] later you know sometimes we just need to
[1:20:49] take God at his
[1:20:50] word you say this is too
[1:20:53] simple well mostly quotes So if it's
[1:20:56] simple blame the
[1:20:58] prophet that's the reason he said I do
[1:21:00] believe that when that bride is called
[1:21:01] out and elected and set in The Book of
[1:21:04] Life there will come a sound from Heaven
[1:21:05] that will take such a baptism of the
[1:21:07] Holy Spirit of the Bride that'll take
[1:21:08] her from the earth in a rapturing
[1:21:11] Grace God promised it don't care how
[1:21:13] many science how many astronauts they
[1:21:15] signed up and everything else how many
[1:21:17] million miles they can see I don't care
[1:21:19] nothing about that there is a heaven and
[1:21:21] there is a literal Jesus Christ that
[1:21:23] will come in a body form to receive his
[1:21:24] church to himself no matter how old the
[1:21:27] story seems it's still the
[1:21:30] truth no matter how I don't care if your
[1:21:32] grandpa preached it or your great-
[1:21:33] grandpa preached it and I don't if I
[1:21:35] become an old man I want to stand here
[1:21:37] by the grace of God and preach that he's
[1:21:39] still coming back for me because I don't
[1:21:42] believe that there's any any way that
[1:21:44] the faith on the inside of me could die
[1:21:46] because of time or die because of age I
[1:21:48] believe it is something God placed there
[1:21:50] and it is going to change my body and
[1:21:53] brother B would go on said now the
[1:21:55] unchangeable word and the Word was made
[1:21:57] flesh and dwelt Among Us he said God
[1:21:59] raised up bodies all down through Moses
[1:22:01] Ezekiel Jeremiah Isaiah and Elijah's all
[1:22:03] down where his word temporarily come but
[1:22:06] the full word was made manifest in this
[1:22:09] man Jesus Christ which he was God in the
[1:22:11] fullness of the godhead bodily there he
[1:22:13] was made flesh I believe that every word
[1:22:15] and he goes on down and he said Christ
[1:22:17] was God's word made manifest and he died
[1:22:20] gave his life that he might send the
[1:22:22] spirit and take his body up and send his
[1:22:24] spirit back he said he said uh to pay
[1:22:26] the redeeming price he said if we'll
[1:22:28] believe it that's it right there if you
[1:22:30] believe it he that believeth on me the
[1:22:32] works that I do he said then come the
[1:22:34] Holy Spirit upon the same word of God he
[1:22:37] said now where do you throw it upon the
[1:22:38] Bible then he said the Bible has got to
[1:22:40] be in
[1:22:42] you oh yeah what can you say man you say
[1:22:45] well we don't need the Bible anymore
[1:22:46] you've got to become one with the Bible
[1:22:49] he said the Bible has got to be in you
[1:22:51] he said and the word is a seed and as
[1:22:54] long as it's laying here it won't do
[1:22:56] nothing but when it comes in here when
[1:22:59] it comes in the heart then it begins to
[1:23:01] manifest by the Holy Spirit The Works of
[1:23:04] God so if you have the spirit of Christ
[1:23:07] in you the spirit will work the same
[1:23:09] things that he did when he was here Amen
[1:23:12] brother Brandon would tie it to he said
[1:23:13] if you had the spirit of Dillinger you
[1:23:15] would do what Dillinger did if you had
[1:23:17] the spirit of uh you know all the of a
[1:23:19] murderer you would do what a murderer
[1:23:20] does or if you had a spirit of of of a
[1:23:22] painter you would do all these things
[1:23:24] listen if you have the spirit of Christ
[1:23:27] then you you will do the spirit it's not
[1:23:29] something you make yourself do but it is
[1:23:31] something on the inside of you that is
[1:23:33] overcoming that man on the outside that
[1:23:35] is trying to hold you back and you are
[1:23:38] becoming what the word says you would be
[1:23:40] in this hour and brother man would go on
[1:23:42] he said now he said now go power comes
[1:23:44] and humility comes he said he said it
[1:23:46] comes into the heart power comes
[1:23:48] humility comes remember that he said now
[1:23:50] all your know it all is gone and you
[1:23:53] become nothing and Christ becomes
[1:23:56] alive can you say amen he said I live he
[1:24:00] said he died I live he said when he
[1:24:02] lives again and he said when I die he
[1:24:05] promised me life and I died out to
[1:24:07] myself in order I can have his life and
[1:24:09] he said now how do I do it by taking his
[1:24:12] word his seed now he said put his seed
[1:24:15] in here by faith and believe it and then
[1:24:17] it produces exactly what the Bible said
[1:24:20] amen so the faith cometh by hearing amen
[1:24:22] and hearing of the word of God but if
[1:24:24] you'll remember the the the hearing is
[1:24:26] not alone good enough but you've got to
[1:24:28] be doers also of what you've heard amen
[1:24:31] so we pick up this message and we put it
[1:24:34] into action and say what the prophet
[1:24:36] said I'm going to do what the Bible says
[1:24:39] I'm going to do and me it's not good
[1:24:41] enough to just say I believe a message
[1:24:43] but we've got to put it into action
[1:24:45] today Church somebody's going to and
[1:24:48] somebody's going to take a body change I
[1:24:50] say let it be this little church in
[1:24:51] Hardy Arkansas where we can put our
[1:24:53] shoulder the will and say I'm going to
[1:24:55] work for the Lord I'm going to live for
[1:24:57] the Lord I'm going to be an example for
[1:24:59] the younger generation and I'm going to
[1:25:00] do what God has already told me to do I
[1:25:03] don't care if floods or high water would
[1:25:06] come I don't care what comes against me
[1:25:08] I'm going to stay in the will of God
[1:25:10] according to the word of God and the
[1:25:12] faith that is on the inside of me will
[1:25:15] act out what God has placed there amen
[1:25:17] so if you see me acting like a message
[1:25:19] believer it's because the message is on
[1:25:21] the inside amen oh yeah yeah is that
[1:25:25] right now that don't mean that you're
[1:25:27] always going to do good things and say
[1:25:29] good things because remember the
[1:25:32] flesh but when the flesh gets you down
[1:25:36] there is a desire to change you on the
[1:25:39] inside is that
[1:25:40] okay brother brandom goes on like this
[1:25:43] my time is almost up but brother Danny
[1:25:47] told me not to worry about time so we'll
[1:25:48] keep going for a
[1:25:51] minute he said nobody amens when you say
[1:25:53] that stuff brother been nobody brother
[1:25:55] Stuart that's when you say amen amen
[1:25:58] amen right there right
[1:26:01] there man we just you know nobody wants
[1:26:04] to hear about the all night prayer
[1:26:05] meetings or the six-h hour sermons on
[1:26:07] the nobody wants to hear about that I
[1:26:09] had a preacher call me the other day he
[1:26:10] was preaching and he called he bragged
[1:26:12] about a three-hour sermon he said nobody
[1:26:13] complained about it and I wasn't there
[1:26:17] so I couldn't complain about
[1:26:18] it but I would have
[1:26:21] probably brother random said now
[1:26:23] preaching the gospel was to demonstrate
[1:26:24] the power are you still with me can I
[1:26:27] have five minutes okay good I gave you a
[1:26:30] time now y'all can hold it to me and
[1:26:31] call me a liar if I don't do it he said
[1:26:33] he said it was to demonstrate so I want
[1:26:35] you to notice that taking the the
[1:26:38] Commission in closing taking the
[1:26:40] commission to preach the gospel wasn't
[1:26:42] enough on but you had to put that into
[1:26:44] action if he' said go you into all the
[1:26:46] world and preach the gospel and they
[1:26:47] would have said hey that was a good word
[1:26:48] did you hear what Jesus
[1:26:49] said he told us to go into all the world
[1:26:51] and preach the gospel well then you
[1:26:53] better have something to say
[1:26:55] and you better do what he said do come
[1:26:57] on somebody amen so if they would have
[1:26:59] just sit around and just uh talked among
[1:27:01] themselves about the words of Jesus they
[1:27:03] would have never reached nobody amen if
[1:27:05] if we do that among ourselves and we
[1:27:07] decide we're going to you know just make
[1:27:08] ourselves our little home churches and
[1:27:11] and not to offend anybody that might
[1:27:12] listen to this but but but but just make
[1:27:14] our little home churches and we're going
[1:27:15] to listen to the words of a prophet and
[1:27:17] that's good and that's we we should do
[1:27:19] that in our homes I believe we should
[1:27:20] amen but if that's all we do and we fail
[1:27:23] to fulfill the commission
[1:27:24] that is to put his words in action then
[1:27:26] church we are hearers only and not doers
[1:27:29] also of the word of God but I think it's
[1:27:31] time the church gets in action and not
[1:27:34] just talk about a message but live a
[1:27:36] message of the hour amen not just talk
[1:27:37] about the tapes but go ahead and listen
[1:27:39] to them tapes and apply the tapes to
[1:27:41] your life amen I believe we need to go
[1:27:43] ahead and say it's not just a message
[1:27:45] but it's a message living in me amen
[1:27:47] it's not just the voice of a prophet but
[1:27:49] it's the voice of the Bride that is the
[1:27:51] final a final voice to the final age it
[1:27:53] is not just a faith that is on the
[1:27:55] inside of me but it is a faith that is
[1:27:57] living out through my body and it is
[1:27:59] making my body come under the words of
[1:28:01] My Confession am man I want to use your
[1:28:03] quote again and we got to doubt our
[1:28:05] doubts tonight quit and just start
[1:28:07] doubting all the the things that have
[1:28:08] come against us and start believing that
[1:28:10] God is more than able Amen to cause all
[1:28:13] of our situations to come under his
[1:28:15] control because after all if we think
[1:28:18] we're in control then really we're not
[1:28:20] anyway right because he's just let you
[1:28:22] out here and you you get out here and
[1:28:23] you feel feel like well I'm in control
[1:28:25] of my life and and God has allowed you
[1:28:26] to be in the place you're in God has
[1:28:28] allowed you to do what you're doing amen
[1:28:30] but if you'll Surrender Your Life to God
[1:28:32] then you're no longer in control of your
[1:28:33] life but you're following after the
[1:28:35] voice that is on the inside of you and
[1:28:37] he is leading you and he's guiding you
[1:28:39] and he is making your faith come into
[1:28:41] action and your faith is no longer dead
[1:28:44] but it is a living faith in the believer
[1:28:46] that will live out the word of God in
[1:28:48] this
[1:28:51] generation I am almost done
[1:28:54] brother bam said John the Baptist
[1:28:56] expressed his faith by his works and
[1:28:58] when he said there stands among you now
[1:29:00] just think of that John said he said he
[1:29:03] said he said the Messiah is coming they
[1:29:05] they asked John you said the Messiah is
[1:29:06] coming why he said man what's the matter
[1:29:08] with you we've been looking for him for
[1:29:09] 4,000 years and he said he's standing
[1:29:12] right among you now and he said so is he
[1:29:17] tonight he expressed his faith by his
[1:29:20] revelation we heard that this morning
[1:29:22] faith is a revelation faith is something
[1:29:25] more than just an idea but it is a
[1:29:28] revelation from God and the Revelation
[1:29:30] must come from the word of God thank you
[1:29:33] Lord and so if brother B said if your
[1:29:34] Revelation outside the word he said it
[1:29:36] might sound pretty good but it's not
[1:29:38] it's not right and so if your Revelation
[1:29:40] come from God it is the word of God and
[1:29:42] that's something you can put Faith in
[1:29:44] and your faith will then act out that
[1:29:46] you really believe it can you say amen
[1:29:48] and he said he was a man 30 years old he
[1:29:50] know he had to be somewhere he had never
[1:29:52] knew that he who was who he was and
[1:29:54] there he was standing right among them
[1:29:56] and he said there's one standing among
[1:29:57] you now who you know not I'm not worthy
[1:29:59] to loose the latches on his shoes but
[1:30:01] he'll baptize you with the Holy Ghost
[1:30:03] and he's right among you now he
[1:30:05] expressed it his faith because he knowed
[1:30:07] that in his day he was to see and
[1:30:10] baptize God's Messiah he said so you see
[1:30:13] the people could see the expression upon
[1:30:15] him in the way he was preaching and the
[1:30:18] way he was acting was expressing that he
[1:30:20] had a true Revelation from God Amen so
[1:30:23] John couldn't just stand there waiting
[1:30:25] on it to happen but he had to express
[1:30:27] what he knew was going to happen and
[1:30:29] then it would happen because God will
[1:30:32] back up his word can you say amen Amen
[1:30:34] brother Brandon we go on down he said
[1:30:36] are you catching it he said he believed
[1:30:38] what he heard and now it was being made
[1:30:40] manifest the promise he held on to was
[1:30:43] now happening and so I want to say to
[1:30:46] you tonight the promise that you're
[1:30:48] looking for is already happening in your
[1:30:50] life but you need a positive confession
[1:30:53] that what God is promised he is able
[1:30:55] sister Patty's able to perform it amen
[1:30:57] everything you have need of God is more
[1:31:00] than able God is big enough for every
[1:31:03] situation God is still the Healer over
[1:31:06] those sick bodies God is still the
[1:31:08] Savior over the Lost Children God is
[1:31:11] still God and he changes not so what we
[1:31:13] need to recognize tonight the faith is
[1:31:16] there let's put the faith in action let
[1:31:18] it not be a dead Faith but let the faith
[1:31:21] live out through me amen I think that
[1:31:23] ought to be our prayer tonight tonight
[1:31:24] let the faith that is already in me be
[1:31:27] expressed in me can you say Amen am in
[1:31:31] closing I'll say this in closing three
[1:31:35] or four times ago I said something else
[1:31:36] but in closing this time for real I'll
[1:31:38] say
[1:31:40] this he said job know that he had done
[1:31:43] Jehovah's bidding and he had faith in
[1:31:45] what he done because Jehovah required it
[1:31:47] we can just do that Jehovah required a
[1:31:49] burnt offering for his sin and job not
[1:31:51] only for himself but for his children
[1:31:53] had made a burn offering and that's all
[1:31:55] God required you say oh might say I wish
[1:31:58] that's all he required today he said
[1:31:59] it's less than
[1:32:01] that can the church say
[1:32:04] amen back then they had to they had to
[1:32:06] they they did have to do things to be
[1:32:09] saved today you just have to have
[1:32:11] obedience to the word just to surrender
[1:32:14] so it's different today and he said now
[1:32:16] you might say I wish that's all required
[1:32:17] he said it's less than that just faith
[1:32:20] in his
[1:32:22] Worden and he said if you make his word
[1:32:26] your absolute any Divine promise in the
[1:32:29] Bible you can tie your soul to
[1:32:33] it thank you Jes I think that's what we
[1:32:35] need tonight church quit making
[1:32:37] everything else the ultimate and let's
[1:32:40] let the word of God be our ultimate put
[1:32:42] Faith in the word and then we'll start
[1:32:44] acting out what the word says to
[1:32:46] do brother brandom said he said now no
[1:32:49] matter how much the waves whip you
[1:32:52] around you're still tied to your
[1:32:55] absolute thank you Lord so tonight I
[1:32:58] want you to notice just in closing as
[1:33:00] musicians come faith is what God
[1:33:04] sees you may not even be able to see
[1:33:06] somebody else's faith we can look at
[1:33:09] people and and and judge their faith
[1:33:11] because we think well they're not
[1:33:12] getting healing or they're not getting
[1:33:13] saved or their children are backslid or
[1:33:16] well that doesn't that doesn't matter in
[1:33:17] the eyes of God because God knows your
[1:33:20] faith God knows
[1:33:22] exactly what you believe
[1:33:26] and no matter how much the waves would
[1:33:29] whip you around and toss you this way
[1:33:31] and toss you that way amen you've got to
[1:33:34] believe that he is still
[1:33:37] God but the works that we do will bear
[1:33:42] witness of the faith in our hearts amen
[1:33:45] I believe that with all my hearts can we
[1:33:46] stand together tonight I hope there was
[1:33:48] something said that was a help to
[1:33:49] you I know it's simple good if get a
[1:33:53] chance go read that whole chapter James
[1:33:56] chapter 2 read the whole thing faith
[1:33:58] without works is dead we're not saved by
[1:34:01] our works but there will be Works behind
[1:34:02] our faith do you believe it tonight I
[1:34:05] wonder if we could wonder if we could
[1:34:07] just just play something if you would
[1:34:10] and I believe God is here if you have a
[1:34:12] need tonight you say I need my faith
[1:34:15] raised I just need another touch or I
[1:34:18] just need you know sometimes we just get
[1:34:20] cold on God because we don't recognize
[1:34:21] our faith
[1:34:24] our young people sometimes don't know
[1:34:25] how much Faith they've got because
[1:34:26] they've never had to put it into action
[1:34:28] maybe like a person that's been through
[1:34:29] some
[1:34:30] trials and maybe you've had a you say
[1:34:33] well I've never had an easy life but
[1:34:34] maybe some of you have had a pretty
[1:34:35] pretty easy life and you've got by
[1:34:37] pretty good
[1:34:38] and you probably not very many people
[1:34:41] but somebody might have had an easy
[1:34:43] Road and maybe you haven't had to use
[1:34:45] your
[1:34:47] faith and then there's other people who
[1:34:49] it seems like everyday is you got to
[1:34:51] hold on by faith
[1:34:53] for everything work
[1:34:57] job your house your finances everything
[1:35:00] you know what just all maybe the devil's
[1:35:02] really hit some people he hits with in
[1:35:05] in bad health and some people he hits
[1:35:06] financially and some people it's your
[1:35:08] children some people it's the
[1:35:11] church but remember God is more than
[1:35:14] able can somebody say
[1:35:16] Amen is he able to take care of your
[1:35:19] situation he's not only able but he's
[1:35:21] more than
[1:35:22] able he's not only able but he cares
[1:35:25] about every situation you're in every
[1:35:28] heartache that you go through every
[1:35:31] trial every
[1:35:33] Temptation he knows all about it and if
[1:35:36] he cares for the sparrow and he gives a
[1:35:40] little fish as the song says just a
[1:35:43] little place to
[1:35:44] swim how much more does he care for you
[1:35:48] and me how much more does he care for
[1:35:50] your
[1:35:51] situation tonight it's not a lack of
[1:35:53] faith but it's a lack of action to your
[1:35:55] faith I say put your faith in action
[1:35:57] tonight use the faith that you've got
[1:36:00] that got you here to go further and let
[1:36:03] us bow our heads tonight if you have a

[1:36:25] Believers here tonight Lord I pray you
[1:36:27] would just help us to not not bypass

[1:36:37] need healing Lord or when we need an
[1:36:38] altar to Lord maybe we just need another
[1:36:40] touch from you help us to step on out on

[1:45:09] children he's worthy of your praise if

[1:45:35] you'll praise him he loves to be praised
[1:45:37] and worshiped and he'll show up in your
[1:45:39] situation tonight I think we ought to
[1:45:41] just let the chains fall off and worship
[1:45:43] him here tonight brother Joel are you
[1:45:45] trying to work us up no I believe he's
[1:45:47] worthy and we ought to participate in
[1:45:49] worshiping a God who is so good to us
[1:45:53] he's worthy of his of all the praise
[1:45:55] he's
[1:45:56] worthy if he's worthy then we ought to
[1:46:00] praise him like he's worthy we ought to
[1:46:02] act like he's worthy he's
[1:46:05] worthy a prophet wasn't
[1:46:08] worthy a prophet wasn't worthy a
[1:46:11] preacher ain't worthy but he's worthy
[1:46:14] he's worthy and if he's worthy church
[1:46:18] then you you say well that I believe
[1:46:20] that the spirit of leoty has crept into
[1:46:22] our services to where we can't worship
[1:46:24] him like we want to and we've been hurt
[1:46:26] by somebody that was over emotional or
[1:46:28] fanatical I say it's not heresy to
[1:46:30] worship God but in that way is the way
[1:46:33] we will worship God you can call us
[1:46:36] crazy you can call us Pentecostal you
[1:46:38] can call us whatever you want to but I
[1:46:40] want you to know something when he calls
[1:46:42] us on that Resurrection morning we're
[1:46:44] going to be gone we're going to be
[1:46:46] changed he's worthy for giving us that
[1:46:49] promise he's worthy of it we we ought to
[1:46:53] just take a I tell you what we ought to
[1:46:54] just take a break right now and just
[1:46:56] worship Him you say I got to get home is
[1:46:59] he
[1:47:00] Worthy is he
[1:47:02] worthy did he bring you back sister
[1:47:04] Stephanie he's worthy brother Harold if
[1:47:06] you're here even though you were
[1:47:08] diagnosed with lukemia a year ago you're
[1:47:10] here he's worthy he's worthy Brother
[1:47:13] David you almost died during Co but
[1:47:15] you're here he's worthy he's
[1:47:19] worthy you Lord you know the devil gets
[1:47:22] enough Glory out in the world I think we
[1:47:23] ought to give some glory to God in the
[1:47:25] house of
[1:47:28] God I just feel this on my heart because
[1:47:31] I believe that we might as well go ahead
[1:47:33] we might as well just go ahead and
[1:47:34] worship God because you know we can
[1:47:37] worship a lot of things we can get
[1:47:40] excited over a ball game we can get
[1:47:42] excited over a lot of things we can get
[1:47:44] excited over over over over a million
[1:47:46] things you can name him off and you get
[1:47:48] excited all down through the week over
[1:47:49] them and they're good things to be
[1:47:50] excited about but is he Worthy and if
[1:47:53] he's worthy he ought to get all of our
[1:47:55] praise and all of our Glory it belongs
[1:47:58] to him you know sometimes we get scared
[1:48:01] because the person next to us you think
[1:48:03] well they're going to judge me for
[1:48:05] shouting they're going to judge me for
[1:48:06] clapping my hands listen we're not doing
[1:48:08] it for the person next to you he's
[1:48:11] worthy the person next to you I don't
[1:48:13] care if they like it or not is he worthy
[1:48:16] sometimes we just need to lift our
[1:48:17] voices and say thank you Jesus for the
[1:48:20] grace that you've given me thank thank
