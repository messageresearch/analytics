here I believe it's one and n it start God is faithful okay all right amen First Corinthians uh 1 and N for God is faithful by whom you were called unto the fellowship of his son Jesus Christ Our Lord if we could we'll speak on a a subject tonight inspired by the divine and divine Fellowship amen you can be seated here this evening that Word Fellowship there is a is communion it's communication it's a joint precipitation precipitation and so it it's a it's a back and forth it's not just just one way and so if I've got a relationship with my wife it's not just one way it's not just just her or it's not just me but we have a a communion we have a communication a fellowship there and so brother brandham says here in the basis of Fellowship he he says Fellowship that's what we need God's way of Fellowship there's only one way God provided the way of Fellowship we cannot educate ourselves into it we cannot dress ourselves into it you cannot denominate yourself into it you've got to be born into it through the blood of Jesus Christ and it takes you into a Divine Fellowship is is that what we want here this evening amen we want not for it just to be one way but but we want God to speak to us and that's what our relationship is I I want to hear the voice of the spirit of God I want to hear him speaking uh back to me and I he wants to hear us speaking to him so it's a two-way uh Fellowship this Divine fellowship and you can only have that by the Holy Ghost being born again through it by the blood of Jesus Christ come on second Peter 1 and one and we read these scriptures the last time we we dealt with this subject and we'll just kind of pick up here if that's okay Pimon Peter a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like Precious Faith with us through the righteousness I like this through the righteousness of God and our savior Jes Jesus Christ amen we didn't just come come by on happen stance but it was through the righteousness of the blood it was through the righteousness of the holy spirit that we've gained access that we have this Fellowship here this evening that we can come and we can Fellowship around the Divine inspired word of God oh yeah that we can come and partake amen of the divine power of God here this evening and it goes on Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and Jesus our lord according I love this according as his divine power has given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us unto glory and virtue you've been called to glory in virtue here in this hour you've been called to stand as the stars of Heaven they stand there unmovable uh the Earth is out of culture things have out of are out of culture but the bride amen amen we are identified with the Stars amen and we are there as seed as seeds of Abraham as Sons and Daughters of God identified there in the heaven Amen to Stand Here amen he has called us into glory and virtue right good whereby are you given whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature thank you Lord having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and there's only there's only one way brother brand will tell us there's only one way provided by God for anything there's only one way provided by God for fellowship and his Divine word declares his thoughts towards you and I and his first decision is always the right decision can you say Amen here tonight God has a divine order and how he does things and brother Brandon would tell us in the uh in the message uh the bridegroom and the Heavenly bridegroom home of the the Earthly bride he said God is a is a Divine architect he's a Divine architect he's a Divine designer and God has a divine order amen for his children amen he has a perfect will that he wants his children to walk him and in him is all Divine love can you say Amen tonight in him is all Divine Gra am man God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever should believe in him shall not perish but shall have everlasting life amen God amen amen Christ was the very Heart Of God projected to you and I brother R said I thought that maybe God and Christ was two different uh beings or or so on or he said I thought that that God God hated me and Christ s me he said I come to find out they're the self-same person Christ is the very expression of the love of God Amen projected to you and I and God so loved us amen that he projected this Divine love that would pick us up and Inspire us to believe in him Inspire us to love him thank you Lord yes in him is all Divine love and Grace Grace enough to pick me up Grace enough to pick you up from what we were and so he is not the author of confusion God is not the author of hatred and Malice and bitterness Strife God is not the author of of misunderstandings and we'll have many misunderstandings we'll we'll we'll misunderstand one another we'll we'll think this about one another but in God there is no misunderstandings Satan is the author of that that's right and so don't let a misunderstanding go too far all right is what is what we can say here tonight amen let's come back let let's not let's Satan be the author of our lives but let God's Divine love be the author of Our Lives all right wonderful wonderful I raise my hand I didn't say Amen there we got something else going on here we're working on Amen in his purpose Satan's purpose is all through confusion misunderstandings and his purpose from from the beginning was to cause separation and disfellowship between the Creator and his subjects he started in heaven he he pulled away a third of the Angels because he wanted a better Kingdom he wanted to be worshiped like the most high so he he caused Division and so that's the very spirit and nature of Satan himself to try to cause this fellowship and so we are his we are his subjects here this evening and he would love to try to cause division Among Us he would try to love uh he would love to try to cause division among different churches and different things amen but let's not let's not be inspired by that but let's be inspired by God in this hour can you say amen amen he wants to cause disfellowship even to those that have obtained a like Precious faith and so we've looked at this before we looked there at that word obtained and that word obtained is there is to receive by Divine allotment so God is inspired amen it has been inspired by this Divine allotment this obtainment by this faith is not by chance or or guesswork but through the knowledge of the mind of God the Divine architect than you the Divine architect to be an expression you and I to be an expression of his Divine qualities and characteristics that's what God had in his mind the back part of his mind amen he had a he had a plan he had something that he was going to do amen and you were in that back part of his mind to be an expression yeah very good thank you so that's God's Divine allotment to receive in this hour God's alloted word and the blessing for our day to be attributes of his sinking to be made partakers of his divine nature oh my Revelations 13 it says your names are written it says that your names are written on the Lamb's Book of Life slain from the foundation of the world so God God has something that he he desired amen he's the grand architect he's the grand designer and a designer and an architect they've got to have an idea of what they're doing they got to have something amen some kind of thought that they're going to bring forth amen and from the foundation you are in God's mind from the foundation amen you're not here by chance you're not by here just just by by whatever on a WI amen but it's by God's Divine allotment that you're here thank you Lord in this hour good yes you love the Lord tonight and so in Revelations 13 it says our names are written on the Lamb's Book of Life slain from the foundation of the world so from the foundation of the world God had in his mind this Lamb slain and only those whose names are written on this book will fully overcome that anac cross spirit and there he fights in the Book of Revelation if you read that he he fights us to the very end he F he he has fought from the beginning and he will fight to the very end even though the devil knows that he's whooped come on and preach with me tonight even though he's whooped he still fights and he still fights on just the same even though he's defeated the devil just don't know when to when to give up but the Bible says they shall overcome him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony yes sir thank you Lord takes the blood in this hour it takes it takes the word upon your lips thank you Lord Brother ROM says here just think of every one of you in here today that's got your name on the Lamb's Book of Life you never put it there and your preacher never put it there neither your church put it there but God put it there and when did he do it it's written in the blood of the Lamb he said how many believes that there isn't enough incover or whatever it is in the world to get that out of there look God puts your name on that book of life from the foundation of the world the Bible says we're just nothing right so it's God doing it God the the great designer the Divine designer the Divine architect am man has something that he's trying to do amen and he had you in his mind from the foundation you Lord you never had nothing to do with it I never had nothing to do with it God himself did it at the foundation of the world when he slew the lamb oh yeah and he says by for knowledge he knew that Christ would be here and he was called the Lamb of God slain from the foundation and the Beast will deceive all that dwells upon the Earth and whose names are not written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world so you think here well that sounds man sounds pretty easy sounds like I got it everything's all planned out I you know I I'm so predestinated that you know everything's just going to work out and it will work out as as God has planned and God says you know that all things work for our good all everything works together for the good to them that love God and so our life has been predetermined but to obtain the promises of God in every age there's always been a fight for God's children amen Satan is not going to let it come just that easy but you've got to have faith you've got to believe you've got to endure you've got to be inspired in this hour there's got to be something driving you something amen motivating you from above yes sir good we've got to have faith we've got to believe it's not he that starts but he that endures to the end on and all hell all hell is against you listen to me young people all hell is against you all hell is against you everything that de the devil's got everything that the devil's got it's coming against you but I want to say here this evening if all hell is against you all Heaven is for me everything that God Amen everything that God's going to give to his church he's given to his church amen amen we just got to take it up as Sons and Daughters of God Amen and overcome the enemy thank you Lord all hell is against you but all Heaven is for you and so Satan will do all that he can to disrupt or keep us from Divine Fellowship he disrupted Adam and Eve in the beginning right he got Eve out of her position yeah come on look and see what they fell from here in Fellowship by Redemption he says now in the beginning when God made the man to worship Him and live God taking care of him and fed him and man had a perfect fellowship with God and there was nothing wrong God came down in the in the evening and talked to Adam and Eve he said what a beautiful picture no harm nothing could could harm them no sickness could ever come to them they didn't even know what sickness was they didn't they didn't know what old age was they didn't know uh what it was to have an an old person get together they didn't know nothing about that they didn't know what old age was they didn't know what hurt was they'd never been hurt they couldn't be hurt they was in the presence of the omnipotent powers of God which held them in control and guided them by a spirit there was nothing that could harm them oh what a beautiful picture we have there of a of a perfect Fellowship ship of a Divine Fellowship on oh my and brother Bram says now in the beginning when God come down in the evening and talked to Adam and Eve in the cool of the day oh his great voice whispered to them and they had fellowship and loved one another and he says here all this little group of Believers could every one time lay aside every thought and get down to the fact and know that the great Jehovah God that create that created you in the beginning is in his position he's in his position his place today here in this Tabernacle at the heart of every believer amen if we could just understand that he's here that he's here wanting to fellowship with you and I he's standing here in his position the great holy spirit amen he said I'll never leave you nor forsake you but I'll be with you even in you he said wherever two or three are gathered in my name there I'll be in the midst he wants our fellowship here this evening he wants your worship amen he wants a response back a he wants communication come on from us and oh god oh how God has communicated to us in this day amen he sent us his voice he sent us the voice of God in this hour the voice of the seventh angel amen the the voice of Malachi 4 and he said amen amen this this Prophet Elijah will do two things amen he'll fulfill Revelations 10 1-7 amen he'll be that voice amen the the voice of Malachi 4 Amen to turn the hearts of the children back to the the faith of the fathers amen and he said it's these divinely revealed truths that literally turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers oh how God has communicated to us in this hour amen the least we can do is give him an amen every now and then the least we can do is give him a little bit of worship and say thank you Lord for giving me the revealed word of the hour yes sir thank you Lord for turning my heart that's TR by these divinely revealed truths thank you Lord amen yes sir it's good preach he wants Fellowship here this evening amen thank you we read on here Adam and Eve he said here in the cool of the day the great voice whispered to him they had fellowship and they loved one another he said how moving how the moving of the spirit went through the bushes the Lions came up the tires and all them worship they worshiped the Lord man was conscious at all times that his presence was with him oh my think about that for a minute they come together with a lions the Tigers and the Bears they got along with the Lions and the Tigers and the Bears and sometimes messes church we come together we can't we can't get along for two or three days bu but if we'll be aware of the presence of God if we'll be aware of the presence of God how he wants to come down and and whisper sweet nothings to us how he wants to come down amen and express himself to us well we've got to get in that place amen where Satan is not the author of uh and bringing confusion and Malice and misunderstandings but we've got to come to a place of perfect peace and perfect understanding with one another I don't know why I'm going there come on but this is what we fell from a perfect fellowship and so one time man had that and it was God's purpose to have this Perfection and even though in this life we have troubles we have troubles in this life we deal with heartaches and hurt and sicknesses there's a longing in man a longing and a craving in our hearts for that kind of fellowship and I believe that if something has been lost God's purpose through Christ is to restore that back to his children what Satan has disrupted God makes a way back what Satan is disrupting in your life the trouble that he caused you the things you didn't even ask for and maybe you did ask for those things you know we're we're Our Own Worst Enemy I'm My Own Worst Enemy may maybe we did bring those things upon ourselves amen but God Amen is here to restore amen amen whatever wrongs whatever hurt has happened to you amen God has made a way back through Jesus Christ amen that everything you lost everything the devil took from from you can be restored yes sir thank you there's a longing and a craving in our hearts for that Fellowship yes amen absolutely but it takes the blood it took the blood to bring us back it took the blood to bring us back and that that's what that's what we needed that's what Adam and Eve needed that's what they needed after the fall amen God Amen God there provided a way back for them he says here in Fellowship he says God wants us all one body one body of Believers baptized in the Holy Spirit he said oh my God laid out one mat to meet the people on and that was the welcome mat from the once Fallen Fellowship the restoration back is the blood through the blood you have Fellowship restoration to to The Fellowship Of God Adam Adam couldn't meet God with the Fig leaves he couldn't meet him with his own theology but it took God to make a way back young people you can't find your own way to God God's already made a way for you to come back amen there's a welcome back there's a welcome M for every one of us here tonight every son and daughter of God that was in the mind of God there's a welcome act there's a way back tonight for Fellowship Amen in the spirit of God there's a way back to fellowship amen where Divine Healing is Among Us amen where the the the power of God the divine power of God is Fallen Among Us yes amen and I don't I don't just want it we don't just want it among us but we want it in US amen I don't just want to walk with God I want God to walk inside of me I want him to live inside of me and that's what the blood provided for you and I in this hour oh Lord Brother David told me I need to walk around I preach better down there it's his his fault tonight but I jump down there too much you love the Lord tonight yes I got so much here I'm so sorry he says here again he says now there surely some way back on some basis that we can come back to God he said God introduced in the beginning not through joining church not membership but through the shedding of the blood brought man back into Fellowship God laid out the welcome at home to every T in the beginning in the garden through the shed blood of an innocent one he says here oh oh There the that that lamb he said it was a shadow that that land that that Adam had that those old Patriarchs had that was a shadow of the of the Lord Jesus of the coming of the Lord Jesus that we would really come back to a real pure Divine Fellowship again with the father he said what a wonderful plan amen that was the Welcome Matt laid at the door amen there's a welcome back there's a welcome M if I could preach tonight if I could talk the blood has always been the way back it's what God required something spotless and pure a spotless lamb and man it took a life for a life and that old sacrifice it only covered up what had been done amen it was only a shadow of what was to come but the perfect sacrifice it not only covers up what had been done but it annihilates what has been done it wipes it off the map amen it puts it back on the accuser amen there's a way back tonight amen for for everything you've done for every wrong Amen to be annihilated not just to be covered up but to be annihilated thank you Lord do you love the Lord tonight amen amen thank you Lord there's a way back amen that blood annihilates sin and so the disruptor the tempter's powers are broken the disruptor the one that would cause this Fellowship his powers have been broken by the manifestation of the power of the redeeming blood amen the hold that he had on us by our sin nature that is broken by the blood of Jesus Christ it's been broken amen by the power of the created blood amen and that blood that blood redeems us back to that Fellowship it redeems us back to the fellowship amen of everything that Adam lost it redeems you from everything that the devil put on you yes that's true oh thank you Lord what a powerful blood it is 1 Peter 1:18 for as much as you know you were not redeemed with corruptible things as silver and gold from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers but with the precious blood of Christ as of a lamb without blemish and without spot who verily was for ordained before the foundation of the world but was manifest in these last times for you who by him do believe in God that raised him up from the dead and gave him glory that your Faith and Hope might be in God oh my what a precious blood this is amen a precious blood amen a land without spot a land without wrinkle Amen to produce a church without spot to produce a Church Without wrinkle Amen to bring Redemption to you and I and we've looked at this uh times before but that word redeemed means to a release on a receipt of Ransom to liberate by payment of Ransom to cause to be released to oneself by payment by that payment of the blood of the Lord Jesus amen to deliver from evils of every kind internal and external amen amen it didn't just do a work on our outside it don't just cover up on the outside amen but it goes on the inside and it annihilates that very that very nature that we were born with to sin oh what a powerful blood what a loosening blood that we have access tonight to good yes listen here in Divine Healing he said he provided the same lamb tonight for every
