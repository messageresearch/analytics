believe he's here to meet every need and to give you what you have need of this evening that's all the singing will do this evening God bless you if you have your Bibles let's turn to Hebrews chapter 10 Hebrews chapter 10 and verse one I won't hold you long I know it's communion and some of you have a long drive but we'll uh we'll get right on through this if you pull if you don't and I have to plow we'll be here a while so you know the drill brother Bill he's already sitting there saying that boy's a liar I just reading Minds buddy Hebrews chapter 10 and verse one for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the things can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers there unto perfect verse two for then would they not have ceased to be offered because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins more desire of sins verse three but in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year you may have your seats may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of the word this evening and if I could speak on a thought tonight it would be the worshipper once purged and just to kind of deal with Perfection many times we wonder you know are we good enough to take communion are we good enough to are we good enough to uh to even go to church are we good enough to do a lot of things and the answer is no you're not good enough but through the blood you are perfect can you say amen and brother Brandon would say it like this God requires Perfection and he said we want to bear that in mind that there is nothing just part way that can go into the presence of God it must be perfect our worship everything now in the Garden of Eden God had had Adam and Eve in the garden and they sinned and transgressed the laws of God by sinning and Disobedience and when transgression comes disobedience is the transgression of the law and the law of God him being holy just unadulterated holy therefore no spot of unholiness can ever stand in his presence can you say Amen so if sin came in the world by transgression then sin must be dealt with before the sinner can ever stand in the presence of God so you're a sinner we're all a sinner we're saved by the grace of of God but every one of us were we were born in sin we were shapen in iniquity and we came to the world speaking lies can you say Amen so if you're if you're if you're thinking about well if if I was good enough or my family was good enough or if my dad or if my mom was good enough well that's just I'm just going to tell you right now it's a lost cause because that's never going to get you anywhere it doesn't matter how good your family tree was you were still born in sin and you were still shaped in iniquity doesn't matter about your history you could be a you could be the son of a prophet or you could be the son of a great king or you could be the son of you could be you could be a great person you could have a lot of money and and those are all good things but none of that can save you none of that can actually none of that can make you good enough to stand in the presence of a holy God that was without spot or wrinkle but what can make you stand in the presence of a holy God is nothing but the blood of Jesus can you say Amen so brother Brandon would go on to say it like this he said if there is no law then there is no justice but Law requires or or Justice requires a law and he said it projects Justice and now he said no flesh is saved now by the law no flesh is saved so the law cannot save you the law was just a thing that put us in the jail cell but he said the redeeming power the law only showed us that we were Sinners and condemned us but he said that's what the law is to do it's to tell you how how you did wrong what you did wrong or how bad you are that's what the law can tell you but he said that's what the law is to do it's to bring condemnation or to show you where your mistake is but he said the law in itself self could not save amen so Jesus said I didn't come to destroy the law but I come to magnify the law he come to come to do something with it it couldn't stay just a law because you couldn't live the law I couldn't live the law but there had to be something in us or something that would come that would be able to make you be able to stand in the presence of a just God and you could not do that on your own you could not do that you could not do that by your family history as we just said but you can only do that through the redeeming power of An Almighty God that would come down and put himself on your level in the flesh of a man he was tempted like you've been tempted he was tried just like you've been tried but yet he was perfect and that he could do no sin and though you would do sin all the sins of the world were placed upon him so that you wouldn't have to go to Calvary oh come on somebody I think that ought to make a shout today that because of the blood of Christ we don't have to taste death because of the blood of Christ we don't have to worry about our future because we know who holds holds the future we know that we know that he's got it all in control we know that we don't have to worry about nothing why because he came and he died and he bled and that blood is powerful enough to hold on to every one of us when I see the blood I will pass over you so brother Rand would go on to say like this every law has a penalty and the penalty of transgressing transgressing God's law is death and I better start my timer before everybody worries about that he said now when Adam and Eve had sinned there was no way no other remedy that they could ever stand in the presence of God again except sin be dealt with can you say Amen so no man can commit a sin of any type no matter how little or no matter how big that individual sin has to be dealt with therefore he said before the one who committed it can ever stand in the presence of a holy God so he said he said every man and every woman every child is included in the penalty of death by the transgression of the head of the human race Adam he said and by his transgression every one of us fell victim to sin can you say amen and I'm going to get on down here and try to hurry through this and and I see my son out here in the aisles amening me I'll tell you what you you can join him if you want to the Bible plainly tells us that God is love but he said yet being L he has to be just so love does not mean just a thing that can be petted and played with love is the justice of God can you say amen and so when God seen that this his children had transgressed his law and that they Must Die the death then Sovereign Love Somebody say love Sovereign Love stepped in to make a way for God seen that these children must be absolutely totally annihilated from his presence and there was nothing else to be done remember Adam ran from the presence of God why because he was he didn't want to stand in the presence of a holy God being a sinner and he didn't want he didn't want to have to face up to the consequences of what he had done but what he run from the presence of God but remember God did not leave him in that condition and God come running after Adam he said Adam where art thou brother Danny when you was running from God God come after you Danny where are you you're my son I don't care what you've done but I want you to come back to me God has come after every one of us in that way no matter how bad you've been and no matter what sins you done God sent his son so that his blood could cover that sin and he come calling Mercy come calling your name Mercy Came Calling My Name the grace of God is greater than any sin that you could commit can you say Amen brother bam said it like this he said amen too all right he said there was nothing else to be done they had transgressed his law and he goes on down he said when Divine love is projected Sovereign Grace produces the object of love and and so I'd say the object of love to us was a was a man that you could call Jesus and and he was he did nothing wrong he did nothing to deserve a cross but God in in his Sovereign Grace and his Sovereign Love would would choose to let his son die so Brother David you wouldn't have to die he would choose to let him die so that I wouldn't have to die because I deserve death he never deserved it but through that then God could look at us today and say I will have a bride that is perfect without spotter Rico washed in the blood of the lamb and through the blood he looks at you as though you never did it in the first place brother the bill it is God's Sovereign Grace over your life can you say amen God is good to us God is so great that he would come down and and make himself a man and and speak to Abraham and he would come down and make himself a man so that he could he could die on a cross he was so great that he could come down and make himself a man that he could eat with his disciples and he would come down and make himself a man so that he could wash feet with the men listen he was such a great God and he made himself so low that he would become a footwash flunky why because he knew that you needed Fellowship can you say amen and brother Brandon would go on like this and you forgive me but I'm reading a lot here tonight it's out of the message Perfection and I love this message I've dealt with it before and and I I took out all the quotes I'd read before to try to not do the same thing twice but he said all through the Old Testament they offered the blood of lambs and goats and sheep and Bulls and heers of substitutionary death but all in the great economy of God there was back in his mind the real object coming so all the time God saw this thing that was happening and he and he saw the sheep and he saw the Bulls and and he saw everything that was being offered and then he would say it like this he said but I know there's coming a day when you won't have to do this this no more there's coming a perfect sacrifice because you can't live the law and God already had this in the back of his mind and and so he said he would come down and he said there was a real object that was to come and the real object that came was his only begotten son all the Lambs that died was only a shadow a shadow is only the negative side of an object and they only spoke of a Calvary coming can you say Amen so we read in Hebrews there that that the law was only having a shadow of things that were to come it was only a shadow it was only it was an imperfect thing that would happen but there was coming a perfect sacrifice and so brother Ram deals with that scripture and says the law having a shadow of things to come could never make the worshipper perfect you get the picture he said now let's go at it again you'll you you'll sure not to miss it he said God requires perfect Holiness and no one no one can stand in His image with one little speck of sin Jesus witnessed the same he said be perfect just like God in heaven is perfect and and the Bible said that the law could never with sacrifices make the the comer perfect or the worshipper perfect and he said then the law could not perfect anything it was only a pointer he said these sacrifices made every year could only make the worshipper perfect and he said could never make the worshipper perfect so therefore no one under the law or the keeping of laws or under the shadows could be perfect and he said if there is anything that I can do to make myself perfect in the presence of God then Christ did not have to die for me but he had to die for me brother Bobby because we who were low down and nobody and we could never stand in the presence of a holy God but God thought enough of us to send somebody who could stand in my place aren't you glad about it here today I tell you I think we I think we get to look at ourselves so much and we get to thinking how bad we are and yes we're a low down bunch of creatures but God in his Rich grace and mercy he saw how low down you were and that's the very reason that he sent his savior because you couldn't live the law you couldn't I tell you what nothing can die in your place nothing nothing could die for you that would ever make you perfect but a perfect Son of God could and it would make you perfect and brother brandom goes on to say this he said when Christ died he said he said he didn't die in vain he said no he said you couldn't Merit anything in the presence of God he said but then if you could Christ would die he died in vain he said no lawke keeping no legalistic idea of yours none of your own Holiness somebody say Amen none of I don't care how holy you think you are or how great you think you are none of your Holiness is going to stand in the presence of God but listen he said it like this he said now he said none of your own Holiness no things that you could quit well I quit lying I quit stealing I quit smoking tobacco none of that he said he said it's going to the Picture Show still he said steal you're lost he said but nothing can do it joining churches and ceremonies and baptisms and Orders of the church and reading of Creeds and every he said sing a prayers well come on church all these things that we do that there's good things that we do but none of them mean that you're going to be saved you've got to have more than just going to church there's got to be more than just saying a prayer there's got to be more than just saying well I pay my tithe there's got to be more than that there's got to be something on the inside of you that has accepted the worship the worship you're the worshipper something on the inside of you has had to accept that God has done a work in your life and there's got to be something that that accepts the word and when when the word said to be baptized you went and be went and got baptized IED and and then you realize that after that then you had a promise of the Holy Ghost and and you would walk in these ordinance because of the blood you didn't walk over the blood to get to the ordinances the blood on your life has caused you to sit here in a communion service at 3:00 on a Sunday afternoon the blood over your life has caused you to say Amen to the word of God the blood over your life has caused you to claim your children why because thy in thy house and under that blood under that token it is a positive token and it is something you can hold on to it is not just a tape in Jeffersonville it is not just a brandom Tabernacle in Jeffersonville it is not how many tapes you listen to or how many times you read the Bible those are good things those are great things but none of that has the atonement in it but the blood of Jesus has the atonement for every sin and every mistake and every trespass that you've ever had nothing but the blood of Jesus can you say amen he said not of one thing can you do it in yourself for you're a sinner under condemnation and there is not no way within yourself there's no Creed nothing that you could do or think of that could Merit one thing in the presence of God because you're a sinner to start with you are a sinner when you were a cute little baby held in the hospital room you were born a sinner that's hard to say when you got a cute little kid like cat when right there that they're a sinner but they're born in sin they're shaped in iniquity they come to the world's people lies before they can talk they're lying to you in the presence of God he said the Archbishop born in this world was as guilty as the lowest Barfly in the city can you say Amen one cannot atone for the other he took an innocent life of an animal a little lamb and under the Old Testament the law he said was when a man sinned he brought the lamb to the altar say if he transgressed of The Commandments he brought the lamb and he laid it on the altar he laid his hands upon the lamb and he confessed his sins that he was wrong and he know he was guilty and he said the law would require death so he brought the lamb instead and and this lamb did nothing wrong this lamb didn't deserve that this lamb didn't deserve to have his throat slit this lamb did not deserve that but what but but but the but the sinner standing there killing the lamb deserved to have the same type of death can you say amen and he said this poor little fell was trying to bleed and and and and kick and and all this to straighten out and he said then he Quivers again and he bleats and the blood gushes out and and he says it like this he said when he walked down he said he was guilty person maybe not by desire but by Nature he was guilty and he had to recognize that this innocent little lamb died in his place and he felt sorry for the little thing but the man as soon as the lamb finally died died with the blood of the Lamb upon his hands he walked from the building with the same desire in his heart why because it was an imperfect shadow of something to come it was not something that could take away his sins it could not take away his transgressions it was a temporary fix can you say Amen sometimes as as a Christian you're a young person and you come to the Altar and you feel good and it's a temporary fix but you got to go farther than that with God you've actually got to commit your life to him so so that he can change you and and make you new and and and you've got to Just Surrender everything to him why because just a temporary fix ain't good enough a temporary fix ain't going to hold you in the time we're living a temporary fix is not going to cover you but there's got to be a perfect sacrifice that has come in your time and in your day to give you he said when I see the blood I'll pass over you and without the Holy Ghost token you're never going to make it come on church you've got to remember that the Holy Ghost token is the only thing that he's going to look at and say you're sealed until the day of your Redemption you've got to have that token on display can you say amen and so brother R would go on down and I'll I'll try to get down here just as far as I can running out of time he said the blood was pouring out of this lamb and he said he said the life went from the animal and it could not back come back to the man for one was an animal and one was a man an innocent animal not a guil and to a guilty man but he said oh one day some 2,000 years ago the Lamb of God was born can you say Amen down in a little manger in Bethlehem and he said he was led like a sheep to the slaughter they didn't drive him to the Cross but he he took the cross himself and was led that way why because God knew that you needed a sacrifice and God knew that you needed a a savior and so and so God in his Sovereign Grace and Mercy looked down and he thought you know what that's a worshipper that's someone who's trying but but they can't be saved by just coming to the house of God and worshiping and they can't come and just kill a lamb every year and be save no that's just a temporary fix but he gave the ultimate sacrifice and the blood that would last forever the blood that was shed on Calvary was not just good 2,000 years ago but it's good in 2024 and it'll be good tomorrow and it'll be good at the end of the year and if the world stands another 50 years this blood will still work for you and your family can you say Amen brother Brandon would say it like this he said predes a predestinated god predestinated a church he predestinated a church to meet him Yonder without spot or wrinkle and if God required a church without spot or wrinkle he had to have something to make it that way can you say amen he could not require he said his Justice his judgments could not let him ask such a thing if there wasn't a way to make it happen and a man cannot do it in himself he's a total failure God let him see that through the law through the judges and through all the Old Testament he sent the prophets he sent the righteous man and they found that every one of them failed he said so God by his Sovereign Grace sent from the portals of Glory his only begotten son to take our place aren't you glad for it today amen remember he said he said for if if he would have said for a pope of Rome to take it he could have not done it he said if he would have said for an Archbishop of Canterbury to do it he could not have done it he said if he would have called on the most holy Reverend father a bishop of the world he could not have done it he would have been just as far rejected as judas's carot was he could not do it why a man can't do this and he said he was born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies he needed an atonement for himself but he said there came one from the portals of Glory none other than not a man not a good man not a Jew or a gentile he was nothing less than almighty God can you say amen he was hid in a human flesh and he came himself to offer his own blood for he did not come through sex and had nothing to do with it but he said he overshadowed a virgin and brought forth from a blood cell that he created and he said himself the innocent one he said my salvation and yours tonight does not hinge upon the merits of our own acts it hinges upon the positive Sovereign Grace Of An Almighty God can you say Amen it it's not our acts it's not how good we are what we're doing sitting in this service this afternoon it's not trying to be saved it's not trying to work oursel in but this today is just an act to show that we have met God and that there is a redeemer that has covered us and there is somebody who thought enough of us that he didn't want to leave us down here Sodom and gomorra but he wanted to raise us up and set together in Heavenly places can you say Amen brother Mar would go on to say it like this and he said how do we know that we get that he said when the worshiper puts his hands by faith upon the body of the Lord Jesus and feels the terror of sin and the mock of spit on his own face and feels the groanings of Gethsemane and the agonies of Calvary knows that he is guilty and confesses his sins correctly oh blessed Lord I'm guilty and I have no other way but you to help me he said by faith you're bidding the Holy Spirit has has to come and he bids come and he said I he said and I now by faith accept Jesus as my personal savior listen there's not a lot of Hoops to jump through there's not a lot of things you have to do this is not an obstacle course but he said if you'll just believe on the Son of God and if you'll just confess your faults and and just repent and and just be baptized that's all you got to do and you shall receive the very Spirit the very Life of Christ that was it is come back into the worshipper again so that you don't have to worry about where you're going you are sealed and you are ready to be delivered this is the time when there's going to be somebody leave this world and it might as well be you I say it might as well be us because why God has not left us here without a savior he has not left us here in a time when there's chaos everywhere and there's destruction everywhere but he had somebody that would rise above it all and say it doesn't matter what goes on over here it doesn't matter what goes on over there but God has called me for a time like this so that I could be raised up and and it's not my flesh that could be raised up but it is God and His Mercy that say sister Janie you might have experienced heartbreaking you might have been through all kind of things in your life but when I see the blood that death angel can never touch you in your house why because God has called you for this time he has sealed you with the Holy Ghost and it could be any one of you brother Jeff God has not called you to lose your family but God has called you and said thy and thy house shall be saved we don't worry about what they're doing right now because we know the future by the blood of Jesus Christ has already been oh come on somebody God has already he's already saw your future brother Bill and he and he said he has good thoughts of you he has thoughts of peace and not of evil and he came down he because he didn't want to leave you in this world he didn't want you to go to a sinner's grave and and and and go to hell he had to make a way of Escape for you in an hour of destruction and an hour when people would turn their backs on God and in an hour when people would look at God and mock his name and spit in his face but there would be somebody who would experience the resurrection of Jesus Christ and say mind my house as for us we are going to serve the Lord and we are going to put the blood on the doorpost and we're going to read the Bible why it's not because we're trying to get saved it's because I am saved and I'm going to show God that I love everything he did for me I'm going to show him I love that he went to Calvary for me I love that he saved my soul I love that he's got my family a promise over them I love it why because he first loved you and died for you he Lo he loved you so much why can't we just return the love to him now that's why we worship God it's not about you it's not about me it's not about listen church it's not about how you feel if you only worship when you feel good you never worship if you only praise him when you feel good you'll never praise him I tell you what I there's been some people I tell you what there's been men that have been martyred and they go down singing they go down praising I can tell you about a man that was sitting in a jail cell and he was sitting there with his life on the line and he could still sing so loud that the presence of the Lord would come along and break every chain I think sometimes we just need to go ahead and praise him in the storm that we're in praise God in the situation you're in Praise Him in the valley praise him on the Mountaintop praise God everybody here that has breath everything that has breath praise ye the Lord can you say amen God has not called us to destruction God has not called us to be cast down but God has called us to be sons and daughters in this time can you say Amen so in order to do that he had to give his life so that his life could come back on to the believer can you say Amen so the worshipper would come and the worshipper would not listen Church you won't get there just by wor worshiping but but God does inhabit the Praises of his people aren't you glad for that and so I'm thankful that when I'm praising I know that he's inhabiting he's inhabiting me I tell you because we are worshiping him not to get there that's not a work that we are trying to well Lord if I worship will you save me if I if if I worship will you you know will you come no God's already the promise to show up you're worshiping because you know he's here by faith and you're worshiping because he's already touched you you're worshiping because he's already put something in your heart that you can't deny him you can't turn your back on him God has given you the spirit of worship and true worshippers must Worship in spirit and in truth can you say Amen we're going to get on down here and and and try to get out of here on time my in-laws got a long drive after this service so I'm trying I'm trying we had been eating brother Bram tells the story you all know this story he was eating at a little dunard restaurant how many knows the story you've all heard this I love this story because there's not one I think it's any better at describing what the blood of Jesus can do for a person yeah he said such a lovely little waitress and decently dressed and clean as they could be very ladylike served us and a little spot of heaven so he so he's telling about where he was go eat and and he said uh they went on on a Sunday and they were closed up and he said uh and they went to their church and he said I got a little hungry and I was going to go preach and I'll skip on down here you know the story but he said he was going over there and he went into this place that he said just a just a little old restaurant off to the side and he said he walked in the door and there was a slot machine going and and there was a man of my age uh was married a married man he said with his arm around a woman playing a slot machine and he said the very law he said our very law the protection of our righteousness of our Goods was standing there violating a thing that was supposed to be protecting he said because it's illegal to gamble where that restaurant was in Ohio he said playing a slot machine and he said I turned and looked towards the back of the building and there was a bunch of teenage boys now I want you to just know that brother Brandon was condemning this situation brother Brandon didn't like what was going on here and it's a bad situation you would have a right to say this is not good this is not godly it's it's not holy but but but just watch where we go here he said he said there was a lady about 18 years old excuse me I'm going down here he said he said how he said he saw this person down here he said there was a a woman standing there he said uh and she was standing there with her dress hanging low in the front and one of those boys with his hands on the girl where they did not belong and he said there was smoking and drinking and he said 'I oh God how can you stand it and he said' I looked over to my right when I heard someone make out a big groan and he said there said an older woman about 60 years old aged woman about 60 or 70 years old that's not old by the way but mama said oh amen but he said those little vulgar clothes on just about halfway up her Limbs and poor little old wrinkled flesh just flabby as it could be just a bad just a bad scene if you can imagine it brother Brandon said she had her face painted her purple toenails and purple fingernails and her hair was cut real short and curled up and died blue and he said I looked over at her and across the table set two men and it was all this going on and he said God why don't you just destroy the whole thing why don't you just sink it beneath the Earth and he said I've got a little girl Sarah and Rebecca little girl Sarah and Rebecca are they going to have to grow up under such stuff as that he said how can you God and your great Holiness ever stand to look at such a thing like that and not send an earthquake and sink it this is a father speaking and you can just imagine how he feels and you don't want our little girls and our little boys to grow up in a situation like this and so he says he says I can't I don't want to see my little boy doing things that that he ought not do and maybe things like that and he said he said I seen that great black shadow go towards heaven which God would have killed me at that moment excuse me I skipped down I'm sorry he said I Ste behind the door and I seen something like whirling and he said it was in the vision it was the world turning around around and around and I noticed around the world was a Scarlet streak and around the world he said he said I got to the world I seen myself just a little boy doing things that I ought not do and maybe not not not like that but it was sin and every time I did anything I seen that great black shadow go towards heaven which God would have killed me at any minute and he said then I seen standing between me and God there was a perfect sacrifice can you say amen he said and I seen him standing there with the thorns on his head and the spit on his face and every time my sins would start towards God he would reach out and catch it like the bumper on the car and he was protecting me from death and every time I would do anything wrong God would have killed me this is a man who was told not to drink or smoke or defile his body this is a man that lived a good life this is a this is a good man this is a man who who said he never committed adultery this is a good man but he even stood there in the presence of God and realized that even his sins would deserve death and so he said he said certainly his Holiness requires it his Law requires it and every time I would do anything or or anything the blood of Jesus just acted like that bumper and he said I've seen that Scarlet streak he said and that blood still holds the Earth and he said as I stood there looking I got a little closer to him and I noticed him and I could hear him say father forgive him he doesn't know what he's doing and he said I look down and there laid a book and there was a recording Angel there Standing By My Side by his side and every time I sinned it was put down on the book and my name was on it and I realized that someday that the blood streak would be lifted and I would have to stand in the presence of God with my S sinful life but he said I seen by his Mercy he was holding off my judgment and he said I went by him humbly I knelt on my knees and I said oh Jesus thou Son of God I am unworthy to come in your presence but will you please forgive me for what I have done and he touched his side with his hand took a took the old book and wrote pardoned and he throwed it back behind him and he said my sins were gone and then he looked at me Stern in the face and he said now I have forgiven you but you want to condemn her now church I want to show you some mercy and Grace happening right here in a story from a prophet he said when I seen that what it meant he said I come out of the vision I walked over to her I said how do you do and she was drinking and she looked up at him and she talked to him and and he told her the story just a few minutes ago standing behind the door he said he began to tell her and as he began to look the tears begin to run down her cheeks and she said he said lady he said you don't mean to do those things but he said Jesus died and the judgments of God is held off by this Blood you didn't mean to do this and she said no sir my father was a deacon in the church I was raised in a Christian home my husband and I were charter members and I lived a Christian Life and she began to tell me after his death and and she told her a story and but but brother said God be merciful and those who has for knew he has called and she said are you Reverend brandom he said I am and she said I'm ashamed of myself to sitting here like this and he said do you she said do you think there would be a chance for me I tell you what I think some of us have been there do you think there would be a chance for me and and and brother Brandon would say about like this he he said he said yes he said I I said Jesus has his arm stretched out waiting for you to come lady and the other people be to take up and said would you walk out here on this floor with me and she said I will and he took her by the hand and said you're about the age of my mother would you kneel here with me on the floor and there in the floor they broke that place up with an oldfashioned meeting and God saved that woman by his grace and look look God didn't even see what she had done before that God didn't even look at the woman that was standing there 5 minutes before that then was that was doing every kind of unclean thing and was sitting there vulgar dressed and let me just go ahead and tell you something she didn't go get the nails cleaned and she didn't go grow the hair out and she didn't go change clothes to get saved she got saved and the rest of it took care of herself can you say Amen but I want you to notice that God in his ultimate infinite grace would come into a room that was filled with nothing but chaos and and and and just it was Sinners and filth and all these things and law breaking and all this and God would come into that room and speak directly to a woman that knew that she needed God and if you just know that you need God this afternoon if you know you need a savior if you know you're not good enough on your own but you say I just want what you've got for me and I I'll look at the blood and I'll never let anything come between me and the Lord there's going to be all kinds of sin in your life if you're not careful and there's going to be mistakes that you'll make as a Christian but let me just tell you one time in the presence of God and God can change every situation God can clean you up God can make you whole God can make you new why because everything you have need of is in the blood of Jesus Christ and when he sees the blood he doesn't see your sin when he sees your blood he doesn't see your mistakes when he sees your when he sees the blood everything else is clean he sees nothing but pure white on the believer can you say Amen brother bandam says I like this he says God requires Perfection he requires repentance he requires your loyalty to him but he's looking tonight no matter how much you sinned how little or how much you are still a sinner and cannot get in any other way but by Jesus Christ God's alls sufficient sacrifice can you say amen and in him you are perfected forever he said think of it it's not nothing you do it's not new pages you turn it's not new life you start heart it's a confession of your wrong and it's God's grace to you that brings you to Perfection he said then you are perfected in Jesus Christ can you say Amen my time's about up my time is up if you'd stand to your feet the musicians would come I know we've got communion this afternoon and I just want to say it like this if you have not accepted the blood of Jesus over your life today you can do that right here in this service if there's something between you and the the savior he said just repent make that thing right and the blood will cover it can you say Amen the blood of Jesus covers all your sins the blood of Jesus covers you it cleanses you from all iniquity so all you have to do today with your heads bowed I just want to take this moment before we take communion if there's something in your life that would stop you from taking communion this afternoon I wonder if You' just let the Lord know about it I believe all it takes is just just a sincere moment in the presence of God and then God can come in and and change that heart if you would just play something softly man if you have something on your your heart just put your hand up to him and just let him know about it right now just talk to him just for a moment if you would before we have this

take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had SED saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do you as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup cup you do show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged
