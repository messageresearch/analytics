[48:13] wonderful job I the church is such
[48:16] hospitality and I hear that all the time
[48:17] when we have a wedding or a festival
[48:19] like this we always open it up we it's
[48:22] for us but we try to open it up for
[48:24] people to come and the reason we do that
[48:26] is if we can be a blessing even in a
[48:28] small way even in a natural way to
[48:30] someone there were folks here yesterday
[48:31] several folks don't go to church at all
[48:34] or don't come here or don't go to a
[48:36] message church but we want to reach out
[48:38] to them too and that's one way we can do
[48:40] that so we want to continue to do that
[48:42] and I commend you for your attitude in
[48:44] that so we're going to do something a
[48:47] little bit different this morning if the
[48:48] musicians just stay here for just a
[48:49] minute but brother uh Joel
[48:53] has never been ordained as a minister so
[48:55] we're going to do that this morning and
[48:57] I think it worked out just right because
[48:59] I was supposed to do it last week and I
[49:01] forgot and because I'm just getting that
[49:04] way as I get older the older I get the
[49:06] more forgetful I get but but the Joel
[49:08] has not been ordained and come to our
[49:10] attention that brother Joshua sitting
[49:12] right there beside him has not been
[49:13] ordained either by the Joshua Kathy and
[49:16] these young men I'm so excited to see
[49:18] young men wanting to go into the
[49:20] ministry and not just wanting to but
[49:22] feeling the call of God to do that and
[49:24] and so we're thankful for that and and
[49:26] we've watched these young men's lives
[49:28] and and uh brother Joel's been here at
[49:30] the church for uh well he's been
[49:32] preaching here now for a little over a
[49:34] year and I can't say enough I teased him
[49:36] a lot but I can't say enough about the
[49:38] help there but the Joel is to me
[49:39] personally if you see us sitting here on
[49:41] the front we're in a meeting or
[49:42] something if I need something done all I
[49:44] gotta do is look at him and he knows
[49:45] usually what I want done and that what
[49:47] you can't pay for that I mean that's
[49:50] just wonderful and we've got other
[49:51] wonderful ministers as well here in the
[49:53] church and singers and we're thankful
[49:55] for that we want to do that this morning
[49:56] I want to read a scripture about that
[49:59] because we we're doing something that's
[50:01] a scriptural order and so you'll find
[50:04] you'll find Paul
[50:06] and he talks about it in Timothy and I
[50:09] actually didn't get the uh the scripture
[50:12] reference so that's not good but it's
[50:14] chapter four
[50:16] let me find it real quick
[50:18] and I told you I was getting forgetful
[50:21] but um it's first Timothy chapter four
[50:25] and uh he speaks to young men speaking
[50:28] to Timothy as a young man he said in the
[50:30] last days go to verse one if you can
[50:31] pull it up uh First Timothy chapter 4
[50:34] and verse one it says in the latter days
[50:36] some shall depart from the faith and
[50:37] give heed to seducing spirits and
[50:39] doctrines of devils and it goes on to
[50:42] talk about the the doctrines that they
[50:44] would have and he says uh in verse 6 he
[50:48] says if thou put the brethren in
[50:50] remembrance of these things thou shall
[50:52] be a good Minister that word Minister
[50:54] means servant so that's what we are as
[50:57] ministers as servants so we're ordaining
[51:00] more servants for the bride of Christ
[51:01] today we're just giving them the right
[51:03] hand to fellowship and so you'll be a
[51:07] good minister of Jesus Christ nourished
[51:09] up in the words of faith and of good
[51:10] Doctrine wherein to thou Hast detained
[51:13] he said but refuse profane and old wives
[51:16] Fables and uh exercised thyself rather
[51:19] unto godliness and then in verse 11 he
[51:22] said these things command and teach so
[51:25] he tells ministers to preach to teach
[51:27] and and then in verse 12 he said let no
[51:29] man despise thy youth but be thou an
[51:32] example of the Believers in word in
[51:34] conversation or lifestyle in charity
[51:36] that's love in spirit and faith in
[51:39] Purity he said till I come give
[51:42] attendance to reading to exhortation to
[51:44] Doctrine neglect not the gift that is in
[51:47] thee which was given thee by Prophecy
[51:48] with laying on of hands of the
[51:50] Presbytery the gift wasn't given by
[51:52] laying on of hands but the laying on of
[51:54] hands sanctioned the gift that was there
[51:56] he said meditate upon these things give
[52:00] thyselfs holy to them holy to them that
[52:03] thy profiting may appear to all take
[52:05] heed unto yourself and unto the doctrine
[52:07] continuing them for in doing this I love
[52:10] this this Thou shalt both save thyself
[52:13] and them that hear thee
[52:16] hey man
[52:18] that's good isn't it I believe we ought
[52:20] to applaud the work
[52:23] so brother Brandon taught us that gifts
[52:24] and callings are without repentance and
[52:26] he said they noticed that Timothy was a
[52:28] staunch Christian had a gift of speaking
[52:30] he said they laid hands on him as a
[52:32] recognition the Elders of the church
[52:33] laid hands upon him uh and placing the
[52:36] apostolic Ministry of laying hands on
[52:37] him that he would go to preach the
[52:38] gospel sent out by witness to these
[52:41] Brethren that they believed the gift of
[52:43] God was working in him and he said it
[52:45] was a sanction and so that's what we're
[52:46] going to do this morning Brothers if you
[52:48] would come ministering Brothers if you
[52:50] come and we'll gather here at the front
[52:51] and brother Joel and brother Joshua and
[52:54] uh we'll ask the congregation to pray
[52:56] with us and we'll just give these
[52:57] brothers the right hand to fellowship
[52:58] and believe that the Lord will will help
[53:01] them in their Ministries and my I want
[53:04] them to exceed and just be if God calls
[53:06] them as evangelists or pastors whatever
[53:08] it is to go far beyond what my
[53:10] generation I'm almost in another
[53:12] generation now but far beyond what my
[53:14] generation is able to do I want them to
[53:16] do better and and to see the bride of
[53:18] Christ come to full maturity under the
[53:20] ministries of men like these young men
[53:22] let's let's lay hands on these brothers
[53:24] and pray
[53:26] grateful today for your Mercy o God

[53:40] hands laid in our heart and sanction of
[53:42] these gifts that are within and let's
[53:43] pray God give them the right hand of the
[53:46] fellowship today I pray you'd move in
[53:48] their Ministries I pray there'd be a
[53:50] anointing come on O Lord for this moment

[58:18] then and then leave you know everybody
[58:19] gets that uh everybody gets that kind of
[58:21] sixth sense right before cleanup time
[58:24] brother Ben and says well it's about
[58:25] time to go home you know and and uh
[58:28] there's always just that that group of
[58:30] of saints that just get it taken care of
[58:33] and get everything cleaned up and and
[58:35] then get it all put out and my I
[58:37] appreciate that and so uh it takes that
[58:39] to make a church work and and uh so I I
[58:42] appreciate it when I see it and and I
[58:44] know what kind of sacrifice that is and
[58:46] and thank you is is and God bless you
[58:49] for that is my prayer so Romans the
[58:51] fifth chapter
[58:53] the first 10 verses uh we'll read
[58:59] Romans the fifth chapter the first 10
[59:02] verses therefore being justified by
[59:05] faith how are we Justified Saints
[59:08] by faith we have peace with God through
[59:11] our Lord Jesus Christ by whom we also
[59:14] have access by faith into his grace
[59:21] wherein we stand and rejoice
[59:24] in the hope
[59:25] of the glory of God I just want to stop
[59:28] here and say this the the Bible said
[59:30] here that
[59:32] that we have by faith we have access to
[59:35] his grace and that because we have
[59:37] access to his grace we Rejoice amen we
[59:42] Rejoice is that right Saints we're happy
[59:45] today amen we're happy to be a believer
[59:48] today is that is that your prayer today
[59:50] is that your is that your I'm happy you
[59:52] know sometimes we get so you know you
[59:53] just sometimes there's Believers that
[59:55] just seem to be so miserable States just
[59:58] some of the most miserable people you
[59:59] ever been around but but that's not us I
[1:00:01] don't know how you can have the hope of
[1:00:03] joy in your heart and be miserable amen
[1:00:06] we should be the happiest people in the
[1:00:08] world Amen so you know when you come
[1:00:09] into church let's smile a little bit
[1:00:11] amen let's let's uh let's let's be happy
[1:00:14] amen and so and I appreciate it I was
[1:00:17] watching yesterday and everybody at the
[1:00:18] at the Gathering just let's watch
[1:00:20] everybody interact with one another and
[1:00:21] and just the overall how happy everybody
[1:00:24] was to be there and happy to be around
[1:00:27] brothers and sisters of Life precious
[1:00:29] Faith that's the holy ghost in the
[1:00:31] church Saint Paul is that amen and so we
[1:00:34] find then that uh I can't read the
[1:00:36] scripture for preaching
[1:00:38] and not only so but we glory in
[1:00:41] Tribulation also
[1:00:44] knowing that tribulation that worketh
[1:00:46] patience let me stop again and say this
[1:00:49] you don't have an excuse because you're
[1:00:51] going through something to be irritable
[1:00:54] or mean or or have a tough thing you
[1:00:56] know you're having a tough time and
[1:00:58] you're having a bad day it don't give
[1:01:00] you an excuse to treat nobody says we
[1:01:01] glory in a tribulation also amen so
[1:01:04] whether you're having a good day or a
[1:01:06] bad day or everything's going great or
[1:01:08] everything's going wrong we still glory
[1:01:10] in it amen because it all works together
[1:01:12] for the good of those that love the Lord
[1:01:14] and so and so if we're having a bad day
[1:01:16] that's fine you'll have a bad they don't
[1:01:18] bring it into the house of God we come
[1:01:20] in here to glory amen
[1:01:23] so so you leave all of that other stuff
[1:01:26] alone and when you and you know you're
[1:01:27] having a bad day don't give your excuse
[1:01:29] to talk to your wife bad or or or talk
[1:01:32] to your kids bad or or talk to your
[1:01:34] family bad or you're having a bad day
[1:01:36] that hey we're going to have bad days
[1:01:38] but we we glory in those things Saints
[1:01:40] because they're working together for our
[1:01:42] good I still can't read the scripture
[1:01:45] for preaching
[1:01:47] and I hope and make knowledge excuse me
[1:01:49] and uh knowing the tribulation work with
[1:01:51] patients and patience experience and
[1:01:53] experience hope and hope make it not a
[1:01:55] shame because the love of God is shed
[1:01:58] abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost
[1:02:03] which is given unto us so again the Holy
[1:02:06] Ghost when you see people that are
[1:02:09] miserable in the message
[1:02:11] or you see people that are unhappy to
[1:02:13] they're just living such a a a run-down
[1:02:17] kind of Life Saints it's because of the
[1:02:19] Holy Ghost
[1:02:21] and and so so if you think about this
[1:02:24] the only way you can live this message
[1:02:25] is by the Holy Ghost so if you're trying
[1:02:28] to live a message like this without the
[1:02:30] Holy Ghost you are miserable
[1:02:32] amen because you still got desires you
[1:02:34] still got things that's bothering you
[1:02:36] you still got things pulling at you and
[1:02:37] things pulling you down and you're
[1:02:38] miserable because you know what you
[1:02:40] should be and you know what you actually
[1:02:41] are
[1:02:42] amen and it takes the Holy Ghost not
[1:02:46] that you can't live it but to live
[1:02:47] through you is that right amen so if you
[1:02:50] see people really miserable it's because
[1:02:52] they're they want to live a certain way
[1:02:53] but they know they can't
[1:02:56] but it takes the Holy Ghost to live
[1:02:58] through us all right
[1:03:00] I'm gonna get through this
[1:03:02] for when we were yet without Strength In
[1:03:05] Due Time Christ died for the ungodly
[1:03:11] for scarcely a righteous man will one
[1:03:14] die yet pre-adventure for a good man
[1:03:17] some would even Dare To Die
[1:03:20] but God commanded his love toward us and
[1:03:23] that while we were yet sinners
[1:03:26] Christ died for us
[1:03:30] much more than being now justified by
[1:03:33] his blood we shall be saved from wrath
[1:03:36] through him
[1:03:37] for if when we were enemies we were
[1:03:40] reconciled to God by the death of his
[1:03:42] son
[1:03:43] much more being reconciled we shall be
[1:03:46] saved
[1:03:47] by his life
[1:03:49] just bow our heads Heavenly Father we
[1:03:52] thank you so much for this word today
[1:03:53] Lord we thank you Lord that while we
[1:03:56] were unlovable you loved us
[1:03:58] while we were unsavable you saved us
[1:04:02] Lord you glorify yourself in US Lord
[1:04:05] although there be nothing in us to get
[1:04:08] Glory from lord it's a miracle that
[1:04:10] we're here today Lord our lives are a
[1:04:13] miracle Lord the fact that we are here
[1:04:16] today saved and filled with the Holy
[1:04:19] Ghost and believe in the message of the
[1:04:21] hour it's a miracle Lord
[1:04:23] but Lord you did it all for us we thank
[1:04:25] you for that Lord we we praise you for
[1:04:28] that Lord Jesus and Lord we just ask you
[1:04:30] that you'd watch over us this morning
[1:04:31] bless these precious Saints today Lord I
[1:04:35] ask you to help me today Lord I'm
[1:04:36] insufficient and Lord I am just a man
[1:04:39] and Lord but you have a way of moving
[1:04:42] man out of the way and speaking through
[1:04:43] I pray oh God you'd use me today Lord
[1:04:46] watch over me and bind my lips before
[1:04:48] I'd speak anything unpleasing to you and
[1:04:51] we committed into your hands in the name
[1:04:52] of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen
[1:04:56] and y'all can finally be seated
[1:04:58] and I uh I just want to talk this
[1:05:01] morning on a very simple subject I would
[1:05:03] title this the love of God
[1:05:05] the love of God a very simple subject
[1:05:08] brother George you drove six hours over
[1:05:10] here to talk to this church a mature
[1:05:13] Church a church of Believers about the
[1:05:15] love of God
[1:05:18] actually I did not I I come to talk to
[1:05:20] you about something else but this is
[1:05:21] what the lord gave me
[1:05:23] so
[1:05:25] I I've learned enough over the years to
[1:05:27] do what the Lord tells me to do amen so
[1:05:30] I feel like if if the lord gave me this
[1:05:32] to speak then I feel like someone needs
[1:05:34] to hear it this morning so I'm just
[1:05:36] trusting him and trusting his grace and
[1:05:39] his mercy and and so I'm thankful to be
[1:05:41] here with you this morning I I just want
[1:05:43] to talk just to these two little uh
[1:05:46] young Brothers over here minister
[1:05:47] brothers and I'm thankful for young men
[1:05:50] that have a desire to pack this message
[1:05:52] and and um you know it's it's a kind of
[1:05:56] a rare thing you don't see a whole lot
[1:05:58] of of Brothers it seems like entering
[1:06:00] the ministry uh these days but I'm I'm
[1:06:03] thankful to see these two brothers I
[1:06:04] know them both personally and uh
[1:06:07] although I do give them a lot of grief
[1:06:09] that's why brother Ben asked me to come
[1:06:11] in
[1:06:14] oh yeah I I do know them to be men of
[1:06:18] God and uh I I know their hearts are in
[1:06:23] the right place and that God is using
[1:06:25] them and there's definitely gift there
[1:06:27] that that God is sanctioning so I'm so
[1:06:30] so happy to have been here and been able
[1:06:32] to see that I'm turning on my timer here
[1:06:34] because I know everybody's uh had a busy
[1:06:37] day yesterday and I'm not going to be
[1:06:38] too long this morning Lord willing so
[1:06:41] um but uh I'm so thankful for that I
[1:06:43] also usually when I come over I I just
[1:06:46] make a note in my notes to say something
[1:06:48] mean about brother Joel and so uh but
[1:06:51] this morning I got a problem my
[1:06:53] son-in-law there with him I don't have
[1:06:54] to divide my time up about picking on
[1:06:56] them two brothers there but uh how many
[1:06:59] of you appreciate brother Joel I know I
[1:07:00] know we do amen
[1:07:02] a minute
[1:07:03] amen I uh I know he gets I know he gets
[1:07:07] a lot of grief and he deserves it he
[1:07:09] deserves it uh but uh certainly proud of
[1:07:12] the man he's uh he's becoming so I I I I
[1:07:15] love to see it so Romans the fifth
[1:07:17] chapter there so I find in the message
[1:07:19] Saints as I talk about the love of God
[1:07:22] uh I find in the message a lot of times
[1:07:25] people don't necessarily believe in
[1:07:28] God's love as much as they believe in
[1:07:33] God's judgment
[1:07:35] and and so people have a real tendency
[1:07:39] to when something happens to them or
[1:07:42] they get wronged in some kind of way or
[1:07:45] somebody says something about them or or
[1:07:47] they feel like they've been shunned or
[1:07:49] they feel like they've been they feel
[1:07:50] like they've been targeted in some kind
[1:07:52] of way people have a real tendency to
[1:07:55] lean into God's judgment and and wanting
[1:07:59] God to judge the the person for the for
[1:08:01] the sins that they may or may not have
[1:08:03] committed and and you know it's easy in
[1:08:05] a church to to have feelings crop up and
[1:08:09] have people to to you know start feeling
[1:08:11] a certain way and and you know we deal
[1:08:13] with complexes as Believers to where you
[1:08:16] know you don't you can have a complex
[1:08:18] Saints and you don't even really know
[1:08:20] you got a complex it just it's part of
[1:08:22] you and and you don't recognize that
[1:08:24] it's part of you and and you know
[1:08:26] sometimes you act a certain way and
[1:08:27] maybe afterwards you would ask yourself
[1:08:29] why did I act that way what what is that
[1:08:31] what caused me to do that well these are
[1:08:34] just complexes would you just people
[1:08:36] here Saints we we're just brothers and
[1:08:37] sisters that's doing the best we can to
[1:08:40] serve the Lord and so you know we find
[1:08:42] it complexes and and little things come
[1:08:44] in and and sometimes things crop up and
[1:08:47] and when they do and we feel like we're
[1:08:49] in the rights we feel like we ain't done
[1:08:51] nothing wrong we're in the right and we
[1:08:53] always feel like we're in the right
[1:08:55] ain't everybody had nobody come to me
[1:08:57] and say brother George I tell you uh uh
[1:08:59] when I said that out of spite and I was
[1:09:01] mean about it and I meant to do it
[1:09:07] everybody you know when they tell a
[1:09:09] story they always tell it from the
[1:09:11] standpoint it makes their self look good
[1:09:13] is that right brother being I'm not
[1:09:14] gonna tell it to make myself look bad
[1:09:16] I'm gonna tell you how it makes me look
[1:09:18] good and so and so you know there's
[1:09:19] always my my dad always said there's
[1:09:21] three sides to every story there was
[1:09:23] your side and my side and then it was
[1:09:25] the truth
[1:09:27] amen which is right there in the middle
[1:09:29] somewhere that and and so you know
[1:09:31] people people get these little things
[1:09:33] and we want judgments when stuff happens
[1:09:35] we want we want judgment when we see
[1:09:37] things in the message that we don't like
[1:09:39] we want judgment when we see people
[1:09:40] wrong us and do things wrong but we want
[1:09:43] Mercy when we mess up so we want
[1:09:46] judgment for everybody else but we want
[1:09:48] Mercy for ourself amen and we want we
[1:09:51] want we want God to forgive us where we
[1:09:53] fall short we want God to forgive us
[1:09:55] when we do wrong but we want him to
[1:09:57] judge everybody else when they do
[1:09:59] something wrong foreign
[1:10:05] so if we'll be honest with ourselves
[1:10:08] Saints I think as Believers a good
[1:10:11] portion of Believers feel like
[1:10:14] if you just be honest we feel like God
[1:10:17] is angry with us a lot of times
[1:10:22] [Music]
[1:10:24] we feel like that the Lord is displeased
[1:10:26] with us a lot of times and our overall
[1:10:28] concept of God is that he is displeased
[1:10:32] with us
[1:10:33] and that's because of how we are with
[1:10:36] our nature we're fighting through this
[1:10:38] sinful nature that we were born into you
[1:10:40] know and we we have struggles and we
[1:10:42] have you know bad thoughts and we have
[1:10:44] things come across our mind that we know
[1:10:46] we shouldn't have and we have tests that
[1:10:48] we know we should be able to pass and
[1:10:50] sometimes we do sometimes we don't and
[1:10:52] when we don't we feel like the Lord is
[1:10:54] angry with us Brother David we feel like
[1:10:56] God is going he's angry with us and and
[1:10:58] so then when bad things happen to us we
[1:11:00] feel like we deserve it because it's God
[1:11:03] trying to punish us for our actions come
[1:11:06] on somebody
[1:11:09] and we feel like we deserve to be
[1:11:12] treated uh badly by the Lord but but
[1:11:14] brothers and sisters don't don't don't
[1:11:16] feel that way Saints but look brother
[1:11:18] Branham went through that brother Brown
[1:11:20] said and I got the quote there he said
[1:11:22] look how I feel like I feel I always
[1:11:24] thought that God was angry with him that
[1:11:27] Christ loved me and God was angry with
[1:11:29] me but Christ loved me he said but I
[1:11:30] find out that Christ was the very heart
[1:11:33] of God
[1:11:34] amen
[1:11:35] amen God loved you that's why he gave us
[1:11:38] Christ Amen in the very heart of God and
[1:11:42] so and so we find then that that God you
[1:11:45] know what when you say oh I bet if the
[1:11:47] Lord's disappointed maybe he is I bet
[1:11:49] he's angry women for my faults and
[1:11:51] failures I bet he's disgusted with me
[1:11:53] for how short I live of the glory of God
[1:11:55] or enraged that I live so far below my
[1:11:58] privileges Saints I'm here to tell you
[1:12:00] that God loves us
[1:12:01] [Music]
[1:12:03] amen and he's not a God that that
[1:12:05] punishes us like we deserve
[1:12:10] he's full of grace and mercy now I'm not
[1:12:13] trying to I'm not trying to be a Baptist
[1:12:15] church this morning come on hey man we
[1:12:18] gotta live a life right I mean you know
[1:12:19] if you're so you're going to reap or
[1:12:21] those things all are it's not just a
[1:12:22] free-for-all here
[1:12:24] amen but I think because we try to live
[1:12:27] so close to God that the devil tries to
[1:12:30] use that against us and make us think
[1:12:31] we're never going to measure up
[1:12:36] come on
[1:12:39] amen and we feel like that we deserve
[1:12:41] bad things to happen to us now I'm just
[1:12:43] I'm just trying to speak to you this
[1:12:45] morning I I I'm just trying to be honest
[1:12:47] now we might you might not ever you
[1:12:49] might not ever uh admit that you know
[1:12:51] I'm not saying you would but but if
[1:12:52] something bad happened to you say well I
[1:12:53] deserve that yeah sure is that right
[1:12:57] that's just the Lord's way
[1:12:59] punishing me for what I've done and how
[1:13:01] I've been
[1:13:02] yeah amen
[1:13:05] now brother Brown says this he said if
[1:13:07] you ever notice how that when disaster
[1:13:09] struck job's home and the children was
[1:13:12] all killed and everything and all job
[1:13:14] had was destroyed God wasn't rebuking
[1:13:17] job
[1:13:21] he only purged he was only purging job
[1:13:25] all right
[1:13:27] amen he was the only purging Joe brother
[1:13:30] Branham said amen he says I like that
[1:13:33] word a purge
[1:13:35] the branch that bears fruit then God
[1:13:37] purges it it'll bring forth more fruits
[1:13:41] [Music]
[1:13:45] the trouble of it is we think sometimes
[1:13:47] God is angry with us
[1:13:49] but he's only trying to purge us that
[1:13:52] will bring abundance of fruits giving us
[1:13:55] a few trials the Bible said that they're
[1:13:58] worth more to you than precious gold so
[1:14:02] so Brothers said that God isn't angry
[1:14:04] with you God is purging you
[1:14:08] he said we feel like God is angry with
[1:14:10] us but these trials he said if you if
[1:14:13] you if you take all the fruit off the
[1:14:15] branch it'll bring forth more fruits
[1:14:17] because it's been purged amen
[1:14:22] it's your
[1:14:24] amen
[1:14:27] so we find then that Michelangelo you
[1:14:31] know brother Bram talks about that
[1:14:32] sculpture of Moses that he made
[1:14:34] it and he made the sculpture of David I
[1:14:37] believe and several other sculptures and
[1:14:38] and they asked him they said Mike I
[1:14:40] think it was with I think it was with
[1:14:41] Moses they asked Michelangelo they said
[1:14:44] how in the world did you ever take that
[1:14:46] raw slab of marble and and make a statue
[1:14:50] of Moses out of it and Michelangelo's
[1:14:52] answer was very simple he said he said I
[1:14:55] simply chipped away everything in that
[1:14:59] slab of marble that wasn't Moses
[1:15:03] come on yeah
[1:15:09] and so when we see these trials and
[1:15:11] tests it's not the judgments of God or
[1:15:13] God being angry with us because of how
[1:15:15] bad we live and how bad we are it's it's
[1:15:17] God chipping away everything from us
[1:15:20] that's not a message believer
[1:15:23] it's God chipping away everything that's
[1:15:25] not the statue of a perfect man
[1:15:28] amen amen so when bad things come you
[1:15:30] say thank you Lord for chipping away
[1:15:33] amen and with glory in our infirmities
[1:15:36] and glory in our tribulation because
[1:15:38] he's chipping it away one piece at a
[1:15:41] time amen
[1:15:43] it's God working on us
[1:15:46] God is God working through our lives
[1:15:48] when when things happen look I'm not
[1:15:50] saying the devil didn't cause it but
[1:15:51] that God had to allow it
[1:15:54] amen and so all things work together for
[1:15:58] the good of those that love the Lord
[1:16:00] amen and one thing I do know I'm not
[1:16:03] what I should be but I know I love the
[1:16:05] Lord today
[1:16:08] now nobody can make me doubt I love the
[1:16:11] Lord
[1:16:12] amen so if I love the Lord if you love
[1:16:15] the Lord all things work together
[1:16:20] amen
[1:16:21] and so we find in that what we do as
[1:16:24] Believers instead of going to the source
[1:16:27] and and getting help and counsel what we
[1:16:29] try to do is we try to do things when we
[1:16:32] when we feel like we're falling shorts
[1:16:34] we try to do things that we feel like
[1:16:37] will make the Lord happy yes
[1:16:40] because we feel like he's angry with us
[1:16:42] oh the Lord's angry with me so ah Lord
[1:16:45] I'm sorry I know I'm terrible I know I'm
[1:16:47] a terrible person that's the kind of
[1:16:50] self-talk we give amen that's the kind
[1:16:52] of self-talk we give and we need some
[1:16:54] self-help novels sometime or something
[1:16:56] maybe but but we give that kind of
[1:16:58] negative self-talk let your testimony be
[1:17:00] positive Saints but but we get that
[1:17:02] negative self-talk where we're talking
[1:17:04] we're always talking about how bad we
[1:17:06] are
[1:17:07] and so then to make up for that we try
[1:17:10] to make up for it by by trying to do
[1:17:12] some extra works of some sort and we say
[1:17:14] oh Lord I'm so sorry I'm so bad I'll
[1:17:16] tell you what I I'm gonna pray more Lord
[1:17:18] I'm gonna pray more today because I I'm
[1:17:20] so bad I'm gonna I'm gonna listen to
[1:17:22] more tapes today I I'm gonna read my
[1:17:24] Bible more than than I ever have I'm
[1:17:27] gonna I'm gonna sit down here and read
[1:17:28] several chapters of the Bible because
[1:17:30] I'm I'm such a terrible uh such a
[1:17:32] terrible person or or are we trying to
[1:17:34] we try to do something for somebody and
[1:17:37] we should do that brothers and sisters
[1:17:39] we should do those things but those
[1:17:40] things don't gain you favor with God
[1:17:43] hey man we're not we're not working our
[1:17:46] way into heaven we love the Lord so we
[1:17:48] do his works amen
[1:17:51] and so we try to maybe we try to do
[1:17:54] something extra for somebody or maybe we
[1:17:56] try to pay some more tithes or something
[1:17:57] like that or or you know I give an extra
[1:18:00] five dollars this week here because you
[1:18:02] know what that is that's Catholicism
[1:18:08] man we're not buying our way into heaven
[1:18:10] we're not working our way into heaven
[1:18:11] amen we're not there's no amount of good
[1:18:14] works that we can do that will make us
[1:18:16] Justified there's no amount of good
[1:18:18] works that'll sanctify you there's no
[1:18:20] amount of good work look there's all
[1:18:22] kinds of good old boys out here I
[1:18:24] guarantee you in Hardy Arkansas he's all
[1:18:26] kind of good old boys they'll do
[1:18:28] anything in the world for you that'll
[1:18:30] give you the shirt off their back but
[1:18:32] that don't mean they got the Holy Ghost
[1:18:35] amen
[1:18:38] and so we find then that we say well
[1:18:40] Lord I've done some bad stuff so here's
[1:18:42] some extra works for you yeah
[1:18:44] amen and that's what Israel tried to do
[1:18:47] with the law
[1:18:48] uh that's that's they wanted the law so
[1:18:50] they could figure out a path to be able
[1:18:52] to work their way into salvation right
[1:18:56] but I I uh I'll tell you what if you
[1:18:59] want to write that down it's Romans the
[1:19:00] third chapter let me just scan that just
[1:19:02] real quick we might want to look at
[1:19:04] something in there
[1:19:05] Romans the third chapter
[1:19:08] yeah let's just read a couple verses
[1:19:10] here
[1:19:12] uh
[1:19:17] yeah so 19th verse now we know that the
[1:19:19] things
[1:19:20] what things so ever the law saith that
[1:19:23] saith them unto uh the law has saith
[1:19:26] them unto who are under the law and
[1:19:29] every mouth may be stopped and all the
[1:19:33] world may be come guilty before God
[1:19:37] therefore by the Deeds of the law shall
[1:19:40] no flesh be justified in his sight now
[1:19:43] where it says law you can also add the
[1:19:45] word legalism
[1:19:46] all right so so by your legalism no
[1:19:50] flesh will be justified before the Lord
[1:19:52] amen amen no no amount no long no no
[1:19:55] matter how long the dresses are or the
[1:19:58] skirts are amen or or how long the hair
[1:20:00] is none of those things will justify you
[1:20:03] before the Lord amen we do those things
[1:20:06] because it's pleasing to the Lord and we
[1:20:07] love him
[1:20:09] and we want to be pleasing to the Lord
[1:20:10] amen but if you're just doing those
[1:20:13] things because you think you ought to do
[1:20:15] those things
[1:20:17] then you're miserable because you really
[1:20:19] want to be doing something else
[1:20:22] amen so the key is the the key is to get
[1:20:26] God in the inside where it will project
[1:20:29] to the outside is that right
[1:20:33] and so now 21st verse but now the
[1:20:37] righteousness of God without the law is
[1:20:39] Manifest being witnessed by the law and
[1:20:42] the prophets even the righteousness of
[1:20:44] God which is by faith in Jesus Christ
[1:20:47] unto all and upon all upon all them that
[1:20:51] believe for there is no difference for
[1:20:53] all have sinned and come short of the
[1:20:59] glory of God
[1:21:02] right
[1:21:03] amen so he's saying here that the this
[1:21:07] law that come forth after the atonement
[1:21:10] was made and the sacrifice given once
[1:21:13] and the Holy Ghost came back upon the
[1:21:15] believer the Believers did not obey the
[1:21:18] law they lived the law
[1:21:20] before they had to obey the law and when
[1:21:23] they messed up they had to offer
[1:21:24] sacrifice but after the Holy Ghost after
[1:21:27] the atonement was made they didn't have
[1:21:30] to obey the law they just lived the law
[1:21:34] because they were sheep because they
[1:21:36] were doves amen they cleaned theirself
[1:21:38] from the inside amen but there's a whole
[1:21:41] lot of Believers today that are trying
[1:21:43] to obey the message instead of live the
[1:21:46] message
[1:21:51] there's a whole lot of Believers trying
[1:21:53] to live by a set of laws Saints when
[1:21:55] you're talking to somebody that doesn't
[1:21:56] know this message a lot of times we talk
[1:21:59] to them about what they can't do oh you
[1:22:02] can't do this and you can't do that and
[1:22:04] you can't do this and you gotta stop
[1:22:06] going here and you can't you can't you
[1:22:09] got to let your hair grow and you got to
[1:22:10] quit wearing makeup and you and you got
[1:22:12] to stop going to the movies and you got
[1:22:14] to stop doing this and stop doing that
[1:22:16] why don't anybody that don't have the
[1:22:18] Lord in their life want to do that
[1:22:21] much yeah amen but what we needed to be
[1:22:25] talking to him about is how we can get
[1:22:27] God on the inside God is in this message
[1:22:29] God is in this word
[1:22:32] amen this is the truth this is the way
[1:22:35] this is the life God will take over God
[1:22:38] will live through you
[1:22:40] amen like Papa Cox said brother Brown
[1:22:42] I'd like to be a Christian but but I
[1:22:44] just can't give up these old cigarettes
[1:22:47] now brother Branham did not condemn him
[1:22:50] oh you can't
[1:22:51] yeah
[1:22:53] come on bridge now yeah
[1:22:56] amen
[1:22:58] said I'd like to be baptized but I just
[1:23:00] can't give up these cigarettes
[1:23:03] amen yeah
[1:23:04] but see when God comes on the scene
[1:23:07] yeah hey man
[1:23:09] you couldn't make yourself smoke one
[1:23:11] amen yeah
[1:23:14] amen
[1:23:15] come on
[1:23:17] all right so brother Brown says this
[1:23:21] in the uh unified unit United under one
[1:23:23] head excuse me in 58. he said there's
[1:23:26] two trees one's knowledge
[1:23:28] the other was life
[1:23:30] as long as the man eat from this tree he
[1:23:33] lived but when he bit from that tree he
[1:23:35] died
[1:23:36] but you see it's his nature to try to do
[1:23:39] something to save his self
[1:23:43] there's not one thing
[1:23:45] you can do
[1:23:47] to save yourself
[1:23:51] man said to me one time he said oh I
[1:23:53] sought God and I sought God
[1:23:56] I'll listen to him a few moments and I
[1:23:58] said sir I want to disagree with you I
[1:24:01] don't want to disagree with you but I
[1:24:02] have to
[1:24:03] you never did seek God
[1:24:06] and no man never did it isn't man
[1:24:09] seeking God it's God seeking man
[1:24:13] it wasn't God going up and down the
[1:24:15] garden saying Adam Adam Where Art Thou
[1:24:17] it was man it wasn't man going up and
[1:24:20] down the garden saying God God Where Art
[1:24:22] Thou it was God calling Adam
[1:24:28] Lord and God said in his word no man can
[1:24:31] come to me except my father draws him
[1:24:35] you're seeking to find what's drawn you
[1:24:38] but it's God has to draw first
[1:24:42] the scripture said that and how true it
[1:24:45] is so brother Brown said no man can seek
[1:24:48] God God has to draw you he said now
[1:24:51] you're seeking what's drawing you amen
[1:24:54] that's why you see people come around
[1:24:55] and people come around and want to be
[1:24:58] around you and and people want to come
[1:25:00] to church sometimes with you and stuff
[1:25:01] and they they see something there
[1:25:03] something is drawn them and they're
[1:25:06] seeking for what's drawing them amen but
[1:25:09] it's God that's doing the drawing
[1:25:12] he said there's not one thing you can do
[1:25:15] to save yourself he said listen to you
[1:25:18] legalist Believers I want to ask you
[1:25:20] something there's he said he wanted to
[1:25:22] ask him something but then he just told
[1:25:24] him
[1:25:25] he said listen to you legalist Believers
[1:25:28] I want to ask you something there's not
[1:25:30] one thing you can do to be saved by
[1:25:32] yourself
[1:25:33] no sir you are saved by grace and that
[1:25:36] alone and you have nothing to do with it
[1:25:40] God chose you in Christ before the
[1:25:44] foundation of the world
[1:25:46] that's right there's not one thing you
[1:25:48] can do to merits
[1:25:50] so keep all the Commandments you want to
[1:25:53] join all the churches you want to you're
[1:25:56] still lost he said
[1:25:59] amen listen to all the tapes you want to
[1:26:02] amen
[1:26:04] memorize all the quotes you want to
[1:26:07] memorize all the scriptures you want too
[1:26:11] amen you're still lost
[1:26:15] amen right
[1:26:17] look here Saints I've been quoted a lot
[1:26:19] of message quotes yeah by a lot of
[1:26:22] devils
[1:26:27] I didn't know it at the time but when we
[1:26:29] saw the fruits of the after that
[1:26:33] how could How could somebody that vowel
[1:26:35] and that that tormented that that that
[1:26:37] that deranged
[1:26:40] quote me the message
[1:26:44] is that right yeah
[1:26:48] truth it's because the message ain't on
[1:26:52] the inside of it right amen it's it's he
[1:26:54] said it he said there was two trees
[1:26:55] there was knowledge right and so they
[1:26:57] got that knowledge they got the message
[1:27:00] knowledge or maybe the Bible knowledge
[1:27:02] and all those things Saints but they
[1:27:04] don't have the life
[1:27:07] because the knowledge is in the head but
[1:27:09] the life is in the on the inside of the
[1:27:12] inside amen
[1:27:17] all right let's go a little deeper into
[1:27:19] that I I feel like this one Terry on
[1:27:21] that just a little bit he said but he
[1:27:22] said the mark of the beast he said but
[1:27:24] now how are we saved by faith we are
[1:27:27] saved and that by Grace nothing you can
[1:27:30] do not one thing you can do to be saved
[1:27:32] if you can then Christ died in vain
[1:27:36] yes it isn't what you eat what you drink
[1:27:39] how you dress this that or the other but
[1:27:42] you're saved by grace through faith
[1:27:46] God by his Sovereign Grace what does
[1:27:49] sovereign mean he didn't have to explain
[1:27:50] it
[1:27:52] amen he doesn't have to explain it it's
[1:27:54] Sovereign it's freely given there's no
[1:27:56] strings attached uh he doesn't have to
[1:27:58] explain why out of my whole family out
[1:28:01] of my whole I was my parents my my
[1:28:03] grandparents my my everybody that was in
[1:28:06] my family why nobody even went to church
[1:28:08] but God by his Sovereign Grace
[1:28:12] chose me out of that
[1:28:15] he chose you out of that
[1:28:19] amen by his Sovereign Grace not by our
[1:28:23] works
[1:28:24] amen he didn't choose you because he was
[1:28:26] a good person he didn't choose you
[1:28:28] because you come from a message family
[1:28:32] amen and I find this difficult a lot of
[1:28:35] times especially for now we got third
[1:28:37] and fourth generation message Believers
[1:28:39] but Saints a third generation message
[1:28:41] believer that was raised in a message
[1:28:43] home still has to come the same way I
[1:28:46] did
[1:28:46] [Applause]
[1:28:49] hey man still got to come the same way
[1:28:52] he's still got to be justified still got
[1:28:55] to be Sanctified still got to receive
[1:28:57] the same Holy Spirit
[1:28:59] amen and if you're coming cause Mom and
[1:29:01] Daddy does then you're coming for the
[1:29:03] wrong reason if you're leaving your hair
[1:29:05] long because Mom and Daddy told you to
[1:29:07] it's for the wrong reason Saints
[1:29:12] amen you gotta come because you're
[1:29:16] called
[1:29:18] thank you yeah and you got to come the
[1:29:21] same way oh you got to come the same way
[1:29:23] it's the same altar that you gotta fall

[1:29:31] but you got to fall down at that same
[1:29:33] Altar and receive it the same way and
[1:29:36] it's the same Holy Spirit today
[1:29:42] amen
[1:29:47] what else did Jesus do
[1:29:49] he gave and forsook his own life
[1:29:52] he gave his life to save yours and mine
[1:29:57] because that he
[1:29:58] that he gave his life
[1:30:00] he didn't have to lay it down he'd done
[1:30:03] it willingly yes
[1:30:05] he he didn't have to do it but he did it
[1:30:07] willingly because he could save you and

[1:30:33] to come through Jesus Christ
[1:30:40] he willingly because he could save you
[1:30:41] and now he's the only one that can save
[1:30:43] you there's nothing else can save you I
[1:30:45] know

[1:33:49] yes not anything there's not one thing
[1:33:50] you can do to Merit it you're simply
[1:33:52] lost and that's all of it there's not a
[1:33:55] way for you you have to accept his
[1:33:58] provided method
[1:34:00] yes that's Jesus Christ and it's freely
[1:34:04] you don't have to do one thing
[1:34:06] but just accept
[1:34:08] what's been given to you
[1:34:10] not a thing you can do he said
[1:34:14] amen
[1:34:17] it's good yes thank you so we go through
[1:34:20] this process of hearing
[1:34:23] all this
[1:34:26] oh we hear all these these things in her
[1:34:29] head it would make us think we're not
[1:34:30] good enough and and then we go to the
[1:34:32] next step of thanking God is judging us
[1:34:35] by the trials we go through and then we
[1:34:37] go to the next step of trying to do
[1:34:39] works and work our way in and and trying
[1:34:41] to work ourselves through
[1:34:43] and then you know along the way we're
[1:34:47] listening to other people we're
[1:34:49] listening to other believers we're
[1:34:50] listening to other ministers we're
[1:34:52] listening to other uh personalities and
[1:34:54] so forth and and we hear a lot of talk
[1:34:56] about how spiritual they are and and
[1:34:59] about about the mighty things that the
[1:35:02] Lord is doing and truly God is doing
[1:35:04] miraculous things
[1:35:06] and we hear about those miraculous
[1:35:08] things that we hear about all these
[1:35:10] great testimonies of of healing and
[1:35:12] testimonies of the power of God and we
[1:35:15] hear people testifying to things in
[1:35:17] their life and and how devoted they are
[1:35:19] and and how much your prayer they do and
[1:35:22] and people talk you know people talk
[1:35:24] about oh oh brother I just got down and
[1:35:26] I was praying and the spirit of the Lord
[1:35:28] fell on me and I was just there for five
[1:35:30] six hours and then you know we look at
[1:35:32] that and we start comparing our life
[1:35:35] yeah
[1:35:36] to what we hear from others
[1:35:39] amen now look it's perfectly acceptable
[1:35:42] for you to compare your life with the
[1:35:44] word of God
[1:35:45] amen
[1:35:46] perfect
[1:35:49] so when you hear the word of God you
[1:35:50] hear that you hear the word of God come
[1:35:52] forth or or you hear a tape at your home
[1:35:54] or or here wherever you you're a tape
[1:35:57] and you hear Brother Branham and you
[1:35:59] compare yourself with that word
[1:36:02] that's acceptable because then you want
[1:36:04] to say Lord let me measure up to that
[1:36:06] there's the there's the standard Lord
[1:36:08] bring me to that standard let me measure
[1:36:10] up to that standard Lord
[1:36:12] amen when you hear the preaching of the
[1:36:14] word come forth you say Lord I look here
[1:36:17] as ministers we we got to preach it the
[1:36:19] way God gives it to us amen and and and
[1:36:22] so when the Lord is is dealing with the
[1:36:25] congregation he's trying to raise the
[1:36:27] congregation up
[1:36:29] but a lot of times instead of raising
[1:36:31] ourself up we're beating ourself down
[1:36:34] because we say I'm not there
[1:36:37] I'm not there that's not me this brother
[1:36:39] so-and-so over here he prays he prays
[1:36:41] four hours a day a sister so-and-so man
[1:36:44] she knows that Bible so well and she
[1:36:46] just constantly reading her Bible and
[1:36:48] and brother so and so over here he's got
[1:36:50] such an anointing when he speaks and and
[1:36:52] brother so and so over sees visions and
[1:36:54] and this brother dreams dreams and and
[1:36:56] this brother does this and that brother
[1:36:58] does that and his sister has got such a
[1:37:00] uh such a mighty she does so uh the
[1:37:02] mighty works and saying things for the
[1:37:04] Lord and we start comparing ourself to
[1:37:07] others yes and that's where we get into
[1:37:09] a mistake
[1:37:10] right you see
[1:37:12] carnal impersonation is the spirit of
[1:37:15] this day right
[1:37:17] people are constantly comparing
[1:37:19] themselves to others they're constantly
[1:37:21] comparing themselves against what other
[1:37:24] people do and say
[1:37:25] but you can't be nobody else
[1:37:28] amen what the brother say you can't be
[1:37:30] what you hate yeah
[1:37:32] amen you are what you are by the grace
[1:37:35] of God Amen I especially see it plagan
[1:37:39] ministers because all the minister will
[1:37:42] see another brother with a special gift
[1:37:44] or a special Ministry he Compares his
[1:37:46] gift or his ministry with that brothers
[1:37:48] and Saints God uses all of it
[1:37:53] that's right amen and and you know in a
[1:37:56] congregation this size you're going to
[1:37:57] have some people that maybe they can
[1:37:59] play an instrument or maybe they can
[1:38:01] sing or or you got some people that that
[1:38:04] when you put them out there to to do a
[1:38:06] get-together man the decorations and all
[1:38:09] the food cooking and all that stuff they
[1:38:10] just gifted at doing that kind of stuff
[1:38:12] right and so you can I can't do none of
[1:38:14] that you say Lord I can't do that I
[1:38:16] can't sing I can't you know what it
[1:38:18] doesn't matter what you can do
[1:38:21] amen it matters what you give to God
[1:38:26] you say Lord I can't sing but I tell you
[1:38:28] what I can be at church
[1:38:33] I can't preach but I can support the
[1:38:35] ministry
[1:38:37] amen
[1:38:38] amen I may not be able to go to Africa
[1:38:41] but you know what maybe the Lord gifted
[1:38:43] me financially maybe I can send somebody
[1:38:45] to Africa
[1:38:47] amen
[1:38:49] look Lord I I can't I can't say but I'll
[1:38:51] tell you what I can do I can say Amen to
[1:38:53] that word
[1:38:55] I'll tell you that's important somebody
[1:38:57] say Amen to the word
[1:38:59] I mean that's really important for the
[1:39:01] church service be a really weird service
[1:39:04] if nobody said amen
[1:39:06] now I've been in some of them churches
[1:39:09] it's hard to preach in them
[1:39:12] amen I said in one church it was stoned
[1:39:15] silent the whole time I thought they're
[1:39:17] going to Lynch me at the door
[1:39:20] and after service that brother after
[1:39:22] brother sister have said oh brother
[1:39:24] George because that we enjoyed that that
[1:39:26] was so good really
[1:39:29] yeah
[1:39:32] that is a surprise
[1:39:35] amen so we all have a place is what I'm
[1:39:38] saying and you know if the Amen Corner
[1:39:40] is missing it makes it hard on the
[1:39:42] preacher to preach amen if the seed is
[1:39:45] that has you in it amen as a minister
[1:39:48] you know where you know where that
[1:39:50] certain amen comes from brother Ben and
[1:39:53] if that ain't man's not there
[1:39:55] it affects the service amen amen the
[1:39:59] song service Saints it's critical
[1:40:02] critically important to the service
[1:40:05] amen it doesn't matter how good a
[1:40:08] preacher you are if you if you get
[1:40:09] dumped out here
[1:40:12] put you up here cold
[1:40:14] any minister is going to struggle
[1:40:17] amen it's critical these are critical
[1:40:20] things no matter what your place is do
[1:40:23] the best you can with it
[1:40:26] and don't worry about what others say
[1:40:28] look what others say I'm I'm a little
[1:40:31] news flash here
[1:40:32] may or may not be true
[1:40:37] maybe they listen to five tapes a day
[1:40:40] yeah maybe they don't
[1:40:42] maybe they pray five hours a day maybe
[1:40:45] they don't we're still dealing with
[1:40:47] human beings here
[1:40:49] amen so if you're comparing yourself to
[1:40:51] brother so-and-so that says he prays
[1:40:53] four hours a day
[1:40:55] you might be comparing yourself to
[1:40:56] unrealistic expectations
[1:40:58] amen
[1:41:02] amen
[1:41:04] so this is all a pro this is all the
[1:41:06] devil affecting our minds using these
[1:41:08] things to affect our minds to to get off
[1:41:11] of the point that Jesus Christ made the
[1:41:14] way called us Sanctified us fill us with
[1:41:17] the Holy Ghost
[1:41:18] and did it all and he did it freely and
[1:41:22] he did it without money without price
[1:41:27] and it don't matter if I can sing it
[1:41:29] don't matter if I can preach it don't
[1:41:31] matter if I can play anything I can't
[1:41:33] even clap right
[1:41:35] great come on but God still saved me
[1:41:39] [Applause]
[1:41:46] you know some Churches clap on two and
[1:41:48] four some clap on one and three some
[1:41:50] clap on one two three four
[1:41:54] it don't matter
[1:41:56] amen it don't matter God still saves you
[1:42:01] Say Amen
[1:42:03] all right
[1:42:08] you know we hear a lot of things you
[1:42:09] hear the message you hear preaching and
[1:42:11] those things and sometimes you do feel a
[1:42:12] million miles off yeah
[1:42:14] you do feel a million miles off you feel
[1:42:17] like you're way way short way way short
[1:42:20] and and I think that's natural and I
[1:42:23] would rather you feel that way than to
[1:42:25] be one of these other believers that are
[1:42:28] arrogant and and there's such an
[1:42:31] arrogance about it oh praise God I'm
[1:42:33] saved I'm the Bride of Jesus Christ and
[1:42:36] and God saw you know and you know we
[1:42:38] start to feel like we're special so
[1:42:39] that's the only thing special about us
[1:42:41] is the foreknowledge of God
[1:42:43] hey
[1:42:44] [Applause]
[1:42:45] and so people start to feel like that
[1:42:47] and they start to talk like that act
[1:42:49] like no matter what they do you know
[1:42:51] nothing can happen you know nothing that
[1:42:52] can happen to them and and that
[1:42:54] arrogance I don't think God is in
[1:42:57] it I don't think the Lord is in
[1:42:59] arrogance like that Lord wants a humble
[1:43:01] people that are thankful for what he did
[1:43:04] amen amen I I've had people I had a uh
[1:43:09] one of these little uh message boys that
[1:43:12] uh knew all the quotes and stuff but he
[1:43:16] didn't have no message in him
[1:43:19] come on and he did something you know it
[1:43:21] was uh he did something sinful is really
[1:43:23] bad actually and he come to me to con
[1:43:26] confess it he's confessed it but his
[1:43:29] confession was well brother George you
[1:43:30] know I did that but I'm just so thankful
[1:43:33] to God I asked him to he I forgive me
[1:43:35] and he did he's forgiven me and and I
[1:43:37] just it's so good to be back in the in
[1:43:40] the grace of God again and
[1:43:43] that's not confession that's not
[1:43:45] that's not repentance
[1:43:47] amen that's not repentance if you're
[1:43:50] repented about something you're you're
[1:43:51] sorry for what you did you Lord I made a
[1:43:54] mistake I I've done wrong this is this
[1:43:56] is not my intention I I Forgive Me Lord
[1:43:59] amen that's a that's a different
[1:44:01] attitude to take amen not just arrogance
[1:44:05] like we're too good I don't ever want to
[1:44:07] be so good that I can't talk to a sinner
[1:44:12] I don't be so holy
[1:44:16] that I that I can't operate in the
[1:44:18] presence of somebody that doesn't
[1:44:19] believe the message I never wanted my
[1:44:21] kids to not be able to talk to somebody
[1:44:24] that didn't believe the way they
[1:44:25] believed I I always wanted to be human
[1:44:27] and be people and be Godly and represent
[1:44:30] Jesus Christ to somebody
[1:44:33] hey man I didn't want him to gasp when
[1:44:35] they saw
[1:44:37] a woman with pants on or
[1:44:39] something like that you know I mean come
[1:44:41] on we're just people here Saints and
[1:44:44] we're concerned about other people we
[1:44:47] love people amen if you don't love
[1:44:49] people science you need to that you do
[1:44:51] need to be at the altar
[1:44:53] oh man
[1:44:58] amen
[1:45:03] you know I think watching other people
[1:45:04] is why we see so many trends of Doctrine
[1:45:07] in the message you know we're just
[1:45:10] listen to the message it's been the same
[1:45:11] way ever since I've been in the message
[1:45:14] amen message ain't changed nonsense now
[1:45:16] some of y'all I mean you've been in a
[1:45:18] message 80 years or whatever
[1:45:21] you got more tapes right yeah you had
[1:45:24] you had five tapes and then you got six
[1:45:26] tapes and seven tapes and so yeah it
[1:45:28] probably changed something for you but
[1:45:30] but ever since I've been in the message
[1:45:32] I've had all the tapes and they ain't
[1:45:34] changed the bits
[1:45:37] oh yeah just like my Bible every time I
[1:45:40] read my Bible it reads the same way
[1:45:42] every time
[1:45:43] hadn't changed any at all
[1:45:45] so so so so these trends of Doctrine
[1:45:48] though they keep changing all the time
[1:45:51] amen so it's not changing because the
[1:45:53] message changed it's not changing
[1:45:55] because the scripture changed so it's
[1:45:57] got to be changing because people's
[1:45:59] listening to other people
[1:46:02] yeah come on Amen
[1:46:06] and you know just in my short time in
[1:46:09] the message I was thinking last night
[1:46:11] about how many of these doctrines has
[1:46:13] come through my way in my short time and
[1:46:16] and uh uh I counted up about six
[1:46:19] different doctrines major uh false
[1:46:22] doctrines that come through and I don't
[1:46:24] know how many smaller false doctrines
[1:46:26] has come through and you know what they
[1:46:28] do they come through
[1:46:30] and then they go
[1:46:33] and then another one comes through
[1:46:35] yeah and then it goes amen but that
[1:46:39] Spirit Still Remains the Same
[1:46:41] amen
[1:46:45] so if we're trying to compare our
[1:46:47] experience
[1:46:49] with everyone else's experience
[1:46:52] we might be going against unrealistic
[1:46:54] experiences
[1:46:56] but God does not require
[1:46:59] us to do that remember we read in the
[1:47:02] scripture there where he loved us
[1:47:06] before we were even lovable
[1:47:10] amen he died for us when we were ungodly
[1:47:13] yeah
[1:47:15] yeah is that what the scripture said
[1:47:17] amen he said scarcely a righteous man be
[1:47:20] saved scarcely a man would give his life
[1:47:22] for a good man or a righteous man but he
[1:47:26] gave his life for the ungodly
[1:47:28] amen and he he gave his life for people
[1:47:31] that didn't love him yeah
[1:47:33] amen and the Bible said in that while we
[1:47:37] were yet sinners
[1:47:38] Christ died for us so look we wasn't
[1:47:43] serving him we wasn't doing anything for
[1:47:45] him
[1:47:46] we wouldn't we wasn't doing anything for
[1:47:48] the kingdom of God and he still died for
[1:47:50] us
[1:47:51] [Music]
[1:47:54] amen
[1:47:55] so let me assure you the Lord is not
[1:47:58] angry with you today
[1:48:00] he is not punishing you today
[1:48:03] amen he is not require that you work
[1:48:06] your way into heaven
[1:48:08] he has freely made the way and freely
[1:48:12] give it to his people
[1:48:16] amen so let's get this straight in our
[1:48:19] minds before we close now look at here I
[1:48:21] might be 41 minutes in brother Ben
[1:48:26] fixing to close
[1:48:27] but let's get this straight in our minds
[1:48:30] here
[1:48:34] true that we're not what we should be
[1:48:40] um it's true that we make mistakes
[1:48:43] it's true that we come up short
[1:48:47] it's true that we live below our
[1:48:50] privileges
[1:48:51] amen
[1:48:52] now I can tell you I'm seeing a bride
[1:48:55] that's that's being raised up
[1:48:57] but we're still not there yet but I do
[1:49:01] see God at work raising up a bride
[1:49:04] amen
[1:49:06] and we know that there's nothing left
[1:49:08] for the coming of the but the coming of
[1:49:10] the Lord is that right
[1:49:12] so so it's it's we're getting close amen
[1:49:15] we're getting closer all the time but
[1:49:17] obviously we're not quite there yet or
[1:49:19] he'd already be here
[1:49:21] amen so he's preparing a bride
[1:49:25] amen and so he's preparing a bride so it
[1:49:27] is true that we come up short I make a
[1:49:30] lot of mistakes I'm sure you make a lot
[1:49:33] of mistakes we all make a lot of
[1:49:35] mistakes I say things that I shouldn't
[1:49:37] say
[1:49:39] yeah amen I do things sometimes I I
[1:49:41] shouldn't do I I I I I fail I fall short
[1:49:45] all those things are true when the enemy
[1:49:47] when he when he brings that up against
[1:49:48] you all you can really do is agree
[1:49:52] yeah that's true but it don't matter
[1:49:57] it don't matter
[1:49:59] because here's the thing we do these
[1:50:01] things and when we do something bad it's
[1:50:03] man's tendency to run from God it's
[1:50:06] man's tendency when when we do bad we
[1:50:08] want to try to get ourselves
[1:50:09] straightened up before we come back to
[1:50:10] church
[1:50:11] oh we do we do something we fall short
[1:50:14] in some kind of way and we want to try
[1:50:15] to we try to do some kind of penance for
[1:50:17] it you know I I'm going to pray 10 hours
[1:50:20] today and so we're trying to work our
[1:50:21] way back into his Graces Saints let me
[1:50:24] tell you something do you think that God
[1:50:26] don't know what you did
[1:50:27] oh my
[1:50:29] God you're trying to hide from him like
[1:50:31] he can't see it
[1:50:34] trying to hide from him like he don't
[1:50:36] know it he knows what you did he knew
[1:50:38] what she's going to do before the
[1:50:40] foundation of the world that's why he
[1:50:41] made a way of Escape
[1:50:48] is this all right this morning
[1:50:52] he knows
[1:50:53] better than we know what we are
[1:50:56] God knows what you are better and you
[1:50:58] know what you are right you can't hide
[1:51:00] from God
[1:51:01] but he loved us anyway before we was
[1:51:05] lovable he loved us anyway and made a
[1:51:09] way
[1:51:10] amen he took our place many times we
[1:51:13] won't come to God because we're ashamed
[1:51:15] and we're trying to fix it ourself
[1:51:18] let's turn one more scripture Romans 8.
[1:51:22] I don't know that I got out of Romans
[1:51:23] today
[1:51:24] I love Romans
[1:51:26] I'm gonna read part of this but if you
[1:51:28] got some homework tonight maybe you
[1:51:30] could read the whole chapter of Romans
[1:51:32] 8.
[1:51:33] uh
[1:51:34] but I'm just going to read part of it
[1:51:36] for time's sake here but Romans 8 will
[1:51:39] start at the uh let's start at the 22nd
[1:51:42] chapter or verse there we know that the
[1:51:46] whole creation groaneth and travaileth
[1:51:50] in pain together until now
[1:51:53] and not only they but ourselves also
[1:51:56] which have the first fruits of the
[1:51:58] spirit even we ourselves grown within
[1:52:01] ourselves waiting for the adoption to
[1:52:04] wit the Redemption of our body now let
[1:52:07] me stop and say this can you feel that
[1:52:09] groaning in your spirits
[1:52:13] it's it's a pressure today it's a it's a
[1:52:18] test today it's a it's a groaning it's
[1:52:20] it's you want something so bad and it's
[1:52:23] it feels like it's right there yeah
[1:52:26] amen but it's just a little further
[1:52:28] Saints yes yes but it's a groaning
[1:52:31] that's within us all where we know that
[1:52:33] we're fixing to be reborn
[1:52:36] amen it's those birth pains it's that
[1:52:38] travail
[1:52:39] amen waiting on that birth of the new
[1:52:42] body yes
[1:52:44] for we are saved by hope
[1:52:48] but hope that is seen is not hope
[1:52:51] for what a man seeth why do he yet hope
[1:52:54] for but if we hope for that we see not
[1:52:58] then we do with patients wait for it
[1:53:02] so
[1:53:03] that makes it even more complicated
[1:53:05] doesn't it what we're waiting on
[1:53:09] we just can't we know it's coming we
[1:53:11] feel it's coming we know it's there but
[1:53:13] we don't know exactly what it looks like
[1:53:16] amen we don't know exactly how this
[1:53:19] Rapture is going to take place we don't
[1:53:22] exactly know what the church is going to
[1:53:24] go through before that time comes we
[1:53:26] don't exactly know but we know it's
[1:53:28] coming because the word promised it amen
[1:53:32] and we ain't got it all figured out we
[1:53:35] don't know exactly but we know it's
[1:53:37] coming and we have hope
[1:53:40] for the things that we don't see
[1:53:42] likewise the spirit also helpeth our
[1:53:45] infirmities for we know not what we
[1:53:48] should pray for as we ought isn't that
[1:53:50] something yeah yeah yeah we don't even
[1:53:52] know how to pray right
[1:53:55] amen yeah
[1:53:59] yeah but but the spirit itself maketh
[1:54:02] intercession for us with groanings which
[1:54:04] cannot be uttered
[1:54:07] for he that searcheth the hearts knoweth
[1:54:10] what's in the mind of the spirits
[1:54:12] because he maketh intercession for the
[1:54:14] Saints according to the will of God
[1:54:18] isn't that beautiful Saints amen you say
[1:54:22] well I I don't know what to pray for you
[1:54:24] don't even have to know what to pray for
[1:54:27] you just pray
[1:54:29] amen and you know you say well I might
[1:54:32] pray for the wrong thing the spirit
[1:54:34] makes intercession for those things also
[1:54:38] see what it said God knows your hearts
[1:54:43] he knows what you mean he knows what
[1:54:45] you're trying to convey amen he knows
[1:54:48] what you're saying you may not know how
[1:54:51] to say what you're feeling but he knows
[1:54:55] and he makes the intercession right
[1:54:59] amen
[1:55:01] it's good praise God
[1:55:07] and we know that all things work
[1:55:10] together for the good
[1:55:12] to them that love God
[1:55:14] to them who are called according to his
[1:55:16] purpose
[1:55:17] for whom he did for no he also did
[1:55:20] predestinate
[1:55:21] to be conformed into the image of his
[1:55:24] son
[1:55:25] that he might be the firstborn
[1:55:27] among many brethren
[1:55:30] moreover who he did predestinate them he
[1:55:33] also called
[1:55:35] and whom he called them he also
[1:55:38] justified in whom he justified them he
[1:55:43] also glorified
[1:55:47] this is all in past tense
[1:55:50] it's already done
[1:55:53] it's already done
[1:55:55] amen
[1:55:56] and we say well I I don't know how that
[1:55:59] could be well you don't think God knows
[1:56:00] the end from the beginning
[1:56:03] amen how could he prophesy how could
[1:56:05] there be a prophecy if God didn't know
[1:56:06] the end from the beginning
[1:56:08] he knows why it's gonna wrap up he knows
[1:56:10] how it's all going to be he knows what
[1:56:12] you are and he's not looking at what you
[1:56:14] are now he's looking at what you are
[1:56:16] there
[1:56:18] amen he's looking at a finished work
[1:56:22] so when you think God's judging you he
[1:56:24] can't even see all that it's done the
[1:56:25] blood of Jesus Christ he's looking at a
[1:56:28] perfect statue of a perfect man a
[1:56:31] perfect woman
[1:56:34] [Music]
[1:56:35] amen
[1:56:38] all right
[1:56:39] this last little bit here I just I don't
[1:56:42] want to read this but I do want to read
[1:56:43] this so
[1:56:46] all this condemnation that we deal with
[1:56:49] all this uh beat down that we take by
[1:56:52] the devil all of these negative thoughts
[1:56:54] and negative emotions negative feelings
[1:56:56] all of those things that we deal with
[1:56:58] Saints that's just going on up here
[1:57:01] that's the greatest battle ever fought
[1:57:03] that's the greatest battle ever fought
[1:57:05] is going on right here in our minds but
[1:57:08] but the Bible says this this is what we
[1:57:10] got to lean on not what's going on in
[1:57:12] our minds but we got to lean on what the
[1:57:14] word of God promises
[1:57:16] is that right so that's what as a
[1:57:19] Christian that's our job is to lean to
[1:57:21] the word of God above what we think feel
[1:57:24] above what our emotions say we say well
[1:57:26] the word says
[1:57:28] amen and the word says what shall we say
[1:57:31] to these things if God be for us who can
[1:57:35] be against us
[1:57:37] God is for us
[1:57:39] he's not angry at us he's not punishing
[1:57:43] us he is for us
[1:57:47] he's not upset with you
[1:57:50] hey man he's not trying to punish you
[1:57:52] he's for you when he lets those light
[1:57:55] afflictions come on he lets you struggle
[1:57:58] a little bit that's for you
[1:58:00] amen amen so when you're done you look
[1:58:04] like that statue
[1:58:05] amen he's chipped away yeah
[1:58:09] he that he spared not his own son but he
[1:58:12] delivered him for us all how shall we
[1:58:14] not with him also freely give us all
[1:58:16] things freely give us all things who
[1:58:21] shall lay anything to the charge of
[1:58:25] God's elect
[1:58:27] amen
[1:58:29] Satan can come before the Lord and can
[1:58:32] can lay all kinds of charges about oh
[1:58:34] did you see what they did you say he
[1:58:36] said nobody
[1:58:38] can even lay charge
[1:58:40] against my elect
[1:58:43] they're mine
[1:58:44] they're mine I died for them I
[1:58:47] Sanctified them I Justified them I
[1:58:50] glorified them I provided a way for them
[1:58:53] I did all of that and I don't want to
[1:58:55] hear nothing else

[1:59:34] can stop God
[1:59:38] rest of that chapter all it says is
[1:59:40] nothing can separate us
[1:59:43] from the love of God
[1:59:45] that's in Christ Jesus
