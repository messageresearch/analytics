[31:55] Y'all are singing good this morning.
[31:56] Just continue worshiping.
[31:58] We'll start with the first verse there.
[32:01] I have heard how Christians
[32:06] long ago
[32:08] they were brought before
[32:12] the tyant throne.
[32:16] They were told that he would spare their
[32:21] lives
[32:23] if they would renounce
[32:27] the name of Christ.
[32:31] But one by one
[32:34] they chose to die.
[32:38] The son of God,
[32:41] they would not deny
[32:45] like a great angelic
[32:49] choir sings.
[32:52] I can almost
[32:54] hear their voicees
[32:58] ring.
[32:59] I pledge
[33:01] alce
[33:04] to the lamb.
[33:06] With all my strength,
[33:10] with all I am, I will sing to
[33:18] his command.
[33:21] I pledge
[33:23] allegiance
[33:25] to
[33:26] [Music]
[33:28] the lamb.
[33:32] Now the years have come
[33:35] and the years have gone,
[33:39] but the cause of Jesus
[33:43] still goes on.
[33:46] Now our time has come to count the cost
[33:53] to reject this world to embrace
[33:59] the cross.
[34:01] So one by one let us live our lives
[34:07] for the one who died
[34:11] to give us life
[34:15] till the trumpet
[34:17] sounds on that final
[34:20] day.
[34:22] Let us proudly
[34:24] stand

[34:28] say our
[34:31] lead us to the land
[34:36] with all my strength with all I am. I
[34:43] will seek to honor
[34:47] his command.
[34:50] I pledge
[34:52] alance.
[34:54] Can we lift our hands? We sing that
[34:56] chorus again. The lamb.
[35:00] Oh, I pledge
[35:03] alance
[35:05] to the lamb.
[35:08] With all my strength, with all I am, I
[35:15] will sing to honor
[35:19] his command.
[35:22] I pledge
[35:24] alence
[35:26] to
[35:29] the lamb.
[35:31] Can we give the Lord a hand?
[35:36] and you love the lamb this morning. And
[35:39] we'll go ahead and change the order of
[35:40] the service over and invite our pastor
[35:42] to come. And let's sing that song if we
[35:44] could. KF the more that I surrender. If
[35:47] you want to go ahead and stand as we
[35:48] invite our pastor to come this morning.
[35:51] Amen. Just pull on the gift of God. We
[35:54] know that he's able to meet our needs
[35:55] this morning.
[35:57] Amen. We just got to surrender
[35:59] completely to him.
[36:02] The more
[36:04] the more that I
[36:08] surrender,
[36:11] the lighter
[36:14] my love.
[36:18] The more that I
[36:22] release my cares,
[36:25] the more you take control.
[36:31] Oh, the more that I
[36:36] can humble myself,
[36:39] the more you lift me up.
[36:44] And every day I live.

[36:53] you more.

[37:45] Lord, I love
[37:48] you more with all our hearts.
[37:52] Oh, it's the more that I
[37:58] surrender,
[38:02] the lighter
[38:05] my love,
[38:07] [Music]
[38:09] the more that I
[38:12] release my cares,
[38:16] the more you take
[38:19] control.
[38:20] Oh, sing it now. Oh, the more that I
[38:26] can humble myself,
[38:29] the more you lift me up.
[38:34] Oh, every
[38:36] day I live.
[38:39] Oh Lord, I love
[38:43] you more.
[38:45] Let's bow our heads together for a word
[38:47] of prayer. Heavenly Father, we're so
[38:49] thankful to be in your house this
[38:51] morning, Lord. To surrender ourselves to
[38:54] your will and to your way. To hear,
[38:56] Lord, the word of God that we might
[38:59] become that word, Lord. We don't want to
[39:01] just hear it and be forgetful hearers of
[39:02] the word, but to be doers of the word
[39:05] today. To put that into action in our
[39:07] lives, Lord, in our everyday life, Lord,
[39:09] though it may be simple, Lord, but it's
[39:11] a display of the manifestation of the
[39:13] word. I pray you'd help us to do that,
[39:15] Lord. I pray you'd help us this morning.
[39:18] Lord, I I realize every time I come to
[39:20] preach, I stand between the living and
[39:22] the dead. Lord, I realize that Lord,
[39:25] there may be someone with a need here
[39:26] this morning and and only you can meet
[39:29] that need that. So, I move Lord myself
[39:31] out of the way. Help me, Lord, to
[39:33] surrender myself so that you can speak
[39:36] to the people. We pray. I pray that
[39:38] you'd move. I pray you'd move for our
[39:39] young people, our elders. Lord, heal the
[39:41] sick. Pray you'd touch them now. We pray
[39:43] in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen. God bless
[39:47] you this morning. We're going to read
[39:48] from Zephaniah chapter 3. Zephaniah
[39:51] chapter 3 and verse 14.
[39:55] We uh Sister Fritz, are you feeling
[39:57] better? God bless you. She wasn't
[39:59] feeling well when she got here, but
[40:01] believing the Lord's going to strengthen
[40:02] her this morning. Uh Brother Herold's
[40:05] got to leave after church, and I don't
[40:07] want to embarrass you, Brother Herald,
[40:08] but he's going to get an award. Uh he

[40:12] this. and uh he he takes care of the

[40:25] thing, isn't it? Keeping your children
[40:27] safe. So, thank you, brother Herald, for
[40:30] doing that. I I thought I'd just
[40:32] embarrass him a little bit this morning.
[40:33] So, but we uh we sure appreciate, you
[40:36] know, that's part of us manifesting the
[40:38] word in our communities and being a
[40:40] light is doing those things. And so he's
[40:42] got to leave after service this morning
[40:43] and go get that award. So pray the Lord
[40:46] would help him on the road and
[40:47] traveling. Amen. Zephaniah chapter 3 and
[40:50] verse14. I want to speak to you this
[40:53] morning on joy in his presence. Good to
[40:55] have each of you with us. Sister Rebecca
[40:57] and the kids back with us this morning.
[40:58] God bless you. Thank you for being here.
[41:00] And and uh the duckwor back with us this
[41:03] morning. God bless you all. And if I'm
[41:05] missing somebody, I I we just we just
[41:07] assume you're going to be here. So I
[41:09] appreciate you being here. all of our
[41:10] regulars and and it's been so good to
[41:12] see Jaden and Isabella with us the last
[41:15] few weeks and sitting there in the back.
[41:17] We I just pray the Lord really does a
[41:18] mighty work in y'all's lives and helps
[41:20] you and I know that he has and pray you
[41:22] continue to do that. Zephaniah chapter 3
[41:25] and verse 14 says, "Sing, oh daughter of
[41:28] Zion, shout, O Israel, be glad and
[41:32] rejoice with all the heart, oh daughter
[41:37] of Jerusalem.
[41:39] The Lord hath taken away thy judgments.
[41:44] You know that they had something to sing
[41:46] about. He hath cast out thine enemy. The
[41:51] king of Israel, even the Lord, is in the
[41:54] midst of thee. Thou shalt not see evil
[41:58] anymore. In that day it shall be said to
[42:00] Jerusalem, "Fear thou not." And to Zion,
[42:03] "Let not thine hands be slack. The Lord
[42:07] thy God in the midst of thee is mighty.
[42:10] He will save. He will rejoice over thee
[42:14] with joy. He will rest in his love. He
[42:18] will joy over thee with singing. Pray
[42:21] the Lord would add his blessing to the
[42:22] word. You may be seated. As you can
[42:24] probably already tell, I want to
[42:26] continue to talk to you about kind of in
[42:28] the same vein as we started last Sunday
[42:30] morning. Want to talk about joy in his
[42:32] presence? I want to ask you a question
[42:34] this morning. Are we allowed to be happy
[42:36] in church?
[42:40] Boy, that some of y'all are wondering,
[42:42] well, you know, is this a trick
[42:43] question? I think we could all say yes
[42:46] to that this morning. Are we allowed to
[42:48] be happy in the house of God? I believe
[42:50] we are. and and and and and yet we know
[42:54] knowing what we know and knowing the
[42:56] time and and and how late it is and
[42:58] knowing that we're at the end time and
[43:01] things are are moving so fast and even
[43:04] over the last 24 hours they've started
[43:06] dropping bombs in uh in uh Iran and this
[43:10] nation involved in another war and and
[43:14] we just seems like there's no end to it
[43:16] and and yet the scripture tells us in
[43:18] Matthew 24 there'll be wars and rumors
[43:20] of war and and he said, "Yet the end is
[43:23] not yet." But then he goes on, he says,
[43:25] "But when these things begin to come to
[43:27] pass, right?" He said, "Look up. Lift up
[43:31] your heads for your redemption cometh
[43:33] now." He's not talking about physically
[43:35] looking up, although we could do that,
[43:37] but that's what it's it's a posture of
[43:39] our faith. He's talking about, he says,
[43:42] I want you during this time to be in a
[43:45] position of expectation, to be in a
[43:48] position of of looking forward to
[43:52] something good that's coming, not to
[43:54] look forward to the bad, but to
[43:56] recognize the coming of the king. And
[43:58] yet there seems to be among us who
[44:01] believe the message of the hour almost
[44:03] an unwritten rule. I'm not criticizing
[44:06] you this morning because I criticizing
[44:08] myself because I'm a part of the
[44:09] message. I I I don't like it when people
[44:11] talk bad about message people. Yet, it
[44:14] seems to be an unwritten rule that we
[44:15] must be miserable to be in the message.
[44:17] And and I just don't believe that's
[44:19] true. I I I think that joy is one of the
[44:23] fruits of the spirit. And so, if there's
[44:26] no joy at all, there's no spirit at all.
[44:29] And and and we know that where there is
[44:31] revival, there is joy. Where there is
[44:34] revival, there is joy. And and and I
[44:38] know people would tell you, "Well, the
[44:40] revival's over." And and it's taken from
[44:42] a quote that I've read to you before,
[44:43] but I just wanted to approach it this
[44:46] morning and then move on. But uh but
[44:48] Brother Brandham talks about the revival
[44:50] being over. He said, "The revival is
[44:52] over across the nation. There ain't
[44:54] going to be no more revivals, big
[44:55] sweeping revivals. This nation never
[44:58] receive it." So I want you to notice how
[45:01] he's talking about it. The nation will
[45:02] never receive it. And and listen, you
[45:05] don't cancel quotes with quotes. You
[45:08] don't cancel scripture with scripture.
[45:10] One scripture is true, the other
[45:12] scripture is true. And and what it is,
[45:14] if you think one cancels the other, it's
[45:16] your understanding that needs to be
[45:18] adjusted, not not the quote. And so he
[45:22] said, "This nation will never receive
[45:24] it, you might have an intellectual
[45:25] gathering." He said, "But I mean a
[45:27] spiritual rev revival. We've seen all of
[45:29] it." And he says, "I hope you're
[45:31] catching it. I'm saying it in such a
[45:33] way. I hope you get it. He said, "It's
[45:35] over." He said, "A fine minister said a
[45:37] while ago said, Brother Brandham, if I
[45:38] could just have the joy of the Lord in
[45:40] my heart." And I said, "Son, the revival
[45:43] is over." Now, and I know people read
[45:45] that and they stopped there many times,
[45:47] but and people read that as a negative,
[45:49] but this is not a negative quote.
[45:51] Brother Brandham turns it into a
[45:52] positive and he says this. He said, "Now
[45:55] the stabilizers has been put on the
[45:57] ship." He said, "Great fearful waves are
[45:59] out here before us." I believe that a
[46:01] prophet of God knew what was coming and
[46:03] and he could see into that realm. He
[46:05] could see that there was things going to
[46:06] be coming on the earth and we could see
[46:08] it even in the book of Revelation. Now
[46:10] we see it all around us and and we see
[46:12] those great fearful waves have come in.
[46:14] We've seen the morality of the nation,
[46:16] how it's went downhill and until men are
[46:19] marrying men and getting a license for
[46:21] it. the insanity that women marrying
[46:23] women getting a license for it and how
[46:25] the world's gone insane and even in our
[46:28] even in our nation on the internet and
[46:29] all different places and just insanity
[46:31] everywhere and and we see that uh we see
[46:34] the the great fearful waves of of the
[46:36] war and and rumors of war and all the
[46:39] things that are happening and the attack
[46:40] on Israel and all the things that have
[46:42] happened just in the last little bit the
[46:44] the American pope that went in uh into
[46:47] Rome and and and crying peace peace and
[46:50] yet there's war everywhere. where you
[46:52] see how things have begin to stack up
[46:54] here at the end time. He said great
[46:56] fearful waves are coming are out here
[46:58] before us. He said but we know what do
[47:01] we know this morning just beyond that
[47:03] wave yonder we're nearing the shore. So
[47:07] there's still waves. We're seeing waves
[47:09] come but remember the waves are always
[47:11] greatest seem to be greatest close to
[47:13] the shore. Just beyond that wave we're
[47:15] nearing the shore. So, we got to crest
[47:17] this wave and when we come across it,
[47:18] there's a there's shores on the other
[47:20] side. He said, "We're nearing the shore.
[47:22] Just stay stable. Just stay in the word.
[47:25] Stay with God. No matter how you feel."
[47:28] So, he's telling this young preacher, he
[47:30] said, "Don't base what you believe on
[47:32] what you feel." Right? Just because you
[47:34] don't feel joy or you don't feel
[47:36] revival, don't base your what you
[47:38] believe on that. He said, "Stay right
[47:39] with the word. Let it stay stable." He
[47:41] said, "When you see all these great big
[47:43] old clouds around us and storms coming
[47:46] and atomic bombs and everything else
[47:47] they're talking about, but our
[47:49] stabilizer is right straight in the
[47:51] word." Oh, come on, church. Can't we
[47:54] apply that even to our own families?
[47:55] Even in a church, even everything that
[47:57] we approach when we see great fearful
[47:59] waves out in front of us, when you see a
[48:02] problem in your family that you don't
[48:03] know how you're going to deal with it
[48:05] and you don't know what the future
[48:06] holds, it's a great wave, but you
[48:08] already know he holds your future. You
[48:10] already know it's already been promised.
[48:12] You're going to make it to the other
[48:13] side. Like the disciples crossing the
[48:15] sea, he was still in the boat. He was
[48:17] still there with them. And they thought,
[48:18] "Oh, we'll never make it." But they
[48:20] forgot his promise. He said, "We're
[48:21] going to the other side." And he's told
[48:23] you and I the same thing this morning.
[48:25] We're going to the other side. He said,
[48:28] "We'll go right over the top of them."
[48:30] He said, "Our stabilizers right straight
[48:32] in the word. We'll go right over the top
[48:33] of them. They can't sink us."
[48:37] Come on, church. They can't drown us.
[48:41] This that next quote, they can't drown
[48:43] us. They You put us in the grave, we'll
[48:45] come out again.
[48:47] That's just all there is to it. He said
[48:50] there ain't no way in the world to keep
[48:52] it down there. We'll crest every one of
[48:56] them cuz our great chief captain is
[48:59] calling at the other side.
[49:03] I don't know how you turn that negative.
[49:07] That's a powerful. I don't know how you
[49:09] turn that negative.
[49:11] The bride is is in revival. You have to
[49:13] acknowledge that. Brother Brandon said
[49:15] the move is on for the bride. Where
[49:18] there is revival, there is joy.
[49:20] Right? And it's a fruit of the spirit.
[49:22] The the presence of the Holy Spirit
[49:25] brings joy. So where there is revival,
[49:28] there is joy. So there must be joy. And
[49:31] yet it won't be a joy that'll be caused
[49:32] by an outward sweeping revival because
[49:35] we know that's over. You won't be able
[49:37] to be, you know, I know people are happy
[49:39] or sad depending on the results of an
[49:41] election, but you can't find your joy
[49:43] there because you might win and you
[49:45] might lose.
[49:47] Come on, church. Some of you know what
[49:48] I'm talking about. Some of you Arkansas
[49:49] fans know about that this week, right?
[49:52] You're acquainted with the negative.
[49:53] Like you know that you could lose.
[49:58] Oh, we don't ever watch that. Okay.
[50:01] I heard some shouting on the parking lot
[50:03] the other night.
[50:07] But you know,
[50:10] you don't know. It could be It looks
[50:12] like they're they're surely going to win
[50:14] and they still lose.
[50:17] But we got a promise. We're going to
[50:20] win.
[50:21] Are you hearing me, church? I know you
[50:23] say, "Well, brother Ben, you're just
[50:24] looking out with rosecolored glasses.
[50:27] How could I maintain my sanity
[50:30] if I didn't, brother said, if I didn't
[50:32] believe in predestination, I'd be a
[50:34] discouraged man. If I didn't believe in
[50:36] that God's got it in control, I'd be
[50:39] pretty discouraged this morning. If I
[50:41] didn't believe that he's got everything
[50:42] in control, we we we might as well just
[50:44] shut the doors and go home. But if he's
[50:47] got it all in control, we can keep on
[50:49] planting our potatoes, doing what we're
[50:51] doing, tilling the ground, reaching out
[50:53] to folks around us. What are we doing?
[50:55] We're doing it because we believe in the
[50:57] end he's going to work it all out. It's
[50:59] going to be a miracle, but it's going to
[51:00] be in our favor. We're not going to lose
[51:03] in the ninth inning. Come on, church. We
[51:08] not going to lose at the last moment of
[51:10] time, but we're going to win.
[51:13] That's not a pep talk. That's reality.
[51:16] And if we don't have a revelation of
[51:18] that, we get in trouble.
[51:20] The bride is in revival, but it's a
[51:23] revival of stability.
[51:25] anchored to the word. So when the wind's
[51:29] blowing and the winds are contrary,
[51:31] whatever happens, we can still maintain
[51:34] our joy. What What should our reaction
[51:36] be to the fearful sights that we see?
[51:39] Count it all joy. When you see these
[51:42] things, he said, "Look up. Lift up your
[51:43] heads."
[51:46] See, but brother Ben, he said, Brother
[51:48] Brandham said that the joy, the revival
[51:50] was over. Well, let you say, "How can I
[51:54] have joy?" Well, let me read another
[51:56] quote to you. You he said, 'Brother
[51:58] Brandham, I wish I had joy. He said,
[52:01] 'You can have it.
[52:05] Right. You can have it. Now, now he's
[52:08] going to set a principle here that's
[52:10] important. You're just letting Satan rob
[52:12] you from the privileges that Christ died
[52:14] for.
[52:17] So, you said, "Well, there's no joy. The
[52:19] revival's over." Our people are waiting
[52:21] on some revival to happen in the future.
[52:23] Brother Brandham said they were doing
[52:24] that too in his time. He said they
[52:26] missed the awakening of the bride.
[52:29] They missed it. It's already here,
[52:31] church. Everything we need to go home is
[52:33] already right here. It's already in our
[52:36] possession. It's ours. But he said the
[52:38] reason he said you're letting Satan rob
[52:40] you from the privileges that Christ died
[52:43] for. I'm an heir to it. It's all mine.
[52:45] So when the book was open, when the when
[52:48] restoration come by a prophet, he
[52:51] restored all that was lost. He restored
[52:54] the tree back to its original condition.
[52:56] He did not restore the tree back to its
[52:59] original condition except for joy.
[53:03] Except for peace, except for healing.
[53:05] Right? Come on, church. I'm preaching on
[53:08] joy. I guess we needed it this morning.
[53:12] Now look, you he didn't restore it back
[53:15] except
[53:17] with an exception for well when we get
[53:20] down to the very end, you know, it's
[53:21] just going to be a few of us. That may
[53:23] be true. We're not large in number,
[53:26] but I'm not going to sit down and and
[53:28] moan about it,
[53:30] groan about it. Why would we do that?
[53:32] What's the point of that? What's the
[53:34] purpose of it? We might as well lift up
[53:36] our heads and look up and say, "Our
[53:38] redemption draws nigh." Amen. Cuz we
[53:41] know, listen, you say, "Well, things
[53:43] happen in the church, things happen
[53:45] around us, and and things happen in our
[53:47] families, but those things are not going
[53:49] to destroy us.
[53:52] How could they destroy us? We were
[53:53] appointed by God. If we believe that God
[53:56] put this church here, and there's a
[53:58] reason that he allowed it to be here and
[54:00] he started, there ain't nothing can
[54:01] destroy it. It can't take us as long as
[54:04] we have a purpose that Satan can't do
[54:06] nothing to us that would destroy us." I
[54:08] think we've seen that. I I think we've
[54:10] seen the evidence of that that if God
[54:12] meant for there to be a church in Hardy,
[54:14] Arkansas in this in this spot, then then
[54:16] he there must be a people to come to
[54:18] that church. There must be people
[54:20] that'll be there. And if that's the
[54:21] truth, I don't care what happens. I'm
[54:23] going to keep preaching as long as
[54:24] there's somebody here that say, "Amen.
[54:26] We're going to keep preaching. We're
[54:28] going to keep working. We're going to
[54:29] keep doing what God's called us to do."
[54:31] And guess what? It's all in his hands
[54:32] anyway.
[54:38] But brother Brandham ties this to our
[54:39] privileges from Christ. So he's not
[54:42] saying you have joy because of something
[54:45] that comes through, because of a good
[54:46] service, because of a certain ministry,
[54:49] because of something like that. But he
[54:50] said it's your privilege,
[54:52] right? It's a it's your inheritance
[54:55] to have it. I'm an heir to it. He said
[54:58] it's all mine. That's part of what's
[55:00] mine. Listen, when when when we get to
[55:03] the place where we have to ignore
[55:05] certain quotes or scriptures that don't
[55:06] fit our agenda, we need to come back to
[55:09] the word,
[55:11] right? We we we don't need to there's
[55:13] not a quote in the message that scares
[55:16] me. There's not a scripture in the Bible
[55:17] that scares me. I believe we should
[55:19] preach the full word of God. And so,
[55:23] what attitude should we take when things
[55:24] are difficult? And I realize it's a
[55:27] stressful time to be alive, especially
[55:29] if you watch the news. But but what
[55:31] attitude should we take? The King is
[55:34] coming.
[55:36] The King is coming. It's time to
[55:38] rejoice. But the Reverend says this in
[55:39] 1965. He said, "Our hearts are so full
[55:42] of joy as we see the time appro." Well,
[55:45] I thought you couldn't have no joy. He
[55:46] said, "Our hearts are full of joy as we
[55:48] see the time approaching when we're
[55:50] going to meet him face to face." Does it
[55:53] mean anything to you, church? Has it
[55:55] become such a symbol and so far out
[55:57] there that we think of Christ as some
[56:00] even just a dead letter or is he a
[56:02] person to you? Is it is he a reality to
[56:04] you? Are you looking forward one day to
[56:06] seeing him face to face? Brother said
[56:08] there is a heaven and there is a literal
[56:10] Jesus Christ who will come in a body
[56:11] form and he'll catch away his bride. He
[56:14] said that's what believers believe. I'm
[56:16] not looking for another sweeping
[56:18] revival. I'm not looking for something
[56:20] but the king is coming so I can be happy
[56:22] because I know he's on his way. He said,
[56:24] "I've heard the It may be hard here. It
[56:27] may be difficult in on this earth. We
[56:29] may be going through a difficult time.
[56:30] You might struggle with depression. You
[56:32] might struggle with fear. You might
[56:34] struggle with those things. But the king
[56:35] is coming." Don't ever forget that,
[56:37] church. Remember, you're looking forward
[56:39] to seeing his face.
[56:43] Does it mean something to you that
[56:44] you're actually, brother JT, going to
[56:45] see him? I believe it does.
[56:54] Hallelujah.
[56:56] The one that we've loved and lived for
[56:59] all these years.
[57:01] It's harder to convince young people of
[57:03] that. And yet young people are more
[57:04] tender. But as we get older, I think we
[57:06] do get a more a greater idea that we
[57:10] want to see him because he can fix
[57:12] everything
[57:14] right where he is. We know everything is
[57:17] okay. We're going to get into that in a
[57:19] moment. We know his kingdom is joy. So
[57:23] if he's coming as king, he's not coming
[57:26] this time to die,
[57:28] right? There's a song that they used to
[57:31] sing this time one more time forever.
[57:34] He's taking his throne as a king.
[57:37] This time he's not coming to be beaten.
[57:39] Yes, sir.
[57:41] Right. We're we're going to go in a
[57:43] rapture. We're going to be at the
[57:44] wedding supper for three and a half
[57:45] years. And he's coming as a king. Amen.
[57:49] He's not coming to be beaten. He's not
[57:50] coming He's not coming to be crucified.
[57:53] He's not coming to be rejected and spit
[57:55] on. But he's coming as a king.
[57:59] And his kingdom is joy. Listen, brother
[58:03] uh Paul says this, "For the kingdom of
[58:05] God is not meat and drink." And he's
[58:08] talking to the Jews who made it just
[58:10] rules and regulation. He said, "That's
[58:12] not what the kingdom of God is." He said
[58:14] if the kingdom of God is here, he said
[58:16] the kingdom of God is righteousness and
[58:18] peace and joy in the Holy Ghost.
[58:22] When he come the first time, we know
[58:25] that they rejoiced.
[58:27] It's okay to be happy when you see
[58:30] evidence of his coming. In Matthew
[58:32] chapter 2 and verse 10, it says, "When
[58:35] they saw the star, they rejoiced with
[58:38] exceeding great joy." That language is
[58:41] interesting. That next slide I've got
[58:43] the the the commentary on it. He said
[58:45] when they saw the star they rejoiced.
[58:46] The language is very strong
[58:50] expressing exuberant transport. It's the
[58:52] only place in the Bible where it's
[58:53] really put together like that. They
[58:54] rejoice with exceeding great joy.
[58:59] Exceeding great joy. Why? They saw a
[59:02] sign. Right now remember they saw it.
[59:05] They followed it all the way across the
[59:08] deserts and everything from the east.
[59:10] And they get there to Jerusalem. And
[59:13] when they do, they they finally reach
[59:16] that place and and they get inside the
[59:18] walls, they lose sight of the star,
[59:21] right? Let's have a little Christmas in
[59:23] June this morning.
[59:26] It was Christmas time and they they saw
[59:28] the star and they went to find it. Took
[59:30] them two years to get there. Remember
[59:33] the journey? Because he was a young
[59:34] child when they found him. But now the
[59:36] star had went before him all of this
[59:38] time. And when it went before him, it it
[59:42] come towards Israel. And they come into
[59:43] the city of Jerusalem expecting to find
[59:46] him there. But they did not find him in
[59:49] those walls. In fact, they couldn't see
[59:52] the star while they were within the
[59:54] walls. But brother Brandham teaches us,
[59:57] he said, he said, "Come take the Bible."
[59:59] He said, "Like the Magi did, and read
[1:00:02] it." Yeah. I believe we still ought to
[1:00:04] read the scripture this morning. I
[1:00:06] believe we'd have more joy in our life
[1:00:08] if we'd read the Bible. Uh because the
[1:00:10] Bible doesn't tell us how how depressed
[1:00:13] we are and how down we are and how
[1:00:14] rotten we are. That's the devil telling
[1:00:16] you that. But the Bible tells you that
[1:00:18] he Jesus come to save you. The Bible
[1:00:20] tells you he loved you so much that he
[1:00:22] he sent his only begotten son of the
[1:00:24] world. The Bible tells you that he heals
[1:00:26] all your diseases. I think if you read
[1:00:28] the Bible, things begin to change. The
[1:00:30] language is is is so strong and and
[1:00:33] positive in the scripture. He he he says
[1:00:36] if you read the scriptures, he said see
[1:00:37] if the scriptures compares with what's
[1:00:40] being done. He said then if it is you've
[1:00:42] got a right.
[1:00:45] Look at your neighbor and say I've got a
[1:00:46] right.
[1:00:49] If you don't have a neighbor look across
[1:00:50] the room and say I got a right.
[1:00:54] I got a right this morning. Amen. He
[1:00:58] said I got You got a right to rejoice
[1:01:00] with exceeding great joy. Amen. Right.
[1:01:03] Again, he said, "When they seen this
[1:01:04] light, was they ever happy." The Bible
[1:01:08] said they rejoiced with exceeding great
[1:01:11] joy. He said, "Oh, I imagine they
[1:01:14] shouted a little bit."
[1:01:18] Don't you imagine? I'm not trying to
[1:01:19] work you up this morning. I told
[1:01:21] somebody, I said, "If I preach I don't I
[1:01:23] wouldn't have to preach against emotion
[1:01:25] for 50 years around here, we still
[1:01:28] wouldn't be too emotional.
[1:01:34] People don't understand, you know,
[1:01:35] sometimes they watch the meetings and
[1:01:36] stuff and them people that running
[1:01:37] usually aren't are running usually
[1:01:39] aren't locals. You know, I know you
[1:01:40] enjoy the presence of the Lord. I I
[1:01:43] don't need everybody to shouting to run.
[1:01:45] I'll tell you this, I I enjoy the
[1:01:47] presence of God. If we ever get to a
[1:01:49] place where we don't enjoy it, we need
[1:01:50] to go back to the beginning again. We
[1:01:52] need to find out what that what what it
[1:01:54] was like when we got saved, what it was
[1:01:55] like to come to the house of God. what
[1:01:57] it was like when we first heard the
[1:01:58] message of the hour and we re recognized
[1:02:00] that we needed to be saved and then we
[1:02:02] were saved. Our sins were forgiven. We
[1:02:04] need to remember what that was like. Go
[1:02:06] back to the first fruits. Find out what
[1:02:08] joy we had at the beginning. That same
[1:02:10] joy still exists today.
[1:02:13] Hallelujah. He said they rejoiced with
[1:02:16] exceeding great joy that he said they
[1:02:17] shout a little bit. Don't you imagine
[1:02:19] so? He says so when they'd seen that old
[1:02:20] organization
[1:02:22] so long back there. Oh my. He said,
[1:02:25] "Trying to find something." He said,
[1:02:27] "Wasn't nothing there."
[1:02:30] Now, some of you know what this feels
[1:02:31] like. You're trying to find something.
[1:02:35] Going from church to church, place to
[1:02:38] place, trying to find something.
[1:02:40] I've been there. I know what it's like.
[1:02:42] I know what it's like to be dragged from
[1:02:44] pillar to post. I know what it's like to
[1:02:45] go from place to place. I know what it's
[1:02:47] like to hear all kinds of different
[1:02:49] things and all kinds of different
[1:02:50] theories, even within the message. But
[1:02:52] one day, I found him. Where did I find
[1:02:54] him? I didn't find him in what somebody
[1:02:56] told me. I didn't find him in a creed or
[1:02:58] a dogma. I found him in the word. And I
[1:03:00] found he's the same yesterday, today,
[1:03:02] and forever. And I found he'd never
[1:03:03] leave me. And he'd heal the sick and
[1:03:05] cleanse the leper. And he's still the
[1:03:07] same God today. Have you found him,
[1:03:09] church? If you found him, you can
[1:03:11] rejoice with exceeding great joy. Amen.
[1:03:15] Hallelujah. He said when he said he said
[1:03:18] there wasn't nothing in that
[1:03:19] organization when they got outside the
[1:03:20] gate. Listen many of you you wandered
[1:03:22] inside the walls of depression and
[1:03:24] alcohol and and drugs and everything
[1:03:26] else and you found out there was no joy
[1:03:28] in it. There was no joy in in the sexual
[1:03:31] things. There was no joy in drugs or
[1:03:33] alcohol. Listen young people, there's no
[1:03:35] joy in any of that. But there's joy in
[1:03:37] the house of the Lord if you can get out
[1:03:39] from behind them walls.
[1:03:42] Huh? Glory. He said they got so happy
[1:03:44] when that star of glory, they seen that
[1:03:46] Holy Ghost light shining yonder, that
[1:03:47] star of glory pulling down upon them,
[1:03:49] they got so happy, they had exceeding
[1:03:50] great joy.
[1:03:52] Or what does the person do when they get
[1:03:54] so overjoyed?
[1:03:56] You say, "Well, brother Ben, I'm happy.
[1:04:00] I am happy."
[1:04:03] Well, when you say that, you know, you
[1:04:06] hear people sing and they're singing joy
[1:04:08] unspeakable. Well, I can't even frown
[1:04:10] right now.
[1:04:15] But they sit there, you know, and just
[1:04:17] they're frowning the whole time. You
[1:04:18] say, "Run them lyrics through your
[1:04:19] brain." You know,
[1:04:23] joy. You know where I got that, don't
[1:04:24] you? Joy unspeakable and full of glory,
[1:04:27] right? That that means something.
[1:04:30] When you're when when you're when you're
[1:04:31] when we sing, when we're in church, like
[1:04:33] we we ought to be able to to actually
[1:04:35] have joy in our hearts. And I'm not
[1:04:37] again, I'm not condemning you. I realize
[1:04:38] the world we live in is tough, but but I
[1:04:41] wonder, you say, "Well, what does a
[1:04:42] person do?" Well, maybe they just sit
[1:04:43] there and and don't do anything. Well,
[1:04:46] not many of us. There are some who are
[1:04:48] very quiet and can be just overjoyed and
[1:04:51] be quiet. And that's okay. We're all
[1:04:53] different. God made us the way we are
[1:04:54] for a reason. Amen. But most people
[1:04:58] react.
[1:04:59] You know how I know that? Because watch
[1:05:02] them at a ball game.
[1:05:04] What does the person do? I'm sorry,
[1:05:07] brother Stewart. What does the person do
[1:05:08] when they get Brother Stewart's
[1:05:10] preaching tonight, so he can correct me
[1:05:11] when they get so overjoyed? What do you
[1:05:13] do at the ball game when they get
[1:05:15] overjoyed? I don't know brother Stewart
[1:05:18] does this at the ball game, but Mr.
[1:05:19] Allison does.
[1:05:24] It's different when your kids are
[1:05:25] playing, isn't it? Right. If your kid's
[1:05:28] the one that hits a home run, that means
[1:05:29] more than Mark Magguire, whoever it is
[1:05:31] that's playing now. That's back from my
[1:05:33] time.
[1:05:36] They get overjoyed. He said, "Oh, you
[1:05:38] holler." And I went and listened to this
[1:05:40] because I wanted to hear how he said it.
[1:05:41] He said it just like they have it out
[1:05:43] here. Harrah, harrah. Bimity bam.
[1:05:47] I have never hollered that or heard
[1:05:49] anybody holler that. But maybe that was
[1:05:51] a thing back in the day. Some of you
[1:05:52] elders could tell me after church. He
[1:05:54] said, "You hollered harrah. Harrah."
[1:05:56] Demity bam. He hit a home run. Haha. Ho
[1:05:59] ho.
[1:06:04] You kids ever did that?
[1:06:07] Oh, come on, brother Wyatt. I Brother
[1:06:09] Wyatt doesn't show a lot of expression,
[1:06:10] but I know when that when that home run
[1:06:13] is hit, man, he likes to see it. If it's
[1:06:16] his team, he just manages to make all
[1:06:18] his teams not his dad's teams. You know,
[1:06:20] he just kind of There's a reason for
[1:06:22] that, isn't there?
[1:06:25] Yeah, Jason's explaining it to me right
[1:06:27] in church. Where's Joel when I need him?
[1:06:33] But but you you get excited, right?
[1:06:36] Means something. I'll be honest with
[1:06:38] you. I I I like baseball and I I
[1:06:40] remember when my team won the World
[1:06:42] Series and I was listening to it after
[1:06:46] church on the parking lot, you know,
[1:06:50] bunch of saints here, isn't it? You
[1:06:52] know,
[1:06:54] I'm always in church. So I' every time
[1:06:56] there's something good happens, I'm in
[1:06:58] church. You know, don't get to hear it.
[1:06:59] Back in the day, we just had to listen
[1:07:01] to the radio. Now they got internet
[1:07:02] clips and things, but we listen to the
[1:07:04] radio and you turn that on. That game's
[1:07:05] still going on. You know, well, they
[1:07:06] must be something good. As soon as you
[1:07:07] hear the score and that the the score,
[1:07:10] that completely controls your mood,
[1:07:11] doesn't it?
[1:07:14] Soon as you hear the score, what do you
[1:07:15] do if it's if they're down 10 runs or a
[1:07:18] touchdown, whatever? You turn it off.
[1:07:22] And if they're up, you turn it up. Why?
[1:07:25] I'm not here to talk about ball games
[1:07:27] this morning, but what he brother said,
[1:07:28] you want to know what does a person do
[1:07:29] when they have joy? He said, what do you
[1:07:31] do at a ball game?
[1:07:33] Right. You you get excited if if I
[1:07:37] wonder sometimes if we really believe
[1:07:38] our team is winning.
[1:07:44] Do we really believe that's that gets
[1:07:48] the down to the really the brass text
[1:07:51] right there. Do we really believe that
[1:07:52] the king is coming? Do we really believe
[1:07:54] he's going to turn things around? Do we
[1:07:56] really believe he's got everything in
[1:07:58] control? I've told you, you either
[1:07:59] believe that all things work together
[1:08:01] for your good or you don't. You either
[1:08:03] believe that you're a child of God and
[1:08:05] that he's going to take care of you and
[1:08:06] he's sovereign in his dealings with you
[1:08:08] and everything's going to be for your
[1:08:10] good or you don't. You either believe
[1:08:12] like Jonah as we talked about Wednesday
[1:08:13] night in the belly of the whale and he's
[1:08:15] in the he's in the very in the bottom of
[1:08:17] the ocean complete darkness and he says
[1:08:20] I'm going to pay my vow and rejoice to
[1:08:22] God cuz I know he's going to get me out
[1:08:24] of this trouble if you know that if you
[1:08:26] got a revelation of it and you can
[1:08:27] rejoice even when things are going bad.
[1:08:30] What do you do at the ball game? He said
[1:08:32] when you get the exceeding great joy and
[1:08:34] holler glory hallelujah praise the Lord.
[1:08:36] He said that's right exceeding great
[1:08:38] joy. There's the star lead us. He said,
[1:08:40] "Oh, take us away from these
[1:08:41] organizations. Lead us to that perfect
[1:08:43] light." G. Hallelujah. He said, "All
[1:08:47] through those great denominational
[1:08:48] streets, they went back and forth
[1:08:50] crying, where is he, sir?" I remember
[1:08:53] what that was like. Amen. Where is he?
[1:08:57] He's born king of the Jews. We long to
[1:08:59] see him. But they couldn't find any
[1:09:01] consolation. Neither could anyone tell
[1:09:04] them. But as soon as something inspired
[1:09:06] them to go out the east side of the gate
[1:09:08] or the west side rather towards
[1:09:09] Bethlehem, the star lit up the road. St.
[1:09:11] Matthew 10:10 said, "And they rejoiced
[1:09:13] with exceeding great joy." I got a hook
[1:09:16] here. I've been preaching here how many
[1:09:17] years.
[1:09:21] They they rejoiced with exceeding great
[1:09:22] joy. They were going, he said they were
[1:09:24] going down Hallelujah Avenue. They were
[1:09:25] going up to signs and Wonder Street and
[1:09:27] they could not rejoice. But when the
[1:09:30] star appeared, the light came back. Oh,
[1:09:32] come on, church. We've seen the light in
[1:09:33] our arrow. We're not waiting to see it.
[1:09:35] I understand you people being dead and
[1:09:38] depressed and everything else if they
[1:09:39] believe they have to wait on something
[1:09:41] else to happen to be happy, something
[1:09:43] else to happen to have the fullness of
[1:09:44] the word. But I'm not waiting on the
[1:09:46] fullness of the word. I receive the
[1:09:48] fullness of the word with the message of
[1:09:49] the hour so I can be happy. Amen.
[1:09:52] Hallelujah. He said as soon as something
[1:09:55] inspired him to go on the east side of
[1:09:56] the gate, west side rather towards
[1:09:57] Bethlehem, the star lit up the road. And
[1:09:59] St. Matthew 10 said they rejoiced with
[1:10:01] exceeding great joy. He said they were
[1:10:03] going down Hallelujah Avenue. They were
[1:10:05] going up Signs and Wonder Street and
[1:10:06] they could not rejoice.
[1:10:09] Pentecost wasn't enough. The Baptist
[1:10:10] church wasn't enough. Drugs and alcohol
[1:10:13] and all of that wasn't enough. They
[1:10:15] could not rejoice. But when the star
[1:10:16] appeared, the light come back. Then they
[1:10:18] were hallelujah. And they were rejoicing
[1:10:20] with exceeding. He said exceeding is
[1:10:22] abundance.
[1:10:23] A whole lots of it. Thank you Lord.
[1:10:26] Great joy.
[1:10:29] I will say we got a little joy.
[1:10:32] But I wonder if we really caught a
[1:10:34] revelation
[1:10:35] good of what happened in our day and
[1:10:38] what's happening continuing to happen in
[1:10:40] our day if we could have exceeding
[1:10:43] abundance a whole lot of great joy. He
[1:10:46] said there was a star when Christ
[1:10:48] reveals himself to you as the
[1:10:50] resurrected son of God. There's an
[1:10:52] exceeding abundance of great joy in your
[1:10:54] heart. Thank you, Lord. You found a
[1:10:56] treasure. You found a pearl that you'll
[1:10:58] sell everything you've got to possess
[1:11:00] it. It's true. Listen, you don't have to
[1:11:02] talk somebody who's found that into
[1:11:04] buying the field. You don't have to talk
[1:11:05] them into going to church. You don't
[1:11:07] have to talk them into living right.
[1:11:08] They found the pearl a great price and
[1:11:10] they're willing to sell everything
[1:11:12] they've got. Isn't that what he did when
[1:11:14] he found you? Turn it around. That's
[1:11:16] what he did when he found you. He He
[1:11:18] gave everything he had. He gave all that
[1:11:20] he was for you. And when we find him, we
[1:11:23] give all that we are to him. Amen.
[1:11:26] Hallelujah.
[1:11:28] Now, I want to ask you this morning,
[1:11:31] if what you found made you miserable,
[1:11:35] I wonder what you found. That's good.
[1:11:40] That's good.
[1:11:42] Well, I found it.
[1:11:45] But but if it made you miserable,
[1:11:49] there's no one more miserable than a
[1:11:50] halfway Christian. Amen. Someone living
[1:11:54] on the borderline.
[1:11:55] can't decide if they really want to be a
[1:11:57] Christian or not. Just waiting on the
[1:11:59] pastor to say something they don't agree
[1:12:00] with so they can leave. Huh? Just
[1:12:04] waiting on the other shoe to drop
[1:12:05] something to find out something about
[1:12:06] the prophet. Say, "Well, well, maybe
[1:12:08] it's this historical fact or this or
[1:12:10] that and we'll find it on this website
[1:12:12] and then we'll leave." Nothing more
[1:12:14] miserable than that.
[1:12:17] See, if what you found makes you
[1:12:19] miserable, you haven't found him.
[1:12:22] All right.
[1:12:24] But when they entered into Jerusalem,
[1:12:26] the star disappeared. That's the
[1:12:28] problem. People followed the light to a
[1:12:31] certain place and then they went into a
[1:12:34] walled city.
[1:12:36] Right? He said, "As long as you look for
[1:12:38] creeds and denominational man to lead
[1:12:39] you to God," he said, "the help of God
[1:12:42] will leave you." All right. But when
[1:12:45] they got sick and tired of it and left
[1:12:47] the creeds and denominations of those
[1:12:49] Jews and went out of Jerusalem, then the
[1:12:51] star appeared again and they rejoiced
[1:12:54] with exceeding great joy. They saw the
[1:12:58] guide again. He said, "Oh, how it is.
[1:13:00] Get on some old cold formal church and
[1:13:04] get back to a good one on fire. See the
[1:13:07] guide leading. What a difference it is."
[1:13:10] Right? So you go into that walled city
[1:13:13] and you can't have any joy because
[1:13:16] they've obscured the light. The light
[1:13:18] won't shine within those denominational
[1:13:21] walls. That's why we can't add a thing
[1:13:22] to the message and we can't take
[1:13:24] anything away.
[1:13:27] Right? No matter how depressed I get or
[1:13:29] sad I get or sorry I get as when I get
[1:13:32] to the pulpit and I read the word of
[1:13:34] God, how can I be depressed about that?
[1:13:37] Right? If I add my emotion, the way my
[1:13:40] my life feels right now to the word and
[1:13:43] present that to you, it builds a walled
[1:13:46] city, a complex,
[1:13:48] right? And and it builds that in your
[1:13:50] mind. If if we if we do that in our
[1:13:52] lives, if we take the word, but we're
[1:13:53] adding to it our feelings, our emotions,
[1:13:56] and and what and our ideas and say,
[1:13:58] "Well, I believe this about the word. I
[1:14:00] believe that about the word." We don't
[1:14:01] add nothing to the word. We just take
[1:14:03] the word for what it is. We don't want
[1:14:05] to build a walled city that keeps the
[1:14:06] light out. We want to be a a free people
[1:14:09] that are able to see where he's leading
[1:14:12] us. Yes, sir. He said, "What a
[1:14:14] difference it is." He said, "When he
[1:14:15] come into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday, they
[1:14:18] rejoice."
[1:14:20] So when the Pharisees criticized them,
[1:14:22] remember, and they said, "You need to
[1:14:24] keep them quiet." A bunch of bunch of
[1:14:26] Pentecostals shouting and worshiping.
[1:14:29] And Jesus said, "If they stop, the rocks
[1:14:31] will cry out." Scriptures being
[1:14:33] fulfilled.
[1:14:35] this day, this scripture is fulfilled.
[1:14:38] You said, "Well, I shouted when I got
[1:14:40] saved. I worshiped when I felt the
[1:14:42] presence of God and my my the tears run
[1:14:44] down my face, but but right now I just
[1:14:46] don't feel it." But listen, he's just as
[1:14:48] worthy today as he was then. And as we
[1:14:52] spoke about Wednesday night and last
[1:14:53] Sunday morning, we're spiritual priests
[1:14:55] offering a spiritual sacrifice to God.
[1:14:58] And so it's it's going to be hard
[1:14:59] sometimes, but we do it anyhow cuz he's
[1:15:02] still Jehovah. He's still the same
[1:15:03] yesterday, today, and forever. And the
[1:15:05] truth is, you've let that emotion that
[1:15:07] you feel wall you up. That's right.
[1:15:10] Until you can't worship God no more.
[1:15:12] Right. But if you get outside that wall,
[1:15:17] right? And so many times what we do, you
[1:15:19] open up a little bit of inside knowledge
[1:15:20] to you. What we doing in the song
[1:15:22] service is we're trying to get you
[1:15:24] outside the wall.
[1:15:28] See, you built a wall of thoughts. You
[1:15:31] built a wall of hurts. You built a wall
[1:15:34] and it's thoughts that don't align with
[1:15:36] the word. That's right. Right. And you
[1:15:39] built that complex and you built it like
[1:15:41] this. And so you you got it all around
[1:15:43] you and if you were outside, you'd see
[1:15:45] the light and worship. Right. But the
[1:15:48] fact that you you got this wall around
[1:15:49] you, you can't see it. You can't
[1:15:51] worship. I'm not saying you have to run
[1:15:52] and jump and shout. I'm saying something
[1:15:54] that affects your heart, something with
[1:15:55] all your heart that you just worship
[1:15:57] God. Some people cry. Some people just
[1:16:00] stand there and worship. But but but
[1:16:01] there's something you're going to do
[1:16:02] something to acknowledge his presence,
[1:16:06] right? But but but here he said when
[1:16:08] when he come the rocks will cry out. So
[1:16:11] if you recognize the light and you
[1:16:14] recognize that you were going to find
[1:16:15] him or that you had found him, you would
[1:16:18] worship. Listen, when he was
[1:16:19] resurrected, there was joy.
[1:16:22] A and now I'm going to go through
[1:16:25] something here because it's important.
[1:16:26] Joy is not the Holy Ghost.
[1:16:29] Joy is an effect of the Holy Ghost. So
[1:16:32] when you lose joy, you don't lose the
[1:16:34] Holy Ghost. Even David with what he did,
[1:16:36] brother Brandon said he did not lose his
[1:16:38] salvation.
[1:16:40] He lost the joy of it. So when he
[1:16:43] prayed, he said, "Restore unto me the
[1:16:45] joy of my salvation."
[1:16:48] And I'm not preaching that say, "Well,
[1:16:50] if people start believing that, they'll
[1:16:51] they'll do whatever they want to do."
[1:16:53] Absolutely. I don't want you doing
[1:16:55] anything you don't want to do. I want
[1:16:57] you to want to go to church. I want you
[1:16:59] to want to serve God, to want to. How
[1:17:01] you going to want to? I can't put that
[1:17:03] in you. That takes the baptism of the
[1:17:04] Holy Ghost.
[1:17:06] But but but you you don't have to
[1:17:08] listen. You don't have to work your way
[1:17:10] into that. That that's there. Once he's
[1:17:12] there, he can't you can't ever be
[1:17:14] unsealed.
[1:17:16] Right. Once you're sealed, you're sealed
[1:17:18] to your destination.
[1:17:20] Well, somebody ought to shout about
[1:17:22] that. Because we've had a lot of bumpy
[1:17:24] rides. We've had a lot of moments when
[1:17:27] we felt like everything was shaken. But
[1:17:29] the inside is still okay. If it was ever
[1:17:31] okay, if he ever accepted us, he'll
[1:17:34] never lose us.
[1:17:39] So, but when he was resurrected, there
[1:17:42] was joy. And this was before they
[1:17:44] received the Holy Ghost. But they had
[1:17:45] joy. Luke 24:52, they worshiped him and
[1:17:48] returned to Jerusalem with great joy.
[1:17:50] They did not yet have the Holy Ghost,
[1:17:51] but they had joy because they knew
[1:17:53] scripture was was had been fulfilled and
[1:17:55] he had promised to come to them. He was
[1:17:58] coming. Amen. On the day of Pentecost,
[1:18:00] he came. So the Lutheran rejoiced. You
[1:18:03] know, we know that they rejoiced in
[1:18:04] justification in what they knew. The
[1:18:06] just shall live by faith. The westerns
[1:18:08] rejoiced in sanctification and pure
[1:18:10] lives. And I I've seen them even in that
[1:18:12] uh the old old time holiness church and
[1:18:14] western church how they would rejoice in
[1:18:16] sanctification entire sanctification.
[1:18:19] The Pentecost was rejoiced in the
[1:18:21] restoration of gifts, right? They
[1:18:23] rejoiced in that in that age of of the
[1:18:26] Holy Ghost and and the baptism even on
[1:18:28] the outer realm. They rejoiced in that.
[1:18:30] But we know that the full word was not
[1:18:32] born until the opening of the seals,
[1:18:36] right? So there there was a time when oh
[1:18:39] my was a time when the magi were were
[1:18:42] were in Jerusalem and they were walled
[1:18:43] off and there was a time they saw the
[1:18:45] light but there was a time they found
[1:18:47] the literal form of the baby Jesus
[1:18:50] laying in the manger right and that was
[1:18:52] the fullness of God. It was all of the
[1:18:54] Old Testament scriptures wrapped up in a
[1:18:56] body, but it was in an infant form and
[1:18:59] they could not recognize him when he
[1:19:01] came, many of them, but the magi did
[1:19:03] because they followed the sign to the
[1:19:06] person,
[1:19:08] right? Brother said there was a voice
[1:19:10] following the sign. So when we saw the
[1:19:12] message of the hour, that's why things
[1:19:14] don't shake us. People say, "Well,
[1:19:15] there's signs over here, signs over
[1:19:17] there." But we're not following a sign
[1:19:18] anymore. We followed the sign. Amen. To
[1:19:22] the person. That's good. Right. We've
[1:19:24] Hallelujah. We followed the pillar of
[1:19:26] fire to the word. That's good. I don't
[1:19:29] ever and I don't say you couldn't see
[1:19:31] it. You may see it, but I don't ever
[1:19:33] have to see the pillar of fire again.
[1:19:35] Joshua never saw it that we know of.
[1:19:37] It's never recorded that Joshua saw it.
[1:19:39] But to brother Brandon said, the pillar
[1:19:40] of fire that was with Moses become the
[1:19:42] person of the captain of the host that
[1:19:44] was with Joshua.
[1:19:46] Come on, church. We're living in that
[1:19:48] time. This message brought us out, but
[1:19:50] it takes us in. I know there's some
[1:19:52] depth to that, but I believe you can
[1:19:54] grasp it this morning. This message
[1:19:55] didn't leave us in just just in the land
[1:19:58] in the wilderness wandering around, but
[1:19:59] it actually took us in and placed us.
[1:20:01] And here we're not following the sign,
[1:20:03] but we've actually found him. And if you
[1:20:05] go back and look, when the magi found
[1:20:07] him, they worshiped during that time.
[1:20:09] They didn't just rejoice when they saw
[1:20:11] the sign, but they rejoiced when they
[1:20:13] found the person.
[1:20:17] Now,
[1:20:19] the full word was not born the opening
[1:20:20] of seals. You say, "Why can you say
[1:20:22] that?" And how can you say emphatically
[1:20:25] that the full word was open then?
[1:20:28] That's why we don't believe brother
[1:20:29] Brandham has to come back to do that.
[1:20:31] That's right. Right. Because the full
[1:20:32] word was open then.
[1:20:35] Right. And that's not any reflection on
[1:20:36] anybody that believes that. It's just
[1:20:38] it's just what I've seen in the message.
[1:20:40] Right. And I believe you've seen that as
[1:20:42] well that the opening of the word, we
[1:20:44] don't look at the word through the
[1:20:45] blinders of some idea. But we look at it
[1:20:48] what brother Brandham said, right? Look
[1:20:51] at what brother Brandham said. He said
[1:20:52] the day that the denomination crucified
[1:20:54] the word of God and accepted a creed
[1:20:56] instead of the word, that's the day the
[1:20:59] word came into full effect.
[1:21:03] That's just been recently.
[1:21:08] You realize that the veil was rent from
[1:21:11] top to bottom. You remember when Jesus
[1:21:13] was crucified,
[1:21:14] one thing had to be happening for the
[1:21:16] other to happen.
[1:21:18] You can't have an indictment without the
[1:21:20] mercy seat coming in plain view.
[1:21:23] You can't have a ceasing of the old
[1:21:25] system.
[1:21:27] Hallelujah.
[1:21:29] Without the new
[1:21:31] covenant coming into effect.
[1:21:33] So, brother Brandham said that the
[1:21:35] denomination, you realize how important
[1:21:36] the sermon indictment is. Brother
[1:21:38] Brandham said they," he said, "I indict
[1:21:39] this generation for crucifying the son
[1:21:42] of God. Aresh, right?" He said, "I
[1:21:44] indict you preachers. I indict you
[1:21:45] denomination." He said, "I indict you
[1:21:47] non-denominational."
[1:21:49] He said that have that made the word of
[1:21:51] God of none effect by your traditions.
[1:21:53] And when he preached that, what
[1:21:54] happened? He's preaching that and he
[1:21:56] makes this statement in the indictment.
[1:21:57] He said he said the word the only he
[1:21:59] said that's the word coming to full
[1:22:00] effect. the day that the denominations
[1:22:02] forsook him is the day the word come
[1:22:04] into full effect. He said that's just
[1:22:05] been recently. He preaches a few months
[1:22:07] after the opening of the seals. Right?
[1:22:09] He said that's just been recently. So
[1:22:11] the full word had to come into effect
[1:22:13] during that time. It had to. Right? So
[1:22:17] again, if brother Brandham come back or
[1:22:20] maybe not that maybe we're not tempted
[1:22:23] by that, but if some preacher come along
[1:22:25] and say, "Well, I'm a prophet. I've got
[1:22:26] things to say."
[1:22:28] He'd have nothing to say that would
[1:22:30] matter to us.
[1:22:36] Are you with me now? I've got nothing to
[1:22:39] say that's essential to your salvation,
[1:22:41] but I can point you to the fullness of
[1:22:43] the of Christ who's come in our day. Are
[1:22:46] you with me? The only things I can say
[1:22:48] that are essential to salvation are
[1:22:50] those things he already said. I can have
[1:22:52] my ideas about things and the way things
[1:22:54] ought to be. But the only things
[1:22:56] essential to salvation are those things
[1:22:58] he already said plainly. Because if it
[1:23:00] was not so, the word would not have been
[1:23:02] born into effect. But the word came into
[1:23:04] full effect at the opening of the seals.
[1:23:08] Amen. There's a couple of more examples.
[1:23:11] I'll use one of them. Brother Brandham
[1:23:13] in things that are to be in 1965 he
[1:23:16] talked about how he said one day he said
[1:23:18] that people believe that we were just
[1:23:20] floating like a cloud. Did you know
[1:23:22] brother Brandham believed that?
[1:23:25] Right. He believed that. He preaches
[1:23:27] that in the Hebrew series how that he
[1:23:30] said we won't be able to shake hands
[1:23:32] when we get there. But the opening the
[1:23:35] full word came into manifestation.
[1:23:38] Right? And when it come into
[1:23:40] manifestation, brother Brandham says
[1:23:41] this. He said, "But that was a
[1:23:43] conception that they had before the
[1:23:46] fullness of the word come into
[1:23:49] existence.
[1:23:52] These mag, they didn't know what they
[1:23:54] were going to find.
[1:23:56] They had no idea what they were going to
[1:23:57] find. They just knew a king had been
[1:23:59] born.
[1:24:01] They found him in a manger. The
[1:24:02] specifics were hidden until they found
[1:24:04] him. And when they found him, he was
[1:24:07] complete. Amen. He was a baby, but he
[1:24:11] was all of God wrapped up in flesh.
[1:24:15] Are you with me now? He was a baby, but
[1:24:17] he was Jehovah.
[1:24:19] But the brother said, "Was little
[1:24:20] Jehovah playing in the street. Little
[1:24:22] Jehovah with his friends. Little Jehovah
[1:24:25] crying in a manger. What was it?" The
[1:24:27] fullness of the word in a body.
[1:24:30] They weren't looking for something else
[1:24:32] once they found him. But they bypassed
[1:24:34] Jerusalem going back. Remember, they
[1:24:36] didn't go back to that old denomination,
[1:24:38] but they b they had found him. And so,
[1:24:40] they went back home rejoicing because
[1:24:42] they had found the fullness of the word
[1:24:44] coming into existence in the world.
[1:24:45] Don't you realize that's what you found
[1:24:47] today? You can rejoice because you found
[1:24:49] the fullness of the word coming into
[1:24:51] existence. I hope that's not too hard
[1:24:52] for you to grasp.
[1:24:54] Right? During denomination, we saw
[1:24:56] glimpses of him. Glimpses of him. But
[1:24:59] before the rapture,
[1:25:01] he had to come in word form in his
[1:25:03] fullness.
[1:25:05] Right? Now look, just as he come then in
[1:25:08] body form, now he had to come in word
[1:25:10] form, in his fullness. He said that was
[1:25:12] a conception they had before the
[1:25:15] fullness of the word come into existence
[1:25:17] or the opening of the seven seals that's
[1:25:20] promised to us in this age that we then
[1:25:23] understand.
[1:25:27] Brother Brandon doesn't, as far as I
[1:25:28] remember, he doesn't even talk in the
[1:25:30] seals, in those sermons about
[1:25:33] heaven in that way, other than the dream
[1:25:35] he had about his wife and and and those
[1:25:38] things. But he doesn't even talk about
[1:25:39] heaven. But aren't you glad we know that
[1:25:41] they have bodies? Amen. Amen. that if
[1:25:45] you went home, brother Herold, God
[1:25:47] forbid that you would go home, you know,
[1:25:49] and and and early or I say early, but
[1:25:53] you know, if you would go home now today
[1:25:56] and Harold's lived a good long life, but
[1:25:57] if you went at home now today or or one
[1:26:00] of the others, one of the other people
[1:26:01] in the church and you got there and
[1:26:05] you're like just all floating around,
[1:26:08] I wish I could give them a hug.
[1:26:13] That's right. Wish I could, you know,
[1:26:16] this doesn't feel like a real
[1:26:17] conversation talking from a mist, a
[1:26:20] cloud,
[1:26:22] playing my harp, you know, sitting on a
[1:26:24] cloud just doesn't feel like very good.
[1:26:28] But when the word come into existence,
[1:26:31] we could see him as he was.
[1:26:34] So, we believe and you know, even
[1:26:36] denominations, I've noticed a lot of
[1:26:38] them will teach that now, well, when you
[1:26:39] go to heaven, you have a body. They
[1:26:41] don't even know where they get that
[1:26:42] from. That's right. The full word
[1:26:44] coming. There was a there was
[1:26:45] inspiration, a full word come into
[1:26:47] effect in our day. I know I'm taking my
[1:26:49] time this morning, but I just want to
[1:26:50] lay this in where we where we understand
[1:26:52] it in a simple enough way that we can
[1:26:54] grab a hold of it. The full word had to
[1:26:56] come into existence for us to know that,
[1:26:57] but the brand doesn't even address it as
[1:26:59] far as I remember in the seals. But it
[1:27:01] was the opening of the seals that broke
[1:27:02] the revelation,
[1:27:04] right, of the of the whole message. The
[1:27:06] entire message was was the revelation of
[1:27:09] Christ.
[1:27:10] Are you with me now? So it's the opening
[1:27:13] of the word that brought us these
[1:27:14] things. Listen. So when we find joy, now
[1:27:18] joy is not the Holy Ghost himself. It's
[1:27:20] an effect of the Holy Ghost. They had
[1:27:23] joy at the sign right before they found
[1:27:26] him. But joy is a fruit of finding of
[1:27:29] knowing that the sign has appeared and
[1:27:31] of finding the person. Uh it's a fruit
[1:27:33] of it. Brother Brandham uses Acts 19 as
[1:27:35] an example of that. He said they already
[1:27:36] rejoiced. The Holy Ghost was there. uh
[1:27:39] they were anointed them on the outer
[1:27:40] outward realm but Paul gets there and
[1:27:42] says how were you baptized right and
[1:27:44] they said we were baptized in John's
[1:27:45] baptism and he said he said have you
[1:27:48] received the Holy Ghost since you
[1:27:49] believed he said we don't know if there
[1:27:50] be a Holy Ghost and so he baptized them
[1:27:52] they received the Holy Ghost and had joy
[1:27:53] all over again right so joy itself just
[1:27:57] because you feel joy that's not the Holy
[1:27:58] Spirit but the Holy Spirit does bring
[1:28:00] joy it's his spirit in you that makes
[1:28:03] the word flesh but Pentecost thought
[1:28:06] that joy was all of it But joy is just a
[1:28:09] fruit of the spirit. So we don't build a
[1:28:11] denominational camp around joy. Joy is
[1:28:14] just a fruit of the spirit. So when we
[1:28:17] know he's here, right? Like the magi
[1:28:19] finding Jesus saying in the manger, he's
[1:28:21] here. He's come, right? We don't not
[1:28:23] looking for nothing else. He's here. Our
[1:28:24] journey is over. Our journey of
[1:28:27] discovery is over. We found him. We can
[1:28:29] know more about him. But we found him.
[1:28:33] Are you with me now? That's the message
[1:28:34] of the hour, church. If we could just
[1:28:36] realize the importance of it and Satan's
[1:28:39] going to do everything he can to pull
[1:28:41] you away from that, pull you away from
[1:28:42] the influence of the message of the
[1:28:44] hour. Pull you away, say, "Well, it
[1:28:45] doesn't really matter. We don't really
[1:28:47] teach those things and we don't really
[1:28:48] believe those things anymore." Yes, we
[1:28:50] do. Why? Because that was the word being
[1:28:52] born in its fullness. Brother Brandon
[1:28:55] taught us not in the preparation. He
[1:28:56] said, "But there come a time when the
[1:28:58] word was born
[1:29:01] in full effect."
[1:29:03] Are you with me now?
[1:29:06] So when he's present in his fullness,
[1:29:07] there's joy in the camp. Not an external
[1:29:10] joy from sweeping revivals, but an
[1:29:11] internal joy from seeing the word made
[1:29:13] manifest.
[1:29:15] I I I see these Y'all going to think I'm
[1:29:17] a real sinner, but sometimes I I watch
[1:29:20] these things on Facebook, these reels,
[1:29:23] and for some reason it always shows me
[1:29:25] church stuff and so or most of the time
[1:29:28] fishing stuff and church stuff. And so
[1:29:30] when I go on there, the algorithm knows
[1:29:32] me. And when I go on there, you know, it
[1:29:34] it's these dancing videos. Have you seen
[1:29:36] this? Like there's just a phenomena of
[1:29:38] it right now that everybody's dancing in
[1:29:39] that in church. And there's nothing
[1:29:42] wrong with that. Nothing wrong with
[1:29:43] dancing, but a lot of it is nonsense,
[1:29:46] right? They're dancing and brother
[1:29:48] talked about that choir with their
[1:29:49] painted faces and everything just looked
[1:29:51] awful and and how that they they didn't
[1:29:53] follow the word in their lives, but they
[1:29:54] still sang and he talked about how awful
[1:29:56] that was. Well, that's just the way it
[1:29:58] is. Just it just becomes like it's good
[1:29:59] entertainment,
[1:30:01] right? It's joy without the person.
[1:30:06] Are you with me now? But what what are
[1:30:08] they dancing about? See, what are they
[1:30:10] dancing about now? Brother Brandham says
[1:30:12] this. He said, "Don't go with that crowd
[1:30:14] that's moving on yonder, friend. That
[1:30:15] led us to a church age. It could jump up
[1:30:18] and down, dance under music, lukewarm,
[1:30:23] right?" Didn't say it was ice cold now.
[1:30:25] It said it was lukewarm. That's
[1:30:26] Pentecostal. He said, "And don't know
[1:30:28] that it's miserable, wretched, blind."
[1:30:30] Amen. Blind to what? The word. To the
[1:30:34] manifestation of the word because it
[1:30:35] never come through their organization.
[1:30:37] They cannot receive it. Oh, I wonder how
[1:30:39] many people even today around the
[1:30:40] message, we get to the point where we
[1:30:42] can't receive it because it didn't come
[1:30:43] in our organization. It didn't come
[1:30:45] among our group of ministers. It didn't
[1:30:47] come through our favorite preacher. So,
[1:30:50] we can't receive it. But the word has
[1:30:51] been born in our hour. If you can see
[1:30:53] him, if you can find him today, you can
[1:30:55] still find revival. You can still find
[1:30:57] joy at the opening of the word.
[1:31:01] But he said there's some people just
[1:31:02] live upon the emotions. Some people say,
[1:31:03] "Well, we got a lot of that in our
[1:31:04] Pentecostal movement. They will go in,
[1:31:06] which is fine. They'll pat their hands
[1:31:07] and play the music." He said the music
[1:31:09] stops and he said, "A bucket of water
[1:31:12] went over everything." He said, "See,
[1:31:14] now we do that. We get in a habit of
[1:31:15] doing that." He said, "It just become
[1:31:17] one of our customs." He said, "When
[1:31:18] you're worshiping God in the spirit and
[1:31:20] in truth, when it becomes a custom for
[1:31:21] you to do it because you think you ought
[1:31:23] to do it because you think if you don't
[1:31:24] shout or jump up and down or dance with
[1:31:26] the music, your neighbor is going to
[1:31:27] think you're back." said, he said,
[1:31:28] "You're drinking from a stagnated
[1:31:30] stream." He said, "Until it fills every
[1:31:32] fiber." Well, that's what we want this
[1:31:34] morning. We don't want just a temporary
[1:31:36] thing. We want it to fill every fiber of
[1:31:38] our being. We want it to be over the
[1:31:40] right thing. If we dance, let us dance
[1:31:42] over the word being revealed at our
[1:31:43] hour. If we sing, let us sing about the
[1:31:46] fullness of God that's come to us. But
[1:31:48] the revelation that we have, that we
[1:31:50] can't be lost, that he's going to take
[1:31:52] care of us. That ought to mean something
[1:31:53] to us. That's why some of these songs
[1:31:55] that are written don't mean anything to
[1:31:56] us. But some of them mean something to
[1:31:57] us because maybe the writer didn't even
[1:31:59] understand. But we understand what it
[1:32:01] means to have sins forgiven. We
[1:32:03] understand what it means to say all is
[1:32:05] well. We understand what it means.
[1:32:07] Hallelujah.
[1:32:09] Amen. We there's something inside of us
[1:32:11] that knows when we we sing a song like
[1:32:13] my God is awesome. I know some people
[1:32:14] don't like that song, but to me, when I
[1:32:17] think about it, I don't think about some
[1:32:19] some just song out here, but I think
[1:32:21] about the awesomeness of God that was
[1:32:23] revealed to us in the message of the
[1:32:25] hour, that he existed before time, that
[1:32:28] he was Elohim.
[1:32:33] [Laughter]
[1:32:38] So easy to get back and lukewarm.
[1:32:41] Maybe in church we still act the part.
[1:32:46] There's got to be something in our heart
[1:32:49] that still loves the word.
[1:32:53] And we get to where we want to be in
[1:32:55] church. Not because
[1:32:57] not because we're afraid of what
[1:32:58] somebody might say, but because there's
[1:33:01] something in our heart that cries out
[1:33:02] for the truth, cries out for the word.
[1:33:05] and cries out to be a light and to be a
[1:33:07] fellowship to others and for fellowship.
[1:33:12] Brother Brandon said that's God's
[1:33:13] satisfying portion. He said, "I don't
[1:33:15] care whe the music is playing, whether
[1:33:16] they're playing near my God to thee or
[1:33:17] whatever it is." He said, "The Holy
[1:33:19] Spirit is still ringing the glory bells
[1:33:21] in your heart." That satisfies that's
[1:33:23] God's satisfying portion. He said,
[1:33:25] "Anything less than that, you're done."
[1:33:26] He references 1 Corinthians 13. He said,
[1:33:28] "If I have not love, I'm become as a
[1:33:30] sounding brass and tinkling symbol." He
[1:33:32] said, "No, there's a good thing to
[1:33:33] worship in the spirit." That's true. But
[1:33:35] sometimes you have spirit without truth.
[1:33:37] St. John 4 said, "We worship God spirit
[1:33:39] and truth." Someone say it with me.
[1:33:41] Spirit and truth. So we don't have
[1:33:44] church without the truth. We believe in
[1:33:47] the word. We believe in the preaching of
[1:33:48] the word. If we're going to go long in
[1:33:50] something, let's go long in the word.
[1:33:53] And I try not to hold you long, but what
[1:33:55] I'm saying is let let's make that the
[1:33:56] the the main effect of the service. But
[1:33:59] I also want us to worship because I
[1:34:01] recognize the value of worship. And I
[1:34:03] want to give time for every priest and
[1:34:05] every king to bring their sacrifice of
[1:34:07] praise before the altar of God.
[1:34:11] He said we must worship him in spirit
[1:34:12] and truth and Jesus is the truth. That's
[1:34:14] exactly right. He is the word.
[1:34:17] Listen, when they receive the disciples
[1:34:19] receive the Holy Ghost, they had the
[1:34:20] person of Jesus with them and in them
[1:34:22] and they had great joy. They had the
[1:34:23] fullness of the word and the spirit. A
[1:34:26] and yet can I just tell you my heart
[1:34:28] today and we'll close at the appropriate
[1:34:30] time. But uh there's a feeling today
[1:34:33] that we've grown beyond joy, that
[1:34:36] somehow we've matured past it and joy is
[1:34:39] good for the kids and the youth camps.
[1:34:42] But for us, we've kind of gotten older
[1:34:46] and we wear our neck ties correctly and
[1:34:49] our clothes match. And I brought the
[1:34:52] wrong coat this morning. That's why I
[1:34:53] didn't wear it out here. Don't fit no
[1:34:55] more.
[1:34:56] And we realize that that, you know, we
[1:34:59] gotten older and and we're more put
[1:35:01] together.
[1:35:03] We can't cry no more. We don't worship
[1:35:05] no more. That's for the kids.
[1:35:08] Well, I wonder, church. I wonder if
[1:35:11] that's sometimes why we don't suffer in
[1:35:12] in our services at times because we
[1:35:15] missed our moment. We miss our moment.
[1:35:18] When it's our time to worship God, we
[1:35:20] just let it go cuz well, the service
[1:35:22] going to be over after a while and I got
[1:35:23] things to do. Well, yeah, but you got
[1:35:26] things to do in church, too.
[1:35:28] Bring that sacrifice of praise. Again,
[1:35:32] I'm not trying to make you all a bunch
[1:35:33] of a bunch of people that jump up and
[1:35:35] down. I went to Pentecostal church one
[1:35:36] time where they jumped in unison and the
[1:35:38] whole service, one side went up, the
[1:35:40] other side went down. I tell you what,
[1:35:42] they lost weight. They had a bunch of
[1:35:44] people in fit in that church.
[1:35:46] All except the preacher. He's a big guy.
[1:35:50] But he wasn't jumping. They were all
[1:35:52] jumping. Every time you make a good
[1:35:54] point, they play the music and they just
[1:35:55] jump the whole service. Uh, we're not
[1:35:57] trying to get that. We're not trying. We
[1:35:59] want you to be an individual and to
[1:36:01] worship God in the way that God has made
[1:36:03] you, but worship him. Give it all of
[1:36:05] your heart.
[1:36:07] Don't give more to a ball game than you
[1:36:09] would the word. Don't give more to a
[1:36:10] television program than you would the
[1:36:12] word. Don't give more to to another
[1:36:14] person than you would the person of
[1:36:16] Jesus Christ.
[1:36:19] See, we've been restored. They say,
[1:36:21] "Well, we we matured past that because
[1:36:23] we have something different." And that
[1:36:25] is true, right? We do have something
[1:36:28] different. We're being restored back to
[1:36:29] Eden. Brother Brand said, "The word that
[1:36:30] fell on the day of Pentecost will not
[1:36:31] work this day." No, sir. That was for
[1:36:33] Pentecost. This is for the bride, the
[1:36:35] going home of the bride. We got
[1:36:36] something different. The Pentecost has
[1:36:38] represented that again. We're in the
[1:36:39] bride age. And I think that's why some
[1:36:42] people that that they're longing for
[1:36:44] return of of healing meetings. I said
[1:36:47] before a lot of people that are against
[1:36:49] prayer lines would not be against prayer
[1:36:51] lines if brother Brandon was here.
[1:36:56] They just don't believe God moves like
[1:36:58] that no more.
[1:37:00] Right? But they they're against prayer
[1:37:03] lines because they don't believe that
[1:37:05] there's anybody qualified to pray. But
[1:37:07] the Bible said these signs shall follow
[1:37:09] them that believe. And brother Brandham
[1:37:11] tells us, he said, "Your pastor or any
[1:37:13] other preacher is as qualified as I am
[1:37:14] to lay his hands on the sick. We don't
[1:37:17] have the gift that he did or the the
[1:37:19] ministry, the the calling he did one to
[1:37:21] an age, but we do have we do have the
[1:37:23] right to pray for the sick." But but you
[1:37:26] get thinking about that and say, "Well,
[1:37:27] maybe we have moved past. We got
[1:37:29] something different. Maybe we don't need
[1:37:30] joy anymore. Maybe we just need to sit
[1:37:32] and and just, you know, just smile at
[1:37:35] each other once in a while." And, you
[1:37:37] know, sounds good. takes out a lot of
[1:37:39] the work, you know, and we don't really
[1:37:41] have to be on fire to do that. We just
[1:37:42] sit in church and hear the word and
[1:37:43] somehow miraculously it's going to
[1:37:44] transform us into something. And and and
[1:37:47] take us in a rapture. But I I want to
[1:37:51] prove to you if I can that that's not
[1:37:52] right by asking this question. And and
[1:37:55] and again, I'm not going to hold you
[1:37:57] long, but I just want to get through
[1:37:58] this. Why is the Pentecostal Leodysian
[1:38:01] age so deceptive?
[1:38:04] The Bible says that, think about it
[1:38:06] before you answer it in your mind, think
[1:38:08] about it. Why are they so deceptive? The
[1:38:10] Bible said, "There shall rise false
[1:38:11] Christ, false prophets, shall show great
[1:38:14] signs and wonders, and so much if we're
[1:38:15] possible, they shall deceive the very
[1:38:16] elect." That's scripture. So when we say
[1:38:19] the Pentecostal age, I'm talking about
[1:38:20] all of it. I'm not singling out the
[1:38:21] Pentecostal church. There's wonderful
[1:38:22] people in the Pentecostal church, but
[1:38:25] but all of it today. The modern movement
[1:38:27] of worship and praise and all of this,
[1:38:30] right? signs and wonders, television
[1:38:32] preachers,
[1:38:35] all the ages of deceit. Brother said
[1:38:37] from the Garden of Eden all the way
[1:38:39] down, there's never been an age so
[1:38:40] deceptive as this age. False prophets
[1:38:43] will rise and show signs and wonders if
[1:38:44] possible to deceive the very elected.
[1:38:47] Now look, brother Brandon said, "Now
[1:38:49] just a cold, formal, starchy churches
[1:38:51] and so forth of man-made theology that
[1:38:54] wouldn't the elect would never pay no
[1:38:57] attention to that. Right? He said, "But
[1:39:01] it's almost up there, almost like the
[1:39:04] real thing.
[1:39:06] It's deceptive because its
[1:39:08] characteristics are also the
[1:39:11] characteristics of the seed,
[1:39:13] right? The shuck is deceptive because it
[1:39:16] looks like the seed.
[1:39:19] I hope I'm not putting you to sleep this
[1:39:20] morning. This is important. It's
[1:39:22] deceptive because it feels good."
[1:39:25] And I know people say, "Well, okay, we
[1:39:27] just won't have any shouting. We won't
[1:39:29] have any worship. We won't have any
[1:39:30] music. And then we won't be deceptive.
[1:39:32] Well, you're not anything.
[1:39:36] You're going back to a stalk.
[1:39:39] Are you with me now? It'd be like a
[1:39:42] business if you're you know there's
[1:39:43] counterfeit $100 bills floating around.
[1:39:45] You don't you don't stop taking $100
[1:39:47] bills. You want the $100 bills, but what
[1:39:50] do you do without you mark them and make
[1:39:53] you check them, make sure they're right.
[1:39:55] We don't want to do away with worship.
[1:39:57] We don't want to do away with gifts. We
[1:39:59] But we will check everyone by the word.
[1:40:02] We don't want to do away with shouting,
[1:40:04] but we check it by the word. We shout
[1:40:06] whether we feel like it or not. We we we
[1:40:07] we worship whether we feel like it or
[1:40:09] not. We don't just worship by music. We
[1:40:12] worship by because he's worthy of our
[1:40:14] praise.
[1:40:18] It's deceptive because it has joy and
[1:40:20] praise and makes you feel good, but it's
[1:40:21] hollow. It's a good shot. Brother
[1:40:23] Brandham said they rejoice, but they
[1:40:25] haven't found him. Right? They saw the
[1:40:27] sign, but they didn't find him. But
[1:40:29] don't stop when you see the light. Don't
[1:40:31] stop when you see the sign. Go find him
[1:40:33] where the word said he would be. But the
[1:40:35] Brandon said, and speaking of the sla
[1:40:37] said she denies the word to make Matthew
[1:40:39] 24:24 real to her, she tries to move in
[1:40:42] with a lot of noise, a lot of this, a
[1:40:43] lot of social standings and things like
[1:40:44] that, trying to say, "Well, we got
[1:40:46] power. Glory to God. Hallelujah. We got
[1:40:48] power. Having a form of godliness, but
[1:40:49] denying the power thereof so close it
[1:40:51] would deceive the very elected." The
[1:40:54] bride church will not be a powerless
[1:40:56] church. It will be a church that is
[1:40:58] Pentecostal in its nature.
[1:41:01] But they'll have that plus. Someone say
[1:41:04] it with me. That plus. We have
[1:41:06] everything that Luther had, everything
[1:41:07] that Wesley had, everything that
[1:41:09] Pentecost had. Plus, we found him. The
[1:41:13] opening of the word is the complete body
[1:41:15] of Jesus Christ. It's the seed in it in
[1:41:18] its full form. Listen. He said, "Having
[1:41:21] a form of godliness, but denying the
[1:41:22] power that so close it would deceive the
[1:41:24] very elected, how can a man dance in the
[1:41:26] spirit and speak in tongues and deny the
[1:41:27] word of God being the truth?" There's
[1:41:30] the question. Be the Holy Ghost. It just
[1:41:32] can't be done. Why was the Pentecostal
[1:41:34] age so deceptive? Because it was so much
[1:41:36] like the real.
[1:41:39] But our focus is not on gifts. It's not
[1:41:41] on emotion. Our focus is and ought to be
[1:41:44] him.
[1:41:46] Him.
[1:41:49] The Brown said, "This is my ministry."
[1:41:50] To declare him, "He's here." His
[1:41:55] ministry paralleled John the Baptist. I
[1:41:57] thought of that as I showed some of the
[1:41:59] brothers in the back. Brother Nathan
[1:42:00] Ericen was traveling through and he
[1:42:02] stopped in Hot Springs yesterday. And
[1:42:03] when he stopped there, he he saw his
[1:42:06] granddad, his mom's uh dad, I believe it
[1:42:10] was, was uh Brother Samuel Johnson. Many
[1:42:13] of you know remember that name from the
[1:42:15] past. Brother Samuel Johnson was a a
[1:42:17] great preacher back in the day. Just
[1:42:18] passed away recently, but he was in the
[1:42:21] meetings in 1963 when brother Brandon
[1:42:23] preached once more and a greater than
[1:42:24] Solomon is here and those services in at
[1:42:26] the ABC campgrounds in uh in Hot
[1:42:29] Springs. Brother Nathan Erikson was
[1:42:31] driving back through there the other
[1:42:33] day, driving back from a wedding
[1:42:34] yesterday and he stopped there and he
[1:42:36] texted some of us brothers. He told us
[1:42:38] he said he said I found he said laying
[1:42:40] on a shelf a magazine and he found a a a
[1:42:43] picture of his granddad introducing
[1:42:46] brother Brandham and his granddad
[1:42:48] standing in the pulpit a young man back
[1:42:50] then he's standing in the pulpit he said
[1:42:52] and now brother Brandham and he turned
[1:42:54] and walked away and brother Brandham
[1:42:57] come to the pulpit and that changed that
[1:43:00] family's history and that life and and
[1:43:03] everything about it and many many
[1:43:04] people's lives and affected many
[1:43:06] people's lives
[1:43:07] because he come across the path of the
[1:43:09] messenger and saw the message and
[1:43:11] followed it and then generations of
[1:43:13] believers have come after that.
[1:43:15] Literally hundreds of believers have
[1:43:16] come after that. But don't the the
[1:43:18] thought occurred to me that here come
[1:43:20] here come the man he stood there and he
[1:43:22] said now brother Brandham and he moves
[1:43:23] from the side. Do you realize what
[1:43:25] brother Brandham did? Do you realize
[1:43:26] what he did church? He stood here for 33
[1:43:29] years. He stood on the earth behind the
[1:43:31] pulpit. I didn't take him out of the
[1:43:32] pulpit. God did. What did he do? He
[1:43:35] stood behind the pulpit and he preached
[1:43:38] and he said this day the scripture is
[1:43:40] fulfilled and Christ is the mystery of
[1:43:42] God revealed. What was he doing? He's
[1:43:44] saying and now
[1:43:47] Glory to God.
[1:43:50] And now the Lord Jesus Christ and he
[1:43:55] stepped out of the way.
[1:43:59] And who stepped into the pulpit? Not me.
[1:44:02] Not another preacher. Christ.
[1:44:07] Ain't that powerful? Mr. Go. That's what
[1:44:09] happened. Just like if I would stand
[1:44:11] here and then move out of the way to
[1:44:12] give the pulpit to another preacher. He
[1:44:14] moved out of the way. He said, "I must
[1:44:15] decrease that he might increase." What
[1:44:18] was Christ? The word that he brought.
[1:44:24] So our focus is not on gifts. It's not
[1:44:26] an emotion. But it's on him who he
[1:44:28] introduced us to.
[1:44:31] Hallelujah. It's on the one he
[1:44:33] introduced us to. This is my ministry to
[1:44:35] declare him that he's here. Listen, he
[1:44:37] said about the time the prophet turned,
[1:44:39] he's talking about John in the water,
[1:44:41] he's he's prophesying about Christ and
[1:44:43] he said, "Behold, there comes the lamb
[1:44:45] of God that takes away the sin of the
[1:44:46] world." Now, what's the attraction
[1:44:48] that's changed from the prophet to his
[1:44:50] prophecy? What was it? Why did brother
[1:44:51] Brandham have to leave right after the
[1:44:53] opening of the word? Why did he have to
[1:44:55] leave the scene right after just a few
[1:44:57] years of preaching to us after the
[1:44:58] opening of the word? What happened? The
[1:45:00] attraction had to change from the
[1:45:02] prophet to the prophecies.
[1:45:04] Listen, he said the seventh angel
[1:45:05] messenger say, "Behold the lamb of God
[1:45:07] that takes away the sin of the world."
[1:45:09] And I I honor brother Brandham not
[1:45:11] because he's some great man, but I honor
[1:45:13] him because he stood there and he said,
[1:45:15] "Behold the lamb of God." He never
[1:45:17] pointed us to himself. He said, "Not for
[1:45:19] one moment do I bring a message so that
[1:45:21] you people could honor me or follow me."
[1:45:23] He said, "But to point to him." To point
[1:45:26] to him. He said the seventh angel
[1:45:27] messenger stand said, "Behold the lamb
[1:45:29] of God that takes away the sin of the
[1:45:31] world." And that lamb is still here this
[1:45:32] morning. Brother Brandham isn't with us
[1:45:34] anymore, but that lamb still stands here
[1:45:36] today. He's still behind the pulpit.
[1:45:39] He's still with us
[1:45:41] in the body move. He's still here. The
[1:45:46] seventh angel messenger says, "Behold
[1:45:47] the lamb of God that takes away the sin
[1:45:49] of the world." Not behold my Methodist,
[1:45:52] my Baptist, my Pentecostal, but the
[1:45:54] word, the son of God, the lamb of God
[1:45:55] that takes away the sin of the world,
[1:45:57] for no other foundation is there. Christ
[1:46:01] the word was not present in the Leoian
[1:46:02] church. You remember he was put out and
[1:46:04] he said, "Behold, I stand at the door
[1:46:06] and knock. If any man hear my voice and
[1:46:08] open the door, I will come into him.
[1:46:10] What's up with him and he with me?" He
[1:46:11] was outside the church. But because they
[1:46:13] still had emotion and joy, they thought
[1:46:15] he was still there. But it was an
[1:46:17] anointing on the exterior, not the
[1:46:19] interior.
[1:46:22] I it come to me that you know when the
[1:46:25] king of England is present at Buckingham
[1:46:29] Palace there's a change
[1:46:31] there guards outside the door that
[1:46:32] weren't there before but the most
[1:46:34] visible change when the king is present
[1:46:36] is the standard
[1:46:38] right they always fly the British flag
[1:46:41] but on the day that the king is present
[1:46:44] they change flags
[1:46:46] and the the royal standard is raised
[1:46:49] over Buckingham palace to signify that
[1:46:52] he is there. Now you can fly a flag
[1:46:56] without the king.
[1:46:58] Right? You can have emotion without the
[1:47:01] word. But if there's no flag, there's no
[1:47:05] king. And that's why brother Brandham
[1:47:07] can say anything without emotion is dead
[1:47:09] and ought to be buried. Because if the
[1:47:11] king is there and the people realize it,
[1:47:14] there will be a flag flying. Listen, if
[1:47:16] that flag doesn't fly over the castle,
[1:47:19] somebody didn't do their job. Amen. So,
[1:47:22] I'm going to do my best, brother JT. As
[1:47:24] long as I'm in this body, I'm going to
[1:47:25] do my best, sister, for as long as I'm
[1:47:27] in this body to keep that flag of joy
[1:47:29] waving. The King is here. He's here.
[1:47:32] He's not yesterday. He's not tomorrow.
[1:47:34] He's right here with us. If you need
[1:47:36] healing, he's here. If you need
[1:47:37] salvation, he's here.
[1:47:40] If your kids need to be He's here. You
[1:47:42] do what the word says and come to the
[1:47:44] house of God. expecting him to move.
[1:47:48] A dead formal cold church is not
[1:47:50] deceptive.
[1:47:51] It's not shock. And they say, "Praise
[1:47:53] God, we're not the shuck, but it's just
[1:47:55] a lodge.
[1:47:58] There's no king residence." Because if
[1:48:00] there's a king there, I'm challenging
[1:48:01] you again. If the king's there and
[1:48:03] there's no flag of joy, somebody didn't
[1:48:04] do their job.
[1:48:07] God, don't let that be me. I'm not
[1:48:10] saying they're not Christians, but
[1:48:11] somebody didn't do their job. I'm not
[1:48:13] saying you're not a Christian because
[1:48:14] you don't feel joy all the time, but
[1:48:15] it's our job to look past our own
[1:48:18] feelings. See, the king is here.
[1:48:23] The king is here. Let me fly the flag.
[1:48:25] There's something about a standard. It's
[1:48:27] important during the Civil War there.
[1:48:29] There was a flag bearer. It was a great
[1:48:30] honor to carry the company colors and to
[1:48:32] carry the flag. And and so what happened
[1:48:35] is they would because they could see it,
[1:48:37] all the snipers on the other side would
[1:48:38] take aim at the flag bearer. And they
[1:48:40] say they lasted about 15 minutes on
[1:48:42] average because they had a flag. It was
[1:48:45] a token, but they were proud to carry
[1:48:47] it. And one of the ways you could win
[1:48:49] respect and honor was by grabbing that
[1:48:52] flag before it hit the ground no matter
[1:48:53] who died in front of you. But those were
[1:48:56] men back then. Grab that flag knowing
[1:48:59] there was a wall of bullets coming at
[1:49:00] you. But you were going to keep the flag
[1:49:02] flying. I wonder how many Christians we
[1:49:04] got today. How many men, how many women
[1:49:06] would stand there and say, "I'm gonna
[1:49:08] keep the flag waving." Even if there's
[1:49:09] bullets coming my direction, even if
[1:49:11] Satan does everything he can, I know the
[1:49:13] importance of the standard because if
[1:49:15] the standard falls, if joy falls away
[1:49:17] from us, then we begin to lose, we begin
[1:49:21] to realize like Moses's hands being
[1:49:23] lifted and then when they went down,
[1:49:25] they begin to lose the battle because
[1:49:27] they lost confidence.
[1:49:29] And we need confidence
[1:49:32] in our battle that we fight.
[1:49:35] There was always joy in the temple
[1:49:36] because the shikina was there.
[1:49:40] Listen, they sang in the temple. I don't
[1:49:43] have time to read all this, but they
[1:49:44] came. They sang in the temple, his mercy
[1:49:46] endureth forever. Have you ever heard
[1:49:47] that? There's a whole psalm, believe
[1:49:49] it's Psalm 136,
[1:49:51] that every verse it says, "For his mercy
[1:49:53] endureth forever." And it's a long one,
[1:49:56] but you talk about rep a repetitive
[1:49:58] song, right? Every verse, his mercy
[1:50:01] endureth forever. How did they know his
[1:50:03] mercy endureth forever? Because wherever
[1:50:05] that ark was, the shikina was keeping
[1:50:08] the shoe bread from go getting stale.
[1:50:11] That's what keeps the word from getting
[1:50:12] stale to us. It's the presence of God.
[1:50:15] The shikina was there. The presence was
[1:50:17] always there anointing the word until
[1:50:20] they rejected the word. Right? He left.
[1:50:22] He left them. left the camp and then
[1:50:25] then they rejected Jesus who was his
[1:50:27] literal presence on the earth when he
[1:50:28] came. But but when he came, one of the
[1:50:32] criticisms that Jesus got was his
[1:50:34] disciples were too happy. I don't think
[1:50:36] anybody would criticize us for that.
[1:50:41] Said, "Well, they're too happy." And in
[1:50:44] Luke chapter 5, the Pharisees said, "Why
[1:50:46] do the disciples of John fast often?"
[1:50:49] And and and we fast the Pharisees. But
[1:50:52] but your disciples eat and drink like
[1:50:54] they're at a party.
[1:50:57] Praise God. I'm pro eating now. Praise
[1:50:59] the Lord.
[1:51:02] And I made y'all think about food,
[1:51:04] didn't I?
[1:51:07] But look, he said Jesus told him, he
[1:51:09] said, "Can you make the children of the
[1:51:12] bride chamber fast while the bridegroom
[1:51:14] is with them?"
[1:51:16] He said, "A wedding is not a sad time.
[1:51:19] It's a happy time. But the days will
[1:51:22] come when the bridegroom shall be taken
[1:51:24] away from them. Then shall they fast in
[1:51:26] those days.
[1:51:28] Oh my. But when he returned on the day
[1:51:30] of Pentecost, what happened? There was
[1:51:32] rejoicing again among the disciples.
[1:51:35] Why? Because he came back to them who
[1:51:37] were so sorrowful before they realized
[1:51:39] he was resurrected.
[1:51:41] Look, if he's here, and that has been
[1:51:43] proved to us today beyond the shadow of
[1:51:45] a doubt by a prophet messenger that he
[1:51:47] is here, we should rejoice. Remember,
[1:51:49] before the lamb took the book, there was
[1:51:51] weeping. But after he took the book,
[1:51:53] there was rejoicing. In the millennium,
[1:51:54] when he seated on the throne of David,
[1:51:56] there will be joy in his presence. I
[1:51:59] know we all want joy to be over there.
[1:52:01] But listen to this. Brother Brandham
[1:52:03] said, "Ask yourself if you could afford
[1:52:05] to miss this." And he reads Isaiah
[1:52:06] chapter 65. He said, "This is during the
[1:52:08] time of the millennium when the most
[1:52:10] holy is anointed." Isaiah 65:17,
[1:52:12] "Behold, I create new heavens and a new
[1:52:14] earth, and the former shall not be
[1:52:16] remembered, nor come into mind, but you
[1:52:17] be be glad and rejoice forever in that
[1:52:19] which I create. For behold, I create."
[1:52:22] Remember what we preached Wednesday
[1:52:23] night, he said, "I create the fruit of
[1:52:25] the lips." So he put you in situations
[1:52:29] at the bottom of the ocean. Hallelujah.
[1:52:33] So you can worship. But he said, he
[1:52:35] said, "Be glad and rejoice in what I
[1:52:38] create. For behold, I create Jerusalem a
[1:52:42] rejoicing and her people a joy. He
[1:52:46] creates the fruit of the lift. He said,
[1:52:47] "And I will rejoice." Yes, sir. Just
[1:52:51] bear with me for just a moment. I'm
[1:52:52] almost done. I will rejoice in Jerusalem
[1:52:56] and joy in my people. And the voice of
[1:52:58] weeping shall be no more heard in her,
[1:53:00] nor the voice of crying. Listen, brother
[1:53:02] Brandon picks it up. He said, "The
[1:53:03] anointing is the joy of the Lord." And
[1:53:05] he says in the six-fold purpose of
[1:53:07] Gabriel's visit to Daniel, he said the
[1:53:08] king and the throne are the royal
[1:53:10] majesty of the throne, the eternal
[1:53:11] throne and the eternal people with an
[1:53:14] eternal joy in an eternal city. Amen.
[1:53:17] Hallelujah. We know there's joy in
[1:53:19] heaven. How many know that? You realize
[1:53:21] there was joy when you got saved.
[1:53:24] The Bible says that Luke 15:10, he said,
[1:53:26] "Likewise, there's joy in the presence
[1:53:27] of the angels of God over one sinner
[1:53:29] that repenteth." We always pick that up,
[1:53:31] and it is true, but there's more to it.
[1:53:33] We always pick that up and say, "Well,
[1:53:34] the angels rejoice."
[1:53:36] That's not actually what the scripture
[1:53:38] says.
[1:53:39] Did you read it? There's joy in the
[1:53:41] presence of the angels,
[1:53:44] right?
[1:53:46] The angels do rejoice, but who gets them
[1:53:49] started?
[1:53:53] Oh, come on, church.
[1:53:56] If you read the scripture, I'm going to
[1:53:57] read it again in just a moment that we
[1:53:58] read at the beginning. You'll understand
[1:53:59] where I'm going. If you go back to Luke
[1:54:01] chapter 15, Paul talks about a man
[1:54:03] losing a hundred or Paul Jesus talks
[1:54:05] about a man losing a hundred sheep and
[1:54:07] having a hund sheep and losing one. And
[1:54:10] he said he leaves the 90 and nine and
[1:54:12] goes after what's lost until he finds
[1:54:14] it. And when he had found it, he lays it
[1:54:19] on his shoulders. Brother, that's the
[1:54:20] strongest part of his body. That's where
[1:54:23] you are today. That's how he brought you
[1:54:26] back.
[1:54:29] rejoicing
[1:54:32] and when he cometh home he calleth
[1:54:34] together his friends and neighbors
[1:54:39] right so if you can imagine God in
[1:54:40] heaven I'm just to kind of maybe it's a
[1:54:43] little uh a little bit carnal but just
[1:54:45] so we can understand it God sit in
[1:54:47] heaven on his throne and when you come
[1:54:50] back
[1:54:51] hallelujah he carried you back
[1:54:55] rejoicing
[1:54:57] and when he cometh home. He called
[1:54:59] together the angels and said, "Rejoice
[1:55:02] with me, for I have found my sheep which
[1:55:06] was lost." He said, "I say to you,
[1:55:08] likewise, joy shall be in heaven."
[1:55:11] Likewise, joy shall be in heaven over
[1:55:12] one sinner that repenteth more than over
[1:55:14] 90 and nine just persons which need no
[1:55:17] repentance. Go back to Zephaniah 3:17,
[1:55:19] our opening scripture. He said, "The
[1:55:21] Lord thy God in the midst of thee is
[1:55:24] mighty."
[1:55:26] Do you believe we found him? Is he right
[1:55:29] here? Have we seen the opening of the
[1:55:30] word? The fullness of the word. The Lord
[1:55:32] thy God in the midst of thee is mighty.
[1:55:34] He will save. He will rejoice.
[1:55:39] You say, "Well, there's no joy anymore."
[1:55:41] There is in heaven.
[1:55:43] And if we're sitting in heavenly places,
[1:55:46] there ought to be joy with us. Paul
[1:55:49] says, "We're in heavenly places right
[1:55:50] now in Christ Jesus. The Lord thy God in
[1:55:52] the midst of thee is mighty. He will
[1:55:54] save. He will rejoice over thee with
[1:55:58] joy. He will rest in his love. He will
[1:56:02] joy over thee with singing.
[1:56:08] I
[1:56:10] I don't know what his voice sounds like.
[1:56:11] I've always thought he had a deep voice,
[1:56:13] you know, like Mo like the Ten
[1:56:14] Commandments. You know, God speaking in
[1:56:16] the Ten Commandments. Moses.
[1:56:19] [Laughter]
[1:56:21] Imagine God being a great bass singer.
[1:56:26] I don't know. He might sing dinner.
[1:56:32] But he sings.
[1:56:34] He probably sings however he wants to.
[1:56:38] But he sings. You say God sings. What
[1:56:42] does he sing about you?
[1:56:44] Yes, sir.
[1:56:50] It's hard to be depressed and get this
[1:56:53] revelation.
[1:56:56] God sings over you.
[1:57:01] Come on, church. He said, "The Lord thy
[1:57:03] God is in the midst of thee, and he will
[1:57:05] joy over thee with singing."
[1:57:10] Not you singing praise to God, but God
[1:57:13] singing praise to you.
[1:57:18] Oh, it got quiet.
[1:57:22] That makes us uncomfortable, doesn't it?
[1:57:23] Because we know who we are. But see, he
[1:57:25] doesn't see your sin.
[1:57:31] You can still remember it. You can still
[1:57:33] be bound by you or held back if you
[1:57:36] really you you look at say, "Well, I
[1:57:38] know what I've done. And I know what
[1:57:39] I've been. But the Holy Ghost actually
[1:57:41] within you is singing.
[1:57:43] He's singing.
[1:57:46] Church, when you got saved, he shouted
[1:57:49] all over heaven.
[1:57:53] You said, "Well, I don't believe that."
[1:57:54] Why do you think we shout?
[1:57:57] You said, "Well, shouting is just
[1:57:59] temporal emotion. It's just something we
[1:58:00] do down here." Oh, no. The Bible says,
[1:58:02] "Where were you when the morning stars
[1:58:05] sang together and the sons of God
[1:58:09] shouted together for joy?"
[1:58:12] Hallelujah. Where were Oh, come on,
[1:58:14] church. Before we ever knew in a
[1:58:17] preview, before we even knew when we
[1:58:18] were in the thoughts of God, we shouted
[1:58:20] and he shouted. Why did we shout?
[1:58:23] Because he shouted.
[1:58:25] If God could express human emotions like
[1:58:27] we do, we know he does in Jesus Christ.
[1:58:31] Right. He's a high priest that could be
[1:58:33] touched by the feeling of our
[1:58:34] infirmities. He said he he'll joy over
[1:58:37] thee with singing. I've always thought
[1:58:40] in heaven that David would be the song
[1:58:42] leader
[1:58:44] [Laughter]
[1:58:45] because if you think about it, you know,
[1:58:47] oh, David, oh, David, man, he he knows
[1:58:49] the grace of God and he wrote all the
[1:58:52] psalms and said everything in order.
[1:58:54] David must have been quite a singer.
[1:58:56] I've always thought he must be the song
[1:58:57] leader, but really if you what the Bible
[1:58:59] teaches is that God actually sings. He
[1:59:02] rejoices and come sing with me. A a
[1:59:05] child of God's been born again. You may
[1:59:07] not feel like much this morning. You may
[1:59:09] feel like the lowest member of the body
[1:59:10] of Christ, but if you were born again by
[1:59:12] the power of the blood, he is singing
[1:59:15] over you.
[1:59:18] Ought to make us the happiest people on
[1:59:19] the face of the earth. Oh, come on,
[1:59:22] church. That ought to make us excited. I
[1:59:23] don't I I know we we get all upset and
[1:59:26] because all discouraged because of
[1:59:27] what's going on. Look away from that
[1:59:29] this morning and look to the throne of
[1:59:31] God where the where where God himself is
[1:59:33] singing today and he wants you to join
[1:59:35] in. He said come and rejoice with me. Oh
[1:59:38] you people sitting in heavenly places.
[1:59:40] Rejoice with me. How why can I rejoice?
[1:59:42] I'm on his shoulders. He's carrying me
[1:59:44] back home. Let me rejoice with the ones
[1:59:46] who are rejoicing. Let me rejoice with
[1:59:48] the with the angels when I feel the
[1:59:51] presence of God. Let me lift my hand or
[1:59:53] clap my hands. Let me see have joy in
[1:59:56] his presence as musicians come. I wasn't
[1:59:59] going to make this part of my sermon,
[2:00:01] but couldn't get away from it. I posted
[2:00:03] the audio of it
[2:00:05] yesterday
[2:00:07] on Facebook, but brother Brandham is
[2:00:10] doing a is his his line, his prayer
[2:00:13] line, and calling people out. And a lady
[2:00:17] starts to rejoice. You can hear
[2:00:19] hallelujah. Praise the Lord. Shouting.
[2:00:22] She starts to clap
[2:00:24] and rejoice.
[2:00:26] And he says,
[2:00:30] I love this.
[2:00:32] He said, "You had a problem with your
[2:00:34] hands."
[2:00:37] Oh, we need some hand healing this
[2:00:39] morning.
[2:00:41] Some voice healing.
[2:00:44] He said, "You had a problem with your
[2:00:45] hands.
[2:00:48] He said, "You don't anymore.
[2:00:52] God's healed you."
[2:00:55] She rejoiced with hands that were
[2:00:56] hurting. And it caught a prophet's
[2:00:59] attention. He said, "You rejoiced. I see
[2:01:02] you there rejoicing. You're rejoicing
[2:01:03] with hurting hands." He said, "God's
[2:01:05] going to heal your hands." Oh, church, I
[2:01:07] wonder this morning. You might rejoice
[2:01:09] with a heavy heart. You might rejoice
[2:01:11] when things aren't all going good like
[2:01:12] you think they ought to, but you can
[2:01:14] still rejoice because you're a priest
[2:01:16] and a king in the throne room of God.
[2:01:18] When he said, "Come rejoice with me."
[2:01:20] What is it when we feel the presence of
[2:01:21] God and we feel his power here among us?
[2:01:24] He's saying, "Come rejoice with me. Come
[2:01:26] sing with me." We're not singing for
[2:01:28] each other. He said, "Well, I don't have
[2:01:30] much of a voice." You're not singing for
[2:01:31] each other. You're singing for him. He
[2:01:35] said, "Come rejoice with me. I found one
[2:01:37] that's lost." Hallelujah. Oh, he's still
[2:01:40] there today. If you're lost this morning
[2:01:42] with every head bowed and every eye
[2:01:43] closed, if you find yourself lost out of
[2:01:46] the ark of safety, he wants to rejoice
[2:01:48] over you. Won't you just give your heart
[2:01:51] to him today?
[2:01:53] If you're a Christian who's lost your
[2:01:55] joy,
[2:01:56] it's yours. It belongs to you. Why don't
[2:02:00] you just look at the fullness of the
[2:02:02] word? Why don't you go back to the word
[2:02:05] and say, "Lord, I know you brought your
[2:02:07] fullness to me in my hour. I'm going to
[2:02:10] rejoice." I'm not trying to prod you in
[2:02:11] these last few services, but I want us
[2:02:13] to understand in his presence, things
[2:02:16] can change. And I've seen people leave a
[2:02:18] service. I've seen them leave. I've
[2:02:21] watched the Holy Spirit affect their
[2:02:23] life and watch them walk out the door
[2:02:25] and not receive what God has for them in
[2:02:27] that service because they were just too
[2:02:29] busy or they didn't want to make noise
[2:02:31] or they just didn't want to be different
[2:02:33] than everybody else. But if you would
[2:02:35] just open up to it and let him let him
[2:02:37] have his way in your life, you you might
[2:02:39] lose that depression. You might lose
[2:02:40] that that that un ungodly feeling or
[2:02:43] thought. You might lose those things if
[2:02:45] you just rejoice. I know I've not been
[2:02:47] perfect, but I know a God who is
[2:02:48] perfect, and he's rejoicing. So, let me
[2:02:51] rejoice.
[2:02:53] I've always wanted to hear that song.
[2:02:55] Sing, Lord, and I'll sing with you. If
[2:02:59] you sing, Lord, the the lead part, let
[2:03:01] me sing the harmony. Let me be right
[2:03:04] with the word. Let me have joy in your
[2:03:08] presence. If we no longer have joy in
[2:03:10] his presence, that's a dangerous place
[2:03:11] to be, church.
[2:03:14] It's what happened to Satan at the
[2:03:16] beginning. You remember
[2:03:18] let pride get in the way and there was
[2:03:21] no joy in the presence of the Lord
[2:03:22] anymore.
[2:03:24] And finally, he fell and there was no
[2:03:26] redemption for him, but there was
[2:03:27] redemption for us. We were born for that
[2:03:30] purpose. We bypassed our theophony to
[2:03:32] come and be tempted. We were born for
[2:03:34] the purpose of of of redemption.
[2:03:38] Oh, let's not pass up our opportunity
[2:03:41] this morning. Let's not sit in the house
[2:03:43] of God with pride on us, too prideful to
[2:03:46] to worship him, but let's just worship
[2:03:48] him with the way he made us, with all
[2:03:49] that we have. Oh Lord, we thank you
[2:03:51] today. Heavenly Father, we love you. We
[2:03:53] thank you, Lord. I pray you'd help these
[2:03:55] people. Bless them, Lord. We pray in
[2:03:57] Jesus name. Amen.
[2:04:00] Hallelujah.
[2:04:02] Hallelujah.
[2:04:05] Hallelujah.
[2:04:07] Like me, I once was lost.
[2:04:12] Oh, I want
[2:04:15] [Music]
[2:04:17] Oh, I wonder if we could lift our hands
[2:04:18] to him this morning. Just rejoice. If
[2:04:20] you need prayer, we'd be glad to pray
[2:04:22] with you. I believe he's here this
[2:04:24] morning. Where he is, all things are
[2:04:26] possible.
[2:04:30] I see.
[2:04:32] Hallelujah. Oh, it was grace. Oh, I'm so
[2:04:36] glad for grace today. I'm so thankful
[2:04:39] for grace. It brings joy to my life to
[2:04:43] fear. Oh, it was grace. Hallelujah.
[2:04:51] Relief. Sing it to you young people. You
[2:04:53] know what grace it means. Oh, how
[2:04:56] preious
[2:04:59] it is. Hallelujah. Oh, that grace
[2:05:03] appeared.
[2:05:05] Hold thee out.
[2:05:09] I first
[2:05:11] believe. Let's all stand together as we
[2:05:14] sing the next verse. All through me.
[2:05:19] Many dangers. It's your turn now. It's
[2:05:23] time to offer him a sacrifice of praise.
[2:05:25] I don't know what you brought with you
[2:05:26] to the house of God, but whatever you
[2:05:28] brought with you, it's time to give it
[2:05:29] to him this morning. Lord, this is my
[2:05:32] sacrifice today. I may not feel like it,
[2:05:34] but this is my sacrifice of praise. I
[2:05:37] know I've been through some things, but
[2:05:38] I know you're a great God. Hallelujah.
[2:05:42] Oh, be safe
[2:05:46] thus far. Oh, and grace
[2:05:51] it will lead
[2:05:54] me home.
[2:05:56] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[2:06:00] Hallelujah.
[2:06:02] Thank you, Lord.
[2:06:04] Hallelujah. Oh, we just love him this
[2:06:06] morning. Let's just worship him for a
[2:06:09] moment with all of our hearts. Oh Lord,
[2:06:11] this is my sacrifice of praise. The
[2:06:14] fruit of my lips, oh God, give praise to
[2:06:16] your name. We've got another service
[2:06:19] today, but we just want to worship him
[2:06:20] with all that we have. Oh God, I expect
[2:06:23] you, Lord. I believe you're coming.
[2:06:26] Believe you're just around the bin. Oh,
[2:06:28] I believe you, Lord Jesus. I believe
[2:06:30] your word. I believe I found you. Oh,
[2:06:33] thank you, Lord Jesus. Thank you Lord
[2:06:35] Jesus. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Let's
[2:06:38] sing it this way. Praise God. Oh, praise
[2:06:42] God.
[2:06:44] Oh, praise God. Oh, praise God.
[2:06:49] Praise God. Oh, praise God. Oh, that
[2:06:54] ought to be some freedom in your worship
[2:06:55] this morning. Oh, I know I can praise
[2:06:58] God no matter what's going on around me.
[2:07:00] Hallelujah. Oh, I just want to praise
[2:07:03] God.
[2:07:05] Oh, praise God. Oh, praise God.
[2:07:10] Praise God. Oh, praise God.
[2:07:16] Praise God.
[2:07:19] Praise God.
[2:07:21] Can we sing, "My God is awesome." My God
[2:07:23] is awesome this morning. You believe
[2:07:25] he's awesome today? Do you believe it?
[2:07:27] Let's sing it with all our hearts. My
[2:07:28] God is awesome. Oh, he can move the
[2:07:33] mountain. Are you thinking about when
[2:07:36] you sing it? The valley
[2:07:39] hide me from the rain.
[2:07:42] Oh my God is awesome. Oh, he heals me
[2:07:48] when I'm broken. Hallelujah.
[2:07:54] Oh, forever I will reign.
[2:07:58] Thank you, Lord. My God is awome.
[2:08:02] Oh, he is awome.
[2:08:06] Oh, yes. He's awome.

[2:10:43] [Music]
[2:10:45] I got saved.
[2:10:47] [Music]
[2:10:48] God bless you. Thank the Lord. Thank the
[2:10:51] Lord. The blood
[2:10:54] of Jesus shed
[2:10:57] on Calary.
[2:11:01] That need this morning. If you have it,
[2:11:03] why don't you just lift your hands to
[2:11:04] those precious blood?
[2:11:08] Oh, thank you, Lord. Hallelujah. They
[2:11:10] were made there. Made there just for me.
[2:11:15] Hallelujah. Oh, thank you Lord for all
[2:11:21] my sins. Oh, thank you Lord for all my
[2:11:25] sicknesses,
[2:11:29] my pain.
[2:11:31] Hallelujah.
[2:11:32] Hallelujah.
[2:11:34] When I need healing,
[2:11:38] oh, I just claim those precious
[2:11:44] blood stains. Before we sing it again,
[2:11:46] I'm going to
[2:11:48] this young man come this morning to give
[2:11:50] his heart to the Lord. Little Uriah,
[2:11:53] young man, put his heart in heaven this
[2:11:58] morning.
[2:11:59] Maybe you didn't know what was going on
[2:12:01] or you couldn't feel it. But in heaven
[2:12:02] this morning, there was rejoicing. You
[2:12:04] said, "Can a young man do that?"
[2:12:06] Absolutely he can. Because I was that
[2:12:08] young man one day and I gave my heart to
[2:12:10] the Lord and never looked back. I
[2:12:12] believe there ought to be rejoicing in
[2:12:13] the house of the Lord over one who
[2:12:15] repents. He's here this morning. He
[2:12:18] promised he would be here. His presence
[2:12:19] is here and we ought to just receive
[2:12:21] whatever we have need of today. And just
[2:12:23] in your sincerity like a child, say,
[2:12:25] "Lord, you can give it to me today." If
[2:12:28] little Uriah could could receive
[2:12:29] salvation this morning. Brother Brandham
[2:12:31] said when you come out to to come to the
[2:12:33] altar, he said that you get your
[2:12:35] salvation when you begin to come. He
[2:12:37] said because and you can just thank God
[2:12:39] for it because you made a move towards
[2:12:41] God and he'll make a move towards you.
[2:12:43] Do you believe that this morning? Is
[2:12:45] there joy in your heart? Is there joy in
[2:12:46] the house of the Lord this morning? I
[2:12:48] believe there is. I claim the blood.
[2:12:51] Claim him for your healing this morning.
[2:12:53] Jesus shed. Hallelujah.
[2:12:56] Thank you Lord Jesus.
[2:12:59] Thank you Lord Jesus. Hallelujah. Oh
[2:13:02] those preious
[2:13:05] blood stains. Glory to God. Oh they were
[2:13:08] made there just. Hallelujah
[2:13:13] for me. Thank you Lord. Oh for all my
[2:13:19] sin. Oh I'm so glad for my sickness and
[2:13:22] my pain. Hallelujah.
[2:13:25] Oh, I love you, Lord Jesus. I pray you'd
[2:13:28] heal those that are sick. Touch the
[2:13:30] wounded in spirit. Lord, give rejoicing
[2:13:32] in a weary land. Oh God, hallelujah.
[2:13:35] Pray for you granted today. Hallelujah.
[2:13:39] Those preious
[2:13:41] blood stains. God bless you, brother
[2:13:43] Allen, as you come. Thank the Lord
[2:13:45] Jesus. Just continue to rejoice.
[2:13:48] Hallelujah. The source. Hallelujah. Oh,
[2:13:52] of strength
[2:13:54] when I
[2:13:55] am weak.
[2:13:58] [Music]
[2:14:01] That takes me through.
[2:14:06] When life is pressing
[2:14:11] me,
[2:14:15] I have a source.
[2:14:19] [Music]
[2:14:21] of power
[2:14:23] from
[2:14:25] above.
[2:14:28] [Music]
[2:14:30] I'm covered
[2:14:33] over
[2:14:36] by
[2:14:37] a shield
[2:14:39] of love
[2:14:42] with all our hearts. Oh, I claim
[2:14:47] the blood
[2:14:50] Jesus shed
[2:14:52] on Calary.
[2:14:59] Those preious
[2:15:01] blood stains,
[2:15:05] they were made there
[2:15:07] just for me.
[2:15:11] [Music]
[2:15:11] [Applause]
[2:15:13] Oh, for all
[2:15:16] my sin
[2:15:18] [Music]
[2:15:22] and my pain.
[2:15:26] [Music]
[2:15:28] When I need healing,
[2:15:32] [Music]
[2:15:33] I just claim
[2:15:36] those precious blood stains.
[2:15:40] Amen. Can you give the Lord a hand clap
[2:15:42] of praise?
[2:15:45] Amen. Amen. Just before we go, we've got
[2:15:48] an announcement. The Oldest Sunday
[2:15:50] School Choir, if you would stay
[2:15:52] immediately after um for practice. A
[2:15:55] let's sing that song, Key of G. I will

[2:15:58] time through. Then you're free to go in
[2:16:00] the name of the Lord. Oh, I

[2:16:06] the Lord.

[2:16:13] the Lord.

[2:16:28] name of the Lord. Oh,

[2:16:35] the Lord.
[2:16:38] Yes, I

[2:16:42] the Lord.

[2:16:54] I will praise the Lord.
[2:17:00] Oh, I
