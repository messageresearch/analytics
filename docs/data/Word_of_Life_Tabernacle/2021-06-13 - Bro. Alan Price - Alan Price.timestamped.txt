[39:35] we just know and trust that you will
[39:36] deliver us from that
[39:38] in jesus christ's name we pray amen
[39:42] amen do you love the lord this morning
[39:45] amen just looking forward to what god
[39:46] has in store for us
[39:49] sorry it's it's me again but
[39:52] i found out at eight o'clock i was gonna
[39:54] be preaching this morning so we'll just
[39:56] pray that the lord has a purpose behind
[39:58] everything
[39:59] that's one thing i've learned i try not
[40:01] to question
[40:02] question the lord because if i looked at
[40:04] my own abilities i wouldn't be able to
[40:05] do it but if we look to him he can
[40:07] always come and take care of it amen
[40:09] if you would turn with me to uh ii
[40:11] timothy chapter 1
[40:12] and verse 12. amen second timothy
[40:17] chapter 1 and verse 12
[40:18] just greet everybody in the name of the
[40:20] lord this morning glad to have everybody
[40:22] out
[40:23] just be remembering those i think
[40:25] allison and stuart and their family
[40:27] there kind of
[40:28] have a little virus or something going
[40:31] on so just be praying for them the lord
[40:33] would just heal them
[40:35] and deliver them from that second
[40:36] timothy chapter 1 and verse 12
[40:39] it says for the which cause i also
[40:41] suffer these things
[40:43] nevertheless i'm not ashamed for i know
[40:45] in whom i have believed
[40:47] and persuaded that he is able to keep
[40:49] that which i have committed unto him
[40:51] against that day hold fast the form of
[40:54] sound words
[40:55] which thou has heard of me in faith and
[40:58] love which is in christ
[40:59] jesus that good thing which was
[41:02] committed
[41:02] unto thee keep by the holy ghost which
[41:05] dwelleth
[41:06] in us amen you have your seats this
[41:08] morning
[41:09] i mean if i could just for just for a
[41:11] few moments just
[41:13] just go through the scripture here this
[41:15] morning and just see where the lord
[41:16] leads us
[41:17] but i'm going to go back through that
[41:18] second timothy chapter 1 and verse 12
[41:20] and
[41:20] we see here that he's speaking he says
[41:22] for which cause i also suffer these
[41:24] things nevertheless i'm not ashamed for
[41:26] i know in whom i have believed
[41:28] and persuaded that he's able to keep
[41:31] that which i have committed unto him
[41:33] against that day so we see here that the
[41:34] writer is saying that
[41:36] what i have committed unto god i am
[41:38] faithful
[41:39] i am persuaded that he will keep that
[41:42] against that day
[41:43] speaking of the day that our bodies are
[41:45] speaking of the day at that time
[41:47] of death or the rapture is that right in
[41:49] verse 13 he says hold fast the form of
[41:51] sound words so we see that when
[41:53] when we look at the scripture when we
[41:54] look at a minister that comes and speaks
[41:56] the word of god
[41:57] those are sound words those are words
[41:59] that will last and that will hold us
[42:01] to the to the rapture is that right
[42:03] which thou has heard of me in
[42:04] faith and love which is in christ jesus
[42:07] that good thing which was committed
[42:09] unto thee keep by the holy ghost which
[42:11] dwelleth in us so if we don't have that
[42:13] holy ghost we know we're not sealed
[42:15] we know that we cannot make it to our
[42:17] redemption so we see you know you look
[42:19] at this this morning and
[42:20] my thought line this morning if i could
[42:22] speak uh i guess our title or thought it
[42:24] would be christ means more and
[42:27] it's a very simple thought this morning
[42:28] because you're like well what does
[42:29] christ mean more than well
[42:30] everything and i think as a believer
[42:32] we've got to come to that point to where
[42:34] he means more than anything else and
[42:36] and hopefully we we all have that in our
[42:38] life where it means more than family it
[42:40] means more than social status it means
[42:42] more than
[42:43] church but christ has got to be the
[42:45] center focus of our life
[42:46] and and so we look and and you know i
[42:48] just kind of just look here you know
[42:50] rebecca when they come to her and
[42:52] when eliezer come and and you heard the
[42:54] family was saying you know we're going
[42:55] to do this we're going to do that and
[42:57] and finally it come down to them you
[42:58] know they said well let the damsel speak
[43:00] is that right and and she had to speak
[43:02] rebecca had to speak by her own words
[43:05] and they said will you go with this man
[43:06] and she said i will go and so
[43:08] we see that it had to come down to
[43:10] rebecca just like it had to come down to
[43:11] each one of us we had to make that
[43:13] decision
[43:14] to where we says we will go with christ
[43:16] and brother branham says and i have
[43:17] heard but now i see he said and satan
[43:19] had even stretched as far as he could on
[43:21] that
[43:21] he took every friend and everything he
[43:23] had he's speaking of job he says
[43:25] in almost his complete life but he
[43:27] couldn't take his life he said but job
[43:29] held right on he said there was no
[43:31] turning back you see
[43:32] when a man or a person has really come
[43:34] in contact with god with that genuine
[43:36] revealed faith that god
[43:38] is there's nothing no time nowhere can
[43:40] ever separate that man from god he says
[43:42] i believe it was paul said there's no
[43:44] strife no hunger no perils
[43:46] neither living creatures or death or
[43:48] anything that can separate us from the
[43:50] love of god which is in
[43:52] christ jesus do you believe that he said
[43:54] you're securely anchored in him because
[43:56] you were ordained
[43:57] to that life and when we know that god
[43:59] ordained us he not only ordained us
[44:01] or predestinated us but he equipped us
[44:03] for the journey is that right
[44:05] so whatever we needed we whatever we
[44:06] would have need of he
[44:08] equipped us with that and i was talking
[44:10] to to jen last night i was kind of
[44:12] telling her about one of the
[44:13] one of the historical facts and i can't
[44:15] remember which war but i was reading
[44:17] where
[44:17] you know they were so short supplied on
[44:19] guns that they were giving one soldier a
[44:21] gun with a clip
[44:22] and then giving the next soldier a clip
[44:23] and so they were going into battle with
[44:25] just bullets and they were like you know
[44:26] when one dies you grab their gun and
[44:28] and how how you know you look at today
[44:30] you know i won't even go to work if the
[44:32] air is not on we won't come to church
[44:34] unless the power's on and
[44:35] how times have changed that used to they
[44:37] were going to jump out of a plane or go
[44:38] into battle with just bullets no gun
[44:40] and so we see that as in today's time
[44:42] we've got to be willing to do that as
[44:44] christians
[44:45] that whatever god has put in front of us
[44:47] that's what we've got to be able to face
[44:49] and we've got to trust that he has
[44:50] equipped us
[44:51] to overcome that is that right i mean do
[44:53] you love the lord this morning
[44:55] and we got to trust god we've got to
[44:57] trust him to know that whatever he's
[44:58] given us and
[44:59] and i really like that you know i heard
[45:01] a quote the other day it says you know
[45:03] in school they give you lessons and then
[45:05] you train for the test
[45:06] is that right and they say in life god
[45:08] gives you the test which teaches you the
[45:10] lesson so
[45:11] we see as christians we want to learn
[45:12] the lesson we want to know what we're
[45:13] going to go through we want to know
[45:14] what's going to happen
[45:16] but god doesn't show us that way he
[45:18] teaches us through the test is that
[45:19] right
[45:20] i believe the scripture says every son
[45:21] and daughter of god must be tested and
[45:23] tried we must be chastened
[45:25] now if we could just for a few moments
[45:27] i'd just like to look at gideon in the
[45:29] scriptures so if you want to turn to
[45:30] judges chapter 6
[45:32] that's where i'll be taking the most of
[45:33] the context from this morning
[45:36] in the scripture and i just love this
[45:37] story of gideon and
[45:40] it's definitely done something for me in
[45:42] my life and
[45:44] and i usually read this read this quote
[45:47] and i've read it a couple times with
[45:48] several different
[45:49] with several different sermons but
[45:50] there's a there's a plane
[45:53] a nautical term i believe to where this
[45:55] plane reaches the term of the pnr
[45:57] or the point of no return and i've read
[45:59] this before but it's more often
[46:01] to refer to as pilots by the radius of
[46:03] action formula
[46:05] which is referred to as a technical term
[46:07] in air navigation
[46:08] to refer to the point on a flight at
[46:10] which due to fuel consumption the plane
[46:12] is no longer
[46:14] capable of returning to the airfield it
[46:16] took off from
[46:17] and so what that means is it's gone so
[46:19] far
[46:20] that it's closer to the destination than
[46:22] going back so it's gone
[46:24] far enough that there's no way it can
[46:26] turn back it's got to go forward and i
[46:28] believe as christians we've come to that
[46:30] point
[46:30] we've gone so far there's nowhere else
[46:33] to go but to the finish line is that
[46:35] right
[46:36] as believers there's nowhere else to go
[46:37] back to another there's not another age
[46:39] to come there's not another prophet
[46:41] messenger to come the only place we're
[46:42] going is to the rapture to meet him in
[46:44] the air is that right
[46:46] so as sons and daughters of god it's got
[46:48] to be christ means more than anything
[46:50] else
[46:50] that we that we can focus on in this day
[46:52] anything else that's happening
[46:54] in the world christ has to mean more now
[46:56] judges 6 and verse 1 and you know the
[46:58] story of gideon and i've kind of got it
[47:00] broke down we'll kind of go through this
[47:02] but you know the story of gideon and
[47:03] judges 6 1 and you see the children of
[47:05] israel did evil in the sight of the lord
[47:07] and the lord delivered them into the
[47:08] hand of the midian
[47:09] seven years and you know one thing that
[47:12] that
[47:12] i look at the children of israel and
[47:14] i've said this before you know it's kind
[47:15] of just so
[47:16] so upsetting to me to see that god would
[47:18] save them then they'd go back and god
[47:20] would save them they'd fall again or
[47:21] they'd make a mistake and
[47:22] then i i was just like man they're just
[47:24] so dumb you know and then i kind of
[47:26] looked at my life i was like well i made
[47:27] this mistake oh i did this and
[47:29] then i was like man i'm so dumb and and
[47:31] so without him there's nothing no way
[47:32] none of us can make it you can't
[47:34] outsmart the devil you can't outsmart
[47:36] sin
[47:36] it's not an intellectual knowledge it's
[47:38] a heart knowledge it's something knowing
[47:40] christ
[47:40] i believe it's the peace that passes all
[47:42] understanding when you can't
[47:44] explain why you're at peace that's the
[47:46] peace of god
[47:47] is that right you know you can explain
[47:49] why you're at peace when there's money
[47:51] in the bank your family's healthy
[47:52] everything's going right you can explain
[47:54] that peace and that but when
[47:55] everything's going on and
[47:56] everything's crashing everything's
[47:57] falling apart and and everything's going
[47:59] just the way you don't want it to go and
[48:01] you still have peace
[48:02] that's the peace of god now and we see
[48:05] here that in in verse 2 and the hand of
[48:07] the midian prevailed against israel
[48:08] because the midianites and the children
[48:10] of israel
[48:11] and because of the midianites the
[48:12] children of israel made them dens
[48:15] which are in the mountains and caves and
[48:16] strongholds and so it was when israel
[48:19] had sown the midianites came up and the
[48:21] amalekites and the children of the east
[48:24] even came up against them and i like
[48:25] that when they
[48:27] when one took over more came in is that
[48:30] right and
[48:31] that's just the way it works with sin or
[48:32] with unbelief when you let one thought
[48:34] come in
[48:35] there's a several that's going to be
[48:36] following right behind it to attack is
[48:38] that right
[48:38] that's the way the enemy works he likes
[48:40] to get one thing in and then start
[48:41] taking over with others and
[48:43] and they encamped against them and
[48:44] destroyed the increase of the earth till
[48:45] thou
[48:46] come unto gaza and left no sustenance
[48:49] for israel neither sheep nor oxen or ass
[48:51] and
[48:52] we see that for they came up with their
[48:54] cattle and their tents and they came as
[48:55] grasshoppers in multitude
[48:57] for both they had their camels were
[48:59] without number and they entered the land
[49:01] to destroy it in verse 6 and israel was
[49:04] greatly impoverished because of the
[49:05] midianites and the children of
[49:07] israel cried unto the lord so we see
[49:09] they had reached
[49:10] a point of desperation to where they
[49:12] cried back unto god
[49:14] and i think that's just a point you know
[49:16] even historically or
[49:17] or or even scripturally you look at the
[49:19] children of israel every time everything
[49:20] would go good they would go back
[49:23] to some other little god or some minor
[49:25] god or some idols or this or that
[49:27] but every time they got a needs of
[49:28] desperation they would cry out to the
[49:29] one true god and
[49:31] and you can see that in today's time you
[49:32] know there's people who don't go to
[49:33] church but let something wrong happen
[49:35] with the children or with the family
[49:36] they're going to go back to church
[49:37] because they know
[49:39] they know maybe they can't fully grasp
[49:41] or change their life or be filled with
[49:43] the holy ghost but they know there's
[49:44] something about this word
[49:46] that can change somebody is that right
[49:49] brother braham says in desperations he
[49:51] says that the sign of his coming should
[49:52] throw
[49:52] every member of christ into desperation
[49:55] now
[49:56] about our souls about our welfare for
[49:59] hereafter he says well what are you
[50:00] going to do
[50:01] to amount to if we gain the whole world
[50:03] what are you going to do what are we
[50:05] living for
[50:06] he says what do you work for what are
[50:07] you eating for what are you struggling
[50:09] for he says to live
[50:10] he says what are you living for to die
[50:13] he said you're not fit to live until
[50:14] you're fit to die it's true and we all
[50:16] see so many miracles of healing it
[50:18] should put us
[50:19] into desperation so you see the prophet
[50:21] there is saying you know
[50:22] sometimes we can get focused on this
[50:25] mortal life but what are we really
[50:26] focusing on because at the end of this
[50:27] mortal life all we do is die is that
[50:29] right
[50:30] and i've told y'all many times i'm a
[50:32] planner and i've done this and i've said
[50:33] this here many times but
[50:35] you know i plan the week i plan the
[50:36] month i plan the year and
[50:38] you know and i like to get through those
[50:40] things so i like from monday to friday i
[50:41] have my list to do and when i get done
[50:43] on friday my to-do list is done i'm
[50:45] excited i feel good and
[50:46] and then you see i start over the next
[50:48] week and then you you elongate that list
[50:50] all the way out and then at the end it's
[50:51] just death so
[50:52] we see in this mortal life there's
[50:53] nothing to look forward to so we've got
[50:55] to be looking to christ is that right
[50:57] but it ought to put us in desperation
[50:58] that what we're looking for is it you
[51:00] know that kingdom that we're going to
[51:02] the builder and maker was god is that
[51:04] right it's not of this earth but it's of
[51:05] him
[51:06] so we see we we look here we see israel
[51:09] had reached a
[51:09] had reached a point of desperation and i
[51:11] know many times in my life i
[51:13] even trusting the lord but i've come to
[51:15] a point of desperation where i was
[51:17] willing to do whatever it took to to
[51:19] seek the mind of the lord is that right
[51:21] and as christians we all ought to be
[51:23] that way
[51:26] now we'll read on down in verse 7 and it
[51:29] came to pass
[51:30] when the children of israel cried unto
[51:31] the lord because of the midianites
[51:33] that the lord sent a prophet unto the
[51:35] children of israel
[51:36] which said unto them thus saith the lord
[51:38] god of israel i brought you up
[51:39] from egypt i brought you forth out of
[51:41] the house of bondage
[51:43] and i delivered you out of the hand of
[51:44] the egyptians out of the hand that
[51:46] oppressed you and drave them out
[51:48] from before you and gave you their land
[51:51] and i said unto you i'm the lord your
[51:52] god fear not the gods the amorites and
[51:54] whose land you dwell
[51:56] but you obey not my voice
[51:59] in verse 11 here and my my notes kind of
[52:01] cut off just a little bit verse 11 there
[52:03] came an angel of the lord and said under
[52:05] the oak which is an ophra and pertained
[52:08] to joash the ibizarite and
[52:09] and his son gideon threshed wheat by the
[52:11] wine press to hide it from the
[52:13] mennonites and so we see that gideon was
[52:14] hiding this from the mennonites because
[52:16] they would come in to seek
[52:17] kill and destroy and they were they were
[52:19] nothing they just took the sustenance of
[52:20] israel
[52:21] and the angel of the lord appeared unto
[52:22] him and said unto him the lord is with
[52:24] thee thou mighty man of valor
[52:27] and gideon said unto him o my lord the
[52:29] lord be with us
[52:30] why then is this all befallen us and
[52:32] where be all the miracles which our
[52:34] fathers told of us saying did not the
[52:36] lord bring us up from egypt
[52:38] but now the lord had forsaken us and
[52:39] delivered us into the hands of the
[52:41] midianites
[52:42] and the lord looked upon him and said go
[52:44] in thus thy might
[52:46] and save israel from the hand of the
[52:47] midianites have not
[52:49] i sent thee so i love that getting asked
[52:51] the question you know why why is all
[52:53] this happen where are all the miracles
[52:54] why is all this going on and it seems
[52:56] like god just ignores that
[52:58] and just says listen this is what i need
[53:00] you to do have not i sent thee
[53:02] and so we see that brother branham says
[53:04] in 1961 he says if god before us
[53:07] then where's all the miracles he says he
[53:09] says there are so-called churches around
[53:11] the country
[53:12] today that say well is this all the
[53:15] miracles he said we'll give you a
[53:16] thousand dollars that'll predict produce
[53:18] a miracle he says you poor deliberated
[53:20] backsliding
[53:22] twit twice dead plucked up by the roots
[53:24] how are you ever going to see a miracle
[53:26] until you become one he says glory he
[53:27] says a miracle of god's grace to take an
[53:30] unbelieving doubter and fill them with
[53:32] the holy ghost that's the true miracle
[53:34] he said jesus said except a man be born
[53:36] again he cannot even
[53:38] see the kingdom of god he said if you
[53:40] want to see a miracle become one
[53:42] let god work on you first he's got some
[53:44] overhauling to do
[53:46] i don't care how well you know the
[53:47] message how well you know the ministers
[53:49] the preachers of this message
[53:50] god's got an overhauling to do in our
[53:52] life before we can do anything else in
[53:54] anyone else's life is that right
[53:56] he said some different lenses to put
[53:58] over your eyes because you're blind dead
[54:00] in sin and trespasses spiritually bond
[54:03] double daddy said that's right god has
[54:04] to give you life and touch your eyes so
[54:06] that you can see
[54:07] and perform a miracle and make you a
[54:09] miracle then you can see the miracle
[54:10] working god he said that's the first
[54:12] thing
[54:13] so we see that before we can do anything
[54:15] god's got to change our viewpoint
[54:17] and our life is that right now judges 6
[54:21] and 15 and we see here we're coming back
[54:22] to get in he said unto him oh my lord
[54:24] wherewith shall i
[54:25] save israel behold my family is poor and
[54:28] manasseh and i am the least
[54:30] in my father's house and so we see
[54:32] gideon begins to do what many of us do
[54:34] when god calls us to do anything we
[54:36] begin to look at ourselves
[54:38] right we begin to say well my family's
[54:40] the poorest and
[54:41] out of my whole family that is the
[54:43] poorest in all of israel i'm the worst
[54:44] one of that whole family
[54:46] you know so he's saying i'm the least of
[54:48] that family but if you look down through
[54:50] scripture and you look at where god
[54:51] or where jesus went when he was here on
[54:53] earth it was all the places that most
[54:54] people in church wouldn't go
[54:56] right and i heard a man say the other
[54:58] day you know he was he was standing in
[55:00] the
[55:00] he wasn't standing in the temple saying
[55:02] come to me but he was out
[55:04] seeking the people is that right and as
[55:06] christians you know many times we uh
[55:08] you know i i've said it before but you
[55:10] know we see somebody come in here ill
[55:11] dressed and
[55:12] and maybe not right with the lord and we
[55:13] all get nervous how dare they come in
[55:15] here but
[55:16] where else do you want them to go is
[55:17] that right you know there's nothing
[55:18] there's no truth out anywhere
[55:20] else they need to be here and they need
[55:22] to hear the word of god and it shouldn't
[55:23] upset you when somebody comes to church
[55:25] that's maybe
[55:26] not on your standard or on your level
[55:28] but god if if they're being called to
[55:30] this god will do something for them is
[55:31] that right
[55:32] we don't need a bunch of stiff neck
[55:34] message people judging everybody but
[55:36] they're not letting anybody into heaven
[55:37] because it's not your decision anyway if
[55:39] they get in
[55:40] if it was your decision no one would
[55:41] make it it's god's decision it's he who
[55:44] called
[55:44] and so he's the one that has to receive
[55:46] them is that right
[55:48] do you love the lord this morning so we
[55:50] see that when god calls somebody he
[55:52] doesn't change them before they get
[55:53] there but once they get there once they
[55:55] meet him
[55:56] then they're changed amen and so we see
[55:58] gideon begins to look at himself and he
[56:00] begins to say you know my family's poor
[56:02] manas and i'm the least of my father's
[56:04] house and you know you begin to look at
[56:06] david and how god
[56:07] chose david and and you see samuel even
[56:09] went down there and you look and you
[56:11] know
[56:11] even david's own father whenever samuel
[56:14] come and said bring all your sons
[56:16] david's father jesse was so convinced
[56:18] that it wasn't david he said i'm not
[56:19] even going to get david
[56:21] it can't be david and you look down
[56:23] through time and you see people like
[56:24] there's no way this person can be saved
[56:26] there's no way this person can do
[56:28] anything for the lord
[56:29] but if god gets a hold of him it's not
[56:31] the vessel that he's in it's what
[56:32] it's it's what god is in that vessel is
[56:34] that right so we see that even
[56:37] even jesse didn't bring forth david
[56:38] because he's like no there's no way this
[56:40] could be the one and
[56:41] and you know samuel comes down and says
[56:43] well is there anybody else is there is
[56:44] there is there any more and then they
[56:46] they go and get david and
[56:47] and and we find out that's the one that
[56:49] god had chose is that right
[56:51] you look at jericho he come to a
[56:52] prostitute to save
[56:54] to or that lineage had to come through
[56:56] rahab is that right
[56:58] and we see that when joshua or when the
[56:59] spies come over they went to rahab which
[57:01] was a prostitute
[57:02] and god saved her out of the whole city
[57:04] of jericho so it doesn't always make
[57:06] sense the way that god goes it doesn't
[57:08] always make sense the way that the route
[57:10] that god chooses
[57:11] it's not like a gps to where it's just
[57:13] the shortest route or the lowest mileage
[57:15] route god chooses
[57:16] the way that his seed line needs to go
[57:18] god only goes where he is welcome
[57:22] so if you wonder why god's not in your
[57:23] life god's not in your home
[57:25] it's because you have not welcomed him
[57:27] into your life or into your home
[57:30] you can get the best minister up here or
[57:33] the worst minister up here
[57:34] but when you leave the church your
[57:36] salvation your life your spiritual life
[57:38] your spiritual
[57:40] your spiritual faith level is on you
[57:42] it's not on us amen
[57:45] now and the lord said in verse 16 and
[57:47] the lord said unto him surely
[57:48] i will be with thee and thou shalt smite
[57:51] the midianites as one man
[57:53] so we see that the lord said unto him
[57:55] surely i will be with thee
[57:56] and you know moses kind of had this same
[57:58] situation where god called moses in the
[58:00] desert and he said how can i go i can't
[58:02] speak i can't do this
[58:04] and all that god said was to him was
[58:05] what is in thy hand and he had that rod
[58:07] and and you know with with that god took
[58:09] moses a man who couldn't speak a man who
[58:11] would who had maybe had a bad past or
[58:13] been hiding in the desert and god
[58:14] delivered israel
[58:16] through that man not because of moses
[58:17] ability but because of god's
[58:19] ability brother branham says in the
[58:22] evidence of a resurrection in 1950 1958
[58:24] he says come in and abide with us
[58:27] he's speaking on the road to emmaus
[58:28] sorry he's speaking on the road to
[58:29] emmaus and they ask him
[58:31] coming in about with us and he says oh i
[58:33] couldn't ask for him to come in i've
[58:34] been a drunkard i've been a gambler
[58:36] brother brown says i don't care what you
[58:38] are ask him and you find out he will
[58:40] come
[58:41] on your invitation he's never turned one
[58:44] down he never will turn one down he's
[58:46] longing and trying to get into the heart
[58:48] you say
[58:49] i've been a street harlot i don't care
[58:51] what you've been god is trying to work
[58:53] his way into your heart just say come in
[58:55] lord
[58:55] and abide with me and so we see that you
[58:58] know you look down through the scripture
[58:59] when he was invited to
[59:01] i can't remember the names how the name
[59:03] of the house where um
[59:04] the woman came and washed his feet but
[59:07] he was invited to that house is that
[59:09] right
[59:09] and we see that that was a religious
[59:11] person of that day i would call them the
[59:13] staunch message
[59:14] person of the day not a message believer
[59:15] but a message person
[59:17] and see jesus still went is that right
[59:19] but they didn't want jesus to come in
[59:21] they just invited him because of
[59:22] ulterior motives
[59:23] and you see the woman that come in and
[59:25] washed his feet he was able to
[59:27] associate with that woman because she
[59:29] wanted jesus in her life
[59:30] is that right so if you
[59:34] have a need you have to call unto him
[59:36] and and brother bam says he's more
[59:38] anxious to give you the holy ghost than
[59:39] you are to receive it
[59:41] now we see here that after after gideon
[59:44] is called he's given a commandment and
[59:46] i'm going to skip on down to verse 25
[59:48] in judges chapter 6 and verse 25 but you
[59:51] see once he's called he's given a
[59:53] commandment as to what to do
[59:55] but we see in verse 16 he says the lord
[59:56] said to him surely i will be with thee
[59:58] and thou shalt smite the midianites
[1:00:00] as one man so how many of you believe
[1:00:02] that the lord is with you today
[1:00:05] right and so we still are nervous we're
[1:00:08] still
[1:00:08] um sometimes we can get in under
[1:00:11] the spirit of this age where this
[1:00:13] nervousness reigns and or where this
[1:00:14] nervousness rules and we don't know what
[1:00:16] all is going on
[1:00:17] but i can say this if the lord be with
[1:00:19] us then who can be against us is that
[1:00:21] right
[1:00:21] i believe the scripture says that god's
[1:00:23] word will not return unto him void but
[1:00:25] it will accomplish that which he sent it
[1:00:27] to
[1:00:28] and we are the spiritual word of god and
[1:00:30] this day is that right
[1:00:32] so judges 6 and verse 25
[1:00:38] and it came to pass that same night that
[1:00:41] the lord said unto him take thy father's
[1:00:42] young bullock
[1:00:44] even the second bullock of seven years
[1:00:46] old and throw down the altar of baal
[1:00:48] that thy father hath cut down the and
[1:00:51] and
[1:00:52] cut down the grove that is by it so
[1:00:54] pretty much god comes in he says the
[1:00:55] first thing we've got to do is get rid
[1:00:57] of
[1:00:58] satan so that god can come in right and
[1:01:01] so i'm of course typifying this to today
[1:01:03] but
[1:01:03] but god can't come in and abide with
[1:01:05] other things so we've got to first clean
[1:01:07] ourselves out then the lord can come in
[1:01:09] and take
[1:01:10] control in our lives is that right now
[1:01:12] after rahab was saved from jericho she
[1:01:14] could no longer continue on in
[1:01:15] prostitution
[1:01:16] right she had to be changed from that
[1:01:18] moment on do you believe that
[1:01:20] so us as believers once once the lord
[1:01:22] comes in and changes our lives we're
[1:01:24] we you know sanctification justification
[1:01:27] all the way through we're filled with
[1:01:28] the holy ghost we can no longer partake
[1:01:30] of those things it doesn't mean we're
[1:01:31] not going to make mistakes it doesn't
[1:01:32] mean we're not going to trip and stumble
[1:01:34] and do these things
[1:01:35] but we have founded ourselves in jesus
[1:01:37] christ and we do not ever
[1:01:39] question we don't we don't ever look at
[1:01:40] the messenger say is this true is this
[1:01:42] true or is the bible true no we believe
[1:01:44] it
[1:01:44] because faith is our foundation now we
[1:01:47] see that in judges 6 and 26 it says and
[1:01:49] build an altar unto the lord thy god
[1:01:52] upon the top of this rock and i like it
[1:01:54] you know how he wanted them to tear down
[1:01:56] the altar of bell
[1:01:57] which i'm assuming was a really nice
[1:01:59] altar you know they typically
[1:02:01] to other gods the altars were very nice
[1:02:03] but but god didn't want any worship off
[1:02:05] of that altar
[1:02:06] he wanted his own altar is that right so
[1:02:08] you can't go and worship
[1:02:10] under the wrong altar cain had a very
[1:02:12] good altar as we spoke last week and
[1:02:14] and maybe we've seen that abel's altar
[1:02:15] wasn't wasn't the best or whatever but
[1:02:17] but but abel came with the right
[1:02:19] sacrifice is that right
[1:02:21] so we see that he told gideon he says
[1:02:23] tear down the old altar of baal and then
[1:02:24] build a new altar
[1:02:26] unto the lord thy god upon the top of
[1:02:28] this rock
[1:02:29] in the ordered place and take the second
[1:02:31] bullock of a burnt
[1:02:33] sacrifice with the wood of the grove
[1:02:35] which thou shalt cut down
[1:02:36] then gideon took ten men of his servants
[1:02:38] and did as the lord said unto him so it
[1:02:40] was because he feared his father's
[1:02:42] household
[1:02:42] and the men in the city that he could
[1:02:44] not do it by day that he did it by night
[1:02:47] and so brother braham says here in jesus
[1:02:49] christ the same yesterday today and
[1:02:50] forever in 1956 he says you have to be
[1:02:52] in love with the author
[1:02:54] to be able to read between the lines
[1:02:56] because god promised
[1:02:58] and he said it and he had hid it from
[1:03:00] the eyes of the wise and prudent that
[1:03:01] would be able to reveal it to babes as
[1:03:03] such as would learn
[1:03:04] you know the scripture don't you he said
[1:03:06] and so we want you it says it doesn't
[1:03:08] take a degree in theology
[1:03:10] it doesn't take some ba or dd or he says
[1:03:12] the only thing it takes is a humble
[1:03:14] heart surrendered to him
[1:03:16] and that's what does it so we see that
[1:03:17] maybe gideon couldn't explain everything
[1:03:19] that the angel of the lord was telling
[1:03:21] him but he followed
[1:03:23] the orders the angel of the lord he did
[1:03:26] what god
[1:03:26] asked him to do and the men of the city
[1:03:28] they wanted to kill him but god
[1:03:29] but gideon's father said let belle
[1:03:31] defend himself
[1:03:32] and so you know today we look at that
[1:03:34] and and many people maybe cry out
[1:03:36] against the message or when they leave
[1:03:37] it when they leave the message you know
[1:03:39] they begin to crowd against it and
[1:03:40] and you see the baptist maybe leave a
[1:03:42] baptist church and they don't cry out
[1:03:43] against the baptist they just go
[1:03:44] somewhere else and
[1:03:45] i think it's crazy how when message
[1:03:47] people leave they try to cry out against
[1:03:49] the message is that right
[1:03:50] but i would like to see any other
[1:03:52] religion or any other belief
[1:03:53] produce the life that this message has
[1:03:55] produced in this day
[1:03:57] you won't find it anywhere i don't care
[1:03:59] what religion you look at there's
[1:04:00] nothing that can produce a life that is
[1:04:02] this close to jesus christ
[1:04:04] in this day as the message of the hour
[1:04:06] in the scripture is that right
[1:04:08] do you believe that and how faithful and
[1:04:10] thankful as christians we ought to be
[1:04:12] that we've been given
[1:04:13] first class first view to this message
[1:04:16] that god called us to this
[1:04:17] and that god has given us the ability to
[1:04:19] see not without not with our eyes or not
[1:04:21] with our intellect but with our hearts
[1:04:22] to believe that what he has said
[1:04:24] is true
[1:04:29] you know i can i can try to tell my kids
[1:04:32] to believe me and and trust me and
[1:04:34] and even as children you know sometimes
[1:04:36] they'll trust you unconditionally
[1:04:38] but sometimes you have to build their
[1:04:40] trust on certain things is that right
[1:04:42] you know sometimes your kids will tell
[1:04:43] you the truth and maybe they're too
[1:04:45] young you know you got your young kid
[1:04:47] and
[1:04:47] and they may be you know holding the
[1:04:49] broken thing that you asked them if they
[1:04:51] broke and they'll tell you no i didn't
[1:04:52] break it
[1:04:53] and there's no one else around and you
[1:04:55] see that you know
[1:04:56] it's so funny we have to teach kids to
[1:04:59] share but we don't have to teach them to
[1:05:00] fight
[1:05:01] we have to teach them to be nice we
[1:05:03] don't teach them to be mean
[1:05:05] all right you know i kind of wonder you
[1:05:06] know this morning my little girl
[1:05:08] and paxton were fighting over a cinnamon
[1:05:10] roll there's other cinnamon rolls on the
[1:05:12] cabinet
[1:05:13] but she wanted the one that he had and
[1:05:15] it's really funny that how human nature
[1:05:17] how how that it comes down through and
[1:05:19] you can see how human nature affects
[1:05:21] from
[1:05:21] from generation to generation but but
[1:05:23] that spiritual that christ-like nature
[1:05:25] has to come and control that human
[1:05:27] nature is that right
[1:05:28] when we receive the holy ghost we can no
[1:05:30] longer say well my family had a bad
[1:05:32] temper so i can have a bad temper just
[1:05:33] because
[1:05:34] they did and it's like people are like
[1:05:36] well this is my card to have a bad
[1:05:38] timber because my grandpa had a bad
[1:05:40] temper so
[1:05:41] brother branham said you know it's
[1:05:42] passed down but but you've got to read
[1:05:44] into the message a little bit more that
[1:05:45] we've been given the holy ghost which
[1:05:46] overcomes
[1:05:47] that human nature is that right do you
[1:05:50] believe the lord this morning
[1:05:53] and so we see that now gideon is going
[1:05:55] and i'm going to skip on down to judges
[1:05:56] in verse 33 and
[1:05:59] chapter 6 and verse 33 if we could just
[1:06:01] for a few moments and
[1:06:05] you know you look at your life many
[1:06:07] times and you kind of wonder why you're
[1:06:08] going through the things you're you're
[1:06:09] going through and i always go back to to
[1:06:11] john
[1:06:11] and whoever this is for you kind of
[1:06:14] wonder about the decisions that you've
[1:06:16] made and
[1:06:17] i wonder you know why has this happened
[1:06:18] and why is this befalling me and why is
[1:06:20] all this going on
[1:06:21] i always go back to john chapter nine
[1:06:22] and it's one of the
[1:06:24] probably one of the most uh to me one of
[1:06:26] the most things that's helped me in
[1:06:27] scripture as far as looking
[1:06:28] looking back and seeing him you know uh
[1:06:31] jesus and his disciples are walking
[1:06:32] through and they come upon a blind man
[1:06:34] and he's sitting at the gate and
[1:06:35] the disciples ask jesus a simple
[1:06:37] question they say you know why was it
[1:06:39] and he was blind from birth
[1:06:40] you know the story and they say you know
[1:06:41] why was this man blind from birth was it
[1:06:43] because he sinned or because his parents
[1:06:45] sin
[1:06:45] and so jesus said is neither but that
[1:06:48] the works of god would be made manifest
[1:06:50] in his life and so you look at that
[1:06:52] story and and
[1:06:53] the the young man was was blind
[1:06:57] at birth just so god could be manifested
[1:07:00] in his life and
[1:07:01] so many times you maybe can't explain
[1:07:03] why your family why you're going through
[1:07:04] what you're going through
[1:07:06] but i would always take it back to john
[1:07:07] chapter 9 and saying so that the works
[1:07:09] of god can be made manifest in this day
[1:07:12] through my life amen so whoever that was
[1:07:14] for whatever you're going through this
[1:07:15] morning maybe you've been questioned on
[1:07:16] the way to church you've been wondering
[1:07:18] why am i going through this why is this
[1:07:19] but follow me why is this happening to
[1:07:21] me
[1:07:21] so that the works of god if you're a
[1:07:23] believer it's because the works of god
[1:07:25] need to be made manifest
[1:07:26] through your life amen judges 6 and
[1:07:29] verse 33 and he says
[1:07:30] then all the midianites and the
[1:07:32] amalekites and the children of the east
[1:07:33] gathered together and went over and
[1:07:35] pitched in the valley of jezreel
[1:07:37] but the spirit of the lord came upon
[1:07:39] getting and he blew a trumpet and abuser
[1:07:41] was gathered after
[1:07:42] him and they he sent messengers all
[1:07:44] through manasseh and were all gathered
[1:07:46] after him and he sent
[1:07:47] messengers into asher and zebulun and
[1:07:49] and fatili
[1:07:51] and they came up to meet him and so we
[1:07:54] see that now he's sending out a message
[1:07:55] a message is going forth
[1:07:57] come and fight so they're finally
[1:07:59] they're gaining strength you see that
[1:08:01] from what gideon had done to the altar
[1:08:03] of bell they're now kind of taking
[1:08:04] strength so gideon sends out a message
[1:08:06] and we go into judges in verse 7 2 and
[1:08:08] the lord said in the beginning the
[1:08:09] people and we know that there was a
[1:08:11] great army that come up
[1:08:12] and i i know i'm skipping down through
[1:08:14] this but you need to go read judges six
[1:08:15] and seven and you can kind of do that
[1:08:17] this afternoon and and so we see that
[1:08:19] gideon had done this then a great and
[1:08:21] mighty army had came
[1:08:23] it still wasn't as as great as the
[1:08:24] enemy's army but it was it was more than
[1:08:26] what they thought they would get
[1:08:27] you know it was like well you know we
[1:08:29] can we can maybe have a shot at this
[1:08:30] well if not we're gonna at least put a
[1:08:32] den in them right
[1:08:34] and you know sometimes you know you you
[1:08:37] feel really good you know
[1:08:38] i'm coaching a little league baseball
[1:08:39] team right now and and mattie's on the
[1:08:41] team and
[1:08:42] you know i'm not a very competitive i'm
[1:08:44] competitive with myself but i'm not
[1:08:45] competitive with other people and if
[1:08:47] if you don't like sports analogies or
[1:08:48] sports i'm very sorry but i'm about to
[1:08:50] talk about it for a few minutes
[1:08:52] and you look and you know we have a we
[1:08:53] have a young team and and you know
[1:08:55] whenever they call the coaches i didn't
[1:08:56] want to coach but they didn't have
[1:08:58] anybody else so they're like you know i
[1:08:59] was like
[1:09:00] runner up runner up runner up you know
[1:09:02] set fourth string or so and
[1:09:04] you know i was like well the kids do
[1:09:05] need to be outside at least we can show
[1:09:07] them how to play and move and run around
[1:09:08] and do this and
[1:09:09] and so i agreed to do it and you know we
[1:09:11] got the team and
[1:09:13] you know last year because of covert a
[1:09:14] lot of players come out that never
[1:09:15] played baseball before
[1:09:17] right and so you know as message people
[1:09:19] sometimes we we see a new convert we
[1:09:21] just expect them to all of a sudden know
[1:09:23] everything about the message and we
[1:09:24] judge them by that well you
[1:09:25] you're too young to understand this and
[1:09:27] we treat them differently
[1:09:29] i think that's a hundred percent wrong
[1:09:32] amen
[1:09:32] and so we look at then so i get this
[1:09:34] team and you know there's kids taking
[1:09:35] plastic off of gloves kids wearing it on
[1:09:37] the wrong hand
[1:09:38] and you know we had one kid batting
[1:09:40] right hand 90
[1:09:42] of the season just to find out oh he's
[1:09:43] left-handed you know and he walks up to
[1:09:45] the plate and he always had his hands
[1:09:46] backward i'm like what did come on i was
[1:09:47] like come on man turn him around
[1:09:49] and then all of a sudden he got up and
[1:09:51] he went to the left side of the plate i
[1:09:52] was like you know what try it you know
[1:09:53] you ain't hitting it the other way
[1:09:54] and he hits it so you see that sometimes
[1:09:56] we we try to fit people to what we think
[1:09:58] they should be
[1:10:00] and so we see new people coming to the
[1:10:01] message like well this is what group you
[1:10:03] have to associate this is what you have
[1:10:04] to be
[1:10:05] and there's only one thing that we have
[1:10:06] to be and that's christians is that
[1:10:07] right we ought to be able to associate
[1:10:09] with anybody in the message no matter
[1:10:10] you know
[1:10:11] what what part or what church they go to
[1:10:13] we ought to be able to associate
[1:10:14] any person in the message around the
[1:10:16] word of god now we may not agree on
[1:10:18] everything me and brother me and brother
[1:10:19] joel may not agree on everything
[1:10:21] but we still have to be able to ride in
[1:10:22] the same boat we're going in the same
[1:10:23] rapture to meet the same lord we've got
[1:10:25] to be able to get along is that right
[1:10:27] christ has to mean more than what
[1:10:29] brother joel believes or what i believe
[1:10:30] it has to mean more that i got to love
[1:10:32] my brother because that's what god told
[1:10:34] me to do and he said if i don't have
[1:10:35] love then i'm not his
[1:10:37] and so we see we look at this and you
[1:10:38] know we get this team and and i know
[1:10:40] we're going to be one of the worst teams
[1:10:42] and it's it's no offense to the boys
[1:10:43] it's just they they haven't been trained
[1:10:45] they don't know about it but we're going
[1:10:47] to give it all and i'm like you know i'm
[1:10:48] not competitive we're just here to just
[1:10:49] have fun
[1:10:51] so that's what i told them we're just
[1:10:52] here to have fun we're just here to have
[1:10:53] a good time and learn and
[1:10:54] and do this and do that and so i
[1:10:57] realized
[1:10:58] that as i told them that we were just
[1:10:59] here to have fun that's all they heard
[1:11:01] so they weren't trying to win they were
[1:11:03] trying to just have fun
[1:11:05] and then i would be in the dugout
[1:11:06] yelling like quit picking flowers
[1:11:08] but to the outfield that was fun and
[1:11:10] coach you said just have fun
[1:11:13] and so you know i begin to learn i begin
[1:11:15] to talk with other coaches like you know
[1:11:16] i've got to quit saying that because
[1:11:18] they're fine with losing because they're
[1:11:21] having fun
[1:11:23] and you know i think as as as believers
[1:11:26] we can get
[1:11:27] accompanied we're okay with losing we
[1:11:30] lose one battle we're like well
[1:11:31] god said he'd forgive me i pick back up
[1:11:34] and the next battle we almost don't even
[1:11:35] try
[1:11:36] right and so we've got to we've got to
[1:11:38] come to a point where losing's not an
[1:11:40] option it's not okay
[1:11:42] and it's something that you can't get so
[1:11:44] beat up about that you won't
[1:11:45] do anything else you know i could i
[1:11:47] could go and preach the boys if you
[1:11:48] don't win
[1:11:49] season's over we're done and then they
[1:11:52] lose what happens well then they're over
[1:11:54] right and as as christians i believe
[1:11:56] it's been preached many times
[1:11:57] maybe definitely not here but back in
[1:11:59] the back in the older times you know i
[1:12:01] you know it was hellfire and brimstone
[1:12:02] when i was growing up
[1:12:04] you looked the wrong way you were going
[1:12:05] to hell i mean that's just the way it
[1:12:07] was
[1:12:08] and it's not that maybe that that
[1:12:09] preaching is wrong
[1:12:11] but i believe we've got to come as
[1:12:12] message believer we've got to be able to
[1:12:13] see what's in the word of god because we
[1:12:15] know brother brandon made mistakes
[1:12:16] is that right you know i mean that's
[1:12:18] just he said that i'm not saying that
[1:12:19] that's what he said
[1:12:20] and so we see that he was a man and we
[1:12:22] see many times as
[1:12:24] as believers we begin to think well then
[1:12:26] we get associated well on the other side
[1:12:28] where we cut
[1:12:28] part of a bigger church we're like well
[1:12:30] if we get a bigger church everything
[1:12:31] will go easier that's not right
[1:12:33] anytime you get more people together you
[1:12:34] can have more opinions more problems
[1:12:36] right now if they're all filled with the
[1:12:38] holy ghost you're going to have a mighty
[1:12:39] army
[1:12:41] so we'll get to that but we i begin to
[1:12:42] look at the boys and then you begin to
[1:12:43] identify the positions that they need to
[1:12:45] play because there's some that just
[1:12:46] can't play this or can't play that or
[1:12:48] can't do this and
[1:12:49] and you know you begin to you know see
[1:12:52] well this one knows what he's doing this
[1:12:53] one knows what
[1:12:54] they're not doing and and many times you
[1:12:56] know you you look and there's there's
[1:12:57] people that come into this message and
[1:12:59] we just automatically say well they can
[1:13:00] do this or they can do that
[1:13:02] and we don't let god position to replace
[1:13:03] them but we try to choose and try to put
[1:13:05] it all together
[1:13:06] and so we see that in judges chapter 6
[1:13:08] and verse 33 then all the midianites
[1:13:10] and the amalekites and the children of
[1:13:12] israel gathered together and went over
[1:13:13] and pitched in the valley of jezreel but
[1:13:15] the spirit of the lord came upon gideon
[1:13:17] he blew a trumpet and he called in this
[1:13:18] army is that right now we're going to
[1:13:20] skip on down to judges seven and verse
[1:13:22] two and the lord said in the gideon the
[1:13:23] people that are with thee
[1:13:25] are too many for me to give the
[1:13:26] midianites into their hand lest israel
[1:13:28] vaunt themselves against me saying my
[1:13:30] own hand has saved me
[1:13:33] and so back to my little league team
[1:13:35] here when they win
[1:13:36] it's because they've tried really really
[1:13:38] hard right
[1:13:40] because they've given it their all
[1:13:41] they're not the team that's supposed to
[1:13:42] win
[1:13:43] but when they win they've given their
[1:13:45] all and you know many people
[1:13:48] and i was i was preaching that mindset
[1:13:49] of just have fun just have fun well they
[1:13:51] got associated with it's okay to lose
[1:13:53] and
[1:13:53] and you know it's it's okay to do this
[1:13:55] it's okay not to try and
[1:13:57] and i believe as christians we can never
[1:13:59] get that complacent mindset
[1:14:00] where you know maybe you're not sinning
[1:14:03] but maybe you're not going to where god
[1:14:04] needs you to go
[1:14:06] maybe you're not going just that little
[1:14:07] bit extra that god needs you to go is
[1:14:09] that right because the church needs help
[1:14:11] we need people in the church to assist
[1:14:12] we need people in the church to pray
[1:14:14] we need people in the church to do
[1:14:15] specific things and you can just sit
[1:14:17] there and say well i'm not doing
[1:14:18] anything wrong
[1:14:19] but you're complacent with just being
[1:14:21] okay just having fun
[1:14:23] because you're doing what god called you
[1:14:24] to do you're doing this you're doing
[1:14:26] that
[1:14:26] and then it begins to come to a point to
[1:14:28] where we're going to say well i'm doing
[1:14:29] this by myself because you don't need
[1:14:30] god because you can do that
[1:14:33] but remember god he brings you to the
[1:14:35] test to teach you the lesson he doesn't
[1:14:37] give you the lesson and then give you
[1:14:38] the test
[1:14:39] and so we see that they get that god
[1:14:41] knows israel he knows that if
[1:14:43] they go down there with too many people
[1:14:44] they're going to say hey we did this
[1:14:45] ourselves this is we we did this
[1:14:47] and so we see that that judges uh in
[1:14:50] verse seven between seven and
[1:14:52] uh chapter seven and verse seven we see
[1:14:54] that gideon comes down to the people
[1:14:55] says hey
[1:14:56] anybody who's afraid or fearful go ahead
[1:14:58] and go home
[1:15:00] all right he says that it's plain and
[1:15:02] simple cut and dry so those who were
[1:15:04] afraid and really didn't want to be
[1:15:05] there went home
[1:15:06] and i believe the army went down to
[1:15:07] around went from 32 000 to around
[1:15:10] 10 000 i believe is is what was left i
[1:15:12] think if i'm doing the math correctly
[1:15:13] there i think there's about 10 000
[1:15:15] left and so we see that you know
[1:15:19] god doesn't deal in numbers i think this
[1:15:20] story ought to show people that god
[1:15:22] doesn't deal in numbers because if he
[1:15:23] wanted
[1:15:24] great numbers he would have kept the
[1:15:25] great numbers is that right but god
[1:15:27] likes to receive the glory
[1:15:29] and as christians we ought to be the
[1:15:30] type of people that likes to give god
[1:15:32] the glory
[1:15:34] so we see that gideon come down he said
[1:15:35] who's whosoever is fearful and afraid
[1:15:37] let him return
[1:15:38] and so you know god doesn't want any
[1:15:40] chickens in his army is that right
[1:15:42] god doesn't want somebody that's afraid
[1:15:43] to to follow him into battle
[1:15:47] and you know it seemed kind of and i
[1:15:48] spoke on this several years ago but it
[1:15:50] seemed like
[1:15:51] that came through the message several
[1:15:52] years ago when everybody was questioning
[1:15:54] the cloud and questioning this and
[1:15:55] questioning that and
[1:15:56] and the bridge and you see that
[1:15:58] everybody was fearful and afraid what
[1:15:59] they do they left
[1:16:00] like oh man science is here we should be
[1:16:04] afraid
[1:16:05] and so what did they do they left
[1:16:06] because you look at their arm and
[1:16:08] they're like well we're 32 000
[1:16:09] going against an army that can't be
[1:16:11] numbered scientifically they should not
[1:16:13] win
[1:16:15] now it's really funny to me that the
[1:16:17] little league team we've lost
[1:16:19] every time but once but every day or
[1:16:22] every game day the kids still show back
[1:16:24] up
[1:16:25] right and as message believers it
[1:16:26] doesn't matter how many times you've
[1:16:28] lost
[1:16:28] you still need to show up is that right
[1:16:30] you say well the church has went through
[1:16:31] this well you still need to show up
[1:16:33] oh well i don't like the ministers
[1:16:35] that's preaching this morning we tricked
[1:16:36] you we had stewart coming you put me out
[1:16:38] but hey you still got to show up is that
[1:16:40] right
[1:16:41] so we see that the lord even comes down
[1:16:43] and says hey the people are still yet
[1:16:44] too many because god needs to receive
[1:16:46] the glory is that right and as
[1:16:48] christians we ought to be willing or
[1:16:49] wanting god to receive the glory we
[1:16:51] ought to we
[1:16:52] we have the ability to praise him to
[1:16:54] worship him and we shouldn't let anybody
[1:16:55] else
[1:16:56] take away our ability to praise and
[1:16:58] worship our lord and so we see that the
[1:17:00] the
[1:17:00] the the angel lord spoke to gideon and
[1:17:02] said only those who drink a certain way
[1:17:05] can come in it had to be a certain way
[1:17:07] and i'm not going to go into that but in
[1:17:08] judges seven and seven and they went
[1:17:10] from ten thousand i believe to around
[1:17:12] three hundred
[1:17:13] and the lord said unto gideon by the
[1:17:14] three 300 men that lapped will i
[1:17:16] save you and deliver the midianites into
[1:17:18] thine hand and let all other people who
[1:17:20] go
[1:17:21] every man into his place
[1:17:24] now we see here that the the angel lord
[1:17:26] these these other men these i guess it
[1:17:28] would be eleven thousand
[1:17:29] seven hundred or excuse me nine thousand
[1:17:31] seven hundred men they wanted to be
[1:17:32] there
[1:17:34] right they they wanted to be there and i
[1:17:36] always go back to you know looking at
[1:17:37] the scripture many are called but few
[1:17:39] were chosen is that right
[1:17:40] and these three hundred men were chosen
[1:17:42] of god they weren't they they they
[1:17:43] weren't the ones that just wanted to be
[1:17:44] there but they were the chosen of god
[1:17:46] so we see that you you look entire you
[1:17:48] look at life and you see many people
[1:17:50] want to believe this message and you see
[1:17:51] them come in
[1:17:52] occasionally they know it's the truth
[1:17:54] they cannot deny it because
[1:17:55] no matter how hard they look they cannot
[1:17:57] deny that this message is not real
[1:18:00] that it's not true that it's not lining
[1:18:02] with the scripture
[1:18:03] but still it almost seems that there's
[1:18:04] something about them they just can't go
[1:18:06] all the way
[1:18:06] but these 300 they were called to go all
[1:18:09] the way and we see that in in verse
[1:18:11] seven and deliver the midi night into
[1:18:13] thine hand
[1:18:14] and let all their people go every man to
[1:18:15] his place so the people took victuals in
[1:18:17] their hands
[1:18:18] and their trumpets and he sent the all
[1:18:19] the men rest of israel every man into
[1:18:21] his tent and retained those 300 men and
[1:18:23] the host of midian was beneath him
[1:18:25] in the valley and one thing that i've
[1:18:26] never really looked at
[1:18:28] or even thought about until this morning
[1:18:30] when i was reading is like man what did
[1:18:31] the rest of israel have to be thinking
[1:18:33] like man we got we got gideon 32 000 men
[1:18:37] and this sends every one of them
[1:18:39] home but 300.
[1:18:41] all right and sometimes we look at that
[1:18:44] and we're like man
[1:18:46] everything that we're going through
[1:18:47] everything that we've got going on and
[1:18:48] you really want to call this person to
[1:18:50] preach
[1:18:52] well i don't like the way they preach
[1:18:54] well
[1:18:55] sometimes we don't like the way you all
[1:18:56] worship right we don't like the way you
[1:18:58] all pull sometimes you pull ways we
[1:19:00] don't want to be pulled on
[1:19:02] and i don't mean that mean but we look
[1:19:06] at it and we're like man what is going
[1:19:07] on why has god done why is god choosing
[1:19:10] this one to do it
[1:19:11] and i think the main thing is as
[1:19:12] believers is once god chooses his man
[1:19:14] we've got to follow that right
[1:19:17] you know it's not where well god chooses
[1:19:18] this one well i didn't like you i'm
[1:19:20] going to leave and i'm going to go over
[1:19:21] here that's not what god called us to do
[1:19:23] he called us to get behind
[1:19:24] and follow that man into the rapture is
[1:19:26] that right now we're not following a man
[1:19:28] but that man is following christ
[1:19:29] is that right our pastor is following
[1:19:30] christ and we are following christ
[1:19:32] through him is that right
[1:19:34] now judges seven and eight
[1:19:38] and so we see that the host is below
[1:19:40] them in the valley verse nine and it
[1:19:41] came to pass the same night the lord
[1:19:42] said unto him arise
[1:19:44] and get thee down to the host for i
[1:19:45] delivered into thy hand and we see that
[1:19:47] gideon was beginning to
[1:19:48] he's always dealt with fear through this
[1:19:50] or you know he always you know he always
[1:19:52] asked god for a sign you know at first
[1:19:53] it was the
[1:19:54] uh i believe he actually put the the
[1:19:56] unleavened cakes and the
[1:19:58] and the kid upon the rock and the angel
[1:20:00] lord reached out and touched it and
[1:20:01] consumed it
[1:20:02] then he also wanted the dew to fall on
[1:20:04] the wool
[1:20:05] and not on the ground around it god did
[1:20:07] that and he said okay
[1:20:08] he said let me do it one more time i
[1:20:11] need one more sign he says now i want
[1:20:12] the dude to fall around on the ground
[1:20:14] and not on the
[1:20:14] not on the fleece right so god does it
[1:20:16] again and so time after time god is
[1:20:18] reassuring gideon reassuring gideon
[1:20:20] and you know it's not that we question
[1:20:22] god but we look back and we look at our
[1:20:24] testimonies and we see that those are
[1:20:25] those are testimonies that god has given
[1:20:27] us to look back at and say this is what
[1:20:28] god did for me here and if he did that
[1:20:30] he can do this now
[1:20:32] and so he sees you know i've delivered
[1:20:33] into thy hand in verse 10 but fear
[1:20:35] but if thou fear to go down go thou with
[1:20:38] thy servant or
[1:20:40] fear of thy servant to the host and thou
[1:20:42] shalt hear what they say
[1:20:44] and so verse 10 but if thou fear go down
[1:20:47] with pure thy thy servant to the host
[1:20:49] and so we see obviously gideon went down
[1:20:51] so he was still fearing a little bit
[1:20:54] right and they went down his servant
[1:20:56] onto the outside of the armed men that
[1:20:57] were in the host of the midianites and
[1:20:58] the amla kites and all the children of
[1:20:59] the east lay along the valley like
[1:21:01] grasshoppers for multitude
[1:21:02] and their camels were without number as
[1:21:05] by the sand by the sea
[1:21:06] sea side for a multitude now uh
[1:21:09] looking at this as believers in this day
[1:21:12] you know
[1:21:13] we look at this and we say man they're
[1:21:15] really outnumbered you have to wonder
[1:21:17] what's going through their head what's
[1:21:18] going through their minds
[1:21:19] but we always have to go back if god be
[1:21:21] for us who can be against us
[1:21:22] now and gideon was come and behold there
[1:21:24] was a man that told a dream unto his
[1:21:25] fellow
[1:21:26] and said behold i dreamed a dream and
[1:21:27] low a cake of barley
[1:21:29] tumbled into the host of midian and came
[1:21:31] into attendance and smote it that fell
[1:21:33] and overturned it and the tent lay long
[1:21:36] and his fellow answered and said there
[1:21:38] is this this is nothing else save the
[1:21:40] sword of gideon the son of joash a man
[1:21:42] of israel
[1:21:43] for into his hand that god delivered
[1:21:44] midian and all the hosts and so we see
[1:21:46] that
[1:21:47] god had the angel lord had sent getting
[1:21:49] down there to hear the
[1:21:50] enemy testifying that they were afraid
[1:21:52] of gideon
[1:21:54] now i always you know i look at the
[1:21:56] scripture and brother branham says you
[1:21:57] know
[1:21:58] the the enemy is trembling right hell
[1:22:00] trembles when the believer hits his
[1:22:02] knees is that right
[1:22:03] all of hell begins to tremble and i
[1:22:04] think as believers we forget the power
[1:22:07] or the authority that we have and the
[1:22:08] power of jesus christ that when we pray
[1:22:10] mountains have to move is that right
[1:22:12] when we ask anything in jesus name it
[1:22:14] has to be given to us
[1:22:16] is that right and i believe as
[1:22:17] christians we kind of nulled that down
[1:22:18] and
[1:22:19] and you know what the scripture where it
[1:22:20] says the word is nigh thee we've kind of
[1:22:22] been like well
[1:22:22] you know well they have medicine and we
[1:22:24] have doctors nowadays and i'm not
[1:22:25] telling you not to take your medicine or
[1:22:26] not not telling you to do this or do
[1:22:28] that
[1:22:29] but i'm telling you our faith has kind
[1:22:30] of been weakened with the scientific age
[1:22:32] is that right where we say well
[1:22:34] well i can just do this or i can take
[1:22:35] this headache medicine we don't even ask
[1:22:37] god anymore to heal us because we have
[1:22:38] all these other routes
[1:22:40] but see gideon in israel they had no
[1:22:42] other way this was it
[1:22:43] if they didn't want the land to besiege
[1:22:44] them if they didn't want to to have
[1:22:46] everything taken away from them the rest
[1:22:47] of the life this is the only way that
[1:22:49] they could go
[1:22:50] and it was so that when gideon heard of
[1:22:52] them telling the dream the
[1:22:52] interpretation thereof
[1:22:54] that he worshipped and returned to the
[1:22:56] host of israel and said arise
[1:22:58] for the lord had delivered uh into your
[1:23:00] hand the host of midian i love that
[1:23:02] before the battle he begins to worship
[1:23:04] and i believe as christians and
[1:23:06] believers of jesus christ
[1:23:08] we we don't put enough on worship and
[1:23:10] i'm not obviously you see me i don't
[1:23:11] jump up and down i don't run around the
[1:23:13] church and it's not that that's wrong
[1:23:14] but
[1:23:15] it's just the way that i worship i may
[1:23:17] cry and i may sing and i may do these
[1:23:18] things where somebody else may shout or
[1:23:20] speak in tongues and that's what you're
[1:23:21] called to do
[1:23:22] but i believe we all have our form of
[1:23:24] worship that we have to worship the lord
[1:23:26] is that right
[1:23:27] i don't care how you worship if you
[1:23:29] scream or you shout or you lift your
[1:23:30] hands and cry as long as you're
[1:23:31] worshipping him
[1:23:33] that's what counts is that right and so
[1:23:35] we see that gideon but even before the
[1:23:36] battle began to worship the lord because
[1:23:38] he heard
[1:23:39] the testimony of his enemies and so as
[1:23:41] believers we can look through the bible
[1:23:43] and we can see the testimony we know how
[1:23:44] this story is going to end we ought to
[1:23:46] be able freely to worship
[1:23:48] jesus christ in verse 16 and he divided
[1:23:51] the 300 men into three companies he put
[1:23:52] a trumpet in every man's hand
[1:23:55] so we see that out of the 300 everybody
[1:23:57] had a part to play
[1:23:58] is that right gideon didn't come down
[1:24:02] and look at this one and look at that
[1:24:03] one and say hey you know what we've got
[1:24:05] these 275 we're good the rest of you can
[1:24:07] go home
[1:24:08] no god who god had chosen gideon
[1:24:11] used is that right so everybody had a
[1:24:13] part to play so if god has chosen you
[1:24:15] you have a part to play
[1:24:17] in the bride of jesus christ and he gave
[1:24:19] them with empty pictures and lamps
[1:24:20] with the pictures and he said to them
[1:24:22] look on me and do likewise and behold
[1:24:24] when i come to the outside of the camp
[1:24:26] it shall be that
[1:24:27] as i do so shall ye do
[1:24:30] when i blow with the trumpet and i and
[1:24:33] all that are with me then blow ye the
[1:24:34] trumpets also
[1:24:35] everyone on side of the camp and say the
[1:24:37] sword of the lord and of gideon
[1:24:39] so gideon and the the hundred men that
[1:24:41] were with him
[1:24:43] came to the outside of the camp
[1:24:44] beginning at the middle watch
[1:24:46] and they had but newly set the watch
[1:24:48] when they blew the trumpets
[1:24:49] and break the pictures that were in
[1:24:50] their hands and the three companies blew
[1:24:52] the trumpets and break the pitchers and
[1:24:54] held the lamps in their hands
[1:24:55] and the trumpets in the right hands to
[1:24:57] blow with all and they cried the sword
[1:24:58] of the lord
[1:24:59] and gideon so we see that that light
[1:25:01] just to just go here for a minute it was
[1:25:03] no good in the picture
[1:25:04] right it had to be broken to see that
[1:25:06] light is that right
[1:25:07] so we see many times as we are the
[1:25:09] vessels of as we are the vessels of god
[1:25:11] sometimes
[1:25:12] we have to be broken to let that light
[1:25:13] shine you know many times we don't know
[1:25:15] we
[1:25:16] we don't know how gideon would have been
[1:25:17] if he hadn't followed the will of the
[1:25:18] lord but when he followed the will of
[1:25:20] the lord him and 300 men
[1:25:21] overcame a mighty army is that right and
[1:25:24] the 300 blue trumpets the lord said
[1:25:25] every man's sword against this fellow
[1:25:28] even throughout all the hosts and the
[1:25:29] hosts fled
[1:25:31] and and and the border of the or
[1:25:33] tomorrow and to tabitha so we see that
[1:25:35] they continued to chase them
[1:25:37] after they defeated him now brother
[1:25:39] branham says and i know my redeemer
[1:25:40] lives he says and oh how that coincides
[1:25:42] this morning with faith the living faith
[1:25:43] of the living god in his church
[1:25:45] there's something in our hearts that
[1:25:46] speaks that there's a land beyond the
[1:25:48] river do you believe that
[1:25:50] he said i cannot put my finger on that
[1:25:51] land and neither can any
[1:25:53] any man but there's something within us
[1:25:54] that tells us the grave is not our goal
[1:25:57] he said in dust thou art or dust our
[1:25:59] eternance is not spoken of the soul
[1:26:01] he said there's something within us a
[1:26:02] fire that's burning a light that's been
[1:26:04] lit by
[1:26:05] god and no breeze can blow it out so i
[1:26:07] don't care what you've been through what
[1:26:08] you're going through currently there's
[1:26:10] there's a light on the inside of you if
[1:26:12] you've been filled with the holy ghost
[1:26:13] that nothing can blow it out
[1:26:14] he said there's no cold spells in the
[1:26:16] church there's no indifference amongst
[1:26:18] the people no persecution
[1:26:20] in the world that can blow out that
[1:26:21] flame that god has lit and i'll say this
[1:26:23] this morning christ has to mean more
[1:26:25] than whatever you're going through if
[1:26:27] you want to see it in a rapture
[1:26:28] he said for god's purpose that his torch
[1:26:31] light of freedom will burn until the
[1:26:33] coming of our lord
[1:26:34] he said and no powers can blow it out
[1:26:36] they will only make it burn
[1:26:37] brighter as they blow do you believe
[1:26:40] that this morning
[1:26:41] so christ has to mean more to you than
[1:26:43] your family than your friends than your
[1:26:45] pastor than your song leader than your
[1:26:46] colleagues
[1:26:47] then your work associates he has to mean
[1:26:50] more than anything you have to be solely
[1:26:52] focused on him
[1:26:53] that no matter what comes or what goes
[1:26:55] you keep your eyes focused
[1:26:57] on the prize isaiah 43 and 2 it says
[1:26:59] when thou passes through the waters
[1:27:01] i will be with thee and through the
[1:27:03] rivers they shall not overflow thee when
[1:27:04] thou walkest through the fire
[1:27:06] thou shall not be burned neither shall
[1:27:08] the flame kindle upon thee
[1:27:11] and so we see that god gives us the test
[1:27:13] before he gives us a lesson
[1:27:15] you look at the three hebrew children
[1:27:16] that were thrown into the fire they
[1:27:18] weren't told before they were thrown in
[1:27:19] that they weren't gonna burn
[1:27:21] but once they got in they realized they
[1:27:22] weren't on fire right
[1:27:24] and in laodicea we weren't told that we
[1:27:26] wouldn't fail we weren't told this or
[1:27:27] that but now that we realize we've got
[1:27:29] that holy ghost on the inside he hasn't
[1:27:31] got us yet and he's
[1:27:32] not going to be able to overcome us amen
[1:27:34] the same spirit that was in jesus is now
[1:27:36] in you and i and it overcomes satan in
[1:27:38] that day and it will overcome satan
[1:27:40] in this day amen psalms 138 and 7 it
[1:27:43] says though i walk in the midst of
[1:27:45] trouble that will revive me
[1:27:48] you know you i don't know if you've ever
[1:27:49] seen anybody give cpr before but
[1:27:51] you know they somebody that's drowning
[1:27:53] or somebody that's been in an accident
[1:27:54] or something
[1:27:55] they can revive them through cpr they
[1:27:56] weren't completely dead but they can
[1:27:58] revive them through cpr
[1:28:00] and it says you know though i walk in
[1:28:01] the midst of trouble that will revive me
[1:28:03] and many times we feel like it's over we
[1:28:05] feel like we
[1:28:05] we can't go any further but the lord
[1:28:07] comes and revives us he says thou shalt
[1:28:09] stretch forth on hand
[1:28:11] the wrath of my enemies and thy right
[1:28:13] hand shall save me
[1:28:14] the lord will perfect that which
[1:28:16] concerneth me
[1:28:18] man i love that the lord will perfect
[1:28:20] that which concerneth me
[1:28:22] that means if it's even to deal with you
[1:28:24] in your life the lord will perfect it
[1:28:26] whatever is going on you say well god
[1:28:28] doesn't deal in work or doesn't deal
[1:28:29] with this yes he does if it concerns you
[1:28:31] and your life as a believer god deals
[1:28:33] with it
[1:28:34] he said well god doesn't look at my job
[1:28:35] or my bank account if it concerns you
[1:28:38] god will perfect it if you'll let him is
[1:28:39] that right you say well it's always been
[1:28:41] like this my family's the poorest my i'm
[1:28:43] the least in my family but if it
[1:28:44] concerns you
[1:28:45] and you're a child of god god will
[1:28:47] perfect it he said thy mercy o lord
[1:28:49] endureth forever forsake not the works
[1:28:52] of thine own hands and we know that he
[1:28:54] is the potter and we are the clay is
[1:28:56] that right
[1:28:58] read this just as i come to a close just
[1:29:00] here in a few moments and
[1:29:01] brother madam says he says in exposition
[1:29:04] of the seven church jesus
[1:29:06] it's written he says every time the lord
[1:29:07] uses those words fear not
[1:29:10] there's an engagement at hand which
[1:29:11] involves great danger
[1:29:13] suffering and deprivation he says no he
[1:29:16] does not say in a blunt current manner
[1:29:18] tribulation is coming
[1:29:19] he said that would frighten one he says
[1:29:21] but like a mother who's about
[1:29:23] to turn out the light gently says to her
[1:29:25] child lest he be frightened now don't be
[1:29:26] afraid
[1:29:27] for the light will go out and it'll be
[1:29:29] dark but remember i'm here with you
[1:29:32] he says so he says don't be afraid of
[1:29:34] what man or what he can do to you he
[1:29:36] says i am with you my grace is
[1:29:37] sufficient
[1:29:38] for you when you pass through the waters
[1:29:40] they will not overflow you
[1:29:41] not even death are you defeated you are
[1:29:44] more
[1:29:45] than conquerors and i love that how he
[1:29:47] compares it to a mom that's about to
[1:29:49] turn out the light
[1:29:50] he says no matter if you can't see no
[1:29:51] matter the light goes dim i am here with
[1:29:53] you and that's what matters is that
[1:29:55] christ
[1:29:55] is here with us do you believe that
[1:29:58] brother brahman says as i was with moses
[1:29:59] in 51 it says let him that is weak say i
[1:30:01] am strong
[1:30:02] and how many times how many times we've
[1:30:04] tried to do that in our life and it
[1:30:05] seems almost
[1:30:06] almost ludicrous for us to say that but
[1:30:08] when we say when we're weak we say i am
[1:30:10] strong
[1:30:11] he said you're just saying in your heart
[1:30:13] now that i am strong he says i've
[1:30:15] accepted jesus as my healer
[1:30:16] and never have a negative testimony
[1:30:19] anymore
[1:30:21] he said just believe it and i've told
[1:30:23] you all of my
[1:30:24] my i like to write things down and i've
[1:30:26] tried this not to be negative for a full
[1:30:28] day and man is it difficult
[1:30:30] especially if you work with other human
[1:30:31] beings if you're married it's difficult
[1:30:34] if you have kids it's difficult if you
[1:30:36] go to church it's difficult
[1:30:38] but god called us to overcome the
[1:30:40] difficult things is that right
[1:30:42] never ever have a negative testimony
[1:30:44] anymore when you feel like going up to
[1:30:46] that person at church and tell them
[1:30:47] everything that's wrong with you
[1:30:49] instead of that stop think for a moment
[1:30:51] and go tell them everything that you got
[1:30:52] good going on in your life
[1:30:54] and if you speak more good things god
[1:30:55] will give you more good things is that
[1:30:57] right
[1:30:58] so he said just believe it god is under
[1:31:00] obligation he says
[1:31:02] jesus christ is sitting at the right
[1:31:03] hand of the father to accept you
[1:31:05] he's sitting there as the high priest of
[1:31:07] your confession to make good before the
[1:31:09] father
[1:31:09] anything that he died for so we have an
[1:31:12] intercessor do you believe that
[1:31:14] amen do you love the lord this evening
[1:31:17] and you know a long time ago i think
[1:31:18] gabe said in here and i had filled up
[1:31:20] two jars of dirt and i put a seed in one
[1:31:22] of them
[1:31:23] and i had gabe come up and pick which
[1:31:25] one the seed was in
[1:31:27] and i don't know if you remember this
[1:31:28] this was years ago and you know what
[1:31:30] gabe couldn't figure out which one the
[1:31:32] seed was in
[1:31:35] shame on him but just like every other
[1:31:37] message person he tried
[1:31:41] i'm going to come home on this one right
[1:31:43] we look at this when we say
[1:31:45] no there's no seed there
[1:31:49] oh this one yeah they they got it
[1:31:52] oh man they can sing play the instrument
[1:31:55] while they sing
[1:31:56] they got it right you know but there's a
[1:31:59] funny thing
[1:32:01] there's only one person that can see
[1:32:03] that seed
[1:32:04] and guess who it's not us
[1:32:08] all right we say well my children have
[1:32:09] been gone for years that doesn't matter
[1:32:12] look at the rich or look at the prodigal
[1:32:14] son how bad he got
[1:32:17] right you look at rahab i'm sure rahab's
[1:32:19] parents weren't like oh yeah
[1:32:21] the god of israel is going to choose
[1:32:23] rahab
[1:32:25] right
[1:32:29] and then you look at your own self well
[1:32:31] and this is where
[1:32:32] it really really comes home to to us as
[1:32:34] believers well god wouldn't choose me
[1:32:37] why not and and one thing i've always
[1:32:40] went back to i've had young people come
[1:32:41] to me when i when i dealt with the youth
[1:32:43] a lot back in the day and
[1:32:44] you know they were like well i i feel
[1:32:45] like you know the enemy's tricking me or
[1:32:48] or or or this is happening or this is
[1:32:50] happening i'm like you know
[1:32:51] do you have a pull in your heart to
[1:32:52] serve god so i can promise you one thing
[1:32:54] satan ain't going to put that there
[1:32:56] the world ain't going to put that there
[1:32:57] human nature ain't going to put that
[1:32:58] there if you've got a
[1:32:59] calling on your life that's a deep
[1:33:01] calling to the deep if you've got
[1:33:02] something going on the inside of you
[1:33:04] where you're crying out like i want more
[1:33:06] i want more of god or i know that maybe
[1:33:07] i
[1:33:08] maybe i haven't been able to live it yet
[1:33:09] but there's something on the inside of
[1:33:11] me that's crying out because i know this
[1:33:12] is the truth that's
[1:33:13] god on the inside calling that seed
[1:33:15] that's not just happenstance that this
[1:33:17] is happening but
[1:33:18] but but that's actually god calling on
[1:33:20] that life and so we see
[1:33:22] that whenever we try to look at
[1:33:23] believers or we try to look at this one
[1:33:24] or that one it doesn't mean if they even
[1:33:26] go astray for a time that doesn't mean
[1:33:27] that that seeds not in there it just
[1:33:28] hasn't been quickened yet is that right
[1:33:30] so as believers we shouldn't shut them
[1:33:32] down whenever they come and go and come
[1:33:33] and go
[1:33:34] one day they're going to get it and
[1:33:35] god's going to get a hold of them and
[1:33:36] they can't leave anymore
[1:33:38] amen we see here we look tonight or we
[1:33:41] look this morning you know they may look
[1:33:42] the same those jars of dirt i had
[1:33:44] identical jars they may look the same
[1:33:46] they may feel the same but on the inside
[1:33:47] is a total different story do you
[1:33:49] believe that
[1:33:50] now ephesians 2 and verse 5 here if we
[1:33:52] could look just for a moment
[1:33:54] ephesians 2 and verse 5 down through 10
[1:33:56] it says even when we were dead in sins
[1:33:58] hath he quickened us together with
[1:34:00] christ by grace
[1:34:01] ye are saved not by works but by grace
[1:34:03] and he hath raised us up together and
[1:34:05] made us to sit together in heavenly
[1:34:07] places
[1:34:08] in christ jesus and so i like that we've
[1:34:10] been raised to sit with christ jesus
[1:34:12] we're not above
[1:34:13] christ we're not below him we're sitting
[1:34:15] with jesus christ and we're not above
[1:34:17] one another or below one another we're
[1:34:19] equally setting with him
[1:34:20] that in ages to come he might show the
[1:34:22] exceeding riches of his grace in his
[1:34:24] kindness toward us through christ jesus
[1:34:27] for by grace you are saved through faith
[1:34:29] and not of yourselves it is the gift of
[1:34:31] god
[1:34:32] not of works lest any man should boast
[1:34:34] for we are his workmanship
[1:34:36] created in christ jesus unto good works
[1:34:38] which god hath before
[1:34:40] ordained that we should walk in them
[1:34:43] so we see that it's not of works it's
[1:34:45] not of this or of that but it's by grace
[1:34:47] we are saved and there's nothing you and
[1:34:48] i can do
[1:34:49] to mess it up jesus already paid the
[1:34:52] price
[1:34:52] all we have to do is trust and believe
[1:34:54] in him is that right
[1:34:56] now brother branham says he says hold
[1:34:58] this carefully in mind now we take the
[1:35:00] next step redeem means to buy back
[1:35:02] to restore to the original owner god
[1:35:05] it said by his death and shed his blood
[1:35:07] brought back his
[1:35:08] own excuse me bought back his own he
[1:35:11] bought back the spoken word seed bride
[1:35:14] he said my sheep hear my voice and word
[1:35:16] they follow me
[1:35:18] you always were a sheep you never were a
[1:35:20] pig or a dog that turned into a sheep
[1:35:22] he said that's impossible for every kind
[1:35:24] of life produces the same kind and there
[1:35:26] is no change
[1:35:27] in species so you look at the prodigal
[1:35:29] son out in the pig pen he wasn't a pig
[1:35:31] in a pig pen he was a sheep in the pig
[1:35:33] pen is that right he was the son
[1:35:35] even when he was out in the world but
[1:35:36] that seed had yet to be quicker
[1:35:38] and he says as we were in the thoughts
[1:35:40] of god and then to be expressed in flesh
[1:35:42] there had to come a day when we would
[1:35:43] hear his voice the word and hearing that
[1:35:45] voice become aware of our father calling
[1:35:48] us
[1:35:48] and recognize that we are the sons of
[1:35:50] god we heard his voice we cried out as
[1:35:52] he did the prodigal son save me o my
[1:35:54] father i am returning
[1:35:56] to thee do you believe that this morning
[1:36:02] you know it amazes me you know the the
[1:36:04] rich young ruler
[1:36:06] you know he went away sad but you know
[1:36:08] jesus even knowing what he knew
[1:36:10] wanted him to be saved wanted him to
[1:36:11] accept he wanted him to sell all he had
[1:36:13] and give to the poor he
[1:36:14] he wanted him to come and he still went
[1:36:17] away
[1:36:18] now as believers that ought to show us
[1:36:20] whenever we're trying to maybe lead
[1:36:21] somebody even if they go away we do not
[1:36:23] hate them when they go away we still
[1:36:25] love them and still try to be an example
[1:36:26] in this day
[1:36:28] titus chapter three and verse three and
[1:36:29] then i'll just have one more scripture
[1:36:31] and then a quote and we'll go ahead and
[1:36:32] widen this down and
[1:36:35] for we ourselves also are sometimes
[1:36:37] foolish disobedient deceived serving
[1:36:39] diverse lusts and pleasures living in
[1:36:40] malice and envy hateful or hating one
[1:36:42] another
[1:36:43] but after the kindness and love of god
[1:36:45] our savior toward men appeared
[1:36:47] not by works of righteousness which we
[1:36:50] have done but according to his mercy he
[1:36:52] saved us by the washing and regeneration
[1:36:55] and renewing of the holy ghost
[1:36:57] which he shed on us abundantly through
[1:37:00] christ
[1:37:00] jesus our savior so once we were
[1:37:03] regenerated we no longer wanted wanted
[1:37:05] to hate
[1:37:06] one another or do this to one another or
[1:37:08] be hateful or have environmentalists
[1:37:09] right
[1:37:10] and so we see that when christ comes on
[1:37:11] the scene everything changes
[1:37:14] john 16 33 these things have i spoken
[1:37:16] unto you that you might have
[1:37:17] peace in the world you shall have
[1:37:19] tribulation but be of good cheer i have
[1:37:21] overcome the world
[1:37:23] so we see that no matter what we're
[1:37:24] going through no matter what we face
[1:37:26] jesus has already overcome the world so
[1:37:28] anything that we face in the world he's
[1:37:29] already overcome and as
[1:37:30] that same spirit dwells in you and i we
[1:37:33] will do the same thing he did and
[1:37:34] overcome the world
[1:37:36] now this is just where i kind of
[1:37:37] gathered my thought from this morning
[1:37:39] because christ has to mean more and
[1:37:41] i begin to think about that and and
[1:37:43] christ has to mean more and
[1:37:45] and to me in this day you know what is
[1:37:46] more we're in a consumer age where
[1:37:48] where we just want more we just want to
[1:37:50] consume and consume and consume but
[1:37:52] but brother brahm says in a hidden life
[1:37:54] in 55 he says have you ever come to the
[1:37:56] place
[1:37:56] in life where christ meant more to you
[1:38:00] than all the arguing arguing you could
[1:38:02] ever do about your church
[1:38:03] all right you know there's a lot of
[1:38:05] things we can say
[1:38:08] that really don't need to be said right
[1:38:12] i i if anybody in here you're married
[1:38:14] there's a lot of things husbands
[1:38:16] can say that don't need to be said that
[1:38:18] they could go without right
[1:38:19] we got to throw in that last little
[1:38:21] throwing that last little thing or
[1:38:23] or vice versa but we've got to come to a
[1:38:26] point where christ means more than
[1:38:28] than how the pastor preaches or how the
[1:38:31] pews are or how the bathrooms are or how
[1:38:33] the parking lot is or how
[1:38:35] how this one sings or how this one does
[1:38:37] christ has got to come more
[1:38:39] than all of those things he said has
[1:38:41] christ ever meant to more to you than
[1:38:43] all the world
[1:38:44] it's got to come more than our social
[1:38:46] status more than how maybe the
[1:38:47] the minister goes out to eat with this
[1:38:49] one or the the fellowship hall groups
[1:38:51] have this one or this one has this one
[1:38:53] and
[1:38:53] christ has got to mean more to where
[1:38:54] none of that stuff matters
[1:38:56] he says yeah i don't mean an emotional
[1:38:58] mental workup i mean the depths of your
[1:39:00] heart that something's settled in there
[1:39:02] that something's taken place that you
[1:39:03] don't know how it
[1:39:04] how it come but you're hit away your
[1:39:07] whole
[1:39:07] whole motive is to serve jesus christ
[1:39:10] and i love that he says you don't know
[1:39:11] how it
[1:39:12] come but one day you just wake up and
[1:39:13] you're like man none of this
[1:39:16] stuff matters anymore but this matters
[1:39:18] and once you get the holy ghost that's
[1:39:20] the way it's going to be you wake up one
[1:39:21] day and then you
[1:39:22] you just all of a sudden you're like man
[1:39:24] you know what i used to worry about
[1:39:25] don't worry
[1:39:26] me anymore this is what matters have you
[1:39:28] come to the place where you don't care
[1:39:29] what anyone says
[1:39:32] man we got to get there this is not not
[1:39:36] not to go out and act smart but till the
[1:39:38] love of god is so anchored into you you
[1:39:39] can't see nothing else your whole motive
[1:39:42] is to do the will of god love for
[1:39:44] everybody flowing free from every
[1:39:46] everywhere he says what a place to live
[1:39:48] that's the hidden place that's the place
[1:39:50] we've got to come to my brethren that's
[1:39:52] the place where god reveals
[1:39:54] his secret things that's the place where
[1:39:56] god does the placing and calling he says
[1:39:59] do you get
[1:40:00] what i mean and i want to just end it
[1:40:02] tonight christ has got to mean more than
[1:40:04] whatever you're dealing with this
[1:40:05] morning
[1:40:06] whatever you're going through whatever
[1:40:07] situation you've been given christ has
[1:40:09] got to mean more
[1:40:10] than all of that it doesn't matter if
[1:40:12] it's sin it doesn't matter if
[1:40:14] it's just if it's just just just sitting
[1:40:16] there and just going through the motions
[1:40:18] christ has got to mean more than
[1:40:19] anything you're going through if you
[1:40:21] want to make it do you believe that this
[1:40:23] morning
[1:40:24] even if we could have the musicians come
[1:40:25] at this time and
[1:40:27] you look at gideon and how he he come
[1:40:29] and christ
[1:40:30] or you see that the angel lord what what
[1:40:32] god was doing it had to mean more to him
[1:40:35] than remaining at the altar of bell then
[1:40:37] hiding out behind the wine press
[1:40:39] press threshing the wheat it had to mean
[1:40:41] more than his father's name in the town
[1:40:43] or had to be more than he was the least
[1:40:45] of these or his family was the poorest
[1:40:47] and when it finally meant more he was
[1:40:49] able to go and follow the lord
[1:40:51] to conquer the enemy do you believe that
[1:40:53] amen do you love the lord this morning
[1:40:55] i mean maybe if they'll just play
[1:40:57] something softly as we just bow our
[1:40:58] heads
[1:40:59] as we just go to the lord in prayer
[1:41:05] dear lord we just come before you this
