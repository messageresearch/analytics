a day like today and people are traveling and things when you're missing people you you're mindful of the fact that we do need one another another and if you're watching today if you're gone and you're watching happen to be watching live we sure appreciate you when you're here Luke Chapter 2 and verse 8 and there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field keeping watch over their flock by night and oh the angel of the Lord Came Upon them and the glory of the Lord Shone round about them and they were sore afraid and the angel said unto them fear not for behold I bring you good Good Tidings of great joy which shall be to all people for unto you is Born This Day in the city of David a savior which is Christ the lord and this shall be a sign unto you you shall find the Babe wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in a manger and suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the Heavenly Host praising God and saying glory to God in the highest and on Earth peace peace Good Will toward men pray the Lord would add his Blessing to the word you may be seated I want to speak to you this morning on Christmas tinsel Christmas tinsil tinsil is a thread a strip or a sheet of metal paper or plastic used to produce a glittering and sparkling appearance in decoration it is also a metaphor for something superficially attractive or glamorous but of little real worth we uh tinsel if you've never seen tinsel uh that's what Christmas trees used to look like hope I don't get in trouble for showing a picture of a Christmas tree in the church but uh that that is what Christmas trees look like back in the day or or some of them did some of yall may have used that I don't know if you knew this but tinel the reason they did away with tinsil they haven't done away with it it's still available but they changed what was made out of it was made out of lead and so little kids would take it and and eat it I guess not not anybody in my family but people in some families do those kind of things but uh they they ate the lead and and and caused some problems and so that's why uh they don't make it out of lead anymore so it's actually very beautiful and very dangerous and poisonous so and and yet we survived somehow didn't we in the generation My Generation the ones before us drinking out the garden hose and things like that but tinsel is associated with Christmas It's associated with this time of year you there's a flashiness to it a brightness to it a uh there's a there's an attraction to it and And yet when Christ was born there was nothing flashy about it there was nothing no tinsel you could say to it it it probably wasn't a silent night when very few bursts are pilot the The Peasant cave that they were in was used as a barn would have been cold on an early spring night it would have smelled like animals it it wouldn't have been pretty it it would have been very would been the lowest type of a home or or dwelling or a stable or cave to to be born in they were there to pay their taxes which probably felt much more like April 15th than December 25th right and and and you know April 15th there's not much of tinsel about taex day that's what they were there for so there weren't any lights there weren't any trees there weren't any other than just natural trees there weren't any uh there there wasn't any glamour about it and yet the Angels told the Shepherds to Rejoice with exceeding great joy and and and to give him praise and and we find that they did that so it was a great moment the greatest moment up to that time that had ever been in history only superseded by his death on the cross and then his resurrection but to that time the greatest moment when God was born in flesh when God condescended into our world and came out of his light into our Darkness aren't you glad that he did that that's what Christmas is really about it wasn't December 25th but we know was probably born in the spring but it wasn't very glamorous it wasn't very great in Isaiah chapter 7 when the prophet Isaiah was talking about Chris or about the birth of Christ and how it would come the prophecy that was coming he was having a difficult time getting the Jews to believe his message because the times were tough and and it says that it came to pass in the days of ahaz that these two other kings came came to war against Jerusalem could not Prevail against it and and a rumor started during that time it was told the House of David saying Syria is Confederate with Ephraim and so they said oh the ephraimites and the syrians are going to come in and come together and then they'll be able to overcome us and it says and his heart was moved and the Heart of his people as the Trees of the wood are moved with the wind and you'll find over the next few verses that that Isaiah went to ahaz the king with the Lord's message that the king shouldn't Fear The Alliance of Israel and Ephram or the plan to depose Aha ahaz and replace him with the king of their choice but God said uh about that he said it won't happen in verse seven he said it shall not stand neither shall it come to pass so he said I know they've devise this but it won't happen and he says in five in three score and five years and 65 years Ephraim will be broken it won't be a people the head of Ephraim is Samar Ephraim was a tribe in Israel it was the Israelites against the judeans and he said the head of Samaria is Ralia son if you will not believe surely you shall not be established so in other words he's saying I need you to believe me and Isaiah knew they didn't believe and in verse 10 it says moreover the Lord spake again to ahaz saying ask a sign so God's trying to get him to believe the prophet's trying to get him to believe and he said ask a sign ask for me for a sign isn't it amazing that even they they they were so steeped and unbelief that they wouldn't even ask for something to prove that they that it was true that the word was true and so he said ask a sign and ask of the Lord thy God ask it either in the depth or in the height above but ahaz said I will not ask neither will I tempt the Lord and really what it was was a lack of faith in ahaz to believe he had such little faith that he wouldn't do what the Jews would normally do and ask for a sign remember Paul says that the Jews seek signs but he had so little faith he wouldn't even ask for a sign and Isaiah cries out he said hear you now House of David is it a small thing for you to weary men but will you weary My God also verse 14 therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign amen now out of this very ordinary event was happening in and and is or judeans or Israelites being full Jews being full of unbelief was not a an abnormal thing it was a very normal thing that they would disbelieve God but out of this suddenly Isaiah drops into another channel of inspiration and he said the Lord himself will give you a sign Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Emanuel he said you won't believe anything the prophet say so the word is going to come in going to become flesh the word oh I love how that works the word breaks the silence at Christmas time the word breaking the Silence of of the prophets that had had they had ceased to prophesy and the word broke that silence now we know that he is not just a sign he's the super sign how many know that today brother the brand preach that to us he is the super sign and yet he would not come in a flashy way in a way of tinsel in Isaiah 53:1 it says who hath believed our report to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed you can see how that goes with with Isaiah chapter 7 who's believed us for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant as a root out of dry ground prophesying of the Virgin birth Heath no form nor comeliness and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him there's no tinsil on the Virgin birth there was no beauty that people would attract people to that other than the word itself let me tell you church that's the same thing today the bride has to be attracted by the word because the tinsil is not enough to keep you the shininess isn't enough to keep you and many times the shininess in the ttin Christmas actually obscures the message of Christmas which is God came into our world Amen and yet the tinsil that's on the world today and the commercial ization of it it it it actually takes away from what we're trying to get across to the people but I want you children to understand and all of us to understand God came into our world that's why we still honor Christmas not a even a certain day but the fact that God came into our world but has nothing to do with Santa Claus has nothing to do with elves it has nothing to do with trees what it has to do with is God deity becoming wrapping himself in flesh and coming down into my world because without that happening I could never be saved I could never be right it had to take place he was God's wrapped gift but maybe if you'd been wrapped in tinsil instead of swaddling clothes perhaps they would have received him and yet even when he comes in a way that we could perceive would be get our attention many times people take the tenil and take the wrapping paper and throw away the gift in Isaiah 29:14 he he tells us that this was done on purpose he said therefore behold I'll proceed to do a marvelous work among this people even a marvelous work and a Wonder now watch what the Wonder would be for the wisdom of their wise men Shall Perish and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid Jesus talks about that in Luke 10:21 in that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit and said I thank thee oh Father Lord of Heaven and Earth thou has hid these things from the eyes of the wise and The Prudent and has revealed them unto babes even so father for so it seemed good in thy sight so it was God's purpose that the common people would hear him gladly it was his purpose that he would come at Christmas time and come in a way be wrapped in a way that the people couldn't receive it it was his purpose that there wouldn't be tinel on it but that it would be in a way that only those who were looking for him would see it Christmas today has lots of tensil people go in debt to buy things for people they don't even like right you say well nobody goes and gets a loan at Christmas time well probably some people do but they use credit cards right I'm not criticizing you if you use credit cards to buy Christmas gifts but make sure it's somebody you like at least right it's probably not a good idea to to borrow money to buy things that are going to get broken the first day to impress people they don't even know yet Christmases could be such a special time we we take the word Christmas brother B said it's very seldom you ever hear Christ's name mentioned you don't hear it mentioned the lights and tinsels all in Santa Claus not on Christ till people hardly know what Christmas is really for he talks about the commercialization of it he said now if they want to make a commercial day like Mother's Day or Father's Day or Son's Day or daughter's day that's all right but keep that commercial off of Christmas he said I've seen a sign not long ago said put Christ back in Christmas now people will tell you brother Brown didn't believe in Christmas and it's a it it's brother BR talks very harshly about Christmas in some places brother brandham always celebrated Christmas with his family and how are those two things how do you put those two things together well what he was upset about was the commercialization of it what people had made it he said they bring you to a Christmas what do you do he said they bring you to a church and you learn a Creed they bring you to a Christmas what do you do you see a Santa Claus they bring you to a church you see an organization but Christ brought them to the cross I loved our Sunday School play when the kids saying it's about the cross right that's what it's all about it's about the cross Christ brought them to the cross and when you get a real disciple that will point you to Christ Christ will bring you to the Cross where you are crucified with him look where Christmas leads you to church when you really get it right Christmas doesn't lift you up Christmas is not for a momentary gation or or feeling good but Christmas is about humbling yourself because Christmas was God coming down and becoming the lowest of the low so he can save you and I that was God be humbling himself to our world that's what Christmas is about and his eternal life he said and your life meet together and your life dies and you take on his eternal life or aren't you glad for that kind of a Christmas he said then you're a Son of God See We Don't Preach just Christ in a Manger although he was there but we preach Christ crucified the Bible says after that in the wisdom of God the World by wisdom knew not God it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe that's still how God Saves people is by the preaching of the word I don't care how out of fashion it is or whatever it becomes we still need to hear the preaching of the word amen the by the preaching of the word he chose to save those that believe for the Jews require a sign and the Greeks seek after wisdom remember that's what they were looking for we want a sign and then they had so much unbelief they wouldn't even look for a sign anymore he said but the Jews require sign the Greeks seek after wisdom but we preach Christ crucified unto the Jews a stumbling block unto the Greeks foolishness but unto them that's you and I this morning unto them which are called both Jews and Greeks Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God we preach Christ crucified when the world wants to just make a Christmas show we want to see who is really laying there it was the word vilified laughed at made fun of made a laughing stock in the world seen by very few people understood by even fewer and yet Shepherds heralded his birth and Angels heralded his birth Christmas time was a time of humility was a time when God came down to man B you know at Christmas I think we all too many of us I wouldn't say all but too many of us lose the real value of what Christmas is he said as I noticed out here even the palm trees are decorated in the East it's always the fur tree or the Evergreen he said in months or weeks maybe a month or six weeks before Christmas ever begins it's always the tinsil and they made it a commercial instead of what it really means he talks about how Jesus was not born on December the 25th he said but remember whatever day it might be we still doesn't take away the sacredness of what it's supposed to be where Satan has robbed us of this right he wasn't trying to do away with Christmas but he was saying Satan has robbed us of this has made a great commercial and Santa Claus stole all the worship right it's become a day like Easter and now now Christmas and Easter are very similar in that you don't realize the word Easter people say we shouldn't say Merry Christmas because Christmas is a pagan word so it's Easter Easter is a pagan word but we're not talking about the word Easter we're not talking about bunny rabbits and a and a spring fertility or anything like that what we're talking about is the day that Jesus rose from the dead what we're talking about at Christmas or we know when he rose from the dead we don't know exactly when he was born but we know he was born sometime in the spring because he was a lamb and it would had to been for the Shepherds to be watching their fields their their their flocks at night he was a lamb that was born during the Spring but we don't know exactly what day but I'm willing to take during this time of darkness and shine a light that says he was born and it did matter and he's still the same yesterday today and forever and if you need need to meet him you can meet him today by humbling yourself at Christmas time he said Easter like bunny rabbits and pink ducks and what's that got to do with Easter what's that got to do with the resurrection of Christ it's just like the world today the kids on the street can more about daav Crockett than they could about Jesus Christ now I don't know how many of our kids could tell you about Davey Crockett but maybe we could take that an updated to Iron Man or somebody like that he said they can tell you more about some Outlaw some criminal of days gone by and they came the Prince of Life was born 1900 years ago he said but that doesn't take the real thing away from we Christians you see always light shines its best in the darkness you said brother Ben we should just celebrate Christmas I know people in the message and I'm not being critical of them it's just the way people think sometimes they well we'll give gifts on Thanksgiving so we won't have to celebrate Christmas that's not what brother brandom taught us he said the light shines its best in the Darkness right at the time of year when everybody else is celebrating whatever it is that they're celebrating Santa Claus or whatever but we celebrate a risen savior during this time we celebrate God who came into the world light shines its best in the darkness the forked lightning in the black cloudy skies at night shows there can be light in darkness if the Sun's shining you don't need the lights too much but darker the smaller the light the greater it will shine in the darkness listen what he says the whole world's got tinsel they've got tinsel there's a lot of shininess to the world today a lot to attract the attention but many times there's death in it the whole world's got tinsel but we've got Christ and that's what we ought to be letting shine in this dark hour that we're now living in how many can say Amen to that today Hallelujah we don't need tinsel on the church we he Christ yes what we try to do is twist it up and make it some great something up there put flour and tinsil on it we pollute it just like the Nations has done Christmas if we could get the tinsil off of the things and the humility back in the human heart if we could bring the humility back to Christmas of what it ought to be not a commercial day not lights and Santa Clauses but back to worshiping the god of creation who come in a stable and was born to baby God made flesh and dwelt among us if we could come back to that get away from the tinsil and the big things God don't even deal with it at all listen Church how many times we try to make Christmas a production and it makes it where people especially people have to pay for it hate Christmas because it becomes just a time when you got to give a bunch of stuff and and you're required if this one gives you a gift to give them one back and we should never get into that church do what you can for people out of the goodness of your heart don't do it just as a church many times we want to do more but we do what we can for people during this time of year but we we would like to do more but we do what we can we're not going to go in debt for it we just do what we can in your family sometimes the simpler things are better because Christ came in a humble way come on now sometimes seven Stakes are enough some of you know what I'm talking about [Laughter] now see God don't even deal with it at all you say well I belong to the biggest organization he said that takes you that much farther away from God you say I do this and that that just takes you that much farther you've got to humble yourself until you see until if you abide in me and my words abide in you then ask what you will so what we try to do as soon as God gives us a little shower of blessings we try to twist it all up and get dignitaries in there it's going to make great big names and outdo the other one this one starts this way and that way and God leaves the whole thing listen when we start being blessed we don't need to make an organization out of it I've seen churches do that they'll fellowship and they'll be free with people but as soon as the church starts building up then they they quit fellowshipping they quit they become critical of others we don't want to ever get that way no matter how many sit among us we need to get to we need to treat each other right we need to keep fellowshipping and keep reaching out and because that's what got us where we are is doing that having that kind of openness we need to keep that humility about us not build an organization the church isn't about me it's not about the deacons it's not about even any of us it's about him right he said what we need today oh what what do we need today it's a fresh pouring out of the Holy Spirit upon Hearts that's humble we need a real Christmas a birth place he said if you could realize you're nothing but a stable I've used this quote before but it's just so it's so pertinent in this place he said God didn't go to Jerusalem to shalow or ramoth Gilead he come to a stable that was polluted when you let God he said you become and realize in yourself you're nothing but a stinking stable right but welcome Hallelujah there's no room for him in the denomination anymore there's no room for him in the Santa Claus experience there's no room for him in bran no room for him in Gatlinburg no room for him in New York City but let in Hardy Arkansas May there be room for him in our hearts welcome open your doors when these great big places and ends are turning him away open your doors of the manger of your heart let Jehovah come into that watch what takes place for he is the word and he said if you abide in me and my word in you he is the word let him come into you and watch what takes place then ask what you will and it'll be done for you he humbled himself look in Luke 22 and: 42 look what he did he said father if thou be willing remove the cup for me nevertheless not my will but thine be done what does that have to do with Christmas it has everything to do with Christmas this is what he came for because Philippians 2:5 tells us let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation took upon him the form of a servant was made in the likeness of men oh my being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself became obedient unto death even the death of the Cross wherefore God also hath highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name at the name of Jesus every knee should bow things in heaven and things and Earth things under the Earth that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the father Jesus was the fullness of God's word he was the fullness of the godhead bodily and in him dwelt the fullness of God God lived in Jesus Christ God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself not Jew nor Gentile but God can we understand that today there he stood making himself he said how fitting God's own blood had to shed upon the ground from the innocent blood of Abel on down to redeem us he didn't take his own life he didn't hold his own life he said father is it possible this cup should pass from me but nevertheless not my will thine be done he give in to the word so brother Ben how should we act on Christmas time we should give in to the word how should we act every other day of the year we should give in to the word today we can do the same thing you can either take your Creeds take your sew and so and go wherever you want with it but you can say not my will but thine be done come back to that word of God take your tinsil and Christmas and do what you want with want it to he said do with it what you want to but give me Jesus Christ in my heart no matter how humble it is and how people laugh at at it or what of it watch its nature he said see if it does just like he did if it didn't it don't compare with this word leave it alone it's not Christ because Christ is the word then you can have your tinsil but Give Me Jesus Christ in my heart again he said oh brother sister how nice it would be if each one of you if each one of us me if each one of us could lay aside all this here Christmas tinsil he said quit all this swapping gifts and again I've explained that to you it's where you you get something you get something you expect something and we shouldn't be like that at Christmas if we don't get nothing we ought to be looking and see what we can get and all the rest of the year too one with another he said all the nonsense of the world just take off our pride oh come on church that's what we need to lay down at Christmas time lay down our pride lay it down and stomp the thing under foot and say Lord Jesus guide me to that Perfect Light watch something Supernatural happened you want to see the supernatural I think all of us could say Brother Bruce we want to see the supernatural so thankful for the testimony had what God's done in your life but we want to see the supernatural more and more we want to see healing we want to see the salvation of our young people we want to see God begin to move in a mighty way do we want the supernatural here's how a prophet said to happen to see it happen watch something Supernatural happen the holy spirit will come in a phenomenal way when when you humble yourself when you take off your pride and stomp it underfoot we think we're too big to fellowship with somebody or to come to the you know fellowship with at a church function because we got more money everybody else does we have to take out off and stomp it h think you're too big to to to to to go around and say well these other people man that you know they just act foolish in church and I'm just you know I always act good and I sit proper come on church we would have thought that the Bine bmus was foolish when he was screaming out and the disciples said stay still don't scream out anymore when he said Jesus th son of David have mercy on me we ought to take that Pride off and stomp it underfoot [Laughter] and you see Jesus answering and healing blind bame's eyes you'll see the the Holy Ghost come in a phenomenal way if we can over get our pride out of the way if you'd come to us today I wonder how he would come wonder how he did come today churches have drummer boys lowered from ceilings I know we all see the the videos and things and fake snow falling and rock and roll conerts and lights but the tensil surrounds it has death in it cuz it's not attracting you to the word right it's it's not it's attracting you to a Creed or to a denomination there's no humility in it but God has an attraction yes right and there's no Death In His attraction and yet we want to see what he's attracting us too God uses he uses gifts and miracles to attract folks atten attention to the word right that's what it's for he heals us he G we have good Services we feel the presence what's he trying to do to attract our attention to the word and brother bandam talks about his his early meetings and it's interesting the word he uses because if you type tinsel into the message you'd think that you'd find uh you'd find brother Bram condemning Christmas time tinsel around Christmas time but that's actually not what he uses it most of the time on he actually uses it about his own Ministry he talks about early on in his ministry he says when I first started in the great campaigns the meetings had a lot of tinsil then the meetings had a lot of tensil again this is not something that would kill you it's not something that's wrong but it had tensil to attract the people right an attraction he said again he said we think of Jesus Christ when he was here on Earth his first years of his ministry oh the tinsil was hanging everywhere he said the second year of his ministry they begin to accuse him and call him beab and so forth can you imagine you talk about moving fast the first year they all voted him in right they all loved him he's the prophet the second year he was be elub right the third year they killed him the same ones even look how changeable they were many of the same people that laid Palms down in palm branches down his way and cried hosana to the King was the same ones who cried crucify him the next few days look brother Brandon talks about that tinsel that was on his meetings he talks about staying at the Sam peek Hotel in Little Rock I think I I think the if you go look in the database it says sand dust or something like that but it's actually they they just didn't get it right he was staying at the Sam peek Hotel you can hear that on tape and and you can find that hotel where he was staying find pictures of it on the internet and he talked about how even the porters at the hotel were singing Only belief that's the meetings in Little Rock I'll think about that for a minute it it was just even in his own hotel he was staying in the porter saying only belie if you go to Africa today there's a can we say there's a lot of tinsel on the message in Africa even though it's a poor place but you go to Africa and you're liable to meet a message believer just about anywhere I've met him in airports and and you go in and they all belong to different churches but there just the churches are large and there's a lot of there's a lot of Revival and things going on it's that way the Philippines hundreds and hundreds of Believers thousands of Believers it's that way in Africa it's that way in South America right now in Brazil and different parts of the world but there's a lot going on because brother Brenham taught us that America was burn over right we' had our visitation turned it down but now we have a respon responsibility to get the word out to others and we've done that as message people to a great extent though there's still some parts of the world that need that but we've done that we've gotten it out and you can see the people respond to it brother Brown talked about his own Ministry he said there was no one else on the field at that day and the tensil was hanging everywhere and we was having a marvelous time he talked about the great Portland meetings very early in his ministry he said where thousands of people were gathered the streets were standing full and 60 some odd 100 on the inside he said and it pouring down rain the people standing there he said their hearts were longing hungry he said that's when no one else was on the field tinsel was on the meeting he said and they'd have to pull you through crowds and everything else with police escorts to get you in can you imagine if this church was like that and it's not but can you imagine if the if they had to actually es the police had to escort me in and out because of the people that were coming that's the way it was but it wasn't a building like this it was an arena filled with thousands of people we've talked about the great meetings in Jonesboro and other places he said a few years ago I came into Canada he said and had a meeting the tinsel was all on the meetings and people gathered to places where the newspapers had reported people driving as many as 3,000 miles by taxi cab you talk about a bill brother Bill used to be a taxi driver you imagine how much that would cost cost to take somebody 3,000 miles by taxi and he said but they came just to be in the presence of the outpouring of the spirit and yet brother Bram goes back in 1957 and says this tonight after much advertisement and trying to cooperate with everybody and showing the same spirit that we did when we first come yet it's hard to get a little group of people to fill a small Arena like this he said then you could wonder why is it that ministers hearts are alarmed right our hearts get alarmed even at Christmas time why because you see that that the T soul is not on the message right are you with especially here in the US it's not on the message but can you see beyond that can you see when he's wrapped in humility can you see him as he is he said all the ministers today having such a time with get their people out to prayer meeting on Wednesday night he said they love television programs they love Amusement Sunday they don't want to come to church on Sunday many of them they tell me the ministers that the church pews are emptying out I'm not preaching at you folks that are sick today or gone I I know sometimes always the wrong people hear the message but I'm trying to get a point here about the tinsel that went off of that age right the tinsel the churches he said the pews are emptying out because people are beginning to go the world offers so much class and so much fancy and ensil upon the things of the world and the people fall for that he said now that shows that at the beginning they had nothing to start with if you love God you couldn't wire you away from church they couldn't chain you away from it they can't hide a Believer from God but the the modern church has music and show and I'm not being critical church I'm trying not to be but we don't want that we we don't have that for we have music and wonderful music but we don't want to make it a show why do we not make it a show because we want to focus to be on the word not on what I'm saying but regardless of who stands behind the sacred desk the focus ought to be on the word because the word is Christ and Christ can make a difference in your life Christ can change you Christ can heal you instead of declarations today the preacher makes suggestions right and apologizes for the suggestion but Peter said to preach like it was the Oracles of God right they took the paper the pcil left the present laying there brother brandham calls and he was talking about in in the literal sense but he says Pharisee the foolish that's why word he used Pharisee the foolish he said he said got Christ there because he would attract the crowd remember when he invited him Jesus goes where he's invited but he said the foolish left the left the gift sitting there with washed feet and took the wrapper and the tinsil everyone wants healing and blessings but that's just the paper he's wrapped in now that's a good thing but he's just he's wrapped in that we but we want him we want to Humble ourselves to his will look brother said they want the paper sure something that's all tin so a lot of fuss they can do about it but the real gift that's on the inside of it they don't want it by the time you hung on a cross the ensil was gone from the meetings right when all the crowds would follow him around now that they they cried out crucify him they only followed him to see how he would fail where before they followed him to see a miracle and something happened with expectation now they followed him to see how he would die to watch him be killed under Roman judgment they cried out crucify him once the tsil was off there was no Beauty to make them want him don't you see why it had to be Shepherds even at his birth because others wouldn't have seen the beauty of it but Shepherds knew how to take care of lambs but the B said he they knew how to take care of lambs and he was the Lamb of God born to die for our sins I want to tell you today I believe I believe he's here today he's here in the form of the word one day we'll see him in body form but today he's here in form of the word but this message is more than tinsel and glamour it's more than healing meetings it's more than big preachers and big churches building kingdoms it's more than that the message is still Christ it always will be Christ it always will be one who come into our world and we always will worship him listen to me as long as I got any influence at all in this church I want to worship Christ I don't want it to be about a preacher I don't want it to be about something else going on I want it to be because he's here and I don't care if there's 5 here 25 we ought to be able to shout in his presence we ought to be able to rejoice in his presence we ought to be able to reach out to him and our needs be met let the tensil come off of it but if he's hanging there if though the word be crucified let me see him and say my Lord and my God Hallelujah the message is still Christ Matthew 11:28 he said come unto me all ye that labor oh church I'm not going to preach long this morning I'll leave that to brother Joel this afternoon but I want you to understand Christmas is not about the tensil and I want you to understand even deeper this message the birth of the word in our hour it's not about the tinel but it's about the presence of Jesus Christ himself the literal Life of Christ coming back on the believer he said come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest take my yoke upon you learn of me for I am meek and lowly in heart you shall find rest your souls can you see him calling you to come through the tensil can you see the word made flesh can you see him the way he comes to you B told the story about the man who decided one year he wasn't going to put up a tree he wasn't going to do any of that he said Lord this year for Christmas I want I want you to come he said I want you to come and have dinner with me and he felt like the Lord promised him that he would he come under such expectation that he prepared a dinner for the Lord and he laid out the table and he made everything just right and he set out a plate for him and for the Lord and he set out one for he said just in case the disciples dropped by so he had his table spread and he waited and he waited and no nobody came came and he said Lord where are you and pretty soon a knock come on the door and it was a a beggar just a man with nothing he said sir he said I'm cold I don't got nothing to wear nothing to eat do you have anything you can help me with and and he said oh sure he said I'm expecting a guest he said but you can come in come eat with me while we wait on our guest so he gave him his food and there's different ways that they tell the story but was uh another person come an old woman that come by and she was fed and a little a little child that was fed as well and and they all stopped by and still he waited on Jesus to come still waiting on him to honor him and said Lord you promis you would come he began to cry be to call Lord you promised and the Lord spoke to him and said I was there didn't you see me in the beggar amen see he didn't come right in a way that he would expect him to come at Christmas time but he come wrapped in flesh church can you see Pastor tinsel and see Christ in the hearts of the people can you see him in our young people can you see him in your brothers and sisters can you see him in in the people in your family can you see Christ oh church that's where he's hiding himself today that's where he's failed today brother brandom said St Martin before he was known as St Martin he wasn't he was a Christian but he didn't wasn't a preacher and he one day he was he was a military man one day he uh he was standing there on guard and he sees an old beggar shivering and people passing by no one will give him anything to to cover himself and in the cold he might die so Martin had his heavy coat on was issued to him by the Roman army he comes and takes that coat or the army that he was in takes that coat and he his his cloak and he just takes his sword and he cuts it in two and he wraps the little beggar in that coat and that night he he goes to the messall and he sits there and takes his his his armor off and things and he's sitting there eating and all of a sudden Christ appeared to him and when he appeared to him he wasn't wearing purple robes he wasn't wearing a white robe he wasn't wearing garments of heaven but he was actually wearing the half of a robe that Martin gave to the beggar and brother Brown uses that to illustrate the fact God don't show up like we expect him to come on Church how many times do we come to the house of God and we want God to show up on our schedule and in the way we want him to come but I say we need to stop that today it's time we learn that he comes on his own schedule and he comes in his own Veil and sometimes he's a Sunday school student and sometimes he's a preacher and sometimes he said he comes in our midst sometimes he's a stranger visits us and we got to learn to see him see him at Christmas time see beyond the tinsil see beyond the struggle Beyond well I don't want to go there do that because that would be difficult can you see the word made flesh can you defend it brother brandom illustrates that he uses that St Martin's coat and then types it to his own Ministry he said what can I do in these matters then so he's talking about the word he he's preached a message called the falling apart of the world and he calls it at one place he calls it the world is again falling apart because he was told about how on Christmas time was a Christmas message brother R almost always preached a Christmas message sometimes several but he preached the falling apart of the world and when he preached that he said that at Christmas time the world was falling apart the Roman world and Christ come into that time and he typed that to the own he come in unrecognized he T that to the age that we're living in and he said what can I do in these matters then what must I do with these things that I know that's right these things has been confirmed and proved they're right what can I do what do you see he saw people begging for life looking for something what did he do he took what he'd been given are you with me now he said wrap the church he's talking about Martin's coat he said wrap the church not in a a Creed or denomination but in the blood of Jesus Christ by his word you realize what this meant Oh that ought to make a shout and this message is to us it's a wrapping of the blood of Jesus Christ by his word there had to be somebody there God uses men God used the prophet to wrap Us in the blood we're Washed by the Water of the word that's the way he loves us that's how he shows his love to us he said husbands love your wives as Christ loved the church who gave himself for it and wash it by the water of the word oh church he said what can I do wrap the church not a DEC Creed or denomination but in the blood of Jesus Christ by his word so Jesus said what you've done to these you've done to me what's our main goal church I know we want to feed the hungry want to do all of that but our main goal is to wrap the people in the blood of Jesus Christ by his word to make you so protected by the word where the world can fall apart and you'll still be okay Hallelujah recognize that Christ was in the people and his faithfulness to the word mattered ours matters today I wonder if we can see beyond the Christmas tinsil musicians go ahead and come I wasn't lying can you see beyond the Christmas tcil can the word be born in the manger of your heart and you see him visit I know everybody wants to condemn Christmas but Christmas sometimes isn't the problem it's our pride it's our pride right and I say if you got a problem with falling down worshiping trees you should get rid of your tree if you worship Santa Claus and I don't think we should teach our kids a story that's not true because what what do they say when we tell them about Jesus that story is true tell them the truth tell him the truth about Christmas but he came why don't we just why can't we just set aside our pride you know and and I'm just preaching to you from my heart and talking to you from my heart but as message people we took so much pride in being different and we separated ourselves said well we don't do Christmas like everybody else when it was the pride that was the problem sir all along what kept us from seeing Christ was the problem all along they put they put an attraction on it and pointed the people to a dog man and Creed but if there is any attraction today let it be the sweetness of a life of a life that's lived according to the word by the message of the hour let it be an attraction to the world that we live in and he said these signs will follow them that believe let let that be an attraction not the main thing but an attraction to the world that we live in that we can know he's alive he's the same yesterday today and forever he he was here as a baby but he's not a baby no more now he's in the manger of our heart he lives in you and I can we see him that way church can we recognize his presence worship him when he comes not be like the Pharisee that that that that took the wrapping and the Glamour and threw away the present but may we accept him and say Lord I want to wash your feet I want to worship you at Christmas time brother said we ought it ought to be a time of worship not just a celebration but a time of worship at Christmas time I pray we'd make it that with all of my heart let's pray together Heavenly Father we love you today and we thank you for this time of year because it's so dark lord we can see you shining through a light shining in the darkness as he as the Shepherds were keeping the watch of the Sheep by night it was Night Time Lord that you showed them where the baby was laying in the manger Lord during the night May you direct us may the spirit of the word direct us to the word Angel Angelic presence and signs and Gifts all these things may it direct us not to the tinsil of the wrapping but to the word wrapped in commonality wrapped in human skin Lord that we can believe it and accept it and trust it pray you grant it today help us Lord help these children I I pray that they'd have a good Christmas and Lord it's such a wonderful time of year for them Lord as we brother brandham taught us he said we don't just make Christmas about the children we make it about Jesus
