[39:06] they were brought before
[39:10] the time is home they were told that he
[39:18] was spare their lives
[39:22] they would renounce but
[39:26] the name of Christ
[39:36] the Son of God
[39:39] they would not deny
[39:43] like a great and generic why

[40:46] honor his command for I pledge

[42:23] The
[42:25] Lamb aren't you glad you're glad to have
[42:28] a lamb to pledge allegiance to this
[42:30] morning amen let's bow our hips together
[42:33] and
[42:35] father we're so grateful to be in your
[42:37] house this morning we couldn't thank you
[42:39] enough for the wonderful blessings that
[42:41] you've given us Lord of life and of
[42:44] Liberty to be able to worship together
[42:45] we're so grateful for that today I pray
[42:48] you bless each and every one that are
[42:50] here Lord listening this morning I pray
[42:53] that it would be more than just words
[42:55] that are spoken but Lord may it become a
[42:57] revelation in our hearts
[42:58] Lord your word is so important to us so
[43:01] we cherish it so much Lord so we put
[43:03] aside this moment of the day in just a
[43:06] few moments to forget about everything
[43:07] else and and let you speak to us Lord I
[43:11] pray you do that in a supernatural way
[43:13] this morning maybe there'd be someone
[43:15] that's sick this morning or in need or
[43:17] or just just needs to be encouraged in
[43:20] some way I pray you would do that by the
[43:22] ministry of your word Lord as we're
[43:24] gathered together for one purpose and
[43:25] that's to worship you with all of our
[43:28] hearts Lord I pray that would be done
[43:29] you would accept our worship today in
[43:32] Jesus name we ask it amen amen
[43:37] amen Psalm chapter 37 and verse 5 and
[43:41] then we'll read also from John 16 33.
[43:45] Psalm 37 5 and John 16 33 these
[43:48] scriptures were just going around in my
[43:51] mind all week I couldn't get away from
[43:53] it so I just have to to deal with this
[43:56] this morning
[43:58] and maybe just kind of different but uh
[44:01] kind of throw a curveball this morning
[44:04] but I trust it'll be a blessing to you
[44:06] I'm going to talk about the secret to
[44:08] cheerfulness the secret to cheerfulness
[44:11] Psalm 37 and 5 commit thy way unto the
[44:15] Lord trust also in him and he shall
[44:19] bring it to pass
[44:22] and then John 16 33
[44:27] so these things I have spoken unto you
[44:29] that in me you might have peace
[44:33] in the world you shall have tribulation
[44:36] but be of good cheer
[44:39] I have overcome the world aren't you
[44:43] glad for that today
[44:44] amen God bless you you can have your
[44:47] seats
[44:51] cheerfulness is the quality or state of
[44:55] being noticeably happy
[44:58] and optimistic
[45:00] the quality or state of being noticeably
[45:03] happy and optimistic noticeably Charles
[45:07] Dickens said that cheerfulness and
[45:09] contentment are great beautifiers
[45:12] and famous preservers of good looks
[45:17] you can tell when somebody's cheerful
[45:20] it's different in a small way from
[45:22] happiness or joy because cheerfulness is
[45:26] what shows on the outside and say well I
[45:28] have joy on the inside but yet it
[45:31] matters what we are displaying on the
[45:34] outside as well cheerfulness is
[45:37] happiness that lasts and joy that shows
[45:40] itself
[45:42] and it's a pleasant disposition it's not
[45:45] just someone that's laughing all the
[45:47] time or or cutting up or telling jokes
[45:49] that that could be somebody who's really
[45:51] hurting and yet they do that to cover
[45:54] that up but cheerfulness is just a
[45:56] pleasant disposition it it ought to be
[45:59] our our default position our fallback
[46:02] position as Believers that we are not
[46:05] unhappy but we're happy we're not uh
[46:08] we're not the opposite of cheerfulness
[46:10] is melancholy we're not melancholy but
[46:13] we're actually in a state of
[46:15] cheerfulness and I know this is a hard a
[46:18] hard world that we live in to be able to
[46:20] keep that that kind of a mindset it's
[46:23] difficult because the world is there's
[46:25] so many reasons to be unhappy and I'll
[46:28] just tell you this this morning some of
[46:30] us are born with a little rain cloud a
[46:33] little black cloud following us around I
[46:35] remember the old cartoon of of uh of
[46:39] Eeyore the little donkey that would walk
[46:41] around and there's a little Cloud just
[46:43] just raining on him that's all that
[46:45] there was and wherever he was it rained
[46:48] and and whatever bad might happen it
[46:50] would happen to him and and some people
[46:52] are just that way I I will say this that
[46:55] I I'm born kind of with that under that
[46:58] state where it just seems like so I'm
[47:01] preaching it myself this morning seems
[47:02] like if something bad could happen it's
[47:04] going to happen to me and and it seems
[47:06] like that in fact my nickname growing up
[47:08] was Eeyore
[47:11] uh because it just seemed like I was
[47:13] always preparing myself for the worst
[47:14] for the salmon just always that way and
[47:17] it was just always something coming but
[47:19] I've had to fight that in my life and I
[47:21] want to tell you this is where you have
[47:23] to fight today there's got to be a place
[47:25] in your life where you you pick up your
[47:27] sword and say I'm not going to be just
[47:29] what I am or what the circumstances of
[47:31] my life dictate me to be I'm gonna be
[47:34] different I'm going to live according to
[47:36] the word
[47:38] and so a cheerfulness Jesus is telling
[47:42] his disciples be of good cheer be
[47:44] encouraged be be happy all the time have
[47:48] that as your default now there will be
[47:50] times when you'll be Melancholy but your
[47:53] everyday attitude is one of cheerfulness
[47:55] and someone has said that the eyes of
[47:58] the cheerful and of The Melancholy Man
[48:00] are fixed on the same creation but very
[48:03] different are the aspects which it Bears
[48:05] to them so in other words The Melancholy
[48:08] Man when he looks at a situation in life
[48:10] or just looks at the world in general
[48:12] everything is uh is is looking bad
[48:16] everything is looking wrong I I remember
[48:19] that uh a story someone told him that
[48:23] there was two kids that born in the same
[48:25] house and and they were very uh one was
[48:28] very optimistic and one was very
[48:30] negative
[48:31] and so they were born in the same house
[48:33] and and they called in a psychologist
[48:35] they said how how can we fix this he
[48:38] said well he said I'll tell you what
[48:39] we'll do he said we'll we'll give uh
[48:42] we'll take the one he's got his own room
[48:44] he said we'll take him he said we'll
[48:46] just take a bunch of that stuff out in
[48:47] the barn and said uh he's real positive
[48:50] so we'll tell him that he's getting some
[48:52] present we'll take a bunch of that stuff
[48:54] out of the barn and we'll put it in his
[48:55] room it'll just be a big pile of it and
[48:57] and uh in his room and and then he'll
[49:00] learn that there's nothing there and so
[49:02] he'll learn to correct that where he's
[49:04] not not just always over over positive
[49:07] and said well the other one what we'll
[49:08] do is we'll take in his room we'll put a
[49:10] great big pile of toys because he won't
[49:12] be expecting that so they did that and
[49:16] they they went in the room and they go
[49:17] in the room where the boy is that uh
[49:19] that got the great big uh pile of toys
[49:22] and he's in there just crying and a
[49:25] weeping he said I just know somebody
[49:27] else got more than I did and and I just
[49:30] know that these toys are going to be
[49:31] broken and they're just all going to go
[49:33] away and there's a catch to it somewhere
[49:36] and they went in the other room and
[49:38] here's this boy he's just a digging in
[49:41] this pile of dirt and he said uh with
[49:43] all this he said there must be a pony
[49:45] somewhere
[49:51] your State of Mind matters
[49:56] right so many people go into life with
[49:59] that you could give them everything yeah
[50:02] and they just never feel like it's
[50:03] enough
[50:05] and we don't want to be like that and
[50:06] but when you're cheerful very little
[50:09] bothers you
[50:12] now you know this is right I know this
[50:15] is right when your Melancholy everything
[50:18] bothers you
[50:19] and spiritual people are sometimes the
[50:22] most Melancholy I'll say this that
[50:24] brother Branham dealt with that and and
[50:27] it's people who have a an insight and a
[50:29] spiritual realm they're Melancholy
[50:30] people gifted people many times are are
[50:33] Melancholy and yet the The Melancholy or
[50:36] the depression that they go through the
[50:37] things that they go through that's not a
[50:39] spiritual attribute
[50:41] it's not a it's not part of the gift
[50:44] it's just something that's there they're
[50:47] made a certain way and they're more
[50:49] sensitive to things and I found
[50:51] musicians uh forgive me musicians here
[50:54] this morning we've got wonderful
[50:55] musicians but musicians tend to be more
[50:57] uh easier to how can I put this without
[51:00] without offending the musicians but
[51:03] musicians tend to be easier to offend
[51:05] than other people
[51:06] people are real musicians and it's just
[51:09] they they're more High Strung they're
[51:11] more tuned to that kind of a thing and
[51:13] it's that's just the way that they're
[51:15] built but
[51:16] when you look at that you begin to
[51:18] realize it's not a spiritual attribute
[51:21] and so if you're that way it doesn't
[51:23] make you more holy to be that way
[51:26] being sad does not make you holy
[51:31] right amen it doesn't make you more
[51:34] Godly
[51:35] it doesn't make you even recognizing all
[51:38] that's going wrong in the world
[51:40] doesn't make you more uh oh I I I'm up
[51:45] on the news and I understand all the bad
[51:48] things that are happening that does not
[51:49] make you more spiritual than somebody
[51:51] who doesn't look at it at all
[51:54] but it what it takes is it takes faith
[51:57] faith is what we operate off of we don't
[51:59] operate off emotion we don't operate off
[52:02] of the sensation we operate off of faith
[52:04] in the word that's where we're supposed
[52:06] to operate and the only way you can do
[52:08] that is to have the right kind of
[52:10] attitude towards the word
[52:13] now
[52:15] sometimes
[52:16] Melancholy is caused not all the time
[52:20] we'll get to one of the other reasons in
[52:22] a moment
[52:23] but sometimes Melancholy is caused by a
[52:27] lack of faith in the atonement
[52:31] and we know that that was true of Cain
[52:32] remember when Cain came before and I
[52:37] just want to use this to illustrate this
[52:38] morning I'm not calling you Cain so
[52:40] that's just the Melancholy talking
[52:43] but Cain was a man who he went to offer
[52:47] sacrifice and and he didn't have a
[52:50] revelation of the blood and so he went
[52:53] and he he worked hard
[52:55] and he cut he got his best fruits and
[52:58] his best vegetables and all the produce
[53:01] that he could find and he dug it up you
[53:03] know like many people do they think well
[53:05] if I get this certain understanding I
[53:07] would dig up this certain understanding
[53:09] this certain thing and and then God will
[53:11] accept me and and so he goes and he
[53:14] brings it out there and they have church
[53:16] to gather him and Abel and he realizes
[53:18] at some point Abel's getting blessed the
[53:21] fire of God is consuming what's on
[53:22] Abel's altar but it's not it's not
[53:25] touching his and so he begins to get
[53:27] really upset he begins to get Melancholy
[53:29] and and the Lord asked him he says why
[53:32] why is your countenance falling
[53:35] why are you visibly distressed
[53:38] why are why is your accountant as well
[53:40] why are you angry and the reason was
[53:43] because he he had trusted in his works
[53:47] that they would be able to get him uh
[53:51] that God would be pleased with them
[53:53] and I want us to be careful today
[53:55] because we do not trust in our works
[54:00] that'll make you sad every time
[54:03] that'll give you a Melancholy attitude
[54:06] when you trust well I go to church I pay
[54:08] my tithes those things are good we want
[54:10] you to do that but that's not what we
[54:12] trust in we don't trust in the fact that
[54:14] we have long dresses or long hair or the
[54:17] men do we don't cuss we don't chew we we
[54:19] want to live holy lives but we cannot
[54:22] put our trust in that because every time
[54:24] it's going to fail us
[54:28] you're going to look at that altar
[54:29] someday and you're going to look at
[54:30] yourself done it all and I'm still
[54:33] unhappy
[54:35] I'm still bitter
[54:37] and I'm still don't want to come to
[54:39] church I got to drag myself to church
[54:43] because you're just trusting and some
[54:45] people who you know you fall into sin
[54:48] and I would say that all of us at some
[54:50] point have backslid
[54:54] you backside you do something you
[54:56] shouldn't do
[54:57] and you fall into sin and and you come
[55:00] out of that
[55:01] and then you put your trust in well I'm
[55:04] better than I was
[55:07] but I'm telling you that's a mistake
[55:08] this morning
[55:10] because the next time you have a bad
[55:12] attitude or something comes along or or
[55:14] you fall in some way your trust is going
[55:18] to be shattered
[55:19] and there will be a moment when you when
[55:22] you in your life where you get to where
[55:24] you can't put confidence in almost
[55:26] anything it just seems like everything
[55:28] is out of control and it seems like the
[55:31] word isn't working the way it's supposed
[55:33] to in your favor there's going to be
[55:35] those times and the truth is we just
[55:37] don't understand the mind of God we
[55:39] don't think like God does we can't we
[55:42] can't operate in that sphere and we
[55:43] don't understand it's for our good we
[55:46] can't comprehend it and so it makes us
[55:48] Melancholy because we put our trust in
[55:51] the fact that things were working yeah
[55:53] but we don't put our trust in the fact
[55:55] that it works
[55:56] our trust in the fact we had a good
[55:58] service we don't put our trust in the
[56:01] fact that we came to church
[56:03] are you with me now but we put our trust
[56:05] in only in the blood of Jesus Christ
[56:08] listen to what he told Cain if thou
[56:09] doest well shalt thou not be accepted
[56:14] so now he said if you had had a
[56:16] revelation you would have brought the
[56:18] right sacrifice but the right sacrifice
[56:20] was not what you could do with the work
[56:22] of your hands
[56:23] it was blood
[56:26] so brother Brandon talking about that he
[56:27] said my he said so what we got to worry
[56:29] about
[56:30] yeah why are you walking along with a
[56:33] long face
[56:35] like to eat oats
[56:37] the bottom of a churn
[56:41] most of us have never experienced that
[56:44] like you got a bad sandwich at
[56:46] McDonald's
[56:48] they didn't give you all the fries
[56:53] said why he said my smile
[56:56] we're happy we're Christians and God has
[56:59] ordained us so and has given Christ
[57:03] for us
[57:05] and it begins to explain how we did not
[57:07] seek God yeah come on God sought us
[57:11] and he uses a scripture in John 6 44 no
[57:13] man can come to me except the Father
[57:15] which has sent me draw him and I will
[57:18] raise him up at the last day he said so
[57:21] now whether we live whether we die
[57:23] whether the world stands whether it
[57:25] doesn't
[57:26] whether the people thinks this or that
[57:28] there's only one alternative that we
[57:30] should have that's worship God and be
[57:33] just as happy as we can be
[57:35] believe him for everything he said
[57:38] because life or death or nothing can
[57:40] separate us from the love of God that's
[57:42] in Christ
[57:43] and there will be with him in his
[57:45] presence forever
[57:49] see a man who trusts in his works is
[57:52] still condemned
[57:53] because somehow he knows that God
[57:55] doesn't accept it
[57:57] but a man who trusts in the blood of
[57:59] Jesus Christ is free from condemnation
[58:01] the Bible says there is therefore now no
[58:04] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[58:06] Jesus who walk not after the flesh but
[58:08] after the spirit right
[58:10] and brother Branham likened it to an
[58:13] eagle that would watch over their young
[58:15] ones he said the mama Eagle would fly up
[58:17] on on the side of the hill and here in
[58:20] the valley would be the little egress
[58:22] and and they had rode down there on her
[58:23] wings and and they were just down there
[58:25] having a Pentecostal Revival
[58:27] tumbling and and moving he said why
[58:30] aren't they scared
[58:32] some wolf could come out some cougar
[58:34] could come out some Predator could come
[58:36] out and try to a coyote could come out
[58:38] of the Wilderness and try to attack them
[58:40] and he's watching this scene taking
[58:43] place watching through binoculars and he
[58:46] said but what he didn't realize at first
[58:48] he said he saw that mother eagle and he
[58:50] realized she could get to them faster
[58:53] than any predator
[58:55] yeah so they had nothing to worry about
[58:57] she would never leave them in a place I
[59:00] hope you hear me this morning that she
[59:02] could not get to them faster than any
[59:04] predator listen to me that Christ will
[59:07] never lead you or leave you in a place
[59:09] where you cannot he cannot get to you
[59:11] faster than any predator
[59:13] faster than the enemy
[59:16] oh my the Bible says that the enemy is
[59:19] like a roaring lion seeking whom he made
[59:20] the power but this also says resist the
[59:22] enemy resist the devil and he'll flee
[59:24] from you
[59:26] amen
[59:28] so
[59:29] they're sitting there they're tumbling
[59:31] over each other they're being watched
[59:33] though
[59:35] while they're there so they can be
[59:37] carefree they can be happy they can have
[59:40] an attitude an attitude of cheerfulness
[59:44] there in the valley oh my an attitude of
[59:47] cheerfulness because because they know
[59:50] who's watching over them oh wonder about
[59:52] us today within this church service if
[59:55] we could have an attitude of
[59:56] cheerfulness because we know who's
[59:58] watching over us
[1:00:00] he said he's watching over you tonight
[1:00:02] he said just have a good time that's
[1:00:04] what he wants you to do be happy
[1:00:07] don't go along with a great long face he
[1:00:10] said be happy rejoice in the spirit
[1:00:13] there's no condemnation to them that are
[1:00:15] in Christ Jesus that won't not after the
[1:00:17] flesh but the spirit no condemnation to
[1:00:19] them that's in Christ Jesus that's laid
[1:00:21] aside every weight and the sin that so
[1:00:22] easily beset them
[1:00:24] amen
[1:00:26] listen again he said you can't fail
[1:00:30] do we need to get our eyes off our works
[1:00:34] he said you can't fail
[1:00:37] well um well if I don't the spirit of
[1:00:39] God might not move if we don't all if we
[1:00:42] don't all do exactly as we should we
[1:00:44] don't we we don't serve God like that
[1:00:47] you don't serve God out of fear we
[1:00:49] should want to show up to church early
[1:00:51] not because somebody makes us
[1:00:53] we should want to come to the house of
[1:00:55] God not because somebody got a gun to
[1:00:56] our head
[1:00:57] forced us to come to church it should be
[1:01:00] a desire there yeah because he said you
[1:01:03] can't fail there's no failing in it it
[1:01:05] don't rest upon what I do it rests upon
[1:01:08] what he did it's already finished
[1:01:11] the believer once anchored in Christ
[1:01:13] Jesus coming through the door back there
[1:01:15] now watch he said he's coming through
[1:01:16] the door put on this highway he said you
[1:01:19] can't get any way but straight up to God
[1:01:22] with it you've been on a one-way Street
[1:01:26] you know what one-way street is you're
[1:01:28] going one way
[1:01:30] you can't turn around it's one way
[1:01:33] he said this is a one-way Street the
[1:01:35] believer once anchored in Christ Jesus
[1:01:37] coming to the door back there put on
[1:01:39] this highway you can't get anyway but
[1:01:41] straight up to God within angels to take
[1:01:43] care of you he said God made a way of
[1:01:45] this yeah when he's seen in the
[1:01:47] beginning in our first parents fall he
[1:01:49] seen the Covenant he made with Adam he
[1:01:51] tried to hook the ladder into him and it
[1:01:52] failed he said then there's nothing else
[1:01:54] he could hook it to but to bring down
[1:01:56] his own son and hook it to him so it
[1:01:58] can't fail now he said so what are we
[1:02:01] worried about
[1:02:02] what are we stewing about
[1:02:04] come on now why we go along with a great
[1:02:06] big long face
[1:02:08] let's look up in grin look up and not
[1:02:10] only grin but laugh not only laugh but
[1:02:12] raise up holy hands everywhere giving
[1:02:14] praise and glory to God for his promises
[1:02:16] is yea and amen not yes and no not yes
[1:02:19] and no but yes
[1:02:21] he said there's no no in it
[1:02:24] yes
[1:02:25] our foundation stands sure the
[1:02:28] foundation of God laid in Zion the
[1:02:30] Cornerstone there we are can't slip
[1:02:33] can't side can't move
[1:02:36] oh my every time the Devil comes after
[1:02:39] you and tries to tell you look look what
[1:02:41] look what you're doing look what you are
[1:02:42] look look what's going on in the world I
[1:02:45] can't say it I can't side I can't move
[1:02:48] thus saith oh I hope you hear me today
[1:02:50] God sent a prophet in this day to tell
[1:02:53] you you can't slip you can't side you
[1:02:55] can't move
[1:02:56] [Applause]
[1:02:59] I break out of this Melancholy once in a
[1:03:01] while
[1:03:05] oh my he said then we come into the door
[1:03:08] through Christ put on here he said oh we
[1:03:11] may have our ups and downs along I mean
[1:03:13] we have ups and downs
[1:03:15] the rest of y'all aren't human
[1:03:18] y'all are angels we humans have ups and
[1:03:21] downs
[1:03:23] Oh my he said that's true in our
[1:03:25] sicknesses and troubles yeah
[1:03:27] but remember there's a great company of
[1:03:30] angels all along the road pair thee up
[1:03:34] at any time
[1:03:36] glory to God do we really believe it
[1:03:39] do we really believe it if you really
[1:03:41] believe it it creates an atmosphere of
[1:03:45] cheerfulness in your life
[1:03:47] because you know you're sitting there
[1:03:49] playing in the grass but he can get to
[1:03:51] you before anything bad could happen
[1:03:54] you are not going to go if you die and
[1:03:57] leave this earth that doesn't that
[1:03:59] doesn't build pressure for the remnants
[1:04:00] and letting off the pressure he said you
[1:04:02] don't even get under pressure because
[1:04:03] you're going to die he said because if
[1:04:05] you die you're just going home to be
[1:04:06] with him
[1:04:09] oh my it's not to get a hold of you say
[1:04:11] well I'm old and I'm under pressure yes
[1:04:13] I I feel that sometimes believe it or
[1:04:15] not I feel like well about half my life
[1:04:17] is over it makes you Melancholy but when
[1:04:19] you begin to dwell on the Promises of
[1:04:21] God he said you can't die he didn't
[1:04:23] believeth on me shall never die
[1:04:26] do we believe it today
[1:04:30] amen
[1:04:31] said he's there he promised it
[1:04:34] Hallelujah and he had to make a way of
[1:04:36] it
[1:04:38] you aren't always going to be cheerful
[1:04:42] things are going to make you sad yeah
[1:04:45] yeah and there's a time to grief
[1:04:47] it's time to cry there's a certain
[1:04:49] healing in that
[1:04:51] but you can't live that way right
[1:04:54] you just can't live your life like that
[1:04:58] sometimes Melancholy it's not sometimes
[1:05:01] it's not a lack of trust in the promise
[1:05:03] sometimes it's caused by change
[1:05:06] change in your life
[1:05:09] and I think all of us experience this
[1:05:11] well I know we all do the Bible says a
[1:05:13] merry heart maketh a cheerful
[1:05:15] countenance
[1:05:16] but by sorrow of the heart the spirit is
[1:05:19] broken
[1:05:20] and so there's Sorrows that come that
[1:05:23] make us sad sometimes and and changes
[1:05:26] that come and things many times that we
[1:05:28] don't even understand that we're going
[1:05:30] through because we go through Junctions
[1:05:33] in life
[1:05:34] and and I want you to listen closely
[1:05:36] because this will come this will come
[1:05:39] and and many times Well I we don't want
[1:05:42] it we're human beings we don't want to
[1:05:44] be foolish about these things we need to
[1:05:46] understand why there's times of life
[1:05:49] that we go through that's going to cause
[1:05:50] us pain and and it's going to cause a
[1:05:53] smelling call it's going to cause a
[1:05:54] sadness and it's just part of it and
[1:05:57] it's how we deal with that because that
[1:05:59] can break you just just life itself
[1:06:03] we'll break you if you let it
[1:06:07] you don't have to be born under any
[1:06:09] certain sort of curse
[1:06:11] for life to break you
[1:06:13] you could be born in the best home have
[1:06:15] the best raising the best family and
[1:06:17] life itself will break you
[1:06:19] unless you have confidence in God
[1:06:22] all right there's got to be a faith and
[1:06:24] a confidence there because there's going
[1:06:26] to be bad things happen life is
[1:06:28] suffering it is pain and I've told even
[1:06:31] my kids especially Peter lately I said
[1:06:33] you've got to embrace a little bit of
[1:06:35] pain in your life you've got to be
[1:06:36] willing to to push through and that's
[1:06:39] what we see so much of this in this
[1:06:41] generation it seems like kids and young
[1:06:44] people they're not willing to push
[1:06:45] through the pain to get the reward
[1:06:48] there's going to be pain sometimes
[1:06:49] you're going to be sick
[1:06:50] and you got to go to work anyway yeah
[1:06:53] yeah sometimes you're going to be you're
[1:06:54] going to hurt and you've got to you've
[1:06:57] got to get up and move on sometimes
[1:06:59] you're going to be in a moment how do
[1:07:01] you do it yeah
[1:07:05] I remember
[1:07:07] when my dad passed away
[1:07:10] and let me just be real personal to you
[1:07:12] for a moment but when dad passed away it
[1:07:15] was hard on us he died too young he died
[1:07:17] there were so many unresolved issues in
[1:07:20] so many ways and you all some of you
[1:07:22] have had family members like that that
[1:07:24] have passed away and you wonder some
[1:07:27] things have been different had they
[1:07:28] gotten older had they been able to live
[1:07:31] and I remember
[1:07:33] that one of the things that upset me
[1:07:36] is that everybody come in so there's
[1:07:38] like 300 people at the funeral and all
[1:07:40] these people that barely knew knew us
[1:07:42] but they were there because Dad got out
[1:07:44] a lot and he was very very uh gregarious
[1:07:46] very open to people and and so he uh he
[1:07:51] had a lot of people at the funeral and
[1:07:52] they come in and Mom's booking motel
[1:07:54] rooms and
[1:07:55] and uh
[1:07:57] and cooking for people
[1:07:59] and she don't know what I'm going to say
[1:08:02] this morning
[1:08:03] I didn't plan this
[1:08:05] if she's doing all that and I remember
[1:08:06] getting a little upset about that
[1:08:09] but you know what
[1:08:11] it helped her
[1:08:13] she's just doing what she normally did
[1:08:15] you know we did the day of the funeral
[1:08:17] we went into town we used to go to the
[1:08:19] to the rec center the community center
[1:08:21] and play ping pong
[1:08:24] the day of the funeral we went into town
[1:08:26] before the funeral and and did that and
[1:08:29] Mom sat there with us and watched us
[1:08:30] boys play ping pong that's what that's
[1:08:33] what we did
[1:08:35] that sounds cold doesn't it but we were
[1:08:37] just doing life
[1:08:39] sometimes you just have to move on
[1:08:42] you can't you can only take so much
[1:08:44] broker there'll be a time to grieve but
[1:08:46] you can only take so much
[1:08:50] and it does make you Melancholy it makes
[1:08:52] you sad when things happen still when I
[1:08:54] think of my father it brings just a
[1:08:56] touch of sadness and yet I believe
[1:08:59] my faith is strong enough that wasn't a
[1:09:02] perfect man but I believe I'll see him
[1:09:03] one day
[1:09:05] my faith is strong enough that one day
[1:09:08] I'm going to see him
[1:09:09] and I really believe that
[1:09:11] and how could I get through life listen
[1:09:13] Paul says if we don't believe in the
[1:09:15] resurrection we are of all men most
[1:09:18] miserable
[1:09:19] but if we do believe no matter what's
[1:09:21] happened for the steward no matter what
[1:09:23] the situation you might have you might
[1:09:24] have somebody that that just all your
[1:09:26] life you wish a relationship had been
[1:09:28] better but then they passed on you think
[1:09:29] how can I fix it but all the knots that
[1:09:31] we tie over here will be untied over
[1:09:33] there
[1:09:34] somehow we'll understand each other yeah
[1:09:38] he said well is everybody going to make
[1:09:39] it no not everybody's gonna make it but
[1:09:41] I believe for my family I believe for
[1:09:43] those in my family I believe for those
[1:09:45] in this church I believe for you that
[1:09:47] you're going to make it are you with me
[1:09:49] now I don't want one of you to be lost
[1:09:50] what am I doing I'm taking the example
[1:09:52] of Jesus Christ who said not one of them
[1:09:54] is lost except the Son of Perdition yeah
[1:09:56] not one oh my shouldn't we shouldn't we
[1:09:59] take that same attitude I believe my
[1:10:02] family will be saved
[1:10:05] it was hard to be cheerful
[1:10:07] when you go through something like that
[1:10:09] yeah
[1:10:10] it's difficult but sometimes you just
[1:10:12] need to do what you would normally do
[1:10:15] just have the attitude you would
[1:10:16] normally have it'll be okay
[1:10:22] how do you write you know you know
[1:10:23] Hattie right
[1:10:25] the most Supernatural story that we have
[1:10:27] in this message is how do you write
[1:10:29] to me more than the raising of the Dead
[1:10:32] because here's a widow woman who speaks
[1:10:35] herself
[1:10:36] and to me she's a type of the Bride
[1:10:39] operating under the word the third poll
[1:10:41] of brother Brandon's Ministry was the
[1:10:43] opening of the word and it was
[1:10:45] identified by the fact that she could
[1:10:47] she's the woman stood there with a woman
[1:10:50] stood there and said he said what do you
[1:10:52] want you speak it
[1:10:54] and it'll be and she asks for the right
[1:10:56] thing
[1:10:59] but had he had a sister named Edith
[1:11:02] and Edith had been sick all of her life
[1:11:04] in fact in that story brother random
[1:11:06] tells about Edith and how he said here's
[1:11:08] your sister she's been sick all these
[1:11:09] years if you say it should be well
[1:11:12] yeah
[1:11:14] but she was Edith was an interesting
[1:11:17] case brother Brandon said there was
[1:11:18] nothing wrong with her physically
[1:11:20] outside of infantile paralysis so she
[1:11:23] had had she'd become crippled when she
[1:11:25] was about six months old
[1:11:27] and so he tells that and she couldn't
[1:11:30] even move her limbs apart and he said
[1:11:32] she screamed and cried all of her life
[1:11:34] nearly
[1:11:35] he said to we prayed for him many years
[1:11:37] ago
[1:11:38] and she's been happy ever since until
[1:11:41] about a year ago
[1:11:42] so she had been going through some
[1:11:44] something in her life and and she's
[1:11:46] she's you'd think
[1:11:48] that just her condition because she's
[1:11:50] completely crippled and invalid you'd
[1:11:52] think that alone would be enough to not
[1:11:54] make her cheerful
[1:11:55] but it wasn't
[1:11:58] it wasn't right
[1:12:01] so much so
[1:12:03] that so much so that uh
[1:12:07] they noticed the family noticed
[1:12:09] when she lost it
[1:12:11] when she quit being happy
[1:12:13] she quit being cheerful and I would
[1:12:16] present you this morning that it's not
[1:12:17] what you're going through that's making
[1:12:19] you unhappy
[1:12:21] as much as it is what's around you
[1:12:25] or how you respond to what's around you
[1:12:27] yeah
[1:12:28] now look
[1:12:30] well I know it's difficult to think of
[1:12:32] but think about it one of the happiest
[1:12:33] people I've ever known was a young man
[1:12:35] named Tommy Thomas who couldn't even
[1:12:36] speak
[1:12:38] but he my grandpa had him there and he
[1:12:40] he was a foster child and they adopted
[1:12:42] him I believe they adopted him and he
[1:12:44] was sitting there in the living room and
[1:12:46] and in a wheelchair he couldn't even
[1:12:47] speak all he could do but when Grandpa
[1:12:49] would come in the room his eyes would
[1:12:50] light up
[1:12:52] he couldn't make he just makes sounds
[1:12:54] but he gets so excited when my grandpa
[1:12:57] come in the room he was a happy young
[1:12:58] man
[1:12:59] he's about my age I think he's passed
[1:13:01] away now but he was from from birth he
[1:13:04] was very very sick but he couldn't even
[1:13:06] speak he couldn't maybe understand the
[1:13:08] way we understand but he was happy
[1:13:10] he was cheerful
[1:13:11] cheered you up to be around him
[1:13:14] you don't have to be well to be cheerful
[1:13:19] I know that's hard and you know it's not
[1:13:22] just we look at somebody with all kinds
[1:13:23] of illness you know but you take some of
[1:13:25] us guys you know we get the man flu I'll
[1:13:27] just talk about us because we can take
[1:13:28] it but
[1:13:30] we get down a little bit I do this I do
[1:13:32] this on Mondays you know after you get
[1:13:34] you know you get kind of tired and you
[1:13:36] preach through a little illness and a
[1:13:37] little sickness and you get grouchy Joel
[1:13:39] gets grouchy after a church man he's so
[1:13:42] pleasant in church but you you just see
[1:13:45] him after he preaches and
[1:13:48] just grouchy it's all good just just
[1:13:50] bite your head off you know and and I do
[1:13:53] that too I do that constantly just just
[1:13:55] as soon as I get come down out of the
[1:13:58] anointing and you'll get you feel bad
[1:14:00] and and yet it's not you know we could
[1:14:03] break out of that
[1:14:05] we don't have to do that
[1:14:08] and again everybody's going to be
[1:14:10] unhappy sometimes but but we can't stay
[1:14:12] like that
[1:14:14] we gotta move on
[1:14:16] because there's another service coming
[1:14:18] there's more people to talk to
[1:14:20] you
[1:14:22] some of y'all know what that's like
[1:14:24] but you don't have to be well to be
[1:14:25] cheerful you can feel bad
[1:14:28] and still be happy
[1:14:31] now
[1:14:32] brother Branham when you talk about
[1:14:34] Edith he said she was going through
[1:14:35] menopause
[1:14:36] he said in other words the changing of
[1:14:37] her life he said her nerves her in such
[1:14:39] tremendous condition the lady has got on
[1:14:41] her mind that she's dying she's just not
[1:14:42] going to live just from one hour to the
[1:14:44] other
[1:14:45] he said you know healthy strong women
[1:14:46] have a terrible time sometimes have to
[1:14:48] take shots of hormone and on
[1:14:49] institutions take shock treatments
[1:14:51] everything during that time but the way
[1:14:53] they treated things back then
[1:14:55] the human being has two changes of life
[1:14:58] they have to change from a boy to a man
[1:15:00] from a girl to a woman about 16 17 years
[1:15:04] old let me just dwell on that for a
[1:15:06] minute
[1:15:08] because I have a 16 year old sitting
[1:15:11] back there running the video happy that
[1:15:13] he's in the back right now
[1:15:17] I don't understand him
[1:15:20] he don't understand me
[1:15:23] and when I was a child when I was 16 my
[1:15:26] dad didn't understand me
[1:15:28] and I didn't understand him and his dad
[1:15:30] didn't understand that's just the way it
[1:15:31] is
[1:15:35] he didn't want to go to work the other
[1:15:36] day he'd been working some and he didn't
[1:15:38] want to go to work and so he he called
[1:15:40] he said he wasn't gonna go to work and
[1:15:42] that morning I got him up at 6 30 in the
[1:15:44] morning and we went for a run I haven't
[1:15:46] done that in years but
[1:15:49] we went we went to we both collapsed
[1:15:54] yes sometimes you just don't understand
[1:15:57] each other
[1:16:00] sound like a terrible father don't I
[1:16:03] he said about seeing 17 years old they
[1:16:05] get like a bunch of just fly by nights
[1:16:11] you just they don't know what they're
[1:16:13] going to do but we went through that too
[1:16:15] yeah
[1:16:17] all right he said and if you can just
[1:16:19] suffer with them during that age
[1:16:22] ain't that the truth
[1:16:24] if you can just suffer with them because
[1:16:26] they are suffering and they don't know
[1:16:28] why
[1:16:30] and they're not cheerful yeah
[1:16:33] they don't know why they're not cheerful
[1:16:35] but it's just you just suffer with them
[1:16:38] he said I got a daughter in that age
[1:16:39] right now Rebecca pray for her
[1:16:42] he said in Billy oh every one of us we
[1:16:43] come through that little frantic age
[1:16:46] and so we must suffer with them
[1:16:48] realizing it's something that they have
[1:16:50] to go through
[1:16:52] he said and now Edith with this changing
[1:16:54] of the seven years every seven years
[1:16:55] your life changes
[1:16:57] he said so the seven times seven you see
[1:16:59] it makes it kind of hard he said that's
[1:17:01] a complete change it bothers the women
[1:17:03] he said men usually get kind of a funny
[1:17:04] carrying on during that time and
[1:17:06] sometimes leave their wives he said but
[1:17:08] women are unfertile after that and he
[1:17:10] said we all go through that we must
[1:17:11] remember that it's things that we must
[1:17:13] bear with one another and understand
[1:17:15] those things
[1:17:17] so what she needed now was to be cheered
[1:17:20] up but what I want to get to is listen
[1:17:22] to what brother Brandon prescribes for
[1:17:24] Edith
[1:17:25] he said little Edith has gotten this
[1:17:27] condition and she's lost much weight and
[1:17:30] she looks bad
[1:17:31] and I tell you some night he said not
[1:17:33] all of you together but just a little
[1:17:35] trip down and I'll be honest with you
[1:17:36] I'm the worst at doing this
[1:17:39] some of you guys just remind me but you
[1:17:41] know what if you want if you need
[1:17:42] somebody to visit it's okay to ask
[1:17:46] I'm not going to look down on you
[1:17:48] because you asked you are not bothering
[1:17:50] me if you ask I'll be at your door
[1:17:54] if you ask I promise you that
[1:17:57] I'll be there if I can be at all but it
[1:18:00] don't hurt you to ask you say well you
[1:18:02] should anticipate it yes but sometimes
[1:18:05] human beings get busy right
[1:18:07] it's just what we do we got other things
[1:18:09] on our mind but it's okay to ask I I'd
[1:18:12] implore you to do that if you're sick if
[1:18:13] you're in need you're not bothering me
[1:18:15] give me a phone call let me know if you
[1:18:18] need help let me know what's going on so
[1:18:20] we can help so we can pray at least
[1:18:23] and but he said little you just got this
[1:18:25] condition and he said I'll tell you not
[1:18:27] all of you together but just a little
[1:18:28] trip down he said they set up with her
[1:18:30] day and night a little trip down there
[1:18:32] from this Tabernacle in the different
[1:18:33] Tabernacles the sister Tabernacles here
[1:18:36] when did we start only caring for the
[1:18:38] people in our church
[1:18:43] where did that come from
[1:18:46] these are brothers and sisters
[1:18:51] I got things on my mind right now people
[1:18:53] that I know relationships have been
[1:18:55] broken and different things it's on my
[1:18:56] mind constantly I want to make that
[1:18:58] right I want to help them in some way I
[1:18:59] want to see what I can do they don't go
[1:19:01] to my church they'll never help me in
[1:19:02] any way but I want to help them I don't
[1:19:06] want to help you most of all my first
[1:19:07] responsibility is here but wherever we
[1:19:09] can be a help let's be a help
[1:19:12] it's not all the pastor's job
[1:19:14] it's not all the deacons jobs it's us
[1:19:17] we're a body Let's help one another
[1:19:21] he said a little trip down there from
[1:19:23] this Tabernacle and the different
[1:19:25] Tabernacles the sister Tabernacles
[1:19:28] he said here some of you people go down
[1:19:30] and see the Wright family I'm sure they
[1:19:31] would appreciate it just go down set
[1:19:33] with them a little while talk to them
[1:19:35] shake their hand if no more than a
[1:19:37] little friendly visit he said we forget
[1:19:39] that so easy you know and when it comes
[1:19:41] to our own home then we appreciate it we
[1:19:43] must remember others appreciate it too
[1:19:45] and the right family I'm sure would
[1:19:47] appreciate that he said I know you would
[1:19:49] have done it if you'd know this
[1:19:51] condition existed but you didn't know it
[1:19:52] so therefore I was telling you this
[1:19:54] morning for it so if you don't know it
[1:19:55] you can't do anything about it
[1:19:58] but he said go visit the right family
[1:20:00] and try to cheer Edith up
[1:20:01] he said now don't tell her she looks bad
[1:20:08] you don't need them kind of visitors
[1:20:12] come on boy you look awful today
[1:20:16] just come to tell you that
[1:20:20] you know just be honest sometimes even a
[1:20:23] preacher you need somebody to visit it's
[1:20:25] got something good to say sometimes
[1:20:28] every time somebody shows up at the door
[1:20:30] oh it's a problem
[1:20:33] oh
[1:20:35] but see he said tell us don't tell her
[1:20:38] she looks bad tell her she looks good
[1:20:40] she's going to be fine
[1:20:42] sometimes we just need to hear that
[1:20:44] Peter you're gonna be okay
[1:20:46] different ones when you're going through
[1:20:48] some things you're gonna be all right
[1:20:50] you're gonna be okay
[1:20:53] tell her she looks good
[1:20:55] she's going to be fine say well I don't
[1:20:56] want to lie well just
[1:21:01] speak spiritually then
[1:21:07] everybody looks good to God
[1:21:14] yeah
[1:21:17] he said she is our sister he said well
[1:21:19] it should be all right if we just keep
[1:21:21] holding on for her yeah that's what
[1:21:23] we're here for
[1:21:24] you she is our sister and we're here to
[1:21:27] hold on in these times for that child
[1:21:31] we're not here just to be blessed
[1:21:34] not about just us
[1:21:37] he said well the preacher wasn't up to
[1:21:39] my my standards today so I'll just sit
[1:21:42] back and be a little critical of that
[1:21:43] maybe if you'd come to church with the
[1:21:45] right attitude and it got behind the
[1:21:47] preacher and and really really started
[1:21:49] saying amen and raising your hand in
[1:21:52] worship and maybe things would have been
[1:21:53] different
[1:21:55] it's a body move
[1:21:56] well the singer is not what I think you
[1:21:58] know what you ought to do get behind it
[1:22:01] get behind it
[1:22:03] complain about it
[1:22:05] especially if you're not the one
[1:22:06] responsible for changing it
[1:22:11] boy I got quiet in there
[1:22:13] we need to cheer one another up
[1:22:18] there's reasons we we do what we do she
[1:22:21] see here here Edith you just need to
[1:22:23] cheered up
[1:22:24] so that's what we're here for she's our
[1:22:26] sister we're here to hold on in these
[1:22:28] times
[1:22:29] for that child
[1:22:30] you got children we need to hold on for
[1:22:32] our children need to hold on for our
[1:22:34] family members
[1:22:36] I'll say this I may not be the most the
[1:22:38] best person to call when you need
[1:22:41] somebody to help maybe it'll be somebody
[1:22:42] else in the church and I want to be
[1:22:44] there for you that's my job to be there
[1:22:46] for you but there may be other people
[1:22:48] that are more skilled in some things
[1:22:50] than what I am
[1:22:51] that's okay
[1:22:53] this isn't a one-man operation
[1:22:56] it's not a dictatorship
[1:22:58] you don't need me
[1:23:00] to make it in the Rapture you need the
[1:23:03] word
[1:23:04] and God called me to preach the word but
[1:23:06] if I die of a heart attack tomorrow
[1:23:08] you'll get somebody else that preaches
[1:23:09] the word
[1:23:12] because you're the people of God
[1:23:15] are you with me now well if I could just
[1:23:17] have the pastor pray for me sometimes we
[1:23:19] just need to pray for one another
[1:23:23] see we we need to show Mercy
[1:23:26] he said he said we're here to hold on to
[1:23:28] these times and he said I want somebody
[1:23:30] to hold for me and pray while I was
[1:23:32] going through my trials you want
[1:23:33] somebody for yours Paul tells us to show
[1:23:35] Mercy with cheerfulness
[1:23:37] show Mercy with cheerfulness to go to be
[1:23:40] an attitude of cheerfulness ourselves so
[1:23:42] we can help somebody else who's not
[1:23:46] Mark Twain said the best way to cheer
[1:23:47] yourself up is to try to cheer somebody
[1:23:49] else up that is the truth
[1:23:55] see God cares about your attitude even
[1:23:56] when you give the Bible says God love is
[1:23:58] a cheerful Giver
[1:24:00] that's cheerful Giver I think of a title
[1:24:03] this the secret to cheerful listen I
[1:24:04] haven't gotten that to that yet
[1:24:08] but the secret to cheerfulness is to
[1:24:10] trust that he's alive yeah
[1:24:13] now this is what this is what Jesus is
[1:24:16] telling them he's saying in Mark in John
[1:24:18] 16 he says I'm going to go through some
[1:24:20] things and and we're going to have we're
[1:24:22] going to have a a real we're gonna
[1:24:25] you're gonna have a real tough time
[1:24:27] I'm going to leave you
[1:24:29] but be of good cheer
[1:24:33] yes what a time to tell him that
[1:24:35] you know sometimes we want we want
[1:24:36] people to commiserate in our suffering
[1:24:38] you need to weep for me you need to be
[1:24:40] there you need to he knew they would all
[1:24:42] leave him
[1:24:44] and he still cared about them
[1:24:46] more than he did about himself
[1:24:49] he said you're all going to leave me but
[1:24:51] be of good cheer
[1:24:54] go read it that's what he said we'll get
[1:24:56] to it if we have time look at look at
[1:24:58] Mary Magdalene what's the secret to
[1:25:01] being cheerful
[1:25:02] it's not to know your pastor
[1:25:05] it's not to have everything going right
[1:25:08] but the secret to being cheerful is to
[1:25:10] know that he's alive
[1:25:12] and that he is with you
[1:25:16] amen
[1:25:18] see many times our trust in the word
[1:25:20] gets shaken by events that happen in
[1:25:23] life
[1:25:24] and we would never maybe admit that but
[1:25:27] there's some tragedy happens in our life
[1:25:29] and our actual trust in the word
[1:25:32] gets shaken
[1:25:34] because and we don't even maybe
[1:25:35] recognize it but we're less optimistic
[1:25:38] we're less we're we're anticipate the
[1:25:40] Rapture last week because of things that
[1:25:42] have happened
[1:25:43] we're just we just don't want to buy in
[1:25:46] we're afraid to just buy in because if I
[1:25:48] did I would have to give up these little
[1:25:50] temporary happinesses that I that I've
[1:25:52] created for myself
[1:25:54] but our trust has been shaken look at
[1:25:57] Mary Magdalene when she goes to the tomb
[1:25:59] and she goes up look at her attitude and
[1:26:01] she goes she's crying she's weeping
[1:26:03] she's been shaken by the events of the
[1:26:05] week
[1:26:06] but when she finds it
[1:26:09] and he speaks to her
[1:26:11] and she identifies himself as who he is
[1:26:14] what does she do she runs back and says
[1:26:16] he's not here he's risen from the dead
[1:26:19] she runs back she was the first one to
[1:26:21] carry the gospel of the good news of the
[1:26:23] resurrection of Jesus Christ
[1:26:26] look you aren't cheerful many times
[1:26:29] we're not cheerful because we we don't
[1:26:32] recognize in the way that we should his
[1:26:34] presence with us
[1:26:38] he's there when you're going through the
[1:26:40] battle he's there during the change of
[1:26:43] your life he's there when you're a
[1:26:44] teenager he's there when you're in
[1:26:46] church he's there when you're on the job
[1:26:48] he's there when you're at home he's
[1:26:50] there when you make mistakes
[1:26:52] he said I'll never leave you never means
[1:26:55] never
[1:26:57] it's not never with a clause not never
[1:27:00] with an out not never with fine print
[1:27:02] but he said now I'll never leave you
[1:27:04] I'll never forsake you
[1:27:12] after his resurrection
[1:27:14] you still with me this morning
[1:27:16] just got a few more minutes
[1:27:22] but the Joel will preached to us tonight
[1:27:24] looking forward to hearing that
[1:27:28] after his resurrection Jesus were near
[1:27:30] cleopas and his friend they were walking
[1:27:32] home we've told the story many times but
[1:27:34] Jesus walks up to them
[1:27:36] he says why are you so sad
[1:27:40] why are you so sad
[1:27:42] but what what manner of communications
[1:27:43] are these
[1:27:45] as you walk in her sad they thought he
[1:27:48] left
[1:27:50] their trust in the resurrection and the
[1:27:53] presence of Christ have been shaken
[1:27:56] listen to me Church
[1:27:59] oh God you realize what God did for us
[1:28:02] in this age
[1:28:04] he showed himself in the form of the son
[1:28:07] of man why did he do that
[1:28:09] why did he come in the son of man
[1:28:11] Ministry to show us a resurrection sign
[1:28:14] he says I'm alive
[1:28:18] so you can be cheerful
[1:28:21] are you with me now so I can be cheerful
[1:28:23] he says I'm alive I'm with you why are
[1:28:26] you so sad
[1:28:29] oh my God is there are you a stranger
[1:28:31] around here look look all that's
[1:28:33] happened
[1:28:34] they explained to him I'm skipping down
[1:28:36] here they explained to him all that had
[1:28:38] happened
[1:28:39] but look at verse 21 but we trusted
[1:28:42] we trusted past tense
[1:28:45] that it had been he which should have
[1:28:47] redeemed Israel
[1:28:49] and beside all this today is the third
[1:28:51] day since these things were done
[1:28:54] and the fact is that was the very day
[1:28:56] they should have been looking for it
[1:29:01] but it didn't happen the way they
[1:29:03] thought it would happen
[1:29:04] they said oh there's some people went
[1:29:06] down that the tomb was empty but we
[1:29:08] don't know what that means somebody
[1:29:09] probably stole him away yeah
[1:29:12] yeah I'll say this events signs without
[1:29:16] Revelation don't mean much
[1:29:19] the picture of the pillar of fire
[1:29:20] without a revelation of what it means
[1:29:21] doesn't mean much
[1:29:23] the picture of the cloud without a
[1:29:24] revelation of what it means doesn't mean
[1:29:26] much
[1:29:28] the open Tomb the empty tomb without a
[1:29:30] revelation of his presence didn't mean
[1:29:32] much
[1:29:34] their trust had been broken
[1:29:36] oh my
[1:29:38] he said unto them o fools and so of
[1:29:40] heart to believe all that the prophets
[1:29:42] have spoken
[1:29:44] and he began to he began to expound to
[1:29:46] them all through the prophet's hell that
[1:29:48] he was supposed to come and then he
[1:29:50] showed the sign of the Resurrection
[1:29:51] something he did before he was alive
[1:29:54] before he died to show that he was still
[1:29:56] living
[1:29:58] you see knowledge of his resurrection
[1:29:59] did not make them cheerful only when he
[1:30:01] revealed himself to them personally in
[1:30:04] the word
[1:30:05] and walk back to Jerusalem that night
[1:30:08] was way easier than the walk down to
[1:30:11] Emmaus had been
[1:30:13] Hallelujah sometimes the walk when we're
[1:30:15] walking we're hearing the word it's hard
[1:30:17] you're struggling in church even your
[1:30:19] kids are making noise or you're sitting
[1:30:21] there with a headache or you've got
[1:30:22] problems going on and the walk down is
[1:30:25] hard but if you can ever get the
[1:30:26] Revelation he's with you he's here then
[1:30:29] it changes things
[1:30:31] [Applause]
[1:30:35] verse 1 of John 16. Jesus Is Telling Me
[1:30:39] said I'm going to leave you
[1:30:41] yeah they said I'm speaking these things
[1:30:42] to you you should not be offended
[1:30:45] so they're going to persecute you
[1:30:46] they're going to put you out of the
[1:30:47] synagogues whoever kills you will think
[1:30:49] he does God of service
[1:30:52] these things they'll do it to you
[1:30:53] because they've not known the father nor
[1:30:54] me
[1:30:55] but these things have I told you when
[1:30:57] the time shall come you may remember
[1:30:58] that I told you of them
[1:31:00] and he said let them say this things at
[1:31:02] the beginning because I was with you but
[1:31:04] now I go my way to him that sent me and
[1:31:06] none of you asked me whether go a cell
[1:31:08] but because I've said these things unto
[1:31:10] you notice sorrow hath filled your heart
[1:31:16] nevertheless I tell you the truth
[1:31:18] it is
[1:31:29] okay
[1:31:45] foreign
[1:32:46] foreign
[1:33:28] [Music]
[1:33:40] behind their tears there would have been
[1:33:41] a cheerful to stare
[1:34:24] foreign
[1:34:35] [Applause]
[1:34:36] that he was doing that to forgive them
[1:34:39] of their sins if they'd have known that
[1:34:40] from this moment on his Spirit would
[1:34:42] come back and live with them if they'd
[1:34:44] have known that they would have been way
[1:34:46] more cheerful than what they were but
[1:34:48] they all ran away because they had
[1:34:49] sorrow in their hearts they didn't know
[1:34:52] the outcome but you know the outcome
[1:34:54] today you know why he went to the Cross
[1:34:56] you know why he went to the Grave you
[1:34:59] know why this message had to be
[1:35:00] persecuted you know why the
[1:35:02] denominations had to reject it there's
[1:35:04] an incoming
[1:35:05] if you can just see Pastor you'd be
[1:35:07] cheerful today we shall not all sleep
[1:35:10] but we shall all be changed in a moment
[1:35:11] in a twinkling of an eye
[1:35:13] [Applause]
[1:35:15] good Hallelujah
[1:35:20] he says
[1:35:21] I got a lot of things to tell you
[1:35:24] if you can't bear them now
[1:35:26] but when the spirit of truth comes
[1:35:29] he will guide you into all truth
[1:35:32] oh my
[1:35:33] that a way different attitude at
[1:35:34] Pentecost
[1:35:36] than what they had
[1:35:38] in the garden
[1:35:42] verse 16 says a little while you won't
[1:35:44] see me again a little while you'll see
[1:35:46] me because I go to the father
[1:35:48] and they didn't understand they said
[1:35:49] what's going on
[1:35:51] what is this that he says we can't tell
[1:35:53] what he's saying
[1:35:54] and Jesus knew they wanted to ask him
[1:35:56] about it and said to them do you inquire
[1:35:58] among yourselves what I said a little
[1:36:00] while you should not see me again a
[1:36:02] little while you shall see me
[1:36:03] verily verily I say unto you you shall
[1:36:05] weep and Lament
[1:36:06] but the world shall rejoice
[1:36:09] oh God
[1:36:11] Rejoice because he was hung to a cross
[1:36:13] Rejoice because they'd done away with
[1:36:15] him
[1:36:17] you should be sorrowful
[1:36:19] but your sorrow
[1:36:21] shall be turned into Joy
[1:36:23] what's gonna do it
[1:36:25] when they had got the revelation
[1:36:28] that he was alive
[1:36:33] this is going to be done for a moment
[1:36:35] and hear who can turn on the light
[1:36:37] I can't promise you that everything's
[1:36:39] going to be easy look at job he went
[1:36:41] through the hardest trial maybe that a
[1:36:43] man could go through lost all of his
[1:36:44] children lost his wife lost everything
[1:36:46] his his friends were all accused him of
[1:36:48] secret sin and he's sitting there on an
[1:36:50] ass sheep scraping his boils but what
[1:36:52] does God do for him God never does
[1:36:54] explain to him why he went through what
[1:36:56] he went through
[1:36:57] he never does tell him why what does he
[1:37:00] do he said he caused him to have a
[1:37:03] revelation and see a vision I know my
[1:37:06] redeemer lives at the last day he'll
[1:37:08] stand on the earth though the skin worms
[1:37:09] destroy this body yet in my flesh I
[1:37:12] shall see God
[1:37:13] he gave him a revelation of the
[1:37:15] Resurrection
[1:37:20] it's going to be dark for a minute
[1:37:22] there's a man here who can turn on the
[1:37:24] light he said a woman when she's in
[1:37:25] travail has sorrow
[1:37:27] because her hour has come but as soon as
[1:37:29] she is delivered to the child she
[1:37:31] remembers no more the anguish for joy
[1:37:34] that a man is Born Into the world
[1:37:36] and you now therefore have sorrow but I
[1:37:39] will see you again
[1:37:40] your heart shall rejoice your joy no man
[1:37:42] taketh from you
[1:37:43] and in that day you shall ask me nothing
[1:37:45] now what he's saying is you're not going
[1:37:46] to ask me you're going to ask the father
[1:37:48] in my name
[1:37:50] oh my in my name he said whatever you
[1:37:53] ask the father in my name he will give
[1:37:54] it to you
[1:37:56] see Jesus came in the father's name when
[1:37:59] we ask in the name of Jesus we're asking
[1:38:01] in the father's name
[1:38:03] well he said whatever you asking the
[1:38:05] father in my name he will give it to you
[1:38:07] hitherto have you asked nothing in my
[1:38:09] name ask and you shall receive
[1:38:13] that your joy might be full
[1:38:16] right and they said oh we understand now
[1:38:18] we got it all right we're going to be
[1:38:21] happy now he said
[1:38:22] do you believe now
[1:38:25] behold the hour comes
[1:38:28] yes now come that you should be
[1:38:29] scattered every man to his own and shall
[1:38:31] leave me alone
[1:38:33] yet I'm not alone because the father is
[1:38:35] with me
[1:38:36] can you imagine if he'd been Petty like
[1:38:38] some of us are they left me in my hour
[1:38:40] of need
[1:38:42] can't deal with them again
[1:38:45] he loved them more than anybody he just
[1:38:46] knew the limits of humanity
[1:38:49] that's right
[1:38:50] oh God
[1:38:51] it's good he recognized that they were
[1:38:53] human beings
[1:38:55] they couldn't handle it
[1:38:59] who am I
[1:39:01] but these things
[1:39:02] have I spoken unto you these things is
[1:39:05] that in me you might have peace
[1:39:07] in the world you shall have tribulation
[1:39:09] but be of good cheer I have overcome
[1:39:13] the world
[1:39:16] how could he die brother said while it
[1:39:18] was going along the road they were so
[1:39:19] discouraged Peter got his fishing pole
[1:39:21] put it on his back in a can of worms and
[1:39:23] started down to the Sea and said I just
[1:39:25] guess I'll go fishing
[1:39:27] cleopas and his friend said come on
[1:39:29] let's go on back to Jerusalem go back to
[1:39:31] our city where we come from to Emmaus I
[1:39:33] don't know I can't make it how could a
[1:39:34] person like that
[1:39:36] said today God's servants has
[1:39:37] misunderstood the same way he said the
[1:39:40] true gospel is misunderstood the same
[1:39:41] way even his disciples didn't understand
[1:39:43] him he talked to double talk they never
[1:39:46] could understand him because he talked
[1:39:47] to Heaven he talked to things they
[1:39:49] couldn't understand
[1:39:50] people still they don't understand what
[1:39:52] a prophet spoke
[1:39:54] because sometimes he was speaking as a
[1:39:56] prophet
[1:39:57] and they couldn't understand that's what
[1:39:58] brother Brandon means if I double talks
[1:39:59] it sometimes it was the man speaking
[1:40:01] sometimes it was God
[1:40:03] he said right at the last they said Lo
[1:40:05] now we believe and know that no man has
[1:40:07] to teach you for God shows you what to
[1:40:08] do and Jesus said do you now believe
[1:40:10] after all this time do you now believe
[1:40:12] but how could that Divine person see
[1:40:14] they'd failed to know the word of God so
[1:40:16] there was nothing to do but fulfill
[1:40:18] their desire to know
[1:40:21] I love that how can he make them
[1:40:23] cheerful yeah oh God he had to fulfill
[1:40:26] their desire to know it ought to make us
[1:40:28] happy when we come to the house of God
[1:40:30] because we have a desire to know is he
[1:40:32] still alive is he still the same
[1:40:34] yesterday today and forever and when we
[1:40:36] come together we are the proof of his
[1:40:38] resurrection
[1:40:40] and we look around at one another and we
[1:40:42] say yes sir sister Jackie she'd been
[1:40:44] through some things but she's a proof of
[1:40:46] his resurrection there's this mother
[1:40:47] Stewart she's been through some things
[1:40:49] but she's he's a proof of his
[1:40:50] resurrection
[1:40:51] what is it by coming together don't you
[1:40:53] see why hate and hates the Assembly of
[1:40:55] the Saints we're not just celebrating
[1:40:58] the resurrection of Christ we are the
[1:41:00] proof of the resurrection of Christ
[1:41:03] Hallelujah we are the proof of his
[1:41:06] resurrection we didn't drag ourselves to
[1:41:08] church we're here because God is inside
[1:41:10] of us
[1:41:11] he's living himself out through us
[1:41:14] we are the proof of his resurrection so
[1:41:16] when we come to the house of God he
[1:41:18] fulfills our desire to know
[1:41:23] Hallelujah
[1:41:25] Hallelujah
[1:41:28] he said they turned down the road
[1:41:29] walking along disheartened oh some women
[1:41:31] had been up to the Grave they said he
[1:41:32] wasn't there but they didn't believe
[1:41:33] that so they just went on down the road
[1:41:35] so discouraged
[1:41:38] and if you notice he said it's when
[1:41:39] you're discouraged that's when the devil
[1:41:40] can really pour it on you
[1:41:42] that's what he gets you if you come to
[1:41:44] the church and say well I don't know I
[1:41:46] don't know whether I'll get any better
[1:41:47] or not I've been prayed for twice so my
[1:41:49] you might as well go home that's all but
[1:41:52] when you can cast that aside God don't
[1:41:54] want you to be frowning God wants you to
[1:41:56] be happy the human heart was made to be
[1:41:58] happy worry will cause cancer temper
[1:42:00] will cause cancer don't never be upset
[1:42:02] just walk in his love
[1:42:04] knowing that you're walking in him and
[1:42:06] nothing can harm you there's nothing
[1:42:08] going to harm you there's neither Powers
[1:42:09] things present things future hey man
[1:42:12] we're in him nothing can separate us
[1:42:14] from him we're in him and we can never
[1:42:16] come in by our own will he by choice
[1:42:18] elected us and brought us into him
[1:42:20] so it's his business to take care of
[1:42:21] what he took himself
[1:42:23] no man conflict him from my father's
[1:42:25] hands because he's the greatest of all
[1:42:27] of them it's the father who takes care
[1:42:28] of it who's got any more power than God
[1:42:30] he said so what kind of a power have you
[1:42:32] got over you to take care of you what's
[1:42:34] watching over you today church it's the
[1:42:37] eagle
[1:42:38] who can fly higher than any other bird
[1:42:40] who can come faster to your hour of need
[1:42:42] than any other any other animal you
[1:42:46] know any other power of the air
[1:42:49] what kind of a power have you got over
[1:42:51] you to take care of you the whole power
[1:42:52] that created the universe took the solar
[1:42:54] system and blew like that every Star
[1:42:56] went to its place and he watches over
[1:42:59] you
[1:43:01] it's a kind of a father
[1:43:02] that we have
[1:43:06] I won't read all that I've got here
[1:43:07] because it's just a little bit in second
[1:43:10] Timothy you can go read it it's verses
[1:43:12] three second Timothy chapter one verses
[1:43:14] three through ten verses 3 through 12
[1:43:16] actually
[1:43:18] but he tells Timothy he says
[1:43:20] Timothy tended to be a little timid
[1:43:22] a little fearful lived under that cloud
[1:43:26] he said I I want you to stir up the gift
[1:43:28] of God to sing you
[1:43:30] God's not given us a spirit of fear
[1:43:33] but a power and of love and of a sound
[1:43:35] mind
[1:43:36] he said don't be ashamed of the
[1:43:37] testimony yeah
[1:43:39] yeah don't be ashamed it was hard in
[1:43:40] that day your best friends in prison
[1:43:43] the prophet you follow is in prison
[1:43:46] we get embarrassed sometimes because the
[1:43:48] prophet we follow gets gets degraded
[1:43:50] online
[1:43:51] people laugh and make fun and mock their
[1:43:54] prophet of that age was in prison yeah
[1:43:57] didn't even have two coats to wear
[1:44:00] he said but be a partaker of the
[1:44:02] afflictions don't be ashamed
[1:44:04] and that word ashamed is interesting it
[1:44:06] means to not be cheerful
[1:44:09] the opposite is cheerfulness
[1:44:12] oh my
[1:44:13] God don't be ashamed don't don't be
[1:44:15] Melancholy because I'm in jail don't be
[1:44:18] ashamed of me
[1:44:20] oh my
[1:44:21] he said he said I'd be a partaker of the
[1:44:24] Gospel
[1:44:25] he says because he saved us according to
[1:44:28] his own purpose and Grace
[1:44:30] he said and I'm appointed a preacher for
[1:44:31] that reason and verse 12 said for the
[1:44:34] witch cause I also suffer these things
[1:44:35] nevertheless I am not ashamed
[1:44:40] you go look at the root word in the
[1:44:42] Greek it's I am not unhappy
[1:44:45] I am not saddened
[1:44:48] I am not melancholy even though I'm in
[1:44:51] prison I'm not ashamed for I know whom I
[1:44:55] have believe in and I'm persuaded that
[1:44:58] he's able to keep what I've committed
[1:45:00] unto him against that day
[1:45:02] commit your way into the Lord trust in
[1:45:05] him
[1:45:06] he'll bring you out
[1:45:10] I found
[1:45:12] in the meetings that we had in Togo
[1:45:15] and I've always marveled at this
[1:45:18] I thought there was nothing you could do
[1:45:21] to make them less cheerful
[1:45:24] I've seen them pile up in buses and
[1:45:27] and
[1:45:27] wearing clothes that maybe we wouldn't
[1:45:31] wear it
[1:45:32] and eating food that we definitely
[1:45:34] wouldn't eat
[1:45:36] not have any restroom facilities and the
[1:45:38] people are happy
[1:45:40] you can tell they're happy you can you
[1:45:41] can see it in the audience
[1:45:43] they're happy because they smile
[1:45:46] they're happy most of their songs are
[1:45:49] joyful songs Happy songs
[1:45:52] and I'm so amazed by that always it just
[1:45:55] overwhelms me and and it makes me
[1:45:57] realize that it's not what you have that
[1:45:59] makes you happy
[1:46:00] it's not what you're going through that
[1:46:01] makes you happy or that makes you
[1:46:03] cheerful have that constant feeling of
[1:46:06] everything's okay
[1:46:09] it's not what you're going through but I
[1:46:11] found there was something
[1:46:12] that would dampen their Spirits a little
[1:46:14] bit you know what it is not being able
[1:46:16] to go to church
[1:46:20] Fritz got her hand up back there she
[1:46:22] knows a little bit what that's like
[1:46:25] yeah
[1:46:26] we need to pray for our elders yeah
[1:46:28] they're not always able to be here
[1:46:38] that's what made Iran happy made him
[1:46:40] unhappy
[1:46:41] is just the ability the lack of an
[1:46:44] ability yeah to go to church
[1:46:46] and when I went covet had been so strong
[1:46:49] in that country actually the disease
[1:46:50] hadn't been strong the fear of it yeah
[1:46:52] was so strong they wouldn't let them
[1:46:54] come together right and the government
[1:46:55] used that to come against them and the
[1:46:58] people were when I first started
[1:47:00] preaching to them they were not like
[1:47:01] they usually were
[1:47:03] but after a couple Services it began to
[1:47:05] break
[1:47:06] and the spirit of God began to move
[1:47:08] again and things began to be different
[1:47:10] and I noticed I told the young man that
[1:47:12] was with me I said it was different I
[1:47:14] told Brother John it was different he
[1:47:15] said well we haven't been able to meet
[1:47:16] together like this and the people are
[1:47:18] still afraid that the government will
[1:47:19] come in and beat them for coming
[1:47:20] together but when they realized they
[1:47:22] were going to be able to worship
[1:47:23] together all of a sudden the joy come
[1:47:25] out it just come out and they begin to
[1:47:27] shout and dance and worship and I began
[1:47:29] to realize it's not what you have it's
[1:47:31] being able to gather together and with
[1:47:33] the other members of the body and the
[1:47:35] resurrection that that brings in your
[1:47:37] heart
[1:47:39] yeah he's alive it proves to you he's
[1:47:42] alive
[1:47:43] I know some of you aren't always able to
[1:47:45] come but I'll say this you're with us in
[1:47:47] spirit you still know because there is a
[1:47:49] church on the earth this church we're
[1:47:51] not going to close where I refuse to
[1:47:53] close down and bow to an Orthodoxy that
[1:47:56] says you can't have church no more and
[1:47:58] it doesn't matter anymore I say we need
[1:48:00] to keep the church doors open because
[1:48:01] we're proving the devil wrong every time
[1:48:04] we come to the house of God and even
[1:48:06] those of you have to be at home and
[1:48:07] they're sick or whatever you know that
[1:48:09] until a church operating somewhere
[1:48:11] there's a body of Believers meeting he
[1:48:13] is alive
[1:48:16] the one thing that's been constant from
[1:48:17] the very beginning of the church was the
[1:48:19] people Gathering Together proving his
[1:48:21] resurrection
[1:48:24] how should we get a musicians go ahead
[1:48:26] and come
[1:48:28] brother Branham
[1:48:30] this really struck me
[1:48:31] at the end of the door inside the door
[1:48:33] he's preaching a hard sermon to him
[1:48:36] he said we offer to you the Adoration
[1:48:39] of our heart

[1:48:45] we lift our hearts

[1:49:33] every person that they may be filled
[1:49:35] with the goodness of God that the power
[1:49:37] of God might operate through everybody
[1:49:39] Every Soul that people ask
[1:49:42] he said May the people be on the streets
