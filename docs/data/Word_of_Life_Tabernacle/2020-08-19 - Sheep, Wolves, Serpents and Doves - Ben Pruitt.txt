see an age there's deception everywhere we're just we're desperate to know truth lord and to know where it is and we we want to hear your voice we're your sheep lord we want to hear the shepherd's voice i pray you'd grant it to us now keep us in your perfect will heal every sick person lord every every person that would have a need here tonight may you meet that need we pray in jesus name amen amen turn with me if you would to matthew chapter 10 and verse 16 i want to speak to you tonight on a subject of sheep wolves serpents and doves sheep wolves serpents and doves and you pray for me tonight i really need the help of the lord matthew chapter 10 and verse 16. i do believe this is important so if you don't get a chance maybe some don't even get a chance to stream tonight that they would go back and maybe watch this for our local church i believe it's important matthew chapter 10 and verse 16 behold i send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves be therefore wise as serpents and harmless as doves seems almost an impossibility doesn't it but he commanded us to do it pray the lord would add his blessing to the word and you may be seated jesus used four animals in one paragraph to identify the characteristics of his disciples as well as the world and to teach them how to handle themselves as believers in a world where we can't help most of the people we'll meet and that's hard because you know we want to help all the people that we meet but the truth is most people will never be helped and so jesus tells them he said i send you forth as sheep among the wolves the wolves are not going to want anything good for you and they're going to be out to get you and yet sometimes in this world that we live in especially in this age not only can we not help most of the people but we don't even know who we can help many times and he sends us forth as sheep among wolves but the wolves wear sheep's clothing and we aren't always sure who is who he tells us to be wise as serpents and harmless as doves i know that just by nature some folks tend to be more wise and and that is to be cautious and we'll get to the meaning of the word in a moment but some folks are more prone to be careful and others are more prone to be harmless and or innocent and and welcoming and the difficult thing is to be both especially if you've been hurt a few times to be harmless after you've been hurt is hard it's hard not to be cynical and it's also hard to be wise when you want the best for people and and you want the right things you want people to be saved and if we didn't have that kind of an attitude we might as well back up and go home if we didn't want people to be saved but people have to want to be saved but we take that and i take that personally i i don't want to see a person that i've ever preached to in my life be lost but i realize that we're sheep among wolves and not everybody's going to be saved and the majority of the people that we meet in the world are not going to be but oh how i would want them to be i wouldn't want one to be lost i don't want to be cynical i don't want to get hurt to the point where i can't believe in people god help me to be harmless but yet he said to be wise and you know just in the natural men tend to be more wise in that sense to be more cautious and when it comes to and more discerning in in the ability to see whether someone is sincere or not but women tend to be more open and and welcoming and god made them that way there's nothing wrong with a woman being that way it's the way a woman is and god made him when he separated eve from adam he separated out the feminist spirit and so he separated out that part that the good part we could say the part that's likable and and loving and all of this and and left us with the burly part and the ugly part and and you know and and there's part of a man that you and god set it up that way and then when the woman fell in the garden then and adam fell as well adam fell his sin was greater in one way because he knew what he was doing but eve fell by being deceived and so because she was deceived paul tells us that she can't lead the church you can't take authority over a man because a woman can be gullible and yet i've known men who were gullible and women who were cynical based on what they've been through and we're sheep we're not made for combat or aggression that's not what we do and yet we're soldiers in the army of the lord i realize that but but sheep are innocent animals they're harmless that's what their sheep are harmless and and they'll be at a disadvantage in any confrontation with a wolf and you have to remember that in any confrontation with a wolf a sheep will be at a disadvantage because they will not think that the wolf is going to be what the wolf is or do what the wolf does they won't presume that about somebody and so the only way for a sheep to have the advantage over a wolf is to stay in the fold and have complete trust in the shepherd sheep are also helpless they're helpless without a shepherd and they have to learn to listen to his voice brother bruce and learn to hear that still small voice and recognize and discern between the shepherd and a hireling they have to learn to do that and it's hard because there's so many voices in the world today sheep social creatures they want to be together when it's hot they huddle together for shade and guess what they do when it gets cold they huddle together for warmth and so sheep want to be together they want to be in the house of god they want to be with other christians and they're content as long as they can see the shepherd and know that he's there and well joe and i talked today about how you want to feel that presence of god you want you just want to know that he's there you know that's not what you base your faith on but but you still want to feel that you still want to know that and and so we're sheep we're content we want to see the shepherd we want to see one another we want to be able to look one another in the eye and and fellowship one with another and so he identifies the world he said it sends you out as sheep among wolves and he identifies the wolves as being uh and the characteristics of a wolf would be someone who's self-led and so woes run together in a pack like sheep or in a bunch or group or a flock but one of their own is their leader and i read a quote to you not long ago or brother branham said that sheep can't lead sheep but goat can lead them to the slaughter the sheep don't lead sheep and and so sheep submit themselves to an appointed shepherd but wolves fight it out among themselves to see who the most dominant wolf will be and it's the characteristics of a wolf and we see it with competition among ministries and things it's not right because it becomes a wolf mentality who can get to the top we're not interested in getting to the top we're interested in getting to the truth and getting to heaven wolves are very deceptive woes are not above using deceptive means to accomplish their goal they even try to appear as sheep and sheep's clothing and patiently waiting for a moment when the sheep are alone to make their move they'll wait for a long time to take out a sheep those are ultimately takers all they do is take they take from the flock they take from the herd they constantly take for their own good but sheep are givers sheep bare wool sheep lay down allow themselves to be sheared how could a wolf and a sheep ever come together in a confrontation the wolf would just tear him to pieces and so don't be discouraged if you find yourself at times deceived by wolves and at times in trouble because of woes don't be discouraged by that because it's just the world we live in but also we can be wise he says because you're sheep going among wolves this is how you need to act be wise as a serpent harmless as a dove but you know it's important to know as we go through this that you are among wolves when ronald reagan began dealing with the soviets on nuclear weapons he used an old russian proverb that says trust but verify trust but verify it's hard to do both in fact in modern diplomacy they've kind of rejected that because they said it's impossible to do both when it comes to dealing with iran they said verify and verify because how do you trust them but trust verifies what he did he said okay i trust you i'm just going to make sure that you really are stopping making those weapons because he knew he was among wolves he knew if they could they would lie to him right and that's the kind of wisdom and again you have to be careful that it doesn't go over into cynicism but you have to realize that people human beings tell lies and human beings often don't tell the truth and you've got to verify your own flesh will lie to you it will it tells you you can't go to church when you could your flesh lies to you it tells you how sick you are and how you're not a child of god and your own mind will lie to you and you have to you have to be able to overcome that verify check it with the word see if it's true and so paul gets this to us in first corinthians 14 and 20 said brethren be not children and understanding albeit in malice be children but an understanding be men know what you're dealing with you're going to be eating the life we've got to understand what age we live in in romans 16 and 17 he said now i beseech you brethren mark them which cause divisions and offenses contrary to the doctrine which you have learned and avoid them for they that are such serve not our lord jesus christ but their own belly or their own appetites by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple for your obedience has come abroad unto all men he said i'm glad therefore on your behalf but yet i would have you wise unto that which is good and simple concerning evil he's saying the same thing be wise as serpents harmless as doves and jesus tells us to be like serpents in only one very specific way because a serpent is a very bad animal it's a type of evil but he says be like them in one way now you'll never be as good a serpent as the serpent you can't out serpent the serpent and jesus puts it this way he says the children of of this world and their generation are wiser than the children of light and so they're always going to be better at it but yet we do have to use our brains right and understand that we can't just deal in an emotional realm where we're going on what emotion is but we have to be able to look at the word and just see what what the fruits of something are and so and there's a this word wise when he says to be wise as a serpent is to be thoughtful discreet cautious and it indicates intelligence in a bad sense it means conceited let's turn to matthew chapter 7 and verse 15 and i'm just going to take a lot of scripture tonight and i hope you can bear with me but we should be able to read the scripture and believe it shouldn't we if we can read the scripture and see exactly what he says and so he says beware of false prophets which come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly are ravening wolves they're not just wolves they're hungry wolves huh so he said beware of false prophets they're they're hungry wolves he said you shall know them by their fruits and brother branham and one place says that's their teaching he also identifies it as as their manner of life if you think about it as a preacher it would be your teaching it would also be your life as an individual more often than not it would be your life your fruits how you live according to your life line with the word brother branham says that in relation to this he said do men gather graves of thorns or figs of thistles he said even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit he said every tree that bringeth forth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire wherefore by their fruits you shall know them and this is the manifesting time this is the time for the fruits to come out what people really are is coming out now because the influence of laodicea is so strong on the world that it's going to push those fruits out they're getting if you could say it this way they're getting worldly vitamins if you have a tendency to sin before you're really going to do it now because it's easier than it's ever been those vitamins are pushing out in the world it's causing them to prepare them for the satan's eating that's that's easy to sin in but i'm so thankful at the same time we have a word it was sent to in our hour that we can we can overcome those things and so in the hour that they're manifesting the false we can manifest the true if we feed on the truth if we believe the truth if if there's something there that can be bear fruit now i'll stop here and we'll come back to matthew chapter 7 because there's much more in this chapter that we want to put with that but brother branham says this and things that are to be said remember the bible said in the last days there shall come false christs not false jesus they wouldn't stand still for that but false christs false anointed ones they're absolutely anointed with the holy spirit and still false he said there's three people of you the outside is the body you've got five senses that you contact your earthly home with that the inside is a spirit there's five senses there love and conscience and so forth you contact but the inside of that is the soul he said and remember the rain falls on the just and the unjust the same rain that will make a grain of wheat grow makes the cuckleberg grow too what is it that the inside of that seed is in nature and listen and that nature displays itself and and you know i believe it was james put it this way if a man says he loves god and hates his brother how do you believe him right because his nature displays himself man says i love god won't go to church won't live for god won't do what's right just refuses to do it what are you supposed to believe right you're supposed to believe the fruits of it and so and if you just bear with me tonight i'm trying to to say this in a way that we'll understand but the same rain that'll make a grain of wheat grow makes the cuckerborg grow too he said at the inside of that scene as the nature and the nature displays itself it can stand in the same field right there with the weed the weed and the wheat stand together rejoice just as much its head is down it's starving for a drink when rain comes the cockleberry can shout just as loud as the weekend but by their fruits you shall know them so you don't judge anything before the time good or bad right when the rain comes don't judge that based on the rain but judge it based on what happens after the service let's go back to matthew chapter 7 and verse 21 he says not everyone that saith unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven and this is that same chapter just continuing he said many will say to me in that day lord lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils in thy name done many wonderful works then while i profess unto them i never knew you depart from me that work iniquity notice what he says you that work iniquity therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine now watch it just continues on down he said whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them i will liken him unto a wise man and that word for wise is the same word that's used when he says be wise as serpents so he said i'm gonna i'm gonna tell you a parable about a man who's cautious and prepares himself for the storm and the man that hears the things i'm saying about there being wheat and tares about there being false prophets on the earth and many that will say have not done these things the man that hears these sayings of mine and doeth them he said i will liken him unto a wise man which built his house upon a rock is not where you want your house to be built tonight he built his house upon a rock and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell not for it was founded yeah it's got this foundation on a rock he said and everyone that heareth these things they'll notice they both hear but one doesn't do anything about it everyone that heareth these sayings of mine who doeth them not should be likened unto a foolish man which built his house upon the sand and said oh it'll be okay and notice what happens to him the exact same thing that happened to the wise man happens to the foolish man life happens he's the sheep among wolves and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell and great was the fall of it it didn't just fall it disintegrated well it was built wrong to start with and the man who built it wasn't wise that's the same word the same word is also used in matthew 25 we won't go there to save time but you can look it up later it's the wise and foolish virgins the wise had oil in their vessels with their lamps they were cautious they took care to make sure that they were they were wise they knew they needed the holy ghost in order to overcome this deception in this age look they carried oil and i would say to us we need to be wise like that we'll talk some more about that but does who tells us be like serpents and doves those are interesting because he says be harmless that word is innocent or simple it literally means unmixed don't have any guile that's hard because every time you come across a situation you mix it with things you've been through in the past and this is difficult for us and i know especially in this area if there ever was people that had a right to be have a little guile when it comes to ministry it would be us or people in this area anyway and some of us have been around the message long enough that we've seen everything and so you tend to have a little bit of a guile you can have a little bit of of you you step back and that's good to a point but you also have to be simple innocent harmless and that's what's hard for me you know if you can't tell i'm preaching at myself tonight really hard i'm trying to keep my spirit right too so you all pray with me see when you're when you're dealing with people as opposed to dealing with god because we know who god is and what god will do you don't have to have any guile no you don't have to have any uh wise with god you don't deal with god wise as a serpent he didn't tell you to be wise as a serpent dealing with god or dealing in the scriptures he said be wise as a serpent because among the wolves right because the worlds are out to get you so when dealing with people you always assume the best but be prepared for the worst you must be cautious always have a house that would withstand the storm but on the other hand don't assume that every wind is that kind of storm or you'll live your life in your storm shelter i remember my dad he uh he didn't like storms and so every time a little storm went up we went to the cellar and our cellar was 50 feet from the house and it was it had no elect had one light bulb in it and it leaked when it rained and it was scary and it had spiders in it and it was an old root cellar and so we would all run down there whenever it would storm and frankly i got sick of it and so when i got married and now my wife can hardly get me out of bed when there's a storm i don't remember we had a basement in pigott i don't think maybe one time i can remember in the entire time that we lived there i ever went in that basement because of a storm because i just it just don't bother me like it did my dad but my dad was afraid in every little kind of wind maybe he had been through that i think he had been through a tornado when he was younger and so every little wind was that kind of storm and you've got to remember that it's not that way it won't always be this hard and you can't treat future relationships like that you can't go into them with that kind because you get what you expect and so you just because every other thing that's happened around you has fallen you've got to move on and still believe in somebody you can't get any help from anybody you can't help anybody so that's being harmless as a doe always assume the best be prepared for the worst we have to be cautious but don't let your caution cause you to be cold and indifferent i lack love i'm preaching it myself because i i've been down the road a few times and i've dealt with people and i've dealt and i'm dealing now with people even in my family and he may be listening tonight but you know i've dealt with people who always always tell you the best but after a while you get really jaded because you watch their life and you think is are they ever going to is it ever going to be any different and yet i have to keep that ability to reach out and understand at the same time that i can't let it come in and and be a harm to my family or to my church so that there's a line that you've got to walk and it's hard you've got to be cautious and it may seem impossible to be cautious and not be cold but wisdom and prudence actually enables us to be innocent and harmless that if we'll set the right boundaries and do things in the right way and require something of people if we do that then we actually set up a place where we can be secure you know you have locks on your doors at home most of you do we didn't have a lot growing up our old farmhouse we never had a key to it but now we have locks on our doors we wouldn't think of leaving our house unlocked and so it's always locked up what's the lock for well you know if a thief really wants to get in he's going to get in i went to a cyber security conference one time and and the instructor was telling us locks are to keep honest people honest they're not really for thieves and they were telling us in cyber security that they're always the criminals are always a step ahead they're always the ones that are winning the the battle as far as technology and the law's always trying to catch up but they make these locks and all these codes and everything to keep the people that are honest honest to make sure that you don't just give an opportunity for somebody to be tempted to steal some money right and so wisdom and prudence actually enables you to be at ease in your home because you've taken the proper steps to make sure that the boogeyman can't get in so you can sit there and in a little bit more caution you know you you sit at home maybe in your easy chair and you hear something outside but you've got your security lights you've got your cameras or you've got your locks you know you lock the house and you know that everything's done you can be at ease i watched a documentary here not long ago on the london tower and the tower of london and every night for the last 800 years there's been a ceremony that's called the keep ceremony of the keys and they take these keys and and a man walks up a guard walks up and takes the keys to the tower of london and presents them to uh the head guard and he says everything's locked up and whatever that they do and they go through this ceremony it's been happening for 800 years the reason is because 800 years ago a king came home that was a palace then and found his castle unlocked and of course after some people lost their heads he mandated and nothing bad happened but he said hey if the castle's unlocked look what could take place i want to be able to sit there and be my be a king in my lazy boy because i know the house is locked right and so being wise as a serpent actually causes you to be harmless as a dove if you do it in the right way the principle works in relationships as well i worked some a few years ago with a young lady who was an attorney almost my age but she had done a lot better in life obviously and had her law degree actually she worked in the next office from me i worked in one office she worked across the parking lot one year both of us had to get continuing education credits and we had to go to columbia missouri to do it and of course our bosses just assumed we would ride together locks keep honest people honest they were leaving on a sunday about six o'clock and i for some reason my boss he's a good man he was a good man but and church going man he just didn't understand why he had to pay two people to drive up there and i had to come up with something well i preach on sunday nights they were leaving about six o'clock and our service started at four i called made sure that i was preaching that night and then you know i'm not a long-winded preacher not usually maybe tonight but not usually no i won't hold you along tonight but you know i'm not usually but that night i was a little bit because i wanted to be able to honestly say that i left after six o'clock and i probably she probably beat me to the class or wherever we were going by five minutes but i didn't ride with her not because i'm scared of what i might do but because i want my marriage built on a rock where my family understands and knows that they can have the confidence that that these things are these things are everything is proper i want to be clear about this we have no business running around the country with and spending hours alone with someone of the opposite sex that we're not married to no business at all if we're not married to them we need to observe the same thing that we would want our kids to observe no matter how old we are you know billy graham had a rule and president pence was made fun of for following it but this is the billy graham rule and again locks keep honest people honest not that we would do anything wrong but we want to do everything right and i'm telling you a hundred times out of a hundred it'll lead to trouble and you may be the the one person in a million that wouldn't but a hundred times out of a hundred it's still going to lead to trouble and you set a wrong example and so the billy graham rule is we pledged among ourselves to avoid any situation that would have even the appearance of compromise or suspicion and they did this in 1948 he said from that day on i did not travel meet or eat alone with a woman other than my wife we determined that the apostle paul's mandate to the young pastor timothy would be ours as well flee youthful lust and nobody has to wonder brother branham talked about a a minister and you just forgive me i know most of you this is not a problem but but i have to deal with it a minister come here from a foreign country and he saw him riding around in a car with the lady and he went and inquired and they said he'd been several days and this woman brother branham knew that she'd been married three or four times brother adam asked if he could speak with him and took him to the room and he said to the minister he said you're a stranger in this land but this lady has quite a name and this man was going to straighten brother branham out on his doctrine he said you know this woman is different she's a saint but brother brown said everybody that looks at her is not a saint and he said i believe you better be careful and he said i know but he said you know i'm going to straighten you out a little bit he said i had this this dream he called it a vision and he saw in this dream his wife living with another man running around coming back and saying i'm sorry he said then he realized the interpretation of it was that woman and she could marry all the time she wanted to because the lord loved her so much and brother branham says this and i just got this part of the quote just so we could hurry along tonight but he said your vision was mighty sweet but it was way off the beaten path i said that's wrong you shouldn't do that and i think brother branham was being harmless when he said that by the way he didn't accuse him of anything he just said it's wrong to look like that galatians 5 13 says for brethren you've been called unto liberty use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh what's an occasion it's uh and it said but by love serve one another an occasion is a place from which a movement or attack is made don't give the devil a beach to land on that's what they realized in in different places around the world in world war ii when they did amphibious landings that you had to protect the beach because if they ever got a beach hold then they would keep driving they wouldn't stop and if the devil ever gets a hold on something in your life he's going to keep increasing it he's not going to just stop there don't let liberty be an occasion to the flesh but serve one another by love and so it's actually the standard that we keep that allows us not to be cynical with one another huh where we could actually have the freedom that we should have in our services because we know we're not partaking in these things and we should trust people who we don't know there's no reason to go around spreading stories on people or listening to gossip that's wrong but that's part of being harmless so first thessalonians 5 19-20 i told you i had a lot of scripture paul says quench not the spirit that's being harmless and so if someone if the spirit of god is moving don't quench it don't assume that it's wrong god's doing something assume that it's right but he says despise not prophesying so someone prophesies don't assume it's wrong but prove all things and don't hold to that that's wrong but hold fast to that which is good so something supernatural happens you you accept it but you don't just you don't just give up all of your wisdom in that but you prove it and you hold fast to the part that's good so he says abstain from all appearance of evil brother branham uses the term shun the appearance of evil and he uses the illustration you can go find it in the message of a car coming at you he said if you see it coming you you go this way and that way and you swerve around because you do anything you can to get out of the way because you see it coming and so he says when you see up evil coming you see the appearance of evil shine it abstain from it let's look at jude 1 20. see we want to be able to help people and i'm sorry i know i i feel terrible even myself because i don't always i don't always keep this line just like i should and i feel bad because i feel like you know those of you that are here the faithful few i don't want to beat you over the head i never do that we need to be right with god jude the book of jude chapter one there's only one one chapter verse 20. it says but you beloved i believe that's us tonight we're the beloved of god building up yourselves on your most holy faith praying in the holy ghost keep yourselves in the love of god what is that that's that that harmlessness keep yourselves in the love of god don't get cynical don't let the things that happen in your life get you to a place where you can't love people looking for mercy looking for the mercy this should be our outlook looking for the mercy of our lord jesus christ unto eternal life we should look for mercy in ourselves we should look for mercy in others we we should always do that why would i ever want to make someone's road harder and let me tell you something every time you repeat gossip you make someone's road harder even if it's true if you want to know about something talk to somebody who knows not to somebody who just heard he said then some have compassion making a difference that's what i want to be able to do i want to have compassion on those that i can have compassion on those who will accept compassion but he said others save with fear and he's not saying use fear to save them it's never right to beat the people over the head with fear it's not what he's saying but he says save with fear not fear for not give them fear but fear yourself save with fear pulling them out of the fire hating even the garments spotted by the flesh he uses the illusion of leprosy treat it like you would a leprosy a case of leprosy that you don't want to be spotted by it so you pull them from the fire but you have to be sure that you're not contaminated by the garment i knew a man a wesleyan preacher and i've always wondered what happened to him because he thought it was his job every day at three o'clock to go up to the bar and sit there and drink a coke and witness to people he was a young man unmarried there's no way that ended well i don't say that to be harsh but there's just no way because some you have compassion but you don't go to the bar some have compassion making a difference but but others save with fear if you've got a problem with that don't don't hang out around it pull them out of the fire demand something of them make them show some fruits of repentance many people come to to john and there at the river and wanted to be baptized and he just baptized him but here comes some pharisees he said hey bring me some fruits brother branham says in adoption he says what does it do he said he abounds the sunlight upon his children walking in the spirit led of the spirit of god abounding in his grace with all prudence and wisdom understanding he says and shrewdness to know how to walk god give us that tonight he said you see it's it's wrong he said if you see us wrong then be careful what you do that includes going around telling everybody about it be careful what you do how you if it's wrong be careful even how you approach it be careful you'll be caught in the same thing prudent be real close real sure that you know how to approach it he said like the indian that looks 10 times and walks takes one step he wants to make sure he knows where he's at what ground he stands on he said if it's wrong be careful even how you approach it prudent be real close real sure that you know how to approach it if you don't know leave it up to somebody who does wise as a serpent harmless as a dove that's what jesus said paul sums it up better than i could in ephesians 5. let's just go there i want to read the first 17 verses and i won't comment much we'll we'll get done with this ephesians 5 and 1 be therefore followers of god as dear children that's harmless be harmless as does be children walk in love that's where we have to walk whether we're hurt or not we have to walk in love it's hard we have to walk in love as christ also hath loved us remember that we were loved so we walk in love have given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to god for a sweet smelling savor he says but fornication and all uncleanness or covetousness let it not be once named among you if i could i would do it by pleading i would do it by begging if i could i'd do it by by scolding and by warning that it would not be named once among us let it not be once once named among you as become a saints neither filthiness nor foolish talking or jesting and i've always had a little problem with this because i like to joke but that's not what paul's talking about if you go look at that it's not just joking but it's your subject matter dirty jokes no foolish talking that's gossip talking about things you don't know about foolish talking no jesting dirty jokes filthiness which are not convenient but rather giving of things that that word gesting is actually a double entendre it's something that maybe is innocent in itself but it sounds bad you know in a lot of these comedies these these uh romantic comedies today these pg-13 comedies have are full of that paul says don't do that he said but rather giving of thanks for this you know that no whoremonger nor unclean person nor covetous man who is an idolater have any inheritance in the kingdom of christ and of god now there will be people who were that but they have to change he said let no man deceive you with vain words because they can tell you it's okay it's not okay and the world can tell you they can preach in hollywood and they can preach in the movie he said it's all right but it's never all right if it was ever wrong it's still wrong that no man deceives you with vain words for because of these things cometh the wrath of god upon the children of disobedience he said be nazi therefore partakers with them you were sometimes darkness you were like that but now are you light in the lord walk as children of light there is a responsibility and i recognize the blood of jesus christ cleanses us from all sin that's the only thing we have to stand on is not on our merits but we have to walk as children of light if you take out the part that tells you how to live you take out most of the new testament even though the new covenant is the blood covenant the covenant of justification but he tells us how to walk as children of light verse nine for the fruit of the spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth that's what i want in my life isn't that what you want proving what is acceptable proving how by your life what is acceptable unto the lord and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness but rather reprove them it ought to be that they wouldn't be comfortable it ought to be that way and if you've repented and you've been forgiven you should be comfortable knowing that god forgive you but if you're a sinner and you continue in sin you ought to be so uncomfortable in the house of god you can't sit there you ought to be so uncomfortable in my home you couldn't sit there or in your home because it's a place that's been dedicated to god and i've had people and i've got i know people who are uncomfortable even coming in my house but because they know how we live and they know when church time comes we're going to go to church and and there's certain things that we're going to do and and so they know that and they're just uncomfortable don't feel bad about that if you've got maybe family members that are like that but there's a place remember if they ever want god there's a place they can come back to where god is it's been consecrated to god let's keep our homes that way let's keep this church that way he says for it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret if it's a shame to speak of it why why do we gossip about it you forgive me i'm not preaching just at you if i ever had a with a razor's edge from getting in the flesh it's tonight but i apologize to you i not for what i've preached i believe it's the word but i want my attitude to be right and that's all i can do i'm human i want my attitude to be right and whatever everybody else does they can do but it's not right it's not right to talk about those things that are done of them in secret but all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light that's the word for whatsoever doth make manifest his light wherefore he saith awake thou that sleepest and arise from the dead and christ shall give thee light see then that you walk circumspectly that's somebody who walks and knows where he's going and knows how he walks be careful how you walk because it matters it matters to people it matters to families not as fools but as wise wise be cautious know what you're getting into redeeming the time because the days are evil wherefore being not unwise but understanding what the will of the lord is that's what i want i want to know what his will is i trust that you do as well you see when you when you live in sin you the will of god is obscured you think god blesses you in that sin he does not bless you it's you walk as a fool he may let you continue you may have more worldly things but you you're walking like a fool because the days are evil don't be unwise understand what the will of the lord is i read in 2019 in political magazine a strange headline that said i went back and copied the headline said israel accused of planting mysterious spy devices near the white house and my first thought was we're their biggest ally why are they spying on us because locks keep honest people honest and see the jews know something and i watched today they they went to germany today and and did a flyover of the of the concentration camp one of the concentration camps there and with the german air force who was once their enemy they did a flyover and they got up and they they told all these great words about how they're going to work together and cooperate but you can guarantee there's israeli spies in germany why because they've been through enough and i remember reading that when auschwitz was liberated before they were liberated that there become a cry among the survivors who knew that the end was coming and the cry was this never again at some point if we've been through something in our lives and i know something many of you have and this church has that i have but you've been through something in your family whatever that it is and you realize you don't want to do that yourself you you don't want to you don't want that to happen in your church again you and so what what they did is they they built themselves a nation and an army and even got nuclear weapons and put spies all over the world why because never again they said we won't be slaughtered unsuspecting if we're killed we'll be killed in war fighting the enemy the truth is we can never be wolves we'll never be that good at it we'll never be snakes we're sheep does sheep who have a dove nature within us but we can be wise and harmless at the same time with a will and this is my desired church if i haven't heard anything else that i've said tonight and i know it's just a few of us but we we need so much to know god and to know what he wants us to do i need his leadership in in my life right now and you need his leadership as well that you can be wise and harmless at the same time and and i have this this desire in me i want to keep open the doors of mercy so much so that if i have to stand there in that door and and keep it from closing if i could i would and noah was like that if he could stand there in the door but god shut the door we want mercy but the same time we've got to protect our homes we've got to lock the doors never again we need to put up with what we've been through what satan has if satan has deceived you or or caused trouble maybe it wasn't you but caused you trouble like that you don't have to happen again be wise as a serpent harmless is a dove but you know what i'm going to a place with no wolves i got thinking about this brother david today and i spent i spent the last eight hours back here in my office and just sitting there and and thinking about these things and i thought you know we're going to a place where everyone we meet is genuine and there'll be no tears we can take everything at face value but until we get there we we've got to lock some doors make sure that if it's just three of us if it's just five of just 10 of us whatever it is we want to make sure we're doing what god wants us to do because number one we want to make it there and we want to bring as many as we can with us but but you you can't make somebody the holy spirit will never force someone to be right you want them to be right but you've got to lock the doors i'm glad that that place will be a place with the woods because i'm tired of trying to act like a serpent don't come naturally and it shouldn't doesn't come naturally to keep your guard up and it shouldn't but we have to do it be wise as serpents harmless this does you bow your heads with me musicians come i know it was an odd service but you just pray for me and pray with me maybe if you watch this later those of you that aren't here tonight i i'd say that we need to get the message i know it wasn't delivered maybe in the best way but we need to hear this we need to know that there is a way that we have to act brother branham you go listen to the end of when brother branham is preaching about a life worthy of the gospel go listen to the end of that brother brahman talks about how we should live in such a way that someone who didn't even agree with us or anything else could say there's a christian there's a christian or let me live like that let me live like that in church we need a revival in our own hearts we need god to move and i don't want to affect you by my emotion tonight but i want you to know we need god to move but you know what he promised he would move when it gets the darkest and it's the hardest he said that's the hour and i found in my own ministry limited as as it has been up to this point but in the last few years when it's the hardest that's when god moves and i believe he's moving tonight i believe he's still here with us and he's still going to keep moving he's moving for your families he's he's working in your families but would you just would you just let him in and lock the doors to every with everything else tonight i'm going to make sure that my what i do and the way i act around people and when i'm around the world i want to make sure my doors are locked i don't want to be deceived i don't want to be right and i want others to be right i don't want to be cynical i don't want to be in a place where nobody could do anything right in my eyes and end up by myself without a church to go to because nobody can preach and nobody can anything i don't want to live like that somewhere god's got a preacher who can live the truth live what he preaches sometimes god's got a young man an old man somewhere god's got a young woman an old woman a married couple that can preach the truth or live the truth preach it with their lives i want that to be me i want that to be me would you just join me tonight in prayer and just just in your own way talk to god say lord lord you help me tonight i want to make sure that i'm walking in the right way i want to be wise as a serpent harmless as a dove heavenly father lord jesus i don't want to be cynical i want to be honest lord we live in an age of production when everything's produced for a video everything's produced for facebook everything's filtered i don't want my life to have a layer to see and filter on it i don't want to just try to look like the world or act like the world i want you to be moving in my life lord oh god forgive us forgive me lord lord if there if there would ever be a may there never be a thought in my own family lord god i have to see my wife and my children here i know how hard it is to be i was in a minister's home i know how hard it is to do that go back and never give them a reason to not trust me i never give these people a reason to not trust me lord help us to be wise lord and even when i preach god may we not just take it at face value but take it back to the word see if it's true be like the brilliance when when any man preaches no matter how emotional he is or what he says take it back to the word see if it's right most of all we need your holy spirit in our lives we need you god to just move and in a supernatural way help us lord help us to maintain our testimony help us to keep working keep doing keep keep digging the well keep killing the soil lord because we know you're coming lord and i see everything manifesting all around us it's manifesting time lord if this is that hour it may be hard but god let me be a manifestation of your light to the world manifestation of the true seed i don't want even a bit of mixture in it lord i want to be honest i want to be harmless i want to be ready when you come granted father i pray for each one of us lord i believe you're working in our midst i believe that you're still the same yesterday today and forever there

this church that that has ever went to this church lord that they would be they would be there on that day but i realized lord that it may not be that way but that's our desire god help us to be wise as serpents harmless as does do we get to a place where there are no wolves no wolves in sheep sheep's clothing we get to the end of the road that we can put down our sword put down their shield just be the lambs that we are pray you'd grant it lord thank you for all you do for us thank you for healing lord thank you for grace thank you for mercy how we need it god how we need it we need it more
