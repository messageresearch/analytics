[28:32] Lord to us Lord what would we do without

[28:47] Lord to save those that were yours we're
[28:49] so thankful for that I pray God you'd
[28:51] help us to remember Lord who you are
[28:54] what you've done for us who we are Lord
[28:57] and that we would be just so wrapped up
[28:59] in that we wouldn't have time for
[29:00] anything the devil would try to put into
[29:02] our minds and our hearts but you grant
[29:05] it Lord we thank you for all that you've

[29:11] deliverance Lord whatever is needed God
[29:13] I pray that You' do it tonight we thank
[29:16] you for this time to come together we
[29:18] ask in jesus' name amen amen God bless
[29:23] you God bless you uh guess this working
[29:26] now isn't it all right
[29:28] amen it's good to be in the house of the
[29:29] Lord this morning this
[29:33] evening I usually preaching in the
[29:35] morning 1 Corinthians chapter 10 and
[29:37] verse 16 I want to take something on
[29:41] communion tonight I know I do this often
[29:43] but it's just it's important and I want
[29:47] to deal with this tonight the value of
[29:51] it the value of
[29:52] communion 1 Corinthians 10:16 the cup of
[29:55] blessing which we bless is it not the
[29:58] communion of the blood of
[30:00] Christ the bread which we break is it
[30:03] not the communion of the body of Christ
[30:07] for we being many are one
[30:11] bread and one body someone say it with
[30:15] me tonight one body for we are all
[30:19] partakers of that one bread so when when
[30:23] you come tonight we won't take
[30:25] prepackaged bread that's already broken
[30:29] but we come they make one piece of
[30:32] bread and then they we break it and it's
[30:36] broken but it's all part of the same
[30:38] bread we are all a part of the body of
[30:41] Christ around the world Amen God bless
[30:44] you you may be
[30:47] seated our communion service is special
[30:49] not to be
[30:51] special I know that I have communion
[30:54] more often we have communion as a church
[30:55] more often than some other places and
[30:58] and I pastors do it for different
[31:00] reasons for their own congregations so I
[31:02] respect that but I wanted to kind of
[31:04] explain to you why we do it is because
[31:06] we believe it's valuable to the church
[31:10] to have a communion service and to have
[31:12] it on a regular basis listen if you took
[31:15] communion every other month which is
[31:16] what our schedule is for 20 years you'd
[31:19] only be taking it 120 times if I got my
[31:22] math right in 20 years most people take
[31:26] it far less than than that I've known
[31:29] people who come to the Lord and were
[31:33] actually were actually in church for a
[31:35] little while and then passed away and
[31:38] we've all maybe had friends relatives
[31:40] people like that you probably think of
[31:42] somebody who's come to the Lord and
[31:44] they're in church for a while and they
[31:45] pass away and but none of us have a
[31:48] guarantee of tomorrow and so we want to
[31:50] give people an opportunity during their
[31:52] lifetime because life is but a vapor it
[31:55] appears for a little while and then it
[31:56] vanishes away
[31:58] but it's not just because we want to
[32:00] give you an opportunity to do it but
[32:02] because we believe that the the the
[32:04] communion service itself is valuable and
[32:07] should not be neglected uh among us as
[32:11] people because of what it means to us
[32:13] and what it should means mean to us we
[32:16] don't want to ever let it be just become
[32:18] a form if if every other month becomes
[32:21] just a form I don't want to do it
[32:22] anymore like that I we don't want it to
[32:24] be just a form we we want it to be right
[32:27] we we want to come for the right reasons
[32:29] we want to do it because we love it and
[32:33] some of you know that I was deprived of
[32:35] of communion as a as a child if we can
[32:37] say it that way I wasn't deprived uh you
[32:39] know I had a good family as far as they
[32:42] fed us and clothed us and things like
[32:43] that but my dad taught spiritual
[32:45] communion and so we never had communion
[32:47] never was able to do it until I was a
[32:49] teenager and and so I've always just
[32:52] appreciated the communion service so
[32:55] much and and and sometimes we don't
[32:58] understand the value of it but but it's
[33:00] an important part of what we do as a
[33:03] church brother brandham did it on the
[33:04] first uh Sunday of every month we try to
[33:07] do it on the first Sunday of every other
[33:08] month to kind of give us time because we
[33:11] know that we want to do it right we
[33:12] don't want it just to be a form now uh
[33:15] some people do it whenever they feel the
[33:17] church needs it that's perfectly all
[33:18] right but I I just try to do it and we
[33:21] we tell people we don't want to trick
[33:22] you into coming communion we don't want
[33:24] to have to have to make you think that
[33:26] it's a different service for somebody to
[33:28] come or have a special speaker we want
[33:30] you to want to come to a communion
[33:32] service you say well what if I take it
[33:34] and I take it wrong well just repent
[33:36] what if the Rapture
[33:38] happened right we're not worried about
[33:41] we're worried about taking communion
[33:42] wrong what about what if the Rapture
[33:44] took place I want to be ready to go and
[33:47] if I'm not ready to take communion I'm
[33:48] not ready for the Rapture
[33:50] right and you say what I've sinned I've
[33:53] done something wrong then put it under
[33:55] the blood how long does it take a minute
[33:58] a second a prayer and just say God would
[34:00] you cover me that's what he wants to do
[34:03] but he's a high priest of our confession
[34:05] we've got to confess our sin to him and
[34:08] expect him to put it under the blood oh
[34:11] I'm so glad that he does it for us now
[34:15] the Bible tells us in the early church
[34:17] they actually had communion every time
[34:18] they come together you'll find that in
[34:20] Acts 241 I did I didn't get them the
[34:23] slides tonight and and it may be good
[34:25] cuz so I won't hold you as long but but
[34:28] they the Bible says in Acts 241 they
[34:30] that gladly received his word were
[34:32] baptized the same day there was added
[34:33] about 3,000 souls and they continued
[34:36] steadfastly the apostles Doctrine and
[34:38] fellowship and breaking of bread and in
[34:39] prayers brother brand said that was a
[34:41] doctrine of the Apostles of the early
[34:43] church every time they come together
[34:44] they took communion every time he said
[34:46] he said the brandham Tabernacle takes it
[34:48] once a month but the scripture is as
[34:50] often as you come together this is what
[34:51] he says in 1 Corinthians 11:25 he said
[34:54] after the same manner also he took the
[34:56] cup saying when it's up saying this cup
[34:58] is the New Testament in my blood this do
[35:00] ye as of as you drink it in in
[35:03] remembrance of me and he doesn't
[35:05] necessarily say how often just as often
[35:07] as you drink it brother brandom
[35:09] interpreted that is they did it every
[35:10] time they come together now however
[35:13] often we have communion I don't want us
[35:15] to lose sight of the importance of it
[35:18] right in 1 Corinthians 10 Paul is
[35:20] dealing with Strife in the church
[35:22] between those who ate meat which have
[35:24] been offered on an idol and those who
[35:26] refus can you believe that in the early
[35:28] church they had doctrinal differences
[35:30] among them can you imagine a church that
[35:33] was filled with the Holy Ghost and
[35:34] everything else but they still disagreed
[35:36] over minor points of Doctrine and Paul's
[35:39] answer for that was to tell them the
[35:41] truth but to tell them hey don't don't
[35:44] offend your brother right try to get
[35:46] along right not everybody's going to be
[35:48] the same now he said this in 1
[35:49] Corinthians 10:15 I speak as to wise men
[35:53] judge what I say the cup of blessing
[35:56] which we bless is it not the communion
[35:57] Union the bread which we break isn't not
[35:59] the communion of the Body for we being
[36:01] many are one bread and one body we are
[36:03] all partakers of that one bread
[36:07] communion literally means participation
[36:09] Fellowship it's the Greek word coinonia
[36:12] which is fellowship it's it's uh it's
[36:15] participation it's
[36:17] partnership right it's sharing and you
[36:20] can brother Brandon makes this statement
[36:22] I heard the quote this weekend he said
[36:24] he said many of you can fellowship with
[36:26] me on this thought and sometimes I'll
[36:28] say that you can fellowship with me on
[36:30] this it means that we have a shared uh
[36:32] we have a shared
[36:34] experience right so if you've had maybe
[36:37] uh maybe a death in the family and so
[36:39] thinking of brother bill today and and
[36:41] what's going on with his father and if
[36:43] you've been through that you can
[36:44] participate you can fellowship with the
[36:46] loss of a loved one and if you haven't
[36:49] then you
[36:50] can't right you can't Fellowship there's
[36:52] no
[36:53] participation and every one of us has
[36:55] got something we can fellowship with one
[36:56] another on
[36:58] and things that we don't Fellowship
[36:59] because we're just not the same I can't
[37:02] fellowship with h with a brother who's a
[37:04] used car salesman I've never done that I
[37:07] can't fellowship with him on that right
[37:09] there's other things we can Fellowship
[37:11] on but when it comes to use car sales
[37:13] I'm not I don't know much about it but
[37:15] brother Joel can fellowship with that
[37:17] and and brother Bill can fellowship with
[37:18] that because they sold cars right you've
[37:21] done the same thing you can fellowship
[37:23] if you're a teacher with other teachers
[37:25] but when we come to the communion table
[37:27] what it does is it tells us there's one
[37:30] thing that we can fellowship with one
[37:32] another on there's one thing that we all
[37:34] have in common and that's the body and
[37:36] the blood of the Lord he died for every
[37:38] one of us the same way he didn't have to
[37:41] die again he didn't die one time for me
[37:43] and another time for you and another
[37:45] time for somebody else but when he died
[37:46] he died for each one of us and so every
[37:50] one of us Fellowship around the
[37:53] thought of the death of
[37:55] Christ and and his
[37:58] sacrifice for us oh I think we ought to
[38:01] be able to Fellowship around that so
[38:04] it's a it's a communion not it's mostly
[38:07] mainly a communion with God but it's
[38:10] also communion with one
[38:12] another and so brother Brandon says
[38:14] there's a communion with the Lord and
[38:16] this in this way every service ought to
[38:20] be a
[38:21] communion we we shouldn't just come to
[38:24] what we call a communion service which
[38:26] is really the Lord's supp for the Lord's
[38:28] table we shouldn't just come to that as
[38:31] communion but every service this morning
[38:34] was communion with God tonight communion
[38:37] with God Wednesday night communion with
[38:39] God and we may miss a communion service
[38:42] now and then but don't miss to have
[38:44] communion with God in your everyday life
[38:48] a communion with the Lord Brother BR
[38:49] says like an oasis in the desert it's
[38:53] like the spring underneath the pond we
[38:56] had three ponds on on our property
[38:58] growing up one of them had a spring
[39:00] under it and two of them had no spring
[39:03] they were all about the same size a
[39:05] couple of them a little smaller but they
[39:07] they all looked kind of the same when
[39:09] when the rain was good and when the
[39:11] water but you let it get the heat of the
[39:13] summer and you find that those other
[39:15] ponds would start to dry up and be full
[39:18] of all kinds of nastiness and they get
[39:20] they turn brown but that Springfed Pond
[39:23] would always be clean because it was
[39:25] constantly given out of itself why it
[39:27] was Springfed it was a spring and
[39:29] brother B said that's what communion in
[39:31] your life or in the church is like when
[39:33] we have communion with God it's like a
[39:35] spring under the pond an oasis in a
[39:37] desert it it's where the traveler coming
[39:39] by stops and drinks the water till he
[39:42] quenches his thirst all that our
[39:43] services would be a communion with God
[39:46] until we can quench The Thirst from our
[39:49] hearts brother Wendell said this morning
[39:51] we got to want it we got to press into
[39:53] it and in order to do that we've got to
[39:55] have communion with him that's what we
[39:58] want that's the object of our
[40:00] desire that's remembering the Lord he
[40:02] said coming by the order of his table we
[40:04] the passing Pilgrim that's souring here
[40:06] on Earth with us together we can come by
[40:08] his Table and there drink of His
[40:10] blessings and of his grace and of his
[40:12] word in Fellowship around his word until
[40:15] our thirsty souls are sad how many are
[40:17] thirsty tonight we're thirsty we want to
[40:20] be as brother wend said this morning we
[40:21] want to be in fellowship with him we
[40:23] don't want to just be in the crowd we
[40:24] want to be right where he is and if
[40:27] we're thirsty for that he said I've
[40:29] provided a way for you to come together
[40:30] in Fellowship around this one thought
[40:33] that my sins are under the blood and
[40:35] I've been
[40:36] forgiven and every one of us some of us
[40:38] have been healed and some of us are sick
[40:40] and some of us have different needs and
[40:42] different trials been through different
[40:44] things but every one of us brother Mike
[40:46] can come back to this thought that we
[40:48] have been born again by the blood of
[40:50] Jesus Christ every one of us stands at
[40:52] the communion table completely level
[40:55] every one of us forgiven by God not one
[40:58] above another oh what a wonderful thing
[41:00] not one you said well they've been a
[41:01] Christian for a year or 10 years or 20
[41:03] years it does not matter every one of us
[41:05] come to the table the
[41:07] same
[41:09] right oh I'm glad for
[41:11] that Hallelujah he said then we leave
[41:14] the place of worship
[41:16] refreshed
[41:18] satisfied going out to meet the desert's
[41:21] problems again the problems of life's
[41:24] desert yes in Oasis in the desert
[41:26] refreshing ourselves making ourselves
[41:28] when we're thirsty he said it should be
[41:30] with every worshipper it is with every
[41:32] true worshipper that they long to get
[41:35] together listen Church brother brandom
[41:37] didn't teach a an individual religion
[41:39] but he said every true worshipper longs
[41:41] to get together there's something about
[41:44] the fellowship that's Divine it's
[41:46] ordered of God and it's holy sacred and
[41:48] the righteous are thirsting for it
[41:51] that's good yeah there have been moments
[41:54] in my life when I just thought God if I
[41:56] could just get to church
[41:59] if I could just get to church I
[42:01] appreciate my prayer closet I appreciate
[42:02] being able to talk to him anywhere but
[42:04] there just something about the house of
[42:06] God that's special to me if I could just
[42:09] get to church things start making sense
[42:12] you could be going through the worst
[42:13] time of your life but when I sat in the
[42:15] house of God David said that many
[42:17] hundreds and thousands of years ago
[42:18] David sat there and he said I I was
[42:20] looking that these men these rich men
[42:22] that go on with their lives and they
[42:24] commit evil acts and they continue to
[42:26] get richer he said but then I saw their
[42:28] end he said I come in the Tabernacle it
[42:30] helped me to understand when I sat in
[42:32] the presence of God that that it wasn't
[42:34] that that there there's an end for them
[42:36] and there's an end for me amen he said
[42:39] my foot my feet stood in Slippery places
[42:42] until I saw their
[42:43] End Amen where do you find that in the
[42:46] house of God communion service is
[42:49] communication between you and God and
[42:50] between you and your brother yes
[42:54] especially in the act of foot washing
[42:55] which we do with communion when you view
[42:59] it scripturally the act of taking
[43:00] communion brings The
[43:02] Showdown right it it forces you to
[43:06] something it forces you to think of
[43:08] yourself not as an
[43:09] individual but as one part of the body
[43:13] of Christ yeah cuz the person I'm going
[43:16] to get
[43:17] real real down where we live for a
[43:19] minute and then we're going to
[43:21] quit but the person who come by that you
[43:23] don't
[43:24] like I know we don't have anybody here
[43:27] like
[43:28] that but whoever that might be it's
[43:31] whoever you're thinking about right
[43:35] now you passed by the communion table
[43:39] some of you thought of me didn't
[43:41] you you pass by the communion
[43:44] table they take the same
[43:49] bread because the body was broken for
[43:53] them right they drink the same wine
[43:56] because the body was broken the blood
[43:58] was spilled for them right and that
[44:01] makes us brings us in unity we may not
[44:04] agree on what kind of pie we like we may
[44:07] not agree on what to do on this or that
[44:09] or the other but we agree on this one
[44:11] thing I was a great Sinner and he is a
[44:15] great savior could you fellowship with
[44:17] me on that thought tonight I was a great
[44:19] sinner all of us can say that and he is
[44:22] a great
[44:23] savior
[44:25] amen Hal
[44:28] remember you're not
[44:29] alone other people may not be able to
[44:32] fellowship with you as I said on
[44:34] different things they commun entirely
[44:35] with you on different things but when we
[44:37] remember the body and blood of the lord
[44:39] we know that he can we know that he was
[44:42] tempted in allik man are such as we are
[44:44] and if you're going through something
[44:45] that feels like nobody else can
[44:47] understand or commiserate with your
[44:48] troubles but you can look at it and say
[44:50] I know that he knows what I'm going
[44:53] through so I come to the communion table
[44:55] and it reminds me of that the Brandon
[44:57] made a special effort to attend
[44:59] communion service at the Tabernacle he
[45:01] said I truly think it's the duty of
[45:03] every Christian to take communion the
[45:04] Bible said if you take this not you have
[45:06] no part with me he said I believe it's a
[45:08] showdown time for the Christians if we
[45:10] do not take it we have no part with him
[45:12] if we take it unworthily then we're
[45:14] guilty of the body and death of Christ I
[45:15] know people sometimes are out at church
[45:17] that's not he's talking about but if you
[45:19] if it's offered to you and you refuse to
[45:20] take it what you're saying is I'm either
[45:23] not a Christian or I've could I've
[45:27] committed some sin and I won't repent of
[45:30] it right and Christians don't do that we
[45:33] don't want to do that sometimes it's
[45:35] it's
[45:36] misunderstanding people misunderstand
[45:38] that and it's fear that keeps them from
[45:39] the communion table we should never come
[45:42] afraid we come boldly before the throne
[45:44] of grace right because we don't come by
[45:46] our own Merit we come by the grace of
[45:49] God so and if we don't take it with no
[45:52] part if we take it unworthily we're
[45:53] guilty of the body and death of Christ
[45:56] so it gets to place where it keeps the
[45:57] Christian prayed up so if you want to
[46:00] look at the value what's the value of
[46:01] communion why do we have it like we do
[46:03] because it keeps the Christian prayed up
[46:06] because you know what I'm going to
[46:08] communion
[46:09] service I got to wash my feet and pray
[46:13] up
[46:15] right am I the only one does that wait
[46:18] wait we want to make sure we're prayed
[46:19] up right ready for communion service for
[46:22] foot Washing Service why because we know
[46:25] I take it seriously church I don't come
[46:28] to the altar yes sir right without
[46:31] repentance right yeah I I don't even
[46:34] come out here without repentance every
[46:37] time I cross the threshold of one of
[46:38] these doors if I'm coming to the
[46:40] platform I stop right at that door and I
[46:42] pray say God forgive me if I've done
[46:44] something I don't know about something
[46:46] that that that that that's escaped my
[46:48] attention and I've not spent enough time
[46:50] with you or done something's wrong
[46:51] forgive me Lord forgive me Lord I
[46:54] stopped right there and I learned that
[46:55] from brother Buster Brown years ago he
[46:57] would stop at the edge and pray and
[46:59] repent of his sins before he come out on
[47:00] the altar why it's a sacred place not
[47:03] because there's anything about the wood
[47:05] not because there's anything about the
[47:06] platform but because this is where God
[47:09] meets with us it's time that we've set
[47:12] aside for him to meet with us so we come
[47:14] reverently to the communion table we
[47:17] don't just take it uh you know like it
[47:20] well it's just like chewing gum but we
[47:22] take it reverently solemnly sacredly
[47:25] walking up conf messing all of our
[47:28] wrongs praying one for the other not
[47:31] only that but we should feel he said if
[47:33] there's a brother or sister Among Us
[47:35] that we feel is just a little bit out of
[47:38] line I know none of y'all think anybody
[47:40] else is out of line but sometimes I get
[47:42] to feel no way that brother's a little
[47:43] out of line yeah that sister's a little
[47:45] out of line he said our hearts ought to
[47:47] be burdened for that person on communion
[47:50] night
[47:53] especially
[47:54] especially to see them that they'll be
[47:56] be able to walk up and take communion
[47:59] you see people that are no longer in
[48:00] communion with us it reminds us who the
[48:02] church
[48:03] is right and those who are no longer
[48:05] able to take it because of sickness or
[48:07] because of it reminds us of them and we
[48:09] say Lord I I want them to be able to be
[48:11] in church or maybe some of our elders
[48:14] get to where they can't come anymore
[48:15] can't come at night and we lord I want
[48:17] so badly I've served uh sister Fritz
[48:20] communion many many times over the years
[48:22] and I don't see her tonight she probably
[48:23] had to go home but but I want her to be
[48:26] so bad I want her to be there and in the
[48:28] communion service her body is getting
[48:30] where she can't do it anymore but I want
[48:32] so badly for her to be there and so I
[48:34] pray for her at Communion time it
[48:37] reminds me of that our the brothers and
[48:39] sisters that are missing tonight it
[48:40] reminds me of them if there's someone
[48:42] maybe who's left church and backit and
[48:44] gone out in the world and you think I
[48:46] once took communion with him there's
[48:48] something special about that I want to
[48:50] see him at the table again some of y'all
[48:52] you don't know how much you bless me
[48:54] when you come by the communion table
[48:55] brother brandom talked about that he saw
[48:57] the different families coming up and I
[48:59] see some of your families come up and I
[49:00] know what God did for you I know what
[49:02] you come out of I know what my family
[49:04] come out of I know what we were and when
[49:06] you come up before the communion table
[49:08] just something leaps in my heart because
[49:10] I know that you weren't able to do that
[49:12] one day and now you do it with full
[49:14] Assurance of Faith why because you
[49:16] believe God died he died for your sins
[49:19] and you've taken advantage of that
[49:21] you've been born again by the blood of
[49:23] Jesus
[49:24] Christ Hallelujah
[49:28] Hallelujah he said you ought to be
[49:29] burdened for them to see them they'll be
[49:31] able to walk up and take commun not be
[49:32] condemned with the world because they
[49:34] are our brothers and sisters it should
[49:37] not be just a
[49:38] tradition he said you don't take and as
[49:41] I said we have to change it up we'll
[49:43] change it up but we don't want
[49:45] tradition we want it to be real yeah you
[49:48] don't take the Lord's Supper by
[49:50] tradition you take it because it's the
[49:52] love of God In Your Heart Right keeping
[49:54] the Commandments of God see that's what
[49:56] you take it for
[49:57] he said if you don't take it in
[49:58] sincerity just as tradition well our
[50:01] church observes communion once every
[50:02] Sunday or once every month or twice a
[50:04] year he said you go up and say well it's
[50:06] my time take the communion he said why a
[50:09] stink to
[50:10] God said see that's just a tradition
[50:14] even like anything else you've got to be
[50:16] sincere God wants the depths of your
[50:19] heart he said you remember the very God
[50:22] that brought you here on Earth is the
[50:23] one you're serving you're doing this
[50:25] because he said so because it's his
[50:26] order and we want to come up with
[50:28] deepness of sincerity knowing that by

[52:05] to love one another we got to come back
[52:07] to communion with one another communion
[52:10] ought to destroy every faction in the

[52:16] some point every one of us comes to the
[52:18] communion table if we come right yeah we
[52:21] come
[52:24] repenting not because we're sinners
[52:28] we've been saved by the blood of Jesus
[52:29] Christ how many believe that but every
[52:32] day we our feet get dirty our our hands
[52:34] and our feet have to be washed we've got
[52:35] to we we we we pick up things along the
[52:38] way and we need to come to the table and

[52:45] error forgive me of my secret sin
[52:46] forgive me of my thoughts forgive me of
[52:48] the things that I've done
[52:50] wrong and if every one of us comes and
[52:54] every one of us is Forgiven

[53:00] God forgives
[53:01] us it no matter what the what the depth
[53:04] of the sin is he forgives

[53:28] if he forgive me how can we take
[53:31] communion with a grudge in our heart
[53:34] against somebody else how can we have
[53:36] ought you've heard that saying ought
[53:39] that word ought yeah it's from Mark
[53:41] 11:24 therefore I say to you what things
[53:43] soever you desire When you pray believe
[53:45] that you receive them and you shall have
[53:47] them yeah when you s pray and forgive if
[53:49] you have ought ought against anyone
[53:53] against any that your father also which
[53:55] is in heaven May forgive you your
[53:57] trespasses The New International Version
[53:59] says it like this when you stand praying
[54:01] if you hold
[54:03] anything yeah that's what a is a means
[54:07] anything what does a
[54:10] mean anything
[54:13] yeah I'd hear that as kid I didn't
[54:15] understand what a was I don't have a in
[54:18] my
[54:20] heart just means
[54:22] anything it covers it all if you hold
[54:28] anything oh my forgive them yeah when
[54:33] you stand praying when you come to the
[54:35] communion table when you come to
[54:38] church and you expect the blood of Jesus
[54:40] Christ to forgive you of your
[54:42] sins if you have ought against
[54:46] anyone forgive them so that your father
[54:49] in Heaven May forgive you your sins
[54:52] right brother Brandon said if there is
[54:54] an ought
[54:56] what does OP
[54:57] mean anything in your heart against
[55:03] anyone go to them now and be
[55:06] reconciled forget all the past yeah and
[55:10] if you've been having an up and down
[55:12] life remember something has come into
[55:15] that heart something has moved into
[55:17] those thoughts no matter who your enemy
[55:18] is love him love him he said no matter
[55:22] what's happened let it go after all I I
[55:26] love this analogy if you listen to
[55:28] brother Donnie Reagan sermon last night
[55:30] over at the meetings it he said we're a
[55:33] garden yeah right we're a garden of the
[55:35] Lord but listen to how brother Brandon
[55:36] puts this he said no matter what's
[55:39] happened let it go after all you're in a
[55:42] field with
[55:48] weeds the wheat and the tears grow up
[55:50] together yeah but we don't have a
[55:52] license to hate the tears right come on
[55:56] now yeah right come on church we got to
[55:59] learn to love the
[56:01] tears treat the tears right we're in a
[56:04] field with
[56:06] weeds not everybody that goes to church
[56:08] is born again
[56:09] yet are you with me now not everybody's
[56:13] even elect yeah and now we shouldn't
[56:15] start pointing say well this one is this
[56:17] one is you don't know who is and who
[56:18] isn't because you don't know what the
[56:20] future is but God does yes sir so the
[56:24] the weeds you're in a field with weeds
[56:27] he said we realize that but we must both
[56:29] grow together we've got to come up
[56:31] together oh church that's what we want
[56:33] see we can't send both bitter and sweet
[56:36] water from the same fountain that
[56:38] there's got if we come and say Lord
[56:39] You've forgiven me we've got to say Lord
[56:42] I forgive
[56:43] them brother BR said if you're a sinner
[56:46] raise up your eyes and look if you've
[56:47] been indifferent if you've had little
[56:49] squabbles and little things what
[56:50] difference does it make he said you're
[56:51] going to die one of these days what day
[56:53] maybe
[56:54] today you don't know and hour from now
[56:56] you may be in Hell or you may be in
[56:58] heaven but you've got to choose now if
[57:01] there's anything in your life that isn't
[57:02] right you choose Now by faith you say
[57:05] well if I can just get even with her if
[57:07] I can get even with him no matter what
[57:09] they done choose life no matter what
[57:12] they done choose life well they refuse
[57:14] to repent choose
[57:16] life Jesus did not forgive them because
[57:20] they would accept it right
[57:22] yeah that changed my life I heard that
[57:25] years ago I think it was brother Wayne L
[57:26] was preaching and he said Jesus did that
[57:29] not because they would accept it because
[57:30] he said you're of your father the
[57:32] devil and the and the high priests never
[57:35] were saved yeah but he said father
[57:38] forgive them yeah they don't know what
[57:41] they're doing yeah why did he say it not
[57:43] because of who they were but because of
[57:45] who he was yes it was his
[57:50] nature Hallelujah it was his nature to
[57:52] be a forgiver it's our nature if we take
[57:55] on the nature of Christ to be a forgiver
[57:58] of
[57:59] sins amen and he said if you're from
[58:01] your heart you don't forgive every
[58:03] person their transgression neither does
[58:05] your heavenly father forgive you so just
[58:07] get that close if there's one ought what
[58:10] does ought
[58:12] mean we got
[58:15] it if there's one ought one
[58:19] anything in your heart against any
[58:23] person sinner or saint you're in danger
[58:26] of
[58:27] Hellfire
[58:30] right he said well it's impossible not
[58:32] to have
[58:34] anything I beg to
[58:37] differ you won't be able to keep those
[58:39] thoughts from coming back into your mind
[58:40] but they can be under the blood
[58:42] today you say well I have to fight that
[58:45] tomorrow fight it tomorrow then all
[58:47] right sufficient to the day is the evil
[58:49] thereof but for this service this
[58:53] moment for my time of worship I'm not
[58:55] going to let anything my handkerchiefs
[58:57] are back I'm not going to let anything
[59:00] get between me and
[59:02] God are you with me church I'm not going
[59:05] to let you stand in the way of my
[59:07] healing so I'll forgive you all right
[59:09] I'll let it go because I'm not going to
[59:11] let that stand in the way of me in a
[59:13] good service I'm not going to let that
[59:15] stand in the way of me running the
[59:16] aisles if God tells me to do it of me
[59:18] shouting and jumping and what speaking
[59:20] into whatever he tells me to do I'm not
[59:22] going to let that stand in the way of me
[59:24] feeling forgiven just because I won't
[59:26] forgive
[59:27] you oh yes
[59:30] sir so we are commanded yeah to deal
[59:34] with it if we have any ought anything in
[59:37] our heart against sinner or Saint we're
[59:39] commanded to deal with that before we
[59:41] take
[59:43] communion you know
[59:45] that because if not he says you're
[59:48] taking unworthily you're guilty of the
[59:49] body and blood of the Lord so we think
[59:51] of taking it unworthily is committing
[59:52] some moral sin some sin of the flesh
[59:56] maybe smoking
[1:00:00] drinking but if you have ought you take
[1:00:03] it
[1:00:05] unworthily any
[1:00:09] thing what does it mean that we're
[1:00:11] guilty of the body and blood of the Lord
[1:00:12] it means we're crucifying him aresh yeah
[1:00:15] we come to the
[1:00:17] table with a thought in our heart
[1:00:19] against any
[1:00:21] person what are we doing
[1:00:23] we I know this is Close Church but we
[1:00:26] got to get that close before we can go
[1:00:28] to
[1:00:29] heaven right we want to go home we go on
[1:00:32] a rapture we not content you just stay
[1:00:35] here so we don't want anything no a in
[1:00:38] our
[1:00:39] heart before you take
[1:00:41] communion just say Lord forgive me I
[1:00:45] forgive
[1:00:47] them that's all it
[1:00:49] takes we don't want to crucify him a
[1:00:51] fresh I don't want to drive the nails
[1:00:56] I don't want to be
[1:00:59] there you imagine the guilt that would
[1:01:01] be on the person who stood there and
[1:01:04] drove the nails in his hand the people
[1:01:06] who gambled at at his feet while the Son
[1:01:08] of God stood dying on the cross and
[1:01:10] they're sitting there gambling over his
[1:01:13] clothes the one who put the spear in his
[1:01:16] side yeah you imagine the the ones who
[1:01:18] cried crucify him come on come on give
[1:01:22] us Barabas imagine the guilt that they
[1:01:24] felt do you realize when we come and unw
[1:01:28] when we do not repent of our sins we're
[1:01:30] guilty of the body and blood of the
[1:01:32] Lord just as guilty as they are good I'm
[1:01:37] not trying to make you feel bad today
[1:01:38] just repent of it say well I don't have
[1:01:41] time to go make it right with that
[1:01:42] person God knows your
[1:01:44] heart he knows you want to make it right
[1:01:47] with him and you'll make it right with
[1:01:49] the person if you need
[1:01:50] to when you have anything in your
[1:01:53] heart now what did he do that body again
[1:01:56] we we've already went what did he do in
[1:01:57] that body in Luke
[1:01:59] 23:34 that they he was crucified with
[1:02:01] the malactor verse 34 then said Jesus
[1:02:04] father forgive them where where' he do
[1:02:06] that in his body his body which is a
[1:02:10] type right here a symbol of his broken
[1:02:12] body he forgave them in his body then if
[1:02:15] we take in his body we also
[1:02:19] forgive we also forgive how can we take
[1:02:23] these symbols of his blood and his body
[1:02:26] and not forgive every
[1:02:29] enemy but the Bible says let a man
[1:02:31] examine himself as I'm
[1:02:33] closing let a man examine himself and so
[1:02:35] let him eat of that bread and drink of
[1:02:39] that
[1:02:41] cup brother brandom even talks about
[1:02:43] prayer
[1:02:44] lines he Jesus said when you pray if you
[1:02:48] have ought in your heart forgive every
[1:02:50] man someone say every
[1:02:52] man that's hard to do isn't it it's even
[1:02:55] hard harder forgive Every
[1:03:00] Woman every
[1:03:03] child every man every human from your
[1:03:07] heart his trespass for if you do not
[1:03:08] from your heart forgive neither does
[1:03:10] your heavenly father forgive you yours
[1:03:12] he said so to enter this line how many
[1:03:14] want healing
[1:03:15] tonight you want healing I want healing
[1:03:19] if we want healing we got to come this
[1:03:22] way he said if you want to enter this
[1:03:23] line be free from sin how can I be free
[1:03:26] from sin I can't undo it confess your
[1:03:30] faults one to another pray one for
[1:03:33] another that you may be healed he said
[1:03:36] so if you got a in your heart that's sin
[1:03:39] don't bring sin in the
[1:03:41] line ask for
[1:03:44] forgiveness give forgiveness a real
[1:03:47] communion service ought to bring a
[1:03:50] Revival there should be no presence so
[1:03:52] sweet as when we recognize and remember
[1:03:55] his body and his blood and we've all
[1:03:58] made everything right and then look at
[1:04:00] the worship we can have at the end
[1:04:02] because everybody's under the blood all
[1:04:04] all the little differences are done away
[1:04:06] with all the little all the little isms
[1:04:08] and all the little schisms and all the
[1:04:10] little factions are done away with and
[1:04:12] we can say Lord we all stand together
[1:04:14] here at the foot of the cross and we're
[1:04:16] not going to put down nobody we're not
[1:04:18] going to spend our time talking about
[1:04:19] people but we're going to come to the
[1:04:22] table and partake of the body and the
[1:04:24] blood of the Lord because every one of
[1:04:26] us have that in common from the least to
[1:04:28] the greatest I need it just as much as
[1:04:31] you do brother brand says he said he
[1:04:35] said until a man can get down in alter
[1:04:37] talk about Revival and get right with
[1:04:39] God till he can Overlook little things
[1:04:40] and move on like a Christian ought to he
[1:04:42] said the po can't call the kettle black
[1:04:45] don't holler at them he's talking about
[1:04:46] the worldly church he said don't holler
[1:04:47] at them let's clean our own steps first
[1:04:50] oh you say we got it he said you he said
[1:04:52] the only thing you got is lukewarm he
[1:04:54] said the music is running you're running
[1:04:56] he said when the Music Stops we stop
[1:04:57] brother don't call the other fellow
[1:04:59] something let's look around your own
[1:05:00] door he said we need an oldfashioned
[1:05:01] Revival like we used to have down in the
[1:05:03] country when they lay in their face all
[1:05:05] night long not to carry on but real
[1:05:07] Godly sorrow not go back to the Altar
[1:05:09] and stay but go out and make it right
[1:05:11] with the neighbors yeah they had made it
[1:05:13] wrong with you get straightened up a lot
[1:05:16] of times that's the reason you know I
[1:05:17] know young people sometimes it's hard
[1:05:19] and I want you to stay until you get
[1:05:21] it right I want that but many times the
[1:05:24] reason they're staying and not getting
[1:05:25] it is because they just haven't made
[1:05:27] things right yet sometimes you need to
[1:05:29] tell Mom and Dad you're
[1:05:32] sorry sometimes you can tell your
[1:05:34] siblings you're sorry sometimes you just
[1:05:36] need to make it right he
[1:05:39] said a man is born once born again not
[1:05:42] emotionally worked up not some
[1:05:43] enthusiasm not putting his name on a
[1:05:44] church book not by joining the biggest
[1:05:46] church in the city but when he's
[1:05:48] actually cried through and begged with
[1:05:50] tears in his eyes till God has forgiven
[1:05:51] his sins cleansed his soul up from a
[1:05:54] life of sin and filled him with the Holy
[1:05:55] spirit with such love and godly till he
[1:05:58] takes them old tire tools back he
[1:06:00] stole I just love that how'd he pick
[1:06:02] that out there must have been somebody
[1:06:03] there that stole tire
[1:06:05] tools whatever it is that you took that
[1:06:08] doesn't belong to you take it
[1:06:10] back that's what Revival will do that's
[1:06:13] what real communion will do judgment
[1:06:16] begins at the house of God by the word
[1:06:18] of God he said not a textbook but the
[1:06:20] Bible not what some church teaches in
[1:06:21] their theology but what God says then
[1:06:23] you'll have a Revival where great powers
[1:06:25] and wonders and no we want that church
[1:06:28] wonders and signs and miracles and
[1:06:30] everything else will take
[1:06:32] place Brothers if you could come and
[1:06:34] begin to prepare the the communion we'll
[1:06:36] get ready to read the
[1:06:39] scripture at the end of that scripture 1
[1:06:41] Corinthians 11 he said for this caused
[1:06:43] many are weak and sickly among you and
[1:06:44] many sleep if we would judge ourselves
[1:06:48] we need a piano player an organ player I
[1:06:49] believe the Joel's already arranged that
[1:06:52] he said if we would judge
[1:06:53] ourselves we should not be judged but
[1:06:55] when we are judged we are chastened of
[1:06:58] the Lord that we should not be
[1:07:01] condemned with the world would we you
[1:07:04] bow your heads with me for just a
[1:07:08] moment I I'm challenging us tonight
[1:07:11] challenging
[1:07:13] myself it don't matter if it's spouse
[1:07:15] husband wife boyfriend
[1:07:18] girlfriend
[1:07:20] neighbor brother sister no matter if

[1:07:26] knew there's a grudge in your heart
[1:07:28] there's
[1:07:29] ought
[1:07:31] anything against any one it's not
[1:07:36] worth getting in the way of your
[1:07:39] worship it's not worth getting in the
[1:07:41] way of
[1:07:43] communion I want to be judged right
[1:07:46] here let me not come to that white
[1:07:48] Throne judgment but let me be judged

[1:23:42] Jesus I'm going to read part of the foot
[1:23:44] washing scripture in John 13 but I want
[1:23:47] to say this foot washing makes you very
[1:23:50] vulnerable very vulnerable and what that
[1:23:53] does is it it teaches us we trust one
[1:23:56] another we trust one another we love one
[1:23:59] another we're we're open we're an open
[1:24:02] book we're not trying to hide anything
[1:24:04] we just we all get Dusty from time to
[1:24:07] time because we're human we're made out
[1:24:09] of dirt but we there's Grace for our
[1:24:11] dirt brother the Wayne preached I think
[1:24:13] Friday night over at the meetings
[1:24:15] there's Grace for our dirt but he deals
[1:24:18] with us as sons was another sermon that
[1:24:21] was preached there deals with us as Sons
[1:24:25] I'm so thankful for that we're dirt but
[1:24:27] there's something on the inside a
[1:24:30] deposit of God deity on the inside I'm
[1:24:32] so thankful for that so let's treat each
[1:24:35] other that way can we do that and it's a
[1:24:37] very vulnerable time but it's a very
[1:24:39] wonderful time we'll gather as soon as
[1:24:41] the foot Washing Service over we'll
[1:24:42] gather back in here and just worship for
[1:24:45] a little while before we go home amen
[1:24:47] John Chapter

[1:24:52] 8 Peter said to him you shall never wash
[1:24:55] my
[1:24:56] feet and Jesus answered him if I do not
[1:24:59] wash you you have no part with me Simon
[1:25:02] Peter said to him Lord not my feet only
[1:25:04] but also my hands and my head Jesus said
[1:25:07] to him he who has bathed needs only to
[1:25:09] wash his feet but is completely clean
[1:25:11] and you're clean but not all for he knew
[1:25:13] who would betray him therefore he said
[1:25:15] you're not all clean so when he had
[1:25:16] washed their feet and taken His Garment
[1:25:18] sit down again he said to them do you
[1:25:20] know what I've done to you you call me
[1:25:22] master and Lord you say well for so I am

[1:50:35] uh whatever these brothers do whatever

[1:50:39] Joel does uh any of you brothers that go
[1:50:42] or overseas and help us in any way
[1:50:44] that's we're part of the church it's a
[1:50:46] church representation of us there and we
[1:50:49] just want to believe it'll help be a
[1:50:50] help to those people I've got some
[1:50:52] things things on my heart for Missions
