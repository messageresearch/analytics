[7:04] for me every day
[7:08] [Music]
[8:01] over 2000 years ago in the days of Herod
[8:04] King of Judea Caesar Augustus issued a
[8:06] decree that a census should be taken of
[8:10] the entire Roman world to be taxed
[8:12] everyone was required to go to his town
[8:14] to register
[8:16] so Joseph went up from the town of
[8:17] Nazareth and Galilee to Bethlehem the
[8:19] town of David
[8:20] because he belonged to the lineage of
[8:22] David
[8:23] he went there to register with Mary who
[8:25] was pledged to be married
[8:33] to him with great child
[8:37] Joseph and Mary
[8:41] as they traveled to Bethlehem Mary was
[8:43] exhausted and she told Joseph
[8:45] this baby's going to be born soon this
[8:51] is so Joseph looked a little panicked
[8:53] and he urged the donkey to walk a little
[8:54] bit faster for his sweetheart
[9:00] they came to the first Inn Caesar's
[9:03] Palace
[9:05] and Joseph asked can we stay here
[9:08] stay here
[9:09] The Innkeeper crossed his arms and
[9:11] rudely shouted we have no room for you
[9:13] [Music]
[9:17] they walked around town
[9:20] to the next gym
[9:23] Desert Inn or is that dessert in I may
[9:26] have wrote that wrong
[9:27] Joseph again asked do you have a room
[9:30] available do you have a room available
[9:34] but The Innkeeper could not help him
[9:37] he just shook his head sadly and waved
[9:39] them away
[9:44] feeling desperate and ready to pull out
[9:46] their hair
[9:47] Joseph and Mary walked further along and
[9:50] found the next Inn best Eastern
[9:54] Joseph and Mary asked do you have a
[9:56] place for us to stay do you have
[9:59] The Innkeeper told them I'm sorry I am
[10:02] completely booked
[10:05] I'm sorry I'm completely booked any
[10:08] clean books
[10:10] Mary was becoming quite distressed and
[10:13] groaned in pain
[10:18] Joseph got down on his knees and pleaded
[10:20] with The Innkeeper to help them
[10:28] finally The Innkeeper put a finger to
[10:30] his head and said I have an idea yeah
[10:34] he told the couple
[10:35] you can use my stable out back you can
[10:40] so Mary and Joseph said thank you so
[10:42] much thank you so much
[10:44] and went to the stable where they made
[10:46] themselves as comfortable as they could
[10:55] the baby Jesus was born
[11:01] [Music]
[11:03] Mary wrapped him in swaddling cloths and
[11:06] laid him in the manger
[11:16] okay okay
[11:51] thank you
[11:57] Jesus Jesus Jesus
[12:04] [Music]
[12:19] the angels singing
[12:22] [Music]
[12:29] he was Herald
[12:31] by the Angels
[12:34] born a lonely manger
[12:37] the Virgin Mary was his mother
[12:41] and Joseph voices Earthly father
[12:45] three wise men came from afar
[12:49] they were Guided by shining stars
[12:53] see King Jesus
[12:56] [Music]
[13:02] Jesus Jesus
[13:08] [Music]
[13:29] glory to the new
[13:34] Jesus speaks
[13:42] us Jesus
[13:45] [Music]
[14:07] Lord glory
[14:10] glory to him
[14:48] now nearby there were shepherds out in
[14:50] the field tending to their flock of
[14:53] bleating sheep
[14:56] okay now the sheep can make some noise
[14:59] you know what a sheep says
[15:04] they were enjoying their fairly calm
[15:06] evening and laughed with each other
[15:14] suddenly an angel of the Lord appeared
[15:16] in the sky
[15:43] the ship
[15:44] the Shepherds were terrified they were
[15:47] so scared they fell to the ground
[15:52] the angel gestured grandily and said do
[15:55] not be afraid
[15:56] do not be afraid the angel told him the
[15:59] joyous news this night a savior is born
[16:02] in Bethlehem this night if the savior is
[16:05] born in Bethlehem
[16:07] then a Heavenly Host joined the angel
[16:15] they raised their hands and praised to
[16:18] God and said glory to God in the highest
[16:22] glory to God in the highest and on Earth
[16:25] peace and Good Will to men
[16:31] and when the Angels left
[16:34] the Shepherds were amazed at what they
[16:37] had seen and heard
[16:38] the oldest Shepherd
[16:43] stood to his feet and said
[16:52] let's go to Bethlehem let's go to
[16:54] Bethlehem let's see this for ourselves
[16:56] let's save this for ourselves the other
[16:58] Shepherds jumped up
[17:01] they were all excited and danced about
[17:07] then they said let's go let's go
[17:11] and so the Shepherds herded their sheep
[17:14] to go see the newborn savior
[17:17] they found Mary and Joseph and baby just
[17:20] as the angel had said
[17:25] and when they had seen it they told
[17:27] everyone near and far of what was said
[17:29] about baby Jesus
