[48:57] one of youen First Kings chapter 18 if
[49:01] you have your Bibles First Kings chapter
[49:04] 18 I won't take too much time
[49:06] tonight brother Stewart took some of my
[49:09] time so I'll just cut that out I'll just
[49:12] cut that out of mine and and did you
[49:14] enjoy that this morning didn't he do a
[49:16] wonderful job amen we sure love brother
[49:18] Stuart I got to pick on him though CU I
[49:21] get picked on every time I go long
[49:23] so return evil for evil or something
[49:26] like
[49:29] that first Kings chapter 18 and verse 19
[49:33] we'll start with verse
[49:34] 19 now therefore send and gather to me
[49:37] all Israel unto Mount Carmel and the
[49:39] prophets of Baal 450 and the prophets of
[49:42] the Groves 400 which eat at Jezebel's
[49:44] table so Ahab sent sent unto all the
[49:48] children of Israel and gathered the
[49:49] prophets unto Mount Carmel and Elijah
[49:52] came unto all the people and said how
[49:53] long halt ye between two opinions if the
[49:57] Lord be God follow him but if baale then
[50:00] follow him and the people answered him
[50:02] not a word and you could be seated may
[50:05] the Lord add His blessings to the word
[50:07] and over in 1 Corinthians 11
[50:11] verse1 Paul said be followers of me even
[50:14] as I also am Christ am of Christ and if
[50:19] you take that just a simple thought
[50:20] tonight what is leading
[50:22] Us and how long will you be caught or
[50:26] how long halt you between two opinions a
[50:29] lot of times we let
[50:31] influences cause us to question our
[50:34] leadership that's right and I'm not
[50:37] necessarily talking about local
[50:38] leadership I'm talking about uh what
[50:39] we're following in the message of the
[50:41] hour and what we're following today
[50:43] which I believe is a Vindicated message
[50:46] is that okay and so I want to just lay a
[50:49] little background here and like I said I
[50:50] won't hold you along tonight but just uh
[50:52] I want you to think about what are we
[50:53] following are we following just another
[50:55] denomination are we following just just
[50:56] another word because many have come with
[50:58] a word from the Lord and it's been false
[51:00] many have come with a uh you know they
[51:03] could with healing Ministries and and it
[51:05] would be false and some would come and
[51:07] they would point to themselves and we
[51:08] know if you do that then it's false and
[51:11] so many false prophets will arise and
[51:14] and you know say have not I done this
[51:16] and have not I done that but how do you
[51:18] know a true prophet and how do you know
[51:20] who to follow so brother brandom says it
[51:22] like this and we'll try to get somewhere
[51:25] maybe we'll tile this together if it
[51:26] make sense at some point he said that's
[51:28] the way it is of a man that's
[51:29] predestinated to eternal life when he
[51:31] sees the light of God there ain't enough
[51:33] organizations in the world to cluck him
[51:35] back into it can you say amen he said no
[51:37] why it's in his nature he might have
[51:39] been dieting with them a long time and
[51:41] eating their trash and socials but he
[51:43] comes to a place he's found something
[51:45] different so he knows it my sheep know
[51:48] my voice said Jesus and a stranger
[51:50] they'll not follow that might they might
[51:52] be following something strange but down
[51:55] in them there's something different let
[51:57] them hear the truth one time and watch
[51:59] them all the father has given me will
[52:02] come so you didn't come to the message
[52:04] by chance you didn't come and be and sit
[52:07] under this headship by chance you didn't
[52:09] come to the message just because your
[52:11] parents were in the message you say well
[52:13] that's what introduced me to the message
[52:14] well many people introduce you to the
[52:16] message that may fall themselves and so
[52:18] what that that doesn't really have
[52:19] anything to do with it God knew you
[52:21] needed this message and he knew you were
[52:23] predestinated for a Time such as this so
[52:26] so if you're sheep this afternoon and
[52:29] you've heard the sound of the shepherd
[52:31] then you can't follow another Shepherd
[52:33] you've heard the voice for your day and
[52:36] you cannot follow a strange voice can
[52:38] you say amen amen so I've seen I I I
[52:41] believe I saw this somewhere and I'm not
[52:42] even sure if I could find it now but
[52:44] there was a some people calling the
[52:46] sheep and they couldn't figure out the
[52:48] Sheep wouldn't ever respond it wouldn't
[52:49] come to them and the Shepherd that was
[52:51] over that flock went out there and
[52:52] called the sheep and and they just come
[52:54] running to him why it's some something
[52:56] on the inside of them that could
[52:58] recognize a voice for their day so we
[53:01] might we might hear all kinds of voices
[53:04] and and many of them could be close but
[53:05] there's nothing on the inside to respond
[53:08] to that voice so we know what's leading
[53:10] us is not what we want to follow but
[53:13] what is on the inside of us that is
[53:15] following the word for the hour and so
[53:17] what you'll find out today is you can't
[53:20] help but follow this message if there's
[53:22] predestination on the
[53:24] inside you can't help but see it because
[53:27] it wasn't your opinion that wanted to
[53:29] follow this message or your opinion of
[53:31] the message being right but something on
[53:33] the inside of you your friends can't
[53:35] talk you out of it Church can't talk you
[53:38] out of it a website can't talk you out
[53:40] of it we're following it because of
[53:42] something on the inside that is
[53:44] following something on the outside and
[53:46] it's a spiritual voice it's a it's a
[53:48] supernatural connection and there's no
[53:50] way for us to deny what is on the inside
[53:53] of us why because the seed is responding
[53:56] to the light of the
[53:58] hour if you plant a seed and the seed
[54:01] starts to grow and if if that seed you
[54:04] you you find out if Grass Grows and and
[54:06] the and the Sun Shines on it amen it'll
[54:08] it'll grow but then it needs the water
[54:11] and the water and the sun together
[54:13] you'll see the the water and the and the
[54:15] the the blood and the spirit and all
[54:17] these things we have to have together
[54:18] but if you take it from a natural thing
[54:20] and me if an acorn falls into the ground
[54:22] there's a seed of an oak tree there and
[54:24] it will grow why because it was it was
[54:26] already an oak tree amen it will become
[54:29] something that it was predestinated to
[54:31] become amen aren't you thankful for the
[54:33] message of predestination I'm thankful
[54:35] tonight that I don't have to depend on
[54:37] my goodness to know this message and I
[54:39] don't have to depend on my my family
[54:41] history or whether I could be in it or
[54:43] not or I don't have to worry about this
[54:45] flesh getting away why because though
[54:47] the devil would try to make me stumble
[54:49] and though the devil would try to make
[54:50] me fall I can't deny the message because
[54:53] I am the message of the hour the message
[54:56] is on the inside of me and it is living
[54:59] out through me is that okay so far today
[55:01] amen a stranger they will not follow
[55:03] brother brand would would actually quote
[55:05] John here he said John said Brethren
[55:07] there's one thing that I'm thoroughly
[55:08] convinced in we can tell the world from
[55:10] today that we're not following some kind
[55:12] of a quack well can you say man we're
[55:15] not following some false prophet some
[55:16] puffed up something that knows nothing
[55:18] but we're following God can you say man
[55:21] we're not following some false prophet
[55:22] listen this is a prophet that was so
[55:24] thoroughly Vindicated that even science
[55:27] had to say he was
[55:29] Vindicated and we think back and I just
[55:32] want to deal with this for a minute
[55:33] think think about intellectual faith for
[55:35] a moment and people say well I believe
[55:37] the Bible but I can't believe in a
[55:38] prophet and then we have more proof that
[55:41] this Prophet existed and we have more
[55:43] proof that his message is correct we
[55:45] have more proof of the pillar of fire
[55:47] being with him where was the cameras
[55:49] when Moses saw the burning bush come
[55:52] on so when you start saying well we
[55:55] don't have any proof of it I like to say
[55:56] today we do we do have proof of this
[55:59] message I don't need proof because I'd
[56:01] follow it anyway but we do have proof
[56:04] that God came in our day you say well I
[56:07] I can't believe that well then you can't
[56:09] believe the Bible either because it
[56:11] takes Faith to believe this am me it
[56:13] takes something on the inside of you
[56:15] people say well I I can believe Moses
[56:16] because it's written in the word what
[56:18] about a prophet that was that was
[56:19] foretold to restore all things well can
[56:22] you say am man tonight what about a
[56:23] prophet that was coming our day with a
[56:25] light that would follow his ministry
[56:27] just like Moses and just like John and
[56:30] he would ju and just like Paul amen and
[56:32] in our day we would actually be we we
[56:34] would be so blessed to be able to see it
[56:36] and hang it in the in the halls of
[56:38] Congress why we could because God saw
[56:41] fit to prove himself to this generation
[56:44] yes there's not going to be everybody
[56:45] following because not everybody's got a
[56:47] seed on the inside of them but if the
[56:49] seed is there and they've seen that God
[56:51] has been manifested today then they
[56:53] cannot turn away from it right is that
[56:57] okay today brother BR talks about that
[56:59] duck that was born in a chicken pin hey
[57:02] man he said that duck was he said he was
[57:03] a funny little fellow to them chickens
[57:05] kind of topheavy had a big
[57:08] Bill and he said you know that being he
[57:11] was topheavy had that bill for some
[57:12] purpose and he said that's the way I
[57:14] guess sometimes the Christians seems to
[57:16] be a little bit he said they're a little
[57:17] fanatically but he said that's there for
[57:19] a purpose see you know why I message
[57:22] people sometimes tend to be a little
[57:24] fanatical because there had to be
[57:26] something to accept a very Supernatural
[57:28] message that was coming on I hope that's
[57:32] okay today I know I know a lot of them
[57:34] went overboard and I know there's a lot
[57:35] of crazies around the message there's a
[57:37] lot of crazies in the Baptist Church too
[57:39] there's a lot of crazy people everywhere
[57:41] but you'll find there are there are
[57:43] certain uh there's a certain bunch of
[57:45] people in the message that you know
[57:46] there some of them are just crazy you
[57:48] know we were I hear I go off on one of
[57:50] my little tangents but we grew up around
[57:52] people where we we saw the pillar of
[57:54] fire more every day than anybody we saw
[57:55] the pill fire four five six times every
[57:58] morning and then throughout the
[57:59] afternoon and every time the AC unit
[58:01] would kick on we saw the pillar of fire
[58:03] and I'm not making fun of the pillar of
[58:05] fire I'm just saying we were we were we
[58:06] were crazy I mean and and and I got old
[58:09] enough to get away and I did but but you
[58:11] know what I'm saying is you know there's
[58:13] all kinds of
[58:16] impersonations there's all kinds of
[58:18] Fanatics that like to get right around
[58:19] the message just to try to try to prove
[58:21] it wrong and so what they're doing with
[58:24] their with their nonsense is actually
[58:25] bring bringing a uh they're bringing a
[58:27] bad light to the message and they're
[58:29] actually bringing a a reproach on the
[58:31] message well can you say amen and so
[58:34] what they're doing is they're they're
[58:35] they're over here and they go off on
[58:36] some limb of fanaticism and listen
[58:38] that's going to be around this thing
[58:40] that don't be looking at the Fanatics
[58:42] they're going to be here am mean that
[58:44] they're there for a purpose because
[58:45] there's going to be Believers make
[58:47] Believers and unbelievers and and I'll
[58:49] tell you what if you're at home alone
[58:51] then you might be all three because your
[58:52] flesh ain't converted yet but let me goe
[58:54] and tell you something God rich in Mercy
[58:57] saw fit to send a message in spite of
[58:59] the
[59:00] fanaticism in spite of the crazies that
[59:02] would come along and yes there's going
[59:04] to be all kinds of nonsense around the
[59:05] message why because it attracts all
[59:07] kinds but there will be a bride that
[59:10] will stay with the word and will follow
[59:12] thus sayth the Lord why because she has
[59:14] something on the inside of her that
[59:17] can't follow nothing else amen right so
[59:21] let's go on down here brother bam said
[59:22] that's the way with a Christian when
[59:23] he's born again see he comes out of a
[59:24] different egg that's all yeah we're just
[59:27] a little odd brother Bill nobody's ever
[59:30] accused me of being
[59:33] normal and I guess that's okay hey man
[59:36] I'm an oddball I you know we're just a
[59:39] little you know if you get rid of all
[59:41] the nuts what the what brother R say
[59:43] then all you got left is a bunch of yunk
[59:44] you know you just nothing you just
[59:46] you're just if without the oddballs
[59:47] where would we be somebody say praise
[59:50] the Lord for the
[59:52] oddballs thank you and he said he said
[59:56] many of them out here in these
[59:56] denominational churches that's genuine
[59:58] Ducks but they got a h leader well
[1:00:00] there's a bad place to
[1:00:01] be he said they got a hen leader that's
[1:00:03] right so they just don't get it that
[1:00:05] sounds rude he said but I don't mean it
[1:00:07] that way but he's trying to make a point
[1:00:09] now I'm getting somewhere I think but
[1:00:11] we'll get there eventually he said uh he
[1:00:13] said I'm trying to make a point he said
[1:00:14] one day she let him out a little too far
[1:00:16] behind the barn and there was some water
[1:00:18] running down behind the barn and he said
[1:00:20] a spring going out a creek and he he was
[1:00:22] going along there wondering what it's
[1:00:23] all about you know following the hint
[1:00:25] along and why he didn't even like the
[1:00:27] diet they were eating but he said it
[1:00:29] didn't look right to him and these old
[1:00:30] things that they they did it didn't seem
[1:00:32] right so after a while he happened to
[1:00:34] catch a breath and that smelled just
[1:00:36] right he said where did that come from
[1:00:38] oh that little Breath of Heaven he said
[1:00:40] catch that little breath of something
[1:00:41] that's refreshing a sermon that appeals
[1:00:43] to you that strikes down inside of you
[1:00:46] and feel the word anchor itself what can
[1:00:48] you say man he said Heavenly Sunshine he
[1:00:51] thought oh there's somehow another he
[1:00:53] said there's somehow another that breath
[1:00:55] that that I got fits my nature and he
[1:00:57] breathed it again and he said it's
[1:00:59] somewhere now you can't tell me it's
[1:01:01] somewhere I know there's something
[1:01:02] somewhere that I belong to not to this
[1:01:05] Creed see and he said you know what I
[1:01:07] mean he smelt water and his nature was a
[1:01:09] duck so a duck and the water just goes
[1:01:12] together and so when you heard this
[1:01:14] message you that that just smelled like
[1:01:16] water to you and you were a duck and you
[1:01:19] just had to be in the water I would just
[1:01:21] like to go ahead well I might be crazy
[1:01:22] it's okay but let me go aad and tell you
[1:01:24] something when I when I heard the voice
[1:01:26] of God for my day I didn't hear the
[1:01:28] voice of brother Brandon but I actually
[1:01:30] heard God speaking to my soul and
[1:01:33] something responded to the voice amen I
[1:01:36] can't help but believe it I've told you
[1:01:37] nobody can talk me out of it because
[1:01:39] nobody talked me into it and if if
[1:01:42] somebody could talk you out of this
[1:01:43] message I'm sorry to say maybe there's
[1:01:45] nothing on the inside of you and I I
[1:01:48] listen I don't I don't give up on nobody
[1:01:50] but I think we need to be careful what
[1:01:51] voices we're listening to but but if
[1:01:54] you're if you're elect you can't be
[1:01:56] deceived if you're elect there's nothing
[1:01:58] can take you out if you're elect you can
[1:02:01] fall down I love how brother Josh
[1:02:02] Bennett said it you can fall down but
[1:02:04] you can't fall away come on somebody
[1:02:07] amen this message excites the bride
[1:02:09] because we are part of this message amen
[1:02:12] it's not something a preacher preaches
[1:02:14] it's not something we just hear but it
[1:02:16] is part of us we are the message of the
[1:02:20] hour we are the message so the duck
[1:02:22] smelled water and he said he just
[1:02:24] couldn't help but go to the water
[1:02:26] and directly he got that other big whiff
[1:02:28] and he said it become a little more
[1:02:30] strong and after a while the wind began
[1:02:32] to blow like the rushing Mighty Wind you
[1:02:33] know and it began to blow the breeze
[1:02:35] right off the water to him and he
[1:02:36] couldn't stand it no longer down over
[1:02:38] the hill he went wobble wobble wobble he
[1:02:40] said you know he was going Hong Kon
[1:02:42] conon I wonder if there's not a little
[1:02:43] bit of noise around the Ducks when they
[1:02:45] find the water and he said that little
[1:02:48] Bill sticking up in the air he said he
[1:02:49] smelt water and the old hen said you
[1:02:51] fanatic get back here no good at all he
[1:02:54] done smelt the water and somebody
[1:02:56] already told you the message was
[1:02:57] fanatical and the message was wrong but
[1:02:59] you've already heard a voice and I'm so
[1:03:01] glad I heard the voice I I heard the
[1:03:04] song it said it sounded like a
[1:03:05] scriptural voice to me and it is and
[1:03:08] mean it is more than just the voice of a
[1:03:10] man but it was the voice of God to you
[1:03:12] that would accept it as
[1:03:14] such is that
[1:03:16] okay he said their Presbyterian Baptists
[1:03:20] and Pentecostals and so forth oh brother
[1:03:21] he said that's miserable a real
[1:03:23] Christian wants to get the freshness of
[1:03:24] the spirit the freshness of God in his
[1:03:27] life something that makes him a new
[1:03:28] creation and as soon as he can get to
[1:03:30] that outlet he'll drive over snowy
[1:03:32] grounds or anything else to get to it he
[1:03:34] said because he's a duck to begin with
[1:03:36] you know you wonder why in message
[1:03:38] churches you go to about any of them and
[1:03:39] you'll find people drive a long ways to
[1:03:41] get there that's right and I'm not
[1:03:43] saying any certain Church you should go
[1:03:44] to or shouldn't I'm just saying some
[1:03:46] people drive a long ways to get to
[1:03:47] church and when you see that you know
[1:03:49] they're they're doing that because I I I
[1:03:51] remember when I was driving from Hot
[1:03:52] Springs it was a little over three hours
[1:03:54] maybe three and a half hours and people
[1:03:56] would say well is there not a church
[1:03:58] good enough in hot springs for you you
[1:04:00] know and and the truth of it is you
[1:04:01] don't want to say no but the truth of it
[1:04:03] is when you when when you when you hear
[1:04:06] the word of God being preached and
[1:04:08] there's no ego about it that really is
[1:04:10] refreshing to the bride amen because
[1:04:14] it's not about me it's not about brother
[1:04:15] Stewart it's not about brother Ben it's
[1:04:17] not about this church it's about the
[1:04:19] whole body and we believe we want to see
[1:04:21] Souls saved we want to see this church
[1:04:23] grow we want to see this church more
[1:04:25] than just grow in numbers but grow in
[1:04:27] individuals we want to see the
[1:04:28] individuals become powerhouses as
[1:04:30] brother Brandon would call them amen
[1:04:32] that's that's a desire of ours and to
[1:04:34] see our young people become a mighty
[1:04:35] Army in this message but that is not the
[1:04:37] main thing the main thing is to
[1:04:39] strengthen the entire body why because
[1:04:41] there's no egos here amen it is all
[1:04:43] about the message of the hour right and
[1:04:46] so you'll see people that'll that
[1:04:48] they'll they they'll sacrifice a lot to
[1:04:49] get to church because you know maybe
[1:04:51] there's not jobs and and it's hard you
[1:04:53] know I mean it's just not easy sometimes
[1:04:55] being in the message because that's just
[1:04:57] the truth of it the fact is we're not on
[1:04:58] a picnic and we're in a Battleground and
[1:05:01] and sometimes the devil likes to fight
[1:05:02] Us in every way he can whether it's
[1:05:04] finances and whether it's sickness or
[1:05:06] you notice how the devil really makes
[1:05:07] people more sick on Sundays and he loves
[1:05:09] to fight you on Sundays and you know we
[1:05:11] had two Sundays in a row where there was
[1:05:13] snow on the ground on Sunday I tell you
[1:05:14] what the devil just loves to come on the
[1:05:16] weekend you know he's a weekend visitor
[1:05:18] and so he shows up and and he's always
[1:05:20] trying to affect a service and you know
[1:05:22] if you ever have some fault with
[1:05:24] somebody it seems like it it just
[1:05:25] happens just to be before a service or
[1:05:28] sometimes Before You Preach there's
[1:05:29] always something that somebody will rile
[1:05:31] you up about something or sometimes
[1:05:33] before you Y come on somebody maybe it's
[1:05:35] just me you know but sometimes if the
[1:05:37] devil's going to fight you he's going to
[1:05:38] do it he's going to try to affect you
[1:05:41] and then affect the whole church well
[1:05:43] come on somebody but let's focus on the
[1:05:46] word because it's true no matter how I
[1:05:48] feel it's true on my good days and it's
[1:05:52] true on my bad days it's true when I'm
[1:05:54] right and it's true when I'm wrong but
[1:05:57] it's true anyway it's all about God and
[1:06:00] this word is that okay tonight amen I
[1:06:03] believe that we need to start focusing
[1:06:04] on the main thing and keep the main
[1:06:06] thing the main thing amen amen the main
[1:06:08] thing is not me the main thing is not
[1:06:10] the pastor the main thing is him and if
[1:06:13] he's the main thing and and if he is the
[1:06:15] center of all things and I say we need
[1:06:17] to worship him when we come to the house
[1:06:19] of God and we need to realize that he is
[1:06:21] leading us and mean the Pastor might be
[1:06:24] your your local leader but ultimately
[1:06:26] he's under the leadership of the Holy
[1:06:27] Ghost and and he can only lead you as he
[1:06:30] follows Christ and I can only preach to
[1:06:32] you as I've been led to preach by by God
[1:06:35] himself listen church this is not about
[1:06:37] a man Amen brother brandham didn't come
[1:06:39] and preach his own message but he came
[1:06:41] and preached the message so that you
[1:06:42] could follow him as he followed the word
[1:06:45] why because he preached what Paul
[1:06:47] preached and he preached only what a
[1:06:49] prophet would preach anden it was the
[1:06:50] truth all the way through listen we can
[1:06:53] get all tied up about some little
[1:06:54] opinion or some little idea or we say a
[1:06:57] prophet had a personal preference on
[1:06:59] something amen you say well I don't like
[1:07:01] cherry pie well that ain't going to keep
[1:07:02] you out of the Rapture amen just because
[1:07:04] he drove a Ford doesn't mean you can't
[1:07:06] drive a Chevy but what I'm going to tell
[1:07:07] you tonight is the word was important
[1:07:10] that he brought amen then the word is
[1:07:12] still true that he brought it did not
[1:07:14] die in 1965 with a prophet but the word
[1:07:18] was always here and the word will always
[1:07:20] be here amen it was the in the beginning
[1:07:23] the Word was God and the Word was with
[1:07:25] God amen and then he became flesh and
[1:07:27] dwelt among us and then when he left he
[1:07:29] sent his spirit so that we could become
[1:07:31] the word of this hour I want to go ahead
[1:07:33] and tell you something I'm not following
[1:07:35] just another Creed but I'm following a
[1:07:37] Vindicated word that has been that that
[1:07:39] came to me and when I heard it on the
[1:07:41] inside of me I smelled the water I went
[1:07:44] running to the water I'm going to tell
[1:07:46] you tonight church I might be crazy here
[1:07:48] but I want to go and tell you something
[1:07:50] if God before me who can be against me I
[1:07:53] might be crazy but the world can call me
[1:07:55] that but in in heaven I've got a home
[1:07:57] prepared amen where the Saints abide and
[1:08:00] that's where I'm going that's where I'm
[1:08:02] going amen they might call our sisters
[1:08:04] oldfashioned they might call our
[1:08:06] brothers fanatics but I want to tell you
[1:08:08] something amen they can call you
[1:08:09] whatever they want to I've said it
[1:08:11] before I'll say it again when they call
[1:08:12] you on that one day when you're gone
[1:08:14] they're going to have to call you gone
[1:08:16] why because you're leaving in the moment
[1:08:18] in the twinkling of an eye that is the
[1:08:20] word that has been revealed to you and
[1:08:23] man we're not looking we're not looking
[1:08:24] for a new word we're not looking for a
[1:08:26] new Prophet well can you say Amen but
[1:08:29] we've already heard the voice of God and
[1:08:32] that was not William brandom's physical
[1:08:34] voice but it was God using a man and his
[1:08:37] voice to speak directly to the bride and
[1:08:39] call out a bride is that okay and I'm
[1:08:41] running out of time so let me get down
[1:08:43] here and try to get to where I'm going
[1:08:44] brother Brandon would go on down like
[1:08:46] this he said now God chose in the days
[1:08:47] of Exodus Amen in the days of Exodus he
[1:08:49] called out a group and out of that group
[1:08:51] he said I want you to notice something
[1:08:52] he only got two that went to the
[1:08:53] promised land what did he choose to take
[1:08:55] them out by politics organization he
[1:08:58] chose a prophet with a supernatural sign
[1:09:00] of a pillar of fire I want you to follow
[1:09:02] me closely here if you can amen and I
[1:09:04] and I won't hold you long I I really am
[1:09:06] being honestly serious about that and
[1:09:08] and if I lie to you forgive me and he
[1:09:11] said he chose a prophet with a
[1:09:12] supernatural sign of a pillar of fire
[1:09:14] that the people wouldn't be
[1:09:18] mistaken was the pillar of fire
[1:09:20] important for us to see yes so we
[1:09:22] wouldn't be mistaken about who our
[1:09:24] leader would be in this
[1:09:26] hour now I know some people don't like
[1:09:29] to say brother brandom's our leader
[1:09:31] Jezebel didn't like to
[1:09:33] say that she had a pastor
[1:09:36] either and I know people have taken that
[1:09:38] and went so far the other way and
[1:09:39] brother brandom's their pastor and they
[1:09:41] don't need a local Pastor I get all the
[1:09:42] nonsense listen
[1:09:44] fanaticism
[1:09:46] fanaticism and we do have local pastors
[1:09:48] and we we believe in a local Shepherd
[1:09:50] but we also know who came and who was
[1:09:53] the ultimate in our generation amen is
[1:09:56] that okay he chose a prophet with a
[1:09:58] supernatural sign of a pillar of fire
[1:10:00] that the people wouldn't be mistaken he
[1:10:04] said what the prophet said was the
[1:10:07] truth you can tell me all the mistakes
[1:10:10] you want to but a prophet came and said
[1:10:12] what the prophet said was the truth amen
[1:10:16] and so in the first Exodus that's how
[1:10:18] God showed his people who Moses was
[1:10:21] although the people didn't see the
[1:10:24] burning bush
[1:10:26] Moses comes in there with no
[1:10:29] photographic evidence of his
[1:10:32] experience he comes in there and he has
[1:10:34] no video of discernment happening he
[1:10:38] comes in there listen come come on
[1:10:40] somebody you know that it would be hard
[1:10:43] it it we got people can't follow the
[1:10:45] message now with all the Vindication and
[1:10:46] the signs and the tapes and the video
[1:10:48] and everything and you know so
[1:10:50] unbelievers are unbelievers sir but can
[1:10:53] you imagine these people you know they
[1:10:54] knew that God was going to send a
[1:10:56] deliver and they had been there for
[1:10:58] hundreds of years and and and all this
[1:11:00] time they're waiting on somebody then
[1:11:01] Moses shows up and and then he kills a
[1:11:04] man and flees out into the desert and
[1:11:05] he's gone for 40
[1:11:08] years and so you know look at look at
[1:11:12] the hope that you would have in this he
[1:11:14] comes back as an 80-year-old man saying
[1:11:17] that he saw a bush and this bush spoke
[1:11:19] to
[1:11:21] him you talk about Fanatics come on
[1:11:24] somebody
[1:11:27] y'all like well brother Joel you going
[1:11:29] to say anything interesting today
[1:11:30] probably
[1:11:33] not so he had a second Exodus how many
[1:11:35] knows there's a Third Exodus that we're
[1:11:38] living in brother bam taught that there
[1:11:40] would be a Third Exodus he's called it
[1:11:41] and he goes on and he talks about he
[1:11:42] says he says God always is perfect in
[1:11:44] threes he said you all notice he said
[1:11:46] it's always Threes And Sevens he said
[1:11:48] seven is completion and threes is
[1:11:49] perfection first second third PLL and he
[1:11:51] said everything justification
[1:11:53] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:11:54] father son Holy Ghost everything he said
[1:11:56] what did he do the first Exodus he sent
[1:11:58] a prophet Anointed with a pillar of fire
[1:12:00] and he called the people out that was
[1:12:01] his first Exodus and when Israel's time
[1:12:03] was up he sent again a prophet a god
[1:12:05] Prophet with a pillar of fire John saw
[1:12:07] it descending from heaven like a dove
[1:12:09] and he said I go to God I return to God
[1:12:11] and after his death burial and
[1:12:12] Resurrection Saul of Tarsus on his road
[1:12:14] down to Damascus saw that same Pillar of
[1:12:16] Fire and him being a Hebrew well taught
[1:12:19] in the word said well Lord who are you
[1:12:22] and he said he knew it was the Lord that
[1:12:25] the pillar of fire he he said he knew it
[1:12:27] was the Lord that Pillar of Fire he was
[1:12:28] a Hebrew said who are excuse me who are
[1:12:31] you and he said I am Jesus the second
[1:12:33] Exodus he brought a he brought a prophet
[1:12:35] anointed which was his son God Prophet
[1:12:37] Moses said he would be a prophet and had
[1:12:38] the pillar of fire and done signs and
[1:12:40] wonders and that same Prophet said that
[1:12:42] whosoever believeth in me the works that
[1:12:43] I do shall he do also and here he
[1:12:45] promised in the same things in The
[1:12:46] Exodus in the last days he cannot change
[1:12:48] it and by scientific proof by the
[1:12:50] witness of the Spirit by The Works of
[1:12:52] the spirit we see it today the Great
[1:12:55] Pillar of Fire moving Among Us and the
[1:12:57] signs and wonders of the resurrection of
[1:12:59] Jesus Christ calling the people from a
[1:13:01] denominationalism into the presence of
[1:13:03] Jesus Christ are you still with me to
[1:13:05] live going into a land he said there's
[1:13:08] no mistake friends it's not what I'm
[1:13:11] saying I'm just your brother but it's
[1:13:13] what God is proving to you what makes it
[1:13:16] the truth same Pillar of Fire he used
[1:13:18] for the other two he's brought it among
[1:13:20] you today and proved it by scientific
[1:13:22] now brother random goes into some detail
[1:13:24] here and I'll try to go through it
[1:13:26] quickly and he said as you know Life
[1:13:27] Magazine packed it last month he said
[1:13:29] how many was here and he goes on down he
[1:13:31] said there it is they don't know what
[1:13:32] it's all about the scientists are trying
[1:13:34] anybody got a picture of it he said it's
[1:13:36] called a cloud 26 mil high in the shape
[1:13:38] of a pyramid seven angels represent
[1:13:40] there and brought it back and brought
[1:13:41] you to the word of God under the
[1:13:42] inspiration it tells you these hours
[1:13:45] that you're coming and living in the
[1:13:48] spiritual mind will pick that up right
[1:13:50] now see and get it it's an exodus we're
[1:13:52] going to leave one of these days thanks
[1:13:56] be to God and I want to say that that
[1:13:58] was the last sign that would come to the
[1:14:00] Gentile
[1:14:01] church and the last sign that would come
[1:14:04] anden so there was a cloud listen I know
[1:14:06] there's been all kinds of discrepancies
[1:14:08] and people that don't believe in the
[1:14:09] cloud but I'd like you to go ahead and
[1:14:10] say if you're going to make that
[1:14:11] argument about the cloud I want to say
[1:14:13] that same argument for every scripture
[1:14:15] in the Bible and I'm going to go ahead
[1:14:17] and say it like this why would God
[1:14:19] vindicate a lie that's right why would
[1:14:22] God vindicate a lie but he came in this
[1:14:24] generation and Vindicated a true
[1:14:27] message and if the word is true I'm
[1:14:29] going to follow the word and if the
[1:14:31] sign's in the heaven and and and listen
[1:14:33] that picture that was taken it's still
[1:14:35] there today you can still go see it in
[1:14:37] Washington DC it's still in the archives
[1:14:39] today of the pillar of fire over brother
[1:14:41] brandom's head I know people don't like
[1:14:43] the picture because they think it's of
[1:14:44] the man but what about the Halo that was
[1:14:46] over his head that's what I'm pointing
[1:14:48] you to that was the
[1:14:50] [Applause]
[1:14:53] Vindication the vind indication was not
[1:14:55] the man the man a man can't vindicate
[1:14:58] himself Brother David but you're
[1:15:00] Vindicated by God is that okay brother
[1:15:02] brandom said I got 10 minutes I got more
[1:15:05] than 10
[1:15:06] minutes he said the pillar of fire that
[1:15:08] called them out LED in the promised land
[1:15:10] under the anointing of a prophet a
[1:15:11] pillar of fire that they could look at
[1:15:12] LED them to the promised land under an
[1:15:14] anointed prophet and they constantly
[1:15:16] turned him down he said is that right he
[1:15:19] said now I know he goes into wanting to
[1:15:22] quit again let me skip all that he said
[1:15:25] watch it we're in a calling out come out
[1:15:27] of Babylon my people said the Angel's
[1:15:29] voice out of what
[1:15:31] confusion people say the message people
[1:15:33] are confused I would like to go ahead
[1:15:34] and tell you we're the only people who
[1:15:38] ain't amen we're the only people that
[1:15:40] know that God sent a prophet that's
[1:15:42] right I asked a brother one time he was
[1:15:43] a UPC uh super uh district
[1:15:46] superintendent of uh of Arkansas and I
[1:15:49] asked him I said what is Malachi
[1:15:51] for and he still hadn't answered me
[1:15:53] that's been 10 years ago
[1:15:57] he could at least he didn't try to put
[1:15:59] it off on Malachi 3 right I mean he at
[1:16:01] least he knew better knew that it wasn't
[1:16:03] John the Baptist but he actually didn't
[1:16:04] know is what he told me he didn't know
[1:16:06] he said maybe it could be this and maybe
[1:16:08] this and it's possible over here and
[1:16:10] look at us we get to know because God
[1:16:12] showed it to
[1:16:13] us and I don't say those people aren't
[1:16:16] saved or won't make it amen but this is
[1:16:18] a bride time this is this is bride word
[1:16:21] this is bride food amen it tastes a
[1:16:23] little different than an Apostolic
[1:16:24] Church Church it tastes just a little
[1:16:26] different than than your Baptist and
[1:16:28] your Presbyterian and your Methodist
[1:16:29] churches amen it I'm not saying there's
[1:16:31] not Christians there Amen brother
[1:16:33] brandham said they that that duck was
[1:16:34] eating the diet of the hen amen there
[1:16:36] could be a duck in there too but let me
[1:16:38] go aad and tell you something this
[1:16:39] message will call out everyone that it's
[1:16:42] intended to call out and will'll be
[1:16:44] ready for a Rapture brother brandom said
[1:16:46] it will he said the Methodist ride or
[1:16:48] the Baptist or the Catholic right come
[1:16:49] out of he said God Is Right how do you
[1:16:51] know let every man's word be a lie and
[1:16:53] mine the truth out of it what do you
[1:16:55] know he said the same Pillar of Fire the
[1:16:57] same anointing Spirit leading to the
[1:16:59] promised land notice LED them brought
[1:17:01] them out LED them to the promised land
[1:17:03] he said Israel the nation and the same
[1:17:05] God the same Pillar of Fire he said they
[1:17:07] say well that that when you when you
[1:17:09] read George J Lacy not me he said you
[1:17:10] read where George la examine that
[1:17:12] picture the head of the FBI for his
[1:17:13] fingerprint documents there is his
[1:17:15] statement some of them says a double
[1:17:17] exposed lens tens of thousands of people
[1:17:18] have looked at it with their own eyes we
[1:17:20] stood here and looked at it you've
[1:17:22] looked at it and he said it it isn't
[1:17:25] said it was an optical illusion what did
[1:17:26] Mr Lacy say am me the mechanical eye of
[1:17:29] this camera won't take psychology he
[1:17:31] said it wasn't no optical illusion it
[1:17:33] was there and he said it's the same
[1:17:35] Pillar of Fire and then they said oh
[1:17:37] well that was a that was an illusion the
[1:17:38] cameras and all and for hundreds of
[1:17:40] miles of Tucson see the same people that
[1:17:42] called that Pillar of Fire a false and
[1:17:44] an illusion amen they called that cloud
[1:17:46] an illusion he said now for hundreds of
[1:17:48] miles of Tucson 6 months before it ever
[1:17:49] happened we told you by the Holy Spirit
[1:17:51] he would be going there to pick up the
[1:17:52] news because he said the writing on the
[1:17:55] outside there was a brother that had a
[1:17:56] dream and I don't have time to go into
[1:17:58] all that but he said he said now all the
[1:17:59] mysteries of justification
[1:18:01] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:18:03] was done explained he said now picking
[1:18:05] up the Loose Ends of that which was
[1:18:07] concealed in the Seven Seals not the
[1:18:09] seven Church ages the Seven Seals reveal
[1:18:12] the Mysteries and he said he then opened
[1:18:14] this thing up and he said he found a
[1:18:16] rock in there and white but he had never
[1:18:18] been rode on and it was a mystery and he
[1:18:19] said go to Tucson for tell it before it
[1:18:21] happen stand there north of Tucson and
[1:18:23] Witnesses standing there standing here
[1:18:26] with it when a blast come that shook the
[1:18:27] mountains off the ground almost and he
[1:18:29] said the same time a circle of light
[1:18:31] hanging Yonder in the air when the
[1:18:32] science took the pictures now 26 miles
[1:18:35] high about five times the distance of
[1:18:36] fog or anything could be and they can't
[1:18:39] find what did it he said and I love this
[1:18:41] he said it shall be light about the
[1:18:43] evening time the path to Glory you will
[1:18:46] surely find if you're elected and he
[1:18:48] said that seed falls upon dry grounds or
[1:18:50] upon rocks and it'll never do nothing
[1:18:52] hard Stony hearts that wants to be
[1:18:54] indifferent he said but if it'll fall
[1:18:56] upon the soft mellow ground of Faith
[1:18:58] it'll bring forth a Christian bearing
[1:19:01] the fruits of the spirit I'm so glad he
[1:19:03] found me I'm so glad that he sent his
[1:19:05] word and called me in my condition
[1:19:09] right you okay so far amen amen God Amen
[1:19:13] God vindicate God Vindicated himself in
[1:19:15] a pillar of fire in our day and the fact
[1:19:17] that the devil has come in and cause
[1:19:19] doubt Among Us and caused us to start
[1:19:22] questioning what we're following I know
[1:19:24] who we're following it's not a man it is
[1:19:27] Christ
[1:19:30] himself and so we don't look at the
[1:19:33] mistakes of men is that
[1:19:37] okay I know I wanted to come out here
[1:19:39] and just preach fun tonight but I got to
[1:19:41] preach what's on my heart is that
[1:19:42] okay he said why don't you go tell them
[1:19:45] scientists about that he said don't cast
[1:19:47] your Pearls Before
[1:19:48] Swine Jesus said not to he said I have
[1:19:51] no leadings to do it yet living right in
[1:19:52] the city there where they was calling
[1:19:54] for I thought I'd go down and he said
[1:19:56] the holy spirit said stay away it's not
[1:19:58] for them go back and tell the Tabernacle
[1:20:00] all right I want you to just notice this
[1:20:03] and I I am running out of
[1:20:05] time brother Danny told me to quit
[1:20:07] worrying about time I need to listen to
[1:20:10] you
[1:20:11] buddy he
[1:20:13] said I I love how brother brandom said
[1:20:15] it wasn't for them go back and tell the
[1:20:17] Tabernacle there was a place where he
[1:20:19] would go and store up food so that and
[1:20:22] he even says this and I know this is all
[1:20:24] taken out of everything's taken out of
[1:20:25] context in somewhere in some place and
[1:20:27] somehow he said I'm I'm storing up food
[1:20:29] so that you'll have something to
[1:20:31] eat and I believe in this day we have to
[1:20:35] be careful not to get to the opinion or
[1:20:37] the idea that we don't need to hear the
[1:20:39] tapes
[1:20:40] anymore because I absolutely believe
[1:20:43] it's essential for a Believer to hear
[1:20:46] the voice that was stored up on tape not
[1:20:49] because it's William bram's
[1:20:51] voice but the words that he spoke amen
[1:20:54] and I I just want you to know I'm not a
[1:20:57] deity guy I don't I'm not making him
[1:20:59] Jesus Christ because he said if you make
[1:21:02] me Jesus Christ you make me Antichrist
[1:21:05] but I do believe that the word of the
[1:21:06] hour is Christ himself not the man but
[1:21:10] the message and so I just go ahead and
[1:21:12] say it again today listen the devil's
[1:21:14] going to come after this message the
[1:21:16] devil didn't come after the man but the
[1:21:17] devil's coming after the message the
[1:21:19] devil don't want you to hear this
[1:21:20] message and so he'll put a seed of doubt
[1:21:22] in your mind amen that doesn't make you
[1:21:24] an believer but you need to cast down
[1:21:27] the doubts that are coming and feed on
[1:21:29] the body word of the son of man that has
[1:21:31] been revealed in your
[1:21:34] generation it's important it's
[1:21:37] imperative it's essential if there's
[1:21:40] ever been something you need to do anden
[1:21:42] you say well I hear a preacher three
[1:21:43] times a week I don't need the tapes
[1:21:45] anymore that's a mistake yes
[1:21:48] sir I hope this is
[1:21:51] okay Ben can come back and fix it all in
[1:21:56] way but I do believe that with all my
[1:21:59] heart that when you see a home that
[1:22:01] never plays the
[1:22:03] tapes and you see a home that has you
[1:22:06] know they just don't place any
[1:22:08] importance on that what you'll see is is
[1:22:13] that home begins to get
[1:22:14] cold and you won't see the young people
[1:22:18] grow up in
[1:22:19] Revival but what you'll see is a a dying
[1:22:22] and then the next thing you know people
[1:22:24] start talking them out of it well they
[1:22:25] never heard it how is this how's the
[1:22:27] how's the light ever going to strike the
[1:22:28] seed if you never see the
[1:22:30] light and
[1:22:32] so we go on down here
[1:22:35] and if that was a good preacher turn him
[1:22:42] up he said go back and tell the
[1:22:44] Tabernacle all right he said it shall
[1:22:45] come to pass if what that says comes to
[1:22:48] pass he said remember I have spoken the
[1:22:50] Lord says see before it happens see
[1:22:52] brother B goes on down here and he deal
[1:22:54] with this Third Exodus and I believe
[1:22:57] that's where we're at now he said here
[1:22:58] they are on the Third Exodus same sign
[1:23:00] same manifestation same Christ same Holy
[1:23:03] Ghost come on
[1:23:04] somebody he is the same in every detail
[1:23:08] but the Corporal body same Christ same
[1:23:10] Holy Ghost same work same God same
[1:23:12] message they can't take
[1:23:15] it they they just can't take it it's if
[1:23:18] they would if they would have known the
[1:23:19] scriptures shouldn't they have known
[1:23:22] that this Prophet was to come but they
[1:23:23] missed when Christ came the first time
[1:23:26] because they held on to to some kind of
[1:23:29] a Creed or a Dogma instead of
[1:23:31] recognizing the word of the hour that
[1:23:33] was the word made flesh for them and
[1:23:35] they missed it and today the word has
[1:23:38] been made manifest before your eyes you
[1:23:41] can't miss it if you're the
[1:23:45] elected amen there was people in Jesus's
[1:23:47] day that would catch that why because
[1:23:49] the light was walking around everywhere
[1:23:51] and those that would recognize the word
[1:23:54] that was among them would be blessed by
[1:23:56] that word and receive it and the next
[1:23:58] thing you know then when he went away I
[1:24:00] I I just love the fact that when he left
[1:24:02] Earth and he comes back in the spirit
[1:24:04] and me and Paul meets him as Saul on the
[1:24:06] road and he and he meets him there and
[1:24:08] he said I'm the one that you're
[1:24:10] persecuting I'm the one and he was what
[1:24:12] was he doing he was killing Christians
[1:24:14] but they were a part oh come on somebody
[1:24:16] they were a part of God's economy I'm
[1:24:19] the one you're persecuting I am Jesus
[1:24:21] Christ I am the word and then Paul would
[1:24:23] take the I loved what brother Stuart
[1:24:25] said this morning amen they all voted
[1:24:28] and they cast lots to to pick Mias and
[1:24:30] and they wanted to go a different route
[1:24:32] but would you notice something amen God
[1:24:34] had a man that was predestinate
[1:24:35] predestinated for the moment and
[1:24:37] predestinated for the time and he was a
[1:24:39] man that would be bold and without fear
[1:24:41] and would take the message for the
[1:24:43] church first church age amen and he
[1:24:45] didn't care what they thought of him and
[1:24:47] and and listen Church you you've got to
[1:24:49] be bold why because God has given you a
[1:24:51] word that's not going to be accepted by
[1:24:53] the masses but it's true
[1:24:57] anyway is that
[1:24:59] okay it's either it's either all of God
[1:25:03] or it's all wrong and if this message is
[1:25:05] wrong you better check your scriptures
[1:25:07] too right come on somebody I know when
[1:25:10] people leave the message they don't they
[1:25:11] don't like to hear that right but you
[1:25:14] know the truth of it is you know well if
[1:25:18] there's anything in them ones that have
[1:25:19] left they'll be back right if there's
[1:25:21] anything in them they'll be back don't
[1:25:23] be shaken
[1:25:25] by
[1:25:26] unbelief he said here they are same
[1:25:28] message same everything they had
[1:25:30] knowledge of the truth they looked and
[1:25:31] seen that it's absolutely the truth they
[1:25:33] can't deny it the magazines has test has
[1:25:35] to testify they've seen it the pictures
[1:25:37] the papers the evidence the resurrection
[1:25:39] of the Dead the doctor statements of the
[1:25:41] sick they have to say that it's him and
[1:25:44] the predictions not one of them have
[1:25:46] ever failing down through the years
[1:25:48] every one of them just exactly on the
[1:25:50] dot they can't say but what it's God but
[1:25:54] they can't accept it now brother Brandon
[1:25:57] would deal with this if I can find my
[1:25:58] spot again there brother Brandon would
[1:26:00] actually deal with this and he would you
[1:26:02] know the the Pentecostals would follow
[1:26:04] him through the signs and follow him
[1:26:06] with the Miracles and and followed him
[1:26:07] all the way up and man when it come to
[1:26:09] the opening of the word they couldn't
[1:26:10] accept it what was it they enjoyed the
[1:26:12] feeling of it they enjoyed the the
[1:26:15] healings that it brought amen but there
[1:26:17] was not anything on the inside of them
[1:26:19] to be attracted to the word I would say
[1:26:22] what is your attraction today it is
[1:26:24] Christ the word to the bride amen a
[1:26:26] feel-good emotion ain't going to be good
[1:26:28] enough for you but it is the word itself
[1:26:30] that has been recognized by something on
[1:26:32] the inside of you and you can't help but
[1:26:35] follow the light of the hour Amen
[1:26:36] brother brother brandom said the wise
[1:26:38] men still seek Him amen amen we're
[1:26:39] following the light and where the light
[1:26:42] is there's the body word under the light
[1:26:44] I would say tonight amen that the light
[1:26:47] has come and has showed us the word of
[1:26:49] the hour and we We've Come Just in Time
[1:26:51] listen Brother David you could have been
[1:26:53] in any generation but you were chosen
[1:26:55] for this time because God put something
[1:26:57] on the inside of you so that you could
[1:26:59] believe this end time message listen God
[1:27:01] wouldn't send a message if there wasn't
[1:27:03] somebody here to receive it we may not
[1:27:06] be the biggest group amen but there's
[1:27:07] more with us than be with them I've got
[1:27:10] God on my side no devil in hell can come
[1:27:13] against us and win why because we are
[1:27:16] more than enough with the word in our
[1:27:18] hearts amen the pillar of fire leading
[1:27:20] the way amen I'm so glad he found me I'm
[1:27:23] so glad that I know who I'm following
[1:27:26] what is leading me it is Christ the word
[1:27:29] nothing can move me none of these things
[1:27:31] move me amen we read that a couple weeks
[1:27:34] ago there's not going to be anything
[1:27:36] that can take me away amen from this
[1:27:38] message why because none of them things
[1:27:40] amen all the doubters can fall if they
[1:27:42] want to but that's not going to shake me
[1:27:45] amen nothing can shake a supernatural
[1:27:47] faith in a Vindicated
[1:27:51] message yes sir
[1:27:55] and so I like that in in that scripture
[1:27:57] we read he said how long halt ye between
[1:28:00] two opinions if the Lord be God follow
[1:28:05] him yes so I would pose the question
[1:28:07] tonight not to minister questions but I
[1:28:10] believe we have the answer
[1:28:13] sir if we know who we're following today
[1:28:16] is he
[1:28:18] God come on
[1:28:20] somebody is it God I know Gabe and
[1:28:23] Millie's not here here tonight she
[1:28:25] wasn't supposed to have that baby but
[1:28:27] she's going to have that baby
[1:28:28] tomorrow you say the signs don't follow
[1:28:30] the Believers I say they still do yes
[1:28:32] sir why because God's still God and he
[1:28:35] changes not that's not a Vindication of
[1:28:37] anything except that God is still more
[1:28:40] than enough for his people amen every
[1:28:42] devil can come against you but God is
[1:28:44] still God Amen listen church I I know
[1:28:48] this has cut up and this has went all
[1:28:49] over the place tonight but let me just
[1:28:51] go ahead and tell you something we need
[1:28:53] to recognize that we are not defeated
[1:28:55] amen we know who we're following am many
[1:28:59] are going to fall away and die in the
[1:29:00] wilderness but we're following amen
[1:29:02] we're like Joshua amen he would that is
[1:29:05] the holy spirit today brother brandom
[1:29:06] said and we're following our Joshua and
[1:29:08] Caleb said give me that mountain anden
[1:29:11] the faith that we have now is more than
[1:29:14] just a faith in an intellectual gospel
[1:29:16] but it is a supernatural faith in a
[1:29:19] Vindicated message amen I say give me
[1:29:22] that mountain give me my children give
[1:29:25] me my healing well come on somebody I
[1:29:27] say give me the desires of my heart
[1:29:30] speak and go forward why because
[1:29:32] everywhere that The Souls of your feet
[1:29:34] are going to step is your possession I
[1:29:37] say keep following a message and that
[1:29:39] message is going to lead you to a
[1:29:41] Promised Land amen I believe that we're
[1:29:43] in the land of promise now where all the
[1:29:45] promises lay it's the message of the
[1:29:47] hour and I believe we've been LED here
[1:29:49] by the pillar of fire and the word is
[1:29:51] true listen the messenger might be gone
[1:29:54] but the message is still alive come on
[1:29:56] somebody and if you go by way of the
[1:29:58] Grave let your just hold that Faith up
[1:30:01] until the end that your children are
[1:30:02] going to follow this light listen Church
[1:30:04] give me that mountain it's my faith it's
[1:30:07] my message it's who I am I'm part of it
[1:30:11] I can't stay on the other side of Jordan
[1:30:13] I'm going all the
[1:30:16] way give me my mountain tonight because
[1:30:19] I know what is leading me and I know
[1:30:22] what is leading me is not going to lead
[1:30:23] me to be destroyed by Giants but what is
[1:30:26] leading me is leading me to a land of
[1:30:28] promise that is Flowing with milk and
[1:30:30] honey and what is leading me is leading
[1:30:32] me into a place where all the promises
[1:30:35] lay what is leading me today into the
[1:30:38] word of the hour is showing me that the
[1:30:40] Mysteries have been revealed amen I I
[1:30:42] just wish we could stay here for a

[1:30:46] being led by something more than just a
[1:30:49] preacher well come on somebody we're
[1:30:51] being led by something more than a
[1:30:53] personality something more than just a
[1:30:55] healing evangelist but we are being led
[1:30:57] by the message that God sent himself in
[1:31:01] this generation amen it is to call you
[1:31:03] out and it is to set you aside and it is
[1:31:06] to get you prepared for a Rapture amen
[1:31:08] if anybody needs a Rapture I say the
[1:31:10] bride does because we're getting tired
[1:31:12] of being here where the devil has taken
[1:31:14] up presidence but we're going to get out
[1:31:16] of here one of these days and brother
[1:31:18] brandham said I believe that and he said
[1:31:20] Believers believe listen we're going to
[1:31:22] go see the one that we're fighting for
[1:31:24] and we're talking about and we're
[1:31:26] believing in this is not just another
[1:31:28] message but it is the last message to
[1:31:31] the last Church to get ready for a
[1:31:33] Rapture I hope you're with me tonight so
[1:31:36] far anden I'm just about done but I want
[1:31:38] you to know what when the light of God

[1:31:42] there ain't enough organizations in the
[1:31:43] world to take it out of you listen I
[1:31:45] want to go ahead and tell you tonight if
[1:31:47] it's in you the devil can't take it out
[1:31:49] of you if you've been called to this
[1:31:51] message the devil can't make you turn
[1:31:53] aside this message I know there's going
[1:31:55] to be naysayers I know there's going to
[1:31:56] be those fall away but I can't be shaken
[1:32:00] I can't be moved I'm standing on the
[1:32:02] Rock of Ages and my faith has never been
[1:32:05] stronger in the message of the hour why
[1:32:08] I look in the mirror and I see a man
[1:32:09] with faults and failures but I'm not
[1:32:11] looking at the man's faults and the
[1:32:12] failures but I'm looking at a promised
[1:32:14] word that has coming this generation he
[1:32:17] is leading me amen and if he's leading
[1:32:21] me I can't lose that's right where he
[1:32:24] leads me I will follow my sheep know my
[1:32:28] voice amen we're following god brother

[1:32:51] Giants were too
[1:32:52] big and Caleb CB heard all the
[1:32:55] doubters but Caleb's Faith wasn't
[1:32:58] shaken Caleb would go over there and say
[1:33:00] give me that
[1:33:02] mountain and if you know what's leading
[1:33:04] you when you need that faith brother
[1:33:06] Bill that faith will rise up and say
