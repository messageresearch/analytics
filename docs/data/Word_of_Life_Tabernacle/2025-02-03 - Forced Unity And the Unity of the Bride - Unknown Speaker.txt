things Lord we pray in jesus' name amen amen God bless you we're going to go to Genesis 11 and verse 1 Genesis 11 And1 and uh kind of continue what we talk talked about this morning but just a little bit different vein as we talk about the unity of the bride and also forced Unity forced unity and contrast that with the unity of the Bride aren't you glad to be Marching In step with the word of the Lord that's where we want to stay right in the perfect will of God Genesis 11 And1 says the whole earth was of one language and of one speech and it came to pass fast as they journeyed from the East that they found a plain in the land of Shar and they dwelt there and they said one to another go to let us make brick and burn them thoroughly they had brick for stone and slime they had for Mortar and they said go to let us build us a city and a tower whose top May reach unto Heaven listen to this let us make us a name lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth of course you know how the story ended they were confused in their language unable to complete their project and divided all over the face of the earth I pray the Lord with that his Blessing to the word you may be seated if you were to go to a Catholic church and not to knock on the Catholics because there are brother brandom taught us that there are good people among them in that group in that system but the system is rotten right but if you were to go to a Catholic Church in Chicago or in LA or in Rome or anywhere else in the world chances are you would hear the same scripture read and the preacher would be preaching the same thing anywhere you would go uh in Catholic online says it this way is the Catholic Mass the same everywhere in the world and it says the structure of the mass has two parts the Liturgy of the word the Liturgy of the Eucharist so they're very formal in their worship and it says the Liturgy of the word celebrates the word of God we hear one or two readings from the Bible plus a Gospel reading uh and the readings are the same everywhere uh except for some Churches have different feast days the the second part is Liturgy of the Eucharist which they believe that's the literal body and blood of the Lord that they're that they're eating of course we know that's not true we know it's a a symbol of the body and blood of the Lord but they believe that's the literal body and blood of the Lord Lord so they take what they call the mass the the Eucharist and it follows the prayer of the faithful where they celebrate the Lord's sacrifice said this Mass happens everywhere every day in Catholic churches throughout the world and they look at that as one of the greatest aspects of the Catholic Church wherever you go in the world you can attend Mass oh it's the same as it would be if you were at your local Parish so if I'm a Catholic and I stop in a church somewhere in uh overseas uh it may be in a different language but the same exact MTH and what that is is a forced Unity right a forced Unity so if they don't do that if they would deviate from that they would be removed from their position we don't want to ever get that way in the message of the hour but I have a freedom tonight to preach what the Lord lays on my heart a and the ability to preach and maybe brother Jason uh preached this morning from a different text than I did or brother Matt might preach from a different text than what I would but we have a freedom to do that we are not a in a forced Unity but we're under the headship of the word so we don't we don't have to all take the same approach or the same uh the same ideas or anything like that the same opinions but we want a Unity of the word so when they uh built the Tower of Babel they did that for the purpose they said let's make us a name let's create us a city and that city was Babylon which becomes mystery Babylon Revelation chap 17 it said There came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials and talked with me saying unto me come hither I will show unto the the Judgment of the great that sth upon many Waters with whom the kings of the Earth have committed fornication and the inhabitants of the Earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication he said he carried me away in the spirit Into the Wilderness I saw a woman sit upon a Scarlet colored Beast full of names blasphemy having seven heads and 10 horns excuse me the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet color and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls and she had a golden cup in her hand full of Abominations and filthiness of her fornication and upon her forehead was a name written mystery Babylon the great the mother of harlots and Abominations of the earth now we're all we've been around long enough we know what this is that's that denomination that Roman system right she sat on seven heels it's very apparent from the scripture who she is even the Catholics if you pull up their commentaries tell you that that's Rome even the Catholics will tell you that that's Rome so it's the the Catholic church and her daughters so she has daughters and brother bam taught us that that was the names of blasphemy was the names of the denominations that they had made they made themselves a name but we don't worship under the name of William brandom or the name of Ben prid or the name of Word of Life Tabernacle that's not what we worship under we don't worship under the name of brother so and so's church we worship under the name of the Lord Jesus Christ in in the place where he put his name which was in Jesus Christ now so that's what we worship under now when Paul instructed Timothy he he never give him a list of scriptures to read right right when you going have to help me preach tonight he he never gave him a a quota of how many scriptures there was never a h a letter from Paul that said Timothy I want you to deal with this scripture um Sunday and this one the next Sunday and this one the next Sunday what did he tell Peter he said I Char or Timothy rather I charge thee therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ who will judge the quick the alive and the dead and his appearing in his kingdom preach the word yes he said I'm commanding you to do something preach the word Don't Preach your ideas don't say something different don't come after some new idea preach the word preach what you've been taught in one place he said preach those things that teach those things you've heard of me among many witnesses preach the word preach where we can say it in this day say what's on the tape say say what the tape say say what the messenger said preach the word be instant in season out of season reprove rebuke exort with all longsuffering and Doctrine but there's nobody telling us what to how to do that because that would be a forced Unity right would take us right back into the Catholic church and we don't want that church we want we want to be listen I want to fellowship with everybody but I don't want anybody sitting here and tell me because I believe God's big enough to let me know what you need and to tell me and maybe if I'm not if I'm not tuned in like I should be maybe brother Joel or brother Stewart or one of the other brothers will come by and preach to you and preach exactly what you have need of why because we don't tell people what to preach we're under the leadership of the Holy Ghost sons of God are led by the spirit of God right so we don't want that coming here we want we don't want forced unity in any way shape or form or we'll all listen to the same preacher or the same tape or read the same scriptures or take communion at the same time it's not what the Bible teaches right brother Brandon taught us to be United with the word yeah when brother preach uniting time and sign he preaches this said teach me thy or he reads this as a text Psalms 8611 teach me thy way oh Lord I will walk in thy truth unite my heart heart yes what did the what did what did the messenger come to do to turn the hearts back right so David Cries Out unite My Heart To Fear Thy Name I want my heart to be United I not not a United head not a not a group think not a think like somebody else and have church when everybody else wants me to but let let my heart be United to the word and if my heart is United to the word I won't be deceived I won't be tossed by every window of Doctrine so let me be United with the word whether whether so and so believes it or not whether everybody else is doing it or not if everybody else gives up what am I going to do my heart's been United with the word and if everybody else leaves the message I can't leave why because my heart is united with the word it's not my head it's not just my thinking but my heart yes oh my that's what I want said unite my heart yes now brother manister we know the holy Holy Ghost is here we know the Holy Ghost is life oh I believe that tonight but Brethren do you realize it's only working in a stump no he's talking that Pentecostal church that unrestored church right or partially restored church he said did you think that you realize that's a part my friend the spirit is only working a stump the Bible said it would be a stump he said what is it we've got disunified body we've got Brotherly Love scattered from side to side he said weigh down in the heart of every born again man this morning morning in their hearts they want to embrace one another in their hearts they want to oh my I've seen so many people that wanted to love one another and spend time together and have meetings together you know what gets in the way preachers a lot of the time that's what gets in the way and I think some of us need to get down on an altar and recognize that it's not about us anymore it's about the word unite My Heart Lord to the unity of the word yes but the he said brother BR said there's many a preacher that belongs to churches of different denominations would love to walk in here this morning take the Oneness and Tess and threeness and forget their differences he said but what is it what's keeping them from it their organization if they get caught in that Bunch they'll get excommunicated he said that's a false Unity yes that's a false Unity the Bible said so again he said so now the great Harlot of Revelation 17 these balum teachers with their false Doctrine is marrying the church into that kind of a man yes he said watch when it comes to The Showdown of the end time look at the weakness of it now he said 900 and something different organizations one pulling one way one the other no Unity among them and they're trying to bring Unity not backed by the word of God God's original plan they're taking in by politics and organization so again go back to the vision brother BR saw the preview of the Bride what was it a witch leading them leading them separated by Nations separated by different things and he's leading their denom ational system and it's a forced Unity but you and I do not have a forced Unity we never will right right because brother brand said they won't there won't be another denomination we're at the end right the wheat has come back to the wheat again and it's time to get in the grain amen but I know people will make it organizations and things around the message but the message will never denominate right so we don't want to forced unity and that goes down even to the local churches we bring it on down we focus on down today realize that goes down even to our relationships with one another even our marriages everything about it is not a forced Unity huh right if the only reason that you're married is because you got a piece of paper that says you're married that's a problem so well I have to be married to her cuz the law says you know no it ought to be a Unity of the heart a Unity of the heart it says no matter what come good or bad rich or poor we're going to stay together that's the way it ought to be with us in this message that's the way it ought to be with us in the word of God a Unity of Heart Lord I I'm not going to I'm not just going to get mad cuz the preacher says something I don't like or maybe somebody says something I don't understand I'm just going to get mad and leave no I want a Unity of the heart where I I'll serve the Lord no matter what the preacher says no matter what the somebody else says no matter what they do let me serve God right he said it's weak because it's not God's original plan they're taken in by politics and organization God don't change his mind he stays right with his word he said heavens and earth will pass away but my word won't he said he stays with his original word they made themselves a name but God put his name in Christ yes amen and brother brandom and it'll do you good to go and and and listen to God's provided place of worship if you haven't heard that in a while that's a wonderful sermon because brother brandham deals with that and so many people think well this is where the bride's got to be gathered and this is where it's got to be brand said I'll tell you where it'll be it'll be in Christ it'll be in Christ it'll be you being gathered to the word and me being gathered to the word and everybody around the world being gathered to the word and then we'll get along with one another because we're Christians because we've been gathered to the word again he said we see this forced religion right in view to bring all the little groups into one great Unity they call it some of them that believe in this and some believe in that some deny this and some deny that the Bible said how can two walk together except they be agreed it'll never work we've got to be in an agreement and what in agreement with what not in agreement with one another as much as we got to be in agreement with the word see the problem is we thought we could only fellowship with those we agreed with personally on yeah in reality what he's looking for is an agreement of the word yeah what's your standard what do you go back to yes right not not our personal feelings about one another but what is what do we go back to the word of God right the the message of the hour he said we got to be in agreement with the word with God that's what it's got to be in agreement with he said we find out a forced Unity was represented by groups of people at Babylon he said God cannot put his name in such a thing as that he never did and he never will oh they tried it they put their name into it put his name into it but it's not so they can call themselves The Church of God or the Church of Christ or the Church of Jesus Christ whatever they want to call it the Catholic church but brother BR said we're the real Catholic church right Catholic means Universal we're we're the we're the bride of Christ but we're what is it h what is it it's a false Unity they put his name on it but he didn't put his name on it anybody can call themselves Mrs PR but I gave a ring to one woman I United in marriage with one woman I'm United in heart with one woman yes are you with me now and he's United with one bride and we're not separated by Church names yes sir we're not separated by Word of Life Tabernacle some other Tabernacle we are only we are bound together by cords of love that's why we ought to care for one another and and care what goes on in elsewhere and and care for each other and about each other yes the only thing keeping you together I don't know why I'm going back to this but the only thing keeping you together in your marriage is that marriage certificate you've got a problem I mean that's good you're staying together it's better than separating better than divorcing but why don't you get United in heart again come back to a place where you begin to have some agreement and you find out your little disagreements fade away when you find out what have in common we don't we don't want a forced Unity or a false Unity we want a true Unity with the word 1 Corinthians 12:12 Paul said as the body is one and hath many members and all the members of that one body being many are one body so also is Christ for by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether we be Bond or free we've all been made to drink into one spirit see my body is made of many different members but we all drink the same water yes right the body is not one member but many if the foot shall say because I'm not of the hand I'm not of the body is it therefore not of the body and Paul begins to continue talking about the differing parts of the body and how that just because they're different doesn't mean that they're not in unity it just means they need to learn to work together right listen to Just because you're different you young people just because you're one's different from from the other that don't mean you can't be in unity it just means you got to learn to work together yeah because if you get to a place where your hand don't work with your arm you got a problem right if you get to a place where your foot don't want to work with you no more but JT it's a problem isn't it you you just don't want to receive commands no more but I want my my whole part of the body to receive the command from the brain from the head which is Christ and let me work with another part of the body who's not the same as me right but yet is part of the body so Paul continues talk about the differing parts of the body and and so we realize our unity in Christ is not based on sameness right brother Brandon said God's not a Sears and robu Harmony House we're just not all going to be the same right it's just not going to be that way you know if you've been to one McDonald's you've been to about all of them and I pointed out to my daughter Melody who still cares about McDonald's and her life and and uh the rest of us are done with it you know we're over McDonald's but Brit or Melody Britney Melody still likes McDonald's and and so I pointed out to her there's one in Jonesboro that's a little bit different it's got the Arches still I pointed that out to her the other day and boy she wanted to go there because it was different you know but you go in almost any McDonald's in the world I've been in McDonald's in the Philippines and I got me an egg McMuffin it tasted good it tasted exactly like an Egg McMuffin in at the McDonald's right down here right right why it's sameness uniformity that's not what God does right but God gives us the ingredients and lets us make the dinner does that make sense he gives us the ingredients and then we get to and he said don't add to it don't take away from it but but it has a little maybe a little more seasoning here a little more seasoning there and he does that God calls men to certain areas he calls certain groups of people to work together why does he do that because he knows that they can work together for a certain purpose it's part of the body One Church might shout a little bit more than somebody else one Church might have a little bit different kind of music and if we're not careful we let our preferences dictate who we fellowship with and really we ought to fellowship with anybody who will Fellowship around the atonement the fact that Jesus died for my sins and he's the same yesterday today and forever he can still heal you he can still save you we believe the message of the hour there's things we can Fellowship around yes are you with me now yeah and we move the same direction though we would disagree bitterly in some are but we're one body as long as we don't try to bring uniformity of thought that's not what we do we're never going to think the same about everything because we've all been through different things we'll get to that maybe a little bit later how does an I I'm not going to hold you long tonight so y'all going to have to listen fast how does an earthquake happenes anybody know you know matne how an earthquake happened that is exactly the tectonic plates smashing together that's exactly what I had written down I'm glad I was right that's good man the tectonic plates I remembered that somewhere in the non-schooling that I did I remembered the words tectonic plates you know and I I put the that in my mind that and I had to go look it up to see if it was right so he knew it I figured he did tectonic plates come together and when they do they they against one another right and when they do it produces friction and and and they'll pull and they keep pulling and right now there's a I seen an article this week said get ready Missouri well they've been saying that for 200 years because we haven't had earthquake in a long time but they're saying Get Ready Missouri there's about to be an earthquake why because that strain is there and they know it's there and it's just in a bind and one day it's going to shake that's right and why is it going to shake because you got two opposing forces grinding against one another and we call that a fault line right that's a fault line now all of us have fault lines in our lives churches have fault lines people have fault lines in their Fellowship there's fault lines in marriage and I don't have time to address all of them tonight but there's some places especially as a body where these fault lines meet a and and and you'll see people just start to grind against one another but the good thing would be if it just rub off all the all the rough edges and we could be one one right though we're maybe different people but we could be one but but the tectonic plate if you look at a map of the tectonic plates you'll find that there's one that ends right there at California that's why they have so much trouble there there's a tectonic plate that ends right there a plate just right at the edge of the ocean just just changes and there's another plate and they just come against one another so we don't want to be that we want to move the same direction though we're different but we're all under one headship we're all following one leader we've all heard the same duck if you go back to what I said this morning and we're following him back to the Homeland yes we all heard the same certain sound amen and we're going back to a place we're going to meet in that City one day right and but these fault lines come because of our Humanity right our souls have been saved right and I talked to Brothers Brothers two-thirds of us not been saved and so our souls have been saved our bodies have not our Spirits have not and that's why you you got to be careful getting a religious spirit on you cuz your spirit hasn't been saved and if it's not under control of the Soul you get a religious spirit on you and think you're better than everybody else right and pretty soon what all that's happening is you've gotten a religious spirit and it's just as carnal as anybody else right right just as carinal as a drinker and the smoker and anybody else though you may look great but you're just as carnal as anybody else because it's a religious spirit God help us not to be that way but to let the inner man control the outer man then there will be peace and love and joy and contentment and all of those things good so so those plates move the opposite in the opposite direction creates a fault line and there's fault lines just as human humans a major fault line among humanity is race yeah right race is a fault line and uh you know but I want you again to call your attention back to the vision brother BR said they all March together yes right all the bride March together you know that all Races come from Noah's Three Sons right all Races come from Noah's Three Sons so brother Brenham tells us this and I know some of you sitting there thinking some of you well educated message people sitting there thinking well you know there was the serpent seed well think about it all Races come from Noah's Three Sons they're the only ones come across the ark brother the B said serpent seed come across through the women so we that's settled right but but but so everybody goes back to Noah y right and and through that everybody goes back to Adam yeah right everybody got the same blood it's all mixed up don't be sitting there trying to think you're better blood than somebody else you're not I'm not we were Gentiles we were out of the Ark of Safety we were away from the away from the mercies of God and God called us brother said with clubes on our back and everything else and going out there and wars and everything else and God called us out of that to his wonderful Kingdom to be his bride he elected Us by grace to be that it's only by grace sister Bethy we can ever become anything in God's kingdom that's all it can be we want to we preach the truth we try to live the truth we try to do A's right but it'll only be by grace that we're going to make it but Brandon said if you get to the other side of the river and you find me he said you'll find me singing Amazing Grace how sweet the sound that saved a Wretch like Me that was me I know I was lost but now I fin was blind but now I see every one of us has got to come out of something right every one of us has a background but we all come from one blood from Adam that's right that's what brother Brandon teaches say the little denominational barriers keep our fellowship apart but God loves us just the same we're his children his grace overrides the whole thing and he loves us all whether we're white brown yellow black it doesn't make a bit of difference to him we all come from one person Adam you realize there's different cultures and different things and we could get into that and how we God made us beautiful like that he didn't he didn't necessarily want everything all mixed up but he wants to all get along right right so he said whether we're white brown black or yellow we could transfuse blood to each other yeah right you know when I see a mother and a father struggling with their baby and I see that here in the States and how they care for that baby and I can go all the way to the other side of the world and preach to those people and they and they have the same care for their baby for their little one as what the mother and father does here here it's the same and they're completely different completely different Lifestyles different jobs different education no no different and praying for a little baby over there and praying for a little baby over here it's the same yeah they both believe God's A Healer right they both believe in in in what the Bible says if you lay hands on the sick they shall recover right and so we see maybe a miracle here a miracle over there and it's the same God are you with me now the same care though that they have for one another and you look at that and realize that that that that we're much more the same than we are different and we could save each other's life even by blood transfusion but I'm so thankful that one come he said who was made different from all of us you realize there oh my we have our different races and things but God wanted a super race a master race and he didn't create it by the way Hitler wanted to create it how did he do it he become the lowest of the low he didn't steal in his way to power but he become the lowest of the low and he created a Pat with his own blood Hallelujah by interjecting his own blood not by sexual Union but by the power of the Holy Spirit his blood is on every one of us making us new oh my we could transfuse blood to each other save each other's life by blood transfusion but I'm so thankful aren't you thankful tonight that one come who has made different from all of us and through the transfusion of his blood We Live Forever The Lord Jesus who was neither Jew nor Gentile he was God yes I know there's people in the message would fight me on that but he was God the Bible says we're saved by the blood of God right brother said it was emanuel's blood yes Oh my he say so we're so thankful for that breaking down all the middle walls of partition and bringing us into one lovely Fellowship together the Bible says he ha made of one blood acts 17:26 all someone say all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the Earth and hath determined the times before appointed so in other words the times that they would be born in and the bounds of their habitation where they would be born he determined that yeah right brother brand said it this way he said he knew the place and time the bed and time that you would be planted in right he already knew that but here he said this is the scripture for you it's determin the times before appointed and the bounds of their habitation God allowed us to live where we live and be what we are we should be happy with that we should not try to change it be something we're not but God knew everything about us even the color we would be before the foundation of the world do you know God knew the color of your hair do you know that I know some of y'all like me you know you wish you had a different color hair you wish you had hair don't you yeah I saw that I wish I had hair some of us would like to start a Hair Club for Men you know you know we we just like to have hair I thought about it I had a man last week take me aside and just to tell me uh the church I was preaching at they have those spotlights and I guess one was shining blind in him and he made sure after service to come in pastor's office and tell me that but he was he was joking with me but I you know I was I said hey you know we've all got our problems you know but God knew what color of hair I had and brother brand said he knew every one I lost and where it's at he said I haven't lost one of them praise the Lord but but and I don't want to Blind nobody but I can't help it God just made me this way you know but God allowed us to live where we live and be what we are and he knew the color of our hair brother R said you the color of hair you have the color eyes you have the stature that you're in God seen you before the foundation of the world now I'm not preaching this for Doctrine but I just want you to understand this this is why I've taught my daughters you're beautiful like you are you don't need a bunch of stuff right to be beautiful your hair is beautiful why God made you with that hair your your face is beautiful God made you with that face and you're beautiful the way you are and I'm so thankful that God God made us with a with a design with a purpose in our hearts amen we're all different well you know some people are more intense and some people smile all the time and some people are happy and and I look at some of these little kids they just make me happy to look at them you know and some like to dress up and some don't like to dress up but but that's part of it we're different but God made us to be one body he said we all come from one we come from the mind of God if you're the bride you come from the mind of God before the foundation of the world God seen you he's seen you a human being like you are he said and though there come a million years yet he said there's nothing can keep you from coming back to that Perfect Image that God ordained for you in the beginning hear me Church there's nothing that can keep you from coming back to that image no matter what happens in the meantime there is nothing that can separate you from the love of God yeah Hallelujah he said my sheep hear my voice a stranger they will not follow the Sheep will follow the shepherd all the way back to their original condition brother Jeff isin't that wonderful don't don't you want to go back I want to go back to my original condition I want to go back to the thought he had in his mind of me yes amen Revelation 5 and9 says they sung a new song saying thou worthy to take the book and open the seals there for th was slain has redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every Kindred and tongue and people and nation and has made us under our God Kings and Priests and we shall reign on the earth another fault line people have his finances there's always been a poor people that Envy the rich there's always been rich people who oppress the poor it's always been that way not every rich man oppresses the poor not every poor man envies the rich but it's but it's always been an element of that but that's not God's way some men are gifted to make money others are not we don't want to have an earthquake are you with me now yeah we want to make sure these fault lines are covered we we understand understand these things the way it's supposed to be the way God wants it to be we're moving in the same direction yeah so some men are gifted to make money others aren't I bless the Lord I Thank God for those of you who are gifted to make money and me and brother Joel we're just not you know my dad was a man gifted to make money he wasn't gifted to keep money but he was gifted to make it that's why we didn't we didn't get an inheritance you know but he can make money some people just are some people like King mides and everything they touch turns to gold and some people don't many of us don't a Christian will provide for his own yeah right brother Brandon said a Christian will do that and be gentleman but not everyone is blessed the same materially and and we're all blessed in different ways but brother Bram says this in the Full Gospel business a minute I I'll get off of this pretty quick but he said I think today as I look around and see rich men poor men all fellowshipping together there's something about it we have on Common Grounds one Common Grounds that is Christian fellowship and each man maybe the man and someone spoke like the brother was talking about the Lord had blessed him with so much money and he said the other people maybe maybe you think you don't have that much money it must have been interesting in these Full Gospel businessmen breakfast because they'd get up and boast about how much money they had right cuz it was basically a Kanas club and brother Brandon's preaching messages like the Rapture to him you know right which is just in conru I'm so glad they put it on tape because they didn't get none of it you know and brother Brandon's preaching those sermons those great Mysteries to them and they're they're in there debating about who made the most money and so they get up and testify and so what you hear on tape is not all the service they'd have testimonies they'd have different preachers preach and things and and they have they' get up and testify oh the Lord blessed me I found an oil well you know and I I got I I got a fleet of Cadillacs and you know how even they do today some of the descendants of that movement they'll get up the preachers will get up and brag about how big their house is I don't do that cuz I got nothing to brag about but they'll get up and brag about that kind of stuff and brag about their you know now today it's got to be careful here but it's message pastors we just try to upgrade our trucks you know how you know how successful you are it's okay you can laugh but and I thank God but see some men will be more successful they will yeah right even in Ministry some men are going to be more successful in money some men are going to be more successful some less but I would just want to be where God placed me but these men would get up and and testify about that brother brand notices it and he says like the brother the Lord had blessed him with so much money and the other people maybe you think you don't have that much money you don't want to give your testimony it may not sound the same said but God has G you something yes yes you may not have all the money in the world but God's G you something right he said it's like what brother deesa said he hasn't give this man it's alog together different right right it's a difference and brother brandom said he dealt with that himself because he tells the story of going to Tulsa and seeing the great buildings and and Oral Roberts and all them that built the Great buildings he felt so small cuz brother brandom had had a trailer with a typewriter and that was his office and answered all these letters and he had as much opportunity for money as they did but the Lord just didn't lead him that way he didn't make him that and he saw all that they had built and it intimidated him a little bit he he felt bad about it he he said he said and and he said the Holy Spirit told him I just love this he said he said I'm your portion they have a portion yeah you don't have to Envy them I'm your portion oh I'm so glad that he could be our p portion today whether we're rich or poor whether we got money in the bank or not he could be our portion he said I'm your portion and brother Brandon follows that up he said now I know how some businessmen would feel to hear that man how God is blessing yeah right sometimes you talk about the church and I get kind of self-conscious about it because we've had so many good things happen and I deal with pastors many times who just constantly dealing with problems and things bad are happening and and like that and you say how's your church doing you know you know and I say well everything's good you know we just love one another and and we just try to keep it that way you know and we have our little problems and things but we get over it and and we get past it but when I tell them that it's always when your church is growing it's always hard because there's some brother whose Church isn't growing that don't mean he's any less of a Preacher right right or any less of a man of God are you with me now God has to be our portion no matter what's happening in our ministry what's happening in your life he said no I know how some bus this man would feel to hear that man that how God is blessing but remember God is your portion too brother God is your portion when we come together our fellowships are the same we Fellowship one with another yes oh so we ought to we ought to get along that it shouldn't be a fault line Among Us yeah we should be headed the same direction Bible say seek you first the kingdom of God and his righteousness all these things shall be added unto you see and again we could we could promote a false un of Prosperity Gospel but God didn't make us all to be financially prosperous I believe anybody can be you go ahead and be that if you want to that helps me I'm all for it right but but but God didn't make us all to walk the same path that's right some of us he made contented with less again I don't mean that should means you should be in debt or something like that if you can get out of debt get out of debt but God didn't make us all to be the same right he made us different for different works right right so we would understand people differently another fault line is personality do you know the reason brother brand uses why the godhead can't be a trinity of persons is because that would mean three different personalities can you imagine what the trinitarian godhead makes God it makes him a godhead of persons which is like okay what are we going to do about you know should we flood the people or bring fire or what should we do and they just all have to have a discussion and I heard a trinitarian pastor talking about it he said well the Holy Ghost is the Divine eavesdropper that comes down and listens in and when the Father and Son make a decision he goes off and come on church it's just it's paganism yeah it's paganism that's not what God does at all God is United within himself right right what he speaks is never wrong he never has to say anything twice he's the same today yesterday and forever I'm so thankful we have a god like that if you ever made a decision brother BR said he never made another decision he never had to if you ever if you ever made a decision about to save you he'll never make a decision to lose you right right he can he made the right decision the first time yes but we're not like that right we have personality so that becomes a false a fault line so he said how that God trying to place his people he said when God places one they know the whole church wants to be like that one have the same kind of things do the same things but he said we're cut out different yes we're we're we're made different look at the words he uses we're natured different of different personalities and it's okay amen amen right that's okay each one for a he said we're positionally placed different each one for a different work maybe one for just a little kind of a work another for a large work but see it's when the the little man begins to Envy the little work begins to Envy the large work or when the large work begins to look down on the little work then that's when you have problems that's the fault line brother brand said I believe it was David or one of the prophets said I'd rather be a doorman at the house than to dwell in the tents with the wicked give me my position at the door getting walked on right we bought some new doormats recently let me be one of those yeah rather than just not being there at all right I'd rather do that there are people in the church who are perfectly qualified to have certain offices in the church but they don't have the personality for it don't have the nature for it that's okay not everybody's meant to be a deacon not everybody's meant to be and we shouldn't look at that like that we should look at as opportunity to serve but there is something you can do yeah there's something you can do brother BR talked about how that every a bell would be crafted he said with a certain ting to it a certain tone and every Bell had to have its own tone and he and and so they would use these bells to play music and what they would do is they each one had to have just the right amount of brass in it just the right amount of materials different materials in it to make a different sound so that at the end you could have music because if they all sounded the same it don't sound very good just give you a headache come on church we all try to be the same and just give God a headache but we don't want to do that we want to play Beautiful music to him so how do we do that he's got to make us with specific materials crafted in a certain way to produce a certain tone from our lives yes brother B said he's a great Refiner's furnace that where he has to put these things Upon Us trials and persecutions and things to mold it together what's he doing come on Church what's he doing to our brothers and sisters who are suffering Maybe when we suffer what's he doing to us he's crafting us yes molding us making our testimony ring maybe the only way that your testimony could ring is to go through what you went through but just remember you're in the hands of God right Hallelujah make our testimony ring for a certain time a certain note that he wants to rang out on a certain day yes I thought about that as I went to Brother Ben's because I grew up around that church and but if I had ended up there or brother Ben had ended up here things might have been different it might not have worked yeah right cuz God put us where he wanted us cuz we had we've been made a certain way to Ting a certain a certain sound yeah for a certain place and time I say God let me be used that way yes but brother said we're made different we're all made different but we all see one we see different but we all see one thing that's Jesus Christ let's look at him yes amen the Bible said even the word come no Prophecy of the scriptures of any private interpretation the prophecy came not in Old Time by the will of man but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost what were they they were God's bells and he made them a certain way to teting a certain thing off of their life a note that could become the scripture and you today we're the interpretation of it we're the reality of it we're the walking word we're the manifested word so what does God want to do for us he wants to make us and mold us so that we can give off that certainty so our test testimony can have a ring to it amen I'm almost done just bear with me now for just a few minutes how does 66 men over more than 4,000 years produce a masterpiece it fits exactly together it's God's Unity right man can't do that but the unity of the spirit does that the unity of the spirit and the word they weren't the same but they spoke with one voice because they were inspired by one spirit I lastly I'll deal with this Generations can be a fault line it just means difference in ages for those of you who went to public school generation every generation thinks the next one is completely nuts and I'll be honest I look at my kids and I didn't do things like that but then I remember it's a good thing they don't do everything like I did and and and we need to remember that because someone wrote one time he said our sire's age was worse than our grandsires we their sons are more worthless than they so in our turn we give the world a progyny yet more corrupt well that's fatalistic isn't it you know who wrote that Horus in 20 BC right the young people right I'm just trying to lighten this up a little bit as as we get ready to close but someone this was a writer said modern fashion seemed to keep on growing more and more base the ordinary spoken language has steadily coarsened said people used to say raise the carriage Shaft or trim the lampwick but people today say raise it or trim it and you know how language has gotten dumbed down we have all seen that in our generation but you know who wrote this Yoshida Kinko a Japanese man in the year 1330 someone said in 1904 that never has youth been exposed such dangers of perversion and arres in our own land increasing urban life with his Temptations prematurity sedentary occupations sounds like somebody's reading today right that's what's happening today but that's the way they viewed the Youth of that day and that was some of our grandparents right right and and the active life is most needed early emancipation a lessening sense of both Duty and discipline and and I will say this let me say this let me let me stand up for old people for for old people I try to for our seniors that sounds better doesn't it let me stand up for our seniors for a minute because our seniors have been through some things and they know some things but Danny was telling us a story earlier and he got telling this story and it was but Danny was interesting I I enjoyed it and but he got telling a story about being a 10-year-old boy carrying water he said he went look the first time he earned Social Security was at 10 years old it's hard for me to relate to that and my children can't relate to it at all right because they just had so much handed to them but the truth is if I was raised in this generation I might act a lot like them but it's but we should help them with our knowledge with our understanding right and try to help them because we do need to help they do need help they do need instruction we have to help them but remember that that there have been other Generations come before us thought the same things about us and and yet some many of those things are valid and I believe we should honor our elders in Leviticus 19:32 it teaches us Thou shalt rise up before the Hy head that means gray hair right and honor the face of the old man and fear thy God I am the Lord the Bible tells us even as a young Minister I've been young and now I'm old I kind of identify with that but I'm a younger Minister and I look at an older pastor and I don't rebuke an older Pastor I might rebuke Joel but yeah but I don't rebuke an older Pastor right I I'm careful with that why because the Bible says don't do that rebuke not an elder but in treat him with like a father right he could be wrong old people are wrong sometimes but our seniors can be wrong but let's treat them right right we all got to treat them right see an elder Saint uh you know doing something that maybe they shouldn't be doing sometimes they want to do it but but if they shouldn't be doing something then maybe we should help out be willing to pitch in and you kids be willing to pitch in I saw I'm going to call attention to it again I saw Kennedy carrying around a stack of plates and I know those weren't all hers they were everybody's plates and she's carrying them all and and she uh and and I hollered at across the parking lot I said Kennedy thank you thank you for doing that huh we should encourage our young people there's things that we can do to help one another yes that's fine we can do that and and and we we should uh when you see them when you see somebody and I want but I want to encourage you young people when you see somebody an older person that needs help go help them it may be the best experience of your life we're going to do a some kind of banquet for the for our seniors coming up and when we get a chance to do that I I want our young people to be involved because I want them to look at be able to learn from their parents their grandparents and because some of these people come up in a different place than you did they've been through some things they know some things CU they've seen some things and but there'll always be a friction between Generations because no two generations are the same they're not supposed to be Grand said if you see he said if you see a little grandchild running around Grandma all the time she probably has candy in her pocket right we're not made the same right there will always be friction yes but we're one body how many believe that today we all want to go back to way it used to be I I think about that you know we've been restored back to the early church but if I brought slabs of wood in here for you to sit on I wonder how many of us would come right that's what they did if we had have church in a cave with no electricity then there'd be no Heating in air you talk about hot in the summer and cold in the winter but they were faithful to the house of God that's the people that Paul wrote to they were having churching Cav and Paul said you should assemble yourselves more as you see the day approaching but what what what is it every generation is different because we've had a different standard to live in but the standard ought to be God's word that's what the standard we have to live up to is the word of God not the living conditions I'm not giving up my air conditioned vehicle but I want my standard to be the word of God isn't that what you want your standard to be that's what we all want and you young people ought to honor your elders you ought to look forward to to to a time when you can help somebody that's what we want we want to help people and our elders ought to want to help our young people too I'm here to help you I want I want you to know as a pastor I'm here to help you it's never too late at night it's never too early in the morning it's never too difficult of a time there's never a time I wouldn't want to hear from somebody because I want to know you say well it's not a big deal but if it's something that you think you ought to call me about call me about it why because that's what I'm here for kind of hurts my feelings if nobody ever asked for help right that's my whole job what am I supposed to do right and so I want you to do that I want you to ask me to pray many times that's all I can do but I can pray I got time that some of you don't have cuz you're working all the time I got time to get on my and pray before God I say God help me to do that God help me to put more time in study and prayer for the people of God that's the standard we all ought to be trying to help one another I'm G to skip on down I told you I was closing I'm almost out of time we want to suffer the little children as Jesus said to come but he said we all should be like little children yes we should all be like little children but the Bible tells us this in Galatians 6:2 bear ye one another's burdens all of us all of us right can we be real and and understanding that we don't all understand each other's burdens that's right if you go down a few verses from that Paul says each man must each one must carry his own burden it seems like it contradicts but it doesn't contradict it just says I don't always understand somebody else's burden I don't know why they're wired the way that they are it's it's impossible for me to comprehend why somebody is the way that they are exactly I can think about it I can do psychoanalysis you know in my brain say Well they're this way because of this but it's really impossible for me to know because I didn't go through what they went through and they didn't go through what I'm going through or have been through so how do you bear a burden if you don't understand it let me ask you this how how did Simon help Jesus I've preached it to you many times but never brought out this point listen how did he help him there's no way that Simon who carried Jesus cross could have ever understood the load that Jesus was bearing right he can't comprehend it there's just no way the weight of the sins of the world were not on Simon right he didn't go to Gethsemane right he wasn't there it was in possible for him he can't carry the whole burden of the sins of the world listen you can't carry the appointed burden or someone else you can't do that you're not always going to understand but what can you do pick up the cross yes so he picked up to carry the the physical load to help in what way he could help right he was just a man big enough and strong enough that he could carry across and he was compelled to do it let me be that kind of a man let me be somebody who's willing to Bear somebody else's burdens even if I don't understand it yes how could he comprehend what was going through the mind of Jesus who had never done anything wrong and was spit on killed by his own children beaten by his own children Simon couldn't understand as the musicians come how could Simon he couldn't understand it that was Jesus burden yes but when the Body of Christ was weak yes at its weakest point right Simon just happens to be at the right place at the right time yes and the Bible says he was compelled to carry the cross and we preached about he made a made a difference in his family because he picked up the burden that he couldn't understand said I'll help you I'll pray for you I don't know what you're going through cuz I didn't live in your age but I I'll help you is there a way I can help you is there a way I can do that could shouldn't we be looking for that church see that's not forced Unity or false Unity that's un the unity of the bride all marching together because we have one example and that's Christ in the message of the hour I don't always understand I don't understand what brother brandham went through I don't I don't have that kind of ministry but I can help carry this message yes right Lord help me to carry it yes I don't understand what many of you mothers go through yeah I've never given child birth we men can't we can't understand that but we can bear the burden pick up the cross help out yeah are you with me now yes what if we all made a commitment to do that I know it's been different today what if we all made a different commitment to do that as a church and say Let's help one another yes let's pull for one another yeah let's strive to come in at the Straight Gate and walk together till we reach the other side all we have is each other let's not take that lightly Let's help one another sometimes helping is is reminding someone of their Duty sometimes it's sometimes it's encouraging sometimes sometimes it's rebuke but just make sure it's helpful it's all it's what we want to do we want to do what's right we want these kids to be raised up I I I'll be honest with you I don't want them to experience the same things I did I want them to experience a Rapture before they're even old enough to go out and brother man you want them to have your experience no I want them to experience a change of a body they go from 9 or 10 or 12 or whatever they are to being perfect in his sight and having a new body that's what I [Music] want want with all of my heart but if there's another generation let me help them all I can give my life for them so that the Next Generation can walk forward and be better than we were and keep marching up like he said the bride was we don't want them to be like we were we
