[43:50] where the mountain

[45:43] forward to what God has this weekend.
[45:47] Amen. This is a new song for me.
[45:53] Well, I'm singing about a different
[45:56] breed.
[45:58] We sprang up from the original seed.
[46:03] Chosen and elected from the beginning
[46:08] time.
[46:09] [Music]
[46:11] We'll never be a chicken. We won't take
[46:16] the devil's licking.
[46:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:19] &gt;&gt; You see, we're born winners were the
[46:23] equal kind.
[46:27] &gt;&gt; We're an army of believers. Hallelujah.
[46:31] &gt;&gt; That makes us naturalborn receivers.
[46:35] Hopeless thoughts are doubts and fears
[46:39] we've left behind.
[46:43] While others think and die, all I've got
[46:48] on my mind is life.
[46:51] &gt;&gt; I repeat, that's the nature of the evil
[46:56] kind.
[46:59] &gt;&gt; No barnyard br can hold us.
[47:03] &gt;&gt; No chicken coop can mold us. We'll just
[47:08] keep on going. We'll never lie behind.
[47:15] &gt;&gt; We're going to keep on growing. Yes,
[47:18] sir.
[47:19] &gt;&gt; And this bunch will be more than crow. I
[47:23] repeat, not the chicken worthy eagle
[47:28] kind.
[47:30] We're an army of believers that makes us
[47:36] naturalb born receivers.
[47:39] Our negative thoughts, our doubts and
[47:42] fears we've left behind.
[47:46] While others think I know all I've got
[47:51] on my mind is
[47:54] I repeat
[47:56] the nature of the evil kind.
[48:02] We're taking on inspiration.
[48:06] We're living this revelation.
[48:10] Our eyesight's getting cleaner
[48:14] cuz we're not blind.
[48:18] We'll never feast on old things. By your
[48:22] spirit, we're being led.
[48:25] I repeat, that's the nature of the evil
[48:31] kind.
[48:33] Oh, we're an army of believers. That
[48:37] makes us naturalborn receivers.
[48:41] Our negative thoughts, our doubts and
[48:45] fears remain.
[48:49] While others think,
[48:53] all I've got on my mind is fly.
[48:57] I repeat that the nature of the eagle
[49:02] kind.
[49:04] Oh, while others think of dying, all
[49:08] I've got on my mind is flight.
[49:12] I repeat, that's the nature of the evil
[49:17] kind.
[49:19] [Music]
[49:20] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad for that?
[49:24] [Music]
[49:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:31] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[49:34] Glad to be an eagle.
[49:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[49:47] &gt;&gt; Isn't it good to be on at the meetings
[49:49] again?
[49:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's give the Lord a hand
[49:53] tonight. Wonderful to us.
[49:59] Brought us back together again another
[50:01] year. My goodness, what a what a
[50:04] wonderful crowd on a Thursday night. I
[50:07] &gt;&gt; These meetings have meant so much to us
[50:08] over the last few years. And this is our
[50:11] fifth meeting, the fourth one that we've
[50:13] done on the third weekend of July. And
[50:15] it's such a privilege to each one of us
[50:18] to have you here with us. And I got so
[50:20] many friends here. If I start calling
[50:22] names, I'm going to be in trouble. But
[50:24] we got folks from all over the country.
[50:26] Several states here tonight and a bunch
[50:28] more coming in tomorrow. So, we'll uh
[50:30] get here early and you'll get a seat.
[50:32] So, we uh but we sure appreciate you. We
[50:34] got a little room. We got room up front
[50:36] and a little bit of room in the back. I
[50:38] know there's some in the fellowship hall
[50:40] uh as well and and uh mothers with
[50:43] children and stuff. I know it's crowded
[50:44] in the nurseries and things, but but we
[50:47] just appreciate you coming together.
[50:48] There's something about coming together
[50:49] that means something, doesn't it?
[50:51] &gt;&gt; It's still worth it. It may be a
[50:53] struggle to be able to get together, but
[50:55] it's still worth it.
[50:56] And we believe that God is going to do
[50:58] something in this meeting. I I've been
[51:00] talking to the church about how our
[51:02] faith can be increased that that we
[51:05] could uh when we see signs of his
[51:07] presence that increases our faith. And
[51:09] that's what we want in this meeting.
[51:10] That's what's on my heart. That the
[51:12] faith of everyone that comes to this
[51:14] meeting would be increased in such a way
[51:16] that we could know God is here. And if
[51:19] he's here, anything is possible. the
[51:21] sick can be healed and the dead can be
[51:23] raised and and and people can be changed
[51:26] and I'm so thankful for that. We've got
[51:28] some amazing testimonies of things that
[51:30] God has done in these meetings. We're
[51:32] going to share some of them with you uh
[51:34] on on Saturday night at the prayer line.
[51:36] But God has just done remarkable things.
[51:38] But if you have a need tonight, how many
[51:40] come here with a need to the meetings
[51:41] tonight all over the building? I've got
[51:44] needs in my life. And I I just pray that
[51:46] God would meet every one of those needs.
[51:48] Do you believe he can do that? Do you
[51:49] believe he will do that? I I believe
[51:52] that he will. God bless each and every
[51:54] one of you for coming. My goodness. I'm
[51:56] looking out there and seeing people. I'm
[51:57] going to call names. I don't want to do
[51:59] that yet, but we'll get to that later in
[52:01] the meetings. Thank you for being here.
[52:02] Each one of you pastors, each one of you
[52:04] for being here. God bless you. Could we
[52:06] stand together tonight?
[52:09] And we're going to sing. Uh let me let
[52:12] me read this first. I've got a brother
[52:14] Brandham is praying and speak to this
[52:16] mountain. He says this. He said, 'Oh
[52:18] Lord, grant to your people a special
[52:21] blessing tonight of your divine
[52:23] presence.
[52:25] &gt;&gt; We we do not know what tomorrow holds,
[52:27] but we know who holds tomorrow.
[52:30] &gt;&gt; So we pray God that tonight by your
[52:32] grace that is projected to us a savior
[52:35] by your love. May it send him again
[52:37] tonight in the form of the Holy Spirit.
[52:39] You said, "I'm the vine and you're the
[52:41] branches." Get into these branches of
[52:43] the tree, Lord. energize everyone that
[52:46] you're connected with. Show signs and
[52:48] wonders of your resurrection that it
[52:50] might increase the faith of the people
[52:52] that they might look and live. Oh,
[52:54] that's my prayer tonight. Said for we
[52:56] ask it in Jesus name. Amen. I Let's make
[52:59] that our prayer tonight. Lord, increase
[53:01] my faith.
[53:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe it'll just build every
[53:04] night. Tonight, we've got brother Andrew
[53:05] Glover. It's our privilege to have him
[53:07] again here in the meetings and be
[53:09] speaking tonight and again on Sunday
[53:10] morning. Brother Andrew's just been such
[53:12] a friend and a blessing to us. We got
[53:15] sister Mariah and Malachi here somewhere
[53:17] as well. God bless you. Thank you for
[53:19] being here tonight. We just love having
[53:21] our friends with us. Don't you love one
[53:22] another tonight? God bless you, brother.
[53:25] Go ahead.
[53:30] It's all right. We're going to spend he
[53:32] eternity together. We might as well get
[53:33] along down here and express our love for
[53:36] one for the other. Amen. As brother
[53:38] Andrew comes, could we sing the only Do
[53:41] we know that the only real peace that I
[53:42] have is in you?
[53:46] I just make up songs as we go along. So,
[53:51] well, the only
[53:53] real peace
[53:56] that I have,
[53:59] dear Lord, is in you.
[54:04] You believe that tonight?

[54:09] real peace
[54:11] that I have,
[54:13] dear Lord, is in you
[54:19] in all life's frustrations.
[54:22] With all life frustrations.
[54:27] Oh, I need you.
[54:30] Oh, I know I do.
[54:35] Oh, thank you, Lord. That's the only
[54:40] real peace
[54:42] that I have,
[54:44] dear Lord,
[54:47] is in you. I think we've got it now.
[54:50] Let's sing. Let's Let's raise our hands
[54:52] to him. The only
[54:55] real peace. He is our peace,

[56:40] For the only
[56:43] real peace
[56:45] that I have
[56:48] here, Lord, is
[56:51] in you.
[56:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many can testify that tonight?
[56:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. The world is the world is doing
[56:59] everything they can to offer peace and
[57:01] it's only a substitution
[57:03] &gt;&gt; and it only lasts for just a little bit.
[57:05] But I think of the Bible how it said,
[57:07] "My peace I give unto you." And Amen. I
[57:09] don't believe it's temporary peace. I
[57:11] believe it's eternal peace. And I
[57:13] believe we're here tonight, the
[57:14] recipients of that peace. Amen. Want to
[57:16] say God bless you all tonight. It is a
[57:18] real honor to be here with you once
[57:19] again and to be in these meetings and to
[57:22] look around and see so many familiar
[57:23] faces here. We just want to say God
[57:25] bless you all. And we sure appreciate
[57:27] Brother Ben and Brother Joel and the
[57:29] church here and uh another year of
[57:31] hosting these meetings. And I was just
[57:33] thinking today as I was uh reading a
[57:35] little bit there, I think it's brother
[57:36] Ben mentioned maybe five years I think.
[57:38] And amen. I I just a blessing to see the
[57:41] hand of the Lord upon it and see the
[57:42] power of God moving. And Amen. How many
[57:44] enjoys the presence of the Lord? Amen.
[57:47] There's one thing we know that in his
[57:48] presence all things are possible. Amen.
[57:51] We want to say God bless you to all
[57:52] these men of God here tonight. Amen. A
[57:54] whole whole houseful of preachers and
[57:57] soldiers of the cross. And we sure
[57:59] appreciate every one of these brothers
[58:00] and their ministries and the Lord using
[58:02] them. And I know the Lord's going to use
[58:04] them to speak to us here this weekend.
[58:06] And amen do want to say it is an honor
[58:08] to be here and have my wife here with
[58:09] us. And amen, we bring you greetings
[58:11] tonight from the church at home, brother
[58:12] Matt and the saints there. And uh we see
[58:15] several of the folks here from home and
[58:16] I know several will be here this
[58:18] weekend. So, we just uh say it is a real
[58:20] honor to be in the presence of God. And
[58:23] &gt;&gt; we tonight want to approach the Lord and
[58:25] we're going to open these meetings
[58:26] tonight. And I pray this will be the
[58:28] night we just get our hearts and minds
[58:29] in one accord and allow his presence to
[58:32] come among us and speak to us. And maybe
[58:34] you just turn and lay your hand on
[58:35] someone standing next to you as we just
[58:37] join together.
[58:38] &gt;&gt; I know tonight that where there is
[58:40] division, there's no power. But where
[58:42] there's unity, all things are possible.
[58:44] And I believe there's enough power of
[58:46] God in this building tonight to put
[58:48] every demon back in the hell that it
[58:50] crawled out of. Let's just join together
[58:51] and dedicate ourselves and consecrate
[58:54] ourselves to him. Heavenly Father, Lord,
[58:56] as your believers have gathered here
[58:58] this evening on this Thursday afternoon,
[59:00] Father, we've not gathered here out of
[59:02] form or fashion. We've not gathered here
[59:04] out of ritual or tradition, Lord. But
[59:06] Father, we've gathered here because
[59:08] there is a deep calling to the deep and
[59:10] that the noise of the water spouts.
[59:12] Lord, you promised you an answer. And
[59:14] Lord, as we're gathering here tonight, I
[59:16] know that the enemy is attacking on
[59:18] every hand. He's doing everything he
[59:20] can, Lord, to defeat this bride. But we
[59:22] stand up on your promise tonight, Lord,
[59:25] that greater is he that is in us than he
[59:27] that is in our enemy against us. And
[59:29] Lord, as we come together for these next
[59:31] few days, Lord, knowing that your
[59:33] presence is among us, Lord, Father, you
[59:36] see every need that's represented here
[59:38] tonight, whether it be a sickness, oh
[59:39] God, or whether it be a financial need
[59:42] or a materialistic need, Lord. Whatever
[59:44] the need would be, Father, a spiritual
[59:46] need, we're still firm believers that
[59:48] you're Jehovah Gyra. And Lord, as we're
[59:51] turning our attention to you, Father,
[59:52] asking you, Lord, Lord, to consecrate us
[59:55] for these meetings, Lord, Father, I pray
[59:57] you would drive out every spirit that's
[59:59] unlike the Holy Spirit, Lord, as the
[1:00:01] believers have laid their hands upon one
[1:00:03] another, Father, knowing that where
[1:00:05] there is division, Lord, there is no
[1:00:07] power, but where there is unity, oh God,
[1:00:10] Lord, all things are possible. Now,
[1:00:12] Father, forgive us of our sins. Forgive
[1:00:14] us of our shortcomings, Lord. Lord, may
[1:00:16] we gather ourselves together under that
[1:00:18] one great banner of Jehovah. Lord, may
[1:00:21] you come down among us this weekend in
[1:00:23] supernatural ways. Lord, Father, may it
[1:00:25] be surge after surge of your presence,
[1:00:27] oh God. Lord, you see the desires of the
[1:00:30] hearts of your children, Lord. I pray
[1:00:32] that you would open the windows of
[1:00:34] heaven here this weekend. And Lord, you
[1:00:36] would fill this place with your graces,
[1:00:38] oh God. Lord, may answers come to
[1:00:40] prayers, Father. Lord, may may miracles
[1:00:43] be manifested right here before our very
[1:00:45] eyes. And Lord, we'll be sure to stand
[1:00:47] back and give thee all the praise, all
[1:00:49] the honor, and all the glory. In the
[1:00:51] wonderful name of our Lord and Savior
[1:00:53] Jesus Christ, we pray. And all the
[1:00:56] believers says,
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. God bless you tonight.
[1:01:00] If you have your Bibles, while you're
[1:01:02] standing with us, we want to go uh to
[1:01:04] the book of St. John, the 18th chapter.
[1:01:06] Amen. I I want to say, Amen. It's a real
[1:01:09] uh real honor to be speaking to you and
[1:01:11] I thank brother Ben for this opportunity
[1:01:13] tonight and amen that we just actually
[1:01:15] get home from Czech Republic, brother uh
[1:01:17] Josh Martin and I just a few days ago
[1:01:19] and so amen if he dozes off you brothers
[1:01:22] wake him up and if I do off you wake me
[1:01:24] up. Amen.
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. I was telling brother Ben in the
[1:01:27] back room I don't know what time zone
[1:01:28] I'm on but I'm here and we're going to
[1:01:30] preach. Amen.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. We want to look here tonight in
[1:01:32] the book of St. John the 18th chapter
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; and the 37th verse. Amen. This is a very
[1:01:39] familiar scripture, but I just want to
[1:01:40] pull something from it if that be okay.
[1:01:43] In the 37th verse, the Bible here says,
[1:01:46] "Pilate therefore said unto him, Art
[1:01:49] thou a king?" Then Jesus answered, "Thou
[1:01:52] sayest that I am a king. To this end was
[1:01:56] I born, and for this cause came I into
[1:01:58] the world." So he was not guessing while
[1:02:01] he was here. Hallelujah.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; For this cause came I into the world
[1:02:05] that I should bear witness unto the
[1:02:07] truth, and everyone that is of the truth
[1:02:10] heareth my voice.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; Now Pilate saith unto him, What is
[1:02:15] truth?
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; And when he had said this, he went out
[1:02:18] again unto the Jews, and saith unto
[1:02:19] them, I find in him no fault at all.
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; But ye have a custom. Isn't that
[1:02:25] something? Their custom was so powerful.
[1:02:28] But ye have a custom that I should
[1:02:29] release unto you one at the Passover.
[1:02:32] Will ye therefore that I release unto
[1:02:33] you the king of the Jews. Then cried
[1:02:36] they all again saying, "Not this man,
[1:02:38] but Barabbus." Now Barabbus was a
[1:02:41] robber. I I think it's amazing. Brother
[1:02:43] Ram said, "There they chose a robber or
[1:02:45] a murderer over the anointed word."
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. We ask the Lord this evening to
[1:02:49] bless the reading of his word. as you
[1:02:51] can have your seats here. Uh this
[1:02:52] afternoon, I want to by the help of the
[1:02:54] Lord, if I would take a title tonight
[1:02:56] and speak to you on something here for
[1:02:58] just a few moments, I want to speak to
[1:03:00] you on this. Opportunities presented by
[1:03:02] his presence. Opportunities presented by
[1:03:05] his presence. Of course, I have to say
[1:03:07] uh what I believe tonight. I believe
[1:03:09] that you are a people, amen, of divine
[1:03:12] opportunity. I don't believe you're just
[1:03:13] a people of natural opportunity, but
[1:03:16] rather I believe you're a people of
[1:03:17] divine opportunity. And maybe uh just to
[1:03:20] start this off tonight and ask you,
[1:03:22] Amen. What are we doing with the
[1:03:24] opportunities that's being presented to
[1:03:26] us in the hour, in the age that we're
[1:03:27] living? You know, Brother Brandham would
[1:03:29] say in the Easter Seal, he said, "Oh,
[1:03:31] Christian, what an opportunity that we
[1:03:33] have." See, we have opportunities that
[1:03:35] St. Paul never dreamed of having. We
[1:03:37] have opportunities that Enoch and Elijah
[1:03:40] and all of them never had. Amen. The
[1:03:42] opportunities that we have now. Now, I
[1:03:45] love that because these opportunities
[1:03:47] are not in the future. Amen. So, we're
[1:03:49] not gathered here tonight looking
[1:03:51] forward to opportunities. Amen. And
[1:03:53] neither are we gathered here looking
[1:03:54] back to opportunities that other ages
[1:03:56] had, but rather we're here tonight
[1:03:59] knowing that the same God, amen, that's
[1:04:01] in the future and that's in the past is
[1:04:03] in the present. And he's here to give us
[1:04:05] the desires of our heart. Brother
[1:04:07] Brandham would say it very beautifully.
[1:04:08] He said the greatest opportunity that
[1:04:10] ever laid before any human being was to
[1:04:13] stand in the presence of Jesus Christ.
[1:04:16] Another place he said somehow or another
[1:04:18] it's always throwed a great effect upon
[1:04:21] people. Amen. To come into the presence
[1:04:24] of God. He said see there's something
[1:04:26] about coming into the presence of God.
[1:04:28] Amen. That it causes things to happen.
[1:04:31] So, amen. It's not just our music or
[1:04:33] who's here or who's not here. Amen. That
[1:04:36] causes things to happen. but rather,
[1:04:38] amen, it's who is here. Amen. And that's
[1:04:40] the Lord Jesus Christ. Now, when you
[1:04:42] when you look here at this, Pilate was
[1:04:44] in the presence of God. And I find it
[1:04:46] amazing that Pilate's standing there in
[1:04:48] the presence of God and he actually
[1:04:50] asked a question, amen, that the devil
[1:04:53] had inspired him to ask. He said, "Now,
[1:04:55] Amen. What is truth?" Amen. Now, that
[1:04:57] that's like that's like looking at a
[1:04:59] tree, amen, and saying, "What is a
[1:05:01] tree?" Or looking at a mountain and
[1:05:03] saying, "What is a mountain?" Amen. the
[1:05:05] thing you're looking at, amen, is the
[1:05:07] answer to your question. And I I want to
[1:05:09] say this tonight, that the devil is
[1:05:11] still anointing people, amen, to ask
[1:05:13] that question, what is truth? Amen. But
[1:05:16] I'm glad to announce to you tonight that
[1:05:18] we have the answer. Amen. To the devil's
[1:05:21] question that Christ is the truth. The
[1:05:23] message of the hour is Christ, and he is
[1:05:26] alive and he is well. Amen. The message
[1:05:28] of the hour is not a man. It's not a
[1:05:30] church. Amen. But it's God's promise for
[1:05:33] the present hour. Amen. According to the
[1:05:36] scripture. I thank God tonight that
[1:05:38] we're not gathered here looking around
[1:05:40] saying, "What is truth or what do we
[1:05:42] believe?" Or, "Who do we follow? Where
[1:05:43] do we go?" I'm thankful we're standing
[1:05:45] on a foundation tonight. Amen. It's not
[1:05:48] a shifting sands of some man's
[1:05:50] imagination, but it's the vindicated
[1:05:52] word of God in the hour that we're
[1:05:55] living in. We're We're not looking for
[1:05:56] Malachi 4. We're looking at Malachi 4.
[1:05:59] We're not looking for Revelation 10.
[1:06:01] Amen. We're looking at the fulfillment
[1:06:03] of Revelation 10. Amen. We're not
[1:06:05] looking for truth to appear. Amen. Truth
[1:06:08] has already appeared. Amen. And there
[1:06:10] was a prophet on the earth to identify.
[1:06:13] Amen. The truth that was appearing,
[1:06:15] Amen. was not be elyub. Amen. It was not
[1:06:18] a soothsayer or a fortune teller, but
[1:06:20] the truth that was appearing was the God
[1:06:22] of this Bible. Amen. Vindicating every
[1:06:25] promise that he has made in the hour
[1:06:27] that we're living. He he was identifying
[1:06:29] that this is more than just a message.
[1:06:31] Amen. This is more than just a preacher.
[1:06:34] But this is the opening of the book
[1:06:35] that's been sealed, amen, for years. And
[1:06:38] what's it doing? It's identifying the
[1:06:40] source of rapturing faith. Listen, I
[1:06:42] don't know about you, but we don't have
[1:06:44] another age to go to. Amen. There's not
[1:06:46] another age coming. There's not another
[1:06:48] messenger coming. We're standing on the
[1:06:50] threshold of millennial kingdom tonight.
[1:06:53] We got to get out of here, folks. We got
[1:06:55] to go somewhere. Where are we going to
[1:06:57] go? I'll tell you where we're going to
[1:06:59] go. The road map has been laid where
[1:07:01] we're going to go. We're going in the
[1:07:03] rapture. Amen. This message of the hour
[1:07:06] has brought. Amen. An opportunity to
[1:07:08] this generation to do something that
[1:07:10] others have longed to do. Amen. Not just
[1:07:13] to shout. Amen. Not just to dance. Amen.
[1:07:16] Not just to speak in tongues, but to
[1:07:18] change our bodies some morning between 6
[1:07:20] and 9. We're not looking for truth.
[1:07:23] We're looking at truth. Amen. If God
[1:07:26] sends a message, Amen. then somebody's
[1:07:28] going to believe it's the truth.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; If God sends a message, Amen. Somebody's
[1:07:35] going to believe it's the truth. Said it
[1:07:37] very beautifully. He said, "We're now
[1:07:38] ready for a battle." Amen. Amen. The
[1:07:40] trumpet is to sound. The hymns have been
[1:07:43] sung. Now comes the word. Ain't that
[1:07:44] something? When the word comes is when
[1:07:46] the battle starts. Amen. The battle
[1:07:48] don't start on the music. It don't start
[1:07:50] on the singing, but it starts on the
[1:07:53] word. Amen. Because pro brother said
[1:07:55] like this. He said to hear these
[1:07:57] comments of these young soldiers here
[1:07:59] and myself getting old and listen around
[1:08:01] and your faith and confidence and what
[1:08:03] you placed in it to believe the message
[1:08:05] that I've been given of God. Now if it
[1:08:08] wasn't for you all the message would do
[1:08:10] no good. Amen. That devil tells you
[1:08:12] you're worthless or you don't have no
[1:08:14] value. But hear a prophet say if it
[1:08:17] wasn't for you all. Amen. Then the
[1:08:19] message would do no good. Amen. See,
[1:08:21] it's got to be somebody to believe it.
[1:08:24] And as long as it's coming from God,
[1:08:26] there is going to be somebody believe
[1:08:28] it. You see, because God has made a way.
[1:08:31] Well, that ought to make you put your
[1:08:33] shouting shoes on in the house of God.
[1:08:35] Hey, God has made a way when the devil's
[1:08:37] put every roadblock he can in front of
[1:08:40] the church of the living God. God who is
[1:08:42] rich in mercy has made a way to bring
[1:08:44] his word to pass in the hour that we're
[1:08:46] living in. Amen. God has made a way.
[1:08:49] Look what God has done. He has affixed
[1:08:51] his great economy like that that when he
[1:08:54] sends forth something, there is going to
[1:08:56] be something there to meet the
[1:08:58] something. Amen. When he sends forth
[1:09:00] something, there is going to be
[1:09:02] something there. Amen. To meet the
[1:09:04] something. In other words, if if if
[1:09:07] Amen. If if Philillip is going to the
[1:09:09] river, there's going to be a unic there.
[1:09:11] If Jesus is going to the well, there's
[1:09:14] going to be a woman there. If he's going
[1:09:16] by the Barnameus, he's going to be
[1:09:18] there. All glory to God. He didn't come
[1:09:21] here tonight hoping that there would be
[1:09:23] a believer here to believe his message,
[1:09:25] but before the foundation of the world,
[1:09:27] he set it up that when he would begin to
[1:09:30] reveal these things, there would be
[1:09:31] somebody on the earth that would not be
[1:09:33] saying, "What is truth?" But they would
[1:09:35] be saying, "Hosana, hosana." Glory to
[1:09:39] God in the highest. Truth is not coming.
[1:09:41] Truth is here.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; God has fixed this thing, folks. And
[1:09:46] there ain't nothing the devil can do
[1:09:47] about it. This ain't the devil's
[1:09:49] opportunity. This is the bride's
[1:09:51] opportunity. Amen. I love that word
[1:09:54] opportunity. It is a set of
[1:09:56] circumstances that makes it possible to
[1:09:58] do something. It is a chance for success
[1:10:02] or an advancement occurs. Now, I just
[1:10:04] got to say this. I don't believe the
[1:10:05] bride of Christ just going backwards.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; I don't believe we're retreating. Amen.
[1:10:11] But rather, I believe we are advancing.
[1:10:13] Brother said, "In spite of dungeons, in
[1:10:16] spite of swords and in spite of storms,
[1:10:18] amen, God's great church marches onward.
[1:10:22] We're so happy to be a member of the
[1:10:24] blessed body, looking shortly for the
[1:10:26] coming of our blessed Lord, who will
[1:10:28] receive us up into his kingdom, into his
[1:10:30] presence." He said, "There we will ever
[1:10:33] be with him." Oh, the glorious thoughts
[1:10:36] and the joy that sweeps through our
[1:10:38] souls when we look upon these promises
[1:10:41] and the Holy Spirit bearing us record.
[1:10:44] Amen. That they are the truth. I have to
[1:10:46] say it like this. Amen. The promises of
[1:10:49] God are almost Amen. like a spiritual
[1:10:51] broom. You know, you get a broom out,
[1:10:53] you're going to sweep something out,
[1:10:54] amen, that don't belong there. And and
[1:10:56] the prophet of God said, "What joy,
[1:10:58] Amen, fills our souls when we look upon
[1:11:01] these promises." Listen, I believe the
[1:11:03] promises of God ought to sweep
[1:11:04] depression out. I believe the promises
[1:11:07] of God, amen, ought to sweep sickness
[1:11:09] out. I think it ought to sweep
[1:11:11] discouragement out. I think the promises
[1:11:13] of God, Amen, ought to sweep out
[1:11:15] unbelief and sweep out confusion and
[1:11:17] sweep out false doctrine. Amen. Because
[1:11:20] God's church is not going backward.
[1:11:22] Amen. She's moving onward and she's
[1:11:24] going upward. How many is going onward?
[1:11:27] Amen. Amen. You sing that little song,
[1:11:28] I'm going on with Jesus just the same.
[1:11:31] Amen. You can talk about me. You can
[1:11:33] scandalize my name. But I'm going on
[1:11:36] with Jesus just the same. I say, "Oh
[1:11:38] God, open the windows of heaven here
[1:11:40] this weekend and baptize every heart
[1:11:43] with the determination that come hell or
[1:11:45] high water, I'm going on with Jesus just
[1:11:48] the same. If the devil comes against me,
[1:11:50] if sickness come against me, I'm going
[1:11:52] on with Jesus just the same. I've come
[1:11:55] too far to lay down and quit now."
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm going on with Jesus just
[1:12:01] to say, "Amen." I'll say this. This
[1:12:03] message ain't going backwards. It's
[1:12:05] going forward. And if you try to stay
[1:12:07] where God was, you're going to get left
[1:12:09] behind. It's time to put your walking
[1:12:11] shoes on. It's time to get your staff in
[1:12:14] your hand. And it's time to move into
[1:12:16] every promise that God has made.
[1:12:18] Reverend said, "The thing of it is
[1:12:20] today." Amen. The church grain don't
[1:12:22] want to mature. It wants to stay like it
[1:12:24] was back in Moody's time or back in
[1:12:26] Sanki's time or Finny or Knox or Calvin.
[1:12:29] He said they were all right. They were
[1:12:31] the light of the hour, but this is
[1:12:33] another hour. See, this is another day.
[1:12:36] Amen. This is the advancement of the
[1:12:38] gospel. It's coming to its maturity. So,
[1:12:41] we can't live in what Luther said or
[1:12:44] what Wesley said or some of the rest of
[1:12:46] them. We're living in the light that's
[1:12:49] been predicted for this day. We're in
[1:12:51] the seventh church age. Amen. Not the
[1:12:54] third or the fourth church age. Amen.
[1:12:56] The grain should be able to receive it.
[1:12:59] Well, that ought to make you put some
[1:13:01] shout shoes on. Amen. The grain ought to
[1:13:04] be able to receive. Amen. The maturity
[1:13:07] of the gospel. I don't think this is the
[1:13:09] time, Amen, to back up and start
[1:13:11] preaching sermonets and becoming
[1:13:13] Christianets and becoming shallow
[1:13:15] Christians. I think if there's ever been
[1:13:17] a time, amen, to preach the meat of this
[1:13:20] message and to declare the oracles of
[1:13:22] God, I think now is the time to do it.
[1:13:25] What other age but this age? What other
[1:13:27] people but you? What other time but this
[1:13:30] time? This is the hour to move with the
[1:13:32] presence of the sun. We're not going
[1:13:34] backwards. If it does, it falls off and
[1:13:37] it means nothing to it. Amen. The grain
[1:13:40] is matured with the light. Ain't that
[1:13:43] powerful? Amen. The grain is matured
[1:13:45] with the light if it goes ahead with the
[1:13:48] light. I love what John said. He said,
[1:13:51] "If we walk in the light as he is in the
[1:13:54] light, we have fellowship one with
[1:13:56] another. And the blood of Jesus Christ,
[1:13:59] his son,
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; cleanseth us all from sin." I love that
[1:14:04] word walk. It means to make due use of
[1:14:07] opportunities. So when you're walking in
[1:14:10] the light, you're making good use of the
[1:14:12] opportunities that the light is
[1:14:14] presenting to you in the hour that
[1:14:17] you're walking. Paul said it like this.
[1:14:19] He said, "Redeeming the time because the
[1:14:22] days are evil." I love that phrase,
[1:14:24] redeeming the time. You know what that
[1:14:26] actually means? It means to buy up every
[1:14:28] at each opportunity. Amen. That word
[1:14:31] time means the supreme moment. It means
[1:14:34] the golden opportunity. In other words,
[1:14:37] Paul is saying, "Redeem our golden
[1:14:40] opportunity in the presence of God
[1:14:42] himself."
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. This is the golden
[1:14:46] opportunity, folks. Amen. This is the
[1:14:49] supreme moment. Amen. I love what
[1:14:51] brother said. He said, "Don't you miss
[1:14:53] your opportunity. It's presented to
[1:14:55] every man and woman in this world."
[1:14:57] Amen. Daily like that. But they fail to
[1:15:00] get it. See their opportunity. Can I say
[1:15:03] something to you? Amen. Death is not
[1:15:05] your opportunity to change. But then he
[1:15:08] said, "No." He said, "In his presence
[1:15:10] while you're living is the opportunity
[1:15:12] to change." He said, "Every sinner
[1:15:14] that's in here, perhaps there would be
[1:15:16] one." You have been saved since Jesus
[1:15:19] died. He said, "But don't you never die
[1:15:22] here where your opportunity was placed
[1:15:24] before you to go in his presence then to
[1:15:27] try to accept it. It's made for now."
[1:15:29] See? Amen. Right now, you must accept
[1:15:32] it. Amen. If you go beyond the blood,
[1:15:35] then you're already judged because
[1:15:37] you're judged by the way you treated the
[1:15:39] atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:15:41] Amen. See, you judge yourself. Listen,
[1:15:44] if that ever settled on your heart, that
[1:15:46] these are not just meetings and these
[1:15:48] are not just services and these are not
[1:15:51] just gettogethers once and twice a year,
[1:15:53] but these are supreme moments. These are
[1:15:56] golden opportunities. These are present
[1:15:58] moments and presence of God where things
[1:16:01] can change. He said, "When we come in
[1:16:03] his presence," Amen. We're changed never
[1:16:06] to be the same.
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; Do you realize that you never go in the
[1:16:10] presence of God and leave the way you
[1:16:12] come? You know what the prophet said? He
[1:16:14] said, "You leave better or you leave
[1:16:16] worse." Amen. Look, call down for the
[1:16:18] ages every walk of life. You say, "Well,
[1:16:21] the changed life is just for ministers."
[1:16:24] Oh, no. The changed life is for
[1:16:26] everybody. Well, I'm not a preacher.
[1:16:29] Bless the Lord. you at the right place
[1:16:31] at the right time. The change life is
[1:16:33] for everybody. I say this, the change
[1:16:36] life is for the young. The change life
[1:16:38] is for the old. The change life is for
[1:16:41] the preacher. The change life is for the
[1:16:43] deacon. The change life is for the
[1:16:45] Sunday school teacher. Amen. Now is the
[1:16:48] day of salvation. Amen. This is your
[1:16:50] hour of visitation. He said, don't you
[1:16:52] wait till some region yonder in the
[1:16:55] damned in that dimension when you cannot
[1:16:57] go in the presence of God. Your time is
[1:17:00] up on earth in the nightmare of horror.
[1:17:03] You'll remember you had your opportunity
[1:17:06] and you turned it away. Amen. Let the
[1:17:08] young people take notice to this. He
[1:17:10] said, "Let all take notice to this."
[1:17:13] Amen. So, a man who turns down his
[1:17:16] opportunity in the presence of God,
[1:17:19] amen, does not forget it, but he will
[1:17:21] remember it when it's too late.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; My goodness. Amen. I think it's powerful
[1:17:26] in our opening scripture. Amen. that
[1:17:28] Jesus Christ is standing there in
[1:17:31] Pilot's hall. And the prophet of God
[1:17:33] said, he said, "I'm holding my point or
[1:17:35] making my point here and saying that we
[1:17:38] are standing today in another Pilot's
[1:17:41] judgment hall." So, we don't have to go
[1:17:43] back 2,000 years ago, but right here in
[1:17:46] Hardy, Arkansas on a Thursday night, we
[1:17:49] are standing in Pilot's judgment hall
[1:17:52] again. He said, "You say, "Well, if I
[1:17:54] would have stood there, I would have
[1:17:56] spoke out for Jesus Christ." Well, what
[1:17:58] are you doing about it now? Well, we
[1:18:01] might as well preach. It's Thursday
[1:18:02] night. What are you doing about it now?
[1:18:05] Amen. What are you giving God now? Are
[1:18:07] Are you just giving him what's left? I
[1:18:09] think this ought to be the best.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; Can I preach? Amen. This ain't our first
[1:18:14] meeting, folks. I think this ought to be
[1:18:16] the best meeting we ever had. I think we
[1:18:18] ought to preach our best sermons. I
[1:18:20] think we ought to sing our best songs. I
[1:18:22] think we ought to give our best
[1:18:23] hallelujah. I think we ought to give the
[1:18:25] devil the best kick that we've ever
[1:18:27] given him. I think it's time, amen, to
[1:18:30] rise and seize the opportunity that God
[1:18:32] has given us in the hour that we're
[1:18:34] living in.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; What are you doing about it now? See, no
[1:18:37] matter how much the church turned him
[1:18:39] down, Amen. You got the opportunity
[1:18:42] right now. Now, makes he brings it down
[1:18:44] real close. In the days of Jesus, Re
[1:18:47] said Pilate was a fool to the world.
[1:18:49] Amen. Jesus was a fool to Pilate, but
[1:18:52] Pilate was a nut. Amen. See, he had
[1:18:54] opportunity, but when he had his
[1:18:57] opportunity to accept it, he wanted some
[1:18:59] kind of clown or some kind of a trick or
[1:19:03] some kind of a magic rabbit. Amen. To
[1:19:05] bring a hat or or you know, he said,
[1:19:07] "Oh, I want to see you do some tricks."
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; He said he was a nut himself. He had a
[1:19:13] chance to receive it, but he didn't. I
[1:19:16] love what the prophet of God said. He
[1:19:18] said, "What should he have done?" He
[1:19:20] said, "He ought to have repented."
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Peter, or Pilate rather, ought to
[1:19:24] have repented when he was standing in
[1:19:26] the presence of the only one who could
[1:19:29] forgive him.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; Now, I think it's powerful that God rich
[1:19:32] in mercy. Amen. In this another judgment
[1:19:35] hall and in another pilot's judgment
[1:19:37] hall, I think it's a powerful thing that
[1:19:39] God has sent us a prophet. Amen. to make
[1:19:42] sure that we did not miss our
[1:19:44] opportunity in the presence of the
[1:19:46] anointed word. I love what Amos said. He
[1:19:49] said, "Surely the Lord God will do
[1:19:51] nothing, but he revealth his secret unto
[1:19:54] his servants, the prophets." Malachi 4,
[1:19:57] "Behold, I will send you Elijah the
[1:19:59] prophets before the coming of the great
[1:20:01] and the dreadful day of the Lord." Now,
[1:20:03] watch this. and he shall turn the heart
[1:20:06] of the fathers to the children and the
[1:20:08] heart of the children to their fathers,
[1:20:10] lest thou would come and smite the earth
[1:20:12] with a curse. Amen. Now, we can't stop
[1:20:14] there. We got to go all the way to
[1:20:16] Revelation 10 when he said, "In the days
[1:20:18] of the voice of the seventh angel, when
[1:20:22] he shall begin to sound, the mystery of
[1:20:24] God should be finished." Amen. As he
[1:20:26] hath declared, Amen. to his servants the
[1:20:29] prophets. Now, he didn't declare this to
[1:20:31] theologians. He didn't declare this to
[1:20:33] reformers. He didn't declare this to to
[1:20:36] to the pope or or to some bishop. He
[1:20:38] declared this, amen, to his servants,
[1:20:41] which are the prophets. I love this word
[1:20:43] servants. Amen. It is one who gives
[1:20:46] himself up to another's will. Amen.
[1:20:49] Those whose service is used by Christ in
[1:20:52] extending and advancing his cause among
[1:20:56] men. So, Revelation 10:7 was not
[1:20:58] fulfilled to take the church back. Oh,
[1:21:02] God. Revelation 10:7 was fulfilled to
[1:21:05] take the church further in the
[1:21:07] advancement of the gospel. Listen, we're
[1:21:10] not going back to dead works, folks. We
[1:21:12] have been anointed by Apostle Paul's
[1:21:15] ministry. I feel like shouting. He said,
[1:21:18] "Let us go on into perfection." Well, if
[1:21:20] there's a call to go to perfection, God
[1:21:23] has fixed it up where somebody is going
[1:21:25] to go to perfection. If there's a pool
[1:21:28] to go to heaven, God has got a heaven
[1:21:30] somewhere that somebody's going to go
[1:21:32] to.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God ain't running his
[1:21:35] business by the
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; I got to be careful. My southern waves
[1:21:39] will come out here.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; God ain't running his business fly by
[1:21:43] night.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; God knows who's going to be at the
[1:21:45] marriage supper of the lamb. Hallelujah.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; See, he sent a prophet to reveal to you.
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; He's not taking you backwards.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; He's taking you further.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; And he's doing it by truth.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; What is truth?
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; Re said it'll take a prophet to get the
[1:22:04] revelation.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; Because God has no other way of bringing
[1:22:08] out his scriptural revelations
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; except by a prophet. Now the word always
[1:22:14] came by a prophet and always will. That
[1:22:17] is the law of God is evident by even a
[1:22:21] casual search of scripture. The
[1:22:23] unchanging God with unchanging ways
[1:22:26] invariably sin is prophet in every age
[1:22:30] where the people had strayed from divine
[1:22:32] order with both the theologians and the
[1:22:35] people having departed from the word.
[1:22:37] God always sent his servant to these
[1:22:40] people. but apart from the theologians
[1:22:44] in order to correct false teaching and
[1:22:47] to lead the people back to God.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; Now, come on. We ought we ought to thank
[1:22:52] God for that.
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Some of us, if you're like me,
[1:22:55] Amen. You didn't graduate Kumladi. You
[1:22:57] graduated. Thank you, Lord. Amen. You
[1:23:00] didn't have any any I'm talking about,
[1:23:03] brother. Amen. You didn't have no
[1:23:04] education and no way to break down all
[1:23:06] these words. But God sent you a prophet
[1:23:09] that could say it in such a way that you
[1:23:11] would understand it that what he was
[1:23:14] saying would pull you from the
[1:23:16] confusion. It would pull you from the
[1:23:18] ideas of man and it would lead you back
[1:23:20] to the God of Abraham. Go church of the
[1:23:23] living God. We're not standing on the
[1:23:25] ideas of the man. We're standing on thus
[1:23:27] sayaith the Lord. We have been led by
[1:23:29] the voice of the seventh angel back into
[1:23:32] the presence of God.
[1:23:34] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. What are you
[1:23:36] saying? I'm saying we was a hopeless
[1:23:38] people.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; Brother Adam, we was a hopeless,
[1:23:41] helpless people. But revelation came.
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Revelation came. You say,
[1:23:48] "Why are you so happy about revelation?"
[1:23:50] Because revelation brings hope.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; Education brings confusion. And theology
[1:23:57] brings bondage, but revelation brings
[1:23:59] hope. Amen. Y'all remember Ezekiel in
[1:24:02] the valley of dry bones? Brother Tommy
[1:24:05] looks across this valley and all he sees
[1:24:07] is dry bones. I love what the Bible
[1:24:10] says. Then he said unto me, "Son of man,
[1:24:12] these bones are the whole house of
[1:24:14] Israel. Behold, they say, our bones are
[1:24:18] dried." Now listen what they said, "And
[1:24:21] our hope is lost. We are cut off for our
[1:24:25] parts." Look at this word hope. But that
[1:24:28] word hope is accord,
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; brother Brian. It's an expectation. It's
[1:24:32] things hoped for. Amen. It means
[1:24:35] outcome.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; Now, y'all heard me say this before.
[1:24:39] Amen. It means outcome. Amen. Amen. You
[1:24:41] want to You want a really deep
[1:24:43] definition of the word outcome?
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; Anybody want one? I'll give it to you.
[1:24:47] Okay. Just rearrange the word and it
[1:24:50] means come out.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; Our bones are dried.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; Our parts are cut off. All hope is lost.
[1:24:58] But they forgot there was a cord of
[1:25:00] prophecy that was tied to those bones.
[1:25:03] Amen. You remember the little boy out
[1:25:05] there flying the kite around? Amen. The
[1:25:07] critic come by and said, "Hey, young
[1:25:09] man, where's your kite?" He said, "It's
[1:25:11] somewhere on the other side of the
[1:25:13] clouds." He said, "Well, you can't see
[1:25:15] that kite." Amen. So, how do you know
[1:25:17] it's there? You know what they say,
[1:25:18] Brother Joe? They say, "You don't see
[1:25:20] your theophony. How do you know it's
[1:25:22] there? You don't see your glorified
[1:25:24] body. How do you know it's there? You
[1:25:26] don't see the rapture. How do you know
[1:25:28] it's there? He said, "Because every now
[1:25:30] and again, I feel a little tug on the
[1:25:33] other side of the clouds, testifying
[1:25:35] that what I believe is there is there."
[1:25:38] Oh, I pray this weekend that God from
[1:25:40] the realms of glory would begin to tug
[1:25:43] on the court of prophecy that is tied
[1:25:45] around your soul and you would lift up
[1:25:47] your heavy hands. You would shake off
[1:25:50] the heavy bands. you would lay aside
[1:25:52] those garments of heaviness and put on
[1:25:54] the spirit of praise and say, "God has
[1:25:56] set this up. God has fixed this up. I
[1:26:00] know there's a reality to my desire."
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; Oh my. God was able to help.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. I was in the airport the other day
[1:26:10] and there was a little boy and brother,
[1:26:12] he was running all over the place and I
[1:26:15] was sitting there at the gate drinking a
[1:26:16] cup of coffee, watching this kid. I
[1:26:18] mean, he was going everywhere. Brother
[1:26:20] Levi, there was something about it. He
[1:26:21] would take off running and then all of a
[1:26:24] sudden he would come back
[1:26:26] and I thought, "What in the world?"
[1:26:29] Then his mama walked by and I said, "I
[1:26:32] got to know what's going on here." She
[1:26:35] flipped a button and said, "See that
[1:26:36] line? It's an invisible cord."
[1:26:39] She said, "He can only go so far." I
[1:26:42] said, "You don't" I said, "You're not
[1:26:44] nervous. He's going to get on another
[1:26:45] plane." She said, "Sorry, Joe." She
[1:26:47] said, "No." She said, "I'm going to turn
[1:26:49] on the lights and I'm going to give a
[1:26:52] little tug and he's going to come back
[1:26:54] to where he belongs." Oh, we ought to
[1:26:56] put on our shouting shoes in the house
[1:26:57] of God. Amen. That devil says, "I'm
[1:26:59] going to take you out of church. I'm
[1:27:01] going to take you here. I'm going to
[1:27:03] take you there and I'm going to put you
[1:27:04] in the tribulation and I'm going to put
[1:27:06] you in the graveyard." But then God,
[1:27:08] rich in mercy, turns on the little
[1:27:10] lights because there's a man here who
[1:27:13] can turn on the lights and he gives a
[1:27:15] little tug and he begins to remind you,
[1:27:18] you didn't come from Leosa, so you can't
[1:27:20] go back to Leosa. You didn't come from
[1:27:23] hell, so you can't go back to hell. You
[1:27:26] came from God and you must go back to
[1:27:28] where you came from.
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; I say, thank God there's a little tug.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He will not lose one of us.
[1:27:37] No sir. No matter how much sickness
[1:27:39] comes, how kind of a death we die, how
[1:27:42] much poverty we go through, God's
[1:27:44] purpose cannot be defeated.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; Well, tell the devil that
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; he will raise us up again.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; Because I live, ye shall live also.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; I love what he said, brother Josh. He
[1:27:58] said, "That's our hope."
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; That's our hope. He said, "Lord, the end
[1:28:01] is nigh. The time is coming and people
[1:28:04] must know with assurityity that we the
[1:28:07] Christians know that our hope is not
[1:28:10] built upon some kind of the mystic
[1:28:12] something but upon purely the word of
[1:28:15] God and a God who can make all things
[1:28:18] work together
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; for us. Amen. I'll say this. We're not a
[1:28:24] hopeless church.
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; There's a hope for the church. You say,
[1:28:27] "What is the hope?" I'll tell you what a
[1:28:29] prophet said. He said, "There is no hope
[1:28:31] left but the second coming of the Lord
[1:28:34] Jesus." He said, "And tonight, the only
[1:28:36] hope of the church is to get away from
[1:28:39] their man-made theologies and get back
[1:28:41] to the Holy Spirit."
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; And in case you're wondering, the same
[1:28:44] Holy Ghost is the same Holy Spirit.
[1:28:47] Amen. And get back to the Holy Spirit
[1:28:49] and get the spirit back in the church.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; Now, I know why they try to break it
[1:28:54] down and make you think there's a Holy
[1:28:55] Ghost and there's a Holy Spirit. It's
[1:28:57] because they're ashamed. Amen. to say
[1:28:59] Holy Ghost because they associate Holy
[1:29:02] Ghost with a bunch of sweating,
[1:29:04] spitting, sweating people called
[1:29:05] Pentecostals. But I want to tell that
[1:29:07] devil, I'm not ashamed of the Holy Ghost
[1:29:10] I got. If it makes me shout, I'll shout.
[1:29:13] If it makes me cry, I'll cry. If it
[1:29:15] makes me run, I'll run. If it makes me
[1:29:18] repent, I'll repent. Because I know my
[1:29:21] only hope is the Holy Ghost and the
[1:29:24] second coming
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm just preaching a little bit
[1:29:28] here tonight. I hope that's okay. Amen.
[1:29:31] Get the spirit back in the church. Now,
[1:29:33] listen what the prophet said. He said,
[1:29:35] "Get the spirit back in the church and
[1:29:38] get the church straightened out."
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; So, putting a certain preacher in the
[1:29:43] church ain't going to straighten it out.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; Putting a certain idea in the church
[1:29:50] ain't going to straighten it out. What's
[1:29:52] going to straighten it out, brother
[1:29:53] Phil? Is putting the Holy Ghost back in
[1:29:56] it.
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. I say that's what we ought to do.
[1:29:58] We ought to open up the doors and let
[1:30:00] the Holy Ghost come back in his church.
[1:30:03] Let him come back unrestricted. Let him
[1:30:05] come back unlimited. Let him come back
[1:30:07] unhindered. Let him come back in the
[1:30:09] power and the authority of who he is.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll tell you. And brother Bram
[1:30:14] said very beautiful. He said it's going
[1:30:16] to take a prophet to straighten it out.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. I love it. I know, brother Kenny.
[1:30:20] Amen. We've been battling this for a
[1:30:22] long time. People don't believe in the
[1:30:23] church age book. But but I love the
[1:30:25] church age book. Come on.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; And in 1964, Brother Bram wrote an audio
[1:30:30] letter to Lee Vale and he said this. He
[1:30:32] recorded it and said, "In order to
[1:30:34] proclaim this, he has to send a prophet
[1:30:37] in order to inject this and make this
[1:30:40] real again
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; to show the people the hour we're living
[1:30:44] in."
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; Because if they only see it in the hour
[1:30:48] past, then there's no hope for the
[1:30:51] church.
[1:30:52] So God has to send a prophet to inject
[1:30:55] the reality of the living presence of
[1:30:57] Jesus Christ. Because if they just see
[1:31:00] it in an hour past, then we're a
[1:31:02] hopeless people.
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; Come on, brother Bo. If we just see it
[1:31:05] in Moses's day or Zachariah's day or
[1:31:08] Abraham's day, we are gathered here a
[1:31:11] hopeless people. But because I have seen
[1:31:14] the day star arise, because I have seen
[1:31:17] the son of righteousness arise with
[1:31:20] healing in his wings, I can believe God
[1:31:22] will give every barren womb a baby. I
[1:31:24] can believe God will heal cancer. I can
[1:31:26] believe God will open blinded eyes. I
[1:31:28] can believe God will save a sinner. I
[1:31:30] can believe God will take a drunk and
[1:31:32] make a preacher out of him. I believe
[1:31:34] God can take a prostitute and make a
[1:31:37] Sunday school teacher out of her. This
[1:31:39] ain't a day gone by. This is the reality
[1:31:42] of the resurrection of Jesus Christ in
[1:31:44] his church again.
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. If it's only an
[1:31:50] hour past, there's no hope.
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; The church must see it
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; in the present tense.
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; So God sends his prophet
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; to manifest it in present tense. All
[1:32:07] right.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; Now, now somebody say, "Well, how does
[1:32:09] God straighten his church out?" Well, I
[1:32:11] love what brother says. He said he will
[1:32:14] plant the seed of the entire Bible.
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; So, the way God corrects the error is by
[1:32:21] the word. Amen.
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; The way God brings his presence back in
[1:32:25] his church. The way God restores truth
[1:32:28] to his church is by sending Malachi 4,
[1:32:32] which is Germanized word,
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; which will plant the entire seed of the
[1:32:37] Bible plumbed from the serpent to the
[1:32:40] messenger in the former reign. He said,
[1:32:42] "But what we need today, brother, is to
[1:32:44] sew the gospel seed of the word of the
[1:32:46] power, the resurrection of Christ, the
[1:32:49] living being that's living with us in us
[1:32:53] now, present tense."
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, God. Brother Wendle, he's not just
[1:32:59] back there. And he's not just up there,
[1:33:02] but he's right here, present tense. See,
[1:33:05] what it is, it's a law, amen, of
[1:33:08] presenting and yielding. Paul said,
[1:33:10] "Amen." Neither yield ye your members as
[1:33:12] instruments of unrighteousness unto sin.
[1:33:15] What is sin? Unbelief.
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; But yield yourselves unto God, as those
[1:33:21] that are alive from the dead, and your
[1:33:24] members as instruments of righteousness
[1:33:26] unto God.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; I love this word yield. It means to
[1:33:30] present.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; It means to pro. It means to provide. It
[1:33:34] means to place a person or thing at
[1:33:38] one's disposal.
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. For sin shall not have dominion
[1:33:42] over you.
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; For ye are not under the law, but under
[1:33:45] grace. What then shall we sin? Because
[1:33:48] we're not under the law, but under
[1:33:49] grace, God forbid. Know ye not. Not to
[1:33:53] whom ye yield yourselves servants to
[1:33:55] obey. His servants ye are. Amen. Listen.
[1:33:58] whom ye obey, whether of sin unto death,
[1:34:01] or obedience unto righteousness. But God
[1:34:05] be faint that ye were the servants of
[1:34:08] sin.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; At one time we were the servants of sin,
[1:34:13] but ye have obeyed from the heart. Oh
[1:34:16] God,
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; ye have obeyed from the heart the form
[1:34:20] of doctrine which was delivered you now.
[1:34:23] Amen. I just can I can I preach, brother
[1:34:25] Ben? Is that okay? You got my liberty.
[1:34:27] Amen. Amen. I just got to be honest with
[1:34:29] you. I'm about I'm about past sick and
[1:34:31] tired of people all the time knocking
[1:34:33] doctrine. Like if you believe in
[1:34:35] doctrine, you're some kind of
[1:34:36] intellectual Christian. Amen. We don't
[1:34:38] need no doctrine. We don't need Well,
[1:34:40] well, let me say this. Thank God we have
[1:34:42] some doctrine. Amen. To separate us from
[1:34:45] a bunch of prostitute daughters and a
[1:34:47] mother system.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; Well, we don't need no doctrine. We just
[1:34:53] need to preach the Bible. They've been
[1:34:54] preaching the Bible for 2,000 years and
[1:34:57] got women wearing pants and men married
[1:34:59] three and four times in pull pits and
[1:35:01] deacons married four and five.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; You know I'm in the message. Amen. It's
[1:35:06] because somewhere they ran off without
[1:35:08] the spirit of God. But I am one believer
[1:35:11] that believes we need to bring the Holy
[1:35:13] Ghost back in the church and let him
[1:35:15] clean up from the pullpit to the back
[1:35:17] door. From the music to the deacons,
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; to the Sunday school teachers, to the
[1:35:22] young people, I say, Lord, straighten
[1:35:24] out your church and put the true
[1:35:26] doctrine back in the church. Put the
[1:35:29] truth back in the church.
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; I'm not I'm just saying what Paul said.
[1:35:35] He said, "Obey from the heart." Now, how
[1:35:37] can you obey from the heart unless God
[1:35:39] sends a prophet to turn the heart? All
[1:35:41] right.
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; You cannot obey from your heart the
[1:35:45] truth unless God sends a prophet to turn
[1:35:48] the heart. Look at this word obeyed. It
[1:35:51] means of one who comes and knocks at the
[1:35:54] door.
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; Well, you all know what Jesus said.
[1:35:58] Brother Jeff, he said, "Behold, I stand
[1:35:59] at the door knock. And if any man hear
[1:36:02] my voice and open the door, I will come
[1:36:05] into him and will suck with him and he
[1:36:07] with me." Now, Ream said it very
[1:36:09] beautiful. He said there will be a voice
[1:36:11] speak to us in the last days. Remember
[1:36:15] they ought to see a sign. He said but
[1:36:17] then look after the sign there will come
[1:36:20] a voice.
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; So when you start seeing signs
[1:36:24] reappearing you got to identify what
[1:36:26] voice is coming behind those signs.
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; He said if any man will c is this okay?
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; If any man will let me in I'll come in
[1:36:36] and will suck with him and they with me.
[1:36:38] He said, "Now see, if any man will open
[1:36:40] the door and just and just cooperate
[1:36:42] with me
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; just a little bit.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; I'll come in and suck with them, I'll
[1:36:48] make myself known to them. If I can just
[1:36:51] get in like I did on the road to Emmas
[1:36:54] that night. If I can just get in, I'll
[1:36:57] make myself known to them." Now, what
[1:36:59] does suck mean?
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; It means to reveal.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; Now, what's he going to reveal when he
[1:37:06] gets inside? Is he going to reveal the
[1:37:09] Baptist Jesus?
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; Is he going to reveal the Pentecostal
[1:37:12] Jesus? He said, "I will reveal that I'm
[1:37:15] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:37:19] The son of man will be revealed in that
[1:37:22] day, and everything else will become
[1:37:24] solemn like that. I'll be on the
[1:37:26] outside, but I'll be knocking trying to
[1:37:29] get in." Listen, someone knocking on the
[1:37:31] door is the presenting of something to
[1:37:34] you. But when you go over and open the
[1:37:36] door, is you yielding to what's being
[1:37:40] presented?
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; Look what the prophet of God said. He
[1:37:43] said, "Now the fle now, now do you
[1:37:45] realize there's things right now
[1:37:46] knocking from your flesh at your heart
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; and there's things knocking on your
[1:37:51] flesh and there's things knocking on
[1:37:53] your heart." He said, "Now the flesh
[1:37:55] will say there's no need. You pretty
[1:37:57] little thing, you're the prettiest
[1:37:59] little thing in school. Now, don't you
[1:38:00] pay no attention to that holy roller
[1:38:02] mother of yours or that fanatic father.
[1:38:05] See, you're the best looking girl in
[1:38:06] school. You're the prettiest boy. You're
[1:38:08] you're the best bill. You're you're the
[1:38:10] most popular there is in the city. And
[1:38:12] you yield your members to that.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; And where do you come out at? At the
[1:38:17] little end of the horn every time.
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; But Paul said, "My flesh wants to always
[1:38:22] yield to that." Your flesh does, too.
[1:38:25] But the law of the spirit
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; of God in the heart overcomes the flesh
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; and makes the body obey what the heart
[1:38:34] says do.
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You're God in your heart
[1:38:39] overcomes the flesh and makes the body
[1:38:43] obey what the spirit says do because
[1:38:46] you're not here belonging to yourself.
[1:38:48] We are God's chosen instruments to
[1:38:51] accomplish God's divine purposes.
[1:38:55] But said, "Look, if God, when I was an
[1:38:57] alien from him, so loved me that he
[1:38:59] stooped down and picked me up,
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; that gives me confidence that he wants
[1:39:04] to use me.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; He's got a purpose in doing it. He's
[1:39:08] seen something in me. He's seen
[1:39:10] something in you.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; He had a reason to save you.
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; You look at the people that's unsaved
[1:39:17] today." He said, "Look at the millions
[1:39:19] he could have took beside you,
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; but he took you.
[1:39:26] Oh God, come on.
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; Look at the millions he could have took,
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; but he took you. See, and no one can
[1:39:33] take your place.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; Well, glory to God. I I was preaching
[1:39:38] somewhere the other day and somebody I
[1:39:40] was down in Alabama and brother brother
[1:39:41] David Templeton, he said, "Brother," he
[1:39:43] said, "Man, you're preaching tonight,
[1:39:44] preaching tomorrow night, preaching a
[1:39:46] three-day meeting." He said, "Man," he
[1:39:48] said, he said, "that that's got to be a
[1:39:49] lot." And I said, 'Well, I said, I
[1:39:51] remember when I first started preaching,
[1:39:52] honestly, brother brother brother Kenny,
[1:39:54] I remember that in order to be
[1:39:56] spiritual, you had to walk around and
[1:39:58] act like you was miserable doing what
[1:40:00] you was doing. You know, well, I don't
[1:40:01] know why I'm preaching it. I don't I
[1:40:03] don't I remember that until one day I
[1:40:05] was listening to a sermon Brother Bisc
[1:40:06] was preaching and he was just preaching
[1:40:08] away and he said, "Are you all enjoying
[1:40:10] this as much as I'm enjoying preaching
[1:40:12] it?"
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; I said, "Praise God." Amen. Amen. It's
[1:40:16] okay to enjoy what God called you to do.
[1:40:19] Somebody say, "Well, Amen. I think you
[1:40:21] ought to be careful." Listen, if you
[1:40:22] come from where I come from and God gave
[1:40:25] you the privilege to stand and preach
[1:40:27] this message to his queen, it's the
[1:40:29] greatest honor of my life. I'd rather be
[1:40:32] standing here than anywhere else in the
[1:40:34] world telling the people that God has
[1:40:36] sent a prophet and the word has been
[1:40:39] restored and the seed has come back to
[1:40:42] seed again.
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It ain't a burden to do what
[1:40:45] God called us to do. It's a privilege.
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; He said, "See, you've not chosen me, but
[1:40:51] I chose you that you should bring forth
[1:40:54] fruit."
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; Now, now, come on, church. Brother Brham
[1:40:57] said, "If the Lord told me to go up here
[1:40:59] and raise George Washington up out of
[1:41:01] the presidential graveyard, I would
[1:41:03] invite the whole world
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; to see it done. It could happen." See,
[1:41:09] for the Holy Ghost said, he said, "And
[1:41:12] you know how." Amen. And now watch. If
[1:41:14] he is in you, he will act his life out
[1:41:17] in you. Just be satisfied. He wants to
[1:41:20] use you.
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; He'll sure do it. See, he knows where
[1:41:25] you're at.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; Brother Daryl, you weren't looking for
[1:41:29] God, but God knew where you was at in
[1:41:31] Jonesboro when he saved you and he
[1:41:34] revealed himself to you. Come on. I
[1:41:35] wasn't looking for God, but God knew
[1:41:38] where I was at when I was a 9-year-old
[1:41:40] boy. and he pulled on my heart and I
[1:41:42] gave my heart to God. What about every
[1:41:44] one of you sitting here tonight? Some of
[1:41:46] you all was running from God. You was in
[1:41:49] bars and an alley rats and everywhere
[1:41:51] else. But God had a purpose in saving
[1:41:53] you.
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; Well, glory to God. He had a purpose in
[1:41:59] saving you because he had a plan for
[1:42:02] your life.
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; You say, "What was that plan?" That plan
[1:42:06] was you was going to be his human
[1:42:10] instrumentality.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; God was going to confirm his word that
[1:42:15] had been restored through human
[1:42:17] instrumentality. Brother said, look, he
[1:42:20] said, so shall my word be that goeth
[1:42:21] forth out of my mouth. It shall not
[1:42:23] return into me void, but it shall
[1:42:25] accomplish that which I please. Look at
[1:42:28] this word accomplish. It means to act
[1:42:31] with effect.
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. So the word will act in your
[1:42:35] life with an effect.
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; He said his word cannot return until
[1:42:40] it's accomplished that which it's been
[1:42:42] spoken for. So God is waiting this
[1:42:45] afternoon
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; on a people that'll take a hold of that
[1:42:49] word and hold it until it's
[1:42:53] accomplished.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; That which it was purposed for. He said,
[1:42:56] "See, the word was sent to the earth by
[1:43:00] God, and it will accomplish exactly
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; it will accomplish exactly what God sent
[1:43:08] it for." Amen. Let me say this. Jesus
[1:43:10] was the word made flesh and he came into
[1:43:13] the earth, but he came to accomplish the
[1:43:16] purpose of God. Now listen, the purpose
[1:43:19] of God was coming through human
[1:43:21] instrumentality from heaven.
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; Can I say what a brother said? He said,
[1:43:26] "Now we are left, as we understand, to
[1:43:30] carry on the work that he come to
[1:43:32] accomplish his death at Calvary. He was
[1:43:35] with us." And he, now this is a powerful
[1:43:38] quote. And he come out of God into the
[1:43:41] world. See, he went from the world into
[1:43:44] God and come again in the form of the
[1:43:48] Holy Spirit
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; and is with us
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; to the end of the world, carrying out in
[1:43:56] his church the same work that he did
[1:43:59] when he was here on the earth.
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; Well, if I was the devil, I'd try to
[1:44:06] shut you up, too.
[1:44:09] because you're not coming by your own
[1:44:12] will.
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; The Bible said, "Lo, he came in the
[1:44:16] volume of the book."
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; Jesus found the place that it was
[1:44:20] written and said, "This is written of me
[1:44:23] to fulfill this portion of scripture."
[1:44:25] And you know what the prophet of God
[1:44:26] said? He said, "The same word that
[1:44:29] speaks of the bridegroom, it speaks to
[1:44:31] the bride." So the same book that Jesus
[1:44:34] stepped out of is the same book that the
[1:44:38] seventh angel called this bride from.
[1:44:40] Listen, we didn't come by the flesh of
[1:44:42] our mothers or our fathers. We come by
[1:44:45] predestination.
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; Well, get out of our way, devil. We're
[1:44:49] not a bunch of church members. We're
[1:44:51] sons and daughters of God who have not
[1:44:53] stepped from some seminary. We have not
[1:44:56] stepped from some college. We have
[1:44:58] stepped from the volume
[1:45:00] [Applause]
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; of the book.
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, where are you getting
[1:45:04] at?" He said in his ministry today, he
[1:45:07] said, "Now, there's many people in the
[1:45:08] Bible that teaches the Bible as a
[1:45:10] historical book,"
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; which it is,
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; but it's more than a history.
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; It's a prophetic book.
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; It foretells it what it was. It tells
[1:45:22] what it'll be.
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; Y'all want to preach with me? Come on.
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; Do you accept that to be truth?
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; What is truth?
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; The same Jesus
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; that was
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; is
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; and will be.
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; Brother said, "Now his ministry carries
[1:45:44] on." I'm having fun giving the devil
[1:45:46] black eyes. He said, "Anoint thy servant
[1:45:49] and pack me from this sensebound
[1:45:52] existence into the spheres where you
[1:45:55] live."
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; He said, "The same spirit," are you with
[1:45:58] me?
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; That began the works of the father and
[1:46:01] to finish the atonement. Now listen, to
[1:46:04] make a way
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; that we could carry the message.
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; Oh God.
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother Wendle, his
[1:46:12] atonement made a way
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; that we could carry the message. If that
[1:46:17] spirit's in you, you'll have the same
[1:46:20] attitude towards people.
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; Now, we might as well just let the
[1:46:24] rubber hit the road preacher for a
[1:46:26] second. Amen. Because if you're carrying
[1:46:28] the same message that William Brandon
[1:46:30] brought, you'll have the same attitude
[1:46:33] towards the people
[1:46:37] that he had. And his wasn't a bitter
[1:46:39] attitude. It wasn't a critical attitude.
[1:46:42] Every time he got a pullpit, he didn't
[1:46:44] tell who heard him and who offended him
[1:46:47] and who cut him and who didn't listen to
[1:46:49] him. Every time he got a pullpit, he
[1:46:52] took the same attitude that Jesus Christ
[1:46:54] took and said, "I'm not here as a great
[1:46:57] big guy. I'm here as God's servant." He
[1:47:00] said, "I'm here to be a help to my
[1:47:02] brother and a help to the doctor's
[1:47:04] patient and a servant to God's child."
[1:47:07] See, if the spirit's in you, you'll have
[1:47:10] the same attitude, trying to do what you
[1:47:12] can to help them.
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; That's right,
[1:47:15] sir.
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; Now, can I preach? Come on,
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; sir.
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; No matter who they are,
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; or where they are,
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; he said you'll try to help people.
[1:47:30] [Applause]
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; May as well preach. Come on.
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; No matter who they are,
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; that's good.
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; Or where they are,
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; you'll try to help people. Come on,
[1:47:42] brother. I'm standing on the platform
[1:47:43] and there comes that maniac all fours
[1:47:45] with a chain on him. And he said, I was
[1:47:47] just going to pass him by. He said, but
[1:47:49] there was something crying out.
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; There's a soul in there.
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; See, we are the instrumentality of God.
[1:47:57] We present our bodies a living
[1:47:59] sacrifice. This revelation didn't come
[1:48:01] to live on the bookshelf, folks. This
[1:48:04] message didn't come to be pictures on
[1:48:06] the wall.
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; The Bible said that this is the house
[1:48:10] that God dwells in.
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; He don't dwell in a building with a big
[1:48:15] bell on the top of it and a high
[1:48:17] steeple. He said, "But a
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; a body hast thou prepared me? A body
[1:48:24] that God can dwell in, that God can walk
[1:48:26] in, that God can see in, that God can
[1:48:30] talk in, that God can work in."
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:48:33] Now, here's the beautiful thing about
[1:48:35] it, Brother Brian. He has moved into us,
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; and we have moved into him.
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "At that day ye shall guess
[1:48:46] that I am in the Father, and ye in me,
[1:48:48] and I in you." Is that what it says? At
[1:48:51] that day ye shall know, said, "The word
[1:48:54] becomes you and you become the word."
[1:48:57] See, at that day, what day? This day.
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; Oh my. What are you getting at,
[1:49:03] preacher? I'm saying his presence has
[1:49:05] returned to the church.
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; He's not here in the sheetrock. He's not
[1:49:12] here in the carpet. He's not here in the
[1:49:14] pews. He is here in the redeemed flesh
[1:49:18] that his atonement made a way for him to
[1:49:20] move into.
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Deity is not in heaven.
[1:49:25] Brother Ben, deity is on the earth.
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; I'm not looking for deity. I'm looking
[1:49:31] at deity. I'm not trying to find God.
[1:49:34] I'm looking at God in his people.
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; Wherever two or three are gathered
[1:49:39] together in my name, there am I in the
[1:49:42] midst.
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; We're happy today to be alive with the
[1:49:47] opportunity to once again preach the
[1:49:49] gospel, the uncarchable riches of Jesus
[1:49:51] Christ
[1:49:53] &gt;&gt; as we present him to the people today in
[1:49:57] the form of the written word.
[1:50:01] Now,
[1:50:01] &gt;&gt; I love what a prophet said. He said that
[1:50:04] he brought again the Lord Jesus from the
[1:50:05] dead
[1:50:07] &gt;&gt; and has presented him to us this morning
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; in the form of the Holy Spirit.
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; Let me say this to you. God has always
[1:50:15] been on the earth
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; in some form.
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; He said, "Now he is here." Can't you see
[1:50:21] the son of man? the son of man in the
[1:50:25] form of prophetic message
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; returning back again in his church
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; in prophecy revealing Jesus Christ the
[1:50:35] same yesterday today and forever now
[1:50:39] come on folks either we preach the truth
[1:50:41] or we don't
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; can we just say what a prophet said it's
[1:50:45] never been done through the age till
[1:50:48] this time
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; so it's a changing of dispensation
[1:50:53] The mighty angel didn't descend in the
[1:50:55] book of Acts. The mighty angel descended
[1:50:57] in Revelation 10 at the changing of a
[1:51:00] dispensation because it was the return
[1:51:03] of the presence of the Lord Jesus to
[1:51:05] give faith to his children and to endure
[1:51:08] with them knowledge. His presence is
[1:51:10] here.
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; And if he is here, then all things are
[1:51:14] possible.
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. I'm just going to have to
[1:51:16] preach. My ministry is a different
[1:51:18] ministry. My ministry is to declare him.
[1:51:21] See, he is here.
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; Remember said what Jesus was is what his
[1:51:27] presence is now.
[1:51:29] &gt;&gt; You say, "I wish I'd have been standing
[1:51:31] there when he healed the bomb Barameus.
[1:51:33] I wish I would have been there when he
[1:51:35] opened the eyes of the beggar. I wish I
[1:51:38] would have been there when he raised the
[1:51:39] widow of name son." Can I say this to
[1:51:42] you? The same Jesus that was there in a
[1:51:45] corporal body is right here tonight in a
[1:51:49] many member body. Lo, I have come in the
[1:51:53] volume of the book.
[1:51:55] &gt;&gt; He's here.
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; Well, somebody tell that devil, devil,
[1:51:58] it's time for you to get out. He's here.
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; Devil, it's time for you to get out.
[1:52:04] He's here. He's here in power. He's here
[1:52:07] in authority. He's here in anointing.
[1:52:10] He's here in reality. He's here in
[1:52:12] healing. He's here in revelation. He's
[1:52:14] here in supreme power. He's here in
[1:52:17] supreme authority. The supreme
[1:52:19] intelligence of Jesus Christ is right
[1:52:22] here in this building tonight.
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; You say, "Preacher, you lost your mind."
[1:52:29] I ain't lost my mind. Re said he's
[1:52:31] supreme. He's right here now and he's
[1:52:34] supposed to return.
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; Well, let's preach a return ministry.
[1:52:38] You want to?
[1:52:41] All right. Come on, brother.
[1:52:42] &gt;&gt; Brother Ben, don't run out on me.
[1:52:44] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:52:45] &gt;&gt; He's supposed to return
[1:52:47] &gt;&gt; in the last days.
[1:52:49] &gt;&gt; We know that through human flesh.
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; And declare himself the same way.
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; We're all aware of that. If you are,
[1:52:58] say, "Amen."
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:01] &gt;&gt; Now, anybody want some comfort?
[1:53:04] Now, for your comfort, I say this to you
[1:53:06] in his name. He is here.
[1:53:11] &gt;&gt; The same God that came down and talked
[1:53:14] to Abraham and had his back turned to
[1:53:17] the tent and Sarah inside the tent. He
[1:53:20] knew what she was thinking.
[1:53:23] &gt;&gt; Oh, we have broke out of the
[1:53:25] dispensation of denominational revivals,
[1:53:28] folks. We have broke out of the
[1:53:30] dispensation of personality revivals. We
[1:53:33] have stepped into the son of man
[1:53:35] dispensation where the same Jesus that
[1:53:38] discerned the woman at the well that
[1:53:42] Hallelujah that God and Melzdc and
[1:53:44] Elohim and discern Sarah is right here
[1:53:48] in this building tonight. He knows your
[1:53:51] heart. He knows your desire. He knows
[1:53:54] where your baby is. He knows where your
[1:53:56] healing is. He knows Hallelujah. He's
[1:54:00] here.
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; What is truth? It's here tonight,
[1:54:05] brother Tim.
[1:54:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; I'm not.
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; I will not leave you comfortless.
[1:54:12] &gt;&gt; I will not leave you comfortless.
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; I will come to you.
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; Y'all ever look that word comfortless
[1:54:20] up? Fatherless.
[1:54:25] &gt;&gt; I will not leave you without a father.
[1:54:32] [Applause]
[1:54:33] Wonderful.
[1:54:34] &gt;&gt; I will not leave you.
[1:54:39] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; And the devil
[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; come tell you what to believe.
[1:54:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; But God sent a prophet
[1:54:47] &gt;&gt; and said, "We got a parent
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; and it's the word."
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:53] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:54:54] &gt;&gt; now what are you saying, preacher? I'm
[1:54:56] saying this. We're not ignorant.
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; We're not confused.
[1:55:02] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; We're not looking for something.
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:55:07] &gt;&gt; We're not trying to have a meeting.
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; We're not trying to have a revival.
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; Come on now,
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; Sister Corine. We are the revival.
[1:55:18] Hallelujah.
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; See the prophet God said, "May the
[1:55:24] pillar of fire, may the pillar of cloud
[1:55:27] move into the people today
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; and sober them Lord
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; to the realization of the presence of
[1:55:35] the living and mighty God."
[1:55:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. I brother Josh and I was just
[1:55:39] there in Czech Republic and I was
[1:55:41] ministering there on Saturday night and
[1:55:42] I'd never called it before so clear as I
[1:55:44] was just preaching Revelation 10:1. I
[1:55:47] saw another mighty angel come down from
[1:55:49] heaven and he was clothed with a cloud
[1:55:51] and a rainbow was up on his head and his
[1:55:53] face is were the sun. Y'all ever read
[1:55:55] that? Amen. In just in just one
[1:55:58] sentence, brother Josh, it goes from the
[1:56:00] head to the feet.
[1:56:04] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; In just one little
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; I'm that guy. I'm sorry. In just one
[1:56:11] little punctuation mark, it goes all the
[1:56:14] way from the head to the feet. And I got
[1:56:16] to thinking, how in the world does it
[1:56:19] skip from the head to the feet so quick?
[1:56:21] Because the Bible said he hath put all
[1:56:24] things under his feet. Who is his feet?
[1:56:28] His feet was as pillars of fire. And the
[1:56:31] prophet of God said, "Let the pillar of
[1:56:33] fire move into the people right now and
[1:56:36] sober them to the realization that
[1:56:39] headship is not coming. Headship is
[1:56:42] here."
[1:56:44] You say, "I want to put the devil under
[1:56:45] my feet." Well, now's the high time to
[1:56:47] do it. Now's the golden opportunity.
[1:56:50] Now's the supreme moment. When you see
[1:56:52] the headship identifying the body, it's
[1:56:56] the time. The rapture is at hand. I tell
[1:56:59] you tonight, and I'm just going to
[1:57:01] preach a second. I tell you, it's time
[1:57:03] to quit playing with devils. It's time
[1:57:05] to quit playing with spirits. It's time
[1:57:08] to quit playing church. You're not just
[1:57:10] another people. You're not just another
[1:57:12] church. You are the identified return of
[1:57:16] the presence of Jesus Christ by the
[1:57:18] baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:57:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:57:25] &gt;&gt; He's here tonight.
[1:57:27] &gt;&gt; I said he's here tonight.
[1:57:29] &gt;&gt; I said he's here tonight.
[1:57:31] &gt;&gt; He's here right now.
[1:57:34] &gt;&gt; He's here right now.
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; Can I tell you what the devil don't want
[1:57:37] you to realize? The devil don't want you
[1:57:39] to catch the revelation that Jesus
[1:57:42] Christ, the son of God, is right here
[1:57:44] tonight. Because the second that that
[1:57:47] revelation strikes your soul that Jesus
[1:57:50] Christ is in this building is the second
[1:57:53] that devil becomes a defeated foe.
[1:57:59] Can
[1:57:59] &gt;&gt; I tell you this tonight, your devils are
[1:58:01] already defeated. Them spirits are
[1:58:03] already broken. Them tormentors are
[1:58:05] already defeated. It's your time to take
[1:58:08] possession as the
[1:58:12] as the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:58:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, I know what that devil says. That
[1:58:18] devil says sleep through this. That
[1:58:20] devil says, "Look at your watch through
[1:58:21] this." That devil says, "How many pages
[1:58:23] has he got and how many
[1:58:26] &gt;&gt; I know what that devil says." That devil
[1:58:28] says, "Well, just hurry up. We got to
[1:58:30] get out of here." Amen. But can I tell
[1:58:31] you what God says? He says, "When you
[1:58:33] recognize his presence,
[1:58:36] You release his power.
[1:58:39] &gt;&gt; And you're looking at one preacher that
[1:58:41] will not be limited by a clock. I will
[1:58:44] not be limited by frowns. I will not be
[1:58:46] limited by stairs. Because I know if we
[1:58:49] just keep on knocking, if we keep on
[1:58:51] asking, before long, the Holy Ghost is
[1:58:54] going to come in the building. We don't
[1:58:56] need another meeting. We need a
[1:58:58] breakthrough. We don't need another get
[1:59:00] together. We need the Holy Ghost to
[1:59:02] break out again and shake us from the
[1:59:04] top of our head to the soles of our
[1:59:06] feet.
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; You know what my Bible says? If any two
[1:59:11] or three agree is touching any one thing
[1:59:13] upon the earth, it shall be done in
[1:59:16] heaven.
[1:59:18] &gt;&gt; No matter how much God is standing
[1:59:20] present, you've got to believe it.
[1:59:24] [Music]
[1:59:26] &gt;&gt; You got to believe it. I'm telling you
[1:59:28] tonight, folks, we're not beggars. We're
[1:59:30] believers.
[1:59:32] &gt;&gt; We're not beggars. We're believers.
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:38] &gt;&gt; We're not beggars, brother Daryl. We're
[1:59:40] believers.
[1:59:42] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:59:43] &gt;&gt; That devil don't like that. You know
[1:59:45] why? Cuz that devil's put you in a
[1:59:46] begging condition. And every meeting,
[1:59:48] you're begging God. And every morning
[1:59:50] you pray, you're begging God. Your
[1:59:52] prayers ain't even prayers no more. They
[1:59:54] become begging sessions.
[1:59:57] Well, we might as well preach. We roam
[1:59:58] all the way up here. Amen. Your prayers
[2:00:01] have become begging sessions. And oh
[2:00:03] God, please. Oh God, oh God, please
[2:00:05] save. Oh God, please heal. Can I say
[2:00:08] this to you? We're not going in these
[2:00:10] meetings beggars.
[2:00:12] &gt;&gt; We're going in these meetings believers.
[2:00:16] &gt;&gt; Beggars beg God. Believers believe God.
[2:00:21] &gt;&gt; You say, "What are you saying?" I'll
[2:00:22] tell you what I'm saying. I'm over in
[2:00:24] the book of Mark the 10th chapter when
[2:00:26] there was a blind man sitting by the
[2:00:27] highway side and he was begging until
[2:00:30] the word Hallelujah. He was begging when
[2:00:34] I'll shout by myself. He was begging
[2:00:37] until the word come walking by his way.
[2:00:40] And when the word come by, the word
[2:00:42] said, "You don't have to beg for your
[2:00:44] healing. Believe for your healing."
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; We don't have to beg God for an answer.
[2:00:50] We believe God for an answer. I don't
[2:00:53] have to beg God to heal you. God's
[2:00:55] already healed you.
[2:00:57] I don't have to beg God to save your
[2:00:59] babies. He's already saved them. I don't
[2:01:02] have to beg God to deliver you from that
[2:01:04] habit. He's already delivered you. You
[2:01:07] just got to break out of the confusion
[2:01:10] and the tradition and the ideas of man
[2:01:12] and break out in the realms of faith
[2:01:17] &gt;&gt; and believe God like a Messiah is.
[2:01:21] That's it.
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; That's it right there.
[2:01:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:24] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:01:26] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[2:01:28] &gt;&gt; G.
[2:01:29] &gt;&gt; Well, glory to God.
[2:01:32] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:01:33] &gt;&gt; You say, "Preacher, you're getting way
[2:01:34] out there with that begging." No, I'm
[2:01:35] not.
[2:01:37] &gt;&gt; Go look at the word begging. You know
[2:01:39] what it means? It means asking one to
[2:01:41] make an addition.
[2:01:43] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:01:44] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:01:45] &gt;&gt; I was preaching that the other day,
[2:01:46] brother, somebody got a little to about
[2:01:47] it. Well, you talking about begging. I
[2:01:50] said, 'Well, it's real simple to make an
[2:01:52] addition. Asking one to make an
[2:01:53] addition. They said, "You can't prove
[2:01:55] that by the message." I said, "You
[2:01:57] forgot I got books and tapes, too,
[2:01:58] didn't you?"
[2:01:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:01] &gt;&gt; You know what brother Bam said? He said,
[2:02:02] "If he was standing here in this suit of
[2:02:05] clothes he gave me, he could do no more
[2:02:07] for you."
[2:02:09] &gt;&gt; So, there was no need to stand there and
[2:02:11] beg God,
[2:02:13] right? He had already done it.
[2:02:16] Satan, I adjure thee in the name of the
[2:02:19] living God. He's already done it. He's
[2:02:22] already healed. He's already saved. He's
[2:02:26] already gained the Holy Ghost. Put
[2:02:28] miracles in the building.
[2:02:32] He's right here tonight. Come on. You
[2:02:34] want to take this meeting to another
[2:02:35] level? Quit begging God. Quit begging
[2:02:38] God and start believing God. Believe him
[2:02:41] like a Messiah. Believe him like a son
[2:02:43] of God. ought to believe.
[2:02:46] I like to beg God to heal. I believe
[2:02:48] God's already healed.
[2:02:55] &gt;&gt; You say, "You lost your mind." I haven't
[2:02:56] lost my mind. God has appeared right
[2:02:59] here. The God of heaven has appeared
[2:03:01] right here in this building in the form
[2:03:04] of his word.
[2:03:06] &gt;&gt; What are you saying, preacher? I'm
[2:03:08] saying God
[2:03:10] &gt;&gt; God
[2:03:11] &gt;&gt; has ordained another opportunity.
[2:03:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes. Thank you, Lord,
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; to come in these meetings.
[2:03:21] &gt;&gt; God,
[2:03:22] &gt;&gt; you say, "Preacher, you lost your mind."
[2:03:24] I haven't lost my mind. I've got the
[2:03:26] mind of Christ.
[2:03:27] &gt;&gt; And the mind of Christ calls every
[2:03:29] promise of God present tense.
[2:03:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:36] &gt;&gt; What are you saying? I'm saying this.
[2:03:38] &gt;&gt; We're not begging God.
[2:03:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah. We're standing.
[2:03:42] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:03:43] &gt;&gt; On vindicated word.
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:03:47] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:03:49] &gt;&gt; Can I say to you like this?
[2:03:51] &gt;&gt; You're at the right place.
[2:03:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:56] &gt;&gt; At the right time.
[2:03:57] [Music]
[2:04:00] &gt;&gt; God fixed this.
[2:04:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:04] &gt;&gt; He's going from Judea
[2:04:07] &gt;&gt; to Galilee.
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And he must have needs to go by
[2:04:10] Hardy.
[2:04:11] [Applause]
[2:04:19] &gt;&gt; Why are you going by Hardy, Lord?
[2:04:23] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:04:24] &gt;&gt; I only do that what the Father shows me.
[2:04:28] &gt;&gt; Why are you going down there to that
[2:04:29] whale? Y'all ever notice something? When
[2:04:32] Jesus got there, the woman didn't show
[2:04:34] up and beg him to be there.
[2:04:36] He was already there.
[2:04:39] &gt;&gt; You know what God has done this weekend?
[2:04:41] God has arranged these meetings through
[2:04:44] human instrumentality to deal with the
[2:04:46] needs of his believing children. Can I
[2:04:48] say this to you? I I had a lot I wanted
[2:04:51] to preach tonight, but I'm going to
[2:04:52] follow the Lord on this right here. He's
[2:04:55] already fixed it. He's already set it
[2:04:58] up. He's already got everything in
[2:05:00] place. You're not here by accident.
[2:05:02] You're a part of the vision. This wasn't
[2:05:04] seen yesterday, Gabby. This was seen
[2:05:07] from before the foundation of the world.
[2:05:10] God didn't see you victorious yesterday,
[2:05:12] Judah. He saw you victorious before you
[2:05:14] was ever even born because there was a
[2:05:17] predestinated seed
[2:05:20] &gt;&gt; on the inside of your soul. Come on,
[2:05:22] church. When the when Pilate Oh, God, I
[2:05:25] feel like preaching. When Pilate stood
[2:05:27] there, he looked at Jesus and he said,
[2:05:29] "What is truth?" But when that ill-famed
[2:05:31] woman when she looked at Jesus, she
[2:05:34] didn't say, "What is truth?" She said,
[2:05:35] "You are the truth." She said, "I know,
[2:05:38] Messiah."
[2:05:40] Do you see the difference in nonseed and
[2:05:43] in seed? In nonseed, there's nothing to
[2:05:45] quicken, but in seed, there is something
[2:05:48] to quicken. You say, "Why am I here?"
[2:05:50] Because you're not pilot.
[2:05:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You're not pilot. You're the
[2:05:56] bride of Jesus Christ and there's a seed
[2:05:59] on the inside of your soul.
[2:06:02] And when you saw this message, you
[2:06:04] didn't say, "What is truth?" You said,
[2:06:06] "This ain't nothing but the truth." You
[2:06:10] said, "This is the evil screen."
[2:06:13] &gt;&gt; You know why? Because God fixed it that
[2:06:15] way.
[2:06:19] [Applause]
[2:06:20] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:06:21] &gt;&gt; God fixed it that way.
[2:06:24] Come on.
[2:06:26] &gt;&gt; God didn't leave the devil any room
[2:06:31] &gt;&gt; to change in time what he done in
[2:06:34] eternity.
[2:06:36] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:06:38] &gt;&gt; Forever s.
[2:06:40] &gt;&gt; Now, she was still in flesh, brother
[2:06:42] Wendle.
[2:06:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[2:06:44] &gt;&gt; You know how I know that? Because she
[2:06:47] said these words.
[2:06:50] &gt;&gt; Oh my. She said, "The Jews
[2:06:52] &gt;&gt; have no dealings
[2:06:55] &gt;&gt; with the Samaritans."
[2:06:59] &gt;&gt; Didn't scare him one bit, Levi.
[2:07:01] &gt;&gt; Didn't back him up one bit, brother.
[2:07:03] &gt;&gt; You know why? You know why, brother
[2:07:05] Colin? Because it wasn't a Jew
[2:07:08] &gt;&gt; coming to deal with a Samaritan.
[2:07:12] &gt;&gt; It was the predestinated word.
[2:07:16] Yes.
[2:07:17] &gt;&gt; It was the predestinated word coming to
[2:07:20] quicken the predestinated seed.
[2:07:24] &gt;&gt; You say, "Why am I here tonight?"
[2:07:26] Because it wasn't a Baptist Jesus. It
[2:07:29] wasn't a Methodist Jesus. It wasn't a
[2:07:31] Pentecostal Jesus. It was the God of
[2:07:34] Abraham. It was the God of Isaac. It was
[2:07:37] the God of the Bible. And he wasn't
[2:07:39] coming to deal with the blood of the
[2:07:41] American blood or the Israelite blood or
[2:07:43] the Egypt blood or European blood. He
[2:07:46] was coming to deal with a seed on the
[2:07:49] inside of your heart. You know what I
[2:07:50] tell that devil tonight in closing? I
[2:07:52] say devil, you're too late.
[2:07:55] I say, devil, you're too late. I say,
[2:07:58] devil, you're too late. We already know
[2:08:01] what truth is. We already believe the
[2:08:04] message. We've already got the Holy
[2:08:06] Ghost. We already believe Jesus Christ
[2:08:09] is revealed in the form of the son of
[2:08:11] man through the bride's body.
[2:08:14] &gt;&gt; Devil,
[2:08:15] &gt;&gt; you're too late.
[2:08:16] &gt;&gt; Won't you stand on your feet tonight?
[2:08:19] &gt;&gt; Devil,
[2:08:20] &gt;&gt; you're too late.
[2:08:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:08:24] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:08:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:08:26] &gt;&gt; When you heard the word,
[2:08:29] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[2:08:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When you heard the word
[2:08:34] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[2:08:34] &gt;&gt; you know where you come from.
[2:08:40] &gt;&gt; Brother Ben.
[2:08:41] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:08:43] &gt;&gt; You know,
[2:08:45] &gt;&gt; what was the truth,
[2:08:47] &gt;&gt; sir?
[2:08:48] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:08:49] &gt;&gt; My Thank you.
[2:08:50] &gt;&gt; I've often said it like this. Where,
[2:08:52] Brother Josh, did that baby eagle go get
[2:08:54] an education to know what an eagle
[2:08:56] scream sounded like?
[2:08:57] Come on.
[2:08:59] &gt;&gt; Fair enough question.
[2:09:00] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:09:01] &gt;&gt; Where did he go get a seat or go get a
[2:09:04] go get an education
[2:09:06] &gt;&gt; on what an eagle sounds like?
[2:09:09] &gt;&gt; He didn't
[2:09:10] &gt;&gt; because what was
[2:09:13] &gt;&gt; because what he needed to recognize the
[2:09:16] eagle scream was already in him.
[2:09:21] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:09:23] When Mama Eagle flew over, she didn't
[2:09:26] teach him how to scream.
[2:09:27] &gt;&gt; She didn't teach him how to how to
[2:09:29] become an eagle. He always was an eagle.
[2:09:32] &gt;&gt; Reb said, "You know what was the truth?"
[2:09:34] He said, "You were always the seed was
[2:09:36] in you always."
[2:09:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:41] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[2:09:43] &gt;&gt; Tell me one time the seed wasn't in you.
[2:09:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:49] &gt;&gt; Glory,
[2:09:49] &gt;&gt; brother Allan. One time the seed wasn't
[2:09:51] in you.
[2:09:54] Amen.
[2:09:56] &gt;&gt; Come on, folks.
[2:09:57] &gt;&gt; It was with you, too, buddy.
[2:10:01] &gt;&gt; We have too much fun.
[2:10:03] &gt;&gt; The seed was always in you.
[2:10:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:10:07] &gt;&gt; Come on, Benji. I don't mean to call you
[2:10:09] out, but when you was over there in that
[2:10:11] tradition of menite, when was the seed
[2:10:13] of God put in you?
[2:10:14] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[2:10:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, sir.
[2:10:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:20] &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah.
[2:10:22] &gt;&gt; The word seen the word
[2:10:25] &gt;&gt; that was in you that was before the
[2:10:28] foundation of the world
[2:10:31] &gt;&gt; saw the word.
[2:10:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:10:32] &gt;&gt; And you come to it.
[2:10:36] &gt;&gt; Listen folks, it might have not been the
[2:10:39] choice place that she wanted to meet the
[2:10:41] Messiah.
[2:10:43] &gt;&gt; But when God fixes something,
[2:10:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And when God sets something
[2:10:48] up,
[2:10:49] &gt;&gt; he makes sure every detail's right.
[2:10:52] [Music]
[2:10:54] &gt;&gt; I know it's simple.
[2:10:56] &gt;&gt; But has it ever dawned on you, brother,
[2:10:58] since she was a filthy woman?
[2:11:01] &gt;&gt; He didn't meet her at the synagogue.
[2:11:05] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:11:05] &gt;&gt; He didn't meet her down at the temple.
[2:11:08] &gt;&gt; He met her at the well.
[2:11:10] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:11:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. She was in a bad shape
[2:11:13] mentally and physically. But he met her
[2:11:16] at the well.
[2:11:17] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[2:11:17] &gt;&gt; He said what happened? She discovered
[2:11:20] that scriptural fountain had spoken to
[2:11:22] her
[2:11:23] &gt;&gt; by scriptural sign
[2:11:24] &gt;&gt; that she had been looking for and she
[2:11:27] left Jacob's denominational system
[2:11:29] &gt;&gt; and never went back to it again.
[2:11:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:33] &gt;&gt; Because
[2:11:34] &gt;&gt; I can preach an hour right there.
[2:11:39] &gt;&gt; She didn't go get Dr. adoption's ideas
[2:11:41] and
[2:11:43] &gt;&gt; Pentecostal preachers ideas.
[2:11:46] &gt;&gt; She had found the real rock.
[2:11:48] &gt;&gt; She was through with sin. She was no
[2:11:51] more a foul woman. He said that sister
[2:11:54] might have been all right. It had served
[2:11:56] its purpose. But now she was at the true
[2:12:00] fountain.
[2:12:01] &gt;&gt; The sister had been all right until the
[2:12:05] true fountain was open.
[2:12:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But when the true fountain
[2:12:09] come along,
[2:12:10] [Music]
[2:12:13] &gt;&gt; the system lost its strength.
[2:12:16] &gt;&gt; She found a better place to drink.
[2:12:19] &gt;&gt; And there's a better place
[2:12:21] &gt;&gt; and that's in Christ.
[2:12:24] &gt;&gt; What are you saying, brother Andrew?
[2:12:26] &gt;&gt; I'm saying you're at the fountain
[2:12:27] tonight.
[2:12:30] &gt;&gt; What are you going to do with your
[2:12:31] opportunity?
[2:12:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, yes.
[2:12:33] &gt;&gt; What are you going to do with your
[2:12:34] opportunity?
[2:12:36] What did she do with it?
[2:12:39] &gt;&gt; She threw down the bucket.
[2:12:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:41] &gt;&gt; And she recognized
[2:12:42] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:12:43] &gt;&gt; This is that.
[2:12:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:12:47] &gt;&gt; This is that.
[2:12:50] &gt;&gt; You say, "Preacher, I don't know if I've
[2:12:52] got an opportunity tonight." Well, I
[2:12:53] tell you what a prophet said. He said,
[2:12:55] "There's a fountain open plunging our
[2:12:58] souls beneath its crimson flow."
[2:13:01] &gt;&gt; To come up on the other side, washed.
[2:13:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:05] Where we went in sinners, we come out
[2:13:07] saved.
[2:13:09] &gt;&gt; We go in sick and come out well. Oh God,
[2:13:13] we go in downtrodden,
[2:13:17] disheartened,
[2:13:19] weary, tossed about by every little
[2:13:22] thing
[2:13:24] and come out on the other side of
[2:13:28] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:13:30] &gt;&gt; Brother Daryl, what a fountain.
[2:13:31] Hallelujah.
[2:13:32] &gt;&gt; He said, "How we thank thee
[2:13:35] &gt;&gt; for this great opportunity."
[2:13:38] &gt;&gt; He said, "Thank God there's a fountain
[2:13:40] filled with blood."
[2:13:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:42] &gt;&gt; He said, "Now listen, Lord, you don't
[2:13:44] make church members. You make Christians
[2:13:47] out of them
[2:13:48] &gt;&gt; when they come
[2:13:50] &gt;&gt; to that fountain."
[2:13:52] &gt;&gt; Maybe you're like that woman at the well
[2:13:54] tonight.
[2:13:55] Maybe you're approaching these meetings
[2:13:58] downhearted,
[2:14:00] &gt;&gt; discouraged,
[2:14:01] downtrodden,
[2:14:03] weary, maybe sick and body. I don't
[2:14:06] know.
[2:14:08] &gt;&gt; But can I tell you something tonight?
[2:14:11] If you just start drinking right now,
[2:14:13] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:14:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:15] &gt;&gt; You'll come out on the other side of
[2:14:16] these meetings established.
[2:14:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:19] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[2:14:20] &gt;&gt; how many say tonight, Lord?
[2:14:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Tonight, Lord.
[2:14:24] &gt;&gt; I want to seize
[2:14:26] the golden opportunity.
[2:14:29] &gt;&gt; Tonight, Lord. Tonight, Lord. Not
[2:14:33] tomorrow. Not the next day.
[2:14:36] &gt;&gt; Right now, Lord.
[2:14:37] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[2:14:38] &gt;&gt; She realized she was standing by the
[2:14:41] fountain of purity.
[2:14:43] &gt;&gt; She realized she was standing by the
[2:14:45] only thing that can forgive her.
[2:14:47] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you.
[2:14:48] &gt;&gt; Listen tonight, friends. Your standing
[2:14:51] is the only thing that can reveal to you
[2:14:53] truth.
[2:14:54] &gt;&gt; And the Bible said, "Ye shall know the
[2:14:56] truth,
[2:14:57] &gt;&gt; and the truth
[2:14:59] &gt;&gt; shall make you free."
[2:15:00] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[2:15:01] &gt;&gt; I want you to bow your hearts with us
[2:15:03] tonight.
[2:15:05] I say this to you tonight on the first
[2:15:06] night of these meetings.
[2:15:09] Satan,
[2:15:11] he don't want you to give in. He don't
[2:15:13] want you to yield to the presence of
[2:15:16] God. Yeah. by the vindicated word.
[2:15:20] Satan, he don't want you to know what
[2:15:23] truth is.
[2:15:25] He don't want you to experience truth.
[2:15:29] He don't want you to really get a hold
[2:15:32] of truth.
[2:15:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:15:34] &gt;&gt; He don't want this truth to come into
[2:15:36] your life because truth exposes him.
[2:15:40] Truth uncovers his hiding places.
[2:15:45] But you're got an opportunity tonight in
[2:15:47] the presence of truthless.
[2:15:50] &gt;&gt; God has allowed you to live another day.
[2:15:55] Give you another meeting. Give us
[2:15:57] another service.
[2:16:00] &gt;&gt; Let's not look at him and say, "What is
[2:16:03] truth?"
[2:16:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[2:16:05] &gt;&gt; Let's look at it tonight and say, "This
[2:16:08] is nothing but the truth."
[2:16:09] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Thank you, Lord. Brother Bram
[2:16:12] stands there and screams out, "Oh word
[2:16:13] believers, give in to my message.
[2:16:17] &gt;&gt; Hear me. Not my message, but his
[2:16:21] message."
[2:16:21] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[2:16:22] &gt;&gt; That he firmly declares to be the truth.
[2:16:26] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:16:27] &gt;&gt; You've got to choose from somewhere. You
[2:16:30] can't sit still after this.
[2:16:32] &gt;&gt; You've got to make your choice. I ask
[2:16:35] you tonight, what's your choice?
[2:16:39] What's your choice tonight?
[2:16:41] Morabus,
[2:16:43] denominational teachings,
[2:16:46] traditions,
[2:16:48] man's ideas,
[2:16:50] customs,
[2:16:52] rituals,
[2:16:54] formalisms,
[2:16:55] or truth.
[2:16:58] &gt;&gt; With every head bowed, every eye closed,
[2:17:01] you make your decision tonight.
[2:17:04] I choose truth.
[2:17:06] I want truth tonight. Yes, Lord.
[2:17:09] &gt;&gt; I want that same attitude, Lord.
[2:17:12] &gt;&gt; I want I want the power of God.
[2:17:14] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:17:15] &gt;&gt; I want the realities of God.
[2:17:17] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[2:17:18] &gt;&gt; I want I want the authority of the Holy
[2:17:20] Spirit.
[2:17:21] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[2:17:22] &gt;&gt; I want the character of Jesus Christ.
[2:17:26] &gt;&gt; I want the nature of my Lord.
[2:17:28] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:17:29] &gt;&gt; I want to be that body he has prepared.
[2:17:34] Almighty God, we're in your presence
[2:17:37] tonight by a divine promise.
[2:17:41] Lord, you made a covenant with your
[2:17:43] believing children
[2:17:45] that where two or three would gather in
[2:17:46] your name, there you would come and be
[2:17:49] in their midst. Now, Lord, the world
[2:17:52] tonight is confused.
[2:17:55] Religion is confused.
[2:17:58] Father, they've substituted realities
[2:18:00] with creeds.
[2:18:02] Lord, they've substituted revelation
[2:18:04] with traditions.
[2:18:07] Lord, they've substituted the blood with
[2:18:08] a handshake.
[2:18:10] They've replaced the Holy Ghost with
[2:18:13] just a church membership.
[2:18:15] And Lord, the world don't know what
[2:18:17] truth is. But Lord, we've had the
[2:18:20] privilege to stand in another Pilot's
[2:18:23] judgment hall. And Lord, we're not
[2:18:25] looking at the corporal body of our Lord
[2:18:28] Jesus
[2:18:29] and saying what is truth. But Lord,
[2:18:33] you've sent a prophet in this hour to
[2:18:36] open this book that we call the Bible,
[2:18:39] to open this sacred love letter, this
[2:18:41] historical book, this prophetic book.
[2:18:45] And Lord, you have come in the volume of
[2:18:47] this book. And Lord, you come to do the
[2:18:50] will of the father. And Lord, we're not
[2:18:53] gathered here tonight looking at this
[2:18:55] message and saying, "What is truth? What
[2:18:58] is truth?"
[2:19:00] &gt;&gt; But Lord, we're looking at this message
[2:19:02] and everything we're hearing a prophet
[2:19:04] say,
[2:19:05] &gt;&gt; Lord, we're saying that ain't nothing
[2:19:07] but a truth.
[2:19:08] &gt;&gt; And Lord, word is climbing and piling up
[2:19:11] on top of word and precept upon precept
[2:19:13] and line upon line. Lord, you're not
[2:19:16] building a building. You're building a
[2:19:19] bride. Yes,
[2:19:20] &gt;&gt; you're building a body, Lord.
[2:19:22] &gt;&gt; Now, Father, I pray the power of the
[2:19:23] Holy Spirit that is so moved across this
[2:19:26] congregation tonight, Lord. Father, I
[2:19:29] believe you've moved among us in the
[2:19:30] preaching of your word, Lord, settling
[2:19:33] the atmosphere, Lord, making demons
[2:19:36] uncomfortable and removing them, Lord.
[2:19:38] Father, binding spirits of unbelief and
[2:19:41] binding plaguing spirits of fear and
[2:19:43] doubt. Lord, you've set this meeting up,
[2:19:46] Father.
[2:19:47] &gt;&gt; Lord, you fixed it, Lord. Now, Lord,
[2:19:50] you've sent your word. And Father, I'm
[2:19:52] so thankful tonight that you've got a
[2:19:55] people. Lord, unlike Pilate, you got a
[2:19:57] people like that woman at the well. And
[2:20:01] we're at the right place at the right
[2:20:02] time. And you've come to deal with our
[2:20:05] hearts and lives. Father, may this
[2:20:08] meeting be more than just a meeting.
[2:20:10] Father, may it be more than just a
[2:20:12] gathering, Lord.
[2:20:14] Lord, may it be a place of
[2:20:16] transformation.
[2:20:18] May hearts be changed.
[2:20:21] &gt;&gt; May lives be changed. Oh God, move among
[2:20:24] us this weekend. Lord,
[2:20:27] &gt;&gt; reveal yourself. Lord,
[2:20:30] declare your presence.
[2:20:32] Father, without these believers, we
[2:20:34] couldn't have a meeting. But Lord,
[2:20:37] you've come in the flesh of your bride.
[2:20:42] Move among us in Jesus name. Amen.
[2:20:46] With every head bowed, every eye closed.
[2:20:47] I wonder if there'll be one tonight.
[2:20:49] Say, "Lord, I feel the tug.
[2:20:52] Lord, I feel that tug.
[2:20:55] Lord, let this be the meeting.
[2:20:58] Let this be the meeting that I come in
[2:21:00] downtrodded and discouraged and
[2:21:02] disheartened, sick and body,
[2:21:06] but I come out established.
[2:21:08] Thank you,
[2:21:09] &gt;&gt; I come out strengthened. I come out
[2:21:11] positioned. I come out renewed. Thank
[2:21:14] you, Jesus.
[2:21:15] &gt;&gt; I come out refreshed.
[2:21:16] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:21:18] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:21:18] &gt;&gt; I come out not desiring the worldly
[2:21:21] water anymore.
[2:21:23] &gt;&gt; Lord, wash me
[2:21:25] &gt;&gt; in the waters of your word, Lord.
[2:21:27] &gt;&gt; Lord, search my heart, oh God.
[2:21:30] &gt;&gt; Lord, search my heart.
[2:21:32] &gt;&gt; How many say tonight, Lord, search my
[2:21:34] heart?
[2:21:36] &gt;&gt; Lord, send your word through this
[2:21:38] building in a powerful way, Lord. Lord,
[2:21:41] &gt;&gt; Lord, visit the men of God in their
[2:21:42] studies and visit them in their prayer
[2:21:44] times. And Lord, lay the things upon
[2:21:47] their heart that I have need of, Lord.
[2:21:50] &gt;&gt; I don't want to leave here the same way.
[2:21:53] &gt;&gt; I want to leave here changed.
[2:21:55] &gt;&gt; I want to leave here strengthened, Lord.
[2:21:58] &gt;&gt; I want to leave here refreshed.
[2:22:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, that's it tonight. God bless you
[2:22:02] there, sis.
[2:22:03] &gt;&gt; God bless you there, brother.
[2:22:05] &gt;&gt; He sees your hand tonight.
[2:22:07] &gt;&gt; He's right here in this building
[2:22:08] tonight.
[2:22:09] Jesus Christ, the son of God, is right
[2:22:12] here
[2:22:12] &gt;&gt; in divine presence tonight.
[2:22:14] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:22:15] &gt;&gt; He's here to fulfill every promise of
[2:22:17] his word.
[2:22:19] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you.
[2:22:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:22:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:22:26] &gt;&gt; Cuz all that I have is a hallelujah.

[2:22:40] And I know it's not much, but I have
[2:22:44] nothing else made for a king
[2:22:50] except for a heart single.
[2:22:59] Hallelujah.
[2:23:00] [Music]
[2:23:04] [Applause]
[2:23:05] [Music]
[2:23:10] All my words fall short.
[2:23:16] I've got nothing new.
[2:23:22] How could I express
[2:23:28] all my gratitude?
[2:23:34] I could sing these songs
[2:23:40] as I often do.
[2:23:46] But every song must sing
[2:23:52] and you never do.
[2:23:56] Oh, so I'll throw up my hands and praise
[2:24:02] you again and again.
[2:24:07] Cuz all that I have is a hallelujah.

[2:24:26] else fit for a king
[2:24:31] except for a heart singing hallelujah.
[2:24:36] [Music]
[2:24:51] I've got one response.
[2:24:55] [Music]
[2:24:57] &gt;&gt; I've got just one move
[2:25:03] &gt;&gt; with my arms stretched wide.
[2:25:08] Oh, I will worship you.
[2:25:14] Oh, so I throw up my hands and praise
[2:25:20] you again and again.
