I can't sing it very good, but we're going to try it. Kev, rise above it all. and we're just going to sing the the verse to it this or the chorus to it this morning. Brother Trip, if you can give me just a little bit more in the monitors. If I mess up, I like to hear myself mess up. Keeps me humble. Amen. I'm going to rise, rise, rise above it all.

I'm going to rise, rise, rise above it all. I'm going to spread my wings and fly away to heaven and rise above it all. Amen. You looking forward to that day? Amen. Just before we have the ushers come, let's sing that song. We'll slow it down just a little bit. I pledge allegiance to the Lamb. I have heard how Christians long ago they were brought before a tyrant's throne. And they were told that he would spare their lives if they would renounce the name of Christ. But one by one they chose to die. the son of God. They will not deny like a great angel. I can almost hear their voicees ring. I pledge alance to the lamb. With all my strength, with all I am, I will seek to honor his command. I pledge aliance to the lamb. Now the years have come and the years have gone, but the cause of Jesus still goes on. Now our time has come to count the cost to reject this world to embrace the cross. So one by one let us live our lives for the one who died to give us life till the trumpet sounds on that final day. Let us proudly stand and we lift our hands and sing it to him. I pledge aliance to the lamb with all my strength. With all I am, I will sing to honor his command. I pledge. And then once again as the ushers come to the lamb. Oh, I pledge alance to the lamb. With all my strength, with all I am, I will seek to honor his command. I pledge alce to the lamb. Amen. You love the Lord this morning. And we got a lot of requests this morning. Maybe if they just play something softly. And this is from Sister Janie. Says, "I have a special unspoken request for my brother." And then from sister uh Britney says, "Please pray for brother JT Hi and the family and the loss of Sister Clelet." So just be remembering them this morning and God would just send them a special touch. This is please pray for Sister Kim Weekes. She has an urgent need in her body. Also, please pray for Jimmy Yates and Katie. They're fighting stage 4 cancer. So just be praying for those families mentioned there. And then from sister Stephanie, um an unspoken prayer request from her and the family. So just be praying for them. And then from brother David says Lizzie Joe was has congestion and coughing and having some trouble breathing. Very good. And and also Gabe and Millie are both sick as well. Um so just be praying for them. And then also Sister Alice Morgan um is going to have a bone infusion Monday. So just remember her in prayer. She goes in for that. And then for brother Bobby and sister Robin, brother Bobby's aunt Nita, she's in the hospital with cellulitis and an abscess on her um tibia. She had surgery yesterday for this. So just be praying for her uh to recover from that. And then brother Harvey requested, please remember Shakina and Tim's family. They've all been sick this week. So just be praying for them. A lot of sickness going around. Amen. But we know that God is the healer. Amen. Brother Jeremy, maybe if you come take these needs for us. Amen. If you have an unspoken request this morning, if you just want to make it known by the uplifting of your hand. Let us pray. Lord, we love you, Father, and we thank you again for this opportunity that you've given us, Lord. this opportunity to gather together with brothers and sisters of like precious faith, Lord. And we come to you today as a needy people, Father. Lord, no doubt everyone here has a need in their heart, Father, a need in their life, Father, a spiritual need, a physical need, a financial need, Father. You know each one, Father. And I pray that you would come by their way, Lord. I pray for all the unspoken prayer requests, Lord, for the healing that's needed, Father. Lord, just for the strength of the families, the dealing with death of loved ones. Father, I pray you would give them a special touch today. Lord, we pray, Father, that you would just be with us today. That you would you would move us aside, Father, that you would just come down, you would speak to us, Father, Lord, but not speak to us like a man, Father, but that you would just come down and speak through our minister today, Father. That you would give us what we're in need of, Lord, words of everlasting life, Father. and we thank you for this opportunity again, Lord. We just pray that you would just be with the tithes and the offerings, Lord. It's in Jesus name we pray. Amen. You can be seated as the ushers come by because he lives. All my fear is gone because I know, yes, I know he holds my future and life is worth the living just Because he lives. Once again with our hands lifted to him. Oh, because he lives. I can face tomorrow because he lives. All my fear is gone because I know yes I know he holds my future and life is worth the living just because he lives. Amen. Thankful we serve a living God this morning. Amen. Let's sing that song. Don't have any special uh songs this morning. So, Amen. This will be our special. Let's sing that song. I'm amazed. We've got the key of F. Amen. Let's start with the verse or the chorus there. Oh, I'm amazed. amazed that you love me. And I'm so amazed that you care. Through your precious blood, I found pardon. And my sins are washed. They're all washed away. All my sins are washed away. No one knew how alone I was feeling. And the emptiness I tried so hard to hide. Though I laughed and said my life was fine without you. I was covering up the secret tears I cried. Then one day someone told me of your mercies and the love you showed on a hill called Calvary. There you died and purchased my redemption. When you broke sin's power and set my spirit free, I'm amazed that you love me. I'm amazed that you care. It was through your precious blood I felt pardoned. Oh, and my sins are washed. They're all washed away. Oh, my sins are washed away. Yes, it's true. There have been days when I failed you, Lord. You know the many times I've gone astray. But I've learned your love is stronger than my weakness. And your ear is open every time I pray. No one else has ever cared for me like you, Lord. Other friends could never be as close to me. I'm not afraid to face the problems of tomorrow. Knowing you are everything I'll ever need. I'm amazed that you love me. I'm so amazed. Through your preious blood, I felt pardoned. Oh, and my sins are washed. They're all washed away. Oh, my sins are washed away. Are you thankful your sins are washed away this morning? Let's sing that little chorus. I just want to please the Lord key of C. Is that your desire this morning? Just to please him. Amen. Oh, I just want to please the Lord. Be in his will in every way. To be lost in his presence, found in his lightness. to hear him say, "Well done someday." Oh, I just want to please the Lord. Be in his will in every way. to be lost in his presence, found in his likeness. To hear him say, "Well done, son." Amen. Let me hear you sing it this morning. Oh my I'm going to sing it once again all together. Oh, I just want to please the Lord. Be in his will in every way. To be lost in his presence, found in his likeness. To hear him say, "Well done someday. I love you, Lord, for your mercy never fails me. All my days I've been held in your hands. From the moment that I wake up until I lay my head all my life, all my life you have been faithful. And all my life you have been so so good. With every breath that I have made, I will sing the goodness of God. I love your voice. You have led me through the fire. In darkest night, you are close like all my life. All my life you have been faithful. And all my life you have been so with every breath that I am able. Oh, I will sing of the goodness. Sing that chorus once again all my life. And all my life you have been faithful. And all my life you have been so so good with every breath that I am. Oh, I will sing of the goodness of God. Amen. He certainly is good to us. Amen. And let's go ahead and stand as we change the word of the service over. We ask brother Ben to come. Amen. We just feel his presence here this morning. Let's sing that song if we could. Draw me Lord. Key of sea. Amen. As we invite our pastor to come this morning. Amen. I believe we've entered in worship. Draw me Lord. Draw me Lord. Oh, draw me, Lord. And I'll run after you. Draw me, Lord. Oh, draw me, Lord. Oh, draw me Lord. Oh, draw me Lord and I'll run after you. Lord, I need you now. Lord, I need you now. Lord, I need you now. Lord, I need you now. So come and take me away. Draw me, Lord. Oh, draw. Oh, do you want to be drawn to his presence this morning? Just sing it now. Won't you draw me, Lord? Oh, please draw me, Lord. And I'll run after you. We bow our heads together for a word of prayer. Heavenly Father, it's so good to be back in your house again this morning. Lord, we thank you for that drawing that we feel. We know, Lord, that without you putting something in our heart, we could never be drawn. We are drawn this morning because there is life there. And we are so thankful for that, Lord. Oh God, may we never lose the wonder of it. that we never lose the attraction, oh God, to your presence, to your word. Pray you would to humble us before you today. Lord, move me out of the way. Lord, speak to your people. I pray this morning. Maybe there'd be some need that I wouldn't know anything about. Lord, I don't ask you to reveal it to me and just ask you to speak, Lord, Lord, to the situation. Pray you'd grant it today. We thank you for all that you've done, Lord. We thank you for the the things that you've given us, Lord, and the blessings, but Lord, we're needy people this morning. I pray we'd always maintain that sense of urgency, Lord. Lord, how we need you. Draw us, Lord. We will run, Lord, we will run to your presence. We will respond. We thank you for that today. I pray you'd heal every person, touch every heart. We pray in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. God bless you this morning. Amen. Do you love the Lord this morning? So good to be in the house of the Lord and to know that he's here with us because he promised that he would be 2 Timothy chapter 4 and verses 7 and 8. 2 Timothy chapter 4 vers 7 and 8. Brother JT, it's good to see you this morning. We uh we sure love you and and uh love sister Clelet and uh she's missing this morning, but she's in a much better place and a congregation. You know, Brother Brandham said that this place was uh as much like heaven on earth as we could be was gathered with the saints. And I'm so thankful that there's another place, a better place. You may be here this morning. You may be hurting. You may be you may be weary. But over there, there's none of that. and so thankful for that today. We'll let you know about the funeral. They weren't able to meet with the folks there because of the holidays, but we'll let you know and trust that some of us will be able to go this week and honor our sister for her memorial and just pray for brother JT for strength and and the entire family. Amen. For comfort. Second Timothy chapter 4 and verse 7. This this week, Brother uh is going to be a busy week. Brother Jason Jackson is going to be here Wednesday night. I know sometimes we can't come on Wednesdays and I know some of you live far away, but if you can come this Wednesday night, this may never happen again. So, Brother Jason's coming and they're going to let out their service and come over and be with us. So, we we want to honor that them being willing to do that and and try to be here on Wednesday night. So, we sure enjoy fellowship of those uh in our area and we want to support them all that we can and they're supporting us by coming. Next Sunday, we'll have the election of our officers. Next Sunday morning, the re-election of our deacons and trustees and then u uh so be here for that if you can. And then next Sunday night, we'll have communion. We'll go ahead and do that next Sunday night, the Lord willing. Second Timothy 4:7, I have fought a good fight. I have finished my course. I have kept the faith. And as forth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day. Notice the confidence that Paul has. He said, "I have fought a good fight. I have finished my course. I have kept the faith. And there is laid up for me a crown of righteous righteousness which the Lord the righteous judge shall give me that day. Not to me only unto all them also that love his appearing." I pray the Lord would add his blessing to the word. You may be seated this morning. Brother Joel is preaching in Wisconsin this morning. Keep him in your prayers. I I heard an expression and it come to my heart this week and come to my mind as I was preparing this. It's a little bit different. It actually comes from the movie industry. Uh and the expression is that's a wrap. If you've ever heard that, it's an expression made by the director of a movie when filming is complete and all the acting is done. And they say that's a wrap. It speaks of finality. But it speaks of more than that. It speaks of satisfaction with the work. And Paul is expressing satisfaction with his own walk with the Lord. He's saying, "I fought a good fight. I've kept the faith. I I've I've lived among you and and you've seen my life and things and he he knows what he was. He knows that it's the grace of God that made him what he what he became. But he also is expressing a satisfaction with his own walk with the Lord. Listen to him in Philippians chapter 1 and verse 21. He said, "For to me to live is Christ and to die is gain." In other words, he said, "I know where I'm going." How many could say amen to that this morning? I know where I'm going. And I was speaking to brother Bill Curtis when he continued to pray for him unable to be or go anywhere right now. But brother Bill told me, he said, "I know where I'm going." He said, "If I would have passed away," he said, "I would have known where I was going." I'm thankful for confidence like that. I I think we all ought to be that way that we know where we're going. If you don't know where you're going this morning, we can know. There's a way that we can know, and that's by the blood of Jesus Christ, by the salvation that he gives us by the seal of the Holy Ghost. Now he said, "But if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labor." He said, "Yet what shall I choose? What not?" He said, "For I am in a straight betw twix too, having a desire to depart." He said, "And to be with Christ, which is far better," he said. So, in other words, this world can't compare to that one. Right? That one's far better than this one could ever be. He said, "But I," he said, "Nevertheless, to abide in the flesh," he said, is more needful for you. So, he said, "The people need me." And he said, "So for your sakes, I'm going to continue on. I'm going to continue fighting. I'm going to continue doing what I'm doing." So it wasn't yet a wrap for Paul's life. That's a wrap is said at the end of a production. It's also said at the very end of the process, but it's it's it's also said every time a portion of the film is complete. So if they finish a day's filming, that's a wrap. The film goes into the can, it's done. every time a particular actor is finished because some of us might not make it till the rapture. He said, "We which are alive and remain to the coming of the Lord, there will be those that sleep and they go to meet meet him first and they raise even before we're changed." And and I'm thankful for that. But but so they're just there early, but they are their their work is over at a certain time. There's a time when the director says that's a wrap. Everything that you were called to do has been done. Everything that you were purposed for has been done. Oh, I'm so thankful that that we can have confidence in God that he knows when the time is. &gt;&gt; There were opportunities in every day that will never be presented to us again. Have you ever thought about that? Whatever you do today, whatever opportunities you have today will never be presented to you again. You'll never be the age you are now again. &gt;&gt; We just come through Christmas time and I my children, they were a lot more fun when they were younger, you know, and and and opening gifts and things. They they they anticipated it in a different way and they just love Christmas and they still do. But but I you know, they you can't relive that time. &gt;&gt; Every time it passes, it's over. It's a wrap. &gt;&gt; It's done. It's put in the can. Right? It's over. Filming is done. And so whatever happened that day can't be redone. It's over. It's passed. That's why they call it the past. &gt;&gt; Right? The good thing about that is that you can put it in the past, right? Whatever happened can be in the past. You don't have to relive it again today. I'm so thankful for that. But your children will never be the age that they are now. right today. Right. And I think we ought to spend time with them. I think we ought to take time for our families and and take time for our young people because they will never be this old again. Someone has said that today is the only living time. Every other day is dead or unborn, right? It's the only time that's alive is today. And life is designed so that you never get time back. Every day filming is done. And the great director says that's a wrap. &gt;&gt; Everything that could be done was done and it's over. &gt;&gt; And I know that's a sobering thought, but brother Brandon says it this way. He said each one, he said we each one come down to the end of the road. He said where we're going to give account for every word. You know the Bible teaches that. He said every idle word that men shall speak, right? They'll give an account for. He said we're going to give an account for every word. He said, "Right now, we know that our voices when we are born, our first little cry goes all on a tape. It's going to be played back again at the day of judgment." You realize when you speak something, that's why words are so important. In fact, in uh one of the prophets in the Old Testament, he he told them, he he told the people of Israel, he said, "Bring words and repent." Bring with you words. What's he saying? Words are important. And it matters what you say because what you say can't be unsaid, right? You can say, "I'm sorry." But it can't be unsaid. &gt;&gt; Everything that you've ever said is still out there. &gt;&gt; It's still traveling. In fact, science has proved that if you could get far enough away from the earth and had something that you could pick it up with, every audio wave that's ever went out, every every word that's ever been spoken could be heard again. In fact, if there are aliens, if there if there would be someone many many light years away. They could be hearing things that were spoken on the earth many many years ago, right? Because they've just now traveled that far. That's why you have echo, right? Because what you're hearing if you go stand at a canyon and you speak and and your words go across when you hear it back, it's just taken that long to travel across and come back. Oh, church, do you realize how important it is the way that we act and the things that we say? No wonder David said, "Let the let the words let the words of my mouth and the meditation of MY HEART BE ACCEPTABLE in your sight, oh God. I I want it to I want it to be known that I serve the Lord. I want to speak the right things, say the right things." Brother Brown said, "Even the clothes that you wear will be showed in your face at the day of judgment." Even science has found that by television. See, television doesn't manufacture a picture. It only channels it. The color of clothes, every time you move, every thought in your mind is absolutely kept on God's record. Now, think about that for just a moment. GOD'S NOT LIMITED even to just what YOU SAY OR WHAT YOU OR the moves that you make, but he actually knows the thought of your heart. And every thought THAT'S IN YOUR HEART IS ABSOLUTELY KEPT ON GOD'S RECORD. YOU SAY, "WELL, I HATE THAT PERSON, BUT I just won't tell them. I'LL JUST KEEP IT IN MY HEART." GOD KNOWS YOUR HEART. &gt;&gt; He knows about that. He knows THAT BITTERNESS. HE KNOWS THAT HATRED. HE KNOWS WHAT'S ON THE INSIDE. &gt;&gt; I say, "God, cleanse me today." David said, "Cle, Lord, cleanse me from secret faults." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; EVERY THOUGHT THAT'S IN YOUR MIND IS ABSOLUTELY KEPT ON GOD'S RECORD, AND THAT big thing will be laid right before you, right? There's going to be a premiere one day. uh to use the industry uh jargon. There's going to be a premiere one day and and your life is going to be played before you. I know it's sobering this morning. I want us to think about it cuz we're going somewhere today. But but your life is going to be played before you. Brother Brand said that big thing will be laid right before you. Every one of them filthy dresses YOU WORE. EVERY TIME YOU WENT TO THE BARBER SHOP, CUT THAT HAIR God give you. Obviously, he's talking about women there. He said it's going to be you'll answer for it. You can't make a move right there. just even the thoughts of your heart while you're doing it will be played right before you. HE SAID, "HOW ARE YOU GOING TO ESCAPE? HOW SHALL WE ESCAPE IF we neglect so great a salvation?" He said, "See, WE'RE NOT GOING TO ESCAPE. EVERY MOVE AND THE THOUGHTS of the heart is recorded right in another dimension, even the color of clothes that you wear." Can you imagine? It's played back in another dimension. Now again, brother Brandon said, "We have blundered into science enough to wake us up for FOR REALITIES TO KNOW THAT EVERY move that we make goes around and around the world the same time that we make it. So there's nothing hidden." The Bible says there's nothing hidden with him with whom we have to do. In other words, there's nothing hidden with the one that we'll actually have to answer to. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; He said, he said, you know, EVERY MOVE WE MAKE goes around around the world the same time we make it. We got that through television. He said, 'Oh God, do they realize that every word we say scientifically proven it's on a record and it starts when we start living in this earth. It ends when we die AND IT'S PUT IN GOD'S ALBUM to be played back again at the judgment. You realize the first lie that you ever told if you're if it hasn't been repented of if you're not a Christian, &gt;&gt; the first lie THAT YOU EVER TOLD IS ON RECORD. &gt;&gt; And it's enough to condemn a person. Oh yeah. Come on. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; IT'S ENOUGH RIGHT THERE TO JUSTIFY going to hell. But I'm so thankful for the blood of Jesus Christ that cleanses us from all sin this morning. I'M SO THANKFUL FOR A BLOOD THAT WASHES IT AWAY. &gt;&gt; But said, "Oh, dear God." He said, he said, "These words never die. They go on and on. The record will be played." He said at the day of jud the judgment you seen those hands that went up father it'll be right there at the day of judgment also what their heart was thinking &gt;&gt; will be there at the day of judgment. &gt;&gt; Now we know as message people we understand that the bride doesn't go through judgment. How many know that &gt;&gt; we're going to be there but we actually sit in judgment with him. Paul said, "Don't you know that the saints judge angels?" So, we're going to be there. But we are we are going to be called to account before God. You say, "Well, how does that work? If all of my actions come before God, all of my deeds come before God, how could I ever be justified?" See, your life will be played. But remember, he is the director of the movie, and he actually takes the part of YOUR LIFE THAT'S PLAYED OUT. THINK ABOUT it for just a moment. Everything you've done, everything you've said, EVEN THE THOUGHTS OF YOUR HEART ARE ALL OUT THERE FOR YOU. Are you with me now? Everything's there. And then the director has a RIGHT TO TAKE OUT THOSE PARTS. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; You can't do it. &gt;&gt; I can't do it, &gt;&gt; but he can do it. &gt;&gt; He has a right to edit the footage. &gt;&gt; That That ought to be enough to make a Baptist shout. &gt;&gt; Brother Paul, HE HAS A RIGHT TO EDIT THE FOOTAGE. HE HAS A RIGHT TO COME IN AND THOSE THAT FIRST LIE THAT YOU EVER TOLD ONCE YOU HAVE YOUR YOUR SINS ARE UNDER THE BLOOD. HE JUST CUTS that out. Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; Every sin that you committed &gt;&gt; can be placed under the blood. &gt;&gt; And if it is put under the blood, what what happens to it? IT'S COMPLETELY DONE AWAY WITH. &gt;&gt; And it's NOT THAT HE DESTROYS THE FILM, BUT HE EDITS OUT THE PARTS that were offensive to him. &gt;&gt; So he goes through it. Oh my, aren't you glad for a good editor? He don't miss nothing. HE DON'T LEAVE NOTHING. OH MY. EVERY SIN IS CUT OUT BY GOD. EVERY ONE OF THEM. IF YOU'RE WASHED IN THE WATER OF THE WORD TODAY, DON'T YOU REALIZE HOW IMPORTANT IT IS THAT WE'RE WASHED. DON'T YOU REALIZE THE VALUE OF THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR? THE VALUE OF THE BLEEDING WORD IN OUR DAY, THE FULLNESS OF THE ATONEMENT, IS THAT THIS WORD ACTUALLY WASHES US. IT CAUSES US TO BE FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST. AND WHEN WE'RE FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST, IT'S A SEAL THAT NONE OF THESE THINGS CAN BE BROUGHT BACK TO YOU ANYMORE. IT'S A WRAP. IT'S OVER. YOUR LIFE IS SEALED. AND WHATEVER IT IS THAT YOU HAVE DONE OR WILL DO IS COMPLETELY EDITED OUT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AREN'T YOU GLAD FOR SO GREAT A SALVATION? OH, THAT OUGHT TO STIR US UP THIS MORNING. IT OUGHT TO BRING SOMETHING IN OUR HEART SO WE CAN KNOW, GOD, YOU SAVED ME AND YOU DID AWAY WITH THE PARTS THAT OFFENDED YOU. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. OH, cuz there's been MANY PORTIONS OF MY LIFE THAT I WOULDN'T WANT SHOWN ON THAT DAY. THERE HAVE BEEN MANY PARTS OF YOUR LIFE, MANY THOUGHTS OF YOUR HEART THAT YOU WOULDN'T WANT SHOWN ON THAT DAY. BUT HE RESERVES THE RIGHT TO EDIT THE FOOTAGE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HE MADE A PROMISE THAT YOU WERE JUSTIFIED AS THOUGH YOU NEVER DID IT IN THE FIRST PLACE SO THAT WHEN THE MOVIE IS PLAYED, IT NEVER SHOWS UP ON THE MOVIE. IT THAT PART OF YOUR LIFE NEVER COMES UP. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; OH, THEN I THINK WE OUGHT TO LEAVE 2025 IN THE PAST. YES, &gt;&gt; we ought to WE OUGHT TO FORGET THOSE THINGS THAT ARE BEHIND. HE SAID, "BUT I MADE A LOT OF MISTAKES, BUT THE EDITOR CHOSE YOU. HE CALLED YOU AND HE HE PUT THAT PART ON THE CUTTING ROOM FLOOR." AMEN. HE THREW IT AWAY. HE DID AWAY WITH IT IN THE SEA OF HIS FORGETFULNESS NEVER TO BE REMEMBERED AGAINST YOU ANYMORE. OH, THAT OUGHT TO MAKE us that ought to do something for our hearts today. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He just takes that film and he &gt;&gt; splices it. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. G. &gt;&gt; Think about it. Yes, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; Now they do it digitally. They sit at a computer. You can take a You can take even one of our services, you take it digitally and just cut out a part. Oh my. He chose to cut out a part. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hey, I think we ought to I think we ought to let him forgive us today. &gt;&gt; Let the past be the past. &gt;&gt; Let it fall on the cutting ROOM FLOOR. LET IT BE DONE AWAY WITH TODAY. GET A REAL REVELATION OR JUSTIFICATION UNTIL WE CAN BE FREE OF IT. HE SAID, "DEVIL, YOU TRY TO TELL ME I DID IT." LOOK AT THE MOVIE. IT'S NOT THERE ANYMORE. GOD CUT IT OUT. LISTEN, YOUR HUSBAND CAN'T DO THAT FOR YOU. YOUR WIFE CAN'T DO IT FOR YOU. THE CHURCH CAN'T DO IT FOR YOU. A PASTOR CAN'T DO IT FOR YOU. ONLY BY SALVATION IN HIS NAME. AMEN. ONLY THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST CAN WASH AWAY SIN. WHAT CAN WASH AWAY MY SIN? NOTHING BUT THE BLOOD OF JESUS. WHAT CAN MAKE ME WHOLE AGAIN? NOTHING BUT THE blood of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; So, the bride doesn't stand with her original footage. Can you imagine how awful that would be? &gt;&gt; You young people, you realize how important it is that you come to Christ, that you give your heart to him, your life to him, really surrender to him. how important that is. &gt;&gt; That you actually come in his presence. &gt;&gt; Oh my. That your life is changed by him. &gt;&gt; Because no one would want their entire LIFE TO BE PLAYED OUT AT the day of judgment, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And every thought and the people maybe that we thought were real saints, &gt;&gt; but when the thoughts of the heart come out, &gt;&gt; are you with me now? JUST BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T PUBLIC SINNERS DON'T MEAN THEY weren't sinners. &gt;&gt; Just because a person's GOT LONG HAIR AND LONG DRESS DON'T MEAN THEY'RE NOT A SINNER. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; BUT WHAT MAKES THE DIFFERENCE? IT'S THE PERSON THAT'S BEEN CHANGED FROM THE INSIDE THAT'S BEEN WASHED BY THE BLOOD OF THE LAMB. &gt;&gt; We must have s we must have a new birth. WE WE'VE GOT TO HAVE AN EXPERIENCE WITH GOD WHERE HE edits the footage. Yes, &gt;&gt; sir. or every thought continue. Everything we think, every word we say, &gt;&gt; just is still on the tape. &gt;&gt; But the Bible says, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that heareth my word," Brother Brandon said, "That's more than just hear with your ear. That's understand, right? He that understandeth my word," in other words, understand that I need to be born again. What must I do to be saved? He that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life, and shall not, someone say it with me, shall not come into condemnation, but is passed from death unto life. Hallelujah. We will not come into judgment. See, and you realize what he does for you. He lets you come to church, right? A and you're our sin because we still do things that are wrong. &gt;&gt; You understand? You live in a body that's not converted, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? THIS BODY STILL SINS, &gt;&gt; still has thoughts that aren't right and things and and yet the inner man is supposed to control that. But there's times we give in to the to the to the evil dog, if you will, the black dog. We give in to that. And when we give in to the wrong thing, what happens? It creates a it creates a tension there and and it creates sin in our lives. It creates a mistake that we make. And yet there is an atonement with the father. The Bible said if ANY MAN SIN, HE has an atonement. &gt;&gt; So hallelujah. WE GET TO COME TO CHURCH TO BE WASHED. &gt;&gt; LISTEN, he's already FORGIVEN YOU. &gt;&gt; THE ATONEMENT WAS MADE THE MOMENT THAT YOU SINNED OR YOU COULDN'T have even MADE IT. &gt;&gt; RIGHT? HE'S ALREADY SEALED YOU. THE ATONEMENT'S BEEN MADE. WHY DO WE COME TO CHURCH TO HAVE OUR CONSCIENCE WASHED? &gt;&gt; RIGHT? Because you're still living IN A BODY OF FLESH. YOU STILL NEED TO WASH YOUR HANDS AND YOUR FEET. BECAUSE YOU'RE OUT IN A WORLD THAT'S THAT'S FILTHY. YOU'RE IN A WORLD WHERE YOU PICK UP THINGS THAT ARE WRONG. SO, WE WASH OUR FEET. WE WASH OUR HANDS. WE SAY, "LORD, WASH MY CONSCIENCE OF THESE THINGS. LORD, I FORGIVE ME." AND WE COME HERE AND WE ARE JUDGED HERE. JUDGMENT BEGINS AT THE HOUSE OF GOD. WE ARE JUDGED HERE. SO WE DO NOT HAVE TO BE JUDGED OVER THERE. &gt;&gt; ARE YOU WITH ME NOW? AND SO WE REPENT OF OUR SINS. I'VE TOLD YOU BEFORE BEFORE I COME OUT AND PREACH, I REPENT EVERY TIME BECAUSE I KNOW THERE MIGHT BE THINGS THAT I DID OR THINGS THAT I SAID OR SOMETHING THAT I DID WRONG AND SAY, "LORD, FORGIVE ME. LET LET ME COME CLEAN BEFORE THE PEOPLE. LET ME COME WITH A CLEAR CONSCIENCE BEFORE THE PEOPLE." OH, I PRAY THAT EACH ONE OF US COULD DO THAT. EVERY TIME WE COME TO THE HOUSE OF GOD, WE OUGHT TO SAY, "LORD, WASH ME TODAY. WASH." I KNOW I STILL LIVE HAVE A STICKY NATURE. I STILL LIVE IN A BODY OF FLESH WASH ME TODAY. &gt;&gt; LET MY TESTIMONY IN MY LIFE MATCH THE TESTIMONY YOU HAVE IN HEAVEN. &gt;&gt; SAY, Brother Ben, how do you know that he cuts out the bad parts? I want you to think about this. How do you know? Well, he did it for Abraham. Amen. &gt;&gt; You remember Abraham made an egregious mistake. He he made one with Ishma, but he made an egregious mistake by leaving the land, &gt;&gt; going down into Egypt, &gt;&gt; and and lying to the king, &gt;&gt; right? and then and then tell him it's his sister and she almost gets married to the king if it wasn't for the Lord &gt;&gt; because Abraham didn't have the guts to tell him the truth, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And and you find out that's the most amazing thing. But Isaac is he did it twice. It was such a and it was so bad the first time, you know, you'd think he wouldn't have done it again, but he did it again. And so he comes back again and does it. And you think, well, that means that Abraham failed, and he did, right? But but when Paul is telling the story of Abraham, &gt;&gt; you'll find it in Romans chapter 4. I don't have time to read all of it, &gt;&gt; but in verse 20, he says, "He staggered not." &gt;&gt; It sure looks to us like he's staggering. &gt;&gt; Right? In fact, he might have be completely on his face &gt;&gt; down there in Egypt, down there in Gar. Right. He he's HE'S HE'S STAGGERING. BUT PAUL SAYS HE STAGGERED NOT &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD IS SHOWING THROUGH HIS PROPHET WHAT HE SEES. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; THE FOOTAGE THAT remains &gt;&gt; the rest OF ABRAHAM'S LIFE HAS BEEN CUT OUT. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And thrown in the garbage, &gt;&gt; disintegrated. Are you with me now? Yes, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; SO, HE DOESN'T MENTION HIS TRIPS DOWN THERE. HE DOESN'T MENTION THE BIRTH OF ISHMAEL. HE DOESN'T MENTION ANY OF THAT. WHAT DOES HE SAY? HE STAGGERED NOT AT THE PROMISE OF GOD THROUGH UNBELIEF, BUT WAS STRONG IN FAITH, GIVING GLORY TO GOD. AND BEING FULLY PERSUADED WHAT HE HAD PROMISED, HE WAS ABLE ALSO TO PERFORM. THEREFORE, it was imputed to him &gt;&gt; for righteousness. &gt;&gt; Now, it was accounted to him for righteousness. So, the trips to Egypt and Ger were edited out. Birth of Ishmael edited out they happened but not in the sight of God. &gt;&gt; In other words, he would not be judged for those things. &gt;&gt; Oh my. When Abraham comes to that before God, right? Because we all must appear before God. Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; Just like us, we have to appear before God. When he comes before God, his failures won't be mentioned. Why? because of his faith. It was imputed to him for righteousness. We do not have to fear death. WE DON'T HAVE TO FEAR GOING BEFORE God because our our failure, our our sin, that's why he was judged on the cross. IT'S WHY THEY PUT A CROWN OF THORNS ON HIS HEAD. IT'S WHY THEY THEY PUT 39 STRIPES ON HIS BACK. It's why he HUNG THERE. SUFFERED LIKE no other man had suffered. Not only WITH THE PHYSICAL PAIN BUT WITH THE PAIN OF SEPARATION FROM GOD UNTIL HE CRIED OUT, "MY GOD, MY GOD, WHY HAST THOU FORSAKEN ME?" LISTEN, YOU CAN'T BE JUDGED FOR WHAT WAS JUDGED IN HIS BODY. &gt;&gt; HE DIED FOR THE RIGHT &gt;&gt; TO EDIT THE footage &gt;&gt; now, &gt;&gt; WHY DON'T YOU LET HIM DO IT TODAY? &gt;&gt; OH, GOD. HE SUFFERED FOR THE right &gt;&gt; to be the director of your life. See, when we GIVE HIM LORDSHIP, WE'RE NOT JUST SAYING, "WELL, LORD, now I'm going to let you tell me what to do." That is that's what it is. But he's all we're also telling him, "I'm under your protection. &gt;&gt; I'M COMING UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF THIS SHED BLOOD WHEN I I'M SURRENDERING MYSELF TO YOU. AND BY DOING THAT, I'M I'M AVAILING MYSELF OF ALL YOUR PROTECTION. IT'S NO LONGER UP TO ME WHETHER I GO TO HEAVEN OR NOT, BUT IT'S UP TO YOU. IT'S NO LONGER MY RIGHTEOUSNESS. IT'S YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS." RIGHT. &gt;&gt; And even Abraham, the only reason THAT COULD HAPPEN IS BECAUSE GOD IN HIS MIND, THE LAMB WAS SLAIN BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF the world. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Abraham not even knowing what he had hardly what he had faith in, but yet he had faith and believed in that God who would justify his life. Listen, we we know that the bride does not come into white throne judgment. How many know that &gt;&gt; you're not going to stand before God and be judged? &gt;&gt; But the movie still plays, but there's nothing there to judge. Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We should just stop and worship him. &gt;&gt; And I know there's people who like to dig in the trash. &gt;&gt; It's always astounded me, by the way. I've always been astounded by people who like to dig in the trash. You know, they go, maybe some of y'all like to do this, I don't know, but dumpster divers, you know, they go out and and they dig through other trash and they find something and it's good and and and you know, they take it back and use it. I when I was in Africa and West Africa, it's very poor and the trash just thrown on the side of the road, but eventually there's nothing usable at all. It kind of takes care of itself because other people come in and just kind of like vultures. They come around the trash and take anything that's even remotely usable. So the trash just doesn't pile up. In fact, when it gets smaller, then they push it into the middle of the road and fill the potholes with it. But I don't understand digging through trash cuz it's smelly. You could buy the same thing for $1.99 up at the Dollar Tree. Somebody else's trash. How much worse is it for a Christian to dig through other people's trash to TRY TO FIND ACCUSATION AGAINST SOMEBODY OF SOMETHING THAT THEY DID AT SOME POINT IN SOME DISTANT MEMORY? LISTEN TO ME. YOU DON'T KNOW THAT THEY HAVEN'T repented of that. AND IF THEY HAVE REPENTED OF THAT, YOU'RE DIGGING UP SOMETHING THAT GOD DON'T EVEN RECOGNIZE. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I say leave it alone. I got enough trouble just keeping MYSELF CLEAN. I GOT ENOUGH TROUBLE MAKING SURE THAT I'VE BEEN JUDGED AND RIGHT BEFORE GOD. I GOT ENOUGH JUST TO MAKE SURE MY FOOTAGE IS EDITED AND I'M UNDER THE BLOOD. I DON'T WANT TO DIG UP ANYBODY ELSE'S TRASH. LISTEN TO ME. SO MANY TIMES I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT THIS. LISTEN, IF SOMEBODY HAD DONE SOMETHING AND FAILED GOD IN SOME WAY, I I LOVE ALL of you. I think so much of YOU AS A CHURCH, YOU KNOW, IT' KILL ME IF I FOUND OUT THAT SOME OF YOU HAD FAILED GOD IN SOME GREAT WAY. YOU KNOW, I REALLY DON'T WANT TO KNOW. I KNOW SOMETIMES YOU GOT TO CONFESS THINGS AND YOU GOT TO BRING IT OUT AND BUT IT ALWAYS HURTS ME. I DON'T I DON'T WANT TO KNOW. I WANT TO THINK OF YOU THE WAY GOD THINKS OF YOU. AND I'LL SAY THIS, IT DON'T SHAKE ME TOO MUCH WHEN I FIND OUT THAT HUMAN BEINGS MAKE MISTAKES. &gt;&gt; I know you think, WELL, IF WE TELL THE PASTOR, YOU KNOW, HE'LL HE'LL THINK BADLY OF US. NO, YOU YOU'RE A HUMAN BEING LIKE I'M A HUMAN BEING. WE BOTH MAKE MISTAKES. WE BOTH HAVE TROUBLE. WE BOTH HAVE TROUBLE GETTING UP IN THE MORNING. YOU WANT TO TELL YOU WANT ME TO TELL YOU HOW MUCH I STRUGGLE? I STRUGGLE SOMETIMES TO BEND OVER AND PUT MY SHOES ON. Some of y'all CAN FELLOWSHIP WITH ME ON THAT THOUGHT. NOW, come on. We're human beings. I STRUGGLE BECAUSE I'M OVERWEIGHT. I STRUGGLE SOMETIMES BECAUSE OF MY HEALTH. I STRUGGLE SOMETIMES BECAUSE OF THE AMOUNT OF STRESS I PUT MYSELF UNDER. The amount OF ANXIETY I PUT MYSELF UNDER. BUT I'M STILL THE CHOSEN OF GOD. I'M HIS ELECTED. I WAS CALLED BEFORE TIME BEGAN. I MIGHT STRUGGLE AS A HUMAN BEING, BUT I'M GOING TO A PLACE WHERE THERE IS NO STRUGGLE. COME ON, CHURCH. I'M GOING TO A PLACE WHERE THAT NOBODY DIGS THROUGH THE TRASH. I'M GOING TO A PLACE WHERE THERE'S NO MORE THERE'S NOTHING HELD AGAINST ME AT ALL. &gt;&gt; And I am sure, are you with me now? When my movie is played, everything is under the blood. That's why Paul can say, "I fought a good fight. I kept the faith." Amen. Now, so we're not judged. But the Bible is very clear. We will stand before God. We will give an account. Romans 14:10, "Why do thou judge thy brother? Why do thou s not thy brother? For we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ." 2 Corinthians 5:10. We must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ that everyone may receive the things done in his body. Notice carefully the wording of this. According to that he hath done whether it be good or bad. &gt;&gt; Now if you are a Christian today he has taken away the bad. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; What does he do with the good? Think about it for a minute. He doesn't just like you never lived, but he actually counts the good towards you. Now, think about it. The woman at the well, the the woman at the well had had five husbands. The one she was living with was not hers. And she'd done all that sin. when she comes before God, none of the sin will be remembered. &gt;&gt; But her running into the city, &gt;&gt; right, to tell the men. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; There's some things that's going to be remembered &gt;&gt; when when the final movie is cut. It's put in the can. It's a wrap. It's over. There's some things going to be remembered. Brother JT, &gt;&gt; your faithfulness will be remembered. Amen. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT JUST DONE AWAY WITH. &gt;&gt; YOUR FAITHFULNESS TO GOD WILL BE REMEMBERED. &gt;&gt; What What is Paul saying? Whether it be good or bad, we know the bad is edited out by the grace of God. What happens to the good? The good goes on our account. &gt;&gt; It's just the truth, church. &gt;&gt; So the bad is under the blood. &gt;&gt; But Paul says, I KNOW THERE IS A WHAT? A crown waiting. &gt;&gt; A crown waiting. a reward waiting for me. There are five crowns spoken of in scripture. One, the first one is the crown of life in James 1:12. It's for one who gives their life. James 1:12, "Blessed is the man that endureth temptation, for when he's tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him." &gt;&gt; So, it's a man that endureth temptation. Once he's been tried, he'll have a crown of life. In the Smyrnian church age, the saints are encouraged to be faithful to death. REVELATION 2:10, "FEAR NONE of those things which thou shalt suffer. Behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison that you may be tried. You shall have tribulation 10 days," speaking of that dark age, thousand-year period of when it was so dark. He said, "Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life." &gt;&gt; Right? BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS, "BE THOU FAITHFUL UNTO DEATH." HE DOES NOT SAY, "BE faithful until death, but unto death, right? Unto death." Brother Brandham said, "You may have to seal your testimony with your blood." Now, we think that's impossible. We look at that today. Brother Allen is saying about it this morning. I pledge allegiance to the lamb. And we think about those long ago who did that, who stood there and gave their lives. &gt;&gt; And many TIMES WE LOOK AT THAT KIND OF FAITH. WE THINK, WELL, THAT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE IF I WAS HAD TO DO THAT. BUT DON'T YOU REALIZE, BROTHER B SAID, IT'S THE same faith you live by daily &gt;&gt; IS THE SAME FAITH THAT IT WOULD TAKE TO STAND BEFORE SOMEBODY WHO HAD THE RIGHT TO TAKE YOUR LIFE and said IF YOU DENY HIM I'LL LET YOU LIVE. You say, "HOW COULD I DO THAT?" BUT THE SAME FAITH YOU LIVE BY DAILY. IT'S THE SAME FAITH THAT ALLOWED them to do that. Just a different anointing, but the same faith. You understand? We've been we're anointed for what we have need of. And this age is an eagle anointing to be able to see and understand. Again, brother Brandon said, "I will give THEE A CROWN OF LIFE SINCE NOT EVEN A CUP OF COLD WATER given in the name of the Lord fails to receive a reward. HOW GREAT SHALL BE THE REWARD TO HIM WHO GIVES HIS LIFE AS A MARTYR FOR THE name of the Lord Jesus." Oh my. JESUS CALLS IT THE CROWN OF LIFE. ONE CROWN IS FOR THOSE WHO HAVE STRIVEN. The other is for those who have given. Both crowns are incorruptible. &gt;&gt; THEY WILL NOT PERISH. THE WINNERS OF THE WORLDLY RACE OF LIFE WILL SOON LOSE THE JOY OF THE PLOT OF THE WORLD. THEIR GLORY WILL FAIL. He's talking about the crown. PAUL TALKED ABOUT THE CROWN of righteousness. We'll get to that in a moment. AND THE CROWN OF LIFE, he said one is for those who have striven, one is those for those who have given. He said those WHO STRUGGLE IN THIS LIFE, who race in this life, their glory will fail. But those who give their LIVES FOR GOD, EITHER by daily striving, how how many strive EVERY DAY? HOW MANY TRY YOUR BEST TO BE A CHRISTIAN AND LIVE IN A WORLD FULL OF OF MISERY IN SATAN'S EDEN? IF YOU'RE DOING THAT, THERE'S A CROWN OF LIFE WAITING FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; OH, come on, church. &gt;&gt; A CROWN OF LIFE, AN INCORRUPTIBLE CROWN. He said they will not perish. BUT THOSE WHO GIVE THEIR LIVES FOR GOD, EITHER BY DAILY STRIVING OR SHEDDING their blood as the crowning sacrifice of their lives, will be given the crown of life. He said, "All too little time is spent on laboring for the eternal rewards of God." THE RECOMPENSE OF GOD IS TOO LIGHTLY ESTEEMED. MOST OF US ARE JUST HAPPY TO BE SAVED AND WE SHOULD BE. &gt;&gt; That's good. BUT PAUL SAID, "I HAVE A CROWN WAITING." &gt;&gt; Do you see why we still preach to saved people? &gt;&gt; YOU SEE WHY WE STILL WE STILL TRY TO STIR YOU UP IN the in the in the faith and KEEP YOU ON THE MARK AND AND PRESS TOWARD THE MARK OF THE HIGH CALLING? YOU SEE WHY WE STILL WE STILL PRESS. WE STILL DO. YOU SAY, "WELL, I'VE BEEN SAVED. I CAN JUST COAST ON THAT." BUT THERE'S A CROWN waiting for you. There's something waiting for you, a reward waiting in ANOTHER LAND. I KNOW FOR OUR ELDERS, THIS OUGHT TO BE AN ENCOURAGEMENT, BUT IT OUGHT TO BE AN ENCOURAGEMENT FOR EVERY ONE OF US BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW WHEN THE DIRECTOR WILL SAY, "THAT'S a wrap and it's over." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; THERE'S A CROWN WAITING FOR YOU. OH, I WANT TO RECEIVE MY CROWN. HALLELUJAH. I want to be able TO SAY LIKE PAUL, I FOUGHT A GOOD FIGHT. I kept the faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Ram said, "All too little time is spent on laboring for the eternal rewards of God, the recompense of God is too lightly esteemed. If we believe in the reality of the resurrection of the body and an eternal KINGDOM OF SUBSTANCE, THEN WE OUGHT TO LAY UP IN HEAVEN those good treasures that are available to faithful saints." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, Paul also speaks of an incorruptible crown. 1 Corinthians 9:24 he said ' know ye not that they which run in a race run all but one receiveth the price so run that you may obtain and every man that striveth for the mastery is tempered in all things they do it to obtain a corruptible crown but we incorruptible brother Brown picks THIS UP AND HE TELLS US THAT IF YOU WERE MADE PRESIDENT of the US right so if they made you president David White is the president now right he said that would be a crown. &gt;&gt; It'd be a reward. Be a great thing. But you'd have to give it up. If you don't give it up, they'd come make you give it up. And even if you were your whole life, if you were made king of England, RIGHT, THAT'S FOR LIFE, LIKE A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE, RIGHT? If you were made a king, YOU WOULD HAVE THAT FOR YOUR LIFE, BUT YOU'D HAVE TO GIVE IT UP. &gt;&gt; But listen, he gave us an incorruptible crown. So he said if you receive the crown, oh my, that he gives you, it's an incorruptible crown. What is that crown? He said Jesus gives us a CROWN OF LIFE THAT WE NEVER give up. An incorruptible CROWN OF HIS GLORY. WE DON'T HAVE TO give it up. He gives it to us. It's a blessing. IT'S THE HOLY SPIRIT THAT HE WANTS TO CROWN OUR LIFE WITH. DON'T YOU SAY, "WELL, I'M A CHRISTIAN, BUT HE WANTS TO CROWN YOUR LIFE WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT. &gt;&gt; GIVE YOU SOMETHING THAT'LL NEVER BE TAKEN AWAY FROM YOU." LISTEN, THEY CAN TAKE YOUR MONEY. THEY CAN TAKE YOUR STUFF. THEY CAN TAKE YOUR 401K. THEY CAN TAKE EVERYTHING. BROTHER JT, YOU MIGHT BE IN A IN A PLACE YOU NEVER THOUGHT YOU'D BE IN, IN A BODY CONDITION YOU NEVER THOUGHT YOU'D BE IN, BUT THEY CAN'T TAKE THE HOLY GHOST OUT OF YOUR HEART. &gt;&gt; NO MATTER HOW CORRUPT THE GOVERNMENT IS. COME ON, CHURCH. NO MATTER HOW MUCH THEY MUCH THEY MESS WITH YOUR FINANCES, NO MATTER HOW MUCH OH, COME ON. NO MATTER HOW MUCH THEY TAX YOU, NO MATTER HOW MUCH PEOPLE TALK ABOUT YOU, NO MATTER HOW MANY PEOPLE TRY TO PUT YOU OUT, IF YOU HAVE THE HOLY GHOST, IT'S AN INCORRUPTIBLE CROWN. IT CAN NEVER be taken away from you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Isaiah 28:5, this where brother Brandham takes this, that the Holy Ghost is a crown. He says, "In that day shall the Lord of hosts be for a crown of glory." Oh yes. "AND FOR A DIADEM OF BEAUTY unto the residue of his people, AND FOR A SPIRIT OF JUDGMENT TO HIM THAT SITETH IN JUDGMENT, FOR STRENGTH TO THEM THAT TURN THE BATTLE TO THE GATE." OH, I NEED STRENGTH. YOU NEED STRENGTH TO BE ABLE TO GO TO THE BATTLE. WHAT IS IT? HE GIVES YOU A CROWN. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; Gives you strength. incorruptible crown. It gives you just an earnest here. But what will it be, brother Brand? So, when the shadow, the shadow of the shadows becomes a reality. &gt;&gt; There's a crown of righteousness that we already read about. Paul says, "I fought a good fight. I finished my course. I've kept the faith. Inforth, there's laid up for me a crown of righteousness." But he didn't limit it to himself. He said, "Not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing." I love this. Brother said, "When you're sick and tired of this old life, I don't mean a death wish, but how many would just be happy if the rapture happened?" &gt;&gt; Come on. We We're getting tired of this whole life. &gt;&gt; Paul said, "For me to live as Christ and die is gain. to go on a rapture would be so much better because we all get to go together, right? And my loved ones wouldn't wouldn't have to sorrow over me because they'd go with me. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I want to take them all with me. But the Brandon said, "When you're sick and tired of this old life, and you'll love the appearing of the Lord Jesus better than you love your food." That spoke to me. You love the appearing. Brother Herald, you like good food. Brother Herald, I'm around Brother Herald enough. I know. He comes over the house, he likes good food. He knows good food. As long as it's got plenty of tobasco sauce on it, it's good food. But he said, "You'll love the appearing more than you love your food better than you love your food at the table or your wife." Well, think about it, church. You love your wife. You should love your wife. You should love her more than anything else in the world. But yet, there's something beyond that. He said you love his appearing more than your wife or your children. And there's a crown laid up for you. Hallelujah. There's a crown laid up for you. The same crown Paul's talking about. HE SAID THAT'S THE He said not a crown, a gold crown to put on your head. Come on. We think so carnal sometimes. It's not a GOLD CROWN THAT HE PUTS on our head. HE SAID BUT A BODY. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. This is a good crown. So he give you the Holy Ghost, an incorruptible crown. AND HE GIVES YOU A body that's incorruptible, A BODY FREE FROM PAIN, CROWNED IN THE GLORY OF GOD, CROWNED IN THE IMMORTALITY OF JESUS CHRIST. THAT'S WHAT'S LAID UP FOR YOU. SEE, PAUL KNEW I GOT A BODY WAITING FOR ME. &gt;&gt; He said, that's what's laid up for you. That the Lord, THE RIGHTEOUS JUDGE, WILL give you that at the that day. That's the day we look forward to. God has made a WAY OF ESCAPE FOR every one of us. LISTEN TO ME. YOU MIGHT BE TIRED. YOU MIGHT BE WEARY. YOU MIGHT BE GETTING OLD. IT MIGHT SEEM LIKE EVERY DAY IS A STRUGGLE, BUT THERE'S A CROWN WAITING FOR YOU. DON'T GIVE UP NOW. DON'T STOP NOW. YOU KEEP FIGHTING. YOU KEEP WORKING. YOU KEEP DOING WHAT YOU'RE DOING. KEEP ON SERVING THE LORD. THERE'S A CROWN WAITING FOR THOSE THAT LOVE his appearing. Hallelujah. Amen. What if what's going on right now? I know you don't always understand everything we DO, BUT BROTHER RANDOM TALKED ABOUT THAT WHEN THAT POPE from America COME IN. HE SAID, "THEN I'LL PULL THE BRIDE TOGETHER, &gt;&gt; BEN. Why do you want unity among the people? BECAUSE I SEE THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S GOT TO HAPPEN BEFORE THE COMING OF THE LORD." OH, CHURCH, LET LET'S DO OUR PART. LET'S DO OUR PART HERE IN THIS AREA, NOT TO GOSSIP AND CUT DOWN AND HURT, BUT LET'S DO OUR PART TO BUILD UP AND TO HELP AND AND TO DO WHAT WE CAN FOR OTHERS. WHY? BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT'S GOT TO HAPPEN. WE LOVE HIS APPEARING. WE'RE NOT EVEN DOING IT SO MUCH FOR THE PEOPLE AS WE ARE FOR HIM. We love his appearing. So if you love his appearing, wouldn't you want the bride to be in unity? It got quiet. If you love his appearing, wouldn't you want to look forward to that day when we'll be in complete unity, which will be on the other side. We come in unity of of spirit here. We come in unity of everything else over there where we can be completely the same in the sense that God has made us individuals but we become where we understand as we are understood. Oh my. No misunderstandings there. The fourth crown is the crown of rejoicing. 1 Thessalonians 2:19 he said, "For what is our hope or joy or crown of rejoicing? Are not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming? So Paul says, I'm gonna see some of you. Come on, let just let your mind wander for a little bit. The casserole will be all right. We'll we'll we'll get to it. Mom's not here today, so she won't get antsy with me. I hope she didn't slip in while I was saying that. She's probably watching. But look, we got a few minutes. Let's let's think about it for a minute. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Think about this crown of rejoicing. What is it? It's when we get to the other side and we see those who we've been associated with who we helped along the way. Remember the good things aren't edited out. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said if you he said if you give to missions, if you support missions, if you support a church, he said and a SOUL IS SAVED, YOUR NAME IS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT SOUL FOR ETERNITY. That's just a simple thing. BUT IF YOU GO OUT AND WITNESS TO SOMEBODY, oh my. And they're saved. CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT A GREAT THING THAT WOULD BE TO STAND THERE? AND PAUL SAID, PAUL TRAVELED THE WORLD FOR THE LORD. AND HE GETS TO THIS POINT WHERE HE SAYS, "ARE YOU NOT MY CROWN OF REJOICING?" HE SAID, "WHEN I STAND BEFORE HIM, I'LL SEE YOU THERE AND THAT'LL BE THE CROWN AND I'LL START TO REJOICE." Because he WOULD LITERALLY BE CROWNED WITH THE PEOPLE THAT HE PREACHED TO. OH, THAT WE WOULD LIVE A LIFE SO THAT WE COULD HAVE THIS CROWN. &gt;&gt; Some of you mothers, YOU SAY, "WELL, I COULD NEVER PREACH THE GOSPEL." BUT YOU CAN YOU CAN HAVE A CROWN OF REJOICING WHEN YOUR CHILDREN MAKE IT TO THE OTHER SIDE. WHEN THOSE YOU HAD AN IMPACT ON AND FELLOWSHIP WITH AND LOVED WITH ALL YOUR HEART, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; There will be a crown of rejoicing for you when you see them there. Hallelujah. Therefore, my brethren, dearly beloved, and longed for my joy and crown. So stand fast in the Lord, my dearly beloved. The people wore the crown. Brother said this. He said, "Forgive me if I try to take the place of a boss. I'm no boss, but I feel TO YOU LIKE PAUL said back there by his congregation once, you're the stars in my crown." How many believe that? SAID, "WHEN I CROSS OVER THE LAND OVER ON THE OTHER SIDE, YONDER AND MEET YOU IN THAT GLORIFIED CONDITION. I WANT YOU TO STAND THERE TO SHINE LIKE THE STARS IN MY CROWN. I WANT YOU TO BE THERE. I WANT TO BE THERE." &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I told you a story one time. It it kind of affected me. BROTHER BRANDON TELLS AN ADOPTION ABOUT A GIRL that one time that he was associated with. He said she was a Christian. He said, "But I wasn't." And that girl had an influence on his life before brother Brandham was a Christian. A lady that was a Christian, he actually went out with her. They were boyfriend and girlfriend. And he BUT SHE HE SAID SHE ALWAYS HELD HERSELF pure and and true. And he said he went to her grave when she died young. He went to her grave and said she was a real Christian. &gt;&gt; He said, "I'll see you over yonder." In fact, he said there'd be one OF THOSE WHO WERE standing there on that day. remember that said we're resting on that would be THAT GIRL BUT IT WASN'T SO MUCH HE IMPACTED HER LIFE BUT SHE IMPACTED his didn't probably EVEN KNOW IT MAY HAVE NEVER KNOWN WHO HE WAS OR WHAT HE DID &gt;&gt; BUT SHE MADE A DIFFERENCE YOU REALIZE YOUNG PEOPLE LISTEN TO ME YOU YOUNG PEOPLE THAT ARE DATING OR COURTING YOU'RE GOING out some OF YOU REALIZE THAT YOU CAN HAVE A CROWN IN YOUR LIFE BY THE WAY YOU CONDUCT yourself &gt;&gt; the way you TREAT YOUR BOYFRIEND OR YOUR GIRLFRIEND THE WAY YOU TREAT ONE ANOTHER THE WAY WE TREAT ONE ANOTHER HERE AT THE CHURCH. WE COULD HAVE A CROWN BECAUSE IT COULD BE AN INFLUENCE. YOU ELDERS, YOU CAN BE AN INFLUENCE ON THESE CHILDREN. NOT JUST TO BE CRITICAL OF THEM, BUT TO BE AN INFLUENCE ON THEIR LIVES. &gt;&gt; Somebody I just say this, my old pastor always told me, he said, "If you see a turtle on a fence post, somebody put him there." &gt;&gt; Right? Brother Brandham didn't get here BY ACCIDENT. THERE WAS SOMEBODY INFLUENCED his life. &gt;&gt; The angel of the LORD WAS WITH HIM. GOD PROTECTED HIM. BUT SOMEBODY HAD TO PREACH THE FIRST SERMON HE ever heard. SOMEBODY HAD TO BE EVEN DR. DAVIS WAS HIS PASTOR. DR. DAVIS NEVER DID BELIEVE the message OR UNDERSTAND IT. ALTHOUGH HE FINALLY BECOME A PENTECOSTAL, BUT HE NEVER DID FULLY EMBRACE THE MESSAGE. BUT I'LL SAY THIS, THERE'LL BE A CROWN. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; Because of who he led to THE LORD AND WHO HE HELPED ALONG THE WAY. I THINK DR. BOSWORTH WOULD BE brother Bosworth would BE THE SAME WAY. BROTHER BOSWORTH WAS A STRENGTH. HE NEVER UNDERSTOOD the message the WAY WE DO. AND HE WAS A STRENGTH TO BROTHER BRANDHAM. I BELIEVE THERE'LL BE A CROWN. ALL THE MINISTRY THAT BROTHER BRANDHAM HAD AND THE MILLIONS AROUND THE WORLD THAT ARE TODAY SAYING WE'RE RESTING ON THAT. &gt;&gt; It'll be a crown, &gt;&gt; a star, brother Bosworth's crown. He said, remember, he said, I remember in my vision when I seen the presence of the Lord where his people in THAT GLORIOUS LAND YONDER, I LOOKED AROUND. I TOLD THEM AND THEY TOLD ME HE WOULD JUDGE ME FIRST FOR THE GOSPEL THAT I PREACH. I SAID EXACTLY the way Paul preached it. And then millions of people screamed out, "We're resting on that." Brother Brandham preaches in future home. I'm just preaching to you this morning. I feel the presence of the Lord here today. I believe you're listening. When brother Brandon preached future home, HE HE PREACHES THIS LONG SERMON AND HE GETS KIND OF TOWARDS THE END OF IT. HE SAID, "AS I SEE THE WORD VINDICATING ITSELF, HE SAID, I KNOW BEYOND ONE SHADOW OF A DOUBT, THE JEWELS OF MY CROWN WILL OUTSHINE EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD AT THAT DAY." That's us. &gt;&gt; WE'VE BEEN IMPACTED. I KNOW PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO ADMIT IT, BUT WE'VE BEEN IMPACTED BY THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR, BUT I SAY LET IT'S NOT ENOUGH FOR ME TO BE IMPACTED BY HIS LIFE. LET MY LIFE BE AN IMPACT TO SOMEBODY. &gt;&gt; I WANT TO HAVE A CROWN OF REJOICING WHEN I GET THERE. &gt;&gt; Cuz I led someone to the Lord. How about you today? &gt;&gt; A crown of glory. In 1 Peter 5:2, Peter says, "Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly, not for filthy lucer, not for money, but of a ready mind, a willingness to do what needs to be done. Neither is being lords over God's heritage, but being examples to the flock." Goes with what we said last week. A minister has to be an example. He said, "And when the chief shepherd shall appear, you shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away." But we know this is not limited just to preachers. I believe there's a crown of glory for those who are faithful to the flock, but here it's not limited just to preachers. He said, "Remember Esther was chosen and the others was rejected." Esther come by and read my notes the other day and she said, "I like that." SHE SAID ESTHER WAS CHOSEN AND THE OTHERS WAS REJECTED AND ONLY THOSE THAT'S BORN AGAIN THAT'S GOT THE SPIRIT OF GOD WILL BE THE CHOSEN THAT DAY THAT THE CROWN OF GLORY &gt;&gt; will be set upon her head. Oh, this isn't just a preacher message. This is a bride message. &gt;&gt; He said and the others will be rejected. What are we going to do with our crowns? What what what do we attribute it to? The Bible said Revelation 4:10 that the four and 20 elders, brother Brandham said that was the elite of heaven. It's the 12 apostles and the 12 patriarchs. The elite OF HEAVEN FALL DOWN BEFORE HIM THAT SAT ON THE THRONE AND WORSHIP HIM THAT LIVETH FOREVER AND EVER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. and cast their crowns before the throne, saying, "Thou art worthy, oh Lord, TO RECEIVE GLORY AND HONOR AND POWER. FOR THOU HAS CREATED ALL THINGS, AND FOR THY PLEASURE THEY ARE CREATE AND were created." What did they do? They said, "EVERYTHING THAT I HAVE, I GIVE TO YOU. EVERY BIT OF GLORY I'VE EARNED, LET ME GIVE IT BACK TO YOU." I BELIEVE THAT'S THE WAY WE OUGHT TO BE THIS MORNING. IF YOU'VE LIVED A LIFE BEFORE GOD, THAT CAN ONLY BE THANKS TO HIS GRACE. YES. &gt;&gt; THOU ART WORTHY, OH LORD. AND THEY CAST their crowns at his feet. Now, we're coming to the close of another year. Wednesday night will be the last night of the year. So, you could come to to this. I I apologize for being disjointed today. I hope that you get what I'm talking about. I'm not speaking very well, but the the filming is almost over. Can you see that? Like if there's a reel that says 2025, Wednesday night it cut. It's put in the can. &gt;&gt; It's a wrap. See, I wonder what the movie looks like. We're we're about to see a great drama unfold. Did you know that? &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham tells us there's one great event that's ever t greatest event that's ever taken place is at hand right now. We're standing on the brim, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Watching a drama &gt;&gt; being set. &gt;&gt; He calls it God's great drama. We're standing on the brim watching a drama being set. He said, "I'VE MANY TIMES WATCHED MOVIES HOW IN HOLLYWOOD AND IN DIFFERENT PLACES SETTING THEIR DRAMAS." SO, he's watching them make a movie, right? He said SETTING THEIR PROMISE AND HOW THEY TAKE THEIR STARS AND THEIR SO FORTH AND FIX THEM AROUND. I didn't just come up with this out of thin air. HE SAID THEY TAKE THEIR STARS AND FIX THEM AROUND. HOW THEY TRAIN THEM AND EVERYTHING BEFORE THE GREAT DRAMA TAKES PLACE. HE SAID I'M ALWAYS AMAZED at watching it and knew it had to be a counterfeit. So he said, in other words, if they're doing this, there must be something like this that takes place in the spiritual world. He said, "ALL COUNTERFEIT THINGS ARE MADE OFF OF REAL ONES. THERE CAN'T BE A BOGUS TOLERANT UNTIL THERE'S A REAL ONE. There can't be a hypocrite unless there's a real Christian. THERE CAN'T BE A FALSE MESSAGE UNLESS THERE'S A TRUE ONE. THERE CAN'T BE A NIGHT UNLESS THERE'S A DAY." HE SAID, "AS I WATCHED THEM SET THEIR DRAMAS, I THOUGHT, OH, WE ARE STANDING WAY YONDER ON THE TOWER FAR ABOVE ANYTHING IN THIS WORLD. AND WE'RE WATCHING TWO OF THE GREATEST THINGS. &gt;&gt; Will you stand with me AS WE GET READY TO CLOSE TODAY AND WATCH THIS GREAT DRAMA THAT'S ABOUT TO UNFOLD? &gt;&gt; 2025 IS COMING TO AN END. LET'S WATCH THIS GREAT THING TAKING PLACE. THERE WILL BE TIME NO MORE. MUSICIANS, GO AHEAD AND COME AND THE COMING OF THE LORD AND THE ANTICHRIST. HE HAS HIS SUBJECT SITTING THERE. LET'S LOOK DOWN NOW. HE HAS THE COMMUNISM. HE HAS DIFFERENT ISISMS. HE HAS CHURCHISM. HE HAS CATHOLICISM. HE HAS PROTESTANTISM. HE HAS EVERYTHING SET TO MAKE A GREAT SHOW. BUT I'M SO GLAD THERE'S A FATHER IN HEAVEN WHO HAS HIS CHARACTER SET, TOO. SO, IT'S NOT JUST THAT THERE'S A DRAMA GOING TO TAKE PLACE ON THE EARTH AND THE ANTICHRIST IS GOING TO DO WHAT HE DOES, BUT THE FATHER HAS A GREAT DRAMA THAT WE'RE WATCHING IT TAKE PLACE AS WELL. HE SAID WHEN THE ANTICHRIST TAKES him into the decease of everything, EVEN TO TIME, GOD IS READY IN HIS DRAMA TO LIFT HIS CHURCH INTO ETERNITY into the blissful REALM OF THE ETERNAL WITH GOD HIMSELF. He said, "WHEN THESE OLD VILE BODIES WILL BE CHANGED AND MADE LIKE HIS OWN GLORIOUS BODY, THIS CORRUPTION SHALL TAKE ON IMMORTALITY IN HIS LIKENESS WE WILL STAND FOREVER." OH, can you see it, church? Can you LOOK OVER THE BRIM AND SEE IT? LIKE KENNY SAID, "THERE'S A GREAT DRAMA BEING SET. ANGELS ARE STANDING OVER THE SKIES WATCHING." YOU KNOW WHAT A DRAMA IS? THE ACTORS ARE READY. YOU CAN SEE THEM ACTING. You can see the evil ONE ACTING. YOU CAN SEE THE VILLAIN OF THE PLAY, RIGHT? You can see the devil at work. How many has seen it? YOU CAN SEE THE GOD OF THIS EVIL AGE. HOW HE COMES ON THE SCENE WITH HIS CUNNINGNESS TO DECEIVE. But you can also SEE THE RAPTURED CHURCH MAKING HERSELF READY. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. It's a great scene. YOU CAN SEE THE PRESENCE OF GOD VINDICATING AND MAKING THE GREAT DRAMA AS FORETOLD HERE IN THIS BIBLE TO ACT ITSELF OUT. WHAT A TIME TO LIVE. THE MOST GLORIOUS TIME. THE MAN OF ALL AGES HAS LONGED FOR THIS TIME. The prophets of old long to see this hour. It wasn't privilege. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. What do you say? I'm watching this take place and what what can I do? I see the evil one working. I see God working. Well, just be a part of what God is doing. Lord, what's my part? Maybe you're older today and you in this great drama, you play a certain part. You say, "Well, I can't play the part I used to." But don't quit the play. You're still in God's great art drama. You're still an actor in the drama. You still have a part, right? HE'S GOT IT SET UP FOR YOU TO PLAY. YOU YOUNG PEOPLE, THERE'S A PART FOR you to play. And your part is more important than it's ever been CUZ WE DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH LONGER we'll be here. GIVE YOUR HEART TO THE LORD TODAY. DON'T WAIT TILL TOMORROW. LET HIM EDIT THE TAPE TODAY. LET HIM GET RID of anything that's unlike him. LET HIM TAKE IT AWAY FROM YOU TODAY. LET HIM CUT OFF ALL THE SURPLUS. Give yourself completely to him. You can see the evil one acting. YOU CAN SEE THOSE THINGS HAPPENING. BUT WE ALSO SEE A BRIDE GETTING DRESSED, getting ready for the coming of that day. Hallelujah. What do you have to do? Stand for him. Die to yourself and be faithful to death. The curtain drops when the director says that's a wrap. You be ready at that time. If you'd bow your heads with me for just a moment. Will they play softly? Bow your heads with me for just a moment. I want us to think about it. 2025. We're coming to the end now. What needs to be edited from the tape? what needs to be washed from our conscience. Why don't you just ask him, Lord, would you forgive me? Help me to go into a new year and in a better way, not to turn over a new leaf, but Lord, I want to be washed by the water of the word. Every time I come to the house, God, take out that old temper. Lord, take it out of me. Take out that old bitterness that's in my heart, that ungodliness, that worldness. Take it out, Lord. I don't want to be that way. Would you just ask him this morning, men and women, boys and girls, deacons, trustees, preachers, no matter who you are, just ask him today, Lord, edit my tape. I want to be right. Lord, TAKE WASH ME. I KNOW YOU'VE WASHED MY SINS. THE ATONEMENT IS SUFFICIENT IN MY LIFE, BUT LET it be washed even FROM MY OWN CONSCIENCE. LET THE CONDEMNATION cease in my life and the VOICE OF THE ACCUSER. HE'LL ALWAYS ACCUSE, BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO LISTEN to him. Let it be washed from you today by the water of the word. Well, I pray he'd grant it today. Heavenly Father, Lord, we all stand in this place, Lord, you spoke of a man by the name of Daniel Curry, an evangelist. The Lord the prophet spoke of him and he said that when he went he had a dream that he went before your throne when he did they didn't find his name in the book and he went looking and said what do I do he said well you can appeal to the great white throne and when he went to APPEAL TO THE GREAT WHITE THRONE judgment said they asked him have you ever told a lie he said he thought he'd been pretty truthful but Lord there in your presence he said I realized I had told many things that weren't true. He said, "I" He said, "Daniel Curry, have you ever have Have you ever stolen anything?" And he said, "I thought I'd been pretty good and hadn't taken something that wasn't mine, but that day I stood before that light and that great dove." And he said, "Well, I guess I've stolen God's time, Lord." And he said in the dream he was just about to hear those words, "Depart from me, you that work iniquity." He said the sweetest voice that he ever heard, spoke and said, "Father, on earth he stood for me." Today I'm standing for him. Lord, you promised in your WORD THAT IF WE WOULD STAND FOR YOU that you would stand for us. So we're STANDING FOR YOU TODAY WITH our arms raised to you. Lord, OUR HANDS LIFTED. LORD, WE BELIEVE TODAY that we our tape HAS BEEN EDITED, THAT OUR ATONEMENT IS SECURE, LORD, THAT WE HAVE AN INCORRUPTIBLE CROWN. We're so thankful for it, Lord. Lord, we stand for you today because we want you to stand for us on that day. Wash us of everything, Lord, that would be unlike you. Take away every every spot of sin, Lord. Wash us and we'll be whiter than snow. EVEN OUR THOUGHTS, LORD. EVEN THE THOUGHTS OF OUR HEART, EVEN our intentions, OH GOD. LORD, OUR MOTIVES AND OBJECTIVES, WASH them today, Lord. Make us pure, able to serve you better, able to walk before you better in the coming year. I pray you'd grant it, Lord. We thank you for it in Jesus name. Take these cut up words, Lord. May they become real to the people. I pray in Jesus name. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. If you need prayer, the altar's open today. Let's just let's just worship him in our own way. in your hands. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; With Jesus, I can't take it. &gt;&gt; Oh, with him I know. &gt;&gt; Oh, aren't you glad he's standing for you today?
