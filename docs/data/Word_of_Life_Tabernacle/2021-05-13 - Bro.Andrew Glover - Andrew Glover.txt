temptation the truth will go to every tongue in [Music] nations [Music] the final voice [Music] foreign [Music] leave that tonight [Applause] [Music] [Applause] i trust that you come expecting god to do something for you if you're coming to these meetings there's only one way to come that's with your cup right side up and we're ready to be filled there's several that are on the road tonight won't be in until tonight so or tomorrow uh so we'll have quite a few that just weren't able to make it in tonight so be praying for them and some coming from different states and things but i'm glad that you made it tonight and we'll have some of the home folk here too one of these nights but it's good to have each and every one of you here tonight and i see some from brother eric reeks and different ones that come and and it's such a blessing to have you if you need anything while you're here you just get with me or one of the deacons we'll be glad to help you any way that we can we're going to church friday at seven o'clock so that's tomorrow night once again at seven o'clock uh we're gonna have food after each service so if you're here we got plenty of food so you come and and feel free to eat with us after the service uh we're gonna have a breakfast for ministers and some of our uh out of town guests but most especially for the ministers if you want to come on saturday at 10 o'clock we're gonna have a breakfast for you and just feed you nothing else there's no hidden agenda there we're just gonna feed some of the preachers and some of the other folks who just happened to be around around that time so so you might want to show up at 10 o'clock on saturday if you're here we'll feed you and then on saturday of course the harvey's dad passed away with a harvey savage and they're gonna have that funeral at two o'clock and so we're gonna change the service time saturday night to seven o'clock we did have it at six so it's going to be at seven if you show up at six o'clock you're gonna be early but there's nothing wrong with that i'm sure there'll be somebody here to let you in but we're going to do that and give someone want to come after the funeral for that and and celebrate the life of brother harvey what a wonderful man that we knew i was telling someone i never never met brother harvey never was around him but he didn't tell me he loved me that means something you know if someone tells you that they love you so we love all of you tonight you remember that if i never see you again at least we've said that and amen saturday at seven and so remember that time change sunday at 10 30 we'll have a potluck dinner after the service on sunday we expected brother josh martin to be here tonight and his wife is expecting a baby it wasn't due for a couple weeks so we thought we were good but she started having contractions last night and so he said i'd better stay at home and start first and so i i can't hardly blame him for that but we're looking forward to hearing brother josh but brother andrew's here brother andrew has all the services now so you'll be praying for him and don't be afraid to work him it'll be okay he'll be okay he can handle it he's young and so we'll just work him as hard as we can and it's good to have his wife here with us tonight god bless you sis and brother andrew and his wife are such a blessing to us especially young people to see what an example that they sent for you all in so we're thankful for that and if you sing or you have a special for us let me know let one of the deacons know let brother david know or brother alan know and uh one of the brothers will make sure that we get you in because we want you to hear from you if you have a special during the meetings god bless you those of you that are watching i trust you'll be blessed as well let's see only believe as we prepare for brother andrew to come do we believe that god could do something supernatural the last time brother andrew was here was a wednesday night when he was supposed to be turkey hunting and there was just a few of us here but god came down that wednesday night just broke the service open i've never felt the presence of the lord like i did on a wednesday night service with just a handful of us here but god bless i believe god can move tonight we believe that and whatever way that he wants to we'll be okay with that we'll be okay with that amen blessing that only belief you can believe you can receive from god [Music] tonight oh all things [Music] tonight [Music] lord i believe [Music] oh [Music] oh jesus [Music] jesus amen i believe the sick can be healed the dead could be raised amen life can come into hearts even all things are possible when jesus passes by our way amen we greet you in the name of the lord jesus christ which you're counted an honor and a privilege to be here with you all once again and good to see everyone out in the house of god this evening and just before we open the bible could we just bow our hearts together for a word of prayer and let's just ask the lord to come and speak to us tonight as we open these meetings let's just dedicate our hearts and lives to him i mean have a need you just say lord i'm desiring something special from you over these next few days just come and minister to my heart even now lord heavenly father lord as your believers have gathered here this evening lord we come here lord not out of form or ritual but oh god we come here because there is a deep calling to the deep and lord your word has told us that if the noise of thy water spouts you would answer and father as we come here tonight there's many needs in the hearts of your people lord many situations many circumstances lord maybe it would be a sickness lord or a financial need a lord material needs spiritual need whatever the need would be tonight there's one thing that we're sure of tonight lord and that is there is no need too great for you or there's no sickness that you cannot heal there's no demon power that cannot be defeated so tonight lord on the first night of these meetings lord we just report to duty father we surrender ourselves to you we surrender our minds to you our hearts to your lord all that we are we surrender over to you tonight and i'm asking that you would send your grace upon these meetings father for those who would be here tonight lord i pray that you would help me to get myself out of the way lord that something could be said there would be a help lord would be lord edifying to the needs of your children and i pray lord for those with me travel lord may you just keep your hand to protection upon them father lord just bring us together the appointed time lord and those that are traveling safely father and lord we just now commit this evening into your hands lord may you not only anoint me to minister lord but may you anoint me to get myself out of the way that i can be used by you father lord may you anoint your people here this evening to be able to get their selves out of the way that you could come in a special way and we'll be sure to give you all the praise all the honor and all the glory for it's in the wonderful name of our lord and savior jesus christ we pray and all the believers said amen and amen god bless you this evening if you have your bibles while you're standing with us we want to turn to the book of proverbs the fourth chapter and we also want to look in the book of john the seventh chapter but here in the book of proverbs 4 we'd like to read first we want to greet you all in the name of the lord jesus christ we sure counted an honor and a privilege to be here with you this evening we appreciate brother ben appreciate his friendship and his stand upon the message and the pulpit here to stand for the message of the hour and that we sure want to say god bless him and his family and the church here and the work that the lord is doing and we've just come to amen put our shoulder to the wheel amen and to do all that we can to see the kingdom of god further advanced amen and also brother josh should text me today and ask me to greet you all for him so sure want to do that i know he would love to be here but we sure sure appreciate him and we want to look here in the book of proverbs the fourth chapter and i don't know what's happening but i'm losing everything in my ear so if you can put it back in my ear i appreciate it proverbs 4 and verse 23 the bible says keep thy heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of life now i think that heart is a very serious a very serious organ in the body don't you then actually solomon would write here and say keep thy heart with all diligence or keep thyself watch over thy heart for out of it are the issues of life now if you look with me in the book of john the seventh chapter john 7 and verse 38 john 7 and verse 38 we want to look there a very very familiar scripture there in john the seventh chapter is actually when jesus is just finished here at the feast and he stood and cried if any man thirsted him coming to me and drink and in the 38th verse of john 7 he's going to say he that believeth on me as the scripture said out of his belly shall flow somebody say shall flow he that believeth on me as a scripture said out of his bellies shall flow rivers of living water we asked the lord this evening to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you may have your seats here for just a few moments this evening if the lord would help me from those scriptures if i would have a title tonight i want to speak to you for a few moments here on unclogging the channels unclogging the channels and i i think tonight that there is a present time or a season we're living in we know there's actually four seasons of the of the year we have a fall we have a winter we have a spring and then we have a summer and those seasons they rotate and so actually the time we're living in is actually a time or season that's actually known when people actually get inspired to begin to clean things they actually call it spring cleaning or going through the house and get rid of things and it's actually a time of purging when they're actually cleaning out things and making room for something else actually what's happening is there's some things that's accumulating amen and those things have got to be moved aside for more to come in actually what they're doing is they're making room for more and brother brown actually preaches a message actually preaches it several times amen on doors and he'll actually call it door to the heart or doors in a door and what he does is he clearly identifies that there are many doors in the heart he says there's a door a man of pride there's a door of the private life he said then there's a door of faith he said there's all kinds of doors and he said in the heart of the human being all those doors are there because god is wanting to gain entrance he's wanting to get access he's wanting to get in behind those doors amen to manifest himself so when when saw solomon would say in proverbs 4 he meant to keep thy heart with all diligence he's actually been saying that behind there is a place god is going to get god is not just wanting to get in the flesh or just to get in the spirit amen but god is actually desiring to get into the heart amen of mankind the prophet said let my listen my christian friend if there's any alt in your heart against anyone go to them now and be reconciled forget all the past he said and if you've been having an up and down life remember something amen has come into that heart something has moved into these thoughts he meant no matter what who your enemy is you love him love him no matter no matter what's happened amen you let it go after all you're in a field with weeds and we realize that but we must grow together he said we've got to come up together he said for a good whale amen cannot pour forth evil waters neither can an evil whale amen pour forth good water see a tree cannot bring forth corrupt fruit and good fruit at the same time he said so let's either make the whole well clean or make the whole well dirty amen one or the other for it is dirty to begin with amen so let's clean out the whales this morning and say lord pour in your spirit and lead me o god amen lead me now think about this the prophet is saying there's not room amen in the well for dirty water and clean water there's not room in the well ain't meant for there to be stagnated water and fresh water there's not room in a tree ain't meant for there to be good fruit and corrupt fruit and let me amen let me just cut to the chase and say amen there's not room in the house of god amen for doubt and faith there's not room in the house of god for alts in our heart and in unbelief and unforgiveness amen i believe that time has come that god is desiring amen to pour out his spirit amen can you agree with me amen we're living in the time where god is desiring to pour out his spirit he meant not just to make the church jump or shout amen but where he could come back in the church he meant and there would not be room for anything else but christ he meant in christ alone my to think tonight that jehoshaphat had seen the results he meant of a life that served god in a life that did not serve god jehoshaphat witnessed that he meant in his own father think about that jehoshaphat saul amen what it was like one day for his father to serve god amen and then he saw what it was like the next day for his father not to serve god and it actually instilled something in him he meant to make room for one thing and that is serving god and may may i say that's a purpose in these meetings this weekend amen it's not to make room for a preacher not to make room for a church or to make room for a pastor amen but the purpose of these meetings amen is to make room for the living god he meant to come down in the church he met and defined the dwelling place mine the prophet said altogether he said jehoshaphat purpose where in his heart amen to serve the lord amen amen and declined to the things amen that his father david at the beginning i like that he meant at the beginning now think about this jehoshaphat amen was longing for the things amen that was at the beginning he was not longing he'd been for the half-hearted things he meant he was longing for the original things and i i think there's a longing in the heart of the church of the living god tonight amen we're not longing for half-hearted religion we're not longing for halfway services amen but there is a cry in our heart that is saying god you're still god and your word is still true and your power is still here and what you did before and then you're able to do it again let me just go and claim it for these meetings jesus christ it's the same yesterday amen today and forever amen and that word yesterday means whatever he was he meant up into this present time is what he'll be today and he'll be forever amen our god is not a man that he can lie amen neither is he the son of man that he can repent amen then god is calling us amen to search our hearts he meant to search our hearts amen for a full dedication see in other words what he done was he went back to the old landmark he meant he went back to house of hats amen went back to the old landmark and then he began to clean out the rolls he meant it would be good he said for pentecost he meant to go back to the old landmark amen amen it would be good for all of us to go back to the old landmarks amen and clean out the roles amen how many can agree that in your life you've got a landmark somewhere in your life somewhere you've got a landmark now you know what happens amen as things get between amen you and the landmark amen amen things get between you where you can't see the landmark amen then when trouble's coming when trials come and when situations come amen when you cannot lay your eyes upon the landmark amen then you get all scared or you get nervous amen but god is calling a church tonight amen who will rise up in faith and will clean out everything between them and the old landmark and say there's something there that'll hold me in the time of trouble he said i'm talking i suppose mostly amen to pentecostal people this afternoon amen went back to the old landmark he said now you talk about it cleaning up he said there'd be one around the pentecost church it sure would now how many knows that's the truth he said there'd certainly be a reformation going on oh how people would be acting different amen they would be dressing different they would be talking different it'd just be all together a different church if we went back to the old landmark amen where we started from amen let me say we didn't start amen from a division we didn't start from a fuss we didn't start from an argument we started on the day of pentecost he meant in the book of acts and that is where the church has got to go back to that's the only church that god claims as his home now when i begin to think about channels how how can i think about all the channels amen that's in the body of christ and god put those channels in his body amen because he's wanting to flow through them amen now when you begin to talk about a channel you have to realize that a channel amen is a prepared route he meant for something to pass through into something else think about that a channel is a prepared route he meant for something to pass from one thing into another amen a channel is a prepared so it's not something haphazardly it's not something that can just be done amen but it's actually prepared amen because god works through channels can you say amen amen god works through channels now think about this god prepares them channels and the devil does everything he can he meant to clog them up and then god prepares his channels and the devil does everything he can to clog them up amen now a channel becomes clogged up it means it's blocked amen so that little or nothing can pass through it amen so to unclog something means you've got to remove amen all the accumulated matter amen from it you've got to remove some things you can't just mix everything and put everything together amen but you've got to remove some things amen in order for the for the life to flow through that channel and i believe that another word for unclogging could be revival amen i believe another word for unclogging channels amen could be revival amen a revival is to wash all the unbelief amen in the trash out the prophet said and let the people come out amen night after night and see that god is still god amen for i am the lord and i change not therefore ye sons of jacob amen are not consumed amen now let me just stop here and say the channel of god is always open amen it's not we're not here trying to open the channel of god the channel of god is always open and then the prophet said remember church god's words are true and i believe the right mental attitude towards any divine promise of god will bring it to pass if you can look at it in the right way but remember this the first thing i want to find out is whether it's the will or god or will of god or not now think about this then i know it's god's will so the very first thing the for is to find out is it the will of god or is it not but let me go ahead and give you the answer it is god's will that you have revival amen the next thing is my objective to it and my motive in doing it he said then if it's the will of god and my objective is right and my motive is right then i have faith that it'll be done amen see we we've got this settled tonight that it's the will of god amen that we have a revival and our motive and our objective amen is to seek god glorified amen to see souls set free amen to see hearts filled with the holy ghost amen to see life come into empty vessels amen we've got the will of god church amen we've got the right motive and the right objective amen then what is left for revival to take place he said here it is you've got to have the faith that it's going to be done amen anybody want to go and testify based on faith tonight that somebody's going to get healed in these meetings amen somebody's going to get the holy ghost in these meetings and then somebody is going to break out of a prison house and then the devil's held them into for years right here in these meetings amen i'm not saying this based upon feelings or sensation i am claiming this amen based upon the will of god which the prophet said his will is his word his will is his word amen he said if you have a selfish motive then it won't work amen it won't work if your objective is to make money for yourself or something you'll never succeed he said then trying to do something outside of the will of the lord then it won't work to begin with amen amen so there is genuine faith but you must come into the real channel of god to have that genuine faith now there is human faith amen then there's the faith of god he said and you must somebody shout must you must have a godly faith to believe now then to have godly faith amen you must have said again you must amen you must have the mind of christ in you he said then that's how god amen projects to you visions and revelations and all these things comes amen by the mind of christ amen being in you he said do you get it let the mind that was in christ amen be in you now brother we have now found the key to revival it's not the preacher it's not the building it's not the singers amen it's not the attendance amen the key to revival is when the mind of christ amen comes into the church oh thank god amen that's the key to revival amen when the mind of christ comes into you to agree with his will concerning your life amen you want to you want to go into a shout and fit amen let the preacher say amen that you aren't free and let the word say you were free and let your heart agree with what the word is saying and what the anointed man of god is saying and there'll be a revival breaking your heart amen that the devil won't be able to hold back what will it be church it'll be moving from the unseen amen unseen promises into the seen promises now let me preach that for a second all these promises of god are unseen amen but you look at the unseen until you step into that real my faith and by faith the unseen becomes the scene and you can testify but for one physical manifestation you can testify ain't been the answers on this way amen the healing is on its way they've been the deliverances on its way my we'll never find the channel of god without the mind of god we'll never find the channel of god without the mind of god that's why paul will come along and say who hath known amen the mind of the lord that he may instruct him amen let me say this i am preaching to you tonight but i'm doing more than preaching amen i am instructing you amen on how to receive a revival brother andrew how can you stand there and so boldly say that you are instructing the church amen because paul says we have the mind of christ amen if we didn't have the mind of christ then i'm giving you andrew glover's opinions and ben pruitt's ideas amen but when a prophet of god stood and said here is the secret amen the word is in the pride as it was in mary amen the bride has the mind of christ amen for she knows what he wants done with his word she performs the command of the word in his name are you ready for she has amen thus saith the lord amen that's a sound point right there amen we're not waiting for thus saith the lord to come we didn't have thus saith the lord amen but right here in the month of may in the year of 2021 brother peter we have got amen the mind of christ amen by the message of the hour oh and the word is quickened amen by the spirit it comes to pass amen see like a seed that is planted and watered it comes to full harvest amen serving its purpose amen let me just take a minute here and say i'm not here to waste your time amen i'm here to preach the message amen if we're not going to preach the message we might as well go to the coffee house and get a cup of coffee amen because nothing else in the world has got the mind of christ but the message of the hour amen no psychologist amen no deformer no doctor amen but jesus christ the son of man has come down in this generation to release the church that the power of god and the revelation of god could flow through the church once again my the channel of god is open amen but it's our channels that get clogged up don't get caught on me it's our channels that get clogged up amen do you realize in genesis 4 you'll find the first two boys and then we're trying to find the channel of god they meant the channel of god was not blocked off he meant but religion and tradition blocked it off to one whose name was cain right and the bible says by faith abel offered unto god a more what excellent sacrifice amen than cain by which he obtained the witnesses that he was righteous god testified of his gifts and by it he being dead amen yet speaketh now the prophet said cain was just as religious as abel was they both built altars they both loved god they both made sacrifices they both worshipped are you ready they both paid their tithe amen they both done everything alike amen but able by faith which is the revelation amen the word of god revealed made plain showed out and vindicated amen i'll tell you what i'm looking for this weekend amen is the word of god he meant to be made plain amen to show out and to be vindicated and a prophet said glory amen by the true channel cain made an offering amen but god didn't vindicate it right amen see he meant god required worship and cain made the offering but god didn't vindicate it he meant but by the true channel you say well my church is it my wait just a minute god interprets his own word by its terms that he spoke in amen see there was a channel of god and there were two boys amen that were two channels amen looking for forgiveness amen looking for redemption amen looking for restoration amen and god was flowing out they meant exactly what they had need of and then but when that began to flow down king's channel they meant it was all clogged up with a bunch of accumulated fruits and pumpkins and melons and all kinds of things and the power of redemption could not pass through that channel amen but on the other side there was a man named abel amen who by revelation amen had a channel open that when god began to pour down redemption he meant cable could stand up and say thank you lord amen cain thought it was fruit that took us out and fruit they'll bring us back in amen but the blood is the only way back oh help me church have been the blood it's the only way back amen see the prophet said i am religious i am a lover of my maker i offer these it's fine altar i offer to you this sacrifice amen i built all these things up amen lord because i love you amen are you ready abel said the same thing now one was vindicated and one was proven and god come down let's say that together god come down amen god come down and received abel's sacrifice are you ready because by revelation he had struck the true channel of god that was accepted amen accumulated matter they've been out of those channels until the revelation of jesus christ amen could be transferred he meant from himself into his church let me say it like this god opened the channel of a prophetic gift in this generation amen by the fulfillment and the interpretation of his word now can i tell you what the prophet said amen he said when he placed me in this channel of this prophetic gift whatever it might be i do not know he said this bible is open here before me i do not want to just call it in the scripture brother hall them speaks much about it it's being some prophetic gift when he places upon me i try to glorify our heavenly father whatever i can to help his people that's what i do see then god sent the prophet in this age amen to open up the channel he meant where praise and glory would no longer be going to a man but it would be going back to god who is the giver of life to man my to thank god sent that prophetic gift amen to the bride of christ amen you ever wondered why he sent a prophetic gift amen to you because you had a prophetic womb amen that was going to bring forth a prophetic promise hey that's why the prophet would stand and say amen you're a different class of people you are a prophetic class of people now help me church amen you're not just common citizens amen you're prophet you say but then i'm just a young man you're a prophetic young man i'm just a young lady you're a prophetic young lady amen when we recognize the time and the hour we're living in and what a powerful covenant we are under you know what it should do it should move the church into action brother harvey it should move the church amen out of the slump of laodicea it should move the church out of the heaviness of the cares of life into a spot of action remember andrew you're saying amen when we recognize the covenant we're under amen amen it should move us into action well let me tell you what paul said about you if that's okay paul says in hebrews 8 6 but now amen have he obtained a more excellent ministry there's a amen right there's an upgrade okay amen now you are under a more excellent ministry how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant you're under a more excellent ministry you've got a mediator of a better covenant are you ready which was established he meant upon better promises he meant a more excellent ministry they meant a more meat or of a better covenant brother joel and we have been established amen upon better promises oh thanks be to the living god tonight hey we may just be a handful here on the first night but let's break the ice amen it's shouting time amen it's worship time it's time to give god the glory we are not here as a bunch of children amen of blind dark covenants but we are the children of a prophetic covenant that has come from zachariah y'all's pulling tomorrow night out of me amen of a more prophetic covenant which is the prophet zechariah that said in the evening time it shall be light amen when denominations amen are clogged up and they're receiving no light on the vindicated word they're receiving no inspiration amen to move the church oh god they're having soup suppers and bronco games and bingo parties amen to keep the church full there is a people on the earth tonight who is under a more excellent ministry with a mediator of a better covenant and they've been established somebody shout i've been established i've been a host with some attitude i've been established upon better promises i like that up on better promises you know what that tells me that tells me you're up on a better covenant tonight ain't been than any generation before you ever there you better be careful why the problem of god said when that which in part has done away with and that which imperfect has come then that which in part is done away with see tonight church i can happily announce to you what a prophet said we now have the perfect interpretation of the word with divine vindication well brother andrew i think you're trying to move the church into pentecost well be careful before you say that amen let me tell you what a prophet said about miriam he said miriam and them were looking back and they saw that separation they was annihilated from their enemies forever how long was they going to be safe from them these egyptians that you see today you'll see no more forever think about that miriam asked the question lord brother harvey how long will we be safe amen from these egyptians and the lord spoke back and said listen miriam forever forever they're annihilated they're dead and they're gone and put them in the sea of forgetfulness amen to remember them no more that's what kind of a god we have not goes and digs it up again and holds it against you let me take a minute there amen what you have put underneath the sea of forgetfulness let me let me take a moment here and say this amen you didn't put a terror amen brother caleb god put it there amen i didn't put my sins in the sea of forgetfulness god even put my sins in the sea of forgetfulness never somebody shout never never to be remembered again and the prophet said god doesn't go and dig up what is in the sea of forgetfulness and use it against you that's enough to make the pope take the dress off and put a pair of pants on amen god does it go and dig up you've been wanting to get free of that thing for years let me go ahead and tell you tonight on the first night you're free amen god don't remember it god don't hold it it's not in his records it's in the sea of forgetfulness he's not going to dig it up and wave it before you again it's gone it's over yes sir he said i forget about it hey man now listen remember i said no wonder miriam had a hot spell she picked up a tambourine and began to jump up and down on the bank oh you know the holy spirit just likes to catch amen from one to another like adam's in a relay it began to jump from one to another and they all got tambourines hey you know what it wasn't just mary mountain brother allen with the tambourine amen she was so inspired amen by the present day manifestation of the living god that she ran over and picked up a tambourine and began to dance and they looked at her and said miriam why are you dancing in a few days they'll be back on our back she said oh no the word said we'll see them no more forever you're going to call me a pentecostal anyhow so i might as well give you something to work with amen we're going to see him no more forever and the entire congregation even picked up a tambourine and began to praise god amen because their past was over and their future was brighter than the past behind them what are you saying preacher i'm saying tonight the word of god has come inspiration is flowing redemption is in the church the living god is manifesting himself as how shady i it's time to rejoice church he said oh brother moses got so happy brother then they had a real jubilee brother said old brother moses got so happy he went over and picked up a tambourine now right now you take this up with brother branham okay and held his hands up and saying in the spirit if that ain't a holy roller meeting i've never seen one he said that's right this is nothing new it's just a new tape with the old it's just the new amen taped with the old that's right are you ready are you ready there they was singing in the spirit beating all the music clapping their hands what a time they was having why brother brother why was they shouting why was they beating the music why was they clapping their hands amen there they was annihilated from their enemy and he still does the same thing under a better covenant he says way better than the old covenant well brother david amen if miriam could have a hot spell under the old covenant you better believe i'm going to have a hot spell when i've got a more excellent ministry and a mediator of a more perfect covenant and i've been established upon better promises in the face of every devil there is a pride on the earth tonight who is under the fulfillment of a better covenant sir amen you realize what she was shouting under she was shouting under the old covenant which let me tell you what that says amen who forgiveth all thine iniquities are you ready forgiveth all thy iniquities who healeth all thy diseases miriam didn't even have the 39 stripes that was laid upon the back of jesus which would cover the 39 major sicknesses is this okay miriam didn't even have amen to see the full revelation brother carlton of the sea of forgetfulness she didn't have amen the full amen brother brother joel she was under the blood of a bull and a goat that was the old covenant but she trusted the god of that covenant amen so much that she began to shout and she began to praise god the prophet said see in the old testament they had one prescription under the old covenant you know what that was i am the lord that healeth all thy diseases amen one prescription in the entire book amen covered every disease i am the lord that healeth all thy diseases well can i tell you what the prophet said he said we have some better 600 promises on divine healing alone hey we have some 600 promises on divine healing alone see and in fact under the covenant how much greater is the covenant today now think about this if he did that under the type then what will he do under the anti-top you know what i began to believe christian friend that we're just living in the beginning of the greatest time this world has ever witnessed are you ready for this i just believe that all of the lines are getting unclogged you know they've been clogged up with all kinds of doctrines and theologies and stuff and unbelief that's been handed down that's been handed down from generation to generation to generation now i'm going to take a minute here and take some liberty okay amen there's been curses that's been handed down from generation to generation to generation you know what is cur is a curse is a demon of alcoholism that will be passed down from generation to generation to generation are you with me amen amen amen sugar diabetes amen all kinds of things can be passed down from generation to generation but somewhere or another it's got to stop somewhere another it's gonna stop let me say something else we focus so much on those things being passed down from generation generation and we say well that clogs up their lives and truly it does amen but can i can i attack another devil right now what about that old what about that old devil that says william branham is just a prophet but his message is not the absolute what about that old devil that says well it was malachi 4. oh i hit something there he was malachi 4 but you can't trust other things he taught what about that old killed the meeting right there in five minutes didn't i well i'll preach right through it what about that old devil that says you can only believe the first pull and the second pull but the third pull is some return ministry or some prophet coming back in the future amen i tell you what amen if you pass that nonsense down to your grandchild you ought to be ashamed of yourself if you pass that lie down to your children you ought to find an altar and repent you are robbing them of the living god who is manifesting himself in the power of revelation in the age they're living in well it's the truth anyhow isn't it amen how much longer are we going to put god in a corner amen our young people need to know what it's like to hear the message preach and the angel of god amen come in the church our young kids need to know what it's like amen to see holy ghost believers amen have hot spells like miriam hat come on church amen don't get caught on me now amen you realize we got kids in this message it's never seen the holy ghost fall in the church we've got kids in this amen in a meet not long ago and the holy ghost fell and two sisters began speaking in tongues and a preacher come out behind the building and there was kids out there said my god i never seen nothing like that before you know what i say i say it's a shame that a kid sit in a message church and have to feed up on the complex of some preacher it ain't god i'm gonna preach anyhow it's a shame ain't meant to rob this generation of an outburst of the holy ghost flowing through their lives well brother andrew i don't agree with you well i disagree with you so we'll disagree to disagree is that okay this message is not a toy it's the inspiration of god this message is not a better idea it is the idea of god this message it's not a better way to live it's the only way to live this message it's not a way to preach it's the only way to pray what are you saying preacher i'm saying it's the only thing that'll open the channels in the churches in this last day is preach the message well can can we all just take a minute here and say amen at one time well at least everybody leave here and said they said amen is it the truth or not what's going to blow the devils out of our churches the message of the hour what's going to uncover sin and produce a holy ghost life the message of the hour what's going to break down bars and walls and denominational indifferences i may get right out of town time i get done tonight but that's quite all right amen what's going to tear down the walls between fellowship and with believers you're going to pass it down to another generation if you don't do it well is it the truth are you we've got we've got kids in this message they've been talking about divisions in churches 50 years ago and they weren't even born to live through them hello y'all knew i want no pennyweight when you called me out here amen kids around this message amen talking about arguments amen 30 years ago and 40 years ago i'll tell you what it's time to do it's time to quit being a nicolaitan and bury the battle axe and let the holy ghost come back in the church and flow with the power and the inspiration and the joy and the liberty and the power of revival i'm not a crazy man i'm a believer that believes there's dynamite in this message that'll clear out every channel and let the living god begin to flow through his church once again until we can say his hands or my hands his feet or my feet somewhere another you got to bury it ah oh god brother ben hope i don't get in trouble somewhere another you got to bury it or you're going to kill the next generation well they need to know about my hurts why can't you preach them some healing come on oh it's a pity party that's clogged up the churches to where preachers can't even shake hands no more because of some political indifference come on church amen i think it's a shame amen that our kids go to youth camps and they get a charge of the holy ghost and they come back to churches and they they get shut down and squashed out because so and so didn't believe in the move of god 30 years ago oh preach brother andrew think i believe i will i'm telling you church you want a revival kill that thing you want a revival let the holy ghost blow your petty indifference out of the water until joy takes the place of bitterness until happiness takes the place of sadness until healing takes the place of hurts it's gonna be passed down until somebody stands up and stops it well i i can't get off this i have literally brother ben i have literally stood amen and talked to people in this message kids young people said what do you hey you know why don't you once you do this well brother so-and-so told me that years ago brother so-and-so offended him so we just don't shake hands clogging up the channels and then you know what's the funny thing about it they clog up the channels and then blame other people that's in revival for their channels being clogged they letting differences in bitterness is this okay they they let petty differences on doctrines amen amen amen amen fill up the the channels until they come to church and they get behind the pulpit and there's no inspiration because the channel of god is clogged up with feelings and hurts and offenses amen there's no there's no movement of the holy ghost because the channels are all filled up with a bunch of nonsense amen and because god ain't doing nothing there amen they lash out at everybody else amen but can i give you a little word of advice amen blow your own channels out and get your own revival well brother andrew we just automatically believe it's going to be that way but the prophet said it's come to a place where you've got to quit believing that old formal way amen that old formal way that says this is the way it's going to be i'm here to tell you that jesus who is the way said that's not the way it's got to be what are you saying preacher i'm saying the spirit of truth has returned in this age to let you know you're not subject to believe that devils lie any longer what oh mercy what this john said brother andrew who you at i'm after nobody but a spirit and i'll not quit until that devil loses his grip on the hands of god's children i'll not back up until that demon is laying in defeat and bitternesses are healed and hurts her come on well howbeit amen when he the spirit of truth has come he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear amen that shall he speak and he will show you amen things to come see look what the spirit of truth is going to do he's going to turn your attention from the past to the future to show you things that was things that has been or things that is to come now the prophet picks this up and says for years we've got what we call a lie detector he said you put it on your wrist you set it across your head and you can get in there and you can try your best to make us lie sound like the truth and it'll register negative every time because a human was not made to lie lying is not an easy thing it's a hard deceitful thing it's an evil thing now a prophet of god said i'd rather have a drunk with me than a liar well put your seat belts on we're going to go through it your body wasn't made to lie no matter how sinful you are he said you're still a fallen son of god the most sinful person in this city today god didn't intend you to be sinful he wanted you to be a son or a daughter of his you're made up in his own makeup but sin has called you to do that you cannot tell the lie with that scientific instrument on you amen but it'll still register negative because there's a subconscious down in a human being and that subconscious knows the truth therefore if a man or a woman could ever get their thoughts and their testimony and their lives so lined up with god until the channel of the holy spirit would be perfectly one with god what would take place if you could get your thoughts your testimony and our lives lined up with god what could take place if the man and the woman could ever get lined up now you ready we're with freedom from their hearts and with faith from their innermost they come the author to be prayed for and all they've got is intellectual faith but when it comes from the heart all things are possible then see what happens brother harvey your confession meets up with your life and your life speaks as loud as your confession does but when your confession says one thing and your life lives another there's something wrong somewhere that's because you've got an intellectual faith and not a faith from the heart but that shows outside here is the knowledge of god are you ready but inside here is a demon of doubting i believe in divine healing but it's not for me it could be soul but i don't believe it get it outside you say yes but your conscience says no he said the scientific thing would prove that wasn't right now think about this the scientific thing will prove it's not right now watch this one of the one of satan's favorite channels he meant to clog up is the channel of inspiration now amen brother i don't know if you can give me some more on these four monitors i'd sure appreciate it amen amen but there is a spirit in man now watch this job 32 8 there is a spirit in man and the inspiration of the almighty giveth him understanding now when brother man comes here and i have heard but now i see he actually takes time to refer back to the service previous on trying to do god a service without it being his will now watch this he said there's david just as inspired as could be all the people shouting thank you buddy and glorifying god for a reason that seemed exactly scripture but he was the wrong person he said the inspiration should have come to nathan he said job was the prophet in his day and the only thing god had done to job was always give him wisdom and his word and inspiration but he could get no inspiration but he knowed all of his mechanics his burn free everything was right but he couldn't get a word from god but the devil couldn't move him there you are see now there's where you are when you're paid for it you don't have to run back through the line or get let somebody else pray for you but when you know you've done exactly what god told you to do then you wait somebody say you wait then you wait for that channel of inspiration to open up to you and now i am healed glory to god are you hearing me church amen amen brother ben can i use you for an example amen you've got to am i'm not laying this on your claim and okay but just an example you're sitting in a meeting and you've got a sickness in your body so you get up from your seat and you walk up to the altar and you say preacher pray for me and i come over there and i say brother ben i say what do you need from the lord and he says i got a sickness and i say okay here's what we're going to do we're going to lay hands on you and we're going to curse that thing in the name of jesus christ what symptoms have you got well it's a pain in my back it's a pain in my side i say okay in the name of jesus christ we curse that pain we curse that symptom are you ready before he got up something inspired him to come to where he was now and when he's standing here i'm under the channel the same inspire that inspired him to come for prayer is the same inspire that has inspired me to pray for him and when he leaves this altar and walks back to his seed that pain could still be there and the devil come around and say ben did it do any good did you did you should you really gone up there well you made a fool of yourself amen but when there's nothing accumulated in the channel then the same inspiration that moved him to be prayed for that moved me to pray for him is the same inspiration oh god that'll drop in his heart and he'll shout out i am healed oh come on church i'm telling you tonight that same inspire is in the building tonight are you sick i challenge you to scream out i am healed are you bound i challenge you tonight to cry out i am free what are you talking about preacher when it drops in there it's all over when it drops in there sister eve it's all over that back trouble's gone when it drops in there oh god are y'all hearing me tonight i ain't gonna preach all night i'm about done brother when it drops in there it's all over there's no more room for accumulated symptoms there's no more room for accumulated problems there's no more room amen for the devil of doubt amen to manifest himself through your confession amen your thoughts and your life and your mind and your testimony has become so perfect in the channel of god until he can sin the dead he can send an inspiration in there when it's revealed to you you yourself has received god's promise the inspiration you being a christian it struck you he said you don't need a prayer line then brother andrew what do i need brother ben what do i need amen brother joe what do i need can i tell you what a prophet said he said you need an open heart you need an open heart he said when all the mechanics are ready then let the inspiration drop in there and nothing can change your mind the same bible that is inspired of countless of others is the same bible god i know this is the first night but i'm feeling pretty good right now are y'all hearing me this is the same bible that congress went up shaw read out of when he was spontaneously healed this is the same bible that william branham was preaching out of when georgia carter allen and then got up off the bed this is the same bible he was carrying when the boy in finland amen stood up on his feet it's the same bible that he was buried when blind man received his i'm not preaching from a different bible i'm preaching from the same bible and what's that tell me the same god that inspired william branham to preach it is the same god that's inspired me and the same god that inspired them to believe it it's the same god inspiring you to believe it oh give him some praise go ahead break out of that form break out of that fashion give god some praise open up that channel go ahead there for a few minutes open up that channel open up that channel open up that channel open up that channel of praise open up that channel of worship open up that channel of the holy ghost fit open up that channel let the inspiration of the holy ghost let it open up tonight on the first night of this meeting let every clock channel in this church open up let the channel of faith open up let the channel of power open up let the channel fellowship let it open up tonight church hey it's the same bible it's not a different bible it's the same inspire inspired them inspired us this to believe what he wrote are you all hearing me tonight no when a man is inspired and he reads the inspired word the two inspirations give a result when a man is inspired and he reads the inspired word isn't that good you're not placing brother david the inspiration upon the word it's already on it when you're down in the valley of valleys and the low of lows and you read this word you're not placing an anointing on this word to lift you up out of the valley the anointing is already on the word no matter how well you study it it'll never do you no good until you're inspired yourself the word let's say this together the word is already inspired so what we need today is an inspiration over us what are these meetings for it's not the building of a preacher it's not the building of the kingdom it's for the word that's inspired to send an inspiration over us amen god's sweeping down with a new inspiration and breathing over us his power and his love and himself that it might inspire us amen to quicken us and to awaken us to his word and then the word being brought into that inspiration then you'll see miracles happen and things will take place because the two has come together oh somebody shout the two has come together amen let's claim that tonight in this meeting amen the two has come together they've been the inspired word amen has come together with the bride of christ and those two inspirations brother are coming together to release miracles in this meeting church i'm not a crazy man i just happen to be in in the past few months in some old-fashioned holy ghost meetings where the miracles of god are still taking place where demons are still being cast out we're a holy ghost it's still falling in the middle of the church sir brother andrew what are you going to do all weekend tell us about those meetings i might but here's what i'm going to do i'm going to leave here talking about these meetings because you're here no because the inspired word is in the church and there's a faith in the heart of believers to receive from that inspired word and something's got to happen amen will you get preachy with me for a second what will you get preaching with me for a second will you nudge your neighbor and look at your neighbor and say neighbor neighbor something good is fissing to happen brother something good is fixing that won't you just go ahead and shake your neighbor's hand and just go ahead and say brother amen sister something good is fixing to happen and then don't leave anybody untouched amen something good is fixing to happen amen in these meetings this weekend i'm claiming it i believe it it's on its way the holy ghost will perform it amen somebody shouted with me something good is about to happen channels are about to come open hearts are about to open up amen lives are about to be changed something good is about to happen listen you can't get believers together without something good happening you can't get believers with the same expectations in the same building without something good happening now i got a few more minutes here i'm watching my timer can i give you a witness can i give you a bible witness she's in mark 14. she's a woman who came and washed the feet of jesus do you realize when she got brother the carlton when she got to the feet of jesus she had nothing to do the service with she didn't have the water she didn't have the towel but she had read in her heart she had read in the word and in her heart was an inspiration laying there he still forgives sinners oh and she knew if i just get in his presence you know what the father said she had to do she had to elbow her way through the crown brother allen just to get at his feet she had to she had to kick this out of the way and she had she had to clean the channels out there was a lot in between her and that landmark oh thank you god there was a lot between her and that landmark and she had to move this doubter out of the way and she had to push this critic out of the way and she had to push this unbeliever out of the way and he had to push this skeptic out the way i had to push all these things out of the way no doubt brother ben when she was going through there they were saying what are you doing she was saying if i just get to his feet they were saying what are you gonna do she said i'm gonna wash his feet i'm gonna dry his feet they said woman you ain't got no towel do you realize she didn't even take fault she didn't even take fault when she was elbowing her way through she just knew brother david if i get there the water will be there if i get there and then the towel will be there if i get there the answer will be there if i get there forgiveness will be there and she elbowed her way to the crowd and she finally made it to his feet and she fell down on her feet on her face at his feet and she began to wash his feet with her tears and she began to dry his feet with the hairs of her head and the prophet said god furnished the water and towels to wash his feet because she had heard of the living god and all of her life but now she's seen him with her own eyes she knew him and inspiration struck her and said this is the messenger he needed a service she had nothing to serve him by his feet was dirty but she rushed forward anyhow to do him a service because she was inspired she was inspired to do it but the david there was a channel of inspiration now you know what amazes me and i'm i'm i'm fixing to land this thing okay you know what amazes me it includes water and she had no water but here's the reality of it she was packing she was packing the water i feel like running through a troop and leaping over a wall right there she was carrying the water the only thing it needed to do was get in the presence of something that could release it y'all hear me tonight i'm preaching to you right now she just needed to get in the presence of something that had more power than she did to release that water you realize in the old testament the one the war taxes the enemy would come in and do was stop up the water channels the bible actually tells us the enemy would come in and cut off the water supply because the enemy knew if we cut off the water they'll die the bible says in genesis 26 and i'm not going to take time to read it but you can read when you get home that isaac isaac departed fence and he dig the wells of water and then the servants dig to the valley and they found the well well springing and then the herdsmen of gareer strovin the water is ours and they called the name will of the whale esik and they because they struggle with him then they dig another well and stroke for that also and he called the name of it sitna and he says in verse 22 and he removed from fence and digged another whale and for that they strove not and he called the name of it rehoboth and he said are you ready for this for now the lord hath made room for us and we shall be fruitful in the land bubram says in the pa and i'm closing here in the public utility he said if you don't pay the bill they'll cut the water off he said you'll drop around the house and that's what's the matter with god's people tonight he said they just didn't pay the price and god cut their water off go to any desert you want to some full gospel church remember so forth don't believe in divine healing the reason is your water has been cut off where there's no water it gets stickers where there's no water to soften the leaves it becomes stickers so they found out that it was with without water and he says and when you're without water you are without life when you are without water you are without life now think about this in these meetings somebody say we must we must allow the holy spirit to unclog every channel satan loves to clog the channel of our purpose with our failures well i can't do that and i can't serve god because i failed him satan loves to accumulate all your failures in the channel that god is wanting to pour inspiration into your purpose but according to ephesians 3 let me let me just get down here and i'll close according to ephesians 3 the purpose of god is eternal then tonight friends the holy ghost is looking for someone who is willing to let loose in these meetings in this service and let the holy spirit take control of your being because the holy ghost is here tonight you believe he's here tonight you know what he's here to do he's here to open up the spiritual arteries of this church of your life in your church in your home the bible says ye shall receive power after the holy ghost has come upon you and ye shall be witnesses of me both in jerusalem and in all judea and samaria and the uttermost parts of the earth and the problem of god says like this he says he says see he gave the commission the disciples 120 they should wait in the city of jerusalem he said there was a certain specification that they must meet before they could be qualified as a witness and he said this qualification was to be the coming of the promised holy spirit somebody say to fill the church with action and the word unction comes from the greek word dynamite where it means an explosion i'm just going to give you a warning god's sending some dynamite into these meetings not because i'm here or any other preacher would be here this message the message of the hour is the dynamite that will unclog every channel you remember in the book of kings and i'm i'm down here in the book of kings they've gone out there and they all got dried up remember that they didn't have a vision they went off without a vision i was actually listening to this tape today let me let me just read this to you the prophet god said see he said now they said i saw a vision i see the way out prophet told him said i know what to do. and he said i tell you today the church hasn't got the vision or they'd have more prayer and they'd be more spiritual than what they are he said unless there is a vision unless someone can see the vision see the coming of the lord seeing the things that we're going through with see all these things that god predicted that would be in the last days and here we are living in them now listen to this instead of reading the bible he says we're reading love stories instead of reading that we read everything else we ought to be reading god's bible and on our knees constantly praying for god to help us awakening in our an awakening in our soul a crying out to the lord when they seen this song when they when they seen when he said he's seen how they the way out now the first thing i want you to do is make this valley full of ditches probably god said i say that tonight that's what we got to do is make the way for the holy ghost to pour down well brother brother brother branham i i don't do nothing he said now see here's the thing make it in your house make it in your church make it in yourself kick everything out of the way and get ready are you ready for this there's coming a gusher there's coming to gusher if you'll get ready for it but if you don't make ready for it you'll never see it he said brother brown i don't do nothing maybe that's what's the matter that's the trouble of it it's more of a sin to do not to do than it is to do when you know better see he know what to do good do it not to him it's a sin he said remember remember you southerners remember grant was sitting on the cross the river and he had a boy out there on guard duty and the rebels was across the river and this boy was walking along there kind of dazed around with the dreams of his sweetheart he left his poster dude and went down to pick some violence to send to his sweetheart he didn't mean to do wrong then at that time he was a spy ready of the southern army and they slipped in and they looked around they found out the southern army was two or three times the size of general grant well what happened they come back on the post of duty not knowing what had happened he said the spy had already been there and what happened they stormed across the river drove them come back in the state and the boy was shot an hour later they didn't have not no objection to him picking the violence they didn't it wasn't what he had done it was the things he didn't do he didn't stand at his post of duty he didn't guard the post like he was supposed to and he spoiled the whole thing the prophet god said notice when they begin to dig they dug right against the thing that says the musicians are coming they begin to dig right against the things just voted out made big ditches the next morning the enemy looked down and the sun came up and it looked like blood they said well they've fallen on one another killed each other and the way they went and they were ambushed and they said this is just the light thing before the lord sending forth his water and they went over the other land and they stomped up every whale cut down every good tree they just had a real old-fashioned revival brother david before this happened they were asking god because they finally went consulted the prophet they left without consulting the prophet they got this condition they went consult the prophet and the prophet said listen you go make them valley full of because there's a gusher of water coming you go get the valley full of now can i just show you something god does exceedingly and abundantly above all we could even ask or think um think about this the enemy was coming the moral bites was coming and god told them go down there and dig the ditches and i'll send water through a prophet i'll send water but i'll also do under your enemies what your enemies thought to do unto you i can't catch a second wind right there come on i'm telling you tonight church you start digging some ditches there's a gusher coming it's the same smitten rock that moses saw was in the vision of elisha in 2nd kings 3. when you get them ditches dug and that water comes and feels and ditches up the problem of god said god will go due to your enemies what's your enemy stuff they do unto you that right there makes me want to grab a shovel thank you that makes me want to grab a shovel and start digging out these ditches anybody want some water this weekend all right dig out two feet you'll get two foot of water yeah dig out three feet you'll get three feet of water yeah dig out 10 feet you'll get 10 feet of water but if you go to digging right now and you don't stop digging between now and the end of these meetings if we make it that far it ain't no telling the amount of water you'll get every inch you dig is another inch god will thank you feel so if all you dig out is enough just to get enough joy to come to church three times a week that's all the water you're going to get but is there anybody here tonight says god i want to start digging till every ditch is empty forever till every bit of accumulated matter that's accumulated in my heart is gone until the inspiration can full of the church again and strike my heart thank you once you stand all this jumping up and down and hollering amen well we don't much appreciate all your criticism either but anyhow let me tell you what the prophet said he said lay aside the thought of getting healed in the future services and say i'm going to get healed right now this is my time i'm going to dig a ditch here that when the holy spirit falls my heart's going to fill up and i'm going to jump up and start running and i'm going to be healed the deeper you dig the more water you'll have when the holy ghost falls in my heart it's going to fill up and i'm going to jump up and take off running where are we going to run to brother joe victory authority reality how many can say tonight lord dig out the spiritual whales of my life unclog the channels tonight god bless our hearts together thank you lord oh my if the devil had his way tonight we wouldn't know one of us be here tonight the devil had his way in our hearts and our lives and our homes and our churches our churches would be dry our young people would be dried up the ministry would be dried up but god who is rich in mercy has allowed us another opportunity to keep the heart to open our heart to clean out all the accumulated matter in our heart that don't belong there but there being one here tonight would say lord on this first night help me to help me to dig out all the channels of my heart maybe you're a young person here maybe maybe things have been passed down to you generation the generation [Music] maybe you're carrying things that that you weren't even born to even live through or experience but today and right now it can stop maybe something has been passed down to you that maybe maybe it's at all in your heart to get somebody and you don't even know the person but because of something that was said is passed down to you because of a generation before you zone would you say tonight lord let it stop with me what brother andrew you're saying i've got to agree with the wrong i'm not saying that at all i'm saying you've got to stay open your channels can't get caught up you've got to stay in a place where the inspiration of god can flow through your life can flow through your heart he's here tonight he's here in the power of his word heavenly father lord all across this field and tonight as believers lord father there's believers of light precious faith here in this building tonight or there's hearts here that are open before you or there's lives that are here open before you tonight maybe they've been sitting in church and they've been hearing the inspired word but lord it methods inspired methods movement and methods caused them to rise up and claim the promises of god but lord i believe tonight that if that would be the case i believe you've said a word in this evening time that's answered the question it's because we've allowed the channels to become climbed up we've allowed the channels the faith and the channels of fellowship lord the channels of of shouting and rejoicing and preaching the message of the hour though there's preachers in this message that have allowed hurts and bitterness and things to accumulate in their channels lord lord to where they're trying to pass down those hurts to other generations lord they're trying to pass down the people that offended them and get people offended at the person defended them lord so much nonsense going on [Music] but lord you've sent a message of dynamite to blow out every channel to where we don't have to leave this building tonight with one ill feeling in our heart with one all against one another in our heart lord we don't have to come to these meetings wish that we could receive inspiration wishing we could receive deliverance wish that we could receive the holy ghost
