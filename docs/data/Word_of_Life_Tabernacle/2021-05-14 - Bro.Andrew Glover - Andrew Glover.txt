church and that's a amen that's a testimony of a real warrior amen and so sure want to lift him up in prayer and just before we read the word let's just buy our heads together for a word of prayer if you have a special need upon your heart something you desire the lord just to maybe a question or direction or something won't you just ask him to come by your way amen he's mindful tonight heavenly father lord as your believers have gathered here this evening on this friday afternoon lord there's many places and many things we could be doing but lord there is a deep calling to the deep lord father to be in your house and to be in your presence and i pray tonight lord as the believers have laid aside the cares of life and the situations lord father to make their way into this meeting this evening lord i am a firm believer that you don't bring a group of people together lord to make them leave disappointed or to leave empty but lord i believe you feel with the holy ghost i believe you heal the sick i believe you save the lost i believe anything is possible lord in atmospheres like this so tonight father we invite you to come take the preeminence among us lord father may you move every one of us aside both speaker and hearer lord for every hand that was raised behind that hand there is a need and lord there's one thing we know that you're still a waymaker you're still a miracle worker you're still a promise keeper so i pray tonight lord that you would come manifest yourself among us tonight lord father may you bless these men of god that are represented here tonight bless their churches father lord their efforts and their labors to lift this message above the people lord and to point them to the resurrected christ i pray you would bless him abundantly father for every individual here tonight god may you bless their assemblies lord may you bless their pastors lord may you just come lord in this assembly and bless brother being father bless this church lord we we're not here lord to lift up man or to build kingdoms but lord we are here lord to preach the message of the hour and to tear down the devil's kingdom and to see your kingdom established in the hearts of adults and young people alike so come tonight lord we make you the welcome guest we give you the right away father have your way among us lord lord forgive us of our failures and our shortcomings and lord when this meeting would be dismissed we'll be sure to say surely the lord was among us and you did all things father we love you this evening in the wonderful name of our lord and savior jesus christ we pray and all the believers said amen amen god bless you we sure want to bring you greetings as well from our pastor brother sean martin and all the saints there at faith tabernacle bringing greetings from home this evening and in the book of matthew the 21st chapter and the first verse the bible says when they drew nai unto jerusalem and were coming to beth age unto the mount of olives olives then sent jesus to disciples saying unto them go into the village over against you and straightway ye shall find an ass tied and a cult with her loose them and bring them unto me and if any man say alt unto you ye shall say the lord hath need of them and straightway he will send them and this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet saying so this was this was done to fulfill scripture to fulfill the word tell ye the daughter of zion behold the king cometh unto thee meek and sitting upon an ass and the colt the foal of an ass and the disciples went and did as jesus commanded them and brought the ass and the colt and put on them their clothes and they set him there on notice in a very great multitude spread their garments in the way and others cut down branches from the trees and strawed them in the way now that word multitude actually means common people so it wasn't any special superhumans it was there it was actually common people and the multitudes that went before and that followed cried saying hosanna to the son of david blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord hosanna in the highest now when he was come into jerusalem all the city was moved somebody say moved all the city was moved saying who is this and the multitude said this is jesus the prophet of nazareth of galilee amen i like that the multitude or the common people said this is jesus amen the prophet of nazareth of galilee now if we could look in the book of romans the eighth chapter romans the eighth chapter in just one verse i want to read there with you this evening we'll find our assignment from the word in the scriptures this evening romans 18 and verse 19 a very very familiar scripture here to the believers but paul writing here in the 19th verse he says for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation notice here he doesn't say of the son of god but he says for the manifestation of the sons of god so amen he's not just looking for the manifestation of the son of god he's looking for the manifestation of these sons of god for the creature was made subject to vanity not willing but by reason of him who is subjected the same in hope because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption somebody say into the glorious liberty of the children of god amen not any kind of liberty but being delivered into the glorious liberty we ask the lord this evening to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you may have your seats there this afternoon for just a few moments if the lord would help me uh from these scriptures tonight i would like to minister to you on drawn by the spirit to the attraction drawn by the spirit to the attraction i i believeth all of my heart this evening that the lord amen has allowed us to come together one more time amen aren't you thankful for that amen think about this time last year and we were just trying to really start having meetings again and cove and everything and shut things down amen but here tonight the lord has allowed us to come together one more time and maybe if i could say it this way the lord has brought us together amen or the lord has drawn us together one more time now you realize we are not drawn here by the will of man we are not drawn here by the desires of man amen but we are drawn here by the will of god now amen when you begin to look at the drawing power of god you'll read there in song of solomon the first chapter and the fourth verse the bible says draw me and we will run after thee the king hath brought me into his chambers and we will be glad and rejoice in thee and we will remember thou love more than wine the upright love thee in jeremiah 31 verse 3 the lord hath appeared unto me of old amen saying yea i have loved thee with an everlasting love aren't in that good to know that you are loved tonight with not a temporary love but an everlasting love amen amen it's not a filial love but it is an agape love which is the love of god amen therefore with loving kindness have i drawn these so god is telling his people he meant with loving kindness have i drawn thee that word loving kindness actually means amen goodness it means kindness and it means faithfulness so in other words he's saying we are being drawn by the goodness of god we are being drawn by the kindness of god amen we are being drawn by the faithfulness of god so when you read that amen you realize there's something more than a man here at work amen but there is a supernatural being here at work there's more than just amen a prophet here at work but there is a supernatural god on the scene amen when you leave the old testament and go to the new in john 6 44 jesus is going to say no man come to me except the father which has sent me amen draw him notice this it's not you coming on your own accord amen but there's something drawing you and i will raise him up at the last day he would go to say in john 12 32 and i amen if i be lifted up from the earth will draw all men unto me amen and then he's going to draw him and he's going to be lifted up amen then whatever is being lifted up before the people is what has got the power amen to draw the people see that word draw there means to drag off it means to draw amen by an inward power it means to lead amen it means to impale then to think tonight amen that you're not being involved by the outside amen but there's something on the inside calling you to what you've been drawn to tonight and then the prophet says in thirsting for life one thing we do amen is we just cast the net in and then draw it but the holy spirit draws amen jesus said if i be lifted up i will draw all men unto me in the message the token 63 you take ducks when it's time for swarming amen they all run together when bees and everything else get ready he said there is some instinct in them amen that draws them there's an instinct in the duck there's an instinct in the bee there's an instinct in the bird that draws them together amen for the swarm or for the run amen and the prophet said the holy spirit amen draws the people amen let me say tonight if there is an instinct in nature amen then there's a living god in humanity tonight amen that it's more than a man that has pulled you together amen let me just say this a flyer didn't bring you to this building tonight amen a preacher's name didn't bring you to this building tonight amen but if you are here amen it's because there's a deep calling to the deep and there's something on the inside of you amen that when it feels the least bit of tug when it feels at least better than pale amen from the spirit of god there's something in you says i can't sit here amen i've got to go amen what is that that is the holy spirit and then drawing the people together i think of isaiah the 43rd chapter and the fifth verse says fear not amen for i am with thee and i will bring thy seed somebody shout thy seed amen i will bring thy seed amen from the east and gather thee from the west and i will say to the north amen give up and to the south keep not back and bring my sons from afar and my daughters from the ends of the earth every one of them that is called by my name for i have created him amen for my glory i have formed him amen god said yea i have made him amen what does that tell me brother matt that tells me when god gets ready amen to gather his people together amen the east is not strong enough to hold him back and the west is not strong enough to keep him apart oh come on church and then when god wants to draw people together amen it don't matter what walls that a man is built it don't matter what lies or the preacher is told it don't matter what denominational differences are there when god says i will gather my people and then the north has to give up and the south has to turn loose what do you say in church i'm saying fear not amen god has brought us together tonight he has made these meetings not for a man to be glorified a member for his seed amen to let go for just a few moments and begin to praise god until we forget about our problems do we forget about our situation don't we forget about who heard us oh come on church we've not gathered for tonight to see a man glorified we have gathered here tonight amen to lift up the son of man he said if i'll be lifted up i will draw all men unto myself and when you see him you realize you're not there on your own accord but there was something in you amen that was stronger than the bad day you had there was something in you that was stronger than the mistakes you made that literally pulled you into the presence of jesus christ no i'm not a crazy man i am a believer that this message has still got the power amen to draw sinners this message has still got the power amen to put back spiders and then back on the front row with the fire burning in their soul this message hasn't lost its power it's got more power today amen than any denominational preacher this message has got more power than any idea of a man it is the holy spirit amen who is drawing oh god has drawn us together am i to think the prophet said there's no two holy spirits isn't that good there's no two holy spirits there's only one and the same holy spirit that gave samia in that promise is the same holy spirit that has drawed you here tonight he said is that right he made you come sister and he made you come sister he said in you and you and you and every one of you he brought you here don't that make you want to shout a minute amen he brought you here he said the devil would never bring you around a place like this he said i'll guarantee you that he meant the holy ghost brought you here if you believe in divine healing then the holy spirit brought you where there's a fountain of divine healing open in the house of god he said just like he did simeon you embrace god's promise the same way that simeon did and then now let me just take a time out here and say this amen there's no two holy ghosts amen then that tells me amen the same holy ghost that revealed isaiah's prophecy amen to a man named simeon is the same holy ghost that is in the church of the living god tonight that is not revealing he meant another idea he is revealing the message of the hour putting a hunger in the first in the heart of people to go get what the message said they could have see if there's a hunger there for divine healing there's a fountain open to receive it if there's a amen she was blind amen naturally he meant she was physically blind he said but that didn't change her spiritual sight he meant because the holy ghost was not leading her by her physical disabilities he meant he was leading her and then by the inward power that was on the inside of her oh glory to god amen don't you see why you're here tonight amen because you're outward man it's perishing day by day but there's an inward man in there who is feeling a pull who is stealing a brawl who is filled with dragon off who is feeling an impaling power on the inside of your heart that says if i just get in the presence of god something will take place he said yes sir he is here tonight somebody shout he is here tonight he has risen from the dead and he's given you the promise are you ready for this the holy spirit amen brawled you together if the holy spirit hadn't brought you here you would be out somewhere in the world but you're sitting here in this hot building come on and you're fanning why because you are expecting to see jesus christ amen come on the scene and confirm his word amen your expectation if you expect come to find something to criticize then the devil will show you plenty to criticize he certainly will amen some say well now if i don't get it from the prayer line i'll see if i can get it here you'll get what you expect can i tell you what i'm expecting amen now you may have been expected to come and see a preacher you may have been expecting to come and see who showed up but who didn't show up and amen who had on what who did are you with me amen can i tell you what i come expecting for for the brain i come expecting to see the holy spirit amen come and manifest himself in his power i come expecting him to pour out his glory upon this building here that many would receive the baptism of the holy spirit he meant and sinners would weep their weight at calvary and the sick would be healed and all manners of signs and wonders because jesus christ promised it amen brother what gives us the license amen to believe that is possible brother matt because jesus christ had been promised it is possible and i believe his promise in the face of every doubt i believe his promise in the face of every skeptic i believe his promise in the face of every unbeliever i believe his promise because i am a believer now amen i'm not drawn here amen because of a famine i'm drawn here because of a see the bible actually prophesied that the time we're living in amos said behold the day comes saith the lord that i will send a famine amen in the land who sent this famine amen amos the prophet said god would send the famine in the land it would not be a famine of bread nor a thirst for water but of hearing the words of the lord notice what they shall do they shall wander from the east amen from the west from the north from the south they shall wander from sea to sea amen and seek to find the word of the lord and they shall not find it amen that's a that's a that's a contrast right there amen that's a powerful contrast they've been there's two groups of people brother david wandering across the same earth amen from sea to sea amen from north to south amen from east to west and they're not finding what they're seeking amen but there's another group of people on the face of the earth who is going from the north to the south amen from the east and the west and they're finding exactly what they're hungering for you know what the difference is amen one is god an attraction and the other ain't got nothing come on church amen you get an attraction amen let me tell you this you get in the tracks in the house of god and people drive a thousand miles for one service you'll get an attraction in the house of god amen and men will pack up their babies amen and campers and travel across the world amen to hear one sermon amen i'm not talking about personality i'm talking about somebody and then preach the message and watch them come from the east and the west and the north and the south now i may get in trouble here but i'm gonna preach through it okay amen why don't we quit making excuses amen for why nobody shows up and start preaching the message amen why don't we quit making excuses well if i was so and so so and so would come to my meeting and if i was brother so and so amen so and so and so i defy that therefore in the name of jesus christ you want an attraction and then you own a crowd preach the message of the hour until eagles come together and begin to cut up in the presence of the living god you say brother andrew it ain't possible i've seen it happen i've seen preachers stand behind the pulpit and preach the message and watch the pillar of fire and then come down in the church amen and brewed over closed hearts and them hearts open up in the presence of god what are you saying i'm saying quit making excuses and start preaching the message [Applause] [Music] [Applause] this message has still got an attraction it's still got a pull are y'all hearing me it's still you know what this message will do this message will pull people together and it'll make police officers testify there's something real in this are y'all hearing me and then just a few days ago at home we had a tent meeting and then thursday night we got to cutting up a little bit we got to praising god and shouting amen there's a lot of noise going on amen time we got out of church the neighbors had been called the law on us about 500 amen holy rollers they've been shouting and dancing under an old-fashioned gospel tent and the neighbors called the police and the police come up and they said brother they come to brother sean they said sir we got a call there's too much noise here what's going on he said well we're just having a gospel meeting they said a gospel meeting and all these people here for a gospel meeting he said yeah we're just preaching the gospel and then the cops said where are they coming from he said well there's some here from louisiana he said you mean to tell me that people will drive all the way from louisiana they meant to sit in a gospel meeting brother sean said well they're here from louisiana and they're here from arkansas and they're here from texas and connecticut and arizona amen what was it that brought them together it wasn't who was there and who was preaching what night and who was singing what service it was the message of the hour and the age we're living in being preached in the power and the demonstration that god sent it to be preached in are y'all hearing me amen what are you talking about i'm saying preach the message and watch eagles come together amen they're going to wonder for a famine but they're going to come together for a feast the prophet said the churches are cooling off we might as well just face it they're getting worse and worse all the time more preaching is being done than ever before and less practice of what's being preached now amen now we're here we might as well preach hey we're here come on amen we're here we might as well deal with it amen great revival strike the country amen men come in anointed of the holy spirit and they preach with everything that's within them and the people walk right away as if nothing ever happened just unconcerned he said now there's got to be a reason for that he said and if you'll study you'll find we're living in the time that amos spoke of he meant a time of a famine now there is a law here of contrast that says brother matt if there is a famine somewhere amen there's got to be a feast somewhere amen if there's a sick person somewhere amen there's got to be a whale person somewhere if there's a bound person somewhere brother dale there's got to be a free person somewhere and i say this amen wheresoever the carcass is amen there will the eagles be gathered together oh come on church amen wherever the carcass is amen there the eagles will be gathered together it'll bring people from texas it'll bring people from helga it'll bring people from missouri amen and virginia amen together on a friday night in the house of god wherever the carcass is amen there the eagles will be gathered together you know when you got to worry about there not being eagle's hair is when the carcass ain't there you know when you got to worry about people not showing up is when the carcass ain't there if the carcass is not in the church you better be worried about people showing up but if you've given this message amen the preeminence of the pulpit and the preeminent to the pews you ain't got to worry about somebody showing up there'll be eagles here as long as there's fresh kill as long as their season meets and the hour that they're living in there'll be eagles show up about to explode up here where the carcasses and then somebody shout the carcass where the carcass is amen the man is which is the word there the eagles will be gathered together hey we're the carcasses amen there is where the eagles will be gathered together amen now now you just got to fellowship with me here on this thought for a minute even because there's a lot of preachers and then they get under an old complex and they want to beat the entire church down and say well there ain't nobody supporting us ain't nobody packing us ain't nope amen but let me say this amen nobody wants to hear amen a complex and nobody wants to hear bitterness and nobody wants to hear what brother so-and-so is doing to brother so-and-so on the other side of the world and nobody wants to hear about who heard who amen but there's some people that are hurting that wants to hear about a healer and i didn't come here this weekend he meant to preach a bunch of hurts and a bunch of confusion i come to tell you there's still fire in this message there's still deliverance in this message there's still a god who'll come down on a friday night and he'll meet a young girl we'll meet a young boy that'll give him an experience that'll keep him in treacherous waters it'll keep them in dangerous waters it'll keep them when the world is falling apart there'll be a young person that'll be anchored by the message of the hour i ain't backing up and i ain't backing down i ain't got time for nonsense there's an attraction here there's a carcass here there's an anointing here there's a living god here where the carcass is and then there the eagles will be gathered together not where opinions are where the carcass is not where personalities are where the carcass is amen not where everybody that agrees with you is amen where the carcass is well i'm gonna preach anyhow amen where the carcass is amen there the eagles will be gathered together now you know what's funny to me amen as people dismiss the carcass and they get a bunch of buzzards show up and then they get mad at the eagles for not showing up oh preaching now aren't we amen they get but let me just tell you this you're not going to draw an eagle by some dedication that's been laying in the church for 30 years and your security blanket won't let you turn it loose well let's just preach we're here we might as well amen well brother andrew brother branham said this and i don't amen that's a security blanket that you've been holding on to cause you don't want no emotion the church but don't you get rid of that thing tonight it's not got no power to draw people well you love the lord are you with me there's a message here there's an attraction here there's a there's there's a there's a word in due season brother bram says what is it the carcass amen where the carcass is there the eagles will be together we're the fresh kill is we're something that's not dead and stagnated but something that's fresh and got some life in it now what does the word attraction mean it means the action or the power of evoking interest it means pleasure or lacking for someone or something now think about this it is a quality or a feature that evokes interest lacking or desire i love this one brother braden it's a place which draws visitors by providing something a man of interest or pleasure are you ready for this it is a force under the influence of which an object am intends to move toward each other it's an example gravitational amen attraction amen think about that amen do you realize dolly parton is not standing at the gate of dollywood every day are you hearing me dolly parton's not standing there he meant signing autographs and now now don't get i'm not getting any amusement parks but just preach me for a second okay amen she's not standing there brother dale he met every day giving out a cup and signed picture amen but there's something in that theme park that's got the power he meant to draw people from all over the world amen to receive pleasure to receive interest they meant to invoke something in them or y'all hear me amen dolly parents not standing there they've been begging people to come to her stampede and then there's an attraction and there's something in the attraction that's got the power amen to pull the people to the attraction oh glory to god are you hearing me church there are different types of attractions there's natural attractions amen then there's spiritual attractions amen there's worldly attractions amen and there's godly attraction and the world has an attraction and the church has an attraction and god never intended somebody shout god never intended amen didn't know who's got me priest did you god never intended he meant for the world's attraction to be the church's attraction he never intended amen for the world's attraction ain't meant to be the church's attraction remember when the church loses its attraction when it comes to a time that you got to sign cards and things to come to church i think it's time for a prayer meeting i think it's time amen that something takes place in the church i'll tell you what i believe i believe when it comes to a time that the only time you show up is when your favorite preacher's in town it's time for a prayer meet i think that the only time you show up is on a special meeting i think it's time for a prayer meet i think it's time amen to fall down before god and say holy ghost amen light of fire inside of my soul it'll put a hunger and a thirst for the house of god when the church loses its attraction you might as well padlock the doors and cut off the power but well here it is again the church is becoming these days with its achievement like all of the man-made achievements he said is becoming scientific oh there we hit one didn't we i mean they don't want to preach the power of the message they want to preach some psychologist or some scientist idea but a prophet said they're trying they meant to make a scientific church by the attraction of pictures and great steeples and it's too bad that pentecost amen god in that rut are you ready for this you would be better off with a tambourine amen down on the corner and the spirit of god around you come on brother sister are you hearing me hey man i studied the other day brother ben and then i heard a quote where the prophet of god said amen we're like a bunch of cows ain't been over in a barn they've been kicking our heels up and having a holy ghost time you know why you gotta almost you almost got to pay your kid to go to science class cause there's no life in there you know why you gotta beg them ain't meant to go to school it's cause there's no life in there there's no sustaining power there's no joy in a dry-eyed lesson amen but you know why we're not going to turn the house of god into a scientific bunch of dried connections it's because there's no life in it well come on church amen take the fire of the church you've taken the attraction out of the church take the holy ghost down the church you've taken the power out of the church but if we just come together and we forget who is who and we forget where we come from and we forget what we're doing and we remember jesus said brother harvey if i will i will draw all men unto myself when we come together to lift up jesus amen eagles will come together and eaglets will be born around the attraction amen why you feel like dancing cause i just happen to feel like i'm in the presence of some eagles i just feel like i'm in the presence of some eagles now your servant andrew what is their drawing card science has become the drawing card of denomination what the prophet said amen but god's drawing card has never changed somebody shout never changed what is god's drawing card the gospel yet in its simplicity is the greatest drawing card the world has ever known jesus said if i be lifted up i will draw all men unto me are you ready amen black white yellow brown whatever their color race is the gospel still holds the center of attraction to every man and every woman isn't that beautiful it'll draw the black man it'll draw the white man it'll draw the red man it'll draw the yellow man oh mercy one message we'll draw every color one message will draw every nation one message hallelujah i tell you brother joel amen one time i was in now can i share something i said a barbershop one time and a guy come in and he said now i'm a methodist he was a he was a white man he come in he said i'm a methodist and i began to talk to him for a minute and he started talking about what the methodists believed and they believed this and they believed that and they believed this and said i'm a methodist i said okay well another gentleman come in who was a black gentleman he'd come in and sit down i said what are you and he said well i'm a methodist he said but i'm an ame methodist i said what's that mean he said well there's the there's the united methodist he said then there's ame message he said the united methodist is predominantly white he said the ame is predominantly black i said you mean to tell me that there ain't enough power in what you're all what you all are preaching that you can't even get together in the same building was that okay i said you mean to tell me you got to have a black methodist and a white man for this and you're going to have a black pentecostal come on church amen that's not what the gospel come to produce the gospel comes amen to bring the black man together to bring the red men together to bring the alamance together until they all come together and lift up the man who is jesus christ the son of the living god i say church lift him up tonight lift him up tonight lift him above the division lift him above the problems lift him above the confusion there is power in the attraction to bring together divisions are you hearing me amen the gospel still holds the attraction to every man and every woman i think we're trying to look too much to see what somebody else done or said instead of looking forward to christ he is our leader oh brother ben he is our leader now now people actually say whether they say the gospel has lost its attraction but i'll tell you what the prophet said he said people tries to say the gospel lost its attraction he said when people come from across the nation to stand in a place where their limbs are hurting amen for a service of the lord it still shows that god's got people and there's still a longing in their heart to see god amen can i can i testify amen here for a moment about a family in this church tonight amen look at that look at the savage family here tonight amen lost brother harvey amen but here's a grandson amen and a son and a family in the house of god you know why because brother harvey's attraction was the gospel and he didn't let it lose an attraction and it become the attraction of his children and his grandchildren amen that family in this building tonight is a testimony there's still a hunger in the hearts of people that no matter what they're going through and no matter what they're facing they just know if i get in the presence of the attraction something is going to happen if i just get in the presence of the attraction ain't that it'll release something in me that nobody else can give me glory the gospel has not lost its attraction what is the gospel it was so important that god said go into all the world and preach the attraction and then preach the gospel what is the gospel the gospel is the good news oh brother josh the gospel is the good news amen not the word only amen but the power and the demonstration of the spirit paul said not not swelled words and enchanting lips and doxology and apostles creed i never come to you like that i come in the resurrection and demonstration of the holy ghost see then let me say this the gospel is making his word come to pass see we have many creeds amen but there is one gospel we have many ideas but there is one gospel it is god making his word amen come to pass then jesus emphatically screamed out going into all the world amen and make seminaries no sir build churches no sir build hospitals no sir they was commissioned amen to preach the word and to preach the gospel amen go into all the world are you ready and demonstrate the power of the resurrection amen time out here for a second that's why they got a bunch of irelands around this message that's afraid of an altar call they're afraid of a prayer line they're afraid to get down there and say bring whatever condition you got we're going to stand here and we're going to pray till that thing breaks you know why because they're a scientific preacher with a bunch of scientific up knowledge but i say what we need tonight is the holy ghost in the power and the demonstration of his word now let me say this you're looking at one preacher that's not afraid to take god in his word are you hear me i'm not afraid amen to take god in his word i've stood in foreign countries and preached this message and seen the god that called me to preach it come on the scene to back it up i have stood in prayer lines and seen demons raised up out of vessels and seen god come on the scene and cast out those demons what are you saying preacher i'm saying if this attraction is worth preaching it's worth giving the people an opportunity to experience [Applause] come on church if this message is worth preaching it's worth having a prayer line for i said if this message is worth talking about it's worth opening the altar up and let young people come and receive a good old-fashioned boast of the holy ghost prescription until sin and bitterness and complexes and holds of the enemy is eradicated out of their lives and they stand in the presence of the sun free free indeed see there's something about this message it is the attraction and we're not afraid to put it in the ground are you hearing me we are not afraid amen to plant this message in the ground to the heart of the individual the prophet said i read in life magazine where they took oh god come on he said where they took a handful of seed out of the garners of joseph of wheat and they planted it in the ground and it growed and he said they got a they got a sunflower seed 4 000 years ago out of old king touched tomb and a sunfire seed planted and god had preserved that life though the skin worms amen destroys this body yet in my flesh shall i see god he said god's word will never be destroyed let's say that together god's word will never be destroyed god's word if you'll plant it in the right kind of a condition on god's word are you ready it will do the same thing that it did at the beginning if you just plant it in the heart of the individual amen brother john that message that seed will produce exactly what it produced in the beginning amen but let me say this man is trying to turn things towards nothing but beauty so beauty has become another drawing card to denomination well he said they did he said the old church the overcomers he said they didn't have beautiful buildings and gown choirs and find clothes and other worldly attractions he said but now in this special promise to the true believers god has declared he will give them rewards of great beauty and eternal duration see so the old the old believers the overcomers the how can i say this the children of god that have run the race before us they were not drawn to beauty they were not drawn to science they were drawn to the supernatural element of the living god now the prophet said and then after the decision i speak in here of a conference with god and he's going to show you that when attractions are made they're actually designed he meant to catch the attention of the human spirit so amen so so when the human spirit gets low amen they're designed to lift it up right amen when the human spirit gets nervous they're designed to bring a peace to it now do you realize the world we live in is full of attractions amen now now some families amen are drawn to amusement parks for their vacations i'm not telling you just just listen to me okay and i know brother come to my time he said i don't want people listen i don't know where you feel that to go get between you and the lord and your pastor in church hey man i'm just trying to make a point here okay can we all agree but andrew's just trying to make a point some people are drawn to to the ocean some are drawn to the mountains they've been summer drawn amen i get in trouble here amen they've been summer drawn to go look at history like my wife amen now i like history they meant but there's one back there so you're not myself are you hearing me amen but but listen there's something there that pulls that human spirit to it see when you go the ocean you don't do one thing for the ocean amen the ocean does it for you when you go to the mountains you don't do one thing for the mountains amen the mountains does it for you when you go to the amusement park you don't do one thing for that amusement park the amusement park does it for you when you go read about the battle a minute for it wherever amen that don't do no you don't do nothing for it amen it does something for you are y'all hear me tonight amen there's something in there that contacts your human spirit and draws you to it and the prophet said like this he said when they plan to have a conference they're always trying to find someplace beautiful he said like the geneva conference and paris and different places he said what is it he said if it's peaceful and attractive it seems to work on the human spirit notice this many times for myself i like to climb a mountain and watch a sunset that just thrills me it looks like all my differences is settled in the presence of my attraction that's a shouting point right there he didn't do nothing for those mountains but when he got in the presence of the mountains the mountains released an atmosphere that caused all of his differences to be settled the mountains released an atmosphere that brought a peace upon his heart what are you saying brother andrew i'm saying just get in the presence of the attraction and it will settle the differences are you hearing me just get in the present to the attraction you don't have to put nothing in it amen you don't have to put something in it to give you peace you don't have to put something in it to give you a release this attraction will bring a peace over your family brother andrew i don't think you know what you're talking about well you've come too late to tell me that because i've stood in message churches i've spent a message church and preached this message and seen a mother at odds with a daughter and both of them end up at the altar at the end of the service even with their arms around each other they've been hugging each other's neck you know what done it the preaching of the message which is the attraction see then this evening friends the new birth amen will actually change what you are attracted to and it will quicken an understanding of why you're there [Music] now what was it what was it mean to be drawn it meant to be led by what an inward power now the prophet comes along in the church age book and says we did not become seed by the rebirth oh i heard brother brown preaching spoken words original see the other day he got secured away in the scriptures he went i'm about to leave here amen we did not become seed amen by the rebirth we were seed and therefore were reborn for only the elect can be reborn are you ready because we were seed is the reason we could be quickened because in non-seed there is nothing to quicken because in seed there was something that could be quickened because in non-seed there is nothing to be quickened see then you can be in the presence of the attraction but unless you have been quickened it'll have no effect on you all right now i'm gonna preach it for a second unless you've been quickened it'll have no it'll make no difference upon your life but if you've been quickened amen by a seed then that seed inside of you was not placed there by your mama was not placed there by your father was not placed there by your preacher it wasn't placed there when you heard the first tape as a young girl amen that seed was placed there by the attraction himself that makes me want to dance the seed amen was placed there by the attraction himself therefore when the attraction would become manifested you wouldn't have to wonder what is the attraction on the mountain there would be something in you that would be testified of what it is when nobody else understood it there would be something in a young boy in a young girl in a man and a woman that would say that is our lord up there now now don't put the brakes on me let me preach this okay in matthew 21 you realize what kind of day it was you know what kind of day it was it was a weary it was a nervous and an unusual day for the people were preparing for the passover amen this was jesus final visit oh god brother matt think about all the times that jesus had come into that part of town but this was a different time amen this was his final visit are you ready the next was his death are you hearing me and he knew everything that was before him so what does jesus do the prophet said how many can raise in and say thank god for a prophet thank god for elijah who could go back and could accurately describe the scene to where you actually felt like you were sitting there brother harvey watching it unfold before your very eyes he says jesus is standing on the mountain looking over jerusalem now do you realize what there was in that day there was a religious class of people that the prophet said they actually hated jesus but but in the middle of all that are you ready brother matt there was some non-seed down there that had not been quickened that hated jesus but there was some seed was some seed down there that was quickened amen and they loved his appearing the prophet said in the midst of all that through every age and every prophet that has ever been or would be there is going to be are you ready somebody said there is going to be say it was some attitude a certain amount of people that's predestinated to hear that message are you ready for this they won't just hear it brother joel they'll follow it [Applause] it just won't make him shout it'll make him give everything they've got to it there will be a bride on the earth that will hear the message she'll believe the message and she'll follow the message now are you ready what they'll do can i tell you what that little predestinated group will do he said they'll ignore the crowds now don't don't take that amen and try to turn that quote and say well ignore all the big groups no they'll ignore the crowds they'll ignore the criticism of the unbeliever they'll have no argument with him they've got one thing to do and that is belief [Music] oh somebody give god some praise in the house of god they'll ignore the crowds they'll ignore the criticism they'll ignore the voice of the critics because they've got one job to do that is to worship and to believe on he whom god has sent preacher what are you saying i'll make it as plain as i can i'm not concerned about what others are doing i've got one job to do let's preach this message are you hearing me amen as a amen as a 16 year old boy can i share something personal with you amen as a 16 year old boy i was there between this voice saying go this way and this voice saying go that way and this voice saying preach this and we'll back you to no end amen but i met god on the sacred sands and he commissioned me he meant to do one thing and that is preach this message and as long as andrew glover has got breath in his lungs and strengthen his bones i'll do everything i can to preach this message till every young man can know it'll make a clean living holy ghost failed fire baptized witness of the resurrection out of them i'm not a crazy man i'm committed to believe this message there was a seed in me that was quickened to preach this message to believe this message to live this message to follow this message thank you jesus now now i just tell you this sometimes people get a little bit bothered at you and they say why are you doing certain things and why are you why are you going certain places and why are you preaching certain amen can i can i tell you why man called me one time he said now i want to know why you're preaching so and so places while you're going there and why you're doing this i said okay i got one question for you brother you tell me one thing that them people's done that disqualified them from hearing the gospel you tell me one thing they've done that disqualifies them at a chance of hearing the gospel i said until you come up with an exqualification that disqualifies me amen from preaching the gospel every time i get a chance in that pulpit i'll preach the gospel [Music] well i'll bump something there but i'll bump right through it this ain't a bunch of politics and a bunch of who's going where and who's preaching this is about somebody they've been hearing the gospel and the resurrection of the jesus christ that loves them and died for them and cares for them and as long as there's a door open i'll preach this message and as long as the church is open you ought to be back in this message hope this is okay he told me to take my liberty i'm done playing games it's this message or it's nothing either we're going to forget about what's going on here and there and preach this message or we might as well be at the coffee shop drinking coffee tonight this is not a church house it's just not a playhouse this is god's house [Applause] this is a place where seeds are quickened this is the place now now now you've got to realize amen that that criticism and those unbelievers were distractions you know now this is real deep okay are you ready for it the opposite of an attraction is a distraction i thought that went up all of my own the opposite of an attraction is a distraction see in luke 10 the bible talks about mary and martha and the 40th verse it says but martha was cumbered she was cumbered about much servant and she came to him and said lord does thou not care that my siste left me to serve alone been her therefore to help me now notice what martha was doing martha was serving but she was distracted she was serving but she was distracted you know what that word comfort means brother josh it means to draw away it means to be driven about mentally now i don't i don't have much time amen to stop here we'll get bogged down okay but let me just let you in a little secret it's actually a message called the present stage of my ministry that a prophet begins to talk about complexes and in there he says i built the complexes if you heard that if you heard that i'm not making that up am i i built the complexes see the devil supplied the bricks but brother branham did the building and he said the whole time here i was preaching and serving amen and i let god's sick children lay amen because of a complex so there can be people who are full of a complex and still be servant and not be serving in the perfect will of god now let me just take some liberty here amen amen just because you're serving don't mean you're actually serving the attraction sometimes you can be serving a distraction to the attraction oh is that okay are you hearing me it's not that brother man wasn't serving he was working under a complex i don't come on well for he said it about himself it means to be busy about a thing notice this and the prophet says there are so many emotions and thanks to distract us from the spirit today paul is actually going to come along and he's going to say brother harvey this i speak for your own prophet not that i may cast a snare upon you but for that which is comely are you ready and that you may attend upon the lord without distraction brother braden to think that a prophet of god is going to pick this up and say so many are distracted by the emotions and the spirit of today now watch this that word attend means to sit constantly by and to be devoted to to be distracted without distraction means without solicitude or anxiety or care so god is looking amen i'm not going to preach all night okay but god is looking for people who will attend upon him without anxiety and without care now now i've i've actually brother matt seen people come in prayer lines and said they want deliverance of nervousness and they want deliverance and anxiety and they want deliverance from this and they get prayed for and they go back out and they feed on everything that has no power to give them deliverance over that thing [Music] well i'm going to preach anyhow are you hearing me amen well i i want the leverage but they're feeding on this book and they're feeding on this tv series and they're feeding on this vacation and they're feeding on this i'll tell you what if you really want deliverance over something and you really want it you'll feed on what gives you the power to overcome what is bringing your spirit low i tell you what if i was battling a nervous devil you know what i'd do i'd go home tonight and i'd

are you with me now you're sitting there and you're saying well that's for brother so-and-so and that's for sister so and so and the prophet said the devil almost robbed that man of his healing because he was thinking it was for somebody else he said and when i said that a real funny feeling come over you real sweet and warm if that's right wave your hand like this he said another place i seen a man i believe it was down here the other night in the meeting the holy spirit i've been watching him when i was preaching he was a crippled man he had crutches under his arms and just when i started to make the call satan come to the man a black shadow and i watched it with my own eyes he got up and walked out he'll always be crippled see see oh my i guess he just listened to the enemy i guess he just listened to the enemy but jesus said my sheep know my voice and the stranger they will not follow see what the prophet said are you ready for this have you ever been through something

through and they're not ashamed salem they meant to lift up holy hands and to give praise what are you talking about if the church could only see that it's not what you're going to be it's what you already are [Music] are you hearing me if the devil is the devil trying to rob you from that now now it's not the spirit of god that would dispute the word of god the spirit of god keeps the word now

you say lander what are you talking about uh i i i'm just gonna preach today i ain't gonna read it to you okay he said there come jesus he's been riding into town up on the phone of a cult on the back of a donkey come riding in the town you realize what he said he said there was two classes of people there he said one amen had been taught they had been schooled they had been trained you know what he called it it's actually in this day the scripture is fulfilled he called it this ecclesiastical froze up they was ecclesiastical froze up jesus come riding into town and there were some of them that were moved now here's what i get brother ben everybody was moved you know what that word move means that word move means agitated of the mind everybody was moved amen but one was moved to criticize and another was moved to priests one was moved to criticize and another was moved to priests you know what the bible says the bible says and they picked up the palm branches and they spread their clothes and they begin to say bless it amen is he that cometh in the name of the lord and the prophet said some of them cried out and said who is this they said what meaneth all this noise why is all this commotion are you hearing me but listen church they were drew to jerusalem they were drawn to jerusalem to witness the fulfilling of the promised word of the age that i have five minutes they was drawn it's friday night they even got the honky conks cranked up yet they were drawn amen brother to jerusalem to witness the fulfillment of the promised word of the age they was living in and the prophet said it was a nervous day he said it was a tension day he said on the top of mount olives come a little white donkey walking down the hill are you ready for this with a group of people fanatically screaming i know some of these people on their feet right now is getting on your nerves but won't you join us amen amen fanatically screaming they were fanatically praising god [Applause] brother ben they were fanatically they've been pulling palm branches they've been off the trees they were fanatically throwing their clothes in the road they've been screaming hosanna to the son of david that comes in the name of the lord and this little mule his rider was none other than god's anointed messiah of the hour god being what was he doing what is the attraction up here on the hill it's god making history and god fulfilling prophecy and that always even causes an attraction can i drive this home it always causes an attraction do you realize in genesis 3 was the first time matthew 21 was referenced yeah thy seed shall bruise the head of the serpent and thy seed shall bruise his heal brother john when you read that what does it tell you there's a messiah coming does he give you a description of how he's going to come no let's give you all the details no but it's the first link in the chain of prophecy leading to the promise fulfillment in matthew 21 then zechariah come along oh i don't have time to connect all the messianic prophecies between genesis and matthew 21 amen but zechariah come along and he described it to the detail he said when he comes into jerusalem there will be shoutings there will be noise there will be rejoicing there will be screaming there will be hollering because her king is coming to her there was some who read genesis 3 who read zechariah 9 and they were standing there in matthew 21 and you know what they said who is this but there was some there who was magnetized they was already ready brother joel they already had the palm branches in their hand they were standing at attention to give their king a fit reception now you know what a lot of people want to say they want to say we can have church without a lot of noise but i defy that devil in the name of jesus christ [Applause] brother andrew you can't prove that where god fulfills his word there's always a bunch of noise how many was here before church how many heard that portion that tape amen two spots out of this day this scripture is fulfilled how many heard him say consider this on the ohio river in 1933 as i was baptizing he meant 500 people amen a whirlwind come out of heaven and spoke are you ready brother says some stayed and some ran he said the ones who stayed heard what he had to say and he said as john the baptist was sent to foreign the first coming of christ your message will forerun the second coming of christ and what does he say this day this scripture is fulfilled and what happens the church don't get quiet [Applause] oh god the church don't get all shut up they begin to praise god you know what jeffersonville put on that tape they put this in the comments and the church rejoiced greatly the church rejoiced greatly oh come on church what was the attraction in matthew 21 it was the manifestation of the son of god what is the attraction in black rock arkansas what is the attraction in hardy arkansas what is the attraction over in worth arkansas i'll tell you what the attraction is it's god fulfilling his word that day it was the manifested sun s-o-n but in this day the attraction is the manifested sons [Music] god somebody say god fulfilling his word the attraction has changed from the prophet to the come prophecy preach what is drawing a church full of people together tonight come on come on the attraction of the message [Music] of the hour what are you saying preacher thank you jesus god vindicating a prophet's message here's what is drawn brother the attraction of the people mount calvary the prophecy of the old testament is being fulfilled right there at calvary at that time david sing psalms about it yeah and the psalms david sang was being fulfilled right before his eyes what was the attraction on mount calvary it was god fulfilling in your ears as the musicians are coming another attraction was on the mountain was on the day of pentecost when all them was up there in the religious feast it was all a bunch of fanatics take this devil and they had heard from them in 10 days and all of a sudden like a beehive yeah they broke out of the top of the building out into the streets a screaming and carrying on [Music] what is this what manifests are all these men drunk watch and the prophet stood up among them as the order of a prophet should be and said ye men of israel these are not drunk as you suppose this is that that was spoken by the prophet joel the religious people after crucifying the prince of life and everything still didn't see the promise of the coming of the holy spirit and it's the same way today he says the same thing has taken place the same question is asked what's all the racket look up and down the street cars from michigan to florida from maine to california he said look at it license plates with my wife on the way out this morning and i thought of this text what means just as it says i said to my wife honey do you remember the last time i had to say everything on earth and going to the fields is what god had said to do and you sing that song they'll come from the east and the west they'll come from the lands of far to feast with our king to die in his guest how blessed these pilgrims are behold in his hallowed face and glow with the divine with love divine blessed partakers of his grace as jim's and his crown will shine are you ready for this that's what the attraction is you got your ears open the predestinated seed of god who can't do nothing else but follow it it means more than life to us take our lives but don't you take that take our lives but don't you touch this message what is the attraction god fulfilling his word thank you lord do you love him this evening won't you stand your feet with us oh my thank you oh my what is it it's a last day happening it's god fulfilling his word you know what it is it's the sounds of freedom but that all that shouting you hear on that tape it's the sounds of people that have been
