[38:11] thou has set up the Lord would add his
[38:14] Blessing to the word you may be seated
[38:16] this
[38:18] morning when Nebuchadnezzar destroyed
[38:21] Jerusalem because of their
[38:23] sin and God allowed him to the king to
[38:26] fall into his hands the the city to fall
[38:29] into his hands he brought back literally
[38:31] thousands of Jews to Babylon the Bible
[38:35] says in 2 Kings 24:14 that he carried
[38:38] away all
[38:39] Jerusalem all the princes and all the
[38:42] Mighty Men of Valor even 10,000 captives
[38:46] all the Craftsmen and Smiths none
[38:49] remained save the poorest sort of the
[38:51] people of the land all the men of might
[38:54] even 7,000 and and Craftsmen and Smiths
[38:57] a thousand all that were strong and apt
[39:00] for war even them the king of Babylon
[39:03] brought captive to Babylon so it was
[39:06] literally thousands of people that were
[39:09] brought back at that time and I want to
[39:12] state to you this morning that you said
[39:14] brother Ben well the devil's out to get
[39:16] me well there's a reason he's out to get
[39:18] you it's because you are valuable in his
[39:21] sight as you're valuable in God's sight
[39:23] the devil sees how valuable you are to
[39:27] the kingdom of God and so he wants to
[39:29] take you out of the kingdom of God and
[39:31] make you work for him and so the more he
[39:34] attacks you you might as well just look
[39:36] at that as a badge of honor and say well
[39:38] you know I'm glad that the devil thinks
[39:40] so much of me that he would attack me
[39:41] like that and God would allow him to do
[39:43] that so it must be something that God
[39:46] thinks about me I must be pretty high on
[39:48] his list I believe we are this morning I
[39:50] believe we're the children of of God now
[39:54] and so these uh people were brought in
[39:56] to B it was an attempt to conquer a
[39:59] people not by force alone but by
[40:02] assimilation and we talked a little bit
[40:04] about that Wednesday night brother
[40:05] brandom taught us that the squeeze this
[40:07] hour would not be uh coming down on us
[40:10] uh in a way of uh of of material things
[40:14] though though that might happen from
[40:15] time to time but that wouldn't be the
[40:17] main squeeze in this time but the main
[40:20] thing would be that we would actually
[40:23] the devil would try to tell us what it
[40:24] doesn't matter anymore these little
[40:26] Loose Ends just they don't matter and so
[40:29] that's what this was it was an attempt
[40:30] by assimilation to actually bring them
[40:33] in bring them to Babylon make them
[40:35] Babylonian in their mindset make them
[40:37] make them Babylonian in their speech
[40:39] make them Babylonian in their worship
[40:41] and then when and then when you can make
[40:42] them remake them in your own image then
[40:44] you put them back in the land what have
[40:46] you got another bunch of Babylonians
[40:47] that's exactly what the devil has done
[40:49] through seven Church ages with
[40:51] denominationalism he didn't he didn't
[40:53] come in and say well Christianity wasn't
[40:55] true he tried that and it didn't work so
[40:57] what did he do he come into Christianity
[40:59] and attempted to make the church in a
[41:01] Babylonian religion and actually return
[41:04] it back to that now so it's the same
[41:06] thing now the idea to bring them back to
[41:09] Babylon and then to return them to their
[41:10] native land as Babylonians as
[41:13] representatives of that yeah but in
[41:15] Daniel chapter 1 and verse three we're
[41:17] taught that again he says the king spake
[41:20] to Ash panaz the master of his Unix he
[41:22] should bring certain of his he should
[41:26] bring certain of the children of is of
[41:27] the king seed and of the princes
[41:29] children in whom was no blemish well
[41:32] favored skillful in all wisdom cunning
[41:34] in knowledge understanding science and
[41:36] such as had ability in them to stand in
[41:39] the king's Palace I believe we have that
[41:40] kind of ability this
[41:42] morning God called you in this age
[41:44] because you have the ability to stand in
[41:46] the king's Palace and whom they might
[41:48] teach the learning in the tongue of the
[41:50] caldan he wanted them as trophies of the
[41:53] Triumph of Babylon over Israel he would
[41:57] have them as actually trophies of his
[42:00] Triumph that they would be living uh
[42:02] trophies he could he could look in his
[42:04] throne room and he could see that they
[42:05] were there and he could see well I
[42:07] conquered Jerusalem and the proof that
[42:09] I'm the Conqueror is these people serve
[42:12] me now and that's exactly what he wants
[42:14] to do young people he wants to take you
[42:16] out of the house of God and set you up
[42:18] as a trophy of Satan's Eden but I'll say
[42:20] this we've already become trophies of
[42:22] the grace of the Living God we don't
[42:24] need to be trophies of the enemy you're
[42:26] a trophy of God's grace right are you
[42:30] with me so far yes now he said among
[42:33] these were of the children of Judah
[42:35] Daniel haniah Michelle and
[42:38] Azariah unto whom the prince of the Unix
[42:41] gave names for he gave unto Daniel the
[42:43] name of belto AAR and to haniah of
[42:46] Shadrach to Mel of Meek to Azariah of
[42:51] abedo they were changing their
[42:54] identity changing their name to change
[42:58] their identity so that no one would hear
[43:01] their name and think they were
[43:04] Jews right they could blend into the
[43:06] call God you see what the devil's trying
[43:08] to do today he's trying to make make the
[43:10] church or even the bride like everybody
[43:13] else so no one would hear and think they
[43:15] were Jews now because if you got a name
[43:17] like Daniel or if you got a name like uh
[43:20] you got a name like hananiah people
[43:22] thought well that's a Jew but when you
[43:24] had a name like belto shazar or Shadrach
[43:27] put on them the names of his
[43:29] Gods so now uh he changed your
[43:32] identities but Daniel I love this Daniel
[43:35] 18 He purposed in his heart that he
[43:38] would not defile himself with the
[43:41] portion of the king's meat nor with the
[43:43] wine which he drank therefore he
[43:45] requested of the prince of the Unix that
[43:47] he might not defile himself and and and
[43:50] listen to me this morning if you have a
[43:52] purpose in your heart to do the right
[43:55] thing to follow the word God Will Make A
[43:58] Way for that to happen in your life if
[44:01] you really purpose in Your Heart Lord I
[44:03] want to be in the house of God now
[44:04] you'll be tested on that but God Will
[44:07] Make A Way for that to happen you say
[44:09] why why do you say that brother the man
[44:10] because he's done it for me and he
[44:12] promised to do it right he did it for
[44:15] Daniel and the way that he did that with
[44:16] Daniel is he gave him favor with the
[44:19] king's man he gave him favor with the
[44:21] king's man just like he may have given
[44:22] you favor with a manager or favor with a
[44:25] boss or favor with an owner of a company
[44:27] he gave you favor so that you could be
[44:28] in the house of God he gave you favor so
[44:30] that you could work and provide for your
[44:32] family God does that for us but yet we
[44:37] know that he puts us to the test to see
[44:39] if we're going to stick with it or not
[44:41] right now and so in Daniel 11:17 it says
[44:45] as for these four children four children
[44:48] young people at the time that would grow
[44:50] up and God gave them knowledge and skill
[44:54] and all learning and wisdom and Daniel
[44:56] had understanding ing in visions and
[44:58] dreams now Daniel was a prophet the
[45:00] other three were not but they beli what
[45:02] a prophet had to say and they followed a
[45:05] prophet in his stand for the word of God
[45:07] and I say we're doing the same thing
[45:09] today so in Daniel 1:19 it says the king
[45:12] communed with them and and you know you
[45:14] remember they fed them their everybody
[45:16] else got the wine and the King's meat
[45:18] and and Daniel and his friends they got
[45:20] they got pul they got uh basically
[45:22] vegetables is what they got and water
[45:24] and but when the time come he found uh
[45:27] that among all them all was found none
[45:29] like Daniel haniah Misha and Azariah
[45:32] therefore stood they before the king so
[45:34] out of these thousands that were brought
[45:36] out of the land of of Israel there was
[45:39] just four that that had an impact that
[45:41] made a difference listen the elect is
[45:43] not everybody out there not even
[45:44] everybody that claims to believe the
[45:46] message is elect but you and I have been
[45:48] called to something higher something
[45:50] different and we've been called to stand
[45:52] before the king and so there's got to be
[45:55] something in our lives where're hel to a
[45:57] higher standard but we've been enabled
[45:59] to do that because God has put that in
[46:02] us we're the elected of God you see
[46:03] election in this now he said therefore
[46:06] stood they before the King Daniel 120
[46:08] and in all matters of wisdom and
[46:10] understanding that the king inquired of
[46:12] them he found them 10 times better than
[46:14] all the magicians and astrologers that
[46:16] were in all his
[46:18] Realms they must have felt pretty good
[46:20] brother Wes that we made
[46:23] it we made it Kings appointed us we're
[46:27] young people man we've just raised up
[46:29] above all this man we're doing good you
[46:31] better watch out when you're doing good
[46:33] that's when your test comes yeah when
[46:36] everything seems like it's going right
[46:37] that's when your test comes you better
[46:39] look out they say the time to prepare
[46:41] for war is during a time of Peace that's
[46:44] the time you should be training for
[46:46] battle Yeah because you know if there's
[46:48] peace now there's war coming so the
[46:51] devil's always going to put you to the
[46:53] test and God's going to allow you to be
[46:55] put to the test because the gold that
[46:57] you are the deity that's been manifested
[47:00] in your life has got to be put to the
[47:03] fire right to manifest and to disclose
[47:06] what it is now it's already gold right
[47:09] you're you it's already in you the deity
[47:11] is already in you but it's got to be put
[47:13] to the fire you say why have I been
[47:15] through what I've been through in my
[47:16] life why did I have to make some of the
[47:18] mistakes that I made the gold that was
[47:20] in you had to be put through the fire
[47:22] and God already knew what was in you but
[47:24] you needed to know what was in you
[47:27] and the Hebrew children would never
[47:29] understand that they could face a fiery
[47:31] furnace until they faced one and they
[47:33] didn't give in they might have surprised
[47:36] even themselves that they had the
[47:37] courage to stand but there was something
[47:39] in them that wouldn't let them fall and
[47:41] I believe there's something in you today
[47:43] that will not let you fall yes sir thank
[47:45] you Lord
[47:46] amen there's always a
[47:49] test the the trial of our faith Peter
[47:52] tells us in 1 Peter 1:7 being much more
[47:55] precious than of gold that perisheth
[47:58] though it be tried with fire might be
[48:00] found un praise and honor and Glory at
[48:03] the appearing of Jesus Christ brother B
[48:06] said the gold of God is a Christlike
[48:09] character produced in the fiery furnace
[48:12] of Affliction I love that that's the
[48:15] right kind of gold a fiery a Christlike
[48:18] character produced in the fiery furnace
[48:22] of
[48:22] Affliction in in chapter two of Daniel
[48:25] Daniel interprets Nebuchadnezzar's dream
[48:28] he talks to him about the dream and he
[48:30] he has the dream remember of the Gentile
[48:32] kingdoms and the image the image and he
[48:36] interprets that dream and we're we're
[48:38] told at the end of that chapter that
[48:41] Nebuchadnezzar changes his worship but
[48:45] you know he's idolatrous in his
[48:48] thinking he's idolatrous in his thinking
[48:51] and because of that instead of
[48:53] worshiping God he worships Daniel yeah
[48:57] right and an idolator in their thinking
[48:59] can never see beyond the man they always
[49:02] worship the man instead of worshiping
[49:05] God because because even though he saw
[49:07] what Daniel could do he didn't give
[49:09] glory to God now watch what he did and
[49:11] the King Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his
[49:13] face and worshiped Daniel and commanded
[49:17] that they should offer an ablation and
[49:19] sweet odors unto him and the King
[49:21] answered unto Daniel and said of a truth
[49:23] it is that your God is a god of gods and
[49:26] a lord of kings and a revealer of
[49:28] Secrets seeing that thou couldst reveal
[49:30] this secret then then the king made
[49:32] Daniel a great man I'm sure the king
[49:34] probably said well we're not worshiping
[49:36] Daniel we're just honoring Daniel but
[49:38] his attitude towards Daniel was one of
[49:41] worship not just of respect yeah right
[49:44] and there's a line there we need to
[49:45] respect God's men yeah but we don't
[49:47] worship God's men we worship God alone
[49:51] so he had crossed that line and the
[49:53] Catholic Church will tell you today we
[49:55] don't worship Mary we just generate her
[49:57] and honor her as the mother of Christ
[49:59] why do you pray to her
[50:00] then well we don't worship brother
[50:02] Brandon but why why is it that no one
[50:04] else can
[50:06] preach right the truth is you've crossed
[50:09] over the line right from from from be
[50:12] from being a person that that honors a
[50:14] man to and respects the messenger of the
[50:16] age and believes what he said to cross
[50:18] over into
[50:20] worship so now watch now he said the
[50:23] king made Daniel a great man gave him
[50:25] many great gifts and made him ruler over
[50:27] the whole province of Babylon chief of
[50:29] the governors over all the wise men of
[50:32] Babylon now brother brand said when he
[50:34] become a great man now watch King
[50:36] Nebuchadnezzar made an image of gold and
[50:38] set it up out in the field and said that
[50:40] everybody would have to bow to that
[50:41] image he said did you ever notice the
[50:43] innocence of it who that image was made
[50:46] of it was Daniel the image of a man and
[50:49] didn't he say the spirits of the Gods
[50:50] Heathen you realize he took that from
[50:52] Daniel's message from the interpretation
[50:54] of the dream he makes an image of of
[50:56] gold yeah he tried oh my with a carnal
[51:00] understanding of the message he produces
[51:02] idolatry right now watch what he does he
[51:05] says and it said everybody would have to
[51:06] B he said you noce the innocence of it
[51:08] it was Daniel the image of a man and
[51:10] didn't he say the spirits of the Gods
[51:12] Heathen as we are today he said we got
[51:14] three or four of them the spirits of
[51:15] gods Liv in him and they made an image
[51:16] to Daniel and he said all that won't
[51:18] make bow of that image will be thrown in
[51:20] the fiery furnace he said you notice
[51:22] Daniel is off the scene at that time now
[51:25] Daniel was still alive in the time that
[51:27] this was done but he was off the scene
[51:29] he'd been sent away on business or
[51:30] something else he wasn't there so now uh
[51:34] again he said he made an image and it's
[51:35] believed by Scholars he said which I do
[51:37] believe that a Spirit-filled person
[51:38] would see it he worshiped Daniel is what
[51:40] he did and he made an image to Daniel
[51:42] and he called it belto shazar he called
[51:45] Daniel I don't know if I'm saying that
[51:47] right but I guess it don't matter
[51:48] because you don't know either
[51:50] right if somebody does let me know later
[51:53] not right now brother Joel
[51:54] later he called d
[51:57] Bel I can't even say it belshazzar which
[52:00] was the name of his God and he made an
[52:03] image and forced every person to worship
[52:07] that image right he said I want you to
[52:09] notice that at the beginning of the
[52:11] Gentiles when God dealt with them so
[52:13] this is the beginning of the Gentile
[52:15] dispensation because he said
[52:16] Nebuchadnezzar you're that head of gold
[52:18] remember this the beginning of the god
[52:20] beginning to deal with the Gentiles
[52:22] while the while the Jewish age was still
[52:24] going on but God's beginning to deal
[52:26] with the Gentiles as it Blended one into
[52:28] the other watch he said he said I want
[52:31] you to notice that the beginning of the
[52:33] Gentiles when God dealt with them they
[52:34] got hotti in their heart and forced
[52:36] every man to worship the image of a holy
[52:38] man he said the Gentile age was issued
[52:40] in with that it would go out in the same
[52:41] way boycott of the mark of the beast
[52:43] that will force people to worship images
[52:45] and do the things we've been taught was
[52:46] contrary to the word of God he said and
[52:48] breth it'll be so slick and sigh until
[52:51] it would deceive the very elect if
[52:54] possible he said so you better purpose
[52:56] in your heart tonight and be filled with
[52:59] God's holy spirit that you'll be able to
[53:01] discern the right and wrong thing when
[53:03] the proclamation is
[53:05] issued was like well I I would be able
[53:07] to tell well if you missed the Rapture
[53:09] you might not be able to
[53:11] tell best to go on when the Rapture
[53:14] comes right but we see that and I think
[53:17] we can all see that it's not what I'm
[53:18] preaching on this morning we see that
[53:19] creeping into the message even if the
[53:22] devil can't defeat the message and he
[53:24] can't he tries to creep into it yeah and
[53:27] and caused people to become idolators
[53:29] now Daniel 3:1 let's go there
[53:31] Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of
[53:33] gold whose height was three score cubits
[53:36] the bread throw six cubits he set it up
[53:37] in the plain of dura in the province of
[53:39] Babylon now notice it was a was an image
[53:41] of
[53:42] Daniel it made like look like Daniel
[53:46] then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to
[53:47] gather together the princes the
[53:49] governors the captains the judges the
[53:51] treasurers the counselors the sheriffs
[53:54] all the church officers all the Great
[53:56] Men all the rulers of the provinces to
[53:58] come to the dedication of the image
[54:01] which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up
[54:02] now the three Hebrew children were
[54:04] invited now it's interesting that they
[54:06] went they went but they were not coming
[54:09] to a worship they were coming to a
[54:12] dedication right and the dedication was
[54:15] to a prophet so they said come to the
[54:17] meeting we're going to dedicate this
[54:19] image to the to God to the prophet of
[54:22] God and the three Hebrew children were
[54:24] invited to it and they came to it with
[54:27] all the rest now Daniel 3:4 he said then
[54:29] a Herald cried aloud to you it is
[54:31] commanded oh people Nations and
[54:32] languages that what time you hear the
[54:34] sound of the Cornet flute harp sack butt
[54:37] sultry doer and all kinds of music You
[54:39] Fall Down and Worship the golden image
[54:41] that Nebuchadnezzar the King has set up
[54:43] I want to stop there for just a moment
[54:44] because I've heard it said that well it
[54:46] was the music that was wrong if they
[54:48] hadn't had music it would have never
[54:49] brought them to worship of of a wrong
[54:51] thing but music is always associated
[54:54] with worship true and false
[54:57] right it's always associated with
[54:59] worship so you're going to have music
[55:01] either way we might as well have that
[55:02] music that brings true
[55:04] worship and brother you know the music
[55:07] might have been the same stuff that
[55:09] Shadrach Meshach and abedo played down
[55:11] at their
[55:13] church right it might have been it might
[55:15] have been uh it might have been an old
[55:18] Henson
[55:20] song could have been and and I like the
[55:23] Henson y'all don't even know who the
[55:24] Henson are some of you but but uh it
[55:26] might have been an old hon it might have
[55:28] been call me gone you know or something
[55:29] like that and it's an old old song Maybe
[55:33] and all the musical instruments got
[55:35] together and they played it and oh it's
[55:36] anointed and oh it's wonderful but you
[55:39] always watch where the worships going to
[55:41] right right it's not in the music
[55:43] necessarily although music can be bad
[55:46] right and we don't want it to be bad we
[55:48] want to keep rock and roll out of the
[55:50] church but but not your definition of
[55:53] what that is but but I think I I think
[55:56] that's why God gives us pastors and men
[55:58] and and music lead people worship
[55:59] leaders people that can that can watch
[56:02] that and and do that but and yet uh you
[56:04] know we want to be able to worship
[56:05] freely we don't want to get all bound up
[56:07] and and get to the point where we can't
[56:09] do nothing because we're scared of
[56:10] offending God you're not going to offend
[56:12] him by worshiping loudly or he'd be
[56:14] offended in on the throne in
[56:17] heaven right David said wor pray play he
[56:21] said skillfully with a loud noise the
[56:24] key there is skillfully
[56:28] right yes sir now so it might have been
[56:31] the same stuff they were worshiping
[56:33] something
[56:35] different now brother BR says shame on
[56:37] you people that don't believe in music
[56:39] all right that's what brings the spirit
[56:41] of the Lord sometimes God doesn't change
[56:43] he said if he liked it then he likes it
[56:45] now now they had the music they had
[56:48] Daniel's image but no Daniel yeah watch
[56:52] Daniel wasn't there they didn't consult
[56:55] Daniel cuz he have said no you're not
[56:57] doing that right they didn't consult
[57:00] Daniel they had a form of godliness but
[57:02] within their worship was idolatry and
[57:05] the true seed of God would never stand
[57:07] for that right so in Daniel 3:6 it said
[57:10] who so falleth not down and worship us
[57:12] so that they get to the meeting and the
[57:14] guy gets up and reads it and says this
[57:16] is the way we're going to have
[57:18] church who so fth not down and worship
[57:21] it shall the same hour be cast into the
[57:23] midst of a burning fiery furnace
[57:25] therefore now watch anytime you're
[57:28] you're forced to a worship it's not of
[57:31] God yeah right if God wanted people that
[57:34] were forced to worship him he' just
[57:35] stayed with
[57:37] angels right he wouldn't have messed
[57:38] with us he wouldn't even bother with
[57:40] humans at all he wanted the people who
[57:42] would worship him because they love him
[57:44] right because they care about him yeah
[57:46] so any anytime you're forced to worship
[57:50] it's a it's a Catholic it's a it's a
[57:52] it's a Babylonian thing started in the
[57:54] Babylon in Babylon it goes into the
[57:56] second Babylon which is the Roman
[57:57] Catholic church and and Rome and so it
[58:00] becomes a it becomes a a Babylonian
[58:03] worship now so they were they were
[58:04] forced to it now they said as soon as
[58:07] you hear all these things that you
[58:08] worship and if you don't you're going to
[58:11] be thrown in the midst of a burning
[58:12] fiery furnace so verse 7 as soon as they
[58:14] heard the sound all the people fell down
[58:17] listen all them other
[58:20] thousands of
[58:23] Jews fell
[58:25] down yeah
[58:28] yeah think about it for a minute all the
[58:30] ones that had been invited all the ones
[58:31] that were there all the king's
[58:33] Sons but there was somebody who didn't
[58:36] all right oh that God would put
[58:38] something the fall within our hearts
[58:40] that when everybody else falls down we
[58:42] won't if everybody you say well nobody
[58:45] in my home believes the message nobody
[58:46] in my home wants to go to church you be
[58:48] the one I don't care if you're young I
[58:50] don't care if you're whatever it is you
[58:51] be the one find a way to get in the
[58:53] house of
[58:55] God yeah nobody else wants to do it you
[58:57] you don't fall down to it everybody else
[59:00] says well you know you can choose what
[59:01] gender you are you can uh you you can
[59:04] and that's just an easy thing but you
[59:06] know to know that it's wrong but there's
[59:07] many other things that we have today you
[59:09] can do whatever you want we will not bow
[59:11] to your image right of leoa We Will Not
[59:14] Bow to Babylon Babylonian worship we
[59:16] will not bow to just an easy believism
[59:19] you can do whatever you want just come
[59:20] to church and live like that no no we we
[59:22] we believe our God is a god of Holiness
[59:24] and a god of a god of Honor yeah now
[59:28] look wherefore at that time certain
[59:30] calans came near and accused the Jews
[59:33] they always will now here's something
[59:35] else we can look at any anytime the the
[59:38] bride is never an accuser right the
[59:41] bride is Accused never an accuser if you
[59:45] if you become if you take on yourself an
[59:47] accusatory Spirit you actually become
[59:51] take Satan's job right he's the accuser
[59:54] of the Brethren that's his tipe
[59:57] it's a title given to him in the
[59:58] scripture the accuser of the Brethren I
[59:59] don't want the devil's job I don't want
[1:00:02] to be the accuser we let the devil do
[1:00:05] that but there will always be an accuser
[1:00:07] as long as we're going through the test
[1:00:10] and they told the king there are certain
[1:00:11] Jews whom thou has set over the Affairs
[1:00:13] of the province of Babylon and these men
[1:00:15] oh King have not regarded thee they
[1:00:16] serve not thy Gods nor worship the
[1:00:18] golden image which thou set up and then
[1:00:21] Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury
[1:00:23] commanded to bring Shadrach me meach and
[1:00:26] Abednego and they brought these men
[1:00:28] before the king and Nebuchadnezzar spake
[1:00:31] unto them and said unto them is it true
[1:00:33] oh Shadrach mesach and abedo do not you
[1:00:35] serve my gods nor worship the golden
[1:00:38] image which I have set up now if you be
[1:00:40] ready at what time you hear all these
[1:00:42] instruments you fall down and worship
[1:00:43] the image which I made well but if you
[1:00:46] worship not you should be cast the same
[1:00:48] hour in the midst of a burning fiery
[1:00:49] furnace now look at the challenge he
[1:00:52] said and who is that God that will
[1:00:54] deliver you out of my hand
[1:00:58] and Shadrach Meshach and abedo answered
[1:01:00] and said to the king we are not
[1:01:03] careful hallelujah oh I love that this
[1:01:06] that's the way we ought to be about the
[1:01:07] word of God but every part of it we
[1:01:09] don't have to be careful about
[1:01:11] acknowledging the word of God is true we
[1:01:14] don't have to be careful about not
[1:01:15] bowing to the images that he set up
[1:01:17] listen we're not careful to answer the
[1:01:19] in this matter if it be so our God whom
[1:01:21] we serve is able do you believe he is
[1:01:24] this morning he's able to deliver us
[1:01:25] from the burning fiery furnace he will
[1:01:27] deliver us out of thine hand oh King but
[1:01:29] if not be known unto thee Oh King we
[1:01:31] will not serve thy Gods nor worship the
[1:01:33] golden image which thou has set up yeah
[1:01:36] now brother brandham takes that and he
[1:01:37] says the Hebrew children didn't have a
[1:01:40] promise of being delivered from the fire
[1:01:43] yeah right he said they didn't have any
[1:01:45] promise they couldn't go back here and
[1:01:47] read in the Bible and say Lord you
[1:01:49] promised in your word that any of your
[1:01:50] children ever went into a fiery furnace
[1:01:52] you would deliver them all right Lord
[1:01:54] we're coming right there upon on that
[1:01:56] see they couldn't do that said well that
[1:01:58] wouldn't have been so hard to do just
[1:01:59] their faith because God had already
[1:02:01] promised it but God hadn't promised them
[1:02:03] no such a thing but here is the words
[1:02:05] they had God was so real to them yeah oh
[1:02:10] that God would be so real in our homes
[1:02:12] he'd be so real here in the church and
[1:02:14] he'd be so real to us as individuals
[1:02:17] that we could say even if we don't have
[1:02:19] a specific promise He's
[1:02:22] Able he's able to do it our God is abble
[1:02:26] now he said he said God hadn't promised
[1:02:28] them no such a thing he said but here's
[1:02:30] the words they had our God is abble how
[1:02:32] about that he said the fellow that don't
[1:02:33] believe in Divine Healing God is able to
[1:02:36] deliver us come these fiery furnace but
[1:02:38] will not bow down to your images sir and
[1:02:41] when they walked into the fiery furnace
[1:02:45] listen upon bare sheer
[1:02:49] Faith glory to God they didn't have the
[1:02:52] message like you do they didn't have a
[1:02:54] good church to go to they didn't have
[1:02:56] any of the stuff like we have today but
[1:02:57] upon bare sheer Faith they walked into
[1:03:00] the fiery furnace oh my that God was
[1:03:03] able not promised but he was able God
[1:03:06] sent Christ in the fiery furnace and
[1:03:08] fann the fire away from them and

[1:04:49] into it because it's going to happen

[1:05:54] Fury they said God God's able all that
[1:05:57] did make the devil
[1:05:59] mad sometimes when you claim the
[1:06:00] promises of God all it does make the
[1:06:02] devil
[1:06:04] mad but it's still going to come to pass
[1:06:08] matter how mad he
[1:06:10] gets don't you don't you just love that
[1:06:13] no matter how mad the devil gets it
[1:06:15] ain't going to stop
[1:06:17] God it don't bother God at all when the
[1:06:20] devil throws a fit cuz he does it all
[1:06:21] the time
[1:06:23] anyway that's like that little kid you
[1:06:25] know maybe yeah I shouldn't even go here
[1:06:26] like that little kid that's always
[1:06:27] throwing fits you know they throw a fit
[1:06:29] at Walmart they throw a fit at the at
[1:06:31] the grocery store they throw a fit down
[1:06:32] at the restaurant they're always
[1:06:34] throwing a fit you expect that from them
[1:06:36] that's the way the devil is to God he's
[1:06:38] just always throwing a fit and getting
[1:06:39] mad God's not worried by it at all he's
[1:06:42] not running around oh what are we going
[1:06:43] to do now the devil's mad he's always
[1:06:45] been mad yeah he was created for that
[1:06:48] purpose but you were put you were
[1:06:50] created to put your foot on top of the
[1:06:52] devil yeah right
[1:06:54] Hallelujah
[1:06:56] now but he said you know what I'm going
[1:06:58] to do he said I'm going to I'm going to
[1:06:59] heat it up seven times hotter seven
[1:07:03] Church ages he heated it hotter now
[1:07:05] here's what I believe and you can you
[1:07:07] can if this is seed spit it out this is
[1:07:09] just what I believe about it I believe
[1:07:11] it was compounded you ever heard of
[1:07:13] compound
[1:07:14] interest seven times hotter you know so
[1:07:17] it's a for in the first age it was so
[1:07:19] hot in the second age it was that hot
[1:07:21] plus all that was in the first age plus
[1:07:23] the second age and then all that was in
[1:07:25] the first two ages plus right the third
[1:07:28] age and so it just keeps getting more
[1:07:30] and more and more and more seven times
[1:07:33] seven times they heated it up seven
[1:07:35] times it got to where he was sure that
[1:07:39] no man could stand that
[1:07:40] test the devil was confident the King
[1:07:43] was confident that nobody could survive
[1:07:46] that
[1:07:47] fire how could any man do it oh my now
[1:07:50] look there is a people that can
[1:07:52] withstand the test yeah we can look out
[1:07:54] at the age today and we can say how
[1:07:56] could any man how could any family raise
[1:07:58] up with the darkness that's all around
[1:08:00] us how could any married couple make it
[1:08:02] in the age that we live it How can any
[1:08:04] church make it in the in with the
[1:08:05] darkness all around gross Darkness
[1:08:07] covering the land how can anybody make
[1:08:09] it but there will be a people that make
[1:08:11] it why why did they make it they were
[1:08:13] the elect of God they were the seed
[1:08:16] right oh church we just recognize who
[1:08:18] you are today you're the seed of God you
[1:08:22] belong to God they were God's children
[1:08:24] and the promise was your seed will
[1:08:27] possess the Gate of his enemy and that's
[1:08:29] our promise today we're the spiritual
[1:08:31] Seed of Abraham and he said thy seed
[1:08:33] will possess the Gate of his enemy
[1:08:35] that's the promise they had that they
[1:08:37] were just a seed you may not have a
[1:08:40] specific promise that you can find for
[1:08:41] the situation you're dealing with right
[1:08:43] now but you do have this promise I'm a
[1:08:45] seed of God and thy seed will possess
[1:08:48] the Gate of his enemy that means if
[1:08:50] there's something stopping me from
[1:08:51] moving forward I'm going to take that
[1:08:53] gate and I'm going to be able to take
[1:08:55] that problem and I'm going to be able to
[1:08:57] defeat that enemy not not 99 times out
[1:08:59] of 100 but 100 times out of a
[1:09:02] 100 thy seed
[1:09:07] will
[1:09:10] now he commanded the most mighty men
[1:09:12] that were in his
[1:09:14] army now
[1:09:16] look Babylonian Army had just defeated
[1:09:18] Jerusalem they were the best army in the
[1:09:22] world so he calls the best of the best
[1:09:24] today maybe that would be the Navy SEALS
[1:09:26] or the Army Rangers he said I don't want
[1:09:29] just a bunch of prison guards to do this
[1:09:32] I want the very best men that I've got I
[1:09:35] want you to make sure that they don't
[1:09:38] escape he commanded the most Mighty Men
[1:09:41] in his army to bind Shadrach mhach and
[1:09:45] Abednego and to cast him into the
[1:09:47] burning fiery
[1:09:49] furnace then these men were Bound in
[1:09:51] their coats their hes in their hats so
[1:09:54] they still had their clothes all their
[1:09:55] clothes on and their other garments and
[1:09:57] were cast into the midst of the burning
[1:10:01] fiery
[1:10:04] furnace therefore because the king's
[1:10:06] commandment was urgent and the furnace
[1:10:09] exceeding hot the flame of the fire slew
[1:10:13] those men that took up Shadrach mhach
[1:10:16] and Abednego and these three men
[1:10:17] Shadrach mhach and abedo fell down bound
[1:10:21] into the midst of the
[1:10:24] burning fire fiery furnace now last
[1:10:27] week I preached about how the the age is
[1:10:30] standing on slippery
[1:10:32] ground and and they're going one step
[1:10:35] from
[1:10:36] tribulation and we're one step from the
[1:10:38] Rapture yeah all right right Wonder
[1:10:41] they're one step from
[1:10:43] tribulation and I begin to while I was
[1:10:45] studying on that I begin to research
[1:10:47] what brother BR said about one step
[1:10:49] whenever he talks about one step he he
[1:10:51] refers to the three Hebrew children most
[1:10:53] of the times he talks about that he
[1:10:55] refers to the three Hebrew children and
[1:10:57] how they were one step from the
[1:11:00] fire one step and it's that last step
[1:11:04] many times it's hardest to
[1:11:06] take because you know you know when you
[1:11:08] got six or seven steps in front of you
[1:11:11] as you're going up the ramp towards the
[1:11:12] fire and and the heat you can feel it it
[1:11:15] was intense but you get closer and
[1:11:18] closer and closer you realize after a
[1:11:20] while you can't
[1:11:21] breathe you you begin to perspire your
[1:11:25] is so hot it feels like it's going to
[1:11:27] burn off melt off of you because you're
[1:11:29] getting that much closer to the fire and
[1:11:32] it's that last step that's so hard to
[1:11:34] still have any faith because the fire is
[1:11:37] so real at that moment and brother BR
[1:11:40] said I can hear Shadrach say to
[1:11:42] me are you sure you prayed
[1:11:49] through think about it for a minute I
[1:11:51] know this is simple this morning but
[1:11:52] just just think with me for a minute
[1:11:57] I'll go with you man buddy yeah you got
[1:11:59] the Revelation man tell you what we're
[1:12:02] we're brothers we'll go together one
[1:12:05] step two steps three steps five
[1:12:09] steps six
[1:12:12] steps last step man you
[1:12:17] sure are you sure this
[1:12:21] morning cuz the world's One Step from
[1:12:23] hell right you might as well have
[1:12:25] something you believe in right you might
[1:12:28] as well believe the message of the hour
[1:12:31] yes that if you prayed through said
[1:12:34] sometimes when Satan puts the heat on we
[1:12:36] have to stop and check up yeah Lord do I
[1:12:39] truly believe you yes I can hear
[1:12:41] Shadrach say yes it's all prayed up
[1:12:44] now that's easy to go along with the
[1:12:47] church and and go as long as things are

[1:16:18] promise he said they started walking a
[1:16:21] little farther I can hear him say are
[1:16:23] you sure you're prayed up yep all
[1:16:27] right all right got right up to the
[1:16:30] steps to about one
[1:16:33] step so they begin to feel
[1:16:36] fainty know if that's a word but it's
[1:16:37] pretty
[1:16:40] descriptive begin to feel
[1:16:42] fainty like they was going
[1:16:48] in
[1:16:49] look brother Brandon said God doesn't
[1:16:51] ever do anything on Earth without also
[1:16:53] doing something in heaven
[1:16:55] right so as this was going on something
[1:16:58] was going on in heaven too right so
[1:17:00] brother BR said turn the camera towards
[1:17:02] heaven Oh my he said there's always two
[1:17:05] sides to it you know when Satan's on the
[1:17:07] job Jesus is also ever who you yield
[1:17:10] your faith to that's the way it's going
[1:17:13] give it to Christ he said let's look up
[1:17:16] this way you know he said I can see him
[1:17:18] sitting up there in his majesty I can
[1:17:21] see him sitting up there in his majesty
[1:17:23] his Priestly robes draped around him
[1:17:26] looking
[1:17:27] down and as he looks he sits patiently
[1:17:31] and waits one step two steps all the way
[1:17:35] up maybe it took them seven steps let's
[1:17:36] say to get to the top of the ramp or the
[1:17:38] stairs they get all the way up and the
[1:17:41] fire's so close that it actually kills
[1:17:45] the guards that took them up the Navy
[1:17:47] Seals that had a hold of them
[1:17:50] yeah let me ask you a question this
[1:17:52] morning how have you survived
[1:17:56] when Great Men didn't
[1:17:57] survive how have you made it yeah when
[1:18:01] the ones who told you you wouldn't make
[1:18:03] it all right aren't here anymore come on
[1:18:05] now how have you made it it's because
[1:18:07] you're made of the kind of stuff that
[1:18:09] doesn't burn
[1:18:11] easily it's not very flammable oh my oh
[1:18:15] Church you just recognize what that seed
[1:18:17] means to you what that something on the
[1:18:19] inside of the inside means to you you
[1:18:21] get right up close to the fire and they
[1:18:23] died and but the children you know they
[1:18:25] might have been gasping for breath
[1:18:29] heat you've ever been real close to a
[1:18:31] fire they might have been just just
[1:18:33] barely able to make it but they made
[1:18:37] it you say well brother Ben I'm hurting
[1:18:39] this morning but you're here yeah all
[1:18:42] right I'm not feeling good maybe some of
[1:18:44] you sitting at home watching or you're
[1:18:46] going maybe things have gone bad for you
[1:18:48] but you can say well I brother Ben I I
[1:18:50] don't understand but you're still with
[1:18:51] it you're still believing the message
[1:18:53] you're still you're still serving God
[1:18:55] yeah why because you're made of stronger
[1:18:58] stuff than the Mighty Men You're Made Of
[1:19:00] stronger stuff than those with a great
[1:19:02] name or something like that you're made
[1:19:04] of something that don't
[1:19:06] burn good
[1:19:09] watch here in heaven the Angels get
[1:19:13] concerned brother brandom said you've

[1:24:33] of fainty like walking on up hands tied
[1:24:37] behind them you see them walking there
[1:24:39] they're just about to fall over from the
[1:24:41] heat but they keep going
[1:24:43] forward they keep moving brother Bill
[1:24:46] they just can't hardly seem to make it

[1:25:06] enough he said I can see them right up
[1:25:08] there almost ready to step into the
[1:25:10] fiery furnace and it looks pretty bad
[1:25:14] for believers
[1:25:17] there looks pretty bad for believers
[1:25:20] there I'm sure the other thousands of
[1:25:24] the Jews said boy we're glad we didn't
[1:25:27] do what they
[1:25:28] did and we're glad we just settled into
[1:25:30] Leo to see it become good
[1:25:35] Babylonians we're glad we didn't take
[1:25:37] the stand they did because now they're
[1:25:38] going through a trial but what they were
[1:25:40] actually going to have going through was
[1:25:43] a trial that led to a
[1:25:45] Deliverance without the trial there
[1:25:47] would have been no reason for the story
[1:25:49] that's right oh Hallelujah there would
[1:25:51] have been no testimony without the test
[1:25:55] yeah now look he said I can see them up
[1:25:58] there almost ready to step in look
[1:26:00] pretty bad for believers the Old King

[1:26:08] controlled you know why just forgive me
[1:26:12] for a minute you know why some preachers

[1:26:15] in the church because they can't control
[1:26:17] it come
[1:26:22] on Old Nebuchadnezzar thought had his
[1:26:24] church pretty controlled yeah you're
[1:26:27] going to get rid of the Holy Rollers
[1:26:28] everything going to be all right after
[1:26:30] that oh God there's something about them
[1:26:33] holy rollers are hard to get rid of
[1:26:35] yeah all right he said the situation
[1:26:38] control now as soon as they hit that
[1:26:40] fiery furnace the rest of the guys will

[1:27:20] decision now the way is provided for you

[1:27:53] just one step between me and death he
[1:27:55] said there was one step between them and
[1:27:57] death but just at that crucial moment
[1:27:59] God provided a way of escape and he sent
[1:28:01] into that fiery furnace the Lord Jesus
[1:28:04] Christ and kept the fire off of
[1:28:06] them Hallelujah is it now we see them

[1:32:51] oh God did not burn them they felt like
[1:32:54] they were going to die but they didn't
[1:32:59] die that's good i' been a lot easier if
[1:33:02] God had just warned them ahead of time
[1:33:04] and said here's what I want to
[1:33:07] do a lot easier wouldn't it he told you
[1:33:11] now you're going to get leukemia but I'm
[1:33:12] going to see you through and at the end
[1:33:13] after a certain number of days you're
[1:33:14] going to he didn't do that did
[1:33:17] he he let you be scared for a while what
[1:33:20] was he doing testing your
[1:33:22] faith
[1:33:24] just testing your faith yeah now look
[1:33:27] they thought there were one step from
[1:33:30] the fire that would destroy them and
[1:33:33] they were actually one step from Freedom
[1:33:36] all right see they were bound going into
[1:33:39] the fire and had they oh God had they
[1:33:42] turned around had they had they stopped
[1:33:46] at that last step and turn around and
[1:33:48] said oh King we we'll do whatever you
[1:33:50] want we'll bowle your image don't throw
[1:33:51] us in that fire if they had done done
[1:33:54] that they would have always been bound
[1:33:57] the king they might have wore nice
[1:33:58] clothes they might have had nice houses
[1:34:00] but they would have always been bound
[1:34:02] whatever the king said they for them to
[1:34:04] do they would always be bound because
[1:34:07] they said well he could throw us in the
[1:34:08] fiery furnace again they would always be
[1:34:11] bound but when they went in they
[1:34:13] realized that suddenly they became free
[1:34:15] yes oh Church you're not one step from
[1:34:18] the fire you're one step from
[1:34:20] Freedom the world is one step from the
[1:34:22] fire they're one One Step from a
[1:34:24] tribulation period but you're one step
[1:34:26] from oh God from having the B the bonds
[1:34:29] of this flesh burn off of you and you're
[1:34:32] going to walk with God and have a new
[1:34:34] body yes he'll be there for
[1:34:37] you brother Bron when they were tested
[1:34:40] whether they would worship images and
[1:34:42] break the word of God they stayed true
[1:34:44] to the word yeah oh my they stayed true
[1:34:47] to the word regardless of the
[1:34:48] circumstances they stayed true to the
[1:34:50] word and when they throw them into the
[1:34:52] fiery furnace God's promise was
[1:34:55] fulfilled they possessed the gates of
[1:34:57] their enemy and there was a fourth man
[1:35:00] standing in there I love this with a key
[1:35:03] that unlocked the heat from the
[1:35:06] fire Hallelujah and it could not do
[1:35:10] nothing but set them
[1:35:12] free they felt the heat but the only
[1:35:15] thing the fire could hurt was the bonds
[1:35:18] on their hands good Hallelujah Wonder oh

[1:35:24] some of you might be getting down to the
[1:35:25] end of your life some of our elders they
[1:35:28] get discouraged sometimes and get down
[1:35:30] you know you have more years behind you
[1:35:32] than ahead of you at least you get down
[1:35:35] to that place and you think well just
[1:35:37] one step one day one heartbeat one

[1:37:24] believer of this message just step into
[1:37:26] the
[1:37:27] fire yeah it may get
[1:37:29] hot but he has the key to separate the
[1:37:33] heat from the
[1:37:36] fire I'm so grateful for
[1:37:40] that you know sometimes I've gotten into
[1:37:42] trials out of my own stupidity and I
[1:37:43] know that sometimes just just something
[1:37:47] I I could have avoided it but it was
[1:37:50] just my own stupidity but he let me go
[1:37:51] through it
[1:37:54] but it didn't burn me
[1:37:57] up it didn't destroy
[1:38:00] me why he was in the fire cuz I'm
[1:38:04] his and there's nothing that can
[1:38:06] separate me from that Paul says what can
[1:38:08] separate me from the love of God nothing
[1:38:11] nothing future nothing past nothing
[1:38:13] present nothing can separate me from the
[1:38:17] love of God God I'm so grateful for that
[1:38:20] today as long as I know he's leading
[1:38:22] Lord as long as I know you're leading
[1:38:24] I'm going to keep on walking could you
[1:38:26] say that this morning Heavenly
[1:38:29] Father Lord Jesus as long as we know
[1:38:31] you're with us you're in the boat you're

[1:38:37] walking just on my heart this morning to
[1:38:40] encourage your people Lord I I pray
[1:38:42] you'd help us to recognize where we're
[1:38:44] at Lord where we're at in time we're so
[1:38:46] close to the end we're so close to the
[1:38:49] fire we we feel faint sometimes we get
[1:38:52] weary we feel like we just can't hardly
[1:38:54] catch our breath but it's at that moment
[1:38:57] that you take that Palm from the Tree of
[1:39:00] Life and start to blow cool breezes over
[1:39:03] us and somehow we're not burned up
[1:39:06] though we feel the heat we're not burned
[1:39:08] up we're so thankful for that today Lord
[1:39:12] Lord I know there's people here that

[1:39:16] been there and done that I know what
[1:39:18] it's like but Lord they they they're
[1:39:20] standing here today and believing Lord
[1:39:23] that you're in the fire lord and maybe
[1:39:25] they they brought it on themselves but
[1:39:27] yet you're still there and sometimes
[1:39:29] lord it's something that happens to us
[1:39:31] and we didn't bring it on ourselves just
[1:39:32] genetics it's just just what happened in
[1:39:34] life it's it's just the way that maybe
[1:39:36] God allowed it just so Satan could test
[1:39:39] us but Lord Lord we're believing you too
[1:39:41] you would not allow it to happen if it
[1:39:44] wasn't for our good Lord we believe
[1:39:46] you're with us today you're with the
[1:39:48] sword in our stupid mistakes you're with
[1:39:51] the sword even when we're like the three
[1:39:52] Hebrew children and we stand for you
[1:39:54] you're with us in that moment oh God I
[1:39:56] pray you'd help us to stand I pray you'd
[1:39:58] help the young people to stand Lord the
[1:40:00] the elders Lord to stand may they not
[1:40:02] live all their life with a testimony and
