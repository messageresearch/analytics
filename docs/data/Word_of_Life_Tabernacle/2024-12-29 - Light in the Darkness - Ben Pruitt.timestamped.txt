[46:58] amen let's go to Matthew 5 and verse1
[47:09] 14 Matthew chap 5:14 I know there's
[47:12] several that are sick and I'm been under
[47:14] the weather a little bit myself so you
[47:16] pray for me this
[47:17] morning be praying for those that are
[47:19] home today and not able to
[47:21] come especially brother Gabe I know the
[47:23] Lord has really attacked him and and and
[47:27] um uh just and sister Patty as well just
[47:30] seemed like they got sick and couldn't
[47:31] get over it but uh that's just the devil
[47:34] We Believe God's A Healer how many
[47:35] believe that today so we believe that
[47:38] for healing for them Matthew 5:14 you
[47:41] are the light of the world a city that
[47:43] is set on a hill cannot be
[47:47] hid neither do men light a candle and
[47:50] put it under a bushel but on a
[47:53] Candlestick it giveth light unto all
[47:55] that are in the house house let your
[47:58] light so shine before men that they may
[48:01] see your good works and glorify your
[48:04] father which is in heaven I want to
[48:06] speak to you this morning on light in
[48:07] the darkness you may be
[48:09] seated pray the Lord would add his
[48:11] Blessing to the
[48:13] word John winthrip said this when the
[48:16] Puritans first sailed to America and
[48:19] they were looking at establishing a new
[48:22] nation a new settlement he said we must
[48:25] consider that we shall be as a city upon
[48:28] a hill a city upon a hill the eyes of
[48:31] all people are upon us and politicians
[48:35] have used that many times and said we're
[48:37] like America is like a city on a hill
[48:39] but I think the rest of this statement
[48:41] is true of this country he said so that
[48:44] if we shall deal falsely with our God in
[48:45] this work we have undertaken so cause
[48:48] him to withdraw his present help from us
[48:51] we shall be made a story and a byword
[48:53] through the world we shall open the
[48:55] mouths of enemies to speak evil the ways
[48:57] of God and all professors for God's sake
[49:01] in other words he said we're a city on a
[49:02] hill everybody's looking at us and
[49:05] depending on what we do with this
[49:07] blessing that we've been given will
[49:09] depend on how people view that and how
[49:11] people view God and so we are a
[49:14] reflection of light but and I but I
[49:16] think we can all agree that this country
[49:18] is no longer a light but it's a Darkness
[49:21] there's a Darkness upon it everywhere in
[49:23] this country just the other day uh there
[49:26] was a a story that really it really
[49:28] bothered me to see it it was a woman a
[49:31] homeless woman was on the subway in New
[49:33] York and and uh and a guy come through
[49:36] and and he just just for fun just lights
[49:39] are on fire lights are on fire fans the
[49:43] flame and then what was more disturbing
[49:46] than that to me because this guy's
[49:48] obviously mentally Disturbed but more
[49:50] disturbing than that was that people
[49:52] videoed it and didn't help what kind of
[49:55] a world do we live in church where
[49:58] people would just stand by and watch
[49:59] that but the culture has become so uh
[50:03] much so intense towards getting likes
[50:06] getting uh a reaction on social media
[50:08] that they just stood by and videoed a
[50:11] woman burnt
[50:12] alive I I tell you what people answer
[50:15] for things like that Darkness rains in
[50:18] the world that we live in it's not just
[50:20] there in New York City but everywhere we
[50:22] can see that people just aren't even
[50:24] Humane anymore we treat our and cats
[50:27] better than we do our people in many
[50:29] cases and it's not right and and and
[50:32] there's darkness and yet I don't want to
[50:34] talk so much about the darkness today
[50:35] but we are not of that Darkness we we
[50:39] are of the light the Bible says he said
[50:42] you are all the children of light and
[50:43] the children of the day you're not we're
[50:46] not of the night nor of Darkness we're
[50:48] not a part of that we are the light of
[50:51] the world that's what Jesus is telling
[50:53] us we're the true city on a hill and we
[50:55] have responsibility
[50:57] to let that light shine to let our light
[51:00] so shine before men and he tells us how
[51:03] to do that he said let your light shine
[51:06] through good
[51:08] works good works now that word good is
[51:11] actually the word beautiful or desirable
[51:15] something that is intrinsically sound in
[51:17] a moral or ethical sense and works is a
[51:20] workmanship a duty a task something that
[51:23] is
[51:24] accomplished by someone so we can say
[51:26] like this
[51:27] beautiful workmanship in other words by
[51:31] your actions let people see what Christ
[51:35] has done for you and so he said let your
[51:37] light shine let it let it shine shine
[51:40] refers to the state of something
[51:42] radiating light so it's not something
[51:46] that is uh putting something on but it's
[51:48] what something is that word is used when
[51:51] Jesus is transfigured before them his
[51:54] face shown his face glowed it it had a
[51:58] radiating light about it brother
[52:00] brandham taught us there was a
[52:01] difference in that and the and the way
[52:03] that Hollywood shines Hollywood shines
[52:07] Hollywood uh has a a glamour about it
[52:11] but but he said the gospel glows or
[52:13] something about the gospel that that
[52:16] causes it to to put out a light and so
[52:20] we don't we don't have the glamour of
[52:22] self righteousness but the glow of the
[52:24] spirit of God isn't that what we want in
[52:27] our lives and our homes and everything
[52:29] that we
[52:30] are he said now so it's not the the the
[52:33] glamour of self-righteousness not like
[52:35] the leoan church which said I'm rich and
[52:39] increased in Goods I'm a city on a hill
[52:42] but they lacked the character to prove
[52:45] what they were and to actually be what
[52:47] they claimed to be and brother Bram said
[52:50] here at church thinks it's so clothed in
[52:52] it self-righteousness until you think
[52:55] you go to bring them the word and they
[52:56] said that's contrary to our Creed he
[52:58] said what you sold out in your birth
[53:00] rights instead of being glamour he said
[53:02] we ought to be glowing instead of being
[53:04] glamour we ought to be glowing and so he
[53:07] talks about the the Full Gospel
[53:09] businessmen and he said the the glamour
[53:11] was of that was they tried to get as
[53:13] many together as they could and there's
[53:15] nothing wrong with that he said but
[53:17] that's the glamour of it he said he said
[53:20] maybe there he said uh instead of having
[53:22] five or 600 or everyone is here at
[53:24] breakfast he said that's all right after
[53:26] nothing against it he said I'm just here
[53:28] in the name of the Lord Jesus but
[53:30] instead of that there ought to be a
[53:31] glowing Among Us of the Holy Spirit he
[53:34] said maybe there's only a dozen glowing
[53:36] in the beauty of the Lord oh that's what
[53:39] we want isn't it glowing in the beauty
[53:41] of the Lord the Lord Jesus would be so
[53:43] upon us until the glow of the Lord would
[53:45] be in us he said but we want to shine
[53:49] speaking of that church of that day we
[53:51] want to shine more members see he said
[53:53] the church has always counted membership
[53:56] God counts character not membership and
[54:00] so we find that with Esther and brother
[54:01] Brown illustrates that he said Esther
[54:04] had an inner glow there was something
[54:05] inside of her that she was willing to uh
[54:09] she was willing to not take all the the
[54:11] paint and the makeup and the and the
[54:14] jewelry and things she just said
[54:15] whatever you tell me to wear I'll wear
[54:17] and she went before the king in a simple
[54:19] way because it it was showed the beauty
[54:22] was on the inside not what was on the
[54:24] outside and as the bride we don't just
[54:26] take what the world offers us but we
[54:28] take that light that glow that's on the
[54:31] inside and sometimes we go through some
[54:33] things and and we go through trials and
[54:35] we have trouble in our lives and we
[54:38] experience difficulty but what does that
[54:40] do it works a character in our life it
[54:42] brings the glow out of us brings the
[54:45] glow out of us oh church that's what I
[54:48] want I don't want to just be a shiny
[54:50] place a place that's a place that's uh
[54:53] uh got a lot of glitter or tinsil as we
[54:56] talk talked about last week but I want
[54:57] to glow from the
[55:00] inside so brother Brandon was talking
[55:03] about the Tabernacle and I I believe
[55:05] this true of our church as well is what
[55:07] we
[55:08] want he said I think it's our duty to
[55:10] make the inside
[55:12] right we want the outside to be nice but
[55:15] it's our duty to make the inside right
[55:17] this is good works yeah by the grace of
[55:20] God to be so grateful to God that this
[55:23] will just not only be a beautiful
[55:25] building that will come to
[55:27] but may everyone who comes in see the
[55:30] beautiful
[55:32] characteristic oh my the beautiful
[55:35] characteristic of Jesus Christ in every
[55:39] person that comes in may it be a
[55:42] consecrated place to our Lord a
[55:45] consecrated people that's why we keep
[55:46] order in the sanctuary it's why we do
[55:49] our best to make sure we're not trying
[55:51] to be hard on people but what are we
[55:52] doing we're we want it to be a
[55:54] consecrated place and a consecrated
[55:56] people a beautiful people keep the
[55:58] inside right but no matter how beautiful
[56:01] the structure is we certainly do
[56:03] appreciate the beauty of the church he
[56:04] said is the character of the people the
[56:08] beauty of the church is how do you get
[56:10] character by going through some things
[56:12] by by going through hard trials by by
[56:14] being refined by those things by going
[56:18] through the
[56:19] fire he said may it be a consecrated
[56:22] people for no matter how beautiful the
[56:23] structure is the beauty of the church is
[56:25] the character of the people
[56:26] he said I trust it'll always be a house
[56:28] of God
[56:31] Beauty good works done out of love for
[56:35] God and man are
[56:39] light in the
[56:41] darkness if you just live your life by
[56:44] the
[56:45] Bible just do what you can to live right
[56:49] you're you're 100% better off I started
[56:53] to say 90% you're 100% better off
[56:56] than what this world does you'll be a
[56:59] better
[57:00] citizen a better person in your
[57:03] community you'll be a better person in
[57:05] your church right you'll be a better
[57:07] person in your world better husband in
[57:10] your family better wife better child
[57:11] whatever it is if you just do you say
[57:14] well I don't know a lot about the Bible
[57:16] just do what you
[57:17] know right just do what you know just do
[57:20] what and that's a choice that we have
[57:22] see he wants us to let our light shine
[57:25] let what we are get out to the world
[57:28] yeah so a lot of people think of Good
[57:31] Works they think of that as helping the
[57:32] widow or the orphan and that's part of
[57:35] it but that's not all of it Jesus said
[57:38] my meat is to do the will of him that
[57:39] sent me to finish his work he was
[57:42] talking about about being in the perfect
[57:45] will of God and brother brandom
[57:47] explained to us I don't have time to get
[57:48] into it this morning real compassion is
[57:51] doing the will of God so we need to find
[57:54] the will of God for every one of our
[57:55] Lives the best thing we could do for our
[57:58] family is to find the will of God for
[58:00] where we work and where we go to church
[58:02] and who we're married to are you with me
[58:05] now we should find the will of God
[58:07] that's and that's our personal
[58:09] responsibility to find that it's the
[58:12] best thing the most compassionate thing
[58:14] you can do the best you say I want to do
[58:16] something for my community the best
[58:18] thing you can do is to be in the will of
[58:20] God and if you're in the will of God
[58:22] there will be opportunity to help people
[58:25] during that time now
[58:26] and so he said my mean is to do the will
[58:28] of him that sent me and to finish his
[58:30] work and now we we can't make ourselves
[58:36] light right he didn't say he didn't say
[58:40] go make yourself light yeah make
[58:43] yourself a city yeah on a hill he said
[58:46] you are a city on a hill that's right he
[58:48] didn't say make yourself light he said
[58:51] just don't put a bushel of basket over
[58:53] it right so he not telling us we can't
[58:56] make oursel
[58:58] light but the question is how do we take
[59:01] our light out from under the basket see
[59:05] light is only comes by
[59:07] Grace we we can't get there on our own
[59:09] but we can let our light shine that's up
[59:12] to us and that only comes by the new
[59:14] birth so how do we get it out from under
[59:17] the basket and if I would challenge you
[59:20] as we come into the new year we could
[59:22] look back at our old year and say well
[59:24] maybe I was this way and this is the way
[59:25] I I conducted myself but going into this
[59:28] new year how can I get my light out from
[59:30] under the basket how can I how can I put
[59:33] it on a candle stick because that's
[59:36] something he told us we could
[59:38] do so much of the New Testament if you
[59:41] look at it is dealing with our works
[59:44] yeah do you know that our duty to God
[59:47] our individual
[59:51] responsibility right as Christians
[59:54] Ephesians 2 and8
[59:56] I want us to deal because you you know
[59:58] the book of Ephesians and I want to get
[1:00:00] into some things that Paul got into is
[1:00:02] just going to be uh teaching this
[1:00:04] morning so y'all bear with me but the
[1:00:05] Joel's going to preach this afternoon so
[1:00:08] uh he'll uh preach us back happy again
[1:00:10] but I you know as a pastor I'm
[1:00:12] responsible to you I'm I'm responsible
[1:00:15] to preach the word to our children our
[1:00:16] young people and this is what the word
[1:00:19] is I I can't just always you know we
[1:00:21] could come out here and preach something
[1:00:23] everybody liked every service and and
[1:00:25] everybody be happy but that's not my
[1:00:27] responsibility my responsibility is to
[1:00:30] is to arm you with the truth so that you
[1:00:32] can go out and fight the good fight and
[1:00:34] be able to make it in the world that you
[1:00:36] live in sir so in Ephesians if you go to
[1:00:39] the book of Ephesians you find in
[1:00:40] Ephesians chapter 1 Paul deals with
[1:00:42] tremendous
[1:00:44] Mysteries right tremendous Mysteries
[1:00:47] that he deals with he deals with uh you
[1:00:49] we preached it many times brother BR
[1:00:51] preaches it in the adoption series he
[1:00:52] deals with Grace he deals with election
[1:00:55] predestination he deals with some
[1:00:57] wonderful wonderful depth and we're
[1:01:00] called to be an Ephesian Church how many
[1:01:01] believe that brother BR taught us that
[1:01:04] we're called to another Ephesians not
[1:01:06] another Corinthians so we're not called
[1:01:09] and I believe our preaching reflects
[1:01:11] that we're not called to just be
[1:01:13] hammered all the time I don't mean that
[1:01:15] in a maybe the way that you take it
[1:01:17] we're not called to be uh to have a
[1:01:20] preacher beating us over the head all
[1:01:21] the time is what I meant to say right
[1:01:23] that's not what we're called to we're
[1:01:24] called to the searchable Riches of
[1:01:27] Christ and if you got to if you got to
[1:01:29] go to church and get beat up every
[1:01:30] Sunday to be a Christian maybe you just
[1:01:32] need to be born again yeah right and
[1:01:35] then you don't have to get beat up so
[1:01:37] much and yet Paul does teach the people
[1:01:41] how to work yeah in a literal and
[1:01:44] figurative sense he teaches them how to
[1:01:46] do good works in because just because
[1:01:49] you're a Christian doesn't mean you
[1:01:51] automatically know what to do but being
[1:01:53] a Christian means when you know what to
[1:01:55] do you'll do it yes that's what being a
[1:01:58] Christian means it means you surren
[1:01:59] you've surrendered your will to the will
[1:02:01] of God but then you got to seek the will
[1:02:03] of God and where do we find the will his
[1:02:05] word is his will so we find the will of
[1:02:08] God by looking into the word of God and
[1:02:10] seeing what is it that you want me to do
[1:02:12] Lord what kind of a husband ought I to
[1:02:13] be what kind of a man what kind of a
[1:02:16] what kind of a church ought we to be so
[1:02:18] we find how to have church and how to
[1:02:20] how to be a man how to be a woman if
[1:02:23] you're a woman how to be a mother how to
[1:02:24] be a child all of that is in the word
[1:02:26] it's part of the word I'm so glad God
[1:02:28] didn't leave that out he didn't leave
[1:02:31] that out he didn't leave that out of of
[1:02:33] the Bible he didn't leave that out of
[1:02:34] the message of the hour you'll find when
[1:02:35] brother Brandon brought the opening of
[1:02:37] the word there was so much of that there
[1:02:39] was wonderful Mysteries and then there
[1:02:40] was so much of that that is your life
[1:02:42] worthy of the
[1:02:44] Gospel right brother Brandon preached
[1:02:47] both so it's our responsibility to do
[1:02:49] the
[1:02:50] same so if you go to Ephesians you go
[1:02:52] past chapter 1 and you get into chapter
[1:02:54] 2 and chapter 2 vers verse 8 he said for
[1:02:58] by grace are you saved through faith
[1:03:01] it's an important principle he said that
[1:03:04] not of yourselves it is the gift of God
[1:03:06] so you couldn't have done nothing to
[1:03:08] call yourself to the gospel it's the
[1:03:10] gift of God not of work such any man
[1:03:13] should
[1:03:15] boast for we are his
[1:03:19] workmanship his beautiful workmanship
[1:03:22] what does Jesus say let your light so
[1:03:25] shine before men we are his workmanship
[1:03:28] created in Christ Jesus unto good works
[1:03:31] now he's talking to saved people here
[1:03:35] not to unsaved not to not to people who
[1:03:38] don't care about the gospel he's not
[1:03:40] talking to the world he's talking to the
[1:03:42] church he's talking to the bride he said
[1:03:45] we are his workmanship created in Christ
[1:03:47] Jesus under good works which God have
[1:03:50] before ordained that we should walk in
[1:03:53] in them so he he sets that and then he
[1:03:57] goes in chapter 3 and goes back into
[1:03:59] some of the deep things some of the
[1:04:00] wonderful Mysteries that he's dealing
[1:04:03] with and then in Ephesians 4 chter 4
[1:04:06] verse
[1:04:07] 1 he said I therefore the prisoner of
[1:04:10] the Lord beseech you that you walk
[1:04:13] worthy of the vocation wherewith you're
[1:04:16] called so your walk is a choice yeah
[1:04:21] right your calling is not a choice right
[1:04:24] are you hear me this morning but your
[1:04:25] walk in that calling is a choice you
[1:04:28] can't make yourself light but you can
[1:04:31] take the basket off of the light put the
[1:04:33] light on a
[1:04:35] Candlestick be that City on the
[1:04:38] hill so he said I beseech you to walk
[1:04:41] worthy the vocation wherewith you're
[1:04:43] called with all loneliness and
[1:04:46] meekness with
[1:04:48] longsuffering forbearing one another in
[1:04:51] love in other words not not being easily
[1:04:54] offended and Dev ing to keep the unity
[1:04:56] of the spirit in the bond of peace and
[1:04:59] that one place he said as much as lies
[1:05:01] in you to Endeavor to do that and we
[1:05:03] preached on that many times he deals in
[1:05:07] in chapter four with gifts and with the
[1:05:10] five-fold
[1:05:11] ministry and then in verse 17 he said
[1:05:14] this I say therefore and testify in the
[1:05:16] Lord that you henceforth walk not as
[1:05:19] other Gentiles walk in the vanity of
[1:05:22] their mind so in other words they they
[1:05:24] walk or they they conduct themselves
[1:05:28] just however they feel like conducting
[1:05:31] themselves right right that's what in
[1:05:33] the vanity of their mind means they've
[1:05:34] just made up a
[1:05:36] culture right so he's telling us don't
[1:05:38] be like the culture come on now don't do
[1:05:41] what the culture does and I know
[1:05:44] sometimes when we hear preaching like
[1:05:45] this we we think well nobody else does
[1:05:47] it like this but what does the word say
[1:05:49] Church some point we got to come back to
[1:05:51] the word let the word order our thoughts
[1:05:53] let the word do that we find many this
[1:05:55] this culture breeds depression it breeds
[1:05:58] anxiety it breeds ungodliness it breeds
[1:06:01] all licentiousness all the adultery and
[1:06:03] everything else I don't want any of that
[1:06:05] in my life I don't want the culture I
[1:06:07] don't want to walk in the vanity of my
[1:06:09] own mind I want to walk according to the
[1:06:11] word yes so he said I don't want you to
[1:06:13] walk like other
[1:06:15] Gentiles in the vanity of your mind
[1:06:19] having the understanding
[1:06:22] darkened being alienated from the life
[1:06:24] of God through the ignorance that is in
[1:06:26] them because of the blindness of their
[1:06:28] heart yeah who being past feeling oh
[1:06:33] that's an interesting word being past
[1:06:35] feeling those people who watch that that
[1:06:38] woman get burnt past
[1:06:42] feeling yes sir huh are you with me now
[1:06:44] they're being past they don't even
[1:06:46] they're not even condemned by doing
[1:06:48] what's wrong anymore well I pray we
[1:06:50] would never get to that place I'm so
[1:06:53] glad to see our young people are
[1:06:54] sensitive to the when preach your young
[1:06:56] people are sensitive although we would
[1:06:57] all be sensitive to the preaching of the
[1:07:00] word when we hear something preach if it
[1:07:02] if it comes to us repent of that don't
[1:07:04] mean you're not a Christian listen it's
[1:07:06] not just it's not just Sinners that need
[1:07:08] to be at the altar many times Christians
[1:07:10] need to be at the altar we need to be
[1:07:12] surrendering ourselves to God not to get
[1:07:15] saved again if you've ever been saved
[1:07:17] you can't be unsaved right you you're
[1:07:19] sealed to the day of your Redemption but
[1:07:21] if we grieve him we need to get back in
[1:07:23] fellowship with him if we get CAU oh we
[1:07:25] need to get on fire again if we're not
[1:07:27] feeling the reain of the spirit anymore
[1:07:29] we need to feel that again it's not just
[1:07:32] a well it's wonderful when we do it no
[1:07:33] we must have it we've got to have his
[1:07:36] presence we've got to we've got to spend
[1:07:38] time around him if we don't we'll end up
[1:07:42] just like the
[1:07:46] world we don't want to be past
[1:07:50] feeling the word of God ought to prick
[1:07:53] our hearts
[1:07:56] H have given themselves over into
[1:07:59] levious such immoral living to work all
[1:08:03] unclean uncleanness with
[1:08:06] greediness but you have not so
[1:08:08] learned
[1:08:10] Christ if so be that you have heard him
[1:08:14] and have been taught by him as the truth
[1:08:17] is in
[1:08:20] Jesus you got to be taught brother brand
[1:08:23] says it this way he said you must come
[1:08:24] under
[1:08:26] teaching you must come under teaching so
[1:08:29] you say well I just get saved and
[1:08:31] everything will be okay you need to be
[1:08:33] saved but you must come under teaching
[1:08:36] right you say I don't need no one to
[1:08:37] teach me after the Holy Ghost has come
[1:08:38] my friends he said they just giv me just
[1:08:40] a little room to doubt whether you
[1:08:42] really got it or
[1:08:44] not I don't need to be taught people I
[1:08:47] don't need a pastor I don't need a
[1:08:48] Ministry I don't need I don't need the
[1:08:51] church well that's brother brandom
[1:08:53] taught us what that was
[1:08:56] right he said and now Ephesians 4:22 he
[1:08:59] said that you put off so he said this is
[1:09:02] what you should do this is what you've
[1:09:03] been taught that you put off concerning
[1:09:06] the former conversation the former
[1:09:09] Lifestyle the old man which is corrupt
[1:09:13] according to the deceitful
[1:09:15] lusts you put it off talk the saved
[1:09:19] people right people who are in church
[1:09:23] people who have the baptism of the Holy
[1:09:24] Ghost come on are you with me now but
[1:09:27] you still got an old man right that you
[1:09:29] got to put
[1:09:31] off put him off what do you mean take
[1:09:33] off it's like you're wearing clothes of
[1:09:36] the old man you take that off he's tell
[1:09:39] you what to wear what to what to do how
[1:09:41] to conduct yourself put off concerning
[1:09:45] concerning the former Lifestyle the old
[1:09:48] man which is corrupt according to the
[1:09:50] deceitful lust and be renewed in the
[1:09:53] spirit of your mind he says that in
[1:09:55] Romans he said be not conformed to this
[1:09:58] world but be transformed by the renewing
[1:10:01] of your mind transform into what the
[1:10:05] word wants you to be where you quit
[1:10:07] arguing with the word and making the
[1:10:09] word and say and many times church it's
[1:10:10] just a simple things and and yet we say
[1:10:12] well you know we know a better way or or
[1:10:15] maybe I feel like or I'm LED this
[1:10:18] direction and and what what you realize
[1:10:20] you got to do what God says first he's
[1:10:22] not going to lead you away from his word
[1:10:25] amen he's not going to influence you but
[1:10:28] the way we know that the influence
[1:10:29] that's on us is God is whether or not it
[1:10:32] lines up with the
[1:10:34] word so he said be renewed in the spirit
[1:10:38] of your mind put on that new put on the
[1:10:40] new man which after God is created in
[1:10:44] righteousness and true Holiness so you
[1:10:46] have a new creation you are a new
[1:10:49] creation put it
[1:10:51] on right wear your new creation
[1:10:56] wear your salvation walk in it let it
[1:11:01] shine are you with me now so this is
[1:11:04] what putting on the new man will do
[1:11:06] Ephesians
[1:11:07] 4:25 wherefore putting away
[1:11:10] lying putting away I the old man he was
[1:11:13] a
[1:11:14] liar right come in the worlds say well
[1:11:17] not my old man
[1:11:19] yeah right the
[1:11:22] former right Ben PR was a liar
[1:11:26] the former brother Harold whoever you
[1:11:28] speak of the most imminent Christian but
[1:11:30] you were a liar the Bible says you were
[1:11:33] all of us were but but we put away lying
[1:11:37] yeah speak every man truth with his
[1:11:40] neighbor for we are members one of
[1:11:44] another now again and we're taught what
[1:11:47] a neighbor is it's that the person next
[1:11:50] to us it's not just those in the in the
[1:11:53] household of faith but but the one that
[1:11:56] we have an opportunity our paths Collide
[1:11:59] and you find that teaching where Jesus
[1:12:01] taught about the Good Samaritan who who
[1:12:03] is the neighbor
[1:12:06] now we put he said speak every man truth
[1:12:08] with his neighbor we're members one of
[1:12:10] another some people say brother BR said

[1:12:26] but don't condemn me to gamble on the
[1:12:29] internet on that's what they do now
[1:12:32] don't condemn me to play bridge in my
[1:12:33] bridge party he said you know why you
[1:12:36] ain't got nothing to condemn that don't
[1:12:39] hurt my conscience he said that's pretty
[1:12:41] hard but glad he said he said you got no
[1:12:43] more conscience than a snake has
[1:12:48] hips snake ain't got hips no
[1:12:50] more you ain't got no conscience there
[1:12:52] ain't nothing there to hurt you you're
[1:12:54] of the world said but I challenge you to
[1:12:56] let Jesus Christ come in here and try to
[1:12:58] do it one time brother you'll be so
[1:13:00] condemned you'll back off and shake your
[1:13:01] head from that thing just a certain as
[1:13:03] I'm standing here how can you tell a lie
[1:13:05] and not be condemned by
[1:13:07] it come on church that's the old man
[1:13:09] that could do that Paul says put off
[1:13:11] that old man don't be a liar right said
[1:13:16] well to my benefit to lie exactly that's
[1:13:18] the time when you got to tell the
[1:13:22] truth but you find that a person that
[1:13:24] lies will lie whether to their benefit
[1:13:25] or
[1:13:26] not I still
[1:13:29] lie you know your body doesn't believe
[1:13:31] you when you lie let me just preach our
[1:13:33] young people I know well brother are you
[1:13:35] preaching to me let me just preach our
[1:13:36] young people we all can agree that the
[1:13:38] young people need it
[1:13:40] right do you know your body doesn't
[1:13:42] believe you when you tell a
[1:13:44] lie do you know that when you lie your
[1:13:47] body says he's a
[1:13:53] liar Peter has a
[1:13:58] twitch Peter's a a truth telling young
[1:14:01] man but he does have a twitch if he
[1:14:03] tries to to hide something he
[1:14:07] twitches and uh and we figured that out
[1:14:10] me and brother jph had fun with him
[1:14:11] before we tried to get him to say
[1:14:12] something wasn't true and he just
[1:14:15] Twitches cuz you're not used to it your
[1:14:17] body your body will tell on
[1:14:21] you you get sick you're you're living in
[1:14:24] a way that you weren't meant to live in
[1:14:27] brother brandom takes this in a very I'm
[1:14:28] spending time on this for a reason
[1:14:30] brother brandom takes this in a very
[1:14:31] deep way when you're living as a sinner
[1:14:34] your body doesn't like it right right it
[1:14:37] doesn't it wasn't made to live like that
[1:14:40] right and and it doesn't like it your
[1:14:42] mind your mental capacity everything
[1:14:44] about you don't you're living a life if
[1:14:46] you were meant to be a Christian if you
[1:14:48] got a SE of God on the inside of you
[1:14:50] there's something inside of you that you
[1:14:51] know you say well I'll just stay away
[1:14:52] from church for a while no there got
[1:14:54] something inside of you that that calls
[1:14:55] out and that's why you feel so bad when
[1:14:57] you're not in the house of God when
[1:14:58] you're not in Fellowship when you're not
[1:15:00] around people there just something that
[1:15:01] you say well that's just people would
[1:15:03] condemn me no it's something inside of
[1:15:05] you it's not that people would condemn
[1:15:07] you but something inside of you it's
[1:15:08] condemned what is that your body wasn't
[1:15:10] meant to live like that because you know
[1:15:12] what the scripture says right and you
[1:15:14] profess to be a
[1:15:16] Christian right so some of you ladies
[1:15:18] you know that's true if you went out
[1:15:20] here and cut your hair and and you know
[1:15:22] how badly you would feel yeah why CU
[1:15:25] you've been born again
[1:15:27] right go and put a face full of makeup
[1:15:30] or something like that you know how bad
[1:15:31] that would how how that would haunt you
[1:15:34] yeah cuz you're born again I don't say
[1:15:36] that a Christian would never fall never
[1:15:38] do anything else wrong but it haunts you
[1:15:39] doesn't it if you even think you told a
[1:15:42] lie you just there's something about I I
[1:15:44] didn't tell that person all the truth
[1:15:45] sometimes you forget and you tell part
[1:15:47] of a story I've done that before you
[1:15:49] tell part of a story and you get done
[1:15:51] you get home and you realize they
[1:15:52] probably took that wrong probably looks
[1:15:54] better on me cuz the way we generally
[1:15:55] tell our stories is to look better for
[1:15:57] ourselves probably looks better on me
[1:15:59] than it did and don't you realize that
[1:16:02] our bodies even our our makeup is not to
[1:16:04] do that right and yet the world can do
[1:16:08] it why because it's the old man it's his
[1:16:09] way right but we're not called to be the
[1:16:12] old man we're called to put on the new
[1:16:13] man yes he said brother bar taught us he
[1:16:18] said I'm positive sure this morning if
[1:16:21] men and
[1:16:22] women he said could only get into into
[1:16:25] the position where their soul their
[1:16:26] thinking their attitude would be perfect
[1:16:28] in the sight of God would be one of the
[1:16:31] most powerful churches that ever
[1:16:33] existed uh you don't you say well I
[1:16:35] can't do everything right that's not
[1:16:37] what he's asking you to do he said get
[1:16:39] your thinking
[1:16:40] right right your willingness to do the
[1:16:43] word right and if that would happen this
[1:16:46] rest would begin to come
[1:16:48] around right but but when you don't when
[1:16:50] you do things you know is wrong it shows
[1:16:53] up
[1:16:55] you kids know
[1:16:56] that I know none of you ever tell an
[1:16:58] untruth to your parents but when you do
[1:17:00] it hurts don't it bothers you don't
[1:17:02] it
[1:17:05] huh Piper's looking at me she got real
[1:17:10] quiet bothers you Don it when you huh
[1:17:13] when you tell something Melody bothers
[1:17:15] you Don it she said not
[1:17:20] me it ought
[1:17:23] to right
[1:17:25] your body don't like it you find
[1:17:27] yourself sick nervous upset just because
[1:17:31] you your body you're not living right
[1:17:34] and there's a way out of that how just
[1:17:37] live right confess it and I'll say this
[1:17:41] as a parent and I think I can speak for
[1:17:42] most of the parents here we'd much
[1:17:44] rather know what you
[1:17:46] did right than be lied to because we're
[1:17:49] going to find
[1:17:50] out my teacher told me my first grade
[1:17:53] teacher or kindergarten teacher told me
[1:17:55] and she had eyes in the back of her head
[1:17:57] and I believed
[1:17:59] her cuz she knew
[1:18:01] everything everything that went
[1:18:04] on and I still you know my mother was
[1:18:06] that way my mother knew everything she
[1:18:09] was omniscient in our
[1:18:11] house and I want to tell you kids our we
[1:18:14] our parents are
[1:18:17] omniscient they are they're going to
[1:18:18] find
[1:18:19] out they're going to they're you don't
[1:18:23] have the ability to have just just just
[1:18:24] tell the truth and you'll be much better
[1:18:27] off tell the truth don't lie about it
[1:18:29] you weren't made to lie then you'll feel
[1:18:31] so much better you might get a whooping
[1:18:33] but it won't be near as hard as once
[1:18:34] they find
[1:18:37] out the hard things to lie you know
[1:18:40] don't just don't lie to me I've tried
[1:18:42] not to I don't know why I'm getting off
[1:18:43] on this but I've tried not to discipline
[1:18:44] my kids from making mistakes I might get
[1:18:47] frustrated with them but if you you know
[1:18:49] if you you you break something you mess
[1:18:52] something up you something like that
[1:18:54] then you know I may yell at them for not
[1:18:56] paying attention but but as far as for
[1:18:59] doing that that's I try not to get mad
[1:19:00] at them over that but but if you lie
[1:19:03] about it if you try to cover it up
[1:19:06] that's the problem we want our kids to
[1:19:08] be able to talk to us you can be so
[1:19:10] legalistic you know and and come down so
[1:19:12] hard on people when they do wrong that
[1:19:14] they'll never there'll be times your
[1:19:16] kids do wrong they need to come talk to
[1:19:17] you they need to be comfortable doing
[1:19:20] that but don't don't lie it'd be so much
[1:19:23] easier you need tell the same story
[1:19:25] every
[1:19:26] time right and nobody's told a lie I'm
[1:19:30] not preaching to anybody that's just
[1:19:32] what the word
[1:19:33] says right as far as I know sir but they
[1:19:37] they have a thing called a lie detector
[1:19:39] he said you can put it on your wrist s
[1:19:41] it across their head you can get in
[1:19:42] there and try your best to make a lie
[1:19:43] sound like the truth it'll register
[1:19:45] negative every time unless you're some
[1:19:47] kind of
[1:19:49] sociopath right because the human was
[1:19:51] not made to lie lying is a deceit hard
[1:19:55] thing evil thing he said I'd rather have
[1:19:57] a drunkard with me any day than a liar
[1:20:00] he said a liar and your body wasn't made
[1:20:01] to lie no matter how sinful you are
[1:20:03] you're still a fallen Son of God the
[1:20:05] most sinful person in this city today
[1:20:07] God didn't intend you to be sinful he
[1:20:09] wanted you to be a son of daughter of
[1:20:11] his he said you're made up in his own
[1:20:13] makeup but sin has caused you to do that
[1:20:15] he said no matter how much you try to
[1:20:17] impersonate try to make a lie seem right
[1:20:19] he said they got a scientific in
[1:20:21] instrument that proves that it's wrong
[1:20:23] you can tell it with all the Innocence
[1:20:24] you want to but it'll still register
[1:20:26] negative because there's a subconscious
[1:20:28] down in the human being and that
[1:20:30] subconscious knows what's truth and no
[1:20:32] matter what you're saying out here that
[1:20:34] subconscious knows that it's a lie and
[1:20:36] it'll register off the subconscious he
[1:20:38] said therefore if a man or woman could
[1:20:40] ever get their thoughts and their
[1:20:42] testimony and their lives so lined up
[1:20:43] with God he said until the channel of
[1:20:45] the holy spirit will be perfectly one
[1:20:48] with God what would take place do you
[1:20:50] want to see the supernatural do you want
[1:20:52] to see God move do you want blessings in
[1:20:54] your life
[1:20:55] maybe it's just simple as just telling
[1:20:57] the
[1:20:58] truth being honest with yourself being
[1:21:00] honest with God people usually lighted
[1:21:03] themselves
[1:21:07] first he said if the man and woman could
[1:21:09] ever get lined up where with the freedom
[1:21:11] from their heart with Faith from the
[1:21:14] innermost see you say well I can be
[1:21:16] saved yeah but we want to be have
[1:21:19] freedom right to be able to do the works
[1:21:21] of
[1:21:23] God you're light is your
[1:21:26] testimony right and if you don't keep
[1:21:28] your word you don't keep your
[1:21:31] testimony that's just the truth you're
[1:21:34] still saved but you told a lie now you
[1:21:36] your testimony is
[1:21:38] tarnished what do you have to do repent
[1:21:40] of that repent to the person you lied to
[1:21:43] yeah he said if I don't keep my word I'm
[1:21:45] not a man of my word if you don't keep
[1:21:47] your word you're not a man of your word
[1:21:49] he said I might promise you something I
[1:21:50] couldn't do it but I'll come tell you if
[1:21:52] I owe you something and hide from you
[1:21:53] I'm a hypocrite
[1:21:56] if I come tell you I owe you but I can't
[1:21:57] pay you but I'll do the best I can he
[1:21:59] said then you forgive me and help me he
[1:22:01] said we all owe God something we owe him
[1:22:03] our lives he said let's be honest about
[1:22:06] it brother Brown used this in altar
[1:22:07] calls he said you weren't made to lie he
[1:22:10] said Don't Lie To God Be honest with
[1:22:11] yourself if you need help look for help
[1:22:14] seek help don't lie and say you're a
[1:22:16] Christian if you're not believe the word
[1:22:18] and become a
[1:22:20] Christian and then stand on
[1:22:22] that he said I don't care what side you
[1:22:25] say you're on what you do every day
[1:22:27] proves what you are you've heard the old
[1:22:30] saying your life is so loud I can't hear
[1:22:31] your testimony see your actions are so
[1:22:33] loud he said I've always believed in
[1:22:34] shouting and jumping but I've always
[1:22:36] said don't jump no higher than you live
[1:22:38] cuz the world is going to watch that you
[1:22:41] must just jump as high as you live CU
[1:22:42] somebody's watching you he said people
[1:22:44] won't come to church many of them just
[1:22:46] won't do it and some of them he said not
[1:22:47] coming is sincere people they' seen so
[1:22:50] much corruption in the church until they
[1:22:52] don't want to have anything to do with
[1:22:53] it I say let's change that let's not be
[1:22:57] part of that
[1:23:00] story many times we're speaking on a
[1:23:02] flat thought of that you can hardly
[1:23:03] blame them said the way the people act
[1:23:05] he said they call themselves Christian
[1:23:07] the greatest stumbling block the world
[1:23:08] is God is the man and woman who
[1:23:09] professes to be a Christian and live
[1:23:11] something different from the profession
[1:23:13] he said now The Sinner The Bootlegger
[1:23:14] The Gambler the adulterous he won't be
[1:23:16] disappointed to hear his sentence read
[1:23:18] to depart to Everlasting fire he won't
[1:23:20] be disappointed but that fellow who's
[1:23:21] trying to hide himself behind some kind
[1:23:23] of church Prof
[1:23:25] that's the boy's going to be
[1:23:26] disappointed at the day of judgment he
[1:23:29] said always don't judge your life by how
[1:23:30] much power you have to perform Miracles
[1:23:33] are we listening church he said always
[1:23:36] judge yourself look back and taking
[1:23:38] inventory of what kind of a fruit that
[1:23:40] you the life you presently live is now
[1:23:44] bearing yes that's what Paul's talking
[1:23:46] about brother Brandon preached what Paul
[1:23:48] preached yes Ephesians 4:26 be
[1:23:52] angry that's why you don't take
[1:23:54] scriptures out of context by the way
[1:23:56] take the first part of that you could
[1:23:58] just have a license to be angry but he
[1:24:00] says and sin not yeah let not the sun go
[1:24:04] down upon your wrath other words don't
[1:24:06] hold grudges we preached about that
[1:24:07] recently don't be difficult for the sake
[1:24:10] of being
[1:24:11] difficult right verse 27 neither give
[1:24:14] place to the devil don't give him an
[1:24:16] opportunity to get in between that
[1:24:18] relationship and cause trouble make it
[1:24:21] right verse 28 let him that stole steal
[1:24:24] no
[1:24:25] more but rather let him
[1:24:29] labor I know you said brother Ben wasn't
[1:24:32] the world are you doing this is so
[1:24:33] simple I know not to lie and not to
[1:24:37] steal church if we can't if we don't
[1:24:39] preach this what are we going to
[1:24:41] preach what is our next Generation going
[1:24:43] to be yeah right at some point they got
[1:24:47] to hear it and I got to hear it we've
[1:24:48] all got to be reminded of it don't lie
[1:24:51] and don't steal still part of the Gospel
[1:24:55] huh let him the sto steal no more rather
[1:24:58] let him labor working with his hands the
[1:25:02] thing which is good he may have to give
[1:25:04] him that needeth and I I always I'm
[1:25:06] reluctant to preach this always because
[1:25:08] Paul deals with it so
[1:25:10] much but I'm reluctant to preach it
[1:25:12] because the wrong people always get the
[1:25:13] message people who are trying and I'm
[1:25:16] aware more than anybody of how difficult
[1:25:18] it is to make a living especially in our
[1:25:20] area I'm I'm well aware of that I I know
[1:25:23] how ult is I know how hard you got to
[1:25:26] work but I did it and and I've been
[1:25:29] there and done that I know what it's
[1:25:31] like and I know there's people that do
[1:25:33] it and and and a man's got to
[1:25:36] work just there's just no way around
[1:25:39] that that's our and so when a man's not
[1:25:41] working that's why I hesitate to preach
[1:25:42] it many times because you make people
[1:25:44] feel bad they're trying everything they
[1:25:45] can do maybe they're unemployed or they
[1:25:48] less employed than they want to be I've
[1:25:49] been there too not making the money they
[1:25:52] want and so that they feel convicted
[1:25:53] over that
[1:25:55] and and that's not or maybe a a woman
[1:25:57] has to work and she feels bad cuz well I
[1:25:59] have to work but that you know I I the
[1:26:02] way it ought to be many times it's not
[1:26:04] the way the devil set things up where
[1:26:06] it's very difficult to make it on one
[1:26:07] income I get that but we still have to
[1:26:10] preach the truth to our kids but you
[1:26:13] ladies shouldn't feel bad that are
[1:26:14] trying very hard very my my father died
[1:26:17] my mother's had to work since sin and
[1:26:19] and different ones of you're in
[1:26:20] different situations where you have to
[1:26:21] work and and you've got to do that to
[1:26:23] make ends meeting the family and I'll
[1:26:25] say this a Christian will
[1:26:27] work they asked they asked brother brand
[1:26:30] said should a Christian work he said a
[1:26:31] Christian is the one who will
[1:26:33] work right a Christian work a mom works
[1:26:36] even if she's at home she's working and
[1:26:38] I've told you many times before but if
[1:26:40] she has a job out in the public she has
[1:26:41] two
[1:26:43] jobs right Christian will
[1:26:46] work and but if a a man refuses to work
[1:26:49] he said working with his hands the thing
[1:26:50] which is good he may have to give to him
[1:26:52] that needeth see that's B basic
[1:26:56] Christianity and what we're doing if we
[1:26:58] don't do what the word says is we're
[1:26:59] putting a basket over our light now I'm
[1:27:02] preaching I want this Young Generation
[1:27:03] to understand this I think most of our
[1:27:05] generation My Generation above you know
[1:27:07] this it was ingrained in you to work but
[1:27:10] but I think our younger generation is
[1:27:12] kind of losing that a little bit I don't
[1:27:14] want to sound like an old fogy this
[1:27:15] morning but but I think we're kind of
[1:27:17] losing that idea that man was made to
[1:27:19] work because we got everything so easy
[1:27:22] anymore but it's getting where man
[1:27:24] managers won't hire people from their
[1:27:26] 20s and
[1:27:28] under they won't hire them and we've had
[1:27:30] experienced some difficulty with that
[1:27:32] even with my kids getting jobs because
[1:27:34] they won't hardly hire them because
[1:27:35] nobody wants to work because your
[1:27:37] average teenager is going to be on their
[1:27:39] phone the whole time right and going to
[1:27:41] quit on a moment's notice cuz they got
[1:27:45] offended and all of you who' had a
[1:27:47] career for any length of time you
[1:27:49] recognize you can't be like
[1:27:51] that right and again I'm not talking I
[1:27:54] know people feel bad sometimes I've
[1:27:55] known men who were on disability and had
[1:27:57] to be and they felt bad because they
[1:27:59] weren't able to work them more well
[1:28:00] that's cuz that's their Covenant that
[1:28:02] you were made to work but yet there's
[1:28:04] Grace for that God give you that ability
[1:28:06] and there's great I know some of y'all
[1:28:07] brother Bill sometimes goes out and get
[1:28:09] puts wood in that fire when he shouldn't
[1:28:11] but a man wants to do his own
[1:28:13] work right and sometimes for the elderly
[1:28:15] it's hard for even do that much but it's
[1:28:18] still
[1:28:19] work it's just part of it it's What
[1:28:21] You're Made to do and and so we don't
[1:28:23] want want to put a basket over our light
[1:28:25] we want to work the New Testament deals
[1:28:27] with this a lot Colossians
[1:28:29] 3:23 you young men listen to me you
[1:28:31] young ladies listen as well because you
[1:28:35] don't want a man that won't
[1:28:39] work he said whatever whatsoever you do
[1:28:42] do it heartily and that that would go
[1:28:44] for church
[1:28:45] too all right whatsoever you do do it
[1:28:51] heartily with all your heart if you're
[1:28:53] going to come to the house of God you
[1:28:54] might as well do it with all your heart
[1:28:56] if you're going to clap your hands you
[1:28:57] might as well clap your hands with all
[1:28:58] your heart if you're going to Rejoice
[1:29:00] you might as well Rejoice we might as
[1:29:02] well have church act like we belong here
[1:29:04] whatever you do do it heartily as to the
[1:29:06] Lord not to
[1:29:09] men and you know I'm not trying to make
[1:29:11] life harder on you say well if I work
[1:29:13] it'll be harder but no life becomes
[1:29:15] easier when you have
[1:29:17] money and the way to get money is to
[1:29:21] work then if you'll pay your tithe and
[1:29:23] fulfill your obl
[1:29:24] let me tell you something you're robbing
[1:29:26] yourself if you don't do that right
[1:29:29] that's what you're doing is just robbing
[1:29:30] yourself and you're not robbing me or
[1:29:33] the church God will provide but but we
[1:29:35] rob ourselves of a blessing but but a
[1:29:39] Christian will work and again I don't
[1:29:40] want you many you older folks that maybe
[1:29:42] you get out of a job or you get through
[1:29:44] a hard financial situation I've been
[1:29:45] there I know what it's like when the
[1:29:47] bank's about to take your house I know
[1:29:49] what that feels like I get that that's
[1:29:52] part I've never been wealthy like some
[1:29:54] of y'all you know but I just never we
[1:29:56] never had much money but I always paid
[1:29:59] my TI and I've confessed to you before
[1:30:01] sometimes I didn't like to I didn't
[1:30:04] understand when I was young the
[1:30:05] importance of it but as I got older I
[1:30:07] was thankful that I
[1:30:09] did and I still do and and there's a
[1:30:13] reason for that a Christian there
[1:30:15] there's things that you do see we live
[1:30:17] in a world where the devil's going to
[1:30:18] come at you with everything he's going
[1:30:20] to come after you and tell you you're
[1:30:21] not a Christian you don't belong you're
[1:30:23] not this you're not that he's going to
[1:30:24] come after you all the that's his job is
[1:30:26] to come after you don't give him room on
[1:30:29] don't give him space do what you know to
[1:30:32] do right do what you know to do and then
[1:30:34] you're not giving him room to come after
[1:30:36] you every moment and and attack you on
[1:30:38] what on your faults are you with me now
[1:30:41] we got plenty of faults without not just
[1:30:43] not doing what we know to do there's
[1:30:46] lots of things you have to deal you'll
[1:30:47] do things in life that memory will hold
[1:30:49] you all the rest of your life you'll
[1:30:50] remember that thing but yet the blood
[1:30:52] forgives you of those things the blood
[1:30:54] cleanses you from all sin how many
[1:30:55] believe that today yet that memory will
[1:30:58] be there you got to deal with that don't
[1:30:59] deal with this little stuff little foxes
[1:31:01] spoil the vine let get it
[1:31:04] right you can do
[1:31:08] that so if you if it don't apply to you
[1:31:10] don't sh Don't Fit Don't wear it but if
[1:31:12] it does put it
[1:31:16] on knowing that of the Lord he said you
[1:31:18] shall receive the reward of the
[1:31:20] inheritance for you serve the Lord
[1:31:21] Christ yes he that doeth wrong shall
[1:31:24] receive for the wrong which you have
[1:31:25] done there is no respect to persons
[1:31:27] words yours is not a special
[1:31:29] case there's no respect to persons let's
[1:31:31] do the right thing again in 1
[1:31:34] Thessalonians 4:9 as touching brotherly
[1:31:35] love you need not that I write unto you
[1:31:38] for you yourselves are taught of God to
[1:31:39] love one another isn't that wonderful
[1:31:42] that's a wonderful scripture he said
[1:31:44] indeed you do it toward all the Brethren
[1:31:45] which are in all Macedonia but we
[1:31:47] beseech you Brethren that you increase
[1:31:49] more and more that's what we're trying
[1:31:50] to do this morning I know you you you
[1:31:52] want to do what's right you wouldn't be
[1:31:53] here this morning if you didn't want to
[1:31:54] do it right but continue in that
[1:31:57] increase in
[1:32:00] that you study to be
[1:32:04] quiet but he's not talking kind of wish
[1:32:07] he was you know you just use that on
[1:32:08] everybody you be quiet study to be quiet
[1:32:11] but that's not what he's saying he's
[1:32:12] saying he's saying don't study to live a
[1:32:15] life without
[1:32:17] drama we can put it in modern terms to
[1:32:21] do your own business to work with your
[1:32:23] own own hands as we commanded you that
[1:32:26] you may walk honestly toward them that
[1:32:28] are without that you may have lack of
[1:32:31] nothing oh my that's what we want isn't
[1:32:34] it you say well what does this have to
[1:32:36] do brother we're in the end time we
[1:32:38] don't we shouldn't have our focus on
[1:32:40] work and these things when we're at the
[1:32:41] end time no that's the time we need to
[1:32:44] amen you realize where this is what have
[1:32:46] we been reading from first Thessalonians
[1:32:48] 4 who knows what else is in 1
[1:32:50] Thessalonians 4 what's 1 Thessalonians
[1:32:53] 4:13
[1:32:54] come on
[1:32:55] now well come on Church what is the rest
[1:32:57] of that chapter I would not have you be
[1:32:58] ignorant Breen of them concerning them
[1:33:00] which you're asleep Paul immediately
[1:33:02] goes into the Rapture
[1:33:06] amen it matters more than we think it
[1:33:08] does immediately goes into teaching on
[1:33:11] the Rapture right after teaching on work
[1:33:13] with your
[1:33:14] hands because he knew we'd need to
[1:33:16] occupy we need to hear it here at the
[1:33:18] end
[1:33:19] time it' be an age when men wouldn't
[1:33:21] fulfill the responsibility and women
[1:33:23] wouldn't fulfill theirs but there will
[1:33:24] be a bride that will there will be a
[1:33:26] people that
[1:33:27] will brother brand does the same thing
[1:33:29] and and knoweth it not he's speaking of
[1:33:31] the end times he said clean your lives
[1:33:32] up pay your debts oh no man Jesus said
[1:33:37] now I mean he said like your house
[1:33:39] ritten and stuff and people immediately

[1:33:50] something's fixing to happen the Bible
[1:33:52] says it this way in Romans 138 oh no man
[1:33:54] anything but to love one another for he
[1:33:57] that loveth another hasth
[1:33:58] fulfilled the law owe no man anything
[1:34:01] people Mis understood that he they asked
[1:34:04] brother the brand what about that he
[1:34:05] said now someone said should we buy a
[1:34:07] car or what should I he said no that
[1:34:09] isn't what Jesus spoke of that said oh
[1:34:11] no man nothing that's lingering death

[1:34:26] business well I'm just preaching the
[1:34:27] gospel the message the
[1:34:31] Bible I don't want to be involved in
[1:34:33] your personal life I don't want to see
[1:34:34] your bank account I don't want to do
[1:34:35] that my job is to preach it that's right
[1:34:39] I'm not going to treat you any different
[1:34:40] I'm not going to look down on you this
[1:34:41] church isn't going to look down on
[1:34:43] anybody are you with me now we're all
[1:34:45] Sinners saved by grace but my I do have
[1:34:48] a responsibility to preach it so that
[1:34:50] the elect can hear it
[1:34:52] yes don't want to do it and become
[1:34:55] that he said that's ow and no man
[1:34:57] nothing he said it doesn't mean I we owe
[1:34:59] our rent our telephone bill good Lord we
[1:35:01] owe our telephone
[1:35:04] bill we owe these things and we pay them
[1:35:06] but an old lingering debt you could be
[1:35:07] paying on pay it off he said no don't go
[1:35:10] with anything hanging on you like that
[1:35:13] he talked about how he paid the bills
[1:35:14] for medicine when he got sick 25 cents
[1:35:16] at a time I found a news article about
[1:35:18] that about brother brandom and how he
[1:35:20] was struggling trying to care for all of
[1:35:22] his brothers and sisters when he was a
[1:35:24] young man God put our Prophet through
[1:35:26] that for a reason so he'd have something
[1:35:28] to tell us something he had been through
[1:35:30] himself why God calls men to speak to us
[1:35:31] not Angels caus men to speak to us
[1:35:35] brother Brandon went through a time he
[1:35:36] didn't have the money to pay his bills
[1:35:37] but he went to the man he said when I
[1:35:39] get 25 cents I'll pay you that 25 cents
[1:35:42] right he said if I didn't have it I'd go
[1:35:44] tell him I I don't have it this week
[1:35:46] yeah but what was he doing he was doing
[1:35:48] his
[1:35:50] responsibilities he said his good works
[1:35:53] he said some Christian here at church
[1:35:55] one time when I got some work done on a
[1:35:57] car and the man come down the man said
[1:35:58] I'll I get paid Saturday I'll pay you or
[1:36:00] something or another he never paid him
[1:36:02] and weeks after weeks drove by and never
[1:36:04] paid him never said a word and the man
[1:36:06] come and asked me he said it reflects
[1:36:09] against the church it reflects against
[1:36:10] Christ if you can't pay him go tell him
[1:36:12] say I owe you and I'm going to pay you
[1:36:13] I'm a Christian but I just can't do it
[1:36:15] right now I owe this remember it's on
[1:36:17] God's books too yeah he said you know
[1:36:19] that you do but look why he's dealing
[1:36:22] with it it's the same quote he said so
[1:36:24] that's he said I'm trying to for myself
[1:36:26] and for all of us together try to be
[1:36:28] ready yeah he said for we know we're
[1:36:30] getting near something very near
[1:36:32] something's going to take place so we
[1:36:33] want to be ready when the coming of the
[1:36:35] Lord is drawing so nigh now we want to
[1:36:37] be ready for that great hour how many
[1:36:38] want to be ready I just want to be I
[1:36:40] don't want to condemn nobody I don't
[1:36:42] want to look down my nose at nobody I
[1:36:44] just want to be ready every one of us
[1:36:46] can be
[1:36:50] ready I just want to be ready
[1:36:53] Paul famously worked the entire time he
[1:36:56] preached I'm so thankful that you all
[1:36:58] provide so well for your pastor Paul
[1:37:00] worked the whole time and he preached
[1:37:03] right did evangelized the world and held
[1:37:07] a job the whole time when he didn't have
[1:37:10] to they were fully willing to pay to pay
[1:37:14] him ties and he wouldn't take it and and
[1:37:16] he set the example that we should TI
[1:37:18] should be paid but he didn't take it he
[1:37:20] said this he said not because we have
[1:37:21] not power but to make our El an example
[1:37:24] unto you to follow us even when we were
[1:37:27] with you this is we commanded you that
[1:37:28] if any would not work neither should he
[1:37:30] eat he said for we hear that there are
[1:37:32] some which walk among you disorderly
[1:37:33] working not at all but are busy bodies
[1:37:36] he said now them that are such we
[1:37:37] command and exhort by our Lord Jesus
[1:37:39] Christ that with quiet andness they work
[1:37:40] eat their own bread but you Brethren be
[1:37:43] not weary and well-doing in other words
[1:37:44] don't don't look at it as a weariness
[1:37:46] don't look at something that's hard to
[1:37:47] do just do what's required just do the
[1:37:49] right thing you don't have to be a
[1:37:51] legalist there's times you're going to
[1:37:52] not be able to work like you want to
[1:37:54] work you're not going to have the money
[1:37:55] you want to have that's life right there
[1:37:57] were times Abraham the Bible said he was
[1:37:59] a rich man and another time brother
[1:38:00] brand said he was out there Hard
[1:38:02] Scrabble
[1:38:03] farming right that sometimes your life
[1:38:05] goes different directions many times
[1:38:07] good men job look at job job went
[1:38:09] through some things he was a rich man
[1:38:11] become a poor man become a rich man
[1:38:13] again right lost everything got
[1:38:15] everything back but what did he do he
[1:38:18] said I won't condemn God he said I won't
[1:38:20] Curse God I he said I I I bless him he
[1:38:23] said I come naked from the womb I'll go
[1:38:25] naked back to it back back to God I come
[1:38:28] naked from God I'll go naked back to God
[1:38:29] look we are all we are all we are all
[1:38:33] going home one day and I believe we're
[1:38:34] all going home in a Rapture I believe
[1:38:36] that's what we're looking for let's be
[1:38:38] ready don't be weary and wello but let's
[1:38:40] be ready to
[1:38:43] go Paul tells us what to do about it he
[1:38:46] said If any man obey not our word but
[1:38:47] this epistle note that man have no
[1:38:50] company with him that he may be ashamed
[1:38:52] and yet I love the balance Paul brings
[1:38:54] to this count him not as an enemy but
[1:38:57] admonish him as a
[1:38:59] brother so don't be a part of what he's
[1:39:02] doing but admonish him as a brother the
[1:39:05] darkness is
[1:39:07] pressing listen Church you said why why
[1:39:10] are you talking about lying you're
[1:39:11] talking about working and we could take
[1:39:13] so many other areas but the darkness is
[1:39:16] pressing those of the night the night is
[1:39:18] creating a generation of of good for
[1:39:21] nothing people that's right I just be
[1:39:23] not even good citizens not even good
[1:39:26] people in the community but there's
[1:39:28] somebody who will work somebody who will
[1:39:31] live somebody will let their light shine
[1:39:33] somebody will do what the word says
[1:39:35] somebody will provide for their
[1:39:37] family what do you got to do take the
[1:39:39] basket off of your
[1:39:41] life what sometimes that basket's made
[1:39:43] out of things we've been taught that are
[1:39:46] against the word right we've been
[1:39:48] coddled until we feel like well if
[1:39:50] anybody talks bad about us you know you
[1:39:52] know no take the basket off
[1:39:54] let your light
[1:39:58] shine the Bible says let no corrupt
[1:40:00] communication can we just finish this
[1:40:02] this chapter and then we'll I'll let you
[1:40:04] go boy are you ready for brother Joel
[1:40:08] tonight let no corrupt communication
[1:40:11] proceed out of your mouth but that which
[1:40:13] is good to the use of edifying that it
[1:40:15] may Minister grace to the hearers other
[1:40:17] words he said your language gives you
[1:40:18] away let even your words be
[1:40:21] light amen
[1:40:23] and and Peter when he was standing by
[1:40:25] the fire remember what happened he was
[1:40:27] standing there and he said I'm not a
[1:40:28] galileon I'm not one of them and they
[1:40:30] said your language gives you away your
[1:40:33] language gives you away whether you're a
[1:40:35] Christian or not his accent your accent
[1:40:38] gives you away you speak differently you
[1:40:40] can always tell which kingdom a person
[1:40:41] is from by speech the language of the
[1:40:44] kingdom of darkness and death is
[1:40:45] complaining and murmuring and fault
[1:40:47] finding and cynicism cursing and corrupt
[1:40:49] communication trying to Swindle somebody
[1:40:52] trying to make a deal that's wrong with
[1:40:54] somebody but a person living in the
[1:40:55] Kingdom of Light and life speaks
[1:40:57] graciously and kindly using words of
[1:40:59] Hope and Thanksgiving Ephesians 4:30
[1:41:01] grieve not the holy spirit of God
[1:41:03] whereby you're sealed to the day of
[1:41:05] Redemption how many believe if you got
[1:41:06] it you can't lose it you're sealed to
[1:41:08] the day of redemp so don't grieve him

[1:41:27] another even as God for Christ's sake
[1:41:30] hath forgiven you don't you want to take
[1:41:32] that to heart this
[1:41:34] morning brother Brandon saw a
[1:41:38] sign and uh he said I when I see
[1:41:40] something on the road he said I always
[1:41:42] carry a notepad with me so I can write
[1:41:43] it
[1:41:45] down he he saw a billboard it was just a
[1:41:47] blank
[1:41:49] billboard in the middle of it it said
[1:41:51] hungry with a question mark work
[1:41:55] hungry and then at the bottom in small
[1:41:57] words I said three miles
[1:41:59] ahead hungry three miles
[1:42:03] ahead and brother brandom took from that
[1:42:06] and preached a sermon you you let your
[1:42:08] light so shine before men and he said
[1:42:11] we're his
[1:42:13] Billboards we're his
[1:42:16] Billboards right he said just make them
[1:42:18] hungry amen a simple clean billboard he
[1:42:23] said it didn't have a bunch of fancy
[1:42:25] stuff on it he said it cigarette
[1:42:26] companies put some woman up there or
[1:42:27] something like that and beer companies
[1:42:29] that put some some half-dressed woman or
[1:42:32] he said some places they'll put a you've
[1:42:34] seen McDonald's signs had this great big
[1:42:36] hamburger with the with the grease
[1:42:38] glistening off of it you know your
[1:42:40] hamburger don't look nothing like that
[1:42:41] when you get
[1:42:44] it cuz they're trying to make you hungry
[1:42:46] yeah but see our job isn't to make
[1:42:49] people hungry
[1:42:51] yeah but to just comeing contact with
[1:42:54] those who are hungry
[1:42:55] right so this whoever created this
[1:42:58] billboard
[1:42:59] knew that the passer by if they were not
[1:43:03] hungry brother said if they were looking
[1:43:04] for a car they would never
[1:43:08] stop right because I'm I'm out hunting a
[1:43:10] car I don't care it say hungry I don't
[1:43:13] mean nothing to me he said but if they
[1:43:14] were hungry
[1:43:16] yes and they see a simple clean
[1:43:21] billboard with Christ root across your
[1:43:23] life he said men will see your good
[1:43:25] works and glorify the Father which is in
[1:43:29] heaven we don't sell the gospel I had
[1:43:33] studied this earlier in the week and
[1:43:35] then yesterday uh or day before one I
[1:43:39] had some uh some missionaries at my door
[1:43:42] some young men that are missionaries and
[1:43:45] uh they might have come down to brother
[1:43:46] Joel's too yeah they did it and they
[1:43:48] were young men I mean young men I was
[1:43:51] impressed that they were willing to
[1:43:52] speak to me I'm always kind to them guys
[1:43:54] cuz I you know as a kid just full
[1:43:56] confession Dad decided one time we were
[1:43:58] going to be missionaries you know and we
[1:44:00] went to our toown knocked on all the
[1:44:01] doors let me tell you people don't like
[1:44:06] that
[1:44:09] so we got cussed at and everything else
[1:44:12] you know I've also done cold calling and
[1:44:15] insurance if you've ever done if You'
[1:44:16] been in sales done cold calling you
[1:44:19] don't want to do that for the rest of
[1:44:20] your life I still hesitate to pick up
[1:44:23] the phone it's really a it's a it's a
[1:44:25] mind battle to pick up the phone call
[1:44:26] somebody it's why I text usually because
[1:44:29] I'm always thinking what if I disturb
[1:44:30] them because I had to do that and so
[1:44:33] many people cuss you
[1:44:34] out right but brother brand said we're
[1:44:36] not salesmen yeah he makes that point we
[1:44:40] are
[1:44:41] Billboards see the the missionaries that
[1:44:43] come by are trained salesmen come to our
[1:44:46] Sacrament
[1:44:48] service right but but see the message
[1:44:51] the beautiful thing about the message he
[1:44:52] never ask you to go sell the message
[1:44:56] come
[1:44:57] on and sometimes when we go overseas
[1:45:00] people don't understand what we do we're
[1:45:01] not walking down the street with a
[1:45:02] billboard saying message I'm a Believer
[1:45:06] sometimes you get your head cut off
[1:45:07] doing that if we' have done that in
[1:45:09] Cairo we wouldn't have lasted long right
[1:45:12] but what are we doing we're we're among
[1:45:15] them we went to the Pentecostal church
[1:45:17] over there and prayed for their sick
[1:45:19] right preached to them he said well you
[1:45:21] what are you doing we're not trying to
[1:45:23] be a
[1:45:23] Salesman what we're making
[1:45:26] contact and if we make contact in the
[1:45:29] right way and we're the right kind of
[1:45:31] billboard the hungry will see it and say
[1:45:34] there's something different about that
[1:45:35] person something different all church
[1:45:37] for 2025 let's let let let us be a
[1:45:40] billboard to the
[1:45:42] world a simple clean billboard brother B
[1:45:46] taught us we don't sell the gospel
[1:45:47] because we don't want overnight
[1:45:49] conversions
[1:45:50] right we don't want a quick sale
[1:45:53] he
[1:45:54] said he said I want real oldfashioned
[1:45:57] conversion a man or a woman that's
[1:45:59] willing to walk out and say I'm wrong I
[1:46:01] want to become come like my neighbor we
[1:46:04] talked about our neighbor I want to
[1:46:05] become like my neighbor I long to be a
[1:46:08] woman like my neighbor I want to be a
[1:46:10] man like my neighbor I want to walk so
[1:46:11] Godly before men that people think of me
[1:46:13] the same as they did of him I want to be
[1:46:16] like Jesus Christ how many can say Amen
[1:46:17] to that today I want to be like Jesus
[1:46:21] Christ we're not
[1:46:24] salesman why we don't just talk about it
[1:46:26] yeah
[1:46:28] right we're not salesman we want to be
[1:46:31] like Jesus not talk about Jesus although
[1:46:35] that's part of it that's not our primary
[1:46:37] goal we're not salesman we're
[1:46:39] Billboards brandom told about a lamp
[1:46:42] called a mogul lamp or Mogul lamp he
[1:46:45] said they told him at the power company
[1:46:48] when he worked there he had to sell so
[1:46:49] many of them and there was a contest
[1:46:51] whoever sold the most of them would get
[1:46:53] a prize and he asked them he said does
[1:46:56] this thing
[1:46:57] work and they said yeah it
[1:46:59] works it really works it's good will it
[1:47:02] smoke up quickly no will it produce a
[1:47:05] nice light where people like it
[1:47:07] yes so he become convinced that the lamp
[1:47:11] would sell itself now he says this he
[1:47:13] says I did never believed in high
[1:47:14] pressure cells he said I never did
[1:47:16] believe that he said I don't believe in
[1:47:18] these high pressured salesman
[1:47:20] stuff right you've all been in the
[1:47:22] network marketing field you know been
[1:47:24] around it but the brand said I don't
[1:47:26] believe in that where you you push
[1:47:29] somebody to buy he said that's the
[1:47:31] reason I don't believe it in religion he
[1:47:33] said if I've got a product that's good
[1:47:34] it'll sell
[1:47:37] itself so he he talked about this Mugu
[1:47:41] lamp he said I knew that the lamp would
[1:47:43] sell
[1:47:44] itself I knew it was a real product so
[1:47:49] he said he got 200 of them and he went
[1:47:50] by people's houses he said they he
[1:47:53] usually collected the bill and so they
[1:47:55] said are you here we already paid our
[1:47:56] bill he said no he said I want to he
[1:47:58] said I want to lend you something he
[1:48:00] said I got 200 of these lamps I want you
[1:48:01] to use it for two weeks he said then
[1:48:04] I'll come back by and they said well how
[1:48:05] much does it cost he said no he said I
[1:48:06] don't want you to buy it he said I want
[1:48:08] to just let you use it for two weeks he
[1:48:10] said because if it he said what if it
[1:48:12] got broke he said then it's on me he
[1:48:14] said I was willing to take that because
[1:48:15] I was convinced it was a good lamp yeah
[1:48:18] are we convinced this gospel is good are
[1:48:20] we convinced the Salvation that we've
[1:48:22] got is good so brother Brown put those
[1:48:25] lamps in people's houses he went around
[1:48:27] and he just he said use it for two weeks
[1:48:30] 200 of them he said when he got done he
[1:48:32] only picked up I think he said 10 he
[1:48:34] said I picked up 10 out of 200 he said I
[1:48:37] won the contest why the lamp sold itself
[1:48:41] you w't see it and see what it is then
[1:48:44] you want it yeah he said that's the same
[1:48:47] thing we don't have to have big
[1:48:48] organizations to sell Christ we don't
[1:48:50] have to have Highly Educated preachers
[1:48:52] and high polished people it's Mayors and
[1:48:53] different things of the city what we
[1:48:55] have to have is Christ and Christ sells
[1:48:59] himself oh do we believe that today
[1:49:01] Church musicians go ahead and come Jesus
[1:49:04] didn't send his disciples to sales
[1:49:07] training I've been through sales
[1:49:09] training I know what that's
[1:49:12] like Jesus didn't send his disciples to
[1:49:14] sales
[1:49:15] training he didn't say hide the good
[1:49:19] stuff we used to say in the title
[1:49:21] business that the the what the large
[1:49:23] print giveth the small print taketh
[1:49:27] away the gospel doesn't do that right
[1:49:31] but he told him up front if you want to
[1:49:32] be a Christian you're going to have to
[1:49:33] surrender your life
[1:49:36] yes the gospel tells of hardship it
[1:49:39] tells of struggle but it tells of
[1:49:42] Victory as well it tells the truth it is
[1:49:45] the truth he said I am the way the truth
[1:49:48] and the life he didn't send his
[1:49:49] disciples to sales training he simply
[1:49:51] said let your light shine go into the
[1:49:54] city tell your story amen you don't have
[1:49:58] to sell it it'll sell itself through you
[1:50:01] yes as we go into the new year I wonder
[1:50:03] if we could just as a church Lord let me
[1:50:05] take the basket off let me let me put
[1:50:08] the the make sure my lamp is trimmed

[1:50:46] world to know I'm a
