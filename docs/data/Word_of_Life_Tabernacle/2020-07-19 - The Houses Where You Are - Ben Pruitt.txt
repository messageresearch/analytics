storms just like he will mine if i just remember he lives inside so why should i worry why should i fear when this very same jesus he's always so near he lives in my heart and he hears when i cry i'll call on his name till the storm passes by we read in the bible how he walked with him brought light to the darkness when the way grew dim how great it would be to have his footsteps in mine to walk with the master all of the time and when trials come and death seems so nice just call on the master i know he'll be there on time and when sickness comes and my body's in pain all i have to do is call on his name so why should i worry why should i fear when this very same jesus he's always so near he lives in my heart and he hears when i cry i'll call on his name till the storm passes by why

upon a troubled sea ever there's a wind in myself but i have a friend who watches over me when the breeze turns into again [Music] and i know the maker of the rain he can calm the storm make the sun shine again i know the master of the wind sometimes i sword like an eagle to the sky among the peace my soul can be found an unexpected storm may drive me from the heights brings me low but never brings me down for i know the master of the wind i know the maker of the rain he can calm the storm make the sun shine again [Music] i know the master of the wind and i know the maker of the rain he

this morning amen and he's 25 25 right still 25 and holding amen so we certainly appreciate our brother ben amen everything he's helped us with so we certainly appreciate him he's glad he's here amen we got a little gift from the church for him and a little card so uh i went ahead and signed it for everybody so we didn't have to pass it around for kovid so uh i trust maybe the words will be good enough so hey man we appreciate you buddy can't shake hands hey man give him another hand god bless you brother david i appreciate you and all that you do to help us and all of you it's your wonderful church family you can be seated just for a moment i've got several things i want to talk about i don't like doing this i like to come out here and preach but there's some things we need to say and and uh it's good to be in the house of the lord this morning and there's no place i'd rather be on my birthday or any other day than to be in the house of the lord and we had you probably noticed there's a a notice on the board back there about information on the governor's mask mandate some of you have asked me about that and i just wanted to go over a couple of things on that i won't read the whole thing but you can read it it's on the board in the back and also put it on whatsapp so that you can have it on there um we um the mask mandate of course affects us and um the good news is that the people the the mandate states that people who are engaged in religious worship activities which i guess you could say that's what this is are exempt from the law although they strongly encourage face coverings now the thing is the the word there is engaged in and that doesn't cover us outside of the building and so what happens were what could happen theoretically if the local sheriff or whoever decided to enforce the law they could come up here and sit outside the building and give right a ticket for a hundred dollars to every person to come out of the building without a mask on they couldn't do that to us in here but they could outside and so i sent this with aaron mcgarry just to make sure that his opinion agreed with mine on that and he's a licensed attorney and respected in that field and and this is where he put it he said religious worship activities are exempt from the face covering mandate face mask would be required outside the building in a social setting unless social distancing is maintained now again if you can stay six feet away from everybody then you wouldn't have to that's the way the law reads you wouldn't have to wear a mask anywhere if you stay six feet away from everybody then that's hard to do so um but he says that face mask would be required outside the building in a social setting unless social distancing is maintained if you're considering doing religious worship activities outside then the face covering is not mandatory so if we were baptizing someone out here or having an outdoor service while we were doing that we wouldn't have to wear it but then when if you stood around and talked to one another then the religious activity is over and you'd have to you'd be subject to that and and once again that's the law just like a seatbelt law and i don't have to agree with it for it to be the law so uh we it's hard but it's just something that's necessary so what we're going to ask you to do is that is to voluntarily comply we're not going to force this on anyone but if you're 10 years of age or older because people under 10 are exempt thank goodness but if you're 10 years of age or older we're going to ask you to wear a face covering or a mask or maintain a distance of at least six feet from people outside your immediate family while you're on the church grounds you don't have to do that in here but while you're on the grounds once you're seated you can take off the mask that's where the exemption applies while we're having church you don't have to do that and the way you are this morning the way you're seated you're mostly within all of you are spread out in such a nice way and there's some folks that weren't able to come this morning because of sickness and that's something else we've asked you to do if you're sick stay home and that's not normally something we would say because we believe this is a place where you get healing but in this situation we don't want to spread these things around and we want to be responsible and so they've asked us if you're sick with a cold or flu-like symptoms then stay home and uh wait until your symptoms are over before coming back to church and and then that frees everyone else up because there's people that if they saw you and maybe you happen to cough or sneeze in their presence then they're shut in for 14 days and i know what that's like personally and many of you do as well so maybe they can't go to work and so it impacts other people so continue and the rest of the things that we have on there is just things we've already been doing we're not passing an offering plate we're trying to avoid shaking hands or embracing if you're not somebody in your family again this isn't a law this is not something that i'm telling you you have to do this is something i'm asking you to do as your pastor and and because it does affect us and it affects other people and it affects our testimony in the community so please please follow the guidelines if you can and and if you have a sickness or some valid medical reason why you can't wear a mask then obviously you're exempt from that when the service is through the only other thing that that i would ask you to do is that when the service is through let's not try not to congregate in the foyer there's not enough room back there and so we'd ask you especially on a beautiful day like today to just go on out the door and then you can fellowship outside um as much as you want to but there's just not enough room in the foyer to abide by the restrictions that we've been asked to abide by the way the law is written if a community or a county doesn't have doesn't have any cases for 28 days then they're exempt so i want you to pray with me we're an isolated county and i know we've had a case in the last 28 days because i was it but there's um there's a uh there's a possibility that we could be exempt from this and not too long and given that and and we are isolated from most the rest of the state so you be praying with me that god will just allow this to be where we've been protected compared to other churches we've been blessed to be able to have church the way we have and there's churches that are still streaming today and have been since february i know churches overseas that are still locked down and many of them and so there's just it's indefinite they may keep it going forever and thank god that we're able to meet together i believe it's a biblical mandate that we're able to meet together um we're also making an exception for laying hands on the sick i believe that's a biblical you have a right to have hands laid on you if you're sick if you're in need and we will do that for you and so you're welcome to come up here we'll lay hands on you we'll pray for you um if you feel comfortable doing that you're welcome to do that because that's a biblical order we're going to have communion this afternoon we're not doing the foot washing because there's just no way to do that and that that you know it bothers me but there's just no way that we could do it but we're going to do what we can do and uh and so we're going to do communion and we're going to put the uh the bread and the wine in separate cups so that you're not touching all of the bread and you'll be able to take it and you'll be able to come up we'll have someone bring you up uh by family group so that you're able to do that and uh but daniel be in charge of that and he'll need some help this afternoon so we appreciate all of you i know brother mark wanted to be here today and they had a little sniffles and things and they didn't want to spread it and brother allen and his family and and brother bill and sharon white kemp are also watching today because of that and so you'll be praying for them as well we know that our god is a mighty god and he's able to take care of all of these situations he's the master of the wind as both of the specials so eloquently they were singing i felt the presence of the lord that's our situation that we're in but we know he's master of it and there's a reason for it and so we we just ask you to comply with these things if you didn't understand all that i told you as i tried to hurry to go over it it's it's in the back and i also have a copy of the governor's mandate with me if you want to see that and and read it for yourself i have that at my office let's stand together i also want to say thank you to brother david and gabe for doing these bushes out here if you notice the bushes got done in this heat and i failed to do that wednesday night i appreciate that and then uh we had a light replaced but the danny got a light replaced yesterday and and about cut his hand off doing it so he's got a little uh a little bandage for the work that he's done for the church but we appreciate him and and what he's done as well some of you come up here and do things and and i'm so grateful for that it takes such a load off of because a lot of that stuff you know if it don't get done then me and my wife end up doing it and and but you guys have been great about doing those things with harvey moe in the lawn and different things we haven't had to hire those things done and we appreciate that and i want you to know how much we appreciate it going forward amen and i also wanted to say i'm so sorry about your friends today and i you know god is a merciful god we know that and we believe that it's a great thing to be a friend to someone in the bride it's a great thing people don't realize what a wonderful thing that is your friendship and the way you treat people and they treat you can impact where they go and if they make it on that day you can stand for them on that day at the judgment and i'm so grateful for that we have a merciful god you're glad for the message of the hour we wouldn't know these things without that amen amen let's bow our heads together heavenly father we're so grateful to be in your presence we thank you for your spirit that we've felt here already this morning and we thank you for your grace lord that you've placed in each one of our hearts that we can work together as a church to try to do the best that we can we'll make many mistakes lord but we know that you are still in control and you're able to overcome all of our mistakes father and help us to be what we should be to be a light to our community and to our world that we live in and the houses where we live lord i pray that you just speak to each and every one of our hearts lord i don't know every need this morning or ever need this represented lord on the internet but i know that you do and i pray god that you just reach down on every pew and every family in every place lord that you'd just move lord in every situation i know that you can do it i know that you will in your time help us lord to take advantage of what we have lord as we sit together may not be lord something that we just take for granted god the ability to worship you and to preach and to listen and to sing and to raise our hands and say man lord we have the freedom to do that let's do it with all of our heart this morning and we'll give you the praise and the glory and the honor for all you do in jesus name amen amen god bless you you could be seated this morning keep in mind the fellowship hall will be opened between services today if you need to stay so we'll do that i'm thankful this mask mandate didn't take effect until after we did this so the lord was with us there i'm going to read from exodus chapter 12 and i'm going to ask you to stand again i see joel smirking every time that i do this as i said i don't like doing the announcements but it's something we have to do somebody's got to do it exodus chapter 12 and verse 13. i want to title this this morning the houses where you are the houses where you are and i trust it's a blessing to you exodus 12 13 of the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where you are now think about that upon the houses where you are when i see the blood i will pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when i smite the land of egypt i pray the lord would add his blessing to the word once again you may be seated all of us have at least three homes just batting a thousand this morning all of us have at least three homes on this planet we have our bodies are a house or a temple of god so this is a house we have our homes which is the place where we live and the people that we live with and the people that we that we fellowship with and then we have a church home as a part of the worldwide body of christ those are homes houses where we live where we live and i would tell you this morning that there's really no such thing as a homeless christian there's really no such thing as a homeless christian you say well they don't have a house but they may be so poor that they can't afford a roof over their head but they still have a home and paul even tells us that when this earthly tabernacle or house or dwelling is dissolved he said there's another one already waiting thank god for a home brother jt we've got a home and so but here on on this earth we have these homes this is where we live we live in this body we live in our homes with our families and we live in the church home so during these last few months we've been tested in this because there's been times we've not been able to be here we've not been able to be in a home in our church home and there's been times when some even today are not able to be here and and be around and that's important to be together the bible tells us to do that but due to the circumstances there's been times we've not been able to do that and there's been times when we've not even been able to be with anyone even in our homes even our families and some of you know what it's like to be alone to be by yourself and if you're by yourself for very long it's hard because human beings were made to be social made to interact and so you know what it's like to be alone but you know i think god allows that to happen and sometimes i think that this has happened for a reason and i'll get to that in a moment but this pandemic has shifted us away from doing a lot of the things that we enjoy doing in our homes or with our families or with the church and it's taking it where we can't have as many suppers as we used to and we can't do as many things just little things that we like to do to fellowship together sit down at a restaurant and eat together and and do the things that we love to do and it's made it where it's hard to be in that church setting we don't we look at youth camps that have been canceled for the first time in in my memory we look at sunday schools that have been closed we look at youth meetings and dinners and banquets that have been postponed and things that we would normally have and do and not able to do it there's been no end of frustrating for me because every time i schedule a preacher to try to come in and be a blessing to you something happens either he's not able to come because of this or i'm not able to to have him in and so it's created a real problem and a real distraction in our lives but there has to be a reason for it now if you go back in the bible and you look at israel and the way that they were tested and how they were tried every time there was a plague or every time there was a test on them it was for a reason right it was always for a reason god always showed him what what the reason was there was something that happened or there was some reason for it now for the world there wasn't the egyptians had those plagues there was no reason it seemed like for that to happen but when it when it come to the israelites there was a purpose there was a purpose for it god did that and as a bride we're still here on the earth and the fact that we're still here means that god would not allow something like this to happen unless there was a purpose for that to happen right and so it might happen all over the world in all kinds of places but for us who are the bride for this to happen there must be a purpose for us even though it affects everybody but it's a purpose for us and i wonder sometimes if it's not that god wants to strip us down until we get back to that first house which is this body and we begin to recognize we have to be christians here first right and so when you take away all the meetings and you take away all the enjoyment and all the fellowship and everything else and you get down to just this am i still a christian do i still serve god and some of you know what that's like maybe you've been sick or you you end up in hospital room for weeks and months and you're by yourself you know what that's like you get stripped down to am i a christian now not just when i can preach but am i a christian today a few years ago when i turned 30 i felt like i was getting old then but when i turned 30 it seemed like my body started reacting differently and i have stomach problems and and i'm the type of person that loves to eat and i eat whatever i can get my hands on and that become a real problem and and i've got a stomach that just doesn't agree with that and i ended up in the hospital twice because i just ate the wrong thing and and i just don't agree with that and and it happened to me the first time i'd never been in a hospital before i'd only been in a doctor's office once in my life that i can remember and so when i turned 30 i ended up in the hospital and i'm there by myself and i'll never i'll never forget what i forget what that was like because both times that it happened it happened on a on a wednesday when i was supposed to preach both times and it's the first two times in my ministry that i've been preaching since i was 12 years old first time i'd ever had to not preach because i was sick and so i got end up in the hospital i'm there by myself and i thought lord what what is the purpose of all of this and i remember my wife went to i don't know why i'm telling you this this morning but maybe there's a there's a reason but we i ended up in the hospital in jonesboro and saint bernard's and that at one occasion and almost that's an occasion that due to my stubbornness i almost died from not going in and and so i went in and i got rid of the infection of things that i had and i went as i'm sitting there laying there in the hospital thinking what was me what what would be the purpose of this my wife is driving my truck which was a nice truck at the time and she was driving home she left because i didn't want her to keep the kids she couldn't keep the kids up there and we didn't want to ask anybody to keep them so she left went back home she's driving out of jonesboro and the alternator went out on the truck and just stopped dead on the side of a four-lane highway and she just stopped there in the dark with nothing you know in jonesborough and and uh there's a lady that come by her way that just stopped and saw her she actually was walking with all three kids to a gas station because her phone had also went dead so she's walking in the dark along the side of a four-lane highway to a gas station that she could see but it was a ways down there and and this lady stops from jonesboro just just a lady there from that area and she happened to be the wife of a missionary of a preacher and she stopped there and and they got to talking their friends to this day because and it made an impact on her life and and she's watched our family and things like that and watch some of our services and i and i think back at that like i said you don't know what it means to be a friend what if god decided he was going to give eternal life to somebody who maybe would never even be in the message never be around but there'd be eternal life to somebody and he put me in a hospital room so and my wife on the side of the road so so they could meet he said god wouldn't do that we don't know god moves in mysterious ways his wonders to perform and so these things happen for a reason and i think that we've got to get down to the point where we realize and they're in the hospital room i begin to realize how helpless that i really was and we begin to realize we really are helpless we're dependent on on god to help us and keep us healthy and all the things that were dependent on him to heal us we have nothing without him and so every time we experience the test god is doing something in our lives i want us to to look at this because when we get past the singing and the worship and the preaching and we get past the fellowship when you go home today you've got to be a christian and i've got to be a christian and so these houses if you look at it like this that there's the house of your body there's a house the home that you live in there's the house of god and as you begin to look at these things you realize that if you're not a christian here in your body you won't apply the token to your home right so it's impossible to just be a christian here in your home and not be a christian here and it's impossible to you may act like a christian look like a christian but if you're not if you're not a christian here in your body you won't be a christian at church even though you might assimilate with all the other christians and so first corinthians 6 and 19 speaks about this first house our bodies it says what knowing not that your body is the temple of the holy ghost which is in you which you have of god and you are not your own you're not your own you don't we we look at the rights that we have we have certain rights over our bodies and even the the people the abortionists today would say it's my right to kill my baby what a what a convoluted idea it's my right but but see our body as christians is not our own it doesn't belong to us it was redeemed was bought with a he said your body is the temple of the holy ghost which you have of god and you're not your own for your bought with the price therefore glorify god in your body and in your spirit which are god's glorify god in your body and in your spirit which are gods and what that means is that there's more responsibility than just as an individual agreeing that the message is true or that the word you hear preach here is true but it's more than that all that does is make you a hypocrite if you don't live it it's more than just agreeing that it's true but in the old testament the individual worshiper had to be identified with the lamb so it just comes down to the individual and the lamb and that's what i think maybe if you could look at it that way and i'm not trying to be spiritual or anything but just look at it like that that during this time we begin to realize that it's just the blood between us and the death angel that's all that staff stood between israel but the caleb and the death agent was the blood and it's all that stands this morning between you and the death angel it's the blood and that's what it got down to the church they couldn't congregate together and have a feast day or have a big meeting but they had to come in the houses where they were and in those houses they had to learn to be christians they had to be under the blood they had to apply the token so you had to be identified with the lamb and so the lamb he would take his lamb and he would take it up to the to be sacrificed and he lay his hand on the head of the lamb and feel the blood leaving its body he had to feel blood leaving his body brother branham type that to us so we have to to feel the suffering of christ we have to be so invested so identified with it that we feel it so it makes sense that that we we know it's more than just a an idea that he died but we know that he died for us it does something to us we get the blood all over us and yet in that time the blood cell could not come back on them the life that was in an animal couldn't come back on them because it was an animal life but now we have the life of christ and brother branham deals with this in the token on the one that he preached in february of 1964 he said that's what he was requiring that night to separate the believers from the unbelievers the believer worshiper was identified with the sacrifice he must apply the blood it wasn't take and kill the lamb set the blood out there somewhere keep it in the charger take it down to the neighbors he had to apply the blood he had to apply the blood i wonder if god's not showing us that we have to apply the blood at home that if we become dependent on a man somewhere or church somewhere or somebody else somewhere to be the blood for us to be our our savior but no we have to apply the blood in the houses where we are and so brother brown says he had to apply the blood he said that's the way it is tonight we could come and sympathize with everything god does that isn't what god requires you've got to apply it you believe that this morning you've got to apply it it's not sufficient until you apply it the blood must be applied to be just like we talk about that seat belt ticket you can sit out there and drive down the road and the policemen stop you and you're not wearing your seatbelt and you can say well why aren't you wearing your seatbelt you say well i agree with the law i completely agree with that i believe the seat belt law is a good law i believe you should wear one i believe everybody should wear a seat belt but if you don't have one on you're going to get a ticket i remember when i was younger somebody told me you got to be careful what people tell you but somebody told me that if you if a cop pulled up and saw you putting your seatbelt on that they would give you a ticket but if you were honest about it just left it off they wouldn't i don't know who told me that but it wasn't right because i got pulled over with my brother and i'm sitting in the passenger seat and walk up there's here in arkansas somewhere and we walked up there and and he looked at me and my brother snuck his on and i'm sitting there with no seatbelt on he said why aren't you wearing your seatbelt said is there a reason why you didn't put it on after i stopped you well i got the ticket i mean but see you have to put it on you have to actually be identified with it you have to actually do it or it doesn't do you any good and so we could come and sit sympathize with everything god does that isn't what he requires you've got to apply it it's not sufficient until you apply it the blood must be applied that shows that you are identified the worshiper laid his hand upon the lamb and then killed it identify himself with the sacrifice he said the same thing we do tonight let's lay our hand upon our sacrifice and identify ourselves with him he said and he is the word we have to be identified only through christ is when we're identified by the word because he is the word always has been now i want to kind of dig a little deep plow a little deep because i think that we need to understand this being able to feel the presence of god in a church service it's not a substitute for being born again not a substitute for being born again you may feel it and it's wonderful and i a man but the man said the beliefs god can feel god and know it feel his presence know that he's there i believe in that but it's not a substitute for being born again because being born again has nothing to do with how you feel and so brother branham taught us in 1957 on the door of the door for several years there brother branham cowed down on this because pentecost had gone into emotionalism only and tongues being the evidence of the holy ghost and brother branham just fought that everywhere he went he preached at it and he said you accept him as some sign or some wonder or some emotion or some evidence he said the evidence that christ is in the heart bears the fruit of the spirit faith love joy peace long suffering gentleness patience it's the fruit of the spirit and he later on clarifies how that we know because we can say amen to every word right and so but he said that's the fruit of the spirit he said but we have confused it with other things divine healing gift speaking with tongues oil in the hand blood in the face some little sensation we've confused the real spirit of god with that and accepted something bogus instead of the person christ in the heart he said you see what a condition the church the full gospel church has got into it's the laodicean age to bring to pass the very word that our blessed savior spoke there in the bible lukewarm danced by the music shout and clap hands he said oh them things are all right but if christ isn't there when the hand clapping's over when the speaking with tongues are over and the healing service is over when the music stops we've been through a time like that when all this is over when the music stops he said it's that deep settled peace them doors of faith standing wide open to let him be lord over the situation not unless you shout in church and dance in church but whether he's lord over the coronavirus whether he's lord over cancer whether he's lord over diabetes whether he's lord over sin that's the door of faith being wide open to allow him to be lord over the situation it doesn't do us any good to play the music or clap our hands or speak in tongues or have a healing service he said we led him so far but now lord he said he said you stay back there you might have done that to brother so-and-so sister so-and-so to their child but my case is different he said it isn't different you're the one that's making the difference by keeping him out of your faith door he said you see what i mean he wants inside there do we believe that this morning he said he wants inside there so he just pushed to open the door and expose all your unbelief that's the very reason why we don't want him in there isn't it but he wants inside he wants inside how can he come inside we have to invite him in we have to open that door he said you just push open the door and expose all your unbelief and become lord of the situation that's what we need that's what we need a lot of churches that have music and i love music and a lot of churches that have preaching i love good preaching but what we need is him to become lord of the situation see life brings emotion it always does anything without emotion is dead but life is not emotion it brings emotion brother randall says i think our pentecostal days have become a stink and he's referring to in the old testament when he said the sacrifices and offerings become a stench to god a stink in his nostrils and he said i think our pentecostal days have become a stink we play the music and jump up and down the aisles and dance and run up and down we don't have much of a problem with that in our church but but i i and i you know i would be all for that i am for that but that's not life right he says and and women with cut hair and lipstick on their faces and things like that and run around here dancing in the spirit with a dress on it's tight enough to put the skin on the outside and we expect god to meet us in such a system as that never will he do it he said you know god don't come to your terms you come to his terms where you don't come at all you see this house this house for the fam this house but david is it's got to i'm trying to stay away from you here this house has got to have the token applied because if it doesn't it'll revert to its natural state and that's the state that paul talks about oh wretched man that i am who shall deliver me from the body of this death this this cankering body that is dying that that is decaying that is sinful who shall deliver me amen and if that if he is not lord of the situation if he is not open in every part of our heart in our life if that token is not applied to our life to this house we revert to our natural state of being a sinner brother brown says god never did deal never did in any time take any group of people to do anything god takes an individual you're the one you one person god never changes this program because his first program he must always remain with that program the days of noah he had one man noah the day said he brought israel out he had one man that was moses we know of dates and many of the others tried to think well they had the same authority and so forth you know what happened to them the days of the coming of the lord the days of john the baptist the different ones he has one individual he works with listen he had one prophet for this age no other man has the same authority no pastor no other prophet no other person no matter who he is has the same authority as that one that god called that individual he said he has one individual he works with and he deals with us today as one individual not as a group one person it's going to be up to you and i of how we stand before god because he's dealing with you and i as individuals not as a group that we're in not as the denomination church we belong to but as you and i as individuals later on in that sermon he said now when israel come over the river of jordan he said now try to catch this when israel crossed over into the land the promised land there was a gentile woman we know as rahab the harlot and she asked for mercy and she received mercy she received mercy as long as she stayed under the scarlet cord he said and that's the only way she could have mercy it was a sign a token that was given her we have a token today also and we're safe as long as we stay under our scarlet core the blood of jesus christ as an individual not a group an individual we each must stay under that scarlet cord of the blood of jesus christ you go back and read it and we'll talk about the house here in a moment that includes rehab as well as an individual rahab had to apply the token for the saving of her household so this house had to apply the token for this house are you with me now this house had to display the token for this house had to display the token for this house so it was a sign a token that was given her that it would not be an individual not a group but she had to do it and even the people told her we'll look at it in a moment they said if anyone goes out or comes in or whatever he said if they go out from under it you're not responsible and we're not responsible but if they stay under the blood so each individual is responsible in that way now so that's our first house it's this house this house is not taken care of you're never i don't care how well you can preach how well you can sing how well you can testify how much you say you believe the message if you don't let him be lord of the situation in this house you're never going he's never going to be lord in these other two houses you're going to have problems at home you're going to have problems in the church you say well that's for if you're a preacher or singer no it's for every one of us now so once the individual is born again his whole house then i love this can be saved it's the house is where you are what's that that individual he had to apply the blood but then his house could be saved and cornelius when when peter was sent to cornelius and peter's telling the story in acts chapter 11 verse 13 he showed us how he had seen an angel in his house which stood and said unto him send men to joplin call for simon whose surname is peter who shall tell thee words i love that who will tell you words whereby thou and all thy house should be saved he's going to tell you words he's going to tell you about how jesus died how how he rose again on the third day and by those words you're going to be saved as i begin to speak he said the holy ghost fell on them as on us at the beginning but notice what it said whereby thou and all thy house shall be saved and that word house is actually household it's not the building it's not just your your home that you live what we call a home but what we call our family today it would be a household back then and it would include everybody under your roof and in in in your domain so it could be a servant it could be your business everything that belonged to you right was in your household now some have smaller households than others but you have something that's a home to you we find this in the philippian jailer as well in acts 16 29 says he called for a light and sprang in and came trembling and fell down before paul and silas remember they had the earthquake and he thought all the prisoners were gone and paul hollered out and said hey we're still here you talk about faith paul had it i'd have been looking for that door you know to escape out of there paul you know you think about them other prisoners that didn't have you know weren't saved didn't know who paul was and they're ready to go and paul says wait a minute we're all still here but he he brought them out and and said sirs what must i do to be saved and they said believe on the lord jesus christ and thou shalt be saved in thy house why because an individual would believe bad look at the power of one individual that will believe he said your house will be saved they spake it in the word of the lord and to all that were in his house notice they went ahead and preached to those in his house they still had to hear the word but they said because of your faith they can be saved oh i'm holding on to that today i'm holding on to that they may leave for a while they may get crazy they may they may do all kinds of things but i'm holding on to the fact he said you and all your house can be saved and they speak unto him the word of the lord and to all that were in his house and he took the same hour of the night notice how quickly he acted he said i believe in the same hour of the night wash your stripes and was baptized he and all his straight way i love the way that says it he and all his he said everything in my house we're getting baptized today he and all his straight way and people today say well you can't tell your kids what to do well i kind of think he was a little bit urgent to his house you need to be baptized today get them on that same hour little urgent in his house you need to be baptized today i think we need as long as our kids are under our roof to to be firm in what we believe huh i excuse me i i'm comfortable this morning you forgive me for that sometimes you get too comfortable but you know you get to you look at things and i watch kids my kids go to school with or went to school with and you watch the way they dress and i think who bought the clothes why would any grown woman want her 12 or 13 or 11 year old daughter to dress like that why why and and you find out the kids run the house and if mom had had a problem with it she couldn't say anything because she has to ask permission well my daughter's learned that if she's going to wear something new and if it's going to be and she likes to look pretty and excuse me esther for using you this morning but she likes to look pretty and she'll you know she wants to wear something that's fashionable and all she knows she's going to have to show it to me because if not when i see it i'm going to say something i don't that ain't going to work you can't wear that to church can't wear that out in the public and she knows i'm going to so she got to where she'd come to me and and say what how do you like this you know because she knows i'm going to and her mama will as well but if her mama buys it then i have confidence that it's going to be all right because i know she wouldn't buy her clothes like that right but but again we're responsible for our house i'm responsible if my kids run around cussing and drinking and stuff while they're at home it'd be pretty hard to do right now but i'm responsible for that responsible for my house god help us you know i believe we serve a god that is has keeping power yes i believe he has saving power he can save someone who's been there and done the worst thing but i'm a testimony in my life that god has keeping power he's able to keep you out of those things away from those things and i'm so thankful for that and if you really kept then you you don't have an arrogant spirit about it but you you thank god for it every moment because you know what you could be and you know what you could have done but for grace you know how close you came to the steward to doing something that would have impacted your life completely right if you've been if you raised in a message maybe there was a time you could think back and look and see there was a time i almost made a decision to do something but thank god he protected me he was with me and then i i finally got to a point where i could make some decisions that were right and god began to influence my life and i was born again and then things began to go a certain direction but there was a time i could have went any either way but the hand of god was on me i believe in a god like that it's our house we're responsible for it rahab and joshua 2 18 said behold when we come into the land thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou just let us down by and thou shall bring thy father my mother my brethren and all thy father's household home unto thee because at that time in that time period she wouldn't have had a legal household that would have been her father's so he said even your father's household that belongs to you oh my and it shall be that whatsoever shall go out of the doors of the house into the street his blood shall be upon his head we will be guiltless whosoever shall be with thee in the house his blood should be on our head if any hand be upon him brother branham says in the token in in september of 1963 he said believe for safety he said then apply see believe he said here's what you want to believe for see you want your own safety you believe for your safety and then apply the token for the whole family i think that applies to the situation we're in now too you want safety you believe for safety and then you apply that for the whole family you say how can i do that claim it if it worked on you then you and the word becomes one very bad see it works for both of you he said you and the word are one then apply it to your children apply it to your loved ones like rahab did she applied the token to her father she applied it to her mother she applied it to her brothers and sisters and got them all in you apply it and then he's going to tell you how to do it he said say lord i'm going after my son i'm going after my daughter i claim her now you all know if you have grown children you can't literally go after them you try to drag them to church this morning but joe wouldn't go too well probably if you had to drag them but you know how do you go after them in prayer in faith you go after them and then what else can you do you can talk i told the folks back at the obvious a few years ago we were going through the token series and i spent about a year doing that and we went through all of that and i told him i said you know every one of us has to be able to talk especially if we're in a position of authority and i know it's harder for some people than for others someone who's just uncomfortable talking to our children but we have to be able to do that we have to be able to at least present the basic gospel to our children to at least be able to tell this is how you get saved and that's not it is something we preach across the pulpit but that's on its most basic level our responsibilities that's applying the token to our house this is how you get saved this is how this is what baptism is this is what it means this is what communion means when you should or shouldn't take it this is what these things mean you have to be able to you may not be the most eloquent speaker be able to explain it but you have to be able to at least talk to them or get them to someone who can talk to them right because if you can't talk to them about it then you it's hard to get them to understand because faith comes by hearing and many of them will never hear me preach but they'll hear you talk right and then you do it that in the right way and be a friend to him and all those things but he said you say i'm going after my daughter i claim her satan you turn her loose amen i'm coming after i apply my type my token the holy spirit oh holy spirit that lives within me catch my daughter there i'm going to her now with your anointing upon me amen we have to apply it to our house brother brown this is a well-known quote and you've heard it a million times but i want to put it here because it matters it still matters but the problem said what do you do when you apply it to your house you move all the trash out get all the short skirts and the shorts and the carts and cigarettes and the televisions whatever more kick them out the door when you go apply the token it won't stand still for it yes sir he said take it all out and over the years we've taken this quote i know and and taken televisions and then that be the one thing you have to kick out he said kick a bunch of other stuff out too it's anything that keeps you from god john wesley's mother gave her son the definition of sin and she said sin is anything that keeps you that steals your time or that keeps you from having a close relationship with god get rid of it if it's in between you and god get rid of it he said when you go apply the token it won't stand still for it yes sir take it all out the dances the parties rock and roll old vulgar newspapers the stuff that's of the world kick it out the door say we're cleaning out this place around here he said like jacob did he said told his wife and all them said wash your clothes and everything put away them gods he said you know what joshua said before crossing over he said wash your clothes come down at your wives and so forth to get ready for within three days we'll cross jordan listen church we're about to cross over it's getting close we're at the end time we're about to cross over let's get it out you say well i don't have a television i don't i don't have that but whatever it is jesus said if your eye offends you pluck it out he's making a point whatever it is take the extreme measure that you need to take to get rid of the thing that's keeping you from god if there's some room that you won't let god in because in that room is that thing that's keeping you from god or that idea or that complex or whatever that it is in that room and you keep that door shut you're gonna have to get rid of it before you cross over aren't you glad for the grace of god that gives us the token so we can get rid of it gives us the ability to open up we can never do that on our own but we can open up those doors and say here it is lord here it is joshua 24 14 says now therefore fear the lord serve him in sincerity and in truth put away the gods which your father served on the other side of the flood in egypt and served you the lord and if it seems evil unto you to serve the lord choose you this day whom you will serve what's the brother brandon talking about when he talks about kicking the stuff out your house this house now you've cleaned this house this house is right with god but it's time for this house to be right with god your household he says if it seems evil unto you to serve the lord choose this day whom you will serve whether the gods which your father served or on the other side of the flood or the gods of the amorites in whose land you dwell but as for me and my house we will serve the lord by the time we had somebody would stand up and say that everybody else you can't let what other people do dictate what your life is i've seen people that were so invested in what their parents would do or what their children would do or god had to show me that personally in my own life that no matter what other people do you've got to serve god and if you spend all your time worrying about what they're doing you have no time to be a christian yourself the best thing you can do for them is let them go let commit them to god pray for them and be a christian and that's hard to do i know that it is because i've had to do it i look he said choose this day whom you will serve best for me in my house we're making a commitment we're going to serve the lord the third house is the body of christ and i'm going to quickly go through this so that we can close the bible teaches us that the body of jesus christ was the house of god he said a body has to have prepared me the body has to have prepared me and so that was the house of god and so now when jesus died he it says in first corinthians 12 27 now you are the body of christ right and how does that happen on the day of pentecost we have it in measure he had it in full measure he was the fullness of the godhead bodily right and now we have it by measure we have a measure of christ but it's the same but rather if you took a spoonful out of the ocean and and he said that's the ocean everything that's in the ocean is in that spoonful so you have god in you you are the body of christ and members in particular but together corporately or over the entire you could say the entire universe for the entire world you are a part of the body of christ you don't exist by yourself but we could say so that's your home that's where you belong and you have a church home somewhere local body that you belong to your partner you don't belong to it because you wrote a put a name out or your name on a piece of paper you filled out a survey or you do certain things but you belong to it because biblically you do what god said to do and you attend there and you and you congregate together you worship god together so you belong there now how you behave as we said in these other two houses matters to the church you can't separate those things you can't apply the token to just one or the other so i'll be a christian when i come to church you can't do that i can't do that i can't make my ministry different from my life you can't make your walk with god different your walk in the world different from your walk with god and so joshua 7 and 10 the lord said to joshua get the up wherefore lifestyle thus upon thy face now remember this is after ai and the children of israel had been defeated and there was a reason every time israel was defeated in battle there was a reason because they were undefeatable if that's the word they were there was no one that could overcome israel so when they lost there was a reason for it and they lost the battle and joshua gets on his face you see he knew that ultimately the responsibility was right there with the leadership and the lord said get up wherefore i shall thus upon thy face israel has sinned they've also transgressed my covenant which i commanded them notice what he says israel has sent they didn't all do it they didn't even all know about it but they've also transgressed my covenant which i commanded them for they have even taken of the accursed thing and have also stolen and assembled also and they put it even among their own stuff and aiken probably said this is just me i'll just take this and i'll go into the tent and get it nobody saw me i'm gonna keep this for my family my family will have gold they'll have this nice garment they'll have this this will be for my old age maybe my my social security no one else will see it it doesn't impact anybody but god saw and it we do in this house i hope you're hearing me today we're spiritual beings you recognize that we're spiritual what you do in this house what you do in this house the house you live in at home impacts what you do here and how you act here and aiken could have said it's just me it won't affect anybody he sneaks it back into his tent but it affected not just one person or some people but everybody in joshua 7 24 and joshua and all history with him took aiken the son of syria and the silver and the garment and the wedge of gold and his sons his daughters and his oxen his asses his sheep his tent why'd they have to destroy the tent you know he said we don't want to be identified with it at all all that they had they brought them into the valley of acorn joshua said why is that troubled us the lord shall trouble thee this day oh israel stoned him with stones and burned them with fire after they had stone with them stones this is extreme remember they were under the law i'm going to go to something else in just a moment they raised over him a great heap of stones under this day so the lord turned from the fierceness of his anger or before the name of that place was called the valley of acorn to this day that's all they could do aiken had done something so wrong that all they could do was just get rid of him destroy him destroy his family destroy his tent they destroyed this house and this house to save the house of god the people of god but don't you see that if you could get this house saved and this house saved redeemed as though they never did it in the first place very bad then that brings peace to this house we don't stone people today thank god for that i've reminded my kids a couple of times i know some of you fathers had you probably wouldn't admit it but of the punishment for disobeying your parents in the old testament thank god you don't live in the old testament you'd be stoned already no there's no instance that i know of in history where that ever happened but it was just it was an extreme punishment an extreme punishment because their parents would have to turn them in for that to happen and so that was a hard thing but aiken was stoned in his family we don't do that today we don't cast people out we don't do that today we don't cast people out why because of mercy because of grace and i'm so grateful that i was not cast out of this program because i made mistakes you made mistakes we don't get cast out but we're like the woman that was caught in adultery remember they were going to stone her according to the law and jesus come and wrote something in the sand he looked up he said he that was without sin here's a stone throw it and every one of them but a joke from the oldest to the youngest because as you get old i guess i can i can hang on to that today on my birthday as you get older you get understand a little bit more just how much of a sinner you were and and as they got older from the oldest to the youngest they left quietly because none of them was without sin every one of them deserved to be right there with her jesus was the only one who could have stoned her amen he didn't do it but what'd he say neither do i condemn thee oh look at the grace of god go sin no more so it's an awesome concept it's different than what what joshua had to do with he said go sin no more yes what you've done is impacted all these things but go sin no more and god can be with you go sin no more you can change the situation now brother branham always takes that and it says go send him more go disbelieve no more whatever brother whenever jesus would say that he says we have been given mercy and and what no that's that's what i'm saying to you we've been given mercy but if you won't take advantage of mercy in these houses this house your home you won't have mercy here in the congregation the congregation won't stone you the people won't judge you but you'll end up falling away because you failed to take advantage of mercy here mercy at home can you see it today church i don't mean to to pound you with these things but it's just what's on my heart and i have to preach what god tells me to preach if you don't take advantage of mercy in this house and this house the house of god will feel the impact aiken was destroyed his house was destroyed but listen before that happened innocent soldiers died and brother branham picks it up and presuming he said i can thought this little wedge it won't make any difference in today's communion day i want us to just examine ourselves and we don't have to to make a big show just examine ourselves when we leave here say lord i want to make sure that i'm right and i'm completely under the blood i've let you in every door in my my heart is open to you he said this little wedgie won't make any difference the rest of the ladies are cutting their hair i'll do the same thing it won't make any difference but what did it do it never brought pleasure to his family listen to that it never brought pleasure to his family he got it to bring pleasure to his family he said i'll do this but if i don't if i work seven days a week if i don't do if i keep all all these things and i i don't i'm not around the church when i get old then i'll give to the church and i'll have to give to my family no it never brought pleasure to his family oh when i get old i'll serve god but i make compromises now because in the workplace they they expect that and in other places they expect me to be a certain way and look a certain way so i'll make compromises in my life it won't make a difference i'll serve god one day but it never brought pleasure to his family it brought death to every one of them he said when we compromise on any commandment of god to please the people we kill the thing right there one little wedge one babylonian garment stopped the marching army brother one thing he said that we permit the church to do this wrong one thing that we won't call out against you realize where that puts me where that puts me as a minister of the gospel let's do it as a minister where that puts us one thing that we won't call out against make the people straighten it up it'll stop the march of the church they presume you're going on we may be in name we may be in numbers i think what counts that isn't what counts it's god with us god in us god moving through us is that what we want this morning his word alive in us he said don't presume that you don't presume that you know that he says don't presume that you know that god's in you don't don't presume that you know that god's with you because when they took the ark of the covenant and and hoffney and fine house have been doing what they'd been doing they went into battle with the ark of the covenant confident that it would save them confident that they would bring them victory against the philistines and it was taken and when the ark of the covenant was taken and finney house's wife heard about it and she and she was dying in childbirth she she named their son ichabod the glory of god has departed they didn't recognize it till it was already lost god's with me in my sin no he's not he's not with me and my sin either only when i make things right he's with me in the sense that he leads me to repentance but he doesn't condone my sin he doesn't bless my sin he said don't presume that you know that god's with you don't presume that you know that watch the way it makes you live the attitude you take towards sin he said why you think about a holy god did you ever think that one you're going to stand in his presence and give an account for this word and for christ when god is so holy setting yonder in eternity you know i think we need to we need to get an understanding of the holiness and awesomeness of god we need to understand who we're talking about god that created the heavens and the earth the god that can make that called us out of sin and make every little circumstance he knows everything that we've ever done in every little circumstance of our life we serve an omniscient and i'm not present god god who's everywhere who knows everything we serve an awesome god we serve a holy god and when we do things and i heard someone saying it just really stuck with me when we do things that are wrong especially in a position like mine or even as just a christian we know we're a christian but we do things we know are wrong when we do that we deny the omniscience of god because we tacitly tacitly anal acknowledge that if he knew about it he would do something about it but we say he doesn't know just by the way we act he said did you ever think that one you're going to stand in his presence and give an account for this word and for christ when god is so holy setting under an eternity when 10 million sons would be black spots before him so holy even the angels look filthy in his sight angels before him are filthy he said do you expect you and i with his word and the blood of his son to cleanse us from sin walk right over his commandments walk out into the world and expect to stand there blameless when you knew better than to do it oh church he said church better be straighten it up don't let us he said let us not presume this because we're bigger number than we used to be we're more financially better than we used to be we got better buildings than we used to have we would dress better clothes than we used to have we had better cars than we used to have but oh brother i wonder about christ how much is he with us that's it he said we're just presuming he said we have bigger numbers we have bigger buildings so we know he's with the snow how much is he with us how much is he really with us he's with us when we're with his word we're standing under the washing of the water of the word i want to talk to you about grace as we close musicians come before the death angel ever came the grace of god provided a token for the houses where they were at what grace that is to us today i don't want you to leave here thinking judgment or condemnation i want you to think about grace it's his grace it gave them a prophet with a message that said apply the token that's grace that's not judgment it was grace the egyptians had judgment they didn't have a prophet to tell them but but the israelites had a prophet to tell them apply the blood amen we've had a prophet to tell us these things is grace listen it's his grace that gave him a prophet with a message his grace provides a home like i said when we this body is dissolved we have another body waiting his grace provides a home a place where the token can be displayed i heard a story of a poor brazilian neighborhood and a young lady and her mother lived in that neighborhood and she was the girl become discontented with her home place she dreamed of a better life in the city one morning she slipped away breaking her mother's heart her mother knew what life on the streets of brazil would be like for a young attractive daughter her mother hurriedly went to find her mother knew her daughter had no way of earning money she also knew that her daughter was too stubborn to give up and so she went to searching through bars and hotels and nightclubs any place with a reputation for streetwalkers or prostitutes she went to them all at each place she'd went to a drug drug store and took a picture a black and white photo of her face and at every place where she went she left a picture of herself a little picture taped on a bathroom mirror attached to a hotel bulletin board fastened to a phone booth on the back of each photo she wrote a note it wasn't too long before money ran out she didn't have she wasn't able to search anymore she went home a few weeks later the daughter was in a hotel one of those countless hotels because as the mother knew her life had driven her that way and she was in a hotel and she noticed that she'd come down the stairs a small photo of her mother taped to the bulletin board she ran to the bulletin board and she pulled it off she looked on the back and this is what the mother had written whatever you've done whatever you have become it doesn't matter come home please come home that's grace whatever you've done it doesn't matter come home there's a token at home for you there's a there's a power that can cleanse you from every sin there's a blood that is effective come home and she did let's bow our heads do you know the songs softly and tenderly jesus is calling we're just going to sing that together and i don't as i

we need them to come home and sometimes what needs to change is not so much them but us and our attitude of faith towards them to claim them to believe but david told me a story one time about that how he claimed his children and one and it was just over from that point he believed it i thought god let me do that just from that point it's over i believe it let me let me have confidence that you're they're going to come home and so much so they'll be like the father that was waiting and he saw the prodigal son come he was able to run to him come home amen we believe god can do that god can wake him up in the middle of a pig pen amen so you believe that today as we come together again at three o'clock for communion we won't start having regular services yet i haven't gotten all of
