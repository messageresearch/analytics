[37:31] amen it says to everything there is a
[37:34] season a time every purpose under the
[37:37] heaven a time to be born a time to die a
[37:40] time to plant a time to pluck up that
[37:43] which is planted A Time to Kill and a
[37:46] time to heal a time to break down and a
[37:49] time to build up
[37:50] a time to weep and a time to laugh a
[37:53] time to mourn and a time to dance time

[38:13] a time to keep silence and a time to
[38:16] speak
[38:17] time to love and the time to hate a time
[38:20] of war and a time of Peace what prophet
[38:23] he that worketh in that we're in he
[38:26] labereth have seen the travail which God
[38:28] has given to the sons of men to be
[38:31] exercised in it
[38:32] he hath made everything beautiful
[38:35] in his time can you say praise the Lord
[38:38] God bless you you can have your seats
[38:40] this evening
[38:42] well I could take for a few moments
[38:44] something that we've been preaching on
[38:47] here for the last several months on God
[38:50] makes everything beautiful in his time
[38:52] and
[38:53] and I like the minister maybe on walk on
[38:56] just for a little while tonight and and
[38:58] uh
[39:01] here's brother Stewart done an
[39:02] outstanding job this morning and
[39:04] God's good brother it's a good man
[39:08] good preacher and
[39:09] and uh
[39:11] I cherish his friendship
[39:14] but he says here God will make
[39:16] everything beautiful in his time second
[39:19] Corinthians tells us before we walk by
[39:21] faith and not by sight and we realize
[39:25] that brother Brown tells that the new
[39:27] Christian or new uh New Testament
[39:29] Christianity is based on a church that
[39:32] is an action and we believe that that uh
[39:36] that uh
[39:37] that there is a time and a season for
[39:40] all things and and just because we're
[39:43] going through the mountains or the
[39:45] Bluffs or the hard times or bad times or
[39:48] low times amen we believe that God's got
[39:51] it all in control and he it doesn't
[39:53] change who you are doesn't change your
[39:55] identity and amen but God wants a church
[39:58] that is inaction and not just a lip
[40:01] service and you know not just saying
[40:04] amen from the lips but actually living
[40:06] that life of Jesus Christ in a dying
[40:09] generation they've been this world so
[40:11] wicked has fallen apart but he said in
[40:14] the evening in time there shall be light
[40:16] and and I believe we're looking at some
[40:18] light here of this evening amen but God
[40:21] even saying the gospels he would tell he
[40:24] said when the lepers came unto him and
[40:26] and was you know asking for prayer and
[40:29] asked him for healing and he said you
[40:31] know go make yourself known unto the
[40:33] priest and the scripture says as they
[40:36] went amen they began to receive their
[40:39] healing amen so we realize that God
[40:41] wants us to act upon God's word amen not
[40:45] just a lip service but actually
[40:47] punctuating the word with an a man not
[40:50] from the list but the life that we live
[40:53] do you believe that
[40:55] now Hebrews chapter 12 says and the
[40:58] second verse says looking unto Jesus the
[41:02] author and the finisher of our faith and
[41:06] we realize that brother Brown told us
[41:07] you know just keep steady
[41:10] just keep walking on and watch the end
[41:13] and just keep steady just keep moving on
[41:15] and Paul would tell us being confident
[41:18] in this that he that begun a good work
[41:20] in you was going to perform it he's
[41:23] going to bring it to an end and another
[41:24] word there just means oversight
[41:27] God's got it we either believe God's got
[41:29] it all in control tonight or we don't
[41:32] but I believe tonight that God's got
[41:34] everything under control amen nothing
[41:37] catches God off guard amen we serve a
[41:40] powerful God that knows every time a
[41:42] flea bats his eyes every every grain of
[41:46] sand that's on the seashore amen God
[41:49] knows everything about our lives God
[41:52] knows every problem that's in the church
[41:54] God knows every situation in our homes
[41:57] amen and God believe tonight amen God's
[42:00] got it all in control
[42:02] hey Benny you know we don't as our
[42:05] finite Minds we don't understand why and
[42:08] how and and why isn't it happening right
[42:11] now hey Ben but if we believe that God
[42:13] is a good shepherd hey Ben how many
[42:15] believes he's a good shepherd ain't been
[42:18] though nothing happens without him
[42:20] knowing about it amen and I say he's got
[42:22] our intent good intentions it is mine
[42:27] it says faith is the victory that
[42:31] overcomes the world now he says I'm
[42:34] going to read these really fast but
[42:35] these are some things brother Brown says
[42:36] on faith faith knows no circumstance
[42:39] Faith knows no defeat Faith knows no
[42:43] reasoning Faith knows no difficult Faith
[42:46] knows no fear Faith knows where he's at
[42:49] Faith acts Faith holds on
[42:52] it can't move Faith knows no shock Faith
[42:55] knows no it's done Faith knows no
[42:57] hindrance Faith sees the sun beyond your
[43:01] stormy clouds faith cannot be stopped
[43:04] faith is the key that unlocks the door
[43:08] faith is the victory
[43:16] so hope brother Brown would tell us hope
[43:18] is on the outside
[43:20] hoping it was in
[43:22] but faith is on the inside looking out
[43:26] saying the battle is already over and
[43:29] the victory has been won
[43:31] nothing can stop a believer
[43:34] on his way to meet the promises of God
[43:38] say it would be nothing
[43:40] can stand in the way of a Believer going
[43:44] to meet the promises of God and the
[43:46] scripture says there's no weapon formed
[43:49] against you shall prosper
[43:52] so shall we quit or shall we stop or
[43:55] shall we retreat no doubt that's what
[43:58] David was with entertaining in his mind
[44:00] when he began to ask God shall I pursue
[44:06] and God's answer to David was pursue
[44:10] don't stop don't quit don't give up
[44:13] God's got it all in control
[44:16] for thou shall surely overtake them and
[44:20] without fail recover all say praise the
[44:23] Lord
[44:24] and the prophet would say when the enemy
[44:26] comes in like a flood the spirit of God
[44:30] will raise up a standard against it and
[44:33] he says hallelujah he said let's go the
[44:37] winds are blowing and the prophet says
[44:40] set yourselves
[44:43] don't worry about your neighbor this
[44:45] evening set yourselves
[44:47] and right in the face of the storm
[44:51] God will make this trial a blessing
[44:55] you believe it
[44:57] even in your season of hardship
[45:00] even in your season of pain
[45:03] God still got it all in control
[45:07] amen and it's up to you and I this
[45:10] evening if we can be appalling Silas
[45:14] in the midst of season of hardship when
[45:17] they were they were tortured and they
[45:19] was made fun of and they were
[45:21] standalized
[45:23] but right in the midst of a Midnight
[45:25] Hour
[45:26] Paul began to praise His God right in
[45:30] the midst of their hardship silence
[45:33] began to lift his hands up and say I
[45:35] don't know what you've come to do but I
[45:38] come to praise my God they've been in
[45:41] their season of hardship
[45:43] they were still walking with God
[45:48] Romans 8 28 says all things work
[45:52] together for the good to them that love
[45:55] God and who are those that called
[45:58] according to his purpose
[46:01] whether it's sickness brother Brown says
[46:04] whether it's prison whether it's death
[46:07] where it's Sorrows whatever it was they
[46:11] would it would still work out for your
[46:14] good can you say praise the Lord
[46:18] no matter the what season it is walk
[46:21] with God
[46:23] doctor says you're going to die brother
[46:25] Brown says walk with God doctor says you
[46:28] can't walk with God just walk with God
[46:32] he said for God has promised you I like
[46:35] this promise I'll never leave you or
[46:39] forsake you I'll be with you to the end
[46:42] of the world and he took an oath by the
[46:45] Covenant that he gave you that he would
[46:47] confirm it and brother Brown says just
[46:50] walk with God he said listen to what he
[46:52] says you'll have your ups and downs
[46:56] come on somebody in other words you're
[46:59] going to have your bad days you're going
[47:00] to have your down days and he says don't
[47:03] worry you got to go through the Briar
[47:06] patches over the sharp rocks over the
[47:08] Bluffs down over the hillsides up
[47:11] through the mountains over the waters
[47:13] but walk with God you're gonna make it
[47:16] Church
[47:17] Hallelujah no weapon formed against you
[47:21] can prosper it cannot stop a believer
[47:24] that is walking by faith for the joy
[47:27] I'll never leave you
[47:29] your family can lead you
[47:32] your family can forsake you
[47:35] churches might leave you friends might
[47:39] forsake you
[47:40] but God says they can but I can't
[47:47] they can leave you but I can't
[47:50] they might but I won't
[47:53] Force by never failing promise
[47:56] I'm going to be with you
[47:58] I'm gonna follow you
[48:00] I'm going everywhere you go I'm going
[48:03] right

[48:13] is one thing for sure I'm not going to
[48:16] lose one of you you might be going

[48:21] sufficient in other words it's enough
[48:24] for you to get out of the slump that

[50:04] Romans 4 says talking about Abraham
[50:07] being not weak in faith he considered
[50:09] not his own body now dead when he was
[50:12] about a hundred years old neither yet
[50:14] the deadness of Sarah's womb and he
[50:16] staggered nod at the promise of God
[50:18] through unbelief but was strong in faith
[50:21] giving glory to God and being fully
[50:24] persuaded what he had promised he was
[50:26] also able to perform and the prophet
[50:29] said Abraham he never let he didn't let

[1:02:30] Christ walk with him all things are
[1:02:35] possible
[1:02:38] I say you're an invincible Army if
[1:02:41] you're walking by faith with God
[1:02:46] look he says look what these fine
[1:02:49] doctors said a while ago
[1:02:51] he comes to this end of the role then
[1:02:54] trust God
[1:02:56] there you are the science is all right
[1:02:59] as long as you're climbing up that tree
[1:03:02] and when you get as far as up as you can
[1:03:05] go no father step over on the tree of
[1:03:08] faith and just keep on walking
[1:03:11] because it has no end to it all things
[1:03:15] are possible to them that belief tree of
[1:03:19] knowledge and science it's got its
[1:03:21] limitations but the tree of faith is
[1:03:24] unlimited the tree of science destroys
[1:03:27] and brings death but the tree of Faith
[1:03:30] builds up and brings life
[1:03:34] my brother man would identify science as
[1:03:36] good but when it's ready scores
[1:03:40] when he ran out the fires you can go
[1:03:42] with science
[1:03:44] like the woman in the in the in the the
[1:03:46] New Testament that stepped over after 12
[1:03:49] long years of Fallen the tree of
[1:03:52] knowledge and science
[1:03:55] over on the tree of faith
[1:03:58] Hallelujah
[1:04:00] and then Jesus was making a statement
[1:04:02] like this somebody touched me
[1:04:05] virtues gone out of my body
[1:04:08] I say is the same Jesus this evening
[1:04:12] if we could touch him with that caliber
[1:04:14] of faith we can stop Jesus in his tracks
[1:04:18] tonight
[1:04:19] hey Ben I say if you've been walking on
[1:04:22] the limbs of Science and you be and you
[1:04:25] feel like a failure feel like there's no
[1:04:26] way Escape you feel like there's no way
[1:04:29] you could ever get over that depression
[1:04:31] or oppression or sickness I say there's
[1:04:34] a tree of Faith tonight that you could
[1:04:37] step on over on it ain't been where all
[1:04:39] things are possible
[1:04:41] if only you could believe
[1:04:45] hallelujah how many believe that
[1:04:50] then brother Brownwood tells us
[1:04:51] testimony
[1:04:53] talking about this daddy he went to pray
[1:04:55] for this boy he said he went to a
[1:04:56] hospital
[1:04:57] and the doctor Batman said I wouldn't
[1:05:00] bother with him said the boy might die
[1:05:02] any moment
[1:05:04] so brother Brown said so I went nailed
[1:05:06] across the bed and the boy was
[1:05:08] unconscious and I put my hands upon the
[1:05:11] boy and prayed just a few words of
[1:05:13] prayer I said father God I do not
[1:05:16] understand but this poor old man is
[1:05:18] crying out and asks me to come here and
[1:05:21] the only thing I know to do is ask you
[1:05:23] and I say I pray that you will spare
[1:05:26] This Boy's Life In The Name Of The Lord
[1:05:28] Jesus Christ
[1:05:30] and the old father turned around
[1:05:34] oh Father turned around to his mother
[1:05:36] and put his arms around her neck and
[1:05:39] they began to hug one another wrapping
[1:05:41] their tears from their eyes saying isn't
[1:05:44] it wonderful
[1:05:46] isn't it wonderful mother
[1:05:48] and I looked

[1:05:54] she just could believe science
[1:05:56] Mr Robin that's all she could see was
[1:05:59] what the instrument was saying
[1:06:01] and she was snickering and making fun
[1:06:04] and they begin to hug one another and he
[1:06:07] looked over to mother and said think of
[1:06:09] it
[1:06:10] Bob's gonna be well
[1:06:12] Hallelujah
[1:06:14] and their boy was still standing there
[1:06:16] unconscious
[1:06:18] still looked like there was no hope
[1:06:21] but the father could turn to his mother

[1:17:14] yesterday I beg to differ for you I was
[1:17:17] preaching the same thing in Georgia last
[1:17:19] weekend and I came to this place and I
[1:17:21] began to talk about how she lifted her
[1:17:23] hands and lifted her feet
[1:17:25] and there was a lady who her sister
[1:17:27] sister Henry's Brian Henry's wife
[1:17:31] and she's been suffering with the
[1:17:32] arthritis for many years
[1:17:35] and the testimony of her husband told me
[1:17:37] the next morning she came up too but she
[1:17:40] sister Jackie she was suffering for many
[1:17:43] many months many years I don't know but
[1:17:46] I know this that she was suffering the
[1:17:47] last three or four days really bad
[1:17:50] and brother Brian told me he said I was
[1:17:51] watching her struggle through the
[1:17:53] service she couldn't be still she was
[1:17:54] hurting suffering so bad in church but I
[1:17:57] came to this place and there was such an
[1:17:59] atmosphere of faith that was built up in
[1:18:01] its Tabernacle not because I was
[1:18:03] preaching and because God began to drop
[1:18:06] down in that Tabernacle and say I've
[1:18:08] been like God they healeth all about
[1:18:10] diseases
[1:18:12] and I said stand up and that lady in her
[1:18:15] pain stood to her feet and when she got
[1:18:18] to her feet Billy Joel that arthritis
[1:18:21] left her body and Brian said I got to
[1:18:24] looking at her and her face began to
[1:18:26] change she was so ecstatic that just few
[1:18:30] moments ago she couldn't even hardly
[1:18:32] stand up without somebody helping her
[1:18:34] and she made her way out right there
[1:18:37] where brother Mike is and came walking
[1:18:39] down this road right here and she came
[1:18:41] up to the prayer line or not the prayer
[1:18:43] line she just come up testify so I got
[1:18:45] something to say the Lord touched me
[1:18:47] standing right there I didn't have hands
[1:18:49] laid on me but there was a spirit of
[1:18:51] faith in the Tabernacle and I said if
[1:18:53] God can do it for her God can do it for
[1:18:56] me
[1:18:57] Hallelujah ain't been the next day
[1:19:00] brother Brian says I got I got those
[1:19:02] looking at her walking up in the house
[1:19:03] she had a spring in her step she was
[1:19:05] moving like she hadn't moved in months
[1:19:09] I say Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[1:19:12] today and forever
[1:19:15] he's here right now to say if he'd done
[1:19:18] it for Jessica
[1:19:19] he can do it for me
[1:19:23] we had a Tent Revival last year but Joe
[1:19:26] some of y'all came to it
[1:19:28] I don't even remember what service it
[1:19:30] was but the Lord began to drop down in
[1:19:32] the that little tent and begin a move in
[1:19:35] a special way and maybe it was brother
[1:19:37] Wayne preaching and he began to invite
[1:19:39] people to you know step out by faith
[1:19:43] step out by faith and there was a sister
[1:19:45] in that in that under that tent that
[1:19:48] goes to church with us
[1:19:50] that's been addicted with prescription
[1:19:52] drugs for many many years
[1:19:57] I believe it was 27 years
[1:20:00] she's been addicted to pain pills
[1:20:03] she stood to her feet and began to lift
[1:20:06] her hands and
[1:20:07] the spirit of the Lord came down and
[1:20:10] in a special way and changed her
[1:20:15] she took those pills and she drugged
[1:20:17] dumped them all out and and since that
[1:20:21] day it's almost gone on a year she
[1:20:23] hadn't took one pill
[1:20:25] and she went back to the doctor or
[1:20:27] whatever that little little pow-wow they
[1:20:29] have with with the addicts
[1:20:32] and began to tell you no you can't just

[1:20:44] she just stepped over on the limb of
[1:20:47] Faith she followed signs for so long
[1:20:50] that she got addicted to it thought she
[1:20:52] couldn't get over it

[1:22:03] that God told him to take a take some
[1:22:05] gopher wood and
[1:22:06] taking every Green Tree and beat their
[1:22:09] eyes and out of it bullet pour it on
[1:22:11] some gopher wood
[1:22:13] brother Brown said when they begin to
[1:22:14] pour it on there and it soaked it inside
[1:22:16] and held him it's settled settled it
[1:22:19] sealed it harder than silk
[1:22:25] I said why didn't they use some oak tree
[1:22:28] Oak so much doubter so much better
[1:22:33] but Brothers it doesn't make any
[1:22:35] difference how styled Oak is God's
[1:22:37] specks was gulper wood and God's going

[1:22:48] and brother man said the word pitch
[1:22:49] means to stand between it was gulper
[1:22:53] wood and the art was to keep out and
[1:22:55] atone The Believer from the Wrath no
[1:22:58] could not get in the Wrath because of
[1:23:00] waters of judgment
[1:23:02] look he cannot come into judgment
[1:23:04] because there was an atonement between
[1:23:05] him and the Judgment get a good
[1:23:08] open-heart person
[1:23:10] and pour in the pitch which was the Holy
[1:23:13] Ghost I say the Lord tonight
[1:23:18] Lord
[1:23:19] what was he doing to know he was
[1:23:21] conditioned Noah to rise
[1:23:24] and as it did it doesn't matter how deep
[1:23:27] the water was this boat was going to
[1:23:30] elevate Noah about the judgments
[1:23:34] it was an atonement between Noah and the
[1:23:38] and judgment
[1:23:40] Hallelujah
[1:23:42] listen what brother Brown says fill me
[1:23:44] into the believer with the Holy Ghost of
[1:23:46] fire until they're so full that they're
[1:23:48] not their self anymore then she can
[1:23:50] blunt the waves
[1:23:53] in other words you're not going to be
[1:23:55] exempt from waves you're going to be
[1:23:57] able to blunt the waves
[1:23:58] you're gonna bump up against some logs
[1:24:01] but you'll knock them out of the way and
[1:24:03] keep on going you can bump him bounce

[1:26:01] good men a lot of good churches a lot of
[1:26:04] priests yeah
[1:26:06] but down there at the well that day was
[1:26:08] a predestinative moment where there was
[1:26:11] some representation down there
[1:26:14] God knew exactly what he could get out
[1:26:16] of that Gulf of wood
[1:26:18] yes sir Hallelujah

[1:26:34] citizenship I mean I'm not of this world
[1:26:37] this world is not my home we sing the
[1:26:39] song
[1:26:41] like Rahab she was in Jericho but she
[1:26:45] wasn't of Jericho
[1:26:47] God's working
[1:26:48] when it doesn't even seem like he's
[1:26:51] working
[1:26:53] sister Carla he could bring by some
[1:26:55] spies
[1:26:57] to a harlot
[1:27:00] think about it
[1:27:01] spies came to a harlot's house
[1:27:06] but God was working it out for our good
[1:27:10] she didn't even know what was going on
[1:27:12] brother David but God was working it out
[1:27:15] for her good
[1:27:17] God was going to make it beautiful in
[1:27:19] his time and then she began the very
[1:27:22] thing that he allowed brother Danny
[1:27:24] those other the spies to escape he said
[1:27:27] you buying this let it become a token to
[1:27:30] you let it become life to you that
[1:27:32] everything that's behind this token is
[1:27:35] going to be saved
[1:27:37] it's good and then when Joshua went out
[1:27:40] trying to find a way to overcome Jericho
[1:27:42] the lord of the hosts came down gives
[1:27:45] Joshua a visitation I say he's still
[1:27:48] watching over Jericho the lady that was
[1:27:50] in Jericho
[1:27:52] God's working it out
[1:27:54] Hallelujah walk around seven times on
[1:27:56] Seventh Day walk around seven times
[1:27:58] listen friends every wall but her house
[1:28:02] fell
[1:28:03] oh you hear me somebody L the one when
[1:28:06] that earthquake began to shake Jericho
[1:28:08] it was strong enough to take down every
[1:28:10] house but the one that had the token
[1:28:13] applied
[1:28:13] [Applause]
[1:28:17] those walls
[1:28:20] she was in captivity Behind the Walls of
[1:28:22] bondage
[1:28:23] there was no Jubilee in sight for her
[1:28:27] behind the walled City
[1:28:30] but God was going to make a way
[1:28:33] the very walls that was supposed to hold
[1:28:35] her in and keep her under captivity
[1:28:38] was destroyed with all of her accusers
[1:28:44] hold a preachers say this one time and
[1:28:46] it just rung a bell in my heart
[1:28:50] that when it when the dust settled
[1:28:54] Rahab escaped that destruction
[1:28:57] fell in love with a general in the army
[1:29:00] of God
[1:29:01] they fell in love and they they they
[1:29:04] were deciding to get married
[1:29:08] and no doubt on that wedding day that
[1:29:10] that priest would stand there and begin
[1:29:12] to do the vows over them
[1:29:15] and would say is there just one
[1:29:20] is there anyone here
[1:29:23] that has anything to say
[1:29:26] that these two shouldn't be joined
[1:29:28] together
[1:29:30] and no doubt they begin to talk back to
[1:29:33] fourth of one another and
[1:29:35] right so I heard so and so
[1:29:37] and the priest would say well the word
[1:29:40] says go down and find two accusers
[1:29:46] but God was by making everything
[1:29:48] beautiful in time we didn't understand
[1:29:52] why the spies came to Rahab we didn't
[1:29:54] understand why not when the lord of the
[1:29:56] hosts showed up we didn't understand why
[1:29:58] we had received the token and nobody
[1:30:00] else did but God was working it out that
[1:30:04] God destroyed all of her accusers and
[1:30:07] when they ran back to find two they
[1:30:09] wasn't none there
[1:30:11] God make everything beautiful in his
[1:30:15] time
[1:30:17] first Peter tells us but the God of all
[1:30:19] Grace who has called us into the eternal
