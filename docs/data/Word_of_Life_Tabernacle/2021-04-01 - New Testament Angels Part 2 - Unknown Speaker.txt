so glad i'm yours lord [Music] heavenly father we thank you that we're yours tonight lord ownership means so much think of the scripture where you said in the day when you set aside your jewels lord and if you're doing that in this day i believe we are your peculiar treasure and we thank you for that it's not because of of anything we've done or any merit that we might have in our own selves but lord it's because you chose us to be that and i'm so grateful for that today lord it gives us such rest and peace to know that we're yours i pray that you would move in this audience tonight and lord i pray that each one that would that come lord to the house of god on a wednesday night would have a special blessing lord that you would just come down and anoint the word lord may you speak directly to those that are hearing or watching listening lord and i pray god that you would meet every need here tonight whatever is represented you know what it is i pray god you would meet it tonight we believe you will thank you for all you do in jesus name amen amen amen do you love the lord this evening turn with me to hebrews chapter 1 and verse 14. hebrews chapter 1 verse 14. read that verse one verse of the text that we read last wednesday night i want to remind you about our meetings coming up on saturday and sunday saturday night at six o'clock and sunday at 10 30. so i'll be ready for that and i'm trust will have some visitors as well but if you've got somebody that you'd like to invite to church this would be a good time to do it this weekend and i'm sure it'll be a blessing to us as well we always need revival you know that we constantly are in need of revival and that's the cry that we have in our hearts lord revive me and set me on fire let me be that one that sparked that sets off a fire a wildfire amen amen so i believe that we've seen god moving lately church i i can't tell you how pleased i am with the way the lord is moving in our midst and i believe there's more for us now's not the time to lay let our foot off the accelerator now is the time to push down harder and press that much harder we believe god is doing what he said he would do and meeting with us and we're grateful for that today hebrews chapter 1 and verse 14 it says are they not all ministering spirits speaking of the angels sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation and that's us amen i pray the lord without his blessing to the word you may be seated i'm going to finish this at some point i may not yet finish it tonight we found out that last wednesday that new testament angels come for the purpose of revealing hidden secrets they come to the disciples and said this same jesus will come again and like manners you've seen him go so they they explained the the the manner of his return they also came to philip to commission him in a ministry uh an angel come to him and told him to go down into uh to meet the uh the man in the desert and so we know that an angel came to him there for that purpose and we showed how that brother branham being commissioned by an angel wouldn't have been a strange thing to the new testament church because they believed in the supernatural and those kind of things and then we found that in cornelius's house that the angel come to cornelius for the purpose of instruction to let him know how to receive the holy ghost and how to receive the word from from the ministry of that day and we found that they're both earthly and heavenly angels that both of them have authority but both are sent as servants and i like the way that uh that in malachi 4 it says behold i send you elijah the prophet he come for us he didn't come for himself he come for us and so there's a reason why god sends an angel there always is a reason whether that's an earthly or a heavenly angel now i want to emphasize tonight that before we get started that angels do not replace the preeminence of the word the word is always preeminent the word is number one and and galatians one and eight says this but though we he said the we now that's the earthly messenger or an angel a heavenly messenger from heaven preach any other gospel unto you then that which you which we have preached unto you let him be accursed so it can't come with something different than what we already have in the scriptures in in 1963 brother branham says this this gives me such confidence in the message that we have he said not one time as that angel of the lord stand there has every one time told me anything but what went right back in the bible and proved it by the bible amen the heavenly angel was never wrong that ought to give us confidence shouldn't it he said but i saw where the earthly messenger was wrong wait a minute the heavenly angel was never wrong right so the message is right in fact you can say the message is perfect but earthly messengers of course are human right and so we make human mistakes but the heavenly angel was never wrong so we can have confidence in the message today like we have confidence in the scriptures now he says he told me he said he never told me anything but what went right back in the bible and proved it by the bible he said if it ever told me anything was contrary to the bible i would not believe it he said this bible is first any kind of an angel or anything else that would testify anything contrary to this word don't you listen to it he says i don't care how real it seems this is right and so i wanted to preface this tonight because we're going to talk about supernatural and i believe that god wants to move in a supernatural way in our midst but it wouldn't matter how supernatural it was if it didn't go back to the word it wouldn't be right so the word always comes first and that's god's primary method of speaking to you is just by his word he wants you just to believe it to take him at his word but brother branham put it in such a great way he said if i was god he said and you refused my word i'd just forget you you know i'm paraphrasing but he said god didn't stop there he sent angels he sent gifts into the into the world so that he might be able to persuade you amen i'm so glad that that god did that for us he didn't just leave us just with the word only but he sent the spirit to teach us the word now also messengers to come now he says don't you listen to it i don't care how real it seems this is right it's always right again in 1964 he said if i tell you anything that's not in the scripture and a promise for the hour your duty bound to see the manager here and come tell me about it he said that's right i teach nothing but what's in the word he said did he really well i'll tell you that's what the ones beyond the curtain of time were resting on hallelujah they said we're resting on the fact that you preach what paul preached and we could go pick apart all day and try to find all the faults and everything else in it but if you preach what paul preached we ought to be able to have confidence in the message you understand that we know brother branham was a man but we have confidence in this message that god sent it to us and we're able a full on air therein even those of us brother danny that aren't very smart not you but me but those of us who are country folk those of us with a limited education those of us who can't hurt we won't err they're in it was simple enough that we could understand it amen so he says he said i teach nothing but what's in the word and if i say right with that word and if i say it's that way and god it's in the bible he said if the angel of the lord told me something that wasn't in the bible it wouldn't be the angel of the lord right he said he has never one time told me anything but what was in that word he said if you bear me record he's never said one thing out of the hundreds of thousands and thousands and the languages of the world has he ever one time said anything wrong or said anything that didn't come to pass you go back and watch the discernment over and over and over again it was accurate and sometimes brother branham would slip up and he would have to spell it because he couldn't pronounce the name or or he would get something wrong because he'd see it he'd interpret it wrong but the angel was always right that's true we're mature we can handle that the angel was always right go look at it and you know if you've got something that's polished you have to wonder what somebody did to polish it but brother madam didn't come to us in a polished way paul said i didn't come to you with the words of men's wisdom he said but i come to you in the power and demonstration of the spirit brother didn't come to us in a polished way and you can sit and pick apart his words and his english and his lack of education but i'll tell you this the angel the lord stood there and vindicated it to be right hallelujah he said he's never one time said anything wrong or said anything that didn't come to pass now let's look at this angel this next time in acts chapter 12 and there are others that i'm going to skip other angelic events or visitations in the book of acts but i wanted to deal with this one in acts chapter 12 and verse 1 and we find that at this time that in the book of acts that they've had a great revival and the gospel has left the jewish church or them alone and went to the gentiles so you'll find in chapter 10 chapter 11 that there's a great revival in the and the gentiles in antioch the message is just booming if you can say it that way everything everybody's believing it it's just a wonderful time a great revival that how that spread like wildfire through that ancient world and here different ones went out and paul went out in different ones and cornelius house how that they received the holy ghost and all these things that happened and it's right about that time that we see herod the king stretching forth his hand to vex certain of the church and it proves to us the biblical principle that evil is always present wherever there's good whenever you have a revival there's going to be evil there whenever you try to do something as a church the satan's going to oppose you you know that because he stands and opposes god the old testament tells us that he when in job when he come before the sons of god he stands and argues with god he's not afraid to argue with you right because he argues with god and so it's always there evil is always present but don't look at the evil recognize that god uses that for the for a purpose of showing his power acts chapter 12 and verse 2 it says herod killed james the brother of john with the sword and i thought it was striking that james and john had asked to sit at the side of jesus you remember the sons of thunder had their mother go and ask and i had mama go and ask for them to see if if they could sit by the by his side one on the right hand and one on the left and jesus said this he said are you able to be baptized with the baptism that i'll be baptized with are you able to drink from the cup that i'm drinking from and what's interesting is that james and john james is the first to die john is the last you talk about the sovereignty of god you would have thought from what jesus said but see that's where he said what's that to you he'll stand and fall before his own master james is the first apostle to die john is the last apostle to die and they had asked you but he said can you be baptized with the baptism i'm baptized with but god in his sovereignty had a different purpose for james than he did for john james had to be the first martyr john had to be the on the isle of patmos see that's the sovereignty of god god knows what your life is supposed to be like and we think we know but we don't know and we get in so much trouble when we when we bull rush it if that makes sense when we go headlong into it and we think well i can make it happen i can do this i can do this no stay with god because god knows what you're he knows what's around the corner you don't know what's around the corner you don't know and i've told you before i had a job one time sitting in a in a uh email attachment that was actually in my spam email at work it was set there for like a month before i actually opened up but it was the will of god but i didn't realize it was around the corner and if i had gotten frustrated and done something different i wouldn't have been in the will of god you understand god had something that he wanted to do and god's got something for you tonight every one of us that's the sovereignty of god acts chapter 12 and verse 3 it says because he saw it please the jews he proceeded further to take peter also then were the days of unleavened bread and so that was about this time of the year actually it would have been pretty much this week all of those years ago and when he had apprehended him he put him in prison and see you know peter's probably thinking well this is it they already killed james if god didn't spare his life he probably won't spare mine you know how people get you see somebody down the road who got cancer and they died and then you get it and well that's probably it for me somebody had a stroke somebody did this and it killed them it took them down to see god god got something different for you god's sovereign will in your life is unique to your life absolutely unique and that's why it's so hard to tell somebody else to say brother ben what should i do well it's hard for me to tell you because god's sovereign will for your life is unique to you he don't always reveal that to me all i know is what the word says there's things that are right to do things that are wrong to do but i can't tell you what the sovereign will of god is for your life that's something you've got to get to down to business with god on so peter didn't know he probably thought that was the end he put him in prison delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers at 16 soldiers working it was four soldiers working six hour shifts for 24 hours so he always had soldiers four soldiers there with him four quaternions to keep him intending after easter to bring him forth to the people verse 5 peter therefore was kept in prison oh i love this but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto god for him they didn't give up amen you come on a wednesday night because you haven't give up it may look bad it may look like there's there's a terrible bondage and may look like that that situation will never change but you didn't give up hallelujah and brother branham tells us when he's talking to the prayer line he says now the power of the church this is that that next quote if i put it on there he said the power of the church is to come together and pray now think about that the power of the church is to come together and pray matthew 18 and 18 is jesus speaking this is where brother branham gets that remember he's a word prophet so the power of the church is to come together and pray matthew 18 18 verily i say unto you who's whatsoever you shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever you shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven amen the church was about to release peter they were about to lose peter that's right the church praying was about to cause an angel to come to peter amen whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven again i say to you that if two of you shall agree on earth two of you you see why it's so important to be together so important and satan has attacked that today but if two of you can get together amen it's important to get together even in your own home you say well i have my prayers and he has his she has her prayers and i have mine but it's important because if two you can come together whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven if two of you agree on earth amen so we don't have to have agreement from everybody but if we can get two people that's a majority amen because god's with us but he wants us to come together that's the way he designed it for us to come together if two of you will agree on earth as touching anything that they shall ask it shall be done for them but my father which is in heaven do we believe that tonight that's what jesus said that's written and read matthew 18 and 24 where two or three are gathered together in my name there am i in the midst of him he promised to be here hallelujah brother branham and the easter seal now watch this because we've got these meetings coming up so i'm kind of i'm going to kind of dwell on this for a moment because i believe it's important it's important what atmosphere that we create if we're going to sing if we're going to come if we're going to be in the house of god if we could just take a few minutes before we come and kind of clear everything out or come a little early where we can sit down and sit in the presence of god because it takes a few minutes sometimes to get everything out of the way and so we're not lagging behind the atmosphere so when you come you're still you're in that same atmosphere because atmosphere does something and brother madam says the presbyterian church the methodist church the baptist church any of them can bring forth these eagles we'll say brother branham why can't we be a denomination then but now listen listen there's a reason why they don't but any of them could right he said sure it's the atmosphere that does it as dr bosworth used to say you could take a hen egg and put it under a pup and tie him down a pup would hatch out a chicken why it's the atmosphere and when any church you reckon word of life tabernacle is included in that now we've already seen the scripture he said well i don't i won't take that quote well look at the scripture if any two of you any two amen when any church or any group hallelujah that will assemble themselves together now that's something they've got to do any church or any group that will ascend themselves together and pray until now watch he said pray until they throw away their creeds and things that's why it don't happen in the baptist church the methodist church the presbyterian church because they can't come together and pray and throw away their cretes right that's why it don't happen it could if they would come together god don't care what name's outside there it don't help us any to have word of life tabernacle we could put message church we could put brother branham's name on the side we could do all that it wouldn't do us any good be nothing wrong with it but it wouldn't do us any good wouldn't mean anything more than baptist or methodist unless we come together lest we assemble together and pray and throw away our creeds and things and look straight in the face of god he said it'll bring forth eagles just as certain as i'm standing there hey man he said that's what i think this businessman's group has done he's speaking the full gospel businessmen he said trying to break up the atmosphere we're getting too clannish one belongs to this and that well i wonder what he'd say today about us message people but if you why you say brother ben why do you want fellowship it's because you want that atmosphere and when you know when you can get those licks of fire together you get people together it's not because i want sure i want this place to be full but that's not why i want fellowship i want fellowship because i know when people come together with needs god you know sometimes there has to be a need see for god to meet it there had to be a blind man there and the disciples said who sinned him or his parents he said neither he said that the glory of god might be known i might be shown in his life and and so sometimes somebody has to come just so they can be delivered amen so the church can see it so that they can get on fire for god so we come together he said let's break up the atmosphere and get the atmosphere in a heavenly worship don't you like an atmosphere like that don't you feel good when you get an atmosphere like that i'll tell you what i've told you lately i believe god's doing something i'm not just saying that lightly i've had more freedom to preach over the last few weeks than i've had in years and i have to say god's doing something so let's break up the atmosphere and get the atmosphere in a heavenly worship get the atmosphere right eagles will be born hallelujah listen out of any church anywhere hallelujah even in hardy arkansas yes in hardy arkansas any church anywhere brother branham talks about how a soldier will be so disciplined for his country he'll expose himself to enemy fire and give his life stick his head up out of the trench because his sergeant says go and he goes because of his training and love for his country and brother branham follows that up he said but a man seldom will you ever find one that will lay down his life for the cause of christ listen to this he said he won't even crawl out of his shade tree and go to church won't even get out from behind the television long enough to attend a wednesday night prayer meeting he said that's right amen it's a shame disgrace he said that's the reason the angels don't visit the churches that's the reason the angels don't visit homes we've got to get down to deep sincerity of this thing the angels of god are here listen on earth tonight just the same as they always been it's not an accident that they were praying when the angel came let's look at daniel chapter 9 and verse 20. it says in wiles i was speaking and praying and you can go read the prayer later but daniel makes a prayer before god we know daniel was a praying man but he's troubled because he doesn't understand he said while i was speaking and praying and confessing my sin and the sin of my people israel and presenting my supplication before the lord my god for the holy mountain of my god yay while i was speaking in prayer even the man gabriel whom i had seen in the vision at the beginning being caused to fly swiftly touch me about the time of the evening oblation watch we're going to get to a moment when an angel was delayed but in this instance the angel come quickly he was caused to fly swiftly why the son of god was on his knees in prayer you believe god could still do that today you believe god still wants to do that today when a son or daughter of god gets on their knees in prayer an angel come and flew swiftly and touched him informed me and talked with me and said oh daniel i've now come forth to give this skill and understanding at the beginning of thy supplications the commandment came forth and i am come to show thee for thou art greatly beloved therefore understand the matter and consider the vision now sometimes the angel is delayed and it's not because god is not powerful enough to send you send it right away but there's a purpose in the delay there's a time that's meant for it to be known and so sometimes you pray and you don't get an answer right away but you keep praying anyway daniel 10 10 and behold the hand touched me which set me upon my knees and upon the palms of my hands and he said unto me oh daniel man greatly beloved understand the words that i speak unto thee and stand upright unto them i now sent when he had spoken this word unto me i stood trembling and then said he unto me fear not daniel for from the first day the doubt thou had set thine heart to understand and to chasten thyself before thy god thy words were heard and i am come for thy words i am come for thy words realize an angel could come because you prayed because you pray not because the preacher prayed or the preacher preached but because you prayed because a child prayed an angel might come you realize when we come to church what a powerful thing it is when we come together brother said that's the power of the church is to come together and pray not just that we would be here for hours and hours praying that's not what he's saying when we come together and we we ask we give our petitions to god there's a power in that of agreement and even as we're hearing the word angels could be coming why they're come for our words because we ask them to come sometimes you need to hear yourself ask you need to hear yourself ask you need to hear yourself pray you need to hear yourself there's something about speaking the word you know there's people they've proven this in psychology that if you'll speak something you're more likely to do it as long as it remains a thought you're not as likely to do it but if you'll speak it you're more likely to see it fulfilled how many times have you done that where you speak something and it comes to pass that's just the truth church you've seen it you'll speak something as long as it remains just a thought then it just don't nothing happens but when you speak it something happens if you could speak to god say god i believe we're going to have revival i believe you're coming i believe i repent of my sins i ask you to come and when we ask god to come he comes brother brandon preached the sermon go jesus keeps all his appointments very bad aren't you glad he does amen he said thy words were heard i've come for thy words but the prince of the kingdom of persia which stood me one in 20 days but don't mean there won't be a battle but he's coming oh michael one of the chief princes came to help me and i remain there with the kings of persia and now i am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy people in the latter days for yet the vision is for many days now this this vision it he had a certain time for it to be revealed and he even said about this part seal it up until the end right when it'll be made known seal it up into the end because and so there's no if god needed daniel to hear that the day he prayed he would have done it right but he allowed that he allowed the battle to take place because the time wasn't right yet now look brother branham tells the story you know the story there's two women from the same neighborhood that got prayed for both received their healing both went on testifying of their healing both still had symptoms and quite a while after that the meetings already moved on but the rhythms left the city this woman is standing at her sink thinking about these things and saying well the prophet of god told me that if i would if i would believe if i'd hold on to my testimony if i'd let that go then a worse thing would come on me so i have to hold on and she's thinking about these things i believe i'm healed and she was thinking about these things she decided to try a piece of toast and it it stayed down remember she had the stomach trouble it stayed down so she tried some oatmeal it stayed down she tried some coffee it stayed down at this point she was so excited she ran down to her neighbor's house who went to the meeting and she said when i got there she was screaming at the top of her voice and said the growth had just left her throat what was it it was the angel of god passing through the neighborhood he said god don't work like that i believe he does i believe he could do that tonight i believe he could do that this weekend but we've got to be under expectation lord if nobody else is there i'm going to gather myself together with the people of god and be expecting an angel to pass through god still does those things he said that blessings has been pronounced amen he said sometimes they can't get to you just as they wish he said how many times remember when daniel the angel come to him and said 21 days he'd withstood you remember that he said daniel prayed but the angel said that he had trouble there and couldn't get to him for 21 days after he made the prayer so don't be in a hurry just believe have faith he said if you accept jesus tonight as your healer have faith it's got to come to pass habakkuk 2 3 said for the vision is yet for an appointed time but at the end it shall speak and not lie though it tarry wait for it because it will surely come it will not tarry in other words when the time is right the vision will be fulfilled an angel come to bring deliverance acts 12 and 6 and when herod would have brought him forth the same night peter was sleeping between two soldiers bound with two chains and the keepers before the door kept the prison and behold the angel of the lord came upon him noticed the level of bondage he was in he was bound with two chains one on one soldier one attached to the other soldier there was no way humanly speaking that he could possibly get out the keepers before the door kept the prison not only were there walls not only were there gates but there were soldiers there just to keep peter in prison and behold the angel of the lord came upon him now look i i wonder what the devil's using to guard your your jail cell what if he's scared enough that you might get out do you ever think about that you say well this got me bound awful tight i wonder if the devil is just scared that you might get out that's why every time you come to church something goes wrong that's why every time you get a little bit up he beats you back down why because he knows that if he could ever get free amen what havoc that would cost and he knows he's lost a lot of people out of prison the devil doesn't have a good record of keeping people in tombs or keeping people in jail hallelujah he doesn't have a good record at all everybody puts in prison gets out everybody puts in in a tomb raises up hallelujah he does everything he can imagine how much it must have frustrated the prince of darkness to know that these men he just couldn't seem to kill him and here he was rejoicing over james and he still said let's make sure let's inspire the romans to make sure that these these romans are these soldiers are all around them make sure they don't get out because they have a habit of getting out amen i wonder if he could say that about us that when we get we may get sick we may get down we may get depressed at times sure you live in the flesh you may get down but i'm telling you that there's a god that is so powerful in your life that the devil has to guard you extra close and behold the angel of the lord came upon him and a light shined in the prison and he smoked peter on the side i have kind of a funny picture of that because that's how i wake up peter every morning wake up i don't hit him but grab a blanket off of him my son doesn't take after his dad he takes after his mom he likes his sleep and he's a teenager so he wants to sleep in he wants to stay up all night and sleep in and i get ready to get up i want everybody in the house up you know and you know you're fighting a war of attrition when it comes to when you're homeschooled we're homeschooling the kids right now and trying to keep them trying to get them up in the morning and keep a schedule going it's hard it's really hard to do and so i'm going in there and sometimes you have to you have to peter get up because he's so so asleep that's what the angel of the lord did that's right he come in and he smote him on the side and raised him up saying rise up quickly and his chains fell off from his hands hallelujah his chains fell off of his hands and the angel said unto him gird thyself and bind all thy sandals and so he did and he saith unto him cast thy garment about thee and follow me imagine how peter felt somebody come hit him in the side his chains fall off they're sleeping soldiers on either side of him he said man i wish that angel wouldn't make so much noise the chain's rattling on the floor peter waking up in a start and the angel comes to him and says follow me he probably didn't realize where he was for 20 minutes in fact the bible kind of talks like that he didn't even know he's kind of in a daze see sometimes the message of deliverance catches us off guard it was an angel of deliverance with a message of deliverance the angel of god brother brother said these pictures back there if it doesn't bear record of christ then it's the wrong angel he said that about joseph smith seeing an angel who didn't bear the record of christ but a true angel of god will bear the record of christ the true grapevine will bear grace and a true spirit of god will manifest jesus christ if it doesn't then don't answer the european author but notice what he says this is so powerful church when i saw it it's like he's speaking directly to me speaking directly to you he said i defy the devil in all of his words it's the hour of the church's deliverance it's as if an angel come in and smote us on the side making some noise it's the hour of the church's deliverance and they're sitting under creeds and denominations and fussing and going on till they don't know their day amen fussing and fighting with one another will make you not recognize your day and hour but the hour of deliverance has come he said rise you to sleep and shake yourself call on god amen amen now is not the time to keep sleeping in the prison keep being bound to the chains now's the time to get up wake up the angel said get up follow me that's what a word come in our hour to say get up and follow the message of the hour all the way to the rapture rise you to sleep and shake yourself and call on god hallelujah he went out and followed him and wished not that it was true which was done by the angel but thought he saw a vision didn't even know that it was real what is strange is that the apostles had been delivered from prison by an angel already in the book of acts we didn't go go there but if you go back to chapter 5 you find that the angels had already delivered the apostles out of the prison like i said there's a reason why they had so many because that time they put them in the common prison and they just got out and said the angel lord delivered them but it don't say how so they just disappeared and then the pharisees were looking for them so now herod must have heard about that and said well i'm going to make sure i keep him in prison because he's got a habit of escaping hallelujah and so pete but peter you know it's like it's as if human beings are hardwired to doubt the supernatural we just are now you know that it's true you see something you think well it may not be god what if it is god you begin to feel a little freedom you say well i don't want to get in the flesh i don't want to get i don't want to become a radical but what if it is god what if he wants to you know wake up amen what if he wants you to shake yourself now see if it's not of god it'll go against the word every time you watch it you watch it for a while don't that's why you don't lay hands on no man suddenly the bible says that don't mean don't don't lose your temper and grab somebody it means don't endorse someone suddenly because things you know flashes in the pan campground revivals can come and go [Applause] right but but something that's of god will have some results to it amen amen but yet you better not if you if you're a person of a cynical nature and you begin to doubt the supernatural you won't recognize when it when the angel comes jesus constantly had to rebuke his disciples for their lack of faith even after they saw him raise the dead they they still couldn't believe that he'd actually raised himself after they saw him raise lazarus do you ever think about that it was still hard for them to believe and thomas said i won't even believe it unless i stick my hand in that hole in his side and jesus being so gracious because thomas was a doubter but he was a real christian and jesus comes and said here's the nail prince he said i don't have to see him but they it was their nature it's our nature today to doubt but if we could just begin to expect god to be god what a difference it would make verse 10 says when they were past the first and second ward they come into the iron gate that leadeth into the city which opened to them of his own accord and they went out and passed on through one street and fourth with the angel departed from him and when peter was come to himself amen he woke up he finally got fully woke up he'd been stumbling along through the city the prisons open the guards are still sleeping the chains are rattling he finally gets outside the city the gates open up by themselves thinking boy that's strange walks through and kind of wakes up and says wait a minute i'm free i didn't do anything to set myself free but i'm free now i know for sure that the lord has sent his angel don't you realize every one of us have to come to that place you say well i've been in the message for all this time i believe the word of god for this time but you need to find that supernatural place where you know you're outside of the wall something brought me from there to here some power had to bring me out from the prison into the place where i am today amen listen brother baron talked about the token he said how do you know you have it what where are you and what are you now amen where were you you were in bondage now you're free what happened to you it was a supernatural intervention of god now i'm sure that the lord has sent his angel that delivered me out of the hand of herod and from all the expectation of the people of the jews i know something supernatural took place because i'm not in the prison anymore you see evidence of the supernatural is not what you feel when it takes place but it's what happens afterwards may not even recognize it while god's doing it but later you're going to see some fruit from him verse 12 and when he had considered the thing he come to the house of mary the mother of john whose surname was mark i love the fact that the first thing he does is go to church he knew they'd be meeting knew where the secret meeting place was during that persecution and the first thing he does is go to church where many were gathered together praying that's what free people do by the way he starts seeing them at church hallelujah and as peter knocked at the door of the gate well i could just stay on that for a while but i'm not going to god bless you if i preach that on wednesday night i'll be preaching to the choir and as peter knocked at the door of the gate a damn shall come to hark and name rhoda i love this when she knew peter's voice she opened not the gate for gladness but ran in and peter's out there kind of trying to be quiet to him soldiers right there looking for him somewhere because he's missing from prison he's an escapee so he's trying to be quiet knock on the door hey it's me i heard peter she runs back in the house i wish she'd opened the door says she opened not the gate for gladness you know sometimes people that recognize god's doing something supernatural act in ways that people think are inappropriate but it's just because of gladness but ran in and told how peter stood before the gate and they said unto her you're crazy but she constantly affirmed that it was even so and then said they it's his angel or in other words in our modern terms that's a ghost they must already killed him they already had him dead oh church but they kept praying anyway oh church if we can only understand the power of prayer of people gathering together and praying because and putting their licks of fire together just coming to the house of god and praying and they already they had already supposed that he was dead they said it's his ghost but peter continued knocking and when they had opened the door and saw him they were astonished hey you might be astonished to see somebody come that had the hardest heart in the world and all of a sudden they show up at the house of god why they've been delivered from bondage you've been praying but there's nothing else you could do but that's the time that god likes to work you see for deliverance to take place an angel must be recognized and his message must be obeyed watch what peter had to do he had to recognize he was an angel even though he was kind of in his stupor he followed him he wasn't fully awake but he followed him had to recognize what it was we find the children of israel in the wilderness if you'll give me just a few more minutes we'll finish this up the children of israel in the wilderness did not recognize their deliverance brother branham says it this way he said just as their time was for deliverance and they failed to see it so it's the time for the deliverance the marching orders for the church it's at hand he said look my friend they had what first the word second a prophet third an angel to lead them he said to guide them everyone agreed with the other the three of them watch the agreement the angel agreed with the prophet agree with the word the prophet agreed with the word agreed with the angel right there's no cow picking grass in the top of the tree it's the right time it's the right season they had all of that it was the hour of their deliverance but they failed to see it that's right remember that's why they so many of them died in the wilderness because they failed to see that the word agreed with the prophet he said and the prophet agreed with the word the angel agreed with all of them he said the word the prophet and angel they were ready for the march hope that should be the name of the lord god he said we're at the end time the word the prophet and the angel all three of them together one great testimony why would god do that why would god send a prophet in this age why would he send an angel the lord in this hour to commission a prophet to come and preach to us why would he do that why the supernatural at brother branham's ministry because he was sending the angel and the prophet in the word to come in agreement for the hour of deliverance amen and make us ready for the march into heaven now he says all three of them together one great testament god always said in the mouth of two or three witnesses let every word be established and a true prophet will always agree with the word and any angel will testify truth he said amen we're ready for marching orders sure he said he brought the people out on the road up they started rebelling against the prophet notice what happens when they rebel against the prophet they rebel against the angel and they rebel against god against the word now that's a sober thing to think about it always happens in that order they rebel against the prophet he must not know what he's talking about when they do they're really rebelling against the angel and then when they do they rebel against the word and you'll find out that it is biblical but they won't acknowledge that it is sobering thought church you want to be released from prison like peter was you want to have angelic visitation you've got to come in agreement with the angel and the prophet and the word that's right you say well that that part of it you know that's hard on me that's hard on me but that he sent an angel to tell us that it must have been important you understand it wasn't me it wasn't your pastor because all your pastor can do is point you to the prophet the angel in the word right and all of them lined up and he said well i don't think they line up well you need to go look again right and and maybe you haven't let brother branham be a man and it's made your focus off maybe you've ma maybe you've made him just a man and not a prophet that'll take your focus off too right because he was a prophet of god he was the prophet for this age you you've made your own word as important as a mess prophet messenger that's happened in a lot of churches now we want the supernatural don't we but when you don't stay with the angel in the word see as much as i want something supernatural to happen i've got to stay in those boundaries you understand if i don't but harvey i'm in trouble as a pastor i've got to as much as i would like to get excited and go outside of it but i got to stay with the angel and the prophet and the word we're going home the bible said there was a mixed multitude that went with them and that's the ones that generally rebel against the prophet and the angel in the word is the mixed multitude those who were not called they just came now look acts 12 and 17 but he beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace imagine what a tumult it was when they recognized it was him he'd been freed he says wait a minute he declared unto them how the lord had brought him out of the prison and said go show these things unto james and to the brethren that would be the james brother of jesus and he departed and went into another place now as soon as it was day there was no small stir among the soldiers hallelujah we're closing in just a minute but watch this there was no small stir i like the understated way that the writer puts it there no small stir among the soldiers what was become of peter remember there was a soldier on one side a soldier on the other side they're both chained to him huh their whole purpose in life was keeping peter in prison and there's there sleeping one on one side and one on the other and somehow during the night they missed the awakening of the bride think about it they missed the awakening of the bride they thought to keep him bound to keep a man of god that the people of god bound in within their denominational realms and somehow in the middle of the night they missed the awakening of the bride that's exactly what's happened in our time and so they started looking for him said we need a prophet to return and the prophet said they've already had it and they've missed the awakening of the bride they failed to see a supernatural angel bringing a message of deliverance amen when herod had sought him and found him not he examined the keepers and commanded that they should be put to death ichabod be written across the doors why because they let him out amen but you can't keep jesus in a tomb you can't keep the bride in a prison amen and he went down from judea to caesarea in their abode listen after this message of deliverance peter is missing from prison amen amen brother branham and i read this to you not long ago but i'll just read part of it now and works his faith expressed he said i've seen some lights flickering around in there i looked up and there stood the lord jesus with lights of rainbow around him he was looking right straight to me he said deliver those people and he went away and i thought well how could i deliver them i haven't got strength enough in my arms to break those bars so i said house of hell give way to the name of jesus christ pretty bad oh and the prisoners started to wake up all the creaking and popping and rocks rolling and bars falling and people running and screaming delivered and screaming at the top of their voice and was all delivered you see satan doesn't understand your deliverance he don't get it why you could be free but they lost a loved one but they've had trouble in the home but their bank account is minus 499. they got problems at home they got problems at school they got problems and here they are in the house of god saying amen to the word with a smile on their face excited to about to have a revival meeting the devil don't understand see he's looking for you he's wondering how did they escape denominationalism how did they escape laodicea how are they not bound how are they not in the same state everybody else is in amen how are what are these people doing running around screaming at bars falling everywhere screaming delivered what are they doing you don't understand it why because you're hid under the mystery listen to me church you know as i'm closing your head under the mystery of the seventh seal amen the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me hallelujah amen you're hid under the mystery of the seventh seal and the devil don't know why you can keep your joy he don't know why you can keep your salvation he don't know how you can make it through the hard times you've already been delivered hallelujah during the night an angel a message of deliverance came and the devil don't didn't even know when you were released musicians come and brother brano said this and just kind of get us primed up for the weekend now brother branham said this here he's being asked a question i feel really bad for the person that asked this question he was in a bad place he said i lived many years in sin until i found the lord please brother branham i have sinned again and i'm not worthy to come before you in this holy place please tell me if i can be restored holy again i think that would fit with a lot of people's lives please tell me if i can be fully restored please tell me if i can be restored holy again please help me brother brandon i have a devil in me help me will you lay your hands upon me and restore me again brother branham gives him a long answer and in the middle of that he begins to talk about johnny crow you remember the story johnny crow is flying around a man's got him tied up with a string around his foot just two days ago i was at my house and there's a robin in a tree and he's got a string somebody's flown a kite or something and got it in one of the trees and he's got that kite string wrapped around his foot and he can't get loose he can't get loose and so he's just he's flying we could see him fluttering up there we thought something was wrong with him we got closer he got that kite string on him so i we pulled up the truck and i got up there with a with a pair of scissors and i well as soon as i clipped that string he was gone i mean he was in the next yard in two seconds he was free she hadn't been there very long so he knew what freedom was like amen it's important not to stay in bondage because you don't have to because the more you say in bodies the more the habit of bondage gets on you you get stockholm syndrome you begin sympathizing with the devil he said i'd lay hands on you but that wouldn't free you what did freed johnny crow a good man come by one day and clip the string but johnny crow had flown for so many years in that same circuit that monday morning he woke up he said well here i go again got a monday morning flew in that same circuit not realizing he'd been freed he'd heard a message of deliverance and the message come by and said you're free a good man set him free and johnny crow just kept flying that same circle over and over again why he never recognized his deliverance because he'd gotten into the habit of bondage and so brother branham tells this person he says he relates that story to him he said i'd lay hands on you but that wouldn't free you what would for you is to understand that you're already free amen amen no graves going to hold your body down there's already a promise of resurrection i don't have to come and summon so much power that these ministers don't have to come and preach with such authority that would raise you out of the grace the words already spoken and the anointing is already here we just have to believe it he said you're already untied you don't have to worry about being free you're already free jesus made you free do we believe that tonight hey man let's stand together amen hallelujah give the lord a hand of praise you're already untied amen you don't have to be bound you can be free [Applause] amen hallelujah would you bow your heads with me for just a moment heavenly father lord jesus there's nothing i could do i could lay hands on the people as your prophet went on to explain to fulfill the word but it wouldn't set the people free they're already free lord may we recognize a message of deliverance that's come i pray you would help us to recognize it i pray you would move in the lord in our church as we come to this weekend lord we expect you to move not because we we want to be freed from bondage but because we know we're already free the message of deliverance has come so we can rejoice and we can we whatever holds us down lord if there's anything tonight help us to walk away from those chains because the message has already come god already sent a prophet we're not waiting on another one to come we're not waiting on a preacher to preach us into happiness but lord we believe that we're already free we're trusting you tonight we love you we thank you for our freedom in jesus name amen do you love him amen amen go ahead bird in prison i will thank you lord no freedom from my sorrow i felt then jesus came and listened to me oh in glory to god he set me set me free why don't you worship him a minute while we're in this atmosphere before we leave [Music] glory to god he set me free [Music] hallelujah oh glory [Music] [Music] this world shall turn [Music] hallelujah glory bound by jesus to see glory to god he set me free he set me free he set me free yes he set me free he broke the bonds of prison for me i'm glory bound by jesus glory to god he set me free amen give the lord a hand clapping praise and uh i believe it's the same key greater is he that is in me amen greater is he those than me brother robert amen satan greater is he that is is he that is in me the greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world and satan's like a roaring lion roaming to and fro seeking whom he may devour the bible tells us so many souls have been his pray to fall in some weak hour but god has promised us today his overcoming power greater is he that is in me greater is he that is in me greater is he that isn't me than he that is in the world and on the day of pentecost rushing mighty wind it blew into the upper room and baptized all of them with the power greater than any earthly foe i'm so glad i've got it too i'm gonna let the oh greater is he that is in me greater is he that is in me greater is he that [Applause] he that is in the world amen give the lord one more hand clapping praise [Music] amen you love the lord this evening and we're just looking forward to our services coming up this weekend appreciate
