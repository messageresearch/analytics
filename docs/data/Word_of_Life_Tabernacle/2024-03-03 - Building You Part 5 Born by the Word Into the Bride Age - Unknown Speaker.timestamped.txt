[29:06] maybe 6 months now started going back to

[29:10] really been on fire for the Lord so the
[29:13] Lord sometimes get a hold of one in a
[29:14] family and just go right through the
[29:15] whole family and so we we believe he can
[29:18] uh sister Loretta Savage brother

[48:54] Peter 1:22
[48:59] 1 Peter
[49:01] 1:22 and
[49:04] 23 he says seeing you have purified your
[49:07] souls in obeying the truth through the
[49:09] spirit unto unfeigned love of the
[49:12] Brethren see that you love one another
[49:15] with a pure heart fervently yes being
[49:19] born again not of corruptible seed but
[49:24] of incorrupt
[49:26] corruptible oh I love that by the word
[49:29] of God which liveth and abideth forever
[49:34] pray the Lord would add his Blessing to
[49:36] the word you may be
[49:41] seated the prescription for the disease
[49:44] of sin is the same as it has always
[49:48] been the prescription has always been
[49:51] acts 238 right Peter said repent and be
[49:55] baptized every one of you in the name of
[49:57] Jesus Christ for the remission of sins
[50:01] and ye shall receive the gift of the
[50:04] Holy Ghost that is the prescription that
[50:07] was given as an antidote for sin and it
[50:11] works today you might find a a quack
[50:15] doctor if we could say it that way you
[50:17] might find a a preacher you might find a
[50:19] priest or or a rabbi that would tell you
[50:22] something different but I'm here to tell
[50:24] you that I know that this is the right
[50:26] prescription because I've taken it and
[50:29] it works brother bom said it this way he
[50:31] said Peter said I'll give you an
[50:33] everlasting prescription for you and to
[50:36] your children and them that's far off
[50:39] even as many as the Lord Our God shall
[50:42] call he said not come and join but
[50:45] repent every one of you and be baptized
[50:48] in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[50:50] remission of sins and you shall receive
[50:54] the results yeah you shall receive the
[50:57] results the Holy Ghost for the promise
[51:00] this prescription is for you and to your
[51:03] children amen aren't you glad it's still
[51:05] effective today I wonder if there's
[51:07] anybody in the building this morning
[51:09] that could testify that this
[51:11] prescription still works I know it works
[51:14] because I've taken it and I know what it
[51:15] can do to a person who's lost in sin I
[51:18] wonder if you can testify to it today I
[51:21] know what it does I know he still Chang
[51:23] his life I know he still heals the sick
[51:26] I know he still does things for people I
[51:28] know he can change your life if you're
[51:30] struggling and wondering what to believe
[51:32] and what to do won't you take the
[51:34] prescription today and recognize it
[51:36] still works it works every bit as good
[51:39] as it did in brother bram's time it
[51:41] works every bit as good as it did in
[51:43] Peter's time it still works this morning
[51:47] and I want us to understand that with
[51:48] all Clarity today the word still
[51:51] works it's always worked it's it's
[51:54] repentance
[51:56] and Faith repentance and Faith which
[51:59] baptism is simply the action of faith
[52:02] that says Lord I'm G to I'm going to
[52:04] walk what what I'm G to I'm going to do
[52:06] what I say I believe I'm going to
[52:09] identify myself with Christians I'm
[52:11] going to be buried in a watery grave I'm
[52:13] going to go through as I believe that
[52:15] you rose from the dead I'm going to
[52:17] raise from dead trespasses and
[52:19] sins and so baptism is an act of faith
[52:22] that follows repentance and you shall
[52:25] receive the gift of the Holy
[52:28] Ghost amen I'm so glad it works where
[52:32] would we be without the prescription sir
[52:36] but I want us to understand this morning
[52:39] that we we must have faith now uh Jesus
[52:42] said this he said verily verily I say
[52:44] unto you he that heareth my words
[52:47] believeth on him that sent me half
[52:50] everlasting life that's past tense the
[52:53] BR said you always had it amen yeah
[52:55] right but you didn't know it when you
[52:58] believe he said hath everlasting life
[52:59] and shall not come into condemnation but
[53:02] is passed from Death unto life pass
[53:07] can't go back right can't be
[53:10] lost oh my what a blessing that is to
[53:14] know this morning that you've passed
[53:16] from Death un life now we know that to
[53:19] hear as I want to speak to you this
[53:21] morning on uh on how that we are born by
[53:25] the word into the bright age or into the
[53:28] age that we're living in now we know
[53:30] that to hear uh is to understand that's
[53:33] what that word actually means he that
[53:35] heareth my word not just makes out or or
[53:38] hear it with his ears but but understand
[53:41] it so on the day of Pentecost they had
[53:43] to understand it well enough to to go
[53:46] and be baptized right they they had to
[53:49] understand it wasn't some big mystical
[53:50] something it wasn't that you have to
[53:52] know exactly how the Millennium is going
[53:54] to work and exactly what the new city is
[53:56] going to look like that's not what you
[53:57] have to understand but there's got to be
[53:59] something inside of you that has the
[54:01] capacity to understand and then to make
[54:04] you believe and obey the word of God and
[54:07] so what happens is then he said it not
[54:09] just makes out of hears with its ears
[54:11] but understand it anybody can hear it a
[54:13] prostitute can hear it and remain a
[54:15] prostitute a drunker can hear it a liar
[54:17] can hear it still remain a liar but he
[54:19] that understandeth my word and believeth
[54:21] on him that sent me has everlasting life
[54:25] now John 6:44 Jesus said no man can come
[54:29] to me except the Father which has sent
[54:31] me draw him and I love this because I
[54:35] use this against the devil brother Kevin
[54:37] when the devil tries to tell you well
[54:38] you're not a child of God you don't
[54:40] belong in church you tell him I couldn't
[54:42] have come unless he drew me I couldn't
[54:45] have ever believed in the first place
[54:47] unless he called
[54:50] me no man can come to me except the
[54:52] Father which has sent me draw him and I
[54:55] will raise him up at the last day what a
[54:58] promise that
[54:59] is now these folks on the day of
[55:01] Pentecost they proved that they
[55:03] understood what Peter preached because
[55:06] when they took the medicine it had the
[55:09] intended
[55:11] effect now the intended effect was not
[55:14] staggering like drunk men you understand
[55:16] that was the side
[55:18] effect right the intended effect was not
[55:21] even speaking with tongues that was the
[55:23] side effect but the effect was freedom
[55:26] from sin the effect was the antidote
[55:29] from sin right so the effect of the drug
[55:32] if we can say it that way of the
[55:34] prescription is that is that we would be
[55:37] free from the sickness of Sin from the
[55:40] disease of sin that we would be
[55:41] inoculated from it that we would be
[55:43] actually not just freed for a moment but
[55:46] freed
[55:47] forever that once amen what when Jesus
[55:50] died for your sins on the cross what did
[55:53] he do he took your penalty and that
[55:55] penalty it became an inoculation his
[55:58] blood becomes an inoculation for sin all
[56:01] right right so so they actually he
[56:04] became sin for us which is why how they
[56:07] make an inoculation or vaccine or at
[56:10] least he used to in the old days they'd
[56:11] take a a part of the of the actual virus
[56:15] and they would make an antivirus or
[56:16] antidote oh I love that this morning I
[56:19] believe that he is the antidote to
[56:22] sin yes so they but they had the
[56:25] intended effect and it showed that they
[56:28] understood and you being here this
[56:30] morning and believing the word and and
[56:33] following the word of the hour that's
[56:35] the uh the effect of the word in your
[56:37] life the Holy Ghost being in your life
[56:39] it shows you understood what what the
[56:42] gospel said now and we know that because
[56:45] in Acts 2:41 it says then they that
[56:47] gladly how many want to gladly receive
[56:50] the word I love the fact they didn't
[56:52] receive it as some kind of a oh no now
[56:55] we're going to have to believe the
[56:55] message now we're going to have to quit
[56:57] cutting our hair now we're no they
[56:59] gladly receive the word and when you
[57:01] hear it right when you understand it
[57:03] it's not a drudgery it's not a set of
[57:05] dos and don'ts it's not a no it's a
[57:07] freedom they gladly received the word
[57:11] and so they were baptized and the same
[57:13] day there were added unto them about
[57:15] 3,000 souls and they continued
[57:18] steadfastly in the apostles Doctrine and
[57:21] fellowship and in Breaking of bread and
[57:24] in prayer
[57:25] and they continued proving that they
[57:28] were inoculated it wasn't a temporary
[57:30] cure it wasn't some aspirin that they
[57:32] were given it wasn't going to shaking a
[57:34] preacher's hand it wasn't joining a
[57:36] church it wasn't saying I believe the
[57:38] message whatever they got kept them in
[57:41] the apostles Doctrine whatever they got
[57:43] on the day of Pentecost kept them in
[57:46] church whatever oh God you say well I
[57:48] don't know I have a hard time coming to
[57:50] the house of God maybe you need to get
[57:52] the inoculation and it'll keep you in
[57:54] the house of God yes
[57:56] [Applause]
[57:58] sir they proved that they were born of
[58:01] the word because their lives manifested
[58:04] the word John 8:31 then said Jesus to
[58:06] those Jews which believed on him how
[58:08] many believe him today you believe him
[58:11] he said if you believe me if you
[58:12] continue in my word then you are my
[58:15] disciples indeed and you shall know the
[58:18] truth and the truth shall set you free
[58:21] shall make you free oh I love that this
[58:24] morning
[58:26] now the reason they could be born on
[58:30] acts two is because the word was
[58:34] preached in its fullness yeah we know
[58:36] that Christ was the fullness of the word
[58:39] manifested he was all of the Old
[58:42] Testament wrapped up in a body yeah all
[58:45] of the prophecies wrapped up in a body
[58:48] that was what Christ was he was
[58:50] everything that David said and
[58:52] everything that that Isaiah said and
[58:54] everything that all the prophets said
[58:56] about him he was all of it he fulfilled
[58:58] all of it he said in the volume of the
[59:00] book it's written of me yeah right this
[59:03] day this scripture is fulfilled what was
[59:05] it he was the fullness of the word
[59:07] manifested the Bible says John bear
[59:09] witness of him and cried saying this was
[59:12] he of whom I spake he that cometh after
[59:14] me is preferred before me for he was
[59:17] before me and of his fullness have all
[59:20] we received and Grace for Grace we
[59:25] received his fullness Christ is not a
[59:27] type he is not a portion he is the
[59:31] fullness right he is the fullness
[59:33] Colossians 1:19 it pleased the father
[59:36] that in him should all fullness dwell
[59:40] someone Say fullness this morning all
[59:42] the fullness dwell in Christ Colossians
[59:45] 2:9 for in him dwelleth how much all the
[59:49] fullness of the godhead bodily in him he
[59:54] is the fullness he was manifested in his
[59:57] fullness on the earth he was manifested
[1:00:00] in his fullness again remember the corn
[1:00:02] of wheat had to fall into the ground and
[1:00:03] die and we'll talk some more about that
[1:00:05] later but he was manifested in his
[1:00:07] fullness to the believing Jews at
[1:00:10] Pentecost but we're taught that before
[1:00:12] the gospel goes back to the Jews he
[1:00:14] promised to manifest himself in his
[1:00:16] fullness again in John 12:20 it says
[1:00:20] there were certain Greeks among them
[1:00:22] that came up to worship at the feast and
[1:00:24] the same came therefore to Philip which
[1:00:26] was a beta of Galilee and desired him
[1:00:28] saying sir we would see Jesus so the
[1:00:31] Greeks the the Gentiles that's us they
[1:00:34] wanted an audience with
[1:00:37] Christ and philli cometh and tth Andrew
[1:00:39] and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus
[1:00:41] and Jesus answered them saying the hour
[1:00:43] is come that the son of man should be
[1:00:46] glorified verily verily I say to you
[1:00:49] except a corn of wheat fall in the
[1:00:51] ground and die it abideth alone but if
[1:00:53] it die it bringeth forth much fruit so
[1:00:55] his ministry on the Earth was to the
[1:00:57] Jews I hope I'm not moving through this
[1:00:59] too fast this morning but I want you to
[1:01:01] catch it his ministry to the Jews on the
[1:01:03] was on the earth to was to the Jews but
[1:01:05] now his ministry was going to change by
[1:01:08] his death burial and resurrection and he
[1:01:10] was going to come back in his fullness
[1:01:11] on the day of Pentecost but it wouldn't
[1:01:13] be in one body it would be in a many
[1:01:15] membered body we heard this preach last
[1:01:17] night but I had these notes already but
[1:01:20] it's just it it was a Min membered body
[1:01:22] it was the pillar of fire splitting
[1:01:24] himself up into 120
[1:01:26] members in the upper
[1:01:29] room right so now what happened he he
[1:01:32] went into the ground yeah he died Oh my
[1:01:37] he rose again and he and all that was in
[1:01:40] Christ someone say
[1:01:42] all was poured into what the church yeah
[1:01:47] the fullness was poured into the body
[1:01:50] yeah now I'm not the entire body but the
[1:01:52] Joe's not the entire body but all of us
[1:01:55] together yeah this church isn't even the
[1:01:58] entire
[1:01:59] body right it's only a representative of
[1:02:02] the entire
[1:02:03] body right but every Church all around
[1:02:06] the world there's there's Believers and
[1:02:08] unbelievers and make Believers but
[1:02:09] there's some real Believers all around
[1:02:11] the world that make up the body of
[1:02:13] Christ right and them being in the body
[1:02:16] of Christ you being the body of Christ
[1:02:17] means the fullness came to you it come
[1:02:21] at Pentecost now he went into the ground
[1:02:24] and produced Pentecostal fruit and
[1:02:26] Ephesians 1:22 it tells us he has put
[1:02:28] all things under his feet and gave him
[1:02:31] to be head over all things to the church
[1:02:35] which is his body the
[1:02:37] fullness now watch what what's the
[1:02:39] fullness now the fullness was in of
[1:02:42] godhead uh he was the fullness of the
[1:02:44] godhead bodily in a man right the person
[1:02:47] of Jesus Christ but during the Gentile
[1:02:49] age where is his fullness his fullness
[1:02:52] Is Us
[1:02:55] right
[1:02:56] collectively right each one of you
[1:02:58] having a portion so his body the
[1:03:00] fullness of him that filth all in all so
[1:03:05] we are his body that wheat seed fell
[1:03:07] into the ground and it died now we know
[1:03:10] that Christ had to fall into the ground
[1:03:12] and die but brother bam taught us that
[1:03:13] also that first church had to fall into
[1:03:16] the ground and die and we find in the
[1:03:18] scriptures in Revelation 2:4 he said
[1:03:20] nevertheless I have someone against thee
[1:03:22] because thou Hast left thy first love
[1:03:24] right just a few years after Pentecost
[1:03:26] brother steart after receiving him in
[1:03:28] their full in his fullness the church
[1:03:30] began to backslide right it begin to Die
[1:03:33] Why did it die a new generation begin to
[1:03:36] come up that wasn't there at Pentecost
[1:03:38] yeah sir right and they never receive
[1:03:40] what they received at Pentecost and it
[1:03:43] begin to die right and as it it had to
[1:03:46] die it was meant to die because
[1:03:48] otherwise it would have been raptured
[1:03:50] right there but there was more to the
[1:03:52] body right amen so they they had to die
[1:03:56] but and Jude 3 Jude wrote in in 30 years
[1:03:59] after the death of Christ beloved when I
[1:04:01] gave all diligence to write unto you the
[1:04:02] common salvation it was needful for me
[1:04:04] to write unto you and exhort you you
[1:04:06] should earnestly someone say earnestly
[1:04:09] earnestly that means with Zeal with
[1:04:11] Vigor you should earnestly contend for
[1:04:13] the faith which was once delivered to
[1:04:15] the Saints yeah right in other words
[1:04:17] don't give up your Doctrine don't give
[1:04:18] up what you believe don't give up the
[1:04:20] Holy Ghost don't give up the presence of
[1:04:22] God don't give up these things things
[1:04:24] belong to you and it's the antidote for
[1:04:26] sin right that's good so it had to
[1:04:31] die now at Pentecost you know if you
[1:04:34] know the types in the Old Testament I
[1:04:35] don't have time to run into it through
[1:04:37] it today but you know there was a a
[1:04:39] feast in the Old Testament when they
[1:04:41] would take the the the Grain and there
[1:04:43] would be a wave sheath the first fruits
[1:04:45] of the Harvest Right they would wave
[1:04:47] that over the people showing the first
[1:04:49] fruits of the Harvest Christ was the
[1:04:51] wave sheath right right and then uh 50
[1:04:54] days later at Pentecost the wave sheath
[1:04:56] had been baked into
[1:04:58] loaves amen they took the loaves that
[1:05:01] were baked and waved the loaves at
[1:05:04] Pentecost showing that the Harvest had
[1:05:06] been completed and was successful what
[1:05:09] Christ waved on the cross as the wave
[1:05:12] sheath what he waved with his life over
[1:05:14] the Earth was waved back at Pentecost
[1:05:16] showing that the death of Christ the
[1:05:18] death burial and Resurrection was a
[1:05:21] success right do do we believe that
[1:05:23] today amen so it had to but but now what
[1:05:26] had to happen to the church because it
[1:05:28] was not time for a Rapture so it it had
[1:05:31] to die it had to be reborn and it had to
[1:05:34] become bread again yeah right there had
[1:05:37] to be another wave sheath and I believe
[1:05:39] that's the Christ in the message of the
[1:05:41] hour this hour right Christ through his
[1:05:44] messenger in this hour he waved himself
[1:05:46] again over the people and there had to
[1:05:48] be another loaf of bread oh my that
[1:05:50] could be like those in the upper room
[1:05:53] and that's you and I
[1:05:54] so it had to become bread again for the
[1:05:56] second coming of Christ now in
[1:05:58] Deuteronomy 16:3 it explains that it
[1:06:01] said Thou shalt eat no leaven bread with
[1:06:03] it seven days shalt thou eat unleavened
[1:06:05] bread yeah even the bread of Affliction
[1:06:07] for thou comest forth out of the land of
[1:06:08] Egypt in haste thou may remember the day
[1:06:10] when thou camest forth out of the land
[1:06:12] of Egypt all the days of thy life there
[1:06:14] shall be no leaven bread seen with thee
[1:06:16] in all thy Coast Seven Days Seven Days
[1:06:20] someone say seven I'll make sure you're
[1:06:22] getting it this morning some of you look
[1:06:24] a little
[1:06:25] sleepy seven days they ate unleavened
[1:06:29] bread now brother BR said bread is a
[1:06:32] type Jesus said man shall not live by
[1:06:33] bread alone but by every
[1:06:35] word bread is a type of the word he said
[1:06:38] not just a word here and there as
[1:06:40] denominations would have you believe it
[1:06:42] but the word of God is perfect it's God
[1:06:46] himself in letter form called a feet and
[1:06:50] the oh I love this the right kind of
[1:06:52] unadulterated you know what that that
[1:06:54] means some of you kids may not know what
[1:06:56] unadulterated what that means it's not
[1:06:57] mixed with
[1:06:58] anything right the seed oh my the seed
[1:07:01] in it's pure form so you got to have an
[1:07:03] unadulterated word but also an
[1:07:05] unadulterated Faith yeah a word that's
[1:07:08] not mixed with anything and a faith
[1:07:10] that's not mixed to anything I'm telling
[1:07:12] you here this morning how can you have a
[1:07:14] a faith that's not mixed with anything
[1:07:15] if you don't have a word that's not
[1:07:17] mixed with anything you got to have the
[1:07:19] word first the pure word that's why God
[1:07:21] had to send it in our day so we could
[1:07:23] have a pure faith
[1:07:24] fath right so now it's the bread is
[1:07:27] typed he said it's God himself in letter
[1:07:29] form the right kind of an unadulterated
[1:07:31] faith in that word will bring that seed
[1:07:32] to its life he said that's exactly what
[1:07:35] you see now watch he said at night in
[1:07:37] the discernments and all these other
[1:07:40] things because it's a promise that God
[1:07:43] made right you realize that's why no one
[1:07:45] else could have that
[1:07:47] job right well no one else can do what
[1:07:49] brother brandham did when he stood up
[1:07:51] there and he he deser the hearts of the
[1:07:52] people wasn't brother brandham he even
[1:07:54] would tell the people what did he
[1:07:56] say right it wasn't William Brandon and
[1:07:58] let me just I I I know you get out on
[1:08:02] the internet today it's strange how
[1:08:03] persecuted the message well it's not
[1:08:05] strange he said count it not strange
[1:08:08] when these persecutions come but the
[1:08:09] message is under persecution today on
[1:08:11] the internet and you'll find that and I
[1:08:13] know I can tell you just not to read it
[1:08:15] but it's
[1:08:16] everywhere and it's strange they don't
[1:08:18] persecute the Baptist like that or the
[1:08:21] Pentecostals or something else because
[1:08:23] they'll drag up everything they can find
[1:08:25] about the message and in the sense of
[1:08:27] and what's amazing to me is what they
[1:08:28] can't find because we had a prophet that
[1:08:31] lived the
[1:08:32] life right and and mean these other men
[1:08:34] didn't but they'll try to compare him
[1:08:36] with Paul Kaine or or some of those
[1:08:38] charismatic guys that uh if you listen
[1:08:40] to them that somebody had a headache
[1:08:42] somebody had a backache and that's the
[1:08:43] way they would do but brother R's
[1:08:45] Ministry was not that right it was not
[1:08:48] that at all but it was proved over and
[1:08:50] over again to be accurate that he could
[1:08:53] actually tell a person where they come
[1:08:56] from and they say today well that he was
[1:08:58] reading the prayer cards it's nonsense
[1:09:00] because several of us knew people who
[1:09:02] didn't have prayer cards and it's on
[1:09:05] tape right that they were called out
[1:09:07] sister may Brown up here in ALA Missouri
[1:09:09] I was her pastor before she passed away
[1:09:11] and sister Brown had in future home you
[1:09:14] can go find it he said Mrs Brown he said
[1:09:17] if you believe he said your that sinus
[1:09:19] problem will leave you he said you he
[1:09:22] talked about her he said little sitting
[1:09:24] on the edge of her seat and that's
[1:09:25] actually the way sister Brown was she
[1:09:27] did that to the end of her life she sat
[1:09:28] on the edge of her seat in church and
[1:09:30] brother Brown called her out she never
[1:09:32] met him she never got as close to him as
[1:09:34] between uh the front and the back of the
[1:09:36] church she never had a driver's license
[1:09:39] she was a poor woman that that lived in
[1:09:41] altta Missouri and then in West Plains
[1:09:43] Missouri but she believed and God spoke
[1:09:45] to her what was God doing it was more
[1:09:47] than just another sign it was more than
[1:09:49] just another gift it was the sign of the
[1:09:51] Resurrection it was the sign of the son
[1:09:53] of man it was God showing us that the
[1:09:56] life was back in the church again that
[1:09:58] he was present in the church again oh I
[1:10:01] wonder if we can grab a hold of it this
[1:10:03] morning and that's why they try to
[1:10:04] attack it like they do that's why they
[1:10:06] try to say well it was just this that or
[1:10:07] the other they can't explain it because
[1:10:10] it was God
[1:10:11] yeah and we have more proof that this
[1:10:14] message is correct than they have that
[1:10:15] Jesus even
[1:10:17] existed now I believe he did don't you
[1:10:20] we have more proof of this message than
[1:10:23] they do even Bible days because Bible
[1:10:25] days were here again and people who were
[1:10:28] there even the Pentecostals of that day
[1:10:30] would tell you that it was never a man
[1:10:32] more like Jesus Christ than William
[1:10:34] brandom that didn't make him Jesus
[1:10:36] Christ made him a man but he was Washed
[1:10:38] by the
[1:10:40] blood and what it meant was God was
[1:10:42] going to use a vessel again to pour out
[1:10:45] and show us it was the end time we had
[1:10:47] to know it before the end time we had to
[1:10:49] have the faith to take a Rapture and in
[1:10:51] order to do that there the seed had to
[1:10:53] to come to a life brother brand said
[1:10:56] it's God himself in a letter form and
[1:10:58] the right kind of an unadulterated faith
[1:10:59] in that word will bring the seed to its
[1:11:00] life he said that's exactly what you see
[1:11:02] at night in the discernments and all
[1:11:04] these other things because it's a
[1:11:06] promise that God made and he stood by me
[1:11:08] and told me that and told me these
[1:11:09] fakers would rise up but hold steady all
[1:11:12] right he said I believe it and no
[1:11:15] selfish motive to hurt anybody but to be
[1:11:17] reverent to God to do the work that he
[1:11:18] called me to do he said that's why I say
[1:11:20] these things and God confirms it back
[1:11:23] and receives the offer and the Sacrifice
[1:11:25] by vindicating it to be the truth he
[1:11:28] said no question to it he said now watch
[1:11:29] that word he said now we notice here
[1:11:31] seven days that's for every Church age
[1:11:33] he said as that Masterpiece had to die
[1:11:36] in order to be resurrected to redeem us
[1:11:37] all then he had a church set in order at
[1:11:40] Pentecost but that church had to go
[1:11:41] through a sacrifice and the Roman World
[1:11:43] killed it and put it in the ground he
[1:11:46] talked about that Dark Ages critic that
[1:11:47] didn't understand why that they had to
[1:11:49] go through what they went through and I
[1:11:50] know that's a question in your mind
[1:11:52] today I know people want why do we have
[1:11:54] to suffer if we if we believe Christ is
[1:11:56] here why do we have to suffer why do we
[1:11:58] have to go through what we go through
[1:12:00] it's because God knows what's best for
[1:12:02] us he's building something in us he's
[1:12:04] building a character and you got to
[1:12:06] believe that or you'll never make it
[1:12:07] through life
[1:12:09] right he's doing something you don't
[1:12:11] understand right but you understood to
[1:12:14] be baptized and you understood to
[1:12:16] receive the Holy Ghost so the rest
[1:12:19] you'll understand one day we'll
[1:12:21] understand it better as the song says by
[1:12:23] and by y amen when the morning comes
[1:12:27] look now the B said if that man had been
[1:12:29] spiritual the man who was a Critic he
[1:12:31] would have knew that the corn of wheat
[1:12:33] has to die it had to be buried in a
[1:12:35] Roman Cathedral but then the first
[1:12:37] little Sprout of Life came forth in the
[1:12:38] Reformation by Martin Luther the just
[1:12:41] shall not live by a blessed kosher that
[1:12:43] a priest does but by the word of God the
[1:12:46] just shall live by faith oh I I believe
[1:12:49] we live by the word today don't you he
[1:12:51] put up two sprs he said the corn of
[1:12:53] wheat begin to
[1:12:54] grow now he said then Along Came John
[1:12:57] Wesley and added to that he said there
[1:12:58] was many others wingly and them and come
[1:13:00] and denied the Virgin birth and it just
[1:13:02] died down but Along Came the Methodist
[1:13:04] and the tsel the pollen the missionary
[1:13:06] day they preached sanctification added
[1:13:09] the tosel he's talking about the wheat
[1:13:11] plant now or the the corn as well he
[1:13:13] said then Along Came the Pentecostals
[1:13:15] and the shut so much he said to deceive
[1:13:17] the elected said it looks like a real
[1:13:20] grain of wheat opened up there's no
[1:13:21] wheat at all but the life's passing
[1:13:25] through the
[1:13:27] shook right so it didn't come to its
[1:13:29] fullness in Luther yet they were saved
[1:13:32] just like you're
[1:13:33] saved true right because they believed
[1:13:36] God's
[1:13:37] word right and and they and they
[1:13:39] actually was the Holy Ghost that did it
[1:13:41] sir right and and they could raise up
[1:13:44] and rejoice and say praise God for the
[1:13:46] Holy Ghost yeah but all they had was a
[1:13:48] little sprig two sprigs brother said
[1:13:51] come up from the ground as you seen
[1:13:53] morning or wheat begin to come up so
[1:13:55] they begin to H they begin to sprout up
[1:13:58] and that's all they had but yet then
[1:14:00] Wesley come along and he had a lot more
[1:14:02] substance and a Sanctified life but but
[1:14:05] yet that wasn't all of it the life was
[1:14:06] just passing
[1:14:08] through right he said have you noticed
[1:14:10] every 3 years after a great meeting he
[1:14:13] said what takes place a denomination he
[1:14:15] said this is 20 years and no
[1:14:18] denomination so the way we could put
[1:14:20] that is after about 3 years of Revival
[1:14:22] it's that part starts to
[1:14:25] die right that part of the plant begins
[1:14:28] to die because what happens is that the
[1:14:31] plant oh my the plant the life is moving
[1:14:35] on the life is not gone it's moving on
[1:14:39] so the life in the in the stalk the life
[1:14:41] in the in the tossel rather uh that that
[1:14:44] was the Methodist part the tossel the
[1:14:46] life that was in the Shu or or the husk
[1:14:48] of the wheat the life that was in that
[1:14:51] had to pass through that right until the
[1:14:53] plant the stalk the the tossel the husk
[1:14:56] looks completely dead yeah and I I think
[1:15:00] today we can say it's completely dead
[1:15:03] right it's just as dead as could be you
[1:15:05] see well they have music and and
[1:15:07] sometimes shouting and peing in tongues
[1:15:09] and things but it's completely dead
[1:15:11] because there's no word in it to change
[1:15:12] your life right but if we say they're
[1:15:15] completely dead because there's no word
[1:15:16] to change your life then there must be a
[1:15:18] word that can change your life if
[1:15:20] they're completely dead there must be
[1:15:22] something that's complet completely
[1:15:24] alive oh I believe we living in part of
[1:15:26] that today if we could just believe it
[1:15:28] you realize what the challenge is for me
[1:15:30] all week long all week long you get
[1:15:32] unbelief thrown at you from every corner
[1:15:35] you get unbelief from the internet you
[1:15:36] get unbelief from Neighbors you get
[1:15:38] unbelief from work you get unbelief from
[1:15:40] friends even family unbelief just thrown
[1:15:42] at you constantly and the challenge is
[1:15:44] on Sundays and on Wednesdays that we
[1:15:46] would gather you in here and we begin to
[1:15:48] say you need to believe because the
[1:15:50] everything hinges on faith right right
[1:15:53] you can't have nothing without faith
[1:15:55] your good works is not what heals you
[1:15:57] your good works is not what saves you
[1:15:59] it's faith in the atonement of God oh if
[1:16:03] we could just understand if you could
[1:16:05] just believe today sir if we could just
[1:16:07] believe our lives would begin to change
[1:16:10] if we just believe we'd be
[1:16:12] baptized and be receive the Holy Ghost
[1:16:15] but the challenge is to get you to
[1:16:17] believe yes I think we should say like
[1:16:20] the disciples Lord increase our faith
[1:16:22] amen
[1:16:23] Amen brother B said you'll he said he
[1:16:27] said this is 20 years and no
[1:16:28] denomination now many more years than
[1:16:31] that and no denomination he said dear
[1:16:33] dying lamb may it never do that if I go
[1:16:37] in this generation May the people who
[1:16:38] believe this message never stands still
[1:16:40] for a denomination he said you'll die
[1:16:42] right in your track remember that the
[1:16:44] very hour that you mention denomination
[1:16:46] among you I don't care how sincere you
[1:16:48] are take Man For Your Leader instead of
[1:16:50] the Holy Spirit to confirm this word he
[1:16:53] said that's the hour you
[1:16:54] die oh you must be led by the word I
[1:16:57] must be led by the word you got to hold
[1:17:00] what I say back to the word but not your
[1:17:02] idea of what the word says it's got to
[1:17:04] be actually the
[1:17:06] word right and so the the the word has
[1:17:09] to confirm what the preacher's preaching
[1:17:11] the word has to confirm the life that
[1:17:13] you're living the word confirms the
[1:17:15] spirit that's
[1:17:17] present so now he said he said the
[1:17:20] genuine seed cannot I love that
[1:17:23] in other words genuine seed cannot be a
[1:17:26] denomination someone try someone tries
[1:17:28] to put a scare on you and say well you
[1:17:31] know if you have uh good instruments
[1:17:33] you're
[1:17:34] denominational I've heard it like if you
[1:17:36] had carpet on the floor it's
[1:17:38] denominational that's
[1:17:40] nonsense right because that's not
[1:17:42] denominational we're just trying to make
[1:17:44] it as comfortable as we can for people
[1:17:46] we want to do things for your kids it's
[1:17:47] not denominational to have a youth camp
[1:17:49] or or a banquet or or to have a some
[1:17:53] type of an event here at the church it's
[1:17:54] not denominational at all what it is is
[1:17:56] a group of people want to fellowship
[1:17:58] with one another church dinners aren't
[1:18:00] denom the Baptist didn't start
[1:18:03] potluck right we didn't either they
[1:18:05] started them in in the day of Pentecost
[1:18:07] cuz immediately after that they ate at
[1:18:09] each other's house every day so instead
[1:18:11] of doing that we just built a place and
[1:18:13] Y all come
[1:18:14] here right we're just doing what the
[1:18:16] word says are you with me now now if you
[1:18:19] don't want to come to a potluck you
[1:18:20] don't have to that don't mean you're not
[1:18:21] saved it's just something that that we
[1:18:23] want to be around one another we want to
[1:18:26] be around one another we love one
[1:18:27] another and and it shows there's a word
[1:18:29] birth in our life amen now we know that
[1:18:33] brother B the genuine seed cannot be a
[1:18:35] denomination so just Hammer the devil
[1:18:37] with that it cannot be a denomination
[1:18:39] because there's nothing left after the
[1:18:41] seed the life is not passing through the
[1:18:44] seed it's got nowhere else to go it may
[1:18:47] look like it's dead you may look at it
[1:18:48] see there's no moisture there but the
[1:18:50] life is there because that's the the
[1:18:53] only place it can be and it's making it
[1:18:54] back into its original again back into
[1:18:57] its original form now brother BR he
[1:19:00] taught us that he said it's the bride
[1:19:02] that fell into the ground it's the same
[1:19:03] thing went back back at the beginning
[1:19:05] it's the bride that fell into the ground
[1:19:06] to bring forth the corn of wheat again
[1:19:09] we know that and can I say it like this
[1:19:12] the lutherans were born of the word for
[1:19:14] their
[1:19:15] day right they were born into an age
[1:19:18] where the present truth was
[1:19:20] justification and they live by that life
[1:19:23] and under that atmosphere the methodists
[1:19:26] were born under a word of
[1:19:29] sanctification and that age was a long
[1:19:31] age it continued even I even as a child
[1:19:35] I've seen some of them oldtime Methodist
[1:19:37] Wesley Methodist people that really had
[1:19:39] something right they were born of the
[1:19:41] word in their day they didn't know any
[1:19:44] different they they really had something
[1:19:45] it made them live right made them have
[1:19:47] live Sanctified lives and so they they
[1:19:50] were there and they had something but
[1:19:52] watch as the church gets farther and
[1:19:54] farther becomes more worldly and they
[1:19:56] can't even live under sanctification
[1:19:58] anymore because that's not the hour
[1:19:59] we're living in right right they were
[1:20:02] born of the word for their day the life
[1:20:05] traveled through that portion of the
[1:20:06] wheat plant but all the life that was in
[1:20:09] justification came through to
[1:20:11] sanctification all of the life that was
[1:20:14] in sanctification comes through to the
[1:20:16] the the Shu the the outpouring of the
[1:20:19] spirit and the
[1:20:20] gifts right all the life yeah come
[1:20:23] through oh my it traveled through that
[1:20:25] portion of the wheat plant but it could
[1:20:28] not produce a birth of the full word as
[1:20:31] has to happen for the Rapture no more
[1:20:34] than David could be
[1:20:36] Jesus they could not be a word bride oh
[1:20:38] I hope you're hearing me today the Bible
[1:20:40] says they without us could not be
[1:20:42] perfect the Old Testament Saints without
[1:20:44] the New Testament Saints could not be
[1:20:46] perfected because they they they had
[1:20:48] faith and it was counted to them for
[1:20:50] righteousness but there was as of yet
[1:20:52] the time was not there they did not
[1:20:54] understand who Jesus was yeah all right
[1:20:56] right oh my oh my listen in the
[1:20:59] denominational ages God winked at
[1:21:01] ignorance they didn't understand they
[1:21:03] God and God blessed those days he he
[1:21:05] anointed those people to do what they
[1:21:08] did but they could not be the word in
[1:21:10] its fullness I want to challenge you
[1:21:12] with uh you with this this morning we
[1:21:15] can be the word in its fullness we can
[1:21:17] be the walking word we can be and we
[1:21:20] have to be in this age because that's
[1:21:23] the age we've been born
[1:21:25] into we've not been born into an age
[1:21:27] that just allows us to live any way we
[1:21:29] want
[1:21:30] to we've been born into the
[1:21:33] word I hope we see it today now they
[1:21:36] could not be Messiah ET and you know
[1:21:40] what that is a messiah ET that is a term
[1:21:42] brother brandom coin it means little
[1:21:45] messiah messiah means anointed one yeah
[1:21:49] right they could not be a little Messiah
[1:21:52] oh or as brother Randon put an amateur
[1:21:54] God we'll get into that in a moment now
[1:21:57] Romans 8:18 Paul spoke of it he said for
[1:21:59] I reckon the sufferings of this present
[1:22:02] time are you still with me this morning
[1:22:05] I won't hold you all all day I promise
[1:22:08] he said I reckon the sufferings of this
[1:22:09] present time are not worthy to be
[1:22:12] compared with the glory which shall be
[1:22:14] revealed in us for the earnest
[1:22:17] expectation of the creature waiteth for
[1:22:20] the manifestation of the Son of God now
[1:22:23] we know there's a manifestation of the
[1:22:24] sons of God when we get our new bodies
[1:22:27] set there's coming a glorious time do
[1:22:28] you believe that there's coming a
[1:22:30] glorious time when we'll see Christ face
[1:22:32] to face we'll be in our new bodies but
[1:22:34] yet we know that here there's a
[1:22:37] manifestation of the sons of God that
[1:22:39] happens at the end time brother BR said
[1:22:41] he made man a god a God in his domain
[1:22:44] and his domain goes from sea to seea
[1:22:48] from Shore to Shore he has the control
[1:22:51] of it listen to me when you leave here
[1:22:54] you might go home and pass over the
[1:22:56] Border go into Missouri you might pass
[1:22:58] over a border and go into Texas or going
[1:23:00] to Tennessee but you can never pass over
[1:23:03] the border of God's domain right his
[1:23:06] domain all things are under his feet his
[1:23:09] domain no matter what you do you'll
[1:23:11] never leave his domain oh aren't you
[1:23:13] glad for that today that ought to give
[1:23:15] us comfort and strength you said but
[1:23:17] I've been I've lived a bad life I've
[1:23:18] done some things that are wrong you've
[1:23:20] never passed out of God's domain
[1:23:23] his domain goes from sea to Sea from
[1:23:26] Shore to Shore he has the control of it
[1:23:29] and when Jesus came being the one God
[1:23:32] without sin he proved it when the winds
[1:23:35] blowed he said peace be still and when
[1:23:37] the tree he said no man eat from thee
[1:23:39] verily I say unto you he said now watch
[1:23:42] this you're going to have to put on your
[1:23:45] uh on your uh thinking cap for a minute
[1:23:48] he said verily I said you know he's
[1:23:50] quoting scripture Jes Jesus watch you
[1:23:55] this little
[1:23:57] Gods now look that takes away all
[1:24:00] excuses doesn't
[1:24:02] it I'm too weak verily I say unto
[1:24:06] you little
[1:24:09] God I don't mean that as an object of
[1:24:12] worship and he didn't either but it was
[1:24:13] a little
[1:24:14] Creator right
[1:24:16] right now you say well that's not true
[1:24:19] of me it absolutely is true huh know
[1:24:23] there's an old joke I don't mean to joke
[1:24:25] in the Pulpit but it it kind of fits
[1:24:27] here they said if you want to know who
[1:24:29] the real Christian is put your dog and
[1:24:30] your wife in your
[1:24:33] trunk and when they when you in a couple
[1:24:35] hours come back and when you open the
[1:24:37] trunk see who's happy to see
[1:24:45] you don't do
[1:24:49] that but you see you you see you can
[1:24:52] change the
[1:24:54] atmosphere putting your wife in the
[1:24:56] trunk would change the at atmosphere in
[1:24:58] your home
[1:25:01] that's sometimes just withholding the
[1:25:03] credit card can change the
[1:25:06] atmosphere choices you make today five
[1:25:09] years from now kids might determine what
[1:25:11] you are you could be a preacher right
[1:25:13] you could be serving God with all your
[1:25:15] heart or you could be out on the street
[1:25:18] somewhere because something that
[1:25:19] happened in the service this morning
[1:25:22] right things matter you're a he made you
[1:25:25] in the image of God you're a little God
[1:25:27] if we can say it that way and as a born
[1:25:29] again Christian you have the spirit of
[1:25:31] Christ dwelling in you what that means
[1:25:33] is that you are I don't know if this is
[1:25:36] the right word
[1:25:38] undefeatable right cuz he never lost a
[1:25:42] battle how could you lose a battle come
[1:25:44] on yes you might end up like a little
[1:25:47] boy in in a street fight but he's got a
[1:25:50] big daddy yeah
[1:25:52] and he might be getting whooped right
[1:25:54] now but he says daddy's coming yeah and
[1:25:57] I'm just a chip off the old block but
[1:25:59] daddy's coming I'm just got a portion
[1:26:01] but daddy's coming and he's going to
[1:26:02] make things right oh I believe no matter
[1:26:04] what you're going through right now that
[1:26:06] the presence of Christ is here today and
[1:26:08] he's going to make things
[1:26:10] right
[1:26:13] right that's good when he said he proved
[1:26:16] who he was he said peace be still and he
[1:26:18] said no man eat from thee he said verily
[1:26:20] I seen to you the you this little gods
[1:26:22] if you'll say to this mountain be moved
[1:26:24] don't doubt in your heart but believe
[1:26:26] that what you said will come to pass you
[1:26:28] can have what you've said he said go
[1:26:31] right back to Genesis to the original
[1:26:32] what is it he said now the world and
[1:26:34] nature is groaning crying everything's
[1:26:37] moving what for the manifestation of the
[1:26:39] sons of God when true Sons born Sons
[1:26:43] filled Sons speak and their word is
[1:26:46] backed now think about it for a minute
[1:26:48] and that's why the emphasis in this day
[1:26:51] and and I want to be careful with this
[1:26:53] because we believe that all of the life
[1:26:55] comes through so we still believe in
[1:26:57] healing by laying on of hands we still
[1:27:00] believe in prayer lines altar calls
[1:27:02] right we still believe in shouting
[1:27:04] speaking in tongues all the gifts of the
[1:27:06] Spirit we believe in that yes but yet
[1:27:09] the emphasis in this day was to have all
[1:27:12] that life
[1:27:14] plus brother brand tells us that he said
[1:27:16] it's all that plus so in this day
[1:27:19] there's going to come some Sons and
[1:27:21] Daughters of God yeah that when they
[1:27:23] speak their word is
[1:27:28] backed well what if I asked for the
[1:27:30] wrong thing he said the bride would have
[1:27:31] thus say the Lord would keep still yeah
[1:27:34] right and so you understand what he's
[1:27:36] doing right now is he's he's making us
[1:27:38] but Logan he's making us into what he
[1:27:39] wants us to be but the things we go
[1:27:41] through in life he's molding
[1:27:44] us because you can't brother R said
[1:27:47] power without character is satanic
[1:27:49] right oh he said character is not a gift
[1:27:52] it's a victory yeah right right and
[1:27:54] you're going to have power one day yes
[1:27:56] you may feel powerless right now but
[1:27:58] there's coming a day you're going to
[1:27:59] have power but what you don't understand
[1:28:01] is you can have power here but first the
[1:28:03] flesh has to be under
[1:28:06] subjection right so there's got to come
[1:28:08] to a place where true Sons born Sons
[1:28:11] filled Sons speak and their word is
[1:28:15] backed I'm not crazy this morning that's
[1:28:17] what a prophet taught he said I believe
[1:28:19] we're on the border of it right now
[1:28:22] right I think it's amazing this is right
[1:28:24] before the opening of the word so we're
[1:28:26] on the border of it right now say to
[1:28:29] this mountain let it be so yeah he said
[1:28:31] now then you're a you're a Son of God in
[1:28:33] the house of God you're a part of God's
[1:28:36] economy right you're a part of God's
[1:28:39] economy what that means is the benefits
[1:28:41] of the of the Messiah economy is yours
[1:28:46] right you have the benefits of a messiah
[1:28:48] economy you know when you if you have a
[1:28:50] I don't have my wallet with me but if
[1:28:51] you have a dollar bill
[1:28:52] the reason you carry it with such
[1:28:53] confidence is you have the benefits of
[1:28:55] an American economy right if I go
[1:28:57] overseas I when if I can use American
[1:29:00] money if they'll take it that what it
[1:29:02] means is and most anybody will they're
[1:29:05] glad to get it because it has a
[1:29:07] purchasing power beyond what their
[1:29:09] dollar does because I'm a beneficiary of
[1:29:11] the American economy my passport means
[1:29:14] more at a border and this is still true
[1:29:16] even after all these years and all the
[1:29:18] nonsense that's gone on in our
[1:29:19] government our passports still mean more
[1:29:21] at a border than anybody else's does if
[1:29:24] you go through with an American passport
[1:29:25] you get treated differently going into
[1:29:27] an African country or or an Asian
[1:29:30] country and so when you go in you you
[1:29:32] you have an American passport you're a
[1:29:33] part of the American economy oh God if
[1:29:36] we could only realize this morning
[1:29:38] you're a part of the Christian economy
[1:29:40] you're a part of the economy of God it
[1:29:42] means you have a currency faith that you
[1:29:44] can use when your children are sick you
[1:29:46] can speak to that mountain it'll be
[1:29:47] moved when you're when there's problems
[1:29:49] in the home you can speak to your home
[1:29:51] and things will begin to come right
[1:29:53] you're an atmosphere Creator
[1:29:56] yes you can do what the word says and
[1:30:00] change your life the life in your home
[1:30:02] the atmosphere in your
[1:30:03] home right sir why because that's who
[1:30:07] you are you're in under the economy of
[1:30:09] God now he said Romans 81 I love this in
[1:30:14] God's economy there's no condemnation to
[1:30:18] them which are in Christ Jesus you need
[1:30:21] to repeat that scripture and throw it in
[1:30:22] the devil's face every time he tries to
[1:30:25] condemn you for what's under the blood
[1:30:27] because you cannot be condemned there is
[1:30:30] no condemnation Hallelujah there is no
[1:30:34] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[1:30:36] Jesus they tell me I don't know if it's
[1:30:38] true but I've been told in a lot of the
[1:30:41] Indian languages there was no word for
[1:30:43] lie they they did not understand that
[1:30:46] the that the government was lying to
[1:30:48] them when they put them on reservations
[1:30:49] because they didn't even have a word to
[1:30:51] express Express lie and I'm here to tell
[1:30:53] you this morning that there is no word
[1:30:56] to express condemnation in the economy
[1:30:58] of God there is no word that can bring
[1:31:01] back your past in the economy of God but
[1:31:03] it's been washed by the blood of the
[1:31:05] Lamb you are The sinless Virtuous bride
[1:31:08] of Jesus Christ yes
[1:31:10] sir wonderful I don't mean you won't
[1:31:13] have scars right it don't mean the
[1:31:15] Pastor won't have to deal with you
[1:31:16] sometimes talk harshly to you at times
[1:31:18] and other ministers might preach right
[1:31:20] down your alley but you're a child of
[1:31:22] God yeah the devil will try to bring
[1:31:25] condemnation that's his job he's the
[1:31:26] accuser of the Brethren right yes but
[1:31:29] he's a failure come on Hallelujah he's a
[1:31:32] failure at it because he cannot stand in
[1:31:34] the presence of an open book yes that's
[1:31:36] got your name on it sir that's good amen
[1:31:41] now
[1:31:42] look I'm running out of time now look he
[1:31:45] said when the waters Hallelujah he said
[1:31:49] let me go back he said there's no
[1:31:50] condemnation than which you're in Christ
[1:31:51] Jesus for dead to the world alive in him
[1:31:53] living in this present day making the
[1:31:55] word that God has used them for ordained
[1:31:58] them placing their name in this bride
[1:32:00] book and when the waters comes upon that
[1:32:03] seed that's in the heart raises it up to
[1:32:05] the bride of Christ in Luther's day it
[1:32:08] could only come up so far in Wesley's
[1:32:10] day it could only come up so far but in
[1:32:12] this age it comes all the way up he said
[1:32:15] just as perfect as it can be in every
[1:32:17] age it's been that way the Lutheran
[1:32:19] under justification the feet raised it
[1:32:21] like that West under sanctification and
[1:32:22] Pentecostal under the arms the works and
[1:32:24] deeds and so forth had to be calvinist
[1:32:26] had to be Armenian had to be legalist

[1:34:41] church together with the entire deity of
[1:34:43] God amongst his people showing the same
[1:34:46] visible signs manifesting himself like
[1:34:48] he did at the beginning that was in
[1:34:50] Christ when he was manifested on Earth
[1:34:51] and in the form of a prophet God he said
[1:34:53] Oh Glory promised by Malachi 4 promised
[1:34:55] by the rest of the scriptures he said
[1:34:57] where do you worship at the house of God
[1:35:00] seated in present
[1:35:03] tense now look can I have just a few
[1:35:06] more minutes I I got myself a few more
[1:35:09] minutes on my clock but that's not
[1:35:10] always
[1:35:12] correct I told brother Tim PR last night
[1:35:14] I said you know I said Jesus said I have
[1:35:16] much more to tell you but you cannot
[1:35:18] bear it
[1:35:19] now and uh brother Tim
[1:35:22] man that man can just lay it in preach
[1:35:23] and preach and preach and preach and and
[1:35:26] to be honest sometimes I'd love to do
[1:35:28] that but I know that you can only bear
[1:35:29] so much of my preaching now if I got to
[1:35:31] listen to a man like brother Tim all the
[1:35:33] time I could bear
[1:35:35] more but I know you can only bear so
[1:35:38] much of my preaching so I'll hurry but
[1:35:40] look he said when look look at the woman
[1:35:43] at the well let's look at her as an
[1:35:44] example now when the woman at the well
[1:35:47] saw the sign of the son of man she knew
[1:35:49] the Messiah was there there in his
[1:35:53] fullness right she
[1:35:56] understood now why did she understand
[1:35:58] not so much cuz she'd been taught
[1:36:00] although there had to be some exposure
[1:36:01] to the word or she wouldn't have known
[1:36:03] the things that she knew right so it's
[1:36:06] important what we teach our children
[1:36:07] what our Sunday school teachers teach
[1:36:08] our children is important because it
[1:36:11] gives them an expectation of the word
[1:36:13] right and so that what's that is that's
[1:36:16] very important when we teach our
[1:36:17] children but she maybe she had been
[1:36:19] taught as a child but she didn't live
[1:36:20] that way right she didn't live like
[1:36:23] she'd been taught like some of you like
[1:36:25] like me we didn't always live what we'd
[1:36:27] been taught but one day Hallelujah we
[1:36:31] come in the presence of Jesus Christ and
[1:36:34] when we come in his presence what
[1:36:36] happened things begin to
[1:36:38] change all
[1:36:41] right I I just want to tell you what
[1:36:44] this message means to me today as I I
[1:36:46] looked at it and I be to see it for
[1:36:48] myself as a child and I was uh 12 13 14
[1:36:52] years old and I've been brought up on
[1:36:54] deep calls to the Deep I've been brought
[1:36:55] up on the the seals I've been brought up
[1:36:57] on all of those things but as I got
[1:36:59] older it be to mean something to me
[1:37:01] brother Bill I be to see there was a
[1:37:03] prophet in our day he wasn't like all
[1:37:04] the other Pentecostal preachers he
[1:37:06] didn't need to uh to to scream and yell
[1:37:08] and those things and although that that
[1:37:09] would be fine and wonderful I do it
[1:37:11] sometimes but he just gentle and he
[1:37:13] stood there and he discerned the secrets
[1:37:14] of the heart and I begin to realize
[1:37:16] there was something to it yeah and it
[1:37:18] showed me there oh God if if God was
[1:37:21] alive and William brandham he must still
[1:37:23] be alive today and I was presented with
[1:37:27] doctrines I said well brother brandham
[1:37:29] has to come back or or something else or
[1:37:30] there's going to be another prophet and
[1:37:32] I had to reject that because God's word
[1:37:34] doesn't teach that but it does teach us
[1:37:36] that there's a sign of the son of man
[1:37:38] that's still here yes
[1:37:41] sir and when the woman at the well saw
[1:37:45] that oh my sir brother BR said he didn't
[1:37:48] have to do it all those times he only
[1:37:50] had to do it once
[1:37:52] and we saw it
[1:37:54] hundreds hundreds of
[1:37:58] times there's hundreds of times that he
[1:38:00] did it without a prayer card yeah
[1:38:02] without ever meeting the person right
[1:38:05] without ever knowing what was going
[1:38:06] hundreds of times some of you are
[1:38:08] witnesses of those
[1:38:11] times talk to some of your elders
[1:38:13] sometimes they know a few things I've
[1:38:15] seen a few things they've been around
[1:38:18] some of you witnessed those things and
[1:38:19] you know you know what happened back
[1:38:21] there but I'm here to tell you that same
[1:38:23] Messiah is still here he was proving he
[1:38:26] was here brother said that was my
[1:38:27] message to show he's here look he told
[1:38:31] her her life she knew the Messiah was
[1:38:33] there in fullness so he he told her her
[1:38:35] life and then revealed to her where
[1:38:36] God's place of worship was and the woman
[1:38:39] said to him in John 4:25 I know that
[1:38:41] Messiah cometh which is called Christ
[1:38:43] when he has come he will tell us all
[1:38:45] things and Jesus saith unto her I that
[1:38:48] speak unto thee am he you say well well
[1:38:51] if that was him wouldn't everybody
[1:38:53] believe it why is there so much nonsense
[1:38:54] on the internet can you imagine what the
[1:38:56] internet would say about Jesus all
[1:39:00] right what they do
[1:39:02] say right but think about what they said
[1:39:05] would have said in that time an
[1:39:07] illegitimate child that was the story
[1:39:09] born of a Roman soldier that's what they
[1:39:11] told themselves to try to give
[1:39:13] themselves Comfort because they didn't
[1:39:14] want to believe that he was the Christ
[1:39:16] CU they'd have to live right they'd have
[1:39:19] to follow him amen so didn't want to
[1:39:21] believe in who he was so they had to
[1:39:23] make up stories about him they they
[1:39:24] pulled him into six trials listen he
[1:39:27] went through six trials in one night and
[1:39:29] not one of them had anything bad to say
[1:39:31] about him so they made stuff
[1:39:34] up that's right oh God they made it up
[1:39:36] and they said well he's not traditional
[1:39:38] he's not like he's teaching his
[1:39:39] doctrine's different it's the same thing
[1:39:41] they've done
[1:39:42] today are you with me now wouldn't
[1:39:44] everybody have known wouldn't everybody
[1:39:46] know today no it's only he said blessed
[1:39:48] are your eyes that they can see your
[1:39:50] ears that they taking it
[1:39:52] here and Jesus spoke plainly to her he
[1:39:54] said I that speak unto thee am
[1:39:57] he and the disciples came and said
[1:40:00] wonder why in this service no one
[1:40:03] stopped them from talking to each
[1:40:06] other oh my and the woman I believe God
[1:40:11] ordained that time for her to receive
[1:40:14] what she needed I believe God's ordained
[1:40:16] this time this morning for you to
[1:40:18] receive what you need yes
[1:40:21] the woman realized there's something
[1:40:24] more to this man and the woman what' she
[1:40:27] do the woman left her water
[1:40:29] pot I love how first she perceived that
[1:40:32] he was a prophet and then she found out
[1:40:36] that he was the
[1:40:37] Messiah now watch we perceived a prophet
[1:40:40] in our day yeah but we didn't find that
[1:40:42] he was the Messiah because again it's a
[1:40:43] body move but we found out that the
[1:40:46] Messiah was
[1:40:48] here oh hope you're hear me this morning
[1:40:51] yeah the woman left her water pot amen
[1:40:55] and she went her way into the City and
[1:40:58] said to the men come see a man which
[1:41:01] told me all things that I ever did is
[1:41:03] not this the Christ she was so changed
[1:41:06] that she went back to the men the very
[1:41:08] men that knew her life the very but it
[1:41:10] wasn't about her anymore her testimony
[1:41:12] wasn't about what she had done her
[1:41:14] testimony was of a risen resurrected
[1:41:16] Jesus
[1:41:18] Christ Hallelujah
[1:41:21] now she said come see a man that told me
[1:41:23] is not this the Christ this is the
[1:41:26] fullness they never said that about
[1:41:27] Moses or David the Bible says as it was
[1:41:30] in the days of lot they did eat they
[1:41:31] drank they bought they sold they planted
[1:41:33] they builded but the same day that lot
[1:41:34] went out of Sodom it rained fire and
[1:41:36] Prince from Heaven destroyed them all
[1:41:38] even thus shall it be in the day when
[1:41:40] the son of man is revealed but the said
[1:41:41] look what happened to lot and then down
[1:41:42] in Sodom of Billy Graham and or Roberts
[1:41:44] look at the elected Abraham Church
[1:41:45] pulled out look what kind of sign that
[1:41:47] Jesus himself the Incarnate God standing
[1:41:49] there in human flesh you say that was an
[1:41:51] angel the Bible said it was God Lord God
[1:41:53] Elohim standing there in human flesh
[1:41:54] showing he would do he would listen he
[1:41:57] wasn't just showing he would anoint a
[1:41:59] prophet but he was showing he would
[1:42:00] anoint his church in the last days it'd
[1:42:03] be God working in human flesh again as
[1:42:05] it was in the days of Sodom so shall it
[1:42:07] be at the coming of the son of man it's
[1:42:10] why it was one to an age it's Unique it
[1:42:13] was a sign of the Messiah what does it
[1:42:15] mean to
[1:42:17] us brother brand said I'm skipping down
[1:42:19] through some things
[1:42:21] he said one Angel stayed back a
[1:42:22] messenger with the elected group and
[1:42:25] what kind of a sign did he do he what
[1:42:27] did Abraham call him Elohim God
[1:42:29] manifested in flesh Jesus showing that
[1:42:33] he himself God in him will be manifested
[1:42:36] where in his bride in the last days all
[1:42:40] right glory to God I believe it this
[1:42:43] morning I ask you when we come out does
[1:42:45] it still work would you still testify
[1:42:47] does it still work yes it works today
[1:42:50] why does do baptism work today why does
[1:42:52] the Holy Ghost work today because you've
[1:42:54] been born into the word age you've been
[1:42:57] born by the word into the bride age oh
[1:42:59] it will be manifested in his bride in
[1:43:02] the last
[1:43:03] days I I'll do this and I'll close
[1:43:06] there's four stages of growth that's
[1:43:08] taking place in some of your lives
[1:43:10] sister Fritz I think you're are you 90
[1:43:13] now 90 years old brother Bill you're
[1:43:17] almost that old not quite a few years
[1:43:21] shy now look in your time you probably
[1:43:24] saw people with horses and Buggies not
[1:43:27] Amish people but right just regular
[1:43:30] people in their lifetime right and think
[1:43:34] about it and then it come on up through
[1:43:36] and they had cars right automobiles but
[1:43:39] they weren't much a few of them were but
[1:43:42] most of them weren't much sorry brother
[1:43:46] Harold Harold loves his old
[1:43:49] cars but there's a reason you don't
[1:43:51] drive that that model tea when it's real
[1:43:56] cold right because it's there's
[1:43:59] something about it wasn't Advanced now
[1:44:00] think for thousands of years everybody
[1:44:04] went by horse and
[1:44:05] buggy and all of a
[1:44:08] sudden they got
[1:44:10] cars and it changed the
[1:44:13] world all of the sudden it was just a
[1:44:15] few years and the R Brothers invented
[1:44:18] the
[1:44:19] airplane and and the airplane begin to
[1:44:22] fly and now people were flying and I'll
[1:44:25] be honest there was a lot of people who
[1:44:27] didn't believe man would ever fly
[1:44:29] there's a story about my
[1:44:30] great-grandmother I believe it is that
[1:44:32] when they uh when they first got
[1:44:34] electric light she didn't believe in
[1:44:35] electric light she didn't know what you
[1:44:38] were talking about just like someone in
[1:44:40] another age wouldn't know what you're
[1:44:41] talking about the message of the hour
[1:44:43] right you can't expect them to right
[1:44:45] right because they don't they don't
[1:44:47] understand but here there was electric
[1:44:48] light and I I remember uh she made them
[1:44:51] keep them off she never they finally
[1:44:52] installed them in her house I think it
[1:44:53] was her and she made them turn them off
[1:44:55] they never never could believe that the
[1:44:57] electric
[1:44:58] light wouldn't burn down the
[1:45:02] house my grandpa got into a car my great
[1:45:04] grandpa got into a car for the first
[1:45:05] time and they said he got into his model
[1:45:07] te and he drove it right straight down
[1:45:09] the hill going whoa whoa pulling on the
[1:45:11] steering
[1:45:13] wheel it's a different age yeah it's
[1:45:16] hard to teach Old Dogs new tricks why
[1:45:18] some of you still don't have cell phones
[1:45:23] it's hard for me my son knows way more
[1:45:24] about technology than I do that's to
[1:45:26] challenge Parents try to keep them out
[1:45:27] with some stuff they need to stay out of
[1:45:30] right because they know more about
[1:45:31] technology than we do why because it's a
[1:45:34] different age right the iPhone come just
[1:45:36] what 15 years ago changed the
[1:45:39] world right believe it or not they
[1:45:41] didn't have
[1:45:42] Facebook until what 2015 2010 something
[1:45:45] like 2010 20 2009 I think I was an early
[1:45:49] adopter but we lived without
[1:45:52] it can you imagine what life was like
[1:45:55] without Facebook without without an
[1:45:57] automobile without an airplane now look
[1:45:59] it moved all the way up until they put
[1:46:01] men in a tube and sent them into outer
[1:46:04] space now that takes some
[1:46:05] Faith especially if you're the guy in
[1:46:07] the
[1:46:08] tube right because I don't think the
[1:46:10] monkey
[1:46:12] lived but they sent a guy up there and
[1:46:14] and and he's up there flying above the
[1:46:17] Earth and there's still people don't
[1:46:19] believe that ever happened
[1:46:21] happened right because it's just it's
[1:46:23] not fathomable how could you do that
[1:46:25] with a SL rule if you don't believe that
[1:46:27] that's fine you can have your opinion
[1:46:30] that's you know why I believe in the
[1:46:32] astronaut age or was astronauts because
[1:46:33] we're living in a spiritual astronaut
[1:46:36] age Hallelujah brother Bram talks about
[1:46:39] it he talked about coming from the horse
[1:46:41] and buggy to the automobile he said that
[1:46:42] was like coming from the Lutheran age to
[1:46:44] the Wesleyan age he said when a man is
[1:46:46] filled with the Holy Ghost there's
[1:46:47] something in him that's full of God's
[1:46:49] spiritual vitamin makes him and praise
[1:46:50] God shout and act different he said
[1:46:53] because why he's no longer Earthbound
[1:46:55] he's in the heavens sailing around in
[1:46:56] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus he said
[1:46:58] he left them Earthbound with their
[1:46:59] bicycles and Automobiles they've went to
[1:47:02] the air he said yes they're practically
[1:47:04] taken them out of there out of date he
[1:47:05] said they healed the sick they spoken
[1:47:07] unknown languages and done many things
[1:47:09] now even your bicycles are
[1:47:13] electric he said but now friends may I
[1:47:15] say this he said it has come to the age
[1:47:18] of astronaut we have moved out of the
[1:47:20] airplane age we got more power now you
[1:47:23] look back and say well I wish we had the
[1:47:25] power of of 1906 I wish we had the power
[1:47:27] of the West age I wish we had the power
[1:47:29] of all night prayer meetings you got
[1:47:31] more power now yes yes Hallelujah sir
[1:47:36] Hallelujah we got more power now the
[1:47:38] astronaut and age has come in what is it
[1:47:39] we've come into a spiritual age of
[1:47:41] astronaut going above it's the same
[1:47:43] Spirit he said only more power only
[1:47:45] lifted higher can go higher see more
[1:47:47] believe more be more like Christ do you
[1:47:49] believe that today
[1:47:51] not the automobile not the horse and
[1:47:52] buggy not even the airplane but the
[1:47:54] astronaut he sweeps on and above each
[1:47:56] one it's called The Eagle agent in the
[1:47:58] Bible God calls His prophets Eagle age
[1:48:00] he said we realize Malachi 4 were
[1:48:02] promised in the last days he likes his
[1:48:03] Prophets The Eagles he calls himself
[1:48:05] Eagle he is the great Jehovah Eagle
[1:48:07] listen he is able if you were there
[1:48:10] Friday nights you heard brother uh
[1:48:12] brother uh Wayne preach he is able yes
[1:48:15] he is able I believe he's able today he
[1:48:18] is able to achieve to him himself a
[1:48:21] bride he is going to in the last day oh
[1:48:24] that gives me great comfort Ste no
[1:48:26] matter what our efforts are they might
[1:48:27] be good it might fail but we know he's
[1:48:29] able we might fail as preachers but he's
[1:48:32] able to achieve to himself a bride he's
[1:48:35] going in the last days to be able to get
[1:48:36] a bride with the ministry so exactly he
[1:48:38] said like a man and his wife becomes one
[1:48:40] when Jehovah gets his people like him he
[1:48:42] lives in his people they are one he said
[1:48:46] it fulfills the scripture John 1412 he
[1:48:48] that believeth on me the works that I do
[1:48:49] shall he also fulfills what Jesus said
[1:48:51] as it was in the days of Sodom so shall
[1:48:53] it be in the coming of the son of man he
[1:48:55] said now is the astronut age and
[1:48:57] astronut sees things that all these
[1:48:58] other ages didn't see he said he's he
[1:49:01] said the airplane still down here
[1:49:02] bouncing around in the clouds having
[1:49:04] blowouts hit downs and everything else
[1:49:07] but he goes beyond the clouds of Creeds
[1:49:09] and denominations moves on up into the
[1:49:11] heavens Plum away from
[1:49:13] everything
[1:49:15] Hallelujah he said the only thing he has
[1:49:17] to do I'm skipping brother Robert I'm
[1:49:18] sorry only thing you has to do is get
[1:49:20] somebody in his hands that can cut loose
[1:49:23] from airplanes and Automobiles yeah what
[1:49:25] more not look back to what it was but
[1:49:28] more power to lift him higher lift him
[1:49:30] into the presence of God lift him up
[1:49:32] where someone say all things all things
[1:49:35] all things are possible he said now we
[1:49:38] see it's
[1:49:41] happening oh
[1:49:43] Church means the mechanics and the
[1:49:45] Dynamics are
[1:49:46] here well I don't feel it but it's
[1:49:49] available it's right here why he was the
[1:49:53] fullness his presence in the church is
[1:49:54] the fullness he is the word he is the
[1:49:57] fullness he is the mechanics and the
[1:49:59] Dynamics sir Hallelujah he's in the boat
[1:50:02] amen do you believe it
[1:50:03] today amen he said he said that we see
[1:50:06] it happening there's no doubt to it he
[1:50:08] said so does the spiritual astronaut as
[1:50:10] the natural astronaut goes on above the
[1:50:11] planes planes always wrecking up and
[1:50:13] fussing in the
[1:50:15] clouds right that's the problem why
[1:50:17] churches fuss with one another cuz
[1:50:19] they're still in a airplane
[1:50:21] age we got to come higher than that
[1:50:24] church into brotherly love yes yes right
[1:50:27] which is the last thing to be restored
[1:50:29] to the church before the coming of the
[1:50:30] calf Stone right brotherly love go look
[1:50:32] at the the pyramid goes from the bottom
[1:50:34] to the top it was Brotherly Love was
[1:50:37] taken off first it goes back on last
[1:50:40] onto the bride tree now look he said
[1:50:42] you're fussing in the clouds there could
[1:50:44] be nothing greater no more achievement
[1:50:45] than the astronaut only thing he has to
[1:50:47] do is just musicians go ahead and come
[1:50:48] only thing he has to do is just keep
[1:50:50] keep putting more power he'll go
[1:50:52] anywhere he wants
