and if you would turn with me in your bibles if you can or up on the screen second peter we'll begin reading second peter chapter one amen just good to be in the house of lord this evening amen just hope something said tonight amen that would be a blessing to you i'd like to speak if i could on our time amen this is this is our time this is what we've been called for this is what god has predestinated us to and and we've got to take a stand amen amen i had to i had mattie take some notes the other day while brother ben was preaching and he wrote down two two little sentences and i don't remember what day this was but it was answer the message and answer the hour so kind of gave me a little inspiration uh for tonight amen just uh i believe you know we've heard the message but we've got to do something about it it's okay to identify the message but we've got to identify ourselves in that message amen amen besides this we'll begin reading verse five and besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and divert you knowledge into knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that you shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ but he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see afar off and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if you do these things you shall never fall i believe that's every believer's desire and heart is not to fail the lord but to go through faithful amen if we could just let's bow our heads just at the reading of the word and just say a word of prayer before we start and maybe if you have an unspoken request why don't you just make it known by lifting a hand amen that god will just speak to you tonight lord i pray god you just come and just use me tonight lord i pray you move me aside lord and i just just render myself my spirit my soul my body to you tonight god that you just come and speak to your children lord you see the needs of the people or i pray that something to be said to bless them and just encourage them along their way or just something that be said just to make their their journey just a little bit easier and god i pray you just bless the people who couldn't come tonight lord if there be any sick lord i pray that just while the word comes forth or the healing power would go with it as well in jesus christ's name we pray amen amen you can have your seeds amen so i just want to speak just for a few moments just on our time and identifying you know you know that this is our time to be the manifested sons and daughters of god is that right so we see that daniel had what it take had what it took to overcome but he didn't actually express that until he was thrown in the lines then is that right and it seems like in this day you know we've known that the word would overcome anything that satan would throw at it we know that the word would overcome anything that the world could do and now it's in this day we're actually seeing the worst that the world has ever been but the word will overcome is that right so brother branham says in the reproach of the cause of the word he says and god sets a time and he has a purpose for everything he does there's nothing that happens accidentally to those who love the lord and are called to his calling so everything that happens in our life god has foreordained that and set a plan for that to happen in our lives amen we are predestinated and everything works just right for that because he cannot lie now as believers everything we've been through we say well it didn't really work right but it works the way god needed it to work not the way we needed it to work amen he said so and that's everything has its time and its season and it has its way and god is behind every move are you thankful for that this evening and sometimes you think that everything is going wrong he said it's up to us those things are put upon us trials and wonderings it's testing to see how we we will react to an action so we see that everything god does is he does for a purpose to make us either better christians or he's purifying the goal he's taking everything out of us that's wrong to create something in us that's good is that right now this uh this word manifest it means to render or apparent or declare so to manifest is to bring something on the inside and reveal it on the outside amen now second corinthians 4 8 it says we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed always bearing about the body of the dying of the lord jesus that in that the life also of jesus might be made manifest in our body so we see that the life that was in christ now has to be made manifest in our life amen it's no longer i'm expressing alan or i'm expressing this it's i'm expressing christ amen is that right in the flesh and so we see that something has to manifest itself in our life what's on the inside must show and in this day in this harvest time and harvest season the seventh hour it's the time of the revealing of the fruits is that right it's time for the wheat to show what it actually is the tares have been separated the wheat is showing what it is so if you look at if you look at your life and you're manifesting something that's not of christ then you have something wrong on the inside is that right i mean the scripture says by their fruits you shall know them if i walk up to an apple tree and it has apples on it i know that's an apple tree i don't say well that's an orange tree that's why i don't walk up to to message people and if they're living wrong living in sin doing this gossiping causing trouble i don't walk them and say those are christians because that's not the life of christ is that right amen do you love the lord amen do you know the the song everybody will be happy over there you know the reason it it says that is because all the the gossip the bad things will not be over there amen amen do you love the lord this evening amen so verse 11 for we which live are always delivered unto death for jesus sake for that the life of christ might be made manifest in our mortal flesh so we see that that you know we we always look at the flesh and we say well we're not good enough this isn't good enough but that life that was in christ has to be made manifest in this day through our flesh is that right i know if god's gonna move if god's gonna speak i want it to be through me is that right if he's gonna use anybody in this hour i want him to use me in whatever way he sees fit i believe that we ought to you know he doesn't it's not that god it requires our praise but he deserves our praise is that right he deserves our worship then in this day when it's the darkest hour that's when we need to praise him the most is that right we see you know jesus when he was here on earth he wasn't satisfied with just healings but he had to identify who he was and you know the pharisees everybody was fine with him healing everybody and and even even preaching a little bit when he began to say that he was the son of god that's when they begin to have problems amen and the devil's okay with you coming to church he's okay with you getting healed he's okay with you doing this and that but when you begin to identify yourself as a son and daughter of god that's when he has a problem amen amen do you love the lord this evening and brother braham says and i know my redeemer liveth he says no matter how little you are how big you are how important you are or how unimportant you are you are here to serve a purpose amen are you thankful for that even us unimportant people god has a purpose god has a plan for our life he says just as my finger is here to serve a purpose my nail on my finger serves a purpose he says my eye and every part of our body is to serve a purpose and it was not only put here to see what we would look like when we were put here but it was here to serve a purpose it was god's divine plan to do so he said nothing can harm us until that purpose that god has put us here for has been made manifest he said no matter how much trouble we have no matter how much heartaches or sorrow we go through all of these are reasons and there or he says all of these have a reason there's a reason for it so so whatever you're going through whatever you've been through god has a reason for it amen we can't see it right now we may look and it just may looks like a terrible outcome but god will see us through amen i believe if we depend on him he'll see us through amen now you know david could testify about the line and the bear but then then goliath showed up is that right so we see that when the enemy comes up we can look at our testimonies and i know the scripture says we overcome by the word of the lord of the blood of the lamb and the word of our testimony but when we come to our next battle we can't just say well he did this he did that we've got to face that battle amen we've got to fight that battle i believe his message people we can't get complacent we can't get satisfied with our current state we've got to press towards the mark of the high calling amen we've got to until we take a rapture we should be striving to get closer to him amen now matthew 7 20 i'll just throw this in there it says wherefore by their fruits you shall know them now the fruit is the manifestation of the seed is that right so what the seed is you don't know what a seed is if i laid a bunch of seeds out here you wouldn't know maybe perhaps what the seeds would be but if i laid the fruits out here you would know what those seeds had manifested is that right we don't you know we don't um we don't look at seeds and and say well this is going to be this or this is going to be that maybe somebody's very good and and can do that but i can't you know we've got to look at the fruit is that right and so we're not here to judge one another or look at this one or look at that one or or to say well well this is that or this is that because we don't know what the seed is on the inside is that right you know it doesn't always show what's on the inside you know brother braham says a harlot could walk across a platform and get healed a lot a lot quicker than a christian because of their faith and so what i want to say to that is that you know we can't look at one another and say well that's not what the christian person should look like because god may not be done in their life is that right it may not be their manifesting season amen so we see that you know that god didn't call us to be a squatter he caught us to to own our land and he he gave us the rights as christians and believers that when we stood upon the word of god whatever we would ask in his name he would give it to us is that right and so we can't let satan come in and and take control of that and and say well you know it was good for paul it was good for this one it was good for that one but it's not good for you and so we see that that when god when satan begins to do that we begin to become satisfied and say well where i'm at is okay and i don't think as christians we should ever do that you believe that this evening now we're called for a reason just as ruth was called to bow as the bride is being called to christ is that right we're on a journey to meet our bridegroom is that right now the call has been manifested through our lives and we see that it's not through religion it's not through this because churches will come people will come and churches will go and people will go but if you've got something on the inside you'll stay with the word of god is that right whenever you hear the word of god you'll dot it with an amen is that right whenever the word of god comes forth there's just something on the inside of you you can't help it even if you don't like the man or the ministry or anything like that you have to say amen to it is that right now brother brandon says there's one thing that won't go the holy spirit because it's his word he said a real predestinated believer will not go away because it's food to his soul amen so we see that when we hear that food when we hear that word it's food to our soul and we can't help but respond to it amen he said he loves it he said and nothing can keep him away from it he'll do anything just like jacob he wants that birthright and if i'm a christian and today in the seventh day i want to be like i want to have the the desire that jacob had to get my birthright amen i don't want to be just another person that just comes and participates in the service and does this and that but i want to excel in christ amen i want the devil to remember my name whenever he's being cast into the lake of fire is that right i want to know that i stood on the word of god and god used me to my full ability amen he said he loves it nothing can keep him away from it he says he wants that birthright he'll stand there i don't care if it costs every friend he's got if it costs his job as church membership if it costs everything he'll hold to it amen because he cannot help it and i believe that's been shown in this day and in this hour you know people will pass away people are leaving the message and doing this or that but i can't leave because it's just something on the inside is calling out to that amen and there's something that responds in his word and i just it just matches up that's what i love and desire amen he said there's something in him moving him the deep calling to the deep he says oh there you are something inside of him and i think that's where we get we get confused as much as people we look too much at the flesh we look too much at others we look at this one and that one but when we should be looking at christ because he's the one on the throne room he's the one in the control tower amen now we see that just like ruth and i'm just going to just to just pull a few people out here but ruth was determined she forsook her home her family everything she forsook it to go meet the to go meet boaz because naomi had told her of something that she had never seen she told her told her about her homeland told her about this and that and and there was something on the inside a route that she couldn't explain but she wanted to go there amen and how many of you you maybe grew up in a different church a nominal church you grew up in the world or you grew up in a message pew and and one day just something that the minister said struck you and it was just something you desired to be a part of amen so you know we look and we look at the manifestation of a seed and and when we look at the fruits and and you know god god calls people according to his calling not according to our agenda amen you know if we look if we look at the rich young ruler and he would have been probably the person that we'd wanted to preach the person we'd want in our church but if you look at the seed the prodigal and the pig pen was who god had chosen amen so you know we may have wanted the rich young ruler here we wanted him to be the one speaking but it was actually the one out in the pig pen that god had called and four ordained so it's not by what we can see but it's by what god can see amen that's why we ought not to judge other people because god could be could have that seed on the inside and we could be calling out against god's elect is that right now we see that um that that christians in this day you know it's the way the enemy looks is everything that is now that everything that was called evil is now called good in today's in today's standards and that's just the way the world is but as message believers as christians we cannot allow that to creep into our own ranks because even if you look years ago i know you know when i was growing up in in the message and you know music that we listen to today that's that's more uh contemporary i guess what you call it there's no way we could have listened to that back in the day and and that's just the way it was and you know we couldn't have done some of the things we do today that we could have done back then you know what's changed you know it wasn't god right it's the people that's changed amen now i'm not saying anything that thing is wrong you know obviously i play the drums i don't believe any of that's wrong if we played in the right spirit i believe i could come up here and play in the wrong spirit and it would be wrong i could just like i could come and preach in the wrong spirit and it'd be wrong and some of you can come to church in the wrong spirit and it'd be wrong so we have to all prepare ourselves we all have a part to play from the musicians to the to the lay members sitting on the pew if you want something from god don't expect the pastor just to be the one in the right mind we've got to get in the right mind amen so we've got to come to church expecting good results if you come to church expecting problems you'll get problems if you come expecting healing you're going to get healing amen so it's what we put into it is what we're going to get out of it amen we can't depend on the preacher the minister the evangelist this one or that one to come and just preach us happy or preach us this or that if the word is being come forth we ought to be happy amen amen do you love the lord this evening i love how brother branham he said this and i don't know where it is but he said the sin that once ruled you you now rule it amen what used to have jurisdiction over you you now have jurisdiction over it you no longer yield yourself to that thing because you have realized you have the power you have the ability and the authority in jesus christ to call out against that thing and be an overcomer amen now brother abraham says here he says it says with moses so will i be with thee he says oh how can you try to make all the lutheran see at the baptist seat and the presbyterians and nazarenes and pilgrim holy she says don't condemn them that's all they know that's all that's in them but you who do believe he says oh god to you who know to you that's got something in you that's calling to the deep he says if all you've got has been satisfied he said then stay where you are he says but for us for me in my house there's something more than what i can see amen i don't know about you but i i love the ministry i love brother ben but there's something more until i take a rapture i want to keep striving amen he said i know there's a land beyond the river somewhere he says there's a deep calling to the deep and i cannot be satisfied with just theology amen you shouldn't come to church and just be satisfied with the minister getting up and preaching and the songs coming forth he said i cannot be satisfied with just a little healing service there's something beyond that that's calling amen so until we actually get the fullness of christ that's when we can be fully satisfied amen but until we get to that point it's not that we can't enjoy and be happy and and experience the the presence of the lord but but don't stop there continue on in christ amen don't stop trying to grow it's harvest time i think that's one of the saddest things you see it a lot in business you see it a lot in churches people will get people will get to a certain state and then they just stop they have so much more potential they could go so much further they could go so much further than where they're currently at but they got satisfied in that state and as a christian i never want to get satisfied i know brother branham says you know i could go out and and live out in the wilderness and never come to church again never do this and he would still go to heaven is that right but in his heart he didn't want to do that why because he wanted that he still had a deep calling on the inside amen just like caleb he wasn't satisfied with just crossing jordan he wanted his mountain amen amen satan likes satisfied people he keeps them in more of a stagnant state he he enjoys satisfied people amen do you love the lord i'm not going to be very long tonight so don't worry get in and pull and when i come in the back i had two computers and a printer and but nothing was working so my brother ben helped me we finally got it all all laid out and you know i'll skip over half of it but where the lord leads that's where we want to go amen you know i'm a big believer you know when i was when i wasn't living right and i was i was coming back to the lord and and you know i'd ask god to speak to me and then he would and i'd be like okay that's that's enough you know i'd come to church and i'd ask him to speak to him and the minister would get up and start calling everything out calling everything out and and so if you come tonight you know and you didn't ask god to speak to you then what are you doing here right did you actually ask god speak to me tonight you know what are you doing here you're just coming to be satisfied to fulfill a position that is mandated because that's what we're supposed to do or did you come here because you had a desire in your heart to find christ and you know as christians you can blame it on the minister say well alan you're just not that good of a minister but i guarantee if you ask god to speak to you he'll somehow take this horrible vessel and speak to you through it amen that's the way god works i believe brother abraham said it's the hardest thing for one individual one mortal to believe another mortal but that's the way god works he didn't call the trees to preach he didn't call the waters to preach he called man to preach amen and that's what is that if that's our calling that's what we've got to do but as christians as believers if you come to church and you have no desire you have you have no ambition let me put it that way you have no ambition to actually get more of god why do you think you would actually get more of god right if i go to a restaurant and i don't put in my order i'm not going to get fed amen if you come to church and you don't put in your order you're not going to get fed amen it's not the minister's fault if you leave here tonight and you're not healed it's not our fault it's not god's fault it's your fault amen if you leave here tonight unsatisfied it's not god's fault it's not my fault it's your fault tonight amen just reading the scripture you ought to be able to take something from that if you're pulling on the word of god god will speak to you through that amen you may have had a tough day at work you may have battles in the family but god is here to let you know it's going to be okay amen first john 3 1 he says behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed on us that we should be called the sons of god amen i tell you i don't know about you but that makes my heart warm that i be called a son of god amen not that i'm called a message believer not that i'm called i go to this church or that church but i'm called a son of god amen amen therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not beloved now are we the sons of god not we're going to be not not maybe we will be but we are right now in present time and it doth not appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is i don't about you but i'm ready for that change amen he said every man had that hath hope in him purify himself even as he is pure whosoever committed sin transgresseth also the law for sin is the transgression of the law and you know that he was manifested to take away our sins and in him is no sin so we see that jesus christ was manifested his purpose was to come and save the world is that right for god so loved the world he sent his only begotten son so we see that christ was manifested to take away our sins and and then in him was no sin and i want to skip on down to verse 8 and it says he that committeth sin is of the devil for the devil sinneth from the beginning for this purpose the son of god was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil amen i'm so glad that he's going to do away everything that satan put against you everything that satan calls you to do he's going to destroy that so in the in the end is that right amen do you love do you love the lord this evening i read a quote i don't remember who it was by but it was some gentleman said you know god has already got god has already factored in your faults and your failures quit worrying about it and move on in christ amen amen do you love the lord this evening amen i believe many times we get too focused in on the little things that we get too focusing on what this one's doing what that one's doing and i believe as winston churchill has said you'll never get where you're going if you stop and throw a rock at every dog that barks amen amen i believe we ought to come to christ we ought to focus in on him i don't need to worry about what's going on with this family that family and and try to get involved in this try to get involved in that just let me come and let me serve the lord amen amen you don't need to be going to the pastor all the time and i don't know if anybody's doing this but go ahead well i know about this i know about this i know about this let god deal with it amen how about you do that one time begin to pray get on your knees amen begin to call upon the name of the lord and let him handle the situation amen and brother ben hasn't told me anything if anybody's been telling him anything he hadn't told me but but that's just that's just the spirit of the lord amen amen if you if you stop and throw a rock at every dog that will bought the barks you'll never get to where you need to go now nothing that you try to do nothing you manufacture you can't manufacture salvation you can't manufacture the gifts you've got to bear the gifts it's something on the inside that just expresses itself and you can't help but show it amen the the he says the sheep doesn't manufacture the wool he has wool because he's a sheep he just bares the wool just as a cherry tree it doesn't manufacture cherry it just bears cherries because that's the life and the way now i could go out and say i'm an nba pro all-star all i want to do but there's no manifestation of that right i couldn't play college boy i could barely play high school there's no manifestation of that is that right but if there's something on the inside as brother burnham says you've got the spirit of i believe it's john dillinger you'd carry pistols on your side is that right if you had the spirit of michael jordan you'd be a you'd be an athlete you'd be a player but if we have the spirit of christ it should reflect christ on the outside amen he said the church of the living god doesn't inject this or try to make themselves look like something they're already what they are by the grace of god and i i just love that so much right there i don't have to you know i don't have to look like this church and i'm to look like this family i want to look like this one i am what i am by the grace of god is that right now that doesn't mean i can continue on in sin that doesn't mean i can continue to do whatever i want to do but once your your soul has been filled with the holy ghost god doesn't begin to change everything about you yes he changes certain aspects but we don't have to live like this one or live like that when god called us to be who we are amen you know i love it you know i was talking to somebody the other day and you know people like to pick people and and if they do it it's okay and they set that as their standard right you know well if i looked at it and said well brother ben lets his kids do that so that's becomes my standard for me letting my kids do that now there's nothing wrong with you know with going you know with obviously going to your pastor and asking if this is okay or that's okay or or looking at what the prophet did and do it and doing the similar things but we can't set those people as our standard we can't set those people and say well this is my standard for how i'm going to raise my kids raise my family or serve the lord we can't do that what's on the inside god it's got to be the standard has to be the word we've got to go back to the word the spirit of god has got to lead each and every individual is that right amen do you love the lord so if christ is on the inside it has to manifest on the outside that's the thing you know you may be able to hide sin you may be able to hide this or that for a certain season it will eventually come out but you can't hide christ amen there's just something about him once he gets on the inside he's going to come out eventually he's going to show on the outside because he's declaring in this day that we're not like the first eve is that right that we there we're going to be a different bride we're not going to fall like the first one but we're going to make it all the way to the end now you know if you ask joshua why i was marching around jericho on the first day he maybe would not have known the second day the third day the fourth day the fifth day the sixth day but on the seventh day until those walls come crashing down until the battle was over he still didn't know why he was marching but the lord said to do it amen and if god says something in his word he says to do it we ought to follow through to the very end is that right now second timothy chapter one and seven uh chapter one and verse seven i told brother ben i was gonna try to slow down i just cannot do it amen see where was it i am what i am by the grace of god so you're going to deal with it so now that doesn't mean you know when i say that you know it's bad as a minister every time you say something you almost have to combat combat seven different thought processes with it you know if i say god has changed you he's called you his grace is sufficient well then you have to go back and talk to the to the make believer and say well you can't just do anything you have to talk to the unbeliever and say you know you know you can't just continue on in sin and then you've got to talk to the believer and say hey you've got to let this go god has covered it you know and that's the way it is you know you can say well i am what i am and that doesn't mean you can still be mean to other people you know if you were mean god's going to take that hell that's not the spirit of god to be mean so so if you're mean and cranky and cantankerous that's not the spirit of god i'm sorry you can't just say well i am the way that i am and you're not going to change it right you know i could say that to my wife she's eventually gonna get tired of it you know well hey you're not gonna change it i'm beginning to realize that maybe we need to change something else is that right so we can't just say i am the way that i am and i'm not gonna change right you're stagnant if you're doing that amen whoever that was for we got to have personal growth occasionally amen i don't remember where i was for god hath not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our lord nor of me as prisoner but be thou a partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of god who hath saved us and called us with a holy calling not according to our works thank the lord he didn't call us according to our works amen because i would have not have been good enough but he caught us according to his own purpose and grace which was given us in christ jesus before the world began he says but is now made manifest by the appearing of our savior jesus christ who with abolished death and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel so we see that we were called in christ jesus before the world began but is now made manifest by the appearing of the savior our jesus christ our savior jesus christ so we see that the the seed was planted before the foundation of the world our names were called before the foundation of the world our names were on the land book of life before the foundational world but now is the manifestation of that now you can look at that and say well i'm not manifesting what i want to what i want to be what i feel like christ is going to be then you need to get to the altery man you need to get into the word and find where you messed up or where you went wrong because god will have an elect bride that will stand in this day that will live a life like no other is that right now we've been called by a holy calling something that we can't explain this isn't a this isn't a worldly calling to where where maybe i would call you and maybe for a job or something and say well this is your specific job but this is a holy calling this is different than if a boss tells you this is your job these are your job duties if you have any questions go to hr but this is a holy calling that christ has caught us and he doesn't say well this is everything you've got to do right he doesn't say this is what you've got to do start to finish this is your purpose in life we've got to find that along the way and you know maybe you're struggling i don't know what my purpose is i don't know what purpose is well i can tell you first right off the bat your first purpose is to serve the lord amen now brother brahma says in influences he says he says it'll put you into action if you haven't got it he says it'll put you into action when you see the word of god fulfilled he said what we've seen in the last days ought to put us in action it should do it if we just do it with reverence and humility the pillar of fire before paul put him into action and today when we see the same pillar of fire by science by its results by what it's promised making the word in these last days come before he says come to pass exactly he said it should put us into action he said that's the sign has been given as it was in the days of sodom he said just before sodom burns so shall be the coming of the son of man he'll be manifested again and i ask you how is he going to be manifested other than you and i is that right he said by the same he said he's the same yesterday today and forever it ought to put every member of the body of christ into action and i ask you tonight where to left tabernacle are you put into action are you are you in action mode are you just satisfied with where you're currently at he says getting everything in you can because it's the last hour it's the last call word by word it's been fulfilled this should certainly put us into action and as sons and daughters of god we ought to be called to action we ought to be ready to fight when god needs us we want to be ready is that right i love this i just threw this in here brother branham says you can scream and yell all you want he says the devil isn't heart of healing but he knows where the faith is that right you can come up here you can scream you can shout you can do everything you want satan doesn't care about any of that he knows where the faith is and i want you to know tonight you don't you don't have to be a good speaker you don't have to be a good singer you don't have to be this or that if you've got faith in the word of god he'll stand on that is that right amen i also love this faith is not an emotion it's a decision it's a decision to stand on god's word faith isn't something that you just manufacture this or that you know jesus when he says he's coming back he didn't ask if he's going to find good churches long-haired women well-dressed women well-dressed men well-behaved men he said will i find faith that's what he wants is faith in the word of god amen amen i'll be bringing to close just in a few minutes just hanging with me just for another second john 14 and 16 he says and i will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever you thankful for that amen that we're sealed unto the day of our redemption that when he left he didn't leave us comfortless but he sent us a comforter even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you and we see the spirit of truth that he sends to us the world cannot receive and if there's ever a time that we see in this day that the world rejects truth and calls it a lie and then accepts lies and calls it the truth it's this day is that right the the mental capacity the mental state of people is just insane it just to to you and i we just look at it we say that's the craziest thing i've ever heard and i've ever seen but it's the way the world is working is that right and it should show us what hour we're living in verse 18 i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you yet a little while in the world seeth me no more but ye see me because i live you shall live also and i love that portion of scripture there you know when christ went away he says you you shall see me and i believe that's the revelation through the word we see christ when when the word is coming forth we can see christ in his word is that right we can see christ in the life of other believers we can see christ when the word comes forth and it speaks to our hearts we know that's christ speaking to you and i he says but the world he said but you see me because i live you shall live also at the day you shall know that i am in my father and you and me and i in you he that hath my commandments and keepeth them he it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and i will love him and will manifest myself to him now brother branham he goes into the scripture he says man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god he says hallelujah he says he says you say i'm excited but no i'm not he says he said brother if i'm excited let me say this way he says well why he says god is in his people manifesting himself in the flesh of mortal beings who's been born again he says do you believe that so i want to read that again god is in his people manifested himself in the flesh of mortal beings who's born again do you believe that so we see that in this day you know you look at you look at who is god's hands we are who's god's feet we are who's god's eyes his his mouth we are we're god is being manifested in our lives in this day he says you believe god is in his universe you see him in the sunlight you see him in a tree and a flower in his word and his son and in his people he said then here's god right here he says amen knowing the thoughts of men and discerning the thoughts and healing the sick and making the blind to see and the death to hear the lame to walk the only thing that's limiting god is our faith he says hallelujah oh my so the only thing that limits god is our faith how high can we climb how high can our faith go amen he said the life of god must be made manifest in our lives and when it is nothing can overcome us because christ cannot be defeated you believe that now as christians we begin to look at the outside too much we begin to look at the things we've done in the past the things that we're you know thinking about you know the things we struggle with and and god doesn't want us to look at that he wants us to look at him is that right amen do you love the lord this evening well we literally become the living word for this hour the word of god can defeat satan at any time in any place under any circumstance and you of i have been called to be that word for this day do you believe that now we ought to as christians you know many times you know you see me come to church and as a minister it's kind of hard to preach these things that we ought to praise more we ought to worship god more because you see me and i know dealing with kids and and just dealing with thoughts and different things it's very hard to do that in this day the devil wants us to be distracted he wants us to our minds to be here our minds to be there our minds to be doing this but we ought to come to the house of god in one accord in one mind to see christ is that right and i believe if we could ever get there you know if you want revival to come focus on christ amen if you when they wanted jesus to come on the scene they begin calling jesus on the scene so if you want jesus in your life begin to praise him begin to worship and begin to call him on the scene and watch him show up when you're in the time of need amen now in the beginning the first book of the bible god told us not to break one word of that every word must be kept they must live by the word jesus said in the middle of the book come along and said that in this age he said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that comes out of the mouth of god and then closing age of revelation e4 told us that whosoever shall take one word another book or add one word to it his part shall be taken from the book of life therefore there can be nothing shadowy just genuine unadulterated word of god that's the sons and daughters of god who's not born by the will of man or by the shaking of hand or by some bad form of baptism but born in the spirit of god by the holy ghost and the word manifesting itself through them that's the genuine seed of god amen so i tell you again if jesus is on the inside he'll manifest on the outside you can't keep him bottled up you can't keep him sealed up if something happens if the word comes forth you've got to respond to it with an amen amen is that right so we see that when god has called us not only did he call us but he when he when his when a spirit took over our body it was something that that was just just so um so crazy to the human mind that we could actually yield ourselves to our father is that right and that we could yield ourselves in such a way that god could come and speak through our lives to other believers amen that we would be a witness in this day to the world and be a witness to other believers and and the nominal christians that god would choose us to do that amen it to me it's just amazing that god would go god would allow us to do that amen now as as we look back this is our time this is our day and i'm going to be bringing it down to a close just in a few minutes and and we see that when god has called us for this day for this hour he didn't equip us for the ephesian age or the pergamus or thy tire he equipped us for laodicea is that right so you can't sit back and say well well i don't have everything i need god's done this and god's done that or the world's done this or the world's done that god has equipped you to overcome everything that the enemy could throw at you in laodicea so we see that in this day there's no excuse for us to sit back and say well well i can do this or i can do that or i i'm not going to believe this or i'm not going to believe that there's no excuse amen because god has come in this day with the prophet messenger and revealed the message of the hour to you and i as believers is that right he's revealed the message the hour so we have everything we need to make a rapture and so it's not going to be god's fault it's not going to be the prophet's fault it's not going to be the ministry's fault if you missed it it's going to be your fault is that right but i'm so glad that as a son and daughter of god we can't miss it amen if that seed gene is on the inside god will call it when that when it's harvest time when it's raptured time that seed will have to go back to where it came from amen that's why that's why everything else will be cast in the lake of fire because it didn't come from god but if you come from god you will go back to god is that right amen for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god is that right and i don't want the devil to come up to me and tell me what i am or what i ain't god told me what i was and by grace i was made that way and now i'm going to overcome by the grace of god because that's who he made me to be amen amen the only thing that is limiting god is our faith if you want to see greater things then raise your faith up to the next level amen you can't come in here with a 1960 mentality and expect god to reveal you in a 2020 mentality amen and what i mean by that is not saying the word has lost its effect but the things that they battled in 1960 is not the things we battle in 2020 but the same god that overcome in the 60s the 50s the 70s will overcome in 2020 is that right it doesn't matter that the enemies come out with new things there's new there's new sin there's the world has gone even further into insanity the same god will still allow you to be overcomers in this day do you believe that amen if romans 8 and 15 for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear we're not supposed to be fearful we're supposed to be of a spirit of a sound mind as that ride of love but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father the spirit beareth itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of god amen back to everybody we'll be happy over there you know the reason you it's terrible you know the reason there's no gospels over there there's no there's no people that cause trouble over there because they weren't there in the beginning is that right if you're causing trouble if you're if you're gossiping if your purpose in life is to cause trouble or see somebody else hurt you need to get saved amen you ain't got the spirit of god if you say you hate your brother and say you love god the scripture says you are a liar is that right we're not even to hate the denominations we're not even to hate the world we hate sin is that right but we've got to love one another do you believe that i believe that's where the world has perverted everything you can't cry out against the sin because they attach the sin to the person is that right but we as christians we as believers know that that's satan working in in a spiritual realm now the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit so what that means is god's spirit and our spirit are doing the same thing so if you look in the bible and you're not doing the same thing you're not of that spirit not a lot of amen's there but it's the truth we are the children of god and if children then heirs heirs of god and joint heirs with christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together and this really the scripture here about adoption i've studied it quite a bit you know we with matthew we adopted him and you know whenever we adopted him his name was changed amen he become one of ours he was put onto our life insurance policies anything that was a beneficiary he was added to it we weren't going to treat him like he wasn't a son or he was a stepchild or this or that and that's the way god does when he brings you in you are just like christ to him amen join heirs with christ we are sons and daughters of god and everything that christ is entitled to you and i are entitled to amen amen he says in children and heirs of god he says join us with christ if so be that we suffer with him we may also be glorified with him he says for i reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared to the glory which shall be revealed in us it doesn't say the glory that will be revealed in christ but the glory that will be revealed in you and i is that right for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of god what are they waiting on not the manifestation of christ but the manifestation of the sons of god i i'm here to tell you we've got to do something amen we can't just stay where we're at and expect the rapture to come to us right we've got to get closer to christ amen the everything is waiting for the manifestations of the sons of god so we've got to get to a point just like enoch that where one day we were just walking so close to him he just took us up amen amen do you love the lord amen i told you i was going to be really quick tonight so if the musicians would come and amen we'll just go ahead and read this i want to read this now he said and this is brother branham speaking in adoption in 1960 he says now we made known to us the mystery he says get the holy spirit on you sometime and and start running that and and just watch how it goes he said this afternoon i had all about 30 minutes to study and just look the lesson over and maybe not i'll say he said maybe half of that 15 minutes between the time and i got into the old testament then back over in the new testament and tied something together and he said see there the mystery of his coming the mystery of his will and the mystery of us setting together he said remember it cannot be taught in any seminary it's a mystery you cannot know it by education by theology it's a mystery that's been hidden since the foundation of the world are waiting for the manifestation of the sons of god so everything that you know we can't look and say well you know and i don't want to have to like i said earlier whenever you preach against grace you have to go and preach to to this one and that one and say well you can't do this you can't do that so i don't want to say that it's just everything's waiting on us we know what has to happen in order for for the rapture to take place but we play a a enormous part in that to where we our desire i preached a long time ago preparing for a rapture and i believe as christians we ought to be preparing for a rapture not preparing for death not preparing for this or preparing for that but preparing for his return is that right now he says tell me my brother my sister when was the time the sons of god was ever to be manifested outside of this time now he said when were there is ever a time in history than the manifestation the manifest the time to deliver all nature he says nature itself is groaning waiting for the time of the manifestation he says why before the atonement was made before the holy ghost was ever poured out before the old testament and on down here he said there couldn't have been a manifestation he said it had to wait until this time he said now all things have been brought coming shaping up to a headstone to the manifestations of the sons of god coming back he said in the spirit god coming into these men he said so perfectly until the ministry will be so close like christ not like brother ben's not like brother donnie's not like brother brandon but like christ till it'll join him and his church together do you believe that today i mean that's what we're looking forward we want to get so close to christ that he just takes us home amen now i believe as sons and daughters of god we ought to put more we ought to put more respect and more time into praying about the service than we do about this or about that or worrying about this or that i'm preaching to myself big time because if you've got three little kids trying to go to church is probably the hardest thing you can ever do if you want anything to go wrong have a have kids before church and then just everything's going to go wrong that can go wrong amen do you believe that tonight but god still so let me back up because i have to play every minefield here that doesn't mean stay home still come push through press through the mark of the high calling amen we as sons and daughters of god we have the right and it's so amazing you know and i hate to say this but you look at all these people going to nominal churches and doing all these things and and and you look at the catholic church doing the penance and doing everything that they do in vain and they put so much work into it and you and i have the fullness of the godhead bodily the fullness of the word everything all the loose ends tied here today and how much work do we put into it amen i believe it convicts me many times if i'm convicted about anything it's about it's about praying to god for to speak to me in the service anymore is that right you may maybe that's not with you but it is with me is is to get into to try to come to church without being distracted by the world amen if there's ever a time i've been distracted it's in this day but god can bring us back in is that right amen do you love the lord let's just say a prayer you can play that softly everybody will be happy over there amen let's just just go to the word just go to word and prayer just for a few moments dear lord we just come before you god we just thank you for allowing us to to come out tonight lord just to enter into your word just for a few moments god i pray that something was said that would bless somebody lord that would just strengthen them along their journey lord i know nothing nothing was said that was new or nothing was said that was just maybe just just eye-opening but god i pray that they will just take foundation in the word of god lord and we just look at our lives we'll examine ourselves and lord when we leave here we'll leave here a better christian lord when we come back sunday we'll come expecting greater things than we did tonight god i pray for the people lord as they leave you keep them safe as they travel lord for those that are sick but for the request that we're turning in god i pray just your holy spirit would go their way and touch each and every one of them in jesus christ's name we pray amen let's just sing this to go and stand together over there we will shout and sing god's praises everybody will be happy over there once again i hope everybody will be happy will be happy over there we will shout and sing god's praises everybody will be happy over there once again with all our hearts oh everybody will be happy we'll be happy over there oh we will shout and sing god's praises everybody will be happy over there amen give the lord a hand clapper praise man do you love the lord i mean i hope something was said to bless your heart i didn't definitely if i offended anybody i'm sorry if i did it personally i'm sorry but if the word did it follow the word take the offense and fix yourself amen amen there's many times you know i get i get preached on all the time and you know what i don't blame god i don't even blame the minister that's preaching or brother ben my heart's desire is to be right and if i'm wrong i want to be right amen and that's the way we should be let's just sing that song keep on the firing line just before we [Music] go [Music] and there are many dangers that we all must face if we die fight it is no disgrace [Music] against [Music] just keep you must fight be brave once again oh you must fight be brave [Music] against [Music] clapping praise amen just thankful the lord just come and spoke to us tonight and uh just thankful also all of the veterans i didn't get to mention that i wrote it down in the beginning but amen we thankful for them for the service they gave and also remember the service coming up sunday just being prayer for that amen just be praying what you have need of amen and watch god come and move the minister and speak and go in that direction amen amen let's just sing that song as we're dismissed i'll fly away amen let's just sing this we're dismissed when this [Music] oh [Music] bye
