[37:35] were sick and brother Stuart and sister
[37:38] Allison have had a uh have had a rough
[37:41] time this holiday season trying to get
[37:43] their family healthy and and I know that
[37:46] um I know you say well it didn't do us
[37:48] any good because we weren't AP part but
[37:50] even being around that practicing doing
[37:53] all it teaches you to work together and
[37:55] and to sacrifice something for the
[37:57] common good and so we appreciate
[37:59] everybody that put something into that
[38:01] and and uh one of these years we'll get

[38:13] him he's still recovering and uh now is
[38:16] a hard time if you don't realize that
[38:18] it's a difficult time for people who've
[38:20] had surgery people who've been sick
[38:22] because to be around other people who
[38:24] might be sick could be a problem so
[38:27] brother Bailey's recovering at home so

[38:30] about it send him a note or call him and

[39:11] God good to us amen I just had a a
[39:13] thought come on my heart let's stand
[39:18] together I think it would be appropriate

[39:23] from Luke Chapter 2 and verse one before
[39:25] we do let's let's bow our heads a word
[39:26] of
[39:30] prayer heavenly father I ask you once
[39:32] again to come and help me this morning
[39:36] Lord I I thank you for this church Lord
[39:38] and their patience and with us Lord and
[39:40] and struggling through things Lord like
[39:42] they struggle through and we thank you
[39:44] for that and I thank you for Lord the
[39:47] gift of your son that you wrapped
[39:50] yourself in a body of Flesh came down
[39:53] Among Us I'm so grateful for that today
[39:56] I pray God that you just move in this
[39:58] service Lord though it may be a little
[40:01] bit different Service as Christmas Eve
[40:02] and people are thinking about other
[40:04] things but I pray God that you just come
[40:07] down and focus our attention on your
[40:09] word may we receive Revelation today May
[40:13] there be strength Lord that would come
[40:14] from the word of God to make it Lord
[40:17] through this season and every season of
[40:19] Our Lives I pray that you'd bless it
[40:21] today I pray that you'd move Lord
[40:23] through the congregation and and and and
[40:25] through me Lord and speak your word and
[40:28] Lord may you open up our hearing to hear
[40:30] heal those that are sick touch those
[40:32] that are afflicted we pray in Jesus name
[40:35] amen amen Luke Chapter 2 and verse
[40:40] 1 says it came to pass in those days
[40:42] that there went out a decree from Caesar
[40:44] Augustus that all the world should be
[40:47] taxed this taxing was first made when
[40:49] Sirus was governor of
[40:52] Syria all went to be taxed everyone into
[40:55] his own City and Joseph also went up
[40:58] From Galilee out of the city of Nazareth
[40:59] into Judea to the city of David which is
[41:02] called Bethlehem because he was of the
[41:05] house and lineage of David to be taxed
[41:07] with Mary his espoused wife being great
[41:09] with child and so it was that while they
[41:12] were there the days were accomplished
[41:14] that she should be delivered she brought
[41:17] forth her firstborn son wrapped him in
[41:19] swaddling clothes and laid him in a
[41:21] Manger because there was no room for
[41:24] them in the end pray the Lord would add
[41:25] his BL listening to the word you may be
[41:31] seated if you had been near the stable
[41:34] that morning or that night that Christ
[41:38] was
[41:39] born you would have been in darkness
[41:44] figuratively
[41:46] literally and the Darkness would have
[41:48] been broken the silence would have been
[41:51] broken by the sound of a baby
[41:54] cry and there were many babies perhaps
[41:57] born at that time in that season but
[42:01] this was
[42:02] special in fact that cry changed
[42:06] everything because the word had come to
[42:09] its fulfillment and the things that God
[42:12] had told us would happen begin to happen
[42:16] and all that all of of the Old Testament
[42:19] was had been condensed and wrapped up
[42:22] and brought down and all the Fulfillment
[42:25] of Prophecy
[42:26] would be in this body that God had made
[42:29] on the Earth but he didn't come as an
[42:31] adult he come as a baby the word was
[42:35] born you could say it like this that
[42:38] Jehovah cried incarnate for the first
[42:42] time he had he had he had been in MDC
[42:45] he'd been but he'd never been a baby he
[42:48] for the first time his voice was heard
[42:51] on the earth for 400 years they' not had
[42:54] a prophet they hadn't even had
[42:56] inspiration there was no open Vision
[42:59] there was no ability to see and so God
[43:01] had to speak to Joseph even in a dream
[43:04] because there was no Prophet there but
[43:06] now God was going to speak himself and
[43:09] there would be uh there would be an
[43:11] embodiment of Jehovah of deity that God
[43:14] would wrap himself deity in flesh holy
[43:18] God and holy man and and would actually
[43:21] be in flesh and would become one of us
[43:25] and would know what we know and we go
[43:27] through what we go through I'm so
[43:29] grateful he did that aren't you glad
[43:31] that he did that and if you can imagine
[43:34] that cry just that was God
[43:38] speaking and yet you couldn't understand
[43:41] what he was saying he cried like any
[43:44] other baby it sounded like just another
[43:46] baby but it wasn't just another baby it
[43:49] was God and you might go through times
[43:52] in your life you might go through
[43:53] seasons of Darkness you might be in a
[43:55] season of Darkness Ness right now
[43:57] it excuse me your life might be a
[44:00] struggle but yet you know that the
[44:02] silence the the the the darkness can be
[44:04] broken by The Cry of Jehovah in your
[44:07] life and it may not be even it may be
[44:09] unintelligible it may not be something
[44:11] you can understand at the present moment
[44:13] but it's going to grow it's going to
[44:15] become something that begins to speak
[44:17] one day and begins to speak words that
[44:19] can be
[44:22] understood you see Jehovah cried because
[44:25] he spoken they'd ask for a sign and
[44:29] Isaiah the prophet some 400 years before
[44:32] or many many hundreds of years before in
[44:34] Isaiah 7: 11 he said ask the a sign of
[44:38] the Lord thy God ask it either in the
[44:40] depth or in the height above but ahaz
[44:43] said ahaz was the king of Judah at that
[44:45] time he said I will not ask neither will
[44:47] I tempt the Lord and he said hear you
[44:49] now House of David is it a small thing
[44:52] for you to weary men but will you weary
[44:54] My God also therefore the Lord himself
[44:58] shall give you a sign Behold a virgin
[45:01] shall conceive and bear a son and shall
[45:05] call his name
[45:07] Emmanuel Emmanuel means god with us
[45:12] there there's a translation of that that
[45:13] I love it's the strong God With Us God
[45:18] With Us in his strength Jehovah god
[45:22] brother BR said become man took on our
[45:25] stock
[45:26] he took on our stock crossed himself
[45:29] from God and become man and I never knew
[45:32] what that meant exactly brother BR uses
[45:34] the uh uses the phrase he says God
[45:37] pitched his tent with man and then he
[45:39] says God changed his strain I never knew
[45:42] what that meant until
[45:45] Co and Co being a virus is a living
[45:48] thing right and it changed its strain
[45:52] from one you remember they had Delta and
[45:54] Omron and all these names that they gave
[45:56] it it changed its strain right and and
[45:58] so it was still what it was and yet it
[46:01] becomes something else and so God
[46:04] remaining Jehovah remaining God but he
[46:07] changes his strain literally it's it's
[46:10] it's the language you use of DNA he
[46:12] changes his strength to become a man God
[46:16] crossed himself from God and become man
[46:18] changed his strength he was God and
[46:20] become man not a rich man but a poor man
[46:24] oh I'm so glad that he did not a rich
[46:26] man but a poor man he said this is the
[46:28] super sign you've asked for a sign said
[46:31] God I'll give you one an everlasting
[46:34] sign right he could have come otherwise
[46:36] as I've said but a baby why did he
[46:37] become a baby he said when that first
[46:39] little toothless mouth opened in that
[46:41] manger on that first Christmas morning
[46:44] in his little manger crib the first
[46:46] little yell that went from his voice
[46:49] that was God
[46:52] cry gy to God it was Jehovah
[46:56] speaking yet he could not be understood
[46:59] and he would not be recognized in that
[47:00] form and the world would not see him but
[47:03] some Shepherds knew because it was
[47:04] revealed to them this is God and the
[47:07] wise men knew that come when he was 2
[47:09] years old and gave him appropriate gifts
[47:11] at that time why did they know they
[47:13] there was nothing a 2-year-old baby did
[47:15] that would make him look any different
[47:16] from any other 2-year-old but yet they
[47:19] recognized by Revelation that was
[47:22] God and I'll say this when Christ is
[47:24] born in you there's got to be a
[47:26] revelation of the new birth in your life
[47:28] because you're not going to be a full
[47:30] grown Christian all at once and you've
[47:32] got to recognize that you're a child of
[47:34] God you've got to recognize you've been
[47:36] born again that your sins have been
[47:38] forgiven come on
[47:39] now you've got to have a revelation of
[47:43] who you are just as he had a revelation
[47:46] they had a revelation of who he
[47:48] was you become God become a man it was
[47:51] God crying Jehovah crying a man come
[47:54] from God and was man every wit man come
[47:58] to the world with nothing but still man
[48:01] what was he trying to do what was he
[48:03] purposing he said he cried like a baby
[48:05] in the manger he played like a boy on
[48:08] the street he toiled like a man but yet
[48:11] he was Emmanuel this is the super sign
[48:14] God dwelling in the creation that he
[48:18] created I want you to think deeply with
[48:20] me this morning as deeply as you can to
[48:24] understand this this morning there's
[48:25] something going on when Jehovah decides
[48:28] to cry when Jehovah when Jehovah decides
[48:32] Now's the Time to be born into the world
[48:37] and we know that God's voice brings
[48:39] order out of chaos and darkness and
[48:43] silence is a symbol of
[48:45] chaos and and you'll find that things
[48:48] are out of order in the beginning there
[48:50] was no voice on the earth there was no
[48:53] there was nothing to put it in order the
[48:55] Bible says in the beginning God created
[48:57] the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth
[48:58] was without form and void verse two the
[49:01] Earth was without form and void and
[49:03] darkness was upon the face of the deep
[49:05] and the spirit of God moved upon the
[49:07] face of the waters yet God as of this
[49:10] time had not yet spoke but now in verse
[49:12] three God said let there be
[49:15] light God said something and there was
[49:18] light God's voice brought oh my God's
[49:22] voice brought order out of
[49:26] chaos and when Christ is born in
[49:29] Bethlehem his The Cry of God at that
[49:33] time brought begin to bring order begin
[49:36] to bring fulfillment to the seeds that
[49:39] had already been planted the word that
[49:41] had already been given the voice of God
[49:43] began to bring fulfillment to that and I
[49:45] hope you're following me this morning
[49:47] now he spoke and the silence was broken
[49:50] by the manifested word now it was not
[49:53] enough for the spirit of God just to
[49:55] over Shadow Mary that had to happen the
[49:57] spirit of God had to do that she she had
[50:00] to be overshadowed and there had to be a
[50:02] conception of the Holy Ghost it was
[50:04] without
[50:05] sensation the conception was without
[50:08] sensation because it could not be by the
[50:10] hands of a man but there also had to be
[50:13] a birth right and at the birth there was
[50:16] a cry right right because God had to
[50:19] announce that he was alive right amen
[50:24] amen you you're remember when your kids
[50:26] were born those of you have
[50:28] children remember when your kids were
[50:29] born maybe you Tred to forget
[50:33] it I remember when my kids were born all
[50:37] three of them the first one was
[50:38] traumatic the other two they just uh did
[50:41] the C-section of surgery they just
[50:42] brought them to me you know that's
[50:44] pretty
[50:45] good but uh but I remember when Peter
[50:49] was born and and I remember what they
[50:51] did to him I you know and I got a little
[50:54] mad at him
[50:56] cuz I didn't realize that he wasn't
[51:00] breathing and they needed him to make
[51:02] some
[51:04] noise so they they take they rough him
[51:07] up and they throw him on the on the
[51:10] little shelf there and and and put the
[51:12] oxygen mask on and they're kind of
[51:14] they're just rough with him you know
[51:15] drying him rough with him and I was like
[51:17] what why why you got to be so rough well
[51:20] they're trying to make him cry yes
[51:22] because when they make the crying clears
[51:24] the lungs yes of all that fluid and
[51:27] things and so they they have to be able
[51:29] to cry and and when you hear him cry at
[51:32] one point during Peter's birth we lost
[51:33] his heartbeat and so we we were we were
[51:36] scared for his life and we didn't know
[51:38] whether he was going to come out alive
[51:39] or dead and so when he was finally born
[51:42] they we we we he didn't say nothing for
[51:44] a little while it was a while before
[51:46] they they worked on him for a while and
[51:47] finally you hear sounds more like a
[51:50] sheep don't
[51:54] it little it does sound like a goat and
[52:00] sheep it's been so long since my kids
[52:02] were little I can't even cry like a kid
[52:04] but it cried and you all heard that in
[52:06] the play the other night when during the
[52:08] play at some point it was a baby
[52:11] cry what was it it told you something it
[52:14] was there the sound effect was there for
[52:16] a reason it was there to tell you there
[52:18] there was a baby
[52:19] born oh my there had to be a cry and the
[52:24] birth had taken place and the silence
[52:26] was broken by the manifestation of the
[52:28] word now we know that he was the word
[52:30] John 1:1 in the beginning was the word
[52:32] and the Word was with God and the Word
[52:34] was God the same was in the beginning
[52:37] with God all things were made by him and
[52:40] without him was not anything made that
[52:43] was made he was the word at the
[52:45] beginning in John 1:14 he says and the
[52:48] Word was made flesh and dwelt among us
[52:51] and we beheld his glory the glory as of
[52:54] the only begotten of the father full of
[52:56] grace and truth the word was made flesh
[52:59] Born Into the Darkness of the of the
[53:02] season to break the chaos of Silence to
[53:05] bring order out of nothing are you with
[53:07] me so far so there had to be a birth of
[53:10] the word during the first creation there
[53:12] was a birth of the word at the beginning
[53:14] of time there had to be a birth at
[53:16] Christmas time there had to be a birth
[53:18] on
[53:19] Pentecost right because he had to die he
[53:22] could not he in John 12:20 he could not
[53:25] remain in the form that he was in John
[53:27] 12:20 it tells us that there were
[53:29] certain Greeks among them that come up
[53:31] to worship at the feast and the same
[53:33] came therefore to philli which was a
[53:35] Bethesda of Galilee and desired him
[53:37] saying sir we would see Jesus and Philip
[53:41] cometh and tth Andrew and again Andrew
[53:43] and philli tell Jesus and Jesus answered
[53:46] them saying the hour is come that the
[53:49] son of man should be glorified now
[53:51] remember these are Greeks and he was
[53:53] sent to the lost sheep of the House of
[53:54] Israel but he's telling them that I need
[53:57] to go into another form I need to pass
[54:00] from this form into another form so that
[54:03] you can recognize and you can see who I
[54:06] am so he needed to die and be reborn in
[54:09] them so that they would recognize who he
[54:12] was and so God could speak again because
[54:14] God he didn't stop speaking when Jesus
[54:16] left the Earth Jehovah since that time
[54:19] he's always been here he's always lived
[54:22] in somebody oh brother BR said that's
[54:25] the story of Christmas and go listen to
[54:27] God's gifts always find their places he
[54:29] said the story of Christmas is Christ in
[54:33] you right and there's a very deep
[54:35] Revelation there as we begin to
[54:37] recognize that Christmas is not just a
[54:39] baby and a Manger but because he came
[54:42] because the silence was broken because
[54:43] he grew up because he he because he
[54:45] became the word because he fulfilled the
[54:47] word because he died on the cross
[54:49] because he he he was buried and rose
[54:51] again on the third day because he did
[54:53] all of that he could come back back in
[54:55] the Believers on
[54:57] Pentecost so now he tells them these
[55:00] Greek Believers he says the hour is come
[55:03] the son of man shall be glorified verily
[55:04] verily I say un you except a corn of
[55:06] wheat fall into the ground and die it
[55:09] abideth alone but if it die it bringeth
[55:12] forth much fruit sir so brother brandom
[55:16] says this he said just as soon as these
[55:18] Greeks was pointed to Jesus Jesus did
[55:20] not point to himself or or he did not
[55:23] make himself known to them him because
[55:26] you cannot know Jesus in that
[55:29] way Jesus isn't known in that way it was
[55:34] a cute little story brother Allan was
[55:35] talking about his kids and but Jesus is
[55:38] not known in that way and kids I hope
[55:39] you hear me today all older folks I hope
[55:41] you hear me today Jesus is not known in
[55:44] a Manger today Jesus is not known even
[55:47] as as a a human being if we could say it
[55:50] that way today he doesn't there will
[55:52] come a day when uh we believe we'll see
[55:54] him in In the Flesh how many believe
[55:56] that that's brother said that's what
[55:58] Believers believe amen that that we'll
[56:00] see him in the Corporal Body of Christ
[56:03] and yet today during the Gentile age
[56:05] he's not known that way and he's
[56:07] explaining to these Greeks this is not
[56:09] how I'm known he said you cannot know
[56:11] Jesus in that way Jesus isn't known in
[56:13] that way he and and I want you to notice
[56:16] and brother Ram goes into this in some
[56:17] depth in a sermon called Serge we would
[56:19] see
[56:20] Jesus he said he did not try to explain
[56:23] who he was yeah he didn't stand there
[56:26] and say now I was born in Bethlehem I'm
[56:29] the baby that was in the manger you can
[56:31] go talk to the rabbi or talk to the uh
[56:33] to the Shepherds rather talk to the Magi
[56:36] talk to all the people that uh that that
[56:38] that recognized my birth he did not ever
[56:41] point to his birth but what did he do to
[56:44] the Gentiles he pointed to his
[56:47] death and he said he said except a corn
[56:51] of wheat fall in the ground and dies it
[56:53] abides alone and now but brother B said
[56:56] they were brought into his presence he
[56:58] said that's the main thing get the
[57:00] people in his presence oh that's what we
[57:03] need today sometimes we try to explain
[57:05] it so much but what we need to do is get
[57:07] the people in his presence let me tell
[57:08] you this this morning you might have had
[57:10] a hard life you might have a lot against
[57:11] you but if you could ever get in his
[57:13] presence things would begin to change
[57:16] he'd begin to reveal himself to you amen
[57:19] yes
[57:22] sir so he said what he said the main
[57:26] thing is get the people in his presence
[57:27] he said what an unusual thing instead of
[57:30] accepting their introduction the thing
[57:33] that he done was pointed them to a place
[57:35] that they could find him except a corn
[57:38] of wheat falls into the ground and dies
[57:40] it abides alone he said what did he do
[57:42] here he pointed them to that great truth
[57:45] of how to see him they could not oh my
[57:48] see him in the way of eternal life just
[57:50] standing there the way he was because he
[57:53] was a man now
[57:55] the word had to be born again after his
[57:59] death burial and Resurrection again
[58:04] silence Jesus had been taken off the
[58:06] Earth
[58:07] chaos they didn't know what was going to
[58:10] happen but they were obeying a a command
[58:12] of God and the promise was about to be
[58:15] fulfilled right and it was broken by the
[58:20] voice of a
[58:22] baby an infant Church
[58:25] church now think about it for a moment
[58:28] it was broken by the voice of God in his
[58:31] people all right another Christmas time
[58:35] at
[58:37] Pentecost and so now in Acts chapter 2
[58:39] and verse one we find when the day of
[58:41] Pentecost was fully come they were all
[58:43] with one Accord in one
[58:45] place and suddenly there came a sound
[58:47] from Heaven as of a rushing Mighty Wind
[58:50] and it filled all the house where they
[58:52] were sitting and there appeared unto
[58:54] them clo and tongues like as of fire and
[58:56] it sat upon each of them and they were
[58:57] all filled with the Holy Ghost and began
[59:00] to speak all right
[59:04] noises proof of
[59:08] life now brother B tells us I don't time
[59:10] to get into it this morning brother bam
[59:12] tells us he said if your religion
[59:13] doesn't have any noise to it he said you
[59:15] need to go bury it amen said because
[59:18] it's
[59:19] dead right what was the noise yes
[59:22] sir oh I wish I could preach this
[59:24] morning what was the noise the proof of
[59:27] life
[59:29] right amen just like in the manger the
[59:32] noise was a proof that God deity had
[59:35] been born in human vessels again deity
[59:39] had been born but it wasn't just any
[59:41] noise come on Amen now watch it wasn't
[59:43] just noise for the sake of noise but it
[59:45] was noise fulfilling the word of God
[59:48] there you go with other tongues I with
[59:50] with other tongues and he said with uh
[59:52] all these things I'll speak to my people
[59:54] I'll pour my spirit on All Flesh and and
[59:56] people begin to wonder what's going on
[59:57] and Peter stands up and begins to preach
[59:59] and he says this day these people are
[1:00:01] not drunk as you suppose but this is
[1:00:03] that this noise amen is the result of
[1:00:07] people being
[1:00:08] born yes Christ being born in the hearts
[1:00:12] of the people oh I trust that would be
[1:00:14] the case with us today we would never be
[1:00:16] a dead cold place it would never be a
[1:00:18] silent place but that way the noise
[1:00:21] could be a not just noise for the sake
[1:00:23] of the music not just no noise for the
[1:00:25] sake of well so and so is doing it I
[1:00:26] might as well do it too but noise
[1:00:28] because there's a living God because
[1:00:30] he's being manifested in the hearts of
[1:00:32] the people
[1:00:34] right and Peter began to stand and say
[1:00:36] this is
[1:00:38] that and when they heard this acts 237
[1:00:41] they were pricked in their heart and
[1:00:43] said to Peter and to the rest of the
[1:00:44] Apostles men and Brethren what shall we
[1:00:46] do and I'll say this this is still what
[1:00:48] you have to do right do you want to be
[1:00:50] saved here's how to do
[1:00:53] it you want to be filled with the Holy
[1:00:55] Spirit here's how to do it you want to
[1:00:56] change your life this is it yes this is
[1:00:59] still the prescription amen and you got
[1:01:02] to take it just like the way he G gave
[1:01:04] it in order to receive the benefit of it
[1:01:07] he said Peter said then repent and be
[1:01:09] baptized every one of you in the name of
[1:01:11] Jesus Christ for the remission of sins
[1:01:13] and you shall receive the gift of the
[1:01:16] Holy
[1:01:18] Ghost what was it
[1:01:20] order and come out of chaos New Creation
[1:01:24] just like at the beginning at the very
[1:01:26] beginning of time when God's voice spoke
[1:01:29] the Sun come to its place the moon come
[1:01:31] to its place the seeds begin to grow
[1:01:33] everything begin to take its place and
[1:01:36] the church oh my was just 120 desperate
[1:01:39] individuals there just 120 people who
[1:01:41] couldn't get along about anything but
[1:01:43] when they come in one Accord in one
[1:01:44] place all of the sudden here come the
[1:01:46] Holy Ghost and when the Holy Ghost come
[1:01:48] it set the church in
[1:01:50] order oh my and the church begin to do
[1:01:53] what a church does amen oh that's what
[1:01:56] we need today first of all we need the
[1:01:57] Holy Ghost to come we need the voice of
[1:01:59] Jehovah to cry out and put the church in
[1:02:02] order I believe we've had it in our
[1:02:05] day now look the baby
[1:02:07] cried the word had been born in the
[1:02:10] hearts of 120 men and women now this
[1:02:12] newborn early church had to grow up had
[1:02:16] to mature in an Ephesian
[1:02:18] church had to be born had to be born but
[1:02:21] also had to
[1:02:22] die right
[1:02:24] right because if they hadn't they just
[1:02:27] went in the rapture we wouldn't be here
[1:02:29] that's right right but the time wasn't
[1:02:31] yet for the Rapture of the church so
[1:02:34] what happened there had to be a falling
[1:02:36] into the ground sir right except the
[1:02:38] corn of wheat fall into the ground it
[1:02:40] abides the loone so it had to fall into
[1:02:42] the ground and people didn't understand
[1:02:44] that but it had to happen Luther had to
[1:02:47] come along at the end of a of a period
[1:02:50] of Darkness Luther come along all of a
[1:02:53] sudden the cry the voice of God could be
[1:02:55] heard again and brother Bram goes into
[1:02:57] that in depth in the church age book he
[1:02:59] said the Lutheran spoke for God until
[1:03:01] they denominated and they no longer
[1:03:02] spoke for God but there was a voice of
[1:03:05] God in that age sir the Lutheran spoke
[1:03:08] for God the Methodist under Wesley spoke
[1:03:10] for God for a brief time but then they
[1:03:13] denominated Pentecost spoke for God for
[1:03:16] a time but it
[1:03:17] denominated and the oh my in this age
[1:03:21] the voice of Jehovah has been heard
[1:03:23] again
[1:03:25] amen now now listen we'll go through it
[1:03:28] so we understand and I I told you we
[1:03:29] going have to think a little bit deep
[1:03:31] maybe you say well this is strange for
[1:03:32] Christmas Eve but but I think it's
[1:03:35] appropriate to the hour that we're
[1:03:36] living in because Christmas means
[1:03:38] something special to us as
[1:03:40] Believers it's not just Santa Claus and
[1:03:43] all these other things but there's
[1:03:44] something about it to Believers it means
[1:03:46] something he was born it wasn't on
[1:03:49] December 25th but he was
[1:03:51] born right so we celebrate that then
[1:03:54] become the light and the Darkness to a
[1:03:55] lost world doesn't understand why he was
[1:03:59] born historically after about three
[1:04:02] years of Revival a denomination forms
[1:04:05] around a move of God how many know that
[1:04:07] brother Bram taught us that and you can
[1:04:09] look in history and find it so there's
[1:04:11] three years of Revival and then
[1:04:13] denomination forms and denomination is
[1:04:16] how a church
[1:04:18] dies brother brandom speaks about it
[1:04:20] this way he said dear dying lamb may it
[1:04:23] never do that sir he said if I go in
[1:04:26] this generation May the people who
[1:04:28] believe this message never stand still
[1:04:31] for a denomination yes sir he said
[1:04:33] you'll die right in your
[1:04:35] track that's why that that as a local
[1:04:38] church we're a sovereign local church
[1:04:40] and I'll say this some people may watch
[1:04:42] and see some of the things we do say
[1:04:43] well you can't do that but what we have
[1:04:45] to answer to is the message of the hour
[1:04:47] we don't have a headquarters beyond that
[1:04:49] there's not a brother in some other
[1:04:50] state that I call to try to find out
[1:04:52] what I can do and what I can't do do as
[1:04:54] a pastor I've got the Bible for that and
[1:04:57] I've got the message for that right and
[1:04:59] I've got Brothers I lean on as far as
[1:05:01] wisdom and experience but it's got to
[1:05:03] come back to the word it's got to come
[1:05:05] back to the word everything we do and
[1:05:07] you should hold me accountable to the
[1:05:09] word of
[1:05:11] God I'm not accountable to what
[1:05:13] everybody else does but I am accountable
[1:05:15] to the word and so you should hold me
[1:05:18] accountable to that I'll say this if you
[1:05:20] hold me accountable to that we should
[1:05:21] hold ourselves accountable to the same
[1:05:23] word
[1:05:27] so after three years of Revival
[1:05:29] denomination that forms and he said if
[1:05:32] you do that you'll die right in your
[1:05:33] track he said remember that the very
[1:05:34] hour that you mentioned denomination
[1:05:36] among you he said I don't care how
[1:05:38] sincere you are take Man For Your Leader
[1:05:40] instead of the Holy Spirit to confirm
[1:05:42] this word he said that's the hour you
[1:05:44] die right and I love this next quote he
[1:05:47] said but the genuine seed cannot yeah it
[1:05:52] cannot cannot form denomination I
[1:05:55] believe we're genuine seed this morning
[1:05:57] because there's nothing left he said
[1:05:59] after the seed so there's no prophecy
[1:06:02] that this one has to die when this voice
[1:06:05] of Jehovah is born into this age it does
[1:06:08] not die again right right oh my but it
[1:06:12] comes to maturity and takes a
[1:06:14] Rapture right now he said the genuine
[1:06:18] seed cannot well that gives me great
[1:06:20] hope yes sir it cannot die yes sir it
[1:06:24] cannot go into denomination there may be
[1:06:25] all kinds of clicks and clans form but
[1:06:27] the genuine seed
[1:06:30] cannot he said there's nothing left
[1:06:32] after the seed it's the same thing it
[1:06:33] was back at the beginning it's the bride
[1:06:35] that fell into the ground to bring forth
[1:06:37] the corn of wheat
[1:06:39] again amen there was chaos of joining
[1:06:43] church and reciting Creeds and some of
[1:06:45] you were involved in that chaos you know
[1:06:47] what it's like I think the problem with
[1:06:48] some of us as some younger people's
[1:06:51] they've never been exposed to
[1:06:53] denominationalism and what it was really
[1:06:55] like they they just don't know and so
[1:06:56] they become very critical of the message
[1:06:58] because you say well I denomination seem
[1:07:01] like everybody gets along oh
[1:07:04] baloney you've never been to a Baptist
[1:07:06] board meeting I guarantee you
[1:07:09] that I'm not speaking bad of the Baptist
[1:07:11] but we you know we're human beings too
[1:07:14] you think we're the only ones that have
[1:07:15] problems come
[1:07:17] on everybody does and they don't got
[1:07:21] nothing to call them back there's no
[1:07:23] there there's no nothing but a dead
[1:07:24] letter to go back to there nothing but a
[1:07:26] Creed but we've got a living word amen
[1:07:30] yes
[1:07:32] sir been in some of those Holiness come
[1:07:35] up around the Church of God Holiness
[1:07:37] I've been in some of their board
[1:07:38] meetings I've s through some of that
[1:07:40] talk about
[1:07:41] carnality they thank God for the holy
[1:07:44] ghost at least when I deal with you I
[1:07:46] mostly deal with Holy Ghost filled
[1:07:47] people and I thank God for that every
[1:07:51] day but there was didn't even believe in
[1:07:53] the the Holy
[1:07:55] Ghost there was a
[1:07:57] chaos
[1:07:58] Darkness we need to remember we don't
[1:08:00] want to go back to that we don't want to
[1:08:03] go back to denominational Pentecost we
[1:08:05] we don't want to go back to the chaos
[1:08:07] but the word spoke and brought CA order
[1:08:10] out of
[1:08:11] chaos I look another silent night broken
[1:08:15] by The Cry of an
[1:08:18] infant but it would not be an infant
[1:08:22] groom right you realize at some point
[1:08:25] your your spouse had to be a
[1:08:27] baby so there had to be an infant bride
[1:08:30] and an infant
[1:08:31] groom oh my there had to be an infant
[1:08:34] groom that come and and when he cried
[1:08:36] they're in the manger it was the
[1:08:38] announcement he was on the earth that if
[1:08:40] there was an infant groom there had to
[1:08:42] be an infant
[1:08:44] bride that would also cry yes
[1:08:47] sir and we know when the baby Christ was
[1:08:50] born there was a an astronomical event
[1:08:53] that took took place at that time that
[1:08:56] there were there were stars that come
[1:08:59] together and
[1:09:00] formed but formed a star that the wise
[1:09:04] men could see and they could see that it
[1:09:05] would was going to happen you know they
[1:09:07] can predict that when it could happen
[1:09:09] they've been doing that for thousands of
[1:09:10] years and they predicted by the stars
[1:09:13] that something great was going to take
[1:09:15] place and they even connected that to
[1:09:17] the prophecy because Daniel had been
[1:09:20] down there in Babylon and had left those
[1:09:21] prophecies there of a Messiah that would
[1:09:24] come and so because they had access to
[1:09:26] the Scrolls and things in Babylon the
[1:09:28] Magi could connect the prophecy with the
[1:09:31] Stars and they could see that something
[1:09:33] was about to happen and then they were
[1:09:35] also supernaturally LED but they come
[1:09:38] during that time and so those Stars went
[1:09:41] together brother BR said three stars
[1:09:42] went together made one morning star
[1:09:44] reflected the coming of infant Christ a
[1:09:46] perfect one but there was something that
[1:09:49] happened in February of
[1:09:51] 1962 you probably heard brother brand
[1:09:53] preach about it on tape but it was an
[1:09:55] actual event that took place and it was
[1:09:58] an earth shattering event was a
[1:10:00] planetary
[1:10:01] alignment and it I'm not going to ask
[1:10:04] who watched it but do you remember the
[1:10:06] movie
[1:10:08] 2012 oh it got real
[1:10:11] quiet it was a Hollywood movie called
[1:10:14] 2012 remember 2012 people were saying no
[1:10:19] November I think it was of 2012 the
[1:10:20] world was going to
[1:10:22] end we forget things so quickly me
[1:10:26] remembers uh you remember
[1:10:29] Y2K my kids would never understand that
[1:10:32] we thought computers couldn't handle
[1:10:34] another
[1:10:36] digit right we were all going to die
[1:10:40] planes were going to fall the sky and
[1:10:41] everything like that I kept I remember
[1:10:42] in a watch Night Service keeping a
[1:10:44] flashlight by my chair y 2K cuz I you
[1:10:47] know you kind of bought into that and
[1:10:50] you remember what that was like well
[1:10:51] 2012 was an event like that because the
[1:10:53] Mayan
[1:10:54] had looked at the stars and said well
[1:10:56] there's going to be a coming together of
[1:10:57] stars and so everything's going to fall
[1:10:59] apart I read an article this week from
[1:11:02] Earth magag dog and it talked about the
[1:11:05] same thing happened in
[1:11:07] 1962 in February there was a planetary
[1:11:10] alignment that raised doomsday fears it
[1:11:12] says similar doomsday fears and that
[1:11:15] alignment also included the five planets
[1:11:17] visible to the naked eye Mercury Venus
[1:11:20] Mars Jupiter and Saturn as well as the
[1:11:22] Moon and the Sun on top of that it was a
[1:11:25] total solar eclipse astronomer Robert
[1:11:28] Richardson of the Griffith Observatory
[1:11:29] in Los Angeles California described the
[1:11:32] scene outside the building on February
[1:11:33] 4th the day that the alignment took
[1:11:36] place by 2:00 the road leading to and
[1:11:38] from the observatory was a solid mass of
[1:11:40] cars lined up bumper to bumper for half
[1:11:43] a mile he said one woman was weeping so
[1:11:45] badly it was hard to understand her she
[1:11:48] was practically on the verge of collapse
[1:11:51] she said I know it's silly to carry on
[1:11:52] this way she gased between SS but I
[1:11:55] can't help
[1:11:56] myself others around the world had even
[1:11:59] more extreme reaction stalking up bomb
[1:12:00] shelters in the United States holding
[1:12:02] non-stop prayer vigils attended by
[1:12:05] millions in Bombay India one group of
[1:12:07] Believers moved in Mass to the town of
[1:12:10] cleor I don't know if I'm pronouncing
[1:12:11] that right Arizona which the group
[1:12:13] thought was one of only 12 spots in the
[1:12:15] world safe from the imminent
[1:12:17] disaster others claimed that the
[1:12:19] alignment was responsible for the
[1:12:21] assassination the following year US
[1:12:23] President John F
[1:12:25] Kennedy so they recognized something was
[1:12:27] going
[1:12:28] on and people were scared by it they
[1:12:31] didn't know what it was when Jesus was
[1:12:33] born the Magi recognized something was
[1:12:35] going on on watching the stars but they
[1:12:38] were Guided by the word and and and by
[1:12:40] the Holy Spirit to where he was brother
[1:12:42] BR said he guided them supernaturally
[1:12:44] for two years to the place where he
[1:12:47] lay but now we we look at this that
[1:12:51] happened in 1962 you say well that's
[1:12:53] happened several times over the years
[1:12:55] happens every few hundred years or
[1:12:56] something like that you say well that's
[1:12:58] happened several times but there was a
[1:12:59] Vindicated Prophet on the earth at the
[1:13:02] time it happened yes you see a dream may
[1:13:05] be just a dream unless there's a
[1:13:06] Vindicated Prophet to interpret it right
[1:13:09] right uh Stars lining up maybe just
[1:13:11] Stars lining up unless there's a
[1:13:14] Vindicated Prophet on the earth we we
[1:13:15] don't know what it means it means
[1:13:17] something but we don't know what it

[1:15:55] announcing her
[1:15:59] approach you said but brother Ben if I
[1:16:01] have lived back then I'd have recognized
[1:16:03] this great sign in the heavens took
[1:16:05] place and there was a baby born and I'd
[1:16:07] have seen it and I'd have known Jesus
[1:16:09] was on the Earth but where is he today I
[1:16:11] tell you the same thing happened to
[1:16:14] you the same thing happened to you the
[1:16:17] there was an announcement that you would
[1:16:19] be
[1:16:20] here and what oh my what could possibly
[1:16:23] hold you back from fulfilling the word
[1:16:25] of God in your day oh I hope you hear me

[1:16:48] heavens and said there would be a bride
[1:16:51] oh I want to I'm I believe I'm part of
[1:16:53] that bride today you say but I've made
[1:16:55] so many mistakes but we are not we're
[1:16:57] not we don't have to be the bridegroom
[1:16:59] we're the bride he is washed us he's
[1:17:01] brought us to him we didn't have to be
[1:17:03] virgin born we're the bride we're Washed
[1:17:06] by the Water of the
[1:17:08] word amen so the bride the bridegroom
[1:17:11] was announced in the heavens the bride
[1:17:13] was announced in the heavens there was
[1:17:15] an announcement of you coming yes
[1:17:18] sir now think about What Christmas Means
[1:17:21] now to
[1:17:24] Believers the brother SS the Church of
[1:17:26] the Living God coming together under the
[1:17:28] word of God and the astronomic heaven is
[1:17:31] announcing her approach he said you
[1:17:33] might not believe that but it's the word
[1:17:34] just the same and you went through all
[1:17:37] kinds of chaos and darkness and
[1:17:38] everything else but one
[1:17:41] day there has to come a day because
[1:17:43] you're a seed of God brother Daniel one
[1:17:45] day there had to be a
[1:17:48] cry one day there has to be a birth yes
[1:17:51] sir and there's something inside of I
[1:17:53] got to go back to church I got to find
[1:17:54] myself under of the altar you you've all
[1:17:57] experienced that one day you said I've
[1:17:59] got to do what the word says I got to
[1:18:00] start living for God there's something
[1:18:02] in your life begin to drive you begin to
[1:18:04] pull you against your better judgment
[1:18:06] what was it God had announced your birth
[1:18:08] you had to be born at a certain
[1:18:12] time bride had to be here at the end
[1:18:16] time and I believe and this is why it
[1:18:19] gives me such great hope I know there
[1:18:21] there's maybe hundreds a dozens at least
[1:18:23] of people in this area maybe grew up in
[1:18:26] church we're in a message Church know
[1:18:28] about the message of the hour and I
[1:18:30] believe many of them maybe maybe you say
[1:18:32] well they weren't seated they wouldn't
[1:18:33] have left I don't necessarily say that's
[1:18:35] true amen I believe there there's
[1:18:37] backsliders out there's people out there
[1:18:39] that that that God's going to get a hold
[1:18:42] of I believe it's coming it's not
[1:18:44] because I said it it's not because I'm a
[1:18:46] I'm a good preacher or a bad preacher
[1:18:47] has nothing to do with it it doesn't
[1:18:49] have anything to do with this church or
[1:18:51] us or anything else what does it have to
[1:18:52] to do with it's God he announced her
[1:18:55] approach and before the time of the end
[1:18:57] every seed of God has got to come to
[1:19:02] maturity it's got to come to maturity oh
[1:19:05] we shouldn't stress about our kids we
[1:19:07] shouldn't worry so much about them don't
[1:19:08] you realize you've got to come to
[1:19:10] maturity young people don't get
[1:19:11] discouraged you've got to come to
[1:19:13] maturity God's going to bring you
[1:19:15] through your trials he's going to bring
[1:19:16] you through your troubles he's going to
[1:19:18] bring you through the the the hard times
[1:19:20] he's going to bring you through
[1:19:21] Temptation he's going to bring you
[1:19:22] through those times why because he
[1:19:24] announced your birth
[1:19:28] sir oh we ought to believe it
[1:19:33] today brother Brandon says what's
[1:19:36] happening he said friends the church is
[1:19:38] coming
[1:19:40] forth oh my God is going to have a
[1:19:43] church without spot or wrinkle and she
[1:19:45] is
[1:19:46] predestinated God said so he would have
[1:19:48] it that makes it right he said who is a
[1:19:51] member I don't know I'm trusting trting
[1:19:53] to be myself I'm trusting you a member
[1:19:55] but he's going to have a body without
[1:19:57] spot or wrinkle and I believe that these
[1:19:59] latterday signs and things that's
[1:20:01] happening every one of them is peeling
[1:20:03] together to show that Christ is ready to
[1:20:05] come for this bride as God in his word
[1:20:07] made manifest in a man a perfect man so
[1:20:10] is God and His word coming again and
[1:20:13] making himself manifested in a
[1:20:16] bride that's very simple that's what we
[1:20:18] call the bride coming of Christ it's not
[1:20:21] that we don't believe in a literal
[1:20:22] coming of Christ but the bride coming of
[1:20:24] Christ is him coming in you in the
[1:20:27] fullness of the word amen him being born
[1:20:29] in
[1:20:30] you amen he said God he said not only
[1:20:33] not will do like Eve did HB it to
[1:20:36] something else but the unadulterated
[1:20:37] word of God will be borned into that
[1:20:39] church and she will stand like Jesus
[1:20:42] Christ did with his Spirit anointing in
[1:20:44] his word he said I believe it's the
[1:20:46] announcement now oh how many could
[1:20:49] believe that today I know it's Christmas
[1:20:51] Eve but how many I hope it stirs your
[1:20:53] heart this morning how many can believe
[1:20:55] I believe it's the
[1:20:57] announcement you talked about
[1:20:58] civilization coming from east to west
[1:21:00] the gospel had to go back from the West
[1:21:02] to the east he said the same sun when as
[1:21:04] far west as it could go he said it had
[1:21:05] to go back East the same sun shining oh
[1:21:09] my the same Sun that Shone in the
[1:21:11] Eastern people had to shine on the
[1:21:13] western people he said to what ripen the
[1:21:15] seed that's been planted to bring forth
[1:21:17] a bride the evening light of the Gospel
[1:21:20] will bring forth a bride amen for the
[1:21:23] Lord Jesus that ought to give us great
[1:21:25] hope today it's not dependent on men
[1:21:27] it's not dependent on pastors it's not
[1:21:29] dependent on Ministry God will use them
[1:21:31] God will use men God will use this
[1:21:32] church but it's not dependent on us
[1:21:34] there a prophecy he announced it in the
[1:21:37] heavens he would have a
[1:21:44] church oh my you see that why the devil
[1:21:47] tried to keep me up all night and
[1:21:48] couldn't
[1:21:49] sleep you want me to say this today but
[1:21:51] I want you to know I want you to
[1:21:53] understand God announced your
[1:21:59] birth the cry was a sign of life and I
[1:22:03] believe this babies have got to be born
[1:22:06] into the kingdom until we leave this
[1:22:09] earth because if they'd all been born
[1:22:11] we'd already be gone that's right
[1:22:13] there's got to be at least one
[1:22:15] left I believe there's
[1:22:18] more Jesus was wasn't born though full
[1:22:21] grown right had to grow up you ever
[1:22:24] think about that like he could have just
[1:22:26] appeared yeah and just been a full grown
[1:22:29] man but God didn't do it that way he did
[1:22:32] it the same way he does with you a baby
[1:22:34] is
[1:22:35] born right and you can't be too hard on
[1:22:37] yourself in that baby stage in fact
[1:22:40] Jesus leaves the house at a rather
[1:22:42] Advanced age 33 30 years of age it
[1:22:46] begins his ministry first 30 years you
[1:22:49] we find him at 12 in the temple that's
[1:22:51] the only sign we have during that time
[1:22:53] that he's even who he says he
[1:22:57] is so he was not born full grown 1 Peter
[1:23:03] 1:18 says tells us this for as much as
[1:23:05] you know that you were not redeemed with
[1:23:06] corruptible things a silver and gold
[1:23:09] from your vain conversation received by
[1:23:11] tradition from your fathers with the
[1:23:14] precious blood of
[1:23:19] Christ as of a lamb without blemish and
[1:23:21] without spot
[1:23:23] who verily was for ordained before the
[1:23:25] foundation of the world but was manifest
[1:23:28] in these last times for you sir who by
[1:23:32] him do believe in God that raised him up
[1:23:33] from the dead and gave him glory that
[1:23:35] your Faith and Hope might be in God
[1:23:37] seeing you have purified your souls in
[1:23:40] obeying the truth through the spirit to
[1:23:42] unfeigned love of the Brethren see that
[1:23:45] you love one another with a pure heart
[1:23:47] fervently it's one of the signs you've
[1:23:48] been born again is you love the Brethren
[1:23:51] that's righten he says being born again
[1:23:55] not of corruptible seed but of
[1:23:57] Incorruptible by the word of God which
[1:24:00] liveth and abideth forever for All Flesh
[1:24:03] is as grass all the glory of man as a
[1:24:05] flower of grass the grass withereth and
[1:24:08] the flower thereof falleth away but the
[1:24:10] word of the Lord endureth forever I'm so
[1:24:12] glad so my birth is not by corruptible
[1:24:15] seed because the word of the Lord it was
[1:24:17] of the word it was a birth of the word
[1:24:19] and the word of the Lord endures forever
[1:24:21] it may take me a while to reach my
[1:24:23] maturity but in during this time I
[1:24:25] cannot fall back I will not die I can't
[1:24:29] come on church I may I may look like I'm
[1:24:31] I'm going downhill but I can't go
[1:24:33] downhill I'm not going to go to hell
[1:24:35] Satan can't have me why because I was
[1:24:37] pre-ordained I was I'm a Son of God or
[1:24:40] you're a daughter of God you belong to
[1:24:43] God you've been prophesied over the the
[1:24:46] heavens announced your birth yes
[1:24:49] sir
[1:24:51] Hallelujah hey amen he said and the word
[1:24:53] of the Lord endureth
[1:24:55] forever and this is the word which by
[1:24:57] the gospel is preached unto you
[1:24:59] wherefore laying aside all malice and
[1:25:01] all G hypocrisies and envies and all
[1:25:03] evil speakings as newborn babes you've
[1:25:06] got to go through that stage he said
[1:25:09] desire the sincere milk of the word that
[1:25:11] you may grow thereby if so be you have
[1:25:14] tasted that the Lord is
[1:25:17] gracious Jesus grows up and he comes
[1:25:20] back to Nazareth a full grown
[1:25:24] man but I want you to watch what he did
[1:25:27] grows up in Nazareth he leaves he comes
[1:25:31] back Luke
[1:25:33] 4:16 he come to nazareth's where had
[1:25:36] been brought
[1:25:37] up and as his custom was he went into
[1:25:39] the synagogue on the Sabbath day stood
[1:25:41] up for to read he went to church Jesus
[1:25:43] had a habit of going to church if he had
[1:25:45] a cell phone it have said so many miles
[1:25:48] to church this
[1:25:50] morning cuz it was his Habit to go it
[1:25:53] still is his Habit to go to church amen
[1:25:56] but you glad he meets with us here amen
[1:25:59] you glad he can meet with you anywhere
[1:26:01] but he's promised where two or three are
[1:26:02] gathered together I will be in their
[1:26:03] midst
[1:26:05] amen he said there was delivered unto
[1:26:07] him the book of the prophet Isaiah and
[1:26:08] when he had opened the book he found the
[1:26:10] place where it was written the spirit of
[1:26:12] the Lord is upon me because Heath
[1:26:14] anointed me now he doesn't find Isaiah 7
[1:26:18] where his birth he doesn't come on and
[1:26:21] say Hees find the place in Isaiah where
[1:26:24] it's written a virgin shall conceive cuz
[1:26:26] that promise had already been
[1:26:29] fulfilled right but now he had to stand
[1:26:32] up and begin to speak and what was he
[1:26:35] going to say he wasn't going to point
[1:26:37] him back to his birth but he said the
[1:26:39] spirit of the Lord is upon me because he
[1:26:42] has anointed me to preach the gospel to
[1:26:44] the poor yes sir he has sent me to heal
[1:26:45] the broken hearted to preach Deliverance
[1:26:47] to the captives and recovering of sight
[1:26:49] to the blind to set at Liberty them that
[1:26:51] are bruised
[1:26:52] to preach the acceptable year of the
[1:26:55] Lord and he closed the book and he gave
[1:26:57] it again to the minister and sat down
[1:26:59] and the eyes of all them that were in
[1:27:00] the synagogue were fastened on him and
[1:27:02] he began to say unto them this day yes
[1:27:06] oh church this day this scripture is
[1:27:09] fulfilled in your
[1:27:12] ears what was he saying he said I'm not
[1:27:14] just a baby in a Manger anymore but
[1:27:16] today the anointing is upon me I've
[1:27:19] grown up and I'm speaking yes The Voice
[1:27:22] of God now could be understood and we
[1:27:24] know this happened in in brother
[1:27:26] brandom's Ministry we we realize that
[1:27:28] this same thing happened and it showed
[1:27:30] that a son had come to maturity God had
[1:27:32] brought his Prophet to a place of
[1:27:34] maturity but we recognize that brother
[1:27:36] brandham doesn't exist outside of the
[1:27:37] Bride right right brother brandom is a
[1:27:39] part of the Bride how many understand
[1:27:41] that I've heard that preach recently and
[1:27:43] I think it's brother Wayne Lawson
[1:27:45] preached that but it's a very valid
[1:27:46] point brother Brandman exists within the
[1:27:48] bride yes right he doesn't exist
[1:27:51] separate from the bride right so when
[1:27:53] when when he come to maturity when he
[1:27:57] stood up and took his book and and and
[1:28:00] and remember the priest handed him his
[1:28:02] book and he read and he preached birth
[1:28:04] pains he come back later and preach this
[1:28:06] day this scripture is fulfilled what was
[1:28:08] God showing there was a member of the
[1:28:10] Bride that had come to maturity that was
[1:28:12] no longer just an infant bride but there
[1:28:14] was at least one that had come all all
[1:28:17] the way into maturity that could speak
[1:28:19] but listen to me he won't be the last
[1:28:21] one that's right Amen to come to
[1:28:23] maturity and that's why I don't believe
[1:28:25] he has to come back for the third pole
[1:28:27] to be manifested in his fullness I do
[1:28:29] not believe that brother brandham has to
[1:28:31] come back to this Earth at all to
[1:28:33] manifest one word of God he did what he
[1:28:34] was sent to do that's right and we are
[1:28:37] doing what we were sent to do and today
[1:28:39] we stand in the pulpit and we preach the
[1:28:41] word of God and we say this day this
[1:28:44] scripture is fulfilled in your
[1:28:48] ears brother Bram told us in that sermon
[1:28:51] he told us this thing in this day the
[1:28:52] scripture is fulfilled he said now but
[1:28:54] in this day sir he didn't just say
[1:28:56] there's to come a prophet there was to
[1:28:59] come a prophet and there came a prophet
[1:29:01] but he said in this day there is to come
[1:29:02] a super Royal Seed of Abraham that's
[1:29:05] exactly what it'd be would be a royal
[1:29:07] bride to the Royal promised son as I
[1:29:10] spoke last night it won't be a natural
[1:29:11] seed it'll be a spiritual seed there is
[1:29:15] to be a spiritual bride raised up which
[1:29:17] will be the Royal seed of the royal
[1:29:19] faith of Abraham's royal son she is to
[1:29:21] come on the scene in the last days she
[1:29:23] is to come on the scene in the last days
[1:29:25] and the time and the place is a promise
[1:29:28] that's given to
[1:29:30] her oh my an announcement of an infant
[1:29:34] bride and now a bride who will come on
[1:29:36] the scene and say this
[1:29:40] day oh God I'm closing Now list look
[1:29:44] there had to come an infant bride but
[1:29:46] she couldn't remain in infancy she had
[1:29:49] to grow up yes amen
[1:29:52] we live in an age people don't want to
[1:29:53] grow up they want to be a kid forever
[1:29:56] that's not what we are or who we are we
[1:29:58] are people called to maturity we are a
