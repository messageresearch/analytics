Satan is defeated he is unable to come and against the bride of Christ and we're so thankful for that today Lord we can take any Gate of Hell and Conquer it we thank you for that we ask your blessings on this service and we'll give you the praise and the glory and the honor in Jesus name [Music] amen Amen to love the Lord this morning amen it's such a blessing to be in the house of the Lord Ezekiel chapter 33 and verse 30. Ezekiel 33 30 good to see each and every one of you I want to say happy anniversary to Gabe and Millennia as well God bless you this morning thank you for being in church this morning I I remember what that one year anniversary was like and and uh we um you know you made it that's a milestone and may there be many many more of those I I think the Lord puts you together that's just my thoughts on it but I feel like he did by the gay but does so much for you over the last couple of years and we all should be grateful shouldn't we for what God's done for each and every one of us Ezekiel 33 30 he says also thou son of man the children of thy people still are talking against thee by the walls and what that means talking against c means talking about you the walls and in the doors of the houses and speak one to another everyone to his brother saying come I pray you and hear what is the word that cometh forth from the Lord and they come into thee as the people cometh they sit before thee is my people and they hear thy words but they will not do them for with their mouth they show much love but their heart goeth after their covetousness and lo Thou Art unto them is a very lovely song of one that hath a pleasant voice and can play well on an instrument they hear thy words but they do them not say God help me that I would never be this way he said and when this cometh to pass Lord will come he said then shall they know that a prophet have been among them pray the Lord would add his Blessing to the word you may be seated this morning as we found out last week we we know that our adversary is defeated we know he's powerful but he is defeated we know that he is uh he is mighty in his abilities and in his stature and in his position but is not mightier than God and therefore greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world right I heard a story about a man who was at the zoo and and he watched this zookeeper walk into a cage of a wild cat and he just walked right in he had nothing but a broom in his hand that he'd go over to that wild cat just laying there and he walked over to him he just poked him with that broom and and the Wildcat snarled at him and he and pretty soon he just got up and left went laid down somewhere else after the Zookeeper came out the man said my said you're brave he said I I tell you what you're up you're the most Brave man I've ever seen I can't imagine getting in a cave with a wild cat the man said no not really he said really he's he's really old and he has no teeth so he said I wasn't as Brave as what I appeared that's the way we are with the Devil the devil had his teeth taken away the sting was taken out of death he has no ability to to come and I think sometimes we treat him as if he's some some great thing and he does he is powerful but not when it pertains to us he has no ability to destroy us because God upholds Us by his spirit and by his word we're so thankful for that today so but we find that Satan has been successful in this age and as I was reading a quota brother randoms it got me thinking about this this morning he has been successful in the area of deception he has taken away the value of the promised word of the age and we find that's the way it was with Ezekiel that the people were gathering they understood the value of a prophet of the Prophet they they could hear the prophet's words but there was no value to the word that he was speaking he said they hear it but they don't do it and and so we find that that happens in every age that he said oh it's beautiful but they don't actually do it and so now brother Branham says this about Lucifer's success in this age that we live in he said now he said he would exalt himself above the most high he would Ascend above the clouds and the Stars he would sit there like God and be above the most time and he has succeeded in carrying out his threats he said he has certainly had a marvelous success in carrying out his threats by the people letting him right he can't do it to you unless you let him but he said the people letting him explain away in every age the value of God's promised word to that age I want us to notice this very closely today and and that's where I want to take my my sermon title the value of God's promised word to this age what is that what is the value of the promised word to the H well I think to know the value of something you you must determine what it is and and then you got to see you know if it's something that's coming from someone if you were bringing me a gift or something I would look first to see what it is and then I would I would want to know how do you handle it because I know if you think it's valuable then you'll handle it in a way that that projects value does that make sense so if God sends me something I want to know that it's valuable and then I want to know as I receive it I want to know that uh that it's been handled in a way that that tells me it has value and then we we want to see what it does once we open the box so to speak once we receive the Revelation once we once we live according to the word of this age once we once we begin to manifest it what does that do for us so what is God's promised word to this age it may be different than what we think because I think sometimes we think about that and think well God's promised word to this age is Malachi 4 and I would say that that's the beginning of it but yet there's a promised word to this age today because that promise has already been fulfilled so let's go to Isaiah chapter 46 and verse 9. and Isaiah says this about the word of God he said Remember the former things of whole he said for I am God and there is none else I am God and there is none like me or do you believe that this morning he said declaring the end from the beginning he said there ain't nobody else that can do that who declares the end from the beginning from ancient times the things that are not yet done he said saying my counsel shall stand and I will do all my pleasure whatever God ever wanted to do he does we were listening to a song Peter and I were it's a new song that's called the The Reckless Love of God and we were talking about that word reckless because nothing God does can be Reckless right it's literally impossible for God to be Reckless because he said my counsel shall stand I would he's not boasting he he cannot being an infinite all powerful almighty God he cannot fail or aren't you glad for you serve a god like that today he cannot fail he cannot let his people down the old song we used to see is God could do anything but fail he is not reckless in his love he's not reckless in his deeds or his words he's not taking a chance on you are you with me this morning he's not taking a chance on you he owns you you belong to him he's going to keep you all the way through you're gonna make it because he said you were going to make and in the deepest darkest moment of your life he said I was there with you he said where will I flee from his presence well I go into hell behold Thou Art there no matter where I go that's you're there you were always there in the deepest darkest moments of my life amen he said for and Isaiah 55 10 first the rain cometh down and the snow from Heaven returneth not thither but watereth the Earth and maketh it bring forth and Bud that it may give seed to the sower and bread to the eater so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which I please it shall prosper in the thing where to I sent it amen so we know then that Isaiah is saying the word of God is a seed and and every seed brings forth of its kind in its season I want us to look this morning at Noah I want us to look at the story of Noah and what the promised word was to his age so we can see and type what the promised word to our age is now in Noah's age in Genesis 6 13. God said to Noah the end of All Flesh has come before me for the Earth is filled with violence through them behold I will destroy them with the Earth so there's several parts to the prophecy that he's going to give to them now he's telling him and see the message that's why we have to we have to declare the whole counsel of God we've got to preach all of the message right because there's different parts for different people there's different parts for the pride for the foolish virgin for the world for the worldly church and then a different part for us now now he he said the end of All Flesh has come before me that's something he's going to do this is a promised word for that age the Earth is going to be destroyed verse 14 makes the an ark of gopher wood this is a promised word yes right for the age he said room shut down making the ark shall pitch it within without with pitch and this is the fashion which thou shall make it of the length of the Ark shall be 300 cubits the breadth of it 50 cubits the height of it 30 cubits Windows Thou shalt make to the ark he didn't just tell him make an ark and then leave it up to him what what kind of Arc to make right because he might have looked back at him and said God what's an ark right build an ark what's an ark right they didn't have no no ocean they didn't even have any rain it just there was just nothing there they weren't sailing he wasn't a sailor he didn't go down to the Jolly Roger and find himself a crew of sailors no God called Noah a farmer and he said build an ark and this is what how you build it yeah well now he said a window thou shall make in the ark and a Cupid Shuffle finish it above and and the door of the Ark says I sat in the side drive with lower second and third stories that shall make it and behold I even I you bring a flood of waters upon the earth now watch you that the ark that's the promised word of God the flood the promised word of God for the age he said I bring a flood of waters upon the Earth To Destroy All Flesh we're in is the Breath of Life from under heaven and everything that is in the Earth shall die but with thee shall I establish my Covenant and thou shalt come into the ark now he's this is still the promised word for the age but now he's saying there's coming a time when you're going to have to come into the ark he said thou and thy sons and thy wife thy wife and thy Sons wives with thee so now Noah built this Ark this boat and his family had to get in and ride out the storm until the art until the water is receded they believed and went in so once the ark was built the focus then was no longer on building the ark because there come a moment when the last nail was hammered in do you understand where I'm going this morning there come a time on the last snail was hammered in and the Ark is complete they just had to go in right so he said I'm gonna make a covenant with you and they could have said Oh Glory to God he's going to make your Covenant with us glory to God we see the ark right here built already built in front of us and by the way it's important that you understand that the ark is built that the vessel that will carry you to Eternity is already built the word that will carry you to a Rapture has already been given the last nail has already been put in or what kind of a people are we to be this morning the last nail is already in the ark Noah's standing there he's used his Henry lays down his hammer lays down his nails down the wood says it's time to go in verse 7 and don't went in and his son sent his wife and his son's wives with him into the ark because of the Waters of the flood if there ever was a day that we needed to go in that today is that day you say what we need to go in because we see the problems before Noah ever saw rain it said he went in because of the Waters of the flood why would he go in because he knew it was the promised word for the age the word promised there would be water he didn't see no water but he still went in to save himself from the water oh Church you may see say well the world's continuing on like it always has but remember there's water coming in this time this gauge it'll be fire there's Fire coming on the earth it's time to go into the word are you with me now so now the word for Noah's day does not work for today now we know that if I come up here and said I have a revelation from God we're going to build an ark and I got you all together and we get we started having work parties every week and I just got it's going to rain it's gonna rain every time I come up here I preach it's gonna rain and then we start building boats we all get ready for it to rain but that's not the promised word for this age it's scripture but it's not the promised word for this age yeah right we have an ark we have something to go into now brother Brandon says this he said let no man by his Creed deceive you he said you stay right in the promise of God the word of God he said of that word if it's a word for this day God vindicates it so he said if he doesn't it's not the word for this day he said the word that fell on the day of Pentecost will not work this day he said no sir that was for Pentecost this is for the bride or the home of the Bride we got something different he said and in other places he says we have that plus right yeah we've been restored back to Pentecost but we're not stopping there the word for our age is Rapture let me just come out if you're wondering what it is Rapture this is the rapture age that's the part of the word again they're in the word of the hour there's many things there was a prophet that was to come there's a bride that's to be made ready but here we are at the other end of it with the art completed yeah yeah and now we just have to make a choice are we going to go in I believe the bride will now watch he said we got something different the Pentecostals represented that again we're in the bride age he said no more than the word of Noah would work in the days of Moses no more than Moses law would have worked in the time of Paul here he said he tried to tell him you were dead to that you cannot have that so now that's the overwhelming the overwhelming push of this hour the overwhelming theme and we we will we will continue to uh to preach the whole word of God because that's the age we live in as a restoration of the entire word but the overwhelming theme is rapture oh don't let that get old to your church don't let that become a well that's the way it was back in the 70s that's the way we were back in the 80s or the 90s but today if there ever was a time that the overwhelming seed ought to be we're going home it's today that's right and now we find that that this age has a certain word a promised word but the brown stated in the times no it's time to see no he said in the times Noah's seed word he didn't learn this in Bible College by the way you want a word of knowledge you're fixing to have one Noah's seed word erected a floating transformation from the Earth to the sky that may not mean much to you but that means a lot to me God gave a word to a prophet yeah yeah and that word became an ark and that Ark carried them across the water listen that's the hour you and I are living in today we're not waiting on an arch to be built but no exceed were erected a floating transformation Hallelujah he said it sounded crazy to the people to have a little cult like Noah had that's what they called it and he told them said thus saith the Lord God has spoken there is coming a rain he said science and the educated and religious of that day said look at that old quack he is getting old his mind is slipping see but he was right because he was a Vindicated prophet and then at the end time his message was truly Vindicated you realize what the Ultimate Showdown the ultimate Vindication of this message is the change of our bodies Hallelujah he said what would he do he said he transformed from the Earth to Glory by an ark of the word that he was preaching oh God it was transformed from Earth to Glory by an ark of the word that he was preaching now say this that we don't have to add any more to that Ark it's done right dark's finished that's not the promised word of this age in the sense that it's coming it's the word of this age but the promised word of this age the promise yet to be fulfilled is the change of the body amen I'm getting ready for it aren't you now look he said when the so he said the snow that Noah's word was an ark now when the New Testament began began the promised word of that day was John's Ministry I may know that at the very beginning it was John's Ministry until John John's Ministry came and then once he came he made everything ready that was the promised word of that age but the people of that day had to go on in order to be saved right John chapter 3 and verse 30 John said he must increase but I must decrease right so now and we've preached about that before but the promised word of this age now what age do we live in today it's the coming of Malachi 4 we know that of Luke 17 30 brother Branham identifies that as the promised word of this age that that was coming but we're not looking for it anymore and we're not looking for an opening of the word if we are we've literally missed the boat all right yeah because the ark's been built and now in our age what are we looking to do we're looking to go in so now he said now it's the Rapture of the Bride that's the portion of the word for this day that's left to us so we've got to go in now but the writer said if I was a young man and looking for a wife to be married and here's to the girl that met every qualification I thought took to make a woman he said why morally she was the queen and lovely and a fine personality a real Christian everything that I could think of to make me a good wife he said no matter how much I say she's perfect she's exactly right she isn't mine till I accept her and the responsibility of her being my wife uh it threw me back brother Gabe I was thinking this week about you and Millennia and you forgive me for this but I was thinking back to that meeting that we had when Millennia came and and Gabe standing over there by himself and we're trying to get him to go talk to her right because unless you talk nothing can happen now I know we got young people in this church that have never spoken a word to one another but if you don't talk you can't ever be friends and if you're never friends nothing else can ever happen and you might say well I I'll just hang around this person you got to open your mouth right and tell her I you know I I think you're you're a nice girl and I'm a nice guy and maybe we should talk some more with your parents permission so no matter how perfect she is and follow her around all the camps and all the services and everywhere you can follow her all around no matter how perfect she is until you say something until you until you until you enter in until you make an advance of some kind until you take on a responsibility of some kind you're never going to have a relationship are you hearing me today he said that's the same thing the message is you might say it's right or this side or the other and say I sympathize with that I believe it's the truth but you've got to accept it and it's got to become a part of you and you a part of it that's right excuse me for yelling at you this morning it's got me stirred up in fact I'm thinking ahead and I'm stumbling over my words but it's just so good the word is so good God is so good to us it's now he said you've got to accept it it's got to become a part of you he said when you marry this certain woman that you've chosen you are one then you are one then and that's the way you are with Christ when you see him manifested and made real then you're a part of him and he is part of you and together you're part of the message he said well how can I become it how can I get in the message how can I become a message believer you've got to become a part of him and he's got to become a part of you I'm just saying I believe the message or going to a message church or wearing long long skirts and and long dresses it's not that at all but it's actually you becoming a part of the word that's right see in in John's time the focus had to turn from the prophet to the prophecy and that happened in our day brother Brown said when he was debating with the priests across the river speaking of John they said God built this altar God told us to do this Moses is the prophet We Believe Moses the sacrifice will never be done away with I can hear John answer back and said have not you read in the scripture what Daniel the Prophet said the daily sacrifice will be done away with and that hour has arrived huh he could stand there and say this is the promised word for the age right he said have you not read what Isaiah said in the 40th chapter the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare the way of the Lord he said there's two prophecies for me yeah he said another thing did you not recognize our Prophet 400 years ago Malachi in the third chapter said behold I send my messenger before my face to prepare the way don't you know this fulfills prophecy prophecy was being fulfilled at about that time the prophet turned and said behold there comes the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world see so many people missed the turn they saw the first part building Ark that's coming to flood and they said let's all go get ready let's let's do it but there was a turn the people had to go in about that time the prophet turns and behold there comes the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world now what's the attraction it's changed from the prophet to his prophecy reality now when you attend to play I don't know how many of you have attended to play but we most of ours have been hillbilly place in Silver Dollar City but they have lights and you know there'll be one person maybe on the stage he'll come out he'll introduce or he'll come out and set up the scene or maybe it's a dramatic play I know we watched Moses and and we watch Jonah over in Branson and when he'd come out the spotlight would be on him just him everything else is dark right and and the spotlight's on him he's standing there in the spotlight and he's having a conversation with god or he's setting up the next scene and suddenly everything goes black and it's for a purpose to redirect your attention because when everything goes black then you're looking for where the spotlight Falls next and the spotlight doesn't stay on that actor as he goes behind the curtain right he's going to step behind the curtain and what they do is misdirection what they'll do they'll open up something over here and all of a sudden the light will shine over here on the left side or over here on the right side and there will be either another actor or maybe even the same actor but he'll be in different clothes and he'll have it he'll he'll be wearing a brother Brandon would say in a different mask and he's standing over here on the other side he's doing something different what was it the spotlight does not continue to look for the previous actor that has stepped behind the curtain but the attraction changes to the current act now listen when brother Branham left us the spotlight did not go on any preacher yeah because brother Brown's job John's job was to introduce the bridegroom brother man's job was to introduce the bride yeah oh now look what he did he stood there in the spotlight and he preached to us then he preached to us he preached to us at Christ is the mystery of God revealed and he preached us to get us ready for our husband get us ready he preached us the mysteries of God and the full word of God he stood there in the spotlight and God took him off the scene he stepped behind the curtain and it went black huh and every Minister pops up so I'm going to be the yeah yeah the next one in the spotlight but when he comes out the way the play is written it's not a preacher it's not a minister it's not a church what steps out from behind the curtain The Pride herself Hallelujah because now she's been introduced to the bridegroom the attraction changes the current Act this is the prophecy for our age I don't know how I could say it any clear first Thessalonians 4 16 for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout that part is done that part has been finished he is descended with the voice of the Archangel with the Trump of God the dead in Christ Church shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air that's the part we're at that's the current Act that's where the spotlight is he said so shall we ever be with the Lord now again the ark had to be finished at some point you just can't keep adding to it you know you can you can make it look pretty you can go and add some Frills and and polish it make it look better but you but it's just it is what it is it's the way God made it it's the way he wanted it to be but now when we begin to look at that we begin to see well if this promised word of the age come to us and it has value how is it handled when it was brought to us we could look at that in Noah's Ark we could say how did he build it well he built it according to the instructions from God he built it just exactly the way God said build it and so now how is it handled and because it matters when someone brings you something of value in order to convince you if I had if I had something of value in my house and I brought it to you and I just carried around like this and set it down on the counter and tossed it to you I said that thing's worth a million dollars huh we better not be right makes you scared to hold it and you doubt me because I don't have a million dollars sitting on the shelf right and you know if I had something that was worth a million dollars it'd be under locking key it would be protected it would be cared for you when God sent a prophet in this age you come in a certain Manner and he handled the word in a certain way and so we see that it happened in Paul's time Paul when he come to the Corinthians he said I'd rather when I came to you came not with Excellency of speech or of wisdom declaring it unto you the testimony of God for I determined not to know anything among you save Jesus Christ in him Crucified My focus was on the value of Christ in him only right he left off everything else all his Pharisee teaching he didn't drag that forward in the message but he said I forgot everything I learned and everything was about the value all right if this bottle of water was worth a million dollars sometimes I feel like it is I bet you do too and I'm drinking out of it was really hot and the bottle of water is worth a million dollars what would I do with it how would I handle it what would I do I make sure it didn't get broken I'd make sure that it didn't spill out better handle it carefully he said I I've got all my focus on it you ever seen a kid walk through the house you don't go get something and they walk to the house told Peter go get a pair of scissors the other day here he comes running with it I said you don't need to do that your mama taught you better because he was the valuable thing not the scissors you ever seen a kid you come go get something to get it you're like not like that treat it with some respect it's worth something you ever done that you know you have an old suit you don't care what you do with it you just throw it over the side somewhere and get crumples up you get a new one that you just had to pay for right and you walk some of y'all wear suits I guess still somebody does but you take an old suit or an old pair you got that what do you do you hang it up you make it real nicely for the first week or two yeah yeah why it has value oh God how much more value out the people of God and the word of God have to us and look you'd be careful not to break it yeah yeah we need to be careful not to break one another God help me with that I I learned to be pretty hard-nosed as a child but I have to be careful not to break people you can push people till you break them and you've broken a valuable thing right right and so Paul said I I just my focus was on the message I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's Wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and the power that your face should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God and so we find the messenger of this age he did not point to himself but he held something precious the promised word for the age and he says this he said I want you to know this is sure and you that listen to this tape you might have thought today I was trying to say that about myself because he preached on the anointed ones at end time he said being that I was packing this message he said I have no more to do with it than nothing no more than just a voice in my voice even against my better judgment I wanted to be a Trapper but it's the will of my father I declare to do and determined to do he said I wasn't the one that appeared down on the river in other words don't get the value mixed up the values and what I'm carrying and why do we value brother Reynolds so much because he did have value what was his value his message right that's his value it's his message you can't separate one from the other and we'll get into that in just a moment but the message and that's why a person who preaches the word has to live the word a person let me take a little bit farther there should be the bride ought to live the word because you packed something of great value it shouldn't be thrown out with the world it shouldn't be done just any old way when you live just any way you want to but there's value to it you have value today he said I wasn't the one that appeared down the river I was only standing there when he appeared I'm not the one that performs these things and foretells these things it happens as perfect as they are I'm the only one that's near when he does it I was only a voice that he used to say it it wasn't what I knew it's what I just surrendered myself to that he spoke through it isn't me he said it wasn't for seven things all know it was the manifestation of the son of man it wasn't the angel his message it was the mystery that God unfolded it's not a man it's God the angel is not the son of man he was the messenger from the son of man the son of man is Christ he is the one that you're feeding on you're not feeding on him man a man his words will fail but you're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man yeah he recognizes the value of what he was saying I I will say this as a minister I need to be careful not to place the value of my words over the value of a prophet's words as if my words were more important important they may be important but we have a message first Peter 4 and 10 says this he said as every man hath receive the gift even so Minister the same one to another as good stewards of the manifold grace of God so you've been given a great gift you realize what a gift it was in that age for those people to find out that Gentiles could be saved what a gift that that was here they've been walking in darkness carrying clubs on their back and doing all kinds of things that were ungodly and everything else and Paul comes preaching a message and said this gospel that you've heard about this Moses that you've heard about these prophets that you've heard about this wasn't just for the Jews [Music] this was for you and you don't have to jump through a bunch of Hoops and be circumcised and do a bunch of rituals and have a bunch of feast days and stuff and nonsense like that creeping back around the message we don't do those things why are we because this gospel we got the Revelation he said it was a great gift great gift come what's dropped right in her lap oh my great gift can you imagine how they felt I'll tell you what I felt the same way when I I when I would have been in a denomination probably he'll Wesley and holding this person today but this message come by my family's way and when it come by my way it changed the trajectory of my life a great gift has been given to me and as every man hath received the gifts even so Minister the same one to another right this message is not just honey or fishing and those things are great I love to well I don't talk about hunting but I I'm patient with y'all but I love talk about fishing that's not the word of the age yeah that's not the promise we're the age as every man hath to receive the gift Minister the same you you were born again by the word of this hey do you realize that your new birth is not a Baptist New Birth or a Methodist New Birth it's a word birth and so the fact that you were born again you received the baptism of the holy ghost that comes from the word of this hour and so whenever we testify about our new birth what are we doing we're ministering one to another as good stewards of the manifold grace of God when's the last time you fellowship with someone around the message of the hour think about I'm not talking about you know arguing about a bunch of stuff bunch of depth and stuff that you don't even understand I'm talking about the goodness of God when you just realize how good God has been to bring you this message he said If any man speak that's the way we should value the words that we say in the pulpit if it was the word of God if any men Minister let him do it as of the ability which God giveth that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ to whom be praised and Dominion forever and ever first Peter 5 1 the elders which are among you had a sword who am also an elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ also partaker of the glory that shall be revealed he said feed the flock of God which is among you taking the oversight thereof not by constraint but willingly and we've talked about that yeah I can't make you stay here but willingly because you want to be here not for filthy look or money but I've already mind neither is being Lords over God's Heritage but being examples to the flock you see this the value of this message in my Ministry it isn't about me it's not in any other Church well if you come to our church that's not what this message is this message cast down denominationalism well our church is the best one in the message the the one that has the most Spirit the one that has the most word and people fight and fuss about it and getting competition about who has the most of this and the most of that I tell you it's time we turn back to the message of the hour and said this is about a word that come in our day to get us ready for a Rapture this isn't about me it's not about you are you with me now and yet when you surrender to it you say well it is about me in the sense that I have to carry it I have to become one with it now now watch as we say that now the messenger had such great value the message rather had such great value that God purified the messenger before he could even bring it he spoke to him said don't ever smoke drink you know the story don't defile your body in any way you've got a work to do when you get older yeah right and then we come into the third poll he told him he said you're about to cross Jordan you got to be more sincere more sincere than what you are yeah why would why would he tell him that why would he rebuke him in his in his visions you don't don't explain it he said no one will know about it he said it'll just be it'd be that third poll why did he do that he had to handle it with such care oh God because it wasn't about the man it was about the message see now brother Brown said when the word of the Lord comes to a true servant he must go regardless of circumstances or regardless of difficulties he must go anyhow whether he's prepared whether he feels like it whether he wants to whether whatever more he must go anyhow it's God speaking and he must carry this message that's the way we ought to be when we come to the house of God a messenger who comes you come with a message and song or a message in a messaging and a word a message and I and as a preacher or a message to the little children or whatever that it is you come with a message you come with this message you represent this message you've been sitting here in the audience you represent this message right in your congregation that represents the message and whether you feel prepared or whether you feel like it or whatever more you must go you must go anyhow why are you representing more than yourself you represent the message it's God speaking yeah and I don't get to just handle it any way I want to right I got to take it seriously because it's the word of the Lord right he said he must carry this message he never goes for foolishness he never goes for money he never goes for popularity well if everybody likes what I had to sing then I'll sing You Should Never sing because that's not what it's about if everybody likes what I had to preach and I'll preach if it if I get a bunch of likes on Facebook if I get a bunch of likes on YouTube if everybody comes to church that Sunday then I'll preach then I'll see that's not what it's about he's you have the word of the Lord you don't go for popularity he only goes in the name of the Lord for one thing he's got a mission he's sin of the Lord and listen to this he is the word of God because he's carrying the word of the Lord that is the true prophet of the Lord that's different from a Baptist with his message in the sense that he's saying well I Jesus saves but but I don't have much standard for my own life because all I have to do is believe and go in but a true Messenger says Jesus saved and I Jesus says and I am saved Jesus sanctifies I am Sanctified Jesus fills with the Holy Ghost I am filled with the Holy Ghost are you with me now yeah so we all carry this message we all do what value do we give it now when we talk about the message a lot of times we talk about we talk about stuff we talk about things I got thinking about this I have Nostalgia does anybody ever else here get stricken with nostalgia would you bear with me in my Folly for just a moment I put some things under the pulpit today I got all kinds of stuff you haven't seen this side of me before you know when the message come to us how did it come in book form tape form some of y'all know I don't have a reel to reel but Joel's got one somewhere but I you know we had an old reel-to-reel players I've seen them I've listened on them if you ever listened on a reel to Real Player so many of you have wasn't that wonderful wasn't a wonderful experience it's scratchy and it's hard to hear right but it was the message it had value right I remember when we used to get the message like this remember this wait by the way we've got a complete set on most of tapes and they're going into boxes now if you want some I don't know what you would play them on but if you want some we've got them complete set of tapes back there and we're putting them in boxes because we're gonna redo that room but look that's the way they came you remember that it was brown looked like the 80s that's when it was made right and before that you know we had a complete set to it brandsville we had a pirated set we ours was stolen food but it was it was good had a little words written on I check those out many times I I told the kids melody told me I was telling her about tapes she said we were boxing them up she said what's a tape player and she said what do you play these on how do you get these on a computer I said you don't I said it's a tape player and she said what's the tape player and I said believe it or not when these other kids were little I had a tape player in my car and I carry these tapes and these are the ones we have the most of back there you remember when these come out filtered tapes right you could get these tapes and and and we got a box of these in in a box every month I don't know how many of you were on the tape list but we got a box every month and I can I'll never forget it the mailbox our house was a quarter of a mile from our house because you had to go down this Gravel Road and all the way at the end of the gravel road is the mailbox so we'd stopped there when we went out or when we come in so you'd stop there and I remember we checked the mailbox every day whenever we knew that there was a tapes coming because when you got it then you got to go through and see it and it started in 65 and you listen to every one of them and you went through and nobody else did this did they but a few of y'all did we listened to every one of them and then they come through and the next box would come had great value to us I couldn't go I didn't know if the preachers around me were preaching something if I hadn't heard it I didn't know if it was true or not because we didn't have a way of searching it I'm only 37. am I 37 or 38 37 thank you foreign but but you know we didn't have any way of searching it and so we we had I remember when I first started preaching uh we we come out like this we come out with with books so I had a whole stack the books like this and before that we had brother mammel's book sister Fritz back there you go check her hand later and tell her thank you because a lot of the books that we have sister Fritz sat down on the tape player and listen to it and typed it out and listen to it and typed it out huh that's how it got there somebody had to do it there were others that did it as well but somebody had to right somebody had to do that you had these old books like this and I would take a whole stack of them and that's how I do it I'd Mark the page highlight I still got something I've highlighted you marked the page you fold it like that you highlight you read the quote so you weren't preaching very much broadly because you couldn't get to very much you can only get to a little bit so we brought that and I hope I'm not boring you this morning but the word had value to us remember the song books we still got both the song remember these we even sang the message you know some of them aren't too doctrinally correct either we still sang them they had value right we got quote books we put together I remember the golden nuggets book I tried to find that I've got that somewhere if I think it's back there but I we had the golden nuggets and we read the gold nuggets that really helped me but JP is a young man the golden nuggets book because I learned that's the first time I'd heard of the opening of the word because the brother put it together in there and just quote so he put together but it was just what he put together you couldn't look you had brother manless's books and things church the church age book you remember when it was hardcover and now we have a new edition of that uh they finally come from tapes to CDs we got a bunch of those back there too and some of you still have a CD player we had with the the table come out and before that it was fully abused you remember that I remember the old dos program that they first rode and you had a old computer you had to wait on it to come up and then it added a dot matrix printer and it would print out the quote boy I thought that was technology right now we can search the message that value it was precious now I wonder sometimes if we didn't put more value in this and this I mean the physical thing that we did on what was said on it right because this will pass away just like this will but brother random tells a story about a postage stamp you've all heard it he tells the story about a postage stamp he said here was a man that had a postage stamp I got stuff all over the place here's a man that's got a postage stamp or a little boy he said he found it he realized it was old so he takes it down to the Antique shop the guy gives him a dollar for it and he is perfectly happy now we can buy an ice cream cone right so he goes down and buys an ice cream cone the man at the at the antique shop realizes it has value he sells it for 25 000 the next man sells it for 250 000. and brother Brandon said it wasn't a piece of paper to the boy it was just a piece of paper to some of us it was just a supernatural book or a quote book or or a tape it's just a tape but the tape wasn't the value brother bear said the value was not the postage stamp the value was what was printed on it you realize the value of the word for this age was not in tapes and books but it was what was printed on it but I'll say this where are we at what what has happened to us because I think sometimes we because how we handled it remember how we handled these if you do remember how you handled the message and now we've got it on our phones or on our devices and I've got all the message on here I got boxes and boxes of tapes back there it's all on here but what value do I place on it now when this left that I take did I lose the value for the word God help us today how you handle the word shows the value you place on it you're fighting fuss about it yeah all it is is my my group or my no it's the word of the age it's getting out of here it's an ark God built an ark in our day and it wasn't this this is flimsy this is plastic that's not the ark but the ark is the word that was on it and where is that ARC today where is it at where is that word it's right there it's right here it's in our hearts but let me tell you today unless you get it off of this you can never get it in your heart unless you listen to it unless you becomes a part of you I'm afraid we're turning our Focus so much and we're like well you know it's all about us it's all about the churches and things that's good but it's about this message this message still has value in this day this is all I have to preach this is all that I have this is all that we are as a church if it wasn't for this message we might as well go out and be Baptist because it's a lot easier we might as well go out and be Pentecostals it's a lot easier we could be something else we could have praise and worship we can do all the other things that we do but this word has value let's fight for that let's protect it let's stand up with it let's believe it good let's handle it right God forbid that I would handle that word in a less than careful way because the word the people see is not what's on here not even what's preached over the internet but it's my life because what happens when you walk into the Promised word of this age you become a part of that promise to work yeah as long as the Arc was being built they weren't a part of it right as long as it was as long as they were getting ready get all the stuff ready animals were coming in but when they walked in they become part of it that's what you've got to do young people don't let this value this message be of no value to you walk into it walk into it this message will last you say well if the Lord didn't come when we thought he would I don't know it might be tomorrow it might be another 50 years but if it's another 50 years the value of this message will only have increased in this day this day man say what they want to say by AI technology and they can present to you a voice that sounds like brother Brandon's but it's not I don't want to scare you but you better know this word they can make it sound like anything oh I put my trust in the tapes I put my trust in a man men will fail you any man will put your trust in the word because brother branham's book was this book his court book was this one this was his quote book and everything and the things that he preached come back to this we're going to talk about that a little bit this afternoon I've used up my time but I've got just a few more minutes hang with me I know his family walked into that Ark they were sealed away from destruction they were sealed out of death and into life brother said we find out when a man comes sent from God ordained of God with the truth thus saith the Lord the message and the messenger are one and the same now you've heard this a lot people take this and say well well brother Brandon his message are the same well that's true but look where he goes with it he said because he is sent to represent thus saith the Lord word by word so he and his message is the same he said a denominational man under denominational auspices he in the churches it's the one he said a theologian under theology made by some denomination he and his messenger one Church of theology a theologian he said then when a man comes with us saith the Lord he and the message is one and when Elijah come with us saith the Lord he and his message became one he said just as Jesus when he come he was the word Saint John 1. so the word of God and the messenger the age was the self thing sell same thing all the time he said that's right Jesus was the word that was prophesied up he was what the prophet said would happen of urgent shall conceive and bear this child he said way back in the beginning God told them said the woman said shall Bruce the Serpent's head he was her heel all these prophecies have been given David crying all the rest of the prophets down to the age of speaking of him he was that word manifested he said now do you see where I'm trying to get to you he said I spoke with you pretty plain this morning don't you see the authority of the Living God in the Living Church Hallelujah the bride the sick are healed the dead erased up why because this is a supernatural message and the supernatural message come back it wasn't Wordle we thought it was just well he's together I can remember gathering in living rooms and listening to the message of the hour and listened to it it had such great value to us but listen the value in it was in the power of it that the power would add the same power it was on the message would come on us the sick or healed the dead erased up the cripples walk the blind sea the gospel Goes Forth in its power for the message and the messenger are the same the word is in the church in the person he said oh the devil is howling about this oh this is from Christ The Mystery of God revealed he said the manifested truth of the promise of the word in her alone have you ever thought about that what great value that this has because this word is not in every group it's not an every woman if we can say it that way it's not in every church but it's in you Hallelujah and he said the promise of the word in her alone he said they don't have the answer when Jesus comes why didn't those Pharisees he said if I cast out Devils by the Finger of God who do you cast them out by see he stood alone and his church stands alone she is not hooked with nothing but he was identified by God being the body that God dwelt in and the church is identified by his body doing the same thing she is his body the manifested truth of his promised word for the last days I tell you what is the value of the promised word for the age promised word for the age is you remember when they went in the argument was the ark well they were building the ark when they went in the promised word for the age was Noah and his family the message the message in the messenger became one and we become one with this message she is his body the manifested truth of his promised word for the last days and she and she alone stands by it don't let Satan beguile you like he did Eve yeah you get on the internet and start looking at things people have said about the message and how but this message changed me I don't believe this message because of some argument that somebody argued me into it this message changed me it made me different I'm not who I was and because of that I know this this message is right [Applause] I am the manifested word for this hour it has changed the trajectory of my family it has made us what we ought to be it's given us brotherly love it's given us godliness it's giving us Holiness it's giving us the power of God back in the church again it's giving us healing it's giving us salvation oh my we ought to thank God for that today we are the manifested word of God for our day we are the word of the hour Hallelujah she is the word of the hour Hallelujah he said he said that's why the devil is howling that's why he's howling that's why he's mad don't you realize that's why he's trying everything he can to take you down to take down this message take that word out of your heart Hallelujah we're just gonna have to stop me and sister Stephanie are going to have to have church we realize the value of it hey man when we seeing Love Lifted Me If it lifted you it means something more to you amen we've seen there's power in the blood if you found Power in the Blood it means more to you there's been power in your life Glory amen I gotta preach oh God I wish you could step up here and feel what I'm feeling right now that's why the devil is selling these great organizations to set up something to close her up they'll never do it let me tell you let me tell you something some of those organizations that are trying to close up churches are inside the message but they'll never do it there will be somebody who'll preach the word they'll never do it she'll be taken up not closed up Hallelujah she is not risen Hallelujah she is now risen how do I know I'm going in a Rapture I've already been raised up I already belong to God I'm already his child [Music] [Applause] oh yeah Hallelujah she is now listen
