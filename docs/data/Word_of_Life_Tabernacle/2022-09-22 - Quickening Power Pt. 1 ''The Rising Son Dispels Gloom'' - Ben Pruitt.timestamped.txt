[44:58] grateful for Lord all the things you've
[45:01] done for us through the week Lord we
[45:03] woke up today and
[45:05] we were able to get up and come to
[45:07] church and we're thankful for that Lord
[45:09] and Lord for those that were not able
[45:11] those that are sick Lord and watching
[45:13] tonight I pray that you'd reach out to
[45:15] them Lord where they are or that you'd
[45:18] help them and Lord that you'd strengthen
[45:20] their bodies Lord of our elderly folks
[45:22] Lord as they get to an age in life where
[45:25] it's difficult to recover from things I
[45:27] I pray that you give them a special
[45:29] blessing tonight and just just work
[45:31] especially Lord in their lives bring
[45:33] Miracles out Lord in their bodies I pray
[45:36] Lord I pray you do something for us
[45:38] tonight here that are together to order
[45:40] something special Lord that your word
[45:43] would be so clear to us Lord that we
[45:45] could never deny it but Lord we would
[45:47] always say Lord that you are Risen Lord
[45:50] and you are risen in our lives we thank
[45:52] you for that I pray you bless the word
[45:54] Lord and may you hold my tongue keep me
[45:57] from saying those things that I
[45:59] shouldn't say Lord I'll say only those
[46:01] things that I should we pray in Jesus
[46:03] name amen
[46:06] and God bless you
[46:07] turn with me to Mark chapter 16 tonight
[46:10] Mark chapter 16 verses 1 and 2 and then
[46:13] Romans 8 11 I'm going to take an Easter
[46:18] text
[46:20] and we're going to look at this for some
[46:22] time and you might be as you're turning
[46:24] in your Bibles
[46:26] you're thinking brother Ben doesn't know
[46:28] what time of year it is
[46:30] but actually Easter is every every day
[46:35] it's a resurrection we honor the
[46:37] resurrection of the Lord and I thought
[46:39] this was appropriate or may spend a few
[46:42] weeks on it I want to study from the
[46:45] sermon it is the rising of the sun
[46:47] brother random subject in that sermon
[46:49] was the quickening powers what I want to
[46:51] call this he preached out on April 18
[46:54] 1965. we're going to look at some of the
[46:56] things brother Branham said I think it's
[46:58] appropriate for the time that we live in
[46:59] even for the time of year because it's
[47:01] the fall say well why would that be
[47:03] appropriate for the fall because it's
[47:04] when things are dying that's when you
[47:07] need to know that there's life on the
[47:10] other side yeah right and I think as you
[47:13] reach that time of your life or or as
[47:16] the ebb and flow of Life comes and goes
[47:18] that that we need to know there's a
[47:20] quickening power and there's something
[47:22] more than just church churchanity than
[47:25] just coming to church and being here but
[47:28] there's got to be a life on the inside
[47:30] of us so I want to look at that tonight
[47:32] and so let's go to Mark 16 and 1 and it
[47:36] says and when the Sabbath was passed
[47:38] Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of
[47:40] James and Shalom bought sweet spices
[47:44] that they might come and anoint him
[47:47] and very early in the morning the first
[47:49] day of the week they came into the
[47:51] Sepulcher at the rising of the Sun and
[47:56] then Romans 8 11
[47:58] but if the spirit of him that raised up
[48:01] Jesus from the dead dwell in you
[48:04] he that raised up Christ from the dead
[48:07] shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by
[48:12] his spirit that dwelleth in you I pray
[48:15] the Lord without his Blessing to the
[48:17] word you may be seated this evening
[48:21] there's so many questions today as to
[48:23] what the holy spirit is and what it does
[48:26] that I thought we would go to this
[48:28] sermon and study it I want to stay as as
[48:32] balanced as we can and and and and try
[48:35] to uh get the thought of the sermon
[48:37] across to you and point out some things
[48:40] as we have time that I'm so grateful
[48:43] that I wasn't my responsibility to bring
[48:45] the message and just my responsibility
[48:48] to preach it and so I can take my time
[48:50] I'm not I'm not hurried in that way as
[48:53] far as getting a message out we have the
[48:55] message and but it's my responsibility
[48:57] to get it to you and your responsibility
[48:59] to receive it not just from me but from
[49:02] the messenger of the hour and and we
[49:04] know ultimately the messenger was Christ
[49:08] right not that brother Branham and his
[49:09] flesh was Jesus Christ but the messenger
[49:12] was Jesus Christ speaking through a
[49:14] prophet and so we need to recognize our
[49:17] day and our hour and understand where
[49:19] we're at and why we preach the things
[49:21] that we do this is a message church we
[49:23] need to preach the message
[49:25] right and so we're going to do that to
[49:27] the best that we can and and and like I
[49:30] said sometimes we uh we we preach as as
[49:33] ministers we present a certain side of
[49:36] the message or a certain uh slant on it
[49:39] based on our own personality but I don't
[49:41] want to do that I I want to try our best
[49:43] to present the gospel and declare the
[49:46] whole Gospel of Jesus Christ and that's
[49:48] why sometimes I know you you probably
[49:50] get whiplashed because we're going back
[49:51] and forth from teaching and preaching
[49:53] and doing the things that we do and
[49:55] using the other Ministries that we do
[49:57] but I think it's necessary you you may
[50:00] like steak but you can eat steak all the
[50:02] time well some people do but uh it it
[50:05] you know it's just probably in the end
[50:07] not as healthy as if you'd have a
[50:09] balanced diet and and so we want to have
[50:12] a balanced diet don't we and what do we
[50:14] feed on we're Eagles aren't we we feed
[50:16] on the word
[50:18] we feed on the words of God and so we
[50:20] want to get into that word now this
[50:23] sermon was preached two years after the
[50:26] seals so you can believe it you can if
[50:29] you're the of the persuasion you can't
[50:31] believe anything before the steals but I
[50:33] don't believe that I think brother
[50:35] random was always a prophet when he
[50:37] preached the things that he did and but
[50:39] he grew in his understanding and so as
[50:41] we get to the end uh towards the end of
[50:44] brother random's life he uh this is to
[50:46] the spot where he has matured and is
[50:48] understanding in his teaching and you'll
[50:51] notice that as we go through some of
[50:53] these things and and but brother Branham
[50:55] didn't stop believing in the Holy Ghost
[50:57] after the seals he didn't stop believing
[51:00] and having church and and going to
[51:03] church and serving God and and calling
[51:05] people to an altar and laying hands on
[51:08] the sick in fact brother Branham did
[51:10] more of some of those things after even
[51:12] than he did before and and so we're
[51:15] going to show some of that as well so
[51:17] brother Branham begins that sermon and
[51:19] he begins by calling attention to the
[51:22] picture of the cloud and it's Cloud that
[51:25] was in Life Magazine we put it up here
[51:27] you may have it there in the back to put
[51:29] up on the middle screen but it's the
[51:31] cloud that was in Life magazine and and
[51:34] what it does it's a sign it's not that
[51:37] the cloud is any particular virtue in
[51:39] itself but brother Branham if you go and
[51:42] look at these sermons later in his life
[51:43] he's constantly calling attention to
[51:46] that and he says this he said now he
[51:49] said they asked to know
[51:50] he said science one of them in Tucson
[51:53] wanted to know any significance so they
[51:56] reached out to brother random for that
[51:57] he said but I didn't tell them he said
[52:00] you all knew it told beforehand but it
[52:03] wasn't for them it was for you
[52:07] he said and so there he spoke to me he
[52:10] said and said the Seven Seals will be
[52:12] open the seven Mysteries Sevenfold
[52:15] mystery of the Bible
[52:17] that's been closed up since the
[52:20] foundation of the world will be revealed
[52:21] so he's saying that when that cloud was
[52:24] there he said he spoke to me and said
[52:26] the Seven Seals will be revealed he said
[52:29] and we yet a humble little group I I
[52:32] think we could identify with that
[52:33] tonight we yet a humble little group
[52:36] compared with all the world he said
[52:39] we've enjoyed now notice how he puts it
[52:41] now in past tense he said we've enjoyed
[52:44] these blessings hearing those Mysteries
[52:49] right so people try to tell you well
[52:51] some of them have been revealed and some
[52:52] of them haven't and so much of it's been
[52:54] revealed he said we have we have enjoyed
[52:57] these blessings
[52:59] these Mysteries that's that we've heard
[53:01] these mystery that's been revealed he
[53:03] said marriage divorce serpent seat right
[53:06] all of that the the understanding of all
[53:09] of that was revealed at the opening of
[53:11] the seals
[53:12] he said he said marriage divorce serpent
[53:14] seed all these different questions has
[53:16] been completely revealed to us
[53:18] someone say completely
[53:20] completely revealed to us
[53:23] so we don't have to re-reveal it
[53:26] right it's been completely revealed but
[53:29] there's so much that we can get into so
[53:31] much we can be a part of
[53:33] and we need to be a part of it
[53:35] I would say this if you're a Christian
[53:37] of struggling and maybe you say well
[53:39] brother Ben here you are preaching on
[53:41] doctrinal things that I'm struggling
[53:43] with my life and and just trying to
[53:45] serve the Lord and and get a get ahead a
[53:49] little bit on my paycheck and I'm
[53:50] struggling with the everyday things of
[53:52] life but I think you'll learn as you go
[53:54] along in life that if you would if you
[53:57] would grab a hold of the mysteries of
[53:58] God you'd grab a hold of the of the deep
[54:01] things of God that will actually help
[54:03] you in those other areas of your life
[54:05] because you realize this is not the end
[54:07] and this is not what I'm here for this
[54:10] is not what it's all about the everyday
[54:12] mundane things of life and we'll deal
[54:15] with those things too as we did on
[54:16] Sunday but we need to know who God is
[54:19] and and what he is and and his nature
[54:22] and what he does
[54:24] we need to have an understanding of that
[54:27] in order to make it in this age this is
[54:30] our age
[54:31] this is for us
[54:33] this is bride food
[54:36] are you hearing me today this is bride
[54:38] food and the bride ought to want to eat
[54:40] bright food
[54:41] amen I know I want to eat it
[54:45] you get some food that I like I've never
[54:47] liked peanut butter I don't want
[54:49] anything to do with it I've never tasted
[54:50] it or they don't smell good
[54:53] so I've never eaten peanut butter
[54:55] so you can put all the peanut butter out
[54:57] here you want to I'd starve to death
[55:00] I was in the Philippines and and we've
[55:03] been gone for out preaching all day and
[55:05] I come back at night and I had a friend
[55:07] who was flying in he'd gotten delayed
[55:10] for a couple days in Japan he didn't
[55:12] like Japanese food I'd have been
[55:14] perfectly happy in Japan but the
[55:15] McDonald's was closed in Japan so at the
[55:18] airport where he was so he never ate
[55:20] well he was there for two days and he
[55:22] gets in late one night and we're sitting
[55:24] there on top of a roof in the Philippine
[55:26] islands and and I'd preached all day
[55:28] it's about midnight and host there the
[55:31] brother that was keeping us he ran
[55:33] downstairs he wanted to find something
[55:34] we could eat so he went downstairs he
[55:36] got a big old jar of Jif peanut butter
[55:39] and a spoon
[55:41] and that's what we had Jif peanut butter
[55:43] and a spoon I didn't eat any of it
[55:46] I was hungry but not that hungry
[55:49] right because it wasn't something I
[55:51] liked
[55:53] if you find yourself not like well I
[55:55] could take church or leave it you need
[55:57] to find something you like
[55:59] and if you don't like the word there's a
[56:01] problem
[56:04] there ought to be a hunger and a desire
[56:07] I didn't want nothing to do with the
[56:08] peanut butter but you put a nice steak
[56:10] in front of me you put some mango in
[56:12] front of me I love the mango brother
[56:15] sister Tracy got me a mango here a while
[56:16] back I love the mango but I out you can
[56:19] take the peanut butter and give me the
[56:21] mango why because it's something I like
[56:23] this is something I like
[56:26] right the open book is something that I
[56:28] like I like to eat it and it ought to
[56:30] means something to us amen we ought to
[56:33] like it now excuse me for getting off on
[56:35] that tangent
[56:37] now he said
[56:39] I'm getting to that place Brother David
[56:41] where I get a little self-conscious
[56:43] because I know you've all heard these
[56:44] stories before
[56:46] so whenever you tell that story you know
[56:48] I know I've told that two three times so
[56:50] y'all forgive me I thought only old
[56:52] pastors did that and
[56:54] washed up but you know
[56:57] now brother Branham says he said he
[57:00] spoke to me there and we've enjoyed
[57:01] these Mysteries and he said it's been
[57:04] completely revealed to us not by man
[57:06] noticed but by God yeah
[57:09] not by man but by God himself he said
[57:12] brother Ben how could brother Branham
[57:13] say that well what does the Bible say
[57:15] the lamb opened the seals
[57:18] the Bible does not say that brother
[57:20] Branham opened the seals lamb opened the
[57:23] seals
[57:24] and then he took the Revelation and
[57:26] showed it to his Prophet messenger but
[57:28] it was a lamb who broke the seals so he
[57:31] said these things have not been revealed
[57:32] to us by man
[57:34] and that's why so many people are
[57:35] they're still not revealed to them
[57:37] because it takes a revelation from God
[57:39] he said by God himself that's opened
[57:42] those seven Mysteries again I don't know
[57:45] how you get past this that's open to
[57:47] those seven Mysteries past tense of what
[57:50] the church was how it was in Christ at
[57:53] the beginning and how it would be
[57:55] revealed in the last days now there's a
[57:59] there's a Doctrine today that brother
[58:01] Branham was God's voice he was his human
[58:04] voice when he was speaking just like he
[58:06] would speak to you
[58:07] but then when he uh when a tape recorder
[58:10] was turned on as soon as the the switch
[58:12] was flipped he become God's voice
[58:15] that that was God's voice speaking so
[58:17] whatever he said then would be
[58:19] infallible now that would be all right
[58:21] except brother Branham didn't teach us
[58:23] that
[58:24] and we need to always remember that okay
[58:26] and and if he didn't teach us that we
[58:29] need to be careful now what they're
[58:32] teaching that but listen what brother
[58:33] Branham had to say about it if he
[58:35] approached the word now in this sermon
[58:36] he said now he said I want you to you to
[58:39] turn in your Bibles as we always believe
[58:42] that the word must come first of the
[58:44] reading of the word he said I always
[58:47] read that he said because it my words my
[58:51] words it's the word of a man it will
[58:52] fail but the word of God can never fail
[58:55] aren't you glad for a prophet that told
[58:57] us the truth
[59:00] now we can take that back to the
[59:01] scripture and something that I want to
[59:03] do as we go through this as we did with
[59:05] the breach I want to I want to although
[59:08] this won't take nearly as long but I
[59:09] want to go back and show you uh in the
[59:12] scripture some of these things that
[59:14] brother Branham references or alludes to
[59:16] but we want to actually pick up the
[59:18] scripture itself and and pull it out
[59:20] because we want you to know he's a word
[59:21] Prophet if he wasn't he couldn't be a
[59:24] prophet he wouldn't be the messenger to
[59:25] the age the fact that he's a messenger
[59:27] the age means it has to come from the
[59:29] Bible
[59:30] his authority was not to write a new
[59:34] Bible although he was a prophet a major
[59:36] prophet but that wasn't what God
[59:38] commissioned him to do he was
[59:40] commissioned to open this open the book
[59:42] and and show us what was there to shine
[59:45] a light on the scripture that was
[59:47] already written so it was not to write a
[59:49] new book so Matthew 24 35 said Heaven
[59:52] and Earth shall pass away but my word
[59:54] shall not pass away aren't you glad for
[59:55] that when the world's shaking and
[59:57] everything's going down and everything's
[59:59] turning loose and everything else we can
[1:00:02] look at it and say my words shall not
[1:00:04] pass away
[1:00:07] you know
[1:00:08] if you go and study I've been studying
[1:00:10] the book of Kings
[1:00:12] if you go and study in Elijah's Ministry
[1:00:14] you look at the things Elijah prophesied
[1:00:17] some of them didn't take place for years
[1:00:20] later
[1:00:22] and then it was taking place in a way
[1:00:24] that you wouldn't have suspected based
[1:00:26] on the prophecy itself
[1:00:29] because of the things that God told
[1:00:30] Elijah to do and he didn't even do it
[1:00:33] himself
[1:00:34] other men did it later on in another
[1:00:37] time in another place but the prophecy
[1:00:39] was still fulfilled
[1:00:41] and so we don't need to get discouraged
[1:00:43] about these things God sent a prophet in
[1:00:45] our day and and there's certain things
[1:00:46] that are spoke but we don't have to
[1:00:48] spend so much time worrying about what
[1:00:50] they are or how to place them but just
[1:00:53] let God fulfill his word it'll be
[1:00:54] fulfilled every word of God is fulfilled
[1:00:58] it does not fall to the ground void
[1:01:00] aren't you glad for that today that
[1:01:01] means that your life isn't void that
[1:01:03] it's not meaningless it means something
[1:01:08] so he said Heaven and Earth shall pass
[1:01:10] away but my word shall not pass away
[1:01:11] brother Branham goes on and I I skipped
[1:01:14] through some of this because it relates
[1:01:15] directly to Easter the day
[1:01:17] but he talks about the importance of
[1:01:19] Easter and how he should put it in its
[1:01:21] proper place and but he says this he
[1:01:24] said as people today are trying to say
[1:01:26] we should wash feet once a year on
[1:01:29] Thursday
[1:01:30] on Friday we should take the communion
[1:01:33] now we look at this in the message and I
[1:01:36] know there's churches that maybe
[1:01:37] somebody wouldn't go to a certain church
[1:01:39] because they don't take communion every
[1:01:40] month or some wouldn't go to a certain
[1:01:42] church because they did and
[1:01:44] and and there might be a difference over
[1:01:46] wind at washed feet and and so that's
[1:01:49] what brother Brown was talking about
[1:01:50] some people want to say once a year on
[1:01:52] Friday we should take the communion and
[1:01:54] they just think you're a real sinner if
[1:01:56] you don't take communion on Good Friday
[1:01:57] and some people have different doctrines
[1:02:00] that they've made up about that and but
[1:02:03] that's not the life
[1:02:04] that's not going to get you to heaven
[1:02:06] yeah
[1:02:07] yeah and that's brother Brown's point in
[1:02:09] this sermon he's saying he said some say
[1:02:11] we should wash feet once a year on
[1:02:13] Thursday on Friday we should take the
[1:02:15] communion we you know we get to decide
[1:02:17] that as a church body but that's not the
[1:02:19] life
[1:02:20] how many services we have on Sunday one
[1:02:23] or two or five
[1:02:25] brother Isaac's going to three right now
[1:02:27] I don't know why he's going to three
[1:02:28] services on Sunday but two's just not
[1:02:31] enough for him so he runs down to
[1:02:32] another place and must be some really
[1:02:34] good preachers down there and
[1:02:36] and uh has a third service on Sunday but
[1:02:39] but you know and there's maybe some
[1:02:42] other things driving him to do that but
[1:02:46] but that's not what it's about
[1:02:49] right that's not what it's about it's
[1:02:51] not about our doctrines of how many
[1:02:53] services we should have or when to wash
[1:02:56] feet or or those things that we're
[1:02:58] taught to do it
[1:03:00] right right but that's not what it's
[1:03:02] about he said they argue about whether
[1:03:03] it should be this day or that day or
[1:03:05] whether it should be a Sabbath day or
[1:03:07] the first day of the week he said all
[1:03:10] these things are just merely tradition
[1:03:13] he said what good would any of it do you
[1:03:16] whether you had lint or not lint if
[1:03:19] there's no life in you
[1:03:22] oh God you imagine I I used to work at
[1:03:25] Burger King I know we would always stock
[1:03:28] up on fish sandwiches for Lent because
[1:03:30] the people were still going to eat but
[1:03:32] they were going to give up red meat so
[1:03:33] here were the all the Catholics and the
[1:03:35] lutherans would come through on lent and
[1:03:37] they would order fish sandwiches at
[1:03:39] Burger King which was the worst fish
[1:03:41] sandwich in the business but that's
[1:03:43] beside the point but we would stock up a
[1:03:46] lint so we knew when lent was coming
[1:03:48] because they were going to come in and
[1:03:50] order fish sandwiches sometimes we
[1:03:51] didn't even carry them the rest of the
[1:03:52] year
[1:03:53] but you carry them around lint you'll
[1:03:55] see them advertising why people think
[1:03:57] they put their faith in that but that's
[1:03:59] not where we put our faith we don't put
[1:04:01] our faith in how many times we wash feed
[1:04:03] and how many times we go to church or
[1:04:06] any of that we put our faith in the life
[1:04:08] it's about the life
[1:04:11] yeah and that's why we can take an
[1:04:13] Easter sermon and preach it in September
[1:04:14] because it's not about the the tradition
[1:04:17] of it it's about the life
[1:04:21] he said if there's no life in you it's
[1:04:22] only a memorial yeah which there's
[1:04:25] nothing against it but they've certainly
[1:04:27] carried out their Traditions but left
[1:04:29] off the main thing
[1:04:31] oh that's not an indictment of people
[1:04:33] today and and I would say even as
[1:04:35] message people many times we carry out
[1:04:37] our Traditions to the letter but have we
[1:04:39] left off the main thing
[1:04:41] well I pray that we have and I pray that
[1:04:43] that we have Christ amen we have that
[1:04:46] life
[1:04:47] Satan listen this is a famous quote
[1:04:50] you've heard it before but I think now
[1:04:52] you'll see it maybe in the context of it
[1:04:54] he said Satan doesn't care
[1:04:57] how religious you are
[1:05:00] right
[1:05:01] or how right you are
[1:05:05] in your Doctrine
[1:05:09] right Doctrine is still the letter that
[1:05:12] kills
[1:05:14] yeah
[1:05:16] he wasn't talking about false Doctrine
[1:05:19] when he said the letter kills
[1:05:22] that's its job
[1:05:24] is to kill
[1:05:26] to make you feel guilty to make you
[1:05:29] aware of what's Happening that's the job
[1:05:32] that's the right Doctrine that's the job
[1:05:34] of it but that's not what we rely on but
[1:05:37] it's to life
[1:05:38] amen the letter kill us but the spirit
[1:05:40] brings life
[1:05:42] it's the life so the doctrine yes it has
[1:05:44] to be right but right Doctrine the devil
[1:05:46] don't even care about that how right you
[1:05:49] are in your Doctrine if you miss that
[1:05:51] life amen you won't come up anyhow
[1:05:54] right what good is a bunch of letters
[1:05:56] and you've got everything right and you
[1:05:58] studied and you your Theologian and you
[1:06:00] got everything just right but it won't
[1:06:02] get you out of a grave
[1:06:03] because every one of us is going down
[1:06:05] there one of these days if we don't go
[1:06:06] in a Rapture brother Danny we're going
[1:06:08] down in the ground yeah they're going to
[1:06:10] put us and throw dirt on top of our
[1:06:13] Graves every one of us
[1:06:15] none of us are exempt from that and none
[1:06:17] of us know when it'll happen either yeah
[1:06:19] none of us have any idea about that and
[1:06:21] so we live this life the best we can
[1:06:23] live it we live between the lines if
[1:06:25] you've ever looked at a tombstone
[1:06:27] there's a date here there's a date here
[1:06:28] this is when they were born this is when
[1:06:30] they were taken off the Earth but in
[1:06:32] between that that's what you live
[1:06:34] what was the life that's what he wants
[1:06:37] to know that's what he's concerned with
[1:06:39] yes
[1:06:39] yes what was the life
[1:06:41] what kind of a life do we live in the
[1:06:43] middle
[1:06:44] oh my
[1:06:46] he said no matter how religious how good
[1:06:49] how many churches you belong to or will
[1:06:52] belong to it doesn't matter one thing
[1:06:56] unless you have been born again
[1:06:58] yep do we see people today putting
[1:07:01] putting emphasis and making a Doctrine
[1:07:04] out of not just having church but when
[1:07:06] to have church
[1:07:07] or not just having a preacher but which
[1:07:09] preacher yeah
[1:07:11] that's not the life
[1:07:14] the life is not going to a certain
[1:07:16] church or hearing a certain preacher
[1:07:18] even a good message preacher you don't
[1:07:21] have life because you hear me preach
[1:07:23] many people have heard me preach and
[1:07:26] died and and not made it yeah
[1:07:29] that's just a sad reality of life
[1:07:32] yeah I've I've preached for 25 years of
[1:07:36] my life and I've preached to many people
[1:07:38] who probably never make it most people
[1:07:40] that Jesus preached to probably didn't
[1:07:42] make it
[1:07:44] but they didn't get the life but if you
[1:07:46] can get the life regardless of which
[1:07:49] preacher you hear regardless of what
[1:07:51] church you go to if you can get the life
[1:07:53] you want to feed on the word you'll want
[1:07:55] to go to church you'll want to live for
[1:07:57] God you'll want to stand for the message
[1:07:58] of the hour but it's not about the
[1:08:00] tokens and the I mean the the physical
[1:08:03] tokens of all that it's the token the
[1:08:05] life of Jesus Christ
[1:08:07] that's right
[1:08:10] now
[1:08:11] he said it doesn't matter one thing
[1:08:13] unless you've been born again
[1:08:14] therefore if God raised up Jesus from
[1:08:17] the dead
[1:08:18] did he raise him up for a memorial
[1:08:21] and is this Resurrection morning
[1:08:23] only one day in the year
[1:08:26] or a certain day that we celebrate this
[1:08:30] well it's Wednesday night for the band I
[1:08:31] can't get too excited
[1:08:36] but are we benefactors
[1:08:39] of his resurrection
[1:08:42] he said what does it mean to me I think
[1:08:46] that's a good question yeah
[1:08:48] yeah what does it mean to you he said
[1:08:51] now we believe by faith that he raised
[1:08:53] from the dead but what has that got to
[1:08:56] do with me he said that was 2 000 years
[1:08:58] ago if we're not careful these things
[1:09:01] become history
[1:09:03] and they become a good history lesson
[1:09:04] have become a tradition but the brown
[1:09:06] calls it a family tradition that when
[1:09:08] they would go and lay their hands on the
[1:09:10] Lamb on the head of the Lamb they were
[1:09:11] supposed to feel that there was supposed
[1:09:14] to be a feeling in it but he said they
[1:09:16] they lost the feeling of it and become a
[1:09:19] family tradition didn't mean anything to
[1:09:20] him and so they began to bring the Blind
[1:09:22] and the crippled and and all these
[1:09:24] lesser sacrifices to God there's got to
[1:09:27] be a life inside of us that makes us
[1:09:29] want to go to church for the right
[1:09:30] reasons makes us want to serve God for
[1:09:33] the right reasons makes us want to read
[1:09:35] our Bibles for the right reasons makes
[1:09:37] us hunger and thirst after the things of
[1:09:39] God
[1:09:40] oh my there's got to be a life yeah
[1:09:43] there's got to be something there
[1:09:46] and I would say again if you don't love
[1:09:48] the word
[1:09:49] you need to check up
[1:09:52] because entertainment will take it away
[1:09:54] from you
[1:09:56] the world will take it away from you
[1:09:59] it'll make you so uh the devil has a way
[1:10:02] of making your life so busy that your
[1:10:05] soul your mind is so clouded but it's
[1:10:07] this life that dispels the Gloom when
[1:10:09] you get a revelation of the life when
[1:10:11] you when you see it when you allow it to
[1:10:13] become your your focal point in your
[1:10:16] life that's when it dispels all those
[1:10:17] other things
[1:10:19] begins to melt away the fog and the
[1:10:21] things but the devil do everything he
[1:10:23] can I can't tell you all the things the
[1:10:25] devil has done over the past two days to
[1:10:27] try to cloud my mind so I couldn't
[1:10:29] preach to you on a Wednesday night
[1:10:31] just a tremendous amount of things that
[1:10:33] the devil's tried to do over one thing
[1:10:35] after another after another what is it
[1:10:37] it's the things of life that's the
[1:10:39] devil's job but it's our job to look
[1:10:41] past that look away from the things look
[1:10:44] away from the things that we can see
[1:10:45] look away from the temporal things look
[1:10:48] away from Hollywood look away from the
[1:10:49] things of the world look away from our
[1:10:51] jobs and say Lord I know you are the
[1:10:53] life
[1:10:55] huh
[1:11:01] I don't know why I'm dwelling on that
[1:11:02] today maybe it's because I've been
[1:11:03] through it I know what it's like
[1:11:06] as a preacher to get to where you're not
[1:11:08] hungry anymore
[1:11:10] you just don't
[1:11:12] you just don't want to there's something
[1:11:15] not anything there to really want to
[1:11:17] search for God you got to shake yourself
[1:11:19] out of that
[1:11:23] and the thing is it's because your diet
[1:11:25] has become too rich
[1:11:27] and the things of the world
[1:11:29] and you end up you you've gorged
[1:11:32] yourself and I'm not speaking to any one
[1:11:34] individual tonight like I said that's
[1:11:36] happened to me
[1:11:37] at times in my life you Gorge yourself
[1:11:40] on the things of the world not bad
[1:11:41] things just things
[1:11:44] and it doesn't mean anything to you
[1:11:46] anymore
[1:11:47] and you're not excited about it
[1:11:51] but what what does it mean to me
[1:11:54] what does it mean
[1:11:55] to you
[1:11:57] he said now we believe by faith that he
[1:11:59] raised from the dead but what has that
[1:12:01] got to do with me
[1:12:03] that was two thousand
[1:12:05] years ago
[1:12:07] so that was brother branham's
[1:12:09] introduction to this sermon it is the
[1:12:11] rising of the sun which actually the
[1:12:14] title is the quickening power it is the
[1:12:17] rising of the sun was his text
[1:12:20] and he goes back to the beginning of
[1:12:22] time it's always a good place to start a
[1:12:25] sermon because the possibilities are
[1:12:27] endless
[1:12:29] he goes back to the beginning of time
[1:12:31] but we used to joke that you knew when a
[1:12:33] preacher was going to be long-winded
[1:12:34] when he started in Genesis 1.
[1:12:37] well here we go Genesis 1 1 in the
[1:12:39] beginning
[1:12:40] God created the Heaven and the Earth
[1:12:43] and the Earth was without form and void
[1:12:46] and darkness was upon the face of the
[1:12:49] deep and the spirit of God moved upon
[1:12:51] the face
[1:12:53] of the waters and God said let there be
[1:12:56] light
[1:12:57] and there was light now brother Branham
[1:12:59] said now the son at the rising of the
[1:13:02] sun he said well there was a time when
[1:13:04] the world was laying in utter Darkness
[1:13:05] it was without form was void it was all
[1:13:08] covered with water was laying there in
[1:13:10] the dark dismal gloomy atmosphere
[1:13:15] he's talking about you and I
[1:13:18] and you'll watch as brother random
[1:13:20] parallels this he's not talking just
[1:13:21] about the world he's talking about you
[1:13:23] and I
[1:13:24] there was a time when we were laying in
[1:13:26] utter Darkness
[1:13:28] we were without form void who covered
[1:13:31] over with water we were laying in a dark
[1:13:33] get some gloomy atmosphere
[1:13:37] and the spirit of God moved upon that
[1:13:39] water
[1:13:40] and said let there be light
[1:13:43] now God had a reason to do that for down
[1:13:47] beneath that water
[1:13:48] I love this there was seeds that he had
[1:13:52] planted
[1:13:54] Hallelujah and it had to have that
[1:13:57] sunlight to make it live
[1:14:01] right and so the seed was there even in
[1:14:05] the darkness even in the Gloom even the
[1:14:08] fog and everything that was on it it
[1:14:10] couldn't it didn't it didn't manifest
[1:14:12] itself at all
[1:14:13] in fact when the random goes on later in
[1:14:15] the summer to talk about how it has to
[1:14:16] have rot it has to die completely it did
[1:14:19] not could not manifest itself in that
[1:14:21] current
[1:14:22] state yet that state was necessary to it
[1:14:25] but there come a time light had to cross
[1:14:27] its path
[1:14:29] so now he said let there be light
[1:14:32] he said and it had to have that sunlight
[1:14:34] to make you live and the first light was
[1:14:36] ever given in the Earth was God's spoken
[1:14:39] word
[1:14:40] the first light that ever struck the
[1:14:42] Earth was God's spoken word
[1:14:44] he said let there be light and there was
[1:14:47] light
[1:14:48] that turned Darkness into light
[1:14:51] he said in order to bring forth now
[1:14:53] watch a creation of joy
[1:14:57] he didn't do that to bring forth misery
[1:15:01] to bring forth death
[1:15:04] even though that's what we see now
[1:15:06] but that's not what his original
[1:15:08] creation was meant to be
[1:15:10] God did not create us to be miserable
[1:15:16] even after he gave adam Eve he still
[1:15:20] was not miserable
[1:15:23] right
[1:15:27] they they still were happy
[1:15:30] but it was after the fall that they
[1:15:32] become miserable
[1:15:33] he wanted to bring forth a creation of
[1:15:36] joy and life upon the Earth
[1:15:40] now again think about that as an
[1:15:42] individual that's what he's trying to do
[1:15:44] to us that's what the word of the hour
[1:15:46] does for us that's what the Holy Spirit
[1:15:48] does for us which by the way as we get
[1:15:51] into this we'll see you can't separate
[1:15:53] the two the spirit and the word always
[1:15:55] go together it's Christ Christ is the
[1:15:58] anointed word
[1:16:00] the word and the spirit together the
[1:16:02] word moving the spirit moving on the
[1:16:04] face of the waters and the word speaking
[1:16:06] let there be light
[1:16:07] and the spirit bringing the word to pass
[1:16:10] so it's always together it's never
[1:16:12] separate
[1:16:13] and so you have to have both and he said
[1:16:17] and so brother Branham really knocks
[1:16:19] this because and I know or some people
[1:16:21] will say well brother being all we need
[1:16:23] is the word all we need is the word you
[1:16:24] go into this sermon and begin to listen
[1:16:26] to it brother Branham knocks that and he
[1:16:28] begins to say you can't say word only
[1:16:30] yeah that's right you gotta have a life
[1:16:34] right there's got to be some reality to
[1:16:36] it at some point it's got to matter
[1:16:38] right
[1:16:39] right at some point all the knowledge
[1:16:41] you have about the Bible all the
[1:16:43] teaching that you've had all the things
[1:16:45] have got to matter yeah
[1:16:47] and when is it going to matter well when
[1:16:49] you're dealing with the mechanic
[1:16:51] when you're talking to the uh down at
[1:16:53] the grocery store when when you got
[1:16:56] church problems when you got marriage
[1:16:58] problems at some point the words got to
[1:17:00] matter right it's got a Michael itself
[1:17:03] manifest
[1:17:05] and that's why brother Branham when he's
[1:17:06] preaching in the token and we talked
[1:17:08] about it on Sunday but he said it's not
[1:17:09] enough just to believe yeah
[1:17:12] do you know he said that he said it's
[1:17:14] not enough to believe
[1:17:16] yeah you've got to have the token
[1:17:18] because anyone can say they believe he
[1:17:20] said but if you really believed
[1:17:23] you would manifest
[1:17:24] what you believed because the Life of
[1:17:27] Christ would be there to manifest it so
[1:17:29] this is manifesting time and brother
[1:17:31] Branham even talked about that in the
[1:17:33] token he said there's there was a time
[1:17:34] when you could put up the lamb and
[1:17:36] inspect it he said but not this hour
[1:17:39] this is manifesting time so if we were
[1:17:42] created to have joy guess what should be
[1:17:44] manifested in our life
[1:17:46] Joy oh God give it to me oh you say well
[1:17:50] how do you have joy well just let Christ
[1:17:52] manifest himself in your life
[1:17:55] many times we don't have joy because we
[1:17:57] steal it from ourselves
[1:18:01] we're going if we had a joy if Joy was a
[1:18:04] tangible object and you had it in a uh
[1:18:07] I'm preaching this without thinking
[1:18:08] about it first so I may need to be
[1:18:10] careful but if you had joy in a in a
[1:18:13] safe and it was a tangible object and
[1:18:15] you could put it there in the tangible
[1:18:16] object in in the safe and it was sitting
[1:18:19] there and you could uh you say well
[1:18:22] every night it's getting stolen every
[1:18:23] day it's getting stolen and so you're
[1:18:26] going to set a trap for the thief and
[1:18:27] you get out and and do all the stuff
[1:18:29] that it takes to catch him and you put a
[1:18:31] camera on it and one night you get a
[1:18:33] notification here it comes up you look
[1:18:35] at it it was you
[1:18:37] yeah
[1:18:39] you stole your own Joy
[1:18:41] how did you do it by letting things
[1:18:44] bother you
[1:18:46] by letting things come and get between
[1:18:48] you and the word
[1:18:51] because the word brings Joy the light
[1:18:53] bring brought Joy to the Earth it was
[1:18:56] created for that and so we many times we
[1:18:59] steal our own joy we steal our own
[1:19:01] happiness
[1:19:03] we just let God be God a lot of the joy
[1:19:06] would come back yeah just let him do
[1:19:08] what he does
[1:19:10] a lot of the atmosphere would change
[1:19:13] but see because we because we're falling
[1:19:16] and in this condition we we tend to go
[1:19:18] towards that depravity of losing joy and
[1:19:21] losing life but this word came to bring
[1:19:24] joy and to bring life upon the Earth he
[1:19:27] said then the spirit of God isn't moved
[1:19:29] with love and compassion I love that I
[1:19:31] love the way he says that the spirit of
[1:19:34] God moved with love and compassion in
[1:19:35] other places he said it brooded or it
[1:19:38] made love to the Earth
[1:19:40] right you're like a dove cooing and the
[1:19:44] word there is as a hen in Deuteronomy it
[1:19:47] says an eagle fluttereth stirth her nest
[1:19:49] flutereth over her young that word flood
[1:19:51] Earth is the same word diffused in
[1:19:53] Genesis where it says he Broods over the
[1:19:56] Earth
[1:19:57] he moves over the face what he like a
[1:20:00] like a hen or or a eagle sitting on a
[1:20:03] nest and moving to keep the eggs in just
[1:20:06] the right the optimal atmosphere
[1:20:09] oh God that's what he's doing in our
[1:20:11] lives today he's moving with love and
[1:20:13] compassion when we come to church on
[1:20:15] Wednesday night he's moving with love
[1:20:17] and compassion when we come on Sunday
[1:20:19] he's moving with love and compassion he
[1:20:22] said at that great day the first day of
[1:20:24] the dawn of creation upon the Earth the
[1:20:26] Sun Rose and slept across its rays and
[1:20:28] dried up the waters from the earth and
[1:20:30] made an atmosphere above
[1:20:33] and for its first time
[1:20:35] it was to bring joy and life to the
[1:20:37] Earth
[1:20:38] by a seed
[1:20:40] he said that was a great hour
[1:20:42] but oh it wasn't nothing
[1:20:44] that Sunrise like the sunrise on that
[1:20:47] Easter morning
[1:20:48] he said this time with the sun leaping
[1:20:51] into the skies it brought forth a
[1:20:53] greater Sunrise than ever because it
[1:20:55] came with greater news than this Sunrise
[1:20:57] than it did with the sunrise at the
[1:20:59] beginning
[1:21:00] he said this this Sunrise brought a news
[1:21:02] that he has risen he is quickened from
[1:21:04] the dead as he's promised he's risen
[1:21:06] from the dead
[1:21:08] he said the first time the sun rose in
[1:21:10] Genesis it was bringing forth a message
[1:21:11] that there will be life upon the Earth
[1:21:13] mortal life but this time when the sun
[1:21:15] rose there was a dual sun rising yeah he
[1:21:18] said sun rising it was not only s-u-n
[1:21:21] Rising it was the son had risen to bring
[1:21:25] eternal life to All God's promise seed
[1:21:27] by foreknowledge he had seen laying upon
[1:21:30] the Earth
[1:21:32] oh my
[1:21:33] no more could the botany life lived back
[1:21:35] there at the beginning without the issue
[1:21:37] and to bring it to life no more than
[1:21:39] today when sons of God is upon the Earth
[1:21:41] it takes the s-o-n light to bring them
[1:21:44] to eternal life his chosen ones that he
[1:21:47] knew before the foundation of the world
[1:21:49] he had chosen them in himself before the
[1:21:52] foundation of the world
[1:21:54] and on Easter morning then in this dirt
[1:21:57] somewhere
[1:21:59] oh my in this dirt somewhere laid our
[1:22:03] bodies at that time why because Adam
[1:22:06] come from the dirt
[1:22:08] God created him out of the Dust so all
[1:22:10] of us were in Adam
[1:22:12] so we came from the dust too yeah
[1:22:15] so everything that would be us
[1:22:16] everything oh my was laying there in the
[1:22:19] earth
[1:22:20] he said in this dirt somewhere laid our
[1:22:22] bodies at that time for we are the dust
[1:22:25] of the earth and In Heaven There was a
[1:22:28] book of memory
[1:22:29] no he's putting it like we can
[1:22:30] understand it
[1:22:32] yeah I don't know that there necessarily
[1:22:33] would say well there's a book here with
[1:22:35] a quill pin but it's like so we can
[1:22:37] understand that God has a a memory of it
[1:22:40] a book of memory
[1:22:42] and his attributes was in him
[1:22:45] knowing oh Hallelujah knowing that
[1:22:48] because the Son of God raised it would
[1:22:51] also Race To Life
[1:22:53] every son yeah someone say every son
[1:22:57] then what are we worried about
[1:22:59] right why do we stress why do we why do
[1:23:02] we uh spend so much time worrying about
[1:23:05] our loved ones and I know it gives us
[1:23:08] pause and makes us think and we should
[1:23:09] be desperate for Souls but but it ought
[1:23:12] to raise the desperation ought to come
[1:23:14] from love not because of worry
[1:23:16] because all that worry does is separate
[1:23:19] us from that life
[1:23:20] but that life will bring to life every
[1:23:23] son
[1:23:24] every son that was for ordained to this
[1:23:27] great time
[1:23:29] well where does he get that brother Ben
[1:23:31] is he just pulling that out of his own
[1:23:32] mind no he gets out from the scripture
[1:23:34] Romans 8 30 moreover whom he did
[1:23:36] predestinate then he also called whom he
[1:23:39] called then he also Justified whom he
[1:23:41] justified them he also glorified you're
[1:23:44] going to make it we've preached on that
[1:23:46] before you're going to make it you're
[1:23:47] going to be okay yeah why because let me
[1:23:51] call he justified those who he justified
[1:23:54] he glorified
[1:23:56] he knew it would be
[1:23:58] he said in what a more glorious sunrise
[1:24:01] that was than it was at the beginning at
[1:24:04] the time when it first dawned now he
[1:24:07] said on this great breaking of the
[1:24:08] Easter seal now he calls it an Easter
[1:24:10] seal and I think I've looked at this
[1:24:12] before with you but an Easter seal was a
[1:24:15] seal that you would put on a letter we
[1:24:17] don't send letters today but that's hard
[1:24:19] to apply to email Isn't it most of you
[1:24:21] probably don't even send email
[1:24:23] my daughter does she uses email at
[1:24:25] school and then emails me when she has a
[1:24:28] problem or something sometimes just to
[1:24:30] email me she'll send me an email but I
[1:24:33] like email it's what I used it works so
[1:24:34] if you want to email me that's fine but
[1:24:36] you can't put that on an email it was a
[1:24:38] physical seal that you're taking you put
[1:24:40] on the back of a letter and then some of
[1:24:42] you may remember doing that now don't
[1:24:44] age yourself but they would take a
[1:24:47] physical like a stamp put it on a letter
[1:24:49] and then when you open the letter you
[1:24:52] broke the seal
[1:24:54] right that's the Easter seal the ram
[1:24:57] talks about an Easter City talking about
[1:24:58] that physical thing he broke the letter
[1:25:00] but brother Brown told us he said there
[1:25:01] was a message on the inside of the seal
[1:25:03] yeah
[1:25:04] yeah oh my the the event of breaking the
[1:25:07] fields wasn't the main thing
[1:25:09] right the main thing was the message on
[1:25:10] the inside of the seal
[1:25:13] Oh Glory he said and now he said the
[1:25:15] true Easter seal on this Sunrise was
[1:25:18] broken and the secret of life after
[1:25:21] death was revealed
[1:25:24] how is God going to show us what life
[1:25:26] after death was
[1:25:27] in a person
[1:25:30] oh God how's he going to show us what a
[1:25:32] Rapture is in a people yes
[1:25:36] that's right we're going to see our
[1:25:38] loved ones
[1:25:40] and in a moment in the twinkling of an
[1:25:42] eye we shall be changed the Bible says
[1:25:45] we shall not all sleep but we shall all
[1:25:46] be changed in the moment and twinkling
[1:25:48] of an eye what what's it telling us that
[1:25:50] the seal will be broken
[1:25:52] off of life after death but how can we
[1:25:55] know that's going to happen because it's
[1:25:56] already happened
[1:25:58] right the Great Seal of life after death
[1:26:00] was broken
[1:26:01] on the resurrection morning
[1:26:04] right he said in the secret of life
[1:26:06] after death was revealed before that
[1:26:07] time we didn't know
[1:26:09] see God interprets his word by bringing
[1:26:11] it to pass
[1:26:13] so he says the world growth grouped in
[1:26:15] darkness groped around man's suspicion
[1:26:18] theories was among men's heart tradition
[1:26:20] made up
[1:26:21] that's the very thing that divided the
[1:26:23] Pharisees and the Sadducees was the
[1:26:25] resurrection
[1:26:26] some believed in it and some didn't but
[1:26:29] the Pharisees had no clue that the
[1:26:31] resurrection was a person
[1:26:33] because Jesus said I am the resurrection
[1:26:35] and the life
[1:26:36] amen because even even Martha she
[1:26:39] believed in the resurrection but Jesus
[1:26:41] said I don't just believe it I am the
[1:26:43] resurrection
[1:26:45] amen I believe we can say the same thing
[1:26:47] about the Rapture today
[1:26:49] I don't just believe in the Rapture I am
[1:26:51] the Rapture the Rapture can't leave
[1:26:53] without me brother Brown said everything
[1:26:55] you have need of to make it in a Rapture
[1:26:57] is already laying in you right now oh
[1:26:59] that ought to make us excited tonight
[1:27:00] you take a bunch of Pentecostals running
[1:27:02] around shouting about gifts that fell
[1:27:04] 120 years ago think about this the
[1:27:07] Rapture the coming event what's coming
[1:27:09] up that's not history that's something
[1:27:11] that's happening right now
[1:27:13] you're a part of that it's laying right
[1:27:16] inside of you if anything ought to make
[1:27:17] people excited it's sad yeah it feels
[1:27:20] broken
[1:27:22] Glory
[1:27:24] now he says they worship the son they
[1:27:26] worshiped all kinds of gods and all
[1:27:28] kinds of people that made claims they
[1:27:30] all went into the grave and they stayed
[1:27:31] in the grave but the real seal had been
[1:27:33] broken and one who once lived as we live
[1:27:37] died as we will die was risen from the
[1:27:40] dead what a morning
[1:27:41] and everyone liked it in all the history
[1:27:43] of the world the secret was made known
[1:27:45] that he was both resurrection and life
[1:27:49] John 14 19 says yet a little while in
[1:27:51] the world seeth be no more but you see
[1:27:53] me because I live you shall live also
[1:27:55] and he said when he come forth on that
[1:27:58] morning because I live you live also Not
[1:28:00] only was he the beneficiary of the
[1:28:02] Resurrection but all those seed
[1:28:05] someone say all
[1:28:07] oh that includes Me and You by the way
[1:28:10] if I understand the definition of a
[1:28:13] Double L it includes me and you because
[1:28:15] I lived you live also all those feet
[1:28:18] that was resting in God's Great promise
[1:28:21] was a benefactor of that Resurrection to
[1:28:23] life
[1:28:24] because he said because I live you shall
[1:28:27] live also that was the breaking of the
[1:28:30] seal
[1:28:31] Glory because he was brought up so will
[1:28:35] everyone that's in Christ
[1:28:37] be brought up with him
[1:28:39] oh my I'm going to skip past this but
[1:28:42] you can go write it down if you're if
[1:28:44] you're keeping notes so you want to come
[1:28:45] back to it first Corinthians 15 verses
[1:28:47] 16 through 22. we'll skip past it
[1:28:50] because I'm already out of time but if
[1:28:52] you want to go back to that Paul gives
[1:28:54] us a glorious glorious explanation of
[1:28:57] the resurrection and an argument for it
[1:29:00] that without the resurrection we're of
[1:29:01] all men most miserable but because the
[1:29:04] seal has been broken we can have joy
[1:29:06] when the sun came up it dispelled the
[1:29:09] gloom and when the sun comes up when you
[1:29:12] when you have a revelation that he has
[1:29:15] risen not that he was risen 2 000 years
[1:29:17] ago but he's risen by the Jason in your
[1:29:19] heart
[1:29:20] when you have that Revelation when you
[1:29:22] can't grab a hold of that then Joy comes
[1:29:24] in your life
[1:29:26] because no matter what happens There
[1:29:28] Ain't No Grave gonna hold my body down
[1:29:30] there ain't no tomb Gonna Keep Me From
[1:29:32] making it in a Rapture there ain't
[1:29:34] nothing why because he's already risen
[1:29:36] in my heart
[1:29:38] amen
[1:29:40] Hallelujah
[1:29:42] amen he said at this glorious Sunrise
[1:29:44] God had proven or Vindicated his word
[1:29:46] all the glooms and doubt that had moved
[1:29:49] in people's minds was taken away because
[1:29:51] here was he who once lived eat drink and
[1:29:54] fellowship with mankind that said I have
[1:29:56] power to lay my life down I have power
[1:29:58] to raise it up again and now not only
[1:30:00] had he made that statement but he proved
[1:30:02] it to be the truth oh what a glorious
[1:30:04] thing that is he said I'm sure this
[1:30:06] morning that even we who believe it
[1:30:08] cannot comprehend what a great thing
[1:30:10] that was because he raised from the dead
[1:30:12] we also have already
[1:30:15] someone say already
[1:30:17] I'm having you do that to wake you up we
[1:30:19] have already raised from the dead for we
[1:30:22] were in him
[1:30:24] Glory he said notice now is the Gloom
[1:30:26] covered the earth and the seeds could
[1:30:28] not live without the s-u-n to rise and
[1:30:31] Gloom had covered the Earth and now the
[1:30:33] son was risen all Gloom was vanished by
[1:30:37] this light
[1:30:38] as it spread across the Nations to the
[1:30:40] people he is not here but he has risen
[1:30:42] what a statement he had proved his word
[1:30:44] he had proved it to be true for he had
[1:30:46] now conquered death Hell In The Grave he
[1:30:49] proved it to be true when he rose again
[1:30:50] and he showed himself to his disciples
[1:30:52] but now after 2 000 years he's proven it
[1:30:56] true again what was the sign of the son
[1:30:58] of man the sign of the Resurrection
[1:31:01] he proved it to be true
[1:31:03] and he didn't just prove it 40 years ago
[1:31:06] or 50 years ago but he's proved it to be
[1:31:08] true in our lives
[1:31:10] amen
[1:31:11] that's why we're not hotbed plants we
[1:31:14] don't have to be babied and pampered
[1:31:16] we're Children of the Resurrection
[1:31:18] we don't go to church because somebody
[1:31:20] babyed us and made everything just right
[1:31:22] for us and said oh I love to be able to
[1:31:24] do that church I'd love to be able to
[1:31:25] have everything just the way you wanted
[1:31:27] it but I tell you what that's not why we
[1:31:29] come to the house of God that's not why
[1:31:31] we feed on the word we do it because we
[1:31:33] love God we're Children of the
[1:31:35] Resurrection
[1:31:36] we've raised from dead creeds
[1:31:41] proved it to be true
[1:31:45] now I
[1:31:46] if you let me just for a minute I want
[1:31:47] to dwell on that Gloom for just a minute
[1:31:49] now as we kind of move away from it is
[1:31:53] the rising of the Sun and I'm I'm over
[1:31:55] time
[1:31:57] but many times we feel that Gloom
[1:32:00] we live in it
[1:32:02] we deal with it
[1:32:04] and
[1:32:06] you know brother random taught us
[1:32:08] that someone telling us get next to
[1:32:10] yourself doesn't work
[1:32:12] you know he said that over and over
[1:32:14] again he said that you can't just tell
[1:32:17] somebody who genuinely has a Gloom in
[1:32:19] their life just get next to yourself
[1:32:23] because you get next to yourself you may
[1:32:24] see things you don't like
[1:32:27] yeah
[1:32:28] that don't work
[1:32:31] he taught us he said you need something
[1:32:33] to put your foot on
[1:32:35] something to melt away the Gloom
[1:32:37] I don't know what you're dealing with
[1:32:39] tonight but I know many times especially
[1:32:40] in these midweek services but you can
[1:32:42] feel it off of people you come in and
[1:32:44] and I'm not saying you tonight but just
[1:32:47] in general people will come in you feel
[1:32:48] Gloom
[1:32:49] you feel depression feel nervousness
[1:32:53] you feel stress and sometimes it's all
[1:32:55] here
[1:32:58] because it happens that's why God called
[1:33:00] human beings to preach to human beings
[1:33:03] right you come as a man not as an angel
[1:33:08] he called human beings to deal with
[1:33:10] human beings
[1:33:12] and so many times we deal with that
[1:33:14] and we need something to put our foot on
[1:33:17] something to melt away the Gloom brother
[1:33:19] random talks about to somebody a woman
[1:33:21] that comes up before him he said between
[1:33:23] you and I comes a dark shadow it's
[1:33:25] shaking and jumping and there's only one
[1:33:27] thing that can mean that that's a demon
[1:33:29] a demon of nervousness
[1:33:31] he says you think sometimes that you've
[1:33:33] lost your mind
[1:33:34] isn't that right but he's a liar
[1:33:37] I don't know how many times I stood here
[1:33:39] at the altar and reminded some of you
[1:33:40] and and stood where I've preached before
[1:33:42] and reminded the people the devil's a
[1:33:45] liar if the devil's telling you that
[1:33:47] guess what it's not true
[1:33:50] the best compliment you could get from
[1:33:52] the Devil is for him to say you're not
[1:33:53] going to make it you're not a Christian
[1:33:56] right because he's a liar yeah
[1:33:59] yeah but he said he's trying to get you
[1:34:01] down lady don't you pay no attention to
[1:34:02] that
[1:34:03] he said Do you believe me to be a
[1:34:05] servant look he said let me tell you
[1:34:06] something you've tried so long to even
[1:34:08] get one place
[1:34:09] you thought if you could just like put
[1:34:11] your foot you could start from there
[1:34:12] it's that right I'm not reading your
[1:34:14] mind but you was praying about that
[1:34:16] so that's right you said many times in
[1:34:18] your thoughts in there if I could just
[1:34:19] get one place to start from and many
[1:34:22] times in our lives that happens we this
[1:34:23] happens many times brother Branham said
[1:34:25] when he preached even back then he said
[1:34:27] 90 of the audience I dare say today is
[1:34:30] probably a hundred percent yeah people
[1:34:32] deal with nervousness anxiety
[1:34:35] and he said back then it was 80 to 90 of
[1:34:37] the audience that dealt with that
[1:34:39] and so he said if I could just get one
[1:34:42] place to start from he said this is your
[1:34:45] starting place
[1:34:46] right here
[1:34:49] where could you start from
[1:34:51] now watch the Earth had to have a
[1:34:53] starting place
[1:34:54] it was without form and void we don't
[1:34:56] know how long brother Brown said God in
[1:34:58] the beginning God created the heavens
[1:34:59] and earth period
[1:35:01] well that's an eye-opener isn't it
[1:35:03] we don't know what happens
[1:35:06] until he began it said it begins to say
[1:35:09] the Earth was without without form and
[1:35:10] void but the brown calls it the seeds of
[1:35:12] a pre-existing civilization I don't even
[1:35:14] know what that means
[1:35:17] I really don't but there's all kinds of
[1:35:20] things laying there
[1:35:22] but the random he taught us those were
[1:35:24] seeds that God had planted
[1:35:26] that we're laying there and so but it
[1:35:29] was gloomy it had to have a point to
[1:35:31] start from where was the starting point
[1:35:32] listen to me tonight the starting point
[1:35:35] is always the word
[1:35:38] and the Holy Spirit goes to work on the
[1:35:41] word
[1:35:43] the starting point
[1:35:45] is always the word
[1:35:49] let there be light
[1:35:51] again he said look this way lady what
[1:35:53] are you scared of you got a nervous
[1:35:54] condition that's been bothering you for
[1:35:55] a long time you believe God can heal
[1:35:56] that nervousness he said 90 of this
[1:35:59] audience is vibrating with the same
[1:36:00] thing right now
[1:36:01] he said that's exactly right see he said
[1:36:03] you want a place to put your foot always
[1:36:04] he said they they all tell you get next
[1:36:06] to yourself and believe this and that
[1:36:08] but you've got to have a starting place
[1:36:10] you're on it right now
[1:36:13] he said believe it well you're the word
[1:36:15] of God says you're free
[1:36:18] could we grab a hold of that today can
[1:36:21] we hear that like the seed that was
[1:36:23] there under the muck under the mire but
[1:36:26] when the sun the warmth of the sun when
[1:36:28] he said let there be light in the sun
[1:36:29] because that ball of ice or whatever
[1:36:32] that was there and God it warmed up
[1:36:34] solely and when it come to life and it
[1:36:36] began to shine down on the Earth all the
[1:36:38] seeds that were down there in the Frozen
[1:36:40] cold dark muck of the water all the
[1:36:43] seeds that were there began to warm up
[1:36:45] and gradually they begin to break open
[1:36:47] and they begin to express what they were
[1:36:51] from the beginning oh God what was it
[1:36:54] the light that did it there's got to be
[1:36:56] a starting place there is a starting
[1:36:58] place it's this word are you tired are
[1:37:01] you weary are you anxious go back to the
[1:37:03] word put your foot down on it find out
[1:37:06] what the Bible says find out what a
[1:37:08] prophet had to say
[1:37:09] you're having a hard time to say well I
[1:37:11] I can't it just seems like sickness
[1:37:13] after sickness after sickness put your
[1:37:15] foot down on the word yes the devil's
[1:37:17] going to do that to you but he said I'm
[1:37:19] the god that heals all your diseases
[1:37:21] financial trouble whatever it is put
[1:37:23] your foot down on the word
[1:37:26] this is your starting place the word of
[1:37:28] God
[1:37:29] so the word of God says you're free you
[1:37:31] believe it let me believe it tonight
[1:37:34] all right he said go be free of that
[1:37:36] thing
[1:37:37] brother Branham wasn't quoting himself
[1:37:40] when he said you're free
[1:37:42] it's quoting the word
[1:37:44] the word of God says you're free he
[1:37:46] didn't have to have a vision for that
[1:37:48] right brother Brown taught us he said
[1:37:50] when I go I say go and be healed he said
[1:37:52] I'm not saying that because because I
[1:37:54] have any power to heal them he said I'm
[1:37:56] saying what the word says
[1:37:58] that's right
[1:38:00] where can you put your foot down put it
[1:38:02] down here Revelation 117 he spoke about
[1:38:05] the one who came you remember his his
[1:38:08] hair was white like wool who was it
[1:38:10] who was it that he saw the same Christ
[1:38:13] that we saw on this age
[1:38:15] the same God that's here today in word
[1:38:18] form but he saw him John saw him there
[1:38:20] in the form of a judge and he describes
[1:38:23] him and he said when I saw him I fell at
[1:38:25] his feet as dead
[1:38:27] overcome overwhelm with nervousness with
[1:38:30] anxiety with fear
[1:38:32] and he laid his right hand upon me
[1:38:34] singing to me fear not I am the
[1:38:36] beginning and the end
[1:38:39] what a statement I am the first and the
[1:38:43] last I am the Alpha and the Omega
[1:38:49] he
[1:38:50] that liveth
[1:38:52] and was dead
[1:38:55] you think about that statement brother
[1:38:57] man you don't know what I've dealt with
[1:38:58] this week
[1:39:00] deal with this
[1:39:03] let go of that for a minute and deal
[1:39:05] with this scripture in your mind I am he
[1:39:08] that liveth and was dead we either
[1:39:09] believe that or we don't
[1:39:11] and if he's alive it's enough
[1:39:16] if he's alive he calls me his child yes
[1:39:19] if he is alive I am his redeemed if he
[1:39:22] is alive I am the Beloved I'm accepted
[1:39:24] in the Beloved if he's alive his word is
[1:39:27] true amen he proved it true he broke the
[1:39:29] seals off of the scriptures
[1:39:32] hey man
[1:39:34] he said I'm he that liveth and was dead
[1:39:36] behold I'm Alive forevermore hey he said
[1:39:39] that I have the keys
[1:39:44] he'd preach a whole sermon on that one
[1:39:47] but this is one of the scriptures that
[1:39:48] brother Brandon read as he began this
[1:39:50] sermon he said I have I have keys
[1:39:53] walking around there and John he's
[1:39:55] scared he said don't be scared John and
[1:39:57] he just takes him keys and begins to
[1:39:58] shake him hey look
[1:40:00] look John I got the keys you ever see
[1:40:04] anybody a janitor at a school or
[1:40:06] somebody that walked around with keys
[1:40:08] all over their pocket brother Bailey's
[1:40:10] probably got that on his pocket right
[1:40:11] now you got a key you got keys hanging
[1:40:13] on your pocket and hang on a chain when
[1:40:15] the janitor walks up and down the hall
[1:40:16] an important person used to mean that
[1:40:18] you were important
[1:40:19] now they tell me now that if you have no
[1:40:21] keys at all that's the most important
[1:40:23] person
[1:40:24] other people open doors for them
[1:40:26] but that meant you were important you
[1:40:27] could open doors
[1:40:29] said don't be afraid I have keys I don't
[1:40:32] just have keys I have specific keys
[1:40:36] the ones to hell and death what are you
[1:40:38] afraid of
[1:40:40] yeah hey man I have the keys
[1:40:43] of hell and death
[1:40:45] I have the keys of hell and of death I
[1:40:48] am the beginning in the end
[1:40:50] hey man brother Brandon man I'm closing
[1:40:53] with this musicians go ahead and come he
[1:40:54] said away with Satan in his Gloom and up
[1:40:57] with faith in the Lord Jesus Christ the
[1:40:59] faith of almighty God faith can take its
[1:41:02] holy stand on the Rock of Ages and
[1:41:03] Pierce an Eagle Eye through every storm
[1:41:05] cloud when the very waves of death and
[1:41:07] disappointments trying to wash its
[1:41:09] foundation out from under it you don't
[1:41:10] think the devil don't try that with me
[1:41:13] every time we come to a Wednesday night
[1:41:15] and the crowd's a little bit thin the
[1:41:16] devil tries to bring them waves of Gloom
[1:41:18] and disappointment every time you come
[1:41:20] to the house of God the devil tries to
[1:41:22] do it to you too every time you go to
[1:41:24] work the devil tries to do it every time
[1:41:26] you you have a situation at home the
[1:41:28] devil tries to do it but don't be afraid
[1:41:30] John
[1:41:31] I have the keys of death and of hell
[1:41:35] amen and he got them keys not for
[1:41:37] himself he's already been there

[1:41:50] says here you go Peter Peter knew
[1:41:52] exactly what to do with it walked on the
[1:41:53] day at Pentecost and opened the door
