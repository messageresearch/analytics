[48:56] verses 25 and 26
[49:00] i want to continue talking about who is
[49:02] worthy but just take a little
[49:04] maybe completely different uh approach
[49:07] to it and
[49:08] speak this morning a worthy widow
[49:11] [Music]
[49:12] luke chapter 4 and verse 25. remember
[49:14] we'll have brother ivy with us next
[49:16] sunday morning so we're looking forward
[49:18] to that
[49:19] speaking for us next sunday morning luke
[49:21] 4 25
[49:23] but i tell you of a truth many widows
[49:26] were in israel in the days of elias when
[49:29] the heaven was shut up
[49:30] three years and six months and great
[49:33] famine was throughout all the land
[49:36] until none of them was elias said save
[49:38] unto sraptor the city of sidon
[49:40] to a woman that was a widow
[49:45] we didn't send elijah to just anybody
[49:48] aren't you glad he was sent to you
[49:50] amen pray the lord his blessing to the
[49:52] word may be seated
[49:59] it must have been almost daylight
[50:05] when the little woman turned her weary
[50:08] head on pillow
[50:11] she's been tossing and turning all night
[50:14] she heard a mournful little cry across
[50:17] the room there's something different
[50:18] about the cry of a child who's really
[50:19] hurt
[50:22] in distress his child was hungry
[50:27] and she'd not been able to sleep because
[50:30] she was so worried
[50:32] a little boy woke up every 20-30 minutes
[50:35] through the night
[50:37] and you can hear his little voice say
[50:40] mama
[50:41] i want you to go out and look in the
[50:42] pantry again
[50:44] see if there's just one little piece of
[50:46] bread
[50:47] i'm so hungry i can't sleep
[50:51] she looked at those face with his cheek
[50:53] sinking in
[50:54] his eyes turning yellow his hair hanging
[50:57] down
[50:57] from failing to be cut a little ragged
[51:00] night shirt on tears rolling down
[51:04] down his face and she patted him on the
[51:06] cheek and said try to sleep
[51:09] try to understand
[51:12] there have been three years with no rain
[51:15] you know no matter how bad we have it
[51:17] somebody somebody always has it worse
[51:22] three years they've been without rain
[51:24] and she knelt down on the floor
[51:28] she began to cry out to god
[51:31] she said oh god i've done my best to
[51:33] live true
[51:34] and to be right
[51:37] here i am i see my little boy crying for
[51:39] something to eat i've got nothing to
[51:41] give him
[51:42] for many weeks now we've been just
[51:44] allowing ourselves a cup full of meal or
[51:48] just a spoonful of oil every three or
[51:50] four days
[51:52] trying to hold it off until daylight
[51:55] you will not have to die during the
[51:58] night
[52:00] we don't see that kind of devastation
[52:02] much anymore in our country
[52:04] we're so blessed caleb we're so blessed
[52:06] that our children can be born at the
[52:07] country that they
[52:08] are we may have difficulties but
[52:12] the last time i dedicated a baby was in
[52:14] west africa
[52:16] in lomi togo and
[52:19] i held a little baby in my arms like
[52:21] little baby henry
[52:23] only had a cleft flip and there's
[52:26] not any doctors to speak of in that town
[52:29] they have one hospital it's a city of a
[52:31] million people they call it the morgue
[52:34] because you go there to die and
[52:37] he had a cleft lip but i'll never forget
[52:39] that and it always struck me because
[52:42] my thought was you know if the lord
[52:44] doesn't heal
[52:45] then he'll just be his whole life like
[52:47] that and so it makes you pray earnestly
[52:49] for healing
[52:50] because of that but this is the kind of
[52:53] situation that the little woman was in
[52:55] it was life or death
[52:57] and so she began to pray that that kind
[53:00] of a situation will make you pray
[53:03] and the thing that i noticed about being
[53:05] in that kind of despair and among those
[53:07] kind of people is that they
[53:09] they knew how to pray
[53:12] they knew how to reach out to god right
[53:15] and a pastor john baduca told me his
[53:18] church
[53:19] several hundred people and he told me he
[53:21] said on wednesday nights he said
[53:23] sometimes they'll have prayer night and
[53:24] i said well
[53:25] how does that how does that work for you
[53:27] guys he said well we
[53:28] we pray he said i'll pray and i'll say
[53:31] now we're going to pray
[53:32] for the brothers in america and this is
[53:34] the way they do now we're going to pray
[53:36] for the brothers in america
[53:37] they'll pray not for five minutes or ten
[53:40] minutes but the congregation will pray
[53:41] as a congregation for now
[53:44] and then they'll say well we'll pray for
[53:45] healing for this one and they'll pray
[53:48] they'll pray they'll pray
[53:49] four five six hours at a time because
[53:52] they've got no answers anywhere else
[53:55] there's no way to get help
[53:57] any other way and i got to experience
[54:00] that and
[54:01] this kind of a desperation sets in and i
[54:04] think sometimes
[54:05] god allows these things to happen in our
[54:07] life i know that he allows these things
[54:09] to happen in our lives so that
[54:10] we get in that kind of desperation he
[54:13] wants to hear his children
[54:14] cry out too we need to cry out to god
[54:19] every moment of our lives but many times
[54:21] we don't do it until we get
[54:22] in a desperate situation
[54:25] this woman would hit the desk where they
[54:27] cry out
[54:28] she said i've lived true my husband was
[54:31] lost in battle for the lord and i've
[54:33] been a widow for many years and
[54:35] tried to live right keep your
[54:36] commandments and it's my time to go i
[54:39] don't mind but my little boy
[54:40] just tears my heart the pieces to here
[54:43] and begged for something to eat
[54:45] with nothing to give him she got
[54:47] finished praying she
[54:49] she raised up and he'd come back to
[54:51] sleep again for a few minutes
[54:54] she had her arms up and the little
[54:56] ragged night count she was wearing was
[54:58] just about gone she goes to the window
[55:00] and looks out and just about to break
[55:01] day
[55:02] it was so hot not only naturally but the
[55:05] hot winds of judgment was blowing on a
[55:07] nation and forgotten god
[55:10] and when that happens the innocents
[55:11] suffer with the guilty
[55:14] it's not just the guilty that suffer but
[55:16] the innocent suffer as well
[55:18] and so when a nation rejects god it
[55:21] affects everybody
[55:23] it affects us
[55:27] how did this nation of israel get in
[55:29] that place
[55:30] brother branham explains that elijah in
[55:32] the meal offering he said that was
[55:33] during the reign of ahab
[55:35] israel's most cruel and wicked king and
[55:37] he had married a sinner
[55:39] jezebel who was an idolater the mixed
[55:41] wedding like that is never successful
[55:44] it just can't be that the woman will
[55:45] come the man's way or the man will go
[55:47] the woman so even though the scripture
[55:48] says not to be unequally yoked
[55:52] and he said that this woman that they
[55:54] have married jezebel she was a very
[55:55] attractive little woman and ahab was
[55:57] kind of a lukewarm believer and he said
[56:01] he did give in to her ideas and said oh
[56:03] well religion is nothing for me i'm a
[56:06] king
[56:07] as long as they tore down the altars of
[56:09] god
[56:10] and put up the altars of baal
[56:14] the cry had been so much against the
[56:15] true religion to the ministers he said
[56:17] under that great strain
[56:19] given away i believe there's a great
[56:22] strain on the ministry again today
[56:24] great strain not only on denominational
[56:27] ministry but on us
[56:28] to try to get us to back away from the
[56:30] word
[56:32] but the word is still true god's word is
[56:34] it still works
[56:36] and the word of god is like this that if
[56:38] god speaks something in his word and
[56:40] he says something it's a law of god it's
[56:43] a word it's something that's
[56:44] true it's not just true because well i
[56:47] get the opportunity to follow it i'll
[56:48] follow but if not i want
[56:50] won't know it works because it's true
[56:52] just like the law of gravity is
[56:54] true if i pick this book up and drop it
[56:55] it's going to drop
[56:57] it's going to fall because there's a law
[56:58] that says it's going to fall
[57:00] and and there's a law that says certain
[57:02] things have to be a certain way and
[57:04] that's god that's just the way things
[57:06] work that's the way he made us
[57:08] so if we as a country don't follow that
[57:10] if we as the church will follow that we
[57:12] we get into the pressure of the day then
[57:15] what happens is we bear
[57:17] the ramifications of that there's
[57:18] results that come from not following god
[57:22] so brother brandon says so long had the
[57:26] ministers
[57:26] fell under the impact of the king
[57:29] because sin was permitted
[57:31] there was no limits he said it's a very
[57:34] good picture of today
[57:36] because the nation had endorsed these
[57:38] things
[57:40] that's the age that we're living in
[57:41] today when the nation endorses sin
[57:44] he said the people wanted to be popular
[57:46] they thought as long as the nation said
[57:48] so it was all right
[57:49] that's the way they say today as long as
[57:51] the nation says it's all right to sell
[57:53] beer but it's all right to drink it
[57:55] if the nation permits our women to have
[57:57] dressed on the street the law won't run
[57:58] in why it's all right to do it
[58:00] it might be all right to the nation but
[58:01] in god's great books
[58:03] you're responsible and we'll have to
[58:05] answer before god
[58:07] he said but they had fallen and given
[58:08] away under the load
[58:11] now and this joel is something that
[58:14] we've got to remember
[58:15] that as time goes on the separation
[58:17] between the world and the bible is going
[58:20] to get farther and farther
[58:23] until finally it's going to get to a
[58:24] place where it's going to be hard just
[58:26] to just to live and do your business and
[58:28] things because
[58:30] because just trying to live godly in
[58:32] this world is going to be so difficult
[58:33] but remember it was that way in that
[58:35] first church age
[58:37] when they had those the roman system had
[58:39] taken over everything that was ungodly
[58:41] and they mandated that you worship their
[58:43] gods but still christianity stood
[58:46] that early church stood why because they
[58:49] served a god that was able to keep them
[58:52] amen
[58:52] and we serve a god that's able to keep
[58:54] us until that day
[58:55] when we leave here so we don't have to
[58:58] give in to those things but
[59:00] there was one who was still
[59:02] old-fashioned he said to believe that
[59:04] there was a god that was old-fashioned
[59:07] believe that there was a god that kept
[59:09] his word do we believe that this morning
[59:11] is there somebody here that believes
[59:12] that god keeps his breath
[59:14] he believes that there's a an
[59:16] old-fashioned god a god
[59:18] who's the same yesterday today and
[59:19] forever
[59:21] believed that the god of abraham isaac
[59:22] and jacob was holy and required
[59:24] complete surrender to his holiness he
[59:27] said but jezebel and her modernist
[59:29] crew hated him he was their pastor but
[59:31] they didn't believe it so he had to hide
[59:34] for his life for schemes
[59:38] 17 let's look at it in the scripture for
[59:40] a moment now we've
[59:41] we've set the background here's this
[59:43] woman this woman this gentile woman that
[59:47] jesus said elijah could have went to
[59:49] many widows there were many widows there
[59:52] many people suffering the same things by
[59:54] the day that she was suffering
[59:56] but there was one that was sent a
[59:58] prophet
[1:00:00] amen and in first kings 1701
[1:00:04] if you have your bibles with you or you
[1:00:05] can read on the screen it says elijah
[1:00:07] the tishbite
[1:00:08] was of the inhabitants of gilead said
[1:00:10] unto ahab
[1:00:12] the lord god of israel liveth before
[1:00:13] whom i stand there shall not be due
[1:00:16] nor rain these years but according to my
[1:00:19] word
[1:00:20] he was certain of god wasn't it he was
[1:00:23] confident that what he said was going to
[1:00:25] come to pass
[1:00:27] the word of the lord came unto him
[1:00:28] saying get the hints
[1:00:30] turn the eastward and hide thyself for
[1:00:32] the brook cherith
[1:00:34] that is before jordan and it shall be
[1:00:36] that thou shalt drink of the brook
[1:00:38] and i have commanded the ravens to feed
[1:00:41] thee there
[1:00:42] so he went and did according to the word
[1:00:44] of the lord for he went and dwelt by the
[1:00:45] book sheriff
[1:00:47] that is before jordan the ravens brought
[1:00:49] him bread and flesh in the morning
[1:00:52] bread and flesh in the evening and he
[1:00:54] drank of the brook
[1:00:56] now i got all kinds of questions there
[1:01:00] you know how did the ravens get the
[1:01:02] flesh was it cooked it must have been he
[1:01:04] didn't die from it
[1:01:07] how did they cook it you know what kind
[1:01:10] of ovens did they set up
[1:01:12] and brother tells us that elijah didn't
[1:01:14] ask any of these questions he just
[1:01:15] believed god
[1:01:17] somehow a sandwich bread and meat showed
[1:01:20] up every day
[1:01:22] a sandwich they brought a sandwich in
[1:01:24] the morning and a sandwich in the
[1:01:26] evening
[1:01:27] and he drank the water and he was
[1:01:28] content right
[1:01:31] what was it but the relative elijah had
[1:01:32] a secret place
[1:01:34] provided by god himself don't you know
[1:01:37] god's still a proprietor of that secret
[1:01:38] place
[1:01:40] he had a secret place provided by god
[1:01:42] himself he said now the church never
[1:01:44] provided it for him
[1:01:45] the king never provided him for it he
[1:01:47] didn't provide it himself
[1:01:49] but god provided a secret place for
[1:01:52] elijah to be fed amen
[1:01:54] all the time during the drought where
[1:01:56] his food was provided day by day don't
[1:01:58] you know
[1:01:59] god's big enough to provide a church
[1:02:00] where you can go and hear the gospel
[1:02:02] preach
[1:02:03] god's big enough to provide a place for
[1:02:05] you to go god's big enough to provide
[1:02:07] a place in a community we may be a
[1:02:09] secret place but god will provide it
[1:02:11] and more than that he has a place for
[1:02:12] you in christ
[1:02:14] the secret place for you in christ that
[1:02:16] you can go and you can
[1:02:18] he'll carry your burdens he said he said
[1:02:20] come unto me all you that are weary and
[1:02:22] heavy laden then i will give you rest
[1:02:23] aren't you glad you serve a god like
[1:02:25] that
[1:02:27] amen so he says his food was provided
[1:02:30] day by day
[1:02:31] he didn't need to wonder what's going to
[1:02:33] happen tomorrow or wonder if the supply
[1:02:36] run out
[1:02:36] we spend way too much much time worrying
[1:02:38] about the bill about what's going to
[1:02:39] happen
[1:02:40] yeah and i know those those of you who
[1:02:43] are dependent on that and maybe farming
[1:02:45] or different things you're dependent on
[1:02:46] the weather
[1:02:47] you don't know what's going to happen
[1:02:48] tomorrow but elijah didn't have to worry
[1:02:50] about it
[1:02:51] because he had it he knew if the supply
[1:02:53] was would run out god would provide
[1:02:55] something better
[1:02:57] you see that's the way god is with our
[1:02:59] lives and someone told me
[1:03:01] a wise man told me a long time ago he
[1:03:03] said no he said don't ever give up what
[1:03:05] you have for something less
[1:03:07] he said but for something better god
[1:03:09] always provides something better
[1:03:12] he said but but if it's something where
[1:03:13] you have to give it up for something
[1:03:15] that seems
[1:03:16] less it'll be better
[1:03:19] because god will provide a way oh and
[1:03:23] i've seen that happen in my life and
[1:03:24] some of you
[1:03:25] can say maybe you used to have a home
[1:03:27] that was different and you moved into a
[1:03:28] home that seemed like less but
[1:03:30] it was better god had a better place
[1:03:32] provided for you
[1:03:33] you had a job there was a certain way
[1:03:35] and you thought well if i lose that job
[1:03:37] what do i do
[1:03:38] but all of a sudden you found a place
[1:03:39] where you could you could go to church
[1:03:41] you can do the things that god will
[1:03:42] provide away
[1:03:44] if we'll trust him and it'll be
[1:03:47] something better it won't be something
[1:03:49] worse
[1:03:50] and when i say worse i don't need so
[1:03:52] much although i believe god cares about
[1:03:54] our finances and things but it'll be
[1:03:55] something where we can serve him
[1:03:58] where we have the capacity to serve him
[1:04:00] in
[1:04:01] whatever way that we are now brother ram
[1:04:04] says
[1:04:04] he didn't have to wander the supply
[1:04:06] right now god said i've commanded the
[1:04:07] ravens
[1:04:08] i'd like to have heard that conversation
[1:04:10] too because we think about commanding
[1:04:13] the ravens as being god spoke to the
[1:04:15] ravens and
[1:04:16] how what language did he speak how did
[1:04:18] how did he do that where they could
[1:04:19] understand him
[1:04:20] and he commanded the ravens but see it's
[1:04:22] more than that
[1:04:24] god commands listen we'll get more into
[1:04:27] this later
[1:04:28] god commands by the details of our lives
[1:04:32] and we talked about it last week how the
[1:04:34] jacob come up a certain way
[1:04:36] and god commanded jacob's life
[1:04:39] not to make jacob a good person but to
[1:04:42] bring him to a place of repentance
[1:04:44] and so he had to go through all of these
[1:04:47] problems in his life
[1:04:48] he had to come the way that he did with
[1:04:50] the personality that he had
[1:04:51] and the character and everything else
[1:04:53] because god had commanded him to be a
[1:04:55] prince
[1:04:57] and jacob didn't even know it and god
[1:04:59] commanded the ravens how did he do it we
[1:05:00] don't know
[1:05:02] we don't know exactly how he did it they
[1:05:03] may have just somehow something in their
[1:05:06] instinct just caused them to do that
[1:05:08] at a certain time maybe it's the only
[1:05:09] time in history they ever did it
[1:05:11] but they did it then why did they do it
[1:05:13] then god commanded it
[1:05:16] god's big enough to command for you a
[1:05:18] job god speaking that to command for
[1:05:21] your place
[1:05:22] god's big enough to command for you a
[1:05:24] family and the things that you have meet
[1:05:26] up
[1:05:26] that's right so
[1:05:29] brother benefit he said what a wonderful
[1:05:32] thing
[1:05:32] a type of our secret place
[1:05:36] in christ amen
[1:05:39] [Music]
[1:05:40] but first kings 17 7 tells us that after
[1:05:42] a while
[1:05:44] the brook dried up because there had
[1:05:47] been no rain
[1:05:49] and so to elijah it must have felt like
[1:05:51] the revival was over
[1:05:53] the revival ended but there's a purpose
[1:05:56] whenever the brook dries up
[1:05:58] there's a purpose that god has he wants
[1:06:00] you to move
[1:06:02] right and i don't mean move from one
[1:06:04] place to the other though that may be
[1:06:06] part of it but he wants you to move he
[1:06:07] wants to
[1:06:08] make you unsettled like the eagle that
[1:06:10] takes their little eaglets and pulls out
[1:06:12] the little things that
[1:06:13] uh the feathers and the things she's put
[1:06:15] in there in the rabbit for to make them
[1:06:16] an unsettled enough where they'll be
[1:06:18] able to
[1:06:19] walk around and want to get out of the
[1:06:21] nest see
[1:06:22] where they'll be able to fly and so he
[1:06:25] makes them unsettled
[1:06:26] and many times god does that for us he
[1:06:28] he pulls out those things he dries up
[1:06:30] the spring
[1:06:31] so that we can be unsettled so elijah
[1:06:33] would begin praying and looking
[1:06:34] lord what do you want me to do next
[1:06:38] i've seen god do that in my life when
[1:06:40] one thing drives up and you begin to
[1:06:42] look around and say go well what's next
[1:06:44] what
[1:06:44] what should i be doing and then god
[1:06:46] shows you that open door now
[1:06:49] as i said god didn't end it without
[1:06:51] replacing it
[1:06:53] because elijah was fine there by himself
[1:06:58] but he couldn't be a help to the widow
[1:07:01] right he was fine out in the wilderness
[1:07:03] he was doing good
[1:07:05] but it wasn't no help to the widow
[1:07:08] [Music]
[1:07:09] but the winner was suffered for a while
[1:07:12] not realizing that god had commanded her
[1:07:14] life
[1:07:15] that she would become the sustainer of
[1:07:18] elijah and his message
[1:07:20] she would become the one that kept him
[1:07:22] alive
[1:07:24] amen by her word and by the word that
[1:07:27] you believe now
[1:07:30] so in first king 17 8 says the word of
[1:07:31] the lord came unto him saying
[1:07:34] this is after the brook dried up the
[1:07:35] word of the lord came unto him and said
[1:07:37] arise get thee to zero path
[1:07:38] which belongs to the sidon dwell there
[1:07:40] there behold i have commanded a widow
[1:07:43] woman there
[1:07:44] to sustain thee
[1:07:49] she said she's praying all night long
[1:07:52] she'd been praying
[1:07:55] and she cried out to thought she doesn't
[1:07:57] know what's coming
[1:08:01] but while she's still praying god has
[1:08:04] already spoke to elijah and said
[1:08:06] i want you there's a widow and i
[1:08:09] commanded her
[1:08:11] and he didn't come and speak to her she
[1:08:14] didn't know
[1:08:14] but how did he command her by causing
[1:08:17] the circumstances of her life
[1:08:20] to be such right
[1:08:23] to put her in a certain place i hope
[1:08:26] you're hearing me this morning
[1:08:28] so that the circumstances of her life
[1:08:30] would cause her to be at a certain gate
[1:08:36] maybe before someone else would have
[1:08:38] gathered the sticks maybe in the good
[1:08:40] times
[1:08:40] she wouldn't have had to been out there
[1:08:42] by herself with her son at home
[1:08:44] maybe she wouldn't have had to have done
[1:08:45] that but god commanded it so that she
[1:08:47] would have to be working that day
[1:08:50] she would have to be out there gathering
[1:08:52] the sticks but maybe it wasn't the
[1:08:53] proper thing for
[1:08:54] her to be doing but she was out there
[1:08:56] anyway god commanded her life so that
[1:08:59] she would be
[1:09:00] at the right place at the right time to
[1:09:02] hear the word of god
[1:09:04] and so her life would be in the right
[1:09:06] position where she would have nothing
[1:09:07] left to lose
[1:09:09] and she would receive the word of god
[1:09:12] yes amen
[1:09:16] how many times have we been in that same
[1:09:19] situation ourselves
[1:09:21] where our life finally got in that
[1:09:23] position where we had nothing left to
[1:09:25] lose
[1:09:27] say god i'm depending on you i can't do
[1:09:30] this on my own
[1:09:32] i can remember early in my
[1:09:35] preaching ministry praying for a man who
[1:09:38] i baptized and just recently started
[1:09:40] coming to church
[1:09:41] and i was praying for him with his
[1:09:44] mother
[1:09:44] he was probably in his 40s but he was
[1:09:47] his mama's baby
[1:09:48] and i was praying for him there was
[1:09:50] planes at the hospital and i
[1:09:52] and i remember being so frustrated
[1:09:54] because i thought lord if your prophet
[1:09:55] was here
[1:09:56] then he would come off of that
[1:09:58] ventilator and the things that they had
[1:09:59] him on
[1:10:00] and he died not long after that but i've
[1:10:04] realized since then that
[1:10:05] it's not up to me it's god it was time
[1:10:09] and you look back at that and think god
[1:10:10] allowed him to come to church and be
[1:10:12] baptized and become a christian
[1:10:13] so he can take him home
[1:10:17] and you begin to realize that god
[1:10:19] commands our lives for certain seasons
[1:10:21] and certain times and
[1:10:22] it makes you so desperate that you're
[1:10:24] willing to give your life to god
[1:10:33] that this woman you can go back and
[1:10:36] listen to elijah in the meal offering or
[1:10:38] be certain of god
[1:10:40] you'll find bill random talking about
[1:10:41] how the woman had been praying and
[1:10:43] confessing her sins
[1:10:45] she was making sure she had met all of
[1:10:48] god's requirements
[1:10:51] and the bible tells us that if we
[1:10:52] confess our sins he is faithful and just
[1:10:56] to forgive us our sins if we confess our
[1:11:00] sins he is faithful
[1:11:01] and just to forgive us our sins
[1:11:04] but if we're unwilling to let go of all
[1:11:06] of that i'm going to surrender all of
[1:11:08] that
[1:11:09] then there's no promise of forgiveness
[1:11:12] until we were willing to confess
[1:11:16] now she had met god's requirements
[1:11:20] and she knew it you can be right with
[1:11:23] god
[1:11:24] we live in a world where the church
[1:11:26] wants to make it where
[1:11:28] you just you know you always have to
[1:11:30] live in a place where well god forgives
[1:11:32] you god forgives you but
[1:11:33] you can live right with god and yes you
[1:11:36] will make mistakes but
[1:11:38] you'll make it right you'll be quick to
[1:11:41] repent you don't have to live
[1:11:43] in despair you don't have to live in sin
[1:11:47] you don't have to live under addiction
[1:11:49] yeah
[1:11:50] there's nothing that says we have to
[1:11:52] live there but our god is able to
[1:11:54] deliver us from those things
[1:11:56] he's able to cleanse us from all
[1:11:58] unrighteousness if we confess
[1:12:00] our sins this little woman had met god's
[1:12:03] requirements that she knew it
[1:12:05] i think the old song says do you know
[1:12:06] how it feels
[1:12:08] to know when you lay your head on your
[1:12:10] pillow at night
[1:12:11] that everything's done that is you're
[1:12:14] forgiven amen
[1:12:17] i i know how that feels i don't always
[1:12:19] feel that way
[1:12:20] but i know how it feels i've been there
[1:12:23] and i can go back there
[1:12:24] are you with me now if i mess up if i do
[1:12:27] something i know
[1:12:28] what it's like to have prayed all the
[1:12:30] way through i know what it's like to
[1:12:31] know
[1:12:32] that my students are forgiven i know
[1:12:34] what it's like to know
[1:12:35] that god has come down and clears me and
[1:12:38] touched me and filled me with the holy
[1:12:39] spirit and so i can always go back there
[1:12:41] it's still there he said he'll never
[1:12:43] leave me he'll never forsake me
[1:12:46] if i mess up i know how it feels to have
[1:12:49] met god's requirements
[1:12:51] listen god during this time was silent
[1:12:57] brother brother said this little woman
[1:12:58] knew that she had met all those
[1:12:59] requirements and still god was silent
[1:13:01] seemed like he didn't even care for her
[1:13:03] he didn't care whether she lived or died
[1:13:06] all the time god was working
[1:13:11] don't take god's silence as being that
[1:13:13] god is not working god
[1:13:15] is so great that he can move silently
[1:13:18] we're going to talk about that loaded
[1:13:19] wagon that can move without making a
[1:13:21] noise
[1:13:22] we make noise and i believe we shouldn't
[1:13:23] make noise but it's because
[1:13:25] we've only got so much we can do a baby
[1:13:27] is helpless so it makes noise to try to
[1:13:29] get out of the
[1:13:30] situation that's it here let you know
[1:13:31] something's wrong many times we make
[1:13:33] noise to god
[1:13:34] because we make a situation we're in a
[1:13:36] situation we can't control
[1:13:38] and so we make noise or maybe there's
[1:13:40] such a blessing on us that we can't
[1:13:41] control we we shout whatever that it is
[1:13:43] that's wonderful
[1:13:44] but god is so great he don't he can move
[1:13:46] for you and not even have to make any
[1:13:47] noise
[1:13:50] but just a still small voice
[1:13:55] she didn't know that all the time god
[1:13:59] was working
[1:14:01] she didn't know about it but god told
[1:14:03] elijah
[1:14:04] he dried up the brook reached out his
[1:14:06] hand and stopped the brook from running
[1:14:09] elijah said lord why did he stop
[1:14:13] he said i've commanded a widow woman to
[1:14:15] feed you
[1:14:17] he had already commanded her but she
[1:14:19] didn't know it
[1:14:21] listen to this that's it
[1:14:25] [Music]
[1:14:26] just
[1:14:27] [Music]
[1:14:33] they had a rough day yesterday with the
[1:14:35] chromovirus
[1:14:36] and as i was texting back and forth with
[1:14:39] him i'd come across this while i was
[1:14:40] studying
[1:14:41] i sent it to him he said this he's
[1:14:44] because i told him i said tomorrow is
[1:14:45] going to be a better day
[1:14:47] you may not realize it but tomorrow's
[1:14:48] going to be a better day and i've been
[1:14:49] through that i know what that feels like
[1:14:51] that you feel like it's just hopeless
[1:14:52] and the next day you wake up and it's
[1:14:53] all gone
[1:14:55] and and then tomorrow is a better day
[1:14:58] and so
[1:14:59] brother brandon says this he said he
[1:15:01] might have commanded
[1:15:02] of you a testimony of your healing
[1:15:06] you might not know it but just hang on
[1:15:12] he said when you are sure that you met
[1:15:14] all the requirements
[1:15:16] when you know that you've done
[1:15:18] everything that you know to do
[1:15:20] and laid yourself before god you've been
[1:15:22] there
[1:15:23] you've done everything that you know to
[1:15:25] do you've laid yourself before god
[1:15:27] there's only one thing to do is hang on
[1:15:29] to his promise
[1:15:31] are you hearing me today church when
[1:15:32] you've done everything you know to do
[1:15:34] and it's not about knowledge it's not
[1:15:35] about how much you know
[1:15:36] but when you've done everything you do
[1:15:38] know when you come under god's
[1:15:40] requirement say lord i've done
[1:15:41] everything i never do
[1:15:42] help me lord hang on
[1:15:45] be certain of god hang on because
[1:15:48] he said stay there he said god promised
[1:15:51] to answer
[1:15:52] said he'll do it he said you don't know
[1:15:56] what he's commanded you don't know
[1:16:00] what he's commanded what angel or what
[1:16:03] to do
[1:16:06] you may find yourself in a in a hard
[1:16:09] situation in your life
[1:16:10] god commanded a church service for you
[1:16:13] [Music]
[1:16:15] and somebody to say the right thing
[1:16:18] for you to receive your healing from
[1:16:20] your situation
[1:16:22] god may have commanded somebody at your
[1:16:23] work to already give you a raise and you
[1:16:26] don't know it
[1:16:30] he may have commanded i remember one
[1:16:31] time i was needing a new job and
[1:16:34] my job wasn't paying very well and then
[1:16:36] the boss was a little prickly and i was
[1:16:37] needing a new job
[1:16:39] and i was looking kind of for a job but
[1:16:41] not not real hard
[1:16:43] and i never had to look long god always
[1:16:45] provided for me but i don't have any
[1:16:47] education i
[1:16:48] wasn't i had never graduated high school
[1:16:50] never graduated college
[1:16:52] i was able to read and kind of enjoy
[1:16:53] work for an attorney
[1:16:55] and and for a while i worked for a
[1:16:57] company that wasn't very good
[1:16:59] and i remember thinking you'll provide
[1:17:01] you said you would provide
[1:17:03] i'm not doing very well but you said you
[1:17:05] would provide it
[1:17:06] and you know how your email there's some
[1:17:08] emails that go to your email
[1:17:10] and there's some go to your spam folder
[1:17:13] and i went one day and i'm going to
[1:17:15] delete that and and i clicked over there
[1:17:17] and i just began to read
[1:17:19] it was a job offer in my spam folder
[1:17:22] that had been there for weeks that would
[1:17:24] double my pay
[1:17:28] god had already commanded someone
[1:17:32] to step up and for my need to be met and
[1:17:34] i just didn't know it yet
[1:17:38] sometimes i think we just need to start
[1:17:39] looking through for god to
[1:17:41] fulfill his word looking through our
[1:17:43] spam folders and you can put it like
[1:17:44] that
[1:17:45] begin to look to the places that are
[1:17:47] unexpected look at places where
[1:17:49] you just expect to find trash and then
[1:17:51] you see god working a miracle for you
[1:17:54] looking in the unexpected places and
[1:17:56] that's the way god promised to answer
[1:17:58] this woman he said he'll do it
[1:18:00] you don't know what he's commanded what
[1:18:02] angel or what to do
[1:18:03] he said it made me this night before the
[1:18:05] healing service first they were having a
[1:18:06] healing service the next night
[1:18:08] he said god might have seen your
[1:18:09] condition today
[1:18:11] he might have heard your prayers
[1:18:15] you don't know what god has commanded
[1:18:17] for tomorrow hold on
[1:18:19] don't give up don't give up on that
[1:18:21] person don't give up on that church
[1:18:23] don't give up on those people
[1:18:24] you don't
[1:18:31] you see everything in the woman's life
[1:18:34] up to this time was preparing her for
[1:18:37] one thing
[1:18:38] [Music]
[1:18:49] you say well i knew that i already did
[1:18:51] yes you did i did too but just
[1:18:54] think about it run that through your
[1:18:57] brain
[1:18:58] right think about it what god has done
[1:19:02] to bring you in your whole life maybe
[1:19:04] you've had trouble and you've had
[1:19:05] struggles and everything else and he
[1:19:07] brought you to a gate
[1:19:10] brought you to a certain place maybe how
[1:19:13] cause you'd be born in a certain family
[1:19:15] and here you're you're out there
[1:19:17] gathering sticks
[1:19:19] all you know is christ and him crucified
[1:19:21] but that's enough
[1:19:23] amen you realize that jesus died for
[1:19:26] your sins you're out there gathering
[1:19:27] those two sticks across
[1:19:30] he's leaning on the gate can you bring
[1:19:33] me a drink of water
[1:19:39] she didn't know why her life had been so
[1:19:42] difficult
[1:19:44] something about her life caused her
[1:19:46] friend to cry out
[1:19:48] for a supernatural god
[1:19:53] there's something about the christian i
[1:19:55] know already that i've been
[1:19:57] you know you go through things and
[1:19:58] sometimes we get and we've been working
[1:20:00] on fixing up things around the church
[1:20:01] and trying to fix up everything that we
[1:20:03] can
[1:20:04] and as we're working on all these things
[1:20:06] sometimes you get you know to a point
[1:20:07] where
[1:20:08] you feel like well we're doing all this
[1:20:09] but but really lord what we need
[1:20:12] is a supernatural god amen
[1:20:17] we're doing all these things we want to
[1:20:18] make sure that it's right we want our
[1:20:19] church to be as beautiful as it can be
[1:20:21] we want we want everybody to be in their
[1:20:23] place and the services to run just as
[1:20:25] smoothly as we can
[1:20:26] but more than anything all right we need
[1:20:29] a supernatural god amen
[1:20:32] we just got to step in and do it in the
[1:20:34] way that he does it and it don't have to
[1:20:36] be something big
[1:20:38] but it can just be in this simple way to
[1:20:40] step in with addiction to our midst
[1:20:42] and begin to take care of the situations
[1:20:44] of our lives
[1:20:46] begin to make healing where we can't
[1:20:49] make it
[1:20:50] begin to make us prosper where we can't
[1:20:52] make ourselves prosper begin to make us
[1:20:54] come to a place where we have that
[1:20:57] communion with him
[1:21:00] she didn't know why her life had been so
[1:21:02] difficult but she was about to find out
[1:21:05] you see god had already commanded elijah
[1:21:09] and she didn't realize she was commanded
[1:21:11] to
[1:21:12] i like
[1:21:14] [Music]
[1:21:19] she could have read this just right to
[1:21:21] herself couldn't she
[1:21:25] oh she had that word to
[1:21:31] [Music]
[1:21:37] you were the one that was crying out for
[1:21:39] your children you were the one
[1:21:40] praying all
[1:21:47] emphasis on the elijah but elijah put
[1:21:49] the emphasis on
[1:21:50] you he did
[1:21:53] elijah put them says go go help me a
[1:21:55] bride
[1:21:57] abraham's servant we don't even we're
[1:21:58] not even told his name in that place
[1:22:00] we know he was eliezer from another
[1:22:02] place but in that place we don't even
[1:22:03] even know his name but he said go hunt
[1:22:04] me and ride
[1:22:05] yeah what was it the impsis was on the
[1:22:08] right behold i will send you
[1:22:10] the light to the prophet yes amen
[1:22:13] before the coming of the great and
[1:22:15] gentle day of the lord
[1:22:17] he shall turn the heart of the fathers
[1:22:18] to the children and the heart of the
[1:22:20] children to their fathers that's our day
[1:22:22] lest with the curse
[1:22:27] all of our life has been in preparation
[1:22:29] to hear that voice
[1:22:35] woman bring me a drink
[1:22:38] amen and that was the woman at the well
[1:22:43] you just forgive me i just feel the
[1:22:44] presence of the lord so real this
[1:22:46] morning
[1:22:47] to you here's the woman at the well
[1:22:51] and all her life it's been trouble she's
[1:22:53] had five husbands and the ones
[1:22:54] she's living with that's not her without
[1:22:56] hers she goes to the well at the off
[1:22:59] time of day
[1:23:00] because nobody wants to be around her
[1:23:02] and she gets to the wild not realizing
[1:23:04] all of her life it's been preparation
[1:23:09] to hear that voice woman
[1:23:12] bring me a drink
[1:23:16] what was it it wasn't elijah was christ
[1:23:18] and elijah speaking to a tie for the
[1:23:19] gentile bride
[1:23:21] bring me a drink
[1:23:25] amen and from that time on we become a
[1:23:27] servant to god under the message of the
[1:23:29] hour
[1:23:32] and that's our focus that's what we
[1:23:34] purpose for that is our life
[1:23:36] my life i want my children to understand
[1:23:38] that sometimes we get away from this
[1:23:40] that our our purpose of being here we
[1:23:43] are so
[1:23:44] limited he doesn't call everybody to be
[1:23:47] where we are
[1:23:48] and so our purpose of being here is to
[1:23:50] spread this message
[1:23:51] to to make sure that this message is not
[1:23:53] my message
[1:23:54] but the message that comes from god and
[1:23:58] come through elijah
[1:23:59] and comes over the pulpit here but that
[1:24:02] same message that message that we have
[1:24:05] is so dear to us that's our life that's
[1:24:07] what we're trying to do is spread it
[1:24:10] we want to get it out that's our life
[1:24:12] see what was she doing she hadn't
[1:24:14] sustained
[1:24:15] and god has called you to do that in
[1:24:16] some way and it may be just paying your
[1:24:18] tithes it may be just going to church
[1:24:19] and maybe just
[1:24:20] but being a part of the body of christ
[1:24:22] don't ever forget that you're not
[1:24:23] sustaining a preacher
[1:24:26] you're not sustaining a church you're
[1:24:28] sustaining elijah's message
[1:24:33] because you're not going to find it
[1:24:34] preached down at any other church
[1:24:36] around in most neighborhoods you're not
[1:24:38] going to find it around here maybe
[1:24:39] you'll find a little bit more but you're
[1:24:40] not going to find it in most places
[1:24:42] where it's preached all over the place
[1:24:43] for what you're going to find
[1:24:44] you're going to have to find you have to
[1:24:46] seek it out but somehow god will get it
[1:24:48] to that predestinated seed
[1:24:51] we're responsible to get elijah's
[1:24:54] message
[1:24:55] to that predestinated
[1:24:58] notice all of her life was preparation
[1:25:00] to receive a message all of his life
[1:25:02] was a preparation to give a message so
[1:25:05] you find brother brandon talking about
[1:25:07] situations like when he was a boy
[1:25:10] and he says don't ever smoke or drink or
[1:25:13] to follow your body in any way
[1:25:14] i've got to work for you to do when you
[1:25:16] get old older what was god doing
[1:25:17] protecting the message
[1:25:19] and i told you last week i wasn't so
[1:25:21] much deceived because the seed in you
[1:25:23] will bring you to a place of repentance
[1:25:26] and for some people that means going
[1:25:27] into the depths of sin
[1:25:29] god was protected so that you can
[1:25:31] realize you're a sinner
[1:25:32] but god was protecting the message
[1:25:35] god was protecting the message amen and
[1:25:38] so now
[1:25:40] all of his life was a preparation
[1:25:41] because there was a message coming
[1:25:43] and brother random says speaks to that
[1:25:45] message when he's in order once at the
[1:25:47] end time he said notice
[1:25:48] the very day when this messenger not
[1:25:49] when he starts on
[1:25:51] but when he begins to declare his
[1:25:53] message he said see the first paul
[1:25:55] healing second paul prophesied
[1:25:57] third paul the opening of the word the
[1:25:58] mystery is revealed
[1:26:00] what was it was preparation during these
[1:26:02] years to bring him to the message
[1:26:05] what is it he said and he said there's
[1:26:08] no more there's no more high order to
[1:26:10] reveal the word than prophets
[1:26:12] but the only way the prophet can be
[1:26:13] vindicated is by the word
[1:26:16] he said and remember the third poll was
[1:26:17] the opening of them seven seals
[1:26:19] to reveal the hidden truth that's been
[1:26:20] spilled in the word
[1:26:22] he said well that's above my head well
[1:26:23] just hang on
[1:26:25] hold on elijah's message is coming
[1:26:29] has come to tell you what how to
[1:26:32] understand these things and it's not
[1:26:33] something
[1:26:33] that's out here that's just where all
[1:26:35] you it's always out of your reach no
[1:26:37] mysteries have been revealed
[1:26:41] all of church history has been a
[1:26:42] preparation for this hour
[1:26:44] we believe that listen
[1:26:47] brother says in the the church in this
[1:26:49] state has received the token of the
[1:26:50] baptism of the holy spirit that the
[1:26:52] blood has been shed the holy ghost is
[1:26:53] upon the church without us then
[1:26:55] they cannot race
[1:26:59] that's why the end time bright can't
[1:27:00] fall
[1:27:02] i don't mean the individuals that
[1:27:04] associate with the bride or even
[1:27:06] even are in the bride can't fall and be
[1:27:08] restored even
[1:27:10] but the bride will not fail their
[1:27:12] purpose
[1:27:14] [Music]
[1:27:15] they will not fall away from the truth
[1:27:17] of the message of the allies
[1:27:19] they may not be many in number but they
[1:27:22] will not fall
[1:27:24] because the types already been given
[1:27:25] there was brides that failed
[1:27:27] but this bride would not fall why
[1:27:29] because they're depending on us
[1:27:33] because luther didn't have all but
[1:27:34] wesley didn't have all of it but there
[1:27:36] would be a bride
[1:27:37] who cannot fall amen
[1:27:41] brother brother says this he said
[1:27:42] they're depending on us
[1:27:44] for god promised he would have it and
[1:27:46] somebody is going to be there
[1:27:49] then who should i be i should be
[1:27:50] somebody right
[1:27:54] look at somebody say i'm somebody
[1:27:58] you are you're somebody somebody that
[1:28:01] can hear
[1:28:03] somebody that's going to be there
[1:28:07] he said i don't know who it's going to
[1:28:09] be but somebody is going to receive
[1:28:13] he it the only one thing i'm responsible
[1:28:15] is to preach it
[1:28:17] it's god's business to look out for that
[1:28:19] predestined to see
[1:28:21] but he said there is going to be there
[1:28:23] though
[1:28:24] what confidence that gives us the
[1:28:26] stewardess minister said
[1:28:28] we can know there's going to be there
[1:28:30] someone's going to be there
[1:28:32] because they're going to be there he
[1:28:34] said each one of them one with the other
[1:28:35] the water heads the blood engine now the
[1:28:37] token age of the holy ghost
[1:28:39] he said remember israel come through
[1:28:41] many things but it was evening time when
[1:28:42] the token was required not in the
[1:28:44] morning not on the preparation the
[1:28:45] fourteen days of the keeping up with the
[1:28:47] lamb
[1:28:47] israel knew something was coming so did
[1:28:49] luther know it so did west you know it
[1:28:51] so did finnick knocks calvin noah this
[1:28:53] is it they knew
[1:28:54] there would come a time that the pillar
[1:28:56] of fire would return back to the church
[1:28:58] they knew there would come a time these
[1:28:59] days would happen but they didn't leave
[1:29:01] live to see it but they looked forward
[1:29:03] to it what was it there's a time of
[1:29:04] preparation but this is token time
[1:29:09] so we've been commanded by god ordained
[1:29:13] to be the beneficiaries
[1:29:15] of elijah's message that's where he did
[1:29:17] first kings 17 and 10.
[1:29:20] so he arose and went to xeropath
[1:29:24] when he come to the gate of the city
[1:29:26] behold when a woman was staying
[1:29:30] how did she happen to be there god
[1:29:31] commanded
[1:29:35] god allowed her to run out of wood that
[1:29:37] morning
[1:29:42] you think god doesn't know what's going
[1:29:43] on in your life
[1:29:45] god allowed her to run out of firewood
[1:29:48] that morning
[1:29:58] at a certain time so that she could pick
[1:30:01] up those sticks
[1:30:03] and she was gathering his sticks and he
[1:30:05] called her and said fetch me
[1:30:07] i pray a little water in a vessel
[1:30:12] i may drink woman because jesus said
[1:30:14] bring me a drink
[1:30:18] and she was going to fetch it i love
[1:30:20] that it doesn't she doesn't turn around
[1:30:22] she doesn't stop
[1:30:23] you know how scarce water was after no
[1:30:26] rain for three years
[1:30:29] think about that think of the longest
[1:30:30] drought you've ever experienced and it's
[1:30:32] probably nothing like that
[1:30:34] and see the thing was in israel the
[1:30:36] rains were seasonal anyway
[1:30:38] and in that country that part of the
[1:30:39] world the rains are seasonal so if you
[1:30:41] miss that window of rain you're not
[1:30:42] gonna get any more
[1:30:44] for the rest of the year so you can
[1:30:46] imagine the hopelessness of that maybe
[1:30:47] the rain season had just passed
[1:30:49] because elijah had his brook and they
[1:30:51] didn't get much rain anyway because of
[1:30:53] the drought and then all of a sudden
[1:30:54] the creeks are dry elijah's at her gate
[1:30:58] she says bring me a drink there's not
[1:31:00] much water left
[1:31:03] but there's something about her
[1:31:04] character
[1:31:06] she turns to go get it
[1:31:11] see we underestimate the value of
[1:31:13] obedience in our lives
[1:31:17] you want to do something good for your
[1:31:19] family obey the word
[1:31:22] you want people to know that you're a
[1:31:23] christian obey the word and i don't mean
[1:31:26] obey me i don't mean obey what i say i
[1:31:27] mean obey
[1:31:28] this
[1:31:33] obey the word obedience to the word will
[1:31:36] entitle you even to the token mother
[1:31:38] said so here she goes to fetch it
[1:31:42] and he called to her and said bring me i
[1:31:45] pray thee
[1:31:46] a morsel of bread in the night of hands
[1:31:48] so she's walking away
[1:31:50] this little tired weary woman she said
[1:31:53] i'll do something nice for this man he
[1:31:54] seems like a kind man
[1:31:56] she begins to walk away as she's walking
[1:31:59] away from the gate
[1:32:00] she hears that voice again and it's
[1:32:03] going to call her to make a complete
[1:32:05] surrender
[1:32:09] it's going to bring her to a place where
[1:32:10] she has to make a complete
[1:32:12] and total surrender
[1:32:16] bring me a piece of bread
[1:32:20] a bread required meal bread required
[1:32:25] oil she said that's the lord thy god
[1:32:29] living
[1:32:30] i'm not trying to hold on
[1:32:34] but i have not a cake i don't have
[1:32:36] anything
[1:32:38] all i've got is a handful a meal and a
[1:32:40] barrel
[1:32:41] and a little oil and a cruise
[1:32:45] behold i'm gathering two sticks
[1:32:48] that i may go ahead and address it for
[1:32:50] me and my son
[1:32:53] that we may eat it and die
[1:32:57] i love elijah's message see elijah's
[1:33:00] message many times come to us and
[1:33:02] first we hear it and we think oh i can i
[1:33:04] can i can do that
[1:33:05] i can surrender like that and then we go
[1:33:07] a little farther and he requires a
[1:33:08] deeper walk
[1:33:10] and then we begin to begin to wonder can
[1:33:12] i do it am i going to be able to do it
[1:33:14] and then we begin to hear the promises
[1:33:16] of god fear not
[1:33:21] you're not going to have to do it on
[1:33:22] your own well she didn't realize that
[1:33:25] she wasn't going to have to give it on
[1:33:26] her own
[1:33:27] but if she would give the last morsel of
[1:33:29] bread if she would give the last
[1:33:31] little bit of all the cruise that god
[1:33:33] would would actually provide for her and
[1:33:35] it would
[1:33:36] never fail listen
[1:33:39] he said the the thus saith the lord god
[1:33:42] well let's go back verse thirteen elijah
[1:33:44] said here fear not
[1:33:45] go and do as i said but make me there
[1:33:48] have a little cake first
[1:33:51] go make you again make me a cake first
[1:33:55] bring it unto me and after make for thee
[1:33:58] and for thy son
[1:33:59] here's the promise for thus said the
[1:34:01] lord god of israel the burial of meals
[1:34:03] shall not waste
[1:34:04] neither shall the cruise of oil fail
[1:34:06] until the day that the lord sendeth rain
[1:34:09] upon the earth
[1:34:10] and she went and did according to the
[1:34:11] saying of elijah and she and her house
[1:34:13] didn't eat many days
[1:34:15] oh if we could just understand that god
[1:34:17] says there will be enough to last until
[1:34:19] the end
[1:34:20] it'll never give out until the end every
[1:34:22] day she came in that handful of meals
[1:34:24] still there
[1:34:25] that cruciful of oil was still there we
[1:34:27] don't know how it happened but it was
[1:34:28] always there
[1:34:32] why was she willing to do this
[1:34:36] he said what does this have to do with
[1:34:37] being worthy
[1:34:41] why was she willing to do it because she
[1:34:42] was worthy
[1:34:44] to receive elijah's message
[1:34:48] she did it because she was of the same
[1:34:49] caliber as the prophet
[1:34:53] now hang with me for a moment but
[1:34:56] this woman must have been of the caliber
[1:34:58] of elijah because
[1:35:00] usually your action shows what you are
[1:35:04] saying again she had been chosen to
[1:35:05] entertain god's prophet
[1:35:07] remember she was a gentile not a jew
[1:35:10] and the land was burning up but no doubt
[1:35:12] this little moment being of that caliber
[1:35:15] notice what caliber was she being of the
[1:35:18] believer type
[1:35:23] amen the believer type is those that
[1:35:26] when they are down to their last
[1:35:28] spoonful of oil and the last handful of
[1:35:31] meal
[1:35:34] we're still going to trust god
[1:35:39] see god sent you the message because he
[1:35:41] knew that you were on the believer type
[1:35:45] and it doesn't mean that you'll never
[1:35:47] worry that you'll never question but
[1:35:48] when you do
[1:35:49] you'll you'll go to the right place
[1:35:51] because there's an answer there for you
[1:35:55] a promise there for you and so she was
[1:35:58] on that same caliber being of the
[1:35:59] believer type
[1:36:00] where we see that god would not have
[1:36:02] called to her if she hadn't been a
[1:36:04] worthy one
[1:36:05] yeah amen
[1:36:08] and we don't know we'll get in just a
[1:36:10] few minutes and i don't have very much
[1:36:12] left but in just a few minutes
[1:36:13] we'll get to where how that she was
[1:36:16] a woman who'd had sins in the past
[1:36:21] and we'll get to that but that was not
[1:36:24] what qualified her
[1:36:26] or disqualified her she was of the
[1:36:30] believer type
[1:36:33] that's what we need believers
[1:36:37] see if she hadn't been she wouldn't have
[1:36:38] been a worthy one to entertain god's
[1:36:40] prophet for he would have never
[1:36:42] listened sent his prophet to a house
[1:36:45] that was
[1:36:45] unworthy
[1:36:48] you've been blessed to hear the message
[1:36:50] they are i've been blessed to
[1:36:53] we've been blessed to be in message
[1:36:55] churches and places where where we know
[1:36:56] the things that we know
[1:36:58] how do we know because he would have
[1:37:00] never sent his prophet to a house so
[1:37:02] it's unworthy
[1:37:03] every time you get thinking well maybe
[1:37:04] i'm not
[1:37:12] sure i know there's three types of
[1:37:14] believer but listen why would you ever
[1:37:16] believe you're
[1:37:16] an unbeliever what's the point of that
[1:37:21] right if you're an unbeliever you just
[1:37:23] you probably just wouldn't believe right
[1:37:25] you wouldn't know and if you're a mate
[1:37:28] believer
[1:37:28] you don't know the difference see that's
[1:37:31] why
[1:37:31] someone's asked me always have i crossed
[1:37:33] the line if you cross the line you never
[1:37:34] know
[1:37:38] if you cross the line you harden that
[1:37:39] consciousness you don't care
[1:37:42] if you can right you're here this
[1:37:45] morning
[1:37:45] you must care if you care there must be
[1:37:47] mercy
[1:37:52] you care enough that you you're willing
[1:37:54] to just do the little things that the
[1:37:56] prophet said to do there must be mercy
[1:38:00] god would have never sent his prophet to
[1:38:01] a house
[1:38:03] that was unworthy it was not his
[1:38:06] choosing it was god's choosing
[1:38:08] it wasn't her bidding him it was god
[1:38:09] meaning him he had been placed by a
[1:38:11] brook
[1:38:12] the ravens were feeding him but it was
[1:38:14] god's command for something to take
[1:38:16] place
[1:38:16] and god surely went to a believer of the
[1:38:19] same nature
[1:38:20] of elijah
[1:38:24] we got too much of these people looking
[1:38:25] well brother branham was like this he
[1:38:27] was he was christ-like but for us you
[1:38:28] know we can't really be that way
[1:38:30] nonsense come on
[1:38:32] well he treated people right but we're
[1:38:34] different you know nonsense
[1:38:36] we have the same god
[1:38:39] he went to a believer the same nature of
[1:38:41] elijah
[1:38:43] listen the bible says the barrel of meal
[1:38:45] wasted not
[1:38:46] neither did the crews of oil fail
[1:38:49] according to the word of the lord
[1:38:51] which he spake by elijah
[1:38:54] that's a great way to put it isn't it
[1:38:56] the word of the lord would you spank by
[1:38:58] elijah
[1:38:59] now he would continue in her house for a
[1:39:03] while
[1:39:04] i want you to catch this before he left
[1:39:06] her house
[1:39:07] she would see the sign of the
[1:39:10] resurrection
[1:39:12] so while he was with her amen she would
[1:39:15] see the sign it came to password 17
[1:39:17] after these things
[1:39:18] that the son of the woman the mistress
[1:39:19] of the house fell sick and his sickness
[1:39:21] was so
[1:39:22] sore that there was no breath left in he
[1:39:24] died
[1:39:25] she said it to elijah what about to do
[1:39:27] with theo that man of god
[1:39:32] you think a believer can't get
[1:39:34] disgruntled sometimes
[1:39:37] now she was worthy she was of the
[1:39:38] believer type
[1:39:40] and she began to question why she even
[1:39:42] followed the message
[1:39:45] what good does it do me my kids can die
[1:39:48] anyway
[1:39:50] what did i should do with the about man
[1:39:52] of god
[1:39:59] and to slay my son is that what you're
[1:40:01] doing here is that and see so many of us
[1:40:03] come to that place in the message where
[1:40:05] we go through the hard times
[1:40:06] and we begin to wish maybe not publicly
[1:40:10] begin to think it'd be so much easier if
[1:40:13] i was never associated with the message
[1:40:16] it would have been so much easier if i'd
[1:40:18] never heard the voice of elijah
[1:40:21] if i'd have never known what it was to
[1:40:24] be
[1:40:24] so different from the world
[1:40:28] it had been so much easier if i didn't
[1:40:30] have to do that
[1:40:33] i didn't have to go to church if i
[1:40:35] didn't pay my tithes if i didn't live
[1:40:36] for god if i didn't wear these clothes
[1:40:38] if i didn't do these things that i knew
[1:40:40] if i didn't follow the dictates of the
[1:40:41] word if i wasn't baptized in jesus name
[1:40:44] there would be it would have been so
[1:40:46] much easier my family would love me more
[1:40:48] everything would have been better
[1:40:50] she said why what have you come to do
[1:40:52] you just come to make me
[1:40:54] guilty have you just come to make me
[1:40:57] feel bad
[1:41:01] he didn't come to make her feel guilty
[1:41:04] he didn't come to bring her a book of
[1:41:06] laws
[1:41:07] what did he come for
[1:41:11] she thought well if i'm in the message i
[1:41:13] won't have these troubles no
[1:41:15] he came in her trouble in her time of
[1:41:17] trouble
[1:41:18] and if he came once that way he could
[1:41:19] come again that way
[1:41:22] but see the thing is she used to like
[1:41:24] this message she believed in it first
[1:41:26] but now
[1:41:26] she's gone through an even harder trial
[1:41:28] where son that was dead she said here
[1:41:32] you've been in the house the whole time
[1:41:33] what did you do
[1:41:35] to stop him from dying all right what
[1:41:38] good did the message do me
[1:41:41] are you just come to remind me what a
[1:41:43] center i am
[1:41:44] because i know i haven't always lived up
[1:41:45] to the world
[1:41:47] she did he did not come to remind her of
[1:41:50] her sin
[1:41:51] but to remind her that there was a
[1:41:53] sacrifice for sin
[1:41:58] you did not come to bring death you come
[1:42:00] to bring
[1:42:01] life after death
[1:42:05] listen god sent the message out what
[1:42:07] elijah was god
[1:42:10] god spoke through elijah to bring life
[1:42:13] to a dead boy listen
[1:42:16] lebron said she represents the church
[1:42:18] today
[1:42:19] after a life he stayed with her for a
[1:42:21] little while she had a little boy he got
[1:42:23] sick his sickness was so bad there was
[1:42:24] no breath left in him he died then what
[1:42:26] did she do he said the church had
[1:42:28] already seen those signs the ones
[1:42:30] where he'd come in and the the meal
[1:42:32] didn't fail the oil didn't fail
[1:42:34] he said but what as soon as a little
[1:42:36] disaster comes
[1:42:37] quickly she wants to blame the church
[1:42:39] for it
[1:42:41] she wanted to blame elijah she said that
[1:42:44] man of god now you come here
[1:42:46] to call my sins to my memory and take
[1:42:48] the life of my son
[1:42:50] see she made the message for a trial but
[1:42:53] the trial
[1:42:54] the message wasn't a problem it was her
[1:42:55] solution
[1:42:58] the trial did not come the message did
[1:43:00] not come to bring a trial but the trial
[1:43:02] came
[1:43:03] to reveal to her the sign of the
[1:43:05] resurrection
[1:43:07] he said to her first kings 17 i believe
[1:43:11] this is
[1:43:11] it says one that's actually 19. he said
[1:43:13] here give me my son
[1:43:15] he took him out of her bosom and she
[1:43:17] carried him up into a loft
[1:43:18] where he abode and laid him upon his own
[1:43:20] dead he cried unto the lord and said o
[1:43:23] lord my god
[1:43:24] and so also brought evil upon the widow
[1:43:25] with whom i should journey by slaving
[1:43:27] her son
[1:43:28] the prophet don't always know what god's
[1:43:30] going to do
[1:43:33] here this boy died he said lord why did
[1:43:35] you do it
[1:43:38] he was still god's prophet he said have
[1:43:41] you come
[1:43:41] to brought bring evil upon the winner
[1:43:43] with whom i said you're my slave your
[1:43:44] son
[1:43:45] and he stretched himself upon the child
[1:43:46] three times and cried unto the lord said
[1:43:48] oh lord my god
[1:43:49] i pray that he left this child's soul
[1:43:51] coming to him again
[1:43:52] and the lord heard the voice of elijah
[1:43:55] and the soul of the child came into him
[1:43:57] again and he
[1:43:58] revived and elijah took the child and
[1:44:01] brought him down the chamber into the
[1:44:02] house
[1:44:03] and delivered him unto his mother and
[1:44:04] elijah said see
[1:44:07] i should live here
[1:44:10] you realize what god's done in the
[1:44:11] message of the hour do you realize what
[1:44:14] he's done
[1:44:14] he's come down and he showed us the sign
[1:44:16] of the resurrection he said see
[1:44:20] of god is alive
[1:44:23] he didn't come and say say behold
[1:44:26] methodist her baptist face it behold the
[1:44:28] lord
[1:44:29] she the son of god is a lot yes
[1:44:34] see the son of god is walking among you
[1:44:37] she's still in it he's not here in court
[1:44:39] performing yet
[1:44:40] he's coming that way but he's not here
[1:44:42] that way yet but see he's among you
[1:44:44] see he's the same yesterday today
[1:44:46] remember it took elijah to do that
[1:44:48] just present it to the gentile woman and
[1:44:50] say see
[1:44:53] he's alive
[1:44:56] excuse me for yelling at you this
[1:44:58] morning
[1:45:00] god gave her a son
[1:45:02] [Music]
[1:45:07] don't think because you went through the
[1:45:10] hardest trial of your life that god's
[1:45:12] throwing you away
[1:45:15] that god's letting you go but you're
[1:45:18] somehow not worthy
[1:45:20] but when you've gone through the hardest
[1:45:21] trial of your life
[1:45:23] that's when he wants to show i'm still
[1:45:29] all alive then what do we do what's our
[1:45:32] job to do we just have to keep the voice
[1:45:34] from aligned to the message of elijah
[1:45:35] alive
[1:45:37] and to do that is more than just and
[1:45:39] part of it is
[1:45:40] is having the the tapes in the books or
[1:45:43] the audio whatever it is that we have
[1:45:44] but part of it
[1:45:45] more than that is to have it living in
[1:45:47] us
[1:45:48] paul says you were written epistles read
[1:45:50] of all men he said you don't need me to
[1:45:52] write a letter of accommodation
[1:45:54] he said why because the way you live
[1:45:56] shows people you've heard my message
[1:46:00] god gave her a sign
[1:46:04] brother branham says if god raised his
[1:46:05] son from the dead we have a right to
[1:46:08] look for the sign of the resurrection
[1:46:10] of the lord jesus christ he promised it
[1:46:13] to us
[1:46:14] and we got a right for it
[1:46:19] listen jesus told them the wicked an
[1:46:21] adulterous generation
[1:46:22] was to receive a sign what kind of sign
[1:46:25] the sign of the resurrection we have it
[1:46:27] today
[1:46:28] after two thousand years remember he
[1:46:29] said they saw the sign he said but no
[1:46:30] sign will be given them except the sign
[1:46:32] of the prophet jonas
[1:46:34] he was three days in the middle of the
[1:46:35] well and he was resurrected he said
[1:46:37] accept that sign he said he is still
[1:46:40] alive
[1:46:41] let me back up he said what kind of sign
[1:46:43] sign of the resurrection we have it
[1:46:44] today
[1:46:47] elijah
[1:46:50] we have it today
[1:46:54] after 2 000 years he is still alive he
[1:46:57] is among us tonight
[1:46:58] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:47:00] identifying himself
[1:47:01] by the characteristics of god
[1:47:04] manifesting the word in this day
[1:47:06] that he promised to do yes sir it was a
[1:47:09] sign
[1:47:09] we saw the sign of the messiah that that
[1:47:11] woman saw
[1:47:13] there was someone there new the woman at
[1:47:15] the well someone that knew what she had
[1:47:17] done
[1:47:18] knew her life and we saw the sign of the
[1:47:21] messiah
[1:47:22] in william branham's ministry
[1:47:25] but then in christ as the mystery god
[1:47:27] revealed brother brown
[1:47:28] and i challenge you listen to that read
[1:47:30] it it's so important for us to survive
[1:47:33] because brother brown begins comparing
[1:47:35] the bride with the groom
[1:47:38] yes and he goes to a list of how she's
[1:47:40] like him
[1:47:43] it gets down towards the end of it he
[1:47:44] said he talked about how he stood alone
[1:47:46] he said that his
[1:47:47] church stands alone she is not hooked up
[1:47:50] with nothing
[1:47:51] but he was identified by god being the
[1:47:54] body that god dwelted
[1:47:56] and the church is identified by his body
[1:47:59] doing the same thing
[1:48:04] is his body the manifested truth of his
[1:48:06] promised word
[1:48:07] for the last days and she and she alone
[1:48:10] stands by it he said that's why the
[1:48:14] devil is housing come on
[1:48:16] listen think about this in this hour and
[1:48:18] this time that we live in right now
[1:48:19] what's going on right now all around us
[1:48:22] that's why the devil is howling
[1:48:24] these great organizations to set up
[1:48:27] something
[1:48:28] to close her up
[1:48:32] look around you if they're not trying to
[1:48:35] set up something to close up
[1:48:37] the preaching of the work but look in
[1:48:40] all different directions to set up
[1:48:42] something to closer up
[1:48:43] they'll never do it
[1:48:50] [Music]
[1:48:53] there might be times we might have to
[1:48:54] stream the service there might be time
[1:48:56] but they'll never be able to close us up
[1:48:59] why because i got the word of the
[1:49:01] prophet
[1:49:03] they'll never do he said well they'll
[1:49:05] make the law that we can't do it we just
[1:49:06] won't be able to have church they still
[1:49:07] have church in china
[1:49:11] they still have church in vietnam they
[1:49:13] still have church in
[1:49:14] in those countries where where there's a
[1:49:16] law against it why do they still have
[1:49:18] church
[1:49:19] why does the church strive in a
[1:49:20] situation like that they won't be able
[1:49:22] to do it
[1:49:23] they'll never do it and i believe that
[1:49:25] before that law whatever it is that they
[1:49:27] that they make that they come up with
[1:49:29] to close us up before they can put the
[1:49:31] lock on the doors
[1:49:33] he said they'll never do it should be
[1:49:36] taken up not closed up
[1:49:42] what confidence that ought to give us
[1:49:43] but look look
[1:49:46] said she'll be taken up not closed up or
[1:49:49] read on
[1:49:50] because we stopped too short she has now
[1:49:53] risen
[1:49:54] island
[1:50:02] [Applause]
[1:50:06] she'll be taken up not closed up she is
[1:50:09] now risen
[1:50:10] and by the power of the vindicated word
[1:50:13] promised
[1:50:13] to her
[1:50:17] she is now risen she's not waiting right
[1:50:20] on another resurrection
[1:50:21] she has risen there's one coming a
[1:50:24] change of the body
[1:50:26] full of adoptions you can say it that
[1:50:28] way but the inside the soul is ready
[1:50:31] for the first time the token is on
[1:50:33] display for the first time in two
[1:50:34] thousand years
[1:50:35] that that which was lost to pentecost is
[1:50:37] back up again
[1:50:39] she has now risen and the power of the
[1:50:41] vindicated word promised to her
[1:50:44] don't sell this message short i'm not
[1:50:47] ashamed as paul says the power of the
[1:50:48] gospel of jesus christ it's the power of
[1:50:50] god
[1:50:54] a woman turned to elijah and she said
[1:50:56] now
[1:50:59] after i've heard the message after the
[1:51:02] meal and the oil didn't fail after
[1:51:04] you showed the sign the identification
[1:51:06] of the resurrection now
[1:51:08] by this i know that thou art a man of
[1:51:10] god
[1:51:11] and that the word that's what he wanted
[1:51:13] to get her to
[1:51:14] believe the word that's what the sign
[1:51:16] was for get her to believe he was that
[1:51:18] christ was living
[1:51:20] the word of the lord and thy mouth is
[1:51:22] truth
[1:51:24] let let us be like that today musicians
[1:51:26] come up closing let us be like that let
[1:51:28] me be like this worthy
[1:51:30] gentile widow i know this message is the
[1:51:33] truth
[1:51:35] it does not come to remind me of my past
[1:51:38] it's not come just to beat me down it's
[1:51:41] come to set me free
[1:51:43] i know that it's true and more than that
[1:51:46] i know it's more than just head
[1:51:47] knowledge it's more than just knowing
[1:51:49] the scripture inside and out
[1:51:50] but i know not only is it true but it's
[1:51:52] truth in my life
[1:51:54] it's become true in my life in my life i
[1:51:56] see the signs of the resurrection
[1:51:58] in my life i know because he lives i can
[1:52:01] face tomorrow
[1:52:02] in my life i know that it's worked for
[1:52:04] my family it's worked for my church
[1:52:06] it works every time it's true the blood
[1:52:09] of the lamb and the word of my testimony
[1:52:10] works
[1:52:12] there's a problem with the word of the
[1:52:14] testimony not the blood of the lamb
[1:52:16] it works the token works the message
[1:52:19] works
[1:52:20] every time it's tried you want to see
[1:52:25] as the as the man of the welsh revival
[1:52:27] said you want to see the revival
[1:52:29] he said i'm it
[1:52:33] you want to see if the message works
[1:52:36] it's right works right here it works in
[1:52:39] this place it has to work here before it
[1:52:41] can work
[1:52:42] in my life anywhere else it's gonna work
[1:52:44] right here in the space that i occupy in
[1:52:47] these three dimensions
[1:52:48] it has to work it's got to be more than
[1:52:51] esoteric
[1:52:53] nonsense of just just jumble jumbled
[1:52:56] words and big words and things that
[1:52:58] some philosopher would understand tell
[1:53:00] me more that a philosophy is going to
[1:53:01] work
[1:53:03] it's got to be more than emotion it's
[1:53:04] got to work it has to manifest in your
[1:53:07] life
[1:53:08] we believe he's done that today thank
[1:53:10] god for the message of the hour
[1:53:12] let's power our heads together if you've
[1:53:13] not
