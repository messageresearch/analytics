[58:56] you get to be there with your mother
[58:58] and my mother is here today and we give
[59:00] her a special honor today and and one of
[59:03] the things i always wanted in my life
[59:05] was to be able to uh preach where my
[59:07] family was and especially your mother uh
[59:10] you there's just a special support there
[59:12] that you don't get from anyone else and
[59:14] so we appreciate that today isaiah
[59:16] chapter 49 and verse 14
[59:20] but zion said
[59:22] lord hath forsaken me and my lord hath
[59:25] forgotten me
[59:27] and so he poses a question
[59:30] he said can a woman forget her sucking
[59:33] child
[59:34] that she should not have compassion on
[59:36] the son of her womb
[59:38] yea they may forget
[59:40] will i not forget thee
[59:42] what a promise that is yes
[59:45] behold i have graven thee upon the palms
[59:48] of my hands
[59:49] my walls are continually
[59:52] before me i pray the lord would add his
[59:54] blessing to the word you may be seated
[1:00:00] one of the strongest impulses in the
[1:00:02] world
[1:00:03] even in the animal kingdom is a maternal
[1:00:05] instinct
[1:00:07] there's a god-given instinct especially
[1:00:09] with us human beings
[1:00:11] they're made in the image of god
[1:00:13] it's part of what was separated from
[1:00:15] adam in the garden of eden it's why men
[1:00:17] and women one of the reasons why men and
[1:00:19] women are so different
[1:00:21] is because every woman i believe has an
[1:00:23] instinct within her to be a mother and
[1:00:26] even though maybe life would would work
[1:00:28] in different ways for different people
[1:00:30] and some maybe even unable to have
[1:00:32] children and yet
[1:00:34] there's a there's an instinct there to
[1:00:36] to be a mother to care
[1:00:39] for something and
[1:00:40] and even in in the hebrew the word uh
[1:00:44] compassion if you look at that in the
[1:00:46] hebrew it actually come from the root
[1:00:48] word of womb
[1:00:50] and and the reason for that is because
[1:00:52] there's no greater compassion than what
[1:00:54] a mother feels for the for the children
[1:00:57] that she has birthed into the world
[1:00:59] and so isaiah uh he asked this question
[1:01:03] he said can a mother forget her child
[1:01:06] can a mother forget and i think we've
[1:01:08] got good moms here today
[1:01:11] i think that you would never forget your
[1:01:12] children and you might from time to time
[1:01:16] because you're human
[1:01:17] have a little spat or something with
[1:01:19] your children but you'd never forget
[1:01:21] them you would never purposely put them
[1:01:23] out of your mind which is what this word
[1:01:25] means that it's the act of removing
[1:01:27] one's knowledge from the forefront of
[1:01:29] one's mind intentionally or
[1:01:31] unintentionally you wouldn't do that you
[1:01:33] you love your children and yet it's
[1:01:36] possible for mothers for people who have
[1:01:38] children if we could say it that way
[1:01:41] that that maybe that maternal instinct
[1:01:43] is there but the devil gets into it and
[1:01:45] he begins to work against that begins to
[1:01:48] pervert womanhood and motherhood until a
[1:01:51] woman might forget her child and yet god
[1:01:54] said i'll never forget you
[1:01:56] i i your name's engraved on the palms of
[1:01:58] my hands and i'm so glad we have a god
[1:02:01] like that yes
[1:02:03] so now
[1:02:04] here it's possible for a woman a mother
[1:02:07] though she's born with that mothering
[1:02:10] instinct to forget
[1:02:11] to forget her own children
[1:02:14] and that mothering instinct is so strong
[1:02:16] if you watch little watching my little
[1:02:18] niece last night she had a she had a
[1:02:20] little baby doll and she's mothering
[1:02:22] that little baby and she's not even two
[1:02:24] years old i believe and she's mother and
[1:02:26] that baby there's something about it you
[1:02:28] know us men when a baby's born we don't
[1:02:30] hardly know how to hold them but there's
[1:02:32] something about a little girl that she
[1:02:34] knows how to do that there's just
[1:02:35] something born in her that she knows how
[1:02:37] to take care of children she knows i
[1:02:40] believe that's why mothers
[1:02:41] generally not always but generally cook
[1:02:44] better than than dads do it's because
[1:02:47] they they have a care for it they're
[1:02:48] they're interested in it my mother loves
[1:02:51] to cook but i think most of all my
[1:02:52] mother loved her children and so because
[1:02:55] she loves her children that causes her
[1:02:57] to want to feed him and that's why your
[1:02:58] mom when you go home you know and you
[1:03:00] come into mom's house and and she always
[1:03:03] asks you have you had anything to eat
[1:03:04] and are you hungry and she's just
[1:03:06] constantly there trying to feed you
[1:03:08] trying to give you something to drink
[1:03:09] why do moms do that it's that it's that
[1:03:11] instinct to be a mother
[1:03:13] to care to have compassion and that come
[1:03:16] from god and i want to make that clear
[1:03:18] this morning that's not something that
[1:03:20] society as they would say today well
[1:03:22] it's just an expectation that society
[1:03:24] has no it's an instinct to come from god
[1:03:26] yes sir god placed that in a mother that
[1:03:29] she would be able to do that and want to
[1:03:31] do that and and we honor that today
[1:03:35] and yet again it is possible for a
[1:03:38] mother to forget her baby i guess the
[1:03:39] most stark example of that would be
[1:03:42] abortion where
[1:03:45] since the i know it's been in the news
[1:03:47] lately that roe versus wade the court
[1:03:49] case before the supreme court
[1:03:52] that allowed legal abortion since that
[1:03:54] time more than 60 million babies
[1:03:56] have been aborted in this country
[1:03:59] 60 million
[1:04:01] that their mothers chose not to have
[1:04:03] them
[1:04:04] and so a mother can forget her baby
[1:04:08] and you can't even it's incomprehensible
[1:04:10] to some of us to think how could that be
[1:04:12] and i look not just at that but how
[1:04:14] children are raised anymore and i look
[1:04:17] at it and think how could you have a
[1:04:18] child
[1:04:19] and leave it in that condition
[1:04:21] and it's dirty and it's hungry if you've
[1:04:23] ever worked i know some that work in the
[1:04:25] school systems they know there's
[1:04:26] children that are left out in the cold
[1:04:29] practically and they send them to school
[1:04:30] and they don't have nothing to eat and
[1:04:32] they're have parents that don't care
[1:04:34] about them and they get into all kinds
[1:04:35] of things my children tell me stories
[1:04:37] about the children that they associate
[1:04:39] with the school and how that their
[1:04:41] parents don't care what kind of movies
[1:04:42] they watch or they don't care what kind
[1:04:44] of television they watch they don't care
[1:04:46] what they do on their phones they don't
[1:04:48] care what they do in any other area of
[1:04:50] their life and so the child is just left
[1:04:52] to fend for themselves and even so far
[1:04:54] as to actively work against it i've told
[1:04:57] you before but melody told me a story
[1:04:59] about a girl in her class that she was
[1:05:01] talking to her about the lord and
[1:05:02] witnessing his children will to one
[1:05:04] another and and she said the little girl
[1:05:06] told her said well my family had a bible
[1:05:08] she said i got a bible one time from
[1:05:10] school they send them they put them in
[1:05:12] backpacks that they give to children and
[1:05:14] she said i got a bible and brought it
[1:05:15] home and said my parents found me with
[1:05:17] it and told me to get rid of it
[1:05:20] you can imagine what kind of a mother
[1:05:21] would do that what kind of a father
[1:05:23] would do that
[1:05:24] yeah and i know it's a little bit heavy
[1:05:27] this morning but i want to bring it
[1:05:29] around i'm building towards a positive
[1:05:31] spiritual application this morning but
[1:05:34] you know even reversing roe versus wade
[1:05:36] and making it
[1:05:38] making it where the states could decide
[1:05:40] whether it was legal or illegal to have
[1:05:41] abortions that wouldn't stop abortion
[1:05:45] right it would continue on and even in
[1:05:47] brother branagh's time he said there
[1:05:48] were more than 30 000 a week in chicago
[1:05:51] before it was ever legal
[1:05:54] years before
[1:05:55] and but now you see that they're wanting
[1:05:57] to make it legal and and you have the
[1:05:59] strange spectacle of women who could be
[1:06:01] mothers protesting for the right to
[1:06:04] continue murdering their children
[1:06:07] what kind of an age do we live in if god
[1:06:10] would not would not forgive sodom and
[1:06:13] gomorrah for what they did how could he
[1:06:15] ever forgive this nation
[1:06:17] and i would say that this nation is gone
[1:06:19] it's been invaded by the devil by
[1:06:21] demonic thought but thank god for a
[1:06:24] bride that's on the earth today thank
[1:06:26] god for the people of god that still
[1:06:28] have that that reality of a mother
[1:06:30] instinct of a father instinct in their
[1:06:33] lives that they can still act according
[1:06:35] to the word
[1:06:36] they're still a people on the earth
[1:06:38] aren't you glad for that today
[1:06:41] but people would protest for the ride i
[1:06:43] know that's heavy to hear on mother's
[1:06:44] day but it ought to make you even more
[1:06:46] thankful for a godly mother
[1:06:49] that there would be some who would who
[1:06:51] would actively work for the right to
[1:06:53] kill their babies
[1:06:56] and and the bible says woe unto them
[1:06:59] they call evil good
[1:07:02] and good evil make it legal
[1:07:04] say well it doesn't matter if it's legal
[1:07:05] or not it does matter
[1:07:07] those that call evil good and good evil
[1:07:09] to put darkness for light and light for
[1:07:11] darkness put bitter for sweet and sweet
[1:07:13] for bitter
[1:07:15] they value the wrong things yes and yet
[1:07:18] abortion is not the only sign that
[1:07:19] motherhood is broken today
[1:07:22] motherhood is more than having children
[1:07:25] all of you mothers could say amen to
[1:07:26] that this morning it's more than just
[1:07:28] having a child but it's raising a child
[1:07:31] and i know a few of you perhaps have
[1:07:33] been adopted and and you were adopted
[1:07:35] into a family where you had a mother but
[1:07:37] it wasn't your birth mother but it was
[1:07:39] someone who raised you and that's mother
[1:07:41] to you
[1:07:42] that's mom because she raised you and
[1:07:45] and she brought you up we're given the
[1:07:47] example uh of moses in the scriptures
[1:07:50] that when he was a little boy it was his
[1:07:52] mother who gave him his instruction it
[1:07:54] was a godly mother who took little moses
[1:07:56] on her knees and and said moses and
[1:07:58] taught him all and she said now these
[1:08:01] things moses someday you're going to
[1:08:02] deliver the children of israel you're
[1:08:04] the boy that's called i think that's
[1:08:05] important for us to put that before our
[1:08:08] children you're a child of god you're
[1:08:10] different from the world and you know
[1:08:12] they may go out and they may leave and
[1:08:13] they may they may go out in the world
[1:08:15] and do all kinds of things but they'll
[1:08:16] always have that in their heart because
[1:08:18] mother placed that in them and said
[1:08:20] you're special yes you're called for
[1:08:23] something special you're not like
[1:08:24] everybody else you're the one god called
[1:08:27] amen to be his child and we get that
[1:08:30] many times from our mother when we're
[1:08:31] little and so she told moses you're the
[1:08:33] boy that's called keep yourself pure and
[1:08:36] unspotted from the world for you're the
[1:08:37] one
[1:08:38] no other place where we know where he
[1:08:40] ever went to any seminary any teaching
[1:08:42] at all he ever got he stayed right in
[1:08:44] pharaoh's palace which was the heathen
[1:08:45] but his mother taught him i think if
[1:08:47] there were more mothers that taught
[1:08:49] their children today we wouldn't have to
[1:08:50] worry so much about the public schools
[1:08:53] i realized the public schools are bad
[1:08:55] but my kids have went to public school
[1:08:56] all of their life i guess but they had a
[1:08:58] mom at home
[1:09:00] and whatever you do whether you
[1:09:01] homeschool or send them to public school
[1:09:03] make sure you teach them on on your knee
[1:09:06] amen when they're little
[1:09:08] his mother taught him he said that's a
[1:09:10] real mother she taught him the precepts
[1:09:13] of the lord she told him how he must be
[1:09:15] holy she told him how and what he must
[1:09:18] live and what god must do would do for
[1:09:20] him and it stuck with moses all the days
[1:09:22] of his life
[1:09:24] and any good true law mother that'll
[1:09:26] take her little babies instead of
[1:09:28] sending them to picture shows and dances
[1:09:29] and so forth like that she'll put them
[1:09:32] on her lap and teach them about the lord
[1:09:34] jesus christ i'm so glad i had a mother
[1:09:36] like that
[1:09:37] and if you did i'm sure you could say
[1:09:39] amen to that today
[1:09:41] it makes a difference in your life
[1:09:44] and yet there's other kinds of mothers
[1:09:47] there was a mother in the scripture
[1:09:49] named herodias
[1:09:51] who had a daughter
[1:09:52] and we know the story how the john
[1:09:55] baptist was there in the prison
[1:09:57] and and she was she hated it because he
[1:10:00] told her he spoke the truth he spoke the
[1:10:02] word that it's not lawful for for you to
[1:10:04] be married to herod and he spoke that to
[1:10:07] the king and the king put him in jail
[1:10:09] but the king was afraid to kill him
[1:10:11] and she wanted him dead and so she went
[1:10:13] to her daughter and she taught her
[1:10:15] daughter to dance
[1:10:17] so that she would gain the favor of men
[1:10:20] her young daughter was taught to dance
[1:10:22] in such a way so that the king she would
[1:10:25] gain the favor of the king
[1:10:26] and then when she did that she
[1:10:28] instructed her daughter the bible says
[1:10:30] she being before instructed of her
[1:10:32] mother when the king asked you what do
[1:10:34] you want
[1:10:35] i want john babbed his head in a charger
[1:10:39] or on a platter
[1:10:41] what kind of a mother
[1:10:44] would use and manipulate her daughter
[1:10:48] i know it's a little bit heavy this
[1:10:49] morning but we'll get past it in a
[1:10:50] minute
[1:10:52] but would use to manipulate her daughter
[1:10:54] to actually put her out there before men
[1:10:57] so that she could she could
[1:10:59] try to satisfy whatever bitterness she
[1:11:02] had towards the preacher you could say
[1:11:04] it that way
[1:11:06] and try to do away with her but you know
[1:11:08] i'm so glad that we have christian mamas
[1:11:11] that won't do that that will refuse to
[1:11:12] do that
[1:11:13] but random told us that there were 70
[1:11:15] offspring
[1:11:17] of this woman of herodias who were
[1:11:19] either prostitutes or on the gallows
[1:11:21] that we found in history her family fell
[1:11:24] apart because she was the mother that
[1:11:27] taught hers the things of the world but
[1:11:28] the writer said one mother taught hers
[1:11:30] the things of the world the other mother
[1:11:32] taught hers the things of god one become
[1:11:34] a great leader and a conqueror is
[1:11:36] immortal among men today speaking of
[1:11:38] moses the other is debauched and in hell
[1:11:41] and taken thousands times thousands
[1:11:43] with her
[1:11:45] and i would say today is
[1:11:47] as again we're moving towards something
[1:11:49] today but just to lay a foundation here
[1:11:50] to show you that motherhood is broken we
[1:11:53] see that every day
[1:11:56] we see it every day i see mothers who
[1:11:58] their children will tell them no
[1:12:00] and they'll just let them do whatever
[1:12:02] they want to
[1:12:04] you don't care about the child
[1:12:07] i see them where they'll go to the store
[1:12:09] and buy and i always wonder as we pick
[1:12:12] up our kids every day from school and i
[1:12:14] look at the children the way that
[1:12:15] they're dressed i think did mamas really
[1:12:17] dress their children like that
[1:12:19] are you with me this morning
[1:12:21] i don't mean to be to be rude on a
[1:12:23] mother's day but but i look at it and
[1:12:24] think did you really dress your little
[1:12:26] girls one thing for a grown woman she
[1:12:28] has a choice how she wants to dress she
[1:12:29] can buy her own clothes but here's your
[1:12:31] little daughter 8 9 10 years old and
[1:12:33] you've dressed her in such a way that
[1:12:35] that you have to turn your head to look
[1:12:37] at her
[1:12:39] that's a mother
[1:12:41] putting her daughter out in front
[1:12:43] of men
[1:12:44] teaching them to sin
[1:12:47] god help us that we would never do that
[1:12:50] and i noticed that some of the same
[1:12:51] women who protest abortion
[1:12:54] would train their daughters
[1:12:56] to dress before men in such a way that
[1:12:58] they'll be before they get married
[1:13:01] they'll end up in a relationship living
[1:13:03] together and have no expectation of
[1:13:04] getting married no expectation have kids
[1:13:07] with one and then move on to another and
[1:13:09] train their daughters in that way and
[1:13:11] yet protest against abortion
[1:13:14] some of the same women
[1:13:15] i have a problem with that being a
[1:13:18] mother is not just raising not just
[1:13:19] having a child
[1:13:21] but it's raising a child
[1:13:23] but what's happened is and the people
[1:13:25] are blinded they don't mean to be that
[1:13:27] way i'm convinced many people they don't
[1:13:29] they just don't see it because the word
[1:13:31] of god is not open to the people
[1:13:33] they they just don't see what's going on
[1:13:35] and so they don't they don't mean to do
[1:13:37] that necessarily but they look at it
[1:13:39] it's just the way the culture is why
[1:13:41] because the united states and i believe
[1:13:43] the entire world but here in the united
[1:13:45] states we've been invaded yes that's
[1:13:47] right and brother branham preached that
[1:13:48] in a sermon called the invasion of the
[1:13:50] usa on mother's day in 1954 and he said
[1:13:54] this he said he set up his headquarters
[1:13:56] over here in hollywood the devil landed
[1:13:58] a few years ago 15 or 20 years ago went
[1:14:01] hid in hollywood california and he has
[1:14:03] invaded the united states with his demon
[1:14:06] powers he said all our fashions come
[1:14:08] from paris they get it in hollywood onto
[1:14:10] the screens these little girls and
[1:14:11] little boys and things get out here they
[1:14:13] watch them scream place nice little kid
[1:14:16] he's fine little fellas nothing against
[1:14:17] them god bless their little hearts he
[1:14:19] said my heart bleeds for them and right
[1:14:21] here in the city i was talking to my boy
[1:14:22] the other day he said daddy if there was
[1:14:24] just some boys around there in town that
[1:14:25] had the holy ghost he said and so forth
[1:14:28] you wonder why i was getting away to
[1:14:29] denver colorado or something like that
[1:14:31] he was going to take a trip and get away
[1:14:32] from jeffersonville he said i get my
[1:14:34] children somewhere where there's a bunch
[1:14:36] of people who cry out to god
[1:14:38] oh i want to have a place like that
[1:14:40] where the kids can go to somewhere where
[1:14:42] there's a bunch of people who cry out to
[1:14:44] god in spite of the nation that's been
[1:14:46] invaded by the devil let us be somewhere
[1:14:48] let's be a safe place listen moms and
[1:14:51] dads make your home a safe place make
[1:14:53] your home a safe place for your children
[1:14:55] for your grandchildren a place that has
[1:14:57] not been invaded
[1:14:59] they may have invaded hollywood they may
[1:15:01] have invaded new york they may have
[1:15:02] invaded hardy arkansas but they've not
[1:15:05] invaded my home because my home has the
[1:15:07] token on the door when the death angel
[1:15:09] come into the land what did they do they
[1:15:11] put the token on the door and you and i
[1:15:13] are to have the token on display today
[1:15:16] are you with me this morning
[1:15:18] the token on display where the people
[1:15:20] can come in where our families can come
[1:15:23] in and there's a place where people cry
[1:15:25] out to god
[1:15:26] for what we need
[1:15:28] he said the political world is gone
[1:15:30] don't look for politics for your
[1:15:31] salvation
[1:15:33] it's never going to happen
[1:15:35] or you might have one that would be
[1:15:36] better than another one you could vote
[1:15:37] for over another sure there might be
[1:15:39] some who are for
[1:15:41] godly principles biblical principles
[1:15:43] some who are not but yet it'll never be
[1:15:45] the salvation of this nation it's going
[1:15:47] to keep getting worse
[1:15:49] and the conservatives will get more
[1:15:50] liberal and the liberal will get more
[1:15:52] liberal and it'll keep getting worse and
[1:15:53] worse it never gets better does it it
[1:15:55] never turns back the other way why the
[1:15:57] invasion has come in
[1:15:59] the invasion many years ago decades ago
[1:16:01] the invasion come into the usa and it's
[1:16:04] taken over
[1:16:06] it's taken over and there was nothing
[1:16:08] the people would would not state on the
[1:16:10] word that were not in revival so that
[1:16:12] they would recognize it and defeat it
[1:16:14] and so they fall into it
[1:16:17] so now he said the political world is
[1:16:19] gone our nation is broke and i don't
[1:16:20] think he just meant financially but the
[1:16:22] nation is broke morally
[1:16:25] and we see that today the nation is
[1:16:27] broken
[1:16:28] it's broken it's beyond it's just the
[1:16:30] people don't even think morally anymore
[1:16:33] don't even think appropriately and even
[1:16:35] you see what people wear what people do
[1:16:37] what they what they allow their children
[1:16:39] to do and you look at it and it just
[1:16:41] makes you shake your head because you
[1:16:42] think it's broken
[1:16:44] they don't have any sense of what's
[1:16:45] right and wrong but oh god that we'd
[1:16:47] have a generation of people today of
[1:16:50] people that could hear the word of the
[1:16:51] lord and say that's what i want not
[1:16:53] because somebody's making me do it it's
[1:16:55] not because i'm part of some cult
[1:16:56] somewhere it makes me dress a certain
[1:16:58] way but because the word of god is still
[1:17:00] true
[1:17:01] amen and what he said is still right yes
[1:17:04] but this nation is broke
[1:17:07] it's broke he said you remember that
[1:17:09] brother branham said that thus saith the
[1:17:10] lord he said our nation is debolish he
[1:17:13] puts two words together demolished and
[1:17:15] abolished i think it's a good word
[1:17:17] it's demolished it'll never rise she is
[1:17:19] gone like all the rest of the nations
[1:17:22] it's the greatest nation in the world
[1:17:24] standing today
[1:17:27] the best of a bad law you'll find that
[1:17:29] out if you go overseas still
[1:17:31] you travel very much you'll find out
[1:17:33] this is the best nation you can't wait
[1:17:35] to get back to it
[1:17:37] and yet the very seed of the devil has
[1:17:39] been planted in the hearts of the people
[1:17:42] it's the greatest nation but also the
[1:17:44] most ungodly yes
[1:17:47] think about it we're democracy and we're
[1:17:49] where we have freedom of religion and
[1:17:50] ability to come and preach and i'm so
[1:17:52] thankful for that
[1:17:54] but also where the the seeds of
[1:17:56] hollywood and the seeds of the devil is
[1:17:58] coming to hollywood and into the people
[1:18:00] and to the point where people don't even
[1:18:01] know right from wrong
[1:18:03] they have no clue they can be persuaded
[1:18:05] by any demagogue that comes along to
[1:18:07] just follow whatever they say because
[1:18:09] they don't have any any standard they
[1:18:10] don't have any any kind of an anchor but
[1:18:13] i'm so glad we have an anchor today i'm
[1:18:16] so glad we have an anchor that keeps us
[1:18:18] still in a world that's full of chaos
[1:18:20] yes
[1:18:21] brother branham said how it got in the
[1:18:23] people and begin to this you can't tell
[1:18:24] them nothing she's gone she's invaded
[1:18:26] and the spirit of communism has took
[1:18:28] over everybody said well we don't want
[1:18:29] to be communists we don't want to vote
[1:18:31] for for that party because they're
[1:18:32] communist but the spirit of communism
[1:18:35] took over years ago
[1:18:38] what is that a spirit of anarchy a
[1:18:39] spirit a spirit that does not believe in
[1:18:42] god
[1:18:44] and they got a little social gospel
[1:18:45] standing there but the brown talked
[1:18:47] about the schools and the different
[1:18:48] things that went on there and the
[1:18:49] horrible things he said they got a
[1:18:51] little social gospel standing there
[1:18:52] where preachers stand and talk about
[1:18:54] little petty things
[1:18:56] i'm so glad we don't just stand and talk
[1:18:57] about petty things they make you feel
[1:19:00] good but we don't do that we deal with
[1:19:01] reality today
[1:19:03] we deal with reality we're dealing with
[1:19:04] the hearts of men and women who try to
[1:19:06] make you come to a place of repentance
[1:19:08] listen or to draw you to come to a place
[1:19:10] of repentance he said preachers stand
[1:19:11] and talk about little petty things
[1:19:12] little bitty stories of the bible or
[1:19:14] something like that instead of preaching
[1:19:15] repentance and bringing men and women to
[1:19:17] the altar i believe we still need that
[1:19:20] today yes sir
[1:19:22] and just as an example you know if we
[1:19:24] look at the way people dress and allow
[1:19:27] their children to dress and brother
[1:19:28] branham had to deal with that we always
[1:19:30] have to deal with that in the next
[1:19:31] generation even among our girls and i've
[1:19:33] got two girls and i have to deal with
[1:19:35] this as well but the random had two
[1:19:37] girls at home becky and sarah at this
[1:19:39] time he said i'm i'm certainly against
[1:19:41] some little old skin type dresses
[1:19:44] he said i constantly fuss at my kids
[1:19:46] becky and sarah i don't care how little
[1:19:47] they are i just fuss at them all the
[1:19:48] time why would you fuss with a little
[1:19:51] child over over a dress that was too
[1:19:52] tight or too short well the reason why
[1:19:54] when these were not little bitty
[1:19:55] children talking about toddlers they
[1:19:57] were nearly teenagers or teenagers at
[1:20:00] that time but the reason why you would
[1:20:01] fuss at children for that is because
[1:20:03] what you teach them is what they'll do
[1:20:07] right and what you teach them to wear is
[1:20:10] what they'll wear
[1:20:13] right so he said media takes becky apart
[1:20:15] every day about it dresses plum up and
[1:20:17] and you go look through the message and
[1:20:19] and you think about it whenever uh and
[1:20:21] you know and a woman knows because when
[1:20:23] you sit down and you can't cover your
[1:20:25] knees and the dress won't cover your
[1:20:26] knees you start pulling it down you feel
[1:20:28] self-conscious
[1:20:30] because men notice it
[1:20:33] boy i want to get myself in trouble
[1:20:34] today
[1:20:36] but men notice that when it's above the
[1:20:38] knees it's just the truth of it
[1:20:41] and you always have to pull on it and so
[1:20:43] we teach our children our girls don't
[1:20:45] don't wear skirts like that you can just
[1:20:47] wear them a little bit longer
[1:20:49] so you can so you could be able to not
[1:20:51] have to do that
[1:20:53] where i'm a little bit looser and that
[1:20:54] you can be pretty you don't have to be
[1:20:57] some aunt
[1:20:58] or old woman out there somewhere and
[1:21:00] that looks like you come out of the
[1:21:02] 1940s and out of out of the backwoods of
[1:21:06] hardy somewhere you don't have to look
[1:21:07] like that but you can look like a decent
[1:21:09] godly girl you know what i found out my
[1:21:11] girls when they went to school that the
[1:21:13] other girls especially when they were
[1:21:14] younger wanted to be like them
[1:21:18] they they would always come to them and
[1:21:19] the girls and whenever my girls went to
[1:21:21] school there were other girls that would
[1:21:22] start wearing dresses not many but a few
[1:21:24] of them would want to wear dresses
[1:21:25] because my girls wore dresses and they
[1:21:28] thought how pretty that was they weren't
[1:21:29] old enough to have been cankered by the
[1:21:32] world that we live in today
[1:21:34] but they should be taught to look like
[1:21:36] girls i'm just using that as an example
[1:21:38] because motherhood is broken and it's
[1:21:40] broken womanhood
[1:21:42] and it's broken down to the children
[1:21:44] until little bitty girls and growing up
[1:21:46] even around the church if you say
[1:21:47] anything about it you're you're evil
[1:21:50] but the bible had a lot to say about it
[1:21:54] but look some people just never been
[1:21:56] taught
[1:21:57] and that's our responsibility but
[1:21:58] brother brown said kids you can expect
[1:22:00] that in kids and you have to correct
[1:22:02] them but when it comes to a woman
[1:22:04] there's something wrong there
[1:22:06] and so we should look at that and say
[1:22:08] what does the word teach me and that's
[1:22:09] not my job to tell you how long it
[1:22:11] should be or or whether you should have
[1:22:13] sleeves or not look to the word and get
[1:22:15] the holy ghost
[1:22:19] all right and that will be taken care of
[1:22:22] i'm moving through this we'll be done
[1:22:24] with this part in a minute
[1:22:26] motherhood is broken
[1:22:28] boys that's why boys look like they do
[1:22:31] and it's broken to the point where it
[1:22:32] don't even it's beyond that you know we
[1:22:34] deal with that in church
[1:22:36] but what they're dealing with in the
[1:22:37] world is is my child a boy or a girl
[1:22:39] well i don't know till they tell me
[1:22:44] yeah that's my job
[1:22:46] as a parent
[1:22:48] is to determine what my child and
[1:22:51] and and to to place him in the right
[1:22:53] path the worst possible thing i could do
[1:22:56] for them is let them make their own
[1:22:57] decisions when they're five about what
[1:22:59] their gender is
[1:23:02] it's cruelty
[1:23:06] it's cruelty and yet most girls have
[1:23:08] that maternal instinct most boys will
[1:23:10] have the paternal instinct but you know
[1:23:11] what changes them what makes them want
[1:23:13] to be
[1:23:14] all changing a boy into a girl and a
[1:23:16] girl into a boy it's the culture that we
[1:23:18] live in
[1:23:19] and they can say what they want to oh
[1:23:20] we're not going to we're going to let
[1:23:21] them decide actors and actresses today
[1:23:24] we're going to let them decide what
[1:23:25] they're going to be well you know what's
[1:23:26] deciding for them tv is
[1:23:28] hollywood is the school is
[1:23:32] right that's right let's let's let our
[1:23:34] boys be boys so it's not just the girls
[1:23:37] but boys should be taught to look like
[1:23:38] boys
[1:23:39] and girls should be taught to look like
[1:23:41] girls but we don't do that because it's
[1:23:43] broken motherhood is broken and brother
[1:23:44] branham said that's the backbone of the
[1:23:46] nation
[1:23:47] you break motherhood you broke the
[1:23:49] nation right then
[1:23:52] now i want to move this away
[1:23:54] and talk about spiritual motherhood for
[1:23:56] a moment
[1:23:57] spiritual motherhood is broken
[1:24:00] it's okay if i take this off i'm
[1:24:02] sweating like a pig up here today
[1:24:04] maybe because i'm about as big as one
[1:24:07] i can joke about myself it's okay
[1:24:11] and you can laugh you won't hurt my
[1:24:12] feelings a bit
[1:24:15] now look
[1:24:18] something about this time of year it's
[1:24:19] just humid
[1:24:20] hot
[1:24:21] now look i can't imagine we're we're
[1:24:23] planning on going uh on a mission trip
[1:24:26] this year to a place that's that's a
[1:24:27] desert
[1:24:28] and in the middle of the summer
[1:24:30] what in the world am i doing i can't
[1:24:32] handle the heat
[1:24:34] but let's look at spiritual motherhood
[1:24:36] for a moment
[1:24:38] because as a church
[1:24:40] we're typed as a mother in revelation 17
[1:24:42] 5 you find a great church
[1:24:44] and upon her forehead and you can go
[1:24:47] read the rest of the chapter later and
[1:24:48] it'll kind of place what she is and
[1:24:51] it's it was a name written mystery
[1:24:52] babylon the great the mother of harlot
[1:24:55] so she's a mother she's identified as a
[1:24:57] mother
[1:24:58] but she's the mother of harlots and
[1:25:00] abominations of the earth and she is a
[1:25:03] church she sits on seven hills she's a
[1:25:05] church
[1:25:06] and so spiritual motherhood if we can
[1:25:08] say it that way is broken
[1:25:10] because again like i said
[1:25:13] you know it's not just to have children
[1:25:15] but to care for those children
[1:25:18] right to have children and then to care
[1:25:20] for those children now what are we doing
[1:25:22] as a church we're called to birth the
[1:25:25] word or to have a birth of the word in
[1:25:27] our lives
[1:25:28] and to care for that to to graze it up
[1:25:31] to to have the word in its proper place
[1:25:34] in our lives just like mary now think
[1:25:36] about it for a moment when mary had
[1:25:38] jesus she was not called just to just to
[1:25:40] be a surrogate mother that would come in
[1:25:43] and have the baby we focus on that a lot
[1:25:45] how that she was there in the manger at
[1:25:47] christmas time we look at that but she
[1:25:49] didn't just have the baby in the manger
[1:25:50] and leave him there
[1:25:52] and he wasn't so much god now listen to
[1:25:54] me i love how god come to the earth come
[1:25:56] down on our level
[1:25:58] he wasn't so much god that he didn't
[1:25:59] need a mother
[1:26:01] right and i mean in the natural sense
[1:26:04] but he's so he so lowered himself that
[1:26:07] he come down god manifested himself in
[1:26:09] flesh come down become a germ in the
[1:26:12] womb of mary and then when he was
[1:26:14] growing into a baby he actually was born
[1:26:16] and when he was born he needed his
[1:26:18] mother
[1:26:20] he was completely dependent on his
[1:26:22] mother
[1:26:23] and to her which she was a type of the
[1:26:25] church today she was responsible for
[1:26:27] keeping him alive
[1:26:30] now that's a great responsibility you
[1:26:31] think about your children and how you
[1:26:33] were responsible but you don't know who
[1:26:34] they're going to be you think about that
[1:26:37] that child they might turn out to be
[1:26:39] god forbid be in prison somewhere god
[1:26:42] forbid that they would but they might
[1:26:43] also turn out to be president of the
[1:26:45] united states you don't know
[1:26:47] they might also turn out to be a
[1:26:49] preacher
[1:26:50] which someone told me the other day
[1:26:52] that's a higher office than president of
[1:26:53] the u.s and i'll say that it is maybe
[1:26:55] not mine so much as these other brothers
[1:26:57] but but but there is a something that
[1:26:59] could turn out to be a helper a deacon a
[1:27:01] mother
[1:27:02] a godly mother they could turn out to be
[1:27:03] a great person
[1:27:06] right and you don't know and so you're
[1:27:08] given this child and you have to nurture
[1:27:10] them and care for them and mary was
[1:27:11] given the word
[1:27:13] now think about it from it she was given
[1:27:15] the word
[1:27:17] and then she had to let it grow
[1:27:19] and she had to watch it and it played in
[1:27:22] front of her
[1:27:23] and she watched it so it didn't run off
[1:27:24] in the woods
[1:27:26] right yeah so he didn't run off in the
[1:27:28] woods and get hurt
[1:27:30] and she she nursed his wounds
[1:27:33] he was a man
[1:27:36] right she took care of him she put
[1:27:37] band-aids on his owies
[1:27:41] right
[1:27:42] just like you do just like your mothers
[1:27:44] do she was taking care of the word
[1:27:47] and as a church
[1:27:49] i hope we understand the spiritual
[1:27:50] application as we turn this today now
[1:27:52] towards the end of it as we begin to
[1:27:54] look at the church and our
[1:27:56] responsibility what responsibility do we
[1:27:58] have we have the word yes
[1:28:01] it's been placed in our care other
[1:28:03] people don't care about it yes
[1:28:06] there's many others that don't care
[1:28:07] about it but as for the malka as the
[1:28:09] word we've been we it's been placed into
[1:28:11] our care and we've got to have that
[1:28:13] instinct as a church
[1:28:15] to mother it
[1:28:18] to take care of it to keep it pure
[1:28:22] i'm sure she made sure that jesus played
[1:28:25] with the right kind of kids
[1:28:27] she made sure that he went in the right
[1:28:28] places and he didn't get caught up in
[1:28:30] the wrong place you understand he never
[1:28:32] sinned
[1:28:33] right he was god in flesh i'm sure he
[1:28:35] was a good kid but he was human
[1:28:38] flesh
[1:28:39] and she made sure that jesus went to the
[1:28:41] right places and i'm sure there were
[1:28:43] times she cried and she prayed there was
[1:28:45] a time she even lost him
[1:28:48] you remember
[1:28:49] she lost him and she left him in
[1:28:51] jerusalem because sometimes good mothers
[1:28:53] make mistakes
[1:28:55] it's okay but always come back to the
[1:28:58] word
[1:29:00] where do you go back to it at the place
[1:29:01] where you left it yes
[1:29:05] good mothers make mistakes many times
[1:29:07] but that doesn't mean they're not a
[1:29:08] mother and she made a mistake she left
[1:29:10] him she wasn't watching him like she
[1:29:11] should have been he was 12 years old and
[1:29:13] she found him at the temple because he
[1:29:15] was the word oh as a church we need to
[1:29:17] keep our eyes on the word i don't know
[1:29:19] what another church is doing not what
[1:29:21] the world's doing let's keep our eye on
[1:29:23] the word we have a responsibility
[1:29:26] amen
[1:29:28] but this this roman church this mystery
[1:29:30] babylon that set on seven hills they
[1:29:32] didn't do that
[1:29:33] they got their eyes on other
[1:29:36] lovers and couldn't be a mother
[1:29:39] to children of god
[1:29:41] but become a mother of denominations
[1:29:46] and unbiblical doctrines that come out
[1:29:48] of the bottomless pit
[1:29:51] brother branham speaking of how
[1:29:53] womanhood and motherhood is broken and
[1:29:54] he deals with that
[1:29:56] in invisible union of the bride of
[1:29:58] christ
[1:29:59] he said she characters herself out here
[1:30:01] with a pair of shorts on skin type men's
[1:30:03] clothing and things on the street
[1:30:04] twisting around no matter what she says
[1:30:06] she might be as virtuous to her husband
[1:30:08] as she can be but in the sight of god
[1:30:09] she's an adulteress
[1:30:11] because the scripture said whosoever
[1:30:13] looked at the final woman to lust after
[1:30:14] her has committed adultery with her
[1:30:16] already in his heart and she presented
[1:30:18] herself to be that now think spiritually
[1:30:20] now he said that's exactly what the
[1:30:22] church has done with the world yes she
[1:30:24] presented herself
[1:30:26] as open today we have seeker sensitive
[1:30:29] churches
[1:30:30] open to whatever the people are
[1:30:33] you just come as you are stay as you are
[1:30:35] be as you are
[1:30:36] but that's not the gospel
[1:30:38] the gospel is come in a center come in
[1:30:40] hurting come in broken but when you're
[1:30:43] when you come in you may be a sinner but
[1:30:45] you won't leave one if you give your
[1:30:46] life to christ you'll leave redeemed
[1:30:49] if you when you come in you may be
[1:30:50] broken but you can leave whole when you
[1:30:52] come in you may be hurting but you can
[1:30:54] leave healed
[1:30:56] that's what the gospel does it doesn't
[1:30:57] leave you in your condition but it
[1:30:59] changes you into a better place
[1:31:03] amen
[1:31:04] so he said i'm speaking how it can get
[1:31:07] away
[1:31:08] when you get to mixing up with the world
[1:31:10] the church and all the fashions and
[1:31:11] things that we have and he speaks to the
[1:31:13] church he said we're no more like the
[1:31:14] original pentecost was than day is from
[1:31:16] night we've drifted off somewhere into
[1:31:18] some dark chaos somewhere and lost
[1:31:21] what a sacred trust
[1:31:23] what a responsibility to a woman he said
[1:31:25] she's a type of the church which has the
[1:31:27] same responsibility
[1:31:30] and a woman as a woman has a sacred
[1:31:32] responsibility to her motherhood to her
[1:31:34] virtues to her husband the church has a
[1:31:36] sacred responsibility to prayer yes
[1:31:40] amen
[1:31:41] oh god
[1:31:43] a sacred responsibility to prayer
[1:31:47] that's not just a few words now and then
[1:31:48] over a meal
[1:31:50] but it's my responsibility if i love him
[1:31:53] to pray
[1:31:54] if i want to keep my sacred
[1:31:56] responsibility my virtues to christ is
[1:31:58] to pray and to the word
[1:32:02] that's why we give the word the
[1:32:03] preeminence in the service
[1:32:05] right not because it's me talking or one
[1:32:07] of these other brothers but because our
[1:32:09] sacred responsibility as a church is to
[1:32:12] the word
[1:32:13] and to christ just the same as the woman
[1:32:16] has
[1:32:17] and as a woman drifts off with another
[1:32:19] man
[1:32:19] oh god when the church goes off in these
[1:32:22] institutional programs building programs
[1:32:24] and schools and so forth he said i have
[1:32:26] nothing against them they're all right
[1:32:27] they serve their purpose but jesus never
[1:32:29] said go make schools
[1:32:31] he said preach the word
[1:32:33] that's where they neglect it
[1:32:35] he said not make institutions hospitals
[1:32:37] and so forth them is all right but
[1:32:39] that's not the church's duty their duty
[1:32:41] is to preach the gospel he said but
[1:32:43] we've done everything else but that yes
[1:32:46] look in jude 3 it talks about it how
[1:32:48] that they begin to drift away he said i
[1:32:50] gave all diligence to write unto you the
[1:32:52] common salvation it was needful for me
[1:32:55] to write up to you and exhort you that
[1:32:56] you should earnestly contend for the
[1:32:59] faith
[1:33:00] that was once delivered to the states
[1:33:01] this was just a few years yes after
[1:33:03] pentecost
[1:33:05] they got their eye on somebody else they
[1:33:08] got their eye on the world
[1:33:09] and the power that would come with it
[1:33:12] we don't need to get our eyes on power
[1:33:14] as preachers we don't need to get our
[1:33:16] eyes on power
[1:33:17] as a church we don't need to get our
[1:33:18] eyes on political power
[1:33:20] well if we come in and we could rally
[1:33:22] enough people we could take over the
[1:33:23] city of hardy whatever that would get
[1:33:25] you
[1:33:27] but we don't get our eyes on political
[1:33:29] power that's not my job
[1:33:31] it's not my job to get into politics not
[1:33:33] my job my job is to give attendance to
[1:33:35] prayer
[1:33:37] and to preaching the word
[1:33:39] right your job is to give attendance to
[1:33:40] prayer and to hearing the word
[1:33:43] are you with me now because that's what
[1:33:45] our salvation that's what our our our
[1:33:48] love for christ everything is based on
[1:33:50] that those are the things he told us to
[1:33:52] do that's our sacred trust
[1:33:54] he said nevertheless i have someone
[1:33:56] against me in revelation 2 4 speaking of
[1:33:58] that first age
[1:34:00] you said you've left your first love
[1:34:05] very quickly they left and become a
[1:34:06] roman church
[1:34:08] with roman ideas
[1:34:10] amen
[1:34:11] said you left that love that you once
[1:34:13] had for them good old-fashioned holy
[1:34:15] ghost meetings
[1:34:16] well i pray the lord i know it's
[1:34:18] mother's day but i pray the lord would
[1:34:20] speak to hearts today
[1:34:21] you used to love to go to church
[1:34:23] but you left that love and you begin to
[1:34:25] kind of slide backwards into formal come
[1:34:28] in with our father nonsense
[1:34:31] the fervent desire to please god
[1:34:33] the passion to know his word the cry for
[1:34:35] reaching out in the spirit
[1:34:37] all begins to fade
[1:34:39] instead of that church being on fire
[1:34:40] with the fire of god has cooled off
[1:34:42] become a bit formal yes
[1:34:44] just like it would happen with them with
[1:34:46] a wife and her husband yes
[1:34:48] think about it
[1:34:51] he's made every overture he sent
[1:34:53] messengers he sent prophets
[1:34:55] he'd come every way that he could you
[1:34:56] can't blame him
[1:35:00] yeah well somebody said that when we
[1:35:02] were young he said we used to ride
[1:35:03] together in a truck
[1:35:05] said we'd ride on the front seat used to
[1:35:06] be trucks had just a bent seat usually
[1:35:08] on the front that we'd ride on the front
[1:35:10] seat together he said and now we ride
[1:35:13] far apart a woman was telling her
[1:35:14] husband that kind of complaining about
[1:35:15] it he said well i didn't move
[1:35:21] but there's a lot of truth to that god
[1:35:24] didn't move
[1:35:25] if our love's not what it used to be if
[1:35:27] we're not as passionate about the gospel
[1:35:29] as we used to be if we begin to do
[1:35:31] things and and wear things and and allow
[1:35:33] our children to do things that we didn't
[1:35:34] used to do it hasn't it's not god that
[1:35:36] changed that's right yes sir right oh
[1:35:39] god
[1:35:41] he didn't change we change
[1:35:43] but if we change if he's still your
[1:35:45] husband today if he's still if he still
[1:35:48] has a love for you then you have an
[1:35:49] ability to love him back
[1:35:51] you can come back to him
[1:35:54] he'll take you back
[1:35:56] amen
[1:35:58] but the prep said notice what she loves
[1:36:00] watch your lover you want to see who she
[1:36:01] is in love with the word says this but
[1:36:04] my church says this
[1:36:06] then who is she in love with who is her
[1:36:08] husband her own fruits prove what she is
[1:36:12] refuse
[1:36:13] now look at this spiritual woman now
[1:36:15] spiritual church refuses to bear
[1:36:17] children
[1:36:18] just like the ones we talked about today
[1:36:19] motherhood is broken they want to do
[1:36:21] away with the babies
[1:36:23] abort the babies the median age now for
[1:36:26] having children i'm not telling you how
[1:36:27] old you have to be to have children i'm
[1:36:29] not saying anything about that but the
[1:36:31] median age now for having children is 30
[1:36:34] i believe the median age most
[1:36:36] children are born now to people in their
[1:36:38] 30s and 40s because when they're young
[1:36:41] they want to have time to do what they
[1:36:42] want to do
[1:36:44] and go get a career in things and i'll
[1:36:46] say again nothing wrong with that but i
[1:36:48] tell you what i'm so proud of some of
[1:36:49] you young mothers
[1:36:51] that have started families young
[1:36:53] and have raised families young and
[1:36:55] you're proving to the world that it can
[1:36:57] be done and that there's a job that's
[1:36:59] more important than the job that you
[1:37:00] have if you have one
[1:37:03] there's a job that's more important than
[1:37:05] than going out to some factory making
[1:37:07] money or going out to some office and
[1:37:08] making money but there's a job that you
[1:37:10] have with your children
[1:37:12] are you with me now and you're proven to
[1:37:14] a society that's lost its moral compass
[1:37:18] that's been invaded by the devil
[1:37:20] you've proven to them that there's some
[1:37:22] there's some
[1:37:23] christian ladies that'll still care for
[1:37:26] their children
[1:37:27] but this church refused to bear children
[1:37:29] for their spiritual husband christ
[1:37:30] because they're too busy flirting with
[1:37:32] the things of the world the brown said
[1:37:34] if a woman won't have a baby for her
[1:37:35] husband she'll take a dog or a cat or
[1:37:37] something boy i'm going to get in
[1:37:38] trouble
[1:37:41] she's got to my my daughter loves my
[1:37:43] oldest daughter loves dogs
[1:37:45] she absolutely loves dogs but but here
[1:37:49] he said and she got the mother something
[1:37:50] that she's not old enough to be a mother
[1:37:52] won't be for probably 20 more years so
[1:37:55] let's lay that in there as a dad you
[1:37:57] know
[1:38:00] she got the mother something that's one
[1:38:02] thing for a young a young person to want
[1:38:05] to have a dog or something to want a
[1:38:07] mother something
[1:38:08] it's her nature
[1:38:09] but to do that and to refuse to bear a
[1:38:12] child for her husband but to bear a
[1:38:13] child for her husband raise it to the
[1:38:14] service of god that's entirely out of
[1:38:16] her line so again not just having the
[1:38:18] baby but raise it for the service of god
[1:38:20] he said oh she'd be so disgraced if she
[1:38:22] did
[1:38:23] by her sin-loving society of this 1965
[1:38:27] how old does that sound
[1:38:32] think about it that's a long time ago
[1:38:36] and a prophet looking into the future
[1:38:38] described our world
[1:38:42] there's an ethical question you can ask
[1:38:43] yourself and i want you to think deeply
[1:38:45] about this
[1:38:46] an ethical question if your dog who you
[1:38:49] loved had been with you for years your
[1:38:50] loyal dog
[1:38:52] and a random stranger
[1:38:55] or just a random stranger he could be a
[1:38:57] serial killer
[1:38:58] he could be anything they were both out
[1:39:00] in the ocean or in a pond or in a lake
[1:39:02] drowning
[1:39:03] which one would you save
[1:39:07] think about it
[1:39:10] it would be immoral to choose the dog
[1:39:15] well i'm going to get myself in trouble
[1:39:17] but this is just basic life stuff
[1:39:20] it would be immoral to choose the dog my
[1:39:22] daughter kind of disagrees with me on
[1:39:24] this but
[1:39:25] it would be immoral to choose the dog
[1:39:27] over the human
[1:39:28] because they're human
[1:39:32] right we live in a world where that's
[1:39:33] changed
[1:39:36] where you you would get in more trouble
[1:39:39] putting your dog on a chain than you
[1:39:41] would a human
[1:39:44] right
[1:39:44] and people can raise their kids any way
[1:39:46] they want to and i watch some of them
[1:39:47] come in walmart sometimes
[1:39:50] you're going through walmart you see
[1:39:51] some funny things i like to watch people
[1:39:54] see them coming walmart and they're
[1:39:55] knocking their kids around right in
[1:39:56] public
[1:39:57] kids aren't dressed where where is the
[1:39:59] social service where's the people
[1:40:00] supposed to take care of this these kids
[1:40:02] obviously
[1:40:03] there's drugs in the home
[1:40:05] there's problems in the home and you
[1:40:07] look at that like how in the world they
[1:40:08] got alcohol on their breath stumbling to
[1:40:10] walmart
[1:40:11] buying stuff for themselves buying
[1:40:12] alcohol
[1:40:14] to taking care of that kid and think
[1:40:15] where is the parents
[1:40:18] if you did that to a dog you get in
[1:40:20] trouble
[1:40:22] god i pray god gets a hold of us today
[1:40:25] yeah but that would never slip into the
[1:40:27] church
[1:40:30] children matter
[1:40:33] children matter yes you have a pet and i
[1:40:36] believe they'll be in heaven praise god
[1:40:38] you know you have a pet that you love
[1:40:40] and everything that you love and all
[1:40:41] they ever loved you i understand all of
[1:40:42] that but that child is more important
[1:40:44] yes
[1:40:48] listen but that's the way the church is
[1:40:49] going
[1:40:50] they make the important thing the
[1:40:52] program
[1:40:54] the important thing is the building
[1:40:57] the important thing is the money or the
[1:40:59] suit that the pastor wears or the priest
[1:41:01] wears the important thing is the form of
[1:41:03] the ceremony
[1:41:05] and they forgot to mother the word
[1:41:09] listen brother said it's a true picture
[1:41:11] of the modern church today
[1:41:14] neither does the modern church want any
[1:41:16] of these here screaming shouting tongue
[1:41:18] speaking acts 238 youngins around her
[1:41:22] she don't want any of them whooping and
[1:41:24] crying and screaming amen hallelujah
[1:41:27] why such a child would immediately put
[1:41:28] her out of her denomination
[1:41:30] he said they had one like that in one of
[1:41:32] the churches why he'd throw they'd throw
[1:41:33] her out right quick why are you letting
[1:41:35] such stuff as this go along you see
[1:41:37] she's pregnant with something because
[1:41:38] she's bringing forth members all the
[1:41:40] time but she don't want none of them
[1:41:41] screaming hollering blabbering acts 2 38
[1:41:44] miserable creatures she thinks they are
[1:41:46] it would certainly embarrass her it
[1:41:47] would ruin her and her educated ethical
[1:41:49] scientific society church that she
[1:41:51] belonged to here they would throw her
[1:41:52] out at the next council she can't have
[1:41:54] it listen you might be embarrassed by it
[1:41:56] but there's only one way to be born and
[1:41:58] that's through a mess
[1:42:00] every birth is a mess you were born in a
[1:42:02] mess naturally and you're gonna it's
[1:42:04] gonna be a mess when you're born
[1:42:05] spiritually you gotta die to yourself
[1:42:07] there's a death that takes place and
[1:42:10] then a birth and there's a messy thing
[1:42:12] that goes on you might have you might
[1:42:13] cry you might weep you might shout no
[1:42:15] matter what you do but it's not in that
[1:42:17] but it's the fact that there's a birth
[1:42:19] taking place
[1:42:20] yes
[1:42:21] hey man but you don't want that she
[1:42:23] don't want birth
[1:42:25] she's too busy taking care of other
[1:42:26] things
[1:42:28] she don't want to be pregnant with the
[1:42:29] word
[1:42:31] because that's the only kind he said
[1:42:33] that the word can bring forth
[1:42:35] oh my
[1:42:37] born of the spirit of god it has the
[1:42:39] spirit of god in it no intellectual
[1:42:42] church joining creed going bobby here
[1:42:43] painted face there's no such thing as
[1:42:45] that in it all of it he said you don't
[1:42:47] find that in the word of god you find an
[1:42:48] old-fashioned sanctified holy
[1:42:50] ghost-filled child born of the spirit of
[1:42:52] god well i hope we have a few of them in
[1:42:54] here this morning born of the spirit of
[1:42:55] god screaming hollering shouting
[1:42:57] praising god he said that's all together
[1:42:59] out of the reach for her she don't want
[1:43:01] that
[1:43:02] that's right
[1:43:03] why mother had broken
[1:43:06] but the bible says in joel 2 25 i will
[1:43:08] restore to you the years
[1:43:12] yes
[1:43:13] everything that the cankerworm the
[1:43:14] locust the caterpillar the palmer worm
[1:43:16] everything that was taken away by that
[1:43:18] roman system everything that's been lost
[1:43:20] by the invasion are you with me today he
[1:43:22] said i will restore it
[1:43:25] you see motherhood is a scriptural
[1:43:26] principle
[1:43:27] beginning in the garden of eden and the
[1:43:29] promise was that the woman's seed would
[1:43:31] bruise the head of the serpent you see
[1:43:32] without a mother there could never be a
[1:43:34] savior
[1:43:35] that's why it's so important why we
[1:43:37] protect it so so so so tightly why we
[1:43:40] want our girls to raise up untouched by
[1:43:42] the world and the things of the world we
[1:43:44] want them to be right yes they'll make
[1:43:45] mistakes but it's a word that restores
[1:43:47] us back yes
[1:43:49] are you with me now
[1:43:51] it's a scriptural principle there had to
[1:43:53] be a mother to have a savior
[1:43:56] that's why satan hates it so much
[1:43:58] first timothy 2 12 says i suffer not a
[1:44:00] woman to teach nor do you serve
[1:44:01] authority over the man but to be in
[1:44:02] silence for adam was first formed and
[1:44:04] then eve he said brother ben that's hard
[1:44:06] but look why
[1:44:07] adam was not deceived but the woman
[1:44:09] being deceived was in the transgression
[1:44:11] but go on notwithstanding
[1:44:14] i love this
[1:44:16] because she was in the transgression she
[1:44:18] had to be the the the
[1:44:20] thing that god would work through
[1:44:23] to bring about redemption
[1:44:25] he couldn't do that throughout it belong
[1:44:28] are you with me now it had to be a
[1:44:30] mother
[1:44:32] and that's the redemption that he's
[1:44:33] bringing the final full redemption and
[1:44:35] this hour of the bride comes to the
[1:44:37] rapture of the church how does it come
[1:44:39] through the bride yes
[1:44:42] are you with me now
[1:44:43] hallelujah she produces a rapture
[1:44:46] right think about it
[1:44:49] it's in you already
[1:44:51] it comes through the mother
[1:44:53] he said notwithstanding she shall be
[1:44:54] saved in childbearing if they continue
[1:44:57] in faith and charity and holiness with
[1:44:59] sobriety now the catholic church takes
[1:45:00] that that she's saved by having kids but
[1:45:03] that's not what this means
[1:45:06] she's saved by childbearing not by
[1:45:07] having a baby mixer saved but because
[1:45:10] she's raising children
[1:45:12] doing her duty not raising cats dogs and
[1:45:14] want more to take the place of the child
[1:45:15] as they do today
[1:45:17] now watch and again take it back to mary
[1:45:20] mary was nursing her own salvation
[1:45:22] she was saved in childbearing yes
[1:45:26] if we could make it just elemental
[1:45:28] elementary where it would apply to men
[1:45:29] and women you're saved by by believing
[1:45:32] the word and by doing it yes
[1:45:35] are you with me now you're saved by
[1:45:37] believing the word and by doing it by
[1:45:38] being a mother you never thought about
[1:45:40] that but you're working out your own
[1:45:41] salvation with fear and trembling just
[1:45:43] by living and i recognize that the blood
[1:45:45] of christ has to come in you to want to
[1:45:47] do that
[1:45:48] and there has to be the spirit of god to
[1:45:50] want to do that you'll never do it on
[1:45:51] your own but you mothers that are in
[1:45:53] church and maybe you're sitting in the
[1:45:55] nursery today and you're saying about
[1:45:56] you struggle with your kids all the time
[1:45:58] and you think what am i doing i i can't
[1:46:00] even hear half of the sermon i don't
[1:46:01] understand what's going on do you
[1:46:03] realize what you're doing yes you're
[1:46:05] raising by doing what god called you to
[1:46:07] do as a mother by being what god called
[1:46:09] you to be as a mother you're raising
[1:46:10] you're nursing your own salvation
[1:46:14] yeah
[1:46:15] oh god
[1:46:17] and who had more impact someone said
[1:46:19] thomas edison you know someone's
[1:46:21] commenting he said well boy you've had a
[1:46:23] great such a great impact on science
[1:46:26] he said who had more impact me or my
[1:46:28] mother
[1:46:29] he said because when i was a child
[1:46:31] the teacher sent me home said this boy
[1:46:32] is dumb
[1:46:34] he'll never be able to learn
[1:46:37] oh my but his mother said he's not dumb
[1:46:39] i'll teach him myself
[1:46:41] and she taught him and brought him up
[1:46:43] and he become the inventor of the light
[1:46:44] bulb and so many things that we take for
[1:46:46] granted in this modern society today who
[1:46:48] was greater
[1:46:50] listen the one that nursed him
[1:46:52] yeah oh god by just doing what you do
[1:46:55] you see the gospel isn't some great
[1:46:57] thing somewhere
[1:46:58] but just by doing what you do you're
[1:47:00] working out your own salvation
[1:47:03] you're living out the acts of jesus
[1:47:05] christ on the earth
[1:47:08] oh my
[1:47:09] not just when you go to meetings
[1:47:11] not just when you go not just when
[1:47:13] you're in church even but when you're at
[1:47:15] home washing the dishes yes men or women
[1:47:18] by the way
[1:47:20] we'll be egalitarian we'll we'll just
[1:47:22] spread that all around
[1:47:25] when you're at home washing the dishes
[1:47:26] if you're helping your wife or you're
[1:47:28] the one that's doing it all the time
[1:47:30] but put it that way
[1:47:32] huh you're working at your salvation
[1:47:37] well i take my wife and do something for
[1:47:39] her for mother's day and my wife
[1:47:40] mother's day and our anniversary and our
[1:47:42] uh her birthday all comes up within a
[1:47:44] few days of each other and so what i do
[1:47:46] is usually i'll take her somewhere and
[1:47:48] i'm going to take her to jonesboro maybe
[1:47:50] and do some shopping and stuff i'm
[1:47:51] working out my salvation yeah
[1:47:53] because i can't preach without a wife
[1:47:56] sure can't pastor
[1:47:57] you
[1:47:58] or you hear me it's that simple
[1:48:01] when you mean go to work
[1:48:03] you work with your hands work out in the
[1:48:05] field work on the tractors work it work
[1:48:07] in the factory you're working out your
[1:48:09] own salvation
[1:48:10] because he said a man that don't work
[1:48:12] shouldn't eat
[1:48:14] and a man that won't provide for his
[1:48:15] family is worse than an
[1:48:16] infidel that's right
[1:48:19] and so it's not just not by just having
[1:48:21] a baby made or saved but because she was
[1:48:23] a mother
[1:48:24] oh my simply by doing your duty you're
[1:48:26] working out your salvation but i want to
[1:48:28] tell you this morning that motherhood
[1:48:30] has been restored by the message of the
[1:48:32] hour
[1:48:33] malachi 4 did his job
[1:48:36] said behold i send you elijah the
[1:48:37] prophet before the coming of the great
[1:48:38] and dreadful day of the lord he shall
[1:48:40] turn the hearts of the children to the
[1:48:41] fathers and the heart the heart of the
[1:48:42] fathers to the children and the heart of
[1:48:44] the children to the fathers let's not
[1:48:45] come and smite the earth with a curse
[1:48:48] there had to be a restoration
[1:48:50] amen a heart turning not a head turning
[1:48:52] but a heart turning look at ephesians 5
[1:48:55] 25 said husbands love your wives even as
[1:48:57] christ also loved the church he said
[1:49:00] here's how you're supposed to love your
[1:49:01] wife as christ loved the church and gave
[1:49:03] himself you give yourself sacrificially
[1:49:06] to your wife yes you gave yourself he
[1:49:09] gave himself for it that he might
[1:49:11] sanctify it and cleanse it with the
[1:49:13] washing of water by the word that he
[1:49:15] might present it to himself a glorious
[1:49:17] church not having spot or wrinkle or any
[1:49:19] such thing but that it should be holy
[1:49:21] and without blemish listen motherhood
[1:49:23] restored means you he restores the
[1:49:25] potential your potentials to be pure
[1:49:27] again so he can marry you
[1:49:30] he couldn't do that with you as a sinner
[1:49:32] you were lost you were outside the
[1:49:34] economy of god but he comes himself
[1:49:37] with his sacrificial love and produces a
[1:49:40] way through the blood so that you can
[1:49:42] come back
[1:49:43] right
[1:49:44] you thought this was a hard sermon this
[1:49:46] morning but it's not listen if you've
[1:49:48] fallen from your place as a son or
[1:49:49] daughter of god there's a way back
[1:49:52] christ has to marry a bride with your
[1:49:54] sacred virtues intact how's he gonna do
[1:49:56] that because we're all born in sin we're
[1:49:58] all shaping in iniquity how's he gonna
[1:50:00] marry a bride who's clean and pure and a
[1:50:02] virgin spiritually speaking how's he
[1:50:04] gonna marry a bride like that he has to
[1:50:06] marry someone who he has washed
[1:50:08] who he has cleansed
[1:50:11] hallelujah
[1:50:13] oh my lord
[1:50:16] i was not eligible to be to his wife
[1:50:19] i can't even say that word i was not
[1:50:20] eligible to be his wife
[1:50:23] i had marred my spiritual virtue by sin
[1:50:25] but he restored my eligibility
[1:50:30] and made it as though i'd never done it
[1:50:33] i want you to listen before i close
[1:50:36] what he says about you and points
[1:50:38] directly to you now
[1:50:40] as the bride of jesus christ
[1:50:42] as we close this mother's day service
[1:50:44] today
[1:50:45] he says this is the opening of the seven
[1:50:47] seals
[1:50:49] he says i know it sounds strange to you
[1:50:51] but god has vindicated it so perfectly
[1:50:53] there's no question
[1:50:55] in it
[1:50:56] and so he ties it back what was it the
[1:50:58] restoration of the word would come to
[1:51:01] bring a spiritual union between the
[1:51:03] bride and the bridegroom
[1:51:04] he said he the bridegroom took away your
[1:51:06] shame and put it in the sea of
[1:51:08] forgetfulness by the washing of the
[1:51:10] water of the word and the blood of life
[1:51:13] listen as i'm skipping through this now
[1:51:15] but i just want to get the main points
[1:51:16] too you are standing if you're standing
[1:51:19] on god's word and with god's word every
[1:51:21] amen every jot every tittle where are
[1:51:23] you standing
[1:51:25] if you're standing today you're a mother
[1:51:27] doing it to your best to your ability
[1:51:28] what you know to do by the word if
[1:51:30] you're a father doing what you know to
[1:51:31] do by the word if you're a person in the
[1:51:33] church doing maybe you made many
[1:51:35] mistakes in the past but you're standing
[1:51:37] today having been transformed by the
[1:51:38] blood of jesus christ and you're doing
[1:51:40] everything you know to do you're
[1:51:42] standing complete
[1:51:44] justified like you never did it in the
[1:51:46] first place
[1:51:48] hallelujah you are the pure virtuous
[1:51:52] sinless bride of the son of the living
[1:51:54] god

[1:51:57] you are they say you should find out who
[1:51:59] you are find out who you are about what
[1:52:01] you think find out who you are by what
[1:52:02] you read by what you see on tv no he
[1:52:05] says i'll tell you what you are you are
[1:52:07] standing completely justified you are
[1:52:09] the pure virtuous sinless bride of the
[1:52:11] son of the living god
[1:52:12] he said every man and woman that's born
[1:52:14] of the spirit of god and washed in the
[1:52:16] blood of jesus christ and believes every
[1:52:17] word of god stands as though you never
[1:52:19] sinned at the first place you are
[1:52:21] perfect
[1:52:23] hear me today the world may say you're
[1:52:25] not perfect even other people in the
[1:52:27] church might look at you and say you're
[1:52:28] not perfect but that's what you was
[1:52:30] yesterday but you come to god i don't
[1:52:32] care if you were baptized last week i
[1:52:34] don't care if you come to god a year ago
[1:52:36] or 30 years ago and you've made many
[1:52:38] mistakes maybe in your life but you are
[1:52:40] perfect today
[1:52:42] you are perfect oh do we believe it
[1:52:44] today
[1:52:44] he said oh that spiritual union of
[1:52:46] christ in his church now when the flesh
[1:52:48] is becoming word and the word is
[1:52:50] becoming flesh manifested vindicated
[1:52:53] just what the bible said would happen in
[1:52:54] this day it's happening day by day
[1:52:57] you never sinned at the first place

[1:53:01] it's in the sea of forgetfulness you
[1:53:03] never did it you were accused of it by
[1:53:05] the accuser but really from the
[1:53:07] beginning you were predestinated to be a
[1:53:09] son and daughter of god yes
[1:53:11] you are the virtuous bride of jesus
[1:53:13] christ
[1:53:14] he said you're standing there washed
[1:53:15] your book of divorcement is put away
[1:53:17] it's dead absolutely out of existence
[1:53:19] even in the mind of god you're the
[1:53:20] virtuous bride of christ washed in the
[1:53:22] blood of christ precious virtuous

[1:58:19] morning
[1:58:20] sometimes we talk about these things and
[1:58:21] people feel bad because they're
[1:58:23] identified maybe maybe now maybe in the
[1:58:25] past with some of those things and it
[1:58:27] makes them feel bad
[1:58:28] but paul goes down the list of every sin
[1:58:30] you can think of
[1:58:32] in first corinthians six but then he
[1:58:33] gets to verse 11 he said and such were
[1:58:36] some of you
[1:58:38] oh such worth some of you but you are
[1:58:41] washed
[1:58:43] but you are sanctified
[1:58:45] but you are justified in the name of the
[1:58:47] lord jesus and by the spirit of our god
[1:58:51] you've been pardoned yesterday i was
[1:58:53] under judgment yesterday i was not free
[1:58:56] but today i am free
[1:58:58] today i am not a sinner i am a sinless
[1:59:01] son or daughter of god
[1:59:04] oh my
[1:59:05] oh my
[1:59:07] bow your heads with me for a moment
[1:59:12] such were some of you
[1:59:14] but you can wash
[1:59:17] if you've never been washed today would
[1:59:18] be a good day
[1:59:19] on mother's day
[1:59:22] to begin to mother the word in your life
[1:59:25] to begin to care about it
[1:59:27] to have
[1:59:28] compassion for the word i don't we don't
[1:59:31] believe what we believe because we don't
[1:59:32] have compassion on others we want the
[1:59:34] whole world to be saved because that's
[1:59:36] the attribute of god
[1:59:38] but we do what we do because we have
[1:59:40] compassion for the word
[1:59:42] we love the word
[1:59:43] because it was the word that meant for
[1:59:45] us
[1:59:46] the word that died for us the word is
[1:59:48] not just a letter but the word is a
[1:59:50] person
[1:59:51] you see why you can't talk us out of
[1:59:52] that you're never going to tell me jesus
[1:59:54] isn't god because the word in the
[1:59:56] beginning was the word and the word was
[1:59:58] with god and the word was god the word
[2:00:00] is a person
[2:00:02] and the word washed me from my sin
[2:00:05] the word has made me free
[2:00:06] if you're not standing free today would
[2:00:08] you just talk to him it only takes a
[2:00:09] moment
[2:00:10] just reach out to him where you're at
[2:00:11] today and talk to him the altar is open
[2:00:13] if you want to come but you can reach
[2:00:15] out to him right where you are and say
[2:00:16] lord
[2:00:17] forgive me of my sins
[2:00:19] let me know i've been washed by your
[2:00:20] blood fill me with the holy ghost
[2:00:23] let me have a desire to serve you all
[2:00:25] the days of my life
