[1:05:02] collar bone and they took me inside the

[1:08:07] Lord because it's really just the only
[1:08:09] kind I can bring but may you just take
[1:08:11] it and break it to the hearts of your
[1:08:13] children that they may understand God oh
[1:08:15] gr Lord not only who you are but we may

[1:08:32] well I pray father May that same
[1:08:35] anointing that raised my Lord from the
[1:08:37] grave May that same anointing that
[1:08:39] raised Jessica up and gave her back to

[1:08:47] that when we leave the building may we

[1:08:52] the way bless my Minister and brothers
[1:08:54] Lord I ask God you give them a special
[1:08:57] anointing use them in a mighty way Lord

[1:09:02] God oh gr until then Lord may we be
[1:09:05] faithful for we ask these things in
[1:09:07] Jesus name and the bride says amen amen
[1:09:10] God bless you you may be seated you know
[1:09:13] Eternal means without a beginning and
[1:09:15] without an end which has always been
[1:09:19] which has always been and which will
[1:09:21] always be which has always been which is
[1:09:25] always be I want to start with this
[1:09:26] quote right here I got a few quotes
[1:09:28] tonight if you don't mind me reading
[1:09:29] them but the prophet of God says he said
[1:09:31] I thought tonight that I would talk on
[1:09:33] faith for a little while just to build
[1:09:35] you up on Christian faith and I found
[1:09:38] out that one of the greatest hindrances
[1:09:40] that the church has got today is that
[1:09:42] you're scared to
[1:09:44] death and what are you scared about
[1:09:46] that's what I'm wondering if you'll just
[1:09:48] only realize who you are you don't know
[1:09:52] who you are you don't know who that is
[1:09:54] sitting next to you you say oh yeah
[1:09:56] that's my neighbor I know him all right
[1:09:58] but he's a Son of God see that's right
[1:10:00] adopted by Jesus Christ into the family
[1:10:03] and that's a daughter of God sitting
[1:10:04] next to you and who are you if you're a
[1:10:07] Christian a Believer you're a son and a
[1:10:09] daughter of God then if we're Sons and
[1:10:12] Daughters of God what are we scared
[1:10:15] about huh what are we scared about amen
[1:10:18] there's no need of being scared as long
[1:10:21] as the devil can keep you scared that's
[1:10:25] all he wants to do he's got you right
[1:10:30] then then friends it's no mystery to us
[1:10:32] that we're living in a phobic age
[1:10:35] Islamic phobia lettuce phobia fireworks
[1:10:37] phobia Everybody's scared to death of
[1:10:40] everything men's hearts are failing for
[1:10:44] fear that that's there but in this hour
[1:10:46] the prophet of God said that may be for
[1:10:48] them but it don't have to be for you
[1:10:51] we've got nothing to be scared about our
[1:10:52] Daddy has got it all in control right
[1:10:56] but as long as he can keep you scared
[1:10:58] that's all he wants to do he's got you
[1:11:01] right then so then while was thinking
[1:11:03] along those lines of amnesia amnesia is
[1:11:06] the loss of a memory of not knowing who
[1:11:08] you are so Amnesia feeds
[1:11:14] fear Amnesia that's why you see people
[1:11:16] in nursing home with Alzheimer's they de
[1:11:18] sometimes they get so violent is because
[1:11:21] they don't understand what's happening
[1:11:23] to them right come on my daddy had
[1:11:27] Alzheimer's we lost him a few year ago
[1:11:30] and Alzheimer's is a tragic thing
[1:11:33] because you lose them twice
[1:11:35] right you lose them when they get it
[1:11:38] then you lose it when they
[1:11:40] cross and so the last few time of my
[1:11:44] daddy's life we had to put him into a
[1:11:46] special unit that would equi to take
[1:11:48] care of him and they was having a a
[1:11:51] party and so I had come in from a
[1:11:53] meeting and I I went over to be with my
[1:11:55] daddy and I rode him into a room yeah
[1:11:59] yeah and so the they were passing out
[1:12:02] gifts and they said James Elbert
[1:12:05] [Applause]
[1:12:07] Ward but my daddy never
[1:12:13] moved cuz he didn't know who he
[1:12:16] was that's right and I said Daddy you
[1:12:19] better raise up here buddy they they got
[1:12:21] a gift for you it's got your name on it
[1:12:24] it belongs to you you better get up and
[1:12:27] look at
[1:12:28] it but he never
[1:12:31] moved yeah cuz he didn't
[1:12:33] know who he
[1:12:36] was and I said over here ma'am and I
[1:12:40] took the gift and opened it for my
[1:12:42] daddy you said why do you say all that
[1:12:44] why was you telling us that yeah because
[1:12:47] I want you to understand come on that
[1:12:50] God's going to speak to you service
[1:12:52] after service this week amen but no
[1:12:55] matter how great the word is no matter
[1:12:57] how rich the anointing is no matter how
[1:13:00] tremendous the Revelation would be if
[1:13:03] you don't believe it's for you it will
[1:13:06] do you no
[1:13:09] good Amnesia produces fear but knowing
[1:13:13] who you are will produce perfect
[1:13:16] faith for the prophet of God said Jesus
[1:13:19] had perfect Faith because he knew who he
[1:13:21] was in the word so when you know what
[1:13:24] the word word is saying about you you
[1:13:26] can have the confidence that God's word
[1:13:29] will not
[1:13:30] fail well brother darl I don't feel like
[1:13:33] it he never said did you feel it but he
[1:13:35] did say did you believe it and if you
[1:13:38] start believing it you might actually
[1:13:40] feel
[1:13:40] [Applause]
[1:13:46] it now brother bam told several
[1:13:49] times a story an illustration about a
[1:13:52] box of
[1:13:53] rattlesnakes right he said if someone
[1:13:55] come up this morning to your door an
[1:13:57] Express agent today we'd say FedEx or
[1:14:00] prime you know or Amazon but if someone
[1:14:04] come up to your door and they had a box
[1:14:06] of
[1:14:07] rattlesnakes and it had your name on it
[1:14:10] yeah and they said here you are they're
[1:14:13] yours come on you see the rattlesnakes
[1:14:17] you hear the rattlesnakes you know
[1:14:19] they're there just like your symptoms
[1:14:21] our symptoms we know they're there
[1:14:26] if you receive them rattlesnakes they're
[1:14:31] yours but you don't have to take
[1:14:34] them you can say I don't want them and
[1:14:37] the angel will say but your name is on
[1:14:39] the
[1:14:40] package but you say I don't want them I
[1:14:43] won't have them and he will do
[1:14:45] everything he can to make you take
[1:14:49] them now in one sense they're yours but
[1:14:53] in another sense they're not
[1:14:56] you might see all the symptoms the devil
[1:14:58] said here's your cancer here's your
[1:15:00] heart trouble here's your
[1:15:02] condition but it's not yours till you
[1:15:05] sign for
[1:15:06] [Music]
[1:15:07] it if you refuse to sign for them he has
[1:15:11] to take them back to the express agent

[1:19:23] important you are yeah or how
[1:19:25] unimportant you are you are here to
[1:19:29] serve a
[1:19:31] purpose just as my finger is here for a
[1:19:33] purpose and my nail on my finger is here
[1:19:37] for a purpose my eye and every part of
[1:19:40] my body is to serve a
[1:19:44] purpose now my finger may not be as
[1:19:46] important as my eye but you lose a
[1:19:49] finger and see how your thumb will
[1:19:50] struggle that's right amen so whether
[1:19:53] we're the biggest one or the littlest
[1:19:54] one if we're a part of the body we're

[1:20:01] of Christ you are
[1:20:03] needed yes sir amen my fingernail
[1:20:07] wouldn't just put on my finger just to

[1:20:16] God's divine
[1:20:19] plan to put a fingernail on my finger
[1:20:24] and if we're here put here for a purpose
[1:20:26] yeah then there is nothing that can
[1:20:30] destroy nothing can destroy us until
[1:20:34] God's purpose is
[1:20:36] [Applause]
[1:20:37] fulfilled are you hearing me
[1:20:39] tonight we're not a weak feeble bunch of
[1:20:42] people we are the Overcomers of
[1:20:47] Leonia nothing can harm us until the
[1:20:50] purpose that God has put us here has
[1:20:52] been made manifest
[1:20:55] no matter how much trouble we have how
[1:20:57] much heartache we have or sorrow that we
[1:20:59] go through all these are for a
[1:21:02] reason but nothing you face in life will
[1:21:05] defeat the purpose that God has purposed
[1:21:08] for your life right all right oh yeah
[1:21:12] are you hearing me that tonight well
[1:21:14] brother I'm going through a hard time
[1:21:15] I'm not belittling that but I'm here to
[1:21:17] tell you no matter how hard the trial is
[1:21:20] it will not defeat the purpose
[1:21:26] am the undefeatable Eternal purpose of
[1:21:29] God will not be defeated it will not be
[1:21:36] defeated go with me a minute in your
[1:21:38] mind let's just take a little
[1:21:43] trip before there was an
[1:21:45] angel a star a
[1:21:48] planet there was no air there was no
[1:21:51] lights come on there was no world there
[1:21:56] was no nothing
[1:21:58] else except
[1:22:00] God and he wasn't even really God
[1:22:03] because God is an object of worship so
[1:22:05] it's just a self-existing one that we
[1:22:08] call God Ella eloh which means the
[1:22:12] self-existing one nothing there was
[1:22:14] nothing else existed but him right and
[1:22:18] the self-existing one that we call God
[1:22:20] but before there was anything to worship
[1:22:22] him he was a self existing one and the
[1:22:25] self-existing being had a desire he had
[1:22:28] a purpose something that he wanted to
[1:22:31] achieve and he purposed within himself
[1:22:33] that he would do this
[1:22:36] thing and he spoke let there be light
[1:22:39] and there was light because he purposed
[1:22:42] it and when he spoke oh God the darkness
[1:22:46] could not stop the light from coming
[1:22:50] forth thank you Lord how mysterious it
[1:22:53] seems God always keeps his word God will
[1:22:57] not make a promise that he can't keep
[1:23:00] come on God being infinite he knows all
[1:23:02] things he knows the future from the
[1:23:04] beginning he don't make a promise unless
[1:23:06] he knows what's going to
[1:23:08] happen and he always keeps his
[1:23:11] promise God Don't Make A Promise unless
[1:23:14] he knows he's going to keep
[1:23:17] it yes sir God purposed within himself
[1:23:20] to prove his word to be true am
[1:23:25] oh thank you
[1:23:26] Lord now think about this I do not
[1:23:30] believe God heals people just to show
[1:23:32] his power that's
[1:23:36] right but I believe he he heals people
[1:23:39] to show that he fulfills his word and
[1:23:42] keeps his
[1:23:45] promise matter of fact the prophet of
[1:23:47] God said Jesus never healed the sick to
[1:23:49] show his power he healed the sick to
[1:23:50] fulfill the
[1:23:53] scripture when he came on the earth the
[1:23:55] first time he said Hallelujah that it
[1:23:58] might be fulfilled which was spoken by
[1:24:00] the
[1:24:01] prophets what did he come to do to
[1:24:04] fulfill the prophet's
[1:24:06] [Applause]
[1:24:08] prophecies write this on your
[1:24:10] refrigerator all God's word must be
[1:24:16] fulfilled Hallelujah yes
[1:24:19] sir Lord amen I'm just laying a little
[1:24:21] bit of Step
[1:24:22] here you see God purpose can never be
[1:24:25] defeated there's nothing that can defeat
[1:24:30] it how happy we ought to
[1:24:34] be are you
[1:24:36] happy sure to let your face
[1:24:41] know we are to be the happiest people on
[1:24:46] Earth because we understand this this is
[1:24:49] not a mystery to
[1:24:50] [Applause]
[1:24:53] us how happy we are to be resting upon
[1:24:56] the beautiful revelation of the word of
[1:24:58] the Living God there's neither things
[1:25:00] present there's neither things that can
[1:25:01] come there's no sickness there's no
[1:25:03] sorrow there's no death there's no
[1:25:05] perils there's nothing that can separate
[1:25:08] us from the purpose of the Living God
[1:25:11] what God has imagined in his mind what
[1:25:13] God has purposed in his heart to bring
[1:25:15] the past there is no demon there is no
[1:25:18] power there is nothing that can ever
[1:25:20] separate God's Great Immortal eternal
[1:25:27] plan hey devil in case you didn't know
[1:25:30] you
[1:25:34] lose it must be as God have
[1:25:38] said because what did God say my word
[1:25:41] will not return unto me
[1:25:43] void but it will accomplish that which
[1:25:45] it was sent to do so if God said it
[1:25:49] he'll do
[1:25:52] it God said let virgin conceive and
[1:25:55] bring forth a child and it was as God
[1:25:59] said God said behold I send you Elijah
[1:26:02] before the great and Dreadful day of the
[1:26:03] Lord and it was as God
[1:26:06] said God said there'll be a
[1:26:11] bride she will be bone of my bone Flesh
[1:26:14] of My Flesh Spirit of my spirit she is
[1:26:17] him and it is as God have said h
[1:26:24] well you reckon when the bride's going
[1:26:25] to come she's been
[1:26:29] here in 1964 five stars lined up and the
[1:26:33] prophet said it was the announcement of
[1:26:35] the Bride of the Earth in
[1:26:37] infancy that what has happened since 64
[1:26:41] somebody has grown up somebody has
[1:26:43] matured somebody knows what he wants
[1:26:46] done with the word somebody can make
[1:26:48] that word live
[1:26:55] thank you
[1:26:57] Lord do you think our heavenly father
[1:26:59] will defeated in his purpose even though
[1:27:02] Satan has done what he's done it's an
[1:27:06] impossibility God will not be defeated
[1:27:10] and he's given us perfect
[1:27:13] Assurance thank you
[1:27:15] Lord that we don't have to be scared
[1:27:18] about
[1:27:21] nothing I seen a sign the other day I
[1:27:23] thought it was so good said this nation
[1:27:25] don't need a donkey or an elephant
[1:27:27] that's right it needs to go back to the
[1:27:37] lamb what the god what the father has
[1:27:41] purposed in your
[1:27:43] life can never be
[1:27:48] defeated what are you saying brother
[1:27:50] Daryl I'm telling you look in the back
[1:27:52] of the book you win
[1:27:57] I think of David David was anointed
[1:27:59] think about this now David was anointed
[1:28:02] by the great prophet Samuel to be king
[1:28:06] so God sent David a prophet with a
[1:28:08] message all right come on that told
[1:28:10] David who he was right and what his
[1:28:13] future would
[1:28:17] be he sent a prophet with a message with
[1:28:21] an anointing to tell David right
[1:28:27] who he was and what his future will
[1:28:31] be now I looked at up Scholars said that
[1:28:33] David was probably between the ages of
[1:28:36] 10 and
[1:28:38] 15 when the God sent the prophet to his
[1:28:43] house what does that tell you young
[1:28:45] people you don't have to wait till
[1:28:46] you're
[1:28:47] old you can find God while you're
[1:28:52] young sir
[1:28:55] Hallelujah David just a boy and he
[1:29:00] called out into battle and he stands
[1:29:03] before Goliath who is 9' n in
[1:29:09] tall and Saul tells
[1:29:12] David you're just a
[1:29:15] youth come on think about it King Saul
[1:29:19] Who David no doubt looked up
[1:29:21] to and his own King was of discouraging
[1:29:25] from the
[1:29:26] battle sometimes our greatest
[1:29:28] discouragement comes from those that are
[1:29:30] around us but if you know who you are
[1:29:33] and you know what you're called to do
[1:29:35] don't listen to the
[1:29:41] critics amen he said you're just a boy
[1:29:45] yeah come on you just need to calm down
[1:29:47] a little bit all right but when he seen
[1:29:49] that he wasn't going to deter David he
[1:29:51] said here take my helmet take my shield
[1:29:54] take my
[1:29:55] sword and David thought if they're so
[1:29:57] good why don't you use them come on
[1:30:00] that's
[1:30:02] right but David said I've not tried any
[1:30:05] of
[1:30:06] that but the one who anointed
[1:30:10] me the one who called me he told me what
[1:30:13] to
[1:30:13] [Applause]
[1:30:15] do so says David you're just a youth and
[1:30:18] Goliath he's been a warrior since his
[1:30:20] youth not only is he a warrior he's a
[1:30:23] champion
[1:30:24] he's got
[1:30:30] trophies but David come on oh God give
[1:30:35] us some
[1:30:37] davidl that giant stood before David
[1:30:41] Goliath's problem was he didn't see the
[1:30:44] God who stood behind
[1:30:47] David if Goliath had saw the god that
[1:30:49] stood behind him he would have been on
[1:30:51] his knees
[1:30:54] come on for God done said to David you
[1:30:57] will reign as a
[1:31:00] king then how can he die by the hand of
[1:31:03] a giant as a boy and reign as a
[1:31:12] king how so what did David do what every
[1:31:15] one of us must do he took what God Said
[1:31:19] over what he
[1:31:21] felt right
[1:31:24] amen so David took God at his word and
[1:31:27] as far as the word was concerned Goliath
[1:31:30] Was Defeated Hallelujah before the
[1:31:33] battle ever
[1:31:35] [Applause]
[1:31:36] started glory to God oh bless the Lord
[1:31:39] because God's purpose for David's life
[1:31:42] could not be defeated that's right by a
[1:31:44] giant that's right and God's purpose for
[1:31:47] your life cannot be defeated by that
[1:31:50] giant of fear and oppression
[1:31:54] come on that giant that tells you God
[1:31:56] don't love you don't care for you you're
[1:31:57] not part of it you need to tell that
[1:31:59] giant who your God is you need to tell
[1:32:03] that giant God sent a prophet to me with
[1:32:05] a message and that message told me not
[1:32:08] only who I am but what my future is the
[1:32:11] message has told us what our future is
[1:32:13] we're not going down we're going up
[1:32:15] we're going up we're going
[1:32:20] up Hallelujah yes sir sh Jack a Bendigo
[1:32:25] heated up that furn seven times hter
[1:32:27] than it ever been heated
[1:32:29] before come on my good and they said we
[1:32:32] don't know whether God will delivers but
[1:32:34] there's one thing we do know he is able
[1:32:36] to do it our God is able to deliver us
[1:32:40] but
[1:32:41] nonetheless we will not bow
[1:32:44] Hallelujah we will not bow to the
[1:32:52] image you see God had someone who would
[1:32:56] serve you and his purpose would not be
[1:33:01] defeated the fire cannot defeat the
[1:33:04] purpose of God's plan hope prop said I
[1:33:06] love to say this this morning all the
[1:33:08] hydrogen bombs in the world can never
[1:33:10] defeat the resurrection of the church
[1:33:12] all the explaining way all the
[1:33:14] mathematics and so forth all the
[1:33:15] intellectual world has disguised to
[1:33:17] purpose to do something to destroy the
[1:33:19] faith of God's children all this trash
[1:33:21] on the internet believe the sign don't
[1:33:23] believe the all the mathematics all
[1:33:25] they're adding up what is it nothing but
[1:33:27] tactics of the devil to D down your
[1:33:29] faith but remember God sent you a
[1:33:32] prophet with a
[1:33:36] message but all their tactics all their
[1:33:39] mathematics all their intelligence it
[1:33:42] will never it will never do
[1:33:46] it faith will live on
[1:33:51] forever faith will live on
[1:33:58] forever
[1:34:00] hallelujah thank Moses he was taught in
[1:34:03] all the wisdom of
[1:34:05] Egypt but he knew God had a purpose in
[1:34:08] his life that's right and it was his
[1:34:10] mama yed who took her darling baby
[1:34:15] Prophet a Prett little baby in all the
[1:34:16] world at that time a sweet little fella
[1:34:18] and put him in an ark and shoved him out
[1:34:21] into the Nile where crocodiles was fat
[1:34:24] on little Hebrew
[1:34:29] children think about that for a minute
[1:34:31] mother put her son in a basket and
[1:34:34] pushed him into the Nile where the
[1:34:36] crocodiles were fat right on Hebrew
[1:34:41] children all
[1:34:42] right they' been feeding them to the
[1:34:44] crocodiles left and right and she took
[1:34:47] her baby and shoved it right out into
[1:34:48] the jaws of death why would she do that
[1:34:53] why would a do that because she knew
[1:34:56] that God's purpose would not be
[1:35:01] defeated she said God of Abraham take
[1:35:03] care of my child bring you to the
[1:35:05] purpose you brought him for there wasn't
[1:35:07] enough water in the Nile to drown him
[1:35:09] there was enough crocodiles in all the
[1:35:10] world that could have swallowed him he
[1:35:12] was God's chosen he was God's chosen for
[1:35:14] that purpose and we are God's chosen
[1:35:17] today who believe in the resurrection of
[1:35:20] the Lord Jesus
[1:35:22] [Music]
[1:35:24] they can call us cult manf followers
[1:35:26] whatever they want to do but they will
[1:35:28] never defeat
[1:35:29] [Applause]
[1:35:33] us there's no
[1:35:37] bombs there's no
[1:35:39] hell there's no nothing that can destroy
[1:35:43] God's purpose we got to go in the
[1:35:46] resurrection it's a promise we have of
[1:35:52] God God's UND defeatable Eternal
[1:35:58] purpose he's got it all in
[1:36:01] control he's got it all in
[1:36:04] control he put that
[1:36:06] reassurance way down in my
[1:36:10] soul think about it yeah Moses on the
[1:36:13] back side of the desert they let him
[1:36:16] hear the screams and the haunts and the
[1:36:18] staggered in the wilderness that's right
[1:36:21] back there along in the desert and the
[1:36:22] Hing winds and the Scorpions in the
