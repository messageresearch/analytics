[50:36] Romans 10:17.
[50:38] So then faith cometh by hearing and
[50:41] hearing by the word of God. Amen. Luke
[50:46] 17 and5
[50:49] and the apostles said unto the Lord
[50:52] increase our faith.
[50:54] And the Lord said, "If you had faith as
[50:58] a grain of a mustard seed, you might say
[51:02] to this psychamine tree, be thou plucked
[51:04] up by the root and be thou planted in
[51:07] the sea, and it should obey you." Amen.
[51:11] God bless you. You can have your seats
[51:13] this evening.
[51:17] My title's so long I can't remember it
[51:19] tonight.
[51:25] It's hard to get old, isn't it? There it
[51:28] is. Faith received by hearing the word
[51:31] and increased by signs of his presence.
[51:35] I want us to think about that tonight as
[51:37] we as we hear the word and just trust
[51:39] we'll have a wonderful time in the Lord.
[51:42] Faith is the foundation of everything.
[51:45] How many know that tonight?
[51:47] Faith is the foundation of everything.
[51:49] And that faith is given by God. Before
[51:54] we get started, Brother Joel, did you
[51:55] announce Sunday what we're doing Sunday?
[51:58] Uh sorry, we're just we're just flying
[52:00] by the seat of our pants here tonight.
[52:02] So y'all, uh Sunday, we're we're having
[52:05] one service and then our second service,
[52:09] uh we we want you to be here. If you
[52:11] can, we're going to have a very special
[52:12] time. We're going to clean the church in
[52:14] the fellowship hall. So, anybody that
[52:16] can be here and help us with that after
[52:18] we eat, we'll eat like we normally do.
[52:20] If you want to stay and help us do that
[52:22] for the meetings, we we sure. So, but
[52:24] we'll just have one service and then
[52:26] we'll do that. We tried last year to
[52:28] have a second service and then clean and
[52:30] it was it was tiresome, I know, to many
[52:32] of you. So, we'll try to do that
[52:34] differently this year. So, one service
[52:35] Sunday and then bring your old clothes
[52:37] so you can clean in those if you can do
[52:40] that. Faith is the foundation of
[52:42] everything. How many believe that
[52:43] tonight? Everything rests on faith. The
[52:46] Bible tells us that without faith it is
[52:49] impossible. Someone say that with me
[52:51] tonight. Impossible to please God. And
[52:54] so faith is given by God. It is the
[52:58] foundation of everything. Romans 12:3
[53:00] says, "For I say through the grace given
[53:02] unto me to every man that is among you,
[53:04] not to think of himself more highly than
[53:07] he ought to think, but to think soberly
[53:10] according has as God hath dealt to every
[53:12] man a measure of faith." So, we are
[53:15] given a deposit or a measure of faith by
[53:18] grace or we couldn't even be saved. We
[53:20] had to have that. That's the operation
[53:22] of God. Colossians 2:12 says, "We are
[53:25] buried with him in baptism, wherein also
[53:28] you are risen with him through the faith
[53:30] of the operation of God who hath raised
[53:33] him from the dead." That worth word
[53:35] operation is the energy of God, the uh
[53:38] the action of God. So the faith is
[53:41] actually God's act in us that causes us
[53:45] to be saved. It's not our act, but it's
[53:48] God's act. You say, "I believe." And it
[53:51] was actually God that believed through
[53:53] you to cause you to come to him. And
[53:56] brother Brandon puts it this way. He
[53:58] said, "Now," he said, "the predestinated
[54:00] plan is in plain view." He said, "Just
[54:03] as other seed, the word of God is a seed
[54:06] and must have the ground prepared
[54:08] beforehand." He said, "If you swed seed,
[54:11] just throw it out there on the ground,
[54:12] it would do no good. The birds would
[54:14] pick it up. You throw it among thistles
[54:16] and thorns, it'll choke it out pretty
[54:18] soon." He said, "So the ground has to be
[54:20] made ready first." So God in sovereign
[54:22] grace. Aren't you glad for grace tonight
[54:25] prepares the heart first. He prepared
[54:27] you before the foundation of the world
[54:29] to receive him in this age. He forneew
[54:32] you by his fornowledge. We talked about
[54:34] that on Sunday. Ordained you to eternal
[54:37] life. He knew you. Therefore, he
[54:39] prepared you. He said that's the reason
[54:42] you staggered out of these things and
[54:44] staggered into what you have now. It was
[54:47] God leading you to the place where he
[54:49] had ordained for you to be.
[54:52] And so it seemed to you like you
[54:54] staggered out of one thing, staggered
[54:56] into another thing, happened out of one
[54:58] thing, happened into another thing, but
[55:00] it was actually God preparing the
[55:02] ground, preparing you for a time you
[55:04] could receive and have faith to believe.
[55:06] We see ordained you to eternal life. He
[55:08] said if this ground isn't prepared
[55:10] beforehand, it can't grow. He said
[55:13] that's the reason the seed of faith when
[55:15] you're preaching faith see the
[55:17] discernments of the Lord and see what
[55:18] takes place and he said all the gifts of
[55:21] the Bible working. So we see that
[55:23] happen. He said people work themselves
[55:25] up. Oh hallelujah. I believe it and come
[55:28] up and find themselves disappointed.
[55:30] He said see the ground has to be for
[55:33] ordained.
[55:34] Oh my. You realize what a blessing it is
[55:36] to be able to receive from God, to have
[55:39] the faith to reach out and grab a hold
[55:41] of salvation, grab a hold of healing or
[55:43] whatever it is that you have. What is
[55:45] that? That faith is given to you. It's a
[55:47] gift of God. He has pre-ordained you to
[55:50] be able to do that. Listen, he said many
[55:53] of them will come and they get worked
[55:54] up, but they don't have faith. And he
[55:56] said, see, the ground has to be for
[55:57] ordained. He said, you know, when it
[56:00] strikes it. So, we know that the word
[56:02] preach doesn't give everyone real faith,
[56:07] right? It it the word preach,
[56:10] we know causes you to have faith because
[56:12] that's what Paul says. He said, "Faith
[56:14] comes by hearing and hearing by the word
[56:17] of God." So, faith comes by hearing to
[56:20] those who are pre-ordained to faith
[56:22] because he said, "Have they not all
[56:24] heard?" Right? Many heard and were not
[56:26] pre-ordained to faith. So the word
[56:28] preached doesn't give everyone real
[56:30] faith. In other uh if it if that was the
[56:33] case, then we could go just preach out
[56:35] on the streets and whoever heard it
[56:37] would have faith and be a Christian. But
[56:40] they are not Christians. Why? Not
[56:42] because they don't hear, but because
[56:44] they don't. Brother Random called it
[56:46] understand. He said they don't
[56:47] understand. But an eagle understands.
[56:49] There's something about them, something
[56:51] God put in you to understand the word
[56:53] and have faith to believe it. So in
[56:56] Hebrews chapter 4 and:e 2 it says unto
[56:58] us was the gospel preached that dwells
[57:00] unto them but the word preached did not
[57:02] profit them not being mixed with faith
[57:06] and them that heard it. So it wasn't
[57:07] just that the the word brought faith but
[57:10] they had to have faith in order to
[57:12] receive it. Now and now are you
[57:15] following me so far?
[57:16] So brother Brandham said he's talking
[57:18] about people that would come up in the
[57:20] prayer line and and I want you to think
[57:23] about something for a little while. Why
[57:25] did brother Brandham uh do the gifts
[57:28] that he the gifts that he had? Why did
[57:29] he perform that in front of people? We
[57:32] know the third poll was to be done right
[57:35] away from people uh quietly without any
[57:38] public show, but the first two were to
[57:41] be done on the platform. Why did brother
[57:43] Brandham perform those things on the
[57:45] platform? There's a reason. We'll get to
[57:48] it in just a moment. Now, so brother
[57:50] Brandon talks about how that he said
[57:52] people coming up to the platform or
[57:54] people sitting in the audience. He said,
[57:56] "What's the difference of you standing
[57:58] here or sitting where you're at?" He
[58:00] said, "But it's going to take some faith
[58:02] to do that." He said, "So, if you're
[58:04] going to receive it where you're
[58:05] sitting, it's going to take some faith
[58:08] to do that. It's going to take your
[58:09] faith plus my faith with God's faith.
[58:14] Mix it together and my faith and your
[58:17] faith will fade out and God's faith will
[58:20] become predominant and the works will be
[58:23] done. That's what I want. That's what I
[58:24] want in these meetings. That's what I
[58:26] want in all of our services that we
[58:28] could bring our faith, my faith, the
[58:30] preacher's faith, your faith, but also
[58:32] God's faith could be anointed and it
[58:34] would actually our faith would fade out
[58:37] and his faith would predominate. So our
[58:39] faith is not evil. In fact, it's
[58:42] necessary. But we need his faith to do
[58:45] the work. Now, brother Ram said, "I
[58:48] can't make you believe. Neither can you
[58:50] make yourself believe.
[58:53] God has got to give it to you." It's,
[58:56] you know, have you ever thought about
[58:58] that? Why do you believe, not because
[59:00] you made yourself believe,
[59:02] but because God gave you a gift of faith
[59:05] to believe?
[59:07] So, he said, "God has to give it to you.
[59:08] It's a gift of God to believe. Not your
[59:11] faith, God's faith. He said, "Your
[59:13] intellectual faith might believe it,
[59:15] fine. But unless the faith of God is
[59:17] down in your heart," he said, "See, your
[59:19] intellectual faith can accept it, do
[59:22] that and just keep believing it with all
[59:26] your heart until God does reveal it to
[59:28] you." He said, "Just keep believing it
[59:31] until God does reveal So, there's a
[59:33] level of faith that you can have in your
[59:35] intellect, but there's another level
[59:36] that you can have that's a revelation
[59:38] from God that says, "I know I've got it.
[59:41] I know I'm healed. I know I' I've
[59:43] received." But he said, "It's not wrong
[59:44] to have intellectual faith." In fact,
[59:46] it's not wrong for people to have their
[59:48] faith stirred.
[59:50] Can I go a little bit further? It's not
[59:51] even wrong for people to be worked up.
[59:54] Right? But but there's nothing there.
[59:56] Work up by itself won't do it.
[59:58] Right?
[59:58] Right. There's nothing wrong with having
[1:00:00] people's faith stirred. Brother Brandham
[1:00:02] did that all the time, but it's it's
[1:00:04] when it's got to go deeper than that for
[1:00:06] it to last.
[1:00:07] Right? So, and now Jesus is not saying
[1:00:10] now when when we read those two
[1:00:12] scriptures, the one Paul says that faith
[1:00:15] comes by hearing the word and then in
[1:00:16] the next one he said they said increase
[1:00:18] our faith and and and Jesus said, "Well,
[1:00:21] if you had faith as the grain of a
[1:00:23] mustard seed, you would say to this
[1:00:25] cycamine tree, be removed and it would
[1:00:27] be removed." them and he's but he's not
[1:00:30] saying faith cannot be increased. He's
[1:00:32] saying they had the wrong they had the
[1:00:34] wrong kind of faith.
[1:00:35] They had faith themselves but they
[1:00:38] didn't have pure mustard seed faith
[1:00:40] which can't be mixed.
[1:00:42] You see they they didn't have the right
[1:00:44] kind of faith because he said if you had
[1:00:45] even a little bit of the right of God's
[1:00:48] faith of the right kind of faith you
[1:00:50] could speak and it would happen. But
[1:00:52] they had intellectual human faith. But
[1:00:54] the Brandon said he spoke one time of
[1:00:56] the seed of a mustard. Faith is a grain
[1:00:58] of a mustard seed. The smallest mustard
[1:01:00] seed among the smallest seeds that there
[1:01:01] is in the earth today. But what is it?
[1:01:03] It won't mix with nothing.
[1:01:06] Right?
[1:01:06] Listen to this. But when a man takes a
[1:01:08] word of God, no matter how little that
[1:01:10] faith is, but it won't mix with any
[1:01:12] unbelief, it'll bring him out to the
[1:01:15] light.
[1:01:16] Some of us, he says, has great faith
[1:01:18] that'll just perform miracles.
[1:01:21] Some of us has some has faith just to
[1:01:23] hold on till it happens. I think that's
[1:01:26] probably most of us.
[1:01:28] But if it's genuine faith once a hold of
[1:01:31] it, there's nothing going to shake you
[1:01:33] from.
[1:01:34] So it's not so much that you maybe would
[1:01:36] have your faith would be large enough
[1:01:38] that you could just grab a hold of it
[1:01:40] right now. But your faith is to hold on.
[1:01:43] Right.
[1:01:43] Right. So you can see you maybe your
[1:01:45] healing's not here yet. Your the
[1:01:47] salvation of your children and your
[1:01:49] faith is not so great. Maybe that you
[1:01:51] could just see a miracle, but you say,
[1:01:53] "Lord, I'm not giving up on my faith.
[1:01:55] I'm believing that they're coming. I'm
[1:01:57] believing you're going to work it out.
[1:01:58] I'm believing things." How many have
[1:02:00] have held on to things like that for
[1:02:01] years? What makes you hold on to that?
[1:02:04] Is that pure faith that comes from God?
[1:02:06] Something inside of you that won't let
[1:02:08] you let go, that won't let you go out
[1:02:11] and and forget it all and just say, "I'm
[1:02:13] done with it." But it's something inside
[1:02:15] of you that holds you with the word.
[1:02:18] Now listen. So he said some has faith
[1:02:21] just to hold on till it happens. But if
[1:02:23] it's genuine faith wants a hold of it
[1:02:26] there's nothing going to shake you from
[1:02:28] it. It ain't going to mix. Then that
[1:02:30] person is persistent. He has
[1:02:33] perseverance.
[1:02:34] He said no matter how many people says
[1:02:36] the days of miracles has passed, he
[1:02:38] doesn't believe it. He holds on because
[1:02:40] he's met the conditions and sunk that
[1:02:43] word into a heart of faith that believes
[1:02:45] it.
[1:02:46] Right? He planted the seed and he put up
[1:02:48] the sign. we talked about Sunday that
[1:02:50] said, "This is what I planted on this
[1:02:52] day and I'm not giving in. I'm not
[1:02:55] giving up. I'm going to receive a crop
[1:02:57] of what I planted."
[1:02:58] Right? Amen.
[1:02:59] So now saying that, so we need the right
[1:03:03] kind of faith. We need God's faith,
[1:03:05] right?
[1:03:06] And and saying that though, you say,
[1:03:08] "Well, brother Ben, I guess I just, you
[1:03:10] know, I just have a little bit of
[1:03:11] faith." But our faith can be increased,
[1:03:14] right?
[1:03:15] Right. It can be increased. The Bible
[1:03:18] says that 2 Corinthians 10:15, not
[1:03:20] boasting of things without our measure.
[1:03:22] He said that is of other men's labors,
[1:03:24] but having a hope when your faith is
[1:03:27] increased. So Paul says right now, he
[1:03:30] said, "We're we're having to deal with
[1:03:32] you." He's talking to the Corinthian
[1:03:34] church. He said, "I'm having to treat
[1:03:35] you like babies." Right? That's what he
[1:03:37] told him. He said, "You're like a bunch
[1:03:38] of babies." He said, "But there's coming
[1:03:41] a day by," he said, "I hope there is
[1:03:44] that I have hope that when your faith is
[1:03:46] increased, or I expect that when your
[1:03:49] faith is increased, we shall be enlarged
[1:03:50] by you according to our rule abundantly
[1:03:52] to preach the gospel in the regions
[1:03:54] beyond you, not to boast in another
[1:03:55] man's line of things made ready to our
[1:03:57] hands." In other words, he said, "I
[1:03:59] believe that we're going to work with
[1:04:00] you until your faith is increased to the
[1:04:02] point that you can be a help to somebody
[1:04:04] else." Don't you want your faith
[1:04:06] increased like that? until you're not
[1:04:08] just a receiver, but you're actually a
[1:04:10] giver, you're not just a taker, but
[1:04:12] you're actually helping somebody else.
[1:04:16] So faith is increased by the word.
[1:04:20] Right? Now, faith cometh by hearing.
[1:04:23] That's true. It's increased by the word,
[1:04:26] but it's not just the letter of the
[1:04:28] word, but it's increased by the word
[1:04:31] made manifest. Look, brother said,
[1:04:33] "Faith only grows in one vitamin. It
[1:04:36] only has one vitamin. Don't have to have
[1:04:38] any mixture at all. Faith grows in one
[1:04:39] vitamin. That's the word. He said that's
[1:04:41] the only thing faith can grow in is the
[1:04:43] word. And the only way it can grow is
[1:04:45] because it believes the word. And it has
[1:04:47] to take all the word and believe it's
[1:04:48] true. Brother Ram said that was vitamin
[1:04:50] L. Vitamin L for life. That's what faith
[1:04:55] grew by. So faith grows by the life of
[1:04:59] the word. Now, Brother Brandham notices
[1:05:02] a a move among the Pentecostals in 1961.
[1:05:05] You find him addressing this in 1961 and
[1:05:08] not at any other time that I could find
[1:05:10] in his ministry. He just addressed it
[1:05:12] that one year. He addressed something
[1:05:13] called super duper faith.
[1:05:16] Have you ever heard that term?
[1:05:18] He said some of these guys come along,
[1:05:20] they think they have super duper faith.
[1:05:22] He said, and and they come along and
[1:05:24] they they they say, "Well, here's the
[1:05:26] man of the hour, the miracle worker,
[1:05:28] right? and he's going to heal everybody.
[1:05:30] He's going to empty the hospitals and
[1:05:32] change everything. And we know that
[1:05:34] that's not how faith works.
[1:05:36] Right? Brother Brandham always told him,
[1:05:37] "I can't heal anybody,
[1:05:39] right? You've already been healed. I
[1:05:41] come to increase your faith in one who
[1:05:43] can do it."
[1:05:44] But now he talks about these Pentecostes
[1:05:47] having super duper faith. And he saw
[1:05:49] faith, but no repentance,
[1:05:51] miracles, but they didn't last.
[1:05:53] Yeah. And he said I different with some
[1:05:55] of our brothers just laying hands on
[1:05:56] this that and the other like that and
[1:05:58] saying some kind of a super duper faith
[1:06:00] will do it. He said that's not it. You
[1:06:02] got to have genuine solid I have a Holy
[1:06:05] Ghost faith. See it don't it will not
[1:06:08] last. It's not lasting. Now, it wasn't
[1:06:10] wrong for them to lay hands on someone,
[1:06:12] but they were laying hands on people and
[1:06:14] pronouncing them healed,
[1:06:16] right? And saying that they were healed
[1:06:17] when they when they were not or they
[1:06:18] were temporarily healed and then it
[1:06:21] didn't last because there was no
[1:06:22] repentance that went along with it.
[1:06:24] Again, he said, "It isn't some preacher
[1:06:26] with some high super duper faith." He
[1:06:27] said, "I don't believe in those things.
[1:06:29] I believe that faith comes by hearing
[1:06:31] the word of God, and the individual
[1:06:33] ought to straighten his life up and get
[1:06:35] right with God if he expects to get
[1:06:37] healed." So when we have a prayer line,
[1:06:40] when we as we're thinking about these
[1:06:41] things, we're going to Lord willing have
[1:06:43] a prayer line during the meeting. When
[1:06:44] we have a prayer line, we're not looking
[1:06:46] for super duper faith for some man to
[1:06:48] just touch somebody and the people to be
[1:06:50] healed. What we're looking for is to
[1:06:52] fulfill the word of God, to manifest the
[1:06:54] word of God, and then if there's
[1:06:55] something we need to repent of, let's
[1:06:57] repent of it. Let's get it out of the
[1:06:58] way. Let's take care of that first so
[1:07:00] our healing will last.
[1:07:02] Amen, sir.
[1:07:03] Right. So there will be so there'll be a
[1:07:04] lasting effect of it and it won't be
[1:07:06] just a momentary excitement and then
[1:07:08] we're done. But it'll be something that
[1:07:10] we can take home with us and years later
[1:07:12] we'll look back and say that's when
[1:07:14] something real happened in my life.
[1:07:17] That's what we want.
[1:07:19] So super duper faith and you can read he
[1:07:22] says many other things about it mostly
[1:07:24] in just that year 1961.
[1:07:26] But it's faith based on the man or the
[1:07:28] emotion instead of the word. He said
[1:07:31] they get them in a prayer line and shake
[1:07:32] them until something happens. He said
[1:07:34] make them repeat words till they speak
[1:07:35] in tongues. He said that may work
[1:07:38] temporarily, but it isn't based on the
[1:07:40] faith of God.
[1:07:41] And and and yet we could take that far
[1:07:44] so far that some people would say, well,
[1:07:46] if we have faith by the word, faith
[1:07:49] cometh by hearing, why don't we just
[1:07:51] listen to preaching? Why do we need
[1:07:53] prayer lines?
[1:07:54] Why do we need special meetings? Why do
[1:07:56] we need a move of the spirit?
[1:07:59] I think we still need those things.
[1:08:02] Because it's those things when they're
[1:08:04] right.
[1:08:05] Yeah.
[1:08:05] That manifests the word to us.
[1:08:08] Yes.
[1:08:09] Because there are signs of his presence.
[1:08:12] See, when God is there, he does
[1:08:15] something. Just like if someone was in
[1:08:17] your house and you come home, there's
[1:08:20] signs of their presence.
[1:08:22] Right.
[1:08:22] Right. If I come home and and the the
[1:08:26] air conditioning is turned up and there
[1:08:28] and the lights are all off and the dog
[1:08:31] is still in his cage, I know my wife is
[1:08:33] not there,
[1:08:35] right? Cuz there's certain things that
[1:08:37] when my wife comes home, she's going to
[1:08:39] do.
[1:08:41] She's going to let the dog out first,
[1:08:44] make sure it has food and water, and
[1:08:46] then I get food and water after the dog,
[1:08:48] you know.
[1:08:52] But she going to make sure she takes
[1:08:53] care of the dog and she's going to make
[1:08:55] sure she takes care of certain things in
[1:08:56] the house. So when I walk in, I don't,
[1:09:00] you know, I don't have to see her, but I
[1:09:02] see signs of her presence.
[1:09:04] Oh, church. You realize when God is in
[1:09:07] the sanctuary.
[1:09:08] Come on.
[1:09:09] There are signs of his presence. The
[1:09:11] signs aren't him, but it just tells us
[1:09:14] he's there.
[1:09:16] Oh my. So, we believe the word and then
[1:09:19] we look for signs of his presence
[1:09:22] because if the word is true, it works.
[1:09:25] Right. It works. It does something. It
[1:09:27] don't just sit there as a dead letter.
[1:09:29] It don't just create a intellectual
[1:09:32] revival, but it creates a real revival.
[1:09:35] So, something you can feel, something
[1:09:37] you can know, something that you can
[1:09:39] touch and and know that it's there. Even
[1:09:41] we don't go by those things, but yet
[1:09:43] those things are signs that he is around
[1:09:46] us. Are you with me now?
[1:09:48] We go by the word. Whether we feel it,
[1:09:49] whether we touch it, whe whether the
[1:09:51] five senses declare it, we go by the
[1:09:53] word. But when he is here,
[1:09:55] come on.
[1:09:56] There are signs of his presence.
[1:09:58] Right.
[1:10:01] I always know when the church is in
[1:10:04] revival and when we begin to get we
[1:10:05] begin to pull back a little bit, there's
[1:10:06] signs.
[1:10:07] Yeah. Come on.
[1:10:08] Right.
[1:10:10] Frowns turn into smiles.
[1:10:13] People
[1:10:15] who are hard get soft.
[1:10:18] There's less bickering and less fighting
[1:10:20] and less criticizing.
[1:10:22] When we're in his presence,
[1:10:25] right?
[1:10:26] There's less wondering about what's
[1:10:28] going on in your life and saying, "Woe
[1:10:30] is me and and why did I why do I have to
[1:10:32] deal with this?" There's less questions
[1:10:34] when you're in his presence.
[1:10:36] Yeah.
[1:10:37] But when you're just when you're you're
[1:10:39] just going by the word, and that's a
[1:10:40] good thing. We want to go by the word.
[1:10:42] We always go by the word. And yet
[1:10:44] there's times he's good to us because
[1:10:47] we're human beings
[1:10:48] and he shows us that he's alive.
[1:10:51] He shows us that he's still here. Aren't
[1:10:53] you glad he still does that?
[1:10:55] Cuz we're not a bunch of robots.
[1:10:58] We still need to feel the presence of
[1:10:59] the Lord. We still need to have joy in
[1:11:02] his presence. We still need to feel that
[1:11:04] peace among us. We still need to know
[1:11:06] that he's with us, that he cares about
[1:11:08] us. We're not a bunch of robots. God
[1:11:10] didn't call robots to lead the church.
[1:11:11] He didn't make mechanical devices to
[1:11:13] preach the gospel. He called flesh and
[1:11:15] blood men.
[1:11:17] Men that felt pain that knew those
[1:11:19] things. Why? Because they could
[1:11:21] empathize with his people.
[1:11:22] Yes.
[1:11:24] Who went through those same things.
[1:11:28] Oh, God.
[1:11:29] And we preach the word, but we don't
[1:11:31] preach it in a clinical way or a
[1:11:33] textbook way, but we preach it with
[1:11:35] passion. And we preach it uh through a
[1:11:37] life that's lived out as we are being
[1:11:39] corrected by the word. We correct by the
[1:11:42] word.
[1:11:43] Are you with me now? As we are being
[1:11:44] changed, we preach a changing word. As
[1:11:47] we are being filled, we preach a filling
[1:11:49] word.
[1:11:52] Listen what Paul says. He says, "For our
[1:11:55] gospel came not of you in word only, but
[1:11:58] also in power and in the Holy Ghost, in
[1:12:01] much assurance as you knew what manner
[1:12:04] of men we were among you for your sake."
[1:12:06] So, in other words, you watched our
[1:12:07] lives. You had much you were you were
[1:12:09] confident we were men of God and you saw
[1:12:12] the works of the Holy Spirit in our
[1:12:14] lives. And my speech and my preaching
[1:12:17] was not with enticing words of man's
[1:12:21] wisdom but in demonstration of the
[1:12:23] spirit and of power
[1:12:26] that your faith should not stand in the
[1:12:28] wisdom of men
[1:12:31] but in the power of God.
[1:12:33] Yes.
[1:12:34] So brother Brandon puts that this way.
[1:12:36] He said the gospel came to us not in
[1:12:37] word only through gasoline only but
[1:12:41] through spark also
[1:12:43] to make it move the mechanics and the
[1:12:46] dynamics. Mark 16:18 says they that's
[1:12:49] the believers shall take up serpents and
[1:12:51] if they drink any deadly thing it shall
[1:12:53] not hurt them. They shall lay hands on
[1:12:56] the sick and they shall recover. See, we
[1:13:00] can talk about the word. We can know the
[1:13:03] word. But when we see the word
[1:13:05] manifested, it increases our faith.
[1:13:09] And we need our faith to be increased.
[1:13:13] Listen, I'm not judging you, church. I'm
[1:13:15] not looking down on you. I need my faith
[1:13:17] to be increased. I need more faith to
[1:13:19] believe God's going to take care of
[1:13:20] things. I need more faith to believe I
[1:13:22] don't have to worry about it. I need
[1:13:24] more faith to believe things are going
[1:13:25] to be okay.
[1:13:26] Yes, sir. Right. In this dark world that
[1:13:29] we're living in, only faith can produce
[1:13:31] an atmosphere that'll bring those seeds
[1:13:33] out of the ground that we've seen
[1:13:35] planted. Only faith can make the word
[1:13:37] work.
[1:13:38] So, we must see our faith increase. How
[1:13:41] are we going to That's why we have
[1:13:42] meetings. That's why we bring people
[1:13:44] together. That's why we try to bring an
[1:13:46] atmosphere in the services. Why? That
[1:13:48] our faith might be increased.
[1:13:51] Hallelujah.
[1:13:53] That's why when we all gathered together
[1:13:56] and brother Brandham and I this was
[1:13:58] prompted brother Joel read that quote
[1:14:00] and it's always been a dear quote to me
[1:14:02] but I saw it maybe in a different way
[1:14:04] than I had before as brother Brandon
[1:14:06] talks about that atmosphere of faith
[1:14:07] that was created in a church and he
[1:14:09] makes that profound statement that where
[1:14:12] the where faith is preached from the
[1:14:13] word the children live
[1:14:16] we want live children
[1:14:19] not dead children
[1:14:21] so faith is preached from the word and
[1:14:22] let the children live. And I've pondered
[1:14:24] on that and thought about it. Brother
[1:14:26] Brand talked about how a person would
[1:14:28] get healed and then they would wait a
[1:14:31] stranger would come in. He said they
[1:14:32] would
[1:14:34] they would come in and he said they
[1:14:36] would come to say come to our house and
[1:14:38] let us tell you what God has done. Let
[1:14:41] us tell you about the miracles that God
[1:14:42] has done. Let us tell how we got healed,
[1:14:44] how we were raised from the dead, all of
[1:14:46] these things. said, "I got thinking
[1:14:47] about that." And so many times what
[1:14:49] happens if a church gets cold on God,
[1:14:51] you begin to backslide a little bit.
[1:14:53] Then what happens? A stranger will come
[1:14:55] in and the first thing they hear is
[1:14:56] gossip and dissension and and this one
[1:14:59] against that one and what preacher is
[1:15:00] right and and what person in the church
[1:15:02] has the right idea. And they begin to
[1:15:04] hear all about our differences and
[1:15:05] things and oh to God that we could have
[1:15:08] faith to the point where if a stranger
[1:15:10] come in, they'd hear about what God was
[1:15:12] doing among us.
[1:15:14] Right.
[1:15:16] Very good.
[1:15:17] So when we all gather together,
[1:15:20] there's more of those stories.
[1:15:24] Right.
[1:15:25] And we look at some people. If you work
[1:15:27] with people as long as I've worked with
[1:15:28] people in this area, I've been coming in
[1:15:30] this area and preaching for 25 years, I
[1:15:32] guess. And if you work with people that
[1:15:34] long, eventually you you you know those
[1:15:38] stories.
[1:15:39] You know that God delivered.
[1:15:41] Yeah.
[1:15:41] God saved. But I couldn't recite many of
[1:15:43] them to you. But when I see somebody I
[1:15:45] know, there's a person who was in
[1:15:46] brother Randler's meetings. There's a
[1:15:48] person a little bit younger that
[1:15:49] preached a sermon. I remember they got
[1:15:52] gloriously delivered and come out of
[1:15:54] drugs and alcohol and here they are
[1:15:56] still serving the Lord.
[1:15:57] I remember I was in that service. Some
[1:16:00] of y'all I can remember when you got
[1:16:02] saved.
[1:16:03] You see, I remember that. Brother
[1:16:04] Herald, you've been around long enough.
[1:16:06] You remember a lot of those stories and
[1:16:07] those things you can know. I remember
[1:16:09] when this one got saved. They're a
[1:16:10] deacon now, but I remember when they
[1:16:12] first come come to the Lord. They were a
[1:16:14] a trustee or they're a a song leader or
[1:16:16] a preacher, but I remember what they
[1:16:18] were like before. And we shouldn't look
[1:16:19] at that and say, "Well, I remember what
[1:16:21] they were. It makes me look down on
[1:16:22] them." It ought to be something that we
[1:16:23] can say, "Lord, what a marvelous God you
[1:16:26] are. I remember what they were, but I
[1:16:28] remember what I saw what you did in
[1:16:30] their life.
[1:16:32] How you changed them." All right.
[1:16:34] But see, when we gather together,
[1:16:35] there's more of those stories and you
[1:16:38] begin to realize that
[1:16:40] God is working.
[1:16:41] Yes.
[1:16:43] Yes.
[1:16:44] And it helps us and it helps the people
[1:16:46] that visit.
[1:16:47] Yeah.
[1:16:47] Right.
[1:16:48] Right. It helps those who come around.
[1:16:50] Cuz sometimes on our Wednesdays,
[1:16:53] there's good crowd here tonight for a
[1:16:55] Wednesday night. And but sometimes it
[1:16:57] gets scarce on Wednesdays and even the
[1:16:59] pastor can get discouraged. You know,
[1:17:00] you get to the place where you feel
[1:17:01] like, well, you know what? what what are
[1:17:03] we doing? And God's doesn't seem like
[1:17:05] much is happening. There's miracles
[1:17:07] happening we don't even know about right
[1:17:08] now.
[1:17:11] And when we gather together, it's why
[1:17:13] I've never tried to hold it back or say,
[1:17:14] "Well, so many can come and we'll just
[1:17:16] stop." No, I I want as many to come as
[1:17:18] will come because I feel like there's
[1:17:20] more of those stories and
[1:17:22] more of those people and
[1:17:24] that that that that know God is real
[1:17:27] that can believe for me and for my
[1:17:28] children, for your children, right?
[1:17:30] I want that. So we we come together and
[1:17:33] our faith has increased. That's why you
[1:17:35] know when you watch the videos of
[1:17:37] brother Brandham and I I encourage you
[1:17:39] to do that. We played one here on a
[1:17:40] Wednesday night here in the church and
[1:17:42] faith just dropped into the building and
[1:17:44] and you could see it on people's faces
[1:17:46] and and some of our kids maybe haven't
[1:17:48] seen that and be good for them to see
[1:17:50] it. Be good for us to watch it again
[1:17:52] because we're seeing what God did in our
[1:17:54] day and it builds our faith. It
[1:17:56] increases our faith. Listening to tapes
[1:17:58] increases our faith because we hear
[1:18:01] we're not just reading it but we're
[1:18:02] hearing what God actually did.
[1:18:04] Yes.
[1:18:05] Amen.
[1:18:07] And so it increases our faith. And
[1:18:09] that's what gifts are for. Brother
[1:18:10] Brandon said a minister could preach the
[1:18:12] word. He said I'm not a preacher. I beg
[1:18:14] to differ with him on that. I don't
[1:18:16] differ with brother Brandon about much
[1:18:18] but he said I'm not a preacher. He said
[1:18:20] the minister could preach the word. He
[1:18:21] could make it so plain to you that you'd
[1:18:23] accept it like that. He said then God's
[1:18:25] good. He said, "If you couldn't take my
[1:18:27] word for it, that would be enough. But
[1:18:29] not God." No. He moves every stone. I
[1:18:33] love this.
[1:18:34] That can be moved to see if he can get
[1:18:37] you to believe.
[1:18:39] See, God's not like somebody, well, if
[1:18:41] they can't accept the word, we'll just
[1:18:42] cut them out of our fellowship.
[1:18:44] That's not what God does.
[1:18:46] God said, "I'm going to move every stone
[1:18:50] and to get you to believe." Brother
[1:18:52] Brandham says that many times. In fact,
[1:18:53] he says that in deep calls to the deep.
[1:18:55] If you've listened to it, you know he he
[1:18:57] he stands there and he says, "If I was
[1:18:58] God," he said, "I would send my word and
[1:19:00] that'd be enough." He said, "But he
[1:19:02] sends gifts and ministers and different
[1:19:04] things all down through history to show
[1:19:06] us that he is real to declare himself to
[1:19:09] us."
[1:19:10] Oh, I'm so glad that he does.
[1:19:13] He moves every stone that can be moved
[1:19:15] to see if he can get you to believe.
[1:19:16] Then he sends his spirit into us.
[1:19:18] Sometimes it works in different ways. He
[1:19:20] sends it into us to reveal himself and
[1:19:24] it's never through the history through
[1:19:26] the ages look back through anywhere
[1:19:27] hasn't been revealed. He said in this
[1:19:29] manner until today church we our faith
[1:19:32] ought to be increased by seeing what God
[1:19:34] did in our day and what he's doing right
[1:19:36] now.
[1:19:38] Yes,
[1:19:40] Abraham had faith.
[1:19:43] Sure he did. He held on for 24 years.
[1:19:45] And that last year was going to be
[1:19:47] tough, but he had held on and all of a
[1:19:51] sudden
[1:19:52] he had to have an increase of faith to
[1:19:54] receive the promise.
[1:19:56] Yeah.
[1:19:56] God knew that.
[1:19:57] He didn't just tell Abraham, "Well, I
[1:19:59] said it. You're just going to have to
[1:20:00] believe it."
[1:20:01] But what did God do?
[1:20:03] God came down.
[1:20:06] Took some dust together, created a body,
[1:20:09] come down to talk to Abraham in the heat
[1:20:11] of the day by in the plane of memory.
[1:20:14] Why did he do that? He didn't have to do
[1:20:15] that. He'd already told Abram what would
[1:20:17] happen. But he did it because to
[1:20:19] increase Abraham's faith to grow that
[1:20:22] faith to the promise of the hour. And
[1:20:25] God come down in our day and showed us
[1:20:27] the sign of the son of man to increase
[1:20:29] our faith.
[1:20:33] Look, when the secret of his heart was
[1:20:35] revealed, Abraham's faith grew.
[1:20:38] He said, "Where's your wife Sarah?"
[1:20:42] Right? And said, "She's in the tent
[1:20:44] behind you."
[1:20:45] He said, "At this the time appointed,
[1:20:46] Sarah shall have a son." And Sarah said,
[1:20:48] "Not me."
[1:20:52] And she said it in her heart.
[1:20:56] And the angel said, "Why did Sarah
[1:20:58] laugh?
[1:20:59] God knows your heart."
[1:21:01] You can imagine Abraham's faith. Maybe
[1:21:03] he was getting pretty pretty down. These
[1:21:05] were men like you,
[1:21:07] people like us. Sarah had gotten so down
[1:21:11] where she couldn't even believe it when
[1:21:12] the angel said it. But Abraham, there
[1:21:13] was something about him. He recognized
[1:21:15] this was a different kind of guy than
[1:21:17] just another normal guy. He looked past
[1:21:20] the dust and saw a deity. And so he was
[1:21:24] when he said that something in his fa
[1:21:25] his heart quickened. He said, "He didn't
[1:21:27] know her. He didn't know." And she even
[1:21:30] said, "I didn't laugh." He said, "Oh,
[1:21:32] but you did."
[1:21:35] What was it that knew her heart?
[1:21:37] It was Jehovah God. And it gave Abraham
[1:21:40] faith to believe that he could he could
[1:21:42] have a body change. Oh, I believe that
[1:21:44] same things happened in our day.
[1:21:46] Elijah had faith. We know he had faith.
[1:21:49] In fact, he had so much faith that he
[1:21:50] called for a showdown,
[1:21:52] right? And and there was a there was a a
[1:21:55] fire come down on the altar. I've always
[1:21:57] loved that God didn't even leave dust on
[1:21:59] the altar.
[1:22:01] The fire consumed the water and the
[1:22:03] dust. And Abraham believed God so much
[1:22:05] or or Elijah rather believed God so much
[1:22:07] that he had him pour water all over the
[1:22:09] f the sacrifice
[1:22:11] because he knew how hot the fire of God
[1:22:13] was.
[1:22:15] Right? And so he he was okay with doing
[1:22:17] that. And so he he had faith.
[1:22:20] But he ran from a woman a few days
[1:22:22] later.
[1:22:23] And the same man that had faith needed
[1:22:25] an angel with soft hands
[1:22:28] wipe his brow. Come on, preach.
[1:22:31] The same people who believe the word, I
[1:22:33] I know that you believe the word. I know
[1:22:35] you go by the word. You don't go by
[1:22:37] feelings and emotion, but that same
[1:22:39] people are human beings that need the
[1:22:40] angel of the Lord to come by sometimes
[1:22:43] and give us just let us feel his
[1:22:45] presence.
[1:22:48] Elijah had faith, but when he saw a
[1:22:50] cloud, see, what was it? A sign that God
[1:22:53] was fulfilling his word. He saw a cloud
[1:22:55] the size of a man's hand, but it was
[1:22:58] enough.
[1:22:59] Oh, we're looking for great big things,
[1:23:01] but many times God, the signs of his
[1:23:03] presence are little things, and they
[1:23:05] increase our faith.
[1:23:07] He saw a cloud the size of a man's hand.
[1:23:09] He ran faster than a Ahab's chariot and
[1:23:11] said, "I hear the sound of abundance of
[1:23:13] rain."
[1:23:15] Hallelujah. It'll take an old man like
[1:23:17] that, make him run faster than a a
[1:23:19] chariot, a team of horses. What was it
[1:23:21] that did that? It was faith increased in
[1:23:24] his heart.
[1:23:26] We see God fulfilling his word. Our
[1:23:27] faith has increased. I think back, you
[1:23:30] know, it's only been what has it been a
[1:23:32] couple months that we had an American
[1:23:34] pope was elected.
[1:23:36] And I was getting phone calls and people
[1:23:38] saying, "Boy, the bride's going to come
[1:23:40] together and everything."
[1:23:43] And we kind of forgot.
[1:23:45] But why did that do that? I think God
[1:23:47] allowed that to happen to increase our
[1:23:48] faith.
[1:23:49] Yeah.
[1:23:50] Right. He He's still there.
[1:23:53] We're farther down the road than we
[1:23:54] were. I'll tell you that.
[1:23:56] I don't know what it all means, but I
[1:23:58] know we're much farther down the road
[1:24:00] than what we were.
[1:24:02] That hasn't changed, but we get so busy
[1:24:04] with life. But what was that for? I
[1:24:06] believe God allows these things to
[1:24:07] happen. Let's see it. Many things happen
[1:24:09] behind the scenes,
[1:24:11] but these things that we can see happen
[1:24:13] to increase our faith.
[1:24:15] And you look at Moses. Moses had faith.
[1:24:19] And yet, he didn't have enough faith.
[1:24:21] Come on.
[1:24:22] To go up and take a a superpower and
[1:24:25] take them on,
[1:24:27] right? He needed a special kind of
[1:24:29] faith, increased faith to go down to
[1:24:32] Egypt and take over. So, what does he
[1:24:34] do? God says, "I'm going to give you two
[1:24:36] signs."
[1:24:37] All right?
[1:24:38] I'm going give you a sign in the hand,
[1:24:40] and I'm going to give you uh the second
[1:24:42] sign. And brother Brandham had two signs
[1:24:43] as well. And with those two signs, his
[1:24:46] faith was increased. Why? Why do people
[1:24:48] act like they don't need an increase of
[1:24:50] faith? I don't need meetings. I don't
[1:24:52] need church services. I don't need
[1:24:54] preachers. I don't need hands laid on
[1:24:56] me. I don't need prayer lines. Have you
[1:24:59] become immortal and suddenly you you
[1:25:02] turned into an angel? I believe we still
[1:25:04] need an increase of faith because we're
[1:25:06] human beings
[1:25:08] for our bodies, for our spirits, to get
[1:25:10] us in a place where our souls, a faith
[1:25:12] of our soul can increase and the faith
[1:25:14] of God can predominate in our lives.
[1:25:16] Very
[1:25:18] good.
[1:25:18] See, a lot of people today, you just
[1:25:21] hang with me for a minute. I I really
[1:25:22] believe that a lot of people today, if
[1:25:24] someone come along, now we know it
[1:25:25] wasn't it's not for anybody else. It was
[1:25:27] just for brother Brandham, right? But if
[1:25:29] someone come along with a sign in the
[1:25:30] hand like brother Brandham had, a lot of
[1:25:33] us would look at that and say,
[1:25:36] why?
[1:25:38] What's the purpose?
[1:25:40] Why would God do that? It's kind it's
[1:25:41] almost silly. A sign in the hand. Do you
[1:25:45] do you remember what that was? The first
[1:25:46] poll, brother Brandon would take someone
[1:25:48] by the hand and know what was wrong with
[1:25:50] them
[1:25:53] because the veins would come up on his
[1:25:56] hand and the germs would give a certain
[1:25:58] pattern on his hand. He would know what
[1:25:59] was wrong with him by the sign of the
[1:26:01] hand. That's interesting, isn't it?
[1:26:04] And a lot of us today would look at that
[1:26:05] and say, "Well, don't want nothing to do
[1:26:06] with that.
[1:26:08] Bunch of Pentecostals,
[1:26:11] believe something like that."
[1:26:14] But God was doing it. Yeah.
[1:26:16] People weren't ready to believe in the
[1:26:19] second poll yet.
[1:26:21] Yeah.
[1:26:21] So, they had to have the first poll.
[1:26:24] Very good.
[1:26:24] Right.
[1:26:26] And then it led to the second poll. And
[1:26:28] then those who believed in the first
[1:26:30] sign,
[1:26:32] they saw the second sign and he knew the
[1:26:35] secrets of the heart. So, it's a much
[1:26:36] greater thing.
[1:26:37] Yeah.
[1:26:38] But we shouldn't discount what God was
[1:26:40] doing. We shouldn't discount what God
[1:26:41] was doing in the first poll
[1:26:43] because God was doing something that
[1:26:45] hadn't been done before just to show
[1:26:48] that he was still God and to increase
[1:26:50] their faith. Look, brother Brandham had
[1:26:52] that sign all the way through his
[1:26:53] ministry.
[1:26:54] It didn't leave him,
[1:26:55] but he just moved on to the second pole,
[1:26:58] but that first poll kept operating. He
[1:26:59] he could do it uh anytime that he uh uh
[1:27:02] that he chose to. Now, if you look uh in
[1:27:05] 1950, he says this. He said, "Now," he
[1:27:08] said, "I want you you to see something
[1:27:09] here, young man, to increase your
[1:27:11] faith." Now, at this time, Brother
[1:27:12] Brandham had already moved on to the
[1:27:14] second pole. But he said, "Now watch."
[1:27:16] He said, "I want you to take your hand
[1:27:18] off of mine. I want you to look here at
[1:27:20] my hand. My arm just look like yours or
[1:27:21] any other man's, doesn't it?" He said,
[1:27:23] "Let's have your hand over here just a
[1:27:24] moment. See how it doesn't have any
[1:27:26] effect at all on my hand there, does
[1:27:27] it?" He said, "Now take your other hand,
[1:27:29] lay it on there. Now, watch what happens
[1:27:31] now. Start swelling." But what did he
[1:27:33] tell him? He said, "Young man, I want
[1:27:35] you to see something. going to increase
[1:27:36] your faith, right?
[1:27:38] So, why did he have to see that? Because
[1:27:40] he's human,
[1:27:42] right? And we need to see signs of his
[1:27:45] presence.
[1:27:47] Again, he said, "That's why I'm here
[1:27:48] tonight is because I believe that if God
[1:27:51] can do something through me
[1:27:53] to increase your faith to accept the son
[1:27:56] of God as your healer, then you'll get
[1:27:58] healed."
[1:28:00] Amen. Again, he said in 1954, "I stand
[1:28:03] as a servant to represent him to you in
[1:28:06] a way of increasing your faith for your
[1:28:09] healing."
[1:28:10] Oh, don't we want our faith to be
[1:28:11] increased tonight? He said, "That's what
[1:28:13] that was for, to increase our faith in
[1:28:15] in healing." He said in his presence, he
[1:28:18] said, "I trust that God will do
[1:28:19] something to increase your faith that
[1:28:21] you'll get healed and be made well."
[1:28:23] Again, in 1964, he said, "Always
[1:28:25] remember what we're here for is to try
[1:28:29] to increase your faith." You say, "Well,
[1:28:30] it can't be increased." Absolutely, it
[1:28:32] can.
[1:28:34] Increase your faith in his presence that
[1:28:36] you might receive that which you ask
[1:28:38] for. Then by faith you believe.
[1:28:41] Again, in 1965, he said, "It's my
[1:28:43] purpose here now to try to get every
[1:28:45] man, not to change your theologies or
[1:28:48] nothing, but to increase your faith in
[1:28:50] God's promise of this day." Why did God
[1:28:53] show signs of his presence? Because he
[1:28:55] wanted us to know he was here. He wanted
[1:28:57] us to receive the word when it come. We
[1:28:59] needed the first pull to receive the
[1:29:00] second pull. We needed the second pull
[1:29:02] to receive the third pull which was the
[1:29:04] opening of the word.
[1:29:06] Yes,
[1:29:07] we still need signs of his presence to
[1:29:10] increase our faith. Now those particular
[1:29:12] signs were for one ministry, one to an
[1:29:14] age.
[1:29:16] But when we see the word for us
[1:29:18] vindicated in our own lives, it
[1:29:21] increases our faith. I think this will
[1:29:22] help you young people. I hope it will.
[1:29:24] It's helped me over the years.
[1:29:28] It's when you see yourself acting like a
[1:29:31] Christian, that's when you begin to
[1:29:33] believe you're a Christian. That's
[1:29:35] right.
[1:29:36] Many times the devil will fight you.
[1:29:37] You'll have an experience. You'll go to
[1:29:38] camp. You'll be here at the altar and
[1:29:40] the devil will fight you on that.
[1:29:42] He'll just he'll just tear you up on
[1:29:44] that cuz he'll say, "It wasn't real."
[1:29:47] People will even disappoint you and
[1:29:48] discourage you on that. Say it wasn't
[1:29:50] real. It wasn't nothing. Oh, I've seen
[1:29:52] them come up 50 times before. Aren't you
[1:29:55] glad if they didn't get it 49 times that
[1:29:57] they were willing to come up a 50th
[1:29:59] time?
[1:30:01] Amen.
[1:30:02] I don't want to discourage our children
[1:30:04] from seeking the Lord.
[1:30:08] We still need those signs of his
[1:30:10] presence. But you young people, you
[1:30:11] know, you you you'll see that and but
[1:30:13] watch for those areas of your life.
[1:30:15] Suddenly you begin to serve the Lord and
[1:30:18] and and maybe you made some mistakes but
[1:30:20] you the desire for that went away and
[1:30:23] you realize I just don't want to do that
[1:30:25] no more. I want to be in church. I want
[1:30:28] to serve the Lord. I want to be a a good
[1:30:31] Christian. And when you realize that
[1:30:32] about yourself, you didn't do that for
[1:30:35] yourself. Something did that.
[1:30:37] What is that? It's it's a sign of his
[1:30:39] presence. Amen.
[1:30:40] Then you ought to uh you ought to grab a
[1:30:42] hold of that and say, "Lord, I believe
[1:30:44] you saved me. I believe you filled me
[1:30:46] with the Holy Ghost.
[1:30:48] I believe you've changed my life.
[1:30:50] I'm different." Brother Brandham told
[1:30:51] that man and was wondering if he had had
[1:30:53] anything. He said he went from the
[1:30:54] Methodist to the Baptist to the
[1:30:56] Methodist to the Pentecostal. Finally
[1:30:58] come to Brother Brandham and said, "Show
[1:30:59] me what I've done, why I can't be
[1:31:01] saved." Brother Brandham said, "You've
[1:31:02] had it all along."
[1:31:03] Yeah.
[1:31:04] He said, "But what was it?" He said,
[1:31:05] "That day you were at the Cardinal and
[1:31:07] you read a little piece of paper and
[1:31:09] said, "Where will you spend eternity?"
[1:31:10] He said, "You were headed one direction
[1:31:12] and you turned around and went another
[1:31:14] direction."
[1:31:15] And he didn't realize it, but what was
[1:31:17] it? Signs. If he had watched for those
[1:31:19] signs, you're different than what you
[1:31:21] was. Your desire is different than what
[1:31:23] it was. And if it's not, you still need
[1:31:25] him.
[1:31:26] Are you with me now?
[1:31:28] You still need to meet him. But if
[1:31:29] you've never met him, you'll never be
[1:31:31] the same.
[1:31:32] Come on.
[1:31:33] Hallelujah.
[1:31:35] Look for those signs.
[1:31:37] Those particular signs were not for us.
[1:31:39] But we do have there are signs of
[1:31:41] whatever we're supposed to be. When we
[1:31:43] see that us our lives growing into that,
[1:31:45] it gives us confidence with God.
[1:31:48] I I'm not a prophet. I don't know the
[1:31:50] secrets of the hearts. But I can lay
[1:31:52] hands on the sick.
[1:31:54] And the Bible says they shall recover.
[1:31:57] You go a step further. You can lay hands
[1:32:00] on the sick,
[1:32:01] right?
[1:32:02] Because the Bible says they shall
[1:32:03] recover.
[1:32:04] Amen.
[1:32:05] Believers can lay hands on the sick. You
[1:32:06] can lay hands on your own children. Lay
[1:32:08] hands on one another. Now, why do we
[1:32:10] have a prayer line? Have preachers lay
[1:32:12] hands. I know people sit back and say,
[1:32:13] "Well, it's just a bunch of preachers
[1:32:14] wanting to look like something." I
[1:32:16] That's never occurred to me while I was
[1:32:18] in a prayer line. I've always thought it
[1:32:19] looked kind of dumb, to be honest with
[1:32:20] you.
[1:32:23] bunch of people sweating and snotting
[1:32:25] and
[1:32:26] screaming and hollering and or whatever
[1:32:29] happens, right? I it just kind of you're
[1:32:32] not going to get much traction out of
[1:32:34] that. And every time we have one, we get
[1:32:36] criticized by somebody thinking we're
[1:32:38] Pentecostal. You know,
[1:32:41] I beg to differ.
[1:32:45] I'm a believer of this message.
[1:32:48] A prophet who had prayer lines produced
[1:32:49] people who believed in them.
[1:32:51] Come on. That's right.
[1:32:52] Right. But but but you know the the
[1:32:55] prayer line will come along and and I
[1:32:57] don't think it has to make just
[1:32:57] preachers. Well, why do we do that?
[1:32:59] Because people have confidence in the
[1:33:01] lives of those men. That's why it's
[1:33:02] important that the preachers hold
[1:33:03] themselves right,
[1:33:05] do the right thing because then you have
[1:33:06] confidence in those men. That's a man of
[1:33:08] God. I know he spent his time praying.
[1:33:10] Brother Daryl Ward's going to be here.
[1:33:12] And I'll say this because brother Daryl
[1:33:13] probably won't hear it, but brother
[1:33:14] Daryl's one of the finest men you'll
[1:33:17] ever meet in your life. and I I've known
[1:33:18] him. And when I was 17 year old years
[1:33:20] years old, I start say year old. Brother
[1:33:22] Daryl actually took me in under his wing
[1:33:25] and and made me feel like I was just
[1:33:26] just like him. He was a worldwide
[1:33:28] evangelist and I was nothing. But he
[1:33:30] took me in and talked to me and and and
[1:33:32] and mentored me during that young age
[1:33:34] and some and I I remember that and I
[1:33:37] remember how he made how it made me feel
[1:33:39] and and and things like that. And that's
[1:33:40] meant the world to me. I got confidence
[1:33:42] in his prayers.
[1:33:44] I got confidence in his prayers. and
[1:33:46] we're going to he's going to pray for
[1:33:47] us. The other brothers that are here,
[1:33:48] men that every one of them, I got
[1:33:50] confidence in their prayers, we ought to
[1:33:52] look at that say, "What an opportunity.
[1:33:54] If I got a need in my body, if I got a
[1:33:55] need in my spirit, what an opportunity
[1:33:57] to go and and have hands laid on me by
[1:34:00] somebody who who really serves God and
[1:34:02] loves God." That's the way I look at it.
[1:34:05] And and so it's not that that person has
[1:34:07] any special thing, but we have got
[1:34:08] confidence that if they ask us, the
[1:34:10] Bible said, "The effective fervent
[1:34:12] prayer of a righteous man avaleth much."
[1:34:15] I want them to pray fervently over me. I
[1:34:17] want them to I I I want them to not give
[1:34:19] in and just just say, "Well, just rush
[1:34:21] them through." No, I I want something to
[1:34:23] take place
[1:34:25] because I believe it's important.
[1:34:27] Could you receive it just sitting in the
[1:34:28] service? Absolutely. I have many times.
[1:34:31] Many people have you can tonight. Just
[1:34:33] sitting under the word, you can receive
[1:34:35] your healing. Do you believe that,
[1:34:36] church?
[1:34:37] But many times what we see up here
[1:34:39] increases the faith of the audience.
[1:34:42] Listen to the tapes, brother. Many times
[1:34:44] he'll discern a few and then he'll have
[1:34:46] them all lay hands on one another and
[1:34:49] then they're everyone healed. What
[1:34:50] happens is that their faith was
[1:34:52] increased by what was going on at the
[1:34:53] platform.
[1:34:55] God help us to have that kind of an
[1:34:56] atmosphere. It would not decrease the
[1:34:58] people's faith but it would increase the
[1:35:00] people's faith.
[1:35:04] When when you see yourself being a
[1:35:06] Christian, it increases your faith to
[1:35:08] believe, hey, maybe I am a Christian.
[1:35:11] And so the Bible says even so faith if
[1:35:13] it has not works is dead being alone.
[1:35:16] Faith doesn't work alone. It has to have
[1:35:19] works that go with it. If faith doesn't
[1:35:21] do anything, it isn't the faith of God.
[1:35:24] Right? It's just maybe intellectual
[1:35:25] faith, but it's not the faith of God.
[1:35:28] So we know that the feeling can Can I
[1:35:30] have a few more minutes tonight? I I
[1:35:32] just got a few more minutes. We'll
[1:35:33] close. The feeling is not him, but it's
[1:35:37] a sign of his presence.
[1:35:39] Right? So when you say I feel him, the
[1:35:42] feeling itself is not him, but it's a
[1:35:45] sign that he's there. Listen,
[1:35:48] brother Brandon said, "How do you do,
[1:35:49] sister? Do you believe with all your
[1:35:52] heart? You're very conscious of
[1:35:54] something going on." Right? So this lady
[1:35:57] was conscious. Now, if a person walked
[1:35:59] into that presence and didn't feel
[1:36:01] anything, it just there was unbelief in
[1:36:03] their hearts.
[1:36:05] Right? But it but every person feels
[1:36:07] differently. Some people may cry. Some
[1:36:09] people may just be aware of it. Some
[1:36:11] people may shout,
[1:36:13] right? But that's in his presence. You
[1:36:15] may react differently, but there you got
[1:36:17] to feel something.
[1:36:18] You're a human being. If you just walk
[1:36:20] through chewing gum and just go on like
[1:36:22] you were, you probably you're probably
[1:36:25] nothing there to be uh to be quickened,
[1:36:28] right? But and that's we're not going by
[1:36:30] feelings, but again, it's signs of life,
[1:36:33] signs of his presence. soul, you're
[1:36:36] going you feel something quicken in your
[1:36:37] heart. Even if it's just a warm feeling
[1:36:39] in your heart, you feel that. And so he
[1:36:41] said, you're very conscious of that,
[1:36:42] that believing that there's something
[1:36:43] supernatural. He said, now that isn't
[1:36:45] going to hurt you. That's to bless you.
[1:36:48] You've never felt just that way before
[1:36:50] in your life like that. Isn't that
[1:36:52] right? He said, if it is, raise your
[1:36:53] hand so the people can catch it. That's
[1:36:55] the angel of the Lord. So the people
[1:36:58] couldn't see them standing there. Very
[1:37:00] rarely did people see the angel. In
[1:37:02] fact, I think it was just Brother Billy
[1:37:04] Paul and then uh I I don't even believe
[1:37:06] his his brother, brother Brandham's
[1:37:08] brother saw the angel. I think it was
[1:37:09] just Billy Paul that saw the actually
[1:37:11] saw the angel
[1:37:13] and brother Brandham that saw the angel.
[1:37:15] Most people couldn't see it, but they
[1:37:16] could feel it.
[1:37:17] Yeah.
[1:37:18] Almost everybody come in the prayer
[1:37:19] line. Brother Brandon said, "Do you feel
[1:37:20] that? That's him."
[1:37:22] Yeah.
[1:37:23] Right. Oh my. I believe we can still
[1:37:26] feel him today.
[1:37:29] So he said, "You've never felt that
[1:37:31] way." just before in your life. That's
[1:37:32] the image of the Lord. Your faith is
[1:37:34] moving in now. And since you've come
[1:37:36] right here, your faith is increased
[1:37:39] tremendously.
[1:37:43] I've seen that happen where the angel of
[1:37:45] the Lord would be, you feel the presence
[1:37:48] of the Lord and we'd be praying for
[1:37:50] people and when people come to the
[1:37:52] front, there's nothing special about the
[1:37:53] front. He could be right there with you.
[1:37:56] But many times that's where people are
[1:37:58] being prayed for and and there's there's
[1:38:00] a presence there. And I've watched
[1:38:02] people come to that not even be prayed
[1:38:03] for and come when they come through that
[1:38:05] presence they get healed.
[1:38:07] Yeah.
[1:38:08] When they come up, I've watched it
[1:38:09] happen many times. Church, we need to
[1:38:11] stir our faith up a little bit. We can
[1:38:13] believe these things.
[1:38:15] He said, "Since you've come right here,
[1:38:17] your faith is increased tremendously."
[1:38:20] That's what I want. I want an increase
[1:38:22] of my faith. Not just a little increase.
[1:38:24] I want my faith increased tremendously
[1:38:26] cuz one of these days I got to leave
[1:38:28] here.
[1:38:33] He said, "Isn't that right? Because
[1:38:35] you're in his presence now. That's
[1:38:36] what's doing it." Again, he said, "Oh,
[1:38:39] the greatest pleasure I know of is to be
[1:38:42] pray until I can realize that I'm in the
[1:38:44] presence of God and recognize it." He
[1:38:48] said, "I think that ought to be the
[1:38:49] thrill of the church
[1:38:50] is the presence of the Holy Spirit."
[1:38:54] Should that still be the thrill of the
[1:38:56] church?
[1:38:57] Not that some man was real eloquent or
[1:38:59] that we got through church in a record
[1:39:01] amount of time or or that we got to eat
[1:39:03] chicken at the right time, but but the
[1:39:05] thrill of the church is the presence of
[1:39:08] the Holy Spirit.
[1:39:09] Seeing the God that made the promise
[1:39:11] standing among us, feel his presence and
[1:39:14] see his word and see it vindicated.
[1:39:17] It ought to give faith to make cripples
[1:39:19] walk, blind see, deaf hear, dumb speak.
[1:39:23] Oh, church, I I need that faith. We all
[1:39:25] need that faith.
[1:39:27] He said, "With this sweetness around
[1:39:29] you."
[1:39:30] Now, look, Brother Brandon would come
[1:39:32] down and I know a lot of times there's
[1:39:34] shouting and things like that. And I
[1:39:35] believe in that. I believe in joy in the
[1:39:36] presence, but I love those times when he
[1:39:38] comes in his sweetness.
[1:39:40] And I feel like that's a lost art
[1:39:42] among people. It just it just feels like
[1:39:44] people just want to rush through and but
[1:39:46] when his presence is here and almost
[1:39:48] every service at the end of the service
[1:39:50] there's an opportunity there and we feel
[1:39:52] that sweet spirit come among us we
[1:39:54] should take advantage of that and I
[1:39:57] don't mean that we have to be here all
[1:39:58] night but brother Brandon said do you
[1:39:59] feel that sweetness around you you
[1:40:01] continue singing he said do you believe
[1:40:03] his presence is with you he said if you
[1:40:05] do raise up your hands and say from this
[1:40:08] night on I pledge myself a new I'm
[1:40:09] accepting my healing I'm accepting my
[1:40:11] plea of salvation inside and out. I
[1:40:14] believe that Christ, the son of God,
[1:40:16] will now take care of all that I have
[1:40:17] need of. He said, "Can you raise your
[1:40:19] hands while we sing quietly again with
[1:40:20] our heads bowed?" Brother Brandham
[1:40:22] sings, "I love him. I love him." He
[1:40:24] said, "Oh, that blessed sweetness."
[1:40:27] I love this.
[1:40:29] He said, "We're coming up near the bush
[1:40:31] now."
[1:40:33] Feel the effects of the fire
[1:40:36] on the bush.
[1:40:40] I just love to be in his presence and
[1:40:43] feel the effects of the fire.
[1:40:46] When I get worried and I get down or I
[1:40:48] get discouraged or I think nobody
[1:40:50] understands, let me be near the bush.
[1:40:53] What's he talking about? The burning
[1:40:54] bush, the pillar of fire. He said, "Let
[1:40:57] me be near the bush. Let let me feel the
[1:40:59] effects of the fire." He said, "We're
[1:41:01] coming up near the bush now. Feel the
[1:41:04] effects of the fire on the bush. the
[1:41:05] Holy Spirit warming our souls to faith.
[1:41:10] Faith can't operate in a in a ice house.
[1:41:15] There has to be a heart that's been
[1:41:16] warmed
[1:41:18] by the presence of God.
[1:41:20] God didn't just go down and pick Moses
[1:41:22] up out of the desert and say, "Moses,
[1:41:24] you're going to go down and deliver
[1:41:25] Israel." What did he do? He gave him a
[1:41:27] burning bush experience.
[1:41:29] Changed his life first and then sent him
[1:41:31] down with the word to declare to the
[1:41:34] people. Listen,
[1:41:37] he said, "How do you do?" He's talking
[1:41:38] to a person in the prayer line again. He
[1:41:39] said, "We're strangers to each other."
[1:41:42] Sister said, "Yes, the Lord Jesus knows
[1:41:43] us both." Now, don't be afraid. See, he
[1:41:47] said, "Just relax. It's his presence.
[1:41:50] That's it. It's his presence." Now, you
[1:41:52] have a real strange feeling, odd kind of
[1:41:55] a sweet, humblelike feeling. He said,
[1:41:57] "Now, standing in the presence of a man
[1:42:00] wouldn't make you feel that way."
[1:42:02] But he said, "How many ever seen that
[1:42:04] light, that pillar of light, fire? It
[1:42:07] was taken right here in Texas. First
[1:42:09] time, the second time it's hanging right
[1:42:11] by the woman, see in this dimension
[1:42:14] now."
[1:42:15] So it was there. She couldn't see it.
[1:42:18] But she felt it.
[1:42:21] See, if our faith is to be increased, we
[1:42:24] need his presence.
[1:42:26] And that feeling that we have, again, we
[1:42:29] don't go by that. That's not how you
[1:42:30] know you're saved because he did that
[1:42:32] for you before you got saved. He let you
[1:42:34] feel his presence.
[1:42:36] And many people are fooled by that
[1:42:37] because they think, "Well, I must be
[1:42:39] right with God." No, he's wooing you
[1:42:41] back to him.
[1:42:42] Just because you feel his presence
[1:42:43] doesn't mean you're a Christian,
[1:42:45] right? You you may not be a Christian
[1:42:47] and feel his presence, but if you'll
[1:42:48] come to it, you'll be a Christian,
[1:42:51] right? And you'll know that by the
[1:42:53] actions of faith in your life. Now look,
[1:42:56] he you say, "Well, I don't really need
[1:43:00] any of that." You see, the feeling that
[1:43:02] we have is assigned to us that he's
[1:43:03] there. But you say, "Well, brother Ben,
[1:43:04] I know he's there. I know he's there cuz
[1:43:06] he said he's there." How many believe
[1:43:08] that?
[1:43:09] He said, "I'll never leave you. I'll
[1:43:10] never forsake you." I I know he's there.
[1:43:13] Right? So, you might even say, "I I I
[1:43:15] don't I don't need that. I don't really
[1:43:17] think I need a meeting. I bless God. I
[1:43:20] think I'll just sit out the prayer line
[1:43:23] and I know so many of us work during the
[1:43:26] meeting that we don't get as much out of
[1:43:28] it, but if we could just take a little
[1:43:29] bit of time,
[1:43:30] come on.
[1:43:32] And come near the burning bush, I
[1:43:33] believe it'd help us.
[1:43:38] Let's come near the burning bush.
[1:43:40] Said, "But brother Ben, I I just don't,
[1:43:41] you know, that's just not something I
[1:43:43] need." I want you to do something right
[1:43:45] now. If you feel that way, pinch
[1:43:46] yourself real hard.
[1:43:50] Do you feel it?
[1:43:53] Nobody pinching themselves. Everybody
[1:43:55] must believe they need the presence of
[1:43:56] the Lord.
[1:44:00] But if you pinch yourself real hard
[1:44:01] right now, you'd feel it.
[1:44:04] Why? Cuz you're flesh.
[1:44:08] Think about this. Jesus was a man. He
[1:44:11] was also God.
[1:44:13] He was God in a man.
[1:44:15] The son, the body was a man.
[1:44:17] The father dwelt in him. Right?
[1:44:20] It was
[1:44:22] after God, you know, the presence of God
[1:44:25] lifted from him in the garden of
[1:44:26] Gethsemane. You remember brother
[1:44:28] Brandham taught us that God, he lifted
[1:44:30] his his presence from him.
[1:44:33] And he went to the cross without that
[1:44:37] feeling.
[1:44:37] Yes, sir.
[1:44:40] But feeling like a sinner.
[1:44:44] So that you would never have to feel
[1:44:46] like a sinner again.
[1:44:51] We have to take advantage of that.
[1:44:53] But did you ever notice in one of the
[1:44:54] gospels and I didn't go back and look it
[1:44:55] up, but did you ever notice this that
[1:44:57] when Jesus was was there, he they were,
[1:45:02] you know, he'd gone through that garden
[1:45:03] of Gethsemane, but he died more of a
[1:45:05] death in Gethsemane than he did on the
[1:45:06] cross. He's gone through all the pain
[1:45:08] and the sorrow. And angels came
[1:45:12] and comforted him.
[1:45:16] They didn't come to comfort God.
[1:45:20] They come to comfort the man.
[1:45:23] He still needed the presence of angels.
[1:45:29] If he needed that,
[1:45:30] being a man was born without sin.
[1:45:33] Come on.
[1:45:34] Not born the way we were born with no
[1:45:37] with no sin. And he still needed the
[1:45:40] presence of angels. I believe we still
[1:45:42] need the presence of angels. Amen.
[1:45:44] We still need the presence of God.
[1:45:48] Job was human. He had faith, but he
[1:45:51] needed to increase his faith. In Job
[1:45:53] 42:5, and I'll close with this. He Job
[1:45:56] said, "I've heard of thee by the hearing
[1:45:58] of the ear."
[1:46:00] Brother Brandon preaches an entire
[1:46:02] sermon on this. I have heard, but now I
[1:46:04] see.
[1:46:06] Right? And and he said, "I've heard of
[1:46:08] thee by the hearing of the ear, but now
[1:46:10] my eye seeth thee."
[1:46:12] What was it? His presence changed
[1:46:14] things.
[1:46:16] Now we wonder, brother said, if we could
[1:46:18] see God, is there a way we could see
[1:46:19] him? He said that was the only way God
[1:46:21] had trying out. He said, "I have heard
[1:46:23] of thee with the hearing of the word of
[1:46:25] the ear, but now I see thee." See, faith
[1:46:28] was was come by the word, by hearing,
[1:46:31] but he still needed to see him.
[1:46:34] Amen. Are you with me now? Yes.
[1:46:37] He said, "I've heard of thee with the
[1:46:38] hearing of the ear, but now I see thee.
[1:46:40] But now I see thee with my eyes. The
[1:46:41] vision of the invisible had been made
[1:46:44] plain." Don't you see what God was doing
[1:46:45] with the message of the hour? We always
[1:46:47] had the Bible, but the Bible had to be
[1:46:49] open to us, made real to us, manifested
[1:46:52] to us. The message made Christ visible
[1:46:54] to us.
[1:46:56] Made the invisible plain.
[1:46:59] Listen, brother Bren said, "The church
[1:47:00] has heard of God. They've read of him
[1:47:02] and what he did and the promises he
[1:47:04] made. But now we see him with our eyes
[1:47:07] just the same as Job did. I've heard of
[1:47:10] thee, but now I see thee. He said, "My,
[1:47:12] what a difference."
[1:47:14] We have heard that these signs follow
[1:47:16] them that believe. We believe that the
[1:47:18] word by faith of God in us. We believe
[1:47:20] that word by the faith of God in us.
[1:47:22] Now, let's let our faith be increased.
[1:47:24] How many can say amen to that tonight?
[1:47:26] Let our faith be increased by the
[1:47:28] feeling of his presence. By testimonies
[1:47:30] of his presence, by seeing the sign of
[1:47:31] the son of man, by hearing, seeing
[1:47:33] there's still other believers that
[1:47:35] believe like we do, that believe in a
[1:47:36] message of the hour that believe God
[1:47:38] sent a prophet that believe the sign of
[1:47:40] the son of man was when we see other
[1:47:41] believers. It strengthens our faith. It
[1:47:43] increases our faith.
[1:47:46] Hallelujah.
[1:47:48] But the B said, "Now you heard it by the
[1:47:49] word,
[1:47:50] by the hearing of the word. Faith cometh
[1:47:52] by hearing. Hearing the word now you see
[1:47:54] and act with your eyes."
[1:47:56] You've heard it by hearing of the word.
[1:47:58] Now you see it. Act with your eyes. Now
[1:47:59] that same God that said that when these
[1:48:01] things must be taking place, that the
[1:48:03] believers on this would lay their hands
[1:48:04] on the sick and they shall recover. Look
[1:48:07] what he said. The same God that said he
[1:48:09] would send Elijah. The same God that
[1:48:11] said that we'd see a cloud in the sky.
[1:48:13] The same God that come in Malachi 4,
[1:48:15] Revelation 10:7, Luke 17:30. That same
[1:48:18] God said that the believers would lay
[1:48:20] their hands on the sick
[1:48:22] and they shall recover. And brother
[1:48:25] Brandham in that sermon I have heard but
[1:48:26] now I see. He said now has it dropped
[1:48:28] into your heart that you're healed.
[1:48:30] Musicians go ahead and come.
[1:48:33] He said raise your hands if it did. He
[1:48:36] said that's real apostolic healing. You
[1:48:38] mean it. You believe it with all your
[1:48:40] heart. He said hallelujah. That's all we
[1:48:43] need.
[1:48:44] Let's stand on our feet and give him
[1:48:45] praise. Then
[1:48:47] I believe we could do that tonight.
[1:48:49] Let's stand and give him praise tonight.
[1:48:51] Have we received our faith by hearing of
[1:48:53] the word? Oh, I believe we've heard the
[1:48:55] word tonight. We've hear the word when
[1:48:57] we come together. Let's Let's praise
[1:48:58] you. That's all right. Let's praise him
[1:48:59] for it. Oh, Lord, you're worthy.
[1:49:02] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. I've heard
[1:49:05] you. I've heard of you by the word, but
[1:49:07] now I've seen you with my eyes. I know
[1:49:09] that you're real.
[1:49:11] Hallelujah. You know what brother
[1:49:13] Brandham did that night? He had them all
[1:49:16] lay hands on one another and stand in
[1:49:17] faith and rejoice. The next night, he
[1:49:19] had another prayer line, an oldfashioned
[1:49:22] prayer line. The next night was, I
[1:49:23] believe, when he preached uh the wings
[1:49:25] of a snow white dove and he had that
[1:49:26] long prayer line where they just laid
[1:49:28] hands on the people. Why? Cuz he knew
[1:49:29] they were still human. They still needed
[1:49:31] that touch. They they still, oh church,
[1:49:33] we still need him tonight. He's still
[1:49:35] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:49:37] Let your faith increase to the point
[1:49:39] where you can believe, I've heard of
[1:49:40] you. But now I've seen you. I know
[1:49:42] you're a healer. I know you're a miracle
[1:49:44] worker. I've heard the testimonies. I
[1:49:46] know what you do. And I believe, Lord,
[1:49:49] help thou my unbelief. Oh, I thank you,
[1:49:52] Lord Jesus. Have you received faith by

[1:50:39] some kind of a gripe or complaint, but
[1:50:42] Lord, may it be a reality in our hearts,
[1:50:44] oh God, that your coming is near. May we

[1:50:59] your presence, for the signs of your
[1:51:01] presence, Lord. Where would we be if we
