[37:29] meet that need tonight and we believe
[37:31] that you will in Jesus name amen
[37:35] amen God bless you this evening turn
[37:38] with me to Galatians chapter 5 and verse
[37:40] 1 Galatians 5 and 1.
[37:46] read down through verse 6.
[37:49] it's good to be in the house of the Lord
[37:51] on a Sunday afternoon
[37:53] I know it's a little bit of a hard time
[37:55] of year with all the sickness and things
[37:57] and then with hunting season
[37:59] going on that's like a national holiday
[38:02] around here so we have to kind of
[38:06] we
[38:07] I think marriages even stop around here
[38:09] for hunting season but not ours we I I
[38:13] just fish so I'm too spiritual to hunt
[38:16] so
[38:17] brother Branham never said to you you
[38:19] know that you time wasn't watered to you
[38:21] when you were hunting he said timeless
[38:25] time was a lot of doing you were fishing
[38:26] so that's my Doctrine I'm gonna stick
[38:29] with it
[38:30] but we're glad to have all the hunters
[38:33] I'll take all the free deer meat that I
[38:35] can get I'll tell you that
[38:37] right now but we're gonna hunt out the
[38:38] word tonight this afternoon and just
[38:41] look into the word a little bit isn't
[38:42] the word always good you know you just
[38:44] open up your Bible and find something
[38:46] that that would be good just anything
[38:48] anywhere you'd read in it but let's read
[38:50] from Galatians chapter five and verse
[38:53] one Stand Fast therefore in the Liberty
[38:55] we're with Christ hath made us free and
[38:58] be not entangled again with the Yoke of
[39:01] bondage so you are free so he said Stand
[39:05] Fast in that freedom yes and make sure
[39:08] you remain free be not entangled again
[39:11] with the Yoke of bondage behold I Paul
[39:13] say unto you that if you be circumcised
[39:15] Christ shall profit you nothing
[39:18] so if after having been free you
[39:20] voluntarily Place yourself back under
[39:22] the law Christ shall profit you nothing
[39:25] for I testify again to every man that is
[39:28] circumcised that he is a debtor to do
[39:30] the whole law
[39:31] Christ has become of no effect unto you
[39:35] whosoever of you are justified by the
[39:38] law you are fallen from Grace
[39:41] for we through the spirit wait for the
[39:43] hope of righteousness by faith
[39:45] for in Jesus Christ neither circumcision
[39:48] availeth anything nor uncircumcision but
[39:52] faith
[39:53] which worketh by love I pray the Lord of
[39:57] that is blessing to the word you may be
[39:58] seated
[40:00] I'm holding this mic to try to get a
[40:01] little bit more volume tonight I don't
[40:03] have much voice but we're going to try
[40:05] to preach anyway and I want to talk to
[40:08] you tonight about choosing Grace yes
[40:10] choosing Grace
[40:12] we know that when we were saved we
[40:14] didn't choose Grace
[40:16] chose us right
[40:19] I wasn't looking for Grace
[40:22] it would be an oxymoron to choose Grace
[40:25] in that sense because Grace is unmerited
[40:29] favor you didn't do nothing for it you
[40:32] couldn't work your way into it you
[40:34] couldn't you couldn't tell yourself
[40:36] about the message of the hour you you
[40:38] couldn't put yourself in your family you
[40:40] couldn't you couldn't uh you couldn't
[40:42] give yourself conviction you couldn't
[40:44] there's nothing you could do to Merit
[40:47] the grace that you've been given he
[40:49] chose you out of a bar room or off of a
[40:52] church pew or off the street how many
[40:54] you say Amen to that this afternoon he
[40:56] chose me it was his unmerited favor just
[40:59] like he did the disciples in John
[41:02] chapter 15 he said you have not chosen
[41:04] me but I have chosen you that's pretty
[41:07] straightforward isn't it he said it
[41:09] ordains you that you should go and bring
[41:11] forth fruit and that your fruit should
[41:14] remain so he said I've chosen you and
[41:16] I've chosen you for the purpose that
[41:18] your fruit was going to remain that
[41:21] whatsoever you shall ask of the father
[41:23] in my name he may give it to you so we
[41:27] find then that the Bible tells us that
[41:30] the children of Israel are God's chosen
[41:32] people if you ever notice it never says
[41:34] that God was there he was their chosen
[41:37] God
[41:38] right they never chose him as their God
[41:40] but he chose them as his people aren't
[41:44] you glad for that the Romans chose gods
[41:47] the Greeks chose Gods the Egyptians
[41:49] chose God yes but he but the Israelites
[41:52] never chose a God right God chose them
[41:55] God come down to Abraham and he said
[41:57] you're mine you belong to me and that's
[41:59] what he wants to do to each and every
[42:01] one of us yes excuse me he wants to come
[42:04] down and say you belong to me and I
[42:06] believe that's what he's done that's how
[42:08] he chose us so he come down and he chose
[42:11] us and so uh we we don't have a god of
[42:14] our choice we don't have a worship of
[42:17] our choice we don't get to choose how we
[42:19] worship her or who we worship but we
[42:22] worship according to the scripture
[42:23] because that's God's word and it's the
[42:26] grace that's revealed to us right and we
[42:28] found the children of Israel were the
[42:30] same way they come out about three
[42:32] months they left Egypt and they come to
[42:34] the Red Sea and the bitter Waters and
[42:37] they finally come down to Sinai Mount
[42:39] Sinai and I want to look at that this
[42:42] afternoon for just a moment in Exodus 19
[42:44] and 1.
[42:47] because many times when you're chosen by
[42:50] God then you have to choose to remain a
[42:54] free people
[42:55] because the opportunity will be there to
[42:58] place yourself under a system of works
[43:01] to try to bring you back into a a
[43:04] religion of your own making and so we we
[43:08] need to be careful that we don't do that
[43:10] in the message of the hour but that we
[43:11] we remain a free people that we don't go
[43:14] back into a religion of works because we
[43:17] were chosen by God and and so after we
[43:21] are chosen by Grace we need to choose
[43:23] Grace we need to continue in Grace so he
[43:26] said don't be uh don't be entrapped
[43:29] again in the Yoke of bondage Exodus
[43:31] chapter 19 and verse 1 it says in the
[43:33] third month when the children of Israel
[43:35] were gone forth out of the land of Egypt
[43:37] the same day they came into the
[43:38] Wilderness of Sinai but they were
[43:41] departed from refuen or come to the
[43:43] desert of Sinai and had pitched in the
[43:44] wilderness and their Israel Camp before
[43:47] the mount and Moses went up unto God and
[43:49] the Lord called into him out of the
[43:50] mountain saying thus shalt thou say to
[43:53] the house of Jacob and tell the children
[43:54] of Israel you've seen what I did unto
[43:57] the Egyptians and how I bear You On
[43:59] Eagle's Wings and brought you to to
[44:02] myself well what a wonderful story of
[44:04] Grace
[44:05] he said now therefore if you will obey
[44:07] my voice indeed and keep my Covenant you
[44:10] shall be a peculiar treasure unto me
[44:12] above all people for all the Earth is
[44:14] mine you shall be unto me a kingdom of
[44:17] priests a holy nation he said these are
[44:19] the words which I shall speak into the
[44:21] children of Israel notice it was all
[44:23] positive if it was all I've chosen you
[44:26] I've brought you out it was all about
[44:27] what he did yeah right but now they're
[44:30] wanting but the herald to turn it around
[44:32] because they they could not they were
[44:35] overwhelmed so much by what he did but
[44:39] they couldn't respond in a way that they
[44:41] wanted to and they actually turned it
[44:44] into a legal thing so it seems like it's
[44:47] a great time when God's telling them
[44:48] look this is what I've done for you but
[44:51] brother Branham tells us that it's in
[44:52] this 19th Chapter of Exodus actually
[44:55] that the Israelites chose law instead of
[44:59] Grace they weren't happy with how
[45:01] they've been let out they weren't happy
[45:03] with the way that he brought them out
[45:05] yes he brought them out on the Eagle's
[45:08] Wings he brought them out without a man
[45:10] had nothing to do with it God did it all
[45:12] by himself right but they said we want
[45:14] something more we want a religion we
[45:16] want something we can something that'll
[45:18] tell us what to do and where to go and
[45:20] and when to have church and all of these
[45:23] other things but God brought them out by
[45:25] grace and he wanted them to stay that
[45:27] way yes right
[45:28] amen that's a great brother said was the
[45:31] greatest mistake that Israel ever made
[45:34] they said to Moses finally in Exodus
[45:36] 2019
[45:38] 20 Exodus chapter 20 verse 19 they said
[45:40] unto Moses speak thou with us and we
[45:42] were here but let not God speak with us
[45:44] lest we die yeah so we want we want to
[45:47] we want you to we we want to hear from
[45:50] you and not from God so they set up an
[45:53] intermediary
[45:54] Branham said that's when they chose law
[45:56] instead of Grace he said the greatest
[45:57] mistake that Israel ever made was it
[45:59] Exodus the 19th Chapter when Grace had
[46:01] already provided a savior it had already
[46:04] provided to deliver it had already
[46:06] provided an atonement to shed blood and
[46:08] Israel said don't let God speak let
[46:10] Moses speak they wanted to law our
[46:12] Commandments or something they could do
[46:14] themselves he said you see the nature of
[46:16] man trying to find something to do
[46:18] himself towards Merit salvation yes
[46:21] again brother Branham tells us that the
[46:23] law was given to Israel because they
[46:25] required it
[46:26] can you imagine that yeah now think
[46:28] about it these people were traitors yeah
[46:31] right they were great trades people they
[46:33] they were people who who uh would uh
[46:37] would make money off just about anything
[46:39] but they made some pretty bad swaps yeah
[46:42] think about it they traded Grace
[46:45] they had free Grace and they traded it
[46:48] for law
[46:49] voluntarily they choose law when they
[46:53] were chosen by grace and so now brother
[46:56] Brandon said Grace had provided the lamb
[46:58] provided a savior and they said give us
[47:01] something to do they required it they
[47:03] actually said we want a system we want
[47:06] some way that we can serve God because
[47:09] they just couldn't see themselves
[47:10] serving him just by grace and I think
[47:13] we've got to be careful with that
[47:15] brother said listen Christians yeah
[47:18] the areas where you'll make your fatal
[47:20] mistake yeah there's where Israel made
[47:22] her fatal mistake when she asked for a
[47:25] law to serve God by they actually chose
[47:28] judgment
[47:29] over Mercy notice what they chose in
[47:32] Exodus 19 16 are you still with me this
[47:34] afternoon I don't want to put you to
[47:36] sleep
[47:38] Exodus I you can tell I'm struggling
[47:40] through this do you just bear with me
[47:42] Exodus 19 16 it came to pass on the
[47:45] third day in the morning that there were
[47:47] Thunders and Lightnings in a thick cloud
[47:48] and the voice of the trumpet exceeding
[47:51] louds all the people that were in the
[47:52] camp trembled brother Brown tells us
[47:55] that was judgment yeah yeah it marched
[47:57] out there and God given them Grace to
[47:59] travel by but they demanded a law
[48:01] now now watch where brother Brandon
[48:03] takes this he said God wanted them to be
[48:04] inner denomination but they wanted to
[48:07] make a denomination out of it
[48:09] got to watch what you asked for right
[48:12] right said something they could argue
[48:14] about instead of just following God and
[48:16] living under his jurisdiction
[48:19] under his power
[48:21] they wanted something to argue about
[48:22] right Grace had provided a prophet can
[48:25] we say Amen to that today yes Grayson
[48:28] provided an atonement of lamb Grace had
[48:31] provided all these things yet they
[48:33] wanted judgment
[48:34] they wanted something they could do yes
[48:37] God said assemble them together I'll let
[48:39] them know what it is I'll show them what
[48:41] it is he said read listen and the voice
[48:43] of the trumpet got louder and louder
[48:45] until it shook the Earth he said you see
[48:47] what judgment is I don't want that how
[48:49] many can say Amen to that tonight I
[48:52] don't want his judgment and that's when
[48:53] they said don't let God speak let Moses
[48:55] speak right they couldn't stand under
[48:57] his judgment because they chose that
[48:59] instead of Grace
[49:02] he said I don't want that give me mercy
[49:04] you've got to come to a time where you
[49:06] choose Grace you choose Grace for
[49:07] yourself and you choose Grace for other
[49:09] people yes you got to come to a time
[49:11] where you get to the point where you
[49:13] just quit criticizing people right I
[49:15] said Lord if you found me you can find
[49:17] them
[49:18] yeah if you was good enough that you
[49:20] found me if Grace could find me Grace
[49:22] can find my children Grace can find
[49:24] other people in the church I don't have
[49:26] to I don't have to live their lives for
[49:28] right I don't have to set up a
[49:29] denomination and sit around and
[49:31] criticize everybody that's not what it's
[49:33] about I want Grace I want to choose
[49:36] Grace
[49:38] amen and Moses in Exodus 19 17 brought
[49:42] forth the people out of the camp to meet
[49:43] with God and they stood at the nether
[49:46] part of the mountain and mount Sinai was
[49:47] all together on a smoke because the Lord
[49:50] descended upon it in Fire and the smoke
[49:52] thereof ascended as the smoke of the
[49:54] furnace and the whole Mount quaked
[49:56] greatly and when the voice of the
[49:58] trumpet sounded long and waxed louder
[49:59] and louder Moses spake and God answered
[50:02] him by voice
[50:03] the Lord came down upon Mount Sinai on
[50:06] the top of the mountain the Lord Called
[50:07] Moses up to the top of the mountain
[50:09] Moses went up and the Lord said unto
[50:11] Moses go down charge the people let's
[50:13] say breakthrough into the Lord to gaze
[50:15] and many of them perish he comes back
[50:17] down with the Ten Commandments
[50:19] we look at that today and that's a
[50:21] wonderful thing yes but it was after it
[50:24] rejected Grace that they got
[50:25] Commandments yes
[50:27] Brandon said was the most fatal mistake
[50:28] that Israel ever made was Exodus 19.
[50:31] the grace had provided them all these
[50:33] things had given the Revival they still
[50:35] required a law right though they could
[50:37] have schools theological trained
[50:39] ministers and be just like the rest of
[50:41] the people he said something they could
[50:43] fuss about something they could separate
[50:45] one another break up a fellowship or
[50:48] Brotherhood yes we believe this and we
[50:50] believe that he said if they just let it
[50:52] go on the way God had it going it would
[50:54] have been all right
[50:55] we could say Amen to that right there
[50:57] yes if we just let this message go on
[51:00] the way God has it going we'd be all
[51:02] right
[51:02] but when we try to put our ideas in yeah
[51:05] yeah he said when we inject our ideas
[51:06] when we inject our theology into God's
[51:09] spirit it takes God's spirit away that's
[51:12] a profound statement right there when we
[51:15] inject our theology into God's spirit it
[51:18] takes God's Spirits away how many times
[51:20] have you have I seen God working
[51:22] something out in someone's life can I
[51:24] just talk to you for a minute I've seen
[51:26] God do that he's working it out for the
[51:28] person and yet they inject their
[51:30] theology or their way of thinking into
[51:33] that Grace yeah yeah and he and the
[51:36] spirit of God's just working it out yeah
[51:38] but they can't accept that because of
[51:40] the way they were raised or or something
[51:42] that's happened in their life and they
[51:44] have a Theology and they've got to make
[51:46] it fit that theology just like God do
[51:48] what he does
[51:49] let him heal you yeah
[51:51] yeah let him save you let him take care
[51:54] of you he wants to do it let me believe
[51:56] that tonight he wants to take care of
[51:59] you he wants to let you live like
[52:00] children before the father he wants to
[52:02] work in your life he wants to move in
[52:04] your life but many times we won't let
[52:06] him because we have a preconceived idea
[52:08] of how we want him to work or if you're
[52:11] going to work you've got to present it
[52:13] this way you've got to come through this
[52:14] preacher it's got to do it this way no
[52:16] just let him work just let him do it
[52:19] yeah don't fuss with him don't inject
[52:21] your own theology into let him heal you
[52:23] yes
[52:25] take over your life
[52:28] when we inject our theology into God's
[52:30] spirit it takes God's spirit away
[52:33] he said that's the way it was in that
[52:34] day they were on the road but they
[52:36] wanted something they could do
[52:37] themselves
[52:39] through their fussing
[52:41] they sort of tell us something yeah
[52:44] through their fussing and through their
[52:46] carrying on they found out then that
[52:49] they drove the spirit of God away from
[52:52] them yes it was a great mistake
[52:57] oh my what happens when we fuss the dove
[52:59] takes its flight right and that's our
[53:02] Mercy
[53:03] we want the mercy of God we have the
[53:06] mechanics we want the Dynamics to come
[53:08] down on that right because if we don't
[53:10] if we only have the mechanics we only
[53:11] have the law the dove takes his fight
[53:14] they wanted to have something they could
[53:15] do themselves some Sabbath days they
[53:17] could keep or some ordinances they could
[53:19] do or something another that was brought
[53:21] into them that they could do themselves
[53:23] he said and if you can't do one thing to
[53:25] save yourself he said then there's not
[53:28] one Speck of it Grace yeah if you can do
[53:31] one thing to save yourself there's not
[53:33] one Speck of it Grace
[53:34] law is what you do in regards to the
[53:37] grace that God has showed you by Saving
[53:39] you as I've often said I don't run
[53:41] around with other women because I'm
[53:43] afraid my wife will divorce me I don't
[53:45] run around with other women because I
[53:46] love my wife
[53:48] that's it I don't believe you should run
[53:49] around he said but the law isn't what
[53:51] keeps it it's like I told the couple
[53:53] yesterday I I told him I said you
[53:55] marriage license isn't going to keep you
[53:57] married
[53:58] that's just a legal document I won't
[54:00] keep you married if it's not built on a
[54:02] foundation of love there's nothing there
[54:04] right there's nothing there to hold you
[54:06] and that's the same way with our
[54:08] Christian walk he said it's the reason I
[54:09] love God he said not because I'm afraid
[54:11] he'd send me to hell I don't believe
[54:13] he'd do that but because I love him so
[54:15] much I don't want to do it yes there's
[54:17] nothing in me to make me do it I love
[54:19] him too much I wouldn't hurt him for
[54:21] nothing right right certainly I love it
[54:23] he said when men and women get to a
[54:25] place well I really ought to stay at
[54:27] home and see this good play tonight but
[54:29] I'll tell you they'll think I'm back
[54:30] said if I don't go on down to church
[54:34] well how many times we've not come to or
[54:36] we've come to church well they'll think
[54:38] I'm back said if I don't go
[54:41] he said you sit there and sleep anyhow
[54:45] you might as well stayed home looked at
[54:46] something you'd enjoy more
[54:50] he said but when your joy becomes the
[54:52] Lord yeah and the Lord is your joy you
[54:54] can't stay away from church then you're
[54:57] getting somewhere
[54:59] yeah brother random always takes it back
[55:01] when he talks about the church choosing
[55:02] law for Grace he said that's what
[55:04] Pentecost did we talked about it this
[55:06] morning how they come up to the
[55:07] borderline then they pulled back and he
[55:10] said Pentecost of 1906 they that
[55:12] Pentecostal Revival they they come up
[55:15] but they wouldn't they wouldn't go all
[55:16] the way they chose law instead of Grace
[55:18] and he said that church was in better
[55:20] shape 40 years ago for the coming of the
[55:22] Lord Jesus and it is tonight now we're
[55:24] not talking about that tonight or today
[55:26] because if we're not in better shape
[55:28] today than we were 40 years ago
[55:30] something's wrong right but we believe
[55:32] we're we believe the message of the hour
[55:33] and we're going up we're not going down
[55:36] but this was the Pentecostal Church
[55:38] he said they were in better shape 40
[55:40] years ago than it is tonight he said
[55:41] they were closer to God they had more
[55:43] God among them and more Spirit among
[55:45] them than they got tonight what did it
[55:47] because he said because we separated
[55:48] ourself
[55:50] each little group to itself going out
[55:52] there and telling the other one well
[55:53] that's all Buzzard Roost over there this
[55:55] is that there they haven't got it we got
[55:57] it
[55:58] I wonder how many times we get the same
[56:00] attitude
[56:02] yeah we got another message around here
[56:05] we can have that attitude about one
[56:06] another
[56:07] you said in your little differences of
[56:09] doctrines and so forth and God wouldn't
[56:11] pay that much attention to it
[56:13] he said if we haven't got love what good
[56:14] does it do anyhow that's right
[56:18] you love the word this afternoon yes he
[56:21] said the church now is like Israel the
[56:22] church is like Israel when you come up
[56:24] out of Egypt Israel was down there in
[56:26] Egypt God by His Marvelous Grace without
[56:28] any organization or anything else he
[56:30] called Israel to his health he called
[56:32] them to their inheritance Grace furnish
[56:35] him a prophet Grace give them a pillar
[56:37] of fire Grace give them a lamb a
[56:39] sacrificial lamb Grace give them power
[56:41] Grace give them Deliverance Grace give
[56:43] them Victory Grace give them all these
[56:45] things and they danced in the spirit and
[56:47] shouted and praised God about it and
[56:49] little did they know when they were
[56:50] dancing on the banks of the Jordan or
[56:52] the Dead Sea that they were 40 years
[56:54] away from the land he said there was
[56:56] only about five days away but they made
[56:58] their rash mistake in Exodus the 19th
[57:00] Chapter when they accepted law instead
[57:02] of Grace where they turned down God's
[57:04] way away for themselves give us
[57:06] something to do he said that's been
[57:08] man's idea all along yes and he said
[57:11] they had Grace they had a prophet they
[57:12] had a sacrificial lamb they had
[57:14] Redemption they had been brought to the
[57:16] Red Sea they had been healed of their
[57:17] diseases and water from a smitten rock
[57:19] that man out of Heaven everything they
[57:22] had need of had been supplied and still
[57:24] they wanted something else
[57:26] he said now that's the perfect type of
[57:28] our Ephesians today exactly he said we
[57:31] come out under Luther we went through
[57:32] sanctification under methodists come
[57:34] into the restoration under Pentecost
[57:36] exactly like it was the Wilderness
[57:38] journey and when God brought us out we
[57:40] did very well but what did we do he said
[57:42] we wanted to be like the rest of them
[57:44] right now we find out that Grace is the
[57:46] only thing that takes us through never
[57:48] long
[57:50] right amen listen Hebrews 12 18 says
[57:52] you're not coming to the mount that
[57:54] might be touched it burned with a fire
[57:55] torn to Blackness and darkness and
[57:57] Tempest and the sound of a trumpet and
[58:00] the voice of Words which voice they
[58:01] heard and treated that the word should
[58:03] not be spoken to them anymore but they
[58:05] could not endure that which was
[58:06] commanded so much as a b
[58:10] to be with us through with the dark they
[58:12] couldn't endure what was commanded and
[58:14] so terrible was the sight that Moses
[58:15] said I exceedingly fear and Quake but
[58:18] you're coming to Mount Zion listen to
[58:20] the different picture that he paints to
[58:22] them he says to the city of the Living
[58:24] God the heavenly Jerusalem aren't you
[58:26] glad you come to a different place this
[58:28] afternoon to an innumerable company of
[58:31] angels well that ought to make a shout
[58:32] this afternoon but the random says you
[58:34] can see past the veil of Flesh you'd see
[58:36] Angels at their position and every pew
[58:39] he said an innumerable company of angels
[58:42] to the general assembly the Church of
[58:44] the firstborn which are written in
[58:45] heaven to God the judge of all to the
[58:47] spirits of just men made perfect to
[58:49] Jesus the mediator of the New Covenant
[58:51] the blood of sprinkling this speaketh
[58:53] better things than that of Abel what is
[58:55] it this is Grace
[58:57] choose Grace
[59:00] don't go back to the Yoke of bondage yes
[59:02] yes don't go back to denominationalism
[59:05] don't go back to trying to make it work
[59:07] yourself right don't go back to saying
[59:09] well if you're not part of our group
[59:10] you're not part of it right you know
[59:12] long in the message don't go back to
[59:14] that yes and I see so much of that today
[59:17] see Hebrews 12 25 said don't refuse him
[59:20] that speaks yeah see that you refuse not
[59:22] him to speak it for if they escape not
[59:24] who refuse him to spake on Earth much
[59:26] more shall not we escape if we turn away
[59:28] from him that speaketh from Heaven whose
[59:30] voice then shook the Earth but now he
[59:32] has promised saying it once more I shake
[59:34] mouth the Earth only but also heaven
[59:37] we've been brought out of Egypt the
[59:39] world given the Holy Ghost placed in the
[59:41] Church of the firstborn seated in
[59:43] Heavenly places in Christ we find
[59:45] ourselves in the land today we've had a
[59:47] prophet we were exactly where where the
[59:50] Israelites where we find ourselves where
[59:51] the Galatians were as well yeah and yet
[59:54] Paul spoke to the Galatians in Galatians
[59:56] 1 6 he said I Marvel that you're so soon
[59:59] removed from him that hath called you
[1:00:00] into the grace of Christ into another
[1:00:02] gospel
[1:00:04] which is not another but there'll be
[1:00:05] some that trouble even would pervert the
[1:00:07] gospel of Christ yeah but we are an
[1:00:10] angel from heaven preach any other
[1:00:11] gospel unto you than that which we have
[1:00:13] preached unto you let him be accursed
[1:00:15] why would we go back under bondage yes
[1:00:18] yes why would we go back under a man's
[1:00:20] leadership when the Holy Ghost let us
[1:00:21] out yes why would we go back under do's
[1:00:25] and don'ts and the laws of legalism when
[1:00:27] when God brought us out into Grace and
[1:00:30] it's Grace that makes us want to live
[1:00:31] for God
[1:00:33] hey man
[1:00:34] why would we go back yes
[1:00:37] Paul goes on to tell his story to the
[1:00:40] Galatians how the church had agreed not
[1:00:41] to add the burdens of the law to Gentile
[1:00:44] believers he goes on to talk about Sarah
[1:00:46] and Hagar he typed Sarah as a free woman
[1:00:49] and Hagar is a Bond woman you said the
[1:00:52] seed can't be air with the shut the seed
[1:00:54] of the free woman on the air with the
[1:00:56] seed of the bondwoman but the Branham
[1:00:58] took that and he preached he said the
[1:00:59] hawk can't fly with the Eagles right he
[1:01:01] said he's just trying to impersonate an
[1:01:03] eagle don't try to go back don't try to
[1:01:05] put law with it just just let God be God
[1:01:09] listen he said it must have been
[1:01:10] difficult for Abraham to let Ishmael go
[1:01:13] but he would have marred Isaac's
[1:01:15] inheritance there's got to be there
[1:01:17] can't be any alliance between the free
[1:01:19] and the bound let them go start their
[1:01:21] clicks and denominations we'll stay with
[1:01:23] the word you say Amen to that tonight
[1:01:26] amen we don't want to add anything to
[1:01:29] Faith yes we've been chosen by Grace
[1:01:32] Let's Stay Free
[1:01:34] let's stay Freedom that's my whole
[1:01:37] thought tonight and I know I'm getting
[1:01:38] it across poorly but let's stay free
[1:01:40] yeah let's not go back into the things
[1:01:42] of the world let's not go back into the
[1:01:44] bondage of denominationalism let's not
[1:01:47] go back into the bondage of a man we've
[1:01:49] had enough of that let's stay free yes
[1:01:52] he said oh foolish Galatians who have to
[1:01:54] be with you that you should not obey the
[1:01:55] truth but for whose eyes Jesus Christ
[1:01:57] has been evidently set forth crucified
[1:02:00] among you that's only what I learned of
[1:02:02] you received you the Spirit by The Works
[1:02:03] of the law or the hearing of Faith he
[1:02:05] said how did you get the Holy Ghost did
[1:02:08] it come by grace
[1:02:09] did it come by faith or did it come by
[1:02:11] works
[1:02:12] he said are you so foolish haven't begun
[1:02:14] in the spirit are you now made perfect
[1:02:16] by the flesh
[1:02:18] you say well you know they were trying
[1:02:20] to tell the Galatians said well if you
[1:02:22] eat meat you'll be lost
[1:02:24] if you aren't circumcised you'll be lost
[1:02:26] he said that's not what saved you that's
[1:02:28] right meat didn't save you circumcision
[1:02:31] didn't save you and said in fact if you
[1:02:33] if you get circumcised now for the
[1:02:36] purpose of Salvation he said you
[1:02:37] actually deny Christ yeah
[1:02:40] now today we hear the same thing if you
[1:02:42] don't go to my church you're lost right
[1:02:45] if you don't believe a certain Doctrine
[1:02:46] you're lost it's nonsense
[1:02:49] if you have a Christmas tree
[1:02:52] you're lost
[1:02:53] if you're seeing a certain type of songs
[1:02:55] in your church you're lost it's nonsense
[1:02:57] yeah
[1:02:58] as I told you last Sunday night you
[1:02:59] don't you can't go from being bride to
[1:03:02] being lost yeah right that's not how
[1:03:04] that works true if you love God you'll
[1:03:07] do the works of God you can't be lost
[1:03:10] but you just follow God you follow the
[1:03:13] word not what some man adds to it we
[1:03:15] don't want to go back under legalism
[1:03:17] Abraham received a seal of circumcision
[1:03:19] as a sign of his faith yeah and today
[1:03:21] when we believe God with all of our
[1:03:23] heart and accept his son the Lord Jesus
[1:03:25] and God recognizes that faith is true in
[1:03:28] him then he sends them back down the
[1:03:30] Holy Spirit of promise and steals us
[1:03:31] until the day of our Redemption brother
[1:03:34] Brandon said my that takes all the scare
[1:03:36] out of it there's no negative thoughts
[1:03:39] yes
[1:03:40] listen to this now unless we close
[1:03:42] there's no negative thoughts at all in
[1:03:46] Christianity
[1:03:48] that's right that's a powerful statement
[1:03:50] right no negative thoughts at all in
[1:03:52] Christianity everything is past tense
[1:03:55] it's already finished
[1:03:58] hey man I wonder if the musicians would
[1:04:00] come tonight we'll sing that it's
[1:04:01] already done it's already finished it's
[1:04:04] taken care of
[1:04:06] all right amen
[1:04:07] I read a story
[1:04:10] about an Indian man that
[1:04:12] he couldn't understand the difference
[1:04:13] between law and Grace and and they were
[1:04:16] kind of fussing about it and had a
[1:04:17] little counsel and but he had been
[1:04:19] brought out to this Council of
[1:04:20] theologians and and on the way there
[1:04:23] they'd written on a train and he said he
[1:04:25] said you know he said I think I can
[1:04:26] explain the difference between law and
[1:04:29] Grace
[1:04:30] they said well what is it he said well
[1:04:32] he said you know
[1:04:34] when I got on the train he said back
[1:04:36] then they had chewing tobacco and they'd
[1:04:37] spin it he said they had a sign up on
[1:04:40] the beautiful train station had a sign
[1:04:42] up and said no spitting
[1:04:45] he said but everywhere I looked around
[1:04:46] that sign people spit around the sign he
[1:04:49] said I didn't understand it why would
[1:04:51] they want to spit at that beautiful
[1:04:52] train station he said but you know what
[1:04:54] I did he said I found myself doing the
[1:04:55] same thing he said that the sign didn't
[1:04:58] stop me
[1:04:59] everybody else was doing that might as
[1:05:01] well do it too he said but I went in a
[1:05:03] really nice home
[1:05:05] he said everything was beautiful and he
[1:05:07] said I've never been in a home like that
[1:05:08] he said they had beautiful Furniture he
[1:05:10] said they didn't have no signs up
[1:05:12] nothing they said don't spit he said but
[1:05:15] I could tell they took care of the home
[1:05:17] they loved the home
[1:05:19] the Indian man sat there and he said you
[1:05:21] know he said it never even occurred to
[1:05:23] me to spit he said because I could tell
[1:05:26] they loved their home
[1:05:27] there was love there they cared about it
[1:05:30] somebody would care about it well that's
[1:05:32] the difference in law and Grace we don't
[1:05:34] have to put up a sign no spitting on the
[1:05:37] floor no we wouldn't do that we don't
[1:05:39] want to do that because we care about
[1:05:40] this home we care about this house that
[1:05:43] we live in we care about this Tabernacle
[1:05:45] because God cares about He Loves Us hey
[1:05:48] man that's the difference in law and
[1:05:49] Grace you put up all the signs you want
[1:05:52] to you'll still you'll still pass it but
[1:05:54] there's no Scare at all in Christianity
