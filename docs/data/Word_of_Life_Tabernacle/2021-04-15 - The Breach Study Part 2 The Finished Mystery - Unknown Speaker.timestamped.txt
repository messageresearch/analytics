[45:51] revelation 10 and 4.
[45:54] i want to deal with the breach again
[45:58] tonight and
[46:04] i just trust it'll be a blessing to you
[46:06] we're going to
[46:07] have a practice for the musicians sunday
[46:10] afternoon
[46:11] after lunch so some of us will be eating
[46:13] at the fellowship hall if anyone else
[46:14] wants to eat there that'd be you'd be
[46:16] welcome to join us
[46:18] i don't want to ever leave that out i
[46:19] know people sometimes want to bring
[46:20] their food and
[46:21] you'd be sure welcome to do that but
[46:23] then we're going to be practicing with
[46:24] the musicians and
[46:26] and singers here getting ready for the
[46:28] meetings coming up third
[46:29] about 30 days from now we'll be having
[46:32] meetings here at the church and
[46:34] so we want to prepare our hearts for
[46:36] that but not only that but every service
[46:38] every service is so important and
[46:40] thank god for the musicians that we have
[46:42] we've been blessed beyond our measure as
[46:44] far as a
[46:46] local church to have on the musicians we
[46:48] do
[46:49] but we want to do the best we can for
[46:51] the lord that's not
[46:52] all of our desire so we'll just kind of
[46:55] have a musician
[46:56] appreciation day next this sunday so
[46:59] and then um brother robert wilson had
[47:02] just got back from africa and messaged
[47:04] me today and the sides that you saw
[47:06] before service if you were here a few
[47:07] minutes early
[47:09] the sides on the back wall were from
[47:10] africa where he just got back from ghana
[47:13] and we helped support sponsor that trip
[47:15] him to be able to go and
[47:17] so i wanted to thank you for that and i
[47:20] was supposed to be on that trip
[47:22] but i felt led to stay here and and
[47:25] i believe it was the right thing to do
[47:26] but my heart is still
[47:29] with him i've only been to africa one
[47:31] time but it's such a part of my life and
[47:34] part of my heart you'd have to see it
[47:36] have to experience that to to know what
[47:37] i'm talking about but it's
[47:39] um i'm always burdened for those people
[47:43] and so it's good to see him be able to
[47:45] go there very few missionaries have been
[47:47] able to go overseas but
[47:48] just now if you're starting to get out
[47:50] so let's be praying for
[47:52] for that that god will be able to move
[47:54] and
[47:55] and many more souls will be won to the
[47:57] kingdom just one would be worth it
[48:00] we talked about sunday that when that
[48:02] last one comes in we get to go home
[48:06] that budget for mercy is is extended to
[48:09] that last one
[48:10] and we get to go home and then it's all
[48:12] over and i'm so grateful
[48:14] so grateful we get to be have a part in
[48:16] that
[48:18] whether it happens here over there or
[48:20] some other church it doesn't matter
[48:21] we're still a part of that being the
[48:24] bride at the end time we're we're the
[48:25] light of the hour
[48:27] god's shining through us and so we thank
[48:30] god for that and so thank you for your
[48:31] faithfulness and giving and praying for
[48:34] those things
[48:35] revelation chapter 10 and verse 4 and
[48:38] when the seven thunders had uttered
[48:39] their voices i was about to write
[48:41] and i heard a voice from heaven saying
[48:43] unto me seal up those things
[48:45] which the seven thunders uttered and
[48:47] write them not
[48:48] and the angel which i saw stand upon the
[48:51] sea and upon the earth lifted up his
[48:52] hand to heaven
[48:54] and swear by him that liveth forever and
[48:56] ever and created heaven and the things
[48:58] that therein are and the earth and the
[49:00] things that there
[49:01] are and the sea and the things which are
[49:03] therein that there should be time no
[49:05] longer
[49:06] verse seven but in the days of the voice
[49:08] of the seventh angel
[49:10] when he shall begin to sound the
[49:13] mystery of god should be finished
[49:17] finished as he hath declared to his
[49:20] servants
[49:21] the prophets i pray the lord would add
[49:23] his blessing to the word you may be
[49:25] seated
[49:29] we'll get right into it tonight and i
[49:31] want to kind of
[49:32] bear down on this a little bit as we're
[49:34] going through it because it's important
[49:36] and so you forgive me if i seem slow or
[49:38] repetitive but i believe it's very
[49:40] important and i know some of us many of
[49:42] us understand this but most of us
[49:44] probably don't understand it like we
[49:46] should
[49:47] and so we need to these are the things
[49:49] that have been given to us in this day
[49:51] this this isn't
[49:52] uh uh skim milk
[49:55] this is meat of the word and so i'm
[49:57] thankful we can eat the meat right
[49:59] amen amen so brother branham tells us he
[50:02] said there's seven seals
[50:03] on the book and these seven seals has
[50:06] the book
[50:07] sealed the book is absolutely
[50:11] sealed he said do you see it he said the
[50:14] book is absolutely a sealed book
[50:16] until the seven seals is broken
[50:20] he said it is sealed up with seven seals
[50:24] and now he makes his statement he said
[50:26] now that's a different
[50:27] from the seven thunders see this is
[50:29] seven seals
[50:30] on the book so how are the seven
[50:34] seals and the seven thunders different i
[50:37] told you i was going to kind of bear
[50:38] down on this because i think it's
[50:39] important
[50:40] that we understand it now there were
[50:42] seven thunders that were
[50:44] that were uttered in revelation 10
[50:47] and he said that's different from the
[50:49] seven seals but we know that brother
[50:50] branham taught us and we went through it
[50:52] last wednesday night
[50:53] that the thunders were those truths
[50:57] revealed in the seals to put it just a
[51:00] little bit differently but that's that's
[51:01] what he was saying now
[51:03] and so we've got to look at that now a
[51:05] thunder in the bible is the voice of god
[51:08] and maybe this will help us understand a
[51:10] little bit better it's a voice of god
[51:11] when god
[51:12] speaks in the old testament and new
[51:14] testament it's a thunder
[51:16] a thunder it's it's
[51:19] as if in the old testament says if god
[51:22] is so great
[51:24] that he can't just speak and
[51:27] and people really understand or
[51:28] comprehend what he said
[51:30] it's a thunder all right it's it's so
[51:33] loud so big so wonderful that it's hard
[51:37] for us to comprehend what it is until
[51:40] it's revealed
[51:42] right so a thunder is an unrevealed
[51:46] truth
[51:47] or we can say it this way an unrevealed
[51:49] voice of god
[51:51] a voice of god existing in its
[51:54] unrevealed form it's a thunder
[51:58] it's noise we could say or it's a
[52:00] mystery
[52:02] right it's a mystery and so
[52:05] job 40 and 9 uh it's this is actually
[52:09] god
[52:09] speaking to job he says has sound arm
[52:12] like god
[52:13] can style thunder with a voice like him
[52:16] no one can
[52:18] it's god's voice a thunder and if you go
[52:22] to psalms 29 and maybe sometime you can
[52:24] read it
[52:25] um and i won't read the whole psalm
[52:27] tonight just one verse but
[52:29] you'll find that the voice of the lord
[52:32] is spoken seven times in psalms 29
[52:36] it says over and over again the voice of
[52:38] the lord the voice of the lord
[52:40] the voice of the lord and it tells us
[52:42] the results of the voice of the lord
[52:44] speaking what it does and i'll say this
[52:47] when the voice of the lord that thunder
[52:49] speaks it means something
[52:53] it's not just a head knowledge somewhere
[52:55] but it's something that will affect the
[52:56] earth
[52:57] it'll affect the bride it'll affect the
[53:00] people and so
[53:01] brother branham even said that it'll be
[53:02] those divinely revealed mystery truths
[53:06] that will literally turn the hearts of
[53:08] the children back to the fathers
[53:10] see what god says means something
[53:15] and so these mysteries are not it's not
[53:17] as if we have a plan of salvation that
[53:19] is separate from
[53:21] the mysteries it is the book of
[53:23] redemption
[53:24] the mystery is not a mystery of another
[53:26] book it's a mystery of this
[53:28] book right it's mysteries hidden in this
[53:31] book and so god
[53:32] spoke but people didn't understand what
[53:34] he said
[53:36] right so god had to sit in a prophet
[53:40] amen but in the days of the voice of the
[53:42] seventh angel
[53:45] you have to forgive me tonight i don't
[53:46] have any notes what you see is what i'm
[53:48] seeing up here
[53:49] but it's but in the days of the voice of
[53:52] the seventh angel
[53:53] and when he shall begin to sound the
[53:55] mystery of god should be finished and
[53:57] that's the age we live in and it's
[54:00] important for us
[54:01] not to just know these things but to
[54:03] recognize that it happened
[54:06] that the book came open because then we
[54:08] know we have access to every part of the
[54:10] book
[54:12] right that thunder that's been revealed
[54:14] that's something that's known and
[54:16] when it's known it's something that can
[54:18] take effect in our lives
[54:21] it means something the god of glory said
[54:24] the voice of the lord is upon the waters
[54:26] the god of glory thundereth the lord is
[54:29] upon many waters
[54:32] so a thunder is the voice of god in in
[54:34] john 12
[54:35] 28 and brother branham deals with this
[54:38] in the first seal
[54:39] but in john 12 28 jesus
[54:42] said father glorify thy name he said
[54:45] then there came
[54:46] then came there a voice from heaven
[54:48] saying i have both glorified it
[54:51] and we'll glorify it again now jesus
[54:53] knew what he was saying
[54:55] right but then the next verse
[54:58] speaks of how the people therefore that
[55:01] stood by and heard it
[55:02] said that it thundered it
[55:06] thundered brother brown said they didn't
[55:08] understand it
[55:10] but he knew what it said right
[55:13] and so and others said an angel spoke to
[55:17] him so this was a thunder
[55:19] in revelation 6 and 1 when the seals
[55:22] began to come open he said i saw when
[55:24] the lamb opened one of the seals
[55:25] i heard it as it were the noise of
[55:27] thunder god said something
[55:29] amen god said something
[55:33] and one of the four be saying come and
[55:36] see and
[55:37] brother branham says then he said when
[55:39] the lamb took the book and broke that
[55:40] first seal
[55:42] he said god spoke from his eternal
[55:44] throne
[55:46] listen god spoke to say what that seal
[55:49] was to be revealed
[55:52] amen that was the thunder what the seal
[55:55] was
[55:56] does that make sense now and i don't
[55:58] want to
[55:59] put too much of my own interpretation
[56:01] here i want to stay right with what a
[56:02] prophet said
[56:04] but i think it ought to be plain to us
[56:05] and i try to be very careful it's one of
[56:07] the reasons i'm not using my own notes
[56:09] here because i'm trying to be very
[56:10] careful
[56:11] in saying what the prophet said but it's
[56:14] got to be a revelation to us is that
[56:15] right
[56:17] he said he said god spoke from his
[56:20] eternal throne to say what the seal was
[56:24] to be revealed but when it was placed
[56:26] before john it was in a symbol
[56:29] he said when the thunder remember a loud
[56:32] clapping noise of a thunder is the voice
[56:34] of god
[56:35] he said that's what the bible says a
[56:37] clap of thunder they thought it was a
[56:39] thunder but it was god
[56:41] he understood it for it was revealed to
[56:43] him
[56:44] amen amen you realize what age we live
[56:47] in
[56:48] we understand what god said
[56:52] people knew god said it they said an
[56:54] angel spoke to him a thunder
[56:57] but jesus understood what he said and
[57:00] we're living in a time when we
[57:01] understand
[57:02] that what these mysteries that have been
[57:04] hidden and down to the ages
[57:06] we understand what god said
[57:10] amen amen you realize that the
[57:13] importance of this message without this
[57:14] message
[57:15] you don't have that right without this
[57:18] message we
[57:19] are still in a denominational age
[57:23] and even if we acknowledge that the
[57:24] messenger came
[57:26] but we don't believe that he did his job
[57:29] and open the seals and as the book is
[57:31] open then we still
[57:32] are in a denominational age
[57:35] we have to be because that's what ends
[57:38] the denominational age
[57:41] amen y'all forgive me i'm running this
[57:45] myself today
[57:50] we're going to go back and start singing
[57:52] again
[57:54] so there has to be a voice from heaven
[57:57] that we can understand aren't you glad
[57:58] we can understand it today
[58:00] aren't you glad you can know it so
[58:05] we find that he says
[58:09] when he he under he understood it let me
[58:11] see if back in the right place they
[58:12] thought it was a thunder but it was god
[58:13] he understood it
[58:15] was revealed to him see he said it was a
[58:17] thunder
[58:19] he said and now now watch what he says
[58:22] in revelation 10 4 he said when the
[58:24] seven thunders had uttered their voices
[58:26] notice their voices they said something
[58:29] god said something
[58:31] but it wasn't understood john understood
[58:34] it because he was going to write it
[58:36] but what did what did he tell him he
[58:38] said i heard a voice from heaven saying
[58:39] unto me
[58:40] seal up those things seal them up
[58:44] seal up the thunder so the seal is the
[58:46] mystery of it
[58:48] it's the mystery the thunder is what god
[58:50] said
[58:52] right and so when the seal is broke you
[58:55] understand what god says
[58:59] amen that ought to be just where we can
[59:02] grab ahold of it tonight
[59:04] seal up those things write them not
[59:07] now brother branham in the unveiling of
[59:10] god and we read
[59:11] the more of this quote last wednesday
[59:13] night but he said it's all revealed in
[59:15] there
[59:16] you'll find out what he was talking
[59:17] about in there but stewart what's the
[59:18] bible
[59:20] it's all revealed in there and the seven
[59:22] seals opened up the revelation of what
[59:25] that
[59:25] was so the seven seals open up the
[59:29] revelation of
[59:30] the scriptures it has to come from the
[59:33] scripture
[59:34] because this is the book of redemption
[59:38] right this is the book of redemption and
[59:41] brother baptism said it was the
[59:42] revelation of that new testament book of
[59:44] redemption there's some things
[59:46] that we don't know there's some things
[59:47] we haven't because it pertains maybe to
[59:49] israel or to some other time
[59:50] but for us we know he calls it the book
[59:53] of
[59:54] the revelation of the new testament
[59:56] right and so
[59:58] but that what was given to us for this
[1:00:00] gentile age we know it now
[1:00:03] and it's more than just a theory and we
[1:00:06] don't have to preach it as a theory
[1:00:08] but we know god heals the sick
[1:00:12] right we know that he raises the debt
[1:00:16] we know that it didn't gifts didn't
[1:00:18] cease
[1:00:19] right because of what a prophet said you
[1:00:21] see the danger in getting away from that
[1:00:23] when people begin to get away from that
[1:00:24] and they say this cease over here and
[1:00:26] this stopped over here
[1:00:28] but god never said that you see a
[1:00:30] prophet come to open up the book
[1:00:35] so he says it's all revealed in there
[1:00:37] and the seven stills opened up the
[1:00:38] revelation of what that was
[1:00:41] again he said the mysteries and souls
[1:00:43] that are in prison now the mysteries was
[1:00:45] in the seven seals
[1:00:47] when these seven seals was opened that
[1:00:49] opened up the entire bible
[1:00:53] amen so it didn't just open up because
[1:00:56] yes the thunders is a revelation behind
[1:01:00] each of the seals
[1:01:02] what god said the reality of it not in
[1:01:05] reality form is what brother adam calls
[1:01:06] it not just the
[1:01:08] mystery form but it's not just that it
[1:01:11] was the whole bible
[1:01:13] this field was on the whole book
[1:01:16] right so it's not just that the white
[1:01:18] horse writer was the antichrist
[1:01:21] you understand but it's all the
[1:01:22] mysteries of the book
[1:01:25] right and so it opened up the entire
[1:01:27] bible
[1:01:28] and brother branham talks about how it
[1:01:30] was unfolding and you not only
[1:01:32] understand the mind of god or how that
[1:01:34] happens but you look at how it unfolded
[1:01:35] in brother branham's ministry there
[1:01:36] would come a time when
[1:01:38] marriage and divorce needed to be
[1:01:39] understood there come a time when christ
[1:01:41] is the mystery of god revealed all these
[1:01:42] things were understood
[1:01:43] as it unfolded all through his ministry
[1:01:46] and so it began even before the seals
[1:01:49] things began to open up and brother
[1:01:51] branham talks about that how it he said
[1:01:52] it's been opening up
[1:01:53] little by little and finally
[1:01:57] it was open and and god was done with it
[1:01:59] now
[1:02:00] he said the seven seals it was still
[1:02:01] with seven mysteries it was sealed with
[1:02:04] seven mysteries the seals were the mess
[1:02:05] with the mysteries
[1:02:06] once the steel is broke then you know
[1:02:09] what god said
[1:02:10] you know the reality of it and these
[1:02:11] seven seals held the entire
[1:02:14] mystery of it the entire mystery of the
[1:02:16] bible so you couldn't understand
[1:02:18] any of the bible
[1:02:22] i hope you're with me and you say well
[1:02:24] what about the part well they got some
[1:02:25] things right
[1:02:27] many things and brother madam addresses
[1:02:28] that many things they got right
[1:02:30] in fact the seventh angel didn't even
[1:02:32] have a certain mystery but he was going
[1:02:34] to tell us what was right and what was
[1:02:35] wrong
[1:02:36] but without that ministry we can't tell
[1:02:39] what's right and what's wrong
[1:02:41] and that's why you get people too far
[1:02:43] off of the message and
[1:02:44] pretty soon they got a cow eating grass
[1:02:47] on top of a tree somewhere
[1:02:49] you've got to stay with what a prophet
[1:02:51] said right and so these seven miss seals
[1:02:53] held the entire mystery of
[1:02:55] it now again
[1:02:59] and i said i was going to cow down on
[1:03:00] this a little bit to use one of brother
[1:03:02] branham's phrases i'm not
[1:03:03] really sure what cow down means but
[1:03:06] maybe some of you
[1:03:07] elderly folks could interpret that to me
[1:03:10] i've never really looked that up i don't
[1:03:12] know what cow down means
[1:03:14] but i think it means to to focus on one
[1:03:18] thing
[1:03:19] but since the opening of those seven
[1:03:21] seals
[1:03:22] he said of those angels just behind the
[1:03:25] mountain yonder
[1:03:26] this has become a new book
[1:03:30] it's the things that's been hit
[1:03:34] and now we can see it all through the
[1:03:36] book i mean you can go find the seals in
[1:03:39] uh in gideon's story of gideon
[1:03:43] you can go find about the six eight and
[1:03:45] the seventh uh
[1:03:46] the one that come the prophet that come
[1:03:47] and all those things you can find that
[1:03:49] in there
[1:03:49] you can find it in the psalms you can
[1:03:51] find it all through the bible
[1:03:53] you know when when a when a an opening
[1:03:57] or something is revealed to the people
[1:03:59] that's that's what they see
[1:04:00] when the holiness movement come on i've
[1:04:02] been reading about the history of the
[1:04:03] holiness movement before the
[1:04:04] pentecostal movement when the holiness
[1:04:06] those old itinerant holiness preachers
[1:04:09] that
[1:04:09] didn't have any education they would go
[1:04:11] out and preach holiness and they saw
[1:04:12] holiness in every scripture in the bible
[1:04:15] they preached sanctification from the
[1:04:17] story of the man that
[1:04:18] that got his eyes healed by jesus spit
[1:04:21] on in the clay and
[1:04:22] and put it on his eyes and told him to
[1:04:24] go wash and they said well that was the
[1:04:26] second blessing
[1:04:28] sanctification they saw it everywhere
[1:04:33] holiness was everywhere why because that
[1:04:35] was their anointing that's what they
[1:04:36] had revealed to them amen
[1:04:40] so we can take any scripture of the
[1:04:41] bible and show and show you and
[1:04:44] point it all points back to what the
[1:04:45] opening of the word
[1:04:47] and the whole book is open to us now so
[1:04:50] we can preach on any of it it's
[1:04:51] wonderful it doesn't
[1:04:52] just bind us to one thing say well we've
[1:04:54] got to say this just this way
[1:04:56] but it's the whole book that's been
[1:04:58] opened this has become a new book he
[1:05:00] said it's the things that's been hid
[1:05:02] it's being revealed as god promised
[1:05:05] in revelation 10 he would do it
[1:05:09] are you glad god keeps his promises
[1:05:13] amen he said in the book will not the
[1:05:16] seals will not be released
[1:05:19] until the message of the seventh angel
[1:05:23] he said and now we're back in the breach
[1:05:26] again so he's just talked about how that
[1:05:27] the angel
[1:05:28] or the seal and the thunder's two
[1:05:31] different things it's not the same thing
[1:05:33] because the seal is the mystery the
[1:05:34] thunder is the voice of god
[1:05:37] that spoke he said but the book will not
[1:05:39] the seals will not be released until the
[1:05:40] message of the seventh angel
[1:05:42] he said so we are presuming we the whole
[1:05:46] world was presuming
[1:05:48] but the genuine revelation of god
[1:05:51] will be made perfect
[1:05:56] and but alan what's interesting he
[1:05:57] didn't leave it up to be me to make it
[1:05:58] perfect
[1:06:01] right where will it be made perfect not
[1:06:04] with the ministry
[1:06:07] he didn't leave it up to the ministry to
[1:06:08] make it perfect but in
[1:06:11] in that sounding what's sounding the
[1:06:14] sounding of the seventh angel's message
[1:06:18] you don't leave it up to us to perfect
[1:06:19] the message
[1:06:22] are you with me now and we don't have to
[1:06:24] finish it up and
[1:06:25] perfect it no we're living it
[1:06:29] amen we become that's our our goal
[1:06:32] that's what we have to do is become the
[1:06:33] word
[1:06:37] now so he said so we are presuming but
[1:06:40] the genuine revelation of god will be
[1:06:42] made perfect
[1:06:43] in that sounding vindicated truth
[1:06:48] you may not understand it i may not
[1:06:49] understand all of it but i'll say this
[1:06:51] it's perfect
[1:06:55] you say well i know things brother
[1:06:56] brandon said sure he did sure he did he
[1:06:58] was human
[1:07:00] he was a man that's not what was perfect
[1:07:03] but during that sounding amen
[1:07:06] the revelation from god would be perfect
[1:07:09] remember i read you the other night the
[1:07:11] angel was never wrong
[1:07:15] amen never wrong hallelujah
[1:07:19] now he said that's exactly
[1:07:23] what the word says the mystery should be
[1:07:25] finished at that time he said
[1:07:28] this seven seal book remember it was
[1:07:31] closed here in
[1:07:32] the fifth chapter and read the tenth
[1:07:35] chapter
[1:07:36] it's opened so something had to happen
[1:07:40] he said
[1:07:44] he said now we're going to see what the
[1:07:46] book says
[1:07:47] about to become open he said it is not
[1:07:51] made known
[1:07:52] until the lamb takes the book and breaks
[1:07:56] the seals
[1:07:57] and opens the book he says see the lamb
[1:08:00] has got to take the book
[1:08:04] this had to take place in our generation
[1:08:08] he said it's it he said now remember no
[1:08:11] man in heaven
[1:08:12] no man in earth no man pope
[1:08:15] bishop cardinal state presbyter whoever
[1:08:18] he is
[1:08:19] can break them seals or reveal the book
[1:08:23] but the lamb so again that trick
[1:08:27] question i told you
[1:08:28] who opened the seals a lot of us just
[1:08:30] we'd say well brother branham did no he
[1:08:31] didn't
[1:08:33] the lamb opened the seals
[1:08:36] and the seals were broke and then he
[1:08:37] gave it to the prophet
[1:08:39] and we'll get to that in the breach how
[1:08:41] that he he said because it has to be
[1:08:43] revealed to the prophet surely the lord
[1:08:44] god will do nothing
[1:08:46] amen except he reveals it to his
[1:08:48] servants the prophets
[1:08:50] so it had to come to him but it was the
[1:08:52] lamb that opened the seals
[1:08:54] and then hands it to the prophet
[1:08:57] he said now he said whoever he is can
[1:08:59] break them seals
[1:09:01] i've done that again
[1:09:05] but and so we see the lamb is the one
[1:09:07] who does it
[1:09:08] the lamb he said and we have probed
[1:09:12] excuse me we have probed and presumed
[1:09:15] and stumbled and wondered
[1:09:19] and they said and that's the reason
[1:09:20] we're all in such a confusion
[1:09:25] i i may excuse me i may
[1:09:28] preach sunday about
[1:09:32] i i've got it on my heart if the lord
[1:09:33] lets me i'm going to preach a sermon
[1:09:35] title are we there yet
[1:09:39] you've heard that from your kids right
[1:09:44] and we wonder sometimes we probed and
[1:09:46] presumed and stumbled and wandered
[1:09:49] and that's the reason we're all in such
[1:09:50] confusion we don't have to do that
[1:09:52] anymore
[1:09:55] and there's no reason to make a mystery
[1:09:57] out of out of a revelation
[1:10:00] right cover it back up there's no reason
[1:10:02] to do that
[1:10:04] we're there we made it
[1:10:07] he said but that's the reason we're all
[1:10:09] in such a confusion he says but with the
[1:10:11] divine promise
[1:10:13] that this book of redemption will be
[1:10:15] perfectly opened by
[1:10:18] by who by the lamb how would it be
[1:10:21] opened
[1:10:22] it would be perfectly opened
[1:10:26] perfectly open i'm so glad god doesn't
[1:10:29] do anything halfway aren't you
[1:10:33] excuse me it'll be perfectly open
[1:10:37] by the lamb my vanity's getting me in
[1:10:39] trouble i'm just going to take this
[1:10:40] jacket off
[1:10:44] you forgive me now he said and the seals
[1:10:47] rove will be loosed by the lamb in the
[1:10:48] last days
[1:10:49] where when would it be loosed in the
[1:10:51] last days in which we're living now
[1:10:55] that's when it'll be done now
[1:10:58] we believe we've seen that now he said
[1:11:00] and it's not made known
[1:11:02] until the lamb takes the book and breaks
[1:11:03] the seals because remember the book was
[1:11:06] being
[1:11:07] holded he says in the hands of him that
[1:11:08] sat upon the throne the book was held by
[1:11:11] the original owner remember we preached
[1:11:13] about that
[1:11:14] what that means is it's redeemable
[1:11:17] amen it's redeemable but a redeemer
[1:11:20] still had to come
[1:11:21] you were redeemable but a redeemer had
[1:11:23] to come had to step
[1:11:25] out the lamb had to take the book
[1:11:29] sometime it had to happen and i'll say
[1:11:32] this it can't just exist in theory
[1:11:34] none of the truths of this message can
[1:11:36] just exist in theory
[1:11:38] if it's just in theory then it has no
[1:11:40] effect on our lives
[1:11:42] if just christ died for you in theory it
[1:11:45] just
[1:11:45] has no effect on you you know it
[1:11:47] happened but that doesn't make you a
[1:11:49] christian
[1:11:50] knowing it happened doesn't make you a
[1:11:51] christian but it's it's a revelation to
[1:11:54] you
[1:11:54] personally that it happened for you and
[1:11:56] you've taken advantage of that
[1:11:58] you've been washed in that blood and
[1:12:01] because you've been washed in that blood
[1:12:03] you're a part of
[1:12:04] the opening of the word you're a part of
[1:12:06] all these things that's taken place
[1:12:09] not something that happens abstractly or
[1:12:10] in another time or another place
[1:12:13] but it's something you experience
[1:12:15] yourself
[1:12:17] hey man you're a book that's been opened
[1:12:20] and next time the lord willing that we
[1:12:22] speak on this i'll get to
[1:12:23] brother brown talks about how that the
[1:12:25] seal of the holy ghost seals you to your
[1:12:27] destination it's a seal
[1:12:29] and one day it'll be broke
[1:12:32] huh and when it's broken find out what
[1:12:34] was in there
[1:12:36] amen that it wasn't just been through it
[1:12:39] that everybody thought well maybe
[1:12:40] he won't make it maybe he maybe he's not
[1:12:42] maybe they've done too many bad things
[1:12:44] but the seal was there
[1:12:46] and when the seal is broken it shows
[1:12:49] what was there
[1:12:50] who you really were so you're a shield
[1:12:52] book
[1:12:53] amen amen no one can break that seal but
[1:12:56] the lamb
[1:12:58] hallelujah thank you lord
[1:13:02] the lamb was the book was being held in
[1:13:05] the hands of him that set up on the
[1:13:06] throne
[1:13:08] i promised myself i was gonna go slow
[1:13:10] tonight so
[1:13:12] but i don't really have that much
[1:13:14] tonight so we'll
[1:13:15] move on in another service but look he
[1:13:18] said the lamb
[1:13:18] comes to him that sits upon the throne
[1:13:21] and takes the book out of his right hand
[1:13:24] he said takes the book oh that's deep he
[1:13:26] said we'll try to solve it out if we can
[1:13:27] by the help of the holy spirit
[1:13:29] now we're depending on him and we're
[1:13:32] depending on him to hear it aren't we
[1:13:35] and we will see later it is at the end
[1:13:38] time
[1:13:39] when time has run out
[1:13:42] now he says he goes on he says no
[1:13:44] denominations has a right
[1:13:46] for interpretation of the book no man
[1:13:50] has a right to interpret it
[1:13:52] it is the lamb who interprets it
[1:13:55] if we were just relying on brother
[1:13:56] branham's knowledge to interpret the
[1:13:58] book
[1:13:59] we'd be in trouble because no man has a
[1:14:02] right to interpret it
[1:14:04] lamb who interprets it
[1:14:08] i love this though he said the lamb
[1:14:10] interprets it and the lamb
[1:14:12] is the one who speaks it
[1:14:16] i said that's not skim milk
[1:14:20] now again brother brandon's voice was
[1:14:22] not the voice of god his literal voice
[1:14:24] you understand that
[1:14:25] we know that god spoke
[1:14:30] through that man and it wasn't brother
[1:14:33] branham who
[1:14:34] who spoke it
[1:14:37] was the lamb amen so we can have
[1:14:41] confidence
[1:14:42] in it church though the the man may be
[1:14:44] fallible but the lamb spoke it
[1:14:48] hallelujah amen
[1:14:51] and so you'll never convince me that
[1:14:53] well you say well this is wrong and this
[1:14:55] is wrong this is wrong but the lamb
[1:14:56] spoke it
[1:15:00] the lamb spoke it it's got to be right
[1:15:03] my understanding of it may not be right
[1:15:04] but it's
[1:15:06] it's got to be right there's got to be a
[1:15:07] truth there that can be understood
[1:15:12] so the lamb is the one who speaks it and
[1:15:14] the lamb makes the word to be known
[1:15:16] by vindicating and bringing the word to
[1:15:19] life
[1:15:20] you can know something but the lamb is
[1:15:23] the one who makes it live in your life
[1:15:25] the lamb does that the lamb opens the
[1:15:28] book the lamb
[1:15:29] reveals what's on the inside
[1:15:32] he's the one who opens the seals now he
[1:15:35] said exactly notice
[1:15:36] and it's not revealed until he said this
[1:15:40] book is not revealed
[1:15:42] i love this until the church ages
[1:15:46] and denominational ages has run out
[1:15:52] why do we keep trying to recreate
[1:15:54] denominations
[1:15:56] denominational ages are over
[1:16:00] denominational agents has run out god
[1:16:03] don't work in that system anymore
[1:16:05] as i said there may be good people out
[1:16:07] there but god don't work in that system
[1:16:09] anymore
[1:16:10] that system has rejected god it's been
[1:16:12] indicted
[1:16:14] it's just like that jewish system had
[1:16:16] had been indicted and
[1:16:18] and the veil was rent to show there was
[1:16:20] no blood there
[1:16:22] and the mercy seat had moved to christ
[1:16:24] on the cross so in this day the
[1:16:26] denominational age has run out
[1:16:29] there's no more mercy there where's the
[1:16:31] mercy at the mercy is in
[1:16:34] the one amen the lamb who's in his bride
[1:16:40] amen i said that that's
[1:16:43] deep and maybe hard to understand but
[1:16:46] you are
[1:16:47] god's mercy budget for the age that we
[1:16:49] live in
[1:16:52] the book isn't revealed until church
[1:16:54] ages and denominational ages has run out
[1:16:57] and there is time no more see it's only
[1:16:59] revealed
[1:17:00] after church ages and denominational
[1:17:02] ages has run out he repeated himself
[1:17:05] he said that's the reason the thing is
[1:17:07] in such a scruple tonight
[1:17:09] he said see they pick up a little
[1:17:10] doctrine
[1:17:12] and they run off here to one side
[1:17:16] and say this is it
[1:17:21] now people still do that in the message
[1:17:24] but it'll never be blessed by god
[1:17:27] there was a time when luther picked up
[1:17:29] the little dog the doctrine of
[1:17:30] justification and run to one side with
[1:17:32] it
[1:17:32] and this is it and it was it that's
[1:17:35] where god was moving god don't do that
[1:17:37] today
[1:17:38] why the whole books open
[1:17:41] and so when we run to one side and we
[1:17:43] can do that individually i'm not just
[1:17:45] preaching to me or
[1:17:46] other preachers or to someone out here
[1:17:48] in another church but to us
[1:17:49] each one of us individually we tend to
[1:17:51] take a little doctrine and make that
[1:17:53] most important in our lives
[1:17:56] that's the most important thing and the
[1:17:59] truth is
[1:18:00] we can't run off here to one side we've
[1:18:01] got to stay in a balance because if we
[1:18:03] pick up a little doctrine and run off to
[1:18:05] one side of one or to the other
[1:18:07] god won't bless that he said another one
[1:18:10] picks up another doctor runs off this
[1:18:12] side and said this is it
[1:18:13] and see we have to stay in the middle of
[1:18:14] the road and the middle of the road is
[1:18:16] not the middle between truth and error
[1:18:19] the middle of the road is the middle of
[1:18:21] truth
[1:18:23] right because you can become extreme in
[1:18:25] truth
[1:18:27] if you don't stay in the middle of the
[1:18:28] road but the truth
[1:18:31] you never want to go into error on
[1:18:32] either side why
[1:18:35] there's no reason to ever go in the
[1:18:36] ditch but you stay in the middle of
[1:18:39] truth
[1:18:40] and brother brandon said you won't get
[1:18:42] run over because it's a one-way street
[1:18:46] and so he said that's that's how they
[1:18:48] build the denomination each one builds
[1:18:50] the denomination under it
[1:18:52] because you gotta have some support for
[1:18:53] his doctrine
[1:18:56] can't you just see that so clear he
[1:18:58] picks up a little doctrine
[1:18:59] he runs off and builds a denomination a
[1:19:02] support system
[1:19:03] under his doctrine right and so he
[1:19:06] builds a group of
[1:19:08] people who will agree with him a bunch
[1:19:11] of preachers that can get along with him
[1:19:13] and they all fellowship together we
[1:19:15] shouldn't be doing that as message
[1:19:16] believers
[1:19:18] huh well we all agree with one another
[1:19:21] we become a
[1:19:22] an echo chamber and a yes man
[1:19:26] see we we that's not what we need we
[1:19:28] need somebody to tell us the truth
[1:19:30] brother branham got in trouble because
[1:19:32] all the preachers around him were
[1:19:33] telling him yes
[1:19:34] go for it brother branham you can do it
[1:19:36] brother branham
[1:19:37] go read the vision that he had he was
[1:19:40] trying to explain those first poll in
[1:19:42] that second poll
[1:19:43] and they said you can do it brother
[1:19:44] branham brother brown said that's why
[1:19:46] the third poll would be a complete
[1:19:48] secret it wouldn't be they wouldn't be
[1:19:51] able to do it to get to it he said
[1:19:53] because the devil would drive the wheels
[1:19:54] off of his car
[1:19:55] if it wasn't something that was a secret
[1:19:57] and so
[1:19:59] and so many people missed it because of
[1:20:01] that but it was made known to us i'm so
[1:20:03] glad
[1:20:04] for that but now each one builds a
[1:20:07] denomination under their doctrine
[1:20:09] and he said we got hundreds of
[1:20:11] denominations
[1:20:13] they built a support system and and they
[1:20:16] delineate by their teaching who's in and
[1:20:18] who's out
[1:20:20] and you say well you know this one one
[1:20:23] way is to say well we're all the same
[1:20:26] and another way is to say that i'm not
[1:20:29] the only one
[1:20:31] but then you could say because we're not
[1:20:33] all the same we know that's a lie
[1:20:36] but then you say well i'm not only the
[1:20:37] only one but if you get to preaching
[1:20:40] that everybody else is false then you
[1:20:42] are the only one
[1:20:45] right by default and the truth is if all
[1:20:49] this message produced was one church
[1:20:51] somewhere where the only person that
[1:20:53] ever could understand brother branham's
[1:20:55] message is standing in the pulpit
[1:20:56] we got a problem
[1:21:01] we got a problem that's not what the
[1:21:02] message produced
[1:21:04] see there's bride in a lot of different
[1:21:06] churches probably not everybody in every
[1:21:08] church
[1:21:09] maybe not many in every church two or
[1:21:12] three here two or three there
[1:21:14] but i want to be that one don't you i
[1:21:16] want to be the bride from this church
[1:21:18] but the church don't go in the rapture
[1:21:21] and each one builds a denomination under
[1:21:23] it
[1:21:23] until we got hundreds of denominations
[1:21:25] but still and all of it
[1:21:26] to see the confusion that people are
[1:21:28] wondering what is truth
[1:21:31] he said if that isn't just the condition
[1:21:34] today
[1:21:36] but then he promises that when that time
[1:21:39] has finished out
[1:21:42] there will be the sounding of the
[1:21:44] seventh angel's voice
[1:21:47] amen and then the book will be revealed
[1:21:51] at that time he said now don't say
[1:21:55] nobody then people ain't saved back
[1:21:57] there
[1:21:58] you know brother branham was less
[1:21:59] judgmental towards denominational people
[1:22:01] than we are towards message people
[1:22:05] it's true brother would always say it
[1:22:09] was the system
[1:22:11] all right he said but the mysteries that
[1:22:14] they couldn't understand
[1:22:16] oh my look what now see they couldn't
[1:22:18] understand how that god could be three
[1:22:20] and yet one
[1:22:21] how many understands that tonight even
[1:22:24] the children can understand that
[1:22:26] my my daughters even understood what it
[1:22:29] meant to be baptized in the name of
[1:22:31] the lord jesus christ
[1:22:34] but that was it was one of those
[1:22:35] mysteries
[1:22:37] one of those things god said that people
[1:22:39] didn't understand
[1:22:41] and so they all almost all got it wrong
[1:22:44] how that the scripture can say baptize
[1:22:46] in the name of the father son and holy
[1:22:48] and turn around and say baptized in the
[1:22:49] name of jesus
[1:22:52] oh so many things how can eve eat an
[1:22:55] apple and cause the wreckage of the
[1:22:56] whole world you see what that was
[1:22:58] eve what the bible just says that they
[1:23:01] partook of the fruit
[1:23:05] all right it doesn't tell us what
[1:23:06] happened how do we know what happened
[1:23:09] the seals have been revealed right
[1:23:14] that's that's the difference in it the
[1:23:16] seal is the mystery
[1:23:18] the revelation is the opening of the
[1:23:19] mystery
[1:23:21] amen and he said see how can these
[1:23:25] things be
[1:23:26] but those mysteries are promised to be
[1:23:28] revealed in the end time say why would
[1:23:29] god do that
[1:23:30] god did it on purpose and we could get
[1:23:33] into that because
[1:23:34] of election and jesus said he said
[1:23:37] thank you father that you've hid these
[1:23:41] revealed it to babes he told him he said
[1:23:45] blessed are your eyes because you can
[1:23:46] see
[1:23:48] amen in revelation i said he that hath
[1:23:50] the ear let him hear what the spirit
[1:23:52] says to the churches
[1:23:53] and in daniel he says that the wise
[1:23:55] would understand
[1:23:57] amen but he said seal up these things
[1:23:59] until the time of the end
[1:24:02] what what is it these mysteries are
[1:24:03] promised to be revealed when
[1:24:05] in the end time the time that we live in
[1:24:09] he said it's little loose ends little
[1:24:13] loose ends
[1:24:14] now hang on because i'm almost i'm
[1:24:16] closing in just a moment so you just
[1:24:17] hang with me
[1:24:19] these great warriors has come on the
[1:24:21] scene
[1:24:22] irenaeus martin polycarp the different
[1:24:25] ones luther wesley
[1:24:27] but the branham called them great
[1:24:28] warriors
[1:24:31] great warriors how they have come and
[1:24:33] just lived long enough
[1:24:35] to kind of bring a light and shine it
[1:24:37] but they left
[1:24:38] many things in darkness
[1:24:42] many things in darkness let me tell you
[1:24:45] church we have nothing to be ashamed of
[1:24:47] in the message of the hour you
[1:24:50] understand things that
[1:24:51] other people have been probing and
[1:24:52] looking at for years and i've read you
[1:24:54] some of what the old commentaries have
[1:24:55] said
[1:24:56] and how they said there must come
[1:24:58] someone who god would use
[1:25:00] to reveal that at the end time there
[1:25:02] must be somebody they understood that
[1:25:04] and now today people don't even care
[1:25:07] but all through the ages they understood
[1:25:09] these warriors of the faith but they
[1:25:10] didn't live long enough
[1:25:13] to see it but what was it each one come
[1:25:16] and as they
[1:25:16] go went through their life they brought
[1:25:18] just a little light and shone it
[1:25:20] but they left many things in darkness
[1:25:23] but you and i live in a time of complete
[1:25:26] light if you want to walk in it
[1:25:30] amen you only have to be as dark
[1:25:34] as you want to be
[1:25:38] are you whipping out many people in the
[1:25:40] lutheran age in the western age
[1:25:41] wish they could understand wish they
[1:25:44] could see
[1:25:45] but like jesus told the disciples that
[1:25:46] many people many prophets good men
[1:25:49] wanted to see what you see but now you
[1:25:52] only have to be in as much darkness
[1:25:54] as you will yourself to be in
[1:25:58] you can walk in light we can know how to
[1:26:00] have our homes right
[1:26:02] we can know how to have the right kind
[1:26:04] of services
[1:26:06] we can know how to have the holy ghost
[1:26:07] moving in our lives
[1:26:09] we can know how to be right with god we
[1:26:12] can know all the things all the
[1:26:13] mysteries of god have been revealed and
[1:26:15] all those things
[1:26:16] that have been revealed have fed into
[1:26:18] what we are today and what we believe
[1:26:20] and what we become as the bride
[1:26:23] and so we walk in light when we want to
[1:26:25] be in light
[1:26:27] if we walk in the light as he is in the
[1:26:29] light
[1:26:30] amen that's where we have to that's our
[1:26:33] challenge today
[1:26:35] stay in line with the word walk in the
[1:26:36] light
[1:26:38] but they left many things in darkness
[1:26:40] that's not where we live
[1:26:44] along came the pentecostal age like the
[1:26:46] lutheran age and they run out on limbs
[1:26:48] but still all right don't say they
[1:26:50] wasn't right they were
[1:26:53] he said they were but there is loose
[1:26:56] ends left
[1:26:58] that can't be explained what we say last
[1:26:59] wednesday night the loose sins
[1:27:01] was those those lines on the ship that
[1:27:04] had to be secured
[1:27:05] so the boat could sail
[1:27:08] amen there's loose ends left that can't
[1:27:10] be explained
[1:27:11] he said why the seals hasn't been broke
[1:27:15] to thoroughly reveal what these things
[1:27:18] are
[1:27:19] so the loose ends are tied up now
[1:27:23] no more loose ends for me to go find no
[1:27:26] more loose ends for you to go find
[1:27:28] all i got to find how they were tied up
[1:27:31] hey ben
[1:27:33] amen they're there so i can enjoy it
[1:27:37] i don't have to build it i don't have to
[1:27:40] put it together
[1:27:42] i can enjoy it
[1:27:45] are you with me now but so many times
[1:27:47] we're still trying to build it we're
[1:27:49] trying to justify
[1:27:50] we don't have to justify the message
[1:27:52] brother branham god
[1:27:53] identify that god vindicated that we
[1:27:56] don't have to justify a prophet let's
[1:27:58] just move on into what the prophet had
[1:28:00] to say
[1:28:01] he had a message and the message wasn't
[1:28:03] just something a prophet wanted to say
[1:28:04] it wasn't just something a man wanted to
[1:28:06] say but the message come from god
[1:28:08] it would be the revealing of those seven
[1:28:10] thunders which was the entire mystery of
[1:28:12] what god
[1:28:13] said that couldn't be understood down
[1:28:16] through the church ages but can be
[1:28:17] understood
[1:28:18] understood today aren't you glad for the
[1:28:21] hour that you live in
[1:28:23] you don't live in darkness anymore you
[1:28:25] live in light amen
[1:28:29] and how does that come down to our lives
[1:28:33] you don't live in darkness anymore you
[1:28:36] don't have to
[1:28:37] live in darkness in your homes you don't
[1:28:39] have to live in darkness in the church
[1:28:41] we have light we have light in our age
[1:28:44] even
[1:28:46] listen you say well brother brown didn't
[1:28:47] say anything about this there are
[1:28:49] certain things
[1:28:49] there was no internet back then but we
[1:28:51] have light
[1:28:53] amen so that as we come across a
[1:28:56] situation
[1:28:58] amen we know that our god's going to be
[1:29:00] able to say that giant
[1:29:02] we know that there'll be there's
[1:29:05] something in that word that will
[1:29:06] influence our thinking listen if you
[1:29:08] stay in the word there's something in
[1:29:10] there that will influence your thinking
[1:29:12] about things that didn't even exist
[1:29:14] in 1960s
[1:29:17] huh think about it they didn't have
[1:29:20] pornography
[1:29:22] they didn't have all these things but
[1:29:24] it's the word that's been revealed
[1:29:27] that influences how we handle these
[1:29:29] things
[1:29:32] amen amen why because the light
[1:29:36] come on we can see what's in the house
[1:29:40] we can go as brother brown talks about
[1:29:41] going into the arcade and
[1:29:43] he's not talking about a room full of
[1:29:45] games but he's talking about a place
[1:29:46] with
[1:29:47] goods like a walmart we can go into the
[1:29:50] walmart and look up on the shelf
[1:29:52] and find everything we want everything
[1:29:55] we ever desired is at the walmart
[1:29:58] that's the age we live in god just
[1:30:01] brought us
[1:30:02] the scriptures down and put all the
[1:30:04] promises at reach
[1:30:06] where we could reach them amen
[1:30:10] amen i got to stop
[1:30:14] he said but then in the last stage all
[1:30:16] those mysteries are to be solved and
[1:30:18] handed out
[1:30:20] amen sold and handed out who were they
[1:30:23] handed out to
[1:30:25] hallelujah they were solved and handed
[1:30:28] out first they were handed to the
[1:30:30] prophet
[1:30:30] and then it was handed to the bride
[1:30:34] amen what happened to the book that the
[1:30:36] here come the mighty angel and he gave
[1:30:38] john the book he said eat it up
[1:30:41] amen the mysteries are to be solved and
[1:30:44] handed out
[1:30:45] and the seals are to be opened by the
[1:30:47] lamb and revealed to the church
[1:30:50] and then time is no more
[1:30:53] no more denominational age
[1:30:57] no more delay no more weight
[1:31:05] any person that tells you we're waiting
[1:31:07] on anything
[1:31:09] is in error
[1:31:12] you know that's right the only thing
[1:31:15] waiting on
[1:31:16] is us to come to it and that last one to
[1:31:19] come
[1:31:19] in it's waiting on the human side not
[1:31:22] on his side
[1:31:26] amen these things have been solved and
[1:31:29] handed out and
[1:31:30] time is no more no more wondering no
[1:31:33] more probing no more
[1:31:34] making a little denomination going out
[1:31:36] here somewhere and separating ourselves
[1:31:37] from all the other believers
[1:31:40] god didn't call us to do that god didn't
[1:31:42] make me the pastor of this message
[1:31:45] i've been called the pastor here and if
[1:31:48] i don't do a good
[1:31:48] the right kind of job for here god will
[1:31:50] take me out of the way
[1:31:52] because he loves you
[1:31:56] but he called me the pastor here he made
[1:31:58] me a light to an age but i'm so glad we
[1:32:00] had one
[1:32:02] but i'm a light to my world you're a
[1:32:04] light to your world
[1:32:06] and whoever god gives you whoever god
[1:32:07] would let you be an influence on
[1:32:10] you just have to live that word in front
[1:32:11] of that person
[1:32:13] and let that book be opened in your life
[1:32:15] let that seal begin to come out of your
[1:32:17] life this is what a christian is
[1:32:20] amen he said how wonderful he said then
[1:32:24] this book the book then
[1:32:26] is a book of redemption

[1:32:33] musicians go ahead and come
[1:32:35] we'll bring in later how the 144 000 is
[1:32:37] brought in and so forth
[1:32:39] he said all right that's jew and even in
[1:32:42] brother branham's time you'll find where
[1:32:44] brother branham is and you can you can
[1:32:46] take that off now
[1:32:49] you'll find where brother branham is
[1:32:51] responding to people said we need a
[1:32:53] prophet
[1:32:55] we need a prophet to come brother brown
[1:32:57] is responding to that and said he
[1:32:58] already come
[1:33:00] you'll find out what you've been
[1:33:01] hollering for has already happened
[1:33:03] he said but they missed the awakening of
[1:33:05] the bride
[1:33:07] he said in what they're looking for is
[1:33:08] to the jews
[1:33:11] but we know where we're at we don't have
[1:33:14] to be shaken
[1:33:15] we don't have to be moved we can move

[1:33:25] wasn't that wasn't very good
[1:33:26] i beg to differ
[1:33:30] there's enough word in there to change
[1:33:32] your life
[1:33:36] not because i said it but a prophet come
[1:33:38] and told us these things
[1:33:41] and the lamb broke the seals
[1:33:45] amen and he's still hoping he's still
[1:33:47] working in your life
[1:33:49] to break the seal on your life to
[1:33:51] manifest out of you
[1:33:52] the works of a christian to make it real
[1:33:56] the thunders had to become more than
[1:33:58] just a thunder had to be a reality
[1:34:00] and the word had to become a reality in
[1:34:02] every one of our lives let's
[1:34:04] power heads together

[1:34:41] my life
[1:34:44] i don't want it to be just a theory
[1:34:48] lord even every time i study these
[1:34:50] things you just open things up
[1:34:52] even while i'm standing here in the
[1:34:53] pulpit with no notes just quotes and
[1:34:55] scriptures and
[1:34:56] i'm looking at these things and as
[1:34:58] they're coming up i it just strikes my
[1:35:00] heart
[1:35:01] even though i've looked at it for days
[1:35:04] over and over and over and listened to
[1:35:05] it
[1:35:06] but yet it just strikes my heart in a
[1:35:08] different way

[1:35:44] understand that
[1:35:46] they they got they made a denomination
[1:35:48] and didn't continue on with the word

[1:36:20] it just displayed you in a real way
[1:36:24] when it was opened in a prophet's life
[1:36:26] he'd become more humble and more sincere
[1:36:29] oh god may it be that way in every one
[1:36:31] of our lives
[1:36:32] and we become more humble more sincere
[1:36:35] more loving to one another may we never
[1:36:38] try to build a denomination on a
