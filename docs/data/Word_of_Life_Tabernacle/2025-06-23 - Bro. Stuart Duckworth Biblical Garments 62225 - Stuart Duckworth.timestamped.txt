[38:19] are his judgments, for he hath judged
[38:22] the great which did corrupt the
[38:24] earth with her fornication, and hath
[38:26] avenged the blood of his servants at her
[38:29] hand." And they said, And again they
[38:31] said, Allelujah.
[38:33] And her smoke rose up forever and ever.
[38:36] And the four and 20 elders and the four
[38:38] beasts fell down and worshiped God that
[38:41] sat on the throne saying amen,
[38:43] allelujah. A lot of hallelujah and
[38:45] hallelujah there. Amen. But he's worthy
[38:49] of our praise, isn't he? He's worthy of
[38:51] all the all the worship, everything that
[38:53] we can give him. And a voice came out of
[38:56] the throne saying, "Praise our God, all
[38:59] ye his servants, and ye that fear him,
[39:02] both small and great. And I heard as it
[39:05] were the voice of a great multitude
[39:07] and as the voice of many waters and as
[39:10] the voice of mighty thundering saying
[39:12] Allelujah for the Lord God omnipotent
[39:15] reignth. And listen to this here he said
[39:17] and let us be glad and rejoice and give
[39:19] honor to him for the marriage of the
[39:22] lamb has come and his wife hath made
[39:24] herself ready. And to her was granted
[39:27] that she should be arrayed in fine linen
[39:30] clean and white. For the fine linen is
[39:32] the righteousness of the saints. And he
[39:35] saith unto me, write, blessed are they
[39:37] which are called unto the marriage
[39:39] supper of the Lamb. And he saith unto
[39:42] me, these are the true sayings of God.
[39:44] Amen. You can be seated here this
[39:46] evening.
[39:50] We see a lot of hallelujah, a lot of
[39:52] worship going on. And and you know that
[39:57] that's what's going on in heaven. That's
[39:59] what's going on in heaven. And you know,
[40:01] a as the young man stepped stepped
[40:03] forward today to to give his life,
[40:06] commit his life to Christ, and brother
[40:08] Ben kind of kind of dealt with that. If
[40:09] we could hear the sound of heaven, if we
[40:12] could hear the sound of rejoicing when a
[40:15] sinner, when one weeps their way back,
[40:17] amen, to the father. When one comes and
[40:20] confesses the father, amen, one comes
[40:22] in, there's rejoicing going on. Amen.
[40:27] But we look, we look here, you know, the
[40:31] world, the world is preparing for war
[40:33] and destruction and judgment. And
[40:36] nations are making all kinds of
[40:38] preparations for for any possible
[40:41] scenario to defend themselves against
[40:44] enemy any any enemy known and unknown.
[40:48] We see our nation, they they they took
[40:50] bombers over there to destroy what what
[40:52] they believed to be weapons that could
[40:54] destroy Israel. that could potentially
[40:57] destroy other parts of the world. And
[41:00] and we know these things have got to
[41:01] come about. We know that these things
[41:03] are there will be wars and rumors of
[41:05] war, you know, but but I I want to say
[41:07] this this morning or this evening rather
[41:10] that, you know, God has got everything
[41:12] in control. And you think about Israel
[41:14] over there in in that place. And we know
[41:16] that all nations are going to turn
[41:18] against Israel. But we know this one
[41:21] thing that Israel, while the elect,
[41:23] while the 144,000 are there, that that
[41:26] they will never be destroyed. Why?
[41:28] Because God cannot allow it. Because he
[41:32] said, he said in the Bible, we'll hold
[41:33] back the winds until the servants of our
[41:36] God are sealed in their foreheads. Amen.
[41:39] We we see in the in the in the world
[41:41] wars and we've seen that those winds
[41:42] were held back. And it wasn't only just
[41:45] the the elect of the servants of Israel.
[41:47] Amen. But there was young people. There
[41:49] was me. There was you. Amen. Amen. So
[41:52] God's got it all in control. God's not
[41:54] going to let anything happen. Amen.
[41:56] Amen. Until Amen. the elect are sealed
[41:59] away. Amen. Amen. Israel, the 144,000,
[42:03] they're just sitting and they're just
[42:04] waiting over there. Amen. For the church
[42:07] to get out of the way. Amen. For the for
[42:09] the for the the last elected seed to be
[42:11] called, for the last elected seed to
[42:13] come in, and then the gospel can return
[42:16] back to the Jews. Then they can have
[42:18] their chance at the Holy Ghost. They can
[42:20] have their chance and the taste of the
[42:22] salvation of the Holy Ghost. The same
[42:24] Holy Ghost, amen, that we have in our
[42:26] hearts, Amen. They will have an
[42:28] opportunity at that.
[42:31] So you can think, you can think this
[42:34] that all the barges and and everything
[42:37] that that Satan can try to put on you,
[42:39] Amen. Amen. It cannot destroy you. Amen.
[42:42] Because you are the elect of God. Amen.
[42:44] God has a purpose for your life.
[42:47] Thank you, Lord. We see here the world
[42:50] is making, you know, they're making
[42:52] preparations.
[42:53] They're in the spirit of destruction.
[42:56] They're in the spirit of judgment. And
[42:58] brother Brandham talked about how the
[42:59] the clock is 3 minutes from midnight.
[43:02] And if we could look at it now, it it
[43:04] would be maybe three milliseconds from
[43:06] midnight. It's right there. Amen. It's
[43:08] closer than we he he would preach it.
[43:10] It's closer than we think. It's closer
[43:12] than we think. And the purpose of that
[43:14] is not to scare anybody, but that that
[43:16] we can be ready. Not that we're we're
[43:18] making ready out of fear of of what
[43:21] could happen, but we're we're making
[43:22] ready because God has called us to be
[43:25] ready in this hour.
[43:28] So the world the world knows something
[43:30] is going to take place. They can feel
[43:32] it. They're in that spirit.
[43:36] And so, Brother Ram said, "The the
[43:38] church the church is just falling
[43:40] asleep, but the bride is waiting for the
[43:43] summons to come up higher." Amen. Is
[43:46] that the voice that you're that you're
[43:47] listening for? Is that the sound that
[43:49] you're listening for? Amen. Amen. As we
[43:51] come through the church ages and the
[43:53] understanding that we have for that, we
[43:55] realize in Revelations 4, Amen. When
[43:57] that voice and that summon is a call to
[44:00] come up higher, come up out of the slay
[44:02] to see an age. Come up out of the
[44:03] tribulation. Amen. that is sending it
[44:05] upon the earth. I know this is
[44:07] oldfashioned and I'm not trying to scare
[44:09] nobody, but it's a reality. Amen. We're
[44:11] coming to the end of the end. Amen.
[44:13] Amen. Where the spirit of God is going
[44:15] to summons you and I to come up higher.
[44:18] Amen. We've got to have an ear to hear
[44:21] what the spirit is saying. Amen. Not
[44:23] just a not just a voice upon the earth.
[44:25] Amen. But a voice a shouting from
[44:27] heaven. Amen. A voice to call us from
[44:30] heaven.
[44:31] Amen. Yes, sir. Thank you, Lord. I'm
[44:36] just preaching. I'm not I'm not super
[44:38] comfortable with my notes and so I'm
[44:40] just preaching I'm just I'm just
[44:42] preaching what's on my heart here. Okay.
[44:44] Amen. Amen.
[44:48] And brother Ram, he would say, "And we
[44:51] better be ready for it's going to come
[44:53] in an hour." The Bible says, "When you
[44:55] thinkketh not, right?" And he would say
[44:58] in 1961,
[45:00] he would say, "The Pentecostal revival
[45:04] is over." And we heard that this
[45:06] morning. Uh the world is crying. They're
[45:08] they're wanting another revival. They're
[45:10] wanting this to happen. And yet, they
[45:11] missed their awakening. They missed
[45:12] their revival. But he said, "The message
[45:15] has went forth." He said, "Everything is
[45:18] ready now and waiting." He said, "The
[45:20] church is sealed away." He said, "The
[45:23] wicked are doing more wicked. Churches
[45:25] are becoming more churchy, but the
[45:27] saints are coming closer to God. Amen. I
[45:30] pray tonight this evening that we can
[45:32] put ourselves in that position that
[45:34] we're not letting our lives be choked
[45:36] out by the things of this life, by the
[45:38] things of this world. Amen. We we were
[45:40] talking about in the back u you know
[45:42] that there's so much being put upon us.
[45:45] There's so much bombardment on our minds
[45:47] and and trying to draw our attention
[45:49] away. Do you understand that? We we
[45:51] understand that it's a hard time to live
[45:53] in. There's a lot coming at us. There's
[45:55] a lot coming at our young people and
[45:57] they're going to need all the help they
[45:59] can get. Amen. Amen. I'm going to need
[46:01] all the help I can get. Amen. And if
[46:03] you're in in need of something tonight,
[46:04] if you're in need of help, we're here to
[46:06] help one another. We're here to lift
[46:08] each other up. I don't want to see a
[46:10] brother or sister, amen, go by the
[46:12] wayside. I don't want to go by the
[46:13] wayside. Amen. Amen. But if I'm down,
[46:16] Amen. Amen. Pick me up. Amen. Let's
[46:19] bring each other together. Amen. Let's
[46:20] not leave one behind. Amen. Let's pick a
[46:23] brother up. Let's pick a sister up.
[46:25] Amen. Because we're all Amen. We're all
[46:27] trying to get to the same place.
[46:30] We're all trying to get closer to God.
[46:32] That's right. I don't want to be what he
[46:34] talked about the church becoming more
[46:36] churchy cuz that's not what that's not
[46:38] what he's coming back for. He's coming
[46:40] back for a bride that's like him, that's
[46:42] looking for him, that's longing for him.
[46:46] Now, I'll try not to hold you too long
[46:48] tonight.
[46:51] You love the Lord.
[46:53] And we think about it, how much more can
[46:56] we say, amen, 60 years later. Amen. All
[46:59] these years after the seals were open,
[47:02] amen, there is a people who are standing
[47:04] on the message of the hour. Amen. The
[47:07] word is open to the bride. Amen. The
[47:09] word is open to her. The word is open to
[47:12] you. Amen. Amen. And and not only is it
[47:14] open to you, but your life must be open
[47:17] to it. Your life must be on on on
[47:20] display and and to full exposure to the
[47:22] word of God, to the fullness of the word
[47:24] of God to benefit from it.
[47:28] That's right.
[47:30] We look here, Revelations 10:8 and 11.
[47:35] And the voice which I heard from heaven
[47:36] spake unto me again, said, "Go and take
[47:38] the little book which is open in the
[47:42] hand of the angel." Listen to this. And
[47:44] which standeth upon the sea and upon the
[47:46] earth. and I went. All right. So, the
[47:50] bride has to make herself ready. As we
[47:52] read, you have something. You have an
[47:55] effort. You have something that you have
[47:56] to put forth. Come on. It said, "And I
[47:59] went unto the angel and said unto him,
[48:02] give me the little book." And he said
[48:05] unto me, "Take it." Eat it up, and it
[48:09] shall make thy belly bitter, but th it
[48:12] shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey. So
[48:15] I went and I took the book. I took the
[48:18] book out of the angel's hand and ate it
[48:20] up. And it was in my mouth sweet as
[48:22] honey. Just as he said. It was just as
[48:25] he said. And as soon as I had eaten it,
[48:27] my belly was bitter. Just as he said.
[48:31] Brother said it was hard to digest. It
[48:32] was so good. The word is so good. The
[48:35] message of the hour is so good. But the
[48:38] digesting part is the hard part.
[48:42] When we begin to make ourselves ready
[48:44] when we begin to prepare ourselves, we
[48:47] love to hear the things of God and we
[48:49] can hear them over and over and over and
[48:52] over. We can pick up the Christ of the
[48:54] mystery of God revealed and you can
[48:55] listen to these things over and over and
[48:57] how sweet it is in our mouth. But when
[49:00] we begin to digest, it's bitter. It's
[49:04] hard,
[49:05] right? That's the hard part.
[49:10] But it's going to be hard. It's not
[49:12] meant to be easy, right? And any I tell
[49:15] my kids, you know, we're we're batting
[49:17] practice and we're we're I'm getting
[49:18] them to try different things and dad,
[49:20] that's hard. It's hard to do it like
[49:22] that. But if you do anything the right
[49:25] way, it's harder. It's easier to do it
[49:27] the wrong way, right? It's hard to do it
[49:30] the right way. And so, it's not an easy
[49:33] road to be a Christian. It's not an easy
[49:35] road. It's not an easy life. Amen. It's
[49:37] not it's not all butterflies and
[49:39] unicorns. I mean, there's battles,
[49:41] there's struggles, there's things you go
[49:43] with, but on the other side of it, it's
[49:45] worth it, right? Amen.
[49:51] But in his in his belly, it was bitter.
[49:54] And he said unto me, "Thou must prophesy
[49:57] again before many people's nations,
[49:59] tongues, and kings."
[50:01] You know, and I've always had a problem
[50:03] with this that, you know, we can't make
[50:05] Brother Brandham the mighty angel, the
[50:07] seventh angel, and John all at the same
[50:10] time. It's three different people.
[50:13] Brother Ram said that mighty angel, he
[50:15] said it's the same one in Revelations
[50:18] one, the one like unto the son of man.
[50:20] Amen. Only the lamb could come. Only the
[50:23] lamb could come. The mighty angel. He
[50:25] was the only one that could come and
[50:26] open and loose the seals. Amen. Amen. To
[50:29] change our lives. to change our heart.
[50:31] He was the only one that could do that.
[50:33] Amen. Amen. And he's the only one that
[50:35] could send the revelation down in this
[50:37] hour. Amen. And there had to be an
[50:39] angel. There had to be a seventh angel.
[50:42] Amen. And it's not the same person.
[50:45] Come on. Each is a different person, the
[50:48] mighty angel. Amen. And there was only
[50:50] one worthy that could break the seals
[50:53] and open. There was only one seventh
[50:54] angel messenger. Right. And he told us,
[50:58] that messenger told us that John taught
[51:01] the bride, right? So to me, he's not
[51:05] trying to make himself all that. He
[51:07] knows who he is. He knows who the mighty
[51:10] angel is, and he types the bride as
[51:13] John, right?
[51:16] And so the bride has to realize that
[51:20] there is a book. All right? She had to
[51:23] be made aware that there was a book. All
[51:26] right? And the bride has to request the
[51:29] book. All right?
[51:32] You've got to go ask for it yourself.
[51:35] All right. Come on. And then you've got
[51:38] to take the book. All right. You got to
[51:41] realize there's a there's a book. That's
[51:43] right. Right.
[51:46] You've got to request the book. Then you
[51:48] got to take the book. And then you've
[51:50] got to eat the book. Come on. All right.
[51:53] It's good in your mouth, right? Y'all
[51:56] wake up here. Y'all wake up now. Hey,
[52:01] you got to eat the book. It's good in
[52:02] your mouth, but then you got to digest
[52:03] it. Oh, man. Oh, that's the hard part,
[52:07] right? Come on. But from that, that's
[52:11] when you become the word. And when you
[52:14] digest it, then you're called to go
[52:17] prophesy again. Amen. You've got a
[52:20] testimony. Amen. From the things of God.
[52:23] Amen. From the word of God. From the
[52:25] opening of the word. You've got just as
[52:27] much part. These young people have just
[52:29] as much part as anybody does. Amen. From
[52:32] the from the from the front to the back.
[52:34] Amen. We've all been called to digest
[52:36] the word and to prophesy again. Amen. To
[52:39] have a testimony. Amen. Of the revealed
[52:41] word of the hour, the anointing of the
[52:43] hour. Amen. Amen. That there is a people
[52:45] that can digest the word. There is a
[52:47] people that will lay their lives out.
[52:49] Amen. Amen. and make themselves ready
[52:53] and become the book. Amen. Jesus was the
[52:56] Old Testament. Everything that it was,
[52:58] he was he fulfilled every bit of the Old
[53:01] Testament, all of the law. Amen. He
[53:03] didn't do away with the law, but he
[53:05] magnified the law. Amen. And we can't
[53:07] get by in this hour of picking out what
[53:09] we want and and putting this thing aside
[53:11] and putting our own idea. Amen. We've
[53:12] got to come to the fullness of the word.
[53:14] Amen. And we've got to be we've got to
[53:16] take the book and eat the book and
[53:18] become the book. Amen. We can't we can't
[53:20] pick pick and choose what we want to
[53:21] believe and and live. Amen. We've got to
[53:23] live it all. Thank you, Lord.
[53:27] Amen. Do you love the Lord? You love me.
[53:31] Yes, sir.
[53:34] So, Brother Ram says here in 1964,
[53:37] he says, "When that which is perfect has
[53:39] come, that which is in part shall be
[53:41] done away with." to all these little
[53:42] jumpings of things up and down like a
[53:44] kid trying to talk in tongues, all these
[53:46] other things when that which is perfect.
[53:48] He said we do have today by God's help
[53:50] the perfect interpretation of the word
[53:53] with divine vindication. We've heard
[53:56] these things before, but he said then
[53:57] that which is in part is done away with.
[54:00] When I was a child, I spake as a child.
[54:02] I understood as a child, but when I
[54:04] became a man, I put away childish
[54:07] things. So what's he telling us here?
[54:08] that we have the complete, we have
[54:10] everything that we need. Amen. We're not
[54:12] looking for something down the road.
[54:14] We're not looking for some special
[54:16] revelation. But God is by divine uh
[54:19] vindication, divine vindication has
[54:21] brought forth the fullness of the
[54:23] interpretation of the word. Amen. Amen.
[54:26] I say tonight, you have what you need.
[54:28] You have what you need to make a
[54:30] rapture. Amen. You have what you need to
[54:32] make a body change. Amen. You just got
[54:34] to go partake. Amen. You've got to
[54:36] you've got to ingest it. You've got to
[54:37] digest it and you've got to speak the
[54:39] word and go forward.
[54:43] Amen. The bride has what she needs to
[54:45] make ready. Amen. The world is getting
[54:47] ready for destruction. But the bride is
[54:50] making ready to meet her Lord Jesus in
[54:52] the sky as old as it may sound. Amen.
[54:54] Amen. That's the expectation of the true
[54:56] believer. Amen. To meet the Lord Jesus.
[54:59] Amen. To fly above the judgment and the
[55:01] horrible things that are coming upon
[55:03] this earth. Amen. for those outside of
[55:06] Christ.
[55:09] While the the most horrible time the
[55:11] earth has ever seen is setting in, the
[55:14] bride is making ready for the
[55:15] resurrection. Thank you, Lord.
[55:18] What about what about the rapture? You
[55:20] got to have the resurrection first.
[55:23] What about the rapture? Your body's got
[55:25] to be changed before you go on the
[55:26] rapture. That's true, right? And that
[55:29] takes place here. Amen. In the this
[55:31] world, Amen. in this earth that you walk
[55:34] on. Amen. Those things will take place
[55:36] on the ground that you walk on. Amen.
[55:39] Your footsteps in this life are your
[55:41] possession. Amen. This earth is our
[55:44] dominion. This earth, Amen. Amen. We're
[55:46] not going to overcome later on. We're
[55:48] not going to overcome over yonder. We're
[55:50] not going to get to heaven and worship.
[55:51] Amen. But Amen. as we walk this earth.
[55:54] Amen. This is our possession. Amen. And
[55:56] we will overcome on this side of
[55:58] Leodysia. On this side of the rapture,
[56:01] we will overcome. Amen. And brother
[56:02] Brennham said in the Holy Ghost series,

[56:46] must prophesy again. Come on. So, we
[56:49] have the body change, the rapture, a
[56:51] meeting in the air, a wedding supper.
[56:53] So, that's the expectation that we're
[56:55] under as believers. Amen. But and the
[56:57] Bible says that those days, those last
[57:00] days would be cut short for the elect's
[57:03] sake. And that's a time and the hour
[57:05] that we live in when the sealing of the
[57:07] elect, the bride, the last one. Amen.
[57:09] And the sealing of the elect, the
[57:11] servants, Israel, is what is holding
[57:13] back. Brother Rab said the the judgment
[57:15] is overdue. The judgment is overdue.
[57:18] It's long past due. It was long past
[57:20] due. Amen. In in in Moses time, they

[57:51] to be a bride. There's going to be a
[57:53] wedding supper served in the skies.

[58:26] They got the material to make themselves
[58:27] ready. And if you notice, he says she
[58:29] made herself ready.
[58:32] That's right.
[58:33] Brother B would say what a horrible time
[58:35] it is for the unbeliever.
[58:38] But what a glorious time it is for true
[58:40] Christians, those with life on the
[58:43] inside. Amen. It's not a time to be
[58:45] slothful and loose, but to surrender and
[58:48] consecrate all you are. Amen. A time to
[58:52] draw near to God, and he will draw nigh
[58:54] unto you. It's a time of worship.
[58:59] Amen. As we read in Revelations 19, all
[59:01] heaven was rejoicing, saying,
[59:03] "Hallelujah.
[59:05] Salvation, deliverance, glory, and
[59:07] honor, and power be to the Lord our
[59:09] God."
[59:10] As we read, it was a voice of great
[59:12] multitude, a voice of many waters, a
[59:15] voice of mighty thundering, saying,
[59:16] "Hallelujah, for the Lord God omnipotent
[59:19] reignth." Amen. Amen. That's a worship.

[1:00:30] the Holy Ghost. Obedience to the word
[1:00:32] entitles you to the Holy Ghost. Amen.

[1:00:38] that he is a deliverer, that he is our
[1:00:41] healer, sir. That he is more than able
[1:00:43] to do what he said he will do. Is that
[1:00:46] your testimony here tonight? Is that
[1:00:48] your testimony in in the hour that we
[1:00:50] live in? That God is more than able to
[1:00:52] do what he said he will do. Amen. Amen.
[1:00:55] Is that the faith and the love that you
[1:00:57] have back to him? Amen. That's the
[1:00:59] spirit that the bride is under.
[1:01:02] Thank you, Lord. Brother Bram said here,
[1:01:05] Revelations chapter 4. I'm gonna keep
[1:01:07] plowing, brother Ben. I'm gonna keep
[1:01:10] plowing.
[1:01:12] I'm gonna keep plowing, y'all.
[1:01:16] He said, "All right, here was voices."
[1:01:20] Oh, how we need in Jeffersonville
[1:01:22] thousands of live voices. The thunder of
[1:01:24] God thundering out of sweetness and
[1:01:27] holiness,
[1:01:29] purity,
[1:01:30] undefiled lives.
[1:01:33] undefiled lives walking around in the
[1:01:36] earth today
[1:01:38] without any without a blemish. He said,
[1:01:40] "Yes, sir. That's real Christians.
[1:01:43] That's thunder against the enemy. Oh my
[1:01:46] voice. That's what God wants in Hardy.
[1:01:50] That's what he That's what he wants. And
[1:01:52] wherever you live, wherever you go to
[1:01:54] school, whatever you're doing, God wants
[1:01:57] a voice.
[1:01:58] He wants a voice. He wants somebody
[1:02:00] that'll live right and act right and do
[1:02:02] right without a blemish without a spot.
[1:02:05] Oh, thank you. Quit tearing that box up,
[1:02:07] Luke.
[1:02:12] You want somebody with a testimony.
[1:02:14] Yeah.
[1:02:17] You sisters with your skirts, you're a
[1:02:18] testimony.
[1:02:20] That's simple, but you're a testimony.
[1:02:24] You're a light in the darkness.
[1:02:28] We were at a softball tournament several
[1:02:29] several weeks ago. My daughter plays
[1:02:32] softball and hundreds of girls. She's
[1:02:36] the only one wearing a skirt. Every now
[1:02:38] and then you'll you'll meet somebody
[1:02:39] wearing a skirt. You'll but most of the
[1:02:41] time it's just her. this man, he had a
[1:02:43] had a booth set up trying to do
[1:02:45] something and trying to spread the
[1:02:47] gospel as good as he knew and and you
[1:02:50] know, just handing out pamphlets and
[1:02:52] talking to people and and he seen my
[1:02:54] wife come by and he said, "I'd like to
[1:02:56] know the story behind the skirt."
[1:02:59] But you stand out. You stand out. What
[1:03:02] is it? You're dressed in the word. It's
[1:03:05] a biblical garment. It's not legalism.
[1:03:08] Come on. Right.
[1:03:12] And beyond just a garment, we must be
[1:03:15] clothed with a sweet, gentle, meek
[1:03:18] spirit. For that's the spirit of a
[1:03:20] Christian, right? Amen.
[1:03:24] It's a voice.
[1:03:26] He said, "Yes, sir. That's real
[1:03:28] Christians. That's thunder against the
[1:03:29] enemy. The devil don't care how loud you
[1:03:32] can holler. The devil don't care how
[1:03:34] much you can jump or how much you can do
[1:03:36] this or shout. But what hurts the devil
[1:03:38] is to see that sanctified
[1:03:41] holy life consecrated to God. Say
[1:03:43] anything to him. Call him anything just
[1:03:45] as sweet as it can be be. Move right on.
[1:03:48] He said that throws him away. That's a
[1:03:50] that's a thunder that shakes the devil.
[1:03:52] Amen. A thunder that shakes the devil.
[1:03:54] That's the kind of life that I want to
[1:03:56] live. Not just to put on. Amen. To be
[1:03:58] but to be connected. Christianity is
[1:04:01] more than a put on. It's more than a
[1:04:03] skirt. It's more than long hair. It's
[1:04:05] more than more than that. Amen. But it's
[1:04:07] connected to the word of God. It's
[1:04:09] connected to a life. Amen. It's
[1:04:11] connected to to an understanding. It's
[1:04:14] connected to a revelation. And it takes
[1:04:16] a revelation. Amen. To make it. It takes
[1:04:19] a revelation to be a Christian. It takes
[1:04:21] revelation to be a son or daughter of
[1:04:22] God. Amen. And what is revelation?
[1:04:24] Revelation is faith. Amen. Something
[1:04:27] that God personally revealed to you.
[1:04:29] Amen. And how is something personally
[1:04:31] revealed to you? Amen. I don't just want
[1:04:33] do just want any old thing to live by
[1:04:35] any old creed or denomination. Amen. But
[1:04:37] we want to live from the life source
[1:04:39] from the word of God. Amen. And a
[1:04:41] Christian when they feed upon that.
[1:04:43] Amen. You're giving God an opportunity
[1:04:45] to show you who you are. You're giving
[1:04:47] God an opportunity to reveal himself to
[1:04:50] you. Amen. Let's not cut ourselves out
[1:04:53] off from that. Amen. Amen. God reveal
[1:04:55] yourself to me. Brother said revelation
[1:04:57] is more important to you than you than
[1:04:59] you realize. Amen. For revelation is
[1:05:02] what overcomes the gates of hell. It's
[1:05:04] what overcomes the enemy.
[1:05:06] It takes a revelation more than somebody
[1:05:10] telling you something, but Amen. It's
[1:05:12] you making yourself ready.
[1:05:16] It's you taking the time.
[1:05:18] That's right. Amen.
[1:05:22] It don't all come at once,
[1:05:24] right? You're getting dressed to go
[1:05:27] somewhere. Jesus put garment on and
[1:05:29] you're making ready,
[1:05:31] fixing yourself up piece by piece.
[1:05:35] You're making yourself ready because
[1:05:37] you're going somewhere, right? So, it
[1:05:40] takes time. It doesn't all come at once.
[1:05:43] Amen. But the the the the purpose of the
[1:05:45] ministry, and we'll try to get into this
[1:05:48] later, is to build us all up together,
[1:05:50] to bring us to the unity, the faith that
[1:05:52] we could all come together, right?
[1:05:55] Come on.
[1:05:57] Not that we'd have a bunch up here and a
[1:05:59] bunch down here, but to bring us all up
[1:06:02] together to the same spot that we can
[1:06:05] all go up together, right?
[1:06:10] So, a true Christian is a thundering
[1:06:12] voice. Remember this young people, a
[1:06:15] true Christian is a thundering voice to
[1:06:17] the devil and a testimony of what God
[1:06:20] can do to a surrendered heart. Amen.
[1:06:23] Amen. Brother talks about you can live
[1:06:24] so close to God that the devil don't
[1:06:26] know what to do with you. Amen. That's
[1:06:29] your footsteps. That's your possessions.
[1:06:30] Amen. That's the overcoming grace that
[1:06:33] God is giving to you and I. Amen. By
[1:06:35] revelation by the Holy Ghost. And that
[1:06:38] that's truly what we're we're dressing
[1:06:39] ourselves in. It's the Holy Ghost. Amen.
[1:06:42] It's not a spirit of the world. It's not
[1:06:44] the spirit of a man. It's not the spirit
[1:06:46] of false doctrine. Amen. Amen. But this
[1:06:48] church was is without spot or wrinkle.
[1:06:50] Amen. She's been ironed out. Amen. with
[1:06:53] a hot press. Amen. Every little wrinkle
[1:06:55] wrinkle is ironed out. Amen. Because God
[1:06:57] has given you what you have need of that
[1:07:00] he can present himself a glorious
[1:07:03] church.
[1:07:12] Brother Ram says here, marriage of the
[1:07:13] lamb. And I'll tell you at the end of
[1:07:16] that sermon, man, he was really getting
[1:07:17] on him there.
[1:07:19] Really preaching hard to him. go to the
[1:07:21] listen to the the end of that. He said
[1:07:24] trying to get people to come to the
[1:07:26] altar said well not even somebody just
[1:07:28] raise one hand
[1:07:31] somebody this one person
[1:07:35] but he says here if the Lord so he says
[1:07:38] so many says if the Lord will take this
[1:07:40] evil spirit from me from drinking or
[1:07:42] gambling or lying or stealing I'll serve
[1:07:44] him he said but that's up to you see
[1:07:47] you've got something to do they that
[1:07:49] overcome shall inherit all things they
[1:07:52] that overcome you have power to do it,
[1:07:55] but you must be willing to lay it down.
[1:07:57] Yes, sir. He said, you must be willing
[1:07:59] to lay it down. He said, she has made
[1:08:01] herself ready. He said, I like that
[1:08:02] word. He said, see, God could push you
[1:08:04] through a little pipe, pull us out on
[1:08:06] the other side, and then saying,
[1:08:08] blessed, how can he say, blessed is he
[1:08:09] that overcometh. You had nothing to
[1:08:11] overcome. He just pushed you through it.
[1:08:13] But when you've got to make decisions,
[1:08:15] when you've got to make decisions, Amen.
[1:08:17] Amen. You have the ability to lay it
[1:08:19] down. You have the ability, Amen. God
[1:08:22] can't lay it down for you. You've got to
[1:08:23] be willing to quit worshiping that
[1:08:25] habit. You've got to be willing to quit
[1:08:27] worshiping that thing. Amen. And lay it
[1:08:29] down. And God gives you the overcoming
[1:08:32] power. Amen. Amen. You've got to be able
[1:08:35] to make that decision. He said, "I've
[1:08:36] got to be able to make decisions for
[1:08:37] myself." In doing that, we show our
[1:08:39] faith and our respect to God.
[1:08:44] So, just sitting on a pew won't do it.
[1:08:46] Growing up in a message home just won't
[1:08:48] do it. Growing up in a message church
[1:08:51] won't do it. Sitting in idle by won't
[1:08:53] help. We've got to be willing to forsake
[1:08:55] all to inherit. Amen. Let the old things
[1:08:57] of this world. Let the old things of
[1:08:59] this life of our old nature of what we
[1:09:02] were and the things that you know we may
[1:09:04] we may think is funny and the the things
[1:09:06] we did when we were younger. Amen. Let
[1:09:07] all that pass away. Let and put on the
[1:09:10] new man. Put on the new man. Amen. And
[1:09:12] let him have his way.
[1:09:17] Let it all pass away.

[1:09:22] You've got to let it all pass away.
[1:09:26] The old man, don't go back and dig him
[1:09:29] up. He's buried. He's buried. And every
[1:09:34] now and then,
[1:09:37] you'll feel him crawling up on the back
[1:09:39] back of you trying to come out. That is
[1:09:42] a dead man. Come on. And the man with
[1:09:45] life.
[1:09:47] Not a not a new you, but a new man. Not
[1:09:50] the old you worked over, but the new
[1:09:53] man, Christ in you, working his will,
[1:09:56] working his way. Amen. Amen. The old
[1:09:59] things have passed away. You got to be
[1:10:00] willing to lay aside the favor. You
[1:10:02] listen to this. You got to be willing.
[1:10:05] You've got to be willing and not be
[1:10:06] ashamed. You've got to be willing to lay
[1:10:08] aside the favor of the world, the favor
[1:10:11] of man to gain the favor of God. And
[1:10:14] that's the thing right there. You've got
[1:10:15] to be willing to not be scared. You've
[1:10:18] got to be willing to not live in fear of
[1:10:20] what somebody else says, what somebody
[1:10:22] else thinks. I find myself preaching to
[1:10:24] young people, and I'm sorry, boys and
[1:10:26] girls. But don't live in fear. Don't
[1:10:29] worry about what nobody says. Amen. If

[1:10:41] other day. God said this." And just let
[1:10:43] it let it come out in you. Let it let it
[1:10:45] live through you. Amen. Yes, sir.
[1:10:49] Don't let nobody beat you down. Don't
[1:10:51] let the world beat you down. Amen. Don't
[1:10:55] be ashamed of the gospel of Jesus
[1:10:57] Christ. For it is the power. It is the
[1:11:00] salvation. Amen. It's the lifegiving
[1:11:02] source. Amen. That we clothe ourselves
[1:11:04] in, that we make ourselves ready in.

[1:11:18] He quickened me. Amen. With that
[1:11:19] resurrection life, with that
[1:11:21] resurrection power. Amen. How could we

[1:11:27] omnipotent of the glory of Jesus Christ
[1:11:30] in our life.
[1:11:32] All right. Thank you, Lord. Help us,
[1:11:35] Lord.
[1:11:39] I'll try to hurry here.

[1:11:45] his mind,
[1:11:47] then you can endure,
[1:11:50] then you can possess. Amen.
[1:11:52] He says in the marriage of lamb, Abraham
[1:11:54] was promised a child, but he must but he
[1:11:56] must maintain this promise for 25 years,
[1:11:59] the ups and downs that he had, the
[1:12:00] temptations in those 25 years, but he
[1:12:03] held to the word of the promise. And
[1:12:05] man, he had something to do. He had to
[1:12:08] he had something to do. Israel was
[1:12:09] promised a promised land, but they had
[1:12:11] to fight for every inch of it. Wherever
[1:12:13] the souls of your foot treads upon, that
[1:12:15] I have given you. So their their feet
[1:12:17] had to go to that spot. All right? They
[1:12:20] had to walk to that spot. And then God
[1:12:23] gave it to them. And if you can just get
[1:12:24] to that spot in your walk with the Lord,
[1:12:27] if you can just get to that spot, amen,
[1:12:29] and and you know, say, you know, I don't
[1:12:31] want to live like that no more. I
[1:12:32] believe that there's more for me. And if
[1:12:34] you believe that there's more for you,
[1:12:36] if there's a hunger and a thirst, I
[1:12:37] believe that sincerely, if you're
[1:12:39] sincere, amen, there is more for you.
[1:12:41] Amen. But you got to keep walking in the
[1:12:43] word. You got to keep walking in your
[1:12:45] experience with God. Amen. Amen. And
[1:12:48] it's got to be sweeter. It's got to be
[1:12:50] sweeter now than what it was 20, 30, 40
[1:12:53] years ago. Amen. And if it ain't, we
[1:12:55] need to get back to an altar. We need to
[1:12:56] get back before God. Amen. If it's not
[1:12:58] just as sweet today as it was back then.
[1:13:03] Good. They had to fight for every inch.
[1:13:06] Wherever the souls of your foot treads
[1:13:08] upon that, I've given you, God said to
[1:13:10] Joshua, it was all there. The land was
[1:13:13] there, but God gave it to them, but they
[1:13:15] must fight for him. He said, it's the
[1:13:18] same way about divine healing. God has
[1:13:19] got the power to heal you if you've got
[1:13:22] the courage to accept it.
[1:13:25] But you'll fight every inch of the way.
[1:13:28] The devil ain't going to make it easy on
[1:13:29] you. He said, "God has got amazing grace
[1:13:32] to save you. And he'll do it." But
[1:13:36] you'll have to fight every inch of your
[1:13:39] way. It's amazing grace. It's yours. But
[1:13:43] you've got to fight. You got to make
[1:13:45] yourself ready. You've got something to
[1:13:47] do. Amen. You got to push your way. You
[1:13:49] got to press. You got to press on. Press
[1:13:52] on in Jesus name. Amen. He goes on to
[1:13:55] say, "I've been behind the pool pit
[1:13:57] going on 31 years." He said, "Every inch
[1:13:59] of that has been a fight constantly." It
[1:14:01] certainly has. But he said, "But we must
[1:14:04] fight if we must reign." Amen. Church,
[1:14:06] it's not going to be easy. Amen. Amen.
[1:14:08] The world is going to give you an easy
[1:14:10] way out. They're going to give you show
[1:14:11] you this and that. They're going to give
[1:14:13] you an easy way out. Amen. But I'll take
[1:14:15] the way with the Lord's despite you.
[1:14:17] I'll take the hard way over the easy
[1:14:19] way. Amen. I'll take the straight and
[1:14:21] narrow way. Amen. To walk with God's
[1:14:23] children. Amen. And our footsteps are
[1:14:25] our possession. If you can put your foot
[1:14:27] on it, if you can just put your foot on
[1:14:29] that devil just a little bit, he's under
[1:14:32] your feet. Amen. And he is yours. And
[1:14:34] you can overcome by the blood of the
[1:14:36] lamb and by the word of your testimony.
[1:14:38] Amen. Prophesy again, John. Amen. It's
[1:14:41] not up to brother Brandham. Amen. You're
[1:14:43] the type of John. Amen. So, prophesy
[1:14:45] again. Take the word and put the word on
[1:14:47] your lips and go forward.
[1:14:52] We was talking about that in the office
[1:14:53] back there a little bit. Speak the word
[1:14:54] and go forward.
[1:14:56] had inspired me.
[1:15:00] What do you have need of? You're the
[1:15:03] queen of heaven.
[1:15:06] You're the queen of heaven.
[1:15:10] Nobody else but you.
[1:15:13] You're the queen of heaven.
[1:15:17] Look here in Esther
[1:15:19] 17.
[1:15:26] We look here. Esther taking her place as
[1:15:29] queen over Vashi. Is that how you say
[1:15:32] that? Or is it Vashi? Vashi. Huh?
[1:15:37] There's so many names in this. Names
[1:15:40] that I don't want to pronounce
[1:15:42] cuz I can't.
[1:15:45] But the Bible says Vashab was beautiful
[1:15:47] to look upon. The king had wanted to
[1:15:51] present Vashi before all to show her
[1:15:54] beauty. He wanted someone. He didn't
[1:15:58] just want to show her beauty, but he
[1:15:59] wanted someone he could present before
[1:16:01] all the world. But Vasha refused to come
[1:16:05] at the king's commandment.
[1:16:07] And doing this, she wronged the king.
[1:16:09] The Bible says, his princes and all the
[1:16:12] people of all all the provinces of of of
[1:16:15] King Ahasheros.
[1:16:17] And Esther 11:17. For this deed of the
[1:16:20] of the queen shall come abroad, they
[1:16:21] said, unto all women, so that they shall
[1:16:24] despise her husbands in their eyes. And
[1:16:26] when it shall be reported, the king of
[1:16:28] Hashos commanded Vashie the queen to be
[1:16:31] brought in before him, but she came not.
[1:16:34] They said, "This going to cause some
[1:16:36] problems here. She didn't listen.
[1:16:41] She didn't do what she was told." Now,
[1:16:46] amen. Now,
[1:16:48] I don't know how I find myself in these
[1:16:50] spots, but I do.
[1:16:53] You do it. I do it to myself.
[1:17:01] So, there went a decree that Vashi could
[1:17:03] not come before the king again
[1:17:06] and that the king give her royal estate
[1:17:08] to one who is better than she. And so, a
[1:17:11] true king, he needs a queen that's going
[1:17:14] to stand by him, right? and a a queen
[1:17:17] that will obey his commands and wishes
[1:17:20] to represent his power to represent his
[1:17:23] kingdom. Right.
[1:17:26] And the Bible says that obedience is
[1:17:27] better than sacrifice. That's right. And
[1:17:30] that's what tonight that's what the what
[1:17:32] the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords
[1:17:34] wants. Amen. He want that's what he
[1:17:36] wants from his bride. One that is as
[1:17:38] faithful to his word as he is.
[1:17:42] one that will honor his word as he does.
[1:17:46] Does God Is God faithful?
[1:17:48] Can we testify of that? That God is
[1:17:50] faithful to his word. That God honors
[1:17:52] his word. And that's what God expects
[1:17:54] from his queen. That's what he expects
[1:17:56] from his wife. Amen. One that will honor
[1:17:59] that will honor his presence as he is in
[1:18:02] their midst. Not somebody that'll just
[1:18:04] sit around and ignore him. Not somebody
[1:18:06] that won't come and and give him some
[1:18:08] attention. not somebody that won't wash
[1:18:10] his feet and and really take care of him
[1:18:12] and give him the attention that he
[1:18:14] deserves. Amen. But he wants a queen.
[1:18:15] Amen. That will honor him as he honors
[1:18:18] her. Amen. He wants a queen that will
[1:18:20] honor his presence when he comes into
[1:18:22] the room. And that's what he wants from
[1:18:24] you and I. I'm not trying to work you
[1:18:26] up.
[1:18:29] He wants He wants He wants all your
[1:18:31] attention. He wants all the glory, all
[1:18:33] everything that you can give him when
[1:18:34] you come into this place. Amen. Amen.
[1:18:36] This is a house of God. This is a house
[1:18:38] of praise. It's a house of prayer. Amen.
[1:18:40] Amen. Where we can come and and get
[1:18:42] right with God. Where we can get close
[1:18:44] to him. Amen. Not just sit on a pew, but
[1:18:46] make ourselves ready. Amen. To represent
[1:18:50] the kingdom, to represent his power.
[1:18:52] When we go out with our associates, it's
[1:18:54] easy in here. Amen. But when you go out
[1:18:56] and you rub shoulders with the world,
[1:18:58] that's when it becomes hard. Amen. Amen.
[1:19:00] But we're here to draw strength. Amen.
[1:19:02] We're here to learn from him. We're here
[1:19:04] to for his word to be revealed to us.
[1:19:05] Amen. that we can know how how to go out
[1:19:08] and act in this kingdom. Amen. To
[1:19:10] represent his kingdom,
[1:19:12] this dying age. Amen.
[1:19:15] Thank you, Lord. The Bible says where
[1:19:19] the word of a king is, there is power.
[1:19:22] When a king says something, Amen. Amen.
[1:19:25] Who's going to say anything against it?
[1:19:27] Amen. When the word, Amen. When when the
[1:19:29] queen has the word of the king, Amen.
[1:19:31] Amen. Who can say anything against it?
[1:19:33] It's just as though the king said it.
[1:19:35] Amen. And your name is just as good on
[1:19:38] the checkbook as his is. Amen. Amen.
[1:19:40] You've taken on the name of the King of
[1:19:42] Kings and the Lord of Lords.
[1:19:51] Thank you, Lord. Esther 2:8.
[1:19:56] So it came to pass when the king's
[1:19:57] commandment and his decree was heard.
[1:20:00] And when many maidens were gathered
[1:20:01] together into Shushon, the the palace to
[1:20:04] the custody of Heg that Esther was
[1:20:06] brought also under the king's house to
[1:20:09] the custoer of women. And the maiden
[1:20:13] pleased him, and she obtained kindness
[1:20:15] of him. And he speedily gave her things
[1:20:18] for purification, with such things as
[1:20:20] belonged to her, and seven maidens,
[1:20:23] which were meat to be given her out of
[1:20:25] the king's house. And he preferred her
[1:20:28] and her maze under the best place of the
[1:20:30] house of the women. And Esther had not
[1:20:33] showed her people, nor her kindred, for
[1:20:35] Mori had charged her that she should not
[1:20:38] show it. Mori
[1:20:41] was her was her uncle. Her mother and
[1:20:45] father were dead. Mori took Esther to
[1:20:49] raise her in the right way. Esther
[1:20:52] 21:15. Skip on down.
[1:20:55] Now when the turn of Esther the daughter
[1:20:57] of A E A E A E A E A E A E A E A E A E A
[1:20:57] E the uncle of Mori
[1:21:00] who had taken her for his daughter was
[1:21:03] cut was to go in unto the king. She
[1:21:05] required nothing. Listen to this. She
[1:21:07] required nothing but what Hagi the
[1:21:09] king's chamberlain the keeper of the
[1:21:11] women appointed. And Esther obtained
[1:21:14] favor in the sight of all them that
[1:21:17] looked upon her. So she only needed what
[1:21:20] had been provided. She didn't need
[1:21:23] anything extra. She didn't want any
[1:21:25] anything extra to doll herself up. She
[1:21:27] want she needed only what had been
[1:21:29] provided to her. Come on.
[1:21:33] He goes on to say verse 16. So Esther
[1:21:35] was taken to the king of Hashos under
[1:21:37] his royal house in the 10th month which
[1:21:39] is the month of Tibet in the seventh
[1:21:41] year of his reign. And the king loved
[1:21:43] Esther above all the women. And she
[1:21:46] obtained grace and favor in his sight
[1:21:48] more than all the virgins. So that he
[1:21:50] set the royal crown upon her head and
[1:21:53] made her a queen instead of Vesta. Thank
[1:21:56] you, Lord. So it's because of the spirit
[1:21:59] Esther had that she gained favor
[1:22:02] wherever she went.
[1:22:05] She gained favor with the king's
[1:22:07] chamberlain and she was willing to take
[1:22:10] that which was appointed because she
[1:22:13] knew the chamberlain represented what
[1:22:17] the king wanted. Yeah, that's good. She
[1:22:20] didn't need anything other than what had
[1:22:23] been provided and appointed. Amen. And
[1:22:26] only those Amen. only those who are true
[1:22:28] elect will be able to honor the full
[1:22:30] word of the king. It was not in Vasti to
[1:22:34] honor his word. It was not in her to be
[1:22:37] a true queen. But in Esther, in the
[1:22:39] elect is a different spirit, is a
[1:22:41] different seed. And that's what brings
[1:22:44] the eternal blessing. That's that's why
[1:22:46] you can take the instructions of the
[1:22:47] word and the others can't. That's why we
[1:22:50] can take the instructions of the word.
[1:22:52] And I believe by God's grace we can. I
[1:22:54] believe by God's grace I can. Amen. But
[1:22:57] that's what sets us apart from the
[1:22:59] denomination. Amen. because from within
[1:23:01] them is not a seed to be able to honor
[1:23:04] his word as is within you.
[1:23:08] I don't know what greater thing you
[1:23:10] could say to the queen of heaven than
[1:23:12] that.
[1:23:15] What understanding that is and nobody
[1:23:18] understands that.
[1:23:20] But only the true elect can represent
[1:23:23] and honor the full word.
[1:23:26] That's why you can stand. I'm preaching
[1:23:28] to you tonight. That's why you can stand
[1:23:30] on the promise. It is your allotted
[1:23:32] portion that he gave to you. You were
[1:23:35] predestinated. It was a predestinated
[1:23:37] word and you were predestinated to it.
[1:23:40] Right?
[1:23:41] The world rejects what you gave. But the
[1:23:44] bride is standing on thus sayeth the
[1:23:46] Lord. Amen. She receives the word of the
[1:23:48] king. She receives the word of the king.
[1:23:51] Where the word word of a king there is
[1:23:53] power. Amen. Amen. And she received by
[1:23:56] doing this, she received Esther the
[1:23:58] admiration of the king and his true
[1:24:00] servants. Amen. She was willing, amen,
[1:24:02] to lay aside the favor of the world. She
[1:24:05] was willing to lay aside, Amen, the
[1:24:07] garments of the world and whatever they
[1:24:09] had to offer. Amen. And take the
[1:24:10] garments that was pleasing to the king.
[1:24:16] Brother Bill says in marriage of lamb,
[1:24:18] I'll try to hurry here. I hear some kid
[1:24:20] crying back there. They're probably
[1:24:22] tired of hearing me scream.
[1:24:27] He said, "When the church begins to
[1:24:28] share the her fellowship with the world,
[1:24:29] God is a jealous God." He put Israel
[1:24:33] away because of that. And his son will
[1:24:35] put the same thing away. But he's going
[1:24:37] to have a bride that hasn't got a
[1:24:38] wrinkle in her. She's wholly washed by
[1:24:41] the blood of his own self. That's right.
[1:24:43] So, see where we stand? The wedding is
[1:24:46] getting ready to come. The world the
[1:24:49] world's making ready for battle, but
[1:24:52] you're making ready for a wedding.
[1:24:53] You're making ready for a wedding
[1:24:55] supper. Amen. Amen. We're being united
[1:24:57] with the word here. Amen. We're making
[1:25:00] ready for that.
[1:25:03] Amen.
[1:25:05] So, we look at Esther here again. I just
[1:25:06] I just love this character. She refused
[1:25:09] anything else but what the king wanted.
[1:25:11] She refused the attitude of a wouldbe
[1:25:14] queen. Oh, come on. She refused to take
[1:25:17] on that kind of attitude towards the
[1:25:19] desires and the voice of the king. She
[1:25:22] refused to take a wrong idea about the
[1:25:25] word and she refused to mix her own idea
[1:25:29] about the word.
[1:25:32] Just give me what the king requires.
[1:25:34] Yes, sir. Let me dress myself.
[1:25:38] Oh, come on. That was her desire.
[1:25:41] Give me these garments. Brother Brown
[1:25:44] goes on. Marriage of the lamb. I'll try
[1:25:45] to hurry. I'm sorry. A lot of
[1:25:47] Pentecostal women wearing clothes that
[1:25:49] pertain to a man. And God said it's an
[1:25:52] abomination in sight. That's right. How
[1:25:54] you expect to go to heaven like that? It
[1:25:56] shows that the Holy Spirit isn't there.
[1:25:57] If the Holy Spirit wasn't there, it
[1:25:59] would condemn you. He said, "You might
[1:26:02] shout, speak with tongues, run up and
[1:26:03] down, dance in spirit." He said, "I've
[1:26:05] seen Hindus and different religions do
[1:26:07] that. That don't mean nothing unless
[1:26:08] there's a lie to back up what you're
[1:26:10] talking about. A power of the Holy Ghost
[1:26:12] to make godly living people. That's the
[1:26:14] bride of Christ. And Esther was to
[1:26:17] become a bride. So she didn't want none
[1:26:18] of the adorning of the world. She wanted
[1:26:20] to go into the king just like she was.
[1:26:23] Amen. And she adorned she adorned
[1:26:26] himself like the Pentecostal women ought
[1:26:27] to with a meek humble spirit. He said
[1:26:30] when all these fancy ladies come by with
[1:26:32] her all new fandango things, whatever
[1:26:35] that means. The king looked at at them
[1:26:38] and put them in the chamber. Put them
[1:26:40] out with the concubines. But when this
[1:26:42] Esther come inside, he got a glimpse of
[1:26:44] that sweet, humble, meek spirit. Amen.
[1:26:47] That's the biblical garments. Amen. Of
[1:26:49] the bride. Amen. That's the biblical
[1:26:51] garments. He said, "That's her. Go, go
[1:26:53] get that crown and put it on her head.
[1:26:55] That's it." He said, "Let them adorn
[1:26:57] them spir themselves with that kind of
[1:26:58] spirit." Not only the women, but the men
[1:27:01] adorn themselves with that kind of
[1:27:02] spirit. Then you become ready for the
[1:27:05] bride, sweet and reverent. Thank you,
[1:27:07] Lord. Esther made her heart clean. Yes,
[1:27:10] sir.
[1:27:12] Ask Brother Brandham, "How do you how do
[1:27:14] you make your heart clean, Brother
[1:27:15] Brandham? Washed by the water of the
[1:27:17] word." Oh yeah. Through the blood of
[1:27:19] Jesus Christ. You've got to wear it.
[1:27:22] Thank you, Lord. You've got to wear it.
[1:27:25] You got to put it on. Washed by the
[1:27:28] water of the word. Amen. Oh yeah. Amen.
[1:27:31] I'll try to skip on down here.
[1:27:34] Do y'all believe me or no?
[1:27:39] I got so much
[1:27:41] So much here I'm trying to skip down.
[1:27:47] All right. Read this here again. In
[1:27:49] marriage of the lamb, the hour has come.
[1:27:50] The bride has made herself ready. Made
[1:27:52] herself ready. She's laid aside all
[1:27:53] these things. Remember Esther was chosen
[1:27:56] and all the others was rejected. And
[1:27:58] only those that's born again that's got
[1:28:00] the spirit of God will be chosen that
[1:28:02] day that the crown of glory will be set
[1:28:05] upon her head and the others will be
[1:28:07] rejected. So this bride, listen to this.
[1:28:11] This bride under her king's chamberlain,
[1:28:14] the one appointed, this bride under her
[1:28:17] messenger will become the final voice to
[1:28:20] the final age. God through you, God
[1:28:24] through the bride will have the final
[1:28:25] say when it comes to showdown time.
[1:28:28] Amen. And you're a thundering voice.
[1:28:30] Remember that you're a thundering voice.
[1:28:32] Amen. A voice that's been prepared.
[1:28:34] Amen. Predestinated. Amen. And we were
[1:28:36] coming to a showdown. Amen. Brother
[1:28:38] Random said in the spoken word, his
[1:28:40] original seed is he said it's a showdown
[1:28:42] against denominations and creed. It's a
[1:28:44] Mount Zion showdown. The rapture of his
[1:28:47] bride. Amen. Where she will stand there.
[1:28:49] Amen. She will stand there and reject.
[1:28:51] Amen. She will stand there and reject
[1:28:52] the denominational creeds. Amen. And
[1:28:55] dogmas and different things. And she
[1:28:56] will take that which is rejected. And
[1:28:59] she will clothe herselves in his
[1:29:01] righteousness and his glory. Thank you,
[1:29:04] Lord.
[1:29:06] Amen. You've got a purpose.
[1:29:09] Don't look Don't look at me like that,
[1:29:11] Brother Ben.
[1:29:13] You've got a purpose. All right, I'll
[1:29:15] try to hurry here. You've got a purpose.
[1:29:17] All right, don't let the devil ever tell
[1:29:19] you that you're just here for no reason.
[1:29:22] You've got a purpose. And Esther would
[1:29:25] later find out what her purpose was when
[1:29:28] Hmon would try to destroy the people of
[1:29:30] God. That's right. He would try to
[1:29:32] destroy the people of God. And he didn't
[1:29:35] he didn't he seen these people mingled
[1:29:37] in the kingdoms and dispersed throughout
[1:29:39] the different kingdoms and he and he
[1:29:41] accused them of of being a people that
[1:29:43] didn't obey the laws of the land. And so
[1:29:47] I just thought that that was kind of
[1:29:49] kind of funny. You know you know we are
[1:29:51] to obey the law, right? But not over the
[1:29:54] word of God. That's right. Right. The
[1:29:57] word of God has preceded over the laws
[1:29:59] of man. And that's how we have to live
[1:30:01] our lives. Amen. We have to do what's
[1:30:03] right. We have to we have to do the
[1:30:05] things that are right. No matter no
[1:30:06] matter what the persecution would be, no
[1:30:08] matter what the law would be. Amen.
[1:30:10] Amen. There's got to be got to be a
[1:30:12] people that know their God. Amen. That
[1:30:14] it's got faith and that they that are
[1:30:16] willing to be reverent to the things
[1:30:18] that he has said. And so Esther Esther
[1:30:21] had a purpose later on. Amen. Amen. Mori
[1:30:24] Amen. They they had had they had
[1:30:26] murdered some there of the Jews and and
[1:30:29] Morortei there he had met he had met
[1:30:31] Hmon there in the gate the king's gate
[1:30:34] and there is and and Mori or Hmon didn't
[1:30:37] like it as he would come to Mori and
[1:30:39] Mori would just stand there and not move
[1:30:41] out of his way. He would not give him
[1:30:44] the respect.
[1:30:47] Right.
[1:30:50] And I like that. You know, we've got to
[1:30:52] be firm as as sons and daughters of God.
[1:30:54] That's right. We've got to stand against
[1:30:56] what's wrong. You've got to stand firm.
[1:30:59] Not move to the left or right. Just
[1:31:01] stand there. Right.
[1:31:04] We've got to stand. We've got to take a
[1:31:06] stand for what's right. Amen. And there
[1:31:10] Mori would tell Esther, "Amen. For such
[1:31:13] a time as this." Amen. You were
[1:31:16] appointed for such a time as this this
[1:31:18] occasion. Amen. You have been brought to
[1:31:20] this place to save your people. Amen.
[1:31:23] And I want to say tonight, I'll finish
[1:31:24] this with with this. There's life within
[1:31:26] the bride. There's saving power. Amen.
[1:31:28] Within your prayer, amen. Amen. When we
[1:31:31] take the token, when we take the blood,
[1:31:33] Amen. Amen. Applied over our homes,
[1:31:35] that's a saving power. Amen. For our
[1:31:37] people, Amen. It's a saving power for
[1:31:39] our loved ones. Amen. Amen. They'll have
[1:31:41] to walk over that blood. They'll have to
[1:31:43] walk over those prayers. Amen. Amen. But
[1:31:45] God, Amen. If you if you'll apply that,
[1:31:47] I believe God will honor it. Thank you,
[1:31:49] Lord. Let's
[1:31:52] just stand tonight. I got so much here
[1:31:55] and I'm sorry.
[1:32:08] Amen. Put on the biblical garments.
[1:32:12] Amen. Cast off the adorning of the
[1:32:14] world. Cast those things off. Isaiah 52
[1:32:17] and1 says, "Awake, awake. Put on thy
[1:32:20] strength, oh Zion. Zion, the top of the
[1:32:23] bride.
[1:32:25] Put on thy strength. Put on the Holy
[1:32:28] Ghost.
[1:32:30] That's your strength. That's the only
[1:32:31] way we're going to be able to make it by
[1:32:33] the power of the Holy Ghost.
[1:32:36] Say that's simple.
[1:32:38] That's life. Put on thy strength, oh
[1:32:41] Zion. Put on thy beautiful garments, oh
[1:32:45] Jerusalem, the holy city. For henceforth
[1:32:47] there shall no more come unto thee
[1:32:49] uncircumcised and unclean.
[1:32:53] Shake thyself from the dust.
[1:32:57] Shake yourself from the ashes, from the
[1:33:00] dust of this life,
[1:33:02] and may shake yourself, sit down, oh
[1:33:04] Jerusalem. Loose thyself from thy bands
[1:33:07] of thy neck, oh captive daughter of
[1:33:10] Zion. For thus sayith the Lord, you have
[1:33:12] sold yourselves for not and you shall be
[1:33:15] redeemed without money. Amen. Awake
[1:33:19] yourselves.
[1:33:20] Amen. Have the victory.
[1:33:24] Put on the armor of God.
[1:33:27] Put on the Holy Ghost.
[1:33:30] Put on the beautiful garments, the
[1:33:31] splendor, the righteousness. The Bible
[1:33:34] says here of the garments there as the
[1:33:37] attribute of God
[1:33:40] as something that God gave you, a part
[1:33:44] of God. Put that on as sons and
[1:33:46] daughters of God. Wear
[1:33:49] where that you're a son of God. Wear
[1:33:51] that you're a daughter of God. Put on
[1:33:53] that glory. Take your position. Be an
[1:33:56] overcomer. Shake thyself from the dust.
[1:34:00] Shake yourself. Amen. from this earth.
[1:34:03] Shake yourself from this rubbish. Amen.
[1:34:06] Amen. And be loosened. Amen. Be
[1:34:08] loosened. Amen. It's a time of freedom.
[1:34:10] Amen. It's a time of the opening of the
[1:34:12] word. It's a time of the loosening of
[1:34:14] the seals. Amen. Amen. Not just not just
[1:34:16] something of pages in a book. Amen. But
[1:34:18] a loosening power. Amen. Amen. The power
[1:34:21] of Jesus Christ to set his people free.
[1:34:25] Amen.
[1:34:27] You love the Lord. Amen. Let's just bow
[1:34:28] our hearts and our heads. Amen. And
[1:34:30] Lord, we just love you once again. We
[1:34:32] thank you so much, Lord, for your word.

[1:34:36] it. If we can if we can receive it,
[1:34:39] Lord, if we can accept it and put it on
[1:34:41] our lips, Lord. So, Lord, I just pray
[1:34:43] that you'd give us the faith and the
[1:34:45] courage, Lord, to go forth this week,
[1:34:47] Lord. These people, Lord, give them,
[1:34:49] Lord, their every footstep that they
[1:34:51] they walk upon, Lord, as their
[1:34:53] possession, give it to them, Lord. Lord,

[1:34:57] make ourselves ready, Lord. Lord, we we
[1:35:00] thank you so much for what you provided.
[1:35:02] We just want to testify tonight that
[1:35:04] it's more than enough. The Holy Ghost is
[1:35:07] more than enough to change a heart, a
[1:35:10] life, Lord. It's more than enough. The
[1:35:13] blood is more than enough. What you
[1:35:16] provide is more than enough to bring joy
[1:35:18] in our lives, Lord, to that we could
[1:35:20] give you praise, Lord. We love you so
[1:35:22] much, Lord. Lord, take take our lives,
[1:35:25] Lord. If we've misused your time, if
[1:35:27] we've misused our our time upon this
[1:35:29] earth, Lord, get glory from what's left.
[1:35:32] Get glory from what's left, Lord. We
[1:35:34] pray.
[1:35:36] Lord, help us to be sincere. Help us to
[1:35:38] be true. Help us to honor your word,
[1:35:41] Lord. We pray now. We love you so much.
