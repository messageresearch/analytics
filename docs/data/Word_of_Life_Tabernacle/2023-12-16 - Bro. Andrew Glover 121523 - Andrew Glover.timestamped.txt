[17:14] tonight on this uh Friday evening to
[17:16] have this time to Amen to get together
[17:18] in Fellowship around the word and amen I
[17:20] was just thinking today at un unusual uh
[17:23] time or unexpected time but the prophet
[17:25] of God said you know he preached a
[17:27] message one time on the unchangeable god
[17:30] working in an unexpected way and he said
[17:33] now it may be an unexpected time an
[17:35] unexpected place and he said but God
[17:37] will move there he said but how much
[17:39] more will he move for those who's
[17:40] expected him so you know I know it may
[17:42] be unexpected on a Friday night to be in
[17:44] church but here we are and amen I
[17:47] believe the Lord has something for us
[17:48] tonight and amen we want to say God
[17:50] bless you all sure good to see everyone
[17:52] out that could make it tonight and amen
[17:54] sure appreciate brother ver and sister
[17:55] Dee for coming up amen they their family
[17:58] to us so we sure appreciate them for
[17:59] making the effort to come and the
[18:01] different vistors the Shamel God bless
[18:02] you all and I'm going to leave somebody
[18:04] out sure's the world brother uh Daniel
[18:06] my buddy from North Carolina come all
[18:08] the way to Arkansas just to see me so no
[18:11] I'm just kidding but sure good to have
[18:13] him here tonight we sure appreciate
[18:14] brother Daniel and his family and amen
[18:17] if you have your Bibles tonight we want
[18:18] to go to the book of Acts the 20th
[18:20] chapter the book of Acts the 20th
[18:23] chapter and um amen we sure appreciate
[18:26] brother Ben in the church here and the
[18:28] he was tell me the other day he said uh
[18:29] we hadn't heard you speak to us since
[18:31] the meeting so it's good to get to swing
[18:33] by and see you all once again and amen I
[18:35] believe the Lord's doing some wonderful
[18:37] things in the age we're living amen amen
[18:39] the book of Acts the 20th chapter and
[18:42] the 25th verse uh Paul here writing he
[18:46] says and now behold I know that ye all
[18:48] among whom I've gone preaching the
[18:51] kingdom of God shall see my face no more
[18:56] wherefore I take you to record this day
[18:58] that I I am pure from the blood of all
[18:59] men for I have not shunned to declare
[19:03] unto you all the counsel of God now I
[19:06] love this because it's Paul's farewell
[19:08] words if we could say it that way and
[19:10] he's addressing the church and in the
[19:12] 20th verse he said take heed therefore
[19:14] unto yourselves and to all the flock
[19:16] over the which the Holy Ghost hath made
[19:18] you overseers to feed the Church of God
[19:22] which he hath purchased with his own
[19:25] blood for I know this that after my
[19:28] departing shall Grievious wolves enter
[19:30] in among you not sparing the flock watch
[19:34] verse 30 and also of your own selves
[19:37] shall men arise so he's actually going
[19:39] to break it down more clear and show us
[19:42] that they're not coming from the outside
[19:44] but they're going to arise from the
[19:46] inside speaking perverse things now
[19:49] here's why they're doing this to draw
[19:51] away disciples after them now therefore
[19:54] watch and remember that by the space of
[19:56] three years I have not seen cease to
[19:58] warn I cease not rather to warn everyone
[20:01] night and day with tears and now
[20:04] Brethren I commend you to God and to the
[20:06] word of his grace now watch this which
[20:08] is able to build you up not tear you
[20:11] down but Build You Up and to give you an
[20:15] inheritance among all them which are
[20:18] Sanctified amen we ask the Lord this
[20:20] evening to add the blessing to the
[20:21] reading of his word as you can have your
[20:23] seats here this afternoon I want to by
[20:25] the help of the Lord for just a few
[20:27] moments tonight to just share a few
[20:29] things with you and if I would uh title
[20:31] this tonight I want to speak to you for
[20:32] just a few moments here Amen on
[20:34] declaring the message with Liberty amen
[20:37] declaring the message with Liberty you
[20:39] know I've been in a bit of a a series of
[20:42] thoughts and study on this scripture
[20:43] here in the book of Acts the 20th
[20:46] chapter and also looking a lot at the
[20:48] the prophet of God's teaching Amen on
[20:50] the term in the middle of the road and
[20:52] you know Isaiah 35 actually gives us a
[20:55] very beautiful scripture he says that
[20:57] there would be a Highway and then he
[20:59] said there would be a way so there would
[21:00] be a highway and it there would be a way
[21:03] and it would be called the way of
[21:04] Holiness now in Matthew 7 and verse 14
[21:08] and 15 you will find that there's
[21:10] actually two ways so there's the there's
[21:12] the Broadway and that way leadth under
[21:14] destruction amen but then there is the
[21:16] narrow way and that is the path that
[21:18] leadth unto life amen and I I find it
[21:21] very amazing that we're living in a time
[21:23] where it seems to be such a uh such a
[21:25] confusion or such an age where people
[21:27] are always saying well you know we've
[21:29] got to find the middle of the road or we
[21:31] got to find the balance and you know I I
[21:33] actually believe that I believe that it
[21:34] is essential amen as Believers to find
[21:37] the balance in all things I don't
[21:39] believe it's just essential Amen to find
[21:41] it in one area of the message but I
[21:43] believe it's essential to find it in all
[21:44] areas of our life amen because I believe
[21:47] that the message of the hour came to an
[21:49] unbalanced church amen to put them into
[21:52] a scriptural balance now you remember
[21:54] per brother Perry green says it many
[21:56] times said brother Bram told him brother
[21:57] Perry you always keep your balance where
[22:00] in the scripture see because he was not
[22:03] bringing something apart from the word
[22:05] but rather he was bringing something in
[22:07] the word to the church to make the word
[22:09] bride now when you look at Webster's
[22:11] definition of balance he said it is a
[22:13] condition in which different elements
[22:15] are equal amen or in the correct
[22:17] proportions it is the stability of one's
[22:20] mind amen or feelings to keep or put
[22:22] something Amen in a steady position so
[22:25] that it does not fall so amen a balance
[22:28] is coming to put the church into a
[22:30] steady position amen so that it does not
[22:33] fall now when you start looking at
[22:34] balance brother Bram will actually take
[22:36] it to the prescription and he says now
[22:38] if you go to the doctor and the doctor
[22:40] writes your prescription he said you
[22:41] take it down to a druggist he said what
[22:43] the druggist is going to do is he's
[22:45] going to mix the prescription right he
[22:47] said he's going to put enough antidote
[22:48] in there he said to to kill the germ or
[22:51] to balance the poison he said then he's
[22:52] going to put enough poison there there
[22:54] Amen to balance out the antidote he said
[22:56] now see amen if you put too much
[22:58] antidote then the Poison's not going to
[23:00] work and if you put too much poison then
[23:02] the antidote is not going to work he
[23:04] said so if you take it to a quack
[23:06] druggist you're automatically amen going
[23:08] to be out of balance he said but then we
[23:10] turn it to the church and he said God
[23:12] has given the church an original and
[23:14] eternal prescription amen and that is
[23:17] the book of Acts the 2 chapter where he
[23:19] said repent and be baptized every one of
[23:21] you and he said now if you take that to
[23:23] a quack Seminary he said they're going
[23:25] to mess it up and they're going to add
[23:27] and they're going to take away from it
[23:29] amen but if you take it to the one who
[23:30] wrote it amen then he's going to
[23:32] administer it to you the way that he
[23:34] wrote it and you know amen I as I said
[23:36] already I believe that God has sent us
[23:38] in this age amen a balanced message we
[23:41] do not have to balance this message amen
[23:43] I believe it's already balanced because
[23:45] when a Prophet come on the scene amen he
[23:48] announced that his ministry was coming
[23:49] to two classes of people right he said
[23:52] one was the fundamental he said and the
[23:54] other was the Pentecostal now if you
[23:56] start studying that you'll see that he
[23:58] called the fundamentals a little cold
[23:59] and a little starchy amen then he said
[24:02] the Pentecostal are so fanatic amen you
[24:04] can't teach them nothing he said but see
[24:06] if you could ever bring the two together
[24:08] he said then you would have the most
[24:10] powerful church amen that you've ever
[24:12] had now I'll just say it like this amen
[24:14] the way that they were looked at amen
[24:16] was the fundamentals was looked at as
[24:18] the high class right amen they were the
[24:20] ones that if they wanted to bring the
[24:21] mayor to the church didn't have to worry
[24:23] about somebody breaking out in tongues
[24:25] or shouting or dancing amen then you go
[24:27] theend Pentecostals and they were known
[24:29] as the ones on the other side of the
[24:30] track and they were the Fanatics and the
[24:32] poor people so they were considered the
[24:34] low class amen but what I love about
[24:36] this is God sent a prophet to the church
[24:39] amen and he said what I'm doing is
[24:41] pulling from both sides amen so he was
[24:43] pulling from the high class as well as
[24:45] the low class amen and he was making one
[24:48] class and that was the middle class amen
[24:51] which would be the Bride of Jesus Christ
[24:53] I believe tonight amen that we are not
[24:55] amen out of balance with this message I
[24:57] believe that we are in the balance amen
[24:59] that a prophet has established in the
[25:01] age we're living now he said that
[25:03] brother BR said it very beautiful he
[25:05] said what he done there was that way of
[25:07] Holiness he called it the middle of the
[25:08] road right and he said what will happen
[25:11] amen is you will build a road now when
[25:13] you build a road brother said the
[25:15] highest part is in the center he said
[25:17] now why they build it that way is
[25:18] because it lets all the trash amen be
[25:21] washed off for the middle of the road
[25:23] now I know I love this because it's very
[25:25] beautiful something that I found amen is
[25:27] when you build the road the highest part
[25:29] is in the center and Brother David what
[25:31] that does is that that puts everybody
[25:33] out of a job amen of being on trash
[25:36] control in the middle of the road so
[25:37] what they do is they want to be the ones
[25:39] to determine well this is trash and this
[25:41] is trash amen but the beautiful thing
[25:43] about it is God ordained for the rain to
[25:45] fall amen and when the rain comes the
[25:47] rain will wash all the trash amen out of
[25:50] the middle of the road see amen and the
[25:52] prophet said because the true message
[25:55] amen is laying in the center of the road
[25:57] amen he said the angel of the Lord is in
[25:59] the center of the Rob now this is where
[26:01] I want to preach to you for a little bit
[26:03] he said and as I the prophet amen I'm
[26:06] saying it that way he said I always
[26:08] preach the middle of the Roe so there
[26:10] was never one time that a prophet amen
[26:12] was preaching from a ditch amen but he
[26:14] was preaching in the middle of the road
[26:16] because he was pulling amen from both
[26:19] sides to produce an invincible Army now
[26:21] you know that we have been born again
[26:23] right amen we we believe in the new
[26:25] birth and the prophet said amen that
[26:27] when somebody gets born again he said
[26:29] they are set right in the middle of the
[26:31] road amen so Church your new birth did
[26:34] not put you in a ditch amen when you got
[26:36] born again you were automatically
[26:38] positionally placed Amen in the middle
[26:41] of the road with your eyes on Christ he
[26:43] said but finally they get over here and
[26:45] get so much knowledge and wisdom till
[26:47] they all they know and you don't know
[26:48] nothing see and if you don't do that
[26:50] then you run off on the other side with
[26:52] a bunch of wildfire and fanaticism amen
[26:54] but right in the middle of the road amen
[26:57] there is a true sound unadulterated
[26:59] gospel amen and power of God right down
[27:02] through there amen taking the Kings and
[27:04] the monarchs where anybody can stand and
[27:07] they can search and they can see that
[27:08] it's the power of almighty God Amen it's
[27:11] not a fanaticism amen and neither is it
[27:14] a formality it is the power amen of God
[27:17] we are not following
[27:20] fanaticism we're not following formality
[27:23] amen We are following the power of God
[27:25] another place he said friends I've
[27:27] always tried to keep a balance of the
[27:29] road he said you get way off on
[27:31] formalism just as formal as your
[27:32] ritualistic as can be he said and people
[27:35] grab for that but then if you don't
[27:36] watch you'll get pum over on the other
[27:38] side and be just as fanatic as you can
[27:40] be amen but there is a middle of the
[27:42] road amen where the true sound San
[27:45] gospel is preached amen and God moves in
[27:48] there vindicating the truth straight is
[27:50] the gate and narrow is the way amen and
[27:53] few there will be that'll find it amen
[27:55] you know what I love about this is man
[27:57] does not have to vindicate it's the
[27:59] truth amen but God moves into the church
[28:02] amen and God by his Sovereign power amen
[28:05] will vindicate what is happening is
[28:07] either of him amen or it's not he said
[28:10] the main thing is right in the middle of
[28:11] the road with enough Spirit In You Amen
[28:14] to keep you warm and moving amen amen
[28:16] and knowing enough to keep yourself
[28:18] under obedience to the spirit to move
[28:20] just as the spirit moves amen not till
[28:23] or not after amen but just as the spirit
[28:27] moves amen I believe it tonight friends
[28:29] I believe that every one of us amen have
[28:31] been called to be a part amen of the
[28:34] kingdom of almighty God do you agree
[28:36] with me we've been called to be a part
[28:39] of the kingdom of God now I'll say it
[28:41] like this many times we get in our minds
[28:43] amen I got to have something you know I
[28:45] got to find something I got to be
[28:47] something I I got to do something to
[28:48] really be amen what God called me to be
[28:51] but I find it amazing amen that the only
[28:53] thing that we really need Amen to be
[28:56] what God has called us to to be is
[28:58] Liberty amen that's the only thing we
[29:00] really need amen is Liberty now you all
[29:03] know Paul says Amen in 2 Corinthians
[29:05] 3:17 he said now the Lord is that spirit
[29:09] and where the spirit of the Lord is not
[29:11] where the spirit of the Lord was or
[29:13] where the spirit of the Lord will be
[29:15] amen but where the spirit of the Lord is
[29:17] there is liberty and when you look at
[29:20] that word Liberty it is the license Amen
[29:22] to do as one pleases amen true Liberty
[29:25] is living as we ought to
[29:27] amen and not as we please amen Liberty
[29:30] to do or to Omit things that have no
[29:33] relationship to Salvation amen I believe
[29:36] that God sent the message of the hour
[29:38] amen and the message of the hour has
[29:40] omitted amen things that had nothing to
[29:43] do amen with the salvation of your soul
[29:46] or a true relationship between you and
[29:48] God can I just put it in in country boy
[29:50] terms in other words the message of the
[29:53] hour has omitted all the nonsense amen
[29:55] there's no com and put your name on the
[29:57] road there's no come and join this or
[29:59] memorize this or follow this amen but
[30:02] this message has brought a liberty of
[30:04] the grace of God and to the church amen
[30:07] to manifest the nature of Jesus Christ I
[30:09] love what the prophet said he said not
[30:11] for one moment do I bring a message to
[30:13] the people that they may follow me or
[30:15] join my church or start some fellowship
[30:18] an organization I have never done that
[30:21] and will not do that now I have no
[30:23] interest in those things but I do have
[30:25] an interest in the things of God and
[30:27] people and if I can accomplish just one
[30:30] thing I will be satisfied brother
[30:32] Brandon what is that one thing amen that
[30:34] one thing is to see established a true
[30:37] spiritual relationship between God and
[30:40] Men wherein men become New Creations in
[30:42] Christ and they are filled with his
[30:45] spirit amen now let's not stop there
[30:47] let's read the rest of it and they live
[30:49] according to his word amen so the
[30:51] message he was bringing amen was not
[30:54] just a baptism of the Holy Ghost amen
[30:56] but it was was the adoption of the
[30:58] church it was the positionally plac of
[31:01] the sons where we would not just be
[31:03] baptized with the Holy Ghost but we
[31:05] would get up from the baptism and we
[31:07] would live according to the word now we
[31:10] got to identify this source of Liberty
[31:12] right amen the source of Liberty comes
[31:16] from the spirit I'll say it like this
[31:18] that's why you cannot take our Liberty
[31:20] and that's why you cannot give us
[31:22] Liberty amen because you're not the
[31:24] source of Liberty amen a church is not
[31:26] the source of Liberty a preacher is not
[31:29] the source of Liberty amen the message
[31:32] of the hour is our Liberty I said as
[31:35] plain as I know how the message of the
[31:37] hour is our license amen y'all know what
[31:40] you need to drive you need a driver's
[31:42] license I know people get in their mind
[31:43] well if I just got keys I'll be okay
[31:46] amen but go tell the police officer that
[31:47] when he pulls you over amen if you don't
[31:50] have a license you're headed for the
[31:51] jail house amen and listen friends we've
[31:53] had a lot of people amen trying to live
[31:56] without a license
[31:57] amen they've tried to live on this man's
[31:59] idea and this experience amen but why
[32:01] don't you come tonight and take the word
[32:04] test amen and when you pass the word
[32:06] test he will give you the license Amen
[32:09] to be what he called you to be and he
[32:11] didn't call you to be something great
[32:12] for leot see he called you to be the
[32:15] Bride of Jesus Christ I love first John
[32:18] 1:1 he says that which was from the
[32:20] beginning which we have heard which we
[32:22] have seen with our eyes which we have
[32:23] looked upon and our hands have handled
[32:25] of the word of life he said for the life
[32:28] was manifested and we have seen it and
[32:30] we bear witness and show unto you that
[32:33] eternal life which was with the father
[32:35] and was manifested unto us now listen at
[32:38] verse three he says that which we have
[32:40] seen and heard amen declare we unto you
[32:43] somebody say
[32:44] seen heard declare what we've seen and
[32:49] heard declare we unto you that you also
[32:52] may have fellowship with us and truly
[32:54] our fellowship is with the father and
[32:57] with his son Jesus Christ now look at
[32:59] this word seen it means to see with the
[33:01] eyes it means to see with the mind it
[33:03] means to perceive amen the word gives
[33:06] prominence to the Discerning mind so
[33:08] when one see something brother brother
[33:11] Danny they are perceiving it with her
[33:12] mind but then John said we didn't just
[33:15] see the life amen but we heard the life
[33:18] and that word heard means not to be
[33:19] death it means to consider what is or
[33:22] has been said it means to understand or
[33:25] to perceive the sense of what is said I
[33:27] love this one to perceive by the ear
[33:30] what is announced in one's presence amen
[33:32] so when something is announced in your
[33:34] presence he said there will be an ear to
[33:37] hear the announcement of what's
[33:39] happening in your midst and then he said
[33:41] to give ear to a teaching or a teacher
[33:43] so John said we've seen it brother Ben
[33:46] we've heard it but then he says amen we
[33:48] got to declare it so it's not just
[33:50] enough to see it it's not just enough to
[33:52] hear it amen but somebody's going to
[33:55] declare it and that word declar means to
[33:57] bring Tidings Amen to bring a word to
[33:59] bring a report to Proclaim to make known
[34:02] openly Amen to declare listen he said
[34:06] these things right we unto you that your
[34:08] joy may be full yes now amen this is is
[34:12] it okay to have church and then then in
[34:14] the fifth verse he says it very
[34:16] beautiful he says this then is the
[34:18] message I love that brother Dell this
[34:20] then is the message which we have heard
[34:23] of him and declare unto you that God is
[34:26] like and in him is no Darkness at all so
[34:29] the message that we're hearing is not a
[34:32] message of Darkness it's not a message
[34:35] of confusion it's not a message of
[34:37] tradition but the message that we are
[34:39] hearing is a declaration of the life of
[34:42] God that was in God in the beginning has
[34:45] now been manifested in the bride and she
[34:48] is not a daughter of Darkness she is a
[34:50] daughter of light amen I love that word
[34:53] message it means announcement it means a
[34:55] promise or the act of promising it is a
[34:58] promise given or to be given it is a
[35:00] promise good or blessing so when we read
[35:03] that word message we could very easily
[35:05] say this is the announcement amen this
[35:08] is the blessing this is the promise amen
[35:11] this is the act that God has bless this
[35:13] generation with listen friends he said
[35:15] father what we need tonight is Mercy he
[35:18] said for Liberty of spirit that we might
[35:20] be able to bring to the people amen the
[35:23] gospel truth of what we believe to be
[35:26] the meage message of the hour for your
[35:28] church brother Brandon was not asking
[35:30] for membership he was not asking for
[35:32] money he was not asking for popularity
[35:35] he said the only thing I need Amen to
[35:37] deliver this message is some Liberty
[35:40] Amen to tell you what the message is to
[35:42] tell you who God is to tell you what
[35:44] you've been called to do amen I believe
[35:47] it church I believe we have seen the
[35:48] message I believe we have heard the
[35:50] message amen but I believe th more than
[35:52] ever it's time to declare the message
[35:55] amen I believe it I believe what I
[35:56] Isaiah said he said Isaiah 48:6 he said
[35:59] thou H has heard and see all this and
[36:01] will not ye declare it I have showed
[36:04] thee new things from this time listen at
[36:06] these words even hidden things and thou
[36:09] didst not know them so we're not looking
[36:12] at things amen that have been laying in
[36:14] plain sight for years amen we've been
[36:16] looking at things that have been hidden
[36:18] amen but now they've been uncovered in
[36:20] Deuteronomy 29:29 I love what the Bible
[36:24] says the Bible says the secret things
[36:26] amen belong unto the Lord Our God Amen
[36:29] but the things which are
[36:32] revealed the secret things amen they
[36:35] belong unto the Lord Our God but those
[36:38] things which are revealed they belong
[36:41] unto us and to our children amen that we
[36:43] may do all the words of this law in
[36:46] other words things that have been sealed
[36:49] in this generation would be unsealed
[36:51] things that had been hidden in this
[36:53] generation would be unveiled they would
[36:55] be revealed and they would not be put in
[36:57] plain view Amen to argue about or to
[37:00] debate about amen but they would be put
[37:02] in plain view because they are your
[37:05] possession listen friends if it's still
[37:08] a secret it belongs to the Lord but if
[37:11] it's been revealed Brother David it
[37:13] belongs to his children and I happen to
[37:15] be one of them tongue talking acts 238
[37:18] young that the word has produced in this
[37:21] generation and everything that is a part
[37:23] of my inheritance I refuse to back up I
[37:27] refuse to lay down I refuse to let some
[37:29] devil amen pack my inheritance out into
[37:32] a field somewhere I'm going to stand on
[37:34] this message and declare I have been
[37:36] given an inheritance among them which
[37:39] are Sanctified and the way I got this
[37:41] inheritance was the life that was in God
[37:44] was the same life he poured into Jesus
[37:47] and the same life he poured into Jesus
[37:49] he is poured into this bride and we are
[37:51] here living manifested life my things
[37:56] don't belong to the world they belong to
[37:58] us now the prophet said it very
[38:00] beautiful he said the Book of Revelation
[38:02] has more symbols in it than all the rest
[38:04] of the books in the Bible it has more
[38:06] symbols because it is a book of Prophecy
[38:09] amen now we're moving somewhere amen
[38:11] it's a prophetic book therefore it has
[38:15] to be understood by a prophetic class so
[38:19] it will not be understood by the high
[38:21] class fundamentals and it'll not be
[38:23] interpreted by the low class
[38:25] Pentecostals amen but there will be a
[38:27] middle class that'll be pulled from the
[38:29] high class they'll be pulled from the
[38:31] low class and they will be positionally
[38:33] placed in the middle of the road under
[38:36] the angel of the Lord and the tutorship
[38:38] of the Holy Ghost and the things which
[38:40] the father has revealed he will give
[38:43] unto the children and they will live by
[38:45] those things they will feed upon those
[38:47] things they will Feast upon them listen
[38:49] friends without this message we're
[38:51] starving without this message we might
[38:53] as well be at a ball game tonight amen
[38:56] but thank God he sent a message and he
[38:58] put us in a position where we would not
[39:00] be under a fanaticism we would not be
[39:03] bound under formality but we would be in
[39:05] a feast well glory to God I love what
[39:08] the prophet said he said some people
[39:10] make the gospel a Frolic he said then
[39:13] some people make it a funeral procession
[39:15] he said but it's not a Frolic he said
[39:17] and neither is it a funeral procession
[39:19] he said it's a feast and we used to sing
[39:21] a song Amen come on over here where the
[39:24] table is spread and the Feast of the
[39:27] Lord is going on listen church amen
[39:30] you're not going to a funeral you're not
[39:32] going to a Frolic you're going to a
[39:34] seven course meal where everything that
[39:37] God has revealed is to be revealed and
[39:39] it's on the table for you to
[39:42] eat it's not a Frolic it's not a funeral
[39:46] procession the gospel is a feast see and
[39:49] you are the prophetic class so this book
[39:52] is not meant for everybody there's
[39:54] nobody can understand it hardly
[39:56] now listen this book is made for a
[39:59] certain class of people he refers to
[40:01] Deuteronomy and he says the carnal mind
[40:03] cannot comprehend them great things of
[40:06] the scripture because it's foolish to
[40:09] them but to the ones who are lovers of
[40:11] the word of God how many lovers of the
[40:12] word of God but to the ones who are the
[40:15] lovers of the word of God that's who the
[40:17] book was written to to the church see
[40:20] the revelation of Jesus Christ to the
[40:23] church at Ephesus to the Church of samna
[40:25] to the church here see the revelation of
[40:28] Jesus Christ to the church can we say
[40:31] this together revealed
[40:33] things belong to
[40:35] us amen the revealed things belong to us
[40:39] I love this sermon 1962 from that time
[40:42] you all heard me preach this quote many
[40:43] times but I don't want to pull a word
[40:45] out of it brother B said my Ministry is
[40:47] different from a pastor or a teacher he
[40:49] says I'm not and if I say things wrong
[40:51] Brethren forgive me I don't mean to amen
[40:54] but this is my Ministry see it's to
[40:56] declare him that he's here so the
[40:59] prophet's Ministry was to declare him
[41:02] Jesus Christ not that he was coming or
[41:04] he's been here but to declare that he is
[41:07] here he comes an anointed ones at the
[41:09] end time paragraph 262 and says notice
[41:11] the very day when this messenger not
[41:13] when he starts on but when he begins to
[41:16] declare his message amen 1962 his
[41:19] message is to declare him he's here 1965
[41:23] when he begins to declare his message
[41:25] see the first pull is healing the second
[41:27] pull is prophesying amen but the third
[41:30] pull is the opening of the word amen the
[41:33] mysteres revealed there's no more higher
[41:36] order to reveal the word than prophets
[41:39] but the only way the prophet can be
[41:40] Vindicated is by the word and remember
[41:44] somebody say remember the third pull was
[41:46] the opening of them Seven Seals Amen to
[41:49] reveal the hidden truth that had been
[41:52] sealed in the word what was a messenger
[41:55] coming for he was bringing a message
[41:57] that the people might have a true
[41:59] spiritual relationship where men might
[42:02] be new creatures in Christ be filled
[42:04] with his spirit and live according to
[42:07] his word don't you get mad at me but
[42:09] William bram's message was not just the
[42:11] bringing of the restoration of the gifts
[42:13] it was not just the bringing of the
[42:15] Pentecostal message he was a Moses but
[42:18] he was also a Joshua he was a Moses
[42:20] bringing them in but he was a Joshua who
[42:23] was positionally placing them in the
[42:25] inherit of the message of there listen
[42:28] Church don't you let some devil tell you
[42:30] that you don't have rights in this
[42:32] message don't you let some devil tell
[42:34] you you don't have rights in the third
[42:36] pole that's where your rights are laying
[42:38] is under the third
[42:41] pole now God has a provided way for
[42:43] everything right and God's provided way
[42:46] to declare his word is by prophet he
[42:48] said notice he wrote the Bible by his
[42:50] own chosen way he said and he chose the
[42:53] way his word came and the way by His
[42:55] prophets which which were predestinated
[42:57] and for ordained listen being a part of
[42:59] God's word amen declaring the revelation
[43:03] of his word to that age and that time so
[43:06] a prophet comes on the scene to declare
[43:09] the revelation of the word at the age
[43:12] and the time that is to be declared in
[43:14] have not I sent thee 62 he said a modern
[43:17] day Prophet is a preacher so a real true
[43:20] Prophet points back to the word of the
[43:22] Lord the promise of the Lord not the
[43:25] Declaration the church has made so
[43:27] that's why brother Brandon was not
[43:29] accepted when he was not pointing at the
[43:31] Baptist declaration he was not pointing
[43:33] at the Methodist declaration he was not
[43:35] poined at the Catholic declaration he
[43:37] said he's sent here Amen to declare what
[43:40] God has made amen now how can he declare
[43:43] it unless he sees it and how can he see
[43:46] it and how can he declare it unless he
[43:48] hears it listen friends you are not
[43:50] feeding on the mind of a man you are
[43:53] feeding on the unfailing body word of of
[43:56] the son of man what is on those tapes it
[43:59] did not come from Bob Jones University
[44:01] it did not come from Oral Roberts
[44:03] University what is on those tapes come
[44:06] directly from the back part of God's
[44:08] Mind through his chosen Channel a
[44:10] prophet of God and we are feeding on the
[44:13] unveiling of God we are feeding on the
[44:15] revelation we are feeding on the
[44:17] promises and they didn't come from a
[44:19] system they came from the Eternal part
[44:22] of God's mind I love this friends the
[44:26] God says in 1951 he said expectation now
[44:29] I stand Here somebody say stand here he
[44:32] says I stand Here declaring the creator
[44:35] of Heaven and Earth is Jehovah God he
[44:37] said now I claim to be a representative
[44:41] of his in these days to bring a faith to
[44:44] his church first pull second pull
[44:47] bringing a faith to his church why to
[44:50] catch the attention of the elect to
[44:52] believe the unveiling of the things that
[44:55] belong unto them come on 1964 looking
[44:59] under Jesus in the name of Jesus Christ
[45:02] I take every spirit in here under my
[45:04] control to declare the word of God see
[45:08] we have a responsibility Church the
[45:10] prophet of God said everything is a
[45:12] responsibility he said now this is hard
[45:14] to say but it's true that ministers many
[45:17] times amen they Sher a responsibility
[45:20] amen for standing for the true word of
[45:22] God when they are confronted with it
[45:25] they will sh that responsibility when
[45:27] the truth of the word of God is brought
[45:29] face to face with we human beings we are
[45:32] prone to Sher back until the last
[45:34] resource the message to leot in age 58
[45:37] he said before the church can ever be
[45:39] taken to Glory it has to go through this
[45:41] world of criticism and sometimes we try
[45:44] to Sherk amen or pull back from
[45:46] criticism but let me say what a prophet
[45:49] said he said God forbid I ever Sher the
[45:52] job amen then what was the job the job
[45:55] was to to see the job was to hear but
[45:58] the job was also to declare listen I say
[46:01] thank God that brother bradam brother
[46:02] Ben was not a hling he was not a
[46:05] politician when he stood there in the
[46:07] Seven Seals and said now this will cost
[46:09] me thousands of friends it'll close many
[46:12] doors he could have very easily sh back
[46:14] and said I see it and I've heard it but
[46:16] I'm not going to declare it but he went
[46:18] to a pull pit because he met an Angel
[46:21] and the angel visit him seven days and
[46:23] revealed to him the mind of God
[46:25] concerning the seven end time Mysteries
[46:28] and he come to a pullit and said the
[46:30] white horse rider is the Antichrist he
[46:32] said the souls on the altar are those
[46:34] that were killed in those martyrum days
[46:36] he stood there and said the seventh seal
[46:38] is the ministry of Malachi 4 Revelation
[46:41] 10 you say preacher You're Fired Up amen
[46:43] how could you believe what I believe and
[46:45] not be excited about it these things
[46:47] belong to me they belong to our children
[46:50] they belong to our young people and I
[46:52] think it's time somebody take their
[46:54] gloves off and see
[46:56] and hear and declare what a prophet has
[46:58] said in the age we're living
[47:01] in now come on I believe in shout but I
[47:03] think sometime or another we ought to
[47:04] get back to preaching the message on
[47:08] come on church amen this message has got
[47:10] some substance it's got something to say
[47:13] don't you ever forget the third seal he
[47:15] said it's the stimulation by the
[47:18] Revelation he never said it was
[47:20] Revelation from stimulation he said if
[47:22] you get the Revelation the revelation
[47:24] will cause the stimulation not the
[47:27] stimulation calls the
[47:29] Revelation now y'all know that's the
[47:31] truth he said see God forbid I ever Sher
[47:34] the job listen acts 20:27 Paul says it
[47:37] very beautiful he says I have not
[47:39] shunned to declare unto you all the
[47:42] counsel of God I love that word shun it
[47:44] means to draw back it means to let down
[47:47] or to lower it means to withdraw it is
[47:49] of a timid person to withdraw oneself it
[47:53] is example to be timid to cover to
[47:55] shrink of those amen who from Timothy
[47:59] hesitate to avow what they believe
[48:02] listen to be unwilling to utter from
[48:04] Fear now listen to this Paul said I've
[48:06] not shunned I've not drawn back to
[48:09] declare unto you the counsil of God what
[48:11] is the counsel of God according to the
[48:13] Greek definition oh my the counsel of
[48:16] God is the purpose of God so Paul knew
[48:20] that nothing could defeat the purpose of
[48:22] God so that's why he stood there and
[48:25] said I know when I leave that Grievous
[48:27] wolves are going to rise among you and
[48:29] they're going to take these things and
[48:30] they're going to pervert them come on
[48:32] they're going to twist them and they're
[48:34] going to draw a group of seven Thunders
[48:36] and a group of return and a group of
[48:38] perusia and a group of this and a group
[48:40] of that well come on church amen Paul
[48:42] told us these things were going to
[48:44] happen now don't y'all get mad at me
[48:46] amen amen but God but listen amen a lot
[48:48] of the false doctrines around this
[48:50] message were not started by Baptist
[48:52] preachers there wasn't some Pentecostal
[48:55] Guy come out of the the UPC Church and
[48:57] twisted the seven Thunders or Twisted a
[48:59] tent or Twisted the presence of God Amen
[49:01] but men arose right among us but the
[49:04] problem was amen they were not taught by
[49:07] the spirit they were not taught by the
[49:09] scripture they had a motive and an
[49:10] objective but I say thank God in the
[49:12] last days that God has fulfilled his
[49:15] word and he's raised up a true pure
[49:17] Ministry that'll study the message and
[49:20] they will find the answer to the
[49:21] question in the message brother B said
[49:24] it very beautiful unto me if I don't
[49:27] declare this counsel of God the people
[49:29] of this healing power can I say this
[49:31] like a prophet said he's here and he's
[49:34] here Christ the son of God is here right
[49:36] now to heal the sick and the needy he
[49:39] said this divinely revealed by the Holy
[49:41] Spirit the same angel of God that
[49:44] directs me to see visions and so forth
[49:46] like that and the healing of the sick so
[49:49] when he changed from the first pull to
[49:51] the second pull the angel did not change
[49:54] it was the same angel in the first pool
[49:56] it was the same angel in the second pool
[49:58] it was the same angel in the third pool
[50:01] see because a prophet cannot change a
[50:04] let me say like this a prophet cannot
[50:06] change the word because he's God's
[50:08] mouthpiece to declare God's attitude and
[50:12] according to a Vindicated Prophet God
[50:14] never changes his
[50:16] attitude about his word he said I've
[50:19] done the best I know how Lord I haven't
[50:21] sh to declare the whole counsil of God
[50:22] feeling Lord and knowing if I'd be back
[50:25] at you from tonight many sitting here
[50:27] it's going to already be in eternity and
[50:29] I know cuz I see you Lord and I told I
[50:32] told them that you love them and you got
[50:35] the same respect for them that you did
[50:38] for the woman that night many years ago
[50:40] do you know what he's talking about he's
[50:42] talking about the worst sinner in the
[50:43] city which was the woman amen that
[50:46] washed jesus' feet and he said the saint
[50:48] oh God he said the same attitude that
[50:51] you had towards her is the same attitude
[50:54] that you've got here tonight towards
[50:56] every sick person listen I'm just going
[50:58] to take the gloves off and preach for a
[51:00] second amen I think we need to get back
[51:02] to giving our all to every service and
[51:04] not cherry picking Services well I'll
[51:06] give my all on Sunday morning and I
[51:08] won't come on Sunday night and I might
[51:10] come back on Wednesday amen I think this
[51:12] listen friends this could be the last
[51:13] service that some of us has ever in this
[51:16] could be the last sermon that some of us
[51:17] ever preach but I say oh God Amen Let us
[51:21] give you our all let us lay aside every
[51:23] ambition let us lay aside whatever
[51:25] motive and let us come back to where
[51:27] Christ will become the absolute and will
[51:30] give our all regardless of how we
[51:33] feel I know what I'm talking about cuz
[51:36] sometimes it's real easy to come to
[51:37] church and you don't feel like entering
[51:39] in and you don't feel like pulling and
[51:41] you don't feel like singing and you
[51:42] don't feel like preaching amen come on
[51:44] preachers let's be honest amen you don't
[51:46] feel like getting up preaching amen but
[51:48] you get up there because you got a
[51:50] commission you got a responsibility and
[51:52] it is to declare what God has on his
[51:55] mind for that service well listen
[51:57] friends I think if men of God will
[51:59] declare what is on God's mind I think we
[52:01] ought to have some people that'll be
[52:03] happy to receive what God is on his mind
[52:06] yes sir y'all know I'm telling the truth
[52:09] prophet of God said I've got to declare
[52:11] because some of you may be in eternity
[52:12] before I come back next year another
[52:14] place he said he cannot be a Healer once
[52:16] and not a Healer again listen brother
[52:18] Bram could never go to the pull pit and
[52:20] not have a prayer line cuz he didn't
[52:22] feel like it come on he did not have
[52:25] option to go the pit and say well you
[52:27] know tonight I just don't feel like
[52:29] really putting forth an effort he went
[52:30] there when he bleeding from his tonsils
[52:32] when he was hurting in his stomach when
[52:34] he was sick in his body he found his
[52:36] place because he was a prophet that was
[52:39] established in the middle of the road
[52:41] and he was not just showing us what to
[52:43] say he was not just preaching good
[52:45] sermons he was showing us how to act in
[52:47] the trials and the situation come on
[52:50] church amen I probably preached it to
[52:52] you here but I'm going to preach it to
[52:53] you again real quick amen a prophet of
[52:55] God went to a pull pit and preached a
[52:57] message called the comforter with his
[52:59] mother or rather let me back up preached
[53:01] a message called it is becometh us to
[53:03] fulfill all righteousness and his mother
[53:05] was laying up the road dying and a
[53:07] prophet was in a pull
[53:09] pit I know this might get touchy but he
[53:13] didn't play a tape and stay home he went
[53:15] to the pull pit and preached you know
[53:17] why because he was a prophet of God he
[53:20] wasn't a hling he was a prophet and he
[53:22] comes down the end of that sermon and he
[53:23] says Lord I don't know may be gone he
[53:26] said but you called me to stand here and
[53:28] to declare your word and he said if
[53:30] she's gone on then I'll meet her on the
[53:32] other side Brother David he walks home
[53:34] and she's laying there breathing her
[53:36] final breast but he didn't stay home on
[53:38] Sunday night but he come right back to
[53:40] the pull pit and he stood there and said
[53:42] when I left mama was still breathing but
[53:44] God put me here to preach a message
[53:46] listen I know things happen and we're
[53:48] not able to be at church amen but quit
[53:50] letting little
[53:52] old quit letting little old weak excuses

[54:01] preach for a second amen I think some
[54:03] people's forgot 2020 I think they forgot
[54:06] when they laid in their rooms and cried
[54:08] like babies cuz they couldn't go to
[54:09] church I think well come on church I
[54:12] think some people's forgot what it was
[54:13] like when you didn't have the option to
[54:15] miss church when you felt like it
[54:17] because church was shut down I say oh
[54:19] God Amen restore The Passion of the word
[54:23] of God in the heart of the believer
[54:25] this is not a game this is a
[54:28] responsibility this is a message of the
[54:30] hour this is body changing
[54:33] power he said I've got to stand here and
[54:35] declare it when I don't feel like it I
[54:37] have to declare it I have to declare
[54:39] he's the same yesterday today and
[54:41] forever he's still got he never did
[54:44] declare he was the I was he declared
[54:47] he's the I am always he never declared I
[54:50] was I was I was I was or I will be I
[54:54] will be I will be brother Stewart every
[54:56] time he declared himself I
[55:00] am I am that I am I am the am I am that
[55:05] I am I am the one that was with Moses
[55:08] but I'm right here now I am the one that
[55:10] was representing the bread but I'm here
[55:12] in perfect realization I am the one that
[55:15] represented the water that come up out
[55:17] of the rock but here I am and I am that
[55:20] artisian well and if a man will drink of
[55:22] me he will never thirst again listen
[55:25] church I declare unto you tonight that
[55:27] the I am that I am is in this building
[55:30] present tonight and he's got the same
[55:33] attitude towards you he's got the same
[55:35] power for you that he had in the Bible
[55:38] days thank you Lord now I'm going to
[55:40] bring it on down because Paul writes to
[55:42] Timothy and says preach the word yes he
[55:45] says be instant in season out of season
[55:48] reprove rebuke exhort with all
[55:50] longsuffering and Doctrine brother said
[55:52] to preach he said we ministers we have
[55:54] Ord from you preach the word see that's
[55:57] why they call us Full Gospel preachers
[56:00] is we preach the whole
[56:03] word we preach the whole word the whole
[56:07] counsel of God so a prophet did not
[56:10] bring a buffet to the pull pit right he
[56:14] did not bring a buffet and say well
[56:16] here's something you may like and if you
[56:17] don't like that no whenever he preached
[56:20] he was preaching the full word of God
[56:23] now let me say this our preach of the
[56:25] message and our believing of the message
[56:28] it must somebody say must it must be
[56:31] free from Prejudice
[56:33] right the way we preach the message must
[56:36] be free from Prejudice The Way We
[56:38] believe the message must be free from
[56:40] Prejudice listen I'll say it like
[56:42] Webster says very beautiful definition
[56:44] he says it means an adverse opinion or a
[56:46] leaning formed without just grounds or
[56:49] before sufficient knowledge and instant
[56:51] of such judgment or opinion it is an
[56:53] irrational attitude of hostility amen
[56:56] directed against an individual a group a
[56:59] race or their supposed characteristics
[57:02] amen so now y'all y'all going have to
[57:04] just just relax with me and preach for a
[57:05] second amen cuz some of y'all sit
[57:07] through them Prejudice sermons
[57:09] on come on Church you sat through them
[57:12] Prejudice sermons and you thought I
[57:14] remember one time I was in a meeting and
[57:15] the guy was up here preaching and man he
[57:17] was just blasting this guy I'm blasting
[57:19] this church and Blasting this move and I
[57:20] mean it would be one thing if the church
[57:22] was on fire but everybody's sitting
[57:24] there asleep you know
[57:25] Brother D about halfway through it I
[57:27] about stood up and just said anybody in
[57:28] here struggling with
[57:30] this can we move on y'all know what I'm
[57:33] talking about amen because they didn't
[57:35] study and so the only thing they do is
[57:37] hear some late gossip and go to the pull
[57:39] pit and try to correct this guy and
[57:41] correct that guy amen but whatever
[57:43] happened to just preaching the message
[57:45] whatever just happened to studying what
[57:47] a prophet said and not com to the pullit
[57:50] with an irrational attitude or hostility
[57:52] towards this guy whatever happened this
[57:54] coming and saying brother bradam said it
[57:56] Church let's put our lives on it the
[57:58] word of God is revealed the power of God
[58:01] is here I tell you what happened if some
[58:03] guys got big for the britches and they
[58:05] thought the message needed them rather
[58:07] than them needing the message but you're
[58:08] looking at one country preacher right
[58:10] here that's not ashamed to say Amen my
[58:13] this message don't need my Ministry but
[58:15] my Ministry must have this message if I
[58:18] don't have this message we're another
[58:20] sinking symbol and sounding brass but
[58:23] with this message we have the Vindicated
[58:25] thus sayith the Lord and we're not
[58:27] following every feeling that comes
[58:28] through the
[58:29] building come on church amen let's just
[58:32] get back to preaching the message
[58:34] without prejudice and let's get back to
[58:36] believing the message without prejudice
[58:38] let's just get back to where we didn't
[58:39] care who did what or who was preaching
[58:42] what we were just happy to be in the
[58:44] house of God just one more time Amen to
[58:47] sing again to pray again to shout
[58:51] again I know I'm pushing against that
[58:53] devil but I really don't care cuz it's
[58:55] the truth this is not a Prejudice
[58:57] message this is a message of
[59:01] Grace you know I'm telling the truth you
[59:03] said brander you better be careful why
[59:05] should I be careful when the prophet of
[59:06] God said that Jesus himself was accused
[59:09] of prejudice now you know why people get
[59:11] accused of prejudice brother said
[59:13] because see when he come among the
[59:14] Pharisees and the Sadducees he did not
[59:17] join with her group come on he did not
[59:20] join with her group brother said if he
[59:22] would have come among them and said now
[59:23] you Pharisees are wrong I'm a sadducee
[59:25] are you Sadducees are wrong I'm a
[59:27] Pharisee the Pharisees would say see I
[59:30] told you right amen but he didn't come
[59:32] to any of them come on church he stood
[59:35] between them he did not go to the
[59:38] fundamentals he did not go to the
[59:40] Pentecostals he did not go to the
[59:42] Sadducees he did not go to the Pharisees
[59:44] he walked on the scene and he stood
[59:47] between them in other words Brother
[59:48] David he stood in the middle of the road
[59:51] and declared that when you seen me you
[59:54] have seen the father you know why he
[59:56] couldn't join the F the the Pharisees
[59:58] it's cuz they wouldn't let him declare
[1:00:00] that I and the father are one you know
[1:00:02] why he didn't declare or didn't join the
[1:00:04] Sadducees is because they would not let
[1:00:06] him declare that I am that one I am the
[1:00:09] one that was prophesied so in order to
[1:00:11] declare who he was he had to stand in
[1:00:13] the middle of the road where there was
[1:00:15] some Liberty to say when you've seen me
[1:00:18] you've seen the father well come on
[1:00:20] Church y'all give me a little preaching
[1:00:21] room amen I can't join some group and

[1:03:32] there's a pillar of fire where the
[1:03:33] message is laying and you have
[1:03:36] Liberty you have Liberty to have church
[1:03:39] come on Church there's no liberty in a
[1:03:43] ditch now the problem of God said it
[1:03:45] very beautiful he said you're not blind
[1:03:47] people you're sensible people and if I
[1:03:50] stood here and said these things for
[1:03:52] prejudice I say it because it's
[1:03:57] life I say it because it's life I'm
[1:04:00] responsible to God for saying
[1:04:02] it and I must say it and my message all
[1:04:06] the time knowing back there under
[1:04:08] healing and so forth was just to catch
[1:04:11] the people's attention knowing somebody
[1:04:13] say knowing the message would come and
[1:04:16] here it is yeah all right we're no
[1:04:20] longer waiting for it brother Joe it's
[1:04:22] here we have the Seven Seals open the
[1:04:26] Mysteries are showing the things has
[1:04:28] happened listen when the Revelation
[1:04:30] broke are you hearing me can I have a
[1:04:32] few more minutes when the Revelation
[1:04:34] broke if a prophet was in a ditch he
[1:04:36] couldn't have declared it but because he
[1:04:39] was in the middle of the road he could
[1:04:41] not hold back because the pressure of
[1:04:44] responsibility of Amos 3 was upon him
[1:04:47] the line has roared who can help but
[1:04:50] prophesy do you see just as Jesus
[1:04:53] couldn't hold back you know why Jesus
[1:04:55] couldn't hold back because it was given
[1:04:57] to his disciples Amen to know the
[1:04:59] mysteries of the Kingdom of
[1:05:02] Heaven I know some people don't like
[1:05:04] this but let's just say what the prophet
[1:05:05] said God of this evil age 65 now in
[1:05:08] doing this I have come here for the
[1:05:10] purpose of teaching the last vows the
[1:05:12] last seven vows and the last seven
[1:05:14] trumpets and the last seven thunders of
[1:05:16] the Book of Revelation amen time them
[1:05:18] together in this hour that we're now
[1:05:20] living to follow the opening of The
[1:05:22] Seven Seals the seven Church ages but
[1:05:25] now I took the opportunity to express to
[1:05:27] the people my belief and faith in God
[1:05:29] and then bringing you to the hour that
[1:05:31] we're living in and by this somebody say
[1:05:34] by this he said it's not appointed to
[1:05:36] any certain person Creed whatever it
[1:05:38] might be it's just as I see God's word
[1:05:42] so a prophet went through it y'all y'all
[1:05:44] know what I'm talking about amen read a
[1:05:46] quote who's she pointing
[1:05:48] at all right come on well let me just
[1:05:50] say this I'm not going to lose my
[1:05:52] Liberty to read a quote and have have to
[1:05:54] stand there all night explaining why I
[1:05:56] read it all right come on come on church
[1:06:00] I'm going to read it and keep on
[1:06:01] preaching because a prophet said it I
[1:06:03] don't have to balance the quote the
[1:06:05] quote is balanced
[1:06:08] itself last Sunday we had a very fine
[1:06:11] out pouring the spirit upon the word it
[1:06:12] was very lengthy and I hated to stay
[1:06:14] that long but yet we didn't know what
[1:06:15] time we're going to meet for our last
[1:06:16] minute and I want to be rather as Paul
[1:06:18] said of old I've not sunned to declare
[1:06:21] unto you the whole counsel of God he
[1:06:23] said Jesus said
[1:06:24] he kept nothing back from his disciples
[1:06:27] you know why because he was bringing
[1:06:29] them can I can I can I turn a corner
[1:06:31] here he was bringing them interpretation
[1:06:34] now the Bible says in second Peter 1:20
[1:06:36] knowing this first that no Prophecy of
[1:06:39] the scripture is of any private
[1:06:42] interpretation you know what that word
[1:06:43] prophecy means it is a discourse
[1:06:46] emanating from divine inspiration and
[1:06:49] declaring the purposes of God look at
[1:06:52] this word interpretation brother Joel
[1:06:54] the word interpretation is a loosening
[1:06:56] it's an un loosening I love this because
[1:06:59] private interpretation from the serpent
[1:07:02] evees interpreter binds the church amen
[1:07:05] but true interpretation from the spirit
[1:07:08] of Truth loosens the church come on you
[1:07:10] want me prove it to you by the Bible
[1:07:12] Eve's interpreter interpreted one word
[1:07:15] and put the whole human race in bondage
[1:07:17] but the spirit of Truth come and
[1:07:19] interpret the word and said You shall
[1:07:21] know the truth and the truth shall set
[1:07:23] you free you know what I'm saying
[1:07:25] tonight friends I'm saying if we'll just
[1:07:27] preach this message we will cast out the
[1:07:30] devil we will cast out evees interpreter
[1:07:32] we will cast out Lucifer we will cast
[1:07:35] out private interpretations we will cast
[1:07:37] out bondage and we will make way for
[1:07:39] Liberty to come in the church again and
[1:07:42] loose somebody's heart and lose
[1:07:44] somebody's life listen friends if we're
[1:07:46] afraid to preach it nobody's going to
[1:07:47] get
[1:07:51] free well brother Andrew what are you
[1:07:52] saying I'm saying with a said he said
[1:07:55] the preaching of the Gospel is the
[1:07:57] casting out of the devil you know why
[1:07:59] the devil's cast out so you can believe
[1:08:02] now can I say this to you preaching is
[1:08:04] spiritual warfare but you know what we
[1:08:06] don't do we don't quit right we don't
[1:08:09] quit we don't quit your pastors don't
[1:08:13] quit the evangelists don't quit the
[1:08:15] ministry don't quit you know why because
[1:08:17] we are accompanied by Angels the Bible
[1:08:20] says we've come to mount Z to the city
[1:08:22] of the Living God the Heavenly Jerusalem
[1:08:25] and to an innumerable company of angels
[1:08:27] can I say this to you the prophet of God
[1:08:29] said Angels appear in the end time all
[1:08:31] the prophets and the signpost point to
[1:08:33] this day that angels will appear
[1:08:35] prophets will arise signs and wonders
[1:08:38] and if God did that for those little
[1:08:40] Junctions back there then what will he
[1:08:42] do now when all hell is turned loose
[1:08:45] amen can I preach my way out of this
[1:08:47] when all hell is turned loose he said
[1:08:49] all heaven will turn loose angels will
[1:08:51] appear signs and wonders on the Earth
[1:08:53] Earth see the counterfeits are rising
[1:08:56] but God is proven which is right and
[1:08:59] wrong don't you get bogged down in
[1:09:01] Prejudice trying to prove the
[1:09:02] counterfeits and trying to prove the
[1:09:04] truth amen just preach the message the
[1:09:07] counterfeits arising the Bible said is
[1:09:09] Janice and jambers withstood Moses so do
[1:09:12] these also resist the truth men of
[1:09:14] corrupt Minds reprobate concerning the
[1:09:16] faith but they shall proceed no further
[1:09:18] for their their Folly shall be made
[1:09:21] manifest unto all men as theirs also was
[1:09:25] that is a Bible prophecy Brother David
[1:09:27] amen are you hearing me and the Bible
[1:09:29] said I'm going to I'm going to close on
[1:09:30] this point the Bible said as they wisted
[1:09:33] Moses in the last days they would
[1:09:36] reappear he says those Spirits again
[1:09:39] what just before the liberation of the
[1:09:42] people Oh Glory he said but Hallelujah
[1:09:46] The Liberation time is here well I want
[1:09:50] to tell Janice and jambers if you
[1:09:52] couldn't stop at days of Moses then
[1:09:54] you're not going to stop it now you know
[1:09:56] why Janice and jambers Rose up is they
[1:09:58] tried to stop the liberation of the seed
[1:10:01] of God but God overrode them and he
[1:10:04] delivered them just the same and I want
[1:10:06] to tell every Janice and jambers devil
[1:10:08] that rises up and tries to bind the
[1:10:10] church you didn't stop Moses and you
[1:10:12] won't stop this Third Exodus we're going
[1:10:15] to leave here hallelujah one of these
[1:10:18] mornings we're going to leave
[1:10:20] here sir the word is the truth sir
[1:10:24] the angels are here now can I just can I
[1:10:28] just say this to
[1:10:29] you the hour of Liberation is on
[1:10:33] us the hour of Liberation is on the
[1:10:36] church brother BR said beautifully he
[1:10:39] refers many time Stacks 2027 let me let
[1:10:41] me leave you with this last part of that
[1:10:43] definition of
[1:10:44] shund brother Ben it is to be unwilling
[1:10:47] to utter from Fear all
[1:10:50] right so you've seen something yeah and
[1:10:54] you've heard something and brother
[1:10:57] Danny it's time to declare it
[1:11:01] amen but a spirit of fear raises
[1:11:05] up and puts a pressure on you probably
[1:11:08] God said one of the greatest curses on
[1:11:09] the church today is fear Everybody's
[1:11:11] scared to death it's what's going to
[1:11:13] happen who
[1:11:15] what part four of Israel on the church
[1:11:17] the greatest thing I find against the
[1:11:18] church tonight is fear everybody scared
[1:11:20] to death about something what are you
[1:11:22] scared about all
[1:11:24] right if a man is born again he should
[1:11:27] be happy
[1:11:30] Carefree just like these fellows singing
[1:11:32] up here and the brother testifying back
[1:11:34] there just free there ain't nothing can
[1:11:37] harm you nothing present nothing future
[1:11:40] nothing can separate us from the love of
[1:11:41] God that's in Christ can I give you
[1:11:43] another one after Jesus rose from the
[1:11:45] dead his words were constantly fear not
[1:11:49] he said that's what's the trouble with
[1:11:51] the church today is scared today you're
[1:11:53] scared to death you're going to make a
[1:11:54] failure how can you fail when you're in
[1:11:59] [Music]
[1:12:00] Christ how can you fail when you're in
[1:12:03] Christ you cannot fail you've got
[1:12:07] everlasting life all demons and Hell
[1:12:10] cannot shake you you got everlasting
[1:12:12] life so don't be scared of failure right
[1:12:17] 365 times in your Bible Jesus says these
[1:12:19] words or the scripture refers to these
[1:12:21] words be not afraid that's right fear
[1:12:23] not little flock it's your father's good
[1:12:26] pleasure to give you the kingdom God has
[1:12:28] not given us the spirit of fear but of
[1:12:30] power and of love and of a sound mind
[1:12:32] listen this love is a powerful force
[1:12:35] there's nothing more strong than love
[1:12:37] love will make you trust love has no
[1:12:39] fear love cast out fear one of the
[1:12:42] greatest things I find among them is
[1:12:43] fear and what makes fear is lack of
[1:12:48] confidence if you lack confidence it'll
[1:12:51] make you fear but if if you
[1:12:55] love it Cast Away fear and that's the
[1:12:58] way God wants his church not so many as
[1:13:00] charter members he wants members that's
[1:13:02] loyal loves and believes and has
[1:13:04] confidence in
[1:13:06] him can I say this to you from Romans
[1:13:08] 8:15 you've not received the spirit of
[1:13:11] bondage again to fear but you've
[1:13:12] received the spirit of adoption whereby
[1:13:15] we cry AB by father can I tell you what
[1:13:19] a prophet said Lord he died and he sent
[1:13:22] back the holy spirit and he said to the
[1:13:25] church take this and fight with it
[1:13:28] follow me the greatest weapon was ever
[1:13:31] put in the hands of man is the Bible to
[1:13:34] be backed up with the Holy Ghost that
[1:13:36] Christ died at
[1:13:39] Calvary to free his church from
[1:13:43] superstitions fear doubt and
[1:13:48] trembling can I say something to
[1:13:51] you you've got the the weapon yes
[1:13:56] amen that's right you've got the weapon
[1:13:59] what are you afraid of come
[1:14:04] on you're carrying the
[1:14:09] weapon oh that's good I'm going to tell
[1:14:13] on
[1:14:14] myself and I was a little boy my
[1:14:17] grandmother lived here and my
[1:14:19] great-grandparents lived across the road
[1:14:21] kind of kindy caty quarter so from my
[1:14:23] grandmother's porch you could look
[1:14:24] straight across and see my great
[1:14:26] grandparents so one night there was a
[1:14:28] big snow come in feel I mean the the it
[1:14:31] was biggest snow East Tennessee ever
[1:14:33] probably seen in my generation it was it
[1:14:35] it was horrible we didn't know how to
[1:14:37] act in that so we all piled up
[1:14:39] grandmother's house and they were making
[1:14:41] she made some cookies or bread or
[1:14:42] something well Nanny and Grande was
[1:14:44] across the road and so I got the right
[1:14:46] idea to sneak in there when nobody was
[1:14:48] watching get a pan of cookies and sneak
[1:14:50] out across the across the snow and get
[1:14:53] get out on the road well brother Danny I
[1:14:54] got about to the road and when I did
[1:14:56] there was a big I never forget there was
[1:14:58] a big Bronco like truck thing coming
[1:15:00] down the road and it had chains on it
[1:15:02] and it was like you know real real loud
[1:15:04] and it I mean it was completely dark
[1:15:06] outside the guy didn't even have his
[1:15:07] headlights on and he and now this was
[1:15:09] back when everybody was scared death
[1:15:11] kidnapping you know so that's when we
[1:15:13] were taught you know if you get caught
[1:15:15] you so I'm standing there and I see this
[1:15:18] truck and he stops right here in my
[1:15:20] right here at my grandmother's driveway
[1:15:22] and I'm just a little kid standing there
[1:15:24] and I'm looking up and the guy gets out
[1:15:26] and he's got all black on and he comes
[1:15:28] walking towards me and he says come over
[1:15:30] here to my truck well brother Joe I took
[1:15:33] off running back to the house I don't
[1:15:35] know where them cookies are something
[1:15:36] eat them he might have picked him up but
[1:15:40] I ran back in the house and I was just
[1:15:42] shaking I never forget my grandmother
[1:15:43] come over she said what's wrong with you
[1:15:45] I said there was a guy out there who
[1:15:46] tried to get me tried to get me I
[1:15:48] don't so so she's like well what did he
[1:15:52] look I said I don't know it was black it
[1:15:54] was dark I couldn't see nothing so from
[1:15:56] that time I'm telling this for a point
[1:15:58] and I'm closing so from that time every
[1:16:00] time I'd go hunting as a kid we we would
[1:16:04] I'm telling on
[1:16:05] myself we'd go before
[1:16:09] daylight and in my mind that guy was in
[1:16:13] those woods
[1:16:15] somewhere I never will forget it my
[1:16:17] uncle Matthew and I one of my uncles I
[1:16:19] can't remember exactly which one but we

[1:19:14] sea Jesus had went away to rest and a
[1:19:18] storm arose I got two minutes and a
[1:19:20] storm
[1:19:21] arose and the ship Brother David is
[1:19:24] tossed and the Bible says the ship was
[1:19:27] now in the midst of the sea tossed with
[1:19:29] waves for the wind was
[1:19:31] contrary
[1:19:33] wind wind where about oh Ephesians 4:14
[1:19:37] carried about with every wind of
[1:19:41] Doctrine but in the Fourth Watch of the
[1:19:44] night Jesus went un them walking on the
[1:19:47] sea the water thou sawest is the
[1:19:49] thickness of the multitude the people
[1:19:51] and when the disciples saw and walking
[1:19:53] on the sea they were troubled listen
[1:19:55] they're already drowning the ship is
[1:19:58] falling apart and they're scared and
[1:20:00] they said it's a spirit and they cried
[1:20:03] out for fear they're they're sister
[1:20:06] sister they're going to the bottom
[1:20:08] they're they're on their way the ores
[1:20:09] are broke the Master's Fallen the helm
[1:20:11] is gone the the ship brother Stewart is
[1:20:13] falling apart it's filling up with
[1:20:17] water the ship is full of fear and here
[1:20:20] comes Jesus walking on the waters and
[1:20:24] they seem and they're more afraid of him
[1:20:26] than they are the ship that's falling
[1:20:27] apart they said now this is a spirit
[1:20:30] this is spooky but you know what Jesus
[1:20:32] said he looked at him and said these
[1:20:34] words he said be of good cheer it is I
[1:20:38] Be not Afraid you know what he done he
[1:20:42] rebuked the fear by declaring his
[1:20:46] presence he rebuked for fear by
[1:20:49] declaring this is not our was I'm not I
[1:20:52] will be it is I it is the I am and I
[1:20:56] have come down to deliver you and the
[1:20:59] fear backed up prably God said today
[1:21:02] people are something on that order like
[1:21:03] they was in the days when the disciples
[1:21:04] on the ocean the night Storm come up
[1:21:06] there wasn't nothing all hopes was gone
[1:21:09] and they seen him come walking on the
[1:21:10] water now their ship was waterlogged and
[1:21:13] the sails was broke and the ores were
[1:21:15] gone they were holding one another
[1:21:17] screaming and they looked out there and
[1:21:18] seen him come walking on the water and
[1:21:21] was scared of him
[1:21:23] I'm after a devil right now and I'm
[1:21:24] going to get him and their only hope
[1:21:26] they were afraid of the only thing that
[1:21:29] could save them if that ain't a true
[1:21:32] picture again of today they thought it
[1:21:35] looked spooky you know they said it's
[1:21:37] fear it's a spirit but watch if you'll
[1:21:39] notice when they cried out when they
[1:21:42] cried out they Heard a Voice come back
[1:21:45] and the voice said fear not it is I Be
[1:21:49] not Afraid be of good courage Church of
[1:21:52] the Living God God can I preach to you
[1:21:54] right now brother Jeremy when he rebuked
[1:21:56] the fear he replaced it with
[1:21:59] courage when he rebuked the fear he
[1:22:02] replaced you with courage and the
[1:22:04] prophet said and if you'll just watch
[1:22:05] The Word of Promise for this day you'll
[1:22:07] hear the same voice speaking through the
[1:22:10] word it is me I promis to do this in the

[1:22:36] walking brother Ben through
[1:22:38] churches Brother David is walking
[1:22:40] through men's studies and they're
[1:22:42] looking at it and they're scared to go
[1:22:44] to a pull pit and just say what a
[1:22:46] prophet
[1:22:47] said it's walking through their studies
[1:22:50] and brother Danny they're afraid to go
[1:22:51] to a pull pit and preach a
[1:22:53] adoption come on Church they're afraid
[1:22:55] to go to a pull pit and preach what a
[1:22:57] prophet said because there's some
[1:22:59] pressure there's some fear well if I say
[1:23:02] it but can I say this fear is
[1:23:07] defeated fear is defeated and when fear
[1:23:10] Was Defeated strength stepped in and
