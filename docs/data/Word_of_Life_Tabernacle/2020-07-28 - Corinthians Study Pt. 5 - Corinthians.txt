========================================

all right hello welcome to our bible study on first corinthians we've been doing these had been doing these for a while before when we were shut down for a little while as a church from being able to meet together but they were a blessing i think to some people we made it through chapter one uh last time so what i want to try to do is go through uh start at chapter two and uh if you wanna go back and review chapter one uh there's four videos on that uh that you can go and it's just titled corinthians chapter um our corinthian study parts one through four but that's chapter one uh chapter one uh taught us that god was faithful to correct the corinthian church that there were parties in that church so so we need to understand that this was a church that was god's church this was not a apostate church this was a true church but it was a church that had problems and i think we all want to be the ephesian church as i said before but i think the corinthian church is often where we find ourself living and the ephesian church was a model church but the corinthian church was also a church that belonged to god and so god was faithful to correct that church we found that the parties of paul and apollos and peter and christ were equally wrong um all of these and it was not that paul was wrong or apollos was wrong or that peter was wrong or especially we know christ we know he wasn't wrong but these men that followed them had made a division or a schism as paul says in the body and and the schism was wrong and so the book of corinthians deals with that and you'll see it all the way through the book from the beginning to the end that paul is constantly dealing with one of these factions in the church paul apollos peter and christ we found that the world already has entertainment they already have the ability to entertain themselves and we find that's true today and that greek world that paul was speaking to writing to was that way as well they don't need entertainment they need jesus so we have what they need and brother branham taught us that and we went through that we found that god does not call many wives noble or mighty not many philosophers not many great men so-called in the world today he doesn't call many strong men but he calls the weak and he calls the ignorant the unlearned and he calls them to proclaim his gospel to preach the gospel and so we thank god for that as jesus said he didn't call the the wise and the prudent but he called babies that would learn and so we thank god for that let's start with first corinthians chapter two first corinthians chapter two and verse one and hopefully uh some have been able to join us by now first corinthians chapter 2 and verse 1. if you're not able to join us live this will be archived later on you'll notice we're in a new location i'm at the church at the office in the church and i've got peter and esther here helping me do this today let's have a word of prayer before i begin reading in first corinthians chapter 2 and verse 1 heavenly father thank you for all that you do for us every day thank you for bringing us together again lord and through this bible study and i pray that those that would hear it and would watch it lord in the church would be blessed by it and that it would just give us a better understanding and a depth to our understanding of of the things that you brought us in the scriptures we thank you for all that you do we pray for each one that each one will be blessed in jesus name amen first corinthians chapter 2 and verse 1 paul says and i brethren when i came to you came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of god that word excellency is interesting it's an elevation preeminent superiority metaphorically excellent he said i didn't come to you in a way that would be described as anything special if we could put it like that anything out of the ordinary as far as my speech now the corinthian church had been exposed at this time to a man named apollos who was an extraordinary speaker and apollos and i don't want us to get the idea that apollos was a bad man because he was not he was a great uh preacher and a great evangelist of that time a great teacher of the word he was not a bad man but he wasn't paul and that's kind of what we'll be dealing with this and paul is defending himself and the way that he came he came in a certain way for a purpose because he was the messenger of that age and let's look at apollos for a moment apollos was um a certain jew in acts chapter 18 and verse 24 it calls him a certain jew named apollos and that's an interesting thing because apollos is a greek name so he must of like timothy had a had a greek influence in his life and he says he was born in alexandria which was the center of learning for the ancient world so he was born there where all of the wisdom of the ancient world would have been available to him and so it says that he was an eloquent man it means he spoke well and he was mighty in the scriptures that means that he knew what he was talking about as far as being a jew and it says that he came to ephesus so this is one of the factions in the corinthian church and we'll find out why in verse 25 it says this man was instructed in the way of the lord and this is acts 18 25. this man was instructed in the way of the lord so he had been taught well and he was fervent in the spirit which means that he was easy to listen to or he was exciting he spoke with passion about the things of god and that's the way we should speak and that's how apollos spoke to the people he spake and taught diligently on the things of the lord but he knew only the baptism of john so we did not recognize what had been done through christ and he did not recognize the authority or the power of being baptized in the name of jesus christ so he did not recognize these things he needed to be he needed to learn he needed to be taught there's two reasons why that people don't believe the message and some because they don't know many many because they don't know and some because they reject it and so apollos was not a rejecter he was not an apostate but he was a man who taught everything that he knew he was a good follower of john the baptist and his followers you find where paul later found some of his follower followers at i believe it was at ephesus he found his followers and he found that these followers had not come to the holy ghost because they didn't know that there was a holy ghost because they only knew john's baptism and so paul comes and challenges them and he says have you received the holy ghost since you believed and so that's an important thing now apollos though was a great speaker and in verse 26 it says he began to speak boldly in the synagogue whom when aquila and priscilla had heard so it's interesting because you can imagine that they're in this setting of of going to the synagogue and they come and they had a special speaker that saturday and it was a alexandrian jew and i'm sure they were excited to hear him was an eloquent man and come with much with much acclaim and he had much many people that thought well of him but when they went to hear him then they realized he doesn't know about jesus and so what did they do they brought him home for dinner and they began to talk to him and they expounded unto him the bible says the way of god more perfectly and brother branham kind of puts it like this and i'm paraphrasing but he said that aquila and priscilla found apollos and they said hang on a little bit paul's going to be in town after a while and he'll be able to tell you some things about about jesus that you just don't realize yet and and show you how the gospel has gone further and how light has has come further than what you understood so in verse 27 apollos and again this is important because this is one of those factions in the corinthian church if you're going to understand the book of corinthians you have to understand apollos and why they were so tied to him and it's a lot of what paul deals with in acts 18 27 it says when he was disposed to pass into ikaya the brethren wrote exhorting the disciples to receive him who when he was come helped them much so he was not just an eloquent speaker he was not just a a great speaker in that way but he was an effective speaker and in going back it said that he was instructed in the way of the lord he was fervent in spirit and he taught diligently the things of the lord and now it's saying that he helped him much so he was educated we could say he was revelated we could say he was dedicated he was fervent and we could also say that he was effective so he was a great he was a great minister there's no doubt about that so he helped them much who had believed through grace that's the kind of preacher that you want to have by now in acts 18 28 it says for he might mightily he mightily convinced the jews he mightily convinced the jews so he was effective in his ministry in getting people to believe in christ that publicly showing by the scriptures that jesus was the christ you know apollos was a great preacher and i think it this really bears on on what we have today in in the message he's a great preacher but he wasn't paul and not being paul made a difference there's only one messenger to the age and no matter how much you respect your pastor or how much and i appreciate that or some other pastor you respect some man that preaches they are not the messenger to the age so no matter who might come after the messenger and who might be able to preach eloquently and help you understand the things of god they're not the messenger and to apollos's credit he never tried to make himself the messenger he never did that there was one messenger to the age and only one and there was only one man who could stand there and say if an angel from heaven preaches any other thing than what i've preached let him be accursed only one man could say that and that was paul but apollos willingly followed the message of paul as soon as he was aware of it now we don't know much about apollos after this there is a a note of in titus 3 13 that paul and apollos were working together and and most uh theologians believe that titus was written the book of titus was written from corinth so paul this is later after he's written the book of books of corinthians he comes back to corinth and apollos at that time was also back at corinth and paul gives him the letter to titus and so it says bring zenus the lawyer and apollos on their journey diligently so they were the carriers of the letter to titus nothing be wanting unto them it's interesting because we find that paul and apollos are still working together and it speaks greatly to the character of apollos that he understood and knew that he was not the messenger to the age but he stood behind the messenger of the age he was a great preacher he didn't quit preaching he didn't stop proclaiming the gospel but he wasn't paul and he understood that uh we'll find out later in the corinthian book of corinthians first corinthians that apollos actually would not come to corinth when paul wanted him to and the reason historians believe the reason was because he was so disgusted by the attitude of the people towards himself that they had elevated him to a position that he didn't want and so he refused to come to corinth even though paul desired him to said he wasn't his his desire to do that um the ancient writer jerome says that apollos was so disgusted by that attitude that he actually retired from ministry for a while but we know he and again we know he refused to come to corinth but he says he actually retired from ministry went away to his home for a while and then he eventually come back and and ended up back in corinth with paul so apollos was a great man he just wasn't paul and it's interesting that again in titus 3 13 that he's found carrying the message of paul so even though he was a great preacher and probably a better preacher than paul probably more eloquent than paul as far as the speaker but he carried the message of paul paul was the messenger of the age and even peter and apollos and all these other ones that certain ones that brought factions in their name recognize that paul had was given a dispensation of grace to the gentiles and was the messenger to that age first corinthians 2 2 verse 2 says for i determined and and we'll just go down a couple more verses here he says for i determined to not to know anything among you save jesus christ and him crucified we think i purposefully put everything else out of my mind except for jesus christ and him crucified now the greek implies there that the only definite thing that i made it my business to know among you this is that next slide the only definite thing that i made it my business to know among you was to know jesus christ and i put this on here so you would see there's two things i want to know christ that's the person and him crucified is the office so paul says i i let everything else go except for christ and his present work this was the focus of his ministry christ and his present mediatorial work that's what he wanted to focus on and we find that in our prophet as well that there was a focus on christ in his present office now paul does not even focus on christ in his future office he does not focus on him as the son of david sitting on a throne but he focuses on him in his present work not his future work but in his present office christ and him crucified that was the focus of paul's ministry and i'm sure some of the others might have come through and preached about the millennium preached about things that were coming and paul preached about things to come as they as they were relevant to the believers of that age but he preached christ and him crucified to the corinthians that was his focus the person of christ and the office of christ brother branham says this about that he says we have life through christ and him alone our organizations our denominations our differences only separates us from god we have one access to god and that's through jesus christ there's not another way that we can come through him by no priest no preacher no system so just saying well i believe the message or i'm a baptist or i'm a pentecostal that won't bring you to christ you have to come through christ no preacher no priest no system or nothing else only jesus christ and him crucified and another message called the absolute brother branham said he's my absolute he's my all anything outside of that nothing in my arms i bring i know nothing else besides christ and him crucified he says i don't want to hear nothing else but christ and him crucified my heart says amen to every one of his promises that's why i know his holy spirit is a compass it guides me to the word and so he says that's my absolute the person and the work the present work of jesus christ so he says christ and him crucified and that word crucified in vincent's word studies it says this that that word is emphatic and it's interesting that that which would be the main stumbling block to the corinthians is what paul would emphasize because he says the cross was a stumbling block to the to the corinthians to the greeks in general because they saw it as something horrible a shameful death and so they tried to bypass that and just preach the parts of the scripture that weren't so so ugly in their eyes but paul says christ and him crucified i want to emphasize the very thing that would be a stumbling block because this is what you need to come to this is what you need to do and so paul says i was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling i was with you in weakness and in fear and much trembling and the word i was with you it says when i came to you this is the way that i was i think this is interesting because it helps me as a preacher to know that even the great apostle paul had to deal with that i was with you in weakness i was with you in fear and weakness would be physical weakness he said i was physically weak when i was with you he said i was with you in fear and in much trembling and the god's word version which i like it's a more recent translation but it's sometimes i'll go to it just to kind of get a a different uh take on the original greek and he said this when i came to you i was weak i was afraid and very nervous and i think all of us preachers can identify with that to some extent but paul said that's the way i came to you and paul could be different he could be eloquent he had been taught all these things and brother branham speaks of it as if paul did this purposefully that he purposefully came to him in that way acts chapter 18 and verse 3 we found that while he was there and this is this is interesting if you go back and read acts chapter 18 it's a good thing to go back and help you understand how paul came to the city of corinth we found that he actually worked when he came there when he said he was with him in weakness he was a working preacher while he was there in a in acts 18 3 it says because he was of the same craft he abode with them it was priscilla and aquila and wrought in other words he worked for them by their occupation they were tempt makers he we could put it this way he worked in their factory he was a worker just another worker he wasn't didn't come as a rich man but he come as a worker and then if you go down in acts chapter 18 it talks about how he come to corinth and some of the things that he went through in verse 8 it says that crispus the chief ruler of the synagogue believed on the lord with all his house many of the corinthians hearing believed and were baptized and then in in verse 9 there's an interesting side note it says then spake the lord to paul in the night by a vision be not afraid remember he said i was with you in fear and so the lord spoke to him in a vision and said be not afraid but speak hold not by peace and so paul had come to the corinthians which would have been the wealthiest city in the world or one of the wealthiest cities in the world at that time one of the most decadent one of the most sinful cities in the world at that time and you'll find where paul goes to the jews and many of the jews won't believe although the ruler of the synagogue did many of the jews did not believe and so he shook the dust off his feet he went to the gentiles in that city and and and he's going to a new group of people and people that he's never met he's afraid he's with them in weakness and fear and trembling and the angel says be not afraid but speak and hold not thy peace for i am with thee that no man shall set on thee to hurt thee for i have much people in this city so he tells him he says i'm going to be with you and there's a reason why you're here may not seem like it now but i have much people in this city and the bible tells us he continued there a year and six months a year and a half is a long time for paul in fact he only stayed at one place longer in his life as far as working in a church and that was at the church with the church at ephesus i believe he was there for three years first corinthians 2 4 let's look at this my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom so he said i could have come like this but i didn't he said but in demonstration of the spirit and the power i'll just read what brother branham says about this is so wonderful in perfect strength by perfect weakness brother random says could you imagine a man a pharisee of the pharisees a teacher of the teachers a man that was trained from childhood for the ministry to be an eloquent man that was smart and brilliant to come before a class of people like the corinthians to say i was with you in weakness with you in fear and much trembling he said the man who turned the world upside down the greatest missionary that's ever been known confessed that he common weakness not as a trained scholar but in weakness and fear lest he would step off the path somewhere and much trembling because he could not trust in his own ability brother brando said the reason he was fearing not because he was scared of anything but he was scared he would displease god in some way god help us to be in fear of that his ministry he said he was scared of that he would displease god in some way that he'd get his own ability mixed up into it he said something that he had learned he was telling them i didn't come to you with these excellency of speech brother adam turns it around he said i come to you in fear that i would come that way so i was actually in fear not in fear of the people but i was in fear that i would come to you with my natural ability instead of coming to you with the word of god wow what an example paul says for us today he said i come to you in fear that i would come that way but i come to you knowing nothing but christ and him crucified brother branham in christ is the mystery of god revealed he reads this where paul says i come to you in demonstration of the spirit and the power and he said there see there is the gospel there is the gospel and you'll find all the way through the message brother branham says the gospel is not teaching only but it's demonstration of the spirit and power he said there you see there is the gospel jesus said go into all the world and preach the gospel he didn't say go teach he said go preach in other words demonstrate the power these signs shall follow them just teaching doesn't do it now not that teaching is wrong that's what we're doing today teaching is not wrong we have to have teaching but that doesn't do it by itself it takes the actual spirit itself demonstrating these signs now why did paul come to them like that verse 5 that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of god adam clark says of that verse that your face should not stand that the illumination of your souls listen to this your conversion to god might appear to have nothing human in it your belief therefore of the truths which have been proposed to you is founded so he says this he said your faith won't stand it won't be founded on the wisdom of men so your belief is not founded the truths that have been proposed to you is not founded in human wisdom but in divine power human wisdom was not employed and human power if it had been employed it could not have produced the change and you'll find out that brother branham deals with that as well that what paul's talking about when he talks about the power it's the power to change you can go back and look at it he says my speech was in demonstration of the spirit and the power that your faith should not stand what your faith the change that has come to you the what made you a christian the foundation of who you are as a christian would not be because a man talked you into it but in the power of god not in the wisdom of men but the power of god the power of what the power to change and that's why we need life preaching today because we display when we preach not only the signs and the wonders and that's that's we do that that's a demonstration of the spirit but a power a power to change paul from a jew that hated christianity to a follower of christ he said we display the power of the gospel to change a life how powerful is that every one of us do that as ministers we do that and as lay people we do that we display in our lives the power of god to change a life i'll leave you with this today i think we i think we need to rethink what powerful preaching is paul said our brother branham says the world won't be converted by money the world will be converted by the holy ghost he said powerful preaching of the holy ghost and the cross will be the only thing that will convert the world powerful preaching power to do what again to change paul understood the power of the gospel to change everything about him everything that he stood for everything that he was from the worst sinner pharisee that there was to the messenger of the age he says that will be the only thing the powerful preaching of the holy ghost on the cross will be the only thing that will convert the world god's program is not money it's the holy ghost that's what god's program is is for the laodicean church age or any other church age it was that for the ephesian church age it's that for the laodicean church age it's still that the program of god is still the powerful preaching of the holy ghost and the cross and that'll be the only thing that'll convert the world what is powerful preaching it's not eloquence or fervents of spirit those things are wonderful we love it when an apology is able to come and preach to us but it's a focus on the person and work of christ and a demonstration of the power of the gospel to change lives and that's what we need more than anything else in the message of the hour and whatever denomination you might belong to that's what you need is the power of the gospel to change lives i got a note from a brother while i was here a very special unspoken prayer request and could use some prayers i want to pray for him if you have a need today and you want to be prayed for and then tomorrow night we'll have service on wednesday night our regular service brother braden savage he'll be with us we'll be here if it's at all possible but i'm going to be praying with this brother for this special unspoken prayer request and if you have a need we'll be praying together for that as well heavenly father lord jesus for the needs that are represented here today i pray that you'd come and you'd speak to each one of them i pray that this would be a blessing in some way and perhaps we'll get to do this on a more regular basis i pray god that you just speak to our lives this is what we live for it's the word of god father and maybe just an interruption of the weekday or maybe during lunch or in some way we've been able to look at this maybe later come back and and study it i pray god that you would just move and and may the words impact our lives in a mighty way not my words lord but the word of god i pray heavenly father for this special unspoken prayer request by our brother you know what it is and i pray lord that you just give him the ability to know what to do father and and whatever the situation is we know that you're god lord and so we pray that you would just come and meet that need today i pray that you'd speak lord in every one of our services that you'd pray every one of our prayers that you'd walk in every one of our lives if we're not a preacher or may we come and preach by the lives that we live to the people that we're around i pray you'd grant it bless us now as we continue our day thank you for those that watch those who will in jesus name amen god bless you
