that enjoyed that special as well and we just want to get into the word tonight i enjoy these wednesday nights very much and so we're glad to have them i always try to pray about our service schedule and what to do and and how to have church when to have church and all of that and of course you have an input in that as far as when you show up so we always appreciate that you coming we're a body we do things as a body and sometimes you may not agree with everything so well it should be done differently but when the body moves you move with it because you're part of the body and it all comes out all right and in the end and so we're grateful for that and and uh we'll have one service this sunday many of several people are going to be gone some are gone tonight and on vacation and and i want to give you a little time to spend with your families i recognize that these sundays are hard but it's also been very fruitful for us to have a sunday afternoon service and so we want to continue to do that and then but this sunday just one service because of the holiday and i'll be here this sunday the next sunday i won't be here i'll be at brother uh wendell's as i we usually do on that sunday when they have their meetings and brother stewart will be here and brother malachi god will be here with us that sunday afternoon and so we're looking forward to that and i'm sure that you are and then uh so we'll have that we will have the men's bible study on saturday uh if anybody's gonna be here to show up so but i'll be there anyway i think brother joel's going on a hunting trip and some of y'all are gonna be gone but brother caleb are you gonna be here on saturday they might be going away well i'll i'll let you know about the men's bible study because i was counting on brother kale to be the only one there but no we'll see about that because that we may go ahead because next next time i won't probably be able to do it because meetings coming up uh do you love the lord tonight there's always something going on in there but we're a busy bunch of people but i'd rather have it that way than than nothing to do but we've got things to do we got something to do tonight let's get into the word matthew 12 and 38 then certain of the scribes and of the pharisees answered saying master we would see a sign from thee but he answered and said unto them an evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign in other words prove to me that what you're saying is true he said an evil and adulterous generation seeks after that there shall no sign be given to it but the sign of the prophet jonas for as jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly so shall the son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth the men of nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation and shall condemn it because they repented at the preaching of jonas behold a greater than jonas is here amen don't you believe that greater one is here tonight amen let's bow our heads together for a word of prayer we've talked and and done different things let's just ask god to be with us tonight heavenly father we're so grateful for your presence that we've already felt in the song service lord i'm grateful for these people that have come together in unity lord on a wednesday night and lord and put their thoughts and their their heart lord towards you i pray god that you'd help us to lord that there would be signs of life among us lord that we would show the sign of the resurrection in whatever way that you called for us to do it i pray lord that you'd move lord in a mighty way and maybe there'd be some need tonight and that i wouldn't know about but lord you know what it is i pray you would meet that need tonight or maybe someone that's watching i know several that couldn't be here or watching tonight on their trip or whatever and i pray god that you bless them lord and that they would receive as well from the service but especially lord for these that are here i pray just a special blessing on a wednesday night as we look into your word for a few moments and may it just open up to us god may we see it like we never have before and may we stand on that rock of revelation we pray in jesus name amen god bless you you could be seated tonight jonah walks out of a fish's belly when he should have been dead i i wish i had time i'd just stop and preach on this the whole service brother branham said the fish goes up to the edge of the water goes up to the edge of the land and out of the water and sticks his tongue out that's a big fish jonah comes walking out you know walking out of a fishes but he's got seaweed around his neck he's got vomit and all kinds of stuff on him but he's alive he's the first man ever walked alive out of a fish's belly he should have been dead he should have been dead some of us know what that feels like we know what that's like we should have been dead every intellectual thought every everything that that we can think of we we could think like this that well i should have went uh the way my brother did or my sister did or my mother did or my father did or my family did that's what i should have been i should have been a drug addict i should have should have been an alcoholic i should have been whatever in sexual sin or whatever that it was but god protected me god kept me i come out of the belly of the well and some of you may have experienced what it's like to be spiritually dead but you walked out one day and you begin to show what was the sign of the resurrection in jonah he was alive he was alive and the fact that he was alive was assigned to those people who worshipped the fish god dagon that that this was assigned to them that the message that jonah brought was true and the sign that the message that we carry today do you believe we carry a message we carry this message we're we're responsible we didn't bring it but we're carrying it today we're responsible for carrying the message and then if we walk out alive we carry the message of people or we'll believe it if they're a seed of god but the reason many times people don't believe is because the body is still dead if there's been no resurrection of the body they're not going to believe what you have to say but if the body's alive that's why we want the church to be alive that's why we want the church to be lively it don't mean that you have to be running and shouting and screaming all the time it means they're signs of life signs of life in the church signs of life in the fellowship paul signs of life at home are you with me today signs of life in your prayer life in your in your time with god there needs to be signs of life evidence of a resurrection because if there's no evidence what difference are we than the baptist what difference is it then we could go to the pentecostal church or somewhere else but there needs to be signs it's more than just shouting in church but it's a sign a life that's there let there be life in the church are you with me tonight i don't want to settle for a dead religion something that has no movement to it you can't tell but when jonah come walking brother jt out of that fish the people knew that man's alive or you hear me tonight the people ought to know that this church is alive it shouldn't be something we have to say well we're a church that's alive i saw you know churches brand themselves all kinds of things i saw a church one time said the church alive well it ought to be that the people recognize that it's alive not because that's what's on the sign but because we are alive we're a living church the peter says you're lively stones we weren't called to death we're called to life and that evidences itself manifests itself in our everyday life in everything that we do not just in the church house but everywhere else but we're not we're not worried about you say well i i feel like that nothing's going right but if you're alive you're alive for a reason you come out of the belly of hell and you walked out carrying a message and so everything with jonah was exactly where god wanted it to be are you hearing me tonight but brown said many times we get nervous and we begin to think well it ought to be this way we get nervous and we begin to think well it ought to be this way well so they don't know what they're doing we we need to change this we need to we need to fix this no he said he said we've got to make it this way or make it that way he said we don't have nothing to do into it just play our part that he leads us to play right because we're part of that lively stone that lively body right we're a part of that body that's alive let me show you sometimes it's very simple in one way in another way it's very deep but we're a part of that sign of the resurrection because we're part of the body we have a we are partaker in a son of man ministry in the revealing of the son of man because we are part of that body so now he said we don't have nothing to do and into it you just play our part that he leads us to play if you're a deacon you play the part of a deacon if you're a trustee you play the part of a trustee if you're the pastor you play the part of the pastor and minister the part of the minister housewife the part of the housewife are you with me tonight you're playing the part you're not worried about what somebody else is doing what some of the church is doing what some of their family in the church is doing you don't spend all your time worrying about that but you're going to play your part you have a part right each one of you and i could call all of you out but each one of you has a part i get encouraged when i when i see some of you and just come into the house of god and i think what an effort that you put forth to come to the house of god you've got a part in the body of christ you've got a part in the resurrection some of you young families that are raising your children right and we see your children begin to grow up in the fear and admonition of the lord you've got a part in the life of the body of christ you older folks that have to get up and and really push yourself to come to church brother bill but that's you're part of the resurrection life you're part of that revealing of the son of man i'm getting ahead of myself but i'm going to show you here after a while you're a part of that we are the revelation of the word right i hope you're hearing me tonight but you try to make it work this way or make it work that way just play our part that he leads us to play don't worry about everybody else's part remember he said there's nothing out of cater well it's hard to swallow it but it's true there's nothing out of cater oh that makes some of us republicans because the republicans aren't in power right now we get we get upset when that's but there's nothing out of caterer god meant for it to be just like it is if there's insane people in power god put them there are you with me tonight well it ought to be this way or that way just just play our part the pharisees asked jesus for a sign and he told them he said the only sign they would get was the sign of the resurrection as jonah was three days and three nights in the whale's belly so shall the son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth don't have to deal with this because i've been asked this question and you might be asking it usually by someone who maybe would be critical of the scripture and they'll tell you well he jesus wasn't in the grave three days and three nights i mean you have ever thought about that or heard that question and so i want to deal with that before we move on three days and three nights now in the jewish mind in the jewish reckoning three days and three nights would be was reckoned so if any part of a day was a day any part of a night was it was any part of a day was a part of a day and a night and the day began at sunset not in the morning like ours does so he was literally there in the jewish thought three days and three nights now brother branham was asked this question though and he brings in a little bit deeper thought on it and begins to talk about the scripture and it's very important because how we look at the scriptures many times we look at one scripture and we're trying to make that fit but first of all there's things that we know but we have a question about something else well don't move the things you know or give up the things you know for the question to try to make the question fit does that make sense you move what you have a question about towards the thing that you know right and that's the way we study the scripture so we we want to look at what we know there's some things we know right and that's where people make a mistake in the message they begin to think well brother branham was the son of man but the randoms coming back and all this stuff was because they they've forgotten the things we know right the things we know and they tried to move what we know over to what we what they imagine but so what we know is and this is what brother branham taught us the prophet said i will not suffer my holy one to see corruption brother branham said it's within three days and three nights within three days and three nights he said because you can't make the scripture lie and the prophet said i'll not suffer my holy one to see corruption some of us legalists would have liked for him to be there three days and three nights and come out one minute later but corruption would have set in right so this scripture says i will not suffer my holy one to see corruption over here we see three days and three nights again you got to move this to fit with this and because we know that he can't see corruption now he said sometime within its corruption sets in the human body in 72 hours sometime within that three days and three nights that he must come forth from the grave so being three days and three nights don't mean it has to be exactly that sometime within that three days and three nights he had to come forth because the prophecy cannot be broken he could not see corruption it would have corrupted if he had stayed exactly that time he'd say well couldn't god have reversed the corruption well the scripture says in acts 2 31 that he he did not see corruption he said he's seeing this before spake of the resurrection of christ that his soul was not left in hell neither his flesh did see corruption so he the prophecy when it was fulfilled was fulfilled exactly like it should have been so we began to look at that then and he said this was a sign this was a sign are you still with me tonight this is a sign it's a resurrected body what is the proof of resurrection remember joe somebody come to you and and you'd put somebody in the ground and and as as a funeral director and you you'd watch them go into the ground and somebody come to you and said so-and-so's raised from the dead and you would say i preached on not too long ago it kind of sounds bad but show me the body right produce the body right let me see a living body of that person right so the the live body is proof of a resurrection right that's a body with life in it but not just anybody with any life right because if someone told you that i had raised from the dead if i was put myself i'll just use myself so i don't hurt anybody's feelings or or put anybody prematurely in the grave tonight but i'll just use myself if i something would happen and i passed away in the next few days and you guys had a great big funeral and wept and cried and everything like that like i know that you would and you'd be so sad that i passed away and then and then a few days later people start you start hearing rumors brother ben's got up he's resurrected he's not in the grave anymore well you'd probably be skeptical right the first thing you'd say well i know he was a christian but man we're supposed to be a general resurrection right and where's our other loved ones so you begin to question that and say well what is it and say well i saw him down at the pool hall he was down there shooting pool and and he was down there down there playing cards and he was alive though but that's where he was now what would you think i hope you know me well enough to know number one i'm not very good at pool and i don't never even use playing cards the real ones we we're christians you know we use the ones without any no dice or anything you know so this way i was raised so so we uh uh we you wouldn't expect me to be there you know use another example you say well brother ben's raised from the dead i know it said how do you know he was down there running the 100 yard dash wasn't him it's not the same life right if i had the kind of body to run a 100 yard dash i wouldn't do it then i wouldn't need to right what's the point if you're already skinny so so the point is you've got to be the same life right for in order for you to believe in a resurrection you've got to not only see life but the same life oh church how are people going to believe what we're telling them about a restoration message about a resurrected jesus christ about a son of man ministry if the church is dead and it's not what it was at the beginning but if the church is alive and it has the same life as it did at the beginning then it proves that he's alive amen hallelujah you all have been so good to preach to lately i almost don't want to let anybody else preach what is it proof of a resurrection oh i'm running out of time and i'm not barely into it now look a body with life the same life that went in the grave now in acts 1 3 it says that he showed himself alive after his passion or after his crucifixion by many infallible proofs infallible proofs being seen of him 40 days and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of god so the infallible proof was that he was alive and he was doing the things that he did before right so now he convinced them that's what that word means infallible proof convincing evidence that he was alive he convinced him he was alive by doing the same things he did when he was on the earth now if you take jonah and we'll go back and forth from him tonight but when you take jonah you see that jonah showed the sign of the resurrection to a gentile nation right the ninevites were gentiles and when christ was on the earth he knew the secrets and of the heart and some of you know where i'm going with this but we'll just go through it and so we get to the end in order he said he re he revealed himself to the jews by that sign uh you find that in john 1 47 he saw nathanael coming to him he said behold an israelite indeed in humans no gal daniel says whis knoweth thou me and jesus answered before philip called you when you were under the fig tree i saw you what was it proof of his messiahship no the jews would understand he'd done this before when elohim come and sat under a tree and told sarah what the thoughts of her heart was amen so now nathanael said rabbi thou art the son of god thou art the king of israel now watch it was nathanael who said that now jesus is much more direct with the samaritan woman and part of the reason i believe that jesus wasn't very direct with the jews is because they wanted to anoint him as a king they did not understand they were looking for a political messiah when he went to the samaritans he could be a little bit more free actually with who he was because the samaritans were not looking for a political messiah they were actually looking for a savior they were looking for someone to come and reveal all things because they were looking for moses prophecy of a prophet like unto me to come to pass because they only believed the books of moses they rejected david so now here was the samaritan woman in john 4 25 the woman saith in him i know that messiah cometh which is called christ when he has come he will tell us all things and jesus is much more bold with her he said unto her i speak to thee am he amen so now but again he showed the sign by knowing the secret of her heart now the samaritans rejected david but believed moses they weren't looking for a king but for a prophet like in deuteronomy 18 15 the lord thy god will raise up unto the prophet from the midst of thee that brethren like unto me unto him you shall hearken so now and i'm moving fast because i've got somewhere i want to go and i want to get there in as short a time as possible tonight but some of you people that like to pull preachers over for going too fast you're just going to have to be patient tonight and send me a ticket but i said look if that was the sign of the messiah for the jews it was the sign of the messiah when he was here on earth for the samaritans there's only one left for the sign that's the gentiles remember jonah prefigured that by going to the gentiles and coming out alive out of a wealth belly but the gentiles never had the sign of knowing the secrets of the heart remember there was even a gentile woman that come to him and he said it's not worthy to take the children's bread and give it to dogs and she ended up getting her healing but the sign of the messiah was never shown to her they weren't looking for a messiah we weren't looking for a messiah now now the jews were the samaritans were but it was never shown to the gentiles you can find the greeks that come looking for him and brother brown uses that over and over in his ministry sirs we would see jesus they come looking for him but what was it he never showed them the sign of the messiah because to the gentiles that would come later they saw healing but not the not the secrets of the hearts revealed now watch the sign was shown to the old testament in the old testament potentially that's the word brother branham used i don't have time for all of the quotes tonight but that is the word that brother branham used he said it was a potential sign of the messiah he said it happened one time for a few minutes for just a few minutes before the destruction he said it was a potential sign of the messiah as the son of man he said and and that uh now that happened in the days of sodom and the days of lot in luke 17 and 28 he said likewise also as it was in the days of lot they'd eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they build it but the same day the lot went out of sodom and rain fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed so now the son of man is going to be revealed again to the gentiles how many understand that tonight that's not new doctrine right that's something we believe the son of man is to be revealed again to the gentiles at the end time and show the sign of knowing the secrets of the heart but again the son of man the revelation of the son of man and again i could prove it to you with quotes but we'll get to a few but the son when the son of man is revealed that's more than just discernment but it's the opening of the word it's more than just discernment it's the opening of the entire book but but it does include that because there had to be a part of the body that represented that sign of the son of man and it was in a prophet it was god's prophet that he chose to do that now as it was in the days of lot the lord the bible says the lord appeared unto abram in the plains of mamrie he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day oh that's the kind of day and age that we live in in a labor to see an age he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day and we could go through it but he made elohim and flesh welcome he brought him under the tree and fixed something for him to eat and they said unto him in verse 9 where is sarah thy wife he said behold in the tent and he said now this is elohim in flesh he said i will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life and lo sarah thy wife shall have a son and sarah heard it in the tent door which was behind him now abraham and sarah were old and well stricken in age and it ceased to be with sarah after the manner of women therefore sarah laughed within herself saying after i am waxed old shall i have pleasure my lord being old also i wonder how many times we've sat in church and laughed within ourself at the promise of god and thought surely not me surely not me but god knows what you're thinking he still does tonight the word is the discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart and so the lord said to abraham wherefore did sarah laugh saying shall i have a surety bear a child which i'm old is anything too hard for the lord at the time appointed i will return unto thee according to the time of life and sarah shall have a son now brother branham and i'm going to pick up the quotes here for just a minute to to show you what i i want to want you to see tonight and brother branham picks this up he said the angel or the messenger the man with his back turned to the tent said why did sarah say that what was it now watch he said after the sacrifice was made he vanished he said now remember abraham called that man elohim how many readers know that now now watch who vanished after the sacrifice was made jesus christ right he's not talking here that was god wrapped in flesh there now there would be god in flesh at the end time a prophet don't let that stumble you because you're god in flesh right he was that prophet part of the body no one else can fulfill that part he was god in flesh right so are we the problem with the deity doctrine is not that they make brother branham god in flesh it's that they don't make you god in flesh right but that's why brother brown said it it's so close to the truth right now now watch now after the sacrifice was made he vanished he said now remember abraham called that man elohim he said that's right elohim that's almighty god in the form of a man he was the word because he could discern the thoughts god in flesh what does it testify that in the last days jesus said when the son of man is being revealed to his promised church he said the church that's not down yonder in babylon we got a babylon church he said you know that and denominations they're in babylon and we got a billy graham and oral roberts and him out there he said banging away at them too so in other words they're getting preached too god is right they're getting preached to but many of them is blinding their eyes right because that's the day and age that we live in and there's got to be many that are have their eyes minded and then go through the tribulation period and become the foolish virgin but there was one to the called out elected church aren't you glad to be a part of that tonight the elected church don't that make you feel special it ought to because you had nothing to do with that that was all god there was one who come to the elected church excuse me that was called that was showing the sign and begin to lose my voice i haven't done that in a while i'm a little bit excited about this tonight if you can't tell he said it was showing the sign that god was in flesh now watch you say i believe that brother ben i believe that god elohim came and tabernacled himself in that body there and stood in front of abraham and i believe that god tabernacled himself and william branham i believe that i believe that that was god in a measure and william branham i believe that that's wonderful but now look was the sign of the resurrection to be only in a prophet in this state was in jonah's day yeah sure right he was the body that was raised from the dead and come out it was in jesus day he was the body that was raised from the dead and come out but remember it didn't stay that way he was the wave sheath that was waved over them you remember at the end of the feast they waved the wave sheath and but then 50 days later they cooked amen the barley loaf and it come out at barley day of pentecost so now the son of man had distributed who he was all that god was he poured into christ all that christ was he poured into the church and now he's distributed himself in the church so from that time till this time the church the body is not a one body but it's a mini-membered body are you with me not that didn't change for a few years in 1960s and then come back right that's not what the son of man is it's a misunderstanding now the messenger gave the sign but the voice of the sign remember it was the messenger who gave the sign to abraham but where was the sign manifested it was in abraham's life it was in sarah's life that the voice of the sign was manifested in abraham and sarah's bodies i hope i'm not losing you i know it's a little bit deep tonight but i think i think you're we're mature enough we can we can grab a hold of something he said jesus was god in flesh it's a continuation of that same quote by the way he said and if jesus is in you tonight it's still god manifesting himself in the last days the son of man revealing himself in his church the human flesh making himself known he said you get it god down here in his church making himself again the word glory the son of man being revealed in the last days he said that was a prophet yes it was but he was part of the body amen so i have a part of the revealing of the son of man you have a part of the revealing of the son of man absolutely not that part because that was reserved for one man because it had to show that he had to do that in that body just like he did in his earthly body but that's part of the corporal of the the the body on earth the many membered body of christ so now he said the son of man being revealed in the last days says it wasn't the days of sodom again he said and jesus said as it was in the days of solomon so shall it be the coming of the son of man indeed he veiled again in human flesh he said over the men i believe that now watch he said now remember jesus didn't say when the son of god is being revealed he goes into that in luke 17 30 he said when the son of man is being revealed he said the son of man back in the church again notice where he puts the son of man he doesn't put him it's out here operating by himself but the son of man is back in the church again revealed in human beings not son of god but the son of man again back in his church again in the last days you realize what we believe by believing in the opening of the word and the revealing of the son of man now think about it you say well it's not important what you believe about that okay so if you don't believe that the opening of the son of man the opening of the word and revealing of the son of man has taken place and we're a part of it then you don't benefit from it and your body can't be changed that's pretty harsh but it's true because how could it because you the word's not open to you so you're waiting on the word to be open someday but the word is open now i believe that's what the message teaches i'm not trying to put anybody out but this is where we're at the word is open now that's why we have to come to this brother harvey there was a time we didn't understand these things but we had to come to this why because without coming to this we couldn't be abraham and sarah and have our bodies change are you with me tonight the son of man he said will be revealed in a body of flesh you just want to make it real plain you people yes sir this is one of the last sermons brother brandon preached you people the church you realize how seriously we ought to take this thing this isn't a you realize how serious brother branham took his ministry and and as serious as he was about it he told him when you come into this third pole ministry you've got to be more sincere he said more sincere to bind that serpent he said you've got to be more sincere than what you are now you realize how seriously we should take church how seriously we should take work how seriously we should take it this isn't the time to play around this isn't the time to take halfway measures this isn't the time to be halfway in and halfway out this is a time to be a believer but oh what a wonderful time it is what a wonderful time to be a believer to be assigned to your neighbors assigned to your friends assigned to your family a sign of the resurrection a revealing of the son of man hey man he said it said it's you people the church do we believe that tonight i wonder if we can grab a hold of that you see what's lacking is faith to be able to just grab a hold of that right we need that kind of faith to believe i'm i'm that i'm you people he might the people sitting there may not have understood it but when i heard him say it i'm you people amen you people the church just exactly like it was before the days of sodom a called out group away from all of them setting out believing the promise of god is that us tonight glory he said but he promised just before the coming of the end time the world would get like it was in sodom when a man come down in human form three of them two angels and god himself he said that was god the bible said it was he came down and he manifested himself there by turning his back to the tent where sarah was and told abraham what sarah was thinking in the tent he said now jesus himself said that that day at the day when the son of man is being revealed in other words the son of man the ministry of jesus christ himself the church will come through justification through luther through sanctification through wesley the baptism of the holy ghost and the pentecostals and go right on into the perfection of the son of man you realize that without this without the perfection of the son of man without an open book we're still in pentecost identified with pentecostal chickens hawks right hawks he said that there was a brother to an eagle should have flown higher but didn't right right but couldn't fly where the eagles fly because they weren't called to be eagles but that's where we identify ourselves when we are not part of that son of man ministry who would want to go back to being a hawk if you've been an eagle that's the thing they always were a hawk and so they could only fly so high and that's why they went back where they come from but for you and i we're not going back we are not of them who go back we are of them who believe amen aren't you glad for that tonight hey man he said and go right on into the perfection of the son of man he said that's when husband and wife will be the same self-persons oh god he said god will be so manifested into his bride his church so they will both be the same they are one he said now you see where we're at amen now you say well that can't be because brother branham was the son of man but the random was not the son of man we understand that they asked brother branham if he was the son of man and he wasn't just being humble he was a part of the son of man that makes sense part of the body but he was a son of man revealing the son of man he said some say brother branham is the son of man i thought the pillar of fire was the son of man am i mistaken he said well that's a good question very good but i am not the son of man but a son of man and yet there are churches all over the place still teach brother branham is the son of man and i don't know if you can't take what the prophet said plainly then you're just going to have to live with that i i can't help him if the prophet can't but that's just what it is he said this but a son of man there's quite a difference jesus christ was the son of man the son of god the son of man the son of david and brother brown goes on and explains the logos with the pillar of fire he said that wasn't the son of man either he said i'm not he i'm his servant and the pillar of fire is not he it's in spirit form which was upon the son of man and has come now to anoint sons of man amen to bring back a ministry just exactly like he said it would be you see how he always brings himself and his ministry back into the body of the church right he was a part of the body i'm glad we have a prophet in the body aren't you glad we have a prophet in the body we had to have a prophet on this day it wasn't enough it had to be a prophet to reveal the son of man to know the secrets of the hearts god had to have a prophet there had to be one but there was only one of those amen he said but now he said to bring back a ministry just exactly like he said it would be in order for the head and the rest of the body to connect together so again there was only one prophet fulfilling luke 17 30. one prophet and there were many anointed ones at the end time that come out and tried to mimic what that prophet did brother branham spoke about them he said that janice and james what stood moses the anointed word of the hour so will these men not man men anointed ones resist the truth you know how they do it and breaking from the quote for just a moment you know how they do that they do that by by saying that if you don't get with this you're going to miss it right well how can i miss what i already have again it's like i talked about the other day it's like someone coming to you and saying hey you're going to be late for the wedding you're going to be late you better hurry up i'm already married don't have to worry about being late for the wedding not anymore i had one day that i had to worry about being late for the wedding but now i'm the husband are you with me now now she's the wife we're the wife of jesus christ his wife has made herself ready that's the time that we're living in oh that ought to give us faith tonight to withstand any challenge the enemy would throw at us amen so now we we are the revealing of the son of man in in this hour not the part that he revealed but our part that's right now so as janice and james what said moses so here were these they say well you're missing something you're going to miss something you're going to miss something no they're anointed ones there was a son of man ministry there was a one-man ministry there was right not today i'm replaceable does that make sense god may use many pastors in your life to bring you where he wants you to be but only one messenger to the age he may use many evangelists to bring you where he wants you to be not only one messenger right he brought one messenger there was one one candlestick one lamp on each lampstand on the seven golden lampstands the the menorah that was there there was one lamp to each age that lamp that light has come and gone but what are we doing keeping it alive today we're carrying we're a part of that ministry but we're not that man we can't be that man and there won't be any others so you can't miss it if you accept what's already come so now they resist the truth he said in the very day that the son of man is revealed this is now watched they're resisting the truth by not accepting what's taken place he said on the very day that the son of man is revealed revelation 10 1-7 read it when you get home the seventh angel's message opening up the seals what is it not the angel is the son of man but the messenger is revealing the son of man he said can you get it separated now so that's where it seems to be so hard for you you see he said not the son of man himself but the seventh angel the seventh messenger is revealing to the public the son of man hallelujah because it's left the shock he can't organize it it's the grain itself again what's the grain we are he was just the first one you understand he was the first one but we're the grain again he said i wasn't the one that appeared down on the river and this is later on you can go and read what's in between but later on he said i wasn't the only one that appeared down on the river i was only standing there when he appeared i'm not the one that performs these things and foretells these things that happens as perfect as they are i'm only one that's near when he does it it was only a voice that he used to say it he said it wasn't what i knew it's what i just surrendered myself to that he spoke through it isn't me it wasn't the seventh angel oh no it was the manifestation of the son of man it wasn't the angel his message it was the mystery that god unfolded it's not a man it's god the angel was not the son of man he was the messenger from the son of man the son of man is christ you all know this quote as well as i do you could quote it with me but listen to it tonight he's the one that you're feeding on you're not feeding on a man you're not feeding on a man but his words will fail but you're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man glory more than a man if it was a man's ministry we could look back and critique it and run all the way through and say well we'll take this part and leave this part no we don't do that why because it was more than a man but god sent a prophet and he stood there while the son of man revealed himself why do you think it'll work any differently with you if the son of man is going to reveal himself through you as an as an elder in the church how's he going to do that you're just going to be standing there it's not what you know it's what you surrender yourself to oh god help me to realize that is the son of man going to reveal himself through me as a young person sister and only god he wants to reveal himself through you as a young person how is he going to do that some of you housewives how is he going to reveal himself through you as a housewife not by what you know not by what you can figure out but by standing there and surrendering to him feeding on the body word of the son of man and he just does it we were just there are you hearing me today we're just there he was that he fulfilled that part of a son of man ministry but we have a part as well what is that part defeat on the word until we become the word and he tells john go and prophesy again it's the son of man ministry the same ministry he just we've just fed on the body word of the son of man it's absolutely the case again you can't replace the prophet but you can't replace you either sister fritz may be watching tonight can't replace sister fritz i said i was replaceable as a pastor but not as an individual that ought to give us confidence tonight you may be replaceable as a deacon but not as an individual because god had you he knew you before the foundation of the earth right and that gives you confidence so we're replaceable in our offices because there's more than one right there's more than one person called to sit in there and look pretty in church more than one person called to to sit back and amen the preacher for a bunch of them well not the amen part but sit there anyway there's more than one called to do that but as an individual you've got a part in the body of christ in the revealing of the son of man that no one else has you're part of the body you understand there's others that will fill those roles if the church continues and some of us die off there'll be another generation step up there has to be because the son of man has to be revealed it's open now you can't put it back in the box you can't take the book and shut it back up it's already open he's already revealing himself people say well you shouldn't you shouldn't have church that way you shouldn't get get excited and worship how can we not worship when we're in worship time when the book has been opened when when the seals have been revealed when the son of man is revealing himself how could we not worship brother said everything is worship now we didn't get that because some pentecostal preacher hyped us up we got that because that's what a prophet said that was the revealing of the son of man he said well it's not that way anymore god don't work like that no more he don't want us to act like they did on pentecost but the son of man when he was revealed showed us that they staggered like drunk men we could you could take that to any doctrine of the message anything that we believe when the son of man was revealed i'm going to feed on that because the problem the reason why people don't show signs of life and resurrection because they've been feeding on the wrong things if you're feeding on the son of man you're going to show life amen hallelujah you're a part of it and profit in our day look jonah was the sign of the resurrection as i bring it down to a close jonah was the sign of the resurrection like gentile city jesus was the sign of the resurrection in his day a prophet in our day was a sign of the resurrection sure he was that's what he showed it in his own ministry revealed the secrets of the hearts not for a few minutes but for year after year decade after decade right thousands of times and i never missed showing the sign of the son of man and he thought at first even that it was a mistake watch brother branham as he grows through the 40s into the 50s i know you listened to tapes and you've heard this if you watch brother branham and the growth of his ministry in the 40s he says i don't he didn't really know which direction to go and he was laying hands on people the miracle line he knew that was a mistake to do it that way to try to force a miracle and so he moved on and he got in the second poll and he realized that well that that might be a mistake but look it's exactly where god wanted him to be just like moses he didn't even realize he was revealing the son of man maybe tonight you're in a position you think my life i can't see why i've done the things that i've done listen the prophet couldn't either but then later in his life he could look back and say we now have the perfect revelation are you with me now he didn't even know which way god would lead him neither do we jonah had no clue all he knew was he had been dead and he was alive yes amen now he was that prophet part of the body but we are also part of the body the ephesians 5 30 says we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones and i'll close with this but the brandon said if i can get myself out of the way so and william branham's not even thought of and you not even thought of we liked the first part he said if that was brother branham's job by the way was to get himself out of the way that's not our job to get william branham out of the way that was brother branham's job it's my job but i gave you getting myself out of the way he said if i could just get william branham out of not even thought of and you not even thought of till we can see jesus glorified among us see him that's our desire that gives us the quickening power and it gives us joy to know that we're already have joy tonight it gives us joy to know that we are with him both flesh and bone of him being the bride of him glory and seeing his same vindicated methods proving in us that he is now risen from the dead oh god jonah walked out of that trial and he was living proof musicians go ahead and come i'm over my time jonah walked out of that trial not knowing not recognizing what he was he was a manifestation of the resurrection of christ amen paul was the same when he said in galatians 1 15 he said it pleased god to separate me from my mother's womb and then he goes on to say and to reveal his son in me paul was a revealing of the son of man or the son of god we could say in that day he was a revealing of the son of god his resurrection from being a pharisee to being a preacher of the gospel to being a messenger of the age was a revealing of christ in his body our resurrection listen to me you've undergone a resurrection you were dead in trespasses and sin how many say amen to that tonight every one of us was but we've been washed we've been sanctified we've been cleansed by his blood but we were dead in trespasses and sin we've undergone a resurrection we came out of the belly of the fish we had seaweed wrapped around our neck but what does that make us he said well i've been through the trial of my life i know some of you have i know some of you've been through life-changing experiences that belly of a well is a life-changing experience oh god but just because you come through it don't mean god can't use you no more it may mean that the very reason god allowed you to go through it was to show a sign of a resurrection there was a person who lost their loved one but they still went to church they still loved god there was a person who went through all kinds of persecution there was a person who lost family and friends they were in the belly of a whale they were in the belly of a fish but they walked out of it on dry land there is a person god wanted to show something in you what is it the sign of the resurrection the revealing of the son of man in 2022 he's still brother joe revealing himself and you and me amen he's not revealing himself in profit form he's already done that but in pastor form in deacon form in housewife form that's part of the body [Music] trustee form or in sunday school teacher form or in person who sits and says or doesn't say amen in that form amen he wants to reveal himself in me like paul said then what should we do surrender ourselves to the trial that we're going through because when you get through it you're going to be pure as gold when you come out on the other side you're going to be your life is going to identify listen to me don't let the trials get so hard and the troubles get so deep that you don't realize you got a part to play but when the troubles are hard and the trials are deep you still have a part to play but the mark you've got a part to play in the body and revealing the son of man you've got a part to play don't get discouraged you say well i'm not in my office anymore i'm not doing this side of the other don't get discouraged today you that are watching if you're sick don't get discouraged because there is a revealing of the son of man god wants to do in your body to show these young people that god's still a healer he's still a savior amen you don't know what i've done brother ben you don't know what i've been through i don't know but i know this the son of man wants to reveal himself in you how can he do that it's not what you know it's what you surrender yourself to amen what will you do today do you believe it will you stand on it and say i am a resurrection side i am the sign of the resurrection they said where is the welsh revival the little policeman said i am the welsh revival amen i am the sign of the resurrection i am the revealing of the son of man i'm not that's not boasting that's just saying who i am that's necessary for me to get out of here one day aren't you glad for that aren't you glad he's already done it amen let's just worship him a minute that's all right give him a hand of praise oh and he worthy tonight oh let him reveal himself now while you sing amen [Music] and he wants to reveal himself in your voice reveal himself in your worship reveal himself in your life don't pass up the opportunity to let him reveal himself in you hey man let's stand together oh he he became me thank you lord so that i might hallelujah thank you lord jesus oh yes he thank you lord to my place [Music] thank you lord jesus [Music] do you know where those words came from you know those words come from us from christ is the mystery of god

inspired a preacher to write it down and make a song out of it aren't you glad that you're feeding on the body words of a son you're singing the revealing of the son of man oh hallelujah oh they're not like that ought to thrill us tonight and not just thrill us and make it all go out the whistle but to make us move again and get life into us as a church while we are the revealing of the son of man he became me so i could become him by grace he took my place so i threw his love today that's not my words that's the unfailing body word of the son of man believe it tonight while you sing it and
