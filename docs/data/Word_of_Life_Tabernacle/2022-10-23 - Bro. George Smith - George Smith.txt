when we go from here it could be said wasn't it good that he spoke to us along the way help us now in Jesus name amen you may be seated now I don't know how they think I'm a singer but at least we got somebody good on the piano um I tried to sing this morning and it was the first time I've ever sung acapella because I'm so old that they didn't know the song there came a sound from Heaven you know that song I guess it's C I don't know there came a sound from heaven like a rushing Mighty Wind it filled their heart their heart is singing and gave them peace Within the prophet gave promise the spirit will descend and from your inner being a river with no end sing with me for there is a river that flows from deep within and there is a fountain that frees the soul from sin and come to this water [Music] there is supply for there is the river that never shall run and this is most of us there was a thirsty who was drawing from a well her life was ruined and wasted her soul was bound bound forehead and then met my masters who told of her great sin and if you drink this water you'll never thirst for them there is a river that flows from deep within and there is a fountain that frees my soul from sin oh come to this water there is [Music] a river that never shall run [Music] that'll be all the music we're just thankful to be here I've been by here many times like many of you have been but today was the day to stop but I got on the wrong road and I went up you know the other way and I had to call for directions but um we're just glad to see all of you especially the newlyweds yeah congratulations sorry I couldn't be there you got a good one girl take care of him and uh I probably know most of you from years ago but we're here tonight to open the word and see what the Lord has for us so uh we're going to try to find our way through here let's look at some uh Psalm 143 to start with and um let's see here Psalm 143 verse eight if you'd like to stand in honor of the word that'd be good we've got three different places we're going to read from Psalm 143 to verse 8 causes me to hear thy loving kindness in the morning for indeed do I trust cause me to know the way wherein I should walk for I lift up my soul unto thee Deliver Me O Lord from mine enemies I flee into thee to hide me teach me to do thy will it's very important for thou art my God thy spirit is good lead me into the land of uprightness Quicken Me O Lord for thy name's sake for thy righteousness sake bring my soul out of trouble and of thy mercy cut off mine enemies and destroy all them that afflict my soul for I am thy servant and then a few pages over to the right proverbs 14. let's see here proverbs 14. and if you didn't bring your Bible shame on you Proverbs 14 and verse 12 there is a way which seems right to a man but the end of their they're over the ways of death so you might have a great idea and a great goal and but you better consult God oh yeah and then on over farther in the Book of Jonah and uh we'll find it here in a minute and Jonah in chapter one we see where it says now the word of the Lord came unto Jonah you know the prophet the son of Amite saying arise go to Nineveh that great City and cry against it for their wickedness has come up before me amen God bless you may be seated now I uh I carry this level for a reason that's for me to stay level not go off you know drifting up left or right yeah and you young preachers remember that uh it's also for you to have a visual because young people have to see things they can't just hear they got to see also but now it's got a secondary purpose some of you stayed up late too too late last night you didn't have any coffee today at lunch so if I see anybody drifted off did it it's been warned okay now Jonah our friend our brother prophet he was an Israelite okay Jewish prophet and he lived in a little town of called Geth Hepper just north of Nazareth up in Galilee it's the northern part of Israel now if any of you ever been there of course I see somebody that have been there but if you've never been there then you need to go you need to get your hands and your eyes and your feet on the land of the Bible how many would like to see your pastor go well that's that's enough there to pay his way I'm sure so now Jonah was the first foreign missionary okay yeah that's true nobody had been a foreign missionary before that God gave him instructions and a missionary is an apostle so they're in Ephesians 4. remember first apostles and Prophets okay so a missionary Apostles one that's sent out and even our Prophet said it's the highest calling so if we're going to bother to say what he said let's say all that he said yeah not just the parts that you like because if we take this little boy over to the cafeteria he's not going to get the broccoli and the beef he's going to get the chocolate yeah I was a little boy one time you know you were too right a long time okay so it's the highest calling and um the prophet says over here in uh end time yeah the end time it's called the end time 1954. I believe every Christian is obligated now not so much that you have to go over to the old country and preach but if you can't go help send somebody that can go yeah yeah so it all works together he says here everybody should hear the gospel at least once I want to do my part there's something about missionary work that I just love it these are his words yeah and just to know that what you're doing you're doing God's will when you're giving to missions that's pretty simple formula isn't it sure now let me just interest intersect something here um there was a church it was still there but a church over in Oklahoma they 'll come to the message they were small about 30 or 40 people and they bought this little catholic church nice little red brick building you know about third the size of this here and so it started growing and so they needed to build and have a bigger church so they started shopping and they um uh they saw this one Baptist Church for sale so they go over to check it out and um uh I was a Baptist anybody else was a Baptist here well it's okay we're not going to condemn you so in the Baptist Church we had a little thing on the wall you know that said uh last Sunday we had 200 this Sunday we had 220 and they give the offering in the last year ago we had these many okay so they're going on a Tuesday and they're they're checking out this church see if they want to buy it and they see where that you know they had say 300 people and they had a offering of six thousand dollars well that never happened any you know anybody we ever knew and so the brother asked the Baptist pastoral how in the world that happened well that was a missionary offering we do that twice a year but he said if you come here during service you'll find very few new cars in the parking lot if you go to our people's house you won't see a lot of stuff see we teach our people to live you know a little more humble so that when somebody does come by or they feel a need to help they can actually do it not just sit there I wish you know and so that's what brother Brandon's talking about when you're when you're given to missions you're in God's will yeah now the title I forgot my will or God's will something that you've got to face every morning when you get up I'm not going to go the way I want to make another thousand dollars or am I going to seek God's per you know personal will yeah and so you know Brethren preached about missions he was a missionary he went he did a lot of work over there so missionary work is not simply traveling to some hot place or it's sticky and bugs and they don't speak your language and your food and all that no it's not just that yeah although it is he's but you see missionary work is living for others right here yeah I'm all right living for others now when you see somebody in need you don't just say well God bless you no take him to lunch do you need tires some way we can help you the early church which that's a whole other study which we were into this morning but helping each other okay yes so everybody wants eternal life right nobody here would argue about that everybody wants to go to heaven yeah they just don't want to go today maybe tomorrow or you know next week but um because you know when you die it's it's Eternal separation from God if you're not ready yeah so um we do have a lot of things trying to say here tonight and how much time we got it's only quarter to four great take your time McDonald's closes at 10 right that's right okay so we're covering [Laughter] 1960 a day on Calvary he was one man the perfect man he gave his life he made an example for you now what must we do the first thing I want to say he said here Jesus never lived for himself his life was spent for others that's perfectly eternal life okay when you say you go to church and you're good that's fine when you live your life to yourself you don't have or you're not expressing eternal life eternal life is living for others it proved it when he was in the lamb as uh when he came as the Lamb of God he lived and had eternal life because he did not live for himself he lived for others and you receive eternal life by receiving that day on Calvary and you don't live for yourself no more you live for others so I was born in a missionary family now we're not going to get into that whole to our testimony but it's good that's another service but um I was born in a missionary family I I learned early on what it is to live for others do without because these people need and so as time progressed and here we are you know that's late in the day living for others is in fact where the satisfaction is and uh my focus now as I was explaining to the people this morning is uh the people in Venezuela now I don't know if you have seen the news or you you know read or anything but Venezuela is very very bad off they have more oil in the ground than Saudi Arabia has proven Reserves but they have not they have not kept the infrastructure up so they can't refine it they're bringing gasoline from Iran it's insane yeah so because why are that that way because they are they're geared to socialism socialism has never worked although their basis in book of Acts yeah helping others well they help themselves first you know but socialism has never worked anywhere and they hate hate hate Israel well you're going down yeah because the Bible says I will bless those and bless thee and I will curse those that curse me yeah real simple formula this isn't complicated I mean you understand right little boy and so because of that since 1999 they've gone down down down well today uh their their money is completely worthless it's not even worth the dirt that it's you know it's four thousand percent inflation when our inflation goes up a half a percent everybody gets nervous yeah yeah so then they go to the dollar which they only get from drug money and it's at two thousand percent inflation so grocery some more everything's more everything's more and then when you go to check out the grocery store they had 17 percent well how can you live like that so a lot of people are doing okay because they're connected with the government they're connected with the military but we're helping those that don't have any way to help we're just trying to keep a roof over their head and help their car work and be sure they have groceries that's the missionary work that we're involved in currently and it's um it's very needed now just across the river in Colombia this first world country they're friends with Israel they're friends with the us but Venezuela is not and Venezuela is about three times the size of Texas and a lot of people left they used to have 30 million people that was their population seven million have left some got on a plane went to Spain to Uruguay to Paraguay to Chile to every place some didn't have money to fly so they start walking oh yeah now between between uh South America and Panama there's 60 miles of mud and mountains and drug dealers and all kinds of bad situations people have died they're just just trying to walk out you know so it's you can't even imagine how horrible it is but anyway those are the people who are trying to help and um we're trying to also to print messages for them some of these people have never seen a book in five years yeah can you imagine yeah yeah and so we print the books in China they come to Columbia they come across country they come across the river and they're getting books and they're happy you know so all these things are going on and we're only sharing it with you so that you know what we're doing you know we're not sitting at the beach we're not sitting you know in the mountain cabin someplace okay back to our brother Jonah the First Missionary he had a command from God go preach to the enemy their wickedness has come up before me I can't stand it anymore go preach repentance you God uses men yes okay that's right simple but there's one problem Jonah was Jewish and the people in Nineveh were gentiles very serious segregation excuse me they still have segregation today now in our glorious country some of you are old enough to remember when we had you know such now the integration hasn't worked out too well brought a lot of problems but anyway they had segregation and so they were out of balance Nineveh was the capital of Assyria currently would be Northern Iraq uh very Wicked sinful people very cruel violent city of over 120 000 people and it was a very large city took three days to walk around it and these Assyrians were constantly tormenting and oppressing the Israelites just like today because the twins always there you see and so God is sending his Prophet right into the jaws of danger uh to face the enemy go cry against it it was time for repentance okay God always sends warning before judgment right he doesn't just blast it gives you a warning you know and um in uh in Israel when Jesus was there he was nice he went around preaching Healing The Sick and so forth but there was three towns that just couldn't get with the program you're familiar and he just blasted him okay life went on like nothing happened 60 years later the earthquake came and destroyed those places now since 1948 when they started rebuilding Israel they're they're rebuilding each Village everything's you know trying to get it back the way the Bible says but those three places are a pile of rocks because Jesus condemned them and over there they'll tell you the reason because Jesus condemned it you better believe the Bible you know okay so in our country uh we had a prophet and he traveled everywhere preached everywhere but the West Coast just couldn't get with the program they just rejected and so you know God's cup gets full blasted just like Capernaum you will sink time goes by people over there look I know I know people just like you people they're Believers over there there's probably 10 churches on the West Coast you'd think they would hear the same thing we hear I don't know anyway our Prophet said it'd be a not just a couple of you know yards or no three to four hundred miles wide 1200 miles long that's a pretty big chunk yeah and there's going to be no recovery FEMA or no president nobody can solve that it's going to be bad now why is it important to us over here in 2022 because First Corinthians 10 all these things happen to them for examples and they're written for our admonition that we might learn upon whom the ends of the world are come Paul had to know that the end of the world was going to be a ways off but he had to write it in a way that they would get serious we're the ones upon whom the ends of the world have come you see we're the end time generation and the end of the ages is at the door so the world is falling apart yeah Jesus said when these things begin to happen you don't get involved and try to you know join this and no look up it's finished right look up Redemption is drawing an eye so once again we have a message of warning before judgment and uh the message is real simple it's not complicated you don't have to read all the books you don't have to know the Bible it's real simple repent or perish with the unbelievers you have a choice tonight so you can choose and um so we need a shaking we don't just need another cute sermon and let's go out and talk about the football game no we need a shaking shake off the shackles of sin the the attitude of no concern who cares we need to trimming a cutaway of the no interest and the idolatry it's everywhere yeah now some of you don't like to hear that but it's true so we're far beyond an aspirin or Alka-Seltzer and a little pat on the back you know you're going to be okay you're not going to be okay you're going to hell when you got to cut away that stuff see we need major surgery not another sermonette so we can't afford to keep playing Church Hebrews 13 8 wasn't just for William Branham it's for everybody okay so in John 4 20 if a man says I love God in first John 4 20. if I if a man says he loves God oh yeah but he hates his brother for whatever reason he's a liar for that he that loveth not his brother whom he can see how can he say he loves God whom he hasn't seen so however we treat each other believer to believer it doesn't matter what you what you know what color what they do no believer to believer however we treat each other that's how we treat God okay now you might never ask me back but we're going to give it one shot while we're here and um so God is watching our reaction to every test he will give you tests he will put you through the grinder but he's watching for reactions and you see uh he could solve everything before the sun goes down you probably won't because this test is going to go on he's going to take the people out of here and um but he's watching for our reactions to the test we're not going to have a president that's going to solve everything if everything was great in Washington we wouldn't want to leave here you know we have all that stuff so that we want to get out you see and so he's watching for our reaction okay back to Jonah he was God's man of the hour and that he had a clear-cut decision from God a commandment from God go cry against their sin and their corruption I know all about the segregation I know your fears I know your doubts go anyway so there was no there was no maybe no go come on okay Jonah 1 and verse 3. but oh we got a problem but but Jonah rose up to flee where tarshish we're going to show you in a minute where that's at from the presence of the Lord and he went down to Joppa found a ship going to tarshus so he paid the fair went down into it to go with them unto tarshish from the presence of the Lord second time in case you missed it the first time bad boy sounds really bad right it's gonna pan out here after a while don't worry and so um he wasn't just anybody this is God's man of the hour God's Prophet God's mouthpiece you see and um he did not break relationship he's still God's man still God's Prophet but he broke Fellowship okay brother Branham himself said anointed prophets make wrong decisions they're humans brother Brandon was born a prophet now you might not like that but it's true but then you know he was in love with this girl and then the Mother-in-law got involved and all that and so he made a decision oh well I'm sorry well okay if you say so then I won't go and today the river in Louisville is one mile wide okay but because of this man's decision God sent judgment and at that time January of 37 the flood came from the North and the river was 200 miles wide that swept a lot of stuff away you never know how many people all because one man's decision be careful Okay so he goes he should have gone one way he went the other way and um he goes down to the to the coast and he finds the ship going to tarshas we're going to find out no matter where that's at but um he um he bought a ticket on this boat now these boats were all wood um they were probably some of them were 100 feet long and They Carried 300 tons of grain from the Middle East to Rome and other places because that's where they raised the grain the people up there waiting for it so these Merchants were very careful to go when there was good weather they didn't have you know cell phones they couldn't find out the weather they knew certain terms certain times that it was good to go so anyway they take off because this is what it it's what they do so he they go and all of a sudden the storm comes up now they get serious I mean you read it all see I'm not going to read you the whole chapter you got to go home read it and so they start pitching out the grain they start pitching off the stuff they don't need because they don't sink the boat and they start praying to their gods nothing happens and Hey where's that tourist we took on here come up here and so he's down there asleep you know and um so he sees what's happening in his look guys I know exactly what the problem is if you'll throw me or reward problem solved yeah well that's easy enough we don't need you anyway now God is a God he knows the whole story see he knows where you're going to be tomorrow at 3 30. he knows all things and so he had this special face we're not arguing about what his name is but fish was swimming right alongside of the boat just waiting for lunch there's right along and all of a sudden here comes the prophet barely got wet went right into right into the fish okay and um but in the meantime while Jonah was on the boat he tried to act like nothing's wrong now he didn't have his Prophet suit on he didn't have his little label you know Elder so and so like people we know um he was just he was just a tourist you know so he's going along and he um let me turn this phone off I'm sorry it happens sometimes you know um he was he was just going along and um he wanted to to pretend like he was just nobody but uh just kind of like Peter back in the garden you know of uh Gethsemane he acted like nothing was going on snuck in there like you know yeah but he was out of place he knew he was wrong you know and so so here's Jonah just kind of I'm just a tourist they found out who he was and so he comes along there and tried to act like the like the rest of them but um so the Lord prepared the great fish swallowed Jonah because with John with with God there's no surprises okay it was a special fish and Jonah could live inside this special fish okay now when he gets in there now opening up you got a weak stomach but the point is when he got into the fish it's dark okay there's no lights in there so he can't see eyes don't work uh he had the miracle was that there was oxygen he could breathe you know he learned to keep his mouth shut real quick smell was bad enough so he's down there he got seaweed you know couldn't see symptoms everywhere seaweed and so forth so the next time you think you got problems whatever your little problem might be think of Jonah he had problems he was God's man why is he in this condition because he made a wrong decision okay and so he had plenty of time to reflect on the decisions of verse 3 away from the presence of the Lord so he closed his eyes he said this these symptoms are all lying vanities I will get out of this mess I don't know when God please hear me so he was very much alive he could touch he could taste couldn't see he could hear he could smell and God supplied oxygen and he got serious about praying now he didn't have a Bible he didn't have an iPad didn't have an iPhone only what he had stored he had read he knew what God's word said and he got serious about praying okay and um so here he was with some unforeseen circumstances and um we have people you probably know some of them well I thought it was gonna be different when I you know come to the Lord and join this nice Church all you nice people I thought it was going to be different than this yeah you know because according to my calculations and what I figured out we don't care what you figured out let's go back to see what the Y the word says you know and so like Solomon said you know it's all vanity so the symptoms are very real he had to ignore his present reality and focus his mind on the word of God that he had stored in his memory no computer no nothing and he got serious and so he didn't know how long it was going to be you know God didn't tell him okay you're gonna be here three days so he could have almost held his breath for three days but he didn't know how long okay so he got serious praying now the prophet says the devil's Tremble When the weakest of saints goes to their knees what a power and a privilege has been given to the Church of the Living God when you follow your knees in prayer even the Devils tremble to the weakest of them and the devil isn't deaf you don't need to scream he knows exactly what's going on he says here and the weakest Christian here tonight can defeat Satan anywhere any place any time under any condition with thus saith the Lord just believe it because God said so you got to take it for you you see yes so why was Jonah in this situation you see apparently we gotta put that word in there apparently he had shirked away he had evaded his duty he had apparently run from responsibility ran from the presence of the Lord ran from the will of God opted for his own will you know and only the fellowship was broken not the relationship so every one of us had to make a decision to be here we could be somewhere else could be a lot of places but you chose to come here and so Jonah made a choice he was willing to pay the price go his own way he just didn't have any idea how high the price was going to be you know he paid five dollars for his his little bed there but much higher price and um so if we're here in Hardy and so God tells you to go to uh St Louis well I think I'll go to Dallas instead opposite direction and that's what that was Nineveh was in One Direction and tarshus was over here and and besides that the the fish you know they they have you know pretty much one speed and so he's got this guy and got this profit in his belly he's at the bottom of the ocean he's resting okay and um so he probably thought well you know there's a lot of sinful people down in Tarsus I'll just go over there and preach God will bless the word no problem not so much opposition and God would have blessed him but um you know the prophet says over here in thirsting for life now these are important quotes because he is identifying things that we go through and this great Pillar of Fire the angel of God the logos that went out from God that led the children of Israel through the Wilderness when it came amongst the people it separated itself and great licks of fire began to come down on each one of them as the pillar of fire began to break up God dividing himself amongst his people okay that ought to tear the heart out of anybody God tearing himself apart that he might divide himself a little bit into each one of us he says now can you see why I'm standing for the unity of every church now that's not the question mark That's a comma there yeah yeah okay pay attention can you see why I'm standing for the unity of every church every Full Gospel Church every believer yeah we're standing for the unity of the Believers not all these churches I mean there's lots bigger churches probably prettier better whatever but this is where God wants you you know so we ought to be of one heart one mind one Accord no matter how much we differ in the scriptures and we do now I love brother Ben but I guarantee you if I live next door to him we'd find something to argue about he's a nice guy but you know I probably eat different I probably like different coffee whatever I like Dale but you know he's Dale I'm George we tried to live together um so he says we might differ in the scriptures or you know our favorite quotations um that might be one might see it this way that has nothing to do with it but in principle we have to stand one Great Mighty Army of God marching on because each one of you in your peculiarity now brother Branham had a seventh grade education he loved to read but I've spent over 50 years working with his words to put him into Spanish yeah I'm a translator and so when a new word shows up like that it's obvious each one of us in our peculiarity God has proved that he's ignoring your doc oh God's ignoring your Doctrine I thought that's what was important what can I have it right God is a he's ignoring your Doctrine because he gave you the Holy Ghost and the Bible said he gave the Holy Ghost to them that will bait him that's acts 5 32. now if I obey him in my peculiar way and you obey him in your your peculiar way he gave us both the Holy Ghost so we ought to be Christian Brethren and sisters enough to arm up together that's not single file people arm up together is like this make a sweep we have to be Christian brothers and sisters enough to arm up together and March on for one great purpose the gospel that's why it's encouraging to me to hear brother Ben talk about Egypt I talk about South America and other places we're trying to find that last eagle just like some of you you didn't know you was an eagle until you wow look here the word says and you came alive well there's people out there waiting to find out who they are so you see but unto us has been revealed the mysteries of the Kingdom you see okay God has a perfect plan and so God does not hold those people out there accountable over here at the Presbyterian Church Church of God all he doesn't hold them accountable for what you know you see he's trusted you with the secrets the fullness of the revelation so he has a perfect will and a permissive will remember that and you have a choice Jonah had a choice my will or God's will so the prophet says over here in 1965 we try to work on God's permissive will and he will permit it but also if we take his permissive will though it's not right he will make his permissive will work out together to glorify his perfect will so there's hope but there will be a price to pay another place he says we must submit ourselves to his will and to his word don't question it believe it don't try to find a way around it just take it the way it is so many wants to go around get some other way and when you do you find yourself going on you'll find God blessing you but you're working on his permissive will and not his perfect Divine will so people ask me all the time Brother George how could I know God's perfect will you know there's a young man here with a red shirt on what's God's perfect will is it that girl over there is it stay at home what should I do you know well that's a good question you got to find God's perfect will okay it's a real simple formula God's word God's spirit and God's will always run in parallel they never cross each other they're never one going one way no they always go the same direction in parallel they agree you see just like these musicians they have to play in the same key it doesn't work because you know uh one wants to be and F sharp and wants to be an A Minor it doesn't work got to be the same in harmony you see so some people have a portion of the word memorized to the very letter and they'll know when you left out of the OR at or whatever and they'll hammer on that yes sir yes sir and that's all they know yeah those are brother once he traveled someplace and and after the service somebody met him outside said you know you said such and such well he couldn't remember exactly what they're talking about so what did I say before that kind of get the bearings you know I don't know what did I say after I don't know well it's a good thing you heard the mistake because you've got nothing and so they've got the very you know things memorized to the letter but their wires are crossed and they display a contrary spirit that there's no harmony with the rest of the word bad fruit results are contrary to the word and so John in John chapter 4 Jesus told the woman at the well God is seeking those that will worship Him in spirit and in truth that's why we carry the level his spirit and in truth got to be level it can't be all Spirit you know tear the house down while the music's plan can't be all you know legal it's got to be balanced it's got to work together I don't see anybody sleeping yet I'm looking okay so they asked brother Branham the question how do you feel is the best way to find the Lord's will in some important matters well all of our matters are important right he says I'll tell you dear friend the best way to find the will of God in some important matters is prayer oh we already knew that I mean that's what Naaman thought oh me getting that water are you kidding you know he knew he had better water at home okay so prayer that's one here's the way I do it I take it before the Lord and it's always been my strength I wait upon the Lord see what he says and I just let myself be neutral but see when you want something it's very hard to be neutral when you want the fried chicken and they're closed hold it down you know so you got to pray you gotta be neutral okay where are we at and uh and don't take either side so if I was in your place and didn't have these visions of course you know he was a bit handicapped that way he knew him had a little better Advantage um I would suggest to the Lord and say Lord now you show me what's the decision to make and then the way you feel led then wait wait are you kidding hey we're 21st century Christians we don't wait planes are leaving every night we can go somewhere you know and so yeah wait yeah and then wait just a little bit and then wait a little bit longer oh and see which way the Lord leads and say now father you know in my heart it doesn't matter but I want to know what you want to do about it that's how you find God's perfect will for whatever matters are in your life okay so with Jonah um God did make his permissive will turn around to accomplish his perfect will the special fish delivered him on the shore and God reminded him once more now I'm sure if you've been around this message very long you've heard Brethren tell the story how that you know the people in Nineveh worship the god of the sea and so here comes the fish it sticks his tongue out and Prophet walks out and they believed well listen again he says I read that in a book Prophet didn't preach out of the word he read in the book sounded good made a good drama but the word says over here in chapter 3 verse 1 says and the word of the Lord came again it came the word of the Lord came unto Jonah the second time saying arise go to Nineveh that great City and preach unto it the preaching that I bid Thee Well if he's there it wouldn't be saying that so Jonah's in the belly of the whale three days three nights he's completely covered in you know what now I'm sure that brother Dale could tell you stories about making these long trips and you know some of these little kids ate too much candy or something a lot of cleanup well here's Jonah he's completely covered in vomit and the whales had enough and he lands in the sand and he's rolling in the sand oh he's a total mess he's got to go down to Car Wash and get cleaned off you know and get some clean clothes and God says now get over there where I told you no more of this fooling around go where I told you and um and so um see he had a second chance you might not have a second chance God tells you to do something you don't dilly-dally around you don't vote on it just go and do it now a simple example was a long time ago uh 1955 they made the movie of The Ten Commandments I'm sure everybody's seen at least part of it it's a four-hour movie well some people at the Tabernacle in Jeffersonville snuck off and saw it and then they come back and they told the brother Branham hey you know it's a great movie you ought to go see it so he takes his wife it's him and his wife and his daughter Rebecca that I know of so they go down to New Albany it's a theater about size this church small theater you know they didn't have the big ones like they got today and so he's sitting there and um and they showed this movie well you know on the film The all of a sudden the pillar fire comes rolling onto the screen well they did such a good job he thought it was a real thing took his hat off oh just a movie okay so he sits down well so they see they sit through this whole movie and Rebecca would have been about nine years old at the time and so they're going home it's late she's crying she's very sensitive child and he says well honey what's the matter you know went to the movie yeah but Dad you know to her it was like a newsreel and she said now Moses you know he said all this on the Lord's Side come here so you know the words and so we're watching people coming here well she's watching these people sit over here kind of waiting for something and she said God's not fair and those people they were thinking about it they were trying but they didn't knew fast enough see and so he said well let this be a learning moment here when God tells you something you move you don't wait and see if everybody agrees and this and that no get with it so that's what what Moses here or what uh Jonah he uh he got a second chance you see so after he got cleaned up then uh he went and preached very powerful anointing chapter 3 verses 5 through 10 records the reaction to the preaching of the word it was one of the greatest if not the greatest Revival in recorded history the entire city of 120 000 turned to God and held back the Wrath they had a choice repent or perish with the unbeliever only got 47 pages left this week but guess what about 150 years later they entirely departed from the from the plan of God they forgot all about what happened back there 150 years ago and um they forgot about the Forgiveness of God and God allowed the Babylonians to come in in the year 621 BC and utterly destroy the city now they didn't have bulldozers that didn't have Dynamite I don't know what they did but they utterly destroyed the city okay so devastating was the destruction that their ruins weren't even discovered until a little over 100 years ago oh here's where Nineveh was yeah we'll check it out 2500 years later and so such hatred to destroy Scofield even says such is the way of God light rejected brings destruction and that's what's happened to our country the prophet gave him a choice 1956. now you know this this year and it preached it everywhere yeah yeah okay things started turning everything looked good I mean people remember back in 57 59 beautiful cars everything was lovely okay the clock was turning and so we've lived long enough now to see the results of that decision back there it's coming down it's going down you see and so God always warns first so Jonah was in fact a very crucial part of a larger picture Okay so much so that it's repeated in the New Testament by our Lord in Matthew chapter 12. so when you don't fully understand something that's going on in this church or across town or wherever when you don't understand be careful the word says Be Still In other words I'm gone I gotta figure it out don't need your chicken brain you know ideas be careful whatever is happening could be part of a bigger picture that God's allowing to play out I'm sure in the time of Jonah whatever Believers there were well hey I thought God told you to go that way you know there must have been some some confusion back then you know and so when something is happening you don't understand just be careful because it could be part of a better bigger picture and God is allowing things to work out but he's watching your reactions you see be careful God has not called me he's not called anybody I know to straighten things out no he's in charge you see and he knows how to put things in order so it would seemed that God's man God's prophet of the age God's anointed messenger he would seem that he was backslidden that he stepped out of the will of God it would seemed that way because we as Mortals with our small brain you see um we're such small creatures we don't have all the facts we don't know all that was going on back then we just have the story here and God worked it around and it worked out but we would have well we would have condemned him he would have never we would never let him preach in our church you know yeah man look what you did over there and so we don't have all the facts and we make up these uh you know knee-jerk reactions when we have partial information so watch out be careful see and uh very few people of Any Given generation recognize the value of the message of the hour that they live in hindsight is much better than you know current side we have in the New Testament we have Simeon that lived near the temple in other words you live right next door and he was old and God said to him now looks at me I know your old son and um but you're not going to die until you see the consolation of Israel now we don't know what sign God showed him to look for but he said watch for this sign so every um every day that they had the dedication of babies maybe it was Thursday whatever it was he would go out and he'd look no sign go back to bed this went on for a long time but one day he's out there oh there's the sign whatever it was that God showed him and so he goes over to uh to Marion and Joseph so only Mary and Joseph and Simeon knew what was going on the rest of them had no idea and they weren't dressed different okay they all dressed pretty much the same he says can I hold the baby well sure and so he prayed to the Lord that thy servant depart in peace my eyes have seen the salvation of Israel he was holding a baby but God showed him okay it's gonna get a little tough here so put on your seat belts questions and answers 1957. this city which could be Hardy but in Jeffersonville this city at the day of judgment will answer great price someday for there have been hundreds and hundreds of outstanding healings done right here um signs and wonders the appearing of the Angel down at the river and so forth um and still people don't believe it why is it someday I'm going to leave here and that's clearbank 57. someday I'm going to leave here I'm 48 years old why didn't people recognize that picture why didn't they catch that right quick why didn't they catch these other things why don't they catch these prophecies and things he says you know they can't do it now but one day I'm going to leave this world and when I leave they will recognize it some of you young people will realize that after I'm gone this day this has been fulfilled another place 1964. what did the lutherans do after the death of Martin Luther good question they met Satan and made a denomination and died never done anything else after that it's just became a great mass of people two tapes you need to listen to as soon as you can the world falling apart and the the uh anyway there's two of them right there in April of 63 in Albuquerque New Mexico so in world falling apart he says you might not believe that but this is taped listen to it a few years from today if there is such then you'll know whether it's true or not one day when the evening lights are breaking it's too late then you'll say that man could have been right but it's too late then it's just exactly like Jesus said when he was here on Earth quote God sent you prophets down Through the Ages um and what did you do with each one God sent you the prophet you all put him in the grave in other words you killed him exactly and then in about another generation you woke up and you realized that was a prophet and then what did you do you garnished the tomb what did you do he made a tradition of his life all through history that's the way it's worked it says here and that's exactly what Israel had done Moses they made a tradition of his life and that's the way we do with Martin Luther John Wesley and other men huh I wonder who those other men could be says here we're always looking back making a tradition of their life garnishing the tomb and their messages for another day by the time you wake up that day is live by we're in another day the whole system has worked that way since the beginning man-made systems certainly so we got to get serious his brother Adam's life is going to be an exception to this rule it's always been this way I don't think so we're seeing people today making a tradition not a life-changing decision so when we don't understand something don't have all the facts yes Lord whatever you say be careful okay so Jonah was God's prophet he was human he looked for the easier way no pressure people to agree with him and um pat on the back and many times God will indicate to us his will yeah you need to do this or that but what do we do we go discuss with the relatives we take a vote or what do you think Mom and what do you think Grandma and all this stuff you see and so we look for the easy way like Jonah did brother Brown says you have to struggle to do the will of God sometimes so it's not always easy but it will produce the best results so today we have many Believers now we call them Believers I call them book carriers a lot of book carriers only God knows which ones are believers you know so we've got a lot of book club book carriers they're willfully their own will getting onto other boats that are not the ship of Zion they look like it but see Jonah he went 180 degrees opposite we got people just two degrees off but two degrees off you're not gonna hit the target you're gonna miss it and it just gets wider and wider and when it's too late oh this this blue is not going the right direction after all you can't go across you got to come back where you started you see real simple okay so we can have a leading we can have a Doctrine uh we can have a promise right out of the pages of the Bible but if it's not in the proper season flowing in the economy in the plan of God for the hour now why do we say that hey there's all kinds of promises that you know there's the there's there's the ark that uh the Noah Bill we're not building Ark today that was for that time we're in another time got to know the season the day that you're living it and what God has for that time so if you're if you're not careful you'll be fighting the will of God you'll be fleeing from the presence of the Living God thinking and believing you're right yes but you'll be choosing your will not God's will having wrongly divided the word of Truth and there's a price to pay so how dark is it laodicea is very dark now it's hard to believe when we all got a cell phone we got you know nice fifty thousand dollar car all these nice things we have but it's dark spiritually now you might not have heard this before but I'll share it with you a long time ago 1959 brother Brandon was preaching in the islands of the Caribbean and so he um was down there for several weeks and there were some Americans with him in the party and so one of the brothers years later said yeah I spent four hours with brother Brennan one day down there and he said we were talking about my family they were talking about a lot of things and she said so I asked him why do you say so much about 1977 I see it doesn't seem very important now because it's way back but back then it was important and so brother Brandon said well the reason I said what I said about 1977 is because when I was looking through the stream of time so he's seeing numbers uh he said when he got 1977 it was so dark I didn't say any believer could live in such Darkness yeah that was 18 years before now we're over 40 years the other side so you figure out how dark it is okay let's see if we can cut some of this down so if we turn our back on the word okay maybe not openly but just by indifference just by a bad attitude look at look at the look at the John the Baptist's dad Ezekiel is that his name Zechariah yeah um he he had a a job in church maybe he was just maybe run the vacuum whatever he was doing and the angel appeared now he was there every day and and he was getting older and I sure wish I had a son so the angel of God Appears you're going to have a son he showed just a little bit of indifference not screaming and holler just a little bit of a bad attitude because of that you're not going to talk for nine months but you will have a son so we could we could we could turn our back on the word like that we'll be fleeing from the presence of God we'll be following an antichrist Spirit Antichrist Doctrine and soon you will be Anointed with arrogance with selfishness self-righteous respective persons none of that comes from God you're fooling yourself great you see so if we deviate just one degree from Center we won't hit the target you Hunters know that you see we don't have to be 180 degrees off like like Jonah no so you know like Mary and Joseph remember them they were they'd been down to the temple they go down there every year so they go down Jesus about 12 years old they could have been down their first bar mitz but we don't know they were Jewish okay and so they're down there and uh families there so they're getting ready to go home now back to Nazareth a few miles and so they get to the end of the first day and they're setting up camp and Mary says uh uh Joseph uh where's the boy well I don't know it was your day to watch him they walked off and left the promise of the day don't you know they had a ugly night that night because it's dark they can't go back now so the next day they go back and finally they find him but even then and the word is so full of details normally a Jewish mother would say oh you know Jesus have you had anything to eat here let me get you something you know it was all about me why did you do it made me look so bad you know yeah it's right there in the Bible so they went off in the Land of Make Believe thinking he was with them you know leaving behind the promise of God for the hour and many are doing the same thing today be careful recognize the day you live and what God has for you today and get with it okay so let's see we got a lot of things to say here but we better cut it back um so the thing is we need to look around be sensitive your surroundings be sure he's with you get in your get in your Bible if you read your Bible what is I think it's 12 minutes every day you'll read it through in in a year on your phone everybody's got a cell phone it's got the schedule right there read these chapters you can't go wrong I know some of it might be boring to you too bad read it anyway so our life our Doctrine our experience has to match God's word for the present hour not our imagination or some explanation we can't afford to live in a glare any longer we got to be sure that God is with us because we're headed someplace we're not just coming to church every Sunday no we're headed to the gate of the Resurrection we're headed someplace you see and so um we we have to have the the the attitude of the word well um brother Brown says here well that's the way it is today uh he says it's the way it is today with some people to call themselves Christians uh you say oh I belong to the church that's good yeah the reason there's so much trouble in the church the reason there's so much confusion in the church so much discontentment it's a sound like a place you ever was yeah confusion discontentment trouble it's not because Jesus is not there it's because Jesus can't gain access to the places he wants to go we have those little compartments and we say oh no no don't touch that come in that's far enough um I'll join the church otherwise let me run my own business Jesus wants to be supreme ruler of your being and the only way he can bless you is when he becomes your lord lord is rulership ownership who made you who was who has the right to every place in your heart the Creator another place he says and when Jesus comes in he wants to be welcomed but we've got those little secret doors little bitty doors in our heart that we don't want Jesus in there over on the right hand side now you might think he's dramatizing but let's just believe he knows what he's talking about on the right hand side of the human heart after Jesus gets in it's a little bitty door called Pride oh I'll receive it as Savior but don't tell me what I got to do and how I gotta dress and what I have to do I have to let my hair grow and stop smoking and go into the pool room and all this stuff don't worry he won't stay too long because you're Anointed with pride so if he's not Lord of all he's not an artist you see you have to yield to him and you you might need prayer you might need a lot of things God is able to change up to the uttermost look at Paul Paul was a bad boy he was following his prophet's words to the letter killing everybody didn't see it his way bad yeah you can go on uh what is it Christian book distributor someplace and get the film Paul Apostle of Jesus Christ very good with scripture and he he was bad but he was defending in a religious cause but then when God got a hold of him why did God let him do all that only God knows but you see I know people today they have run and run and run and run but thank God I called all of them God can solve anything yes you haven't gone too far God can solve your problem so may God bless you I hope some of this makes sense and um if we come back we'll go in another Direction but it's good to see you it's good to be with you in fellowship and we just pray that God will bless you [Applause] amen isn't it good to be in the house of the Lord this afternoon we sure want the will of the Lord don't we amen we don't want our own will we want the will of the Lord and I appreciate how brother uh brother brother George he uh brought in some things that we've heard recently haven't we so the Lord's confirming his word and you want we don't want to be a Jonah we want to hear God's word the first time and follow that word and just let it take and like he said don't get two degrees off let's just stay right with the word it'll be all right God knows what he's doing he's got a map that we don't have aren't you glad for that today amen amen amen let's let's stand together for just a few moments and maybe you've got a need or something on your life tonight and you'd like to uh you'd like us to pray with you we'd be glad to do that tonight but amen we just love the Lord and we want the Lord to to have his way in our lives don't we why don't you just talk to him for a minute and say Lord those little doors
