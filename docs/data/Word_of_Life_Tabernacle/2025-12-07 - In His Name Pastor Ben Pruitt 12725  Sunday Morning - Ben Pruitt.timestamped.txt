[38:56] Amen. If you can't do nothing else, we

[42:19] [music]
[42:20] he first
[42:22] loved me.
[42:25] Amen. [music] God bless you this
[42:27] morning. Uh you can be seated for just a
[42:29] moment. That's all the music we'll
[42:30] [music] have at this time. Amen. Did you
[42:33] enjoy the worship this morning?
[42:35] &gt;&gt; I trust that you did. Uh just a couple
[42:37] of announcements before we go on into
[42:39] the service. Um, we've uh, you may have
[42:42] noticed we're doing some construction
[42:44] around the uh, the churchyard and we're
[42:47] adding a fence, actually two fences, one
[42:49] around the playground and one around
[42:51] this area out back and to protect our
[42:53] children from the highway mostly. And
[42:56] uh, so I'm thankful for the brothers had
[42:58] the vision to do that. That should be
[42:59] done this week. They'll be completed
[43:01] with that. But there's a couple of holes
[43:03] out there in the ground on the
[43:04] playground. So, they may have covered
[43:06] those up with plywood, but just kind of
[43:08] watch your kids until they get that
[43:09] done. And um if you want to help us with
[43:13] that, I haven't really opened that up to
[43:15] the church. I've never had to ask. We've
[43:17] never had to ask for money. You all are
[43:19] wonderful in your giving and your
[43:20] tithing and things like that, but if you
[43:23] do have some extra that you wanted to
[43:24] help out with something specific, u we
[43:27] we are paying for that out of the
[43:29] church. And so, you'd sure be welcome to
[43:31] help. Just see Brother David or one of
[43:33] the trustees. we'd be glad to glad to
[43:36] have you assist with that. And and I'm
[43:38] I'm thankful we're adding a a basketball
[43:40] goal and volleyball. I know a lot of
[43:42] people say, "What do we need that for?"
[43:43] Well, it's because we got about 50 kids
[43:46] running around. And we'd much rather
[43:48] have them out here than down at the gym
[43:50] or somewhere else, you know, and and so
[43:52] we sure uh we we love to see them
[43:55] fellowship. We want to see them grow to
[43:57] love one another and just be a real
[43:58] body. And we're here a lot of times on
[44:00] Sunday afternoons all day some of us.
[44:02] And so we sure we sure want to see that
[44:06] fellowship grow and that love for one
[44:08] another. So we're doing everything we
[44:09] can for our young people and to do that.
[44:12] And so uh that'll be a part of that.
[44:14] It's not real expensive, but it's just
[44:16] something that we're doing to try to
[44:18] help out. Uh they got put new windows in
[44:20] the sides of the church. So you may not
[44:22] notice that, but it it'll be a help, I'm
[44:24] sure, uh with uh upgraded windows. And
[44:28] thank you to all those who helped. you
[44:30] know who you are who assisted in uh
[44:32] getting those for us and installing
[44:34] those. Thank you for doing that. It it
[44:36] matters. Every little thing matters. I
[44:37] think we ought to keep up the house of
[44:39] God. We got a Christmas program for the
[44:41] kids on uh December
[44:44] uh 21st at evening. If you want to come
[44:46] for that, I'm sure they'd appreciate
[44:48] that. Keep that in mind. On New Year's
[44:50] Eve, we're going to do [snorts] a very
[44:52] special service that night. It's a
[44:54] Wednesday night, so it'll be a regular
[44:55] service. We're not going to have a a
[44:58] 4-hour service on that Wednesday night,
[45:00] but maybe you don't normally come on
[45:02] Wednesday night, and you'd be able to
[45:04] that Wednesday because the next day is
[45:06] New Year's. We're off of work and
[45:08] school. So, if you're able to come to
[45:10] that service, we're going to have a
[45:11] joint service that night with Christian
[45:14] Tabernacle. They're letting out their
[45:16] service and brother Jason Jackson is
[45:18] going to be preaching for us that night.
[45:20] So, I thank God for fellowship and we
[45:23] wanted to reach out and and do
[45:24] everything we can to promote that. So,
[45:27] they're going to be here with us on
[45:29] December 31st and I know a lot of people
[45:31] are gone and and and whatever on the
[45:34] first of the year, but if you're here or
[45:36] can come to that service, we'd sure
[45:38] appreciate it in the interest of
[45:39] fellowship. And we may, depends on how
[45:42] it works out, we may serve communion
[45:44] that night. If we don't, then we'll
[45:45] serve it the next Sunday instead of
[45:48] doing it tonight so we can have
[45:49] communion to begin the year. Do you love
[45:52] the Lord this morning?
[45:53] &gt;&gt; Is he wonderful to you?
[45:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Let's bow our heads
[45:58] together. Let's stand and bow our heads
[45:59] together.
[46:01] It's good to have all of our visitors
[46:02] with us this morning. God bless you,
[46:04] each one of you. Pray the service will
[46:06] be a blessing to you.
[46:09] Heavenly Father, we're so grateful to be
[46:12] in your house again today. Lord, you're
[46:15] wonderful to us. Lord, what could we
[46:18] say? As David said, what could I return
[46:21] unto the Lord for all that he has done
[46:22] for me,
[46:24] Lord? And he said, I'll pay my vows in
[46:27] the congregation.
[46:29] I will take the cup of salvation. Help
[46:32] us to drink from it this morning. May
[46:35] your word open up to us, oh God. May we
[46:38] may we recognize who you are and what
[46:40] you've done for us, Lord, and what what
[46:43] your name means to us. We thank you for
[46:45] it this morning, Lord. I pray you'd heal
[46:47] every sick person. I I pray under the
[46:50] sound of my voice that there's a
[46:51] backslider here, a sick person, whatever
[46:52] it is, Lord, you'd meet that need today.
[46:55] I pray you would do it. We thank you for
[46:57] your spirit we feel here in the
[46:58] building. I pray it would continue to be
[47:00] here, Lord, throughout the day. We thank
[47:03] you for it in Jesus' name. Amen. God
[47:06] bless you. Matthew chapter 1 verse 21
[47:09] and also Matthew 12 21. Matthew 1:21 and
[47:14] Matthew 12 21.
[47:17] I want to speak to you this morning on
[47:19] his name. In his name. Matthew 1
[47:24] 21.
[47:27] [snorts]
[47:28] Turning there. Just give you a little
[47:29] bit of time to do that. Matthew chapter
[47:31] 1 verse 21. and she shall bring forth a
[47:35] son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus.
[47:40] What was his name?
[47:41] &gt;&gt; Jesus. For he shall save his people from
[47:45] their sins. And then Matthew 12 and
[47:50] verse 21.
[47:57] Matthew 12 [snorts]
[48:00] 21. and in his name. Someone say it with
[48:03] me. His name
[48:05] &gt;&gt; shall all the Gentiles trust. I pray the
[48:09] Lord would add his blessing to the word.
[48:11] You may be seated this morning.
[48:14] We talked Wednesday night about the
[48:15] Nyian council of 325 AD and the
[48:18] significance of that. If you didn't
[48:20] weren't able to be here for that
[48:21] service, I uh you probably should go
[48:24] back and watch it. just some things that
[48:26] have happened recently uh that uh
[48:29] they're bringing about another Nika and
[48:31] another ecumenical council and we know
[48:33] the impact of that the main uh impact of
[48:37] the nyian council was to change the
[48:39] baptism formula from the name of the
[48:42] lord Jesus Christ or Jesus Christ to the
[48:44] name of the father and of the son and of
[48:47] the holy ghost. Now, some would say,
[48:49] "Well, that's what the Bible says in
[48:50] Matthew 28:19.
[48:52] It says, "Go ye therefore and teach all
[48:54] nations, baptizing them in the name of
[48:57] the Father and of the Son and and of the
[48:59] Holy Ghost." But we know that Father,
[49:01] Son, and Holy Ghost are not names, but
[49:04] they're titles.
[49:06] &gt;&gt; They're titles. So, he said, "Baptize
[49:07] them in the name of the Father and the
[49:10] Son and the Holy Ghost." So, there many
[49:13] titles for God in the scripture. Moses
[49:15] said uh when he come to God, you know,
[49:18] he he they knew God by titles, but they
[49:21] didn't know his name. And in Egypt,
[49:23] where Moses was taught, there were about
[49:25] 1,500 deities. And those deities would
[49:29] uh each one have a name based on what
[49:31] they did. So, Osiris was the god of the
[49:34] underworld, and Raw was the god of of uh
[49:37] forget what Raw was the god of, but he
[49:39] was the god of something else. And they
[49:41] had a god of for each specific thing.
[49:43] Everything had a god, deities for
[49:45] different cities and and so they would
[49:48] want to know what the name is because
[49:50] they would want to know what that god
[49:51] did. Right?
[49:53] &gt;&gt; So, but what God told him, it's
[49:55] interesting. Instead of saying, "Here's
[49:56] my name. By my name, you'll know what I
[49:58] do." He said, "I am that I am." So, in
[50:02] other words, what I do is who I am.
[50:05] &gt;&gt; Right? You'll know be know me by my
[50:07] works. So, he said, "I am that I am."
[50:10] And we know in the Old Testament, he was
[50:12] Elohim. He was Jehovah. And all the
[50:14] different uh redemptive names of God and
[50:17] Jehovah, the almighty God, the El
[50:19] Shadai. We know that he went by very
[50:22] many uh different things when he came to
[50:24] earth as the son of God. He he was
[50:26] called many things but his name was
[50:29] Jesus. Luke 2:21 says when 8 days were
[50:33] accomplished for the circumcising of the
[50:34] child it said his name was called Jesus
[50:38] which was so named of the angel before
[50:41] he was conceived in the womb. And since
[50:44] that time, everything. Someone say it
[50:47] with me. Everything that is done is done
[50:50] in that name.
[50:52] &gt;&gt; The name of Jesus.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; Because the name was more than just a it
[50:57] was more than just a a title. It was
[51:00] more than just a uh just an idea. But
[51:03] the name was actually a person. It had
[51:06] attributes. It had uh it had abilities.
[51:09] It had it was God in flesh. He didn't
[51:12] tell us about an abstract idea. It
[51:15] wasn't what somebody said about God, but
[51:17] all that God was, he poured into Christ.
[51:20] And so that name tells us exactly who
[51:24] God was and how he would interact.
[51:26] Aren't you glad? Because when that name
[51:28] come to the earth, he he he didn't just
[51:30] go to the good people. He he went to the
[51:33] sinners like you and I. And he he sat
[51:35] with sinners and he he fellowship with
[51:37] people and he and he poured out his life
[51:40] for us. He healed the sick. We know who
[51:42] God is because of Jesus Christ. Aren't
[51:45] you glad for that today?
[51:47] &gt;&gt; So we we the Old Testament was a figure,
[51:50] a type of him. It showed shadows of him.
[51:52] But in the New Testament, he come down
[51:54] with his name. He was called Jesus. And
[51:57] he was named of the angel before he was
[52:00] conceived in the womb. So there's life
[52:02] in his name. In John chapter 20 and
[52:05] verse 31, it it talks about how there
[52:06] were many things that could been
[52:08] written, could have been written. But it
[52:09] said, "But these are written that you
[52:11] might believe that Jesus is the Christ,
[52:14] the son of God." THAT'S STILL THE gospel
[52:16] message. By the way, we want you to
[52:18] believe that Jesus is the Christ, the
[52:21] son of God, and that believing you might
[52:23] have life through his name.
[52:26] &gt;&gt; So believing in him, you have life
[52:28] through his name.
[52:29] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. We are to perform the great
[52:32] commission in his name. In Mark 16 and
[52:36] verse 17, these signs shall follow them
[52:38] that believe in my name. Shall they cast
[52:41] out devils. They shall speak with new
[52:43] tongues. They shall take up serpents,
[52:46] and if they drink any deadly thing, it
[52:48] shall not hurt them. They shall lay
[52:52] hands on the sick, and they shall
[52:54] recover.
[52:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. What is it in my name? They shall
[52:57] cast out devils. What are we doing?
[52:59] We're performing the great commission
[53:01] not on OUR OWN MERITS, NOT WITH OUR OWN
[53:04] ABILITIES, not with our own attributes,
[53:07] but in the name and the attributes of
[53:09] Jesus Christ. Whatever his name is is
[53:11] who he is. Whatever he is is able to
[53:13] heal, is able to He proved that when he
[53:16] was here, able to save, able to deliver.
[53:19] Amen.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; He's still able today.
[53:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's still Jesus.
[53:25] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad that he is?
[53:28] Amen.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Getting a little bit of ringing in
[53:32] my ear. I don't think you can hear it
[53:33] out there, but [snorts] maybe turn me
[53:35] down just a little. I'm hollering at
[53:37] people. I think in Acts chapter 2 and
[53:40] verse 38, are you with me so far?
[53:44] &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "Repent, be baptized,
[53:46] every one of you, in the name of Jesus
[53:49] Christ." So Peter tells us, he opens the
[53:51] door for the Gentiles to tell us what
[53:54] the name of the father and of the son
[53:56] and of the holy ghost is. And that name
[53:59] is Jesus Christ. And you shall receive
[54:02] the gift of the holy ghost.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[54:05] &gt;&gt; So that's the promise of the Holy Ghost.
[54:06] It's tied to being baptized in his name.
[54:09] This was the only way people were
[54:10] baptized in scripture. Yeah. How many
[54:13] knows that they were never baptized in
[54:16] the titles of father, son, and holy
[54:17] ghost. In the Bible in Acts 8:1 16, it
[54:21] says they were baptized in the name of
[54:23] the Lord Jesus. In Acts 19 and five, it
[54:25] says when they heard this, they were
[54:27] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
[54:30] Peter raised the lame man at the gate.
[54:32] Beautiful in his name.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; In his name. It said Peter said, "Silver
[54:36] and gold have I none, but such as I have
[54:39] I give I thee." So he's saying, "I do
[54:41] have something. I'm going to give it to
[54:43] thee in the name of Jesus Christ of
[54:46] Nazareth. Rise up and walk." I believe
[54:48] there's still power in his name.
[54:49] [laughter] If there's a lame man HERE
[54:51] THIS MORNING, GOD'S ABLE TO RAISE THEM
[54:53] UP. IF THERE'S A SICK PERSON HERE THIS
[54:55] MORNING, GOD'S ABLE TO HEAL in the name
[54:57] of Jesus Christ. Uh, don't you realize
[55:00] what an important thing it was in our
[55:02] day that that name come back to us that
[55:04] we were able now to understand the the
[55:07] mystery of the name of Jesus Christ that
[55:09] had been hid. It was one of those loose
[55:11] ends that had been uh that needed to be
[55:13] tied up that had been hid from by
[55:15] denominational CREED SINCE NIKA. BUT NOW
[55:18] IT'S BEEN REVEALED. WHY? BECAUSE AT the
[55:20] end time there had to BE A BRIDE WHO
[55:22] WOULD PERFORM THOSE MIRACLES IN HIS NAME
[55:25] who would DO WHAT HE CALLED THEM TO DO.
[55:27] THERE'S GOT TO BE A PEOPLE ON THE EARTH
[55:28] AT THE END TIME WHO WILL NOT JUST CALL
[55:30] THEMSELVES BY THE NAME OF JESUS, BUT WHO
[55:33] WILL OPERATE IN THAT NAME,
[55:36] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? SO, WE'RE CALLED TO SOMETHING
[55:38] HIGHER THAN JUST GOING TO CHURCH. LET ME
[55:40] PREACH HERE FOR JUST A MINUTE. WE'RE
[55:41] CALLED FOR SOMETHING HIGHER THAN JUST
[55:43] WARM A CHURCH FEW. WE'RE CALLED FOR
[55:45] SOMETHING MORE THAN JUST TO BE ANOTHER
[55:47] ANOTHER CHURCH, ANOTHER BUNCH OF PEOPLE.
[55:49] WE'RE CALLED TO PERFORM THE WILL OF GOD
[55:51] AS HIS BODY ON THE EARTH IN HIS NAME TO
[55:54] CAST OUT DEVILS.
[55:55] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. Are you with me now?
[55:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't mean it'll be something
[56:00] flashy. I don't mean we'll run around
[56:02] emptying hospitals, but we'll do the
[56:04] will of the father in the name of Jesus
[56:07] Christ.
[56:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Acts 4 and:e 10 it says, "Be
[56:13] it known unto you all and to all the
[56:14] people of Israel." Well, this is Peter
[56:16] explaining how this lame man was healed
[56:19] that by the name of Jesus Christ of
[56:21] Nazareth, whom you crucify, whom God
[56:23] raised from the dead, even by him doth
[56:26] this man stand here before you whole.
[56:31] Everything in the book of Acts was done
[56:32] in his name.
[56:35] &gt;&gt; In Colossians 3:17, Paul tells us as
[56:38] Gentiles, he says, "Whatsoever," someone
[56:40] say, "whatsoever."
[56:42] whatsoever you do.
[56:44] Now, think about this for a minute and I
[56:46] want us to think more deeply about it
[56:48] than just maybe the words of it, but
[56:52] think about what this means and how to
[56:53] apply this in our own lives.
[56:56] &gt;&gt; Whatsoever you do in word or deed,
[57:00] &gt;&gt; do how much?
[57:03] &gt;&gt; All.
[57:05] &gt;&gt; See, you can't hate your neighbor
[57:08] &gt;&gt; in the name.
[57:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[57:11] You can't commit sin in the name.
[57:15] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[57:16] &gt;&gt; You can't live like the devil in the
[57:18] name.
[57:20] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[57:21] &gt;&gt; You can you can talk about the message.
[57:23] You can you you can say, "I'm a
[57:26] believer." You can claim to believe in a
[57:28] pillar of fire and a prophet, BUT IF YOU
[57:30] CAN'T DO WHAT you do in the name.
[57:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? Just saying I'm a
[57:37] Christian is not enough. Saying I'm a
[57:38] message believer is not enough. But can
[57:40] you does YOUR LIFE BEAR OUT that
[57:42] everything you do is in the name of the
[57:45] Lord Jesus? Giving thanks to God and the
[57:48] father BY HIM. HE SAID DO EVERYTHING IN
[57:49] THE NAME. GO to work IN THE NAME.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; GO TO CHURCH IN THE NAME.
[57:55] I started to say spank your kids in the
[57:57] name. But
[58:00] love your children in the name.
[58:02] [laughter]
[58:04] Take care OF THE CHURCH IN THE NAME.
[58:06] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU WITH me now? UH WHATEVER YOU DO,
[58:09] WHAT WHATEVER whatever you you have in
[58:11] YOUR LIFE, DO IT IN THE NAME. HOW CAN
[58:13] YOU DO IT IN THE NAME IF it's contrary
[58:15] to the word, you can't do it. But but
[58:17] you've got to be in the name of the Lord
[58:19] Jesus. Do it in the name of the Lord
[58:21] Jesus. Speak it in the name of the Lord
[58:23] Jesus. We know that everything IN HEAVEN
[58:25] AND EARTH WILL BOW TO THAT NAME. YOU'LL
[58:27] FIND THAT in Philippians chapter 2:10.
[58:28] HE SAID, "EVERY KNEE SHALL BOW AND EVERY
[58:31] TONGUE confess
[58:32] &gt;&gt; what to the in the name of Jesus
[58:34] Christ."
[58:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Revelation 2 and2 tells us that
[58:38] the Ephesian church age knew that name.
[58:41] They knew that name. And in verse two,
[58:44] it said, "I know thy works and thy labor
[58:46] and thy patience, and how thou canst not
[58:48] bear them which are evil. And thou HAS
[58:50] TRIED THEM WHICH SAY THEY are apostles
[58:52] and are not, has found them liars,
[58:54] &gt;&gt; AND HAST BORNE AND HAST PATIENCE, AND
[58:57] for my name's sake hast labored, and
[59:00] hast not fainted."
[59:02] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, he repeats that.
[59:03] He said, "These believers weren't
[59:05] laboring for Paul or for AN
[59:07] ORGANIZATION." COME ON. I know there's a
[59:10] lot of work that's done around the
[59:11] church, and I I know sometimes we get
[59:13] weary and welloing and and it seems like
[59:15] it falls on a few PEOPLE THAT DO A LOT
[59:18] OF the work. BUT I'LL SAY THIS, YOU'RE
[59:20] NOT DOING IT FOR PAUL. YOU'RE NOT DOING
[59:21] IT FOR AN ORGANIZATION. YOU'RE NOT DOING
[59:23] IT FOR BROTHER BRANDHAM. You're not
[59:25] DOING IT FOR THIS CHURCH. YOU'RE DOING
[59:26] IT FOR JESUS CHRIST. YOU'RE DOING IT IN
[59:28] THE NAME. WHATEVER YOU DO, IF YOU'RE A
[59:30] DEACON, be a deacon in the name. IF
[59:32] YOU'RE A TRUSTEE, BE A TRUSTEE IN THE
[59:34] NAME.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; Are you WITH ME NOW? DO IT IN THE NAME
[59:38] OF JESUS CHRIST. IF YOU LOVE YOUR
[59:40] NEIGHBOR, DO IT IN THE name of JESUS
[59:42] CHRIST. IF YOU TAKE CARE OF YOUR
[59:44] CHILDREN, DO IT IN THE name of Jesus
[59:45] Christ.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; So now, these believers weren't laboring
[59:49] for Paul. THEY WEREN'T COMMITTED TO
[59:51] PROGRAMS and institutions whereby they
[59:53] built up holdings of value. They worked
[59:56] for the Lord.
[59:59] And and that's WHY WE CAN PROMOTE OTHER
[1:00:01] CHURCHES, NOT JUST OUR OWN. THAT'S WHY
[1:00:03] WE CAN FELLOWSHIP WITH OTHER PEOPLE, NOT
[1:00:04] JUST THE PEOPLE SITTING HERE, RIGHT?
[1:00:06] WE'RE IT'S NOT JUST US. LISTEN, IF WE'RE
[1:00:08] THE ONLY ONES THAT ARE GOING TO MAKE IT
[1:00:09] IN, AND I'M THE ONLY PREACHER THAT'S
[1:00:11] RIGHT, SOMETHING'S WRONG.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; THAT WOULD BE A FAILURE BECAUSE HE SAID
[1:00:15] THERE WILL BE THERE WILL BE TWO IN ONE
[1:00:16] BED. ONE WILL BE TAKEN TO THE OTHER
[1:00:18] LEFT. ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD,
[1:00:19] THERE WILL BE SOMEBODY WHO'LL BE LIVING
[1:00:21] AT THAT SAME TIME THAT'LL BE TAKEN UP.
[1:00:23] THERE'S GOD'S PEOPLE ARE EVERYWHERE,
[1:00:25] CHURCH. HE'S GOT A BRIDE. IT MAY NOT BE
[1:00:26] HUGE. IT MAY BE A SMALL NUMBER, BUT HE'S
[1:00:28] GOT A BRIDE EVERYWHERE. LET ME BE PART
[1:00:31] OF THAT BRIDE. LET ME PUT MY SHOULDER TO
[1:00:33] THE WILL AND DO EVERYTHING THAT I DO IN
[1:00:35] THE NAME OF THE LORD Jesus Christ.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; Can you do IT IN THE NAME? SO, AND THAT
[1:00:43] THAT CHALLENGES US IN EVERY AREA OF OUR
[1:00:45] LIFE. CAN I CAN I WORK THIS JOB IN THE
[1:00:47] name of the Lord Jesus?
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; Good.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; CAN I RAISE MY CHILDREN THIS WAY IN THE
[1:00:53] NAME of the Lord Jesus? CAN I WEAR THESE
[1:00:55] CLOTHES IN THE NAME OF THE LORD JESUS?
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; CAN I LIVE THIS WAY IN the name of the
[1:01:02] Lord Jesus?
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; Oh God, help us today.
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; They work for the Lord. They were his
[1:01:09] servants, not the pawns of organization.
[1:01:12] I like that. They didn't go to church ON
[1:01:15] SUNDAY AND TALK ABOUT THAT NAME AND THEN
[1:01:17] forget it the rest of the week.
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; They didn't give lip service to that
[1:01:20] name. NO, SIR. IT WAS THEIR LIVES THAT
[1:01:22] WERE GIVEN. THEIR LIVES. OH, FOR A GROUP
[1:01:25] OF PEOPLE. WE DON'T HAVE TO BE A LARGE
[1:01:26] NUMBER, BUT FOR A GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT
[1:01:28] WOULD GIVE THEIR LIVES TO HIM, THAT
[1:01:30] WOULD SAY, "I'M WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS
[1:01:31] IN THE NAME." WE MAY NOT FEEL LIKE GOING
[1:01:33] TO CHURCH, BUT IN THE NAME. WE MAY NOT
[1:01:35] FEEL LIKE DOING WHAT'S RIGHT, BUT IN THE
[1:01:37] NAME. WE MAY FEEL LIKE HOLDING A GRUDGE
[1:01:39] OR A ROOE OF BITTERNESS, BUT IN THE
[1:01:40] NAME, WE FORGIVE OTHERS IN THE NAME OF
[1:01:43] JESUS CHRIST. BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT HE DID
[1:01:45] WHEN HE CAME.
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; In the name. Good.
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; In that name they acted. All they did
[1:01:56] they did in that name, in that name they
[1:01:57] acted. But if they could not act in that
[1:02:00] name and they refrained from acting.
[1:02:03] [snorts] These were heavenly placed
[1:02:05] Christians whose behavior was in the
[1:02:08] Lord. Listen church. We're not trying to
[1:02:11] make you conform to church behavior.
[1:02:13] That's why we're not legalistic.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; Listen, I I know people think, "Well, if
[1:02:17] I don't do certain things, the pastor
[1:02:19] will treat me bad." That's not going to
[1:02:20] happen here.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; I don't I don't do things that way. I
[1:02:24] don't mistreat you because you did
[1:02:26] something I don't approve of.
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; God help me today. I know sometimes you
[1:02:33] like, "Well, the pastor doesn't love me.
[1:02:35] Just you you have to believe me on this.
[1:02:37] If I miss you in some way or didn't do
[1:02:39] something I should have done, it was an
[1:02:41] oversight. It's not in my heart to do
[1:02:42] that. I I want to serve God in his
[1:02:45] name." And that means serving his
[1:02:46] people. It doesn't matter if you're the
[1:02:48] weakest Christian in the church or the
[1:02:49] most advanced in the church or or it
[1:02:52] doesn't matter to me how you live. It
[1:02:53] didn't matter to Jesus.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; I'll still LOVE YOU. BUT I GOT TO PREACH
[1:02:57] THE TRUTH.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; I got to preach THE WORD. AND WHAT I
[1:03:00] WANT IS NOT FOR YOU TO TO LISTEN AND
[1:03:02] OBEY BECAUSE I SAID IT. I DON'T WANT YOU
[1:03:04] TO JUST DRESS RIGHT BECAUSE THE PASTOR'S
[1:03:06] going to get on to you if YOU DON'T. I
[1:03:08] WANT YOU TO DRESS RIGHT BECAUSE YOU WANT
[1:03:09] TO BE IN HIS NAME.
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE A HEAVENLY PLACE CHRISTIAN. IF
[1:03:13] YOU CAN'T DO IT IN THE NAME, then you
[1:03:14] refrain from acting.
[1:03:17] Good. Very good.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; Think about it, CHURCH. IF YOU CAN'T DO
[1:03:20] IT IN HIS NAME, JUST DON'T DO IT.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; YOU can't drink alcohol in his name. You
[1:03:26] can't Come on, church.
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; YOU YOU CAN'T GET DRUNK IN HIS NAME. YOU
[1:03:30] CAN'T BE HIGH ON DRUGS IN HIS NAME.
[1:03:32] THERE'S CERTAIN CLOTHES YOU CAN'T WEAR
[1:03:34] IN HIS NAME. WHY? BECAUSE HIS WORD IS
[1:03:36] HIS NAME. I'M GONNA SHOW IT TO YOU AFTER
[1:03:37] A WHILE. YOU CAN'T DO THAT BECAUSE THE
[1:03:39] WORD SAYS NOT TO DO IT. I JUST I WOULD I
[1:03:42] WOULD TELL YOU GET ACQUAINTED WITH THE
[1:03:44] WORD AND GET ACQUAINTED WITH THE SPIRIT
[1:03:46] AND LET THAT RULE YOUR LIFE AND LET THIS
[1:03:48] BE A PLACE OF BIRTHING THAT PEOPLE WOULD
[1:03:50] BE BORN BY THE WORD INTO FULL MATURE
[1:03:53] CHILDREN of Jesus Christ.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; THAT COULD STAND IN THE name of Jesus
[1:03:57] Christ.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; Not where some man stands up here with a
[1:04:00] with a shovel, like whack-a-mole ready
[1:04:03] to beat you down every time you come up.
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? WE CAN'T DO THAT IN HIS NAME.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; RIGHT. THE BIBLE TELLS US PASTORS NOT TO
[1:04:11] BE LORDS over God's heritage.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; We don't do THAT IN HIS NAME. BUT IN HIS
[1:04:15] NAME, I PREACH THE GOSPEL. IN HIS NAME,
[1:04:17] WHEN THESE OTHER BROTHERS STAND UP HERE,
[1:04:18] THEY PREACH THE GOSPEL. PREACH THE WORD
[1:04:21] IN HIS NAME. SING THE SONGS IN HIS NAME.
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; SO, let me I can't preach my own opinion
[1:04:29] in his name.
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; Could only preach the word in his name.
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; I have opinions. have many opinions,
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; but that don't mean that I I can stand
[1:04:41] on those opinions. I got to stand on the
[1:04:43] word because I stand in his name.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; That false vine group, he said, that
[1:04:48] wanted to defile
[1:04:50] that name. Hung like skullking wolves in
[1:04:52] the dark, waiting to get in and tear
[1:04:55] down, but the saints stood the test.
[1:04:59] Kept the word and the name.
[1:05:04] I went here with Homer Longoria last
[1:05:05] night and it really blessed me because
[1:05:07] he was talking about how that he brought
[1:05:09] them out of the wilderness, the children
[1:05:10] of Israel out of the wilderness and God
[1:05:12] told him, he said, "I did that to prove
[1:05:14] you and to see what was in your heart."
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; And that's kind of what I'm saying this
[1:05:19] morning is you got to stand the test and
[1:05:21] keep the word in his name.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; And many times we go through the things
[1:05:24] that we're going through because he's
[1:05:26] going to prove us. He wants to see
[1:05:28] what's in our heart,
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; Is is the love for his name IN OUR
[1:05:31] HEART? YEAH.
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; SEE, the Ephesians church age has lost
[1:05:34] that. Revelation 2:4. It said,
[1:05:35] "Nevertheless, I HAVE SOMEWHAT AGAINST
[1:05:37] THEE BECAUSE THOU HAST LEFT THY first
[1:05:39] love." Oh, oh, God. We see it. It's so
[1:05:42] evident so many times in church. And I
[1:05:43] don't mean, again, I'M NOT SCOLDING YOU,
[1:05:45] BUT you can see when people begin to to
[1:05:47] back up from from THE WORD. AND I don't
[1:05:50] mean back up from church as much as back
[1:05:51] up from the word, THEY BEGIN TO
[1:05:53] QUESTION. They begin to wonder, "Is it
[1:05:54] really for me?" And and as they do, they
[1:05:56] they begin to that that fervent desire
[1:05:59] to please God, IT BEGINS TO DIE DOWN.
[1:06:01] AND AND that cry in THE SPIRIT AND HOW
[1:06:03] THEY USED TO GET INTO THE SERVICES. DO
[1:06:05] YOU REMEMBER A TIME WHEN THE LORD USED
[1:06:06] TO BLESS YOU AND THINGS USED TO MATTER
[1:06:08] TO YOU AND THE MESSAGE WAS REAL TO YOU
[1:06:10] AND YOU LOVE FEEDING ON IT AND YOU JUST
[1:06:12] KIND OF BACKED UP AND GOT OUT OF IT.
[1:06:14] LISTEN TO ME. YOU THERE THERE'S A WAY
[1:06:16] BACK. WHAT IS IT? IN HIS NAME. CAN YOU
[1:06:18] DO IT IN HIS NAME?
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; DON'T LOSE YOUR FIRST LOVE FOR HIS NAME.
[1:06:22] DON'T LOSE YOUR FIRST LOVE FOR HIS WORD.
[1:06:24] THE EPHESIAN church lost THEIR LOVE AND
[1:06:26] THAT'S HOW IT ENDED UP AT the Nian
[1:06:28] council. Yes.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; The fervent DESIRE TO PLEASE GOD, THE
[1:06:31] PASSION TO KNOW HIS WORD, THE CRY FOR
[1:06:33] REACHING OUT IN THE SPIRIT, ALL BEGIN TO
[1:06:35] FADE. AND INSTEAD OF THAT CHURCH BEING
[1:06:37] ON FIRE WITH THE FIRE OF GOD, IT COOLED
[1:06:40] OFF AND BECOME A BIT FORMAL. LISTEN,
[1:06:42] WE'LL FIGHT AGAINST THAT SPIRIT. EVERY
[1:06:43] TIME WE COME TO THE PULPIT, WE DON'T
[1:06:45] WANT A FORMAL CHURCH. WE DON'T WANT JUST
[1:06:47] ANOTHER ANOTHER DEAD RELIGION. WE WE
[1:06:50] SERVE GOD IN HIS NAME.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; You can't listen. If you want TO SIT
[1:06:54] LIKE A BUMP ON A PICKLE, THAT'S FINE.
[1:06:55] BUT I IN HIS NAME, I WORSHIP GOD. I
[1:06:58] WORSHIP HIM BECAUSE HE'S HERE.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; I believe he's here. A prophet come to
[1:07:04] tell us that we don't want to get a bit
[1:07:07] formal.
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; We want to worship God in his name.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; It's easy to get a bit formal,
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; Brother Ben, why? How do you know that?
[1:07:20] Because I can do it. I've done it.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; It's easy to get a bit formal,
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; And you just lose that fire. I'm not
[1:07:27] talking about running around the
[1:07:28] building.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; Talking about that just desire to please
[1:07:31] God.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; The desire we see in some of these kids,
[1:07:35] they just want to please the Lord.
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; Their consciences are tender. Some of us
[1:07:38] adults get to the place where we our
[1:07:40] conscience aren't tender anymore.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; God help us today.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; We We want to please him, don't we?
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; We don't want to just know the name. We
[1:07:48] want to love that name.
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, as we saying, oh, how I love Jesus.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; THAT OUGHT TO MEAN SOMETHING TO US.
[1:07:57] We sing Jesus is the sweetest NAME I
[1:07:59] KNOW. THAT OUGHT TO MEAN SOMETHING TO
[1:08:01] US. WE SING THERE'S NOTHING LIKE THAT
[1:08:03] NAME. THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THAT NAME.
[1:08:06] IT OUGHT TO MEAN SOMETHING TO US.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. We don't want to just know
[1:08:12] it. We want to love it. When the name of
[1:08:13] Jesus is mentioned, SOMETHING BEGINS TO
[1:08:15] HAPPEN. IT DON'T HAPPEN OUT HERE IN THE
[1:08:17] WORLD. THEY CUSS in his name and
[1:08:18] everything else. But when we mention his
[1:08:20] name, it brings something to us cuz IT'S
[1:08:22] A HEART CONDITION. IT'S NOT JUST A NAME
[1:08:24] WE SPEAK FROM THE LIPS, BUT IT'S
[1:08:26] SOMETHING WE HAVE IN OUR HEART.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; In his name, devils are cast out.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; And to cast out devils in his name is
[1:08:34] not just to use his name like a magic
[1:08:36] word,
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; right? Because today, you know,
[1:08:39] everybody's got t-shirts and mugs and
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; got the name of Jesus on it,
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; but his name is precious to me.
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; It's not just a t-shirt or a mug. And
[1:08:51] I'm not condemning you for that, but
[1:08:52] that's that's commercialism. They're
[1:08:55] making money off of that.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; Oh, but his name is precious.
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; I want to speak IT IN A IN A WAY THAT MY
[1:09:03] CHILDREN KNOW THAT THERE'S a reverence
[1:09:04] for it.
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; There's a reverence for that name. It's
[1:09:08] not a magic word. IT'S NOT SOMETHING WE
[1:09:10] JUST USE TO GET OUT OF TROUBLE.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; It's not a GET OUT OF JAIL FREE CARD,
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; BUT IT'S A REALITY OF THE NAME OF Jesus
[1:09:16] Christ.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. In Acts chapter 19:1, the Bible
[1:09:22] tells us that God wrought special
[1:09:23] miracles by the hands of Paul.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; SO THAT FROM HIS BODY WERE BROUGHT INTO
[1:09:27] THE SICK HANDKERCHIEF OR aprons and the
[1:09:30] diseases departed from them and the evil
[1:09:32] spirits went out of them. Then certain
[1:09:35] of the vagabond Jews exorcist took upon
[1:09:38] them to call over them which had evil
[1:09:40] spirits the name of the Lord Jesus. So a
[1:09:43] bunch of flim flam artists, bunch of uh
[1:09:46] conmen, right? we would say today
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; much of
[1:09:52] modern charismatics
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; I don't mean to be hard but that's you
[1:09:57] know that's what it become and I'm sure
[1:09:59] many of them people are sincere in the
[1:10:00] charismatic church but a lot of the
[1:10:02] leaders
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; right and they took it upon themselves
[1:10:06] to CALL OVER THEM WHICH HAD EVIL SPIRITS
[1:10:09] saying we adjure you by Jesus whom Paul
[1:10:13] preacheth
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; now this IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE YOU CAN'T
[1:10:17] CAST OUT A DEVIL BY THE JESUS THAT YOUR
[1:10:21] PASTOR PREACHES.
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; That's true,
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? YOU CAN'T CAST OUT A DEVIL BY THE
[1:10:26] JESUS THAT BECAUSE YOU KNEW SOME GREAT
[1:10:29] MAN OR YOU KNEW A PROPHET OR YOU KNEW
[1:10:32] THE SON OF A PROPHET OR YOU KNEW YOU
[1:10:34] KNEW A CHURCH, YOU KNEW WORD OF LIFE
[1:10:35] TABERNACLE OR YOU KNEW DANNY WARD OR YOU
[1:10:37] KNEW HARVEY SAVAGE OR YOU KNEW SOME
[1:10:39] GREAT MAN SOMEWHERE. YOU CAN'T CALL OUT,
[1:10:42] LISTEN, YOU CAN'T CAST OUT A DEVIL
[1:10:43] BECAUSE YOU KNOW SOMEBODY AND YOU KNOW
[1:10:46] THEY TRUST IN THE NAME OF JESUS. BUT
[1:10:48] THERE'S GOT TO BE a life that matches up
[1:10:50] to that,
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; Because they said, "WE ADJURE YOU BY
[1:10:54] JESUS WHOM PAUL PREACHETH." AND THERE
[1:10:57] WERE SEVEN sons of onekeva,
[1:11:00] a Jew and chief of the priest which did
[1:11:02] so. And the evil spirit answered,
[1:11:06] and now watch, these were seven
[1:11:07] denominational sons all out trying to
[1:11:10] cast out devils. And the evil spirit
[1:11:13] answered and said, "Jesus I know and
[1:11:16] Paul I know,
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; but who are you?"
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; You talk about embarrassing,
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; right? These seven guys, you know, they
[1:11:25] got all their their their church service
[1:11:28] going, got the organ going, got the
[1:11:29] music going, and got to dancing and
[1:11:32] worshiping in the spirit. if it was
[1:11:33] today, you know, and they got the
[1:11:35] anointing oil. They got buckets of it,
[1:11:36] you know, and and they walk down there
[1:11:38] and they're going to cast out this devil
[1:11:39] and and they get that devil together and
[1:11:42] they just pour the baptize them in the
[1:11:44] anointing oil and and speak in tongues
[1:11:46] over and everything else and and come
[1:11:48] out and say, "We adjure you in the name
[1:11:51] that Paul preaches."
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; You realize what how Satan would LIKE TO
[1:11:55] BRING THAT RIGHT DOWN INTO THE MESSAGE
[1:11:56] AND SAY, "WE ADJURE YOU BY THE GOD THAT
[1:11:59] WILLIAM BRANDOM HAD."
[1:12:01] BUT THAT CAN'T BE THE GOD THAT THAT'S
[1:12:02] THE SAME GOD WE HAVE. BUT WILLIAM
[1:12:04] BRANDHAM DID HIS JOB. BROTHER BRANDHAM
[1:12:06] DID HIS JOB. WE'VE GOT TO DO OUR JOB.
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T ADJURE SATAN BY THE NAME OF
[1:12:11] WHAT SOMEBODY ELSE HAD. AND SAY, "WELL,
[1:12:13] I'M FAITHFUL TO THE TEACHINGS OF SOME
[1:12:15] MAN." NO, IT'S GOT TO BE THE WORD IN YOU
[1:12:18] RECREATING ITSELF, BIRTHING ITSELF, A
[1:12:20] LIVING THING.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; YES, [applause]
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE TRUTH.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; SEE, THEY THEY KNEW THAT THEY KNEW WHAT
[1:12:26] PAUL TAUGHT ABOUT, but they didn't know
[1:12:28] him. They didn't know Christ. Yeah.
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; He said, "Who are you?"
[1:12:33] And the man in whom the evil spirit was
[1:12:35] leaped on them and overcame them. They
[1:12:38] went out to help somebody. There's a
[1:12:40] good lesson in this, by the way.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; You better make sure before you go
[1:12:44] dealing with evil spirits that you're
[1:12:45] strong enough.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; I'm going to go be a witness in in the
[1:12:51] bar. Well, you better make sure
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; that you're strong enough to overcome
[1:12:57] that
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; that evil spirit will come off on you.
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; Prevailed against them. So they fled out
[1:13:03] of the house naked and wounded. Talk
[1:13:05] about embarrassing.
[1:13:08] [snorts]
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; Their fall you'll be made known. The
[1:13:12] Bible says
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; Janice and Jambers the imitators.
[1:13:16] And this was known to all the Jews and
[1:13:18] Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus. And
[1:13:21] fear fell on them all. And the name of
[1:13:24] the Lord Jesus was magnified. YOU SAY,
[1:13:26] "BROTHER BEN, WHAT ABOUT THE IMITATORS?
[1:13:28] WHAT ABOUT THE COPYCATS? WHAT ABOUT THE
[1:13:30] PEOPLE WHO'VE GONE OUT AND AND CAUSED
[1:13:31] PEOPLE TO BLASPHEME? IN IT ALL, THE NAME
[1:13:34] OF THE LORD JESUS IS MAGNIFIED BECAUSE
[1:13:36] THE FACT THAT THERE'S A FALSE JUST
[1:13:38] HIGHLIGHTS THAT THERE IS A REAL."
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; The demon said, "Who are you,
[1:13:46] brother?" That's what's the matter
[1:13:47] today. You can't get up at the altar and
[1:13:48] say, "Well, hallelujah. Hallelujah,
[1:13:49] Lord. I want the Holy Ghost. Hallelujah.
[1:13:51] Hallelujah." No. Brother, sister, when
[1:13:52] the Holy Ghost has inspired the word to
[1:13:54] you,
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; Right. There's got to be an inspiration.
[1:13:57] When you HEAR ACTS 2:38 AND IT SAID,
[1:13:59] "REPENT and be baptized in the name of
[1:14:01] the LORD JESUS CHRIST." YOU'RE NOT JUST
[1:14:02] DOING IT FOR YOURSELF. You're doing it
[1:14:04] because THE HOLY GHOST INSPIRED THE WORD
[1:14:06] TO YOU.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; Not doing IT JUST BECAUSE SOMEBODY I
[1:14:09] KNOW THERE'S FOLKS HERE MAYBE THAT
[1:14:10] HAVEN'T been baptized correctly yet. BUT
[1:14:12] I'LL TELL YOU THIS, WHEN THAT WORD IS
[1:14:14] INSPIRED TO YOU, THERE WON'T BE NOBODY
[1:14:16] BE ABLE TO KEEP YOU OUT OF THE BAPTISMAL
[1:14:17] POOL.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; YOU'LL BE LIKE THE MAN SAID, "WHAT DOES
[1:14:20] HINDER ME FROM BEING BAPTIZED?"
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; BAPTIZED BY THE SIDE. OH, SISTER
[1:14:24] STEPHANIE, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING
[1:14:25] ABOUT. I PREACHED ON BAPTISM ONE SUNDAY
[1:14:27] AND THE NEXT SUNDAY, BROTHER TRIP AND
[1:14:29] SISTER STEPHANIE WERE BAPTIZED IN THE
[1:14:31] NAME OF THE LORD JESUS. AND BECAUSE IT'S
[1:14:33] SOMETHING INSPIRED THEIR HEART,
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; IT WAS that Sunday, actually, WE DIDN'T
[1:14:36] WE DIDN'T EVEN PLAN TO BAPTIZE THEM, BUT
[1:14:38] SOMETHING GOT IN THEIR HEART, THEY
[1:14:40] WANTED TO BE BAPTIZED. OH, THAT GOD
[1:14:41] WOULD DROP IN THE HEARTS OF OUR
[1:14:42] CHILDREN. DROP IN THE HEARTS OF OUR
[1:14:44] YOUNG PEOPLE. DROP IN THE HEARTS OF
[1:14:45] THOSE THE STRANGERS AMONG US. OH LORD, I
[1:14:48] WANT TO BE RIGHT. I WANT TO BE BAPTIZED
[1:14:50] IN THE NAME OF THE LORD JESUS CHRIST
[1:14:52] BECAUSE I WANT THE LIFE OF THAT NAME.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, YOU SHALL RECEIVE THE GIFT OF
[1:14:57] THE HOLY GHOST. AND THAT HOLY GHOST WILL
[1:14:58] KEEP YOU. IT'LL HELP YOU. IT'LL BE A
[1:15:01] COMFORT TO YOU. YOU MIGHT GO THROUGH
[1:15:02] SOME TRIALS, BUT IT'LL BE THERE FOR YOU
[1:15:04] EVERY MOMENT OF YOUR LIFE.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus. Yes.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:11] But he said, "Brother, sister, when the
[1:15:12] Holy Ghost has inspired that word to
[1:15:14] you, listen to the power of the name.
[1:15:16] When the HOLY GHOST HAS INSPIRED THAT
[1:15:17] WORD TO YOU, YOU'LL GET IT BEFORE YOU
[1:15:19] LEAVE your seat."
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; I heard him tell A GROUP OF YOUNG
[1:15:22] PEOPLE, HE SAID, "YOU YOUNG PEOPLE COME
[1:15:24] UP." HE SAID, "I SEEN YOU COMING TO PRAY
[1:15:26] AT THE ALTAR." HE SAID, "YOU JUST COME
[1:15:27] REJOICING AND COME AND THANK GOD FOR
[1:15:29] WHAT HE DID FOR YOU." HE SAID, "HE SAVED
[1:15:31] YOU BEFORE YOU EVEN LEFT YOUR SEAT." HE
[1:15:33] SAID, "WHEN YOU DECIDED TO COME."
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; GLORY TO GOD. YES.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; SOMETHING IN YOU. HE SAID, "BURN UP."
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "THE PREACHER WON'T HAVE TO
[1:15:41] TELL YOU TO DO THIS AND do that.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; The old LEAVES WILL JUST DROP OFF AND
[1:15:45] NEW LEAVES WILL COME ON. IT'S INSPIRED
[1:15:47] TO YOU. YOU WON'T GET ANGRY WITH THE
[1:15:48] PREACHER WHEN HE PREACHES TRUTH FROM THE
[1:15:50] BIBLE. YOU'LL LOVE IT AND REACH FOR IT.
[1:15:52] IT'S FOOD TO YOUR SOUL."
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; Even Jesus himself, HE SAID, "I DO NOT
[1:15:56] WHAT I WANT TO DO WITHIN MYSELF." HE
[1:15:58] SAID, "THE SON COULD DO NOTHING BUT WHAT
[1:16:00] HE SEES THE FATHER DOING." HE WAS
[1:16:02] EMMANUEL HIMSELF. GLORY. HE WAS GOD ON
[1:16:05] EARTH. JESUS WAS, HE WAS THE FLESH THAT
[1:16:08] GOD DWELT IN. HE WAS THE TENT THAT GOD
[1:16:10] LIVED UNDER.
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; BUT IN ALL OF THAT, THE VIRGIN BORN SON
[1:16:13] OF GOD, EMMANUEL IN THE FULLNESS OF THE
[1:16:16] SPIRIT. HE HAD THAT SPIRIT WITHOUT
[1:16:17] MEASURE. AND YET IN HIS OWN FLESH, HE
[1:16:19] SAID, "I DO NOTHING UNTIL THE FATHER
[1:16:21] SHOWS me first." Inspired to him to do
[1:16:23] it.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You remember when he was
[1:16:27] tempted, the devil said, "If you're the
[1:16:30] if you're who you say you are," he said,
[1:16:31] "turn these stones into bread."
[1:16:34] And brother Brandham uses that example
[1:16:36] and said he did he wouldn't do it.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; Man shall not live by bread alone but by
[1:16:41] every word that proceeded out of the
[1:16:43] mouth of God.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; But when one day there were 5,000 that
[1:16:47] needed to be fed.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; And he proved he COULD DO IT.
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; BUT HE WOULDN'T DO NOTHING UNLESS GOD
[1:16:53] TOLD HIM TO.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; Let's the father OH, COME ON, CHURCH.
[1:16:56] THAT'S WHAT WE'VE GOT TO BE. GOT TO GET
[1:16:58] TO A PLACE WHERE WE WHERE WE HAVE THE
[1:17:00] THE WILL OF GOD. WE HAVE THUS SAYETH THE
[1:17:01] LORD OR WE KEEP STILL.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; You know they say music I don't know a
[1:17:08] lot about music but I've been told that
[1:17:10] that the difference in a good musician
[1:17:12] and a great musician is not not how they
[1:17:15] play but knowing when not to play.
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; And we love our musicians but but you
[1:17:21] know knowing when not to play is a great
[1:17:24] thing. That pause.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; Some of the old comedians were great.
[1:17:27] They say because of the pause. that they
[1:17:30] knew how to pause. Paul Harvey on the
[1:17:33] radio, he knew how to pause,
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; right? Know when not to talk.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; Oh, God help me. I want to have thus
[1:17:39] SAYETH THE LORD OR don't say anything at
[1:17:41] all.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; Huh? Preachers are known by when they if
[1:17:45] they know how to quit.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; Y'all going to turn that on me before we
[1:17:54] get done.
[1:17:57] He said, "Don't try to impersonate."
[1:17:59] That's what's the matter with Pentecost
[1:18:00] today. That's what's the matter with the
[1:18:02] church today. There's too many trying to
[1:18:03] impersonate. They got the Holy Ghost.
[1:18:05] Too many trying to impersonate divine
[1:18:06] healing. You can't do that. That thing's
[1:18:08] come by election. God calling. You're
[1:18:10] dropped from the mother's womb with
[1:18:11] that. Gifts and callings are without
[1:18:12] repentance. But if God calls YOU, BE THE
[1:18:15] MOST THANKFUL PERSON IN THE WORLD
[1:18:16] BECAUSE HE'S CALLED YOU. THEN IT BECOMES
[1:18:18] REAL TO YOU.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; HE TALKED ABOUT HATTIE RIGHT. HOW HAD HE
[1:18:22] RIGHT THERE was just it WAS IN HER TO DO
[1:18:24] WHAT SHE DID. HE SAID SHE COULDN'T HAVE
[1:18:26] DONE IT. HE SAID, "UNLESS IT WAS
[1:18:27] INSPIRED TO HER TO DO IT,
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; IT HAD TO BE." OH, COME ON, CHURCH.
[1:18:31] WE'RE NOT OUT HERE JUST UH WE WE BELIEVE
[1:18:33] WE HAVE THE POWER OF THE SPOKEN WORD.
[1:18:35] BUT WE'RE NOT OUT HERE JUST SPEAKING
[1:18:36] THINGS WILLY-NILLY. WHY ARE WE NOT DOING
[1:18:38] THAT? YOU SAY, "WELL, IF YOU HAVE THE
[1:18:39] POWER OF THE SPOKEN WORD, speak that
[1:18:41] hospital empty and speak your children
[1:18:43] all THIS AND ALL THAT." NO, WE CAN ONLY
[1:18:45] SPEAK BY THE INSPIRATION OF THE WORD.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN YOU NEED IT AND when the
[1:18:48] inspiration comes, he'll it'll BE THERE
[1:18:51] AND HE'LL BACK UP HIS WORD.
[1:18:55] It happened to the right woman at the
[1:18:56] right time and she was inspired. Brother
[1:18:58] Brandon said, "HOW COULD THAT EVER
[1:18:59] HAPPEN? It couldn't have done it, but it
[1:19:00] was inspired quickened. The word was
[1:19:02] spoken. It was made so."
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; OH, GLORY TO GOD. I BELIEVE THAT'S THE
[1:19:06] TIME WE'RE LIVING IN. DON'T BE WORRIED
[1:19:08] ABOUT MAKING THE RAPTURE. HE SAID, "I'M
[1:19:10] WORRIED I MIGHT MISS THE RAPTURE." DON'T
[1:19:11] BE WORRIED, LITTLE BRIDE. REMEMBER, HE
[1:19:13] SAID HE SPOKE IT AND IT WAS SO. GLORY.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; IF YOU GO TO THE RAPTURE SERMON, BROTHER
[1:19:17] BRANDON SAID, "IT'S BEEN SPOKEN. SO
[1:19:19] SHALL IT BE DONE."
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:19:22] All right.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:25] I I know men want to Do you KNOW WHY
[1:19:28] PEOPLE PREACH FEAR AND CONDEMNATION all
[1:19:30] the time? Well, you might miss it. You
[1:19:31] might if you go against my word if you
[1:19:33] leave my church. You might miss THE
[1:19:34] RAPTURE. YOU KNOW WHY THEY PREACH LIKE
[1:19:36] THAT? Because they want to be the one
[1:19:37] that holds the KEY OVER WHETHER OR NOT
[1:19:39] YOU'RE GOING TO BE SAVED. BUT LISTEN,
[1:19:41] YOU WERE IN THE MIND OF GOD BEFORE YOU
[1:19:43] EVER MET ME. BEFORE YOU EVER HEARD ME
[1:19:45] PREACH, BEFORE YOU EVER COME TO THIS
[1:19:46] CHURCH, YOU WERE IN THE MIND OF GOD. YOU
[1:19:48] DON'T BELONG TO A PREACHER. YOU BELONG
[1:19:49] TO GOD. YES, SIR.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; I DON'T HOLD THE KEY OVER YOU OR WHETHER
[1:19:53] OR NOT YOU'RE GOING IN THE RAPTURE, BUT
[1:19:54] THAT'S THAT SECRET HID IN YOUR OWN
[1:19:56] HEART. AND IF IT WAS SPOKEN, IT'LL BE.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; THE WORD WAS SPOKEN. IT WAS MADE SO.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; OH, GLORY TO GOD. WE'RE GOING TO SEE OUR
[1:20:04] LOVED ONES ONE DAY. I FEEL LIKE
[1:20:06] PREACHING THIS MORNING. WE'RE GOING TO
[1:20:07] SEE THEM ONE OF THESE DAYS. THEY'RE
[1:20:09] GOING TO APPEAR BEFORE US. WHY? NOT
[1:20:11] BECAUSE WE WERE GOOD PEOPLE. NOT BECAUSE
[1:20:12] WE WERE THE BEST SINGERS OR THE BEST
[1:20:14] PREACHERS, BUT BECAUSE THE WORD WAS
[1:20:16] SPOKEN. AND IT'LL BE SO. A PROPHET OF
[1:20:19] GOD STOOD ON THE EARTH SAID THERE'LL BE
[1:20:20] A SWEEP COME OVER US. PAUL STOOD THERE
[1:20:22] AND SAID, "AND WE SHALL NOT ALL SLEEP,
[1:20:24] BUT WE SHALL ALL BE CHANGED IN A MOMENT,
[1:20:26] IN THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE, AND WE
[1:20:28] HALLELUJAH. We'll be gathered together
[1:20:30] with them to meet our Lord."
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; I got to
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; I got to move on.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, we ought TO REST ON THAT, CHURCH.
[1:20:44] THE WORD, IT WAS SPOKEN. IT WAS MADE. SO
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; YES,
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; you become a Christian BECAUSE GOD SPOKE
[1:20:49] HIS word and he made it come to pass.
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; Good sir.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; He talked about how Paul just didn't go
[1:20:58] when he come in the ship. He said, "Be
[1:20:59] of good courage." He said, "Not one of
[1:21:02] you is going to die." He didn't just do
[1:21:03] that because he felt sorry for him.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; He didn't do that because that he saw a
[1:21:08] vision.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; Right? God spoke to him. It was inspired
[1:21:11] to him. But I want to say to you today,
[1:21:14] the word has been inspired. I've told
[1:21:16] you before, GOD INSPIRED SOMETHING TO MY
[1:21:17] HEART. BROTHER DAVID, YOU HAVE THAT
[1:21:19] TESTIMONY. NONE OF MY KIDS ARE GOING TO
[1:21:20] BE LOST. GOD INSPIRED SOMETHING TO MY
[1:21:22] HEART. NONE OF MY KIDS ARE GOING TO BE
[1:21:24] LOST. I DON'T KNOW HOW IT'S GOING TO
[1:21:25] HAPPEN, BUT I KNOW IT'S AN INSPIRATION.
[1:21:27] IT'S MORE THAN JUST A WORD ON THE ON THE
[1:21:29] PAGE, BUT IT'S AN INSPIRATION. I KNOW
[1:21:31] THEY'RE GOING TO BE THERE.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:21:45] Brother Brandham talked about he said,
[1:21:47] "Your faith is all right, brother. Your
[1:21:49] faith is wonderful, but until the thing
[1:21:50] is inspired to you, talked about
[1:21:52] stopping at a red light." He said, "You
[1:21:54] sitting there and your your car is
[1:21:56] revving."
[1:21:58] I'm not reading all these quotes just to
[1:21:59] save time, but he said, "Your car is
[1:22:01] revving at the you got the your foot on
[1:22:02] the brake and the gas, you know, your
[1:22:05] car is you're getting ready to go, but
[1:22:07] he said until the green light comes,
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; you don't go. Just because you have the
[1:22:12] power to do it and the gas to do it,
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; right? And the car is firing doesn't
[1:22:16] mean you go. You go when the green light
[1:22:18] comes.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; One of these days, OH MY, WE'RE SITTING
[1:22:21] ON GO. WE'RE WAITING ON THE RAPTURE.
[1:22:23] SITTING ON GO. ONE OF THESE DAYS IT'S
[1:22:25] GOING TO GO. IT'S GOING TO BE TIME.
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; It'll be inspired to us.
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; But if it's going to be inspired, it's
[1:22:31] got to be in you already.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham continues on in that.
[1:22:35] He said, "The sons of went out and said,
[1:22:36] we adjure you in the name of Jesus who
[1:22:38] Paul preached, come out." He said,
[1:22:40] "Paul, I know. And Jesus, I know, but
[1:22:41] who are you?" See, it's got to be
[1:22:43] inspired to you.
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; And and and if it's going to be inspired
[1:22:47] to you, the time to get that inspiration
[1:22:49] or to get in the word for that
[1:22:51] inspiration is not when you need to cast
[1:22:52] out a devil,
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; but get right with God first,
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; then go and speak as you're inspired to
[1:22:58] speak.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; I know we talk about demons and things,
[1:23:02] and they weren't just a thing in the
[1:23:04] Bible, but we fight spiritual wickedness
[1:23:06] in heavenly places. I'm going somewhere
[1:23:08] this morning. So, you just hang with me.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; You said, "I thought you going to preach
[1:23:11] about the name." That's what we're
[1:23:12] preaching about.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; And we're going to get to where I'm
[1:23:15] going after a little while, but I'm
[1:23:17] almost out of time. Revelation chapter 9
[1:23:19] and verse 16
[1:23:21] talks about 200 million demons were
[1:23:24] bound in the river Euphrates that have
[1:23:25] been released.
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham talked about how they
[1:23:28] were released in the natural realm. We
[1:23:29] talked about some about it. So, I won't
[1:23:31] go over all of it. We talked some about
[1:23:32] it Wednesday night. They were released
[1:23:34] in the natural realm. Those spiritual
[1:23:36] horses, he said, were released. That
[1:23:38] Roman spirit, persecution of the Jews
[1:23:40] and Hitler and Ikeman, he said, but the
[1:23:42] bride won't go through the tribulation.
[1:23:44] They're perfected by his blood. And yet
[1:23:45] those spirits have been released. He
[1:23:48] said in in an ecclesiastical way,
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; right? An ecclesiastical spirit. He
[1:23:54] said, and made the statement. He said,
[1:23:55] "Now 20 years later after that war, the
[1:23:57] Second World War, and now we're some 60
[1:23:59] years beyond that or more." He said 2020
[1:24:03] years later after that war we see the
[1:24:04] loosing of the ecclesiastical spirit. He
[1:24:07] talked about how the moon darkened when
[1:24:08] the pope visited Jerusalem. He talked
[1:24:10] about how that they were loosed in
[1:24:11] flatteries and and cunningness and
[1:24:13] church right now. We're seeing that COME
[1:24:15] BACK AROUND AND we're seeing THINGS
[1:24:17] HAPPEN RIGHT NOW. PROPHECY BEING
[1:24:19] FULFILLED. A POPE FROM AMERICA GOING
[1:24:21] OVER AND SPEAKING AT THE VERY SPOT WHERE
[1:24:23] THE NIAN COUNCIL WAS held and and having
[1:24:26] COMMUNION WITH THE ORTHODOX CHURCH FOR
[1:24:28] THE FIRST TIME THAT THAT THAT THEY'VE
[1:24:30] DONE IT IN THAT WAY IN HISTORY. THESE
[1:24:32] THINGS ARE HAPPENING FOR A REASON. THE
[1:24:34] WORLD COUNCIL MEETING AGAIN, THAT'S ALL
[1:24:35] HAPPENED this year.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; WHERE ARE WE AT, CHURCH?
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; Those demons are real. They've been
[1:24:41] loose. They were loosed back then,
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; right? And they've been here,
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; and so we TALKED ABOUT HOW SOMETIMES WE
[1:24:49] FIGHT NATURAL battles or spiritual
[1:24:52] battles and we try to fight them in a
[1:24:53] natural way,
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; right? We get mad at one another, we get
[1:24:57] upset about the church or something like
[1:24:58] that. And in reality, that's not what we
[1:25:01] should do. We should recognize there's
[1:25:03] there's a spiritual warfare going on,
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; right? So, it's not your brother or your
[1:25:08] sister, but there's something going on.
[1:25:09] There's something in the air,
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; Right. You ever heard that?
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; Bunch of people start having kids in a
[1:25:15] city. They say, "There's something in
[1:25:16] the water."
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; Right? Well, there's something in the
[1:25:19] water.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; There's something in the air. Bunch of
[1:25:22] people start acting up.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; There's something in the air.
[1:25:27] people acting like demons and devils and
[1:25:29] then dressing like cats and dogs AND AND
[1:25:32] DOING ALL THAT THEY DO. THERE'S
[1:25:33] SOMETHING IN THE AIR.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; OH, BUT I'M SO GLAD THERE'S SOMETHING
[1:25:36] ELSE IN THE AIR OF PEOPLE SEATED IN
[1:25:38] HEAVENLY PLACES IN CHRIST JESUS.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; WHO ARE WARING AGAINST THAT THING.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; There's something in the air. It's not
[1:25:46] the people that are inspired by devils.
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; Huh? [snorts]
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; So, and brother Brandon said she's
[1:25:51] loosed. She's loosed to call all these
[1:25:54] little loose ends. Right. Revelation
[1:25:56] 10:7, he would tie up all the loose
[1:25:58] ends. The the the the the [snorts] uh
[1:26:01] mystery of God should be finished. That
[1:26:02] word finished is to tie up the loose
[1:26:04] ends. He said all these loose ends. Oh
[1:26:06] well, don't make any difference anyhow.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; Right? So that's the time we're living
[1:26:10] in. Those demons have been loosed among
[1:26:12] us.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; Right? But the Holy Spirit is also here
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; now. Now in the garden,
[1:26:21] see the woman in the garden. I want you
[1:26:24] to understand this because I heard this
[1:26:25] so much as a young Christian because in
[1:26:27] Genesis 3:4, you'll find it. I won't
[1:26:29] read it at the same time. But but here
[1:26:32] Eve is is talking to the serpent. And we
[1:26:35] heard a lot about that. Brother Brandham
[1:26:36] talks a lot about it. We heard a lot
[1:26:38] about that stressed on that how the
[1:26:40] woman fell and how we don't need to be
[1:26:42] like that woman. But brother Brandon
[1:26:43] makes a statement. There will be a bride
[1:26:44] who will not be like that.
[1:26:46] And
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; it won't be because they're smarter than
[1:26:48] Eve
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; or go to a better church than Eve did.
[1:26:52] It'd be hard to beat Eve's pastor.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; Just saying.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; Cuz God come down in the
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; cool of the evening, had church with
[1:27:05] them.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; It'd be hard to beat him,
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; right? So they had a good pastor.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; Everything was perfect. No trials, no
[1:27:12] trouble.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; No tribulation of any kind. [laughter]
[1:27:15] And yet she listened to the Satan's LIE
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE SHE HAD NOT BEEN SEALED.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; Brother Brand makes the statement the
[1:27:23] serpent got to her first.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; Her womb had not been sealed.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; Our womb, our spiritual womb is our mind
[1:27:30] and our heart. It's got TO BE SEALED.
[1:27:32] THERE'S GOT TO BE IT DROPS FROM HER
[1:27:34] MIND, GOES INTO OUR HEART. BUT THERE'S A
[1:27:36] PEOPLE WHOSE HEART WHO'S BEEN SEALED BY
[1:27:38] THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST, BY THE
[1:27:39] TOKEN IN THIS DAY. AND THEY CANNOT BE
[1:27:42] DECEIVED OR YOU WILL NOT BE LIKE EVE.
[1:27:44] YOU WILL NOT FALL LIKE YOU BECAUSE
[1:27:46] THERE'S A PEOPLE WHO have that. So you
[1:27:48] say, "Well, I don't want to be
[1:27:49] deceived." GET THE HOLY GHOST. Let him
[1:27:50] let him fill your life. Let him refill
[1:27:53] you over and over again.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; But you're only sealed once, but he'll
[1:27:58] refill you if you ask him.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; Good.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; But but it was a deceiving spirit that
[1:28:05] come to her and said, "God don't mean
[1:28:06] what he says. These little loose ends
[1:28:09] don't matter."
[1:28:11] the deceiving leot in spirit rich and
[1:28:13] increased with goods lukewarm halfway
[1:28:14] Christians deceived by Satan's lie.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; Oh church, it's a great thing in this
[1:28:20] hour. How will we resist this devil and
[1:28:22] cast him out
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; in his name?
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; James 4:7 says, "Submit yourselves
[1:28:27] therefore to God. Resist the devil and
[1:28:29] he'll flee from you."
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; Now, I want to look at this now as we
[1:28:34] kind of change course and we we get to
[1:28:37] the end here in just a moment.
[1:28:40] He only accepts worship in the place
[1:28:44] where he put his name.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; In the place where he put his name.
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; What was the place that he put his name?
[1:28:53] Brother Brandham explains that in God's
[1:28:55] only provided place of worship. He
[1:28:58] explains that and he goes to Deuteronomy
[1:29:00] 12:5. Unto the place which the Lord your
[1:29:02] God shall choose out of all your tribes
[1:29:04] to put his name there. Even unto his
[1:29:07] habitation shall you seek and thither
[1:29:10] thou shalt come. He what is the father's
[1:29:13] name? Think about it. Jesus said I come
[1:29:16] in the father's name. What is the
[1:29:17] father's name? That's the place where he
[1:29:19] wants us to worship is where his name
[1:29:21] is. Right? Matthew 1:23 is where brother
[1:29:24] Brandham takes us. Behold, a virgin
[1:29:25] shall be with child and shall bring
[1:29:27] forth a son and they shall call his name
[1:29:30] Emmanuel.
[1:29:32] Oh my. which being interpreted is God
[1:29:35] with us.
[1:29:38] God with us. Emmanuel.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; He said Emmanuel. His name was Jesus.
[1:29:47] God with us with his father's name.
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; Where's the place WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO
[1:29:54] PUT HIS NAME?
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; You're going TO PUT IT IN CHRIST.
[1:30:00] He puts his his name in Emmanuel.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; God with us. There's where God placed
[1:30:07] his name in his son.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE ONLY PLACE THAT YOU CAN
[1:30:12] WORSHIP HIM. I KNOW PEOPLE TEACH YOU
[1:30:13] HAVE TO WORSHIP AT THIS CHURCH OR THAT
[1:30:15] church or the bride's revival's OVER
[1:30:17] HERE OR THE BRIDE'S REVIVAL'S DOWN
[1:30:18] THERE. YOU GOT TO MOVE THIS PLACE OR
[1:30:20] THAT PLACE. I'M HERE TO TELL YOU IT'S
[1:30:22] IT'S IT'S NOT TRUE. COME ON.
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; MAYBE GOOD PEOPLE IN GOOD CHURCHES, BUT
[1:30:26] THAT'S NOT TRUE. HE SAID, "LO, WHEN THEY
[1:30:27] SHALL SAY UNTO YOU, HE'S IN A SECRET
[1:30:29] CORNER. He's in THE DESERT." HE SAID,
[1:30:31] "DON'T BELIEVE IT." HE SAID, "BUT BUT
[1:30:32] BUT THERE WILL COME A TIME WHEN YOU GOT
[1:30:34] TO WORSHIP GOD IN SPIRIT AND IN TRUTH."
[1:30:36] WHERE IS HE? HE'S RIGHT HERE WITH YOU.
[1:30:38] YOU WANT THE REVIVAL, THEN PARTICIPATE
[1:30:39] IN IT. YOU WANT TO BE IN A CHURCH ON
[1:30:41] FIRE, BE A CHURCH ON FIRE.
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; The only PLACE WHERE THAT GOD WILL EVER
[1:30:49] MEET YOU IS NOT THESE FOUR WALLS.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; That's right. CUZ SOMEDAY WE MAY HAVE TO
[1:30:54] TEAR THIS DOWN AND BUILD ANOTHER ONE
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; OR IT MIGHT BLOW AWAY IN A TORNADO. GOD
[1:30:58] FORBID,
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? BUT BUT THE IT MIGHT SHAKE DOWN
[1:31:01] IN AN EARTHQUAKE. EVERYTHING THAT MAN
[1:31:02] MADE IS GOING TO FAIL.
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; GOD DID NOT PLACE HIS NAME IN THESE FOUR
[1:31:06] WALLS, BUT HE PUT HIS NAME IN EMMANUEL.
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; He said the only place, that's the only
[1:31:14] place you're going to worship him. The
[1:31:15] only place God will ever meet you is in
[1:31:16] that sun, which was typed by the
[1:31:18] sacrificial lamb. So he meets you at his
[1:31:21] house.
[1:31:22] Hallelujah. His house was Christ. The
[1:31:25] Lord JESUS CHRIST WAS HIS HOUSE.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE BODY HE MADE. That's the Lord
[1:31:30] Jesus is his house. His son ALL DOWN
[1:31:32] THROUGH THE OLD TESTAMENT. ALL BROUGHT
[1:31:33] TYPES OF THAT ONE THING THAT THAT PLACE
[1:31:36] ALONE. WELL, GOD ALONE MET UNDER THE
[1:31:38] SACRIFICIAL BLOOD. It's the ONLY PLACE
[1:31:39] HE MET. THE ONLY PLACES HE MEETS TODAY
[1:31:42] IS NOT IN THE name of a CREED OR IN A
[1:31:44] NAME OF A DENOMINATION, A NAME OF A
[1:31:46] CHURCH OR A NAME OF A GROUP OR A NAME OF
[1:31:48] A SOCIETY, BUT IN THE NAME OF JESUS
[1:31:50] CHRIST. HOW MANY BELIEVE THAT TODAY THAT
[1:31:51] IF WE'RE MEETING TOGETHER, HE SAID WHERE
[1:31:53] TWO OR THREE ARE GATHERED TOGETHER IN MY
[1:31:55] NAME.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, I WILL BE THERE WITH THEM.
[1:31:58] EMMANUEL, GOD WITH US.
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:04] Amen. Can we go just a little bit
[1:32:06] further?
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; In my name, they shall cast out devils.
[1:32:10] He said that's the name of the father.
[1:32:12] He put his name in Jesus Christ and in
[1:32:13] him he meets to worship.
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In him he MEETS TO CAST OUT
[1:32:20] DEVILS.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, THE DEVILS YOU MEET MAY NOT BE
[1:32:23] HERE AT THE CHURCH. THEY MAY BE AT HOME.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; YOU MAY NEED TO CAST OUT A DEVIL OUT OF
[1:32:27] YOUR OWN HOME.
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; YOU MAY NEED TO CAST OUT A DEVIL GOING
[1:32:30] ON DOWN THE STREET OR WHATEVER IT IS,
[1:32:32] BUT YOU HE DIDN'T JUST SAY YOU CAN CAST
[1:32:34] OUT DEVILS IN THE CHURCH. BUT IN MY
[1:32:35] NAME, THEY SHALL CAST OUT DEVILS.
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; And he never said that ONLY A PREACHER
[1:32:39] CAN CAST OUT DEVILS. HE NEVER SAID ONLY
[1:32:41] A PREACHER COULD PRAY FOR THE SICK. BUT
[1:32:43] HE SAID IN MY NAME, THE BELIEVERS,
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; THEY SHALL CAST OUT DEVILS. THEY'LL PRAY
[1:32:48] FOR THE SICK IF THEY DRINK ANY DEADLY
[1:32:50] thing that won't harm them. Oh, listen.
[1:32:52] You're bulletproof, CHURCH.
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU with me now?
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:59] Amen. In him. In what? The name. You
[1:33:01] young people understand that. In the
[1:33:03] name.
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; In him. He said he meets to save and
[1:33:08] filled with the HOLY GHOST. THAT'S GOD'S
[1:33:11] ONLY PLACE TO meet people for worship.
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There's so many infallible
[1:33:17] proofs that Jesus is the place. HE'S THE
[1:33:19] GATE. HE'S THE NAME AND THE ONLY
[1:33:20] PROVIDED WAY THAT GOD HAS FOR man to
[1:33:23] meet and worship. He is the way, the
[1:33:25] truth, the life, the gate, the door. Are
[1:33:29] you beginning TO GET THE PICTURE? THE
[1:33:31] ALPHA, THE OMEGA, THE BEGINNING AND
[1:33:33] ENDING, ROSE OF SHARON, LILY OF THE
[1:33:34] VALLEY, THE MORNING STAR, THE ALPHA AND
[1:33:36] THE OMEGA. HE IS ALL THE WHOLE THING PUT
[1:33:40] TOGETHER. HE SAID, "HE IS BOTH ROOT AND
[1:33:42] OFFSPRING OF DAVID, THE BRIDE AND
[1:33:43] MORNING STAR, AND HIM DWELLS THE
[1:33:44] FULLNESS OF THE GODHEAD BODILY. WHERE WE
[1:33:47] IN THERE ARE SONS AND DAUGHTERS TO GOD
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; in God's Godhead."
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; I hope you hear me. I know some of y'all
[1:33:55] are hurting this morning and you're
[1:33:57] maybe you're sick and body. Some of
[1:33:58] y'all going through some serious TRIALS
[1:34:00] IN YOUR LIFE. BUT IF YOU JUST LISTEN FOR
[1:34:02] JUST A MOMENT, LISTEN, THAT'S THAT'S
[1:34:04] WHERE WE ARE. THAT'S OUR POSITION. DON'T
[1:34:06] LET THE DEVIL BEAT YOU OUT OF THAT AND
[1:34:07] SAY, "CUZ YOU'RE GOING THROUGH
[1:34:08] SOMETHING." NO, YOU'RE IN HIS NAME.
[1:34:10] YOU'RE YOU BELONG TO HIM. IF YOU'VE EVER
[1:34:13] BEEN SAVED, IF YOU'VE EVER RECEIVED THE
[1:34:14] BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST, YOU BELONG TO
[1:34:16] HIM.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; AND THAT LUKEWARM, COLD, FORMAL SPIRIT
[1:34:21] TRYING TO MAKE YOU DISINTERESTED IN
[1:34:22] CHURCH, TRYING TO PULL YOU OUT OF THE
[1:34:23] HOUSE OF GOD WHEN YOU NEED TO REBUKE
[1:34:25] THAT IN HIS NAME.
[1:34:28] [applause and cheering]
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. He said, "Yes, as sons and
[1:34:33] daughters, we're in the family." If
[1:34:34] you're in there and you get in the
[1:34:37] family 1 Corinthians 12:13, for by one
[1:34:38] spirit are we all baptized into one
[1:34:41] body, the bride not only speaks in his
[1:34:44] name. We don't always only talk about
[1:34:45] Jesus, but we live in his name.
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; In him we live and move and have our
[1:34:51] being.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; We were inspired to live in heavenly
[1:34:54] places. Even though the age is lukewarm
[1:34:56] and backslid, DECEIVED BY SATAN'S LIE.
[1:34:59] THAT'S NOT MY STORY.
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; COME ON.
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:35:03] Some of you COME FROM ROUGH BACKGROUNDS.
[1:35:05] I KNOW SOME OF Y'ALL'S BACKGROUNDS. I
[1:35:07] KNOW MY BACKGROUND. I KNOW SOME OF Y'ALL
[1:35:08] COME THROUGH SOME THINGS. I'VE BEEN
[1:35:10] THROUGH SOME THINGS. WE'VE ALL GOT A
[1:35:11] STORY. BUT THAT'S NOT THE END OF OUR
[1:35:13] STORY. YOU MIGHT HAVE COME THROUGH SOME
[1:35:15] THINGS, BUT GOD WASN'T DONE WITH YOU
[1:35:17] YET. YOU MIGHT HAVE FACED SOME TRIALS,
[1:35:18] BUT GOD WASN'T DONE WITH YOU. ARE YOU
[1:35:20] HEARING ME THIS MORNING? HE HE WANTS TO
[1:35:22] BRING YOU INTO HIS BODY, INTO HIS NAME.
[1:35:25] BY ONE SPIRIT, WE'RE BAPTIZED INTO THAT
[1:35:27] BODY.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YOU MIGHT BE TIRED THIS
[1:35:30] MORNING, BUT YOU'RE IN HIS NAME. YOU
[1:35:32] MIGHT OH MY YOU YOU MIGHT BE WEARY BUT
[1:35:34] YOU'RE YOU MIGHT BE SICK BUT YOU'RE IN
[1:35:36] HIS NAME.
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; You belong to him.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother Brandon said now
[1:35:42] we've already resurrected the dynamics
[1:35:43] and the mechanics has gone to work
[1:35:45] quickened us and we're quickened up into
[1:35:46] the presence of God where his spirit is.
[1:35:49] WE'RE A PART OF IT. IF YOU'RE PART OF
[1:35:50] THE BRIDE, YOU ARE BECAUSE THE BRIDE IS
[1:35:52] PART OF THE GROOM, YOU KNOW. SO WE FIND
[1:35:54] OUT IT'S THE SAME THING AND SHE'LL DO
[1:35:56] JUST EXACTLY WHAT'S PREDICTED FOR HER TO
[1:35:58] DO IN THIS DAY. SHE WON'T BE A LEOA. NOT
[1:36:02] BY NO MEANS A LUKEWARM, BUT SHE'LL BE ON
[1:36:04] FIRE FOR GOD. SHE'LL BE MOVING ON IN THE
[1:36:06] spirit of God.
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:10] John 5:43, I am come in my father's
[1:36:13] name.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; He said, "You receive me not. If another
[1:36:16] shall come in his own name, him you'll
[1:36:18] receive."
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; But the ram said, "The father put his
[1:36:21] own name, which is Jesus, in the Son,
[1:36:26] [snorts] and he's the way. He's the
[1:36:28] door. He's the house.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; He's where God chose to put his name.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; He said God never put his name in me.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; God never put his name in me.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; He never PUT IT IN THE CHURCH.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; HE NEVER PUT IT IN THE METHODIST,
[1:36:45] BAPTIST, CATHOLIC.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; HE PUT IT IN CHRIST, THE ANOINTED
[1:36:48] EMMANUEL.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; And the name is IN THE WORD
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE IS THE WORD.
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; AMEN. What is he then? The word
[1:36:57] interpreted. This is powerful. Is the
[1:36:59] manifestation
[1:37:01] of the name of God.
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; The word interpreted is the
[1:37:06] manifestation
[1:37:07] of the name of God. THEN WHAT WAS THE
[1:37:09] OPENING OF THE WORD IN OUR DAY? IT'S THE
[1:37:11] MANIFESTATION. WHAT WAS THE OPENING OF
[1:37:12] THE SEALS? WHAT WAS GOD DOING IN OUR
[1:37:14] DAY? IT WAS THE MANIFESTATION OF THE
[1:37:16] NAME OF GOD SHOWING US HIS ATTRIBUTES.
[1:37:19] SHOWING US HIS PRESENCE. SHOWING US
[1:37:20] THAT. OH, COME ON, CHURCH. HE'S ALREADY
[1:37:22] HERE WITH US. SHOWING US THE SAME
[1:37:24] YESTERDAY, TODAY, AND FOREVER. SHOWING
[1:37:26] US HE'S STILL A HEALER, SHOWING US HE'S
[1:37:28] STILL A SAVIOR.
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [screaming] WHEN THE WORLD'S
[1:37:30] GONE CRAZY AND 200 MILLION DEMONS HAVE
[1:37:33] BEEN RELEASED EVEN ON THE BRIDE, BUT WE
[1:37:35] KNOW, HALLELUJAH, WE KNOW HIS NAME. AND
[1:37:38] THE NAME IS IN THE WORD, and the word IS
[1:37:40] INTERPRETED AS THE MANIFESTATION OF THE
[1:37:42] name of God.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; He said, "No wonder flesh and blood has
[1:37:46] not revealed this to you, but my father
[1:37:47] which is in heaven has revealed this to
[1:37:49] you who I am. AND UPON THIS ROCK, I'LL
[1:37:51] BUILD MY PLACE OF WORSHIP, AND THE GATES
[1:37:53] OF HELL CAN'T SHAKE IT DOWN." LISTEN,
[1:37:55] THINGS COULD HAPPEN TO THIS CHURCH, BUT
[1:37:57] THERE WILL BE NOTHING SHAKE DOWN THE
[1:37:59] NAME OF GOD AND THE CHURCH OF GOD WHICH
[1:38:01] IS BUILT BY REVELATION OF HIS NAME.
[1:38:04] THERE'LL BE NOTHING SHAKE THAT CHURCH.
[1:38:06] THIS PLACE MIGHT BE SHAKEN. EVERYTHING
[1:38:08] THAT CAN BE SHAKEN WILL BE SHAKEN. BUT
[1:38:10] THAT CHURCH OF GOD will never
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; shake down. I want to be part of it.
[1:38:14] Don't you?
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, he said he said, "Amen. Oh living
[1:38:18] church of God, stand in firm foundation
[1:38:21] on Jesus Christ alone."
[1:38:24] Oh,
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; we we don't owe allegiance to any other
[1:38:28] name
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; but the name of Jesus.
[1:38:32] [snorts]
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; The message reveals that to us. That's
[1:38:34] why I believe the message.
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; The prophet stood there and said,
[1:38:37] "Behold the lamb of God."
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; He revealed Jesus to me. God in a
[1:38:46] prophet revealed Jesus to me.
[1:38:52] How do you fight one of them 200 million
[1:38:55] demons that comes down that spirit of
[1:38:57] depression? In his name.
[1:39:00] How do you get rid of a demon of cancer?
[1:39:04] In his name. [snorts]
[1:39:07] H how do you raise your family? In his
[1:39:09] name.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; How do I bring my loved ones in? You're
[1:39:13] gonna get it after a while.
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, if I repeat it, he's going
[1:39:16] to preach longer." But [snorts]
[1:39:19] Listen, it's time to pick up our shield
[1:39:21] of faith. I'm I'm nearly done.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; Pick up our shield of faith. What we
[1:39:24] left off with on Wednesday night, you'll
[1:39:27] find that in Ephesians 6. If you go to
[1:39:28] Ephesians 6 and look at the the action
[1:39:31] words in that verse,
[1:39:34] it's take and stand.
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; Take
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; the shield of faith
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; and stand.
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; Take the sword of the spirit,
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; And stand. Right?
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; What are you standing in?
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; Who are you standing on?
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; On stand firm on Jesus Christ alone.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; Stand in his name. Paul tells us to
[1:40:01] stand and and and take. You remember in
[1:40:05] the book of Revelation, Revelation 10:8,
[1:40:07] John is told to take the little book,
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; right? Go and take the little book
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; from the hand of him that sits on the
[1:40:14] throne. Stand in his name and you'll win
[1:40:17] every battle.
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT STANDING ON OUR OWN. WE'RE NOT
[1:40:22] EVEN STANDING JUST WITH OUR CHURCH OR
[1:40:23] THE PEOPLE SITTING HERE. WE'RE STANDING
[1:40:25] in his name.
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; IN HIS NAME, YOU CAN STAND AGAINST THE
[1:40:28] ONSLAUGHT OF THE ENEMY. LISTEN TO ME.
[1:40:30] YOU YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE IN SCHOOL,
[1:40:32] STAND IN HIS NAME. YOU THAT ARE
[1:40:34] HOMESCHOOLED, STAND IN HIS NAME. OH,
[1:40:36] COME ON. I KNOW THERE WILL BE PROBLEMS
[1:40:37] IN CHURCH. THERE'LL BE PROBLEMS IN THE
[1:40:39] YOUTH GROUP. THERE WILL BE PROBLEMS ALL
[1:40:40] AROUND. WE'RE A REGULAR CHURCH. IT'S NOT
[1:40:42] A UTOPIA. WE'RE A BUNCH OF BELIEVERS,
[1:40:44] BUT WE'RE ALL WE'VE ALL GOT FLESH. WE'VE
[1:40:46] ALL GOT A STICKY NATURE, BUT IN HIS
[1:40:48] NAME, WE STAND. WE GOT SOMETHING BIGGER
[1:40:50] GOING ON. IN HIS NAME, come on, CHURCH.
[1:40:53] IN HIS NAME, WE FIGHT OUR BATTLES.
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:40:58] I'm closing with this. Musicians, go
[1:41:00] ahead and come
[1:41:03] there. I was reading recently about the
[1:41:05] Second World War, and I love history. I
[1:41:07] was reading about the Second World War
[1:41:08] and and [snorts] I was reading about a
[1:41:11] man named Teddy Roosevelt Jr. Now the
[1:41:13] famous Teddy Roosevelt was his father
[1:41:16] and you [snorts] know they say like
[1:41:18] father like son his his son was quite a
[1:41:20] character as well. He fought in the
[1:41:22] First World War and was injured. And
[1:41:24] then he [snorts]
[1:41:26] he had a he had a desire to make sure
[1:41:30] that the Normandy landings at D-Day
[1:41:33] happened correctly and that everything
[1:41:35] was done right and that they had good
[1:41:36] maps of the area, things like that. And
[1:41:39] so what he did is he actually
[1:41:44] he asked him, he petitioned him, he
[1:41:46] said, "Let me go in with the first wave
[1:41:48] on Utah Beach." Now, by this time he was
[1:41:52] 56 years old
[1:41:54] and he used a cane cuz he had arthritis,
[1:41:58] crippling arthritis. He was a one-star
[1:42:01] general. Generals didn't go into battle
[1:42:03] like that. I'm so glad ours did.
[1:42:07] But he was a one-star general and and he
[1:42:11] was 56 years old. USED A CANE TO walk
[1:42:13] and he had severe heart disease. In
[1:42:15] fact, he died about a month later, I
[1:42:17] believe it was, after he made the
[1:42:19] landing.
[1:42:20] with heart disease.
[1:42:23] He was the only general to land in the
[1:42:24] first wave. When they landed, they
[1:42:27] landed about a mile from their objective
[1:42:29] cuz they didn't have all the GPS and
[1:42:31] things that we do now. So, they kind of
[1:42:34] went in blindly and they didn't have any
[1:42:35] scope what was going on. So, that
[1:42:38] landing might have failed if he hadn't
[1:42:40] have been there because the general
[1:42:41] needed to see where to place the troops
[1:42:44] and things. So he was one of the first
[1:42:46] two men that hit the beach at Normandy
[1:42:48] at Utah Beach. And when he did that,
[1:42:52] everybody, you know, when they hit the
[1:42:53] beach, they fell to the ground. But not
[1:42:56] Teddy Roosevelt Jr.
[1:42:59] He just stood up. He had a cane, but he
[1:43:02] stood.
[1:43:04] He was limping. He was hurting. HE WAS
[1:43:07] SICK, BUT HE STOOD.
[1:43:09] Some of Y'ALL ARE HERE THIS MORNING.
[1:43:10] BROTHER MILL, YOU COME TO CHURCH THIS
[1:43:12] MORNING, YOU'RE STANDING. YOU MAY BE
[1:43:14] SEATED IN YOUR SEAT RIGHT NOW, BUT
[1:43:15] YOU'RE STANDING STANDING THERE ON THE
[1:43:17] BEACH. AND THEM YOUNG MEN LOOKED AT HIM.
[1:43:19] AND SOME OF THE YOUNG MEN LATER
[1:43:20] TESTIFIED. WE THOUGHT, "WELL, IF HE'S
[1:43:22] standing up, IT MUST NOT BE THAT BAD."
[1:43:26] Listen to me, church. There's other
[1:43:27] PEOPLE WATCHING YOUR LIFE. YOUR CHILDREN
[1:43:29] ARE WATCHING YOUR LIFE. YOUR
[1:43:30] GRANDCHILDREN ARE WATCHING. THERE'S
[1:43:32] PEOPLE ALL AROUND YOU. WE'RE FIGHTING A
[1:43:34] BATTLE. THERE'S BULLETS FLYING
[1:43:35] EVERYWHERE. LET ME BE SOMEBODY WHO
[1:43:38] STANDS UP REGARDLESS OF MY CONDITION,
[1:43:40] REGARDLESS OF MY WEAKNESS. LET ME BE
[1:43:42] SOMEBODY THOUGH I MIGHT HAVE A CANE. I
[1:43:44] MIGHT WALK WITH A LIMB. BUT LET ME BE
[1:43:46] SOMEONE WHO will stand in the battle.
[1:43:48] STAND AND FACE THE BULLETS. STAND
[1:43:50] AGAINST the heat of the sun. Say I I
[1:43:54] believe. I'm not standing alone. Why was
[1:43:56] Teddy Roosevelt standing there? He
[1:43:58] [music] believed in the United States.
[1:44:00] He believed IN OUR FORM OF GOVERNMENT.
[1:44:02] HE BELIEVED IN DEMOCRACY. HE BELIEVED HE
[1:44:04] BELIEVED THAT IT WAS GREATER THAN EVERY
[1:44:06] EVIL THING THAT THE NAZIS COULD PUT OUT.
[1:44:08] HE BELIEVED IN WHAT HE BELIEVED IN. He
[1:44:10] believed in the US. HE BELIEVED THEY
[1:44:11] WERE STANDING BEHIND HIM AND HE WASN'T
[1:44:13] STANDING ALONE. BUT ALL THE MIGHT OF
[1:44:15] THAT GREAT COUNTRY WAS STANDING WITH
[1:44:16] HIM. OH CHURCH, IF WE CAN ONLY
[1:44:17] UNDERSTAND, YOU ARE NOT STANDING ALONE
[1:44:20] TODAY. LISTEN YOUNG PERSON, YOU'RE NOT
[1:44:22] STANDING ALONE IN THE BATTLE. YOU'RE NOT
[1:44:23] STANDING ALONE AT SCHOOL. YOU'RE NOT
[1:44:26] STANDING ALONE AT WORK.
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU MAKE THAT STAND, WHEN YOU
[1:44:29] CHOOSE TO LIVE A HOLY AND PURE LIFE,
[1:44:31] WHEN YOU CHOOSE TO LIVE FOR GOD, WHEN
[1:44:32] YOU CHOOSE TO BE BAPTIZED IN HIS NAME,
[1:44:34] YOU ARE NOT STANDING ALONE. HE IS THERE
[1:44:37] WITH YOU. YOU are standing in his name.
[1:44:40] He said, "Stand alone with Jesus on that
[1:44:43] firm foundation. In his name, I'll cast
[1:44:47] out devils. In his name, they'll stand.
[1:44:51] Let me be one who stands." Would you
[1:44:52] stand with me today? Hallelujah.
[1:44:55] Oh, let me be one that stands. In the
[1:44:58] hour of temptation, which is the hour
[1:45:00] we're living in, the hour when THOSE
[1:45:02] DEMONS ARE TRYING TO TELL YOU the
[1:45:04] message doesn't matter. Doesn't matter
[1:45:05] how you do this or that OR THE OTHER.
[1:45:07] STAND THEREFORE.
[1:45:09] HALLELUJAH.
[1:45:11] HALLELUJAH. Your loins g WITH TRUTH AND
[1:45:13] THE BREASTPLATE OF RIGHTEOUSNESS AND THE
[1:45:15] SHIELD OF FAITH. TAKE IT. STAND. Take
[1:45:18] the sword of the spirit which is the
[1:45:21] word of God. Stand against him. Be a
[1:45:24] hero and the strife. As long said, don't
[1:45:27] be like dumb driven cattle just doing
[1:45:29] what the world does going with every
[1:45:32] whim of culture. Let's stand church.
[1:45:35] LET'S NOT BE JUST ANOTHER CHURCH,
[1:45:37] another place where people gather. Let's
[1:45:39] stand.
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; OTHER PEOPLE CAN DO THAT. YOU SAY,
[1:45:42] "WELL, EVERYBODY ELSE DOES THIS AND
[1:45:43] MAKES THESE DECISIONS." You stand.
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; If you don't WANT YOUR KIDS COWERING
[1:45:51] DOWN IN THE FACE OF OPPOSITION, STAND
[1:45:53] TODAY.
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; If you DON'T WANT YOUR GRANDKIDS
[1:45:56] COWERING DOWN IN THE FACE OF OPPOSITION,
[1:45:58] IF YOU DON'T WANT THEM LIVING A HALF
[1:46:00] COLD BACKSEAT LIFE, THEN STAND TODAY.
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:46:05] I don't know who I'm talking to today.
[1:46:07] Maybe it's just me. But I need to be
[1:46:10] Lord. I have that commitment in my
[1:46:12] heart. Let me stand
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; in the hour of adversity.
[1:46:16] Let me stand cuz I know I'm standing in
[1:46:18] your name.
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [singing]
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; I am bow down.
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; Just sing it to me before we pray.

[1:53:57] I'm ser [singing]
[1:54:08] now Jesus. There's something about
[1:54:11] let's just worship him before we go into
[1:54:14] this. His presence is here this morning.
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. While he's here, we have a
[1:54:22] need to reach out and touch him today.
[1:54:24] Oh Jesus.
[1:54:27] She loves us.
[1:54:30] I'm Jesus.
[1:54:33] [music]
[1:54:35] There's just something
[1:54:38] about
[1:54:41] that name. [music]
[1:54:46] He's my master
[1:54:49] savior. [singing]
[1:54:52] Jesus
[1:54:54] [music]
[1:54:56] like a fragrance
[1:55:00] after
[1:55:02] the rain.
[1:55:05] [singing and music]
[1:55:08] Jesus,
[1:55:10] [music] Jesus,
[1:55:13] Jesus.
[1:55:15] [singing and music]
[1:55:17] Let all heaven
[1:55:20] and earth
[1:55:23] proclaim
[1:55:25] [music]
[1:55:28] that kings
[1:55:30] and kingdom [music and singing]
[1:55:33] will all
[1:55:35] say. [music]
[1:55:37] Oh, but there's [singing] something
[1:55:41] that
[1:55:44] we're going to sing out loud and play
[1:55:46] quietly. I want I want your voice to
[1:55:48] speak his name this morning.
[1:55:50] &gt;&gt; Speak the name of Jesus.
[1:55:53] &gt;&gt; Tell him Jesus. There's something about
[1:55:55] your name.
[1:55:57] &gt;&gt; You may be a difficult situation. You
[1:55:58] may have something on your mind, but
[1:56:00] just for [clears throat] a moment, speak
[1:56:01] his name before we go. I believe it's
[1:56:04] the mention of his name. The first time
[1:56:06] his name was ever spoken in this earth,
[1:56:08] there was a dead baby in the womb.
[1:56:12] &gt;&gt; We know he does that, don't we?
[1:56:16] &gt;&gt; Was a dead baby [singing] in a womb. And
[1:56:18] it was John the Baptist.
[1:56:20] &gt;&gt; And when she said, "His name is Jesus."
[1:56:25] That word Jesus was spoken, that baby
[1:56:27] leaps for joy.
[1:56:30] Or maybe he's still Jesus.
[1:56:32] Amen. You have God with us. The place
[1:56:35] where he put his name.
[1:56:38] Hallelujah. Why don't we worship him
[1:56:39] together now? We sing.
[1:56:42] There's just something
[1:56:45] about [singing]
[1:56:47] that name.
[1:56:49] [music]
[1:56:53] &gt;&gt; Kings
[1:56:55] [singing] and [music] kingdoms
[1:56:58] &gt;&gt; will all
[1:57:00] pass away. [music]
[1:57:02] But there's [singing] something
[1:57:06] about
[1:57:08] that.
[1:57:09] &gt;&gt; That way one more time your hands tell
[1:57:11] him.
[1:57:12] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. [music and singing]
[1:57:17] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[1:57:19] Oh Jesus.
[1:57:23] &gt;&gt; There's [singing]
[1:57:24] just something
[1:57:27] about
[1:57:29] that name. Amen. [singing]
[1:57:33] Oh,
[1:57:35] &gt;&gt; he's master
[1:57:37] your
[1:57:40] Jesus. [music]
[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; Like the fragrance
[1:57:48] after
[1:57:50] the rain.
[1:57:52] [singing]
[1:57:55] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus.
[1:57:58] Jesus.
[1:58:01] Jesus.
[1:58:05] Let all heavens
[1:58:09] and earth
[1:58:12] proclaim.
[1:58:14] [music]
[1:58:16] Oh king
[1:58:19] and kingdoms
[1:58:22] will all
[1:58:24] pass away.
[1:58:26] But there's something
[1:58:28] [singing and music]
[1:58:30] about
[1:58:32] that.
[1:58:40] &gt;&gt; Lord, there may be some need in this
[1:58:41] audience.
[1:58:45] Lord, we're just asking you today to
[1:58:47] come,
[1:58:49] Lord, to meet that need.
[1:58:52] Oh God, whatever it is, we believe that
[1:58:54] you're the almighty God.
[1:58:57] you're able, Lord, to heal and to save
[1:58:59] and to deliver. Lord, if there's trouble
[1:59:02] in a home, I pray you'd you'd steal the
[1:59:05] storm like you did on the Sea of
[1:59:06] Galilee.
[1:59:08] Lord, if there's
[1:59:10] if there's sickness, may you heal the
[1:59:12] sick like you cleanse the leper.
[1:59:15] that there's sin in a heart. Lord, may
[1:59:19] you be one who speaks and says, "Neither
[1:59:22] do I condemn thee. Go and sin no more."
[1:59:25] I pray you grant it today,
[1:59:28] Lord. May you speak through us. May we
[1:59:31] be standing in your name and this day,
[1:59:33] oh God. Lord, be the manifestation of
[1:59:36] the word in our hour. Pray you grant it,
[1:59:39] oh God. Speak through your children,
[1:59:41] Lord. Speak healing and peace and love.
[1:59:44] and brotherly kindness and gentleness,
[1:59:47] all the fruits of the spirit. Pray you'd
[1:59:49] grant it now. May we speak your word and
[1:59:52] believe it. Go forward and stand. We
[1:59:55] pray in Jesus name. Hallelujah.
[1:59:59] Hallelujah. God bless you this morning.
[2:00:01] Hallelujah. Let's worship him a moment
[2:00:04] and we'll go. [music] Hallelujah.
[2:00:06] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[2:00:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:10] Oh, isn't he wonderful today?
[2:00:14] [music]
[2:00:16] &gt;&gt; There is just something

[2:00:26] [music]
[2:00:26] He's [singing] my master.
[2:00:30] &gt;&gt; Savior.
[2:00:33] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[2:00:37] Like a fragrance.
[2:00:41] after [singing]
[2:00:43] the rain.
[2:00:47] He's [singing] my Jesus.
[2:00:51] [music] Jesus.
[2:00:54] Jesus. [singing]
[2:00:58] Let all heavens [music]
[2:01:04] proclaim. [music and singing]
[2:01:09] Kings [music and singing]
[2:01:11] and kingdoms
[2:01:14] will all
[2:01:16] pass away.
[2:01:19] But there's something [singing]
[2:01:22] about
[2:01:24] that name. [singing]
[2:01:26] aren't thankful for [music] the word of
[2:01:28] the Lord this morning. Amen. Can you
