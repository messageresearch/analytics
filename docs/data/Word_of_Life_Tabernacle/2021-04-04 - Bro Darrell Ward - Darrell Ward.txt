confusion and all that's happening in the fake news and all this that we are a people gathered here tonight on truth what a privileged people we are amen if you have your bibles as either turn with us to the book of mark we only read from mark chapter 10 verse 35 starting at verse 35 we greet you in the name of the lord jesus and count it's such an honor to be able to be with you once again and i always enjoy coming to arkansas i was was talking in the back room back there i cut my teeth down here in arkansas one of the first places the lord allowed me to come to when i started preaching many many years ago up in the old place called camp up there on the side of the road i'm sure some of you remember those times and oh my won't it be wonderful when we all gather home and the years that we've served together and labor together and what a wonderful time it'll be don't miss it friends whatever it takes young people don't miss it there is nothing and they ought to see it worth missing it over amen hang on to jesus let go of the world hang on to jesus amen we counted an honor to be here may the lord richly bless you each one coming out we appreciate brother ben allowing us to come we realize on easter he could have a lot of great men of god to come and minister and yet he allowed us to come and so we're grateful for that thank you buddy and may the lord richly bless you let's read now from mark chapter 10 verse 35 hallelujah and james and john the sons of zebedee coming to him saying master we would that thou should do for us whatsoever we shall desire and he said unto them what would ye that i should do for you and they said unto him grant unto us that we may sit on thy right hand and the other on thy left hand in thy glory what a great request amen but jesus said unto them ye know not what she asked can ye drink of the cup i drink of and be baptized with the baptism that i am baptized with and they said unto him boy i like their faith they said unto him we can and jesus said unto them ye shall indeed drink of the cup that i drink of and with the baptism that i am baptized with shall ye be baptized amen let us bow our heads i want to speak to you for a few minutes this evening on ye shall indeed heavenly father lord we are so grateful this evening to gather here in your name and lord it's with thanksgiving in our hearts that we come before you in prayer for lord in this time of the season that we are in of easter it means so much to us lord it wasn't enough that you were born it wasn't enough that you ministered and did miracles it wasn't even enough that you went to calvary and died for lord if you had not raised hallelujah we would still be lost in our sins but oh god easter means so much to us lord because we can point to an empty tomb lord knowing that the grave could not hold you and the life that you lived has been sent back upon the church lord and father i pray tonight in this hour that we're living in lord may our understanding of our hearts lord be illuminated by your word that we could see who we are in the word lord for your prophet taught us dear god that you had perfect faith when you were here because you knew who you were in the word and oh god may we see tonight that we are not church members dear god we are not an organization or a denomination but we are sons and daughters of god we are your people lord in the workmanship of your hand i pray father tonight may the same anointing that raise my lord from the grave may that same anointing tonight move upon every need that's in this building lord that when we leave the service may we say did not our hearts burn within us for you vindicated your presence among us lord bless brother ben the officers of the church bless the ministers that are here lord we ask that you bless their ministries in a great way use them dear god in this last day that the world once more may know that you're the same yesterday today and forever lord i surrender myself into your hands may you use me tonight we pray for we ask these things in jesus name and the bride says amen god bless you since you may be seated you know i am so happy what easter means for us and what easter has done for us you see to the world easter is about bunnies and coloring eggs and chocolate eggs and all the things that they do and hanging eggs on a tree that's the world's interpretation of easter but easter means much more than that to us amen but easter is the promise that we hold in our heart of the resurrection amen that the life he lived could be sent back to us and i am so glad that we can point to an empty tomb today and say he is not there and we they can say how do you know he's not there i know he's not in that tomb because he is in my heart amen making himself the same yesterday today and forever now in our scripture reading this evening we find in the bible there are two accounts of this event mark says it was james and john who asked jesus this question and matthew says it was their mother that asked jesus this question but both matthew and mark they both agree that it was james and john who answered we can and i believe this evening that every person in this building by faith and the grace of almighty god tonight that we can answer the same question with we can amen we can cast out devils we can live a godly life we can't overcome laodicea amen we can now we find in this passage that they were asking a question they were desiring a position in his kingdom one was wanting to sit in his right hand and the other was wanting to sit in his left hand and jesus said unto them you don't know what you're asking you want to be a part of this kingdom you want to be a part of this program you want to be a part of what's happening he said can you drink of this cup that i drink can you be baptized with this baptism that i am baptized with notice he never sent a cup he never said a cup he said this cup and he never said a baptism but he said this baptism this cup this baptism the same cup the same baptism and they said we can and jesus said ye shall not maybe not could be not hope so but ye shall indeed amen and be baptized with this baptism yes amen the same cup the same baptism jesus said ye shall indeed that ought to give every one of us courage tonight that ought to give every one of us faith tonight that jesus said we can like elijah and elisha in the bible elisha followed him for 10 years and it came to pass that when elijah was going to leave the scene he asked elisha what do you want from me you followed me all these years what do you want notice what elisha said he didn't say i want the i want your ministry but he said i want a double portion of your ministry and elijah said you have asked a hard thing but nevertheless if you see me when i go you shall come on there's that word again ye shall have what you asked for so what did it do and he like it called elisha to have a singleness of mine a scenario survive a singleness of motive a singleness of purpose and that was to keep his eyes on elijah and when elijah went up elisha began to cry out you promised me that i could have the ministry that you had a double portion of it and down out of heaven came the mantle the same mantle that elijah struck the water and the water parted and he went over now elisha picks up the same mantle not amen mantle but the same mantle and he goes back to the same water with the same mantle with the same anointing and he strikes the water same water same god come on same anointing same metal and he got the same results he stuck the water he said where is the god of elijah he wasn't asking a question he was making a statement where is the god that anointed elijah where is the god that anointed jesus christ he's in the bride today amen where is the god of elijah he was making a statement the same god that was with elijah it's now with elisha amen took the same mantle to the same water with the same god and got the same results because it was the same ministry elijah did four great miracles elisha done eight a double portion you see greater not in quality not in quality because he's parted the same water elijah did with the same anointing so it wasn't a greater quality but it was a greater quality more works than this shall you do elijah done for elisha danny showed he had a double portion of the same ministry look at ruth and boaz ruth followed the instructions of naomi she goes down to the threshing floor in the barley season naomi said cover yourself go down there mark the spot where he lays and when he lays down you lay down at his feet amen and about the midnight hour boaz awoke there's a lot of people awakening amen in the midnight hour boaz awoke and he said who's here who's here who's there and she said it's ruth thy handmaid spread thy skirt thy garment spread thy garment over me for thou art a near kinsman and boaz spread his garment over ruth not another garment the same garment amen and the bible said she rose up early in the morning and he said take your veil and he measured out six barleys of pure wheat one barley one measure for each day you said that wrong one one measure for one day first each day you said six he got six measures they're supposed to be seven well but you see he only gave her a measure for the first six days the sabbath day she didn't get a measure she got the lord of the harvest amen oh don't you see where we're at for us all that luther had all that wesley had all that pentecost said we are the fullness of the church ages amen hallelujah we don't get a measure in this hour we get healed amen the two the two becoming one the lord of the harvest the two becoming one she laid at his feet with the same garment he was covered with elijah and elijah shared the same robe bow as a roof share of the same garment and jesus turned to james and john he said can you drink of the same cup that i drink from and they said we can he said to them can you share in what i am partaking of can you be a part of this and they said yes yes we can what is the cup can you drink of this cup i drink from what is this cup he was asking can you drink of this cup i'm drinking for him what is the cup we get a glimpse of it in the garden of gethsemane when praying to the father he prayed to the father lord if it be possible take this cup for me don't make me drink this cup what is this cup and then after praying until he sweat till his blood become his sweat become great droplets of blood because he was sweating it out in the garden of gethsemane calvary was not an easy thing because he went there as a man the only time in the bible you'll ever find that jesus will was ever was ever even come into play ever come into view it was always the will of the father but here in the garden of gethsemane when he sweating it out after the anointing had left him he said father your god you can do anything don't make me drink this cup what is this cup the prophet said it is a cup of bitter persecution he was a man of sorrow acquainted with grief jesus never said we wouldn't have sorrow he never said we would not have grief he never said that come on this cup that he drank of the bible said a man of sorrow acquainted with grief he was called beelzebub he was told he had a devil he was mocked made fun of rejected lied on persecuted killed it is a cup of persecution it is the cup of rejection by the world are you hearing me this cup he drank from it it's a cup of rejection by the world humiliation by the world a cup of bitterness a cup of ridicule a cup of hatred the cup of death that's the cup he drank from a cup of bitter persecution a cup of humiliation where they stripped him off naked and hunky between the heavens and earth and he watered there in his own blood till they strapped him and tore great pieces of flesh from his body that was the cup he was drinking from and he asked him can you drink this cup a can you drink this cup sometimes the prophet said the torture sometimes the torture that a sign has to go through is amazing the torture that jesus went through to prove the sign of god the torture he went through to prove he was the messiah come on a cup of persecution the cup of rejection yeah come on yes this disciples can you drink this cup and they said we can we can we can bear the reproach and he said ye shall indeed drink this cup and they did they did they said we can he said you shall and they did drink of that cup even to the point that paul said after his confirm his conversion he said well you have heard of my conversation in times past in the jews religion how that beyond measure i persecuted the church of god and wasted it they were thrown in jail they were beaten they were persecuted all drinking from the same cup the apostles said they returned rejoicing because they were counted worthy to bear the reproach of his name look at the disciples look at him they drank from that cup he drank from because he said you shall indeed drink of this cup matthew was killed by a sword in ethiopia mark died in egypt after being dragged by horses through the street till he was dead luke was hanged in greece john was boiled in oil sentenced to the isle of aleppatmus he's the only one that died of old age he topped the bride they tried their best to kill john but they couldn't and john taps the bride amen peter was crucified upside down james was thrown off the roof of the church and when they found that he didn't that that didn't kill him they beat him to death with clubs james the son of zebedee was beheaded at jerusalem his guard was so moved by james's faith that he repented and declared his faith in christ and was beheaded with james james in the midst of bitter persecution had such a testimony that the one who was guarding him converted to christianity and died beside james oh god give me that kind of testimony oh my god bartholomew was beat to death with a whip andrew was crucified thomas was stabbed to death with a spear in india jew was killed by arrows mathias was stoned and then beheaded drinking from the same cup the cup of bitter persecution the cup of rejection the cup of death why because they were christians prophet said not only is a candlestick of gold it is a beaten code handcrafted of beaten goat according to her blueprints which are spirit given outside of her lord and master jesus christ was ever a people so beaten and purged as the bride of jesus christ surely it's just fulfilling the suffering that christ has left behind her goods are disposed her life is in jeopardy she's accounted a sheep for the slaughter she is killed all the day long she suffers much but it all retaliates retaliates not neither does she cause others to suffer worthy of the gospel is this lovely bride of christ and as gold is a malleable whereas brass will break with the beating this gold of god will bear her suffering for the lord not bowed not broken not destroyed but formed as a thing of beauty and a joy forever formed as a thing of beauty formed as a thing of beauty and joy forever by the trials and the testings of this life ye shall indeed drink but the trials and the testings and the persecution and the hatred does not destroy us but it molds us and shapes us into a thing of beauty the bible said he had no beauty they needed to desire him where is his beauty i'm looking at it you are the beauty of the lord amen he shall indeed drink many people are think that christians god loves us god loves us therefore we should never be sick we should never have heartache or sorrow we should never have to bury loved ones we should never have to come on somebody we should never have to bury our children our wives our husbands we're god's people we follow his message we believe his prophet we should never have battles we should never be faced with pandemics we should always be blue skies smooth sailing everything should just be beautiful just a picnic want a little bit more ice cream but you see that's lovely that is a lovely picture but the only problem is jesus never said that he never said we wouldn't be persecuted he never said we wouldn't be mocked and laughed at and hated and recued and ridiculed he never said we wouldn't get sick he never said we wouldn't battle cancer but he did say no matter what you face i will never leave you nor will i forsake you [Applause] many times we are led to that spot why is it if i go to church and i live before god with all my heart and i try to be just an honest person and all that christianity requires why is it that these things happen but you know many times they are blessings in disguisement i think there's something a bitter cup and many times it's actually blessings because according to romans 8 28 all things work to the good that's pandemics too all things work to the good all things then no matter what i face in life somehow even though i may not understand it somehow it's for my good. i've preached ever since i was a young man god opens blinded eyes i preached that because i believed that but now i can preach it with authority i can preach it with assurance because i have seen blinded eyes open [Applause] but it took the suffering of losing loved ones in an automobile accident it took the suffering of seeing my baby lay on life support for nine days and the doctor said she'd never walk again she'd never talk again she'd never see again you have to go through the suffering hallelujah but yet god has took those things and changed my ministry these things happen many times they're blessings and disguise but many times we can't understand them brother now do you understand no but he never asked me to understand he just said can you trust me can you trust me that i'm doing something good for you sometimes we can't understand them things but if you'll just let them alone god will work it out just right i think many times the problem is we try to work it out if we would just give it into the hands of god i mean brother david was talking about covey back in the back room i remember that day 9 day 10 i thought i was going to leave this world matter of fact on day 10 when my fever was 104.4 and my body was shaking like brother david said like an earthquake on the inside of my body i could not quit shaking but sitting there in the bathroom floor i said god live or die my life is in your hands amen sometimes god don't ask us to understand it he just says can you trust me can you trust me i'll bring you through the fire i'll bring you through the flood i'll bring you through the troughs don't be afraid to drink the cup you shall indeed drink the cup many people try to introduce christianity so many promises today the prophet said amongst christian people so many ministers promised the people a thoughts false thing if you'll just come to christ all your troubles are settled he said but i tell you when you come to christ that's when your troubles begin because the prophet said the devil hates the spirit of god and because he cannot overcome the spirit of god therefore he tries to destroy the vessels in whom the spirit of god dwells all famous pictures before they can ever go into a hall of fame they must first have to pass through critics he said i like that because it's about like the church listen to this quote before the church can ever go into the great rapture first it has to come through the critics all that live godly in christ jesus shall suffer persecution there is no excuses just before the great rapture the church must go through the hall of critics i remember years ago when i came to camp back in 1987 88 89 just a young boy the days were different then nobody persecuted this message nobody was on the internet nobody was on facebook slandering this message slandering this prophet but look where we're at right now you type in the name william branham you type in the message of the error and all you find is hatred come on somebody why do you not see where we're at in time do you not see that this message is now passing through a hall of critics the prophet is passing through a hallow critic does it tell us just how close we are because the prophet said before that great rapture the church will go through the hall of critics drinking drinking from the cup that the bridegroom drink from because the same word speaks for the groom speaks also for the bride there is none that's deferred all have to pass through the line of persecution and criticism then if we can pass through that with such a life that the critics can't point their finger to anything that's true then the pitcher is ready then for the great hall of fame before the church can ever be raptured and taken through the hall of fame it goes here through the hall of critics all that live godly in christ jesus shall suffer persecutions it must go through criticism no criticism no glory [Music] can you drink this cup of bitter persecution if you're ever to get the glory if you're ever to be put in the hall of fame you must drink from this cup amen you see everybody comes to church with this blue skies and smooth sailing but it's in the times of trouble that you see people all of a sudden disappear it must go through criticism no criticism no glory remember if you follow christ you'll be hated by people for all that live godly in christ jesus shall suffer persecution if you come to christ you'll not come by any church or any denomination or any creed you'll come by the blood that's the only avenue in the gentile church the real true church of god has exposed herself to public persecution by taking god at his word and saying i believe that divine healing and the power of the resurrection i believe that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever when all these old cold formal mornings say the days and miracles has passed we expose ourself at his feet hallelujah we rejoice like the apostles when they returned because they counted worthy the better reproach of his name and hundreds of years later hundreds of years later the same holy ghost working in the same kind of people causing the same results from the outside to a point of a scornful finger and also the same results on the inside for a resurrected lord jesus stretching forth his hands to do signs and wonders that he did at the beginning hundreds of years later the same kind of people amen bearing the reports of those on the outside pointing the finger at you calling you a cult calling you a man follower hold on somebody pointed their finger at us saying were occult but at the same time on the inside the same jesus stretching forth his hand to do signs and wonders the bible said we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but we are not destroyed i want the devil to know tonight he will never destroy this bride she cannot be stopped he said can you drink the cup i drink from that's bitter persecution yes and he said you shall indeed drink we proved it by the bible and the message that his words were true it was true for them it's also true for us you shall indeed drink from this cup did they drink it we proved it by the bible and we proved it by the message that the same kind of people following the same lord jesus gets the same results drinking from the same cup but he doesn't stop there you see my brother my sister if that part is right if that part is right then the rest of the saiyan is also correct he said ye shall indeed drink of this cup but then he also said and you shall be baptized ye shall be baptized with the same baptism that i am baptized with do you understand his baptism what did it produce for him though they took the life out of his body his baptism raised him up again and we are baptized with the same baptism go ahead take my head off my daddy will give me a new one oh hallelujah the same baptism he had we are now in possession of that same baptism what did it do it changed his body what will it do for us it'll change my very body amen [Applause] baptized with the same baptism that i'm baptized with of people so persecuted so hated so ridiculed huh type in william branham on the internet and see what you get people so hated so persecuted so laughed at huh and most of it's coming from people who used to walk among us at the same time of people so persecuted and people so hated are people so criticized and at the same time of people so anointed not a church member not an organization not a messiah an anointed one standing on the earth in this hour same persecution same hatred but at the same time the same anointing he was the messiah and we are we are the messiahs you need to start looking at yourself the way god sees you like the little boy looking to the mirror he said why mama that's me and god has given us a mirror it's the mirror of his word and a mirror word mirror shows a word image amen we need to look into this word and see that boa hallelujah ruth was tapping me mary was stopping me enoch was typing me anointed messiahs like ruth she laid down she pulled the same cover over her that he was covered with like elisha when elijah was taken up elijah throw down the mantle and elisha wore the same metal elijah war same spirit same thing with a double portion same power no greater no greater power not the quality but the quantity just a double portion why because that anointing was on one man called jesus now that same anointing is on a mini-membered body called the bride and what is the bride's name mrs jesus christ what double portion more because now there's an anointed people in arkansas there's an anointed people in louisiana there's an anointed people in south africa all around the world the messiahs god walking in flesh god living in flesh god expressing himself through me through you same skirt same robe same cup same baptism can you be baptized with the same baptism i'm baptized with what is that baptism it's the holy ghost it's the life of god manifested in flesh [Music] like a cucumber a cucumber is a vegetable you sisters that make pickles you know all about baptism that's right there's actually two terms one is bapto and the other is baptizo one means to dip and the other means to be pickled john said john said i will baptize you with water but there's one coming after me he shall baptize you with the holy ghost two different baptisms jesus said you shall indeed be baptized with the baptism i'm baptized with you know it's not saying we all have to go to jordan and be baptized in the same water that's 2 000 years ago the water he was baptized in is way downstream now but he's not talking about dip like you dip a pickle in boiling water but he's talking about a different baptism like a pickle when it's baptized in vinegar it goes to a transformation it's no longer a cucumber it becomes a new creation [Music] it becomes a new creature it becomes a pickle it's changed forever and he said ye shall be baptized he shall be changed forever [Applause] not a church member not a baptist not a methodist not even a message believer but sons and daughters of god made in his image both of his bones flesh of his flesh spirit of his spirit life of his life she is him [Music] and he said can you can you be baptized like that and i say yes lord easter has made the way for us to receive this baptism he said you can't you shall indeed the things i do to the church greater than you now it couldn't be greater in quality it had to be greater in quantity because he stopped nature he raised the dead he healed sick everything that could be done he did it see give life back to the dead and everything so nothing could be done any greater in the quality but it's the quantity more people doing what he did you see the worst mistake satan ever made was when he put that stinger in jesus he thought he was stopping jesus but all he did was open up his side so his church could come out that day at calvary there was one come on but that day in the upper room that was 120 and today in this evening time with the return of the restoration of the word comes the restoration of the anointing amen amen these things i do shall you do also and more greater shall you do because i go to the father the same baptism that i have you'll have it too the same spirit that was on christ the same spirit that was on christ the same spirit that was on christ is on you but you see that'll do you no good if you don't believe that the same spirit that was on christ is on you not just the prophet people trying to preach today that it's just on the prophet that preacher shouldn't even preach no more just play tapes that's a lie [Music] if they listen to the tapes they were listening to if they really heard it they would denounce that thing [Applause] [Music] the prophet never taught that the message does not teach like geronimo speaking of his native blood he said i do not think i'm useless or the great spirit would not have created me and i would like to tell them i do not think i'm useless or god would have not made me an [Applause] evangelist you see where the attack is where's the attack today amen the attack is on the bride jesus said the same cup i drink you'll drink the same baptism i baptize with you shall be baptized with and the same things that i do shall you do also what did he do he spoke in tongues cast out devils preached the gospel oh my god let me pull that that's what he said the thing's the same thing that i do show you also what did he do spoke in tongues cast out devils preached the gospel healed the sick the same thing that he did we can too and at the end of our days um at the end of our days has he raised him from the dead so will we who are in him he will also raise up my brother my sister don't you realize the resurrection what is easter it's you it's me the resurrection is in us [Applause] you see what messiah is messiah it's the kingdom of god anointed once them anointed with the same spirit he was anointed with one said to him one day when my son sit at thy right hand and i left it he said can you drink the cup i drink can you be baptized with the baptism i baptized with she said yea and he said you will but the kingdom just sit at the right hand and the left is not mine to give so it showed it showed we could we could drink the same cup of persecution be called beelzebub or whatever it might be huh oh yeah yeah that's what they call the fifo ministry today huh they call us korra and dathan [Music] you think the baptist calling me that it's my own brothers david said i was wounded in the house of my friends if it had been my enemy i could have understood it but it were my friends who put jesus to death it was not the it was not the drunk it was the religious people who supposed to have knew him he said we have moses to our prophet he said if you even knowed moses you would have known me for he spoke of my day [Laughter] hallelujah amen theo's about whatever it might be and she'd be baptized with the same spirit he baptized with so if he was called messiah which he was because he was anointed with that holy spirit and any church that's anointed with the ham with the same holy spirit any church that's anointed with the same holy spirit is a messiah a littler smaller a littler smaller god you see the prophet said as long as we fuss and fight among ourselves we still walk as men we still walk as men so that tells me there must be another way that you and i can walk on the earth when jesus walked on the earth he did not walk on the earth as a man nor as a god but he walked on the earth as a god-man and they asked him what country are you from what race are you from what nation are you i was down at san carlos on the apache indian reservation and there's an indian dinner had a big old t-shirt big old letters on it said watch out white man this is apache land i said my mama party indian so i said we need to make us a t-shirt say watch out devil this is bride land this is broad country this is god nation amen this is who we are anointed messiahs sons and daughters of god [Music] any church any church that tells me whether it's in worth whether it's in hardy whether it's in missouri whether it's in tennessee whether it's in south africa whether it's in canada any church that's anointed with the same holy spirit is a messiah a littler smaller god and someday when this body is resurrected i hope beforehand that god can get a hold of a bunch of people that god can get a hold of a bunch of people that'll manifest his power in every dimension that it's supposed to be manifested in that before this thing wraps up that god can get a group of people in his hand that will manifest all he intended for the people to be for the church of the living god to be messiah anointed one listen to this quote messiah an anointed one a king a king to deliver a king your kings and priests kings to bring in priests to minister to a messiah his signs was to follow in all ages reflecting his life his presence with his kingdom people can you drink of this cup yes you can can you be baptized with this baptism yes we can there is a bride on the earth today who can declare by revelation yes we can we can cast out devils we can lay our hands on the sick we can't hallelujah we can't slay giants we can raise the dead we can walk on the water we can take a body change and at the same time be hated and rejected and criticized but it never stopped him it never stopped him they mocked him they laughed at him they caught him illegitimate they did everything they could to stop his ministry they forbid people they tried to have lockdowns to keep the people from assembling herself but they could not stop him and they can't not stop us they tried their best to kill john they brought him in all they put him in exile but they never stopped him and john is the top of this bride and they will never stop this blood everything that christ has we have everything that christ is we are to manifest all god was he poured into christ was the mystery of god revealed and all christ is he has poured into his church and the church is the revelation of jesus christ in this hour sirs we would see jesus and i say tonight sirs we have seen jesus we shall see miracles the year of 2021 has been declared by many minister brothers it has been declared the year of miracles and i say my brother my sister why not us why not now come on somebody why can't this be your year of your miracle your year of your deliverance your time in the sun it's your season why not us why not now somebody's going to become this word somebody's going to become this quote i say why not [Applause] why don't you why not me why not this church why not brother jesus why not brother david why not brother max come on somebody why not us we are god's people we are the bride of jesus christ the visions that the prophet had we're not reading them we're not reading the visions we're in them [Music] god has a dream i'm the dream he dreamed you're the dreamy dream god had a vision you're that vision god had a church you're that church can you drink yes yes we can drink he has made a way repent be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sin and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost and the promises to you and to your children even as far off as many as the lord our god shall call you see we weren't looking for god we were never looking for god he came looking for us we never chose him he chose us [Laughter] the purpose of brother benham coming to earth was to find you to show you to show you who you are oh let's just close look there's a there's a a guy trying to think of his name right now i can't think of his name he's a very famous native american flute player very famous got all kinds of albums out i just can't think of his name right now but he was raised in new jersey in a jewish home wore the little hat wore the little fringe things on the ends of his jacket went through that ceremony to go through a boy becoming a man all those things well how in the world does a jew from new jersey become a world-famous award-winning native american flute player it just don't match come on somebody that's about like me flying an airplane you don't want to be on board it just don't match but you see what happened was what happened was one day somebody came to his door with the book and the book was opened and it revealed to him his true identity you see he was not a jew from new jersey he was a sioux indian from south dakota adopted as a baby by a jewish family raised in a jewish home like that eagle was raised in a chicken barnyard but one day the books was open and it revealed his true birth it revealed his true genetics and when he found out that he wasn't a jew he was a sioux who could make that up when he found out that he wasn't a jew he was actually a sioux he started going back to the old ways the red path started talking about elders started wearing feathers just like some of you who sat on a bar stool drinking budweiser come on somebody but one day a book was open and our names were revealed and god sent an eagle to find you and you heard that scream [Applause] and i realized i am not the son of james elbert and mary jo lord but i am a son of god made in his image can you drink of the same cup yes can you be baptized with the same baptism yes ye shall indeed for in the evening time i will restore saith the lord and the works i do shall you do also and greater works than thee shall you do because i go to my father and send the baptism back to you and you're not just a boiled cucumber you have become a pickle changed forever changed forever to take on the characteristics of an anointed messiah god walking in flesh whose flesh my flesh your flesh manifesting himself as he said he would do the works i do shall you do also and greater more works shall you do for the glory of god i am a witness that these things are true for i have seen my god i didn't do it i had nothing to do i was just there when it happened but i am a witness that god moving through his people scott
