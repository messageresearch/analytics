TRANSCRIPT
========================================
find some food he said i'm going to wait here so he sends his disciples away why because he knew that he was desiring fellowship with someone so he's waiting at the well and all of a sudden he looks coming down the road and there's this woman carrying uh a pot oh she looks rugged she looks she looks uh a wore out jesus knew what kind of woman she was but it didn't bother him oh my sometimes when those kind of people walk into our churches we begin to get judgmental we begin to look down upon them and say oh how can they ever receive what we've got listen in church if that's your attitude here this morning you need to find an altar somewhere and get right with god amen because that's the kind that god came to i remember where i was amen when god say my soul and many times we need to go back and remember what we was before god saved our soul amen so here she came he began to tell her the secrets of her hearts amen the very things that she was that she was going and how she had had five husbands and the one she was living with was not hers it was someone else's and and and as he began to to discern her and tell her these things amen something had been opened to her and he and and she realized that this is the messiah amen that i was taught about amen by my mother and by my father this is him amen and she went into the city and began to tell everybody amen about this risen savior that this savior that has come let me tell you a woman that was a prostitute amen went into the city with a testimony that he's here the messiah is here both were hungering she was hungering for something greater than a natural man say man he was hungering amen for something and when those two desires met amen it brought peace it brought satisfaction amen it took all of her frustrations away hallelujah oh to think that jesus thirsts and hungers for your fellowship this morning five minutes in the presence of jesus all her questions and all her doubts were dissolved all of her frustrations were no more everything became crystal clear to her what a hiding place hey man it wasn't in a great revival meeting it wasn't where everyone was dancing and shouting around the church it was her and jesus alone something was happening in the heart instead of on the outside i believe i believe that we have be we have come to a real crucial time in the ranks of the message i'm going to say these i'm going to say this and i've said it to the church and i want to say this here i'm not scared of who might call me but this is a real crucial time that we have come to in the ranks of the message to where if you're not having a meeting once a month amen and and you're not on your feet shouting and dancing around the church you're just not a spiritual person that's the biggest lie from the devil that you'll ever hear paul said this paul said this though i speak with tongues of men and angels and have not charity now brother braden are you saying that you're against shouting are you saying you're against dodging nope i've done it all myself i'm not against none of those things but if we if we emphasize so much upon those things have we not done the same thing that pentecost did amen and and say that you got to speak in tongues amen and you received the holy ghost have we not done the same thing listen church i'm not just desiring to go back to pentecost amen we've got something greater in this day amen that god has given us a message of malachi 4 that not only restores us back to pentecost the restoration of the gifts amen but we'll get us out of this past house amen and we've got to be able to stand still long enough that the word will dress us in this day and find amen the will of god for our day though i speak with tongues i'm in angels and have not charity i am become as a sounding brass or a tinkling symbol and though i have the gift of prophecy and understand all the mysteries and all the knowledge and though i have all faith so that i can remove mountains and have not charity i am nothing and though i bestow all my gifts to feed the poor and though i give my body to be burned and have not charity it profiteth me nothing the emphasis have been turned from the most important thing to outward manifestations like pentecost preachers have even become to the spot that if they can't get everyone on their feet then they just didn't have church emotions are all right i know the prophet even said that a dead fish can't float upstream but you get one woman's life in it and it'll buck the currents i understand that but i frayed that we are getting that type of emotions that he's speaking of amen mixed up with what what is going on i believe as a holy ghost-filled person i've got emotions is that right i believe i've got emotions amen this kind of emotion that when trials come and they hit me hard i've got an anchor in the inside that will keep pushing me forward amen it's not a shout all the time it's not a hallelujah all the time sometimes it is but not all the time it's something that will anchor me it's something that will buck the currents of life emotions are right and i'm glad when god drops in an extra handful for us but emotions won't take you very far i just got done listening to the prophet you can take elijah in the bible amen monday morning's going to roll around after a good emotional meeting and troubles are going to come your way and if all you've got is a foundation is emotions you're gonna find yourself in a wreck because when troubles start coming in like a flood amen and all you've got is a foundation is emotions your emotions are gonna be here they're gonna be like a roller coaster up one day down one day up one day down one day amen but if you're anchored in god's word amen you can weather the storms amen why because you know the anchor holds it's in the cleft of the rock it's not in your it's not in your spirit realm amen where there's reasoning imaginations emotions it's not in that it's not anchored in that it's not anchored in your outside five senses but it's anchored amen down in the soul where the word of god has been put put in there and you can anchor on that the pentecostal said clap your hands and shout till you speak in tongues and you've got it but we found out we didn't have it there's one more thing left he says and god take me to a cave where i can find it let's get that still small voice that's something that puts the cream in the life that's something that though you speak in tongues of men and angels and have not that you're nothing though you can prophesy and speak with tongues and show signs and wonders and work miracles and do great signs but if that little still small voice isn't in there you're nothing says the scripture that's what we're listening for now but burnham declares that he said that's what we're listening for now now watch what he says he says we've had the thunders we've had the fire we've had the rushing mighty winds and the earthquakes but god send us that still small voice he said that's what we need listen brother we need that still small voice a still small voice that spoke jesus said you couldn't hear his voice in the street you didn't hear him crying he was our pattern look at him he was compared his spirit like a dove gentle it's a great things or quiet things did you know that friends he said great things are quiet things oh brother braden you're saying we can't jump shout no more no i'm not saying that church do you realize that the sun is roughly 109 times bigger than the diameter of the earth google says that one million earths could fit inside the sun and yet it rises in the morning and sets in the evening and we never hear it great things are quiet things i think many in the ranks have forgotten the core principles core principles of what malachi 4 brought to us the message of the hour is not just bringing us back to pentecost if so then why didn't the first church rapture but the message of malachi 4 is to bring the furtherance of the word amen the opening of the word of those seven seals amen to stabilize us to weather every storm amen a rock amen of revelation that brings stability in the times of storms a peace that is there in the midst of the darkest times to bring such a groaning for lost souls let me read you something if i can find it in the message in 65 the message christ is revealed in his own word brother branham said this he says now the stabilizers have been put on the ship now he's talking about the great revivals amen are over he says he says as a nation the revival is over it is no more and he says but now the stabilizers have been put on the ship great and fearful waves are out before us but we know just beyond that wave yonder we're nearing the store he says so just stay stabled in the word he says stay with god stay with god he was talking about the great revivals are over so many are trying to relive that amen and missing the more that god amen is desiring for us to live many are living from meeting to meeting and if a person wanted to not have a home church amen he could actually go to church every sunday and have a meeting to go to meetings are great i love going to meetings but brother branham called those people who live from meeting to meeting camp meeting cramps they think oh i've got to go here before god can do something for me i've got to go over here where this great man of god is before i can be healed i've got to go here where this great man of god is and this group of people is amen before god can reveal himself to me church he can reveal himself to you amen he can give you the holy ghost on the backside of the desert out in the deer woods he can do whatever he wants to when you're willing to surrender everything to him amen god can come down hey man i was listening this morning brother branham said that there was a man they were out at the shooting range shooting gallery and they were shooting he was a great businessman of some sort and he and he looked at brother branham he said brother branham he said he said i don't have that holy ghost that you're talking about that you have he says i want that holy ghost do you thank god amen would allow me to have it brother brahm said sure it's for you brother and he said well i'll tell you what i'll do he said i'll go i'll go up here into the city and i'll rent one of these nice big hotel rooms amen that's real nice and real plush and we'll go in there and maybe god will give me the holy ghost in there he said sir you don't need that fancy hotel room he said god can meet you right here and that man said you mean in a shooting gallery he said he can meet you anywhere that you can open your heart to receiving hey man it's not in the big numbers it's not in the biggest meetings church amen when you open your heart and say god i want more of you he can meet you there it may be on the way to work sisters or brothers it may be amen when you least expect it but god can meet you there we're running to meetings here in a meeting here and this man of god here and this man of god here and we're missing the most important thing that's having a relationship with god i know we've got great men in this day i'm not downing them but many are getting their eyes on them go back brother branham talks about in the message perfect strength by perfect weakness before he even starts his ministry his message he's talking about the servant before that he made a statement where that he didn't really just agree with altar calls you probably remember the sermon and and and he was getting some flack about it so he comes along in perfect strength by perfect whitney and he explains this he said he said it's not that i'm against altar because he said i've made a many one myself and i'll make many more he said but what what happens is he says when we call an altar call he said he said when you shouldn't even have to call an altar call if god is dealing on a person amen god's already doing the work let him work he said but men they begin to collect too much lord help me let me just tell you this church i've been a part of some great prayer lines and i've seen some great things take place just to let you know that i'm not against prayer lines but i've also seen the other side of it in the same prayer lines they'd call all the ministers to come up and i would just come and take a place and because i wasn't in their little group they took me and said here we're going to place you back here at the end of the line and we're going to place this one with great faith in your spot you see men begin to collect too much and it's not what god wants they're forgetting the main thing how did he know what kind of faith i had how did he know the things that god has done through my life i'm not interested in man's work neither should we be as the bride of jesus christ we should be interested in what god is doing amen and make sure that we are amen in that in that hiding place amen reflecting amen the very life of jesus christ still love me this is why i believe it's a real crucial time brandon refers to this in the vision that he's seen of the three pulls of his ministry he refused to that he refers to that light going over and hanging over a little building many has taken it that he's got to come back and and preach and attend well if you if you go and you listen to it amen his his attention is off the big tent it's not on the big tent no more but it's where that angel of the lord is hanging over it's a little wooden building he said he said that's where the attention amen was that that his focus was on it wasn't on the big tent no more but it was on the little building and brother branham even referred to it in one spot as a little closet or something and he refers to that light going over and hanging over a little building and he actually refers to us as a closet and the angel of the lord told him i'll meet you in there and he also said that this is the third pull and it will not be a public show and the angel of the lord gives him scripture to back it up and he begins to quote jesus and when thou prayest thou shall not be as the hypocrites are for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets that they may be seen of men verily i say unto you they have their reward but i'm looking for a greater reward be thou when thou prayest enter into thy closet and when thou hast shut thy door pray to thy father which is in secret and thy father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly brother branham said the first pull was when he would lay his hands upon the person and he would know what they were suffering with he said the second pool come along and it was the discerning of the hearts he could look down and without touching him and laying hands upon them and be able to see amen what their condition was what was going on in their lives and he would begin to discern and call those things out but he said the third pull was those revelations of those seven seals coming forth he said and being made known is that right he said that third pull he said you know we want to we want to we want to we want to look at all the shouting we want to look at all the dancing we want to look at all that and then they want to say that we're in the third pool this is the third pull those things come under the second pole but we're not in the second pool no more we are in the third paul ministry church where god is speaking his word through his bride amen we cannot speak his word if we can't find that hiding place amen brother branham said that room amen he said the angel told him he said i'll meet you in there amen and there is where that third pool opened i'll meet you in there you want the third pool open in your life go in there amen it's not a natural building that we got to go to we don't have to go to headquarters in jeffersonville we don't have to be in this church it's not your pastor it's not your mother it's not your father amen it's finding that secret hiding place that you and god is alone and you can meet him there and he can meet you there brother branham said eliezer sweated it out until he found character after he found character then he had to get her to stand still long enough to listen to his message of isaac that's the message of the hour church stand still stand still and hear the message how is how is a wife how is a how is a husband ever going to know what her the character of her husband or his wife is if they're always hollering and screaming and they never sit still long enough to listen to him speak mama help us lord moses abraham said this in queen of sheba he said moses knowed the word real well but that blessed hiding place was it not ridiculous was it not ridiculous to see moses standing in a king's court with all the celebrities with the finest of language trained in all the wisdom of the egyptians and smart but god had to take him out behind the mountain for 40 years god's schooling is always right amen god's schooling is his man and remember as trained as an egyptian a sheepherder was an abomination and it isn't it strange to see how foolish it would seem in the hearts of men with wisdom with a man with all of his great intelligence with all of the great armies of egypt laying at his command that he could do whatever he wished to and would step away from his education watch how the prophet is wording this and would step away from his education step away from his worldly wisdom step away from his great associates and go out behind the desert and become into abomination to the people that he once associated with he said may i say this with reverence it's tonight when god calls me and many times he has to step out of the political ranks out of the social ranks and walk out into a place if it would be necessary if his associates had to say he's gone crazy or become a holy roller but it's that secret place it's that spot he says oh don't miss it church my loyal friends every one of you that's received christ of all your teachings your fine pastors your great affiliations with your churches which is all right don't misunderstand me but you're trying to place that before this but that little time that god gets you away from all your associates gets you away back in the corner and brings you into a place in a secret place where that the wisdom of the world becomes so insufficient to you where all the education that you ever had doesn't mean nothing into that divine presence till the lust of the eye gets so dim you can't see it anymore until the love of money is completely vanished away from you and when you stand there alone with jehovah god that's the thing that counts that's the things that make make you forget all you ever knew that's where moses had to get and what a beautiful picture he said god revealing himself there in a burning bush and moses now watch moses know more about god in five minutes in the presence of that burning bush than he'd learned 40 years in egypt that's the place to be alone with god amen that's the place amen amen i believe that's what the prophet amen back in where art thou uh what does thou hear when he said this is what we're waiting for this is what we're looking for amen this is what he was speaking about is that hiding place to be alone with god moses think about this now there he was on the backside of the desert that's where god revealed himself to moses hey man think about this none of this sheep was back there it's very important as a pastor that your pastor gets away amen alone with god amen and finds that place and not only that but it's important for you amen to find that place amen and i guarantee you if you find that place and he finds that place when you come to the house of god you'll be in tune with what's being preached and you'll be able to say amen pastor amen pastor that's the truth amen god was just dealing with me down that yesterday i just had a conversation with the lord yesterday about that praise be to god oh what does it bring it brings stimulation by revelation but there he was none of his sheep was back there his wife wasn't there his children wasn't there his father-in-law jethro wasn't back there none of that was back there amen it was just him and god god revealed himself to him there in the presence of that burning bush and the bible said that when he came off the mountain amen back to his wives and things amen that his whole face shined with the glory of god amen that's what amen the hiding place will do for a believer amen you will come away from there reflecting the very light of god amen amen listen church it's not the rippling waters the prophet said the shallow streams the rippling waters amen that shines and reflects the stars in the heavens no he said but it's the small deep amen steel pool of water that can reflect the the the light of the stars and you could see the stars reflecting even off the water it's not the big rippling waters it's not the big meetings what we're looking for it's not some great man that we're looking for it's jesus that we need a long time with him that's where we need to be i have nothing against meetings i have nothing with shouting i have nothing against all these things but we're getting the cart before the horse many of them amen ain't got an ounce of god in them amen they're more worried about a paycheck amen than they are the souls of the kingdom of god forgive me i believe with all my heart that if the prophet of god was here in this day he wouldn't just be going to the pentecostal church amen and crying out against what they're doing he would be in his own churches where have we got church where are we at we're at the end time and satan is so deceitful that the bible says that he would deceive the very elected if it was possible but it's not possible amen because god said that he would cut the work short amen before that would happen so that ought to show you how deceitful the devil is amen that the only reason that you can't be deceived is because god is going to cut the work short i was in a meeting a while back i was enjoying the word of god just just taking it in i was sitting there people standing up on all sides of me which was fine i wasn't condemning them it was a wonderful time in the presence of the lord i think i might have been me and my wife might have been the only ones that wasn't on her feet but i i just didn't feel that inspiration i was i was hungering for what was being said i wanted to hear it so i was listening in with all that i could because i don't know about you when i come to the house of god i i want to know where my faults are i want to know where i'm wrong i want to know how i can better myself i want to know how i can climb the ladder so i was listening with all all my heart all that was within me all of a sudden the preacher he said if you all felt like these others that are standing you'd be standing up to oh brothers and sisters i want more than just to return to pentecost do you understand what i'm speaking of this morning i wasn't condemning those who were standing but to be condemned for not standing in a message church i say that's a shame i say that's a discredit to the message that the prophet of god brought because he never touched never never taught such stuff well brother brandon what about what do you do about brother branham when he when he talks about uh coming to himself and his he's sitting on the pulpit and his legs dangling over that wasn't in his own church where he taught the truth think about these things most of the time he was speaking to pentecostal people and he knew and he knew what they liked but when it come down to the latter part of his ministry you didn't see him you didn't see him preaching that way very much why because he was coming to something he was trying to bring the people amen further up the ladder amen than just pentecostalism he was trying to bring him above emotions i know these things ain't popular you you find in the word of god where i'm wrong and you come to me you have that you have that obligation yeah there's all kinds of quotes that brother branham talked about you know you got emotions you you there's all kinds of quotes but there's all kinds of quotes that he also talked about the very thing that i'm speaking of so there's got to be a balance there's got to be a balanced church we do not base our our relationship with god on how much we dance and how much we shout that's not what we base it upon that's just emotions that's just that's just a a wave of the holy spirit coming by i've seen many that have shouted and danced and run the church around amen and so loud that you couldn't even hear the preacher amen and go out and sit in a bar room monday through thursday what are we getting them what are we getting people to as ministers i think about this a lot what are we getting people to what are we getting our young people to i'm trying to close i need to before i get stoned brother branham said this and what does thou hear he said why men to suit himself if they don't get a revival once in a while on their spirit notice on their spirit they become so carnal and so indifferent till they get self-styled starchy and self-righteous they read and study and that's good but that ain't the thing we're talking about you know more about the word it's good to know the word but it's better to know the author of the word amen that little something that you leave out hey man that's something in your heart that makes you what you are that's the thing brothers and sisters amen that's the quote that we read while ago that certain thing that puts the cream down in your life that's what i desire that's what i'm longing for amen can we stand together and sing that song in the presence of jehovah let me say this i would rather know my lord in a personal way if i've never shouted one time if i never spoke in tongues one time i would never know the author of this word wouldn't you amen because it's going to take you in a rapture one day when you when that call to go up when you hear that this right here will take you up no one the author will take you up but just having under your belt that i shouted that i spoke with tongues that i prophesied in your name that i had great miraculous healings and all those things that's not going to take a person up i want to have that love in my heart that paul spoke about though i speak with tongues and have not charity i am nothing so let's get in his presence this morning can we do that hey man now i didn't read a quote and i probably should have because i come down on this pretty hard i'll admit but brother branham said he said i wish i could find it because i'll misquote it he said you may never speak in tongues but yet you might but we put all of our emphasis on speaking in tongues he said you may you may never shout but yet you might but we put all of our emphasis on shouting see he's bringing a balance to it he's not against it he done it himself but there's a there's a there's a balanced church and i'm afraid there's a spirit amongst us that is leading us away from that balance and the more we get away from that middle of that road the further off we're going to go it's time to come back come back to what's most important to get in his presence to find yourself lost there to where you don't care about what your wife's cooking or where your next meal is coming from all you're worried about is to get in his presence and you know if you can get in his presence he'll make all wrongs right he'll make everything all your frustrations everything that you're struggling with he'll make it all right oh i believe that let's sing that in the presence [Music] god almighty [Music] hearts are mandated [Music] of the king let's sing it again with all our hearts now [Music] god [Music] yes you are lord troubles [Music] in the presence [Music] father lord i've just done as you have bid me to lord this this morning lord i know these things ain't popular they're not easy to to to say lord especially when you see the majority going the other way it makes it easy for everybody to say well it's right because everything everybody's doing lord that's that's not so true lord i i i just want to find your will for me god that's that's my desire here this morning i just i just want to find that secret place lord and i know lord that if i find it and i dwell there that god you will lead and direct me the way you want me to go it may not always be the popular way it may not always be the easy way i think of the prophet lord now the letter was written and he said you have chose the hard way the hard path but it's the true way god that's the way of any believer it's not the easy way it's not the it's not the the easiest path but lord many times that way is hard it's rough it's rugged god help me to never lose lose sight lord of what we're reaching for lord i want my children lord to to not be deceived in into doing something lord that that would actually lead them further away from god than it would be draw them closer to god but lord i want them to i want them to to know the truth i want them to to know the right thing lord god help us this morning we pray may lord jesus lord may we never lose the love for your people lord may we have that deepness that love that sincerity for one another [Music] god that though we though we may disagree though we may not see eye to eye but father that god that we can walk away and we can still love one another god help us to have that lord i believe father if we really have the holy ghost on the inside and we found that hiding place though lord that love will be there that lord jesus that no matter how much we disagree that lord we can still love one another help us father i pray lord that you'd help brother ben's throat this morning god may you give him strength lord lord we know that the devil would attack lord what's needed most in a man's life and that's his voice to minister god may you restore that that voice to him lord that he can preach to his congregation lord that you've allowed him to be over this morning lord may you just touch him in a miraculous way may you touch the lives of those that are here this morning we pray lord we're looking to you the author and finisher of our faith we love you we appreciate you we ask these things in jesus name hey man let's sing that again as we turn it to your pastor [Music] in the presence [Music] oh in the presence of jehovah god oh you're the prince of peace [Music] in the presence [Music] in and out of situations that tug of war in me [Music] all day long i struggle for the answers that i need that i come into his presence and all my questions become clear [Music] and for that sacred moment all doubts just disappeared [Music] in the presence [Music] you're the prince of peace and hearts are bended is the praises of the kings aren't you glad to be in his presence this morning don't forget our uh our communion service at three o'clock this afternoon i just about said the wrong time three o'clock this afternoon and um we're gonna go ahead
