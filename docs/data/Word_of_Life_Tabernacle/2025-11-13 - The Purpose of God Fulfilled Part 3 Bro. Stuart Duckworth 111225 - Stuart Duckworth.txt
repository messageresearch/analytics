Let's sing this with all of our hearts. Little girl was lying there. People all [singing and music] were weeping. They just laughed at Jesus when he said [music] she's only sleeping. [singing] And as he took her by the hand, she began to live again. Some began to praise the Lord. Some [music] begin to say, "Oh, he's in [music and singing] the house and death has to flee and now there [music and singing] is light. Where the darkness used to be, now there [music and singing] is hope. Well, there's no more doubt. and you praise his name. He's in the house.

I know he's [music and singing] in the house. Well, death has to flee. And now there [music and singing] is light. Where the darkness used to be, [music] now there is hope and there's no more doubt. Can you [singing] praise [music] his name? He's in the house. [singing] You believe he's in the house tonight? I wonder if we could stand together. Amen. He's all I need. The same key of C. He's all I need. Amen. Isn't that what we need here tonight? Amen. And you know, we can we can sing too much. We can talk too much. Amen. But we we can't pray too much.

The tiredness that we feel sometimes on Wednesday nights and things are working and just it's [music] just natural things. But you know, we can just uh lay that aside. Let the Lord have his way here tonight. Amen. And let's just pull on the gift of God. As brother Stewart would come now, if he's what you need tonight, I want you to just worship him with your hands to him now as we sing it. Jesus is all [singing] I need. [music] Oh, he's all I need.

And Lord, we just come by faith. We come to Calvary tonight, Lord. We come before you, Lord, for for every need, Lord, of of your children here tonight, Lord.

And so, Lord, we just commit this service tonight to you, the preaching of the word, these people [music] tonight, all their needs, their lives. Lord, we just commit this service to you now. We love you. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen. You love God tonight. &gt;&gt; You love one another. &gt;&gt; Amen. [music] Try not to hold you too long tonight. We'll just turn in the scriptures um to Daniel 3. Daniel 3 and 1. Some of my family's home sick, so I I drove up here by myself tonight. It's kind of lonely, but here we are. Man, try not to put anybody to sleep tonight either. So, you love God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Daniel 3:1 just kind of the fulfilled purpose of God kind of continued that thought. Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold whose height was three score cubits and the breadth thereof six cubits and he set it up in the plain of Jura in the province of Babylon. Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent together the princes, the governors, and the captains, the judges, the treasures, the counselors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up. Oh my, what a dedication. Then the princes, the governors, the captains, the judges, the treasures, the c counselors, the sheriffs, and the rulers of the provinces were gathered together unto the dedication of the image of Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up. And they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up. Amen. You can be seated tonight. try not to hold you too long, but just imagine for a moment they're looking at this image like what in the world is this? But all these princes and governors and these rulers looking looking at this image, you know, they're sitting there all all the great great people, all the all the great counselors and and people of position there and and is that who we think it is? They look over and maybe Daniel's standing on on the far end down there and he's like, I don't know, guys. I don't know about this, you know, but and they're they're just like, is that that guy right there? &gt;&gt; But it was a look of confusion. And that's what Babylon causes. That's what Babylon is. It come from the tower of Babel and Nimrod. And Babylon is the spirit of confusion. The spirit of Babylon is the spirit of confusion. And brother Brandham says here in questions and answer on the seals he said remember in the time of Babylon and Nebuchadnezzar when the gentile kingdom was issued in. See when gentile kingdom issued in it come in by the worship of a man. And Nebuchadnezzar made a statue of a man. And if you've got a spiritual mind, he said, "Now listen to this revelation." That spirit, that man that he made an image of by his revelation &gt;&gt; was Daniel, a religious man being worshiped. See it? Because his name was Belt Shazar, which was the name of his God. And listen to this. And he made an image of that God, which was the image of Daniel. And he said, "And Daniel refused to bow to his own image." Amen. And we look here. Why was the why was the king so impressed with Daniel? What what did the prophet Daniel do? But the king had a dream. And in this dream, he was troubled. The Bible says in spirit and his sleep broke from him. The Bible says he was so troubled by this dream that he called all the magicians. &gt;&gt; Yeah. and astrologers and sorcerers and the Chaldans to come and give him an answer about his dream. &gt;&gt; And they said these astrologers, these sorcers, these supposed to be the smart people that that can figure things out. They said, "Tell us a dream and we'll tell you the interpretation." But that didn't work for the king, for he knew they would they would lie to him. But the king told them, he said, "The dream has gone from me." &gt;&gt; But he wanted them to tell me. He said, "Tell me both the dream and the interpretation." &gt;&gt; But the Bible says that none, Amen, was able. And they they saidnone would be able to do there's none of us that would be able to do such a thing to be able to tell you not only an interpretation, but to tell you the dream also. &gt;&gt; Amen. None was able to do such a thing. And there went a decree. Amen. that all the wise men would be destroyed. So there Daniel listening to this and him being a part of these wise men and and and so on. But Daniel desired the Bible says an opportunity to give an answer to the king. Amen. As this as this man was sent out, Amen. And the the decree of a king, whatever his word word was, Amen. it was to be. Amen. So let it be written and so let it be done. If a if a king speaks a word, if he gives out a commandment, it must go forth and it must be carried out. And here this man was going to carry out to begin to destroy and to kill these wise men because it was the decree of the king. But Daniel overheard this and he said, "Now hold up a minute. Hold up a minute. Give me a little bit of time and let me see if I can go in and get the king an answer." And there the Bible says, "And and there, Amen. and and he went in, Amen, in prayer to get an answer for the king." And he desired prayer. He desired mercy that the God of heaven would show him both the dream and the interpretation. Amen. &gt;&gt; And there Daniel, he explained. We know, we know that God showed him because that's God's prophet. God showed him, Amen. the dream. He showed them the interpretation what what the king what had gone from his mind God coming and through his prophet Amen revealed the entirety of the thing and Daniel began to explain what he saw and he said thou king art this head of gold and so on and down and and be to describe the the body and the different parts of it and he come on down to the feet of iron and clay and and there in Daniel 2:34 and he said and and thou Thou saw a seal of stone was cut out without hands, which smoked the image &gt;&gt; upon the feet that were of iron and clay, and it break them to pieces. &gt;&gt; And and brother said, Daniel's seen the beginning of that gentile rule. He's seen the beginning of that gentile rule on down to this very day that you and I live in. He's seen on down, amen, the beginning of the gentile kingdom. And he's seen on down to the very end. And he seen, amen, at the very end, he seen a rock that was cut out of the mountain without hands that would break, that would destroy this gentile kingdom. What did Daniel see? He seen, amen, not just the end of a kingdom, but he seen the day of the Lord. He was caught up and he he come on down to the very end. Amen. When man's day would end, when man's day would end and be crushed by this stone, preach with me tonight. Amen. It would be crushed by this stone. Amen. That was cut out of the mountain without hands. Amen. Man didn't have nothing to do with it. And this is what would come down at the very end and destroy the kingdoms of man. All the other kingdoms. Amen. Everything at the very end. Every denomination, every system would come down and this stone would destroy every bit of that. And this kingdom, amen, would be set up by the God of heaven. It would be set up, amen, not by man or man's idea, but it would be set up by the God of heaven and it would stand forever. And amen, it would never be destroyed. The Bible says, Amen. that it would stand forever. [snorts] &gt;&gt; I hate to know what I look like while I'm preaching. And I apologize, but the prophet of God said that stone was Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Daniel saw Jesus. &gt;&gt; He saw Jesus Christ. He caught a vision of that. &gt;&gt; And brother Reyn said it was the stone that the builders rejected. And that and and the Bible says in that same the the the stone that the builders rejected that same becomes the head of the body. It's that stone, brother Bram said that caps off the pyramid. And what is the pyramid? Amen. It's the stature of a perfect man. What did the pyramid? What did it type out? It was the stature of a perfect man. It was the building up, Amen. And it it was the building up, amen, of the of of the children of God, of the sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that that stone was to come and cap off the pyramid of you and I. &gt;&gt; Amen. The stature of a perfect man. &gt;&gt; Amen. What is that stone that Daniel seen? It is the headship of Christ. Yeah, &gt;&gt; it's some mighty angel coming down to identify and to bring the mind of Christ into the body. &gt;&gt; Amen. It is the Lord's day when the stone comes down. Amen. It is the seventh seal. It is the coming of the Lord. Amen. When man's day is over, amen. When denomination is over, the Bible says, Amen. It comes in a time when time is no longer. And brother said, Amen. What does that mean? And he said, "Time has run out for man. Time has run out for denomination." What is it? It's the Lord's day. Amen. It's the Lord's day when he comes upon the scene. Everything else passes away. Amen. When the Lord comes on the scene. Amen. Amen. And this is the Lord's day that you and I live in. Amen. When he fully comes, he will come in judgment. Amen. But when he comes to you and I, it is in mercy. Amen. It is a help. It's a strength. It's a supernatural strength. It's a supernatural pouring out. Amen. It's no longer Amen. about a man, but it's about the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is the Lord's day. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let him have his way &gt;&gt; in your life. &gt;&gt; Let him have his way in your need. &gt;&gt; Don't worry about it. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Don't fear. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. For I am alive. Amen. Now I am he that was dead and behold I am alive forever more. Amen. When Jesus rose again. Amen. That was the Lord's day. Man put him in the tomb. Come on Jonah. Amen. Man put him in the tomb. Amen. But the Lord's day came. Amen. And a resurrection took place. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; The Lord's day. It is the day of his power. &gt;&gt; It is the day of his authority &gt;&gt; identified in a bride body. That stone, &gt;&gt; that stone, amen, that caps off the bride, that caps off you and I, that headship that is identified. Amen. Amen. It comes in a bride body that is upon the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. What is it tonight? What is it? It's your everything. &gt;&gt; It's your everything. When it crushes everything else, Amen. And when it destroys everything else, it brings you victory. It brings you joy unspeakable and full of glory. It brings you faith. It brings you healing. It brings the resurrection quickening power in your body. It's everything to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Satan's had his way, amen, with our lives. Amen. He could only have his way. I'm going to lose my voice. He could only have his way for a short period of time. Amen. But when the Lord come on the scene, Amen. Amen. God be to have his way. And it brought a quickening power. Amen. It is your everything in this hour. That headship, that stone that Daniel seen is your everything. It is your body change. &gt;&gt; It is the rapture to you and I. It's faith enough for the rapture. &gt;&gt; It's the Lord's day. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; The 17th week of Daniel, but the true church all over the world has shaped down. &gt;&gt; Yeah. through all the ages to a place that there's come a ministry among us just exactly like the ministry of Jesus Christ. That's what it took in this hour. &gt;&gt; The works that I do shall ye do also. &gt;&gt; The day when the son of man is revealed. Amen. Jesus couldn't come back to do that. He had to work through his body. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; And a ministry come among us. Amen. to unite us not with itself but to unite the bridegroom and the bride. That was the purpose of this ministry. Amen. And then and it come down through the ages and it and God through Luther and Wesley and Pentecost and on down. Amen. We're we're honing down. We're honing down and it's getting tighter. It's getting closer. Amen. But it had it had to come to that place. Amen. For a ministry. It took a ministry to bring us to to that place where this headstone could come, where the Lord &gt;&gt; could have his day. &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; Very good. &gt;&gt; He said it's just like the ministry of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; He said, now what they got? They got the thing in condition. Now what's the next thing? This rejected stone of the pyramid cut out of the mountain without what? Without hands. God sent it. Do you see it? The congregation says, "Amen." The rejected one. The rejected stone is the head of this. It's the head of the capstone. And the very one that they've rejected through the gentile age is Christ. And Christ was not cut and put out here in here as a valker or son of God. Listen to this. Or some great dignitarian in the church. He is the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; He is the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the cap of the pyramid will be Christ coming. &gt;&gt; Do you see it? He said, "Hallelujah. What happened at that time? The coming of that stone up with the church in the glory." &gt;&gt; Amen. The coming of the stone, the coming of the headship identifies that the rapture is just close at hand. Church. Amen. The things that we've seen, the things that we've heard. Amen. It's to let you know who's here. It's to let you know, Amen. that that the day of man is over. that Satan's time is over. Amen. Amen. For a for a little bit of time here. For a little bit of time, when the word has been restored, God's got full access. God's got full Amen. He's got hearts that are open, amen, to his fullness that he can pour himself into that God can have his way with. &gt;&gt; He is the Holy Spirit. [panting] &gt;&gt; Quit waiting for something else to come. Quit waiting for something something greater to come down the road. He is here. &gt;&gt; The capstone is here. Amen. We We're We're We're not waiting for something. He's here. We're not waiting for another ministry to show up. Amen. Quit waiting on me to try to tell you something. Amen. Amen. To to to to get you worked up. Amen. What we've seen, what we've heard, what we've witnessed. Amen. What God has done for us is enough. &gt;&gt; And he is the Holy Spirit. I say tonight that God is not limited. Amen. But he is unlimited. I say tonight, amen. He is the absolute. He is the final say. He is our everything tonight. Amen. Amen. And he is here present. &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts] &gt;&gt; He is the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Behold, I go away. &gt;&gt; But a comforter will come. &gt;&gt; The comforter is here tonight &gt;&gt; because Jesus said he would be. Jesus, if he was standing here in flesh, he could do no more for you than what he's already done. and the revealed word of the hour. Amen. That ministry brought us to to a vision. Amen. More than Lutheran, more than just being saved, more than just being clean, more than just gifts. Amen. But it brought us to a ministry. Amen. Where we become one with the word. [sighs] &gt;&gt; Quit putting it off somewhere else. He is the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; and he's working through his word. Amen. To those that will believe him, &gt;&gt; those that will trust him, he will manifest himself to them if you can believe him. If you can trust him. &gt;&gt; How do we come to this place where the capstone can come? How do we come to this place where the headship can just take full control? And brother, brother Ben's preaching about adoption. And and I believe that that's this age. No other age could come to the place of adoption, a maturity because there was nothing there to mature them. There was not a there was not an open word there to mature them. And we we just you know that becomes just a term. Amen. But but it's the fullness of the word. It's the fullness of the effect. You understand? It's not a head knowledge. It's not a doctrine. But it's the effect. It's the Holy Spirit unleashed. Just like Satan wants to be unleashed on people's lives, the Holy Spirit wants to be unleashed on our lives to take the word and to manifest it through sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; But how do we get to that place? It takes some trials. &gt;&gt; It takes some hardships. &gt;&gt; It takes some battles. &gt;&gt; It takes separation. &gt;&gt; It takes shaving off. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And judgment, the Bible says, begins at the house of God. &gt;&gt; So, as sons and daughters of God, if we're sons and daughters of God, God has to correct you. &gt;&gt; If if if we're his seed, he can't let us continue in error. He can't continue to to let us be uh uh uh doing things that are wrong. &gt;&gt; And so, it takes the correction of the word. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. It takes the Holy Spirit. Hey now, &gt;&gt; quit doing that. &gt;&gt; That little tug, &gt;&gt; you understand? &gt;&gt; More than sometimes more than a tug, it takes it takes some hard preaching. &gt;&gt; It takes some stern speaking, right? &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; What would we really do if we heard hard preaching? Would we run off? Would we quit? &gt;&gt; Oh, we say, "Lord, Amen. shame me down. I want to be right. And that's the attitude of the believer. That's the attitude of a son or daughter of God that can take correction &gt;&gt; because they know it's for their good. They know it's from the father and they the father has their best interest. &gt;&gt; It takes some willingness to be cut to size. &gt;&gt; It's not going to be sticking out over here. And but the pyramid's coming up. It's honed in &gt;&gt; and the the capstone's got to come down on that. It can't come down here at the bottom. It wouldn't look right. &gt;&gt; So, it's got to be perfect. &gt;&gt; It's got to be perfect. &gt;&gt; And only God can do that. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; You can't do it yourself. &gt;&gt; We can't perfect ourselves. So, it takes the word. &gt;&gt; It takes being subject to the word by the Holy Spirit. And without the Holy Spirit, you will never subject yourself to the word. &gt;&gt; It takes some growing up and maturing to be perfected and properly placed as sons and daughters of the living God. You know, and I like to act like a kid, you know. I'm almost 40 years old and I I I don't want to be 40 years old, but you know what? But the older you get, as time goes on, you know, you you got to be a man. And sometimes you just got to put yourself dead last, right? &gt;&gt; I'm not trying to tell a sob story or nothing. &gt;&gt; But you got to as you grow up, you prioritize things the best you can. And it doesn't become about you, but it becomes about the ones around you, &gt;&gt; right? And so we mature. We we let things go &gt;&gt; and we move on to higher things, right? &gt;&gt; Amen. There's a higher place in Christ that I want to go to. &gt;&gt; Higher than what I've been what I am today, what I was. I've been serving the Lord now for 20 years. 2005 October. God saved me. 20 years. And but if I haven't grown from that, what am I doing? What is the effect effectiveness? If this word is effective, what what am I doing? What are we doing here? But there's a higher plane. There's a higher calling. No matter how long you've been in the way, there's a maturing that we can come to. Even the prophet of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. A hunter. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; A hunter love to kill game. But there on the mountain when the snowstorm and you know what happened? He spoke to the storm. And there there that animal there presented itself. And amen. There there God said, "Won't you just walk with me?" Heaven, "Won't you just walk with me?" And he he couldn't even bring himself to kill that animal. Oh my. Such experiences. Amen. Where where it's not more so much of the earthly, but it's of the heavenly. &gt;&gt; Amen. To walk in that that atmosphere is what I long for. &gt;&gt; I'm still going to kill a deer tomorrow if it walks out in the woods, though. [snorts] If I if I can &gt;&gt; if I don't miss. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Big buck, right? [clears throat] But it takes growing up. It takes maturing to be properly placed. But [clears throat] it it will be worth it in the in the end &gt;&gt; to purpose in your heart to serve God through all of that, through all the hardships, the trials, to to stay with it. Amen. To purpose it will be worth it in the end, to let the Lord have his way. &gt;&gt; Daniel 2:46. And there Daniel interpreted the dream. But the Bible says, "And Neba, the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face and worshiped Daniel and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odors unto him." My guy's pretty messed up, isn't he? He don't know what's going on, man. But that's the world. But the pagan king, you imagine this, he was so troubled by his dreams, by by the by what he seen. He was so he was so troubled and Daniel revealed to him. But the pagan king no doubt was so relieved that he was free from this. He was so impressed by what he saw the display of the power of the one true God. So to reveal the secrets of the heart and there he made Daniel a ruler over the whole pro province of Babylon and put him over all these wise men. And there he made an image for worship. &gt;&gt; The image of this prophet And so here they're all looking at this image, standing there, man, confused, &gt;&gt; man. This is just this guy right over here. He ain't been here very long. We're going to make an image. We're going to worship him. But they're there in confusion. And all they can do and all the world can do is just take part. That's all they know how to do. All they know know how to do is just fall in line. Young people, the world, they all they know how to do is just to be led by by whoever else. Don't be led by whoever else. Be led by God. &gt;&gt; Be led by by by somebody who's a Christian that you know is a Christian. Let that person influence your life. Don't let the world that will go after whatever whatever old spirit, whatever old evil thing, they'll they'll worship. They'll put whatever in front of them. Amen. Don't be influenced by that. Be influenced by real people of God. Amen. Amen. Listen to the prophet of God. Amen. Put that before you. Put the word before you. Amen. Tired about your Amen. Your bed post. Amen. Amen. Let it be anchored in your heart. &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; Don't Don't partake of the confusion. Don't partake of the chaos because that's all that it is. That's all they know. That's all they know how to do. There was no life or power in the image of that man of God. He was a man of God, but there was no life in that image. &gt;&gt; And as great as he was, there was no life. There was nothing behind him. Amen. And there's no real power in the relics, but in the God of Daniel, there was power. Amen. Amen. When when Elisha When Elijah went away, Amen. Elisha didn't say, "Amen. Elijah, come back." He said, "Where is the God of Elijah?" Amen. He didn't cry for Elijah to come back. Elijah had fulfilled his purpose. Amen. But Elisha said, "Amen. I want a double portion." Amen. I I don't want to I don't just want to be like the man. Amen. I want the spirit of God that was on the man to come back upon me. Amen. And give me a double portion. Amen. Don't cut yourself short here tonight. He is the Holy Spirit. He is our portion. Amen. And our portion is more than it's ever been to any age it's ever been. Amen. Call out to God. He is available tonight. He is available. Amen. Amen. For power. Amen. For for glory. Amen. He is here tonight. He is available. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Amen. The power of God, it was more than an image that God put on display, &gt;&gt; but God worked through Daniel. Amen. And it's it's more than some picture or some image. Amen. Today, it's more than some mental conception. But there's a real true and living God on the throne tonight. &gt;&gt; And by faith, if you can catch a vision and believe from the heart, he can be made known. &gt;&gt; It's more than a mental conception. &gt;&gt; There's a literal, Brother Ram said, there's a literal Jesus Christ on the throne tonight. There's a that that body is he said that body is somewhere. That body is somewhere. That person is somewhere in what he is. Amen. You can he can be touched tonight by the feeling of your infirmities. Amen. You believe that tonight he's a real God. &gt;&gt; He's not a mental conception. He's not a picture on the wall, but he's a real and living God that God come down. Amen. In in in our day and revealed the secrets of the heart. Amen. in the second pool. Amen. To grab our attention, amen. But more than that, amen. He revealed himself in the third pull and the opening of the word. And that's what caught the attention of the true believer. Amen. That that power of that fullness, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; It's available to you tonight. &gt;&gt; It's it can be more real than what we're seeing here tonight. Today, tonight. Amen. We've got to look beyond the unseen, &gt;&gt; but beyond the scene, rather, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And see the unseen. &gt;&gt; Right. And I'm just preaching. &gt;&gt; Well, we look here. What did Daniel do? Daniel purposed in his heart to not defile himself with the king's meat. He purposed within himself to stay true to God. No matter who his earthly ruler was, no matter where he was, no, no matter where he was or what anybody else give him to, he was going to stay true. &gt;&gt; Is that what you want to do in this hour? &gt;&gt; Daniel had been caught up into the Lord's day. &gt;&gt; He wasn't caught up into the false worship, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; He wasn't He wasn't interested in building a kingdom unto himself. He knew that it was God. He knew that it wasn't him &gt;&gt; and he wasn't interested in those things because he had been caught up. He had seen a vision of the Lord's day. He seen what was going to take place. He had caught a vision of the power of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Gabriel's instructions to Daniel. But he had been in the very midst Daniel with nobody but three companions them in different parts of the kingdom. But Daniel standing alone with God held the victory for 68 years. &gt;&gt; He had kept the victory and was undefiled before God without the baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Without the blood of Jesus Christ to make intercessions for him, with only the blood of bulls and goats and heers which he had to offer secretly, he said because of the heathens and traditions of that land, &gt;&gt; Daniel and them could stand there without a birth. &gt;&gt; Yeah. without a birth of the word. They could stand there without the Holy Ghost. Why? Because they were the children of the promise by the flesh. &gt;&gt; Children of Abraham, heirs of promise, not of the spiritual but by flesh. &gt;&gt; And they came and they overcame the gate which was a promise to the children of Abraham. They overcame the gate of the enemy by holding the truth of the promise and having the faith to put themselves as part of the promise. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; To see themselves in the word. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Abraham was gone. Isaac was gone. Jacob was gone. Moses was gone. Joshua was gone. Everybody was gone. But Amen. They were prom they were they were children of the promise nonetheless. Amen. They were children of Abraham. They were part of the promise. Amen. It didn't matter if the prophets had went off the scene. Amen. There was people in the land. Amen. And they were in the awfulst of of situation. They were slaves. They didn't have no friends. They didn't have the They didn't have the word. They didn't have the Holy Ghost. All they had was the blood of boys and goats. But yet, they kept the victory. &gt;&gt; Why? Because they were a part of the promise. They seen themselves in the word. &gt;&gt; See yourselves in the word tonight. See yourselves in healing. See yourself in joy. See yourself in deliverance. It's yours tonight. It don't matter how long the prophet's been gone off the scene. It ain't got nothing to do with it. This ain't about a man. This ain't about the worship of a prophet. Amen. But it's about the Lord's day. It's about God making himself real. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I can't preach it no harder than that. &gt;&gt; Good buddy. Come on. &gt;&gt; They overcame. We have no excuse tonight. &gt;&gt; We have no excuse. &gt;&gt; You ought to There ought to be a shout of the king in the camp tonight. &gt;&gt; This ought to be the loudest place in hearty Arkansas. &gt;&gt; You ought to be the most happiest people on the face of the planet. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Good preaching. &gt;&gt; They seen themselves in the word. They can look at the promise even how God was with Abraham. Even when Abraham wasn't in the land. Amen. God had a way of seeing Abraham back. &gt;&gt; God had a way of seeing Abraham through it. And that's the promise of the believer in this hour. We get out of step, &gt;&gt; but you're a believer &gt;&gt; and you'll God will make a way for you to get back. Amen. And and there will even be a blessing at the end of it because you are ordained of God to sit in this seat tonight. You're ordained of God to believe the message of the hour. You're ordained in the Leodysian church age to be a Christian and to be a light and to see yourselves in the word. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so it is to all the children of Abraham. Amen. All of all of the seed of Abraham, the children of promise, those who will separate from the chaos, from the confusion of this world, you can inherit all things. &gt;&gt; The gate of your enemy will not overtake you, but you can possess it. Whatever that may be, you can possess it. You can keep the victory. &gt;&gt; He did it without the Holy Ghost. Who's got the Holy Ghost tonight? &gt;&gt; And you've got him. He is the Holy Ghost. It's not a third person. It's not the second person, but it's God. Amen. The dispensation of the Holy Ghost. Amen. Amen. God in his bride, in his church. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; But what did he do? Daniel had purpose in his heart. He held the victory. &gt;&gt; He stayed true. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Without the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; you won't make it today without it. &gt;&gt; True. It wasn't available then. The blood of Jesus hadn't been shed, but it has now. It's available tonight. It's available to you tonight. That created blood cell that held the victory that we needed was broken. And the life and the nature of God has been released. &gt;&gt; Only only the new birth will hold in this hour. No other experience, no emotional experience will bring you through or bring you to the realization that you're part of the word but the new birth. First John 5:4, for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world. &gt;&gt; And this is the victory that overcomemeth the world, even our faith. &gt;&gt; And brother Ram preaches a sermon. He says, why why some people can't keep the victory. What a what a title. He said, "Now notice the church doesn't need a polishing. It doesn't need a facelifting. It needs a birth." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Aren't you thankful for a birth? &gt;&gt; When you when you couldn't when you when you tried when you tried to serve God and you couldn't, God provided a new birth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He provided the the birth of the Holy Ghost in your life. &gt;&gt; He said it needs a birth. It needs a conversion. It needs some something's got to happen. Something's got to take place, young people. Yeah, &gt;&gt; it's more than more than knowing who Brother Brandham is. And our brother Joe brought that out and really drill it in. It's more than knowing the the tapes and the books. Amen. Something's got to take place. Something's got to happen. Amen. And when something happens, Amen. You got something to go back to when things begin to go wrong. You got something. You got an anchor down within you that will hold you. &gt;&gt; And you can go back and you can say, "I know on this day the Lord done this for me." Amen. And it was a it was it was a point of contact. Amen. It was a victory in your life. It's where the victory began and where the defeat ended. Amen. And that's what the Holy Ghost is. Amen. Amen. It's where the defeat ends and the victory begins. And it's victory after victory after victory. Amen. And it is hard. It is a struggle. There is ups and downs. Amen. There there is things that you got to go through. Amen. But the Holy Ghost, which is him, he will see you through. &gt;&gt; Yeah. The new birth, a word birth isn't only is your only way of living a victorious life. That's the only way that we can truly stand. When the word is born in you, when the word is born in us, it produces Jesus Christ. It produces the word in flesh. And it is this body. It it is this body is subject. It makes his body subject to the word by the spirit. What is it? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It's overcoming the pressure. The outside pressure, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Because because the outside is trying to affect the inside. &gt;&gt; If the Holy Ghost is in there, if the Holy Ghost is inside, that means that God is sealed in and the devil is sealed out. &gt;&gt; So, the only way that he can attack you is from the outside. You're you're sealed to the day of your redemption. &gt;&gt; Sealed until the day of your redemption. Till the body change. If you live long enough to see it. If I live long enough to see it. Satan has no right or property. No, no, no ruler, no anything over that part of you. But the outside pressure is where he comes in. And the victory, amen, that the Holy Ghost produces, Amen. Amen. Amen. The life that it produces, Amen, inside you. Amen. Amen. Only only in in in that life in that inner man with the Holy Ghost being in there can you withstand the pressure that Satan has so produced in this age. &gt;&gt; Only with that &gt;&gt; can you withstand the pressure. &gt;&gt; It takes a birth. &gt;&gt; Daniel could do it. &gt;&gt; We can't. Daniel Daniel could withstand the pressure then &gt;&gt; because he was built for that for that age because he was a he was a it was a promise of the flesh &gt;&gt; but this is a spiritual kingdom &gt;&gt; and it's a spiritual battle &gt;&gt; and it's a real battle and it's a pressure that doesn't let up. It's a pressure that that doesn't doesn't give in. Amen. And it takes the constant flowing of the Holy Ghost his present presence to overcome And that's what the word birth produces. &gt;&gt; It's not an emotion. It's not It's more than an emotion. It's a life. It's a sustaining life. And I know we know that, but I just wanted to wanted to cow down on that for a minute. What is it? It's the overcoming of the flesh. &gt;&gt; Because if Satan can control this, then he can break you down. But if this is subject to the word, Satan, he his his hands are tied. His hands are tied. You see, &gt;&gt; but flesh and blood, flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God. And this corruption cannot inherit corruption. Amen. It takes something from within to inherit. It takes something from within to overcome. All right, we'll move on here. Lord help us. But I like what we read in the beginning there. Daniel refused to bow to that image. &gt;&gt; Right, &gt;&gt; man? I don't know what y'all are talking about. I ain't I ain't nobody, man. I don't know why y'all made an image of me. I ain't nobody. I ain't bowing to that. But again, imagine those rulers looking at that image. But Daniel knew who the one true God was. &gt;&gt; Y'all can y'all can be in that confusion all you want. If you want to worship a prophet, you can do that if you want. I'm not partaking in that. &gt;&gt; Y'all can do whatever you want to do. &gt;&gt; But Daniel knew who the one true God was. He knew, amen, that God was the one that revealed those secrets. &gt;&gt; Right. And brother Brandham will tell us I I wasn't the one, right? I wasn't the one at the river that day. That was him that spoke out. I was just standing there. Amen. I'm not the one that does these things. I'm just standing there when he does it. It's not me. &gt;&gt; And we put so much on that. And our faith looks back to that. And and but where's your faith now? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Where's your faith now, Hebrew children? Yeah. &gt;&gt; Where's your faith at now? &gt;&gt; Daniel's nowhere around. &gt;&gt; He cannot help you. &gt;&gt; He cannot help you one bit, but he he is the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; He is the power and he is the authority. &gt;&gt; Amen. That can take the word that was ministered to you and I and make it live in us and that we can overcome. &gt;&gt; He that overcomemeth will be granted to sit with me in my throne. Not that he that eases by, &gt;&gt; not that he that squeaks by and lives any old way, but he that overcomemeth. He that stays true to me will be he will sit with me and not throne. &gt;&gt; He Daniel knew it wasn't him. He knew it was God. Amen. And it wasn't about Daniel. It was about God. Daniel knew there was only one true and living God. He knew that there was only only one. There was one other greater than himself. There was only one who could keep him and deliver him. And his trust wasn't in what he was, but the staying power of the God of heaven. In &gt;&gt; 1956, the handwriting on the wall. Brother says, "I want you to notice at the beginning of the Gentiles when God dealt with them, they got hotty in their heart and forced every man to worship the image of a holy man. And the Gentile age was issued in with that. It will go out the same way. a boycott of the mark of the beast that will force people to worship images and do the things that we've been taught that was contrary to the word of God. And brother, it'll be so slick and sly until it will deceive the very elect &gt;&gt; if possible. Come on now. &gt;&gt; He said, "So you better purpose in your heart." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Tonight and be filled with God's Holy Spirit that you'll be able to discern the right and the wrong thing &gt;&gt; when the proclamation is issued. Hallelujah. So he's telling you there's a worship coming. The way it started is the way that it will end. &gt;&gt; Oh my. We have heard a cry. We have heard a cry in this hour. Come out of her, my people. And be ye not partakers of her sin. Come out. The cry went forth to come out of the confusion. Come out of those harlot symptoms. And many of you sitting here tonight, you you can testify that. And when you came out, oh, how how the light shone. How the light shone. Amen. And and you were illuminated in the time of darkness. You were sleeping. You were you were asleeping. You were dead as a dead person in those those denominations. Amen. But a light shone. A voice came forth and you awoken. You were awaken out of sleep. Amen. From those denominational systems. Amen. Many of you done that. But what about tonight? What about in 2025? Where is the deception that would try to catch the elect if it were possible? It's not out there. But he said it'll be so close. Amen. What happened? It started with the forced worship of a man. Amen. And it will end with the worship of a man. You won't be tempted to worship a pope. But what about a man of God with a special revelation that only a few can understand and teach? &gt;&gt; What about Amen. making more out of the prophet than what even God made out of him. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. When we begin to draw lines and put people under fear, Amen. If they don't receive a certain doctrine, that is forced worship. &gt;&gt; When we make everything about a prophet, Amen. And we make everything a prophet said, "Thus sayeth the Lord, and if you don't believe it, then you can't be the bride, part of the bride." That is a fearbased religion. That is a forced worship upon the people, upon your congregation. Amen. When Amen. when they when the new begin to sing more Amen. When we begin to sing more about a prophet than our Lord and Savior, that is idol worship. You idolize a man that needed the same redeeming power as anyone else, as you and I. Amen. This isn't the day of a man. What is it? What is this day? Daniel saw it. John saw it. John said, "I was in the spirit on the Lord's day." And John seen the whole thing played out. And brother Bram said John was a type of the bribe. Amen. And a prophet came and opened the word to us by the Holy Ghost. By the Holy Ghost. And we have been caught up in that tonight. Amen. This isn't man's age. This is the Lord's age. Lord, give me breath in my lungs tonight. Amen. We have been unearthed. We've been brought out of the chaos. We have been brought out of the confusion. Amen. By the opening of the word, the seals have been revealed and a loosening power has been released to you and I. This isn't man's day. This is the Lord's day. This is the eagle age. Amen. Amen. And you tonight are under a prophetic anointing. Amen. And it is going from the prophet to the prophecy. Amen. From what was said to things that ought to be. Amen. And to us has been released faith for this age to overcome. Faith to believe what the message has for us. Preach with me tonight. Amen. In this age, Amen. That fullness of the word has been open. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Not for what what you want. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But what you need. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; What do you need tonight? The Holy Ghost is here to provide it. Amen. Amen. To move upon the scene. Amen. What do you need tonight, little Hattie? Do you need your children? What do you need tonight? What's your desire? Amen. Is it filtered through the word of God or is it or is it earthly based? Amen. The word of God has br has come to bring us, Amen, from an earthly to a heavenly mindset. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, &gt;&gt; this is the Lord's day. Daniel's seen it. John seen it. And you're living in it. You're here. You're here partaking. This is his day. &gt;&gt; It is the omnipotent sovereign God who has been made known to you and I. This is the age of adoption when sons of God. It's not not the day of man. It's not the day of any old religion, but it's the age of adoption when sons of God are manifested. When we have received empowerment by his omnipotence in our midst. &gt;&gt; Fear not, John. Fear not, little flock. Fear not. &gt;&gt; All my power is yours. &gt;&gt; All my omnipotence is yours. In the church age book, I have not come to bring you fear or failure, but I've come to bring you courage, love, and ability. Amen. And I am the omnipotent one standing in your midst. Reading that from the church age book. Amen. It is the omnipotent, sovereign God who's been made known. Friends, it's more than God sent a prophet tonight. &gt;&gt; It's so much more than that. Amen. It is the bride and the bridegroom becoming one. This is the Lord's day. &gt;&gt; God's provide a place of worship. 1965, if you're part of the bride, you are because the bride is part of the groom, you know. So, we find out that it's the same thing. And she'll do just exactly what's predicted for her to do in this day. She won't be a leo to sin. Not by no means a lukewarm, but she'll be on fire for God. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; She'll be moving on in the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Daniel stood. The prophet has came and stood. What? What are we going to do? &gt;&gt; Hebrew children, &gt;&gt; what are we going to do? There was a few young believers that knew their God. true children of Abraham. Everybody else was bowing down &gt;&gt; like it was nothing. &gt;&gt; Oh, that's there's Daniel. Okay. All right. But they weren't willing under the persecution, the threat of fire to even bend a knee to save their lives. &gt;&gt; All they had to do was bend down. &gt;&gt; All they had to do and they wouldn't have to go through nothing. &gt;&gt; Hey, you can get up. God forgive me. No, &gt;&gt; it was a test, &gt;&gt; it was a test, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Believers don't live under a forced religion. &gt;&gt; We serve God because we love God. &gt;&gt; And we love him because he first loved us. &gt;&gt; No, none of us have to be here, but we're here &gt;&gt; because we love him. &gt;&gt; We're not here because it's easy. Come on. &gt;&gt; We're here because it's hard. &gt;&gt; We don't want it to be easy. &gt;&gt; Believers are tough. &gt;&gt; You're tough tonight. &gt;&gt; You're tough. And the devil can blow and blow and blow. &gt;&gt; Believers don't bluff. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because they won't make their stand. &gt;&gt; They weren't they weren't willing through the the threat of burning alive &gt;&gt; to bend their knee. &gt;&gt; Don't give up so easy. There's a victory that you can have tonight. Daniel 3:14 Nebuchadnezzar spake and said to them, "Is it true, oh Shadrach, Meshach, Abedneo? Do do not you serve my gods, nor worship the the golden image which I have set up. Now if you be ready that at what time you hear the sound of the cornet, the flute, the harp, a s whatever that is sack, but sultry and doul I am so sorry. and all kinds of music you fall down and worship the image which I have made. Well, but if ye worship not, ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace. And who is that God thou shall deliver you out of this out of my hands? And I love this verse 16. Daniel 3:16, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered and said to the king, "Oh Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to answer thee in this matter. If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace. And he will deliver us out of thine hand, O king. Listen to this. But if not, &gt;&gt; be it known unto thee, oh king, that we will not serve thy gods, &gt;&gt; nor worship the golden image which thou set up. They testified. &gt;&gt; They had a testimony service there. They got together. They had a little meeting about it. brother, God's able. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; God's able. And we're going to tell the king this. And they told the king that. &gt;&gt; And they said, "If the king says this, then we're going to say this and say, "Even if he don't, &gt;&gt; even if if he don't do it, we believe that he can, but if he don't, Amen. We're still not bending the knee." &gt;&gt; Praise. &gt;&gt; And brother Ram said in 1965 and ashamed, he said Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego wasn't afraid of the fiery furnace. He said, "Our God is able to deliver us, but if he don't, we're not bound out." He said, "They wasn't ashamed of it." No, sir. No, sir. They certainly wasn't ashamed of it because they knew. &gt;&gt; They knew where they stood. &gt;&gt; They knew where they were standing. They They were positive. &gt;&gt; They were positive that God was able to see them through. Amen. And even if he didn't, they still wouldn't bow. Oh my. Tonight, things can get real tense. The trial. Amen. The trials can get hot. Amen. But that's when a believer presses on. That's when you shine as a bride of Jesus Christ. Amen. The trial can become fiery. Things can look real dark, but it's under pressure. When a genuine faith is made known, amen. And you've got to stand there. You've got to stand there and be positive. Amen. Despite all the negative, Amen. And that type of faith is what brings God on the scene. &gt;&gt; That's true. He says, "And I know 1960." "And when your faith is put to a test, then don't fail. Stay right with what you believe." &gt;&gt; And then their faith was put to a a test and they went to a crucial hour. Not only did they not only did they go to ash sheet, but they went to a fiery furnace, but Satan could not destroy them, for God's purpose wasn't fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Amen. God's purpose has got to be fulfilled. It's got to be seen through. They could go in there with this hope. He says that I know my redeemer liveth. &gt;&gt; They could go in there with this hope. We are assured that God is able to deliver us from this fiery furnace. But nevertheless, we will not bow to the image. &gt;&gt; Help me preach tonight. In those times, we've got to know &gt;&gt; in sickness, you have to know that he is the Lord who heals all thy disease and all thy sicknesses. When things are hard, you have to know that God is able to deliver you from all your troubles and that he is your refuge, that he is your hiding place. Amen. To know that he is the author and the finisher of your faith. Amen. To know that he called you and will see you through it. If God called you to it, God will see you through it. You've got to know that he is the same yesterday, today, and forever. Amen. To know that he is working all things for your good. Amen. And the Hebrew children knew God's ability to change a situation. Amen. They knew his ability to part the waters. They knew his ability to show up in a time of battle. And that this is the Lord's battle. Amen. They knew at that point of their trial that all they could do was stand still and see the deliverance, see the salvation of God. &gt;&gt; They knew &gt;&gt; that that's all they could do. &gt;&gt; There's nothing else they could do but that. again. And I know my redeemer liveth. I got a few more minutes about 30. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; help us, Jesus. Deliver us, Lord. I know my redeemer liveth. Kind of the same same title there. He said, "We think of the Hebrew children when God had a purpose for them. when they were down a bad one and the furnace, listen to this, [snorts] and the furnace was hit. I don't know where it got hit from, seven times harder than it ever was heated to destroy the purpose of God. The fire was heated to destroy the purpose of God for the children. &gt;&gt; Amen. Those Hebrew children. &gt;&gt; And he said, "And all Babylon was on a rage. Satan was determined to destroy the purpose of God. For he knew those children was going in that furnace." Listen to this. So he made the furnace. Amen. when he he hit it seven times hotter to be sure the program of God would be destroyed. But listen to this. But God wanted to display his power and all Babylon and all hell could not defeat that purpose. No sir. No matter if they could have heated it that furnace a million times hotter. It would have never been destroyed. The never destroyed the purpose of God. God wanted to show that he was a God of deliverance and that he he'd bring deliverance to whomever desired. Amen. to bring it and nothing would interfere with his program. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; R said, "Fire cannot defeat God's purpose." &gt;&gt; Your fiery trials, &gt;&gt; come on, &gt;&gt; are for your good. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Your fiery trials cannot defeat God's purpose. &gt;&gt; Satan wants to take you out. He wants to destroy you. &gt;&gt; But the fiery trial cannot defeat &gt;&gt; God's purpose. He says, "Oh, how I love to say this this morning. All the hydrogen bombs in the world can never defeat the resurrection of his church. All the explaining away and all the mathematics and so forth. Amen. That this intelligent world is disguised through her her purpose to do something about to destroy the faith of God's children. It will never do it. That faith will live forever. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Will that faith live forever? &gt;&gt; Will the purpose of God in your life be destroyed? &gt;&gt; No. That faith will live forever. &gt;&gt; Amen. You can stand tonight. I got quite a bit more here, but I won't hold you. Daniel 3:20. I lied, didn't I? I can't. I got to finish this. I'm sorry. Daniel 3:20. And he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abedneo, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace. The Bible [music] says that fire was so hot that it slew the men who took up the Hebrew children. &gt;&gt; And there at the last moment, all Babylon is raging, the king is raging, the king gave his commandment. It looked like [music] defeat for the children of Israel. All Babylon, all hell was against him. But all the power in [music] heaven stood ready to move. &gt;&gt; Amen. There stands his majesty. There we seen the earthly scene play out, but there was a heavenly scene playing out. And brother Brandham describes that. There stands his majesty, the great attribute of the fullness of God, the pillar of fire, the Lord of hosts, the Lord that is mighty in battle. There he's standing. Amen. [music] His majesty on his throne. They're watching his children there with his angels all around him. &gt;&gt; Brother Brown tells a story how here moves up the angel Wormwood. &gt;&gt; The angel who controls all the waters. &gt;&gt; He looks down. Master, have you looked down there at these believers? &gt;&gt; I watched them all night. &gt;&gt; Oh, church, heaven's watching. &gt;&gt; They don't never take their eyes off of you. &gt;&gt; They see what you're going through tonight. I may not see it. This brother may not see it, but God sees what you're going through. &gt;&gt; Heaven has has all your attention. Heaven's watching. He's saying there, "Let me go down at thy command and bring a flood to destroy Babylon and put out that [music] fire." Here comes another angel, Michael. He said that great angel that stands in the presence of God there with the sword ready drawn to go down at the king's command. Brother said these angels both could have went down and delivered at the moment of command. And [music] here he says and I can hear him say Michael you've obeyed me since the day I created you. But I can't let you go [music] because I'm going I'm going myself. This is a mansized job. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And there he raises up off of his seat there, God, the fullness of the attribute, the Lord of hosts. And there he grabs a light and bold and he rides down just before the moment. And I believe I believe that he was in the fire before they even got close to it. Amen. And he's in your trial tonight. &gt;&gt; He's in the fire tonight before you can even get close to it. I believe God is waiting for you there tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. There he rides it on down and brother Random depicts a story. Amen. He stops in just [music] enough time to get a palm branch and there he's in the fire. And there they get thrown in the fire. Amen. But what was it? What kept them from burning? What kept their clothes from getting singed? It was the very presence of the fourth man. Amen. The king looked down and said, "Did we not cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? Lo, I see the fourth man walking down there." Amen. They're walking around. Amen. Amen. What were they singing? What were they doing? I don't think they were down there whispering, "What's going on? What's going on?" But I believe they were in worship. Amen. They were in the presence of the fourth man. Brother said, "Amen. Who is the fourth man?" He said, "It's Jesus Christ." They asked him the question. They said, "Was that Daniel the prophet?" He said, "No, that was Jesus Christ." &gt;&gt; Amen. The fourth man, God didn't descend. Amen. An angel. He didn't descend a man. He came himself. Amen. It was the Lord on the scene. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. He was in the midst of their child. &gt;&gt; Brother B said he took the fire and he turned [music] the keys and he unlocked the power of that fire to loosen their bands. Oh my. I can I [music] can think they were down there rejoicing, praising God, having a good time. They weren't worried about the flames. They were singing, "He's an on time God." Yes, he is. Yeah. &gt;&gt; I [music] said he's an on time God. &gt;&gt; Yes, he is. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's in the fire tonight. He He's there, church. Brother B says he he never [music] leaves. He's always near. The angel of the Lord encamps about those who fear him. Amen. Do you love the Lord tonight? &gt;&gt; Amen. Fight the good fight [music] of faith. Timothy said, Paul said to Timothy, "Lay hold on eternal life where unto [music] thou art called, has professed a good profession before many witnesses." Amen. As believers, we can't [music] just hold the truth of God lightly. Amen. But hold on to it. &gt;&gt; Amen. God will make a way by that. He'll he'll bring deliverance. Amen. Do you love the Lord tonight? Amen. Let's just bow our hearts before him. Amen. Heavenly Father, we love you tonight, Lord. We thank you [music] for who you are. Oh, we believe that you're the same yesterday, today, and forever, Lord. Lord, walk [music] with us, Lord, in this latest and age. Be with us, Lord. Bring us up higher than what what we are. Lord, help us. You're our refuge. You're our stay, Lord. You're our help. Oh, how we need you. How we need you to come on the scene, Lord. May may we not shut you out, but Lord, may we just in invite you into every room of our heart, every part of our life, everything that we're going through, everything that we've been holding [music] on to. May we we've been struggling for years with things. Oh God, come in the midst of the fire, that which was meant to destroy us. Oh God, come on the [music] scene now. Help your people. Everything that they go through, everything that they face, Lord, we just commit them to you tonight. We love you in Jesus name we pray. &gt;&gt; I Lord [singing] and they on the storms [singing] of life like my Lord. Oh, he [singing] gives rest to the [music] weary, gives new [singing] life to the hopeless. [singing] There's no doubt, oh, about him. He's [music] my Lord. You believe he's our Lord tonight?

Sing [music] it every [singing] hour. I need thee. Oh, won't you bless me [music and singing] now, my savior? [singing] I come to [music] I wonder if we just worship him for a moment now. Oh, I need [singing and music] thee. Oh, I need thee. Yes, we do, Lord. Oh, every [singing] [music] hour I need thee. [music and singing] Oh, just bless thee now. My savior [singing] I come to one more time with your hands up to him. Do you need him [singing and music] here tonight? Oh, I need thee. Oh, I need [singing and music] thee.

My [singing and music] savior. I [singing] come [music] to thee. [singing] Just play that for just a moment before we go. Amen. How many knows he's here tonight? Amen. The word went [music] forth and I was thinking when brother Stewart was preaching. Amen. Brother Brandham didn't come to point us to himself, [music] but he came to point us to the one that he was representing. And aren't you glad tonight that [music] we know that we don't serve a God of history, but he lifted him up out of history to show him we have a real and living God here tonight. And if you have a need among you tonight, I just wonder while we sing that one more time, if you just slip a hand up to him and say, "Lord, I need you." I don't care if it's I [music] don't care if it's health or financial or whatever it is. Amen. I believe he's here to meet every need in the building tonight. Amen. He's come to vindicate his word that was preached here this evening. I feel him here and I hope you do too. Amen. I love it when he shows up. I hate to just rush off when he's here because I believe if you have a need and I believe every one of us have needs here in the building tonight and I think it's just time just for a minute now. I wonder if we could just sing this to him and pray to him in your heart. Whatever your need is, just accept that he is here to do the to finish the work tonight. Amen. as we sing it now with all of our hearts. Oh, [singing] free I need thee. Oh, sing it to him. Oh, bless. Bless me now, my [singing] savior. I come [singing] to all over the building now. Let me hear you singing. Oh, singing. [music and singing] I need [music] thee. Oh, I need [singing] thee. Sing [music] it. Pray out. I need thee. [singing] Oh yes. Bee now my [singing] savior.

How many enjoyed the word of the Lord tonight for my brother Stewart? Amen. Go ahead, give the Lord a hand clap of praise. Amen. I I you know this is [applause] I've been thinking about this and studying on [music] it. Amen. There is a voice in this hour that we've had to come under subjection to. But the prophet taught us that we would be the final voice to the final age under her messenger. Aren't you glad that the bride has a voice? It's not our voice, but it's the voice of God. And I'm so thankful for it here tonight. Amen. That [music] we know when he speaks, there's authority behind it. Aren't you thankful for that tonight? Don't mean to be a crybaby, but I tell you, I just feel the presence of the Lord here tonight. And I'm thankful that the Lord would use a man, let him yield himself so that we could feed on the word of God tonight. Amen. Just before we go, I wonder if we could just sing this. Learning to lean. Same key. Well, I'm learning [singing] to lean. Oh yes, I'm [singing and music] learning how to lean. And I'm [singing] learning to lean on [singing] Jesus. And I am finding [singing] more power than I ever [music] dream. Oh yes, I'm learning [singing] to lean on Jesus. Amen. [music] Sing it as you go now. Oh, I'm learning [singing] to leave.
