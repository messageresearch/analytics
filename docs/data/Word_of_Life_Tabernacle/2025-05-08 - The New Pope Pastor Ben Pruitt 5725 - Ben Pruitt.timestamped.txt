[20:38] same. I want to get so close to him.
[20:43] It's no big change on the day that

[20:52] name. Most days I
[20:55] pray. Some days I hurt. A sad number of
[21:01] days I have put myself

[27:51] [Music]
[28:13] Out on the
[28:15] waterers, storms raging
[28:19] high. The waters around
[28:23] them trouble their mind.
[28:27] and fear filled their
[28:30] hearts. And they thought they would
[28:34] die, but they failed to
[28:37] remember. And the master was
[28:42] not he spoke the words and the winds all
[28:48] stood still.
[28:51] Even the
[28:53] waters obey his
[28:56] will. And he calmed their
[29:00] storms just like he will mind if I just
[29:07] remember. But he lives
[29:11] inside. Oh, why should I worry?
[29:16] Why should I fear when this very same
[29:22] Jesus? He is always so near. He lives in
[29:29] my heart and he hears when I
[29:33] cry. I call on his name. Till the storm
[29:39] passes by.
[29:42] We read in the
[29:44] Bible how he walked with him. He brought
[29:49] light to the
[29:52] darkness when the way he
[29:55] grew. Oh, how great it would be to have
[30:00] his footsteps in
[30:03] mind to walk with the
[30:06] master all of the time.
[30:11] And when trials
[30:14] come and death seems so
[30:17] night, I'll call on the
[30:21] master. I know he'll be there on
[30:25] time. And when sickness comes and my
[30:30] body's in
[30:32] pain, all I have to do is simply call on
[30:38] his name.
[30:41] Oh, why should I
[30:44] worry? Why should I fear? When the very
[30:49] same
[30:51] Jesus, he's always so near. He lives in
[30:57] my heart. And he hears when I
[31:02] cry. I'll call on his name till the
[31:06] storm passes by.
[31:09] Oh, why should I
[31:13] worry? Why should I fear when this very
[31:19] same
[31:20] Jesus? He is always so near. He lives in
[31:26] my heart. And he hears when I
[31:31] cry. I call on his name till the storm
[31:37] passes by.
[31:40] I'll call on his name till the storm
[31:45] passes
[31:47] [Music]
[31:53] [Applause]
[32:04] by. Amen. Did you enjoy that special
[32:06] this evening? Let's give her another
[32:08] hand. And I think Sister Char is going
[32:09] back
[32:11] home. Amen. She's been a blessing to
[32:13] have with us. You know, I like her, but
[32:16] I question her judge of character cuz
[32:17] she's friends with mom. But other than
[32:19] that, she seems like a pretty good
[32:21] pretty good lady. So, amen. You love the
[32:23] Lord this evening. It's okay to laugh in
[32:26] church, especially if it's your parents.
[32:27] So, amen. Let's sing that song if we
[32:30] could. We've been made more than
[32:31] conquerors. Key of G.
[32:35] Oh, we've been made more than
[32:40] [Music]
[32:42] coner,
[32:44] overcomers in this life.
[32:51] We've been made
[32:53] [Music]
[32:57] victorious through the blood of
[33:01] Jesus
[33:04] Christ. Oh, we've been made more than
[33:12] coners,
[33:14] overcomeers in this life.
[33:20] We've been
[33:22] made
[33:27] victorious through the blood. If you
[33:30] believe that tonight, why don't you slip
[33:32] your hand up and sing it to him
[33:34] again? Oh, we've been made more than
[33:42] coner,
[33:44] overcomeers in this life.
[33:50] We've been made
[33:56] victorious through the blood of
[34:00] Jesus Christ. Once
[34:03] again, oh, we've been made more than
[34:11] coner,
[34:13] overcomers in this life.
[34:19] We've been made
[34:26] victorious through the blood of
[34:29] Jesus
[34:34] Christ. Amen. And just before we have
[34:37] brother Ben come, we'll sing the song.
[34:39] Jesus draw me close.
[34:44] Jesus, draw me
[34:50] close,
[34:52] close, Lord, to
[34:56] [Music]
[34:57] you. Let this
[35:00] world around
[35:03] me fade away.
[35:10] [Music]
[35:13] And Jesus, draw me
[35:19] close,

[36:49] closeer, Lord, to
[36:54] you. Let this
[36:57] world around me

[39:27] done
[39:29] someday." We bow our heads together for
[39:32] a word of prayer.
[39:34] Heavenly Father, I'm so grateful to be
[39:36] in your house tonight and to think of
[39:39] all that you've done for us, the many
[39:41] blessings that you've given. Lord, what
[39:44] would we do to return to you? What
[39:46] you've given to us. We couldn't do it,
[39:48] Lord. But as David said, Lord, may we
[39:51] pay our vows in the house of the Lord,
[39:53] lift our hands and worship, Lord. May we
[39:56] take the cup of salvation and drink from
[39:59] it, Lord, and and become everything that
[40:01] you want us to be to be pleasing to you,
[40:03] Lord. It's our desire tonight. Pray that
[40:06] you'd move me out of the way and speak,
[40:08] Lord, in this service. I pray that the
[40:10] word would be clear to us, Lord. We'd
[40:12] recognize the day and the hour in which
[40:15] we live. Pray for you'd bless each one.

[40:18] but we know that you can meet that need.

[40:24] into your hands. in Jesus name. Amen.
[40:29] Amen. God bless you. Uh 2 Thessalonians
[40:32] chapter 2 and verse one. And we'll read
[40:35] down uh through verse 10 or 12 there. 2
[40:39] Thessalonians 2 and
[40:43] 1. Uh I don't think brother Allan
[40:45] mentioned it, but it's him and Jany's
[40:47] anniversary today. God bless you. Thank
[40:49] you. 14 years. I
[40:53] think he didn't do it. I did. So, but uh
[40:57] we sure appreciate them and and uh
[40:59] brother Allen uh has he prioritizes his
[41:03] family and I really appreciate that
[41:04] about brother Allen. And I believe the
[41:07] Lord will raise up some uh mighty
[41:09] warriors from that family. And I see
[41:11] Mattney. Matney's got a little
[41:12] leadership quality about him already.
[41:14] I've watched him with the young people.
[41:16] So, we sure appreciate that family and
[41:19] trust the Lord will just have his way
[41:21] with them. And we appreciate all of you.
[41:23] Good to be back with you tonight and and
[41:26] uh bring greetings from Brother Wilson
[41:27] and the folks there in Chicago and we
[41:30] had a wonderful time, wonderful service,
[41:31] but then Brother Joel was up in
[41:33] Wisconsin and he's still up there
[41:36] helping his father-in-law with some
[41:37] things and so uh we'd just be praying
[41:40] for him on the way home. 2 Thessalonians
[41:43] chapter 2 and verse one says, "Now we
[41:47] beseech you, brethren, by the coming of
[41:49] our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our
[41:51] gathering together unto him, that you be
[41:54] not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled,
[41:58] neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by
[42:00] letter, as from us, that the day of
[42:02] Christ is at hand. Let no man deceive
[42:05] you by any means, for that day shall not
[42:08] come, except there come a falling away
[42:10] first, and that man of sin be revealed,
[42:13] the son of predition, who opposeth and
[42:16] exalteth himself above all that is
[42:18] called God, or that is worshiped, so
[42:20] that he that he as God, siteth in the
[42:23] temple of God, showing himself that he
[42:26] is God, but he ain't God, right? Uh he
[42:30] he shows himself that he is God, but
[42:32] he's not God. Remember you not that when
[42:35] I was yet with you, I told you these
[42:37] things, and now you know what
[42:39] withholdeth that he might be revealed in
[42:42] his time. For the mystery of iniquity
[42:45] doth already work, only he who now letth
[42:48] will let or he who now hinderth will
[42:50] hinder until he be taken out of the way.
[42:53] He's preventing the that man of sin from
[42:56] being revealed. And then shall that
[42:58] wicked be revealed whom the Lord shall
[42:59] consume with the
[43:02] power shall consume with the spirit of
[43:05] his mouth and shall destroy with the
[43:06] brightness of his coming even him whose
[43:09] coming is after the working of Satan
[43:10] with all power and signs and lying
[43:13] wonders with all deceivleness of
[43:16] unrighteousness in them that perish
[43:18] because they receive not the love of the
[43:21] truth. Aren't you glad you have a love
[43:22] for the truth tonight that they might be
[43:25] saved? We'll just stop there for now.
[43:27] Keep your Bibles open if you will. God
[43:29] bless you. You can be seated. I want to
[43:31] speak to you tonight on the next pope.
[43:34] The next pope. Kind of an odd subject
[43:36] title, but just to kind of get your
[43:37] attention tonight uh as we're meeting
[43:40] together to worship God. The cardinals
[43:44] of the Catholic Church are locked in the
[43:46] Vatican. Uh they closed the doors today.
[43:48] I watched them close the doors and they
[43:51] uh uh they did all their ceremony and
[43:54] took their oath and they all gathered
[43:56] together to strategize and and choose
[43:59] politically who would be the next pope,
[44:02] who would be the next leader of the
[44:03] world's 1.4 billion Catholics. and and
[44:08] we see the world looking at that and
[44:10] everybody's watching it and and it's
[44:13] amazing me how much news coverage that
[44:14] that gets if if they change the leader
[44:16] of the Southern Baptist Convention,
[44:18] nobody cares and don't really make the
[44:20] news or they change the leader of the
[44:22] Lutheran Church or something like that.
[44:24] But when they change the leader of the
[44:26] Catholic Church, the whole world looks
[44:28] at it and wonders at it and and and it
[44:31] is wonderful in that sense to watch.
[44:33] Like it's amazing what they do. It's
[44:36] amazing they're able to put them in
[44:37] there. Nobody leaks anything out of
[44:40] there until the pope is is called and
[44:42] we're just we're just sitting there with
[44:44] baited breath looking for some white
[44:46] smoke to come up out of a chimney. We're
[44:48] not looking for literal smoke tonight,
[44:50] but we're looking for the glory of God
[44:52] to fill the temple of God and for the
[44:55] power of God to be with us. Don't we
[44:57] look for that every every service? We
[44:59] look for that because we're not we're
[45:01] not looking to a man. We're not looking
[45:03] for a superman or or some man to come
[45:05] and and be a a mediator between us and
[45:08] God, but we are looking for to Christ
[45:10] the the only mediator that he's here
[45:13] with us tonight as he promised he would
[45:15] be. So, we have a different attitude
[45:18] towards this maybe than most people
[45:20] would. And and I think those of us are
[45:22] in the message that we look at this and
[45:25] we're looking for something to happen
[45:28] and and we need to be informed and I
[45:31] want to make sure that we know what time
[45:33] we're living in. I don't often preach
[45:35] about current events, but I want us to
[45:37] know what's going on. And I also want us
[45:40] to uh be aware and that we don't
[45:42] overreact in in in a situation. But
[45:45] sometimes people can be disappointed. I
[45:47] remember when Hillary Clinton didn't win
[45:49] the presidency that there were people
[45:51] who were actually disappointed and and I
[45:53] wasn't one of them, but there were
[45:55] people actually disappointed that we
[45:57] didn't have a woman uh president. And
[45:59] yet, if you run that back and look at
[46:00] what Brother Brandham actually said over
[46:02] and over, he said that would be a
[46:04] church. It' be a church. And yet, there
[46:06] could be another fulfillment of that.
[46:07] There may be a woman president, but we
[46:10] know the main thing it was a church that
[46:12] that was Antichrist in its system. And
[46:15] and so we don't want to get to looking
[46:17] at the wrong thing, but but there's a
[46:19] quote where brother Brandham talks about
[46:20] the next pope. And he said, I believe
[46:23] one of these glorious days when this
[46:24] United Confederation of Church goes
[46:27] together. Now, notice what he's talking
[46:29] about. It's at that time when the United
[46:31] Confederation of Church goes together
[46:33] and the new pope is brought out of the
[46:35] United States and put over there
[46:37] according to prophecy, then they'll form
[46:40] an image like unto the beast. So I think
[46:42] a lot of us as message people were I
[46:45] know I am I'm always watching for a pope
[46:47] to come out of the United States right
[46:50] because brother Brandham said that and I
[46:52] think that's okay to do that to watch
[46:54] for that as something that we would do
[46:56] but yet it's not all that there that
[46:58] brother Brandham said about that and but
[47:01] he said that they'll put over there
[47:02] according to prophecy notice that he
[47:05] said then they'll form an image liken to
[47:06] the beast he said and I tell you the
[47:08] true church of God will be drove
[47:10] together the real true believers out of
[47:12] Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian,
[47:15] Pentecostal, Nazarene, Pilgrim,
[47:16] Holiness, whatever they'll be go
[47:18] together and cemented by the love of God
[47:21] that will make the body of the Lord
[47:22] Jesus Christ all the believers. And he
[47:24] said the agnostics and shallow-minded
[47:27] will be cast to one side. They'll go
[47:28] right on into the confederation of
[47:31] churches. Now, brother Brandham says
[47:32] that not in the seals or or in his later
[47:35] ministry, but in
[47:37] 1954, actually on December 19th, and the
[47:40] date is actually important when he said
[47:42] it because when brother Brandham said
[47:44] that, uh, he there was a 78-year-old
[47:47] pope at that time, Pope Pas I 12th, if
[47:50] I'm getting my Roman numerals right, and
[47:52] he was laying on what was thought to be
[47:54] his deathbed. All that year, Pope Pas
[47:57] laid on his deathbed. I know some of
[47:59] y'all looking at me like, "What in the
[48:01] world does this have to do with us?" But
[48:02] we're going to get there after a while,
[48:04] y'all. Just stay with me. But but he was
[48:07] laying on uh his deathbed. And in fact,
[48:10] at that time, they had called in the
[48:12] physicians. They had actually said that
[48:14] he his kidneys were failing right then.
[48:17] Uh at the time, Brother Brandham spoke
[48:19] that it was in the news that the pope
[48:21] was clearly dying. The signs of life
[48:23] were faint. His breathing, they said he
[48:26] couldn't even cloud a mirror with his
[48:27] breath. the whole world knew that he was
[48:29] dying. People were joining together and
[48:31] praying and looking up at the the
[48:33] windows looking for a sign. And and that
[48:36] pope was actually supposedly
[48:38] miraculously healed after seeing a
[48:41] vision, which was interesting because
[48:42] God was working uh in vision with
[48:45] brother Brandham at that time. And yet
[48:47] the Pope claimed to see a vision of
[48:49] Christ. And but it wasn't until he gave
[48:52] his Christmas Day address on December
[48:55] 25th that the world knew he was okay,
[48:57] which was several days after brother
[48:59] Brandham's sermon. So keep that context
[49:02] in your mind. Now when brother Brandham
[49:04] says this, there's a lot going on while
[49:05] brother Brandham was alive, especially
[49:08] during his later ministry. There's a
[49:10] whole lot going on that can that had to
[49:12] do with the pope and the Catholic
[49:13] Church. Of course, we all know about
[49:15] John Kennedy getting elected was the
[49:17] first Catholic president. You know, when
[49:19] Biden got elected as the second Catholic
[49:21] president, hardly anybody noticed. But
[49:23] when John Kennedy was elected, it was a
[49:25] big deal. Some of y'all remember that
[49:28] because he was Catholic. And if you do
[49:30] remember that, I you know, praise the
[49:32] Lord. Uh you've been you've been on this
[49:35] earth a long time. But but uh but many
[49:38] of you all do. And and uh so that pope
[49:41] was pope uh John the the pope that
[49:44] succeeded pope pas was Pope John the
[49:47] 23rd I believe and he was the one who
[49:50] called the second Vatican council. So
[49:54] during this time of brother Brandham's
[49:55] ministry this was in I think 1962 or
[49:58] something like that they called the
[50:00] second Vatican council which was unique
[50:02] in that it's what opened up the Catholic
[50:04] church. That's where they changed the
[50:06] the mass from Latin to English. So
[50:10] finally after thousands of years people
[50:11] could understand what they were saying
[50:13] in
[50:13] church and uh and and and so they
[50:16] changed the mass to English and they
[50:18] opened the church up and he and he
[50:20] called the pope called for all the
[50:22] leaders of all the denominations to come
[50:24] in to to Rome and meet with him and talk
[50:28] about unity. It's the very first time
[50:31] that the Catholics had done that. The
[50:33] World Council of Churches had been
[50:34] formed a few years before, but they but
[50:37] the the Catholics weren't actually a
[50:39] part of that, but they actually they
[50:41] actually called everybody in. Now, uh
[50:44] and then he died and the next one, Pope
[50:47] Paul the the uh 6th or the 11th, visited
[50:52] Jerusalem in December, actually the 6th,
[50:54] Pope Paul the 6th, visited Jerusalem in
[50:56] December 1964. I told you I don't know
[50:58] my Roman numerals. And and while he was
[51:01] there, you remember brother Brandham
[51:03] calls attention to it because there was
[51:04] a total eclipse of the moon. And when
[51:07] the moon went into the eclipse, Brother
[51:08] Brandham saw the pictures of that and he
[51:10] said it looks just like the church ages.
[51:13] So if you have a church age book,
[51:14] there's a picture of what brother
[51:16] Brandham drew of the church ages, the
[51:18] light in each age. There's also a
[51:20] picture of that eclipse at that time
[51:22] because it was a big deal. The first
[51:24] time a pope ever visited Jerusalem in
[51:26] 2,000 years was in December
[51:29] 1964. So the popes at that time were
[51:32] trying to uh bring an ecumenical move,
[51:34] trying to bring people together at that
[51:37] time. And we've seen a return of that in
[51:39] the last few years. It seemed like that
[51:41] got quiet for a long time. But then a
[51:44] few years ago, I believe it was Pope
[51:45] Francis that called for the
[51:47] Pentecostals. Do you remember many of us
[51:49] were saw that the Pentecostals came in
[51:51] and Kenneth Copeland and some of them
[51:54] brothers they they they said oh it's a
[51:56] wonderful thing and and how that they
[51:58] had a a priest that spoke in tongues and
[52:00] was charismatic and they all went and
[52:02] had an audience with the pope and he
[52:04] even spoke to them at that time and so
[52:07] this pope and many people thought well
[52:08] that's a return of that time. So, we've
[52:12] seen that now. It is in that context of
[52:15] all this going on that brother Brandham
[52:17] says the new pope is brought out of the
[52:19] United States and put over there
[52:21] according to prophecy and then they'll
[52:23] form an image like to the beast. Now, in
[52:27] Revelation 13, let's go to Revelation
[52:29] 13. If you uh want to turn there with me
[52:31] tonight and we'll just have a little bit
[52:32] of a Bible study. I trust you you have
[52:34] your Bibles or you can follow along on
[52:36] the screen. Revelation 13 and1. And this
[52:39] is John. of course he's seeing a symbol
[52:42] and he said I and and listen the symbol
[52:46] was what John saw what was written and
[52:49] then this day we have the revelation of
[52:51] the symbol so if anybody ever asked you
[52:53] are the seven thunders revealed
[52:55] absolutely because we know what wasn't
[52:59] known right what the symbol means and
[53:02] the the fact that we know what the
[53:04] symbols means the thunders have been
[53:06] revealed and the seals have been opened
[53:08] and I'm thankful for that tonight. So,
[53:10] we're on the other side of that. We know
[53:12] what it means. So, Revelation 13:1, I
[53:14] stood upon the sand of the sea and saw a
[53:16] beast rise up out of the sea having
[53:18] seven heads and 10 horns. And upon his
[53:21] horns, 10 crowns. Now, if you go back, I
[53:24] think I have it written in my Bible. I
[53:25] was writing some tonight and trying to
[53:27] keep my place. And uh you'll find the
[53:29] seven heads are seven mountains because
[53:32] that's where the remember the the
[53:34] in Revelation 17. She sat on seven uh
[53:37] mountains and that's Rome, right? A city
[53:40] with seven hills and and the 10 horns,
[53:43] brother Brandham said, was 10 dictators.
[53:45] They had power as kings, but they had no
[53:47] kingdom. And so and and so this is who
[53:50] the beast was. So he it wasn't just a
[53:52] single person, but he represented the
[53:54] power. And so he rose up and uh out of
[53:58] the upon and rose up out of the sea
[54:00] among the people and upon his heads the
[54:03] name of blasphemy. And the beast which I
[54:05] saw was like to a leopard. His feet were
[54:07] as the feet of a bear. His mouth is the
[54:09] mouth of a lion. The dragon gave him his
[54:11] power and his seat and great authority.
[54:14] So he got his power from the devil. And
[54:17] and this was that Roman system that
[54:19] raised up and and I saw one of his heads
[54:23] as it were wounded to death and his
[54:24] deadly wound was healed and all the
[54:27] world wandered after the beast. So you
[54:30] find that the pagan Rome fell and it
[54:33] looked like they they got they were
[54:34] sacked by the by the pagans looked like
[54:37] all uh by uh uh by by the people that
[54:41] come in the Germans come in and sacked
[54:43] Rome and they looked like it was over
[54:44] but yet they survived and pagan Rome
[54:47] became papal Rome and they ruled the
[54:49] world again during the middle ages. So
[54:52] it says his deadly wound was healed and
[54:54] all the world wondered after the beast
[54:56] and they worshiped the dragon which gave
[54:58] power unto the beast. They worshiped the
[54:59] beast, saying, "Who is like unto the
[55:01] beast? Who is able to make war with
[55:03] him?" And there was given unto him a
[55:05] mouth speaking great things and
[55:07] blasphemies. And power was given to unto
[55:09] him to continue 42 months. And he opened
[55:12] his mouth and blasphemy against God to
[55:15] blaspheme his name. And his tabernacle
[55:17] and them that dwell in heaven. Remember
[55:19] remember he had names of blasphemies on
[55:21] him. uh that was actually uh brother
[55:24] Brandham preaches a sermon on that and
[55:26] he said that's an organizational name
[55:28] instead of being known as a Christian
[55:30] they're known as whatever organization
[55:32] they belong to and so he he spoke words
[55:35] of blasphemy and it was given to him to
[55:37] make war with the saints and and
[55:39] overcome them and power was given him
[55:41] over all kindred and tongues and nations
[55:43] and all that dwell upon the earth shall
[55:45] worship him whose names are not written
[55:47] in the book of life I'm so glad there's
[55:50] the key right there all will worship him
[55:52] whose names are not written in the book
[55:55] of life. So the ones whose names are
[55:57] written will not worship him and slain
[56:00] from the foundation of the world. He
[56:02] said, "If any man have an ear, let him
[56:03] hear. He that leadth into captivity
[56:05] shall go into captivity. He that kleth
[56:08] with the sword must be killed with the
[56:09] sword." Here's the patience and the
[56:11] faith of the saints. I hope you don't
[56:12] get tired of reading tonight, but I just
[56:14] wanted to lay this in before I I wanted
[56:16] to talk to you what about what was on my
[56:19] heart. But in Revelation
[56:22] 13:1, it says, "I beheld another beast."
[56:25] Now, Brother Brandham identified what
[56:26] this beast was. We won't have a pop quiz
[56:28] tonight, but but the this beast is
[56:31] actually the US,
[56:33] the United States. So, when brother
[56:35] Brandham talks about a pope coming out
[56:37] of the US according to prophecy, I I
[56:39] believe this is what he's talking about.
[56:41] Now, he also speaks of prophecy about
[56:43] his own ministry when he saw the vision
[56:45] of the woman or church, right, that
[56:48] would rule. And so he always refers to
[56:50] that as a prophecy of the church as
[56:52] well. But here he's talking here is
[56:55] prophecy in the scripture that speaks of
[56:57] the United States. Brother Brham said
[56:59] the number the United States is 13. 13
[57:02] stars, 13 stripes, 13 original colonies.
[57:06] He said it was 13 and and it was
[57:08] identified as a woman. And Revelation
[57:10] 13:11, it said, "I beheld another beast
[57:12] coming up out of the earth. He had two
[57:14] horns like a lamb and he spake as a
[57:16] dragon. So he come in with freedom of
[57:18] worship, freedom of speech, right? He
[57:21] come in as a lamb. But when he spake, he
[57:23] spake as a dragon. I'm afraid we're
[57:25] getting to that dragon phase right about
[57:27] now in politics. And he exercises all
[57:31] the power of the first beast before him,
[57:33] and causeth the earth, and them which
[57:35] dwell therein to worship the first
[57:37] beast, whose deadly wound was healed.
[57:40] and he doeth great wonders, so that he
[57:42] maketh fire come down from heaven on the
[57:44] earth in the sight of men, and deceiveth
[57:46] them that dwell on the earth by the
[57:47] means of those miracles which had power
[57:49] to do in the sight of the beast, saying
[57:51] to them that dwell in the earth, it
[57:53] should make an image to the beast which
[57:54] had the wound by a sword and did live.
[57:56] Now remember, a beast is a power. It's a
[57:59] it's a political power or a national
[58:02] power or a satanic power. So, and he had
[58:06] power to give life to the image of the
[58:08] beast. So they made an image of the
[58:10] beast that the image of the beast or so
[58:12] it's something like the beast that looks
[58:14] like the beast but it's not the beast.
[58:17] Yeah. Right. So it's something it's an
[58:19] organization. Right. It's it's a it's a
[58:22] controlling organization just like the
[58:25] original one was. And so uh he he uh had
[58:29] power to give image to the to give life
[58:31] to the image of the beast that it should
[58:32] speak and cause that as many as would
[58:34] not worship the image of the beast
[58:36] should be killed. I think a lot of
[58:37] people think that, well, brother
[58:38] Brandham taught that the Catholics would
[58:39] control the US one day. No, it's the
[58:42] image of the beast that that brings on
[58:44] the tri uh the the the persecution
[58:46] during the tribulation period. It's the
[58:49] image of the beast that does that.
[58:50] That's not Rome. That's actually the
[58:52] World Council of Churches or the
[58:54] ecumenical move in the US. So, it'll be
[58:58] American Christians, not the Pope, who
[59:01] bring about the persecution on the
[59:03] people in the United States.
[59:05] But we're going to show you something
[59:06] here in a little while. Now, now he
[59:08] causes all both small and great, rich
[59:10] and poor, free and bond, to receive a
[59:12] mark in their right hand or in their
[59:14] foreheads. And that mark, the brand of
[59:17] taught us was already here. And it was
[59:19] to do the will uh with the right hand to
[59:21] do the will and to have the doctrine of
[59:24] that beast. And he said that no man
[59:27] might buy or sell save he that had the
[59:28] mark or the name of the beast or the
[59:30] number of his name. And he goes on to
[59:32] say the number of his name is 666 which
[59:36] is literally written on the crown of the
[59:38] pope. So the the second beast is the
[59:41] United States which forms the council of
[59:44] churches the image and forces all to
[59:47] worship it. Brother Brandham says the
[59:48] false church groups will come together
[59:50] in a world council of churches and this
[59:52] world council of churches is the image
[59:55] erected to the beast. You can find that
[59:56] the World Council of Churches is alive
[59:59] and well today and just this year
[1:00:01] they're planning for another big get
[1:00:03] together, right? You know, if we're
[1:00:06] watch these things and again, I don't
[1:00:08] want us just to get our eyes on these
[1:00:09] things because there's a lot going on
[1:00:12] right here as well. And the big thing we
[1:00:15] need to have our eyes on is how can I be
[1:00:17] pleasing to God? How can I serve him?
[1:00:19] How I I want my kids to have the Holy
[1:00:21] Ghost. My young people, that's what we
[1:00:22] need to have our eyes on. And yet this
[1:00:24] is going on all the time in the
[1:00:25] background, right? So we don't want to
[1:00:28] just get our eyes off on that, but we
[1:00:29] can see it and know what's going on. And
[1:00:32] you look at what's happening right now
[1:00:34] that it's been 1700 years. This year is
[1:00:38] the centennial of the Nyian council. And
[1:00:41] so they're bringing another council
[1:00:42] together, the world council of churches
[1:00:44] this year to bring people together for
[1:00:47] the purpose of unity because they
[1:00:49] they're honoring that Nikian council.
[1:00:51] But we know the Nian council as the
[1:00:54] place and the time where they changed
[1:00:56] the baptism, right? They changed baptism
[1:00:59] from the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:01:01] to the name of the father, son, and holy
[1:01:03] ghost. And that right there is where
[1:01:04] they they put him out of the church.
[1:01:06] They they don't even they speak names.
[1:01:08] They use names of blasphemy instead of
[1:01:11] the name of God. Right? So now they're
[1:01:14] honoring that. And so the world council
[1:01:16] of churches is planning a year of
[1:01:18] activities this year to mark the council
[1:01:22] of Nika which was they call a key moment
[1:01:25] in the history of Christian faith and
[1:01:26] for the ecumenical journey. Now the word
[1:01:28] ecumenical that's a big word but it just
[1:01:31] means uh it just means among all the
[1:01:33] churches unity among all the churches.
[1:01:36] So at the center of the WCC's activities
[1:01:40] in 2025 will be the holding of the sixth
[1:01:42] world conference on faith and order
[1:01:45] bringing together church leaders and
[1:01:46] theologians of different traditions and
[1:01:48] and ecumen ecumenist if that's how you
[1:01:51] say it. The six world order conference
[1:01:54] will approach the theme where now for
[1:01:56] visible unity from the interconnected
[1:01:59] vantage points of faith mission and
[1:02:01] unity. So now they're going to mark the
[1:02:03] anniversary of Nika with another
[1:02:07] council. I I wonder church how close we
[1:02:10] are to the end time. Remember this is
[1:02:13] what was happening and why a prophet was
[1:02:15] raising the alarm. If you go back to in
[1:02:17] the 1960s and late 1960s you'll find
[1:02:19] brother Brandham over and over again
[1:02:21] telling Pentecostals don't join that
[1:02:23] ecumenical move. And he and he looked at
[1:02:26] David Duplesus who was Mr. Pentecost at
[1:02:28] that time and he went to Rome and said,
[1:02:30] "Well, I felt the presence of God." He
[1:02:32] said, "You don't know that that's the
[1:02:33] devil, right? You're going by feelings
[1:02:36] instead of by the word." He said,
[1:02:38] "Because the word says that that's
[1:02:39] wrong, right?" He's pointing to that
[1:02:42] going on at that time. And here we are.
[1:02:44] It's going on again, right? Where are we
[1:02:47] at? And a new pope about to come on now.
[1:02:50] Now, there there was seeds being sown
[1:02:53] then. Seeds being sown. You know,
[1:02:56] whatever you sow, you got to reap,
[1:02:58] right? And so, we want to sew good
[1:03:00] seeds. We want to sew whatever we put in
[1:03:02] is what we'll get out. That's true of
[1:03:04] service. It's true of our lives. It's
[1:03:06] true of our families. It's true of
[1:03:07] everything that we do. Whatever we put
[1:03:09] in, whatever effort we put in, that's
[1:03:11] what effort we take out. Whatever uh
[1:03:14] whatever whatever seed we sew, if we sew
[1:03:16] a seed of the word, we'll reap a a
[1:03:18] results of the word. But if we sew a bad
[1:03:21] seed, then we'll reap a bad seed. And
[1:03:23] there was a denominational seed sown, an
[1:03:26] ecumenical seed sown, a a seed of of
[1:03:30] forced unity sown back then that is
[1:03:34] about to come to its fruition I believe
[1:03:37] very soon. But there was also a word
[1:03:40] seed sown at that time. And if you look
[1:03:44] at it as churches, churches are women.
[1:03:47] And brother Brandham taught that there
[1:03:48] was the modern church. He said we find
[1:03:50] today the modern church and modern
[1:03:52] church world the modern world church and
[1:03:54] also that the spiritual church are both
[1:03:57] pregnant to give birth to sons right a
[1:04:00] seed has been sown in the womb of two
[1:04:03] churches a modern church and a spiritual
[1:04:06] church and what you're seeing today is
[1:04:09] the result what we see today and the
[1:04:11] nonsense going on in the churches look
[1:04:13] at even from 20 years ago if you go back
[1:04:15] and watch a a mega church from 20 years
[1:04:18] ago and then watch them today. Look how
[1:04:20] far it's gone downhill, right? How much
[1:04:22] it's gone into apostasy. How much it's
[1:04:25] gone into just anything goes. And and
[1:04:27] even now they they they can't they just
[1:04:30] entertain the people. That's all it is.
[1:04:31] Just entertainment. But we don't want to
[1:04:33] ever be like that. We we come here to
[1:04:35] worship God. We don't come here to be
[1:04:36] entertained. We don't come here for the
[1:04:38] purpose of uh of seeing who's there. I
[1:04:41] love to see all of you in fellowship
[1:04:43] with you. But that's not why I come to
[1:04:44] church. I come to church say, "Lord, I
[1:04:46] want to be right. and I want to come to
[1:04:48] the judgment seat. I want I want to be
[1:04:50] corrected by the word and I want to
[1:04:52] worship you, Lord. What what need do you
[1:04:54] have for me that I could give to you?
[1:04:57] So, we come with a different purpose and
[1:05:00] that's but you don't hear preaching in
[1:05:02] the modern church. They give a little
[1:05:04] talk and then they have a lot of music.
[1:05:06] But why do we still have preaching?
[1:05:08] Because a seed was sown by a prophet of
[1:05:10] God. So, I believe church order is
[1:05:12] important. I believe I believe the way
[1:05:14] we have church and things are important.
[1:05:15] And I know they want to do away with
[1:05:16] preachers and preaching, but I believe
[1:05:18] it's important because a seed was sown
[1:05:20] by a prophet of God, and we're the
[1:05:22] results of that seed.
[1:05:26] Both churches were pregnant. He said,
[1:05:28] "One of them, a denominational birth, is
[1:05:30] going to give one of these days that the
[1:05:32] World Council of Churches, which will
[1:05:34] produce to the world the Antichrist
[1:05:36] through a denomination." He said,
[1:05:38] "That's exactly the truth." He said, "I
[1:05:40] may not live to see it. I believe I
[1:05:41] will, but you young people, some of you
[1:05:43] were young people back then." He said,
[1:05:45] "You young people remember you heard a
[1:05:47] minister say that." He said, "That'll
[1:05:49] finally wind up and that is the mark of
[1:05:51] the beast when she forms that world
[1:05:53] council of churches and she'll give
[1:05:55] birth to her son, the Antichrist."
[1:05:58] So, you see the significance of the
[1:06:00] United States, right? And that's the
[1:06:02] image of the beast is actually what
[1:06:05] produces the persecution that happens
[1:06:07] here in the United States,
[1:06:10] right? But it but it's causing them to
[1:06:12] worship that world system. Brother
[1:06:14] Brandon said they won't even he said he
[1:06:16] told him he said who do you think heads
[1:06:17] all that up right it's Rome behind the
[1:06:21] scenes doing
[1:06:22] it and listen we live in a time when
[1:06:25] anything could happen I I know Trump did
[1:06:28] this in jest but he he put a picture of
[1:06:31] himself as pope well that'd be a sight
[1:06:33] wouldn't it
[1:06:35] uh things would change around the
[1:06:36] Vatican you know he had a picture of
[1:06:39] himself as pope and he shared it and
[1:06:41] everybody's all mad you know upset and I
[1:06:43] thought it was pretty funny. But then I
[1:06:45] got to thinking, brother JT, and thought
[1:06:46] about that, that American pope. That's
[1:06:48] what made me think of this, that
[1:06:50] American pope. And I thought, you know
[1:06:52] what? It may not be that far off because
[1:06:55] the kind of power that that's going to
[1:06:56] wield, what if there is a pope from
[1:06:58] America, right? That that actually
[1:07:00] causes that to come in because then
[1:07:03] you'd have all of it tied up together
[1:07:05] because he'd have that kind of influence
[1:07:06] that maybe a foreign person, born person
[1:07:09] wouldn't have. soul and there's never
[1:07:12] been an American pope and it's all in
[1:07:14] the news right now whether or not
[1:07:16] that'll be the case. We may find out
[1:07:17] tomorrow, we may not. So, uh just
[1:07:20] depends on which color smoke they
[1:07:22] see. But, Brother Brandham says the
[1:07:25] other So, they're pregnant with uh with
[1:07:28] the Antichrist, right? What produces but
[1:07:31] there been another seed sown. He said,
[1:07:33] "The other is pregnant by the word of
[1:07:35] God and will bring forth the body, the
[1:07:38] finished body of Jesus Christ, which is
[1:07:41] the bride." He said, "The body of Christ
[1:07:43] isn't finished yet." I mean, he knows
[1:07:45] that a man and woman is one. So, he's
[1:07:48] saying the body of Christ is incomplete.
[1:07:50] As long as there's one soul left, one
[1:07:52] seed left, then the body of Christ is
[1:07:55] incomplete. Right? So, the body of
[1:07:57] Christ has to come to completion. So,
[1:08:00] what's happening? As long as there's one
[1:08:01] soul left, the body of Christ is
[1:08:03] incomplete. The bride, he said, will
[1:08:05] have to be the rest of that body. And
[1:08:07] the two together makes the one body
[1:08:09] again. Now, we go all all over the world
[1:08:12] trying to find that last seat. I I I may
[1:08:14] go and you all pray for me. I'm praying
[1:08:16] about going to Nepal. It's a place we've
[1:08:18] never been. And there's a few message
[1:08:20] people there, a few churches. And I was
[1:08:22] talking to brother Wilson about it and
[1:08:23] maybe getting him to go and and then
[1:08:25] maybe take a a stop in India on the way
[1:08:28] because I got folks there want me to
[1:08:29] come. And I thought if we could just if
[1:08:31] we could just reach that last seed,
[1:08:33] maybe it'll be in those Hindu countries.
[1:08:35] But as we went to Egypt and I I see the
[1:08:38] work going on in Egypt and I appreciate
[1:08:39] that because there's some people there
[1:08:41] that need to hear the message of the
[1:08:42] hour. We've heard it. Brother Brandon
[1:08:44] said, "We don't have a right to hear it
[1:08:45] twice till somebody else heard it the
[1:08:46] first time, right? But we've heard it
[1:08:49] and and yet at the same time that last
[1:08:51] seat maybe a young person in this church
[1:08:54] might be one of your kids might be one
[1:08:56] of your yours that have gone out and
[1:08:58] we're seeing people come back to the
[1:09:00] Lord. We shouldn't take that lightly
[1:09:01] because one of these days the body of
[1:09:03] Christ is going to be complete and when
[1:09:05] it is we get to go home.
[1:09:08] Amen. Hallelujah. Brother Bar said when
[1:09:10] that last one comes in we get to go
[1:09:13] home. And he even said that last one he
[1:09:14] said could be a person just hadn't
[1:09:15] reached the age of accountability yet.
[1:09:17] and we'll keep on preaching until they
[1:09:19] get old enough to be saved.
[1:09:21] And then we go home.
[1:09:24] Amen. Oh, I trust that. I trust it'll be
[1:09:27] soon.
[1:09:29] Amen. Look, I don't know. It could be a
[1:09:32] hundred years, could be tomorrow, but I
[1:09:34] believe we're living in that time. I
[1:09:37] believe that with all my heart. The
[1:09:39] bride will have to be the rest of that
[1:09:40] body. He said the two together makes one
[1:09:43] body again. Like Adam was at the
[1:09:44] beginning, man, his wife are one. Now
[1:09:46] she, the true bride, so sold out to him
[1:09:48] that she uses no mind of her own. His
[1:09:51] mind of course is his will and his will
[1:09:53] is his word. So they'll have thus sayeth
[1:09:56] the Lord or keep still. There's got to
[1:09:57] be a people that come to that kind of a
[1:09:59] maturity. What is it? We've grown up.
[1:10:01] Some of y'all remember the way it used
[1:10:03] to be. I I'm old enough to remember some
[1:10:05] things that we did that was kind of
[1:10:07] stupid. And you know, we still make
[1:10:08] mistakes and we fail. But I'll say this
[1:10:10] that as as message people, there's been
[1:10:12] a lot of maturity over the years. We've
[1:10:14] grown up a little bit. I I see brother
[1:10:16] Herald nodding at me. I know that that's
[1:10:18] been true in your lifetime. You've seen
[1:10:20] a lot of things and and we you we we're
[1:10:23] growing up. We're growing into a
[1:10:24] different place where we got more
[1:10:26] maturity and it's what is it? It's the
[1:10:28] seed that was sown back then. But if
[1:10:30] we're coming to maturity, then that
[1:10:32] antichrist system must be coming to
[1:10:34] maturity, too. Yeah. Right. So, what
[1:10:38] now? He said, "What will happen when
[1:10:39] this church, world council churches goes
[1:10:41] together? Can't you see who's going to
[1:10:43] do the leading? He said, ' Can't you
[1:10:44] Methodists and Presbyterians understand
[1:10:46] that? The rest of you, even you
[1:10:47] Pentecostals, he said, 'You say you're
[1:10:49] not going in. He said, 'You'll either go
[1:10:50] in or you'll bust up the denomination.
[1:10:52] So if you're part of a denomination,
[1:10:53] you'll end up in that, right? Because
[1:10:56] it'll just be some of them won't even
[1:10:58] feel right about it, but they'll still
[1:10:59] go just like they did at Na. He said,
[1:11:02] you'll do one or the other. It's right
[1:11:04] before you've got to do it. It's the
[1:11:05] forcing the mark of the beast. He said,
[1:11:06] that's where it is exactly
[1:11:08] denominationalism. He said, I can prove
[1:11:10] it by the Bible is the mark of the
[1:11:11] beast. She was a Revelation 17,
[1:11:14] she had prostitute daughters. He said,
[1:11:16] "And we know that that is the truth.
[1:11:17] Organized religion is contrary to the
[1:11:20] word and it's antichrist in its
[1:11:23] principles." Antichrist in its
[1:11:26] principles. And this is really
[1:11:28] important. So catch this. He said, "Not
[1:11:29] everything in there is antichrist."
[1:11:32] Brother Ben, do you believe every
[1:11:33] Baptist is Antichrist? No. Do you
[1:11:36] believe every person in the in the
[1:11:37] Methodist church is Antichrist? No. Do
[1:11:38] you believe every Catholic is
[1:11:40] Antichrist? No. Well, the Bren said
[1:11:42] there might be a saved person in there
[1:11:45] if they put their faith in Jesus and not
[1:11:46] the pope.
[1:11:48] Right now, to go in the rapture, they'll
[1:11:50] have to come to the message of the hour
[1:11:52] because otherwise, you wouldn't need the
[1:11:53] message of the hour. But there'll be
[1:11:55] many people saved,
[1:11:58] many people saved through tribulation
[1:12:00] and all kinds of other ways. But but
[1:12:02] we're the bride is called to something
[1:12:04] else. But look, but it's Antichrist in
[1:12:07] its principles. That's why we don't
[1:12:09] treat people wrong because they belong
[1:12:10] to denominations,
[1:12:12] right? We don't mistreat them. I even
[1:12:15] give pastors the respect of a pastor,
[1:12:17] another pastor. Just because he's not a
[1:12:18] message pastor don't mean he's not doing
[1:12:20] a work for the Lord. I I think of Sister
[1:12:23] Betty's grandson, I think, or
[1:12:25] great-grandson is a pastor. And I met
[1:12:27] him the other day. Just a fine young
[1:12:28] man. I said, "Well, you're in for it."
[1:12:30] He just taken a church. And I was kind
[1:12:32] of trying to prepare him, you know, cuz
[1:12:33] people are people. And and y'all have
[1:12:35] been wonderful to me. But I just let him
[1:12:36] know. You know, I get to pastor a church
[1:12:39] with at least many of you folks full of
[1:12:41] the Holy Ghost. And I can't imagine
[1:12:43] pastoring a church when almost no one
[1:12:45] has the Holy Ghost. I just don't even
[1:12:47] believe in it. That seems almost
[1:12:48] impossible. So, I feel for the man. But
[1:12:51] I'm not That's not the Antichrist. Are
[1:12:53] you with me now? The system is
[1:12:56] Antichrist. So, we don't mistreat those
[1:12:58] people. Never. Very good. Right. We
[1:13:00] don't think we're above those people cuz
[1:13:02] you could you you could go to a message
[1:13:04] church every day of your life and die
[1:13:06] and go to hell. That's right. Right. But
[1:13:08] it's matters what seeds on the inside,
[1:13:10] right? We don't mistreat nobody. The
[1:13:12] bride don't persecute nobody. I know
[1:13:14] brother said elect don't persecute
[1:13:16] elect. But if you really think about it,
[1:13:18] elect don't persecute anybody. We don't
[1:13:20] persecute at all. We are the persecuted,
[1:13:23] but we don't persecute others.
[1:13:27] Are you with me now? Not everything in
[1:13:28] there is antichrist. But in its
[1:13:30] principles, its system is antichrist. So
[1:13:32] if that system even called itself by a
[1:13:34] message name, it'd still be antichrist.
[1:13:37] Right? That's why we stand against
[1:13:38] organized religion even in the message.
[1:13:41] Yeah. Are you with me now? Because the
[1:13:43] system is antichrist because it's
[1:13:45] against the word of God. He said every
[1:13:47] organized system is that way. But we
[1:13:51] know there will be an incarnate
[1:13:53] antichrist after the bride is gone. You
[1:13:55] know the pope, they call themselves the
[1:13:57] successor of Peter,
[1:14:00] right? Actually, what they are is the
[1:14:02] successor of Judas. That's right. Do you
[1:14:04] ever think about that? They are the
[1:14:07] successor. Apostolic succession works in
[1:14:09] this way. Not that they're the successor
[1:14:11] of Peter, but they're the successor of
[1:14:13] Judas.
[1:14:14] Right? And one day that'll come
[1:14:16] incarnate like it did in Judas, but it's
[1:14:19] after the bride is gone. Right.
[1:14:23] So, I don't know who the next pope is,
[1:14:25] but if it's that one,
[1:14:27] right, before he comes incarnate, right?
[1:14:30] Before the devil comes incarnate into
[1:14:32] him, we'll be gone.
[1:14:35] Sounds like a good day for the rapture.
[1:14:39] Are you with me now? I think we we ought
[1:14:40] to make that real. It ought to be real
[1:14:42] to us. Could be right here tonight. I'm
[1:14:44] not saying it will be, but it could be.
[1:14:47] Right. Because if that if that would be
[1:14:49] him, right, that that would there would
[1:14:51] be one that's the incarnate devil.
[1:14:54] Whether it's one that's existing at the
[1:14:55] time or a new pope that's named the
[1:14:58] incarnate, he'll become the incarnate
[1:15:00] devil like Judas was. Yes. So in 2
[1:15:03] Thessalonians 2:6, it says, "Now you
[1:15:06] know what withholdeth that he might be
[1:15:08] revealed in his time." In his time. So
[1:15:11] he was revealed. He was revealed by the
[1:15:14] opening of the word, the opening of the
[1:15:15] seals. In 2 Thessalonians 2:7, for the
[1:15:18] mystery of iniquity doth already work,
[1:15:21] only he who now letth will let until he
[1:15:23] be taken out of the way. He there is the
[1:15:24] Holy Spirit, and then shall that wicked
[1:15:27] be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume
[1:15:29] with the spirit of his mouth, and shall
[1:15:31] destroy with the brightness of his
[1:15:33] coming. Oh my. So, Brother Brham said,
[1:15:36] "The church is taken up, Satan's cast
[1:15:38] out. When the church goes up, Satan
[1:15:40] comes down. Then, Satan incarnates
[1:15:42] himself in the Antichrist called the
[1:15:44] beast. And then Revelation 13, he sets
[1:15:46] the mark down. He said, "When he that
[1:15:48] ledth," he said, "Only now Christianity
[1:15:50] is left on the earth in its purity
[1:15:52] because him that ledth." Amen. It's the
[1:15:54] Holy Spirit that allows us to do what we
[1:15:56] do. I'm so thankful. It's not of our own
[1:15:58] merit. The Holy Spirit allows us to be
[1:16:00] here tonight. So he said, remember back
[1:16:03] here in Thessalonians, sit sitting upon
[1:16:05] the temple of God, calling himself God,
[1:16:07] forgiving sins on earth. He said, "And
[1:16:08] that'll go on. Iniquity shall abound and
[1:16:11] on." You think because it won't be known
[1:16:12] yet until it's time to be revealed is
[1:16:15] called. Then the church will be caught
[1:16:17] away. And when it's caught away, then he
[1:16:20] changes himself from an antichrist. When
[1:16:22] after the church is caught away, he
[1:16:24] changes himself from an antichrist. Oh
[1:16:26] my. He said the the church, the great
[1:16:27] church. And that he said now he becomes
[1:16:29] the beast.
[1:16:31] Oh my. It becomes incarnate in a man.
[1:16:34] Now you say, "Well, brother Ben, will
[1:16:35] there be some messenger here to identify
[1:16:38] him?" We won't need one because a
[1:16:41] messenger already identified who the
[1:16:43] antichrist could be and we won't be here
[1:16:47] to see the incarnate beast. Are you with
[1:16:50] me now? Amen. So he's already been
[1:16:55] identified by the opening of the seals.
[1:16:56] They asked brother Brandon the question,
[1:16:58] does the first horse rider, the first
[1:16:59] seal fulfill Thessalonians, the
[1:17:02] revelation of the man of sin? He said,
[1:17:03] yes, that's right. That does. That's
[1:17:04] easy. Some things that were easy to
[1:17:06] brother Brandon weren't so easy for the
[1:17:07] rest of us. He said that does that's the
[1:17:09] man of sin. The same man just keeps his
[1:17:11] stages riding on until he gets on a pale
[1:17:13] horse that's called death. He said
[1:17:15] Christ comes on down through
[1:17:16] justification sanctification to the
[1:17:18] white horse and that's the life. Amen.
[1:17:21] Thankful for that. Now so you say,
[1:17:23] "Well, could this one be that? Could
[1:17:25] Could the one coming whoever they name
[1:17:27] tomorrow? Could could he be from the
[1:17:29] United States?" Well, absolutely he
[1:17:31] could be. That don't mean he's the
[1:17:32] incarnate one, right? But but he could
[1:17:36] be from the United States. And if he and
[1:17:37] and he could be the incarnate one. He
[1:17:39] could be. But if he is, we'll be gone.
[1:17:43] Yes. Huh? We won't get to see that
[1:17:45] happen. We'll be gone. Listen. In 2
[1:17:49] Thessalonians verse 9 again, he said,
[1:17:50] "Even him who's coming is after the
[1:17:52] working of Satan with all power and
[1:17:53] signs and lying wonders with all
[1:17:56] deceivleness of unrighteousness in them
[1:17:58] that perish because they receive not the
[1:18:01] love of the truth." They might be saved.
[1:18:02] We could say it this way. Their hearts
[1:18:03] were not turned back. Huh? What was it?
[1:18:07] Our hearts were turned back to the faith
[1:18:08] of the
[1:18:09] fathers. But their hearts were not
[1:18:11] turned back. But we have received the
[1:18:13] love of the truth. And for this cause,
[1:18:14] God shall send them a strong
[1:18:16] delusion. They should believe a lie.
[1:18:19] They won't know they're going into it.
[1:18:21] They'll believe a lie. They'll believe
[1:18:22] that it's okay that they all might be
[1:18:24] damned who believe not the truth, but
[1:18:25] had pleasure in unrighteousness. Mother
[1:18:28] Brandon said he sold them the same lie.
[1:18:29] He sold Eve and they fell for it. The
[1:18:32] lie that God doesn't mean what he says.
[1:18:33] You don't have to live by every word.
[1:18:35] the loose ends that we're tied up don't
[1:18:37] matter. And again, he talked about that
[1:18:39] persecution. I'm going to skip on down
[1:18:41] because I'm running out of time, Robert.
[1:18:43] But that next quote talks about the
[1:18:44] persecution and Satan saying, "Well, it
[1:18:46] don't make any difference." But it does
[1:18:48] make a difference. It does make a
[1:18:50] difference. They say God's a good God,
[1:18:51] but he said there's no there's no
[1:18:53] goodness without justice. Right. He's
[1:18:56] got to keep his word. Yeah. He said,
[1:18:58] "So, we're in that hour that we're
[1:18:59] living when Satan's saying it don't make
[1:19:01] any difference, but the bride is here
[1:19:03] been called out by the message of the
[1:19:04] hour and saying we believe the full word
[1:19:06] of God."
[1:19:08] But I thank God for the rest of the
[1:19:10] story.
[1:19:11] Cuz while all this is going on, look at
[1:19:13] 2 Thessalonians 2:13. So, the first 12
[1:19:16] verses talk about what's going to happen
[1:19:19] and the Antichrist system that was
[1:19:21] already working in that early church and
[1:19:23] would come to fruition in the person of
[1:19:25] the man of sin.
[1:19:27] But Paul says in 2 Thessalonians 2:13,
[1:19:32] "But we are bound to give thanks always
[1:19:37] to God for you." Oh, I believe he's
[1:19:40] writing not only to those in that
[1:19:41] Thessalonian church, but also to us. We
[1:19:44] are bound to give thanks always to God
[1:19:47] for you, brethren. Beloved of the Lord,
[1:19:49] you say, "Brother Ben, do I have to
[1:19:51] worry about what's going on?" You young
[1:19:52] people, you do I need to worry, Brother
[1:19:54] Ben, about what's going on? No, because
[1:19:56] you've already been called away from
[1:19:58] that. You've heard a message. You've
[1:19:59] heard the stream of an eagle. You belong
[1:20:01] in a different place than that. You
[1:20:04] don't have to worry about that. We are
[1:20:06] bound to give thanks for you, brethren,
[1:20:08] beloved of the Lord, because God hath
[1:20:10] from the beginning. Someone say it with
[1:20:12] me. From the beginning chosen you to
[1:20:17] salvation. What could I do to take you
[1:20:20] out of that? Right? Hey, we don't ever
[1:20:22] want to let a man, any pastor, any
[1:20:23] person gain so much power over our lives
[1:20:26] that we feel like what he says can take
[1:20:28] us out of being a Christian. No, we were
[1:20:30] chosen from the beginning to salvation.
[1:20:34] If you have salvation, it's because you
[1:20:36] were chosen to salvation from the
[1:20:38] beginning through sanctification of the
[1:20:40] spirit and belief of the truth where to
[1:20:43] he called you by our gospel to the
[1:20:45] obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus
[1:20:47] Christ. Oh my, what is it? You were
[1:20:50] called. you were you were elect to to
[1:20:52] overcome that deception in this day.
[1:20:55] Brother said, "Look, God in his body
[1:20:57] Christ and Christ in his body the
[1:20:59] bride." He said, "Oh my, God made
[1:21:01] manifest in Christ. Christ made manifest
[1:21:04] in the bride. And as God took from the
[1:21:06] body of Adam, the woman, and she fell,
[1:21:08] then God has took from the body of
[1:21:10] Christ his flesh, his body, which is his
[1:21:12] word, and is bringing a bride out that
[1:21:15] won't fall. She won't fall by
[1:21:17] denomination or creed." That gives me
[1:21:19] great comfort today. Every time I preach
[1:21:21] it, I think, well, this one might fall
[1:21:23] or that one might fall or God forbid
[1:21:25] that I might fall. But he said, we won't
[1:21:27] fall. There will be a bride that won't
[1:21:29] fall. If I'm part of that bride, I'm
[1:21:31] going to make it. I might make mistakes.
[1:21:33] I might even fall in the eyes of the
[1:21:34] people, but I can't fall away from grace
[1:21:37] because he chose me before the
[1:21:38] foundation of the world. I can't be
[1:21:40] nothing different than I am. How many
[1:21:42] can say amen with me tonight? I can't be
[1:21:44] nothing but a message believer. That's
[1:21:46] what God called me to be. I'm not there
[1:21:48] because of brother Brandham. I'm not
[1:21:50] there because of somebody else, some
[1:21:51] other preacher. I'm there because God
[1:21:53] spoke in our day and I heard it.
[1:21:55] Something inside me heard it.
[1:21:58] Hallelujah. Something more real than a
[1:22:00] pope. Something more real. While the
[1:22:01] world's got his focus on that, I got my
[1:22:04] focus on a predestinated seed that God
[1:22:06] that God called before the foundation of
[1:22:08] the earth.
[1:22:10] Amen. They're looking to see who's the
[1:22:12] next pope. I want to see who the next
[1:22:14] member of the bride will be. I want to
[1:22:16] watch their lives blossom. Amen. their
[1:22:19] testimony blossom and
[1:22:21] bloom.
[1:22:22] Amen.
[1:22:24] Hallelujah. He said she won't fall by
[1:22:27] denomination creed, no service. She's
[1:22:29] coming back with the pure unadulterated
[1:22:31] word of God being manifested. He said,
[1:22:33] "I hope every man that hears this tape,
[1:22:34] and every woman will understand that she
[1:22:37] is the second Eve, but she is not
[1:22:38] breaking and spoiling her skirts of
[1:22:40] purity and holiness to her husband,
[1:22:42] she'll stay with his word regardless of
[1:22:44] what anybody says. You can have all the
[1:22:46] ecumenical moves you want to, all the
[1:22:49] affiliations. So what does what does
[1:22:51] Paul go on to say in 2 Thessalonians
[1:22:53] 2:15? Look how it ties to the message of
[1:22:56] the hour. Paul goes on to say,
[1:22:58] "Therefore, brethren, therefore,
[1:23:00] brethren, because of these things,
[1:23:01] brethren, stand fast." Someone said, "If
[1:23:03] you see therefore in the scripture, look
[1:23:05] and see what it's there for."
[1:23:07] Therefore, brethren, stand fast and hold
[1:23:09] the traditions which you have been
[1:23:12] taught, whether by word or our epistle.
[1:23:16] Hallelujah. You want to know how to
[1:23:18] overcome? Hold fast to the word that
[1:23:20] you've been taught. Now, our Lord Jesus
[1:23:23] Christ himself, he said, "And God, even
[1:23:25] our father, which hath loved us, and has
[1:23:27] given us everlasting consolation and
[1:23:29] good hope through grace, comfort your
[1:23:31] hearts and establish you in every good
[1:23:33] work, word, and work." What did he say
[1:23:35] when he started out the chapter? He
[1:23:36] said, "Don't be afraid. Don't be shaken
[1:23:38] in spirit. Don't be shaken cuz somebody
[1:23:40] told you we said something." He said,
[1:23:42] "Remember a great falling away's got to
[1:23:44] come first." He said, "But you can't be
[1:23:46] deceived cuz you were chosen from the
[1:23:48] beginning."
[1:23:50] Hallelujah. How will we stand in such an
[1:23:52] hour of deception when the whole world
[1:23:54] wonders after the beast predestination?
[1:23:57] Amen. Amen. Ephesians
[1:24:00] 1 vers
[1:24:02] 3-6, he said, "Blessed be the God and
[1:24:04] Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has
[1:24:06] blessed us with all spiritual blessings
[1:24:07] in the heavenly places in Christ
[1:24:09] according as he has chosen us in him
[1:24:11] before the foundation of the world that
[1:24:13] we should be holy without blame
[1:24:14] beforeing him him in love, having
[1:24:17] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[1:24:20] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[1:24:22] according to the good pleasure of his
[1:24:24] will, to the praise of the glory of his
[1:24:26] grace, wherein he made us accepted in
[1:24:28] the beloved. We've already come through
[1:24:30] the stage of some stages of adoption,
[1:24:32] but there's a final stage of adoption,
[1:24:34] which is the change of the body, and
[1:24:36] we've been predestined to that change.
[1:24:39] So, if you're the bride, you can't miss
[1:24:41] the rapture.
[1:24:43] Are you with me now? And you say, "Well,
[1:24:46] if I can't miss, I'll just do whatever I
[1:24:47] want to." But if you're the bride,
[1:24:49] you'll love to do whatever he wants you
[1:24:51] to do to do what's pleasing to the Lord.
[1:24:55] Or you might fail. You might fall, but
[1:24:56] you get back right back up and say,
[1:24:58] "Lord, help me. I can't I can't give up.
[1:25:01] There's something in me won't let me
[1:25:02] give up. Won't let me do what other what
[1:25:05] everybody else does. I just can't do it.
[1:25:07] I got to come back to the fountain. I
[1:25:09] got to come back to the Lord." Amen.
[1:25:13] Hallelujah. Predestined. I'm closing his
[1:25:16] musicians come. He said predestined.
[1:25:18] There's the mystery. He before Christ or
[1:25:20] anything else was ever on earth. You see
[1:25:21] his great mystery that he chose the
[1:25:24] bride. The cardinals are choosing a
[1:25:26] pope, but he chose the bride. They're by
[1:25:30] by men's ideas and opinions are getting
[1:25:33] together and choosing a man to be the
[1:25:36] next pope. But God chose you before the
[1:25:39] foundation of the world. Amen. There was
[1:25:43] never any black smoke. It wasn't an
[1:25:44] election that failed, but it was an
[1:25:46] election. Amen. That was true from the
[1:25:49] beginning. He never chose you and then
[1:25:51] unch you. You were never a second
[1:25:53] choice. But you were his first choice.
[1:25:55] He chose the bride knowing Eve would
[1:25:57] fall from disbelieving the word, knowing
[1:25:59] she would fall. But he would choose a
[1:26:01] bride that would not fall, that would
[1:26:03] hold to that word regardless of what all
[1:26:04] the rest of the world had to say about
[1:26:06] it. Lord, let me be one of those. They
[1:26:09] would hold to that word. They are
[1:26:10] predestinated to stand there. The
[1:26:13] adoption of children. What did Paul say?
[1:26:15] Stand there. Stand in what you've heard.
[1:26:17] Stand in the word of God. He said, you
[1:26:19] are predestinated to stand there. The
[1:26:21] adoption of children by Jesus Christ
[1:26:23] predestinated to the church to that
[1:26:26] great glorious stand. Would you stand
[1:26:28] with me tonight? Not only stand to your
[1:26:31] feet, but stand, Lord. Let's stand for
[1:26:33] this message. Let's stand for the truth.
[1:26:35] Let's stand for the word of God. Let's
[1:26:37] stand for what's right. Let's stand for
[1:26:39] holiness in a world that's forgotten
[1:26:40] about. Let's stand for the truth. Stand
[1:26:43] for God. He stood for us. He
[1:26:46] predestinated us to that great glorious
[1:26:49] stand.
[1:26:50] the next
[1:26:51] pope may be maybe you never know or he
[1:26:56] may not but before the Holy Spirit is
[1:26:58] taken away from the earth I'm so
[1:27:00] grateful for that while he's while he's
[1:27:03] still here he's still calling still
[1:27:05] wooing he's still brooding I say come to
[1:27:08] him right now I know it's a Wednesday
[1:27:11] night but if you've not come to him now
[1:27:12] is the time to come to him accept his
[1:27:15] call his
[1:27:17] call maybe those that are watching
[1:27:19] tonight at home and unable people to
[1:27:20] come because of work or something else,
[1:27:22] but they're they're watching. Why don't
[1:27:24] you why don't you come to him right
[1:27:26] where you're at? Why don't you draw
[1:27:27] closer? I think every one of us it ought
[1:27:29] to it would it would behoove us to come
[1:27:31] closer to him and say, "Lord, I want to
[1:27:33] be a part of that bride. I want to stand
[1:27:35] in that evil day. Having done all, I
[1:27:37] want to stand." Amen. There will be a
[1:27:40] people who'll be taken from the earth.
[1:27:42] There will be a bride who will not fall.
[1:27:46] We are that bride. If the bride is
[1:27:49] anywhere, it's in the message because
[1:27:51] the message is what calls the bride. It
[1:27:53] may not be everybody calls themselves
[1:27:55] message or some nonsense that calls
[1:27:58] themselves message. But Jesus had to do
[1:28:02] this. But there's some people who
[1:28:04] despite all their failures like Peter,
[1:28:06] but there's something in him. He
[1:28:07] couldn't give up. He couldn't quit. I
[1:28:09] was predestined to that stand that he
[1:28:11] took on the day of Pentecost. We have
[1:28:13] been predestined to the stand that we're
[1:28:15] taking now. Amen. And I pray that
[1:28:17] comforts your hearts today. Hallelujah.
[1:28:20] Heavenly Father, Lord, I pray you'd help
[1:28:22] us to draw close to your throne. I thank
[1:28:25] you for your word, Lord. Thank you for
[1:28:27] your mercy, your goodness on us. Thank
[1:28:30] you for being faithful, Lord, all of our
[1:28:32] lives, for being good to us, oh God, for
[1:28:34] calling us, for
[1:28:36] predestinating us to this stand that
[1:28:38] we've taken. I pray God, Lord, we can't
[1:28:41] do anything else. artist as Martin
[1:28:44] Luther stood there one day. He said, "I
[1:28:45] can't do anything else but take my
[1:28:47] stand." Oh God, may we do that today.
[1:28:50] Each and every one of us, men and women,
[1:28:52] boys and girls, may we take that stand
[1:28:54] for the word in our lives. Pray you'd
[1:28:57] grant it, Lord. It does matter. Pray
[1:28:59] you'd help us to know it. Pray you'd
[1:29:00] grant it now in Jesus name.
[1:29:04] Amen.
[1:29:05] Hallelujah.
[1:29:07] Faithful. Lord, you glad he's been
[1:29:10] faithful. Amen. Why don't we worship him
[1:29:13] now? If you need prayer, the altar's
[1:29:15] open. I think every service we ought to
[1:29:18] look at it. What if this is the last
[1:29:20] one? We might be going
[1:29:23] home. We might as well worship him while
[1:29:25] we're
[1:29:26] here.
[1:29:28] Hallelujah. Of the
[1:29:30] goodness of God. Has he been good to
[1:29:33] you? Why don't you just raise your hands
[1:29:35] to him and sing? All my life you been
[1:29:41] faithful. Oh, thank you, Lord. Thank
[1:29:44] you. And all my life you have been so so
[1:29:51] good.
[1:29:54] With every breath that I am
[1:29:59] able, I will
[1:30:02] sing of the
[1:30:04] goodness of
[1:30:07] God. I love you,
[1:30:13] Lord, for your mercy never fails me.
[1:30:20] All my
[1:30:21] days I've been held in your
[1:30:27] hands. From the moment that I wake
[1:30:31] up until I lay my
[1:30:36] head, I will
[1:30:38] sing of the
[1:30:41] goodness of God.
[1:30:43] [Music]
[1:30:48] And all my life you have been
[1:30:55] faithful. And all my life you have been
[1:30:59] so so
[1:31:03] good. With every breath that I am
[1:31:10] able, I will
[1:31:13] sing of the
[1:31:15] goodness of God.
[1:31:18] Oh, thank you, Lord. I love your voice.
[1:31:21] Oh, you love his voice tonight. Oh, we
[1:31:24] love the word with all of our hearts. Me
[1:31:26] through the fire. Oh, thank you,
[1:31:29] Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:31:32] Oh, you are close. Hallelujah. Thank
[1:31:36] you,
[1:31:38] Lord. I've known you as a
[1:31:42] father. I've known you as a friend.
[1:31:47] And I have
[1:31:49] live in the
[1:31:51] goodness of
[1:31:57] God. And all my life you have been
[1:32:05] faithful. And all my life you have been
[1:32:10] so so
[1:32:14] good. With every breath that I am
[1:32:20] able, I will
[1:32:23] sing of the goodness.
[1:32:26] [Music]

[1:32:34] you
[1:32:39] Jesus for the grace that you
[1:32:44] have given us.

[1:33:33] Thank
[1:33:35] you, oh Lord.
[1:33:39] Thank
[1:33:41] you,
[1:33:46] Jesus, for the grace that you
[1:33:51] have, even us. Thank you, Lord. Oh, I
[1:33:57] can't repay from my heart. I'd like to
[1:34:02] say that
[1:34:03] I Oh, I thank you. You could just lift
[1:34:08] both your hands to him and sing it with
[1:34:09] all your heart. I want to say
[1:34:12] thank Oh, I thank you, Lord. Thank you,
[1:34:17] Jesus.
[1:34:19] Hallelujah. Oh, for the grace that you
[1:34:24] have given us. Thank you, Lord. Although
[1:34:30] I can't repay from my heart, I'd like to
[1:34:35] say that I
[1:34:38] Oh, I I thank you. As brother Allen,
[1:34:41] come sing it again. Oh, I want to say
[1:34:46] thank you. Thank you,
[1:34:51] Jesus. Oh, yes, Lord.
[1:34:54] Oh, for the grace that you
[1:34:58] have given
[1:35:01] us. And though I can't repay from my
[1:35:07] heart, I would like to

[1:35:12] I thank once again with all our hearts.
[1:35:17] I want to say
[1:35:19] thank
[1:35:22] you
[1:35:27] Jesus for the grace that you
[1:35:31] have given us.
[1:35:36] And though I can't
[1:35:38] repay from my heart, I would like to say
[1:35:43] that I, you know, we've all got
[1:35:46] something to be thankful for. Let's
[1:35:48] thank him again.

[1:35:53] thank
[1:35:55] you
[1:36:00] Jesus for the grace that you
[1:36:04] have given us.
[1:36:09] And though I can't repay from my heart,
[1:36:14] I would like to
[1:36:16] say that
[1:36:19] I thank
[1:36:22] you. Can we give the Lord a hand clap of
[1:36:25] [Music]
[1:36:28] praise? You love the Lord this evening.
[1:36:31] Amen. Let's sing that song just before
[1:36:33] we go. God will make a way. Key of G.
[1:36:35] Amen. We'll sing this and then you're
[1:36:37] free to go in the name of the Lord.
[1:36:41] And oh God will
[1:36:44] make a
[1:36:47] way when there seems to be no
[1:36:55] way. He works in
[1:36:58] ways we cannot see.
[1:37:04] He will
[1:37:06] make a way for
[1:37:10] me. He will be my
[1:37:16] guide. Hold me closely
[1:37:20] to his
[1:37:24] side with love and strength.
[1:37:28] For each new
[1:37:31] day, he will

[1:37:38] way. He will make a name and you're free
[1:37:42] to go in the name of the Lord. I know
[1:37:46] that God will
[1:37:48] make a
[1:37:51] way when there seems to be no way.
[1:38:00] He works in
[1:38:02] ways we cannot
[1:38:06] see. He will
[1:38:09] make a way for
[1:38:13] me. He will be my
[1:38:19] guide. Hold me closely
[1:38:23] to his side.
[1:38:28] with love and
[1:38:31] strength for each new
[1:38:34] day. He will
[1:38:37] make the way
