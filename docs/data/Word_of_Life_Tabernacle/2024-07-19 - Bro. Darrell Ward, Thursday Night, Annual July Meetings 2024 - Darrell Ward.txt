young boy come out of the army with a bunch of bad habits in my life and I'd been out the night before exercising some of those habits but it was on a Sunday afternoon December the 21st 1981 there an old building in a place called Jonesburg Tennessee and all at once oh thank you Lord I felt his presence coming into the room and I I knew it was him because I felt him when I was a boy I was in a tent meeting as a young boy and I had fell and broke my collar bone and they took me inside the ttin put me up on the platform and the preacher prayed for me and God instantly healed me of a broken collar bone so I knew what the presence of the Lord felt like and there in that building I knelled at that door this old Rich was saved by The Amazing Grace of almighty God oh never forget what the Lord has done for you he's wonderful he loves us oh my the prophet of God said he wants to heal you a thousand times more than you want to be healed that's how much he cares for you what a privilege it is to serve the Living God tonight amen we greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we count it such an honor to be here and we appreciate brother being inviting us to come and realizing that there's great man of God that's ministering the word today and and and and yet he allowed us to come and we we appreciate that and we just trust something will be said that would help you and encourage you because truly that's why we come I bring greetings to you from my pastor brother Donnie Reagan and I was coming down the road yesterday and heading this way and I just got to remember and first time I ever came into this area I was I was just in my 20s just a kid my how fast time has yeah has spun around but I may not preach it as fast as I used to but I still believe it with all my heart this message will change your body thank you amen if you have your Bibles turn with us to the book of Ephesians want to read from chapter 3 uh one verse there verse 11 appreciate all the ministering Brothers being with us this evening as sure love and appreciate your Ministries I pray God to just bless you richly appreciate each one being here and you know I believe before this meeting's over that there wouldn't be a feeble one Among Us that's right amen that's that's the god that we serve amen matter of fact if you're a Believer you already to take the word impossible out of your dictionary because the Bible says all things are possible to them that believe we should never say impossible well Glory Ephesians 3:11 do you love him tonight God bless you the Bible says this according to the Eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our lord let us bow our heads you say brother darl that's not much scripture I think it's enough oh thank you sir I want to speak to you tonight on God's undefeatable Eternal purpose thank you Lord Heavenly Father we love you Lord oh Jesus Oh yes thank you for that day in December when you changed my life and Lord I pray tonight that we could just get oursel out of the way that you could take this simple thought Lord because it's really just the only kind I can bring but may you just take it and break it to the hearts of your children that they may understand God oh gr Lord not only who you are but we may understand who we are for We Believe Lord the seals have come open to reveal to us our true identity as Sons and Daughters of God and our purpose for being upon the Earth and Lord those that's here tonight maybe not feeling well I pray father May that same anointing that raised my Lord from the grave May that same anointing that raised Jessica up and gave her back to me May that same anointing move upon every heart tonight and upon every home that when we leave the building may we say did not our hearts burned within us as you walked and talked with us along the way bless my Minister and brothers Lord I ask God you give them a special anointing use them in a mighty way Lord and may we labor for the hours of B us God oh gr until then Lord may we be faithful for we ask these things in Jesus name and the bride says amen amen God bless you you may be seated you know Eternal means without a beginning and without an end which has always been which has always been and which will always be which has always been which is always be I want to start with this quote right here I got a few quotes tonight if you don't mind me reading them but the prophet of God says he said I thought tonight that I would talk on faith for a little while just to build you up on Christian faith and I found out that one of the greatest hindrances that the church has got today is that you're scared to death and what are you scared about that's what I'm wondering if you'll just only realize who you are you don't know who you are you don't know who that is sitting next to you you say oh yeah that's my neighbor I know him all right but he's a Son of God see that's right adopted by Jesus Christ into the family and that's a daughter of God sitting next to you and who are you if you're a Christian a Believer you're a son and a daughter of God then if we're Sons and Daughters of God what are we scared about huh what are we scared about amen there's no need of being scared as long as the devil can keep you scared that's all he wants to do he's got you right then then friends it's no mystery to us that we're living in a phobic age Islamic phobia lettuce phobia fireworks phobia Everybody's scared to death of everything men's hearts are failing for fear that that's there but in this hour the prophet of God said that may be for them but it don't have to be for you we've got nothing to be scared about our Daddy has got it all in control right but as long as he can keep you scared that's all he wants to do he's got you right then so then while was thinking along those lines of amnesia amnesia is the loss of a memory of not knowing who you are so Amnesia feeds fear Amnesia that's why you see people in nursing home with Alzheimer's they de sometimes they get so violent is because they don't understand what's happening to them right come on my daddy had Alzheimer's we lost him a few year ago and Alzheimer's is a tragic thing because you lose them twice right you lose them when they get it then you lose it when they cross and so the last few time of my daddy's life we had to put him into a special unit that would equi to take care of him and they was having a a party and so I had come in from a meeting and I I went over to be with my daddy and I rode him into a room yeah yeah and so the they were passing out gifts and they said James Elbert [Applause] Ward but my daddy never moved cuz he didn't know who he was that's right and I said Daddy you better raise up here buddy they they got a gift for you it's got your name on it it belongs to you you better get up and look at it but he never moved yeah cuz he didn't know who he was and I said over here ma'am and I took the gift and opened it for my daddy you said why do you say all that why was you telling us that yeah because I want you to understand come on that God's going to speak to you service after service this week amen but no matter how great the word is no matter how rich the anointing is no matter how tremendous the Revelation would be if you don't believe it's for you it will do you no good Amnesia produces fear but knowing who you are will produce perfect faith for the prophet of God said Jesus had perfect Faith because he knew who he was in the word so when you know what the word word is saying about you you can have the confidence that God's word will not fail well brother darl I don't feel like it he never said did you feel it but he did say did you believe it and if you start believing it you might actually feel [Applause] it now brother bam told several times a story an illustration about a box of rattlesnakes right he said if someone come up this morning to your door an Express agent today we'd say FedEx or prime you know or Amazon but if someone come up to your door and they had a box of rattlesnakes and it had your name on it yeah and they said here you are they're yours come on you see the rattlesnakes you hear the rattlesnakes you know they're there just like your symptoms our symptoms we know they're there if you receive them rattlesnakes they're yours but you don't have to take them you can say I don't want them and the angel will say but your name is on the package but you say I don't want them I won't have them and he will do everything he can to make you take them now in one sense they're yours but in another sense they're not you might see all the symptoms the devil said here's your cancer here's your heart trouble here's your condition but it's not yours till you sign for [Music] it if you refuse to sign for them he has to take them back to the express agent it has to send them back to the one that sent [Applause] them I say it's time we give the devil some cancer I say it's time we give the devil some arthritis I say it's time to give the devil some depression come on somebody we need to send it back to [Applause] him he can stand and argue as much as he wants to but until you take them and sign them they belong to the express company don't sign for nothing the devil brings say I refuse to have it that's right take it back have nothing to do with it if you won't testify you've got it when you testify you still have your sickness the devil will keep it with [Applause] you now people will go through a prayer line and go right outside and testify of their sickness and as long as you do that the devil will keep it with you but I think it's time we say What God Says I Am the Lord thy God who Health all thy diseases amen hallelujah amen refuse to testify of it I won't have it if you receive them they're yours but you don't have to take them I don't want them your names on them I don't want them but if you sign for them and receive them they're yours if you sign for them and receive them they're yours so I was thinking about that yeah if that was true for a box of rattlesnakes come on would not that be also true if an agent an ambassador a minister from heaven was to come and offers you a box and in this box is healing in this box is joy in this box is peace in this box is Revival in this box is Deliverance in this box is redemption in this box is revelation it's yours it's got your name on it it's for you yes sir you don't have to accept it you don't have to receive it and if you don't it goes back to the one that sent it but if you will accept it and believe it and confess it that's the ABCs of your healing that's the ABCs of your deliverance accept it believe it confess it if you will accept the word receive the word and confess what the word is saying you can have everything that's in the Box [Applause] it's a personal possession it's a personal revelation amen you see that's what God God wants to be personal with every one of us he don't want to set up on a cloud he don't even want to just walk with you he wants to walk in you it's what the Bible says he said brother B I wished I had Joy he said you can have it it's yours you're just letting Satan rob you from the that Christ died for I'm an air to it it's all mine everything he died for belongs to you where his children were Heirs of it everything he died for then I say receive the gifts of God that he sends among you this weekend this week take the words that are spoken into your heart and allow them to manifest in your life if you'll do that you'll see a Revival amen amen but if you just Let It Go On by all right amen well brother I'm just going to do the same old thing I did last time we had a meeting how did that work out for [Applause] you amen you know no matter how little you are yeah how big you are yeah how important you are yeah or how unimportant you are you are here to serve a purpose just as my finger is here for a purpose and my nail on my finger is here for a purpose my eye and every part of my body is to serve a purpose now my finger may not be as important as my eye but you lose a finger and see how your thumb will struggle that's right amen so whether we're the biggest one or the littlest one if we're a part of the body we're needed whether you're young or old male or female if you're a part of the body of Christ you are needed yes sir amen my fingernail wouldn't just put on my finger just to see what it would look like it was put there for a purpose it was put there to serve a purpose it was God's divine plan to put a fingernail on my finger and if we're here put here for a purpose yeah then there is nothing that can destroy nothing can destroy us until God's purpose is [Applause] fulfilled are you hearing me tonight we're not a weak feeble bunch of people we are the Overcomers of Leonia nothing can harm us until the purpose that God has put us here has been made manifest no matter how much trouble we have how much heartache we have or sorrow that we go through all these are for a reason but nothing you face in life will defeat the purpose that God has purposed for your life right all right oh yeah are you hearing me that tonight well brother I'm going through a hard time I'm not belittling that but I'm here to tell you no matter how hard the trial is it will not defeat the purpose am the undefeatable Eternal purpose of God will not be defeated it will not be defeated go with me a minute in your mind let's just take a little trip before there was an angel a star a planet there was no air there was no lights come on there was no world there was no nothing else except God and he wasn't even really God because God is an object of worship so it's just a self-existing one that we call God Ella eloh which means the self-existing one nothing there was nothing else existed but him right and the self-existing one that we call God but before there was anything to worship him he was a self existing one and the self-existing being had a desire he had a purpose something that he wanted to achieve and he purposed within himself that he would do this thing and he spoke let there be light and there was light because he purposed it and when he spoke oh God the darkness could not stop the light from coming forth thank you Lord how mysterious it seems God always keeps his word God will not make a promise that he can't keep come on God being infinite he knows all things he knows the future from the beginning he don't make a promise unless he knows what's going to happen and he always keeps his promise God Don't Make A Promise unless he knows he's going to keep it yes sir God purposed within himself to prove his word to be true am oh thank you Lord now think about this I do not believe God heals people just to show his power that's right but I believe he he heals people to show that he fulfills his word and keeps his promise matter of fact the prophet of God said Jesus never healed the sick to show his power he healed the sick to fulfill the scripture when he came on the earth the first time he said Hallelujah that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets what did he come to do to fulfill the prophet's [Applause] prophecies write this on your refrigerator all God's word must be fulfilled Hallelujah yes sir Lord amen I'm just laying a little bit of Step here you see God purpose can never be defeated there's nothing that can defeat it how happy we ought to be are you happy sure to let your face know we are to be the happiest people on Earth because we understand this this is not a mystery to [Applause] us how happy we are to be resting upon the beautiful revelation of the word of the Living God there's neither things present there's neither things that can come there's no sickness there's no sorrow there's no death there's no perils there's nothing that can separate us from the purpose of the Living God what God has imagined in his mind what God has purposed in his heart to bring the past there is no demon there is no power there is nothing that can ever separate God's Great Immortal eternal plan hey devil in case you didn't know you lose it must be as God have said because what did God say my word will not return unto me void but it will accomplish that which it was sent to do so if God said it he'll do it God said let virgin conceive and bring forth a child and it was as God said God said behold I send you Elijah before the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and it was as God said God said there'll be a bride she will be bone of my bone Flesh of My Flesh Spirit of my spirit she is him and it is as God have said h well you reckon when the bride's going to come she's been here in 1964 five stars lined up and the prophet said it was the announcement of the Bride of the Earth in infancy that what has happened since 64 somebody has grown up somebody has matured somebody knows what he wants done with the word somebody can make that word live thank you Lord do you think our heavenly father will defeated in his purpose even though Satan has done what he's done it's an impossibility God will not be defeated and he's given us perfect Assurance thank you Lord that we don't have to be scared about nothing I seen a sign the other day I thought it was so good said this nation don't need a donkey or an elephant that's right it needs to go back to the lamb what the god what the father has purposed in your life can never be defeated what are you saying brother Daryl I'm telling you look in the back of the book you win I think of David David was anointed think about this now David was anointed by the great prophet Samuel to be king so God sent David a prophet with a message all right come on that told David who he was right and what his future would be he sent a prophet with a message with an anointing to tell David right who he was and what his future will be now I looked at up Scholars said that David was probably between the ages of 10 and 15 when the God sent the prophet to his house what does that tell you young people you don't have to wait till you're old you can find God while you're young sir Hallelujah David just a boy and he called out into battle and he stands before Goliath who is 9' n in tall and Saul tells David you're just a youth come on think about it King Saul Who David no doubt looked up to and his own King was of discouraging from the battle sometimes our greatest discouragement comes from those that are around us but if you know who you are and you know what you're called to do don't listen to the critics amen he said you're just a boy yeah come on you just need to calm down a little bit all right but when he seen that he wasn't going to deter David he said here take my helmet take my shield take my sword and David thought if they're so good why don't you use them come on that's right but David said I've not tried any of that but the one who anointed me the one who called me he told me what to [Applause] do so says David you're just a youth and Goliath he's been a warrior since his youth not only is he a warrior he's a champion he's got trophies but David come on oh God give us some davidl that giant stood before David Goliath's problem was he didn't see the God who stood behind David if Goliath had saw the god that stood behind him he would have been on his knees come on for God done said to David you will reign as a king then how can he die by the hand of a giant as a boy and reign as a king how so what did David do what every one of us must do he took what God Said over what he felt right amen so David took God at his word and as far as the word was concerned Goliath Was Defeated Hallelujah before the battle ever [Applause] started glory to God oh bless the Lord because God's purpose for David's life could not be defeated that's right by a giant that's right and God's purpose for your life cannot be defeated by that giant of fear and oppression come on that giant that tells you God don't love you don't care for you you're not part of it you need to tell that giant who your God is you need to tell that giant God sent a prophet to me with a message and that message told me not only who I am but what my future is the message has told us what our future is we're not going down we're going up we're going up we're going up Hallelujah yes sir sh Jack a Bendigo heated up that furn seven times hter than it ever been heated before come on my good and they said we don't know whether God will delivers but there's one thing we do know he is able to do it our God is able to deliver us but nonetheless we will not bow Hallelujah we will not bow to the image you see God had someone who would serve you and his purpose would not be defeated the fire cannot defeat the purpose of God's plan hope prop said I love to say this this morning all the hydrogen bombs in the world can never defeat the resurrection of the church all the explaining way all the mathematics and so forth all the intellectual world has disguised to purpose to do something to destroy the faith of God's children all this trash on the internet believe the sign don't believe the all the mathematics all they're adding up what is it nothing but tactics of the devil to D down your faith but remember God sent you a prophet with a message but all their tactics all their mathematics all their intelligence it will never it will never do it faith will live on forever faith will live on forever hallelujah thank Moses he was taught in all the wisdom of Egypt but he knew God had a purpose in his life that's right and it was his mama yed who took her darling baby Prophet a Prett little baby in all the world at that time a sweet little fella and put him in an ark and shoved him out into the Nile where crocodiles was fat on little Hebrew children think about that for a minute mother put her son in a basket and pushed him into the Nile where the crocodiles were fat right on Hebrew children all right they' been feeding them to the crocodiles left and right and she took her baby and shoved it right out into the jaws of death why would she do that why would a do that because she knew that God's purpose would not be defeated she said God of Abraham take care of my child bring you to the purpose you brought him for there wasn't enough water in the Nile to drown him there was enough crocodiles in all the world that could have swallowed him he was God's chosen he was God's chosen for that purpose and we are God's chosen today who believe in the resurrection of the Lord Jesus [Music] they can call us cult manf followers whatever they want to do but they will never defeat [Applause] us there's no bombs there's no hell there's no nothing that can destroy God's purpose we got to go in the resurrection it's a promise we have of God God's UND defeatable Eternal purpose he's got it all in control he's got it all in control he put that reassurance way down in my soul think about it yeah Moses on the back side of the desert they let him hear the screams and the haunts and the staggered in the wilderness that's right back there along in the desert and the Hing winds and the Scorpions in the cobras alone out in the wilderness till he almost perished yeah but there's nothing that can defeat the purpose of God and God had brought Moses forth and Moses had to do he had to do what God told him to do because God's purpose cannot be defeated so whatever God spoke for Moses life Moses was going to do that in spite of the Nile in spite of crocodiles in spite of the desert come on somebody and if God has spoke a purpose for this bride let me tell you she will do it there is nothing no I nothing can stop us you Lord then don't be scared just Rejoice thank you Lord God's purpose cannot be defeated how many times you going to say that till you believe it on Joseph and Mary was told the child was to be born in Bethlehem okay okay not on the road not on the hill not at the city welcome sign that's right it had to be Bethlehem the word called for it come on well you reckon we're pretty close Joseph and I tell you I got I'm feeling him kicked pretty hard maybe we should stop right here no no we can't stop right here we're still one mile out that's right on come on you can't just stop in the first pull the second pull you got to go on you got to go on you got to go on you got to go on for the word that's promised for your day come on somebody Hallelujah the seals have been open they've told us more than God's A Healer we know God's A Healer but the word has been open to tell [Applause] us don't be afraid of the journey Hallelujah hear me do not be afraid of the journey that's right Lord don't worry about the mule D don't worry about thieves on the road just Journey to the purpose the child will be born in Bethlehem because God said [Applause] so oh little bride don't be afraid of the journey we are born for a purpose we are put here to reproduce Jesus Christ in the flesh again will not put her to be a Creed will not put her to be a dog preaching come on thinking about the mag God watched over them two years Journey why because they had the appropriate gifts that's right to identify his presence on the earth they had the appropriate gifts to identify his presence on the earth and nothing that the devil had would stop them from getting to Jesus for they were born they were born to identify him on the earth amen that's right then what have you been put on the earth to [Applause] do come on now not just a church member come on come on well I'm in the message I believe the message what does that really mean the devil believes the message I was out in the woods praying here not long ago in the back feel back our place I go and pray sometimes and I was back there talking to the Lord and I just begin to pray I said Lord are we just getting on the shout or are we getting them to Jesus and while I was praying a voice spoke to my heart you prayed you know how it is something spoke to my heart and said go ask them are you in the message come on or is the message in you for if you're just in this message somebody can talk you out of it but if the message is in you all hell cannot get it out of you we're not born just to be message followers we are born to be the message Hallelujah I said we are born to be the message that the quotes would come out of the books and they would live in our [Applause] lives Mark 6 47 Jesus in a great storm so when evening would come the ship was in the midst of the sea and he was alone on the land and he saw them toying and rolling for the wind was contrary unto them and about the Fourth Watch of the night he cometh unto them walking upon the sea and would have passed by them but when they saw him walking upon the sea they supposed it had been a spirit and they cried out cuz they didn't recognize him that's right that's right all right that's true for all they saw him and they were troubled and immediately he talked to them and said unto them be of good cheer than Lord it is I Be not Afraid amen that's right and when he went into them into the ship and the wind ceased they were sore amazed that's right in themselves beyond measure and wonder yeah message people saw a miracle and we're amazed and wers and he might have said something to them don't you understand what's happening don't you see the season you're living in this is manifestation time God is manifesting himself in flesh do you understand the season that you are in God wants more in this hour is manifesting himself in flesh they cried out they were scared but he said it's me don't be afraid oh thank you Lord how would you know him tonight oh my how would you know it was him if he spoke tonight how would you know because he will do the same thing that he did then he's the high priest thank you he's the high priest right now that can be touched by the fet or infirmities he's making intercession yeah that's right Jesus Promised in the last days these things would take place you believed on receiving the Holy Ghost and received it come on you believed on receiving the Holy Ghost and you received it they believed on Jesus and received him you see the parallel they was out there in the ocean ready to drown because he wasn't there and when he come up they got scared of him because he come up in a different form he come up in a different way but it was still Jesus amen come on I've told this before but I just got to tell it again come on I was over in South Carolina getting some gas going to a meeting and I go in pay for my gas and it was in the days of covid when we all wore those terrible mask we had to stand six foot apart for absolutely no reason but right we done it cuz they said to oh yeah I wore a mask for years in surgery I know what them things do so I was standing there by the Tater chips and this guy walked in and he must have been a local cuz the lady behind the cash register she goes like this she go what John you've changed your mask now apparently he'd wore the same mask May Superman I don't know he'd wore the same mask for months and he comes in with a different mask on come on and she said John it's John but you've changed your mask oh God when she said that how about shouted Pastor tato you PR because don't you understand that's exactly what's happening in this day God bailed himself behind the mask of the groom but now that same God is bailed once more behind the mask of the Bride it's a different form but it's the same one it's a different form but it's the same one hallelujah hallelujah if you want to know if it's him or not go back to the word the word will testify of God the word testifies of itself the word for your day if you watch the word of your promise for this day you'll hear the voice speaking through the word and he'll tell you it's me that moment that you recognize yeah it's me yeah come on yes you know I preached a message a few years ago on it's me yeah and I called up brother bisc and I said brother Ben could you tell me the story about what happened to you about the VIS he said yeah brother I'll be glad to and he said you know brother said brother bam called me about a month before that vision and told me about the vision and he said it meant absolutely nothing to me it was just a vision so I go on the hunting trip and he talks about this green Checker shirt and everybody says nobody's got that shirt and brother said well perhaps it'll be somewhere else but it sure looks like this is the place where that Vision takes place yeah and brother Bell said I go out that morning cross in a log I slip and fall into the creek I'm wet I go back to the tent I change clothes it's dark and I go out he said brother I scoped all day looking for game oh my come on J laughing talking telling you you

brother Bisal is identified with that Vision that's right God had a vision for the bride and now that vision is being manifested and you need to come to the realization it's me he's talking about me [Music] the same word speaking to you I promis to do this in the last day don't be afraid fear not don't be scared put your trust in me he will not be defeated no matter what takes place he will never be defeated thank you Lord when you realize God has revealed to you the truth of the thing there's nothing in the world going to defeat you in it that's all you're absolutely un defeatable you're absolutely undefeatable Hallelujah who's he talking to you right there's nothing in the world going to defeat you absolutely undefeatable not you but the god that's in you not Christ not the body but the word that was in him not Mary but the word that was born from her then what are you saying I said let's go forth from these meetings with this understanding we will not be defeated there is nothing that's coming there is nothing that Satan is bringing that can stop this bride we may have trials we may have trouble but there is nothing that will stop this bride from fulfilling the purpose of God for his bride will not be defeated and God's purpose will not be defeated has given us perfect Assurance thank you Lord that the bride will not be defeated we have nothing to fear well Glory you were made for an eternal purpose because you was the manifestation of an attribute that was in God the thought of you and expressed you and made an earth to take you out of you know when God

must first be child trained for the purpose that God has ordained you for and remember if you could just Qui keep quiet remember if he's called you for this there is nothing that can keep it from happening if you are a part of this Rapture bride there is nothing that can keep it from happening to you he's called you for this there's not enough devils in torment for what God's word will be made benefit you were born for a purpose and nobody can take your place you might have impersonators and everything else but they'll never take your place God's word will Triumph it canot fail that's where every Christian ought to stand knowing that trials will come up and seem every way but remember God has purposed and it will all work out right can I have just a few more minutes look what was Jesus manifested for why was Jesus manifested what was he manifested for to show God Amen then what is the bride manifested for now why could you amen that part not amen that part come on because the
