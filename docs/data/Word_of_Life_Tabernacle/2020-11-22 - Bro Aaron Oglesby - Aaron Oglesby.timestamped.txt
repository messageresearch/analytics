[36:59] could tell I was getting a little bit
[37:00] tense and the minister texted me cuz I
[37:03] wasn't at the church yet and it was like
[37:05] 22 service time and he said I did mean
[37:07] 10:00 a.m. and my wife says Aaron I'm
[37:11] I'm praying for you and my daughter says
[37:12] I'm praying too dad that it won't be a
[37:15] flop so I have a very supportive uh
[37:19] group of
[37:20] children I say all that but I'm thankful
[37:23] to have them with me I'm I'm very happy
[37:24] to be here let's go to the Lord now as
[37:26] we begin to turn our attention to him
[37:29] and let's talk to
[37:31] him Heavenly Father Lord we've gathered
[37:33] here this morning as we said Lord with
[37:35] no hope in ourselves Lord not look into
[37:38] anything Lord God that we could possibly
[37:40] say because Lord our words cannot help
[37:43] your people our words Lord God Alone
[37:46] there'd be thoughts of a man Lord God
[37:48] would not benefit this group of people
[37:50] any Lord but your anointing is what
[37:52] breaks the chains lord it's your
[37:53] anointing that comes and speaks to the
[37:55] hearts of your people Lord I believe now
[37:57] that I'm standing in front of a portion
[38:00] Lord God of the people that you bought
[38:02] and paid for with your very blood Lord
[38:04] and and I I recognize the responsibility
[38:07] of that Lord and the weight of that and
[38:09] I pray that you would shut my mouth Lord
[38:10] to not say anything Lord that wouldn't
[38:12] please you Lord I I pray that you would
[38:14] lead and you would guide me and that you
[38:16] would have the preeminence and Lord that
[38:18] you would anoint my tongue to speak
[38:19] freely that which you once spoke to
[38:21] these people this morning Lord Lord
[38:24] because if you don't show up it's a
[38:25] meaningless Gathering of people but Lord
[38:28] if you come Lord lives are changed when
[38:30] you come shackles are broken when you
[38:32] come the sick are healed and Lord we're
[38:34] inviting you Lord not not inviting you
[38:37] hoping but we invite you knowing that
[38:39] you will be here Lord your word promised
[38:41] it your Prophet taught us that you keep
[38:42] all your appointments we thank you for
[38:45] that now as we begin to look to your
[38:46] word I ask that you'll just bless it
[38:48] Lord that you will bless the people that
[38:49] have made the effort to come out today
[38:51] Lord in Jesus name we pray amen amen if
[38:55] you would open your Bibles with me today
[38:57] today we're going to turn to 1
[38:58] Corinthians 9 and verse 24 9 and verse
[39:11] 24 and it says there we're going to read
[39:13] one verse there and then we're going to
[39:14] go to Second Timothy 4 it says there
[39:17] know ye not that they which run a race
[39:21] in a race run all but one receiveth the
[39:25] priz so run that you may obtain notice
[39:31] one receiveth the prize there's one that
[39:34] he's called out in this day there's one
[39:36] that he's elected there's one bride body
[39:38] of Jesus Christ that's going to receive
[39:40] the prize 2 Timothy
[39:43] 4:7 I have fought a good
[39:45] fight I have finished my
[39:48] course I have kept the faith henceforth
[39:52] there is laid up for me a crown of
[39:54] righteousness which the Lord the
[39:56] righteous judge shall give me at that
[39:58] day and not to me only but unto all them
[40:02] thank you Lord Jesus unto all them that
[40:05] love his appearing I pray the Lord will
[40:08] add His blessings to the word you may be
[40:10] seated this
[40:14] morning I'd like to read a quote here
[40:17] from Brother Bram from how can I
[40:18] overcome in
[40:20] 1963 it says then Dayan raised Dayan
[40:23] rather raised up and so did core and
[40:26] they tried tried to say this man is
[40:28] trying to make himself above all the
[40:30] rest of us he's more holy than the rest
[40:32] of us after God had thoroughly
[40:35] Vindicated the man they said we're we're
[40:37] just a start a we'll start a group of
[40:39] people we'll make this that or the other
[40:42] we'll make our organizations will do and
[40:45] they died and perished but those men had
[40:48] that word of the Lord and they stayed
[40:51] with it and they went over not he that
[40:55] starts he that that finishes many start
[40:59] the race but there's one finishing it
[41:03] there'll be many churches start many
[41:05] groups of people but there'll be one
[41:08] group that finish that's the Overcomers
[41:12] Hallelujah that's the Overcomers and I
[41:14] want to speak to you today on a on a
[41:16] simple thought anointed to
[41:19] finish anointed to finish and and Paul
[41:22] teaches us there in the scripture who it
[41:24] is that gets a reward we we recognize
[41:28] that we're in a battle and the and the
[41:29] scriptures would compare this battle or
[41:31] give us the analogy of it as being a
[41:33] race and Paul tells us that not
[41:35] everybody that runs in this race is
[41:37] going to get a reward not everybody who
[41:40] participates is going to get a reward
[41:42] see the Christian walk isn't like our
[41:44] society today where every single person
[41:46] gets a participation trophy everybody
[41:49] gets something just for signing up um it
[41:51] doesn't matter if you fail it doesn't
[41:53] matter if you fall short it doesn't
[41:54] matter if you win the game here's your
[41:56] trophy and that's what our society has
[41:58] become today and that concept has bled
[42:00] right on over into religious circles it
[42:02] doesn't matter if you're overcoming it
[42:04] doesn't matter if you're defeating the
[42:06] devil you can fall to sin here you can
[42:08] have a little bit of sin in your life
[42:10] there you can do this and then you'll
[42:11] die and the preacher will give you your
[42:13] participation trophy well another Angel
[42:16] went home to be with the Lord today he
[42:18] went to be to get his reward today and
[42:20] we know that in fact this isn't true
[42:22] Paul says if you want to reward you must
[42:25] win if you want to reward you you have
[42:27] to overcome you're not just going to get
[42:29] one because you started the race he said
[42:31] not everybody who runs is going to get a
[42:34] prize listen Paul wouldn't be very
[42:37] popular today Paul said you got to win
[42:39] Paul said there's winners and there's
[42:41] losers and if you don't win you're not
[42:43] going to get your reward if you don't
[42:45] win you're not going to get granted
[42:47] eternal life he says you have to re win
[42:50] you want a reward then
[42:53] win Revelation 3:21 says to him that
[42:56] overcometh
[42:58] overcometh will I grant to sit with me
[43:00] in my throne even as I also overcame and
[43:03] and sat down with my father and his
[43:05] throne you have to overcome Hallelujah
[43:09] all right he's exhorting the people in
[43:11] his day he's telling them you got to run
[43:13] you can't quit you got to run it doesn't
[43:15] matter that you started many have
[43:16] started but you today you must run don't
[43:20] stop persevere because this is not about
[43:24] participating come on a halfway ATT
[43:27] attempt a halfway effort is never going
[43:30] to get you a prize look in war two sides
[43:33] fight and at the end of the war the the
[43:36] the country that loses does not get a
[43:37] participation trophy right to the victor
[43:41] goes the spoils to the one that won the
[43:43] battle to the one who came out
[43:45] Victorious they are the ones that will
[43:47] be rewarded and I believe with all my
[43:49] heart I'm looking at those Overcomers
[43:51] today I'm looking at a portion of people
[43:53] that won't quit I'm looking at a portion
[43:55] of people that will not give up because
[43:57] you've been anointed to finish you've
[43:59] been given what you have need of to keep
[44:01] walking in the dark times to keep
[44:03] fighting when all seems lost because
[44:04] you've been anointed for the hour that
[44:06] you live
[44:08] in today we're fighting in the greatest
[44:11] battle ever fought it's a battle for the
[44:14] souls of
[44:16] men it's a battle for your soul it's a
[44:19] battle for your
[44:20] home but not only are we in the greatest
[44:23] battle the last
[44:25] battle but you you've been entrusted
[44:27] with the most difficult part of that
[44:30] battle the
[44:32] closing the last mile The Last Stand the
[44:38] finish and in order to win and in order
[44:40] to overcome you're going to have to be
[44:42] completely 100% sold out because in the
[44:47] in in the midst of this battle it's
[44:49] going to be so difficult and it already
[44:51] is difficult sometimes we've heard hard
[44:53] times are coming hard times are coming
[44:54] and they're coming but they're also here
[44:56] right hard times are amongst us but in
[44:58] the midst of it if you're not completely
[45:00] sold out you will quit if you're not
[45:03] completely sold out you will give in and
[45:04] even if you don't give in and turn and
[45:06] go back as it were you won't run with
[45:08] the perseverance that's needed and
[45:10] therefore you will be overtaken in order
[45:13] to get the reward of the Kinsman today
[45:15] you must be so sold out like we saw with
[45:17] Ruth Ruth came to a new land Ruth left
[45:20] everything behind and when she got there
[45:22] it wasn't just all Rosy it wasn't easy
[45:25] like she had hoped many times we make a
[45:27] change and we think when we get there
[45:28] it's just going to be perfect or we turn
[45:30] a corner and we're going through a trial
[45:32] we turn a corner and we go it's finally
[45:34] over and you looking there's more of
[45:36] this in front of me is there is behind
[45:37] me I must have turned the wrong Corner
[45:40] let me let me look somewhere else but in
[45:42] that moment you got a buckle up in that
[45:44] moment you can't quit she realized it's
[45:47] not easy here I could go back to Moab I
[45:49] could go back to my father's house but
[45:51] she said I'd rather glean right here I'd
[45:53] rather struggle right here I'd rather
[45:55] get my all right here than to ever go
[45:58] back to where I came from than to ever
[46:00] go back to who I was because she sold
[46:02] out and in selling out it got the
[46:05] attention of the Kinsman it got his
[46:07] attention she he said it's been told me
[46:09] all that you've done You' sold out you
[46:11] left it all behind and in a moment she
[46:14] went from gleaning she went from
[46:15] struggling and the next day she owned
[46:17] the field that she was gleaning in the
[46:19] day before when you're sold out that's
[46:22] when you get the reward when you're sold
[46:24] out that's when you get the blessing
[46:25] you're looking for
[46:28] there's no way we can fulfill all that
[46:32] must be done here at the end unless
[46:35] we're sold
[46:37] out and if you haven't sold out you're
[46:40] not going to make it that's not to
[46:42] condemn you that's not to say that's
[46:44] telling you if you hadn't sold out
[46:45] there's time get it done if you hadn't
[46:47] sold out let's get sold out if you
[46:50] hadn't sold out today's the day don't
[46:52] wait another
[46:54] minute but even though hard times are
[46:56] com coming as we said and hard times are
[46:58] here you can have confidence that none
[47:01] of this is a surprise to him none of
[47:03] this has caught him off guard the evil
[47:06] in this day didn't catch him unaware
[47:08] he's not up there going oh my goodness
[47:11] well Satan really caught me with all
[47:12] this I you know I didn't expect it to
[47:14] get that he knew exactly what was coming
[47:16] and he knew exactly what it would take
[47:17] to be Victorious and in that knowing he
[47:20] provided you with exactly what you would
[47:22] need to overcome in this evil day he's
[47:25] provided all we have need of to
[47:26] persevere all the way to the end because
[47:30] God knew you couldn't do this on your
[47:31] own he understood man would fall he
[47:33] already saw what man would do with
[47:35] temptation on their own you see it all
[47:37] down through the Old Testament that even
[47:39] though there was sacrifices made without
[47:41] the nature of that sacrifice being able
[47:43] to come back on a human being they could
[47:45] not live Victorious over sin he knew
[47:48] that which is why he sent back his holy
[47:50] spirit so that that could indwell in us
[47:52] and we we can walk above sin we can
[47:53] overcome sin we can be victorious
[47:56] because we must be victorious in order
[47:58] to get the reward it's not him that runs
[48:00] it's him that is Victorious and you must
[48:03] have that Holy Spirit today in order to
[48:05] be that he knew how difficult this race
[48:09] would be and that's why he's anointed a
[48:11] people a last day people with a Last Day
[48:15] message anointed to run the last leg of
[48:19] the race anointed to finish the last
[48:22] part of the
[48:25] battle we find that that word finish or
[48:28] finished or the phrase to finish has
[48:32] many different
[48:33] meanings one of them can be like I am
[48:37] finished it can mean I I just can't go
[48:39] on I'm finished brother Ben I just can't
[48:42] go
[48:43] on that's not us that's not the
[48:45] definition we're looking for this
[48:46] morning let's move on
[48:48] down I finished can mean completed
[48:51] whether good or bad well I finished it
[48:54] well this also isn't what we're looking
[48:56] for this morning
[48:57] finished can mean done for I'm I'm so
[49:00] finished I'm done for I I'm doomed I'm
[49:04] consumed that's not applicable to us
[49:07] today it can mean to accomplish or to
[49:10] fulfill to bring to a close or to
[49:12] complete and maybe we'll deal with some
[49:14] of these meanings more later but another
[49:16] meaning for the phrase to finish means
[49:18] to close out strong to be a finisher
[49:22] you're someone who will close out strong
[49:25] look we want to finish this race just as
[49:27] strong as we started this race you
[49:29] remember how it was when you got saved
[49:31] and there was a fervency and there was a
[49:33] Zeal and you were running and you were
[49:34] never going to look back but over time
[49:37] struggles and life and things begin to
[49:39] wear you down that's how that's just
[49:42] life but in the midst of that you can't
[49:44] begin to stop you have to recognize I'm
[49:46] called for a purpose I'm chosen for a
[49:48] purpose and I want to finish this just
[49:50] as strong as I started this and the
[49:52] Lord's looking at it the same way he
[49:53] wants his church that started in the
[49:55] book of Acts to finish just as strong
[49:57] over here at the end as where they
[49:59] started he said I he knows how he
[50:02] started his church a friend used to say
[50:04] God started his church the way he wanted
[50:06] it and now he wants his church the way
[50:09] he started it all right we got to get to
[50:11] the point where it's another book of
[50:12] Acts where we're walking around and
[50:14] we're not afraid to face Devils we're
[50:15] not afraid to face sickness we know that
[50:18] when the hands are laid on the sick they
[50:19] shall recover we got to finish the race
[50:22] as strong as they started the race you
[50:25] did run well what hindereth there's been
[50:28] a message that came to turn your heart
[50:29] back to the faith of the fathers what
[50:32] hindereth get a hold of the faith and
[50:34] run today run with everything you have
[50:36] and finish strong we're right here you
[50:38] can see the Finish Line it's not time to
[50:41] slow
[50:43] down we want to be
[50:49] finishers if you'll forgive a few Sports
[50:53] analogies I'm a football coach by trade
[50:57] I teach school and coach
[51:00] football and in the World of
[51:02] Sports certain people certain teams are
[51:06] known as
[51:08] finishers they just seem to have that
[51:10] little something special that little
[51:12] something extra that other it may not
[51:14] even be a talent thing they just have
[51:16] that little something extra that pushes
[51:18] them in the closing moments of races in
[51:20] the closing moments of games or whatever
[51:22] the competition may be when everyone
[51:24] else tenses up when everyone else draws
[51:27] back from that moment of pressure uh
[51:30] when others begin to waver this is when
[51:32] they Shine the brightest this is when
[51:34] they perform the best this is the moment
[51:37] they were made for as it were they know
[51:39] how to finish and and I don't believe
[51:42] that we got down here to the very end of
[51:44] time and God put people here on this
[51:46] Earth that weren't able to finish what
[51:48] he started I believe he's got a the very
[51:50] people handpicked hand selected that he
[51:52] wants here for the moment that is upon
[51:54] us to finish the job to to to win the
[51:57] race as it were to overcome he didn't he
[51:59] didn't come all the way down here and
[52:01] not have confidence in you and the devil
[52:03] wants to come and tell you you're no
[52:04] good and you're a nobody and you're this
[52:06] and you're going to fail I'd like to
[52:08] remind him this morning that God
[52:09] Almighty has confidence in me brother
[52:12] Brandon would say that trial you're
[52:13] going through and the struggle you're
[52:14] going through you're in it because God
[52:16] handpicked you and knew you would
[52:18] overcome it he said God has confidence
[52:20] in you and I'm here to tell you this
[52:22] morning our God has confidence that you
[52:24] will finish the race and you will finish
[52:26] strong and you will finish Victorious
[52:28] and he has a crown awaiting you because
[52:30] of
[52:32] it he has absolute confidence in us
[52:35] because he provided us with the
[52:38] anointing that we need to finish the
[52:42] job not just across the Finish Line
[52:44] church that this bride's not just going
[52:47] to go in barely making it we're not just
[52:49] going to crawl across the finish line
[52:51] and oh we did it and and the Lord stand
[52:54] there going I just didn't know I was
[52:55] hoping I was rooting for you wooo that
[52:59] was close no sir this is going to be a
[53:01] Victorious bride an overcoming bride a
[53:03] bride without spot or wrinkle a bride
[53:05] that can look and say I never did it in
[53:06] the first place his blood cleansed me
[53:08] his blood changed me his blood gave me
[53:10] the power that I needed to overcome in
[53:12] this evil day you're not just going to
[53:14] barely make it you are Overcomers You
[53:17] Are Victorious
[53:24] People you have been hand picked for
[53:27] this time and so many times we recognize
[53:30] the evil around us and brother brand
[53:31] said we talk so much about the evil in
[53:33] the world and all the time we don't
[53:34] recognize how strong the church is
[53:36] getting we talk about how strong the
[53:38] world is listen it's true that the tree
[53:40] of knowledge of Good and Evil has
[53:41] reached its height but there's another
[53:43] tree there's a bride tree and it has
[53:45] also reached its height and it's in full
[53:47] power it's in full Glory it has the full
[53:49] anointing it has all the attributes of
[53:51] her of her groom and she's here in full
[53:54] power and she is every bit of match for
[53:56] that tree of knowledge of Good and Evil
[53:58] and everything that would come off of it
[53:59] and all the evil in the world you're
[54:00] more than a match quit cing down to it
[54:03] quit bowing down to it you are more than
[54:05] a match you are more than a match you're
[54:07] the one that's bone of his bone you're
[54:09] the one that's flesh of his flesh you're
[54:10] the one that's the final voice to the
[54:12] final age I'm talking to you it's you
[54:14] this morning it's not another age
[54:16] there's not another age coming you can't
[54:17] say they'll finish it you're called to
[54:19] finish you're called to take this across
[54:21] the Finish Line it's you you are a
[54:24] finisher you are a closer
[54:27] so many times we look I'm just a little
[54:29] I'm just I'm just you have been called
[54:32] for this
[54:36] day the closing or the Finish is always
[54:40] the most
[54:42] difficult and the teams that have the
[54:45] ability to finish
[54:46] strong are are teams that realize that
[54:48] you don't win or lose in the first
[54:51] quarter they're they realize and
[54:53] understand that things get more
[54:54] difficult as the game progresses
[54:57] Stakes get higher pressure becomes
[54:59] greater every single mistake you make is
[55:01] magnified
[55:03] greater everything's looked at through a
[55:05] magnifying glass and this sounds just
[55:07] like the day that we're living in right
[55:08] now there has never been an age with so
[55:11] much
[55:12] pressure we know brother Bram spoke on
[55:14] it often and he would call it a neurotic
[55:18] age he says it's just simply a neurotic
[55:21] age that we're living in I it's the time
[55:24] that we're living in pressure we're
[55:26] living in an erotic age nervous tension
[55:29] everybody's racing here going there
[55:31] going nowhere it's just to that kind of
[55:34] age and I know this church would be
[55:37] plagued with it as everywhere is plagued
[55:40] with it the Tabernacle is plagued with
[55:43] it everywhere the whole world it's a day
[55:47] of pressure as the end of anything near
[55:50] as you find that there's always going to
[55:51] be more and more pressure second Timothy
[55:54] 3 And1 says this know also
[55:57] that in the last days perilous times
[56:00] shall come perilous here means
[56:03] dangerous perilous here means hard to
[56:07] bear oh my you look around at the world
[56:09] today brother Ben if we didn't have
[56:11] Jesus it would be more than hard to bear
[56:13] I don't understand how people keep their
[56:15] sanity well well most of them
[56:18] don't so that explains it but what I'm
[56:20] saying is I'd be right there with them
[56:22] I'm no better than them but because we
[56:24] have Jesus because we have this anointed
[56:26] because we've been given an end time
[56:27] message that places us under the safety
[56:30] of his wings that puts us in the Cliff
[56:32] of the rock that tells us in the time of
[56:34] trouble he's going to hide us away it
[56:36] gives us the fortitude and the strength
[56:37] that we need to go on through this time
[56:39] of pressure and to finish the race
[56:42] listen there's no hope today outside of
[56:44] Christ there's no hope outside of Christ
[56:46] I'm telling you if I didn't have Jesus
[56:48] it would tear me apart what are my kids
[56:50] what kind of world are we leaving our
[56:51] kids what kind of country are we leaving
[56:53] our kids there's no hope here there's no
[56:55] hope in your retirement there's no hope
[56:57] in your 401k there's no hope in anything
[57:00] but in the Lord Jesus Christ and I say
[57:02] today run into him run into him with
[57:04] everything you got he's not only hope he
[57:07] is your savior he's your deliverer he's
[57:09] your healer he's your everything he will
[57:11] provide everything you have need of in
[57:13] the closing of
[57:16] time perilous
[57:18] times brother brand said men's hearts
[57:20] are failing for fear perplexed of time
[57:23] distress between the Nations the Earth's
[57:25] getting so nervous till it's bursting
[57:28] from earthquakes
[57:29] everywhere Jesus said it would be that
[57:31] way there'll be earthquakes in diverse
[57:33] places what's the matter the Earth knows
[57:36] she's doomed she's nervous the world's
[57:40] nervous thankfully the quote doesn't
[57:42] stop right there come on but the church
[57:44] is rising in the gospel tucked away with
[57:48] security he that cometh to me I will in
[57:52] no wise cast out let me reiterate what I
[57:55] said to you earlier if you're not all
[57:56] the way in yet he's not going to cast
[57:58] you out come on in he's telling you the
[58:01] door's still open I don't know when
[58:02] it'll close but I'm telling you today
[58:04] he's still calling right now he's still
[58:06] calling you got children out there don't
[58:08] give up hope now persevere pray for them
[58:11] hold on to the promise he gave the
[58:13] promise I didn't the door's still open
[58:15] Grace is still open Mercy is still here
[58:17] get in the ark while the door's
[58:22] open all you got to do is look around
[58:24] and you'll realize it's obvious we're at
[58:26] the end you know for
[58:29] years I have a lot of denominational
[58:31] friends that I work with good Christian
[58:32] people with all they know and for years
[58:36] the talk or the concept of the end time
[58:39] wasn't even something they would talk
[58:40] about they would say stuff like oh who
[58:42] knows when he's coming it could be
[58:43] thousand years it could be this and I'd
[58:45] be like no I believe he's coming soon I
[58:47] believe we're in there and that didn't
[58:49] correlate with them but we've gotten to
[58:51] the point where it's gotten so bad so
[58:53] wicked so evil that even my Baptist
[58:54] friends and my Methodist friends are
[58:56] going it's something's happening it's
[58:57] the end of time something's happening
[58:59] he's coming soon and I'm telling you if
[59:01] the foolish virgins are starting to look
[59:02] around for oil where are we brother Ben
[59:04] if they're starting to look around and
[59:06] realize the bridegroom's coming where
[59:07] are we this morning it's time to check
[59:09] up it's time to make your call in an
[59:11] election sure it's time to make sure
[59:13] your lamps are trimmed and bright cuz
[59:14] he's at the door he's at the door right
[59:16] now it's in a moment in a twinkling of
[59:18] an eye we're going to be changed it may
[59:19] be tomorrow it may be a few months from
[59:21] now it may be a few years from now it
[59:22] matters not we're at the door we're at
[59:25] the place where it's making the final
[59:26] sweep calling those in get in get your
[59:29] loved ones in and prepare to go home
[59:31] it's almost over we're at the finish
[59:33] line and you are the finishers the final
[59:36] voice to the final age the last ones
[59:38] running on this canvas of time there'll
[59:40] be no more to come behind us this is it
[59:43] we're
[59:48] there never has there been so much
[59:50] pressure on people of Faith regardless
[59:52] of
[59:53] denomination to the point that they're
[59:55] not wanting to let people people in the
[59:56] Supreme Court cuz they're Catholic and
[59:58] I'm
[1:00:00] thinking how bad have we gotten when the
[1:00:03] voice of morality in our country is the
[1:00:06] Catholic
[1:00:07] Church where are we on when the when the
[1:00:11] conservatives that everybody listen to
[1:00:13] your Shan hannes and Rush Lim balls and
[1:00:15] all those PE they're
[1:00:17] Catholics the Supreme Court is packed
[1:00:20] full of all Catholics and a
[1:00:22] Jew the Catholic church is in control of
[1:00:25] our country even now and yet we've got
[1:00:28] to a place where it's so evil that even
[1:00:30] those types of people that have any
[1:00:31] morals whatsoever even a little bit come
[1:00:33] under attack even a little bit of
[1:00:36] morality that they come under attack and
[1:00:38] and many truths from the Bible are now
[1:00:40] held up as hate speech things you're not
[1:00:42] listen the reason that is is truth
[1:00:45] sounds like hate to those who hate truth
[1:00:48] I know it's a cliche saying but it's the
[1:00:50] truth truth sounds like hate to those
[1:00:52] who hate truth and the reason they hate
[1:00:54] it so much is it EXP ches the lives they
[1:00:57] live they hate it so much because it
[1:00:59] brings condemnation to them it amazes me
[1:01:02] how many times if my wife and I come
[1:01:05] around people that normally are very
[1:01:07] talkative or very kind to me and
[1:01:09] suddenly my wife walks in the room
[1:01:10] there's a t totally different atmosphere
[1:01:12] a totally different feeling and there's
[1:01:14] this stand offness towards her many
[1:01:17] times not all the time but I tell her I
[1:01:19] said that that lady she's normally very
[1:01:21] friendly that guy he's normally very and
[1:01:23] what it is is there's something there
[1:01:24] there's a feeling they see that
[1:01:26] testimony and they know I had a guy tell
[1:01:29] me the other day he said he said I think
[1:01:31] I seen some people from your church
[1:01:32] coming in the restaurant while I was
[1:01:33] sitting there he said I could tell all
[1:01:35] the ladies came in and they was dressed
[1:01:37] like and he
[1:01:39] paused and he looked down and he said
[1:01:43] dress like ladies are supposed to
[1:01:45] dress they
[1:01:48] know they
[1:01:52] know but at the root of it all the evil
[1:01:55] of the a and everything that's come
[1:01:56] against us and all the persecution all
[1:01:58] the hatreds towards towards Christianity
[1:02:00] as a whole at the root of it all is
[1:02:02] Satan's desire to destroy the bride of
[1:02:04] Christ at the root of all because listen
[1:02:06] all the other organizations all the
[1:02:08] other doctrines of man he's got those in
[1:02:10] his hand he already controls those and
[1:02:12] yet the bride is the only place where
[1:02:15] fresh Revelation still flows and
[1:02:17] Revelation is what exposes The Works of
[1:02:20] the Devil Revelation is what gives you
[1:02:21] the power of overcoming he hates
[1:02:24] Revelation and so he's after you you
[1:02:26] have to understand that why am I under
[1:02:28] attack why are all these things
[1:02:29] happening well because he's after you
[1:02:31] and look I hate to give the devil any
[1:02:33] credit I really do but he's really good
[1:02:35] at what he does he's good he's studied
[1:02:37] man for thousands of years he knows you
[1:02:39] better than you know you many times
[1:02:42] we're sitting there going I'm strong I
[1:02:43] can handle that and the devil's over
[1:02:44] they
[1:02:45] going no he can't and I know if he keeps
[1:02:49] flirting with it and he keeps messing
[1:02:50] with it he's going to fall in temp into
[1:02:52] temptation he's going to give into that
[1:02:53] thing he knows you better than you know
[1:02:55] you he's good at what he does that's why
[1:02:57] you got to flee from the very appearance
[1:02:59] of evil that's why you got to get into
[1:03:00] Jesus Christ more than ever before he's
[1:03:02] pouring out all the evil he has with one
[1:03:05] Target in mind you he's after you but
[1:03:08] I'm here to tell you he's not going to
[1:03:10] get you because I've read the back of
[1:03:11] the book I know how the story ends he is
[1:03:14] not when my enemies Came Upon me they
[1:03:16] stumbled and they fell they're not going
[1:03:19] to overtake you they're not going to be
[1:03:20] victorious you are victorious you're the
[1:03:23] finishers you're going to get the reward
[1:03:25] if it's already written I've already
[1:03:27] read
[1:03:29] [Music]
[1:03:30] it Prophet says because man or woman
[1:03:33] that's ever been in the back of the
[1:03:35] desert alone like Moses
[1:03:38] was and the revelation of God be made
[1:03:40] manifest to him through the Holy Ghost
[1:03:42] there's nothing can shake him he's just
[1:03:45] as sound and solid as he can be Satan
[1:03:48] hates Revelation he don't like it he
[1:03:51] don't like it at all it upsets his plans
[1:03:54] because it EXP ches his plans listen
[1:03:58] he's battled for thousands of years and
[1:04:00] let me tell you why he hates you because
[1:04:02] he's tried everything he's burned him at
[1:04:04] the steak he's put him in the lon's den
[1:04:06] he's brought it down and created an Eden
[1:04:08] and he loves his Eden but he hates you
[1:04:10] because in the midst of his Eden there
[1:04:11] is a woman in the midst of his Eden
[1:04:13] there is a bride without spot without
[1:04:16] wrinkle she won't defile herself she
[1:04:18] won't give in and he hate you to the
[1:04:21] point that one day he's going to look at
[1:04:22] you like Pharaoh said he said get out
[1:04:25] take take your children take your health
[1:04:27] take your sanity and get out of my Eden
[1:04:31] we're going to live such an overcoming
[1:04:32] life where Satan himself is sick of
[1:04:34] looking up waking up in the morning
[1:04:36] looking out the window and going she's
[1:04:37] still here she hasn't caved she hasn't
[1:04:41] fallen and I'd like to tell him tonight
[1:04:42] we're not going to because we are
[1:04:45] anointed to finish
[1:04:58] baseball teams have something called a
[1:05:03] closer they come in at the very
[1:05:05] end when the pressure is the greatest to
[1:05:08] close out the game no matter the
[1:05:11] situation no matter if the bases are
[1:05:13] loaded and everything looks
[1:05:15] bad come on in and that guy don't look
[1:05:18] around and
[1:05:19] go him you want him oh me
[1:05:24] okay most of the time if you've ever
[1:05:26] seen a baseball game those guys come
[1:05:27] running out of the Dugout full speed
[1:05:29] they're excited oh he called me in the
[1:05:30] game he wants me to come finish this out

[1:05:35] morning come on in come on in the game
[1:05:38] quit looking around going who who you
[1:05:40] want he's talking to you he wants you in
[1:05:42] the game he wants you to finish the race
[1:05:44] he wants you to give the devil a black
[1:05:45] eye he wants you to be victorious over
[1:05:47] this he's calling your name this morning
[1:05:50] come on in you say that's not that's not
[1:05:52] me brother Aaron I'm not a closer I'm
[1:05:55] I'm not a finisher I get nervous I get
[1:05:57] shook up things bother me I'm not ready
[1:05:59] for that pressure you're more ready than
[1:06:02] you
[1:06:04] know every message you've ever heard
[1:06:07] every song you've ever sang Come on
[1:06:09] every prayer you've ever prayed you've
[1:06:12] been training for this
[1:06:14] moment I got to give I got to give
[1:06:15] credit where that came from many of
[1:06:18] y'all have heard the testimony of sister
[1:06:20] atanta buts and when she got her
[1:06:22] diagnosis of cancer her family didn't no
[1:06:25] just her and her husband she said Gather
[1:06:28] the family together so she gathers them
[1:06:30] together and she sits down in the midst
[1:06:32] of them and it wasn't a pity party it
[1:06:34] wasn't a woe as me she had just just
[1:06:37] been diagnosed with stage four Hotchkins
[1:06:39] Lymphoma and she looked at her family
[1:06:41] and she said it's our turn she said
[1:06:44] other people have had their turn now
[1:06:46] it's our turn she said every service
[1:06:48] we've ever been in every message we've
[1:06:50] ever heard every song we've ever sang
[1:06:53] has been leading us and preparing us for
[1:06:55] this
[1:06:56] moment I heard that and I'm like it made
[1:06:58] me feel so little I'm like can can you
[1:07:00] imagine sitting there telling your kids
[1:07:02] I'm not worried about this this is what
[1:07:04] we're built for this is what we're made
[1:07:05] for this is what we've been trained it's
[1:07:07] easy to go I'm praying for you brother
[1:07:09] I'm praying for you brother but what
[1:07:10] about when it's your turn what about
[1:07:12] when you've been called into the game
[1:07:14] what about when he says now it's your
[1:07:15] turn to overcome this you must remember
[1:07:17] I am called and I am Chosen and I've
[1:07:20] been called for a Time such as this to
[1:07:22] overcome this enemy we always say every
[1:07:24] devil in hell is going to be called
[1:07:25] conquered who's going to do it who's
[1:07:27] going to Conquer Cancer if somebody
[1:07:29] don't face cancer who's going to conquer
[1:07:31] depression if somebody don't face
[1:07:32] depression but when you face it you will
[1:07:35] win you will overcome because you've
[1:07:37] been training and you're more ready than
[1:07:39] you even
[1:07:43] know and Satan doesn't want you to
[1:07:46] know you know that the thing that one
[1:07:48] quote it's very
[1:07:51] familiar brother Bram says that if she
[1:07:54] comes to the true revelation of the true
[1:07:56] church and who she is and what she
[1:07:57] stands for but the beginning of that
[1:08:00] quote is it says Satan
[1:08:03] knows he knows that if you get that
[1:08:06] Revelation see he already knows and he
[1:08:09] wants to keep you from knowing so he
[1:08:11] piles this trial on you and he Pils this
[1:08:13] on you make bricks without straw don't
[1:08:16] let them recognize they're more and
[1:08:17] mightier than we make them do this
[1:08:18] change the tient make them work harder
[1:08:20] make them work late make them do this
[1:08:21] bring stress bring trials bring this and
[1:08:23] don't let them know cuz if they
[1:08:24] recognize who she is if they know who
[1:08:27] they are then the Gates of Hell will not
[1:08:30] Prevail against them so he knows and he
[1:08:32] wants to keep you from knowing all the
[1:08:36] things that he does is to keep you from
[1:08:38] recognizing who you are well I'm not
[1:08:40] that I'm not that listen David didn't
[1:08:43] think he could kill a line until he had
[1:08:44] to kill a Lon yeah come on David had
[1:08:47] never was known as a bear killer until
[1:08:49] he had to kill a bear he was ready and
[1:08:52] didn't even know it he didn't know he
[1:08:54] could kill Goliath till he got got tired
[1:08:55] of hearing Goliath's calls and bows and
[1:08:57] had to walk out on that field you may
[1:09:00] not know you can defeat cancer till
[1:09:01] you're face with it you may not know you
[1:09:03] can overcome anxiety till you're faced
[1:09:05] with it but you're more ready than what
[1:09:07] you realize because you've been anointed
[1:09:09] for the moment David was anointed for
[1:09:12] the
[1:09:14] moment you don't often know what kind of
[1:09:17] Faith you have till you have to put your
[1:09:18] faith in
[1:09:20] action and when you're faced with an
[1:09:22] obstacle God is always going to give the
[1:09:24] anointing that you need to not only to
[1:09:27] face that enemy but to destroy that
[1:09:31] enemy prophet of God says and father
[1:09:33] today we stand here by your
[1:09:35] grace and it's not
[1:09:37] because that we're a special people but
[1:09:40] it's because just like the day of the
[1:09:42] lion or the ox or the man it's Eagle
[1:09:46] time it's the anointing of the hour it's
[1:09:50] the time that we're living in it's the
[1:09:52] working of the holy spirit for this
[1:09:55] particular time to prove that Jesus is
[1:09:58] not dead the things that he said that he
[1:10:01] would do just before the evening lights
[1:10:02] went
[1:10:03] out that for this right here it works
[1:10:06] for me
[1:10:07] awesome it's the anointing of the
[1:10:10] hour in other words it's not the same
[1:10:12] anointing that Luther had it's not the
[1:10:15] same anointing that Wesley had it's a
[1:10:18] special anointing for this hour you say
[1:10:21] I don't always feel
[1:10:24] anointed sign me up in that club too I
[1:10:26] think we're all in that club I don't
[1:10:29] always feel anointed listen it wasn't
[1:10:31] like David went out there to kill
[1:10:32] Goliath with anointing or like dripping
[1:10:34] off his locks and running down his face
[1:10:36] and I'm
[1:10:38] anointed it had happened a long time
[1:10:40] before that but he had faith in the
[1:10:42] anointing that had been given him he
[1:10:44] wasn't walking out there with anointing
[1:10:46] oil dripping down into his sandals
[1:10:48] you're not always going to feel the
[1:10:50] anointing but a prophet had brought him
[1:10:52] a message and a prophet had told him
[1:10:54] you're going to be king and a prophet
[1:10:56] had told him you're going to sit on the
[1:10:57] throne and he trusted in the message
[1:10:59] that the prophet had given him listen
[1:11:02] you've been anointed under a message and
[1:11:03] told you're going to rule and Reign
[1:11:05] David was anointed and told that he was
[1:11:07] going to rule and Reign he trusted his
[1:11:08] anointing and so therefore he took down
[1:11:10] his Goliath today you got to trust in
[1:11:13] the anointing in the message that's been
[1:11:14] given you he's already seen you going up
[1:11:17] when others went down I'm going to trust
[1:11:18] in that so anything between here and
[1:11:21] there is not consequential to me I know
[1:11:23] I'm going to defeat it I know I'm going
[1:11:24] to over com it those things don't matter
[1:11:26] cuz I've already been told and seen in a
[1:11:29] vision
[1:11:34] hallu
[1:11:36] hallu you know Saul didn't have that
[1:11:39] same kind of
[1:11:40] Faith I've always thought you know they
[1:11:43] were under the same
[1:11:44] Covenant they had all been called to
[1:11:46] destroy
[1:11:47] Philistines I believe that any
[1:11:50] man in that Army could have walked out
[1:11:52] into that Valley and he would have been
[1:11:53] Victorious
[1:11:55] now the anointing gave that he had
[1:11:57] received was special and because of that
[1:11:59] anointing he had the faith he needed to
[1:12:00] go but any one of those men that would
[1:12:03] walked out there as a as a seat of
[1:12:05] Abraham as a circumcised seat of Abraham
[1:12:08] and stood against an uncircumcised
[1:12:09] Philistine would have overcame and would
[1:12:10] have been Victorious but they didn't
[1:12:12] have the courage to go what gave David
[1:12:15] the courage to go he had been anointed
[1:12:17] so we got to quit chiring in our tense
[1:12:19] we got to quit hiding back there like
[1:12:21] Saul we got to quit looking for somebody
[1:12:23] else to do it you were anointed you were
[1:12:25] anointed and somebody's got to answer
[1:12:27] the call today he's standing there still
[1:12:29] in Joy he's walking in your Valley
[1:12:31] saying I've taken your joy I'm taking
[1:12:33] your children I'm taking your Victory
[1:12:35] somebody's going to get tired of it
[1:12:36] somebody's going to have HT enough and
[1:12:38] somebody's going to walk into the valley
[1:12:40] somebody's going to walk down there and
[1:12:42] fight I never forget when I found out
[1:12:45] brother Ron Spencer had cancer I texted
[1:12:47] him just a few words of encouragement
[1:12:49] and let him know I was praying for him
[1:12:50] and a few things and he wrote back a
[1:12:52] very simple phrase but it was so
[1:12:53] powerful to me he said Goliath has shown
[1:12:56] up now we
[1:12:59] fight Church Goliath has showed up in
[1:13:02] your life Goliath has showing up around
[1:13:04] churches all over the message he's
[1:13:05] showing up in your homes it's time we
[1:13:07] fight it's time you come out your tent
[1:13:10] and say I'm coming into the valley to
[1:13:11] claim what's mine listen he was walking
[1:13:13] back and forth on Israelite land on land
[1:13:16] that had been given them by God promises
[1:13:18] given them by God and they stood and
[1:13:20] they watched it but brother Bram said
[1:13:22] one day there was a different set of
[1:13:23] ears in the camp there was a new set of
[1:13:25] ears in the camp and I pray today
[1:13:27] there's ears today that won't listen to
[1:13:28] it that won't tolerate it that won't
[1:13:30] stand back and let Goliath take what's
[1:13:33] theirs go into the valley this morning
[1:13:35] you're anointed for it
[1:13:38] Lord You're anointed for
[1:13:44] itall we must
[1:13:49] finish you know the anointing is a
[1:13:51] subject that could be ministered on over
[1:13:54] and over and over again You' never
[1:13:55] cover the
[1:13:56] vastness from many different
[1:13:59] angles and I know this is a very narrow
[1:14:01] definition but for the sake of today the
[1:14:04] anointing is the
[1:14:06] power and Leadership of the Holy Spirit
[1:14:09] given for a specific
[1:14:11] purpose the anointing is the power and
[1:14:15] Leadership of the Holy Spirit given for
[1:14:17] a specific purpose the anointing we
[1:14:19] speak of it in general terms but it's
[1:14:21] not a general thing it's very specific
[1:14:24] for your need and for the
[1:14:27] moment we Face many different things we
[1:14:29] have many different task and so there
[1:14:32] are many different types of anointings
[1:14:33] there's anointings to
[1:14:35] preach uh there's anointings to pray for
[1:14:37] the sick and cast out devils devils
[1:14:40] there's anointings to prophesy brother
[1:14:42] Brown many times would speak about the
[1:14:44] different anointings he would say things
[1:14:45] like this I've been preaching and then
[1:14:48] well usually the manager does the
[1:14:49] preaching and then I just come out under
[1:14:51] the anointing and I can stand longer
[1:14:54] quicker faster
[1:14:55] but this is a different
[1:14:57] anointing one is preaching the word and
[1:14:59] the other is working a gift Same Spirit
[1:15:03] two different
[1:15:04] manifestations he would say now if the
[1:15:06] Lord willing Wednesday night I'm going
[1:15:08] to try to come to the pull pit without
[1:15:09] speaking just come let brother Bale Bale
[1:15:11] or someone else to speak so we can just
[1:15:14] well I like for you to see the
[1:15:16] difference in the meeting see it's
[1:15:17] preaching is one anointing there's a
[1:15:20] prophetic gift something altogether
[1:15:22] different Same Spirit but different
[1:15:25] anointing so I say all that to let you
[1:15:27] understand that the anointing you're
[1:15:28] under in this age is a special different
[1:15:31] anointing it's just not some general
[1:15:33] anointing that was poured out through
[1:15:34] the seven Church ages we read in the
[1:15:36] Bible that there's the lion anointing
[1:15:38] there's an ox anointing There's the Man
[1:15:40] anointing and the eagle anointing see
[1:15:42] God is not just some kind of a general
[1:15:45] God like some people make him out to be
[1:15:47] that just is watching from above going
[1:15:49] well I'll give some goodness here and a
[1:15:50] little bit of this here and that
[1:15:51] denominational thinking of of what
[1:15:53] Christian what God is like but he's very
[1:15:56] concerned about your life and he gives
[1:15:58] very specific things for you for you to
[1:16:00] overcome he prepares exactly what it is
[1:16:03] needed for each person for each age for
[1:16:06] each day all the way down for each
[1:16:08] moment and and when God has sent you he
[1:16:12] has equipped you for the exact task that
[1:16:15] he knows that you're going to face so
[1:16:17] back to what we said yes it's a time of
[1:16:19] stress yes it's a time of great pressure
[1:16:21] and yet that's why we're under an eagle
[1:16:23] anointing because when the the pressure
[1:16:25] is down you can spread those wings when
[1:16:27] it's trying to hold you down you can
[1:16:28] rise up above all that pressure Eagles
[1:16:31] can fly in places that other birds can't
[1:16:33] Eagles can see things that other birds
[1:16:35] can't Eagles can rise above the storms
[1:16:37] when other birds are knocked down by
[1:16:39] those storms and church today I'm
[1:16:41] telling you operate in the anointing
[1:16:44] that you have been given you've been
[1:16:45] given it so spread your wings this
[1:16:47] morning quit being pushed down the
[1:16:49] devil's not going to quit pushing you
[1:16:51] down but you got to start flapping the
[1:16:53] wings they'll work they'll operate
[1:16:55] they'll do what they were intended to do
[1:16:57] and that's to raise you up above all
[1:16:59] these Earthly pressures and things look
[1:17:02] the church is seen in the Book of
[1:17:03] Revelation as a cage of every unclean
[1:17:06] and hateful bird but let me tell you
[1:17:08] what it didn't see there it didn't see
[1:17:10] Eagles there it didn't see Eagles there
[1:17:13] because they weren't trapped on the
[1:17:14] ground they weren't sitting ducks they
[1:17:16] were flying in the heavens but bathed in
[1:17:18] Revelation bathed in an anointing an
[1:17:21] anointing that is going to allow them to
[1:17:22] overcome this day Hallelujah
[1:17:25] because they're soaring in a different
[1:17:26] anointing brother Bram says his little
[1:17:30] eaglets those that are born of him and I
[1:17:33] made this little illustration many times
[1:17:35] on that how the eagle gets her little
[1:17:37] ones ready to fly and takes them up in
[1:17:39] the air and turns them loose and if a
[1:17:41] trow a crow tried to get up there every
[1:17:44] feather would fall out of him he's not
[1:17:46] pressurized to it see he couldn't stand
[1:17:48] the pressure but the Eagle's the only
[1:17:51] Bird born with that kind of a Feather
[1:17:53] that can go so high till a Halk couldn't
[1:17:55] come around him and he's got eyes and
[1:17:57] the higher you go the further you can
[1:17:59] see and what good would it do him to get
[1:18:01] up there if he didn't have eyes to see
[1:18:03] way away he couldn't see back where he
[1:18:05] come from and that's the only way that's
[1:18:07] the way with a Christian some of the
[1:18:09] people maybe got a buzzard
[1:18:12] disposition
[1:18:13] well we're not going to go down that
[1:18:17] road you it's amazing how you can come
[1:18:19] out and preach on Jesus and Judas and a
[1:18:21] lot of people come out going he called
[1:18:22] me Judas see they have a buzzard
[1:18:25] disposition they're looking at it
[1:18:27] through the eyes of the accuser instead
[1:18:29] of looking at it through the eyes of
[1:18:31] what the word says about them and that's
[1:18:33] all your disposition is is how you look
[1:18:35] at things start looking at everything
[1:18:37] through this word right here quit
[1:18:39] looking at yourself through the eyes and
[1:18:41] and through the filter of what the
[1:18:42] accuser says about you because he's not
[1:18:43] going to tell you anything good he's not
[1:18:45] going to tell you you know what brother
[1:18:46] men I think you're right I think you are
[1:18:47] going to make it he's never going to say
[1:18:49] that to you till the day you Rapture I
[1:18:51] tell you I don't Rapture morning I
[1:18:52] believe he's going to be sitting there
[1:18:53] Whispering saying you're sry Sor you're
[1:18:55] not going to make it you're not going to
[1:18:56] all sudden I'm going to go and he's
[1:18:58] going go he made it that's when he might
[1:19:01] say he made it is the day I disappear
[1:19:04] right in front of his very face because
[1:19:05] he's not going to leave you alone that's
[1:19:07] why you've been granted this
[1:19:10] anointing some people have a buzzard
[1:19:12] disposition eating the things of the
[1:19:14] world and the vultures and try to fly up
[1:19:17] there with an eagle he blows up there's
[1:19:20] too much pressure you got to be made for
[1:19:24] it
[1:19:25] so you are anointed and made for the
[1:19:27] pressure of the end time you were
[1:19:29] created and placed here for this time
[1:19:31] specifically for such a time as this and
[1:19:36] what I really want you to see today is
[1:19:37] that in reality you have nothing to fear
[1:19:39] because you've already made it you've
[1:19:41] already been seen making it every single
[1:19:43] thing in the Arsenal of God is at your
[1:19:46] disposal he didn't send you into battle
[1:19:48] and go my goodness here you know what I
[1:19:51] take this no he gave you everything but
[1:19:54] you got to put it on you got to put on
[1:19:56] the whole armor of God you got to take
[1:19:58] the weapons at your disposal you got to
[1:19:59] use the word you have nothing to fear
[1:20:01] because the word of God the weapon
[1:20:02] you've been given will defeat the Devil
[1:20:04] any place anytime anywhere under any
[1:20:06] circumstances so whatever circumstances
[1:20:09] you find yourself in today that is
[1:20:11] covered in the word any little bitty
[1:20:13] word lots of stuff fits in there
[1:20:16] whatever you're facing is covered in the
[1:20:18] word any any place anywhere anytime any
[1:20:22] circumstances take your weapon cut his
[1:20:24] head off walk in Victory and continue
[1:20:26] towards the Finish Line that's what
[1:20:27] you're called and anointed to do today
[1:20:30] Hallelujah don't allow Satan to distract
[1:20:32] you and get your eyes and focus on the
[1:20:34] negative things of the age as far as I'm
[1:20:36] concerned I don't care what your source
[1:20:38] is it's all fake news it's not my future
[1:20:41] it's not my calling it's not what I've
[1:20:43] been put here to do it doesn't concern
[1:20:45] me this age and all it's evil and
[1:20:47] everything that's going on it's not part
[1:20:48] of my purpose I'm not saying that not to
[1:20:51] be aware of what's going on those things
[1:20:53] many times are landmarks in the word of
[1:20:54] God that show you where you're at but
[1:20:56] it's not to become your focus it's not
[1:20:58] to become your diet because if those
[1:21:00] things become your focus it actually
[1:21:02] will bring you under a different
[1:21:03] anointing those things have an anointing
[1:21:05] that go with them it's an anointing of
[1:21:07] fear it's an anointing of anxiety it's
[1:21:09] an anointing of worry and and how things
[1:21:11] how bad things are and how are my kids
[1:21:13] ever going to make it how are my kids
[1:21:14] going to overcome and instead of looking
[1:21:16] at this you begin to look at how the
[1:21:17] things around you you begin to look at
[1:21:19] the waves what those things are are the
[1:21:21] waves that made Peter take his eyes off
[1:21:23] of Jesus those things are the waves just
[1:21:25] keep your eyes on Jesus just keep
[1:21:27] walking just take another step I'm in
[1:21:29] the middle of a trial don't stop in the
[1:21:31] trial take another step keep walking
[1:21:34] because pretty soon you're going to be
[1:21:35] hand in hand with the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:21:38] and then what does that trial matter
[1:21:40] then what does that fear matter it's
[1:21:42] over with it's silence it's
[1:21:48] finished we've been anointed by the
[1:21:50] pillar of fire returned to the church
[1:21:52] once again for what purpose for the
[1:21:55] finishing up of all
[1:21:57] things brother brandham says then there
[1:22:00] will come a message oh Hallelujah we
[1:22:03] know that that same Pillar of Fire that
[1:22:04] led Israel we know that the same
[1:22:06] Ministry that accompanied Jesus Christ
[1:22:08] by that Pillar of Fire that had him
[1:22:10] anointed is accompanying the church
[1:22:12] today science has proved it we don't
[1:22:15] need that God's proved it we need the
[1:22:17] ministry of Jesus Christ to fit The
[1:22:18] Headstone coming under that's brought
[1:22:20] the church into a place where the
[1:22:21] ministry is exactly like it was when
[1:22:23] Jesus left left exactly he says oh
[1:22:28] brother give me a church full of the
[1:22:29] Holy Ghost God will do in one year what
[1:22:31] all the theologies failed to do in 2,000
[1:22:33] years you wait till the anointing of the
[1:22:36] church really strikes home to that
[1:22:37] Faithful Little Remnant after the doors
[1:22:40] to the Gentiles is closed oh God will
[1:22:41] anoint a church then he who's filthy let
[1:22:43] him be filthy still he who's righteous
[1:22:45] let him be righteous still he who's holy
[1:22:47] let him be holy still and God will
[1:22:49] anoint the church with the power of God
[1:22:51] and things will be taking place not only
[1:22:54] then he's doing it now you need to
[1:22:58] recognize right now he's a living God
[1:23:00] right now he's in this building right
[1:23:02] now he's come to deliver you and set you
[1:23:04] free and give you what you have need of
[1:23:06] in your life right now this moment don't
[1:23:08] put off till tomorrow don't look back to
[1:23:10] yesterday he's here
[1:23:12] now you
[1:23:14] Lord the pillar of fire has never
[1:23:16] anointed somebody for
[1:23:18] defeat when you've been anointed by the
[1:23:20] pillar of fire you're anointed to
[1:23:21] overcome every unclean and foul Spirit
[1:23:23] you're anointed to overcome every
[1:23:25] depression and every Spirit of the age
[1:23:27] you're anointed to overcome everything
[1:23:29] that the devil can throw look we can't
[1:23:30] even name them all 200 thousand thousand
[1:23:34] I mean I can't tell you what they're all
[1:23:36] named but I know they fit in any I know
[1:23:39] they fit in all and I know you've been
[1:23:41] given an anointing to overcome any and
[1:23:43] all that the devil can throw at you in
[1:23:45] this last day you have been anointed to
[1:23:47] close out the to to close out the ages
[1:23:50] brother brandom said the train is in the
[1:23:53] blocks they'll get hat and left but the
[1:23:56] Train's in the blocks it's time to get
[1:23:58] on board it's time to sell out 100% I'm
[1:24:02] going look just a second back in
[1:24:03] Revelation 10:7 says but in the days of
[1:24:05] the voice of the seventh angel when he
[1:24:07] shall begin to sound the mystery of God
[1:24:10] should be finished see this message that
[1:24:14] called your name is a finishing message
[1:24:17] it's a message to finish with it's what
[1:24:20] placed you in this last day it's what
[1:24:23] brought you the fin fining anointing
[1:24:25] that you need and that means that it
[1:24:27] gives you the power to destroy or
[1:24:29] overcome anything between you and the
[1:24:32] Finish Line anything that stands between
[1:24:34] you and what you've been called to do
[1:24:36] God has already given you the power to
[1:24:37] overcome that any Affliction any power
[1:24:40] of Hell any doubt any fear any
[1:24:42] circumstances that's between here and
[1:24:43] there quit worrying about it and quit
[1:24:46] building it up look I understand it's
[1:24:48] human nature to see something we don't
[1:24:50] look at things and go yes woohoo look at
[1:24:53] this sickness could wait for this one no
[1:24:56] no I'm not I'm not asking to be that
[1:24:57] that's not what I'm saying I'm saying
[1:24:59] don't see it and coward down don't see
[1:25:01] it and buckle don't see it and begin to
[1:25:04] weep look you read the first chapter of
[1:25:05] job and it's absolutely astounding to me
[1:25:08] there's a key there to overcoming in
[1:25:09] your trials because it it's a messenger
[1:25:12] comes and all your ox and sheep are dead
[1:25:14] and burned and servants killed another
[1:25:16] one came camels are dead this is
[1:25:18] everything one after another after
[1:25:19] another then they came and said your
[1:25:20] children are dead and it says job fell
[1:25:23] on his face and
[1:25:25] worshiped he didn't fall in his face and
[1:25:27] say woe is me why me he didn't put on a
[1:25:30] sad face and walk around for six months
[1:25:31] so everybody would know he was depressed
[1:25:33] and say brother are you
[1:25:34] okay no the key to overcoming in the
[1:25:37] trial is he fell on his face and he
[1:25:39] worshiped he said the lord giveth the
[1:25:41] lord taketh away blessed be the name of
[1:25:44] the Lord so what I'm saying is when that
[1:25:45] trial comes and it's coming you may
[1:25:47] already be in it but look at it and say
[1:25:49] I may not can do this on my own but I've
[1:25:51] been anointed for this I've been called
[1:25:53] for this and I will overcome this I'm
[1:25:55] going to praise him in my storm I'm
[1:25:57] going to bless his name in my storm I'm
[1:25:59] going to give him my everything in the
[1:26:00] midst of the storm because I will
[1:26:03] conquer
[1:26:09] this you know Billy Sundy had also been
[1:26:13] a great baseball
[1:26:15] player and he's quoted as saying
[1:26:18] stopping at third
[1:26:20] base adds no more to the score than
[1:26:23] striking out
[1:26:26] stopping at third base adds no more to
[1:26:28] the score than striking out it doesn't
[1:26:30] matter how well you start if you fail to
[1:26:33] finish Paul said I
[1:26:36] finished henceforth a crown awaits
[1:26:39] me look we know we're at the end time
[1:26:41] and thinking about it as a track and the
[1:26:43] way they run around the track we've
[1:26:45] rounded the last curve as it were we're
[1:26:47] on the final straightaway and this is
[1:26:50] the time believe it or not in those
[1:26:51] moments that we're most likely to lose
[1:26:53] our Focus
[1:26:56] our natural human Tendencies is often to
[1:26:58] compromise our level of Excellence as
[1:27:00] time passes by we let down our guard we
[1:27:04] become Things become common to us as it
[1:27:07] were we become comfortable our calling
[1:27:10] becomes common we start to take things
[1:27:11] for granted research shows that on heavy
[1:27:14] industry projects and Military campaigns
[1:27:16] there is generally an increase in
[1:27:18] accidents and incidents towards the
[1:27:21] end this has put down to human factors
[1:27:23] such as is a loss of focus loss of
[1:27:26] leadership and a compromise a
[1:27:28] compromised team approach as
[1:27:30] distractions and sometimes
[1:27:32] disillusionment begins to creep in
[1:27:35] listen this is no time to be
[1:27:36] disillusioned this is no time to lose
[1:27:38] your focus it's no time to be distracted
[1:27:41] this is a time more than ever to be
[1:27:42] feeding on the word of God it's a time
[1:27:44] more than ever to turn your eyes away
[1:27:46] from the waves turn your eyes away from
[1:27:48] the distractions to get your family
[1:27:49] together have prayer time it's a time
[1:27:51] more than ever to have a family altar
[1:27:53] it's a Time more than ever when you come
[1:27:55] to the house of God to enter in and to
[1:27:57] worship and to praise and to give God
[1:27:59] your everything you know we say all the
[1:28:01] time that that where two or three are
[1:28:03] gathered he's there with us and I wonder
[1:28:05] sometimes truly in the depths of your
[1:28:06] soul do you believe that he's in this
[1:28:08] building right now walking up and down
[1:28:10] the aisles of this congregation because
[1:28:12] sometimes I look at people and I say if
[1:28:13] you believe it if that's how you're
[1:28:16] going to react when the literal Corporal
[1:28:18] body of the Lord Jesus is walking past
[1:28:20] you I doubt you believe it right now
[1:28:22] because we'll sit there and go
[1:28:27] amazing and you're telling me you
[1:28:29] believe the Lord Jesus is next to you
[1:28:31] you believe he's in this building I
[1:28:33] think sometimes we just take things it
[1:28:36] becomes common look I'm guilty I'm not
[1:28:38] trying to point fing I'm saying that our
[1:28:40] Humanity gets in the way of the reality
[1:28:42] that the Lord Jesus Christ is in this
[1:28:43] place that he's with you that he'll
[1:28:45] leave here with you he'll be with you on
[1:28:46] Monday he'll be with you on Tuesday and
[1:28:48] not only on Wednesday and Sunday should
[1:28:50] you praise him but your life should
[1:28:52] praise him your life should worship Him
[1:28:54] life should cry out thank you Lord Jesus
[1:28:56] for the grace in my life thank you Lord
[1:28:58] Jesus for all that you've done for me
[1:28:59] and for my family but especially when we
[1:29:02] gather together and have the opportunity
[1:29:04] let your voices ring out with all you
[1:29:06] have let your songs be from the depths
[1:29:08] of your soul let your worship come from
[1:29:11] a place of recognizing I know what I was
[1:29:14] I know what I am I know what he's done
[1:29:16] for me if he saved you you can worship
[1:29:19] if he's delivered you you can worship
[1:29:21] Hallelujah quit sitting there Bound by
[1:29:23] the weight of chains are already broken
[1:29:25] let those hands go up and praise
[1:29:27] almighty God and thank him for what he's
[1:29:29] done for
[1:29:32] you
[1:29:35] Lord let your focus get back on
[1:29:40] him he's not looking at what you can
[1:29:43] do he sees what he can do through
[1:29:47] youall and many times we're limiting him
[1:29:50] because we're saying I can't do that
[1:29:51] he's saying I know
[1:29:54] I get
[1:29:56] it he saying I want you to yield to me
[1:29:58] and let me show you what I can do with
[1:30:01] you many times we're asking Lord how can
[1:30:04] I do this Lord why me Joshua 1:9 have I
[1:30:08] not commanded thee be strong and of a
[1:30:11] good courage Be not Afraid neither be
[1:30:14] thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is
[1:30:17] with thee withs soever thou goest Isaiah
[1:30:21] 41 and10 fear not for I am with thee be
[1:30:25] not dismayed for I am thy God I will
[1:30:28] strengthen Thee I will help Thee I will
[1:30:31] uphold thee with the right hand of my
[1:30:34] righteous see God is not expecting you
[1:30:35] to do this on your own God's not
[1:30:37] dropping you here and saying good luck
[1:30:40] he said I'm going to do it I'm going to
[1:30:41] be with you I'm going to go before you
[1:30:43] I'm going to drive out the enemy I'm
[1:30:44] going to do it I'm going to do it and
[1:30:46] it's time that we just allow him to do
[1:30:47] it it's time that we just rest in the
[1:30:49] promise it's time that we just put it
[1:30:51] all in his hands say Lord I'm casting
[1:30:53] all my C on you I know you love me Lord
[1:30:56] here take this I can't handle it he says
[1:30:58] I know Child come on I'll Lead You
[1:31:00] Through the Fire I'll take you through
[1:31:01] the trial and as long as he's in front
[1:31:03] of me I'll follow him anywhere we'll go
[1:31:06] through hell but I'll come out
[1:31:07] Victorious because he has never lost a
[1:31:10] battle brother Bram said I've never seen
[1:31:12] him go into a battle once and he didn't
[1:31:14] come out packing the victory so this
[1:31:16] morning Lord I got battles I need
[1:31:18] Victory so I'm putting them on your
[1:31:19] shoulders I'm walking with you this
[1:31:21] morning you got to give it all to him
[1:31:23] though
[1:31:25] he's not expecting you to do it all on
[1:31:26] your
[1:31:28] own but he's provided every step of the
[1:31:30] way he's dropping handfuls on purpose
[1:31:34] he's giving you what it is you
[1:31:36] need but many times we think oh well
[1:31:39] only the ministers are
[1:31:42] anointed well only the singers get
[1:31:46] anointed and and you know what anointing
[1:31:48] should come on a minister anointing
[1:31:51] should come on a singer who sings in
[1:31:52] church those things are true ano should
[1:31:54] come on the musicians and church those
[1:31:56] are sting certain anointings given for
[1:31:57] the task that they are to accomplish but
[1:32:00] a Believer a Believer lives under the
[1:32:03] anointing of God they are LED of God
[1:32:06] they are strengthened of God they
[1:32:07] overcome daily by God they live under
[1:32:09] the Holy Spirit anointing of the age
[1:32:12] that they live in every believer should
[1:32:14] be walking under an anointing it's not
[1:32:16] just for preachers deacons singers so
[1:32:18] those people they have a specific
[1:32:19] anointing but you're anointed you're
[1:32:21] anointed for the task you're going to
[1:32:22] face on Monday morning you're anointed
[1:32:24] for the task you're going to face on
[1:32:25] Tuesday and the task on Thursday it's
[1:32:27] easy to feel the anointing in church but
[1:32:28] what do you do next Tuesday when you're
[1:32:29] hitting the face on all right you got to
[1:32:32] trust in that anointing and lean on it
[1:32:34] lean not to that own understanding
[1:32:35] recognize I was made for this I am
[1:32:38] anointed in this and knowing this allows
[1:32:40] us to stand firm in the face of Satan it
[1:32:43] allows many times we don't feel strong
[1:32:45] enough to do it but you need to stand
[1:32:46] Toe to Toe look him in the face that you
[1:32:47] have no right to me you have no right to
[1:32:50] me every right you ever had was broke at
[1:32:52] Calvary your back was broke at Calvary
[1:32:54] you were stripped of everything you ever
[1:32:55] had at Calvary you have no right to me
[1:32:59] and then furthermore I'm anointed it's
[1:33:01] actually a p a principle of Deliverance
[1:33:04] and it's a principle of Divine Healing
[1:33:05] the word of God tells the enemy to touch
[1:33:08] not mine anointed listen that's not
[1:33:11] talking about just preachers you are the
[1:33:14] anointed of God you're the anointed in
[1:33:16] this age and the word tells him take
[1:33:18] your hands off the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:33:20] take your hands off my people you have
[1:33:22] no right to touch them touch not my
[1:33:25] anointed there's a word that tells Satan
[1:33:27] to take his hands off it's for
[1:33:31] you well I need a quote for that got
[1:33:35] one come on and may we buckle up the
[1:33:38] armor of God just a little tighter
[1:33:39] tonight go forward in battle tomorrow
[1:33:42] where right and wrong is engaged may we
[1:33:45] not fear as we go but know that the
[1:33:48] Morning Star is shining over us and if
[1:33:51] God be for us who shall be against us
[1:33:53] for who shall touch the anointed of the
[1:33:55] Lord may that be the consolation of
[1:33:58] every believer Grant it Lord who here's
[1:34:03] a Believer who here is a Believer then
[1:34:05] you can look at the Devil this morning
[1:34:06] and say back off I'm the anointed of the
[1:34:09] Lord and you have no rights to my home
[1:34:11] my family my children my health you have
[1:34:13] no right to any of it because I've been
[1:34:15] anointed for a
[1:34:21] purpose you must recognize
[1:34:24] what you've been called for recognizing
[1:34:27] what you've been called for gives you
[1:34:28] courage in the battle it gives you faith
[1:34:30] knowing that you're where God placed you
[1:34:33] you never want to get neck deep in the
[1:34:34] middle of battle and wonder am I out of
[1:34:36] the will of
[1:34:37] God that's not a fun place to be many of
[1:34:40] us have found our place ourselves there
[1:34:42] before but when you seek his will
[1:34:44] constantly you seek his favor constantly
[1:34:46] and when you recognize when you come to
[1:34:47] a battle when you come to the Red Sea
[1:34:49] you realize because I'm following the
[1:34:51] will of God he brought me here so if he
[1:34:54] brought me to this place he's going to
[1:34:55] take me through this place because I
[1:34:57] know I'm in his favor I know I'm in his
[1:34:59] will and I know I've been called for
[1:35:01] this very moment so it's important to
[1:35:03] recognize your calling so you don't come
[1:35:04] up against a giant and go I took a wrong
[1:35:08] turn no but your command this morning is
[1:35:10] to go forward Onward Christian Soldier
[1:35:13] slay the enemy slay the giant because
[1:35:15] you're called to it recognize your
[1:35:17] calling know what you're here for
[1:35:20] brother Brown said you know you have
[1:35:21] need of it you know if you're going to
[1:35:24] take these children over to that
[1:35:25] Promised Land that's exactly you're
[1:35:27] pinned up here in a corner there ain't
[1:35:29] nothing else you can do so there's a
[1:35:31] need what are you crying to me about
[1:35:34] what are you looking at me for what are
[1:35:35] you calling on me about haven't I proved
[1:35:38] it to the people hasn't he proved
[1:35:40] himself to us hasn't he healed Our Sick

[1:35:55] call and say I had sent you to do it
[1:35:59] that it wasn't you it's me and I'd go
[1:36:01] down and I'd be with your lips and
[1:36:03] whatever you said I'd vindicate and
[1:36:05] prove it haven't I done

[1:36:14] speak to me
[1:36:16] directly you might wait a long
[1:36:20] time I'm not saying he won't
[1:36:23] but many times that's a cop out for
[1:36:25] people that don't want to
[1:36:26] move well until God speaks lip to ear to
[1:36:28] me that don't just happen every
[1:36:31] Tuesday and you got to overcome

[1:36:45] need thus sayith the
[1:36:47] Lord Brother brandom said he was
[1:36:49] anointed for the job and he was still
[1:36:51] waiting for thus sayith the Lord

[1:36:57] Don't Cry Anymore speak I sent you oh

[1:37:04] this morning with God's perfect
[1:37:05] Vindication with the pillar of fire and
[1:37:07] the signs and the Wonders everything
[1:37:09] just like it was before the days of
[1:37:10] Sodom he said he would return it back
[1:37:13] and he's telling you this morning
[1:37:14] haven't I called you for the job haven't
[1:37:16] I anointed you for the job why cry onto
[1:37:18] me this morning speak what you have need
[1:37:20] of I believe therefore I speak if you

[1:37:27] your healing is yours speak that the
[1:37:28] devil is defeated those things were
[1:37:30] given you but who's going to fight for
[1:37:32] them you arej I can't always be there to
[1:37:35] fight for your children you got to fight
[1:37:37] for it you got to fight for it and put
[1:37:39] it in the hands of God and trust in him
[1:37:41] and don't look at
[1:37:43] circumstances you talk about
[1:37:44] circumstances you know I thought about
[1:37:46] it one
[1:37:47] time the circumstances that the parents
[1:37:50] of the
[1:37:50] thief yeah
[1:37:53] and we think they're too far gone do you
[1:37:55] know what a reunion that must have been
[1:37:57] that day they thought he died a sinner
[1:38:00] he died a thief he went straight to hell
[1:38:02] but there was a time where there was a
[1:38:04] reunion went on and they said how did
[1:38:06] this happen how because there was a
[1:38:08] promise because there was a word because
[1:38:10] there was a story of a prodical that
[1:38:11] came home it didn't say he came home
[1:38:13] this time this time or this time it said
[1:38:15] they're coming home it said that th and
[1:38:17] thy house will be there so hold to that
[1:38:19] hold to that it doesn't matter what you
[1:38:21] see they never saw their son saved but
[1:38:23] he was there they never saw him
[1:38:25] delivered but he made it because he had
[1:38:28] an encounter with the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:38:30] Lord hold on to every promise those
[1:38:33] things are given for you and in this
[1:38:34] last age they're just as good as they've
[1:38:36] ever been he said
[1:38:41] it Lord he told you to speak the word he
[1:38:45] said the works that I do shall you do
[1:38:48] also you Lord we've been anointed in
[1:38:51] this last day to tear Satan's King
[1:38:53] Kingdom down and we're not finished
[1:38:56] there's work for us to do and yet we
[1:38:59] know exactly what it is we know what we
[1:39:02] have to do we know what we're called for
[1:39:04] we're not finished
[1:39:06] yet but Satan's about to be yeah his end
[1:39:11] is just before us brother brandham said
[1:39:13] Joshua was anointed to take the land for
[1:39:16] for God and for his people the day was
[1:39:18] short he needed more time for the job
[1:39:20] that he was anointed and commissioned to
[1:39:22] do
[1:39:24] he needed more light the sun was going
[1:39:26] down he didn't fall on his knees and say
[1:39:28] Lord God what shall I do what shall I do
[1:39:30] he spoke he had a need he said Son stand
[1:39:34] still he didn't cry to nothing he
[1:39:37] commanded son stand still I've got a
[1:39:39] need of this I'm the servant of the Lord
[1:39:42] anointed for this job Samson anointed
[1:39:46] raised up ordained of God given a gift
[1:39:49] of power was ordained to destroy the
[1:39:51] nation of the Philistines ordained born
[1:39:53] on the Earth anointed of God to destroy
[1:39:55] the Philistines and one day they caught
[1:39:57] him out in the field without his sword
[1:39:59] without a spear and a thousand of those
[1:40:01] armored Philistines run up himm at one
[1:40:03] time did he get down and say oh Lord I
[1:40:06] Need A

[1:40:10] now what should I do he knowed what he
[1:40:14] had need he found nothing but an old

[1:40:19] thousand Philistines amen he never cried
[1:40:21] to God he used his anointed gift he's
[1:40:25] anointed for the work and there's
[1:40:27] nothing can harm you know not one thing
[1:40:30] look you may be in the midst of the
[1:40:31] field this morning and you may be
[1:40:33] surrounded and you can't find anything
[1:40:35] but if you can just reach down and pick
[1:40:36] up one promise of God just one promise I
[1:40:39] am the Lord thy God that heals all my
[1:40:41] diseas you can go to whooping Devils

[1:41:42] matter famine didn't matter snake bite
[1:41:44] didn't matter he knew what he was called
[1:41:46] and anointed to do none of those things
[1:41:48] mattered because he was told you're
[1:41:50] going to preach in Rome you've been told
[1:41:51] by Vindicated Prophet messenger that
[1:41:53] you're going in a Rapture you've been

[1:43:09] the last lap this
[1:43:13] morning he said brother Aaron I've been
[1:43:16] running for a long
[1:43:21] time I've been running for years
[1:43:24] years I've been fighting a good
[1:43:27] fight but I'm getting
[1:43:30] tired and some of the battles that some
[1:43:32] of you face I can't even
[1:43:34] comprehend we get
[1:43:36] tired we get worn down we get
[1:43:40] scarred I just need a
[1:43:42] moment I need to stop for a minute Catch
[1:43:45] My Breath look we all get worn down and
[1:43:48] maybe I'm not near as worn down as you

[1:44:18] hard I'm in the middle of the worst try
[1:44:19] to just take another step just keep
[1:44:21] walking I think about our Lord looking
[1:44:22] up at Calvary knowing what he was going
[1:44:24] to go through but he would just take
[1:44:25] another step he'd take another he knew
[1:44:27] what was coming but for you he took
[1:44:28] another step I'm telling you this
[1:44:30] morning that anointing has come back on
[1:44:31] you he was the great finisher he said it
[1:44:33] is finished and now you have that same
[1:44:35] anointing bone of his bone bride of his

[1:44:45] on you
[1:44:48] can people who people who play sports
[1:44:52] and run and do those those things they
[1:44:54] know there's a phenomenon known as a
[1:44:55] second
[1:44:57] win scientifically a second win they
[1:45:00] would say the definition is a phenomenon
[1:45:01] in distance running such as
[1:45:04] marathons whereby an athlete who is out
[1:45:06] of breath too tired to continue suddenly
[1:45:11] finds the strength oh Lord Jesus
[1:45:13] suddenly finds the strength to press on
[1:45:15] at top performance for a longer period
[1:45:18] of time listen it didn't say he finds
[1:45:19] the strength to struggle on he finds the
[1:45:21] strength to continue at top performance
[1:45:23] just as good as he was at the beginning
[1:45:25] just as strong as he was at the
[1:45:26] beginning suddenly there's a second wind
[1:45:29] that begins to come down listen there's
[1:45:31] one filling but there's many refilling
[1:45:33] when you need a second win when you're
[1:45:35] struggling just ask for it he'll give it
[1:45:37] and then you'll be going to tend you on
[1:45:39] at top performance just like you did at
[1:45:41] the very beginning just when you begin
[1:45:43] to wear down there's a special anointing
[1:45:46] for you a time of refreshing that comes
[1:45:48] from the Lord a second win a refilling a
[1:45:51] recharging
[1:45:53] than you oh church let the wind of the
[1:45:54] Holy Spirit just blow through this place
[1:45:56] and give you the refreshing you need the
[1:45:58] recharge you need the second win you
[1:46:00] need because there's more to go there's
[1:46:02] more race to run but you're not getting
[1:46:04] a break there's nobody taking your place
[1:46:06] you got to do it you got to do it so
[1:46:08] Lord send a second win send me a
[1:46:10] refreshing send your Holy Spirit this
[1:46:12] morning thank you
[1:46:15] Lord you who are tired you who are weary

[1:46:23] thank you
[1:46:24] Lord oh my Lord the enemy closing in
[1:46:28] from every side you're
[1:46:30] surrounded he sees you struggling he
[1:46:33] sees your struggles that's why he comes
[1:46:35] at you hardest when you're
[1:46:37] struggling he sees the struggle and he
[1:46:39] begins to close in like wolves circling
[1:46:42] for a
[1:46:43] kill he sees you struggling along and he
[1:46:46] says oh I got
[1:46:48] her she's slowing down she's going to
[1:46:52] stop
[1:46:54] I got her oh look at him I got him his
[1:46:56] faith is weak he's struggling oh I got
[1:46:59] her she's gave up hope anxiety is
[1:47:01] starting to take hold he's getting
[1:47:03] closer and closer and he's creeping in
[1:47:07] but all of a sudden there comes a sound
[1:47:10] from Heaven Like A rushan Mighty Wind
[1:47:13] and that enemy is getting closer and
[1:47:14] closer and he hears that sound he says
[1:47:17] I've heard that before I've heard that
[1:47:19] sound before I know what that sound is
[1:47:22] and in a moment just like that he will
[1:47:24] scatter back when the power of the Holy
[1:47:25] Spirit comes and renews you and
[1:47:27] refreshes you because one day you're
[1:47:29] barely moving but you're moving and the

[1:48:58] morning Satan knows that this is the
[1:49:00] very end he knows that his time is short
