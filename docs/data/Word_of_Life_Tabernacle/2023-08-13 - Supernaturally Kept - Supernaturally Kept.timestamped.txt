[28:12] praise and the glory and the honor for
[28:14] it in Jesus name amen amen God bless you
[28:18] turn with me to First Peter chapter one
[28:22] First Peter chapter one we'll read
[28:24] verses three through five
[28:28] foreign
[28:33] be the God and father of our Lord Jesus
[28:36] Christ
[28:37] it's according to His abundant Mercy
[28:40] aren't you glad for His abundant Mercy
[28:41] today

[28:46] hope
[28:47] by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from
[28:50] the dead
[28:51] to an inheritance incorruptible
[28:54] undefiled and that faith not away
[28:57] reserved in heaven for you
[29:01] someone say for me
[29:03] who are kept by the power of God
[29:07] through faith unto salvation ready to be
[29:11] revealed in the last time amen I pray
[29:15] Lord that is blessing to the word you
[29:16] may be seated
[29:22] I want to speak to you this morning on a
[29:24] title of supernaturally
[29:26] kept supernaturally kept
[29:32] we live in what the Bible describes as
[29:34] perilous times don't we
[29:36] a time of trouble an hour of deception a
[29:40] a time when the 200 million demons out
[29:44] of the Euphrates River have been
[29:46] released not brother Brandon said not on
[29:48] the church world but on the bride that
[29:50] the the time when everywhere you look
[29:53] there's evil everywhere you look there's
[29:55] trouble everywhere that you look there's
[29:58] deception and and we find it's a time
[30:01] that when you uh you look at your
[30:03] children I know this is the last week in
[30:05] Arkansas before uh school starts this
[30:08] coming week and you look at your
[30:10] children you think how are they going to
[30:12] make it is there a possibility that they
[30:15] could make it and become Sons and
[30:18] Daughters of God they could be it's hard
[30:20] to even see how people could become
[30:22] normal citizens normal people in the
[30:25] world that we live in because
[30:26] everything's so dark and yet we don't
[30:29] need to look at things through the
[30:32] darkness or just the way that they are
[30:33] but Christians look by faith and she by
[30:36] Faith they see something else Moses did
[30:40] not see the the bondage of the people
[30:41] but he saw what God was going to do he
[30:44] saw Deliverance coming and we've got to
[30:46] by faith be able to see that there's
[30:48] Deliverance coming there there's
[30:50] something we've been given a message for
[30:52] a reason in the hour that we live in
[30:55] so now you find when Peter wrote these
[30:59] words that he said you're kept by the
[31:01] power of God the early church that Peter
[31:04] wrote to they also faced perilous times
[31:07] and it was a time of a physical
[31:10] persecution but it was also a time of
[31:13] that white horse rider in the first seal
[31:15] when he wrote out and he he deceived the
[31:17] people and there was an antichrist
[31:19] Spirit at work during that time that was
[31:22] working among the people to try to make
[31:24] them not believe the word and disbelieve
[31:27] the word or or begin to cool off as as
[31:30] it was put in the Ephesian Church age to
[31:32] lose their first love
[31:34] and so it was a perilous time it was a
[31:36] hard time to be a Christian just like it
[31:39] is today but Peter speaks to those
[31:41] people and speaks to us as well when he
[31:44] says we are kept by the power of God
[31:48] we are kept now that word kept actually
[31:50] in the original is to be a Watcher in
[31:53] advance to to mount guard as a sentinel
[31:56] to post spies at the gates Amen to him
[32:00] in to protect or to keep with the
[32:02] Garrison so if a if an army would come
[32:05] through and Conquer a city they would
[32:07] leave a Garrison or they would send to
[32:08] Garrison they would send enough soldiers
[32:10] to keep the city from Attack they would
[32:13] send they would send an army there to
[32:16] keep the city and their job will simply
[32:18] not to go out and Conquer more but to
[32:20] keep what was already there and so he
[32:22] said you are kept by the power of God
[32:25] you are garrisoned by the power of God
[32:28] you are garrisoned Supernatural and I
[32:31] hope we can see today beyond the beyond
[32:34] the limitations of Flesh beyond the
[32:36] limitations of how my kids are going to
[32:38] be able to survive how they're going to
[32:40] make it if you could go with your
[32:41] children to the public schools and you'd
[32:44] walk through the halls of the school
[32:45] sometimes when if you could see what
[32:47] they go through every day maybe it'd
[32:49] make you not even want to send them and
[32:50] I know we have something at home school
[32:52] and some that send their kids to public
[32:54] school we've done both with our kids and
[32:56] and as you begin to see that you begin
[32:58] to be reluctant even to let them go out
[33:00] in public because it's such a horrible
[33:02] thing that they have to go through but
[33:04] whether you're there or not they are
[33:06] supernaturally kept by the power of God
[33:08] we need to understand that today our
[33:11] children are not just giving up to the
[33:13] world we don't just let them go and do
[33:15] what they want to do but they're
[33:17] supernaturally kept by the same power
[33:19] that keeps you
[33:21] oh we need to believe that today
[33:25] so now
[33:26] we're we're garrisoned or shielded
[33:29] by the power of God
[33:32] through faith
[33:34] unto salvation
[33:36] Philippians 4 and 7 uses the same word
[33:39] kept or keep when it says the peace of
[33:42] God
[33:43] how many believe in the peace of God
[33:46] today that passeth all understanding
[33:49] shall keep
[33:51] Garrison protect your hearts and minds
[33:56] and Minds
[33:57] through Christ Jesus
[33:59] you may feel like you're going crazy you
[34:02] may feel like everything you may be I
[34:04] know moms sometimes at home you feel
[34:06] like you're going crazy you feel like
[34:08] nothing is working out like the way you
[34:10] want it to work out and you're standing
[34:11] there in your kids maybe maybe even if
[34:13] your kids are older and they begin to go
[34:15] their own way and you begin to look at
[34:16] them and say there's no way it'll ever
[34:17] work but he's going to keep your peace
[34:19] he's going to keep your heart he's going
[34:21] to keep your mind
[34:23] he promised to do that right
[34:25] he keeps our hearts and our minds
[34:28] through Christ Jesus
[34:30] and the Bible tells us that we are
[34:31] protected
[34:33] and it tells us what we are protected by
[34:35] we are protected by angels
[34:39] how many believe that today
[34:41] we are protected by Angels see these are
[34:44] real things it's not just something we
[34:46] say
[34:47] but we believe we're protected from an
[34:49] unseen Realm by Angels the Bible says in
[34:52] Psalms 34 7 the angel of the Lord
[34:55] encampeth round about them that fear Him
[34:58] in other words they Garrison around the
[35:00] person that fears God
[35:02] and delivereth them
[35:05] so brother Brown says this about that
[35:07] scripture he said and God is always
[35:09] present
[35:11] if we could only remember that
[35:14] oh church if we could I would make our
[35:16] lives different it would make our church
[35:18] services different it would make our the
[35:20] way we talk to one another different if
[35:22] we recognize brother Joe that that God
[35:25] is always present
[35:27] if we could only remember that the
[35:29] angels of the Lord are encamped about
[35:31] those who fear Him
[35:33] that in this building tonight stands
[35:36] Jesus Christ
[35:37] in this building tonight is hosts of
[35:40] angels
[35:42] oh God if you can only see we've
[35:44] preached about it before but he said if
[35:46] you can see beyond the veil of Flesh you
[35:48] see Angels standing at their positions
[35:50] not just in this church but wherever you
[35:52] go they go with you
[35:57] come on Sir host of angels thousands of
[36:00] them
[36:02] gathered around
[36:04] Hallelujah now what did that what did
[36:07] Elisha say to the to his servant when he
[36:11] was worried he said he said how are we
[36:12] going to make it here the Syrian Army
[36:14] has come up against us and Elijah said
[36:16] there's more with us and be with them
[36:18] and he said I I don't understand that
[36:21] statement and he said Lord open his eyes
[36:23] and he began to see the hills were full
[36:25] of Chariots of Fire and Horses of fire
[36:28] you don't realize what's working for you
[36:30] there's a supernatural realm out there
[36:32] host of angels surrounding you
[36:36] oh my
[36:38] God I would be a worried individual
[36:40] it wasn't for the protection of God
[36:43] be a scared man
[36:45] if it wasn't for the protection of God
[36:47] not only for my children but for myself
[36:50] for my wife for the church
[36:54] but I believe in God's Supernatural
[36:56] keeping
[36:59] so now
[37:00] brother Brian said you don't see them
[37:01] but you can feel
[37:03] I love this people say well it's not
[37:05] about feelings but I'm glad he lets us
[37:07] feel
[37:10] aren't you glad it's not about feelings
[37:12] your life is not about feelings you
[37:14] don't make you don't make a decision to
[37:16] be married Based On A Feeling
[37:18] but I'm glad there is a Feeling
[37:21] makes it a little more tolerable
[37:27] right
[37:29] aren't you glad there's a little brother
[37:30] tells a story about the man that left
[37:32] his home and and his wife had a little
[37:34] spat and she stood by the door and he
[37:35] kissed her and and she kissed him and
[37:37] they went he went out down the road and
[37:39] something was wrong
[37:40] he said he he didn't understand it and
[37:42] and so he stopped he went back and he
[37:44] said they apologized to one another for
[37:46] those fact that went on and he kissed
[37:48] her again she kissed him again same as
[37:49] they did before but he said this time it
[37:51] was feeling in it
[37:53] and so we need feeling in our services
[37:55] yeah
[37:57] that's part of it we're human beings
[37:59] that's not what we base our faith on but
[38:02] we can feel god brother Brown said you
[38:04] can feel these this Angelic presence
[38:06] we preached about it with the pillar of
[38:08] fire he said you you it's like a man
[38:10] that couldn't see he said couldn't see
[38:12] the sun if he was blind but he could
[38:13] still feel the warmth of it you can
[38:15] still feel the warmth of the presence of
[38:17] God you can feel the influence of angels
[38:20] if they're telling you that they're here
[38:22] yeah he said if that isn't so then the
[38:24] scripture isn't so if the scripture
[38:26] isn't right then God isn't right the
[38:27] Bible said the angels of God are in Camp
[38:29] they don't leave they stay near those
[38:32] that fear Him
[38:34] Jesus said wherever two or three are
[38:35] gathered in my name I'll be in their
[38:38] midst and that makes him in a world that
[38:40] we cannot see that our five senses
[38:43] doesn't contact Jesus Christ is here
[38:46] present he said if we could be conscious
[38:49] of that
[38:50] he said remember not only here but when
[38:53] you're walking down the street
[38:55] wherever you are you that profess to be
[38:58] Believers and fear the Lord amen he said
[39:01] Remember the angels of God are moving
[39:04] with you wherever you are they watch
[39:07] everything you do
[39:09] every thought that goes through your
[39:11] mind
[39:12] and they know all about you he said
[39:15] therefore we must be conscious of that
[39:18] he said if we're not conscious of it
[39:20] then you act anyway
[39:23] oh God so people mostly today too many
[39:27] people are not conscious of the presence
[39:29] of the Lord Jesus he said that's the
[39:31] reason they we have these things that we
[39:34] have going on now that's not right yeah
[39:37] but David said he said I'll set the lord
[39:39] always before me someone say always I
[39:42] have set the lord always before me
[39:44] because he is at my right hand I shall
[39:47] not be moved
[39:49] everything I do he said it's in his
[39:52] presence he's always before me some of
[39:55] you drove a long ways to get to church
[39:56] but because you set the lord always
[39:58] before you God kept you safe getting
[40:00] here aren't you glad for that today he
[40:02] kept you safe just get that's something
[40:04] we ought to thank God for he kept you
[40:06] down through your life you can look back
[40:07] and see moments when supernaturally you
[40:10] were kept by the power of God
[40:12] in Psalm 91 10 he said there shall no
[40:15] evil befall thee
[40:17] neither shall any plague come not thy
[40:19] dwelling
[40:20] you can say what you want to I'm gonna
[40:21] claim that promise for myself
[40:24] for he shall give his angels charge over
[40:26] thee to keep you in all thy ways they
[40:28] shall bear the up in their hands lest
[40:31] thou Dash thy foot
[40:32] against the stone now I want to dig in a
[40:35] little deeper this morning so we
[40:36] understand what our responsibilities are
[40:39] as we as our supernaturally kept by his
[40:43] presence
[40:44] now you remember if you were here last
[40:47] week you remember that I preached and I
[40:49] used this during my sermon as the part
[40:52] where they shall bear the up in their
[40:54] hands let's sell Dash thy foot against
[40:56] the stone it's where Satan comes and
[40:58] quotes this scripture to Jesus you
[41:01] remember yeah and he quotes it to him
[41:05] and we find that he wants him to uh to
[41:08] uh do something to show off
[41:11] and to actually let go and just uh and
[41:15] just give himself over to the elements
[41:18] so then that the Angels would bear him
[41:21] up
[41:22] and and you know if you look at this
[41:23] promise and you look at how being
[41:25] Supernatural he kept you might say well
[41:27] brother Ben that means that well I don't
[41:29] have to worry about my children well
[41:30] that is true because worry is sin
[41:34] all right so we don't need to worry
[41:35] about our children but say well you know
[41:38] really it doesn't matter who they go
[41:39] around it doesn't matter what church
[41:40] they go to it doesn't matter because I'm
[41:42] supernaturally captive but you realize
[41:45] that was Satan's view of that scripture
[41:47] that no matter what Jesus did he would
[41:51] still be kept
[41:53] right
[41:54] but Jesus being the word
[41:57] stood there and spoke the word and said
[42:00] you that's what I tempt the Lord thy God
[42:02] so
[42:03] you say well this makes it easy when it
[42:06] comes to my children I'll just let them
[42:08] chart their own path
[42:09] and then when they get older God's going
[42:12] to keep them anyway but now watch watch
[42:14] what the promises are now you might say
[42:17] well if angels are always surrounding
[42:18] them why should I worry about them let
[42:20] them just be like the other kids they've
[42:22] been baptized after all it's in church
[42:25] everything's okay
[42:26] and I'll say this if you have that
[42:28] attitude I hope you never have children
[42:34] let them do what they want to hell yeah
[42:37] I remember what I wanted to do as a kid
[42:40] I can't let myself just do what I want
[42:42] to
[42:44] none of us can't because we're human
[42:47] beings
[42:48] so so now we have a responsibility to be
[42:52] supernaturally kept and we're going to
[42:55] talk about it some more there's a
[42:56] responsibility that we have to remain
[42:59] behind the word of God now
[43:00] now we looked at this last week again
[43:03] let's just read it again Matthew 4 5
[43:05] then the devil takes him up into the
[43:07] holy city said to them on a pinnacle of
[43:09] the temple and saith in him if thou be
[43:11] the Son of God cast thyself down but the
[43:13] man who said he knew that the Son of God
[43:15] was coming but he couldn't see that
[43:18] flesh being the son of God
[43:20] so he could recognize the Son of God but
[43:23] not the son of man
[43:25] right and many people are having that
[43:27] same problem today that's why they can't
[43:29] see the message of the hour because the
[43:30] message is hidden brother Steward behind
[43:32] flesh
[43:33] Veil behind flesh
[43:36] so now he said he he said just let go
[43:39] he says if that'll be the Son of God
[43:42] he'll give his angels charge concerning
[43:44] in their hands they shall bear thee up
[43:46] Lester anytime thou Dash thy foot
[43:47] against the stone just let go do what
[43:49] you want regardless what the word says
[43:52] but Jesus said unto him it is written
[43:54] again
[43:56] Thou shalt not tempt
[43:58] the Lord thy God
[44:00] and brother Brandon says that's where he
[44:02] calls himself God
[44:04] thou shall not tempt the Lord thy God
[44:06] now we want to be born of his Spirit
[44:09] brother Brandon says and recognize and
[44:12] watch for him so if he's always around
[44:14] us we want to be born of his Spirit
[44:16] recognize and watch for him he said he's
[44:19] so close to you he's not only close to
[44:22] you you born-again people he's already
[44:24] in you trying to will he said in the
[44:26] devil's standing there saying don't
[44:28] believe it
[44:29] don't believe it don't believe this it
[44:32] ain't for you it's not for another day
[44:35] he said oh say get thee behind me Satan
[44:38] it is written The Works that I do so you
[44:41] do also
[44:43] he said that's what Jesus defeated Satan
[44:45] he never used his power he was God
[44:48] manifested In the Flesh but he didn't
[44:50] use his power all the gifts I love this
[44:53] all the gifts he said brother Ben I have
[44:55] a gift but he had all the gifts all the
[44:59] gifts that there was in heaven he had
[45:00] them in him but he didn't use that he
[45:03] just took the father's word
[45:05] we have that same word the weakest
[45:07] Christian as an access to that same word
[45:10] today
[45:13] the least gifted person in the group
[45:16] has access to the word of God
[45:19] amen so now Jesus defeated Satan now you
[45:24] think they took the father's word he
[45:26] said it's written Thou shalt Worship the
[45:27] Lord thy God it is written it is written
[45:29] it's written it's written and he
[45:31] defeated Satan and the word of God will
[45:33] defeat Satan listen anywhere
[45:36] on any grounds
[45:39] at home or at school
[45:42] right at the church or on the job
[45:47] you believe it today
[45:51] oh God and God help you if your job is
[45:53] the school but Justin
[45:55] but he's even there
[45:58] isn't that right
[46:00] he's even there that when we think that
[46:02] we can't but again when we think that
[46:04] well there's nothing I can do to help
[46:06] these children it's everything's against
[46:08] me I'm surrounded by by a secular world
[46:11] but in that moment you can stand there
[46:13] and say I have a God who promised to be
[46:15] with me I am supernaturally kept and the
[46:18] word of God will defeat Satan on any
[46:20] ground under any conditions and laodicea
[46:25] in the darkest time that there's ever
[46:27] been the word of God still defeats the
[46:29] Enemy No matter how old you get no
[46:31] matter how bad your body gets I don't
[46:33] know whether JT wants to be here this
[46:34] morning but he's home probably watching
[46:36] but brother JC no matter how bad it gets
[46:38] see he's still with you
[46:41] the word of God still defeats Satan on
[46:44] any grounds under anything no matter
[46:46] what the doctor said no matter what the
[46:49] people said
[46:51] yes
[46:52] yes sir Hopper I just hope we can feed
[46:55] on that word this morning
[46:59] Hallelujah
[47:01] let's go back to what Peter said
[47:04] who
[47:05] watch who
[47:07] and that's important who
[47:10] somebody's kept by the power of God who
[47:11] is that that's the elect children of God
[47:14] has been born again by the spirit of God
[47:16] yes you can't make yourself a child of
[47:19] God
[47:20] you were always were
[47:22] all right if you weren't always a child
[47:24] of God you can't get blood out of a
[47:25] turnip yeah but you are a child of God
[47:28] because you always were a child of God
[47:29] that's what the Bible teaches now we are
[47:32] kept who who Who's kept the elect child
[47:36] of God who has been born again by the
[47:38] spirit of God
[47:40] now watch
[47:41] by one spirit this is where brother
[47:43] random always takes us back to the new
[47:45] birth but one Spirit we are baptized
[47:47] into one body
[47:49] so this is the body that's kept it's the
[47:52] body of Christ whether we be Bond or
[47:54] free have been all been made to drink
[47:55] into one spirit and and so we can say if
[48:00] you are filled with the Holy Ghost if
[48:02] you have the token the true Holy Ghost
[48:04] for the hour that you live in he said
[48:06] brother Ben how do I know that I have it
[48:09] that I'm eligible for this kind of
[48:11] protection all right
[48:13] well because the Holy Ghost brother
[48:15] Brown said it's the action in you
[48:18] the Holy Ghost is the action in you
[48:21] it's a life not an emotion not some sort
[48:25] of a fleshly evidence
[48:27] but it is a person
[48:29] I love that
[48:31] Jesus Christ the word of God establish
[48:35] oh I love it the word of God is
[48:37] established in your heart
[48:40] to Quicken every word of this age
[48:44] what a definition
[48:47] Hallelujah to Quicken everywhere they
[48:49] said watch the Holy Ghost In Action he
[48:52] said not so much in demonstrations but
[48:55] in action what it does according to the
[49:00] word so if you're born again you will
[49:02] not willfully cross over the word you
[49:05] can't do it
[49:06] you can't do it you may fall you may
[49:08] fail there may be all kinds of problems
[49:10] in your life but you will not see the
[49:12] word of God and to be plain before you
[49:14] and walk over that if you do that it
[49:17] don't mean you can't be saved it means
[49:18] you need to be saved
[49:22] now we are kept
[49:25] the spiritual power of God
[49:27] So This Promise is for us
[49:29] trusting that we've all come to Christ
[49:31] and we've been filled with the Holy
[49:32] Ghost if you haven't now's the time to
[49:34] do it
[49:36] and but trusting that we have brother
[49:38] bear said would you like to join he said
[49:40] the only way you can join is be born
[49:42] he said now the great thing is open here
[49:44] the altar of God there's room at the
[49:46] fountain any man in here would like to
[49:49] join these ranks this afternoon that
[49:51] listen that will lay aside every Creed
[49:52] that's contrary to the Bible every
[49:55] thought that's contrary to the Bible
[49:56] every Doctrine that's contrary to the
[49:59] Bible and with faith walk up here and
[50:00] say I accept Jesus Christ upon the basis
[50:03] of his shed blood and his word amen
[50:06] that's how you change that's how you're
[50:08] saved not because you say well this is
[50:10] right or that is right but I believe the
[50:12] word of God and I'm coming and claiming
[50:14] it for myself
[50:16] not because some emotion but because I
[50:18] walk by faith and I believe I accept
[50:20] Jesus Christ
[50:22] the basis of his shed blood in his word
[50:24] I tell you something will happen to you
[50:26] right here and you'll be fortified with
[50:28] the power of the Holy Ghost
[50:31] you might say brother Ben I thought we
[50:33] were fortified by the word we are
[50:36] the Holy Ghost is the person of Jesus
[50:37] Christ which is the word
[50:40] and it is the moving of the holy spirit
[50:42] that fortifies us behind the word
[50:46] and watch when the spirit of Truth has
[50:48] come he will guide you into all truth
[50:51] right so it's all it's impossible to
[50:54] please God without faith it's impossible
[50:56] to please God without the Holy Ghost
[50:58] right so now he shall not speak of
[51:01] himself but whatsoever he shall hear
[51:02] that shall he speak he will show you
[51:04] things to come
[51:05] mother Brown said it this way said come
[51:07] in and take a taste of the original
[51:08] Manna the kind that fell on the day of
[51:11] Pentecost that's the kind I wanted
[51:13] that's the kind you want the Manna for
[51:15] the church the Holy Ghost the armor what
[51:17] we're fortified not with intellectual
[51:19] education doctors degree but we are
[51:22] fortified with the baptism of the Holy
[51:24] Ghost to prove the word of God is the
[51:26] truth so it's got to be more than just
[51:29] dead letter let her kill it but the
[51:31] spirit giveth life but it's actually the
[51:33] holy ghost that fortifies us behind the
[51:35] word
[51:37] good yes sir amen can we see it this
[51:39] morning
[51:41] oh this is why a prophet told us he said
[51:43] you pray for Revelation more than
[51:44] anything else
[51:48] oh my
[51:50] now
[51:52] Revelation more than had knowledge yeah
[51:55] yeah right and you need head knowledge
[51:56] you need to understand the things of God
[51:57] but you need revelation of the things of
[51:59] God because then that applies to your
[52:01] life
[52:03] so you
[52:05] again now he said you're kept now look
[52:08] at that again if you've got your Bible
[52:09] still open first Peter look
[52:13] you're kept who that's us
[52:16] all right we've been born again
[52:19] we've been Hallelujah we've been brought
[52:21] into the kingdom of God we've we've
[52:23] changed kingdoms yeah
[52:25] yeah right and we've been translated
[52:27] into the kingdom of God
[52:29] now that's us now we are kept by the
[52:32] power of God that's the Holy Ghost
[52:34] through faith yes
[52:37] now watch this
[52:39] this is not only saying
[52:41] I believe take it to the kids because
[52:44] we're we've talked about them I know
[52:45] they're on your mind this morning
[52:46] because of school coming up you say well
[52:49] I believe my kids will be okay
[52:51] right that's a certain element of Faith
[52:53] to that
[52:55] to say that but that alone is not enough
[52:59] right we are kept by the power of God
[53:01] through faith but faith is not just a
[53:06] saying
[53:07] faith is an action
[53:10] now listen if you believe apply the
[53:13] token
[53:15] if you believe get in the ark
[53:18] right Hebrews 11 7 by faith Noah being
[53:21] warned of God of things not seen as yet
[53:23] moved with fear
[53:26] oh my prepared an ark to the saving of
[53:30] his house
[53:31] by the which he condemned the world
[53:33] and became heir of the righteousness
[53:35] which is by faith
[53:37] brother Brown said one day one Noah was
[53:39] out in the field maybe fixing his crop
[53:40] God appeared to him and told him make
[53:43] ready for the saving of your household
[53:44] and build an ark it's gonna rain now he
[53:48] said scientists could prove there was no
[53:49] water up there but Noah could say God
[53:52] said that it would rain and that settles
[53:54] it God said so 120 years he was
[53:57] persistent in the face of the scientific
[53:59] world of his day still claiming his
[54:01] message was right because it comes from
[54:03] God brother man how long will you claim
[54:05] this message is Right till the day I die
[54:07] or go in a Rapture why because it's the
[54:09] truth it doesn't need to be Vindicated
[54:11] by Me by anybody else it's already been
[54:13] Vindicated sure it's the word of God
[54:18] and so Noah had a word from the Lord a
[54:20] message and told him build an ark and
[54:23] then when it was built to go into the
[54:25] ark
[54:26] he had a goal to make
[54:28] he had a message to take care of he was
[54:31] persistent in doing so no matter what
[54:34] the rest of the world said no I heard
[54:36] from God that's all that matters
[54:38] he had heard the voice he was sure it
[54:41] was God
[54:43] what's your attitude towards the message
[54:44] of the hour today I challenge you on it
[54:47] what is your attitude it'll determine
[54:48] what you do
[54:50] can you have the faith like Noah did to
[54:53] say this Ark is my art this message is
[54:56] my message I'm going to get into it I'm
[54:58] going to walk into it
[55:00] I'm going to be a part of it
[55:04] no matter what the rest of the world
[55:06] said no I heard from God it's all that
[55:08] mattered to him he'd heard the voice
[55:10] Hallelujah he was sure it was God and he
[55:13] was making ready something that very
[55:15] seemed very silly to the world yet Noah
[55:17] knew that God would keep his word
[55:19] should that not be a lesson for us today
[55:21] the hour if Jesus said as it was in the
[55:24] days of Noah so shall it be at the
[55:26] coming of the son of man a message
[55:27] that's silly to the world they don't
[55:29] understand it but yet those who contact
[55:31] with the Holy Spirit knows that he will
[55:33] return again he said I can see the
[55:35] people as they poor old Noah about how
[55:37] much fun he was missing
[55:38] yeah come on church I know I know you
[55:41] endure persecution I know because I do
[55:43] too I know that people laugh and make
[55:45] fun of the message I know what they say
[55:47] about our women I know what they say
[55:48] about our young people I know what they
[55:50] say about our church services yeah
[55:52] I know what they say about a bunch of
[55:53] Pentecostal a bunch of people that a
[55:55] bunch of people don't know anything
[55:56] ignorance I know what they say much
[55:58] occult followers but I know the message
[56:00] is true
[56:01] it may be stupid to the world but I've
[56:03] contacted the Holy Spirit
[56:05] I know he will return again
[56:08] to the people pitted portal know about
[56:09] how much fun he was missing of the world
[56:11] and the things that's going on but no
[56:12] one still persisted held right on
[56:15] one day God said to know all right
[56:16] you've done your part now now coming to
[56:18] the ark
[56:20] Lord of God don't you that's the hour
[56:22] that we're living in
[56:23] you've done your part and the message
[56:25] has been built the ark is there I don't
[56:27] have to add to it or take away from it I
[56:29] can walk into it
[56:30] that's the hour I'm living in now my
[56:33] action of faith is to walk into the ark
[56:41] Stewart
[56:44] you're gonna have to preach tonight
[56:45] buddy clean all this up
[56:49] we're gonna dig just a little bit more
[56:52] huh
[56:53] his family was kept you want your family
[56:56] to be kept
[57:00] I hope you're hearing me today
[57:02] we want our families to be kept
[57:03] sometimes it's just simple obedience to
[57:05] the word of God brother man said full
[57:07] obedience to the entire word of God
[57:09] entitles you to the Token yeah
[57:14] so now now I I've done the the ark's
[57:17] been built it's time to go in
[57:19] it's time to go in
[57:21] Paul or Paul continues on in Hebrews 11.
[57:23] he said by faith Moses when he was born
[57:26] was hid three months of his parents
[57:28] because they saw he was a proper child
[57:30] they were not afraid of the king's
[57:32] commandment
[57:34] oh my now watch it's a little bit
[57:36] different scenario because he was so
[57:38] young that his parents Faith had to
[57:41] stand for his
[57:43] oh my some of us have little children
[57:45] it's our faith that keeps them until
[57:49] they're old enough to have their own
[57:50] faith
[57:51] someone said if you don't have any
[57:52] convictions borrow some of mine until
[57:54] you get some
[57:55] right if you don't have any Holy Ghost
[57:58] I'll let you borrow mine in fact I
[58:01] insist
[58:02] because in my house we have the token on
[58:04] display in my house the word of God it's
[58:06] it's preeminent in my house we go to
[58:08] church in my house we serve God we do
[58:10] what God Said
[58:12] why because it's not my house I'm not
[58:14] the ultimate head why can't I be a
[58:16] strong leader as a husband because I'm
[58:18] not the ultimate head the word of God is
[58:20] above me
[58:26] pulled that all the way up
[58:32] we're in this vessel you can't see that
[58:34] I've grown
[58:40] it was supernaturally kept through the
[58:43] faith of experience do you believe your
[58:44] children
[58:45] doesn't that give you hope and strength
[58:46] courage
[58:47] and be kept through the faith of their
[58:49] parents
[58:50] they put this little baby in the ark and
[58:52] pushed him out perhaps that I could hear
[58:54] God say Gabriel come here a minute all
[58:55] right
[58:56] call Ten Thousand Angels on marching
[58:59] orders line them all up and down the
[59:01] Nile
[59:02] you see that not any crocodile comes
[59:04] near that when it gets into a Whirlpool
[59:07] see that it gets out all right
[59:11] apples in this life my brother but if
[59:13] God has called angels on marching orders
[59:15] to take care of you don't worry he'll
[59:18] get you out of it
[59:19] you just stay in the program of God you
[59:22] believe for your children sometimes you
[59:23] got to let them go
[59:24] sometimes you gotta let them go to
[59:26] school sometimes you got to let them go
[59:28] to work sometimes you just got to let
[59:29] them go period commit them to God let
[59:32] God have his way
[59:35] but first you've done all you can do
[59:38] right so you're not standing there
[59:39] trying to take a shortcut like taking
[59:41] off for Jesus
[59:43] but you've trained them right the Bible
[59:45] said train up a child and the way he
[59:46] should go when he's old he will not
[59:49] depart from it
[59:51] but the random says oh your family is
[59:52] what you are you raised your child in a
[59:55] certain environment it's got a 98 better
[59:57] chance to go right
[59:59] than it has if you bring it up in the
[1:00:01] wrong way I'm just stupid enough I guess
[1:00:03] you'd call whatever you want to do
[1:00:04] believe what a prophet of God said
[1:00:07] he said if I raise my children right I
[1:00:10] got a 98 chance all right that it stays
[1:00:13] off of drugs a 98 better chance you
[1:00:17] recognize the devil can still get a hold
[1:00:18] of people but I got a 98 better chance
[1:00:21] instead of stays out of the bar I got a
[1:00:23] 98 better chance you show me somebody
[1:00:25] who makes the word preeminent show me a
[1:00:27] church that makes the word preeminent
[1:00:29] show me a family that makes the word
[1:00:30] preeminent their kids aren't running out
[1:00:32] somewhere running all over the place but
[1:00:33] their children are kept by the power of
[1:00:36] God
[1:00:37] he said brother Ben my kid's already
[1:00:38] raised and many of them are gone but
[1:00:40] you've got to promise if you did it
[1:00:42] right they'll come back
[1:00:45] and even in your mistakes and things if
[1:00:47] you do what you've follow the word
[1:00:49] that's what we have to do
[1:00:52] stay in the program of God you'll make
[1:00:53] mistakes
[1:00:54] it's part of being a parent
[1:00:56] but stay in the program of God
[1:01:01] said bring up a child the way you should
[1:01:03] go
[1:01:04] he said and when it's old he went out
[1:01:05] depart from be brought up right teach
[1:01:07] your children to do right to be honest
[1:01:09] to be square and fair even when they're
[1:01:11] in school
[1:01:14] don't teach your children to fall
[1:01:18] well kids what I did is when I got in a
[1:01:20] tight spot I just went against the word
[1:01:21] and stayed home for a while and and then
[1:01:23] everything turned out all right
[1:01:25] the mercy of God
[1:01:28] was great for you
[1:01:30] but don't teach your kids to fall
[1:01:33] don't put them up on the Pinnacle of the
[1:01:35] temple and shove them off and say well
[1:01:36] God said he'd keep charge of you
[1:01:39] you want to date that worldly kid God
[1:01:41] said he'd keep charge of you just push
[1:01:42] him off
[1:01:47] you wanna you wanna wear them clothes
[1:01:49] God said you keep trying to just push
[1:01:51] them off
[1:01:52] see but if we stay by the message I'm
[1:01:54] not asking you to adopt my sensibilities
[1:01:56] I'm asking you to go to the message of
[1:01:58] the hour find out what God said listen
[1:02:00] to what God Said read what God Said go
[1:02:02] to the Bible find out raise your family
[1:02:04] that way stay in the word yeah when you
[1:02:07] do they'll have a 98 better chance
[1:02:16] oh my
[1:02:17] God I love this now we're going to
[1:02:18] change gears just a little bit can we do
[1:02:20] that for just a few minutes
[1:02:22] see we don't teach our children to fall
[1:02:24] he said well David found Grace yes but
[1:02:26] his family was destroyed
[1:02:29] yeah it's good
[1:02:32] we aren't home yet
[1:02:34] aren't you glad for that
[1:02:36] he said well I wish I was home but that
[1:02:39] means he's still working on us yeah yeah
[1:02:41] we still got opportunity to be better
[1:02:43] yes
[1:02:45] yes we're still waiting now he said unto
[1:02:48] salvation he said brother Ben I'm
[1:02:49] already saved yes you are you're you are
[1:02:52] saved you're being saved and you will be
[1:02:55] saved
[1:02:56] you know what's not saved about us this
[1:03:01] and it never will be it's what has to be
[1:03:03] changed
[1:03:04] right right but it's called our
[1:03:06] Salvation so what Paul is speaking of is
[1:03:08] not the salvation of your soul but the
[1:03:10] salvation of your body
[1:03:12] that there is there is oh my that you
[1:03:15] are kept
[1:03:17] supernaturally kept by the power of God
[1:03:19] by faith
[1:03:21] through through faith unto salvation
[1:03:26] right now watch
[1:03:27] Paul talks about that in Romans chapter
[1:03:29] 8. he says I reckon that the sufferings
[1:03:32] of this present time are not worthy to
[1:03:35] be compared with the glory which shall
[1:03:37] be revealed in US
[1:03:39] someday I'll know as I am known
[1:03:42] someday I won't make these mistakes
[1:03:45] someday things will be better
[1:03:47] someday the knots should have tied in
[1:03:50] life will be untied
[1:03:52] the longer I live but control the more
[1:03:54] grateful I am for the for the promise of
[1:03:56] God someday
[1:03:59] the glory revealed in me
[1:04:03] but now look where we live look at the
[1:04:05] time we live in we're so close to that
[1:04:08] and look for the earnest expectation of
[1:04:10] the creature or the creation waited for
[1:04:13] the manifestation of the sons of God
[1:04:15] not the Son of God but the sons of God
[1:04:19] for the creature was made subject to
[1:04:21] vanity not willingly but by reason of
[1:04:24] him who has subjected the same in Hope
[1:04:26] or expectation
[1:04:27] because the creature the creation itself
[1:04:30] also shall be delivered from the bondage
[1:04:33] of corruption into the Glorious Liberty
[1:04:36] of the children of God I love that
[1:04:39] for we know Paul calls our bodies
[1:04:42] bondage we spend so much time taking
[1:04:44] care of them don't we but you're in the
[1:04:47] bondage of corruption that's why the
[1:04:49] doctor does things to you makes you hurt
[1:04:51] that's why if you go through things that
[1:04:52] are hard that are tough and as you get
[1:04:54] older your body starts it's a bondage of
[1:04:56] corruption
[1:04:57] you can't undo it but one day
[1:05:00] in a moment in a twinkling of an eye
[1:05:03] it'll be reversed
[1:05:06] think about that for a minute
[1:05:09] now
[1:05:11] we know the whole creation growneth and
[1:05:14] travaileth in pain together until now
[1:05:19] not only they but ourselves also which
[1:05:22] have the first fruits of the spirit
[1:05:25] in other words we have the token the
[1:05:27] Holy Ghost
[1:05:28] even we ourselves grown within ourselves
[1:05:32] waiting for the adoption to wit the
[1:05:36] Redemption of our body
[1:05:38] for we are saved by hope but hope that
[1:05:41] is seen is not hope for what a man seeth
[1:05:45] what does he yet hope for
[1:05:47] but if we hope for that we've seen all
[1:05:49] this hope is expectation scripturally
[1:05:51] that we see not then do we with patience
[1:05:53] wait for it likewise the spirit also
[1:05:55] helpeth our infirmities for we know not
[1:05:58] what we should pray for as we ought but
[1:06:00] the spirit itself maketh intercession
[1:06:02] for us with groanings which cannot be
[1:06:04] uttered and he that searcheth the hearts
[1:06:06] knoweth what is the mind of the spirit
[1:06:08] because he maketh intercession for us
[1:06:10] according for the Saints according to
[1:06:11] the will of God and we know someone say
[1:06:14] we know
[1:06:15] we know so he's talking about the
[1:06:17] Deliverance of the body into the
[1:06:20] Glorious Liberty of the children of God
[1:06:22] and and looking at the big picture we
[1:06:25] know that all things
[1:06:27] someone say all things
[1:06:29] it's everything that's ever happened to
[1:06:31] you yeah
[1:06:32] work together now he doesn't say all
[1:06:34] things are good
[1:06:36] or that you didn't make any mistakes but
[1:06:38] all things work together
[1:06:40] for good to them that love God to them
[1:06:43] who are the called according to his
[1:06:45] purpose
[1:06:46] for whom he did for no he also did
[1:06:49] predestinate to be conformed to the
[1:06:51] image of his son that he might be the
[1:06:54] firstborn of my many Brethren moreover
[1:06:55] whom he did predestinate then he also
[1:06:57] called I love that who he predestinated
[1:07:00] he called
[1:07:01] who he predestinated he gave them
[1:07:03] something to do
[1:07:05] you ever think about it like that he
[1:07:07] called those who he predestinated whom
[1:07:10] he called him he also Justified let me
[1:07:12] Justified them he also glorified what
[1:07:14] shall we then say to these things if God
[1:07:15] before us who can be against us he
[1:07:17] despair not his own son but delivered
[1:07:20] him up for us all how shall he not with
[1:07:22] him also freely give us all thanks
[1:07:25] now stay with me for just a moment
[1:07:29] Satan tried really hard to keep me from
[1:07:31] preaching this this morning so I think I
[1:07:33] think it needs to be said now
[1:07:36] we are we're supernaturally kept
[1:07:39] under the mystery of the Rapture I want
[1:07:42] you to watch
[1:07:43] I want you to watch because we are kept
[1:07:45] unto salvation but what would he say
[1:07:48] next ready to be revealed in the last
[1:07:51] time
[1:07:52] so before we get our Salvation our
[1:07:55] Salvation is revealed
[1:07:58] right
[1:07:59] go back and read it unto salvation ready
[1:08:02] to be revealed in the last time so we
[1:08:04] are supernaturally kept under the
[1:08:05] mystery of the rapture which is the
[1:08:08] revelation of our Salvation let me say
[1:08:10] this your attitude towards the message
[1:08:11] matters yes
[1:08:14] yes what it matters because this is
[1:08:16] God's word to us it's the present truth
[1:08:19] that gets us out of these bodies into
[1:08:21] another body into that glorious body now
[1:08:24] if you look at it begin to begin to
[1:08:27] think about it you realize that those
[1:08:28] who take a casual attitude towards the
[1:08:32] mysteries of God towards the things of
[1:08:34] God towards the truth of the word of God
[1:08:36] he said brother man why do you spend so
[1:08:38] much time on the message and the things
[1:08:40] of God and I believe we do need to spend
[1:08:42] time on the simple things as well but I
[1:08:44] recognize that people people will not
[1:08:46] live right unless they can get a
[1:08:48] revelation of what God's doing
[1:08:50] people are not gonna they're not gonna
[1:08:52] walk right unless they get a revelation
[1:08:54] of what God's doing they're not gonna
[1:08:55] you know if you have no revelation of
[1:08:57] the message me telling you not to cut
[1:08:59] your hair it's not going to do you hold
[1:09:00] on good
[1:09:01] if you don't have a revelation of the
[1:09:03] message me telling you not to do certain
[1:09:04] things women not to wear makeup and
[1:09:06] things like that that's not going to do
[1:09:08] you a whole lot of good because you
[1:09:09] don't I'm not condemning you for that
[1:09:10] you just don't have a revelation because
[1:09:12] a prophet spoke against it
[1:09:15] right but if you have a revelation of
[1:09:17] the importance of the message
[1:09:20] right then you begin to walk in it yeah
[1:09:23] so now our message if I can put it this
[1:09:27] way it's not a man our message is to
[1:09:29] rapture
[1:09:31] the Branham taught us that the shout is
[1:09:34] the message of the hour
[1:09:35] and each age was supernaturally kept
[1:09:38] losing my voice so you just have to bear
[1:09:40] with me for a minute each age is
[1:09:43] supernaturally kept up until a certain
[1:09:46] point and then the Bride of that age is
[1:09:48] called
[1:09:49] so each Luther Wesley Pentecost and now
[1:09:52] the bride age what we call the bride age
[1:09:54] which is that part of the laodicean age
[1:09:56] where the bride is called out
[1:09:58] so now we are we are in that age and
[1:10:00] that Revelation is given to us of the
[1:10:03] Holy Ghost for our age which is the
[1:10:06] shout the message which is the be as he
[1:10:10] descends he does all three brother
[1:10:12] Branham says the Rapture message he he
[1:10:13] descends with a shout which is a message
[1:10:15] to get the bride ready
[1:10:17] so as I said before we're already
[1:10:20] buckled in
[1:10:22] yeah oh my and watch
[1:10:24] Brothers to the church the bride the
[1:10:28] Rapture is a revelation to her
[1:10:32] it's Amen it's revealed to her
[1:10:36] and again he says that the Revelation
[1:10:38] the true bride of Christ
[1:10:40] will be waiting for that revelation of
[1:10:43] the Rapture brother says he's preaching
[1:10:44] the Rapture sermon
[1:10:46] he said now it is a revelation
[1:10:49] for the Revelation is faith
[1:10:51] you cannot see you're kept by the power
[1:10:53] of God through faith you see what I'm
[1:10:56] saying you're kept by the power of God
[1:10:58] through faith unto salvation ready to be
[1:11:00] revealed at the last time so the
[1:11:02] Revelation is Faith you cannot have a
[1:11:04] revelation without it being faith faith
[1:11:06] is a revelation because it's something
[1:11:07] that's revealed to you faith is a
[1:11:09] revelation he said faith is something's
[1:11:11] been revealed to you like it was to
[1:11:12] Abraham that could call anything
[1:11:14] contrary to what had been revealed to
[1:11:16] him as though it wasn't so
[1:11:18] now Faith he said that's what faith is
[1:11:20] it's revelation of God the church is
[1:11:22] built on a revelation the whole entire
[1:11:24] body
[1:11:27] so you could take that and say well
[1:11:30] the bride of Christ is waiting now
[1:11:32] on the revelation of the Rapture brother
[1:11:34] random says that at the beginning of the
[1:11:35] Rapture sermon
[1:11:36] look what he says at the end
[1:11:38] he said now we're ready
[1:11:41] waiting for the raptures the Rapture of
[1:11:42] the Saints it's been spoken
[1:11:48] so shall it be
[1:11:50] When God says anything all heavens and
[1:11:52] earth will pass away but that word will
[1:11:54] never fail
[1:11:56] again at the end he comes back and says
[1:11:58] it again God bless you it's the last
[1:11:59] thing that he says before he goes to he
[1:12:01] closes bless you it's been spoken it has
[1:12:04] to come to pass
[1:12:06] it will come to pass
[1:12:10] now brother random famously used an odd
[1:12:13] text for his Rapture message you all
[1:12:14] know where I'm going now Psalms 27. he
[1:12:18] talks about being kept in a time of
[1:12:19] trouble
[1:12:22] that's the Rapture message
[1:12:25] he said the Lord is my light and my
[1:12:27] salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is
[1:12:29] the strength of my life of whom shall I
[1:12:31] be afraid
[1:12:32] when the wicked even mine enemies and my
[1:12:33] foes Came Upon me to eat up my flesh
[1:12:35] that's what it seems like doesn't it
[1:12:37] when everybody come against me when the
[1:12:40] whole world went crazy brother Justin
[1:12:42] when they came upon me you know my flesh
[1:12:43] they stumbled and fell though a host
[1:12:46] shouldn't Camp against me my heart
[1:12:48] should not fear the war should rise
[1:12:49] against me and this will I be confident
[1:12:51] one thing if I desire to the Lord that
[1:12:54] will I seek after that I may dwell in
[1:12:56] the house of the Lord all the days of my
[1:12:58] life to behold the beauty of the Lord to
[1:13:00] inquire in his Temple for in the time of
[1:13:03] trouble
[1:13:04] this was what brother Brandon preached
[1:13:06] in a Rapture message in the time of
[1:13:09] trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion
[1:13:11] and the secret of his Tabernacle shall
[1:13:13] behind me he shall set me upon a rock
[1:13:15] now for us it's not strange to us to
[1:13:18] have the Rapture preached from psalms 27
[1:13:20] but if you had been sitting there
[1:13:22] you had no clue where he was going
[1:13:25] because you remember the old Holiness
[1:13:27] days Jonathan remembers it back in the
[1:13:29] day Saturday night there'd be a Rapture
[1:13:31] message or the coming of the Lord would
[1:13:32] be preacher Sunday night on some night
[1:13:34] and towards the end of the meeting in
[1:13:36] those in those camp meetings you'd have
[1:13:38] a Rapture message preach
[1:13:39] and it was always the way I preached
[1:13:41] many a Rapture message first
[1:13:42] Thessalonians 4.
[1:13:44] right First Corinthians 15.
[1:13:47] right or or one of The Parables of Jesus
[1:13:50] he says watch him be ready
[1:13:52] but never Psalms 27.
[1:13:55] Hallelujah but under the opening of the
[1:13:58] word
[1:13:59] a prophet of God under inspiration comes
[1:14:02] and brings us a Rapture sermon from
[1:14:05] psalms 27 in the time of trouble
[1:14:09] how are we living now
[1:14:10] he will hide me
[1:14:13] he will set me upon a rock
[1:14:15] listen to me Church
[1:14:17] oh I hope you're hearing me today
[1:14:19] our children are not kept under a
[1:14:21] Pentecostal message
[1:14:24] well if I could get them to go to enough
[1:14:26] meetings if I can get them to go to
[1:14:27] another that's good we want you to do
[1:14:29] that but that's not what you're kept by
[1:14:31] if I could just get them to an
[1:14:33] experience of some kind and that's
[1:14:34] wonderful we want them to have their own
[1:14:35] experience every generation has to have
[1:14:37] it but we are supernaturally kept those
[1:14:40] of us who are born again are
[1:14:41] supernaturally kept by the message of
[1:14:44] the hour
[1:14:45] that's what we feed on that's what we're
[1:14:47] kept by
[1:14:51] can you see it
[1:14:52] children are not kept under a
[1:14:54] Pentecostal message or a Lutheran
[1:14:55] message under a Rapture message
[1:14:58] we are set on a rock of Revelation that
[1:15:01] is our Shield
[1:15:02] faith
[1:15:04] first Peter one and five again listen
[1:15:06] who are kept by the power of God through
[1:15:09] faith unto salvation ready to be
[1:15:12] revealed in the last time listen to me
[1:15:15] church I'm not trying to change the
[1:15:16] scripture but if you take what a prophet
[1:15:18] said and said it has been spoken so will
[1:15:20] it be we're living in the time when the
[1:15:22] Salvation has been revealed
[1:15:25] when we've been told what we had to do
[1:15:27] to go in when we've been given the key
[1:15:29] to the door
[1:15:32] God we're not waiting on being given the
[1:15:35] key to the door but we're but we we can
[1:15:37] finish the work
[1:15:39] you said we still have something to do
[1:15:40] yes we do the bride will be the final
[1:15:42] voice for the final age that's what the
[1:15:43] random said
[1:15:44] but we still have something to do but
[1:15:46] what is it it's like
[1:15:48] it's like brother Joel's building a
[1:15:49] house and I was helping him that's a
[1:15:51] scary thought isn't it
[1:15:54] but but I don't scare you to Joel but if
[1:15:57] I was helping you but Joe to build a
[1:15:58] house
[1:15:59] and
[1:16:00] and you at some point during the day you
[1:16:02] leave
[1:16:03] and you leave me there and you say now
[1:16:05] this house is not complete till this
[1:16:08] final piece is put in this final piece
[1:16:11] of siding or the final nail
[1:16:14] the final screw whatever it is
[1:16:16] this has got to be kept in and you need
[1:16:19] this certain tool to do it with
[1:16:21] but now now if you left me and you said
[1:16:24] brother Ben now when I get back I'll
[1:16:26] bring the tool
[1:16:27] and then what's been paused we'll
[1:16:29] unpause it and then you can you can
[1:16:32] finish
[1:16:33] well guess what I'm gonna do
[1:16:35] I'm gonna go to Burger King
[1:16:39] get some sweet tea
[1:16:41] all right
[1:16:43] I'm gonna go to my mama's house eat some
[1:16:46] food
[1:16:48] all right that's what I'm gonna do
[1:16:50] y'all know me come on
[1:16:53] he says now watch when I get back well
[1:16:55] he'll call me you know surely let me
[1:16:57] know
[1:16:58] and he comes back but she won't be doing
[1:17:00] anything
[1:17:02] why because I'm waiting on him
[1:17:05] now brother Brandon being a master
[1:17:07] Carpenter in our age how many believe
[1:17:08] that
[1:17:09] if he had left us
[1:17:12] left us with a message but said now when
[1:17:15] I come back I'll give you the tools for
[1:17:16] it to finish it yeah what are you doing
[1:17:20] he's Gotta Wait but he didn't do that
[1:17:25] at the end of The Rapture message almost
[1:17:27] at the end of his life he tells us we're
[1:17:29] ready for the Rapture now
[1:17:31] he tells us we have a perfect River
[1:17:33] Revelation by Divine Vindication he
[1:17:36] tells us that all Seven Seals have been
[1:17:38] opened
[1:17:40] he tells us that why does he tell us
[1:17:42] that because he wants us to finish the
[1:17:44] work
[1:17:46] why why does Satan fight that brother
[1:17:48] said he fights Revelation more than he
[1:17:50] fights anything else that's right go
[1:17:52] look at it in the revelation of Jesus
[1:17:53] Christ in the church of his book he said
[1:17:54] why does he fight it he says he knows
[1:17:57] that if the people get the true
[1:17:58] revelation of the true church and what
[1:18:00] she is and what she stands for and that
[1:18:03] she can do
[1:18:05] the Greater Works what did Brother
[1:18:08] Graham tell us the Greater Works were go
[1:18:10] back to Shalom but the random teaches us
[1:18:11] that there was a greater word he said oh
[1:18:13] you always thought there was more more
[1:18:14] because there's more of us but then he
[1:18:16] goes into another teaching and he
[1:18:17] teaches us at the Greater Works
[1:18:19] the Greater Works was the spoken word
[1:18:21] yeah
[1:18:24] yeah oh God he said which was made
[1:18:26] something out of nothing right
[1:18:28] he said he knows that the people get the
[1:18:30] true revelation of the true church
[1:18:33] and what she is and what she stands for
[1:18:36] and that she can do the Greater Works
[1:18:38] that she can do the Greater Works she
[1:18:41] will be an invincible army yes
[1:18:44] she will be supernaturally kept she will
[1:18:47] be the finals I'm gonna push this thing
[1:18:48] off the platform she will be the final
[1:18:50] boy
[1:18:52] to the final age
[1:18:54] under her messenger why brother Stewart
[1:18:56] because the revelation of the Rapture is
[1:18:58] in her yes she is the bride's Revival
[1:19:01] yeah
[1:19:02] come the word
[1:19:03] he has the mind of Christ or she can't
[1:19:05] steal he said brother Ben you're saying
[1:19:07] that about you what you say why can't I
[1:19:09] see that because you're looking at the
[1:19:10] flesh he's veiled again behind flesh
[1:19:15] and you're looking at it God's hiding
[1:19:16] himself in Simplicity once again
[1:19:20] stay with the word
[1:19:22] brother Brown at the end of that Rapture
[1:19:23] message
[1:19:24] about the
[1:19:26] about the ones that were marching
[1:19:28] remember the Onward Christian Soldiers
[1:19:30] the film about the end got out of stand
[1:19:33] he said stay in line with the word
[1:19:35] he was crying out to him get it back in
[1:19:37] line yeah yeah all little churches we
[1:19:39] could just say that this morning I know
[1:19:41] some of us are here and some of us are

[1:19:45] just if we could just in our hearts
[1:19:46] wherever we're at today to stay with the
[1:19:49] word to stay right there where God wants
[1:19:51] us to be isn't that what we should do we
[1:19:54] should always want to stay
[1:19:57] we should always want to stay right
[1:19:59] where God put us yeah
[1:20:01] I'm not preaching my microphone we
[1:20:03] should always want to stay right where
[1:20:05] did he put us in the message of the hour
[1:20:06] stay with the word stay with the token

[1:20:14] stay with it your your safety is not
[1:20:17] dependent on your on your head knowledge
[1:20:19] your safety is not dependent on what you
[1:20:21] what you who you associate with or even

[1:24:03] rock of the revelation of the word of
[1:24:04] the hour

[1:24:10] but maybe you just want to examine
[1:24:12] yourself for a moment before we do that
[1:24:13] and say Lord if I'm not in the ark if
[1:24:17] I'm not under the rock if I'm not
[1:24:19] if I haven't put that Revelation first
[1:24:21] in my life

[1:24:26] money I prayed for I prayed for all
[1:24:28] these other things I prayed for physical
[1:24:29] healing but Lord I need revelation
[1:24:32] I need you to reveal yourself to me Lord
