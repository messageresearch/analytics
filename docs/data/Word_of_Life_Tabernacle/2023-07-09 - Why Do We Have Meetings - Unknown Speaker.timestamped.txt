[38:57] to be here because I just want you to
[38:59] listen to me because I won't be
[39:00] preaching but these brothers that we're
[39:02] having in they're just God called men
[39:04] and I believe it would be a help to you
[39:06] and maybe all the rest of your life
[39:08] would be a help this one meeting that
[39:10] we'd have we'll talk about the value of
[39:12] that this morning but especially
[39:14] Saturday morning this year is not going
[39:16] to be a youth meeting it's going to be a
[39:18] regular service so Saturday morning at
[39:20] 10 30 brother Daryl Ward will be
[39:23] preaching and that I'm not sure yet of
[39:25] who's preaching what services but I know
[39:28] brother Daryl will be preaching that
[39:29] service and it may be the only time we
[39:31] get to hear him this weekend if that's
[39:33] so then we we need to we need to be here
[39:36] and he's coming all this way to preach
[39:38] and and just try to be here if you can
[39:40] be on Saturday morning I believe it'll
[39:42] be a blessing but all the services
[39:43] whenever you can come I'm sure will be a
[39:46] blessing to you amen
[39:49] Isaiah 1 18 come now and let us reason
[39:52] together saith the Lord
[39:54] aren't you glad you've been invited
[39:57] to the meeting with the Lord
[40:00] though your sins be a Scarlet they shall
[40:04] be as light as snow
[40:05] though they'd be red like crimson
[40:08] they shall be as wool may the Lord add
[40:11] his Blessing to the word you may be
[40:12] seated
[40:24] in our text God is calling his people
[40:26] together
[40:28] for a meeting
[40:30] or what brother random calls a
[40:31] conference yes
[40:33] yes he wants to have a meeting with his
[40:35] people he said come come reason with me
[40:38] come talk to me
[40:39] I want to talk to you I've got something
[40:41] I want to tell you
[40:43] and in this day and age you know I think
[40:46] there are people we we lose sight of why
[40:48] we have meetings why why do we even have
[40:51] church which the the main spiritual life
[40:54] of the church is our regular Services
[40:56] that's that's the main spiritual
[40:58] lifeblood of the church and and I would
[41:01] say it's the most important that we're
[41:03] faithful to that and yet at a meeting
[41:06] time there's something special about
[41:08] that and and the reason is because God
[41:11] wants to have a meeting with us see he
[41:14] wants to talk to us see he wants to have
[41:16] a conference with us all the way back in
[41:19] the Garden of Eden
[41:20] god Set an instituted meetings he he had
[41:24] a conference there brother random called
[41:27] it the Eden conference in the Garden of
[41:29] Eden how that he met Adam and Eve after
[41:32] they had sinned and and they'd gone away
[41:35] from him and and done what the word said
[41:38] not to do and they went out and got fig
[41:40] leaves and tried to cover themselves up
[41:42] with religion to be able to uh to
[41:45] present themselves before God and yet
[41:47] they realize the Fig Leaf was not
[41:49] sufficient to be able to to bring them
[41:52] into the presence of God and so they
[41:54] fled from the presence of the Lord and
[41:56] the Bible says they hid themselves
[41:59] and God goes down through the garden the
[42:02] spirit of God brother says he didn't
[42:03] send an angel he didn't send a second in
[42:06] command but he come down himself into
[42:08] the garden and he began to cry out Adam
[42:11] where are you he was advertising for a
[42:15] meeting
[42:15] he wanted to meet with his children he
[42:19] said I want you to come together I want
[42:21] to have a meeting with you I want to
[42:23] have a conference with you I want you to
[42:25] know what I want to be able to speak to
[42:27] you and find out what's wrong why
[42:30] there's this distance between me and you
[42:32] oh I think we need that kind of meeting
[42:33] today many times we get called on God
[42:36] and we try to cover ourselves up with
[42:38] religion we try to cover it up but we
[42:40] just need to come to the house of the
[42:41] Lord and have a meeting with God have a
[42:45] conference with God
[42:47] people have always gathered together
[42:49] we're sheep there's no such thing as a
[42:51] Lone Ranger Christian
[42:54] there's no such thing as a as a loan she
[42:56] if there's a lone sheep that's a dead
[42:58] sheep
[42:59] because he can't protect himself on his
[43:02] own he needs a shepherd and he needs
[43:04] other sheep oh my that's what we need we
[43:07] need a Shepherd we have a Shepherd the
[43:09] great Shepherd we need each other as
[43:11] well
[43:12] but God's people always gather together
[43:14] the Patriarchs built altars and
[43:17] worshiped with their families and their
[43:18] servants around the altar
[43:21] when they died the people the Bible says
[43:24] every time a patriarch dies it says they
[43:25] were gathered with their people
[43:27] I heard what the random say this morning
[43:29] he said when he went uh beyond the
[43:31] curtain of time he said that the one
[43:33] that was speaking to him said you've
[43:35] been gathered with your people
[43:37] oh my you've been gathered with your
[43:39] people you've been assembled that's what
[43:42] going to heaven is is to be actually
[43:44] being assembled with the people of God
[43:47] he says you've been assembled with your
[43:49] people he said are all these randoms he
[43:51] said no these are your converts to
[43:52] Christ
[43:54] so now the even in the Tabernacle in the
[43:57] wilderness in Moses state it was called
[43:59] The Tabernacle of the congregation or
[44:02] the Tabernacle of the assembly yeah it
[44:04] was not the Tabernacle of the Lone
[44:06] Rangers right right it was not the
[44:08] Tabernacle of those who couldn't
[44:09] couldn't even stand the side of one
[44:11] another wasn't the Tabernacle of those
[44:13] who wanted to just do their own thing
[44:14] but it was the Tabernacle of the
[44:16] assembly God's got somebody that you can
[44:19] agree with on the principle of the
[44:21] atonement he's got somebody you can
[44:22] fellowship with somebody who you can
[44:25] talk to some of you say well I'm all
[44:26] alone in the world no God's got somebody
[44:28] somewhere and he says come let us reason
[44:30] together
[44:32] let's assemble together around the
[44:34] Tabernacle of the congregation
[44:37] the Israelites had seven feasts during
[44:39] the Old Testament during which they
[44:40] gathered at the Tabernacle and later the
[44:42] temple to worship they called it a
[44:44] solemn assembly when they would come
[44:46] together and God always did that when he
[44:48] was about to do something yes he's
[44:51] always had a gathering of the people
[44:53] and we know that the true Gathering
[44:55] today is a spiritual Gathering how many
[44:58] know that today
[44:59] brother Branham preaches on that the
[45:01] true Gathering is the spiritual
[45:02] Gathering which is because we know that
[45:04] Christ is God's provided place of
[45:07] worship
[45:08] that's God's provided place of worship
[45:10] when he died on the cross the the temple
[45:13] veil was rent why showing that the
[45:16] presence of God was no longer inside the
[45:19] holy of holies in the temple but it was
[45:21] there on the cross The Mercy Seat was no
[45:23] longer inside the holy of holies but The
[45:25] Mercy Seat become a person and The Mercy
[45:28] Seat came back on the day of Pentecost
[45:30] to live in a people
[45:33] that's where it is today be it Christ is
[45:36] God's provided place of worship he is
[45:39] God's assembly place he is who we rally
[45:42] around here's who we talk about he's the
[45:45] theme of our meeting
[45:47] are you with me now he's the theme of
[45:49] our church so it's bigger than Word of
[45:51] Life Tabernacle it's bigger than just a
[45:53] Ben Pruitt or Joel Pruitt or Stuart
[45:56] Duckworth or whoever might be preaching
[45:57] it's bigger than us but it's but it's
[46:00] God meaning with us
[46:03] he is God's provided place of worship
[46:06] Genesis 49-10 the scepter shall not
[46:09] depart from Judah nor a lawgiver from
[46:11] between his feet until shallow coming
[46:13] unto him shall the Gathering of the
[46:15] people be
[46:16] Deuteronomy 12 and 5 but unto the place
[46:19] which the Lord your God shall choose out
[46:21] of all your tribes to put his name there
[46:23] even into his habitations shall you see
[46:25] and then Thou shalt come and here come
[46:27] Jesus and he come down among them he
[46:29] told them he said if you destroy this
[46:31] body tear down this Temple and I'll
[46:33] build it again in three days he wasn't
[46:34] talking about that Temple Made of Stone
[46:36] that Herod building was talking about
[46:38] his own body
[46:39] that was the place where God put his
[46:41] name he said I come in my father's name
[46:44] and God put his name in Jesus Christ
[46:47] so brother Brandon said he said I'll
[46:49] choose the place to put my name in the
[46:50] name was Jesus and Jesus is the word
[46:52] Saint John 1. he said that's the place
[46:54] of worship in Christ the word I come in
[46:56] my father's name again he said in my
[46:59] name this shall cast out Devils that's
[47:00] the name of the father he put his name
[47:03] in Jesus Christ in him he meets
[47:06] oh I love this where do we want to meet
[47:08] this weekend we want to meet in him
[47:10] where do you want to meet on a Sunday
[47:12] morning or Wednesday night we meet in
[47:13] him
[47:15] he is the word amen he said in my name
[47:17] in him he meets to Worship in him he
[47:20] meets the cast out devils in him he
[47:22] meets to heal the sick I mean he need
[47:24] healing this morning in him he needs to
[47:26] heal the sick
[47:28] Hallelujah an enemy meets the same in
[47:30] him he needs to fill with the Holy Ghost
[47:32] that's God's only place to meet people
[47:34] for worship
[47:35] in Christ amen again he said when and
[47:38] where will the people of God gather for
[47:40] the last word in Christ
[47:43] amen for the last day they'll Gather in
[47:45] Christ he said don't forget that now we
[47:48] got a gathering place we got it just
[47:50] exactly it's not Hardy Arkansas or
[47:51] Jeffersonville Indiana or Tucson Arizona
[47:53] or any other place that you can name but
[47:56] the Gathering Place is in Christ
[48:00] and yet we have a desire
[48:03] to meet together
[48:06] why we've been together before
[48:09] I don't want to get ahead of myself this
[48:11] morning but you know
[48:13] you are the thoughts of God all of the
[48:17] thoughts of God were assembled in God
[48:20] before the foundation of the earth and
[48:23] now you've been expressed on the earth
[48:24] and you have a desire to come together
[48:28] because you're one of those thoughts
[48:31] now in the scripture tells us he said
[48:33] don't forsake the Assembly of ourselves
[48:35] together you say well that's Sunday
[48:36] morning church but Paul didn't limit it
[48:39] to that but he says as the manner of
[48:41] some is but exhorting one another and so
[48:43] much the more as you see the day
[48:44] approaching I'll say this
[48:46] honoring the Resurrection on Sunday
[48:48] morning is the least that we could do
[48:51] but there's a desire in her heart and I
[48:53] don't say that there's any biblical
[48:55] mandate that you come together any more
[48:56] often than that but there's a desire on
[48:58] the heart of the Christian that cries
[49:00] out and says I want to be with other
[49:02] Christians
[49:04] especially even more as you see the day
[49:06] approaching
[49:09] in the book of Acts the disciples
[49:10] gathered almost constantly
[49:13] in Acts 2 46 they continuing daily with
[49:16] one Accord in the temple and breaking
[49:18] bread from house to house did ether meat
[49:20] with gladness and singleness of heart if
[49:23] you've never been overseas uh on in
[49:26] missionary work sometimes it's hard for
[49:28] us as Americans to understand this
[49:29] because when we get done with the
[49:31] service a lot of times we'll get in our
[49:32] cars and go home
[49:34] but what they did over there is they
[49:36] they lived together by a necessity if
[49:39] nothing else they couldn't just drive
[49:40] back to their house or whatever so they
[49:42] got together at someone's house
[49:45] and they worshiped God at first in the
[49:47] house and then they would take the
[49:48] chairs up or whatever and some of you've
[49:50] been in churches like they had in
[49:51] meetings like that take the chairs up
[49:53] and then you eat in the same place and
[49:54] and you have Fellowship all day together
[49:56] remember when I was in the Philippines
[49:58] there were the wrong malays I sat there
[50:00] in the house the church is right across
[50:01] the street from the house and people
[50:02] started Gathering early that morning
[50:04] they started they'd come right to the
[50:05] pastor's house
[50:07] and they all started together and pretty
[50:08] soon the house was full it's about four
[50:10] or five stories there I think some of
[50:11] you have been there the Mike's been
[50:13] there and and the people started
[50:15] Gathering and it was Easter Sunday and
[50:17] they just saw they're touching tits
[50:18] fellowship if you've been in those kind
[50:20] of places where in the Philippines in
[50:23] Africa when we were in Egypt it's just
[50:25] an intense Fellowship it's day and night
[50:26] people coming and going that's the way
[50:28] that they were why they loved one
[50:30] another
[50:31] they cared about one another
[50:33] and in our individualistic Society we
[50:35] lose some of that and I don't say that
[50:37] we shouldn't have boundaries I think
[50:38] that we should but I do think when when
[50:40] they're when God when we want to have a
[50:42] meeting let's come together and let that
[50:44] wall put the walls down and just spend
[50:46] time with one another
[50:47] yeah because that's what they did
[50:51] now Catholicism killed the meeting
[50:55] I know there's message preachers today
[50:56] will tell you you shouldn't have
[50:57] meetings but look what killed the
[51:00] meetings
[51:01] Catholicism killed the meetings
[51:04] right go back in church history
[51:06] Catholicism killed the meeting it made
[51:09] it a formal Affair it made it just a
[51:11] priest stand up there with a wafer and
[51:13] you gathered around and then you all
[51:14] went home maybe you come every day and
[51:16] did math but that's all you did and so
[51:18] you went home and you just was obedient
[51:20] to the church they swapped Church
[51:22] obedience for the Holy Ghost
[51:25] and so what happened is pretty soon the
[51:27] only Gatherings that they had was
[51:28] Gatherings of Bishops and Gatherings of
[51:30] cardinals Church councils to try to
[51:32] figure out Doctrine that's not what God
[51:34] wants us together for we're not called
[51:37] together to figure out Doctrine who's
[51:39] right and who's wrong I'm not called
[51:40] together we're not having a meeting to
[51:42] straighten everybody out make sure
[51:44] everybody's on the same page with us
[51:45] that's not the purpose but the purpose
[51:47] is to get together and fellowship
[51:49] together and worship God together
[51:52] see an atmosphere our children can be
[51:54] born in
[51:58] Catholicism killed it
[52:00] so anything that kills the meeting or
[52:02] the Assembly of God's people together
[52:04] today is a child of Catholicism
[52:07] it's a daughter of Catholic thought
[52:10] right because they didn't want the
[52:11] people assembling because that was a
[52:13] threat to the mother Church
[52:15] so the people sit back and watched the
[52:17] priests and obeyed orders
[52:22] brother Brown talked about it he said
[52:23] they got through their only weapon was
[52:24] argument
[52:26] and they got to where they're cold and
[52:28] Powerless and formal
[52:29] the Ephesian Church lost its first love
[52:33] brother Branham says this in the church
[52:34] age book he said but there's something I
[52:36] got against you that you've left your
[52:38] first love you left that love that you
[52:40] once had for them good old-fashioned
[52:42] Holy Ghost meetings and you begin to
[52:44] kind of slide backwards into that formal
[52:46] come in with our father nonsense yeah
[52:49] I say we ought to worship God
[52:52] according to dictator we don't have to
[52:54] do it like the Pentecostals do it we
[52:56] don't have to do it like some church
[52:58] down the road does it but let's worship
[53:00] God in the freedom of the Holy Ghost
[53:02] whatever God tells us to do with Isaac
[53:04] that's what we need to do not what
[53:06] everybody else does let's let's be
[53:08] ourselves this morning
[53:09] just let our hair down because those of
[53:11] us that do have hair
[53:13] let's let her hair down and and just
[53:16] relax in the presence of God
[53:19] we talked about that Wednesday night you
[53:20] know brother Brandon when you have
[53:21] somebody come up before him he'd say now
[53:23] relax that that you feel he said the
[53:25] pillar of fire standing between me and
[53:27] you the filler fires all over you he
[53:29] would tell him he said just relax that
[53:31] feeling that warmth that you feel is
[53:33] just the presence of the Holy Spirit the
[53:35] presence of the angel
[53:38] now
[53:39] methodism really Luther began it but
[53:43] methodism really brought back the idea
[53:44] of having a conference or or meeting
[53:47] Wesley was convinced with George
[53:49] Whitfield to preach in the open air
[53:52] and ever since then evangelicals have
[53:54] held what they call protracted meetings
[53:57] conferences conventions and Revival
[54:00] services and I'll say this that even
[54:02] that can become a form yeah
[54:04] right it can become a form we don't want
[54:07] it as a form we want a reality of it
[54:10] but brother Branham you know held
[54:12] meetings and all over the country that's
[54:14] what he did for more than 20 years and
[54:16] all sorts of tents and halls and
[54:19] churches and theaters arenas
[54:22] and he even talked about going into
[54:24] football stadiums and different soccer
[54:26] stadiums he held services in motels and
[54:30] restaurants
[54:32] right and sometimes you can hear them
[54:33] putting down their Forks well brother
[54:35] Brown was preaching
[54:38] right and and in his first meeting when
[54:41] he come back to Jeffersonville he liked
[54:42] to hold a meeting if you study the
[54:44] message very much you'll you'll begin to
[54:46] watch where brother Branham comes back
[54:48] to Jeffersonville he begins to hold
[54:49] meetings in Jeffersonville and he
[54:51] explained several places why that he
[54:53] come back and did that he said in Israel
[54:55] in the church brother random come back
[54:57] this first meeting coming back off the
[54:59] field was in 1953 at the early years he
[55:02] only come back every few years for a
[55:04] meeting come back for Individual
[55:06] Services but he said a Revival to my
[55:08] opinion doesn't consist he said of
[55:10] bringing in new members a Revival
[55:12] doesn't consist of a bunch of
[55:14] conversions although those things go
[55:16] along with her Revival but a Revival is
[55:18] to revive what you've heard he got
[55:20] just to get them revived yeah we'd be
[55:23] doing good if we got these revived isn't
[55:24] that right
[55:25] that's why we want you to be here we
[55:28] want you to be revived
[55:30] hey man and and so again when brother
[55:32] Branham comes back in 1954 he come back
[55:35] for the mark of the beast seal of God
[55:37] seriously he preached that series of
[55:39] meetings he said and he preached the
[55:40] seven Church ages as well in one service
[55:42] that night he said these type of
[55:44] services if God willing he said it's
[55:46] directed to the church for the benefit
[55:49] of the church where we feel that is so
[55:51] greatly needed at the time everywhere
[55:53] for the edifying of the body of Christ
[55:56] in eastern 1957 he come back and Branham
[56:00] always tried to have Easter meetings and
[56:01] he'd come back and he said it seems good
[56:03] in our soul that we return again tonight
[56:05] to begin another one of those
[56:07] old-fashioned revivals where Sinners
[56:09] call out for Mercy where the backsider
[56:11] makes things right with God again
[56:13] don't you want to have a church service
[56:15] like that don't you want to see a
[56:17] meeting like that he said the holy
[56:19] spirit is the main person in the meeting
[56:21] well I'm looking forward to seeing my
[56:23] brothers and sisters I'm glad for the
[56:25] preachers that are coming but the holy
[56:27] spirit is the main person in the meeting
[56:28] who takes hold in rules and brings us to
[56:32] us the bread of life through the word
[56:34] and we pray that he'll minister to us
[56:36] night after night in this revival heal
[56:39] the sick and the need he sanctify every
[56:41] believer and get Glory out of these
[56:42] efforts that we put forth
[56:45] again in the Holy Ghost series Brandon
[56:48] comes back to preach what is the Holy
[56:49] Ghost what is the Holy Ghost given for
[56:50] and and then preached another sermon
[56:53] which they didn't take
[56:54] on how you know that you have the Holy
[56:56] Ghost
[56:57] he says I believe that we're so close to
[56:59] the coming of the Lord Jesus
[57:01] and it behooves us to do all that we
[57:03] possibly can to bring every soul to the
[57:06] kingdom and to bring the kingdom to the
[57:09] people
[57:10] oh my to bring every soul to the kingdom
[57:13] and to bring the kingdom to the people
[57:15] that we might be healed of our spirits
[57:20] now watch this we need healing in our
[57:23] bodies I asked you a while ago who all
[57:24] needed healing and many hands went up
[57:26] because we always almost perpetually
[57:28] need healing in some cases worse than
[57:31] others especially as you grow older and
[57:33] you just constantly your body's breaking
[57:36] down
[57:37] so we need healing but brother Branham
[57:38] taught us that he said the sickest body
[57:40] that I know of is the body of the Lord
[57:42] Jesus on the earth the church says the
[57:45] sickest body that I know of he talks
[57:47] about that and so he said I want this to
[57:49] be a meeting so we can be healed of our
[57:51] spirits
[57:52] oh would that be your cry today let it
[57:54] be a meaning where old grudges are
[57:56] settled and an irreconcilable
[57:58] differences are done away with and
[58:00] people that would be unwilling to even
[58:03] sin across from one another are willing
[58:05] to sit and forsake in the kingdom of God
[58:06] let it be a place where forgiveness is
[58:08] where the power of God breaks down all
[58:11] the barriers
[58:13] new healing yes
[58:15] yes we need healing of spirits
[58:18] president preaches
[58:20] the church agents the seven Church ages
[58:22] and the seals as meetings
[58:23] in his church
[58:25] and what I like to think as the first
[58:28] message meetings
[58:30] were in the junior high school in
[58:32] Jeffersonville in 1965
[58:36] it's the first time it was primarily
[58:37] messaged people
[58:39] that come together
[58:40] and they come together to hear Brother
[58:42] Branham on marriage and divorce he
[58:44] announced he would be preaching on that
[58:45] it begins at Wednesday night in the uh
[58:48] in the Tabernacle and begins with a man
[58:51] running from the presence of the Lord
[58:52] and he goes on he preaches all those
[58:55] Services who is this Melchizedek and and
[58:57] all those services that weekend
[58:59] to several thousand people that were
[59:02] gathered at that meeting to hear the
[59:04] word I know there were people from this
[59:05] area that went to that
[59:07] and so they come to hear something new
[59:10] they come to hear something revealed
[59:13] right because he was different when
[59:15] brother Brandon had a meeting it was
[59:16] different because he was a prophet
[59:19] right and they knew that there would be
[59:22] something some something fresh from God
[59:23] now we don't come for that
[59:26] because the Mysteries have been revealed
[59:28] right right but we do come for more
[59:30] Revelation yeah of the word that's
[59:32] already been revealed so when I go to a
[59:34] meeting I don't expect brother Branham
[59:36] to get up in the pulpit but I expect the
[59:38] preacher to get up in the pulpit and
[59:40] preach to me what the what the prophet
[59:42] said yeah and so I can be inspired to it
[59:45] so I can be thrilled by it so I can be
[59:48] personally have the stimulation of
[59:50] Revelation
[59:51] so I want to hear the word at a meeting
[59:53] yes
[59:55] not not just a pump up or or try to make
[59:58] you feel good but I want to hear the
[59:59] word preach because the word is a
[1:00:01] discerner the thoughts and tends of the
[1:00:03] heart right
[1:00:04] so but today we rally around that
[1:00:07] message yeah the same message that Drew
[1:00:09] them from all over the country to go and
[1:00:11] hear it we had that same message just
[1:00:13] alive today it didn't die in 1965. it's
[1:00:16] still living yeah
[1:00:18] same message
[1:00:20] still alive today
[1:00:22] now
[1:00:24] we go to the why go to the trouble and
[1:00:26] expense of having meetings
[1:00:28] think about it that's it's a lot
[1:00:31] I appreciate you so much I want to tell
[1:00:32] you that ahead of time in case I forget
[1:00:34] to tell you later how much I appreciate
[1:00:36] how hard you're going to work in these
[1:00:37] meetings
[1:00:40] haha
[1:00:41] why go to that trouble and expense I I
[1:00:44] like to think of it this way and then I
[1:00:45] will go to several reasons but I like to
[1:00:47] think of this as our love gift to the
[1:00:50] other believers in this area
[1:00:52] that this is our love gift to them that
[1:00:54] that and not just ourselves because we
[1:00:56] ourselves but we can be blessed Sunday
[1:00:58] morning Sunday night Wednesday night but
[1:01:00] we want it primarily we do want to be
[1:01:02] blessed ourselves and healed and in that
[1:01:05] atmosphere and things but
[1:01:06] but we want Fellowship it's a love gift
[1:01:09] that we have and and and it takes uh
[1:01:12] it's hard sometimes to give when you
[1:01:15] give out of the out of the gladness of
[1:01:17] your heart when you give willingly there
[1:01:19] will be you can't cast your bread on the
[1:01:20] waters without it coming back more than
[1:01:23] what it was and brother Brown calls it
[1:01:24] buttered he said cast your bread on the
[1:01:26] water it'll come back buttered yeah
[1:01:29] yeah so God doesn't forget what you do
[1:01:32] so one me one purpose that we have is
[1:01:34] fellowship yeah
[1:01:36] yeah and this is one way we've found to
[1:01:38] have Fellowship is to call a meeting
[1:01:39] that's what God wanted
[1:01:41] the Garden of Eden he said I want you to
[1:01:43] Fellowship so he called the conference
[1:01:46] and fellowship isn't trivial we were we
[1:01:48] were born to Fellowship Psalm 133 and
[1:01:51] wants to behold how good and how
[1:01:53] pleasant it is for Brethren to dwell
[1:01:55] together in unity
[1:01:57] it is like the precious ointment upon
[1:02:00] the head that ran down upon the beard
[1:02:02] even Aaron's beard that went down to the
[1:02:04] skirts of His Garment as the Dew of
[1:02:06] Herman as a dew that descended upon the
[1:02:08] mountains of Zion amen for there the
[1:02:11] Lord commanded the blessing even life
[1:02:13] forevermore
[1:02:15] brother Branham picks the same thought
[1:02:17] and kind of puts it in a in a another
[1:02:19] way and he talks tell us a story about
[1:02:21] the Bears and I heard about this that
[1:02:23] recently reminded me of it brother
[1:02:25] Brandon was talking about the Bears he
[1:02:27] said that got into his Camp you remember
[1:02:29] the story he said the Little Cub got in
[1:02:31] his camp in the mama bears and he said
[1:02:33] one the mom and one of the Cubs left and
[1:02:35] they went off by themselves and and he
[1:02:38] said oh my I said they like to make
[1:02:39] things rattle yeah he said they are
[1:02:41] Pentecostal to the court
[1:02:43] and I know some people say well you just
[1:02:45] have meetings to stir people up well
[1:02:47] sometimes we need to be stirred up
[1:02:52] there are moments we need to be stirred
[1:02:55] up
[1:02:56] he said they are Pentecostal to the core
[1:02:58] that way so they just love that so they
[1:03:00] get in and knock us a stovepipe down
[1:03:02] just mash it up he said I'm talking
[1:03:03] about noise he said well I better leave
[1:03:05] that alone
[1:03:06] he said I can prove anything it hasn't
[1:03:07] got emotion and it is dead
[1:03:09] so if your religion ain't got any
[1:03:11] emotion in it a little emotion in it you
[1:03:12] better bury it and get something you
[1:03:14] have to have a motion to be alive he
[1:03:16] said brother Branham also said that uh
[1:03:18] Still Waters Run Deep yes he did
[1:03:20] he also said that a loaded wagon runs
[1:03:23] quiet
[1:03:25] it does
[1:03:27] right and we've preached we've tried to
[1:03:28] preach both sides of that because I'll
[1:03:30] say this if a preacher won't preach
[1:03:32] everything that a prophet said I'd be
[1:03:34] wary of that
[1:03:36] I'd be careful of that
[1:03:38] right and so we tried to show both sides
[1:03:40] of that but you know what the difference
[1:03:42] is it's the audience that you're
[1:03:44] preaching to yeah somebody some of us
[1:03:46] need to be stirred up
[1:03:49] well we need a stirring and other times
[1:03:51] people just running around and making
[1:03:53] noise and not do anything and then you
[1:03:55] need to quieten it down and let them
[1:03:57] know Still Waters Run Deep
[1:04:00] so that they're both valid things but we
[1:04:03] preach the whole counsel of God Amen so
[1:04:06] brother random talked about that bear
[1:04:07] making noise he talked about how he had
[1:04:09] an old rusty pistol and and there was a
[1:04:12] tree he was going to climb up and it's a
[1:04:14] great story he said but he said but
[1:04:16] however this little bear the little
[1:04:17] fellow got his Pawn got this bucket open
[1:04:20] he said they love sweet stuff you know
[1:04:22] he got his little paw in the Molasses
[1:04:24] bucket he didn't know how to eat it with
[1:04:26] his hands so he just smear him and lick
[1:04:28] you know he said he would smear and lick
[1:04:30] after he got the bucket all somped out I
[1:04:33] said get out of there I kept hollering
[1:04:35] at him he wouldn't even turn
[1:04:37] and after he got the bucket sucked out
[1:04:39] he turned around looked at me you can't
[1:04:41] hardly run people off from a meeting if
[1:04:43] they ever get their hand in the molasses
[1:04:46] he said he couldn't get his eyes open
[1:04:48] from the top of his ears from down this
[1:04:51] little belly he was just full of
[1:04:52] molasses
[1:04:53] I thought that's right there's no
[1:04:55] condemnation he said that's just like a
[1:04:58] good old Pentecostal meeting when you
[1:05:00] get your hand right down in the Molasses
[1:05:01] bucket or Honey Jar up to your elbows
[1:05:03] and just shouting praising God he said I
[1:05:06] don't care what goes on you don't hear
[1:05:07] it
[1:05:08] he said but you know the strange thing
[1:05:10] was after he got over it and the rest of
[1:05:12] them standing up there scolding him when
[1:05:13] he got over there the rest of them had
[1:05:15] Fellowship
[1:05:17] oh you may not everybody may not get
[1:05:19] their hand in the in the Molasses jar
[1:05:21] but you can all have Fellowship
[1:05:24] Oh my he said it's like the anointing
[1:05:26] oil it just runs all over everything the
[1:05:28] Molasses run all over everything he said
[1:05:30] when they got the rest of them had
[1:05:31] Fellowship they all licked him he said
[1:05:33] now them people that didn't attend this
[1:05:34] meeting they can just lick your molasses
[1:05:36] when it's over
[1:05:39] to God
[1:05:42] see now that's Fellowship that's a
[1:05:44] reason to have a mean good reason
[1:05:46] we have meetings to serve others
[1:05:50] eternal life is living for others
[1:05:52] it ought to be the greatest privilege in
[1:05:54] our life serve our brothers and sisters
[1:05:55] in the Lord I I found that if you become
[1:05:57] inward focused too much what happens is
[1:06:01] you begin to bite and devour one another
[1:06:05] because you just always focused on the
[1:06:06] n-word
[1:06:07] and we need to focus on the n-word
[1:06:09] sometimes but most often we need to
[1:06:11] focus on other people
[1:06:12] you really want help
[1:06:14] you want spiritual healing start doing
[1:06:16] something good for somebody
[1:06:19] you want to be happy
[1:06:21] I found the way to be happy I was
[1:06:22] talking with someone about that the
[1:06:23] other night the way to be happy is to
[1:06:25] make somebody else happy
[1:06:27] all right that's the best route to
[1:06:30] happiness you want to be happy as a dad
[1:06:32] make your kids happy
[1:06:33] you want to be happy as a as a husband
[1:06:35] make your wife happy you want to be
[1:06:37] happy as a wife make your husband happy
[1:06:39] and if we could learn to serve others in
[1:06:40] that way it would be it would be just a
[1:06:43] communion that we would have with the
[1:06:44] real bride of Jesus Christ Galatians 6
[1:06:46] and 10. he said as we have therefore
[1:06:49] opportunity
[1:06:50] but what is this what is a meeting what
[1:06:52] what is a time when you go to a meeting
[1:06:54] or you or you host a meeting it's an
[1:06:56] opportunity
[1:06:57] to do good unto all men especially unto
[1:07:00] them who are of the household of faith
[1:07:02] especially unto them
[1:07:04] who are brothers and sisters he said now
[1:07:07] the first thing I want to say is brother
[1:07:08] random speaking he said Jesus never
[1:07:10] lived for himself his life was spent for
[1:07:12] others that's perfectly eternal life how
[1:07:14] many believe that today that's eternal
[1:07:17] life you mamas live all your lives for
[1:07:19] your children but that's what you're
[1:07:20] built for that's what you made for live
[1:07:23] for somebody else
[1:07:25] eternal life is living for others he
[1:07:27] said when you go to church and you do
[1:07:29] good things that's fine but when you
[1:07:30] live your life for yourself you have an
[1:07:32] eternal life
[1:07:33] eternal life is living for others it
[1:07:35] proved it when it come in the Lamb of
[1:07:36] God he lived and had eternal life
[1:07:38] because he did not live for himself he
[1:07:40] lived for others and you receive eternal
[1:07:42] life by receiving that day and you don't
[1:07:44] live for yourself no more you live for
[1:07:46] others
[1:07:48] another reason
[1:07:49] as we move through these quickly now
[1:07:52] as we get towards uh I won't hold you
[1:07:55] that long this morning or this afternoon
[1:07:56] because we've got things that we need to
[1:07:58] do
[1:08:00] but we want an atmosphere
[1:08:05] we want to be in an atmosphere
[1:08:08] I want my kids you know I was I'm not a
[1:08:10] fanatic
[1:08:12] but I've talked to people about this for
[1:08:14] years I don't want my kids to not know
[1:08:17] what it's like
[1:08:18] to fill the presence of God in a service
[1:08:22] I don't want them to grow up just as
[1:08:25] intellectual church kids come on
[1:08:27] who learn about the message and learn
[1:08:29] who their Pastor is and learn about this
[1:08:30] that or the other but they never get
[1:08:32] lost in the spirit of God they never get
[1:08:34] drunk on the spirit of God they never
[1:08:36] experience the power and the presence of
[1:08:38] God we've got to keep a balance but we
[1:08:40] don't I don't want my kids to grow up
[1:08:42] and never know
[1:08:44] yeah oh God so we'll do our best to
[1:08:47] create an atmosphere yes and part of
[1:08:49] creating an atmosphere is inviting other
[1:08:52] people to come in Among Us
[1:08:55] who are atmosphere builders
[1:08:59] all right we want preachers who can
[1:09:01] preach in an atmosphere
[1:09:02] we want we want people who can worship
[1:09:05] an atmosphere
[1:09:06] now why do we do that it helps us
[1:09:09] it helps them as well because you have
[1:09:11] an atmosphere Your Atmosphere Builders
[1:09:13] but it helps you now what did they do on
[1:09:16] the day of Pentecost and see what they
[1:09:18] were doing is they were experiencing
[1:09:21] the presence of the pillar of Fire
[1:09:25] as we talked about Wednesday night the
[1:09:27] warmth brother said you could you could
[1:09:28] feel the warmth of it even though you
[1:09:30] couldn't necessarily see the light of it
[1:09:32] they were feeling they were experiencing
[1:09:34] the presence of the pillar of fire the
[1:09:36] Bible says they were all with one Accord
[1:09:37] in one place and suddenly there came a
[1:09:40] sound from Heaven as of a rushing body
[1:09:42] wind and filled all the house where they
[1:09:43] were sitting and they're appearing to
[1:09:45] them cloven tongues like it's a fire and
[1:09:46] it's said upon each of them the pillar
[1:09:49] of fire divided itself and would set on
[1:09:51] every human being in that Upper Room
[1:09:55] and how he said brother said how did
[1:09:57] this great Pillar of Fire the angel of
[1:09:59] God the logos that went out of God
[1:10:00] explain that on Wednesday he said let
[1:10:02] the children of Israel through the
[1:10:03] Wilderness would it come among the
[1:10:04] people it separated itself and great
[1:10:07] licks of fire began to come upon each
[1:10:09] one as the pillar of fire began to break
[1:10:12] up and God dividing himself among his
[1:10:15] people remember God doesn't become less
[1:10:18] because he divides
[1:10:20] he's the only being that can do that
[1:10:23] he's infinite
[1:10:25] oh my and so when he divides himself in
[1:10:27] You by the better safe to take a
[1:10:28] spoonful out of the ocean he said it
[1:10:30] still has all the chemicals in the
[1:10:32] entire ocean does
[1:10:33] so he dwelt in each one by measure but
[1:10:36] together they were the body of Christ
[1:10:38] he said all that ought to tear the heart
[1:10:40] out of anybody God tearing himself apart
[1:10:43] that he might divide himself a little
[1:10:45] bit with each one of us that all
[1:10:46] together
[1:10:47] all together
[1:10:50] I can be just as good a Christian and
[1:10:52] stay at home a prophet of God said you
[1:10:53] can't
[1:10:55] direct quote said you can't
[1:10:58] oh my you can't
[1:11:01] now look he said God tore himself apart
[1:11:04] and together Hold On Together he said
[1:11:07] you see what it means can you see now
[1:11:08] why I'm standing for Unity of every
[1:11:10] Church
[1:11:11] every Full Gospel Church every believer
[1:11:13] we ought to be one heart one mind one
[1:11:16] Accord he said no matter how much we
[1:11:18] different in the scriptures oh but
[1:11:20] brother Ben we don't want people that
[1:11:21] are different from us now wait a minute
[1:11:23] do you believe what you believe or not
[1:11:26] yeah
[1:11:28] are you taught well or not
[1:11:30] right if I if we're not taught well
[1:11:32] enough that our home Church to be able
[1:11:34] to keep us from some little funny
[1:11:36] something that somebody brings around
[1:11:37] then then we probably shouldn't go to
[1:11:39] meetings right
[1:11:40] probably shouldn't have meetings but if
[1:11:42] you're taught well yeah and you listen
[1:11:44] to the prophet and you know the message
[1:11:46] of the hour it ought to be able to and
[1:11:48] we should I would never subject you to
[1:11:50] false Doctrine knowingly especially from
[1:11:52] the pulpit this is a place of authority
[1:11:54] and it ought to be just the authority of
[1:11:56] the word preach
[1:11:57] right but but I would never do that but
[1:12:00] when you get around people that are
[1:12:01] different that's okay
[1:12:03] I hate to tell you this but your
[1:12:05] peculiarity about it might be wrong yeah
[1:12:10] yeah oh that hurts don't it
[1:12:13] he said we how much we different in the
[1:12:14] scriptures one might see it this way or
[1:12:16] that has nothing to do with it he said
[1:12:17] but in principle we have to stand one
[1:12:19] Great Mighty Army of God marching on
[1:12:20] because each one of you in your
[1:12:22] peculiarity yeah
[1:12:25] God has proved that he's ignoring your
[1:12:27] Doctrine because he give you the Holy
[1:12:29] Ghost
[1:12:33] there's some crazies
[1:12:36] are you with me now the Holy Ghost
[1:12:38] leading God into all truth
[1:12:40] right but look how out brother Brown
[1:12:42] places just in the way of Fellowship he
[1:12:44] said he said God has proved he's
[1:12:46] ignoring your Doctrine he said he said
[1:12:48] uh he give them the holy ghost that
[1:12:49] obeyed him
[1:12:50] so if you really got the Holy Ghost
[1:12:53] right he said no if I obeyed him in my
[1:12:55] peculiar way yeah yeah and you obeyed
[1:12:58] him in your peculiar way he give us both
[1:13:00] the Holy Ghost
[1:13:02] so we ought to be Christian Brethren and
[1:13:03] sister enough to arm up together and
[1:13:05] March on for one great purpose
[1:13:07] the gospel
[1:13:11] now brother Brandon man of communion
[1:13:13] service he talked about it and I think
[1:13:14] I've read this to you before but it
[1:13:16] falls in here neatly he said but now
[1:13:18] when we come together in this way their
[1:13:20] God comes down
[1:13:22] you ever thought about that we felt the
[1:13:24] presence of the Lord in a communion
[1:13:26] service have you ever felt that says
[1:13:28] sweet Spirit of communion service we're
[1:13:29] coming together we're doing one thing
[1:13:31] one purpose that ought to be every
[1:13:33] service
[1:13:34] every service that we had but the
[1:13:36] communion brother said the communion
[1:13:37] table is actually broken bodies of the
[1:13:39] body of the lord we separate Among Us
[1:13:42] now he said now that is the literal body
[1:13:44] of the bread that we break representing
[1:13:45] the body of Christ so the bread is not
[1:13:47] the literal Body of Christ but it
[1:13:48] represents the body of Christ
[1:13:50] he said did you notice on the day of
[1:13:52] Pentecost what a great thing we have
[1:13:53] there that God who led the children of
[1:13:56] Israel through the Wilderness there's
[1:13:57] that Pillar of Fire that great Pillar of
[1:14:00] Fire on the day of Pentecost this great
[1:14:01] fire fell and then divided itself among
[1:14:03] his people
[1:14:04] oh the thing I think about it church and
[1:14:08] somebody said well brother Ben you're
[1:14:09] not going you've got the wrong Doctrine
[1:14:11] well I have the pillar of Fire
[1:14:17] and I can prove it by the word
[1:14:19] yeah they take what I believe back to
[1:14:20] the word that's all that matters isn't
[1:14:21] it yeah I may not have the same
[1:14:23] peculiarities that you do your church
[1:14:25] teaches but I have the pillar of fire
[1:14:26] yeah
[1:14:27] oh you're not going to make it but Ben I
[1:14:29] got the pillar of fire yeah how do you
[1:14:31] know that I have the Holy Ghost
[1:14:33] right
[1:14:34] now he said that he said all the things
[1:14:37] he said how he wants us
[1:14:40] he said how he wants us to sit together
[1:14:43] in Heavenly places he wants us to sit
[1:14:45] together
[1:14:46] he said then each one enjoying that
[1:14:49] warmth of the fire of the Holy Ghost the
[1:14:51] Holy Spirit cloven tongue sat upon them
[1:14:54] like fire licks of fire god dividing
[1:14:58] himself amongst the church he said oh
[1:15:00] wouldn't that though just set our hearts
[1:15:02] burning that's when we can come together
[1:15:04] in Heavenly places
[1:15:06] again he said now you see we're not a
[1:15:08] divided people we've got to be in unity
[1:15:10] because each one of us is holding a part
[1:15:12] of God and we must come together and
[1:15:15] then the pillar of fire is manifested in
[1:15:17] the wholeness and the fullness of it see
[1:15:19] don't you see the Satan fought that he
[1:15:21] fought the fullness of God coming bodily
[1:15:23] into Christ
[1:15:24] he fought it so hard he had all the
[1:15:26] babies killed and everything else why
[1:15:28] wasn't Brother David he wanted the
[1:15:29] fullness of God he tried to keep the
[1:15:31] fullness from coming into a body
[1:15:33] don't you realize he's doing the same
[1:15:35] thing today he did the same thing in the
[1:15:37] early church the devil fought every way
[1:15:39] he could to get them out of that upper
[1:15:40] room and keep them from receiving the
[1:15:42] fullness and today he tries to keep us
[1:15:44] apart
[1:15:45] because he doesn't want the fullness the
[1:15:47] wholeness of the Gospel he don't want
[1:15:49] every lick of fire in this area to come
[1:15:51] together in one place because if it ever
[1:15:53] come together in a long place we'd raise
[1:15:55] the roof off we we'd cast some devils
[1:15:57] out he don't want to be cast out
[1:16:00] he's squatting on your premises he he's
[1:16:03] sitting there he's sitting there taking
[1:16:04] what's yours and you he knows if we all
[1:16:07] got together we can kick him out and he
[1:16:09] don't want to be kicked out so he tries
[1:16:10] to keep you apart and give you a funny
[1:16:12] feeling against somebody
[1:16:20] now
[1:16:22] he said now
[1:16:24] then the pillar of fire is manifested in
[1:16:25] the wholeness and the fullness of it
[1:16:27] when this church sets together in the
[1:16:30] Heavenly places then the fullness of the
[1:16:32] power of God is in his church
[1:16:35] each one of us holding spiritual gifts
[1:16:37] and spiritual offices coming together
[1:16:39] brings that Pillar of Fire back again
[1:16:44] it's Church important absolutely
[1:16:46] our meeting's important absolutely
[1:16:51] again he said it takes the spirit of God
[1:16:53] to bring life
[1:16:55] that atmosphere what is the atmosphere
[1:16:57] it's just the presence of God
[1:16:59] the presence what is the presence the
[1:17:01] presence of the logos the purifier the
[1:17:03] word and the Spirit Worship Him in
[1:17:05] spirit and a truth together ignites the
[1:17:07] the word in our life the Holy Ghost and
[1:17:10] and as it comes together it gets bigger
[1:17:11] and gets bigger and gets bigger and it
[1:17:14] gets I'll say it this way it comes more
[1:17:16] and more towards our dimension
[1:17:18] right we gather together you come at
[1:17:21] home you can feel it but your neighbor
[1:17:22] down the road may not feel it at the
[1:17:24] same time but when you come together it
[1:17:26] just comes more and more into your
[1:17:27] dimension because he likes to have
[1:17:29] fellowship with his people
[1:17:32] look
[1:17:33] he's with you in your prayer closet he's
[1:17:36] with you because you you worship Him you
[1:17:38] Worship in Christ
[1:17:40] he's with you there but oh if we could
[1:17:43] just get together
[1:17:45] are you with me now
[1:17:47] that pillar fire comes becomes stronger
[1:17:50] you ever done that you take a fire put
[1:17:52] it on a fire put another fire on put
[1:17:53] another fire throw more sticks on and
[1:17:55] make it bigger what are you doing giving
[1:17:56] them more fuel yeah
[1:17:58] yeah the pillar of fire needs some fuel
[1:18:00] maybe that's sometimes why we don't feel
[1:18:02] it
[1:18:04] maybe that's sometimes why we don't
[1:18:06] enter in and that's sometimes why when
[1:18:08] we sit in the song service we just sit
[1:18:09] there and look at the singer well it was
[1:18:11] a good concert it's not a concert
[1:18:13] that's not what it's for it's for you to
[1:18:16] enter in it's for me to enter hand and
[1:18:18] if we ever enter in the presence and the
[1:18:20] power of God can be so real Among Us why
[1:18:23] it's got something to it's got fuel it's
[1:18:25] got something to burn
[1:18:27] that's why we keep the church quiet
[1:18:30] that's why we the deacons try to keep
[1:18:31] things in order that's why we come here
[1:18:33] and we worship and we sing the song what
[1:18:35] are we trying to do but pile up the fuel
[1:18:37] pile up the fuel because one of these
[1:18:39] days amen it's gonna light a fire
[1:18:43] oh we gotta light that fire every
[1:18:45] service every Sunday every Wednesday
[1:18:46] every meeting
[1:18:48] oh my
[1:18:49] now
[1:18:51] he said it takes the spirit of God to
[1:18:52] bring life and that life must not come
[1:18:54] out of just the intellectual Revival
[1:18:55] it's got to come out of the Bible
[1:18:57] word Revival so whether Brandon
[1:19:00] differentiates the intellectual Revival
[1:19:02] from the word Revival
[1:19:04] instead of that word it's the same
[1:19:05] yesterday today and forever and when it
[1:19:07] falls today and quickens you get the
[1:19:09] same results you did in Acts 2. he said
[1:19:12] exactly it always has it always will be
[1:19:13] because it's the spirit of God that
[1:19:15] conditions the atmosphere
[1:19:18] he said it takes atmosphere to do things
[1:19:19] that's the reason you men are always
[1:19:21] taught
[1:19:22] I'm glad he said that because we'll
[1:19:23] always teach it
[1:19:25] bring your children here
[1:19:27] so certainly that's right
[1:19:29] he said I'm glad to see my daughter
[1:19:31] Rebecca come in and sit down just a few
[1:19:32] minutes ago
[1:19:33] some of you see me weak at a woman it
[1:19:35] was my daughter she'd come in and sit
[1:19:36] down he said I want her to receive the
[1:19:38] baptism of the spirit and that's why
[1:19:40] she's here in the meeting
[1:19:42] that's what the purpose of it is it
[1:19:44] takes
[1:19:45] atmosphere we come together as well
[1:19:48] for cleansing
[1:19:50] for cleansing
[1:19:51] this is the kind of meeting that God
[1:19:53] wanted to have with Israel
[1:19:55] Isaiah 1 16 he said wash you make you
[1:19:58] clean put away the evil of your doings
[1:20:00] from before mine eyes cease to do evil
[1:20:03] learn to do well seek judgment relieve
[1:20:06] the oppressed judge the fatherless plead
[1:20:07] for the Widow
[1:20:09] hold on come now let us reason together
[1:20:11] let's have a meeting about it
[1:20:14] though your sins be a Scarlet they shall
[1:20:17] be whiter so though they be red like
[1:20:18] Michigan they shall be as well but
[1:20:20] around talked about standing out on the
[1:20:21] shore of Lake Michigan and he was
[1:20:23] watching the wakes waves coming in and
[1:20:25] the Sea wasn't jumping on the waters and
[1:20:27] jumping the boats were rocking I thought
[1:20:29] what's going on I thought why the lake
[1:20:30] is having a Revival
[1:20:32] he said it's jumping and shaking why
[1:20:34] there's a rushing Mighty Wind coming
[1:20:35] down on it I thought well you know what
[1:20:37] there isn't one more drop of water in it
[1:20:39] right now than what it was when it was
[1:20:41] perfectly steel yeah
[1:20:42] no more water in it it's just all
[1:20:44] stirred up now what's it stirred up
[1:20:46] about he said you know what the stirring
[1:20:47] up for the water does washes all the
[1:20:49] trash out of it up on the bank I don't
[1:20:52] know about you but when I get in the
[1:20:53] presence of God I begin to get like
[1:20:55] Moses I begin to repent Lord I'm not
[1:20:57] much I've not been doing what I should
[1:20:59] be doing I can see my failure this way
[1:21:01] and that way and the other you get up
[1:21:03] high enough in the presence of God you
[1:21:04] begin to recognize what you are you
[1:21:06] begin to see yourself as dirty and
[1:21:08] sinful but you know that there's a blood
[1:21:10] that takes care of all your sin so you
[1:21:12] cry out to him in the presence of God
[1:21:13] and say wash me in that blood take away
[1:21:16] my mistakes and my failures take away my
[1:21:19] sinful thoughts let me be clean oh God
[1:21:22] wash all the trash out of me
[1:21:24] so I can be right
[1:21:26] all the unbelief that's what my brother
[1:21:27] Brown said the trash was unbelief
[1:21:30] he said washing all the trash up on the
[1:21:32] bank he said what do we need is a
[1:21:33] washing of unbelief out on the bank let
[1:21:34] the word of God have preeminence
[1:21:36] that's what we need a Revival wash all
[1:21:38] the unbelief out all the bugs and
[1:21:39] superstitions and things come out and
[1:21:41] see that God is still God that's what we
[1:21:43] have revivals for
[1:21:45] he said then I think again he said
[1:21:47] that's like the lake having a Revival it
[1:21:49] shakes it and jumps it jerks it around
[1:21:50] until all the dross gets out
[1:21:53] that's just the way revivalists let us
[1:21:55] come into the spirit of the Lord and
[1:21:57] rejoice
[1:21:59] all over the bin you can't Rejoice the
[1:22:01] prophet of God said I could
[1:22:04] make wrongs right oh brother being you
[1:22:06] can't repent but the prophet of God said
[1:22:08] are good
[1:22:10] Hallelujah and a closer walk amen I
[1:22:13] believe you can't have a closer walk
[1:22:14] prophet of God said I could I'm going to
[1:22:16] believe in a word of Authority for my
[1:22:18] hour
[1:22:19] I don't read these quotes to you because
[1:22:21] I feel like it because it makes it
[1:22:23] easier to preach I got plenty of things
[1:22:25] I can preach on I read this to you
[1:22:26] because a word of authority a voice of
[1:22:29] authority spoke in our day and he said
[1:22:31] you can have Revival personal Revival in
[1:22:33] your heart
[1:22:36] amen
[1:22:39] he said
[1:22:41] reconsecration of dedication all the
[1:22:43] things and doubts of the world are all
[1:22:44] thrown out on the bank
[1:22:46] and it's a good clear running from then
[1:22:47] on
[1:22:48] The Old Ship of life begins to serve
[1:22:50] through it or you don't have to watch so
[1:22:52] much
[1:22:53] because everything is out of the way yes
[1:22:56] yes why do we have meetings we're
[1:22:58] practicing for heaven
[1:23:01] yes
[1:23:03] I know some people don't like me to make
[1:23:06] some nervous it's gonna be a hard you're
[1:23:07] gonna have a hard time in heaven yeah
[1:23:13] it's gonna be one big meeting
[1:23:16] Hallelujah
[1:23:17] this brother Branson has been in a group
[1:23:19] like this
[1:23:21] it's the closest place to heaven
[1:23:24] that there is on Earth
[1:23:27] when here we are sitting togetherness
[1:23:29] when you say well I can do that at home
[1:23:30] but not like you will in heaven
[1:23:32] because when you're in heaven all your
[1:23:34] loved ones will be there yeah imagine
[1:23:35] somebody wanting to be alone in heaven
[1:23:38] think about it for a minute
[1:23:40] I know there's some loners out there and
[1:23:42] God makes certain people different
[1:23:43] people different ways I'm not
[1:23:44] criticizing you for that some people
[1:23:46] like to be alone but when we get to
[1:23:48] heaven we are not going to be alone yeah
[1:23:51] let me say this you don't need to be
[1:23:53] alone yeah
[1:23:54] yeah and I don't mean just physically
[1:23:55] you need to know that somebody cares
[1:23:57] about you
[1:23:59] you need to know that somebody loves you
[1:24:01] you need to know you said but brother
[1:24:03] Ben I haven't seen that from from the
[1:24:05] church I haven't seen that from from a
[1:24:07] pastor I've not seen that from from
[1:24:09] anyone else but God loves you yeah
[1:24:12] and he promised in his word he would be
[1:24:13] with you
[1:24:15] right then you're not alone right
[1:24:17] right and the thing is in a meeting
[1:24:19] sometimes I'll think about this you come
[1:24:21] in and and say that I had a certain I'll
[1:24:23] use myself as an example say I had a
[1:24:24] certain issue in my life that I had
[1:24:27] something maybe that that got me down
[1:24:29] maybe my my kids are acting up or that
[1:24:31] would never happen but
[1:24:34] got trouble at work
[1:24:35] I mean I'm doubting myself
[1:24:38] you ever doubted yourself
[1:24:40] I've done that I've been there and done
[1:24:41] that you Scout yourself you wonder early
[1:24:44] belong in church
[1:24:47] they really belong I'm just being real
[1:24:48] with you this morning
[1:24:50] am I really a bride God are you real
[1:24:55] you just start to die well maybe the
[1:24:57] message you know
[1:24:59] it's such a mess you know
[1:25:01] maybe it's just not what
[1:25:03] you're alone
[1:25:05] you're alone when God dwelt Alone he
[1:25:07] said it's not good yeah
[1:25:10] you need to start having fellowship with
[1:25:12] the word yes yes you need to start
[1:25:13] having fellowship with one another
[1:25:15] you didn't start having fellowship with
[1:25:17] the church and just just force yourself
[1:25:18] sometimes sometimes you have to I have
[1:25:20] to sometimes you have to just force
[1:25:22] yourself to be about around people
[1:25:25] people are problems yes they are but
[1:25:27] it's also a way out of your problems
[1:25:30] because what happens in a meeting is
[1:25:31] I'll come there maybe I'm dealing with
[1:25:33] something no one else in my church is
[1:25:34] dealing with but somebody else will come
[1:25:35] from somewhere else
[1:25:37] and they'll have that same issue that
[1:25:39] they're dealing with and and somehow in
[1:25:42] a conversation or just just knowing it
[1:25:44] about that person it'll it'll it'll do
[1:25:46] something to me because I'll see God
[1:25:48] maybe deliver them or bring them out of
[1:25:50] that and I think oh God if you did it
[1:25:51] for them you can do it for me
[1:25:54] and it builds my faith to see they had
[1:25:56] cancer they had that diabetes they had
[1:25:58] high blood pressure but God healed them
[1:26:00] and he healed them he could heal me
[1:26:03] they struggled in this way or that way
[1:26:05] or the other they had a past they had
[1:26:07] they were out in sin but God
[1:26:09] miraculously saved why do you think he
[1:26:11] calls preachers the way he do he don't
[1:26:13] call the best of the best but he calls
[1:26:14] sometimes the worst to the worst and he
[1:26:16] calls them out and says now you go
[1:26:18] preach the gospel why because they're
[1:26:20] people who have been there and done that
[1:26:22] and they know God is a forgiver so I've
[1:26:26] done things in my life I put myself in a
[1:26:27] place where I couldn't even do that
[1:26:28] anymore I'll say this you ought to be
[1:26:30] able to testify more than anybody God is
[1:26:33] still deliver because you're still in
[1:26:34] the house of God you're still worshiping
[1:26:36] you're still praising God every one of
[1:26:38] us ought to be able to worship God for
[1:26:39] that
[1:26:42] don't let the devil get you alone
[1:26:45] he wants to talk to you alone
[1:26:48] got to tell you that was the greatest
[1:26:50] test that Jesus went through
[1:26:52] in fact you had to go through it alone
[1:26:53] you don't have to right
[1:26:57] you realize he even went through Calvary
[1:26:59] without the father
[1:27:01] without the influence of the father
[1:27:03] that warmth
[1:27:05] that we felt
[1:27:07] on Wednesday night
[1:27:10] he goes to the Cross without it yeah
[1:27:13] no feeling
[1:27:15] of God's presence yeah
[1:27:17] no feeling and can you imagine for a
[1:27:19] person who lived in that realm Jesus was
[1:27:21] a man but he lived in that realm he was
[1:27:23] also God
[1:27:25] for him who lived in that realm to be
[1:27:27] completely taken taken away from him
[1:27:30] died like a sinner
[1:27:32] can you imagine
[1:27:34] can you imagine what that must have felt
[1:27:35] like why did he do it so that you and I
[1:27:38] would never have to experience that if
[1:27:40] you're experiencing that today it's
[1:27:42] because you just need to get closer to
[1:27:43] it you don't ever have to experience
[1:27:46] being alone
[1:27:47] right
[1:27:48] it's good
[1:27:53] brother says we are already dead
[1:27:56] here we are sitting together this
[1:27:58] morning we already did Satan can't kill
[1:28:00] us we are we already did

[1:28:05] yeah he said then we are not only that
[1:28:07] we're risen again
[1:28:09] we are raised and in Christ in his
[1:28:11] resurrection we're part of it and now
[1:28:13] we're assembling together in Heavenly
[1:28:15] places in Christ Jesus see we are in him
[1:28:17] by baptism
[1:28:21] uh that means something yeah yeah we are
[1:28:24] in him by baptism see by one spirit
[1:28:26] so not water baptism but by Holy Spirit
[1:28:28] baptism we're baptized in one body and
[1:28:32] here we are now assembled the body of
[1:28:34] the Lord Jesus and the Bible when it
[1:28:37] talks about heaven and Isaiah are the
[1:28:39] Millennium it says therefore the
[1:28:40] redeemed of the Lord shall return and
[1:28:42] come with singing and to Zion it'll come
[1:28:44] with woe it's me and all of those things
[1:28:46] they come with singing why because
[1:28:48] they're gathered together that's why
[1:28:49] sometimes the spirit of the Lord moves
[1:28:51] in a special way in a meeting why we're
[1:28:53] practicing for heaven
[1:28:55] getting ready for heaven that's the way
[1:28:57] it's going to be up there
[1:28:58] God was singing and design these these
[1:29:00] musicians are going to practice this
[1:29:02] afternoon they got a job they've got
[1:29:04] more job security than I do because they
[1:29:06] got a job when they get to heaven
[1:29:09] are you with me now I may be able to
[1:29:11] sing by the bill up there as well praise
[1:29:12] God
[1:29:14] oh all the all the awkwardness will be
[1:29:17] done away with all the flatness will be
[1:29:19] done away with all the all the things
[1:29:21] like that I'd just be able to see the
[1:29:23] Praises of God
[1:29:24] won't be any critics
[1:29:27] whoa
[1:29:29] maybe I will preach
[1:29:32] you imagine singing to an audience with
[1:29:36] no critics in it
[1:29:38] it makes me want to shout and run to
[1:29:40] your house
[1:29:43] can you imagine playing an instrument
[1:29:49] it's in heaven the Bible said there
[1:29:50] would be
[1:29:51] we don't know exactly what kind they are
[1:29:53] but I don't know maybe a bass guitar I
[1:29:55] don't know what that harp was if they
[1:29:56] played back then might have been a bass
[1:29:58] guitar harp
[1:30:00] so you're gonna die if there's a if you
[1:30:02] could die in heaven you just die if you
[1:30:05] saw drums
[1:30:08] I'll say this everything was part of the
[1:30:10] word will be there
[1:30:12] right he said praise him on the loud
[1:30:14] symbols
