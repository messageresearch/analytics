I'm sorry you got stuck with me but but we'll get through it and I know it's a school night so uh I won't hold you long no longer than normal so we'll just try to get right through it if you have your bibles if we would turn to Luke chapter 17 and verse 26 Luke 17 and verse 26 it's just a simple thought tonight and I like I say I won't hold you long I know kids are back in school and and uh y'all have a good first day is it your first day today yesterday good deal and you survived did the teacher surv survive it's good to see all of you back some of you that were traveling our campers some of them back the rest of them maybe he'll be back Sunday Lord willing get on the road they don't ever want to come back home do they Brother David amen tonight Luke 17: 26 and as as as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be also in the days of the son of man they did eat they drank they married wives they were given in marriage until the day that Noah entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all and I would like to skip down to the 33rd verse whosoever shall seek to save his life life shall lose it and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it in verse 34 I tell you in that night there shall be two men in one bed and the one shall be taken and the other shall be left two women shall be grinding together the one shall be taken and the other left two men shall be in the field the one shall be taken and the other left verse 37 and they answered and said unto him where Lord and he said unto them wheresoever the body is thither will the Eagles be gathered together and you may be seated may the Lord add his blessing to the word tonight we see an age here and as it was in the days I think we can say that we are truly in those days I think we can say that we've seen those days again it was a time where there was uh sod sodomites and there was all kinds of things and it was the it was it was the going thing it was it was okay to be that way in that time and you'll see it is today it's almost a bad thing to be a good Christian family because people look down on you but but you know if you're if if if you're living like the world and you're doing like the world and you're acting like the world and and maybe you've got women marrying women and men marrying men and then it becomes a common thing that's accepted in society well you'll find that that's that's Bible days again and we'll see that there had to be someone that was called out and set aside for a time that would happen like this now now I know you a lot of people say well lot was our type but lot's not our type because lot was down there hanging out with him and the mayor of the city and and he kind of loved where he was at but if you look there you'll notice Abra was away from all this Abraham had no desire to be around this group Abraham wanted to be set aside so he could hear from the Lord Abraham was a type of what we need to be today and I believe Abraham's seed has a desire to get out of here can you say Amen Abraham's seed has no desire to stay in this world any longer I know we live here and I know we've got to stay here and and work among the world and and you know you want the nicest house and the nicest car and those things are good but in that time when you see that becomes the main f focus and that becomes the main thing and you start to see where where the world is is going it's groping in darkness it's grouping in darkness it is a time where everything is coming uh to aead everything is coming to its total Destruction but there's a group of people here that are set aside and are getting ready to leave this world now where will these people be they'll be sitting there and they'll be feeding on the body word of the son of man now brother Brandon would say it like this he said he said now anyone who has the slightest bit of the real Spirit of of God in them can feel the hot blast of the oncoming judgment in your spirit you can discern and know that there's something fixing to happen how many can say Amen to that there's something going on and he said there's something fixing to happen the whole world is quivering the little Nations and the big Nations for the hands of the Communist and the ungodly and the bloodless and the heartless and the Cults and lays the power to send this world to its ashes in one minute's time it's here we're at the time now where all it would take is just a button or or or just a just an order for from a from a world leader that is completely gone insane and what you would see as you would see this world completely destroyed now now I'm not trying to paint a bleak picture here tonight because I want to show you what the world is coming to but I want you to also recognize that you are not of this world you are just in this world you are not partakers of the plagues that are to come you are not partakers of the Wrath that is coming well come on somebody you're not here for the tribulation there's somebody that is here for a Rapture but I want to show you the time when all this is going to take place now he said there he said just the mercies of God being longsuffering is all that's holding it we can become Russia satellite before in the morning and yet we don't notice it we just go right on and they don't know they don't know what about what all this nervous condition's about and when the world is becoming neurotic even the psychiatrists themselves are having nervous breakdowns the natural will never be able to interpret the supernatural he said neither could The Magicians and the astrologers ever read the handwriting on the wall it took the Spirit-filled man of God to do so and those as olers could not read the unknown tongue see the worldly churches don't see where we are the the government don't know where we are but if you've been in this message and you've read your Bible and the spirit of God has come into you then you know your day you know your hour and you know that the message must come in this time and the revealing of the son of man had to come he said they've Dilly DED along in big things of rock and roll parties and B uh shindigs in their churches and cold formal sermons well come on somebody it's not time for a cold formal no more it's not time to just have just have another another gathering so that we can see how many people's going to show up no it's time that we start feeding on the word of God again and let the word of God get us ready for a Rapture let the word of God change these bodies because that's what it's going to take can you say amen and the gospel has been neglected and they know nothing about the Supernatural Well that's where the world's at that's the condition they're in and that's that's exactly how it's supposed to be now that's not Doom and Gloom for the bride because we can see the world getting in condition for us to go take a Rapture well I know they're going down I I tell you what and and you say well I'm worried about my loved ones I'm worried about my family well I say we ought to pray for them and and we need to try to get them to church if we can and we need to try to call out their names before the Lord but if you'll just have faith of Abraham then you won't lose a one of them to the oncoming storm you won't lose one of them to this destruction that's coming because you and your house shall be saved you're not going to lose them I I tell you what you say what if they're here in the tribulation just pray for their soul that when your body's changed you can see them on the other side I I tell you however they make it is okay with me I I yes I want them to go through the through the Rapture just like I want to go in the Rapture and I want to see every one of you go in the Rapture but let's just pray that they make it however they make it we want to pray for the souls listen there's going to be many saved there's going to be many lots that are going to be saved but they're not going to be like Abraham that are set aside and and waiting for the Rapture to come waiting for the body change believing in the promise of God now some of you young people you're you're going to you're going to hear this as you get older if the Rapture don't come in the next 5 years the next 10 years the next 15 years what you're going to hear is well we've heard this all our life and it's just not going to happen well you know what you're an Abraham seed and Abraham heard for 25 years you're going to have a baby it's going to happen the promise is coming but it did come and it will come well come on somebody it will come in someone's generation if it's not your generation brother Bill then it may be my generation if it's not in my generation it may be in one of my children's generation but it's going to happen just as sure as I'm standing here it will happen so I say let's let's drop the negativity I know the scientists are saying well it's not going to happen we've been here for millions of years and and you know there's nothing to all this fanaticism there's nothing to the message of the hour but I want to point you back to a time as in the days of Noah when there was a bunch of people who heard the same sermon over and over over and over over and they said it's not going to happen it's not going to happen but somebody was preparing to get on a boat I say somebody has got to be preparing to get out of this place I'm not going through a tribulation I'm not going to be here when the bombs are falling I'm not going to be here and leave my children in this condition I said I'm taking them with me in a Rapture can you say amen I tell you what I think we need some people to get on fire for God in this message and start setting ourselves aside whether it's Sunday morning Sunday night Wednesday night and start are taking ourselves out of this world and set aside with God and hear the voice of God and let God speak to your heart again I think we become so accustomed to the things of the world that if we can just come to church and we we we you know we dot our eyes and cross our tees and well I did my due diligence for the week no no there's an Abraham group that is just they're longing to get out of here they can't wait to get out of this place and they're doing everything they can to get ready for it I say that's you tonight you that are set aside you little fock that are gathered together and feasting on the body word of the son of man you are the ones tonight you are the ones that are going in a Rapture it's not going to be the ones going out here and they have to have a program for this age group and a program for that age group and well can you say man you got to have something for the seniors you got to have a Bunko game and and a bingo game and you got to have a party for this and a party for that no what we want is the word of God and the services again I'm not against I'm not against having good things in the church and programs in the church I'm not against that but the main attraction ction to the believer is where the word is the Eagles will come and feast on that word where the body son where the body word of the son of man is that's where we are feasting today and brother Brandon would say it like this he said it seems to me that men who are made in the image of God feeling this great pressure coming on should go to safety can you say Amen but they don't do it they won't listen though the warning voice of God speaks day after day night after night but men desires to live in sin you know it's late than we think can you say amen he said you know it's later now this is in 1958 by the way it's later than we think you you look at the you look at the trajectory of the world from the time that brother Brandon was here on Earth to where it is now and you can see a world that is going into total chaos and coming destruction but you know what it is we're looking at it and we're thinking well it's been this long it just couldn't happen but think about it Sarah might have thought that but the baby came anyway think about it somebody's going to be sitting there and going to think well it's not going to happen and they're going to be looking for you and you're going to be gone and then they're going to be saying well why why didn't we wait for the Rapture to come see God doesn't do it in your time or in the way the world would think it should come but God is going to come exactly on time with his program and take home who is ready to meet him at that day I tell you I just want to be ready if he comes next year if he comes in the next 5 minutes if he comes in 10 years 20 years if I'm a 100-year old man I want to stand here and say is coming he's coming back for me he's coming back for you if I see Elders go by the way of the Grave then they're going to rise first because I believe in a Rapture and I know it's coming now listen I know there's people today that are attacking the Rapture they're saying the Rapture is nothing it's not going to happen and they're saying well there's no Bible for it I'm going to tell you right now there is Bible for it the dead in Christ shall rise first it will not hinder those well come on somebody it will not hinder you that are awake it will not hinder me brother Bill if if the if the Lord carries another 50 years then your body is going to come up before mine but I'll tell you what I just want to be ready and be among those few that when my loved ones start to appear I want to be able to see them how about you I don't want to stay here when the bombs are coming listen nobody should be getting ready for tribulation if you know this message and if you see where you are then you need to be getting ready for the oncoming storm but don't be ready to stay here be ready to look up because your Redemption draweth not your redemption's coming in the morning I tell you what you've heard it said between 6:00 and 9 I don't care when he comes whenever he comes I want to be ready whatever that Prophet said I'm going to hold to it why because in every generation there was a prophet with the word of the Lord you say you can call me crazy for saying I believe what a prophet said I believe what a prophet said I believe every word of it why because if as in the days of Noah the unbelievers didn't make it on the boat come on somebody the ones that doubted the promise of Abraham they never never saw the promise fulfilled but it was the ones who would stay there and the promise would come to pass it was Enoch who who would come and and he would walk with God all of his days he would be translated that's our type right there if you walk with God and stay in the message of the hour then you will never face death and if you would go by way of the Grave you still didn't face death so I say tonight it's time that we quit looking at the destruction that's coming but we start looking up because when we see the destruction coming we know that our time's coming too our time's coming too we don't have to worry about what's going on around is if we know who we are brother R said it like this he said it's later than we think he said the scriptures declares it's later than we think Jesus said as it was in the days of Noah and the days of lot so shall it be in the coming of the son of man let us see what's taking place in the days of the coming of the destruction and the Judgment the days of Noah and the days of lot they were both affiliated with the Third destruction Jesus said just as it were in those days so will it be when the son of man comes the second time it'll be just like it was then now we can see where we're at we anybody that's got any Supernatural understanding or any Spirit about them can see where we are brother M would go on to say he said we're taught that in the days of Noah not only at that time but in the days of lot is Junction times and every time before judgment comes to the Earth and this is where I want to get to tonight God always sends a mercy call he could have never sent judgment had he not sent Malachi 4 that showed us a way to get out of here he could have never sent judgment to this earth until he first come and warned America said this is your last chance this is this is your last warning he had to come and preach the invasion of the United States he had to come with a message that would get a bride ready well come on somebody he had to come or we could never have a Rapture because that part of the scripture had to be fulfilled first and when he came now we can look forward and say that scripture's been fulfilled and now the rest is going to be fulfilled and we know well come on somebody we are blessed to know what we know and to see what we've seen and we're not looking down at this world we're not Earthbound we're not a chicken we're not down here looking around at what else we can peck on and who we can hurt and and and what what we can make down here we can get a better Coupe Hallelujah but I tell you what we can do we can look up and you'll hear the voice of Mama Eagle someday and it's time to get out of here it's time to go home brother Bill it could come tomorrow you could still see this Rapture you could still see it you could still see it I don't care if you're 100 years old sitting here tonight you could still see it because I believe we are that close to the coming of the Lord now I I know people say what you've been saying I heard a brother I I say he's a brother he used to be in the message years ago and I was talking to him down in Hot Springs and he he said I've been I've been hearing about the rapture since I was a little boy and here I'm in my 50s and and I said well I said here's the problem with quitting believing that is someday it's actually going to happen and then if you've quit looking for it you're not going to be ready when he comes and he said well he said that may be he said but you know even if you go through the tribulation I said buddy you don't want to be here in the tribulation if you really know what's going on in the tribulation quit looking for the tribulation to get you out of here and start looking up I say it's time we start looking up what about you Word of Life we need to qu looking at what's around us and I tell you it's nice to have a good car and a good job and all those things but that's all temporary and when the Rapture comes those things are all going to be left behind anyway but I'm telling you what's going to get out of here and what is your Eternal thoughts tonight it is can I take my family with me can I be ready myself can I go on a Rapture can I be like he not can never taste death that's what the bride wants to do that's where we're looking for we are not looking around and see how the biggest church or if we can do this better or that better no we're not looking for more programs we are looking for a Rapture that's what the bride's looking for sir brother R said it like this he said Enoch he sent an angel he sent a message God sent a prophet to the Earth named Enoch and he said what what did man do they ate and they drank and they planted they build they they rejected the call of the message and I would like to go on and say this it's not wrong to build it's not wrong to plant your potatoes or it's not wrong to do that but don't let that hold you here and don't be like well I hope the the Lord holds a Rapture I'm no all we're looking for as Believers is a Rapture if he comes before I get my new car praise the Lord for it if he comes before I get my house built praise the Lord for it I say if he comes before anything else happens praise the Lord for it I'm not looking to build a kingdom here but I'm looking for a kingdom to come I'm looking for someone to come for me why because I'm ready I I I want to lay in this message and lay in the presence of the son that's what's going to get you out of here can you say amen he said they were turning it down what did we find them doing laughing scoffing making fun marrying wives living in adultery building planning that's what you'll find that's the church world but that's not you that's the church world uh there's never been a time where the message was under attack like it is now if you go back and look to the men who actually were with brother brandham and men who didn't even disagree with him they spoke very highly of brother brandham and they would actually testify of the great things that God was doing in his ministry but now you get somebody that's got a YouTube channel and they decide they can go after the Vindicated prophet of the hour and tell you you know what we we don't believe him because he he we don't have any proof of this well you don't have any proof of Noah you don't have any proof of Jesus you don't have any proof that the Bible exists but you believe it because Believers have faith to believe the word that has already happened listen I'm not looking for proof I'm looking for Rapture I'm not looking for somebody to theologically explain how the message is right or how the message is wrong but what I'm looking for is a Vindication of the scriptures that said the dead in Christ shall rise first I want to see my loved ones coming I'm not looking for some YouTube channel to tell me who's right and who's wrong what you've got is you've got a bunch of unbelievers sitting around with keyboard Warriors and and I'll tell you what when the destruction comes I guarantee you they're going to be wishing they were right there with you but you know what they're doing they they're so brave because they can't see the message listen I don't wish any ill on them but I know who we are I know where we're going I know this message is right and I will not be talked out of it come on somebody if you were talked into this message you can be talked out of it but this is a revelation to me I can't see nothing else no more why because I I quit looking I quit looking I don't even look for the sights anymore I don't even want to go look and and say where was brother Brandon's mistakes I could care less if he was a man and made mistakes what I'm looking at is word excuse me the word that was promised to come and it has come and it is is getting a bride ready so I'm not looking for another Prophet I'm not looking for another I'm not looking for another time another church age messenger I'm not looking for another Revival but the Revival that we're in now is a word revival can you say Amen it is a word Revival now brother B said it like this he said now he said each message both lot and Noah their message consisted of this grace mercy and Deliverance Grace God's mercy to the people was uh was presented through Grace and deliverance was presented to the people but they turned it down what do we find them doing laughing and scoffing that's what we find them doing now what was it it was the unbelievers calling the message of the hour false you know history repeats itself if you were a scoffer now if you are a scoffer now you would have been a scoffer in Noah's day you would you would have been you would have been laughing at Abraham when he was old when an old man about ready to have a baby you would have laughed at him well let's just go ahead and call it like it is you say well I'd have believ that no you wouldn't have been a Believer then either because you you're an elect to believe and you can't help but believing this day you see where we're at church it's later than you think it is this is the people that are overcoming not by being proved that the message is right but by a revelation that they can see the evening light is here and the Rapture is at hand can you say Amen said most of the time we try to bring this message our words seem like the to the world as just like lots did to his kin folks it seems to me that were mocking to them or they were Idle Words Their pastors either bypassed this great message of Deliverance or tried to explain it out into another generation to come listen close but the facts of it is the Angel of the Lord is present to confirm the word and manifest the power of the Holy Ghost and these signs shall follow so somebody say these signs shall follow these signs shall follow them that believe they tried to Mock and they said to lot why they just made fun of lot his own Kindred and lot was just a man the Bible said that their sins vexed his righteous Soul daily to see the perversion and this nation is loaded with it the the misusing of the human body and when it's on the Rampage alcoholics dope uh dop addicts and teenage juvenile delinquency just like it was then and Men mock at it and when they see the supernatural signs of the Lord they they try to say that we're mocking religion these crazy people are trying to tell us we're the ones crazy yeah someone said us long ago wrote me a letter to brother Bram speaking he said some great doctor of divinity said Mr brandham get next to yourself you're trying to impersonate the Lord Jesus said you're only making a mock he said how little this poor decrepit man knew that it's not a man that can do that it's the sign of the end time oh can you say amen he he said it's a sign of the end time he's and he's fulfilling it but they mocked at lot they said oh don't listen to him that man's crazy how could this great place be destroyed how could Sodom and Gomorrah the greatest City you known to Earth how could it be destroyed with fire and brimstone they say today how could this world be burned over how could the world be destroyed oh look at our military look at look at what we've got we we're bigger we're greater we're more powerful no you're not there there's somebody raising up right now that has the ability to take this world out and if you see the government is so corrupt now it could be your own government do it well come on somebody money is the money is the root of all evil the love of money is the root of all evil and what you're seeing now is you can pay off any politician that's running I tell you I know I know I know I'm in Trump country so I won't say nothing bad about him but listen anybody that's in brother bam said you could put an Abraham Lincoln in there you could put a George Washington in there and that's not going to restore this country I'm not saying it wouldn't make it better financially for a while and that's why you vote and you go down to the pools and do what you do but here's what I'm going to say to you tonight that's only going to be temporary you can vote the best president in You Got What maybe four years you might have eight years but what you've got after that you may just have another I tell you one of these days is going to be the final president and I don't care what party they are they're going to be right there when the world goes into total chaos and destruction well come on somebody that is not what we're looking to for our Salvation we are looking to the word and the message of the hour because that is where the hope of the believer rest that's what we look for I I I listen I'm you know I'm not trying to get into politics you you know I understand there's there's there's worse principles in one than the other and I get all that but listen let's not look let's not look to that for our Salvation let's not you know we we we can argue about that all we want to but let's get our families let's show them let's not try to convert them from Democrat to Republican let's try to convert them from what they are to the message of the hour because that's the only way they're getting out of here alive everything else is just temporary everything your new car your best job your your your good clothes everything's temporary everything we have here this is temporary this is not going to last through the tribulation but you are because you're not going to be there well come on somebody you're not going to be there this is your promise this message has come to call you out of where you are and take you to a place where it's already been promised of that I tell you what there's a city already built there's a house already made that wasn't made with hands but I'll tell you what there's there's a house there and there's a city and there I tell you what there's Jasper walls and I tell you what this place where we're going cannot be described in the English language but it is a place that is Everlasting Joy Everlasting peace there's no more sorrow there's no more death and I tell you the way to get there for the bride of Christ is without ever tasting death you may never have to taste death you could go in the moment in the twinkling of an eye and caught up forever and be changed to our Lord I tell you that's the hope of the believer that's the hope of the message of the hour that's what I believe that's what Believers believe Believers are not looking to stay here brother R said God be merciful to this poor miserable blind wretched and naked Nation that's what they are it it's just it's a place that has already been you know it's been condemned if you're looking for Revival among the the modern churches I would say it's over for them now I I it's not over for us this Revival that we are in for the bride will never end there's a Revival there's a cycle of death there's a cycle of life and a cycle of death and a it's over and over brother Gabe it's it's a it's it's life and death over and over but this bride Revival was a word Revival and the word can never die see we are not we are not just here listen I I I believe in shouting I believe in dancing I believe in speaking in tongues but that is not what the bride is looking for th those things will follow the Believers those things can happen but the bride is looking to the word to change their bodies I believe when the bride sees that word I believe they may jump and they may shout and I tell you what it's hard to hold your peace when you can see that the word of God is about to change your body just like it did Abraham and Sarah but listen what it is we're not looking for the signs to vindicate us but we're looking for the word and the signs will follow the word not the not the word following the signs because well not many in that day will they not say well I have not I done this and have not I done that and have not I cast out demons listen there's going to be many do that but under this message the message is what's Vindicated and the signs will follow the messenger always in the message brother R said I want you to notice something just for a moment that comes to my mind Before Destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah we find that God had a prophet up on top of the mountain by the name of Abraham and he had given him a promise and he was willing to take the hard way way and preach the real true word than to live in sin that's what we need now we need to be willing I I'm not saying that we cut people off and hurt people no but see Abraham Abraham didn't ever he wasn't the one that pulled himself away but lot did Abraham had to separate himself from unbelief but he said you can take this or you can take that you you you it's whatever you want because I'm going to stay here I'm going to go over here where the Lord is already provided I I you know you're not going to get out of this world you're going to have to rub shoulders with the world tomorrow you're going to be in school with worldly kids that have no idea what we believe and what we're talking about but can I go ahead and just say this for a minute it I'm I'm not I'm not really concerned about that I'm concerned about you and what is your response to the world what is your response when the world laughs at you what are you going to do think about it if you were in Noah's day and they laughed at you would you have said well okay we're we're just going to stay over here and you know we don't we don't we don't want to get on that boat there's a lot of animals on there and it smells funny we don't have to go to church in this day to be a believer and it's true you don't have to go to church to be a believer but a Believer will go to church and a Believer will not a Believer will not laugh and make fun of the message of the hour I would say it like this a Believer is not going to persecute the message of the hour when you hear a preacher that all they can preach is brother Brandon's mistakes I say watch out for the man I just I'm just saying it like it is tonight I'm not worried about the mistakes of Abraham when the commentary of his life was written the mistakes were never mentioned I'm not pointing to a man's mistakes I'm pointing to the message that he brought I'm pointing to the message that he brought I'm not saying he wasn't human he was human he was human I think we can agree on that but I'm not pointing you to the humanity of William brandom I'm pointing you to what God sent in this day and that was a Vindication that the son of man would come again in the days that we see that are happening I say we are that ought to excite the bride that ought to make us think thank the Lord for sending a prophet thank God for sending Elijah in this time because we can see scripture being fulfilled in a humble Kentucky man I'm not looking for his mistakes come on somebody I'm not looking to point out where he was right and where he was wrong but I can point you to the message it wasn't a message of a man it was the message that God sent for us in this time I think we need to quit looking at our ourselves and saying well you know I I I I think we need to quit looking at the man part so much and and trying to point out mistakes Even in our brothers Even in our preachers in the message I think we need to quit doing that why because what we're doing is we're just setting the our kids up for failure we're setting our kids up for a time where where our kids are going to be like well I mean if there's a full of mistakes and and if we can't even trust the man for this and I tell you what we've done we preached our young people right out of the church I say it's time we quit pointing to the mistakes in the message and start pointing to the word that has come it is a Vindicated word by a Vindicated Prophet that has come to get a people that have been called for such a time as this can you say Amen brother R said the scripture speaking Sarah I'm almost done I promise no nobody nobody believes me I'm sorry Abraham I I'll prove you I prove you wrong tonight Sarah was be 89 so many years ago it ceased to be with her as it was with women but yet Abraham held on for he knew that God was able to keep his promise can you say amen he was faithful he stayed by the word the word the word that God had spoken to him that's how Angels appear to people is when you stay by the word not by man-made theology but by the word thus sayith the Lord that's when the Angels appear well can you say Amen Abraham stayed by the word and while he was sitting under the oak one day he saw three men coming up and he was spiritual for he knowed that God was still God and as these men begin to appear Abraham run out to meet them and says sir stop in just a moment and let me fetch you just a little water to wash your feet and I'll make you a cake and and you can refresh yourself and then you can be going for this cause you have come out now brother brandom goes on to say this watch the nature of this Angel bringing the last message Before Destruction he said Abraham I'm going to keep my promise to you I love that that's Our Father God he had no beginning of days no ending of days well come on somebody he was more than able to keep the promise because he wasn't born like you're born he he didn't die like you die but this was a man who never knew no beginning and never had an end and he's the same God that was vindicating himself night after night meeting after meeting in a prophet it was the it was not the man it was God revealing himself through the man and I would say today that's the same just like brother brandom said that's our Father God I'm not pointing you to brother brandom I'm not pointing you to another messenger I'm not pointing you to another pastor but I'm pointing you to a message and the messenger that brought it would would yield himself to the message of the hour and would bring you a message to get you out of this world that ought to make somebody happy because we're not going to stay here in the tribulation I hope somebody's hearing me tonight the message had to come so that you could have a way out I know it's Wednesday night and you're tired and I'm screaming at you but we'll be all right listen because the word is here it's not something I could bring brother Ben never brought the word you can name any of your favorite preachers they never brought the word but but God sent the word for the hour and God will use the men that he chooses to use God will use the whatever method he uses to get this word out God is still God that's our father that's the one who can speak and he can every promise every promise he's ever promised will come to pass can you say amen he said it was a dark time for Abraham his faith was being tested his faith was being tested he held on to his testimony all those years but then the angel showed up and said I'm going to keep my promise well that was a good day for Abraham he was starting to see some Vindication of a promise now he said now we find that in those hours of real stress that's usually when the spirit of God moves in he let the Hebrew children walk right into the fiery furnace but he but he never moved a hand but when he moved he moves I like that when he moved he moves it might be just right there at that moment when they're ready to push the button for the bombs to come but that's when you'll be caught up to meet your lord I tell you that ought to make somebody happy tonight that we will not be here when the bombs are coming we are not going through the destruction why because you are Abraham's seed look over at somebody and say you're Abraham's child every one of you every one of you you say well that's a long time ago but God protected that seed all through Every Generation generation after generation until in this day he would see another person another group of people another people that needed the faith of Abraham are you hearing me you needed that Faith to get out of here because there's going to be a lot of people trying to talk you out of the message message of the hour there's going to be an evil spirit here and an evil spirit there and they're going to come after our young people and our old people and our married couples and well come on somebody those devils are not here just to play around they're here to try to stop you from making a Rapture but we know who we are we know in whom we have believed and he is more than able to keep that which he's promised and I'm not going to I'm not going to stop believing now just because it's been this long or that long listen I'm still a young man but some of you have been believing this message for a really long time but you just hold on just hold on because it's going to be worth it all when you start to see those bodies change and your loved ones changing listen I know the message is under attack but I'm here to Proclaim this message is a Biblical message and it is still true that's right I don't care if he comes in your generation I don't care when he comes listen I I know I know people put a put a limit on God but I say take the limit off of God I say take the limits off of him because if you're putting a time limit on him I can show you hundreds of years and prophecies after prophecies but from Isaiah and Jeremiah and even times when Jesus would come David prophesied things they had no idea what the prophecy meant they had no idea what he was talking about but when they saw the Fulfillment of the prophecy they could look back and say this day that scripture is being fulfilled before your eyes and I can say we can see as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be I can say this day that scripture has already been revealed come on somebody we're already seeing the world in that condition we're already seeing it just like it was then when you can see that the natural affection of a man is different and the natural affection of a woman is different if you can't see that then you've never read your Bible but this is that time and it's time for the brid group to be getting ready for the promised son to come this is your time this is your time now get out of here before I before I make myself a liar again now we find that in those hours of real stress that's when God moves he moves he said now I'm going to go on down here ways he said now Jesus promises here that in the last days the son of man will be revealed again in that same type of group The Royal Seed of Abraham just before the fire falls remember the church never received any more witnesses Abraham and them didn't the promised son that they were looking for was brought right away after that and the church is looking for the promised son he will come right after the days of this ministry that's what a prophet said and I say Amen to it he will come right after the days of this ministry he didn't say he's coming right now he said he's coming right after the days of this ministry I tell you what in the days of the voice I'm here I'm ready I'm listening I know the message has come he said now he'll come right after he said he'll be revealed from the heavens now we see it too plain it's got to be if you're a Bible reader you can see it as plain in the scripture listen there are people the only way way that the denominational churches are able to Discount this is they have to say the Bible is wrong the only way that you can say that God was not going to send a Malachi for a prophet you have to say the Bible was wrong can you say Amen if if you say well as it was in the days of Noah well that was that was just their their opinion well then the whole Bible's just an opinion but something's got to be our absolute something's got to be right and I say this Bible is still right and wrong I'm going to take the Bible over a theological explanation every day of the week I'm going to take this Bible and this message that has come with a Vindicated Prophet every day of my life until the coming of the Lord why because I know who I am and whom I've had believed and he is more than able to bring a Rapture for me he's more than able Brother David to bring a Rapture for you he's more than able brother Gabe just what he's done in your life and sister Millie's life that same God that could do that is the same God that's going to cause a body change in these people same God when the doctor says no baby God says there's going to come a baby when the doctor said Abraham and Sarah was too old there come a baby anyway it's not always when you want it but it'll be right on time Moses he didn't want to deliver those children but God spoke to him in a burning bush he didn't want to go but he had to go Moses had heard of him being the great Jehovah but then he could see him he was in the form of a pillar of fire I've heard of you but now I see you what was he seeing in his word Vindicated oh that's what we need to look at tonight let's start looking at the word that's what's Vindicated not a man not me not you but the word is Vindicated and we become part of that word oh come on somebody he said he would bring them out with a mighty hand he said now notice he said the burning bush gave indication to what the prophet Abraham had said would take place I've heard of it but now I see it he said now we've heard that in the last days the son of man will will come among his people and reveal himself to the people in the same way he did that just before the destruction of Sodom and the son of man what did he do he know the secrets that was in Sarah's heart also give the promise to Abraham Abraham had heard God's Voice come on somebody how many's heard the voice of God today he might have seen him in different ways I don't know how he talked to him through dreams or through prophecies but this time he saw him he said I've heard of you but now I see you and the church has heard of God they've read of him and what he did and he promised but now we see him with our own eyes just like job did I've heard of you but now I see you my what it difference we we may not have had the faith of Abraham in the first six six Church ages but now we have seen the Vindication of scriptures in our time and we can say he is more than able because because he has kept that part of the promise and he's faithful somebody say he's faithful to keep that which he's promised in this day he said my he said Moses had a crisis and cried out and he said we find out Exodus 14 13th and the 16th verse he said Moses in that great strain there were the children of Israel inspiration struck him and he said what he was supposed to say not knowing he said stand still and see the salvation of God God had never spoke to him yet the inspiration struck him and they said why did you bring us out here we ought to have died in Egypt was it because there was no Graves down there bring us out here and let us die he said we could have lived in peace as slaves until we died but you brought us out here and Moses the prophet knowing he had access to God was inspired and he said stand still and you'll see the salvation of God for the Egyptians you're looking at today you'll never see them again the world that's looking at you that is trying to laugh at what you believe and make fun of you there'll come a day when you'll never see them again but what you'll see is him coming in the Clouds Of Glory for a people that is getting ready oh I wish somebody preach with me here for a minute you'll never see your enemy again when you get ready to get out of here I tell you what every one of them is laughing every one of them that's making fun they everyone dead but you have went into the land you have promised you have you have taken hold of the promises of God why it's the message of the hour that called you out and it's the same message that that will take you in can you say Amen it's not a message that has come with with just another another slant to an old Doctrine but this is a message that come with a certain time and a certain people in mind and it has come for a prepared people for a Rapture I say let's just get ready let's look up for your Redemption is drawing nigh your Redemption is coming well can you say Amen I'm going to I'm going to finish reading this and we'll try to get out of here he said God tells you what to do rise up and start walk he said it's all over when you can do it that way that's the way God does it when you see God manifested now through yourself he said it was God that told him to do it now all that was present all of Israel that was present saw the inspiration that struck Moses they seen God with their own eye blow that water back from one side to the other that Pillar of Fire LED them right across the sea he heard of God then they seen God and Joshua was in an hour of crisis when the armies was routed and the sun was going down now Joshua was a prophet and he knew that if the armies ever had a chance to unite again and come against him he would lose more man he knew that they were they were powerful armies they could come against him he said but there's only one thing if he could keep them running he'd WRA him everyone down but there wasn't enough light to do it so Joshua stood and raised his hands and said Son stand still and a moon hang over aelon till I get through with this battle and the son stood still and they heard Joshua speak and then they seen God with their own eyes in action now they had heard but now they could see oh come on somebody that ought to bring some faith in some people this is not an age where we just have to say I've heard about Moses I've heard about Elijah but I have seen in this day a Vindication that this message is real and it is the same message that brought the children of Israel out it is the same message that took them into the promised land and it's the same one that called you out of dead trespasses and sins and it's the same one that's going to take you in a Rapture can the church say Amen can the church say amen that's what you're looking for that's what the message is that's what it is it's a coming out and a going in the same message the same God we have heard but now we can see it is a message of Deliverance if you can believe it tonight it is a message of Deliverance the ones that didn't believe they couldn't follow but let me tell you if you can follow this message it is a message of complete and total Deliverance to you and to your household now I'm going to just read this and I'll close musicians go ahead and come my time is up it looks to me like if a man had any kind of spirituality he said the spirit of God him when he seen the Lord Jesus do just what he said he would do it would thrill his heart in such a way that he couldn't hold his peace any longer he would set the nation of fire with this message I wonder how many people we've got tonight that could set the nation of fire with this message message and say come see a man who not only told me but now I see can you say Amen it will be he said he said so it will be the message that went forth they merely laughed at it and mocked at it as someone who was telling some kind of an idol Tale But it it was a mercy and it was of Grace and it it was of Deliverance can you say amen and the angel said that morning to lot after he had given the message he said hasten and come hither for I can do nothing until thou Hast come hither I want you to notice this now he said we have to cut it short here he said I can't do nothing till you come hither what was it it was a message of Deliverance and before one Speck of fire could fall from Heaven La had to get out of Sodom and before one drop of rain fell from heaven Noah went into the ark and before the atomic bomb conract this nation the church will go in the Rapture can you say amen and he said to meet the Lord Jesus and if the Sputnik and the missiles are set he said and the Hammers are pulled back and the angels are all standing in order he said the great corridors of heav are crowded full the harps are all in tune the great bands are already practiced up oh sounds like a meeting to me doesn't it you he said and to think we've had part in this Junction of time remember so shall it be in the coming of the son of man when the son of man is being revealed from heaven now remember before the rain fell Noah was in the ark he said I think that's exactly the angel of Destruction is holding the hand of Russia with the atomic bombs until the church comes together and one great body of Christ I can't do nothing until you come hither I say tonight the message has already come we heard about it we've seen it we can actually turn on a DVD in this day or turn on a YouTube video on this day and see the same signs and wonders that were done then again in our day I say we should have no reason to disbelieve I say if let the faith of Abraham arise in the people today let the faith of Abraham speak through your mouth and say I believe this message no matter what the doubters say no matter what the Skeptics say I believe it with all my heart heart and this message is going to take you home can you say Amen let's stand to our feet tonight brother Brandon would say it like this I want to read this if you just play something softly he said oh children don't sit stooped and wondering hurry quick the time is at hand he said run out like the little birds did get away from these big modern walls of Babylon and these big old denominations that say there's no difference at the time these big old unbelieving churches that says there's no such thing as Divine Healing there's no Miracles get away from them walls for they're going to crumble they're going down in destruction and defeat cuz my God said so run out in the middle of the calvary Yonder if the birds went to the trees you go to the trees too he said and they hang in the middle of his mercy and cry to God until the storm has passed I wonder how many tonight can say Lord I I've been guilty of doubting I've been guilty of trying to trying to run away and hide but this day I'll say I stand with this message of the hour I stand with the message that has come that message is going to get you out of here church that message message is what's going to deliver you this is the message of Deliverance this is the time of Deliverance I believe the Rapture is right here close to hand I wonder how many beliefs out here tonight I believe it's coming I don't care how soon be ready for when it comes be ready for when it comes he said hurry Escape for I can't do nothing until you come out he's waiting on you to get ready for a Rapture he's waiting on you he said oh it's later than you think the hour is ah hand the Angel's Mercy the angel of Mercy who sent his message is right here tonight and brother random asked this question do you believe it I believe it here tonight I believe the angel of mercy and Grace is here I don't believe every I don't believe a one of you
