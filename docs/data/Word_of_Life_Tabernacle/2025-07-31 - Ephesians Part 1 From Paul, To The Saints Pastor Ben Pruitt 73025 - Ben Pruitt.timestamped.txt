[37:56] that are out traveling, vacation, stuff
[37:58] before school starts, you kids ready for
[38:00] school? Boy, I didn't get a very

[38:09] uh sure appreciate our our young ones.
[38:11] And as brother Joel said, we have
[38:13] communion on Sunday night. So, remember
[38:15] that. Ephesians chapter 1. I want to go
[38:18] to the book of Ephesians. We've preached
[38:20] out of it before, but I've never taken
[38:23] the book and just did a study on it.
[38:25] We're going to do that, Lord willing, uh
[38:28] over the next weeks, a few weeks. And uh
[38:31] maybe that'll be something that we can
[38:34] uh pull together on and and just study
[38:37] the word of God and and so you'll have
[38:39] time to read it. It's not a long book.
[38:41] You'll have time to read it and study
[38:43] it. And also the adoption series if you
[38:45] go to that where brother Brandon
[38:46] preaches adoption number one through
[38:48] number four in 1960. If you want to go
[38:51] listen to that, it'll have a lot of what
[38:53] we're going to say in that as well.
[38:54] Ephesians chapter 1 and verse one, Paul
[38:58] an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will
[39:01] of God to the saints which are at
[39:03] Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ
[39:05] Jesus. Grace be to you and peace from
[39:08] God our Father and from the Lord Jesus
[39:10] Christ. Blessed be the God and Father of
[39:13] our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed
[39:15] us with all spiritual blessings in
[39:19] heavenly places in Christ, according as
[39:22] he hath chosen us in him before the
[39:25] foundation of the world. Aren't you glad
[39:26] for that tonight? we should be holy and
[39:29] without blame before him in love, having
[39:32] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[39:34] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[39:38] according to the good pleasure of his
[39:40] will to the praise of the glory of his
[39:42] grace wherein he hath made us accepted
[39:46] in the beloved. I pray the Lord would
[39:47] add his blessing to the word. You may be
[39:49] seated this evening.
[39:52] The book of Ephesians teaches us about
[39:54] our placing, our election,
[39:56] predestination. Godhead, redemption,
[40:00] salvation, mercy, the Holy Ghost, God's
[40:04] eternal purpose, speaks about faith and
[40:07] love. Talks about the ministry gifts in
[40:09] the church, Christian living, kindness,
[40:13] morality, worship, husbands and wives,
[40:17] uh, children, even gets on children, the
[40:20] workplace, and spiritual warfare. in six
[40:25] chapters,
[40:26] &gt;&gt; 2422
[40:28] Greek words, 3,022 words in the KJV,
[40:32] which is about the same number of words
[40:34] that I use in a single set of notes to
[40:36] preach from.
[40:38] And and yet Paul writes a masterpiece in
[40:41] that. I believe the Holy Spirit wrote
[40:43] it.
[40:43] &gt;&gt; I believe he inspired him to write it.
[40:46] &gt;&gt; Alexander Scorby, if you go online,
[40:48] you'll find he reads it in 19 minutes.
[40:51] So you could go home and read. In fact,
[40:52] I did that several times. I listened to
[40:54] it several times in the last few days.
[40:56] You can go home probably before most of
[40:58] you could get home, you could listen to
[40:59] it or read it. And then brother Brandham
[41:02] preaches those four sermons on adoption
[41:04] as well as several other sermons about
[41:06] the book of Ephesians. But in adoption,
[41:09] brother Brandham teaches us that the
[41:11] book of Ephesians perfectly parallels
[41:14] the Old Testament book of Joshua. And he
[41:17] said that Moses, he said, was a type of
[41:19] Christ who brought the people uh out of
[41:22] Egypt. H but Joshua was a type of the
[41:25] Holy Ghost bringing the people into the
[41:27] land and placing them in the land. So
[41:30] the book of Ephesians is our placing in
[41:34] Christ. So brother Brandham takes the
[41:36] adoption series and it's a verse by
[41:38] verse study of the first three chapters
[41:40] of the book of Ephesians. And I want to
[41:42] take that and also the rest of the book
[41:44] as well if the Lord allows us to do
[41:46] that. But Brandham said Ephesus here
[41:48] sets us like Joshua positionally. He
[41:51] said you notice Joshua after crossing
[41:53] over the land and taking the land. Then
[41:55] he divided the land. He from here
[41:57] Manasses here this one here, Gad here,
[42:00] Benjamin here. And you talked about how
[42:03] those Hebrew mothers identified their
[42:04] sons. Now we've just been through that
[42:06] as kind of a precursor to this study.
[42:09] we've been through that and how that God
[42:11] identified each one and how they fit
[42:13] just perfectly in the land. Do you
[42:15] believe God does that for us as well? He
[42:17] knows where we fit, you know, where we
[42:19] belong. He knows all about us and so we
[42:21] don't have to worry. I I know a lot of
[42:23] times things come up in the church and
[42:25] because people are concerned that maybe
[42:27] they're position, they think, well,
[42:29] maybe I don't do a good enough job or
[42:31] maybe nobody appreciates it. Maybe
[42:32] nobody nobody wants me around. Maybe I
[42:35] don't have any purpose in the church.
[42:36] But I believe every one of us have a
[42:39] purpose. We just have to find it. And
[42:41] you don't have to worry. God will place
[42:42] you where he wants you to be. You don't
[42:45] have to force it or try to make it
[42:47] happen. God will put it there and make
[42:49] it make you able to do it. And and so uh
[42:52] we he placed them in the land just as
[42:54] Joshua placed the people in the land. So
[42:57] Paul, uh by the by the leadership of the
[43:00] Holy Ghost, the inspiration of the Holy
[43:01] Ghost places the church in their proper
[43:04] place in Christ.
[43:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[43:06] So, Ephesians begins with Paul stating
[43:09] his name. He said, 'I, Paul. If you'll
[43:12] find a letter. You know, most of us when
[43:14] we write a letter, how do we write a
[43:15] letter? We write a letter. Uh, good to
[43:17] have sister Luella with us tonight.
[43:19] Thank you for being here with us. When
[43:21] you write a letter, you start uh you you
[43:23] don't start out I Benjamin, right? Most
[43:26] of us start a letter, we'll say, you
[43:28] know, tell what we want to tell and then
[43:29] at the end we write we sign it. But Paul
[43:32] didn't do it that way. He says I Paul
[43:34] because that's the way an important
[43:36] letter would be written something you
[43:38] want him to know who was writing right
[43:41] and so Paul is claiming his authority to
[43:44] write at the very beginning of this he
[43:46] doesn't he doesn't defend his calling in
[43:48] this book in the same way as he does to
[43:50] the Corinthians but he still reminds
[43:53] them who is writing so he says Paul and
[43:56] the Ephesians would know that Paul that
[44:00] meant something that somebody important
[44:01] was writing to them because Paul was
[44:04] their the founder. He was their former
[44:06] pastor. He had spent two years with them
[44:08] there in Ephesus and he had been uh he
[44:11] he had he he'd set the church and he'd
[44:13] put them in order. And so they they he
[44:16] didn't have to defend his calling in the
[44:18] same way he does in other places, but he
[44:20] still reminds them who is writing. But
[44:22] to understand any letter correctly, if
[44:25] somebody writes you a letter, you've got
[44:27] to know who it is from and who it is to.
[44:30] &gt;&gt; So that's what I want to deal with
[44:31] tonight. And we may not get past the
[44:33] first verse, but I want to what I want
[44:35] to deal with is I Paul, he says Paul to
[44:40] the believer, the faithful in Christ
[44:42] Jesus, to the church. So Paul writing to
[44:46] the saints. Are you with me so far?
[44:49] &gt;&gt; Paul writing to the saints. You need to
[44:51] know who it's from and you need to know
[44:53] who it's to. And that helps you better
[44:55] understand the letter itself. So once
[44:58] you know the author and the intended
[45:00] recipient, you're able to determine the
[45:02] meaning or or what brother Random calls
[45:04] read between the lines,
[45:07] &gt;&gt; right? So this this was a prison
[45:08] epistle. This was a letter actually
[45:11] written from prison. So if you have a a
[45:14] letter that is written to you and and
[45:17] you get it and on the outside of it, it
[45:19] says uh uh you know the correctional
[45:21] facility, whatever Alcatraz or whatever
[45:24] that it might be. you get that letter,
[45:26] you might look at that and think, well,
[45:27] what in the world? Why is somebody
[45:29] writing to me from prison? And if you
[45:31] get a prison letter, it would depend on
[45:34] whether you wanted to open or not might
[45:35] depend on uh who it is that you your
[45:38] loved one or whoever it is that might be
[45:39] in prison. But they knew who it was that
[45:41] Paul had been put in prison not for the
[45:43] sake of being a murderer or a
[45:46] extortioner or a thief, but he'd been
[45:48] put in prison because of the gospel. And
[45:51] so he's sitting there in prison writing
[45:52] about the wonderful things of God. And
[45:54] it tells me that no matter what goes on
[45:56] in our lives, no matter what's happening
[45:58] right now, we can still think about the
[46:00] things of God, we can still dwell on the
[46:03] goodness of God and the predestination
[46:05] in our lives. And election because
[46:07] predestination is not subject election
[46:09] is not subject to what's going on in our
[46:12] life right now, but it's God's
[46:14] overarching plan in our life. He's he's
[46:17] got something for us to do. He's got
[46:19] something a plan for us, and we got to
[46:21] rest in that plan. Yeah.
[46:23] &gt;&gt; So, we read between the lines when we
[46:25] read the Bible. I mean, know Brandon
[46:27] taught us that we read between the
[46:30] lines.
[46:31] &gt;&gt; So, he said, "It's like a love letter
[46:32] from my wife." He said, "If she writes
[46:34] me a letter and she says, I'm just
[46:36] sitting here, the children are all
[46:37] asleep." He said, "I know what she
[46:40] means,
[46:42] &gt;&gt; right? I read between the lines,
[46:44] &gt;&gt; right?
[46:44] &gt;&gt; And and I find that it's a love letter,
[46:47] right, to me because of the one who's
[46:49] writing it." And brother Brenam says
[46:51] this. He said, "If you're in love with
[46:52] God and God's spirit is in you, the Holy
[46:56] Spirit himself is the interpreter of
[46:58] this word." So when we read the book of
[47:00] Ephesians, we ought to be able to look
[47:03] at it and say, "Lord, I know this is
[47:05] from the Apostle Paul. I know he was a
[47:07] man of God. I know he was the first
[47:09] church age messenger, but I know it's
[47:11] important. And then I know it wasn't
[47:13] just him, but it was a it was an
[47:15] inspiration from you. And I know if you
[47:18] wrote it, Lord, then it must be a love
[47:20] letter to me. Must be something in it
[47:22] that's going to help me when I'm down.
[47:24] Help me when I'm discouraged. Help me
[47:25] when I'm upset. Must be something in it
[47:28] that'll do good for me during life on
[47:30] earth.
[47:31] &gt;&gt; Good.
[47:32] &gt;&gt; So, this letter was written from prison
[47:35] and it was important as he took the time
[47:38] to write it to the Ephesian church. So
[47:41] he begins by saying, "Paul, an apostle
[47:43] of Jesus Christ by the will of God." An
[47:47] apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of
[47:50] God. Now, I want to ask you a question
[47:52] tonight as we're uh just studying these
[47:55] things. Why were Paul's letters
[47:56] preserved?
[47:58] Why Why do we Why do they matter?
[48:01] &gt;&gt; And I know you're looking at me like,
[48:02] "Brother Ben, we know why they matter.
[48:03] It's in the Bible, right?
[48:06] &gt;&gt; But why why is it why are they part of
[48:08] the Bible? Why do they matter? Why do we
[48:10] quote Paul?
[48:13] And I want to lead some into something
[48:14] on that because I know I get criticized
[48:17] sometimes because I quote brother
[48:18] Brandham a lot and and yet we and we use
[48:21] a lot of scripture as well. But why do
[48:24] we quote Paul?
[48:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right.
[48:26] &gt;&gt; The Ephesian church would have
[48:27] understood why Paul was writing to them
[48:31] and what authority he was writing under
[48:34] that he was vindicated by God to be the
[48:37] messenger to the age. And all he has to
[48:38] tell them is Paul an apostle by the will
[48:42] of God.
[48:43] &gt;&gt; In other words, my denomination didn't
[48:45] make me an apostle. My association
[48:48] didn't make me an apostle. Brother
[48:49] Brandham said it this way. He said God
[48:51] made him an apostle. No elders laid
[48:53] hands on him. No bishop sent him
[48:55] anywhere. But God called him and made
[48:58] him an apostle.
[48:59] &gt;&gt; So you look at the authority that Paul
[49:01] takes and he takes that in Galatians
[49:04] chapter 1. Uh if you go back and read
[49:06] Galatians, someone told me they just
[49:07] listened to Galatians. It's a it's a
[49:09] good book to listen to prior to
[49:11] Ephesians. If you look at verse 8, it
[49:13] says, "Though we or an angel from heaven
[49:17] preach any other gospel unto you than
[49:19] that which we have preached unto you,
[49:22] let him be a cursed." So Paul's saying,
[49:24] "Even if I came back to you and preached
[49:27] something different from what I already
[49:28] said." Now that's taking authority right
[49:31] there. and saying what I already said
[49:32] was so correct that even if I come back
[49:35] and preach something else to you because
[49:37] the correctness wasn't about it just
[49:39] being Paul but it was because it was
[49:41] inspired by God. The message was from
[49:43] God. And so he said even if I came back
[49:45] and tried to preach something different
[49:47] it wouldn't be right. If an angel from
[49:49] heaven came and taught you anything that
[49:52] wasn't in the word it wouldn't be right.
[49:54] Oh church, I think we ought to we ought
[49:55] to stand firm on the foundation that God
[49:58] has called the the ones who wrote the
[50:00] Bible, the men who wrote the Bible and
[50:02] in our age of prophet to interpret the
[50:04] Bible. God called them. God made them.
[50:06] They're authority comes from God. It
[50:09] don't come from me. I didn't make
[50:10] Brother Brandham a prophet. I didn't
[50:12] make Paul a prophet and an apostle. God
[50:14] made them that.
[50:16] &gt;&gt; Come on, sir.
[50:17] &gt;&gt; Yes. So of course if they wrote
[50:19] something to us or left something for
[50:21] us, we want to know what they said.
[50:24] &gt;&gt; Very good.
[50:25] &gt;&gt; So he said though we do that if we come
[50:28] back and that's no ordinary preacher,
[50:32] &gt;&gt; right? I couldn't say that.
[50:34] &gt;&gt; I could not stand up here and say if I
[50:37] come and preach anything different than
[50:39] I've ever preached, then let me be
[50:41] accursed. Right? Because the truth is I
[50:45] I'm fallible. I might see something
[50:47] different than what I saw before. But if
[50:49] a message comes from God,
[50:52] &gt;&gt; right? If a message comes from God, the
[50:54] message itself that came from God is
[50:57] always right.
[50:59] &gt;&gt; Right? Because God don't make no
[51:00] mistakes.
[51:01] &gt;&gt; The man might make a mistake. The
[51:03] preacher might make a mistake. Even a
[51:05] prophet might make a mistake in his
[51:07] flesh. But but a but the message is not
[51:10] a mistake.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; Because the message comes from God. Yes
[51:14] sir.
[51:14] &gt;&gt; Are we clear so far?
[51:16] &gt;&gt; So he said, "I'm an apostle by the will
[51:18] of God." In Galatians 1:9, he said, "As
[51:20] we said before, so say I." Now again,
[51:22] any man preach any other gospel unto you
[51:24] than that ye have received, let him be
[51:27] accursed. A cursed is the word anathema,
[51:29] which means devoted to destruction,
[51:32] which is the word used of uh you
[51:34] remember the Old Testament of of uh the
[51:36] man who took the Achen who took the
[51:38] wedge of gold, right? He He took the
[51:41] oursed thing, something that had been
[51:42] devoted to destruction. God said,
[51:45] "Destroy all of it." And they didn't do
[51:47] it. Saul got in trouble for the same
[51:49] thing, for keeping alive things which
[51:51] were devoted to destruction. But he
[51:53] said, "If someone preaches something
[51:54] different, let him be devoted to
[51:56] destruction." He said, "Do I now
[51:57] persuade men or God? Do I seek to please
[52:00] men?" He said, "If I yet pleased men, I
[52:02] should not be the servant of Christ.
[52:04] &gt;&gt; But I certify you, brethren, that the
[52:06] gospel which was preached to me is not
[52:08] after man. I neither received it a man,
[52:10] neither was I taught it, but by the
[52:12] revelation of Jesus Christ. Listen how
[52:15] he's he's he's saying something when he
[52:17] says, "I'm an apostle by the will of
[52:19] God." He's saying, "My message didn't
[52:21] come just from my mind. It didn't come
[52:23] from being taught it by somebody." It
[52:25] didn't come from reading commentaries.
[52:26] It didn't come from those things, though
[52:28] they may have done. Paul did all of
[52:29] those things. He was a very learning
[52:31] man, but he said, "I've got to for I had
[52:32] to forget everything I knew in order to
[52:35] have Christ." And brother Random tells
[52:36] us the same thing. He says that I was
[52:39] about to make a horrible mistake. Go
[52:40] with what someone else taught. He said,
[52:42] "But the angel come down and corrected
[52:44] me."
[52:45] &gt;&gt; Right? You can trust a message like
[52:47] that.
[52:49] &gt;&gt; Are are you with me now?
[52:52] &gt;&gt; So in he said, "I didn't receive it of
[52:54] man. I wasn't taught it." He said, "You
[52:56] heard of my conversation in time past in
[52:58] Jews religion." He said, "How that
[53:00] beyond measure I persecuted the church
[53:02] of God and wasted it and profited in the
[53:05] Jews religion above many my equals in my
[53:07] own nation, being more exceedingly
[53:09] zealous of the traditions of my
[53:11] fathers."
[53:12] &gt;&gt; But when it pleased God,
[53:15] &gt;&gt; oh my, he wasn't called by man.
[53:18] &gt;&gt; When it pleased God, who separated me
[53:20] from my mother's womb,
[53:22] &gt;&gt; right? and called me by his grace to
[53:26] reveal his son in me that I might preach
[53:29] him among the heathen. Immediately I
[53:31] conferred not with flesh and blood,
[53:33] neither went I up to Jerusalem to them
[53:34] which were apostles before me. But I
[53:36] went into Arabia and returned again to
[53:38] Damascus. After 3 years I went up to
[53:40] Jerusalem to see Peter and abode with
[53:42] him 15 days. But he said other the
[53:44] apostles saw I none say James the Lord's
[53:46] brother. He said now the things which I
[53:48] write unto you, behold before God I lie
[53:50] not. Afterwards, I came into the regions
[53:52] of Syria and Cissia was unknown by faith
[53:55] under the churches of Judea which were
[53:57] in Christ. So he said, I I wasn't even
[53:59] my fellowship wasn't even with them. I
[54:02] they didn't even know who I was by
[54:03] faith. But they had heard only that he
[54:06] which persecuted us in times past now
[54:08] preaches the faith which once he
[54:10] destroyed. What a testimony.
[54:12] &gt;&gt; And they glorified God in me. So what
[54:15] did God do? He's saying when he's saying
[54:17] I'm an apostle by the will of God, he's
[54:19] saying God separated me from my mother's
[54:21] womb to bring the book of Ephesians. You
[54:24] believe it's important?
[54:25] &gt;&gt; God called him from his mother's womb to
[54:27] bring this book so that we could hear
[54:29] it. So that we could preach it, so that
[54:31] we can read it and study and understand
[54:33] it.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; So now you bear with me for just a
[54:40] moment. Brother Brandham has the same
[54:42] authority
[54:44] &gt;&gt; as Paul. He's a major prophet, a
[54:47] messenger to the age,
[54:48] &gt;&gt; but a different purpose,
[54:51] &gt;&gt; right? The same authority, a different
[54:54] purpose. I want even our young ones to
[54:56] understand this because it's important.
[54:58] So, Brother Brandham did not come to
[55:00] write a new Bible. I got a new Bible. My
[55:02] kids got me one. I didn't think they got
[55:04] me anything for my birthday. And I'm so
[55:06] proud of this. I had to bring it out.
[55:08] They brought me They got me a new Bible.
[55:10] Just was delayed getting here. It just
[55:12] tells you sometimes you don't know
[55:13] everything, right?
[55:15] get down about stuff and you just don't
[55:17] know everything. God's got something
[55:19] special in the mail.
[55:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now,
[55:27] Brother Brandham had had the authority
[55:29] of Paul. I know that's that's hard for
[55:31] some people to take, but he was either a
[55:32] prophet or he was not.
[55:35] &gt;&gt; Good.
[55:35] &gt;&gt; Right. He was either a word prophet or
[55:37] he was not. And he was a word prophet.
[55:39] There was a theologian that asked
[55:40] brother Brandham. He said, "With your
[55:42] experience, the Lord has given you for
[55:44] his people." He said, "You would be
[55:45] eligible to write a Bible yourself, your
[55:47] word, if God has manifested." I said,
[55:50] "That might be true." See, he was trying
[55:52] to catch me. I said, "But you see, I
[55:55] couldn't do that." He said, "Why
[55:56] couldn't you? You have all the
[55:57] qualifications." But remember what Paul
[55:59] said. He said, "If I came back,
[56:02] &gt;&gt; though he was a vindicated prophet, but
[56:03] he said, "If I came preach something
[56:04] else other than what you've heard, let
[56:07] him be accursed." Right? So he said, he
[56:09] said, 'Look, one word cannot be taken or
[56:12] added or taken away. He said, 'Well,
[56:14] them seven thunders, see that them seven
[56:16] thunders blasting out, won't that be a
[56:18] revelation be given to some man? I said,
[56:20] no, sir. That ought to be enough to
[56:22] knock that doctrine out of the window,
[56:24] right?
[56:25] &gt;&gt; He said, it won't be a revelation given
[56:26] to some man. I said, no, sir. It' be
[56:28] adding something to it or taking
[56:29] something from it, right?
[56:31] &gt;&gt; He said, it's all revealed in there. And
[56:33] the seven seals opened up the revelation
[56:35] of what that was. So it's written in the
[56:37] scripture, but the seven seals opened up
[56:39] the revelation of it what it was. He
[56:42] said that's what it was. See, it's still
[56:43] in the word. See, you can't get out of
[56:45] that word. It won't leave the word.
[56:47] Anything that's not in the Bible that
[56:50] you hear, you say, "Well, that may be
[56:51] true, may not be true." But if it's not,
[56:53] if it's foundation is not in the
[56:55] scripture, I don't care who said it, how
[56:57] qualified they are to say it. If the
[56:59] foundation is not in the scripture, it
[57:01] didn't come from the word of God. It
[57:02] comes from the bottomless pit.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; Right.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; Right. which is Catholic dogma has no
[57:06] foundation. So it was a bottomless pit.
[57:08] I don't want my doctrine I don't want
[57:10] what I hang my soul on to come out of a
[57:12] bottomless pit. I want what I hang my
[57:14] soul on to have a sure foundation, a
[57:16] firm foundation built by the apostles
[57:18] and prophets.
[57:22] &gt;&gt; So
[57:24] brother Brandon said God's spirit will
[57:25] never leave the word. Someone say never.
[57:28] &gt;&gt; Never leave the word. You said well I
[57:30] got the spirit of God. If you got the
[57:31] spirit of God it'll never leave the
[57:33] word. Right?
[57:34] &gt;&gt; It'll stay right with the word blinding
[57:36] some and open the eyes of others. It'll
[57:37] always do that. So the seventh angel
[57:40] messenger would not write another Bible,
[57:42] but he would finish the mystery. All the
[57:44] loose ends would be tied up by his
[57:46] message. So the message is not another
[57:49] Bible. It's the authoritative
[57:50] interpretation of the Bible.
[57:53] &gt;&gt; See, if I'd get up here and and I have
[57:55] before, and I'd see nothing wrong with
[57:56] quoting Adam Clark or John Calvin. Those
[57:59] men wrote things that help me. But if I
[58:01] quote them, when I quote them, I'm
[58:04] quoting a man's interpretation,
[58:07] &gt;&gt; right? It may be right, it may be wrong,
[58:09] but that's what I'm quoting. I'm quoting
[58:11] someone who chose to study and give
[58:13] their interpretation of it. The same as
[58:15] if I would look at it and study and try
[58:16] to give my interpretation of it. But
[58:18] when I quote a prophet, the prophet of
[58:20] the age, I quote a man chosen by God to
[58:23] be a prophet, a divine interpreter of
[58:26] the word.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; He was a man. He made mistakes. He was
[58:29] not writing scripture. And that's where
[58:31] so many people get mixed up. They think,
[58:32] "Well, it's scripture. It's not
[58:34] scripture." But his interpretation of
[58:36] scripture was authorized by God,
[58:38] vindicated by God. He was a prophet by
[58:41] the will of God.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm so glad for that. So, when we
[58:45] look at the book of Ephesians, isn't it
[58:46] wonderful? We live in an age where our
[58:48] eyes have come open. So, we've got what
[58:50] Paul wrote in Ephesians, and we've got
[58:52] the authorized commentary,
[58:56] &gt;&gt; right? We've got the written word and
[58:59] the authorized commentary to the written
[59:01] word that lines up with the written
[59:03] word. And from that, we get things that
[59:05] no one else gets out of the book of
[59:07] Ephesians.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; If you want something fun, go look at
[59:10] the book of Ephesians sometime. Look at
[59:12] uh commentaries or look online on
[59:14] YouTube. They'll have a a quick uh
[59:17] sketch of the book of Ephesians. They'll
[59:18] talk about Ephesians. And after a while,
[59:20] you realize they don't know anything
[59:21] about the book of Ephesians. But a
[59:23] prophet of God was anointed by God and
[59:27] chosen by God from his mother's womb to
[59:29] go in the back part of God's mind and
[59:31] reveal something about the book of
[59:33] Ephesians that would help us in the age
[59:35] that we're living in. That would cause
[59:37] us to know where we stand and who we
[59:39] are. I'm so thankful for the message of
[59:40] the hour that would do that.
[59:44] &gt;&gt; So, Brother Brandham says this about his
[59:46] own message. He said, "I do believe what
[59:48] I've taught on the tapes."
[59:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[59:52] I think we can say that too.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; I believe every word of it.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; I would not feed the people the wrong
[59:58] thing. If I'm wrong, I pray that God
[1:00:01] will forgive me for it because it's the
[1:00:03] best of my understanding. It's not my
[1:00:04] job to correct the message.
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; My job to believe it.
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; Right. And God God corrects his man.
[1:00:11] Keeps him right.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; Again, brother Bren said, "Oh word
[1:00:14] believers, give into my message."
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; That's pretty strong, isn't it?
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; Very good.
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; Give into my message. Hear me. He said,
[1:00:21] "Not my message, but his message
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; that he because the message didn't come,
[1:00:26] Paul's message didn't just come from
[1:00:28] him, but he said, "I'm an apostle by the
[1:00:30] will of God."
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; Oh, church, if you could ever get that
[1:00:33] revelation even in your own self. You
[1:00:35] young people, get that revelation. I'm
[1:00:36] not a Christian by the will of man. I'm
[1:00:38] not I'm not a I'm not a a husband or a
[1:00:41] wife or whatever it is that you are. I'm
[1:00:43] not that by the will of man, but by the
[1:00:44] will of God. God made me what I am. God
[1:00:47] put me in the church. God placed me.
[1:00:49] What can shake me now? Because God has
[1:00:52] placed me and made me what I am.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; God made brother Brandham a prophet. God
[1:00:56] made Paul a prophet.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "Give into my message.
[1:01:00] Not my message, but his message that he
[1:01:02] firmly declares to be the truth. You've
[1:01:04] got to choose from somewhere. You can't
[1:01:07] sit still after this. You got to make
[1:01:09] your choice." Again, he said, I know you
[1:01:12] you know all these things, but we're
[1:01:13] just laying it down here just so we get
[1:01:15] a real firm foundation for the book of
[1:01:18] Ephesians. He said it wasn't the angel
[1:01:20] his message. It was the mystery that God
[1:01:22] unfolded.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; It's not a man, it's God. The angel was
[1:01:25] not the son of man. He was the messenger
[1:01:27] from the son of man. The son of man is
[1:01:29] Christ. He's the one that you're feeding
[1:01:30] on. You're not feeding on a man. A man,
[1:01:32] his words will fail, but you're feeding
[1:01:34] on the unfailing body word of the son of
[1:01:37] man.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Aren't you glad to be
[1:01:40] feeding today? Aren't you glad to have
[1:01:42] something to eat? I'm glad we've got
[1:01:44] emotion. I'm glad we've got sensation.
[1:01:46] And if it's a right sensation, I'm glad
[1:01:48] we've got gifts. I'm glad we got those
[1:01:50] things. But I'm so glad that we've got a
[1:01:52] word that we can feed on that when gifts
[1:01:54] fail and emotions fail and everything
[1:01:56] else fails. I can always go back to the
[1:01:58] word and know the word about me, what
[1:02:00] God thought about me and revealed
[1:02:01] through a prophet messenger will never
[1:02:03] change.
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; No matter what a preacher says, no
[1:02:06] matter what Oh, come on, church. No
[1:02:08] matter what a church says, I'm not
[1:02:10] subject to that. But what God thought
[1:02:11] about me will never change from time and
[1:02:14] eternity. If God chose me, nobody can.
[1:02:18] Your school friends can't change that.
[1:02:19] The people out in the world, in the
[1:02:21] factory can't change that. People you
[1:02:23] work with, your family can't change
[1:02:24] that. Whatever God thought about you is
[1:02:26] imprinted in the mind of God forever.
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; He can't be wrong. Amen.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful for that.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:37] Amen. See, brother Brandham's message
[1:02:40] was Paul's message
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; because it was the message of Christ.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? Brother Brandham
[1:02:47] even stood there when he went beyond the
[1:02:48] curtain of time and the people there
[1:02:51] were were standing and and and brother
[1:02:53] Brandham said, well, he said, "You'll
[1:02:54] have to be judged." The man who was
[1:02:56] standing there, the one who was standing
[1:02:57] there with him said, "You'll have to be
[1:02:58] judged." Brother Brandham said, "Was
[1:03:01] Paul did Paul have to be judged with his
[1:03:02] crew?"
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; Did he said, "There'll be rewards given
[1:03:05] out?" said, "Did Paul have to stand
[1:03:06] there with his group?" He said, "Yes."
[1:03:09] He said, "Well, if Paul's going goes in,
[1:03:12] I'll go in." He said, "Because because I
[1:03:16] preached the same thing Paul preached."
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; He said, "Where Paul preached baptism by
[1:03:21] immersion in the name of Jesus Christ,"
[1:03:23] he said, "I preach the same thing." And
[1:03:24] he said, "Millions beyond the curtain of
[1:03:26] time cried out, we're resting on that."
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But we live in an era when
[1:03:33] modern theologians are denying the
[1:03:35] authority of Paul.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; Did you know that?
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; Paul had to defend himself when he was
[1:03:41] here, but he would have to defend
[1:03:42] himself today.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; Most churches now teach that Paul's
[1:03:47] message is secondary to Jesus message
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; when we know that it's Christ in Paul,
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; right? Writing these things.
[1:03:57] But they teach that Paul's message was
[1:03:58] secondary because they don't want to
[1:03:59] have to deal
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; with some of the scriptures Paul wrote.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; Paul talks about the mystery of the
[1:04:07] gentile age, the mystery of the rapture.
[1:04:08] Without Paul, we don't even know those
[1:04:10] things.
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; The mystery of the church is the body of
[1:04:13] Christ. But the worldly church, they
[1:04:15] don't want to deal with 1 Corinthians
[1:04:16] 11,
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; right? Where it talks about the women
[1:04:19] cutting their hair. They don't want to
[1:04:21] deal with Romans chapter 1.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah. where it talks about the
[1:04:24] debasement of man, the degradation of
[1:04:26] mankind until and womankind until they
[1:04:29] until they actually begin to lust after
[1:04:31] one another and things that begin to
[1:04:33] happen and what and it brought about a
[1:04:35] homosexual agenda and Paul lays it out
[1:04:37] and they say, "Well, that was Paul's
[1:04:38] opinion."
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; You see that spirit that comes in that
[1:04:42] tries to tries to degrade the influence
[1:04:44] of Paul because they don't want you to
[1:04:46] believe the word because you can only be
[1:04:48] be saved by the whole word of God,
[1:04:50] right? by believing the word of God. But
[1:04:54] they they don't want you to believe
[1:04:55] that. And and the worldly church don't
[1:04:57] want you to believe that. But I think
[1:04:58] that's come down even in the message. I
[1:05:00] want to deal with one thing tonight just
[1:05:02] as an example. But I think that comes
[1:05:04] down even in the message at times that
[1:05:06] people today tend to deny the authority,
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; come on,
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; of Paul.
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah. and by extension of a prophet
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; right
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; in our day but they're actually denying
[1:05:19] what Paul said right because we have a
[1:05:21] movement today that people you know they
[1:05:24] they don't want to go to church at all
[1:05:25] and and again if a person I'm not de
[1:05:27] Christianizing a person for doing that
[1:05:30] but the Bible said this is what Paul
[1:05:32] said he chapter 10 25 not forsaking the
[1:05:36] assembling of ourselves together and
[1:05:38] people forsake it in different ways some
[1:05:40] forsake it out of doctrine right that
[1:05:42] they They just believe it's wrong to
[1:05:44] come together. They get that from a
[1:05:46] spirit, but it's not the Holy Spirit.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; They get it from a word, but not the
[1:05:51] word of God.
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; Right. But then there's others who
[1:05:54] forsake the assembling of ourselves
[1:05:55] together. I know I'm preaching to you on
[1:05:56] a Wednesday night, but y'all so y'all
[1:05:58] just you're faithful Christians here in
[1:05:59] the house of God, but some forsake the
[1:06:01] assembling of themselves together for
[1:06:03] personal reasons,
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; right? Well, I don't like what's going
[1:06:06] on at the church, or I don't like what's
[1:06:08] happening over here. I I I'm I'm I'm
[1:06:11] struggling in my life or maybe maybe I
[1:06:13] got things going on. I'm too busy or
[1:06:15] it's just not important to me.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; But what does Paul say?
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; Not forsaking the assembling of
[1:06:22] ourselves together
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; as the manner of some is, but exhorting
[1:06:26] one another. That's what I'm doing
[1:06:27] tonight. Exhorting one another and so
[1:06:29] much more as you see the day
[1:06:31] approaching.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; So, brother Brandham says what Paul
[1:06:35] says, right? Because this is the
[1:06:37] commandment of the Lord. Well, the
[1:06:38] Brandon says the same thing Paul says.
[1:06:40] He said, "Now remember, go to church
[1:06:41] somewhere. Someplace,
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; right?" Well, I think that's pretty
[1:06:47] good. That pretty much covers it all. Go
[1:06:48] to church. And brother Ben, where should
[1:06:50] I go to church? Somewhere. Someplace.
[1:06:53] You ought to go to church and count
[1:06:54] yourself among believers and raise your
[1:06:56] hands to God and worship God because
[1:06:58] he's a God worthy of worship. He's a God
[1:07:01] worthy of praise.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; Go to church somewhere, someplace.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Huh?
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; 1 Corinthians 14:36 says, "What came the
[1:07:10] word of God out from you or came it unto
[1:07:12] you only?" So in other words, there were
[1:07:13] people that just kind of make made it up
[1:07:15] as they went along. And Paul said, "You
[1:07:17] Corinthians, are you just making this
[1:07:18] up? Did the word of God come out to you
[1:07:21] only? If any man think himself to be a
[1:07:23] prophet or spiritual, let him
[1:07:24] acknowledge the things that I write unto
[1:07:26] you are the commandments of the Lord."
[1:07:29] Amen.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; Again, 2 Thessalonians 3:14, "If any man
[1:07:34] obey not our word by this epistle, note
[1:07:35] that man, have no company with him that
[1:07:37] he may be ashamed." Paul says another
[1:07:39] place, "Mark them and avoid them." What
[1:07:41] is that? What What is that serious,
[1:07:44] church?
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; We need to take it that serious. If God
[1:07:46] said it, if Paul said it, we need to say
[1:07:48] amen to it. I may not always be able to
[1:07:50] live up to it like I want to, but I've
[1:07:52] got to acknowledge the word of God is
[1:07:54] the absolute truth. Brother Bram said,
[1:07:56] "Our soul hangs by chain over hell." Do
[1:07:59] you realize that? He said that chain is
[1:08:01] the word of God. And a chain is only as
[1:08:03] strong as its weakest link.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; So we believe all the word.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; Listen, he had authority.
[1:08:14] Paul had authority, but it wasn't from
[1:08:15] man, from God.
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; And he had authority, I'll just add
[1:08:20] this, that a pastor doesn't have.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; Right. that that another preacher
[1:08:25] doesn't have. Paul had an authority
[1:08:26] beyond that
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; because he had a certain job to do
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; right at the beginning of the church
[1:08:32] age. And brother Brandham as well at the
[1:08:33] end of the church age, a different job
[1:08:35] but but similar in his authority.
[1:08:38] Ephesians chapter 1 verse one again
[1:08:42] going to keep going back to that first
[1:08:43] verse. But he said Paul an apostle of
[1:08:46] Jesus Christ by the will of God. So you
[1:08:48] found out who the letter's from.
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; Let's find out who the letter's to. to
[1:08:52] the saints
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; which are at Ephesus. When he said that,
[1:08:56] I said, "Praise God." That means he's
[1:08:59] writing to me.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; I think that's the way we ought to take
[1:09:04] the word of God. I'm reading the book of
[1:09:06] Ephesians and I'm going back into
[1:09:08] Ephesians and I'm looking and as I'm
[1:09:10] looking at Ephesians, he said, he said,
[1:09:12] "To the saints." Oh, he wrote that to
[1:09:14] me. Paul took the time in prison
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; to write to me,
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; right? Can we take it that personal? He
[1:09:22] took time to write to you. We ought to
[1:09:24] read it sometimes.
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; Paul took the time to write to the
[1:09:28] saints which are at Ephesus. The saints
[1:09:31] which are at Ephesus. From Paul, the
[1:09:33] first church age messenger from Paul to
[1:09:36] the saints.
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; Saints is sanctified. One saints doesn't
[1:09:40] mean some Catholic saint, something that
[1:09:42] they pray to or kiss the ring of or the
[1:09:44] toe of or something like that.
[1:09:46] Somebody's got an image. Brother Brandon
[1:09:47] was not a saint because he was a
[1:09:49] prophet. He was a saint because he was
[1:09:50] sanctified. You are not a saint because
[1:09:52] of your position in the church. You're a
[1:09:54] saint because you've been sanctified.
[1:09:56] How are you sanctified? By being in
[1:09:57] Christ. By having the blood wash you
[1:09:59] from your sins,
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; right? The same way I would be
[1:10:02] sanctified or anybody else. That's how
[1:10:04] you become a saint. You don't become a
[1:10:05] saint by being old.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; Or by being young
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; by attending church. We've just talked
[1:10:10] about how important it is to come
[1:10:11] together. But that don't make you a
[1:10:13] saint.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; Right. That don't make you a saint
[1:10:15] coming to church. You can go to church
[1:10:16] and not be a saint. But what makes you a
[1:10:18] saint is by being sanctified by the
[1:10:21] blood of Jesus.
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; Again, look at that first verse again.
[1:10:26] Brother, well, let's go back. Brother
[1:10:28] Brandon says, "It means they've been
[1:10:29] called out, separated, and now been
[1:10:30] baptized by the Holy Spirit and are in
[1:10:32] Christ Jesus." That's what it takes to
[1:10:34] be a saint.
[1:10:36] And Ephesians 1:1 again, to the saints
[1:10:39] which are at Ephesus. So, it's Paul to
[1:10:41] the saints
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; and to the faithful in Christ Jesus.
[1:10:47] There's something fascinating in this
[1:10:48] verse and that's that when brother
[1:10:51] Brandham picks this up I think every
[1:10:54] other commentator and myself when I read
[1:10:56] it I emphasize in my mind the word
[1:10:58] faithful
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; right I picked that up and I emphasize
[1:11:02] the word faithful
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; brother Brandham didn't do that you know
[1:11:06] that because I want to think of myself
[1:11:08] as faithful
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; it got quiet I want to think of myself
[1:11:13] as faithful don't you want to think of
[1:11:15] yourself as faithful Right? I want to be
[1:11:17] one of the faithful in Christ. And
[1:11:18] there's faith. There's a faithfulness
[1:11:20] that we can have.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; But look, brother Brandham doesn't
[1:11:22] emphasize the word faithful. He
[1:11:24] emphasizes the word in
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; in
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; faithful in Christ Jesus.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because you can only be
[1:11:36] faithful if you are in Christ.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; Right? So the the these things are
[1:11:42] written from Paul, the messenger of the
[1:11:45] age of that first age and a messenger
[1:11:47] still to us by becoming a part of the of
[1:11:50] the scripture, the Bible. The messenger
[1:11:52] to the ones who are in Christ
[1:11:56] in Christ. That means that this message,
[1:11:58] this book wasn't written for everyone,
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; It was written for a particular
[1:12:04] audience.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; Because not everyone's going to be able
[1:12:07] to understand it. They're not going to
[1:12:08] be able to comprehend it. It's not going
[1:12:10] to mean anything to them.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; Right. But the saints,
[1:12:15] it means something to the saints. It
[1:12:17] means something to those who are in
[1:12:19] Christ.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; And I think there's a lesson there for
[1:12:23] us that and I've done it myself many
[1:12:25] times. We try to push the deep things of
[1:12:27] God on someone who's not in Christ
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; and they read it and they don't
[1:12:31] understand it. But how could they?
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; Right. But Paul doesn't do that.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; Right. And I don't think we shouldn't
[1:12:38] mistreat people who don't understand.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; Or who don't believe what we believe. I
[1:12:42] think the way we treat them is a good
[1:12:43] indicator of who we are.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; Right. We ought to treat people right.
[1:12:47] No matter who they're God, help me to
[1:12:49] treat people right. No matter who they
[1:12:50] are, where they come from, or what
[1:12:51] background they're from. God, help me to
[1:12:53] do that. Every one of us, I know me all
[1:12:55] of us fail in some way or another in
[1:12:57] that area. But God, help us to to strive
[1:12:59] to treat people right.
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; Not to look down on them because they
[1:13:02] don't understand what we understand. And
[1:13:04] that includes here in the church. Come
[1:13:06] on.
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; Right. Because not everybody's going to
[1:13:08] understand what we understand. But we
[1:13:10] don't hate them because of that. We
[1:13:12] don't put them out,
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; right? We'll still call them brother and
[1:13:15] sister and things like that. But but
[1:13:17] it's not for this book isn't written for
[1:13:19] everyone.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; They're not going to understand it.
[1:13:21] They're not even going to want to get
[1:13:22] into it.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; But for those who do,
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; come on.
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; It's the uncarchable riches of Jesus
[1:13:28] Christ.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; Oh, do you believe that tonight?
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; Listen. How do we get in Christ? 1
[1:13:34] Corinthians 12:13. For by one spirit are
[1:13:37] we all baptized into one body. Whether
[1:13:40] we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be
[1:13:42] bond or free, but all made to drink into
[1:13:44] one spirit. Brother Brandham deals with
[1:13:45] that in adoption. He said, "How?"
[1:13:47] Baptized by what? The Holy Ghost. Not by
[1:13:50] water baptism, you Church of Christ
[1:13:51] people. Not by one capital SPI RIT. By
[1:13:55] uh but by one capital SPI RIT. By one
[1:13:58] spirit. Not by one handshake, by one
[1:13:59] letter, not by one sprinkle, but by one
[1:14:02] spirit. We are all baptized into one
[1:14:05] body, our possession, the land that God
[1:14:08] gave us to live in the Holy Ghost. So as
[1:14:11] Joshua goes in to place the people in
[1:14:13] the land, so the Holy Ghost comes in and
[1:14:16] places us in our possession, which is
[1:14:19] the Holy Ghost.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; So it is the leadership of the Holy
[1:14:23] Ghost placing us in the land of the Holy
[1:14:25] Ghost in Christ because we know he's one
[1:14:28] in the same person.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:14:30] So he said just as he give Canaan to the
[1:14:32] Jews, he's give us the Holy Spirit. One
[1:14:34] spirit are we all baptized into one
[1:14:36] body. You get it? He said he's talking
[1:14:38] to the spiritual Canaanites, Israel, the
[1:14:40] spiritual Israel who's possessed the
[1:14:41] land. Aren't you glad you come out of
[1:14:43] Egypt's garlic? Aren't you glad you're
[1:14:45] out of the wilderness? And remember, he
[1:14:46] said they had to eat mana, angels food
[1:14:48] out of heaven until they crossed over
[1:14:50] into the land. And when they crossed
[1:14:51] over into the land, the mana ceased to
[1:14:53] fall. They were fully matured then and
[1:14:56] they eat the old corn of the land. He
[1:14:58] said, "Now, now that you're not babies
[1:15:00] anymore, now that you're not desiring
[1:15:02] the sincere milk of the gospel, you
[1:15:04] don't have to be babyed and petted and
[1:15:06] persuaded to come to church. We got
[1:15:08] anybody out there like that, fully
[1:15:10] mature Christians." He said, "You're
[1:15:11] ready to eat strong meats now. You're
[1:15:13] ready to come into something." He said,
[1:15:15] "You're ready to understand something
[1:15:16] that's deep and rich." He said, "We'll
[1:15:19] get into it directly. You know, it's
[1:15:20] been hidden since the foundation of the
[1:15:23] world." He said, "Now that you've come
[1:15:24] into this, I'm addressing this to you.
[1:15:26] Not to those who just left Egypt. Not to
[1:15:28] those who are still in the journey, but
[1:15:30] to those who are in the promised land,
[1:15:32] has received the promised land." What is
[1:15:33] the promised land again? The Holy Ghost,
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; right? That's how you get in Christ.
[1:15:38] It's the only way you can get in Christ.
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; Church, if we'd ever understand that and
[1:15:42] grab a hold of that, nobody could take
[1:15:44] us out of that. Nobody could shake us
[1:15:46] from that. We're not so dependent on
[1:15:48] feeling. We're not so dependent on what
[1:15:50] somebody says about us. Why? Because
[1:15:53] we're in Christ. If I'm in him, if I've
[1:15:56] ever been in him, I can't be taken out
[1:15:58] of him.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; I I'm a part of him. I died with him on
[1:16:02] Calvary. How could I be judged for sin
[1:16:04] that I don't that he don't even see
[1:16:07] because it was judged in his body?
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; So, so we have to understand we're in
[1:16:14] him.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "How many's
[1:16:17] received the promise of the Holy Ghost?"
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad that you're in the land?
[1:16:22] Yes.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; Over here now eating the old corn,
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; eating the strong things of God. Got a
[1:16:27] clear understanding.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; Your spiritual mind is all unmuddled up,
[1:16:35] right? Because that's what happens when
[1:16:37] see when when you're when you don't have
[1:16:39] the Holy Ghost or I'll say this, when
[1:16:40] you get back
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; your spiritual mind gets muddled up,
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; right? You just can't think clearly
[1:16:48] about the word
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; and what your responsibilities are to
[1:16:51] the word.
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; But if you'll be in Christ and dwell
[1:16:54] abide in Christ, right?
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; If you abide in the vine, your spiritual
[1:16:58] mind gets unmuddled up.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; You know exactly who he is.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; Oh, I could preach on that for a while.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; When your spiritual mind gets un Oh,
[1:17:11] church, if we could just ask you, Lord,
[1:17:13] get my mind unmuddled up. I know that's
[1:17:15] not good English, but if we could just
[1:17:16] kind of pray that way. Lord, get my
[1:17:18] mind. Allow my mind to be clear, my
[1:17:21] spiritual mind, so that I can know the
[1:17:23] things of God.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; So I can know who you are. Because if we
[1:17:26] know who he is, we know how big he is.
[1:17:29] We know our problems aren't bigger than
[1:17:30] he is. Our situations aren't more than
[1:17:33] he can handle. But he is able to
[1:17:35] overcome everything that we go through.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Aren't you glad for that
[1:17:40] today?
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; You know exactly what he is. You know
[1:17:43] exactly where where you're going. How
[1:17:46] many know where you're going?
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; Well, if you don't know where you're
[1:17:49] going, then you need to find out.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; Right? Cuz you're going somewhere.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; But if you know where you're going, your
[1:17:56] spiritual mind's been unmuddled up. You
[1:17:58] know exactly all about it. You know in
[1:17:59] whom you have believed and persuaded
[1:18:01] he's able. Are you persuaded that he's
[1:18:03] able to keep that which you've committed
[1:18:05] against that day. He said, "Oh, that's
[1:18:07] the one. That's who Paul is talking to."
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:12] So we say, are we are we in Christ? I
[1:18:14] believe that you are tonight.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; That's why we would preach this because
[1:18:17] we're preaching to people who are in
[1:18:19] Christ.
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; How do we get into Christ? Brother
[1:18:22] Brandon says he just keeps going over
[1:18:24] this. He said, by joining church? No. By
[1:18:28] putting your name on a book? No. By
[1:18:30] being baptized by immersing? No. How do
[1:18:33] we get into Christ? By one Holy Spirit.
[1:18:36] Are we all baptized into one promise,
[1:18:38] the body, and are partakers of all?
[1:18:41] Someone say all
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; that belongs into the land.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; He said my when I get in this land, it's
[1:18:48] mine. I'm home now.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; Oh church, that's why I couldn't leave
[1:18:53] the message for the Paul cuz I'm home
[1:18:55] now. I found a home in the land. I found
[1:18:58] a home in the teachings of a prophet. I
[1:19:00] found a home in the in what what it what
[1:19:03] Paul taught and what brother Brandon
[1:19:04] taught. I found a home. I found a place.
[1:19:06] I found my future home. I found a place
[1:19:08] for me now. I found my position in
[1:19:10] Christ. It's mine. I'm home. I'm in
[1:19:12] Canaan. I'm subject to anything God
[1:19:15] wants to use me for. I'm walking on holy
[1:19:18] ground. How many believe that tonight?
[1:19:20] I'm walking on a holy ground.
[1:19:21] Hallelujah. I've come out of Egypt. I'm
[1:19:23] walking on holy ground. A child of the
[1:19:25] king, all robed and ready. I've come out
[1:19:27] of Egypt, come up through the promised
[1:19:28] land, stood in the trials, passed over
[1:19:30] Jordan into this blessed promise.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, how do I get it? By one spirit. The
[1:19:35] same way Paul got it. acted on me the
[1:19:37] same way it did on him, same way it did
[1:19:40] on you. By one spirit, we are all
[1:19:42] baptized.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; Not sprinkled. Just a little sprinkle of
[1:19:45] it feel pretty good. But immersed under.
[1:19:47] Word baptism means immersion.
[1:19:50] We're not sprinkled by the spirit,
[1:19:52] right? We are immersed in the spirit.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The same life that was in
[1:19:57] him living in us doing the same works.
[1:20:00] He said, "That's the promise."
[1:20:02] Hallelujah. We believe his word because
[1:20:05] we have his life.
[1:20:07] The deep things of God are there for us.
[1:20:10] There for us when we need them. He'll
[1:20:13] reveal them to us as we need them. Amen.
[1:20:15] But they're there for us. Are you with
[1:20:16] me now? We may not understand
[1:20:18] everything, but we know it's there for
[1:20:20] us.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's there for us. It's a
[1:20:23] different atmosphere. We've come inside
[1:20:25] a different place, a different level of
[1:20:27] understanding. Not just natural
[1:20:29] understanding, but spiritual
[1:20:30] understanding.
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; So, you come inside. Brother Random
[1:20:33] likened it to the countdown. You
[1:20:35] remember he said the countdown in the
[1:20:37] natural went 1 2 3 4 like that. He said
[1:20:40] but the countdown spiritual.
[1:20:42] He said in the natural it goes down to
[1:20:43] zero and in spiritual it counts up 1 2 3
[1:20:46] 4 5 6 7.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; Right. And in the seventh age he said at
[1:20:51] the end of the seventh age that's when
[1:20:53] you get into the pressurized chamber.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; Remember he said that's what the
[1:20:58] astronaut did. He said they went inside
[1:21:00] a pressurized chamber. It was
[1:21:02] pressurized to withstand the things that
[1:21:05] were going to take place.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; You realize what God's done for us by
[1:21:08] the message of the hour. He's put us
[1:21:11] inside a different atmosphere. He's
[1:21:14] taken us oh hallelujah. Out of leodyia.
[1:21:17] He's taken us out of rich and increased
[1:21:19] with goods and and have need of nothing.
[1:21:22] And he puts us inside a pressurized
[1:21:24] atmosphere, inside of here, inside of
[1:21:27] Christ. That's what it is. Inside of the
[1:21:29] word. We don't have to be shaken by the
[1:21:32] things that are happening around us.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; Inside of here, we know the countdown's
[1:21:37] already went down or we're just waiting
[1:21:38] on the blastoff.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother Brandon said, "Get
[1:21:42] in, my brother or sister. Get
[1:21:44] pressurized. The pressure won't hurt you
[1:21:46] when you get on the inside and get
[1:21:47] pressurized." Oh, there's more pressure
[1:21:49] than there's ever been, but it's time to
[1:21:51] get inside and get pressurized tonight.
[1:21:54] Well, I know it's just a Wednesday
[1:21:55] night, but let's walk in. Let's let our
[1:21:57] atmosphere be changed. Let's close the
[1:21:59] door and walk inside because in here
[1:22:02] there's oxygen when we need it. In here
[1:22:04] there's power when we need it. In here
[1:22:06] the Holy Spirit works when we need him
[1:22:08] to work.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In here there's healing. In
[1:22:12] here there's salvation. In here our
[1:22:14] children are safe. In here under the
[1:22:16] token inside the chamber.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; What is that? In Christ.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; Who's Paul writing these things to
[1:22:24] the faithful?
[1:22:26] They're only they're not faithful
[1:22:28] because of their own works.
[1:22:30] They're faithful because they've gotten
[1:22:32] inside
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; the pressurized chamber.
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; They couldn't come out if they wanted
[1:22:37] to.
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; I know people look that say, "Well, that
[1:22:39] gives me a license to live any way I
[1:22:40] want to." No, it don't.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; That means you're not inside the
[1:22:44] pressurized chamber.
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; If you ever go inside, you want to live
[1:22:47] in that atmosphere all the time. You
[1:22:50] want to be You want to be in the Holy of
[1:22:51] Holies, in the presence of God all the
[1:22:53] time. You don't want to do anything to
[1:22:55] separate yourself
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; from that presence.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother Brandon said they
[1:23:01] can't get in Christ. You won't care what
[1:23:02] the world says. They can't never hit you
[1:23:04] anyway. You're anyhow you're safe.
[1:23:06] You're tucked in. Jesus Christ is our
[1:23:08] great glorious astronaut tube that we'll
[1:23:11] be in that we'll be propelled by the
[1:23:13] Holy Ghost and power and fire when she
[1:23:15] begins to fly out one of these mornings.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; I'm looking forward to it. Aren't you?
[1:23:24] But inside, now look what Paul says.
[1:23:26] When you're in Christ, what what's the
[1:23:28] condition inside? There is therefore
[1:23:31] now,
[1:23:33] someone say it with me. There is
[1:23:34] therefore now no condemnation.
[1:23:38] Condemnation is judgment. To them which
[1:23:41] are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after
[1:23:44] the flesh, after the spirit. Look, he
[1:23:46] said to them which are in Christ,
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; who walk not after the flesh but after
[1:23:51] the spirit, there is no judgment.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; Listen what brother Brandon says about
[1:23:56] that. You don't have to say, "Oh, if I
[1:23:58] could just quit drinking.
[1:24:01] If I could just just get in Christ
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; and it's all gone."
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I know we've got people that
[1:24:10] are dealing with things and in a church
[1:24:12] of any size. You've got addiction and
[1:24:14] things that people deal with and things
[1:24:16] that people maybe you'd never think
[1:24:18] about that. But in your own life, you
[1:24:20] know what what it is and maybe you've
[1:24:22] dealt with that in your life.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; But he brother Brandham taught us he
[1:24:25] said not to say, "Oh, if I could just
[1:24:27] quit this,
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; but to get in Christ,
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; right? If you want to quit, get in
[1:24:32] Christ.
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; If you want to live a better life, get
[1:24:35] in Christ. It's not a sevenstep program,
[1:24:38] but it's about getting inside the
[1:24:39] chamber. Well, you say, "How do I get in
[1:24:41] Christ?" Go to church, read your Bible,
[1:24:43] pray, become become closer to him.
[1:24:45] Surrender to him.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; It's the only way to get in Christ.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; Get in Christ and it's all gone. See,
[1:24:52] because your body is subject to the
[1:24:54] spirit,
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; right? See, when you come inside, the
[1:24:58] astronaut's body becomes subject to the
[1:25:01] atmosphere.
[1:25:02] Hallelujah. inside of that rocket,
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; right? It's a different atmosphere. His
[1:25:08] body is subject to the conditions
[1:25:10] inside. When you're in Christ, your body
[1:25:13] becomes subject to the conditions of the
[1:25:15] word. It's no more subject to the things
[1:25:18] of the world. They're dead. They're
[1:25:19] dead. Your sins are buried in baptism.
[1:25:22] You're a new creation in Christ. Your
[1:25:23] body becoming subject to the spirit
[1:25:25] trying to live a right kind of life. He
[1:25:27] said, "Like you women claiming you got
[1:25:28] the Holy Ghost going out here wearing
[1:25:29] shorts and things. How could you do it?
[1:25:31] How could the spirit of God and you ever
[1:25:33] let you do a thing as that? See, you you
[1:25:35] haven't went in Christ. You haven't went
[1:25:36] inside or you'd read the Bible and know
[1:25:38] that wasn't right.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; Right. But he said, "Certainly, it just
[1:25:41] can't be." So certainly it can't be.
[1:25:42] He's not a filthy spirit. He's a Holy
[1:25:44] Spirit. He said, "Then when you become
[1:25:46] subject to that spirit, it throws your
[1:25:48] whole being subject to that spirit. And
[1:25:50] that spirit is nothing in the world but
[1:25:52] this seed word made manifest, quickened,
[1:25:55] hallelujah, made alive." When the Bible
[1:25:57] said don't do this, that body quickly
[1:25:59] turns to it. There's no question.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; What is it? It's the earnest of the
[1:26:03] resurrection.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; So, we can look at and say, "Paul said
[1:26:06] it."
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; The Bible teaches it. A prophet teaches
[1:26:10] it.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; We just do it.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; We can't do anything else. Why? We're
[1:26:14] inside that pressurized chamber.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; He said that body quickly turns to
[1:26:19] there's no question. What is it? It's
[1:26:20] the earnest of the resurrection. This
[1:26:22] body will be raised up again.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. Listen to me. Some of
[1:26:27] you old folks be up running the aisles
[1:26:29] if you really if you really grabbed a
[1:26:30] hold of this revelation.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; This body will be raised up again
[1:26:36] because
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; it's already started.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, will I have rapturing
[1:26:42] faith? Will I be able?" Are you saved?
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; Did you have faith to come up out of
[1:26:49] what you were?
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; You remember what you were. You remember
[1:26:54] what the devil did in your life and how
[1:26:55] he how he run you around one side and
[1:26:57] down the other. But one day you realize
[1:26:59] you were not the son of your natural
[1:27:01] parents. You were a son or daughter of
[1:27:02] God. And when you did, you become a
[1:27:04] Christian and you become baptized by the
[1:27:06] Holy Ghost and fire. And when you did,
[1:27:08] what happened? You've entered into
[1:27:09] another kingdom.
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; And it raised up your body into, we'll
[1:27:13] talk about it as we continue in
[1:27:14] Ephesians, into what? Into heavenly
[1:27:16] places in Christ. When you are raised
[1:27:19] with him into heavenly places in Christ,
[1:27:21] what is that? If you have already been
[1:27:23] raised, if you are seated tonight in
[1:27:25] heavenly places, the the the
[1:27:27] resurrection has already begun.
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Then I don't have to worry
[1:27:35] about going into the grave, brother JT.
[1:27:37] I don't have to worry about getting old.
[1:27:39] Hallelujah. I don't have to worry about
[1:27:41] all the things that that the economy
[1:27:42] might fail or this one might fail or we
[1:27:45] know the government's going to fail. We
[1:27:46] know the economy is going to fail. We
[1:27:48] know all these things are going to
[1:27:49] happen. But I don't have to worry
[1:27:51] because inside of me a seed is already
[1:27:53] raised up to life.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; We know.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; Paul said the same thing, but he should
[1:28:02] tell us. He said there's a body already
[1:28:04] waiting.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; What is that body? Brother Brandon
[1:28:07] taught us it was a word body, a
[1:28:08] theophony body. You bypassed your
[1:28:10] theophony, but God already, it was
[1:28:12] already there in the mind of God before
[1:28:14] the foundation of the world. Then if you
[1:28:16] Hallelujah. If it was there, it meant
[1:28:19] that you never could have been lost in
[1:28:20] the first place. He always had you in
[1:28:22] his hand.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; I'm glad I come to church on a Wednesday
[1:28:30] night. I don't know about you.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; This body will be raised up again
[1:28:36] because
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; it's already started.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; It was once subject to sin and mire and
[1:28:42] corruption, but now it's got the
[1:28:44] earnest, the down payment. It's turned
[1:28:48] heavenly.
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; Listen, we who are in Christ have heard
[1:28:52] the message given by the messenger with
[1:28:55] the authority to give it,
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; And we find Christ
[1:29:01] deity in the word. Listen, as we talked
[1:29:03] about Paul being an apostle by the will
[1:29:06] of God, brother Brandham likened himself
[1:29:08] to a prospector.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; Right. Paul's job is to lay it in there.
[1:29:14] Right. The gold was there.
[1:29:16] But brother Brandon said, "I'm a
[1:29:18] prospector." He was anointed and
[1:29:20] ordained to do that from his mother's
[1:29:22] womb. Right? What was his purpose? He
[1:29:26] said, "I like to go down and dig those
[1:29:27] nuggets up."
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So So, Brother Brand, so
[1:29:33] Paul, he he he leaves some nuggets in
[1:29:35] the scripture that were hard to
[1:29:37] understand for years and years and
[1:29:39] years. People thought about it and
[1:29:41] criticized each other and one went this
[1:29:43] way and one went that way. And
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; brother Brandham come along. He said,
[1:29:47] "I'm like a 49er."
[1:29:50] Not the football team, the the miners.
[1:29:55] I'm a prospector.
[1:29:57] Come on. That's all right. I I didn't
[1:29:59] sin by saying that. Some of y'all looked
[1:30:02] at me like I I committed a sin in the
[1:30:04] house of God. Talking about football.
[1:30:07] Brother said, "I'm a prospector. I go
[1:30:10] down and dig those nuggets up and shine
[1:30:12] them up, polish them up like this. Look
[1:30:16] at them. And every one of them will
[1:30:19] reflect
[1:30:21] Jesus Christ.
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; Those who are in Christ as the musicians
[1:30:26] come tonight receive these golden
[1:30:28] nuggets and they are changed by the word
[1:30:32] to become the word
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; made flesh.
[1:30:37] This book of Ephesians
[1:30:40] was written specifically
[1:30:42] to me,
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; right? The faithful.
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; In Christ. You said, "Well, brother Ben,
[1:30:53] I haven't always been faithful, but are
[1:30:55] you in Christ?"
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; Because if you're in Christ, you're
[1:30:58] faithful in Christ.
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; It was written to you,
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; Melody. It was written to you, you
[1:31:04] girls. It was written to every one of
[1:31:06] you.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; This book was written to you to help you
[1:31:09] to understand, Jared. It was written to
[1:31:11] you, you boys. It was written to every
[1:31:14] one of you.
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; That's older folks
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; as I've identified myself with the
[1:31:19] elders. It was written to us.
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; It was written to me from Paul.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; But it took a prophet to come along.
[1:31:32] grab a hold of them golden nuggets that
[1:31:34] Paul left us and just polish them up,
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; show them to us in such a way that we
[1:31:39] could see Jesus in it. We could see his
[1:31:42] purpose and his plan that we could see
[1:31:45] our purpose by seeing that we are in
[1:31:47] him. Oh, could you just believe that
[1:31:50] tonight? It was written to me. If you
[1:31:53] could really believe that God is that
[1:31:54] much in control. I know we worry and we
[1:31:57] think, well, you know, the preacher, you
[1:31:59] know, he he said this or that or the
[1:32:02] other. But we got to believe that what
[1:32:04] God sends, he sends to us. What did he
[1:32:07] tell us in this hour? He said, "Behold,
[1:32:08] I send you Elijah.
[1:32:11] I send you Elijah." Every one of us
[1:32:14] could put our name there.
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; I send you Elijah the prophet. One day,
[1:32:19] Elijah come by your way. Whether it was
[1:32:21] whether you were old enough to remember
[1:32:23] the meetings or whether somebody told
[1:32:25] you about it or you found a book or a
[1:32:26] tape or or or you were born in a message
[1:32:28] family, God sent you, Elijah,
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; right? He was still sent to you
[1:32:34] personally.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; Why? Because hallelujah. You were one of
[1:32:38] those chosen by God before the
[1:32:40] foundation of the world.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; And now he wrote some things that were
[1:32:43] good uh you know to understand when you
[1:32:45] were a sinner. He wrote some things that
[1:32:47] you could grab a hold of when you were a
[1:32:49] young Christian, when you were
[1:32:50] justified, when you were sanctified. But
[1:32:52] now he's written some things and given
[1:32:54] us some things, some golden nuggets we
[1:32:56] can look at as believers filled with the
[1:32:58] baptism of the Holy Ghost. We can look
[1:33:00] at and say, "I know where I stand. I
[1:33:02] know who I am. I know whose I am. I know
[1:33:05] where I belong." And we can say amen to
[1:33:06] that tonight. Nothing's going to shake
[1:33:09] me. What can separate us from the love
[1:33:10] of God? Nothing can separate us from the
[1:33:13] love of God which is in Christ Jesus our
[1:33:17] Lord. Oh, I love him tonight. Don't you?
[1:33:20] Let's bow our heads together.
[1:33:22] If you're in Christ, the book of
[1:33:25] Ephesians will tell you who you are and
[1:33:26] where you're going. If you've never
[1:33:28] stepped into that pressurized chamber,
[1:33:32] would you do that today?
[1:33:36] What if you just step in?
[1:33:39] If you're watching tonight and maybe you
[1:33:41] weren't able to come tonight, you got
[1:33:42] sick or something and you just want to
[1:33:45] step in.
[1:33:47] Go ahead.
[1:33:48] You can take the pressure because that
[1:33:51] chamber was made for that. Step into the
[1:33:54] atmosphere of Christ. Step into the
[1:33:56] baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:33:59] It was written. These things were
[1:34:01] written for you and for me. I say, "God,
[1:34:05] help me to be the faithful in Christ
[1:34:07] Jesus, the saint of God that can receive
[1:34:10] these things, not by my own merits, but
[1:34:12] by what Jesus did for me that day on
[1:34:14] Calvary." Hallelujah. Heavenly Father,
[1:34:18] so thankful, Lord. Thankful for these
[1:34:21] things.
[1:34:23] God, we could preach a lot of things and
[1:34:25] we could preach hard or we could preach
[1:34:28] happy.
[1:34:30] Lord, there's a lot of things we could
[1:34:31] preach, but Lord, I believe this is your
[1:34:33] word,
[1:34:34] God. And I pray that it would strengthen
[1:34:36] us and bring maturity to our lives
[1:34:40] until, Lord, we're not just subject to
[1:34:42] whatever the devil tries to tell us
[1:34:44] because we know he's talking to us all
[1:34:46] the time, trying to tell us we're no
[1:34:48] good, trying to tell us we're not
[1:34:50] believers, trying to tell us we don't
[1:34:52] belong in the house of God. I pray you
[1:34:54] would silence the voice of the enemy
[1:34:56] today by your word which is spoken. Say,
[1:34:59] "I am in him. I am a Christian by the
[1:35:02] will of God. I've heard a messenger who
[1:35:06] came. Elijah came to me and I believe,
[1:35:09] Lord, help my unbelief." I pray you'd
[1:35:12] grant that today. I pray you'd move in
[1:35:15] every way, Lord, that only as only you
[1:35:18] can. Pray you'd heal the sick tonight,
[1:35:20] Lord. I know there's several that are
[1:35:22] out sick. Pray God you'd reach down
[1:35:24] where they're at. Lord, right now, Lord,
[1:35:27] as your presence is here, and I believe
[1:35:30] it's there, even in their home, I pray
[1:35:32] you'd reach down where they are and heal
[1:35:34] them completely.
[1:35:36] I pray you'd touch those that are in
[1:35:37] need. Oh God, how we need you, Lord. Pro
[1:35:41] protect us, keep us, we pray, till we
[1:35:43] come together again
[1:35:45] in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Thank you
[1:35:50] Lord. Hallelujah
[1:35:53] for pray.
[1:35:55] Oh where the lost and the lonely
[1:36:02] bring their burdens and their cares.
[1:36:08] This is your house.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; So do you believe you're in the house of
[1:36:14] God today? You are the house of God.
[1:36:17] Sing it together.
[1:36:21] Oh, won't you come?
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; Well, if you need prayer, the altar's
[1:36:25] open tonight. Sing it again. Oh, this is
[1:36:30] your house.
[1:36:33] Thank you, Lord.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, Father,
[1:36:37] come and dwell.
[1:36:40] Singing now.
[1:36:42] This is your house.
[1:36:46] Relieve
[1:36:50] your burdens and
