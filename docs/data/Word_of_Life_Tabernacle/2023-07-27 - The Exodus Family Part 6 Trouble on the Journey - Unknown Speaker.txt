the word we pray in Jesus name amen amen amen God bless you Exodus chapter 4 and verse 24 but Gabe you're here tonight God bless you for being here I didn't see him back there just assumed he wasn't we're going to pray for brother Gabe at the end of the service we pray for him and just believe that the Lord is going to move that's how to give the devil a black eye isn't it every one of you get the devil a black eye by showing up on a Wednesday night Lord Lord I I don't know I've been through a lot but I'm going to give the devil a black eye tonight talked about the old woman who was deaf and she just couldn't hear nothing and and she would go to church but she didn't get nothing out of it and they finally asked you said why do you keep going to church and she said well I just want to show the devil whose side I'm on so that's why you're here today so the devil whose side that you're on Amen y'all pray for me I gotta a test it's got to be run tomorrow so if you can't get a hold of me for a while I they got to put me under for a couple hours so just just keep me in your prayers I don't like to talk about those things there's nothing serious it's just something that I got to have done and and uh so if you can't get a hold of me that's why tomorrow Exodus 4 24 because it came to pass by the way in the end that the Lord met him and sought to kill him this is a strange scripture this is God's prophet this is the man who's going down to Egypt to take over just met God saw him face to face had a burning bush experience he goes down to do what God called him to do and the Lord met him and sought to kill him then Sephora that's Moses wife took a sharp Stone and cut off the foreskin of her son and cast it at his feet that surely a bloody husband art thou to me so he let him go God let Moses go then she said a bloody husband Thou Art because of the circumcision the Lord of that is blessing to the word you may be seated I want to continue tonight talking about our The Exodus family that we're going to pick that back up maybe for tonight and maybe a few more services and we we left off with Moses in this miraculous condition he's he has met God in the burning bush he knows who he is he knows what he's called to do he's been given the authority to go and do and what he's been called to do and God's been working on him for 40 years down on the back side of the desert and yet when he come in the presence of God there were some things while he was in the wilderness that he had neglected to do and in any time that you find yourself in a Wilderness spiritually or in a backslidden condition and maybe we're in those conditions more than we would like to admit you'll find that you neglect to do some things and you leave some things off and and he had he neglected to do some things with his family and when he had neglected in that way uh here he was God had given him this ability he had helped him he'd been in the presence of God but being in the presence of God doesn't absolve you of the of the necessary thing that you have to do you still got to go back and do what you promised God you would do at the beginning and and so there were many things in Moses life that needed to be corrected just like there's many things in our life that needs to be corrected and God's going to be working on us until we leave here and I'm glad of that tonight it's not just the overnight thing but he's working on you and he's working on me and he's making us what he wants us to be I'm happy about that because I I don't want to be in the condition I'm in even though I'm a saved person I filled with the Holy Spirit but yet I want to be higher I want to be able to to love him more I want there to be more clarity and and more understanding and more peace and more love more of the fruits Spirit then then what I have now and so when I know that he's not done with me yet then I know there's more for me to have and I'm so grateful for that today I think that's true of all of us we notice that Moses's neglect in forgetting the Commandment of God that he had been he had been ordained to do and this is the thing that made the Hebrews unique among all the nations it was not a little thing it was a big deal in Genesis 17 and 10 God says this is my Covenant which you shall keep between me and you and thy seed after thee he said every man child among you shall be circumcised it shall circumcise the Flesh of your foreskin and it shall be a token of the Covenant betwixt me and you and he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you he said every man child in your Generations he that is born in the house or bought with money of any stranger which is not of thy seed God wasn't leaving any exemptions here if there's a male here in your house or even a stranger that you're caring for even a servant he said he's going to be circumcised on the eighth day every one of them and he said he even the one that's bought with money he was born in thy house and he just bought with that money must needs to be circumcised and my Covenant shall be in your flesh for an Everlasting Covenant and the uncircumcised Man Child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised that Soul shall be cut off from his people he hath broken my Covenant so in the Old Testament you couldn't be saved if we could say it that way you couldn't be one of God's people you couldn't be identified as one of God's people without the sign of circumcision that that had to be done and it was important that parents did that because it wasn't up to the kids they couldn't do it they were too young and so and so the parents had to take care of that the child would not be counted as a child of God without it so brother random says there they are going down to Egypt he said and now watch how neglectful a man can get and we're talking about not just any man but a prophet a major prophet A God Called man a man who's seen the pillar of fire who knows who God is knows the power of God and yet he's neglectful he's neglectful and he says in the end God met him down there in the end and would have slayed him and Sapporo went and took a sharp Rock and circumcised her two children with a sharp prop and throwed the foreskin before Moses and said you're a bloody husband to me he said only save Moses life huh I want you to watch how God was dealing with this family because I and I think we're all uh we I've told you before we all have a Ministry but especially in Ministry families or in families and officers of the church or or you have a place in the church in that way that we have to be careful that we don't become so busy with the business of the church and with the business of what's going on at church that we don't that we neglect to do some things we need to do at home so what was Moses doing he said Moses gotten such a hustle and bustle of the day till he was in such a place to go down there he forgot the Seal of circumcision he forgot the main thing the main difference between him and everybody else the biggest thing that God told them to do to be make a a mark of demarcation of separation between him and the world was the circumcision and he forgot that seal he said and that's where we are doing today he said that's where the Holiness churches are failing we've got so much time the Lord has given us a lot of money we're building great big churches and big spiers and putting plush seats and pipe organs until we forgot the Seal of God which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost he said true God send us a zipporah oh my we're gonna get into this in a minute send us a support he said that's right circumcision he said every male in Egypt of Israel that wasn't circumcised was cut off and circumcision was the Seal of the promise circumcision the Old Testament it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost to the new and every man outside the patches of the Holy Ghost will be cut off so it's a serious thing that our hearts would be circumcised by the Holy Ghost I'm not going to hold you long tonight for your sake and for mine but our heart has to be circumcised by the Holy Ghost in Deuteronomy 36 you find where Moses spoke of it of something coming that there would be a people who'd be circumcised in heart in Romans 2 29 Paul explains that and explains that we are circumcised in heart and not in the flesh so God was it was so important to God that Moses obeyed that he was willing to take his prophet's life huh now think about it for a minute that's why he said obedience is better than sacrifice that's somebody that'll obey God God help me to be one that'll obey God that'll do the little things in the in the way that God wants me to do them but now what did Moses fail to do he had failed to give his children the same chance that he had because he was circumcised brother Bill his parents took care of him but now they didn't give his their children the same chance I know some of you come out of the world you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost you you come out of you come out of sin you come out of denominations you come out and maybe bad backgrounds or whatever but your children have to have the same chance that you have and in order to do that there's got to be an atmosphere there is whether Joel was talking about Sunday night got to be an atmosphere where our children can receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost and it's we're a responsible Church we're responsible to provide a home that there's an atmosphere that's there and whatever we have to kick out we need to kick out whatever we have to do away with we need to do away with whatever we have to do to get our kids in church we need to do that because God's going to be looking for us because we're the one responsible to make sure that atmosphere is there right so that they have the opportunity to be washed in the blood they have the opportunity to be saved just like we were saved people come in the message and give their heart to the Lord and come to an altar and then maybe 30 years later they're sitting there or 20 years later they're sitting there with children and they're sitting by themselves because they took a job that kept them out of church or or are they or they they went they got hurt at somebody and the pastor heard them or maybe they don't believe in Preachers no more so they're sitting out by themselves and they don't realize that they're not giving their children a chance come on and they die spiritually because they're not doing the thing for their children that's required now God gave this commandment brother Brandon says every male must be circumcised God when he called Moses to go down there and deliver the children of Israel Moses hadn't performed on his sons the very delivering sign he's going down to be delivered but he hadn't performed you know maybe he's thought like this he thought well maybe I'll I'll make things a little easier for my kids that's a hard surgery huh they just make things a little easier we just we just won't talk about that well you know they've been baptized they they come in the church and associate with the Believers we'll just make things a little bit easier we won't we won't have an altar call we won't have a we won't have a good old-fashioned Holy Ghost baptism well we'll just let them we'll just let them sit there and become Believers but you don't become a Believer by sitting in the church no more you become an automobile by sitting in the garage all right you become a Believer by the baptism of the Holy Ghost by the filo and that's not speaking in tongues that's not an emotion that's not a sensation but the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the literal Life of Christ manifested in you how do I know I haven't brother being because your life begins to act like his there begins to be a desire for the things of God rather than for the things of the world and our kids have to have that because if they keep their natural carnal desires every one of them will leave every one of them and you just have to pamper them but if you ever get them to the Holy Ghost you won't have to treat them like a hotbed plant but they'll be a rugged Christian now Moses said no he was a deliverer but he hadn't performed the delivering sign on his children he said would you he said it would be like me saying all you church now every one of you come in have been baptized here with water we put you on the church membership we're all going to Glory together he said well brother that's not scripture unless you're born again circumcised with the Holy Spirit he said you've got to be I don't care how good you are what church you belong to how good your parents was except you as an individual has been born again by the Holy Ghost you'll never go in the rapture I want my kids to be in the Rapture with me I want our young people to be in the Rapture with us I want the Next Generation have the same chance that we had how are they going to have that by the Deliverance sign we got to teach it we got to talk about it we got to have an atmosphere that presents that come on he said you can't go that's the very delivering sign the circumcision the circumcision is by the Holy Spirit and so they asked for the random questions send questions answers he said the questioner asked does this scripture mean that God aimed to kill Moses or his son and why he said God was after Moses and Sephora was was the only one that saved him all right amen thank God for a good spouse and watch he said for support got a sharp Rock and went and cut the foreskin off her baby and threw it before Moses said thou art a bloody husband to me what was she doing doing what needed to be done that wasn't her job right that wasn't her position but she was doing what needed to be done now I'm not talking about stepping into the pulpit or taking a stepping outside of what God called you to be as a lady or a wife or a mother but when it comes to your children and it comes to getting them in the house of God if Dad won't do it Mom you've got to do it huh somebody's got to step up and cause some dissension in a home where that where the things of God have been neglected are you with me so far I trust that's none of us tonight but I'll say this even as a pastor sometimes we neglect things at home and we need to be called to account for that and say Lord help me to do the right things in my house Church of priority help me to make the house of God a place where my my kids want to go and help me to help me to not talk bad about the church and or the pastor or the people in the church because I know my children will feed off of that help me not to be a griper and a complainer help me to be somebody that'll be on fire for God and have the right attitude I know it's hard to have a right attitude when you got everything going wrong everything's a mess it's hard to have the right attitude when everything's just uh everything's going down the hill it seems like it and you're hurting and everything's bad but there's there's a virtue in it that's when that's when you're overcoming is when you have a good attitude when you don't when you're not expected to God was after Moses the poor has saved him and God would took Moses life and perhaps the angel was standing there said Zapora catch it quickly the poor went and circumcised the baby said Moses you're so concerned about everything else and about your journey Strong Boy hasn't been circumcised oh I hope we hear it tonight Church you're so concerned about church things you're so concerned about being a deliverer so concerned about your profit work which was a great work but you're so concerned about what's going to happen what's Pharaoh gonna say what's going to happen down in Egypt are they going to believe me but you never ask about your family you never examined to see if they were in the faith see everybody wants to do something for God at church but what about our home life brother Brandon talks about he said everyone's going to India or go to go to Africa he said but I tell them if you talk to your neighbor have you witnessed to your neighbor do they know about salvation have they been born again everybody wants to do something for God but what about at home brother random talked about a preacher and a woman that we're doing missionary work and and they come and stayed in a motel together we know that's wrong amen I mean just say this for the children for the kids sake if not for ours if a man and a woman Stay Together overnight they need to be married that's just that's just the way it is I didn't make up that rule that's what a prophet of God taught us that's that's just decency at one time that was just the thing that you did that we live in a different world now and our time I remember as a kid I'm only 38 years old I say only but I'm only 38 years old but when I was a kid it was a terrible thing to see people shacking up and now it's the common thing there's more people now that are unmarried than what are married that are of marrying age because you're just not expected to get married anymore I thank God for some young people we've had some marriages lately I thank God for that thank God for you that have gotten married and instead of shacking up or living like the world living like the devil and that that part's free but but now what what happened brother man talked about that woman that preacher doing that he ought to known better but brother bear said the reason that they did he said what happened to that woman she just kept messing around without receiving the Holy Ghost he said just like that woman Over Yonder today that called me wanted to marry that man and leave her own husband and marry the man she'd come in such a place oh God you know people get so mixed up because they've not ever been they've never really really settled it with God she'd come in such a place maybe one time being in contact with God but had been lusting after the things of the world and I asked her I said have you received the Holy Ghost she said not yet but I'm seeking it I said you get the Holy Ghost first he'll tell you what husband to have you come to me as a married person tell me brother Ben I want to make sure I got the right one you know who the right one is if you're married yeah right it's the one God gave you now wow I could have prophet of God neglect the main thing in his own home it happens he was out of Fellowship he was out of Fellowship naturally there was no one there no peer pressure nobody else was circumcising their children you see the danger of that there's no there's no church pressure God uses that iron sharpens iron but that wasn't the only thing he was out of fellowship with God Moses was back there waiting and he said what did he do he went to work for his father-in-law Jethro and he was hurting his sheep out in the desert place a perfect picture before us tonight of a Believer out of fellowship with God there he was no Fellowship not one thing in that 40 years was spoke that God did for him or anyway any Supernatural he was out of fellowship and when the church gets out of fellowship with God Miracles cease signs and wonders cease Revival cease God just moves right out when you get out of Fellowship he said well what do we do what do we need to do brother Ben to have Miracles what do we need to do to have science and wonders do we need faster music do we need more people that's not what we need why do we need a good old house cleaning we need to get back in fellowship with God whatever stopped up the conduit between us and God get rid of that repentance is always the way to Revival are you with me now foreign I'm preaching it myself as well as you well the random said Miracle cease God just moves right out when you get out of Fellowship he said but the thing to do you want to know what to do keep the love of God in your heart keep fellowship with him and he will add these other things just as we mature I love that so support is temper I think about it saved a prophet's life laughs brother Branham said when and I'll keep down here because I don't want to take much time tonight but he said he was taking his own son to deliver the children of Israel uncircumcised he said you know did you ever study that right close Moses had a temper you know that finally kept him out of the promised land his temper and God had set him back out there and give him a little high tempered wife too he said I bet they had some trouble on the backside of that desert yeah God knows how to tame you down aren't you glad he does you said but brother Ben I thought when I got in contact with the burning bush when I well when I received the Holy Ghost everything would just be okay you're still a sticky nature you're still you God's still got some molding he's still got some working our place at the altar is not only when we're safe in fact you don't even have to come to the altar to be saved you just have to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ be baptized but our place many times is at the altar as Christians why because we need to we need to get back to some of them things we've neglected so God works on us and the way he works on Moses was to give him a high tempered wife I hope he hasn't worked on you in that way but God knows how to tame you down me down right she cut off that foreskin and throwed it before and said you're a bloody husband he said my he knew how to fix him up take that temper out of him God was doing something for Moses he married an Ethiopian girl and she had a lot of temper Moses had a lot of temper that was his trouble the Brandon one place called it his besetting sin I just imagine things wasn't so peaceful back there on the back of the desert at times but God gave it to him he said now if you think you married a woman has a little temper maybe God's trying to tame you down a little at least the wives should have said amen of course if you say Amen to that you're admitting you have a tempers he said you know Moses had a temper and God give him the wife my name is Zapora she had one too so I imagine everything wasn't so pleasing back on the back side of the desert for a while when both of their tempers got out of control at the same time that don't sound very pleasant does it imagine what it must have been like what it must have felt like for the people of God because this didn't end like this was something they worked on all through God was working on Moses and we know Moses still had a temper because he missed the promised land because of it all right so God's working he put him with his high tempered woman all of his life he works on him imagine what it must have been like in their tent here's Prophet Moses and all the people walking around saying Prophet Moses he don't do nothing wrong well he's got the spirit of Christ and he did the Bible says he did he had it what looked like a better idea than God but remember that was the spirit of Christ on him when he stepped in the gap for the people he still had a high tempered wife and a high temp for himself I imagine there were people who slandered him because of it in fact we know that there were people who made fun of her but I love the fact that she may have been high tempered but she was Moses wife and when Moses sister and his brother listen this improves to you too that the marriage relationship comes before the family relationship why because when when Miriam and Aaron made fun of sappora God said you made fun of Moses right because he didn't say that about the brother and the sister right but he said that about the wife because these two are one she was God's choice for him probably wouldn't have been our choice he said I suppose his intellectual conception of how psychology ought to control a person didn't do much good because when he was on his road down to Egypt I see sapora still had a temper I always wondered about folks that fought all the time why do that right why do that but there's something worse it's when you don't care it is worse and if you don't care whether it's your spiritual relationship or your natural relationship if you don't care you need to Shake Yourself that's a dangerous place to be notice he failed miserably failed and run into the desert for another 40 years while God had him back on the back side of the desert we're married this Ethiopian woman Zapora and she was high tempered Moses was to I guess there was some little trouble in the backside of the desert once in a while he said don't turn your wife down because she's got a little temper maybe that's your cross well it got quiet he said God might have give it to kind of keep you lined up same thing he said with you women to your husbands stick together you promised God you would so stay with it he said notice I'm a person don't believe in marriage and divorce you know that look my brother if you went at that more prayerfully there'd be less of it amen we're a church that don't believe in marriage and divorce right because brother Branham didn't I understand people get messed up it's not the unpardonable sin but we don't believe in marriage and divorce we want the marriages to last forever and I believe if we'll do our part and teach the people in the right way when they're old they won't depart from it somehow God will keep them now but again the poorest temp for what seemed to be a fault and it was a fault temper the wrath of man doesn't work the righteousness of God it was a fault but God put them two faults together to help both of them but that temper saved Moses life and and sometimes you know when marriage goes bad we tend to blame all of our problems on our spouse the same thing's true of a spiritual sense I've noticed that people who leave the message their life goes bad for something happens and they lose their confidence or they lose their faith and then they begin to blame everything on the message well the reason I'm bankrupt and living in the back of a school bus is the message and and it had very little to do with the message all right man it had to do with somebody's interpretation of the message you had very little to do with the message of the hour but now uh people people blame the message over that but the same thing happens in with a husband and wife many times when a marriage goes bad that you tend to blame everything on them let's say well if it wasn't for you I'd have went to school and got a real job if it wasn't for you I well I tell you what it wasn't for you I wouldn't have so many kids it wouldn't cost me so many problems two what if the person that God gave us literally saved our life by being all the things that we dislike about them let me say that again what if the person God gave us literally saves our life by being all the things we dislike about them you say it can't happen it did with Moses maybe God knew that you needed somebody who wouldn't put up with your nonsense praise God maybe God knew that you needed somebody who would be an encourager it would be a helper but maybe he knew you needed somebody who could be who could who could who could sin right toe-to-toe with you sometimes that's what you need now and so we look at Abraham and Sarah it's Abraham saved Sarah's life you remember what was it God couldn't kill Sarah because of Abraham oh there's a great spiritual truth here Church her marriage saved her life because she laughed at the promise of God she laughed at the at the word being open to her was the messenger of the hour here was god with skin on him sitting out there revealing the secrets of of of Abraham's heart and when he did she laughed made fun of it should have died for it laughed in the face of God but God couldn't kill her brother bear said that's Grace he said God would assume her right there but he couldn't he said oh he said see our stupidity he'd kill every one of us but he can't kill Sarah he had to take Abraham because Sarah was a part of Abraham they were one in Union and to take the church and destroy it he can't do it because it's part of himself Christ part of himself the word being made flesh well I'm so glad I'm a part of him that's good let's go back for a minute what again what caused the trouble at home for Moses and Sephora neglect how is it resolved by doing what had been neglected right go back where you left off I was to do your first works you you neglected something neglect is a it's a terrible thing brother Abraham says this he said you say I have a holy thirst but I'm not guilty brother I'm gonna just go and joining church and things like this he said but see to neglect a thirst if you neglect to satisfy a thirst of water or food you'll die if you neglect that thirst and you for God you will spiritually die he said you call for revivals you wait for your church to have a Revival well that ain't the Revival for you the Revival ought to begin right into you when you begin to thirst for God there might not be another member of the church wanting that Revival but if it breaks out on you it'll break out in other places but see you neglect that thirst he said you neglect to Milk The Cow when the udder is full of milk you let that cow stay like that she'll go dry that's exactly right if you neglect to take a drink of water say I just ain't going to drink anymore you'll die you neglect to eat food you'll die he said if you neglect to give the Holy Spirit the word of God you'll die something as simple as reading your Bible did you neglect to do that you'll die there's always an action and a reaction I heard a story about out in the desert in in the west they had a pump and it had to be primed before you get any water out of the well the pump had to be primed so they had a bucket of water sitting there there's two things that you could do and you saw it you could either obey the instructions had a little sign on it telling you what to do and pump the thing believing that there was going to be water come or you could drink the water but if someone ever drank the water the next person that came would die because they didn't prime the pump there had to be somebody pouring the water on to get anything out of it that's true of Christian Life that's true of marriage you can't neglect to prime the pump Moses knew to circumcised his sons he just didn't do it most husbands and wives know what it would take for their marriage to be right they just neglect doing it I realize there's some knots they're very hard to untie but most people know what to do and they just don't do it the early church knew what to do to get back in favor with God they didn't die from lack of knowledge they didn't slip into apostasy from a lack of Doctrine what did they slip from they lost their first love huh they lost it they lost that bucket of water and then one day they went to the water and it was it was wasn't wouldn't produce water anymore why because they drank the water and they formed a Creed or a denomination instead of priming the pump many times we come to the house of God we're looking for God to do something for us but have you prime the thumb have you poured the water on the handle have you primed the pump where it'll work have you given God your praise have you have you prayed have you read your Bible have you prayed have you talked to God he said brother man are you trying to condemn a snow I'm not trying to make you feel bad you don't feel any worse than I do when I preach on these Saints because many times we neglect God but I'll say this I'm not trying to do that I'm trying to get you to prime the pump because I know what the results will be but the game I know what the results will be of you coming to the house of God even though you didn't feel like it I know what the results will be of a church that gets down on their knees before God and begins to cry out for Revival I I know what the results will be but then we've seen it too many times if you've been around very long you've seen God move when somebody prime the pump somebody put their praise in somebody testified somebody worshiped God somebody got down to business with God you've seen what God could do and I'm ready to see God moving again I'm not going to go on yesterday's Revival I want to see him move tonight then I gotta put into work the necessary work that has to be done the early church knew what to do they lost their first love the poorer did what needed to be done even though it wasn't her job you know marriage has lasted many times because someone decided they would your spouse sometimes wants to lay out a church you go anyway and won't pray and read the Bible you do it anyway they're all human right you sit there and point fingers you can just do what needs to be done the Bible says it this way he said what Noah said oh wife whether Thou shalt save the husband sir how knows thou man whether Thou shalt save thy wife see people who see married to the 50 50 splitter in a dangerous place because they're always going to feel like the other person isn't doing their part you know marriage is like sweet tea now forgive me I come up with this illustration all by myself to get good sweet tea there's a few tricks a few things you have to do first of all you've got to warm up the water yeah we used to make sun tea anybody do that that's a little different it don't taste like sweet tea to me there's a way that sweet tea has to be made right and it's not in a coffee maker sweet tea needs to be made a certain way you warm up the water and when the water is warm before it's diluted you don't let it sit on the stove for an hour or two hours or five hours but what do you do while it's hot you pour it in The Jug you all know what I'm talking about and then what do you do you pour sugar in it while it's hot now up north and when I was a kid you know when we were growing up we were we were underprivileged we didn't have sweet tea at least not at restaurants because I grew up in the far north region of Central Missouri West Central Missouri praise God we got some main manners I grew up in the far regions and and up there they didn't have sweet tea in restaurants until McDonald's came along with sweet tea we didn't know what that tasted like we had sweet tea at home but it wasn't as sweet as my wife's sweet tea because she'd come from Mississippi so I had to learn how it was done but we thought we had sweet tea you know what we did we I know I'm going way off the beaten path just hang with me for a minute you know what we did we took a cold glass of tea with ice in it and poured sugar in it all right and they Jason's about to die up here sounds awful doesn't it poor sugar and then you got the grains the sugar you know just floating around in the cup so you're drinking tea and sugar but you're not drinking sweet tea what happened it's not 50 50. it becomes one see in order oh God in order for the tea and the sugar and the ice to kind the water to come together it's got to be brewed it's got to be put together while it's hot and the sugar has to be poured in while it's hot and some people 20 years later don't realize that why why are these flowers not working anymore well you didn't do it while it was hot it's good anyway you didn't pour any sugar in while it was hot I'll tell you young couples keep it alive keep it alive pour the sugar in all the top put plenty in there Make It Sweet because you want it to be one unit you can't if you neglect to do that you're going to end up and what you have to do marriage is just reheating over and over and over and over again because as it sits there but you got to keep making it keep making it keep making it what are you doing first you warm it up and then you pour the sugar in and then you then you begin to be one unit again see Jesus when he comes and Woos us when he comes in and deals with us he doesn't neglect us but from the beginning he's wooing us to him even when we were children we didn't understand but he was calling us to him and at the right time when he when he got us heated up in the right atmosphere we came to him and then he poured the sugar in amen and he caused us to become one with him he did what needed to be done well I love that Through the Bible says husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it what did Jesus do he did what needed to be done when we were Sinners alienated without God in the world in that buck of mud as soon as I talked about this morning God came to us God sought you you never sought God no man can come to me except the father draws him first and God came down in that muck what you were and sought you out and brought you out he said that ought to create a perfect love look what you was and look what you are what did that somebody that loves you can't you have faith in what he's promised you then real genuine love will create a confidence in his word oh my God musicians go ahead and come huh I want to show brother Branham told us tells a story over and over again on the message about a man named Sam Isler Sam user was the state senator from Indiana from the Jeffersonville area and one day brother Branham after his wife and his daughter die and at that time I believe if understand the story correctly Billy Paul was really sick and he goes up there to the to the place and add to the cemetery he's up there he talks about how he could just hear the the song you know there's a land beyond the river we call the sweet forever and he's he's real emotional about it he said he was standing there and and Sam Isler the state senator stops his car and he comes up to the he comes up to him and and he begins to talk to him he said Billy he said I know what you've been through he said I I seen your your wife die he said and I've seen you this Sam Isler that's a picture of him in the in the newspaper it tells about him running for state senator just so you could put a face with a name but Sam I sir was a a man who who had seen brother Branham and he said I've seen you pray all night he was a man who had him sings he played the guitar and brother Branham would go to those hymn sings and sing with him he said I've seen you sing all night and worship God I've seen he said I know that you get you you've done so much for God he said what's what keeps you he said have you kept your religion he said I haven't kept my religion he said this kept me and he said he said what's keeping you he said do you still love him oh my that's a good question isn't it do you still love him he said I can't help but love him but Joey said if he sent me to hell I'd still love him you've heard brother Brandon say that that's where it come from was that conversation he said if I if he sent me to hell today I'd still love him because I didn't seek Him He sought me he found me he called me don't you see the Redemptive power of overwhelming love I preached to you about it before but you take your love that's so strong that won't take no for an answer that'll stand there and do what needs to be done and Jesus did what needed to be done for for for brother Branham and so he said how could I not love him if he sends me to hell now it's a hypocrite I'd still love him he said there's no love in hell but he said he's so much in my heart I'd still love him anyway oh God I wonder if that's the way we are tonight you realize how many marriages would be saved if somebody was willing to do what needs to be done to save it whatever needed to be done you realize how many how many Christians would still be in church if they recognize that somebody did what needed to be done all I'm doing is returning that love that's an easy thing to do that's not hard listen brother Branham he goes through he excuse me he goes through hell and back he's lost everything he told his life story this has always struck my heart and he says this he's he's praying at the end of it he gets to where he can't he can't tell it no more he's not done but he just he's too emotional he can't tell it he said I've tried with all my heart dear Jesus to live for you to do the thing he said no matter what this cross is or how scornful it seems to be listen to these words I love you dear Jesus you've broken my heart over and over but I love you what was Jesus doing from what needed to be done why why do you go through what you go through him doing what needed to be done it's hard for us to understand that but the game we don't understand why God deals with us the way he does but he's doing what needs to be done take us home with him would you bow your heads with me [Music] maybe we could just all of us [Music] maybe we've neglected something in our prayer life Maybe maybe with our children we've taken every opportunity to skip church I don't know I I know people I'm not talking about people going on vacation and things that happens but just when the desire is not there anymore [Music] you just don't feel like that Love's like it used to be turn up the stove you can't make good sweet tea without warm water you can't have a good relationship with Jesus Christ without doing what needs to be done he did everything he can do he's done to will you to him to bring him to you to him the only thing left is human will that's the one thing he can't do for you you realize that he gave you put you on free moral agency that's the one thing he can't do for you but he's wooing you he's calling to you and if you ever get a picture if you ever recognize what he did for you Lord you've loved me with overwhelming love Let Me Love You Like That God and if I've neglected something while I was in the wilderness of pain while I was in the wilderness of uncertainty while I was in the wilderness of a vaccinating condition and I find out later what it was oh God let me let me call out to you Lord let me be willing to do what needs to be done even if it's even if it's hard even if it's even if it's discouraging even if it's painful let me do what needs to be done to have a relationship to fix things at home maybe some of you married couples I know myself I I look back and think well I've neglected my wife in this area I've neglected this or that you want your husband to love you but maybe there's something that's been neglected yeah you can't control him you do what needs to be done let God work on him you can't control her but you do what needs to be done let God work on her it'll be all right do the hard stuff even after you've come to God and you've been I don't mean to just keep talking to you but as we're sitting here in his presence tonight I even if everything you see my world's going good but make sure you don't neglect the important things won't only have so many opportunities to do them thank God that God gave Moses another opportunity [Music] there in the desert but it wasn't even Moses it did it was his wife that saved his life Lord help me to be a person sensitive enough to the angel of the Lord that I could save the life of my spouse or my children my church but doing what needs to be done at the moment it needs to be done granted Lord Heavenly Father s were just talking to you just Mr Wednesday night Lord just another day but I ask you Lord take away the neglect oh God revealed to me Lord if there's something I've neglected to do whether it's in my marriage or Lord in my in the church or if
