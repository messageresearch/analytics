[34:12] that [singing] taught
[34:15] my heart
[34:17] [music]
[34:17] to fear
[34:20] and grace
[34:22] my [music and singing] fears.
[34:26] Relieved.
[34:29] Oh, how [singing] precious
[34:33] [music] did
[34:36] that grace [singing]
[34:38] [music]
[34:39] appear
[34:41] me down.
[34:44] I first
[34:47] leave through many danger to snares
[34:50] [music] all through me.
[34:54] Many [music and singing] danger
[34:57] falls
[35:00] and stairs
[35:02] I [singing]
[35:03] have
[35:05] already [music]
[35:08] come.
[35:11] Oh, [singing] his grace
[35:15] has brought me [music] safe
[35:20] thus far
[35:22] and his [music and singing] grace
[35:25] will.
[35:28] I like this one here. when we've been
[35:30] there 10,000 years. [music]
[35:32] Oh, will [singing]
[35:34] we
[35:36] been there
[35:38] 10,000 [singing and music]
[35:41] years
[35:44] bright shineing [singing]
[35:47] as
[35:49] the [music] sun.
[35:53] Oh, we [singing] know [music]
[35:56] less days
[35:59] to sing
[36:02] God's praise [music] than when we
[36:07] [singing] first
[36:10] begun. With all your hearts now, praise
[36:12] God. [music] Praise God. Oh, praise God.
[36:17] Oh, praise [singing] God.

[36:48] Praise [music] God.
[36:51] Praise [singing] God.
[36:54] [music]
[36:55] Amen. Do you love him tonight? Amen.
[36:57] We're going to go ahead and go to the
[36:59] word to Romans uh chapter 10 verse1
[37:02] [music] 14. That's all the music we'll
[37:03] do right now. We're going to have prayer
[37:05] in just a moment. Romans chapter 10 and
[37:08] verse 14.
[37:10] Um we'll read down through verses verse
[37:13] 17.
[37:15] It's good to be back with you.
[37:17] We uh had a good time and and uh got
[37:22] some rest and and ended up preaching
[37:24] several times as well. We were out there
[37:26] and and speaking to some young people
[37:28] and doing a ministers meeting and did
[37:30] some different stuff that we don't
[37:31] normally get to do. So, I was grateful
[37:34] to be able to do that and and me and
[37:36] Britney got did get some rest and got to
[37:38] see a part of the country we don't
[37:39] normally get to see. So, we were just
[37:42] real privileged to do that. And but it's
[37:45] so good to be back home. You know,
[37:46] there's no place that I come and preach
[37:48] at that has as good a atmosphere when I
[37:53] come to the pulpit as right here at home
[37:55] and the expectation of the people. So,
[37:57] we sure appreciate all of you coming and
[37:59] and being here. I did speak with uh
[38:03] someone who would know and brother Marty
[38:04] did pass away at about 5:45 this
[38:07] evening. But let's just be praying for
[38:09] that family and that church. I I think
[38:12] brother Marty Mccomomas was the first
[38:14] person that I ever met from this area.
[38:16] Uh I was probably seven or eight years
[38:18] old when I first met Brother Marty. So
[38:20] he was an old-timer here in the area. So
[38:22] let's just be praying for them and the
[38:24] Lord would would bless them and help
[38:27] them through the time of grief. and it'd
[38:30] be really hard on a church. So, if
[38:31] there's anything we could do to help
[38:32] them, we'd sure be glad to do that. And
[38:35] and uh we want to do that. Uh Sunday
[38:37] will be our Thanksgiving dinner.
[38:40] And uh so we have uh uh Sunday morning
[38:45] we'll have church, then we'll have our
[38:47] Thanksgiving dinner. So, bring something
[38:49] Thanksgivingy if you would. And uh it's
[38:52] always a good time. Um, we're going to
[38:55] do something maybe a little bit
[38:56] different at 3:00. Instead of having a
[38:58] regular service, we might do a a little
[39:01] bit of a worship service at 3:00. So,
[39:04] and if that works out, we'll do that.
[39:06] Otherwise, we just uh won't do anything
[39:08] at all. But I think we'll I think we can
[39:10] have a worship service and just enjoy
[39:12] the presence of the Lord. Sometimes it's
[39:13] hard to hear preaching after eating
[39:15] turkey. So, but uh I'm kind of looking
[39:18] forward to that. Brother Kobe Martin is
[39:19] supposed to be in town. So, if he'll
[39:21] stay for that, I'm going to be preaching
[39:23] Sunday morning, but if he'll stay and
[39:24] help us with that worship, it'd be a
[39:26] good time. I'm sure. Romans chapter 10
[39:29] and verse 14. How then shall they call
[39:31] on him in whom they have not believed?
[39:33] And how shall they believe in him of
[39:35] whom they have not heard? And how shall
[39:38] they hear without a preacher?
[39:41] And how shall they preach except they be
[39:43] sent? As it is written, how beautiful
[39:45] are the feet of them that preach the
[39:47] gospel of peace and bring glad tidings
[39:50] of good things. Verse 16, but they have
[39:53] not all obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah
[39:55] said, Lord, who who hath believed our
[39:58] report? So then faith cometh by hearing,
[40:02] and hearing by the word of God. Let's
[40:05] bow our heads together for a word of
[40:07] prayer.
[40:08] Heavenly Father, I just want to take
[40:10] this time and and pray for our brothers
[40:12] and sisters. Lord, the Mccomomas family.
[40:15] I pray that you'd help them tonight. And
[40:18] Lord, comfort sister Brenda, Lord, and
[40:20] the and the family. I pray you'd comfort
[40:23] I know Brother Freddy Hatfield and his
[40:25] wife and different ones, parts of the
[40:26] family, Lord, friends of ours. I pray
[40:28] that you'd just bless them tonight and
[40:31] help them in their time of loss. Comfort
[40:33] them. I pray God that you'd help those
[40:36] that are sick tonight. I think of sister
[40:37] Alice and and different ones that our
[40:40] brothers in West Plains, Brother JT and
[40:42] Sister Fritz and different ones that
[40:43] have not been feeling well. I pray you'd
[40:45] help them, Lord. And Lord, we know that
[40:47] you're a a prayer answering God. We pray
[40:50] for Brother Robert Smith, Lord. I know
[40:51] he's been sick while we were away. I
[40:53] pray, God, that you'd help them, Lord.
[40:55] And we know that you're still a healer
[40:57] to tonight. So, we claim that healing.
[40:59] We we claim that in the name of the Lord
[41:01] Jesus Christ. pray that you'd move in
[41:04] this service, move me out of the way and
[41:05] speak directly to your people. We pray
[41:08] in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you. You
[41:10] could be seated.
[41:14] I want to speak to you tonight on how to
[41:16] hear the word of God. How to hear word
[41:19] of God is a little bit different
[41:21] subject, but it's something that come to
[41:23] my heart. Uh because we've heard
[41:25] different preachers, I know, here at the
[41:27] church lately, not just me. And that's a
[41:29] good thing uh to hear different
[41:31] preachers. But sometimes you get used to
[41:33] hearing the word a certain way and uh
[41:36] you hear it a different way and maybe it
[41:38] it kind of crosses you a little bit or
[41:40] or you don't understand it. And yet we
[41:43] need all of God's men, don't we? We need
[41:45] all all of God's uh the five-fold
[41:48] ministry. We're going to talk about that
[41:49] tonight. We know that faith comes by
[41:51] hearing. And I know most of us who are
[41:54] here on a Wednesday night are faithful
[41:56] to church. We're faithful to read our
[41:58] Bibles. We're faithful to listen to the
[42:00] message. And yet our our faith sometimes
[42:03] it seems like it doesn't increase in
[42:05] proportion to our listening. Have you
[42:08] ever experienced that? Seem like you're
[42:10] listening but your faith is not
[42:12] increasing in proportion to your
[42:14] listening. And sometimes I wonder if
[42:16] we're hearing the sound but not the
[42:20] voice.
[42:21] &gt;&gt; The sound of it but not the voice of it.
[42:24] because the voice would be the
[42:26] particular words that are being spoken,
[42:29] the particular uh uh the the idea that's
[42:32] being conveyed. So, we're hearing the
[42:34] sound. And I know I do that many times.
[42:37] We'll listen to a tape and maybe not
[42:39] really hearing what God wants to speak
[42:41] to us through the tape or through the
[42:43] minister, however he might want to get
[42:46] that to us. And so we we know that the
[42:49] Israelites listened uh they they
[42:51] listened to Moses. They listened to the
[42:53] prophets. They listened even in Jesus'
[42:56] time, but they did not hear many times
[42:59] what they were listening to because they
[43:01] were in an atmosphere of disobedience.
[43:03] So when when you're listening to the
[43:06] word of God, it matters what atmosphere
[43:08] that you're listening in. Because if
[43:11] you're in an atmosphere to hear the
[43:13] voice of God, an atmosphere of faith, an
[43:15] atmosphere that says, "Lord, won't you
[43:18] speak to me? Won't you Did you come that
[43:20] way tonight? Lord, I want to hear from
[43:22] you." If you're in that kind of an
[43:24] atmosphere, then you can really hear
[43:26] from God. But if you're not in that kind
[43:28] of an atmosphere, then there's an
[43:30] atmosphere of disobedience many times or
[43:32] an atmosphere of unbelief and you can't
[43:34] really hear from God like you ought to.
[43:36] &gt;&gt; Right. True. So, uh, the the the Bible
[43:40] tells us that the eyes of the Jews were
[43:43] blinded because false teachers created
[43:46] an atmosphere of unbelief
[43:48] by tradition. In Romans 10:18, to
[43:50] continue on with where we read our text,
[43:53] he said, but I say, have they not heard?
[43:55] Yes, verily their sound went into all
[43:57] the earth, and their words unto the ends
[43:59] of the world. But I say, did not Israel
[44:02] know? First, Moses said, "I will provoke
[44:04] you to jealousy by them that are no
[44:07] people, and by foolish nation, I will
[44:09] anger you." But Isaiah is very bold and
[44:12] saith, I was found to them that sought
[44:14] me not. I was made manifest unto them
[44:16] that asked not after me. But to Israel,
[44:18] he said, "All day long, I have stretched
[44:21] forth my hands unto a disobedient and
[44:23] cainsaying people." So, he's saying that
[44:25] they heard it. They heard the sound of
[44:28] it, but they didn't hear the purpose of
[44:30] it. and and it is because of their
[44:32] disobedience and the hardness of their
[44:34] heart. In Matthew 13 and 10, we're going
[44:37] to read a lot of scripture tonight, so
[44:38] just bear with me. In Matthew 13:10,
[44:41] Jesus gives the parable of the swer and
[44:44] his disciples have a question because
[44:46] they hear the parable. How how many
[44:49] times do we hear what the word says and
[44:52] we think, is this for me? Right? Is this
[44:55] for us? Does this apply to us? Yeah.
[44:57] &gt;&gt; And so, uh, Peter actually asked him, he
[45:00] said, he said, "Does this apply?" The
[45:02] disciples came and said, "Why speakest,
[45:04] uh, thou unto them in parables?" And,
[45:07] and he answered and said unto them,
[45:08] "Because it is given to you to know the
[45:11] mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but
[45:14] to them it is not given." I'm so glad to
[45:16] be one of those to whom that is given.
[45:19] He said, "For whoever has, to him it'll
[45:20] be given, and he shall have more
[45:22] abundance. Whoever has not, from him
[45:24] shall be taken away even what he has."
[45:26] He said, "Therefore I speak to them in
[45:28] parables, because seeing they they see
[45:30] not, and hearing they hear not, neither
[45:32] do they understand, and in them is
[45:34] fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah, which
[45:36] saith, by hearing you shall hear and
[45:38] shall not understand. Seeing you shall
[45:40] see and shall not perceive." He said,
[45:42] "Their heart is waxed gross. Their ears
[45:44] are dull of hearing. Their eyes they've
[45:46] closed lest at any time they should
[45:48] see." So they didn't have a will to
[45:51] hear. Their will was to not hear or or
[45:54] to not listen or to not believe. He
[45:57] said, "Lest they should understand with
[45:58] their heart should be converted and I
[46:01] should heal them. But blessed are your
[46:03] eyes, for they see and your ears for
[46:05] they hear."
[46:06] &gt;&gt; Right?
[46:07] &gt;&gt; He said, "For verily I say unto you,
[46:08] many prophets and righteous men have
[46:10] desired to see those things which you
[46:13] see and have not seen them. To hear
[46:15] those things which you hear and have not
[46:16] heard them." And he said, "Hear ye
[46:18] therefore the parable of the swer. Hear
[46:21] it." He said, "I want you to hear it in
[46:23] a different way. I want you to hear it
[46:25] with your heart. I want to hear want you
[46:28] to hear what I'm really trying to tell
[46:30] you."
[46:31] &gt;&gt; So, we know the Pharisees heard that.
[46:33] They listened. They they heard the sound
[46:35] of Jesus as he gave these parables. The
[46:38] Sadducees heard, but to them, he was
[46:40] just another teacher with a story to
[46:43] tell. But the Bible says, "Unto us was
[46:45] the gospel preached as well as unto
[46:47] them, but the word preached did not
[46:50] profit them, not being mixed with faith
[46:53] in them that heard it." So if we want to
[46:56] if we want to receive something from the
[46:58] word, because the object of hearing the
[47:00] word is not just to hear the word, but
[47:02] it's to build our faith.
[47:04] &gt;&gt; Is to produce faith. It's to produce a
[47:06] life of faith, something that can
[47:08] believe the word of God. And so if we
[47:10] want to believe the word of God, we've
[47:12] got to be profited by the word and and
[47:14] we've got to have faith in our
[47:16] listening. So if the word preached is
[47:18] heard in faith, it increases faith. But
[47:21] unbelief does not receive it. So it's
[47:24] got to be mixed with faith. An
[47:27] atmosphere of faith must be created for
[47:30] us to hear what is being said. I love
[47:33] this quote. I've read it to you before,
[47:35] but it's a very important one. Brother
[47:36] Brandham said, "Where faith is taught in
[47:38] a church, you'll find a church in that
[47:41] atmosphere."
[47:43] &gt;&gt; Right? Where faith is taught in a
[47:45] church, you'll find a church in that
[47:47] atmosphere. That's why I said I love to
[47:49] preach to you because I know that you're
[47:51] wanting to hear the word of God. And so,
[47:53] you're not you're not coming with
[47:55] suspicion. You're not coming with an
[47:57] idea, well, I I'll watch him real close
[47:59] and see if he crosses the word, but
[48:01] you're expecting to hear the word of
[48:03] God. And so when you come expecting
[48:05] that's what you'll get. And so he said
[48:07] faith is taught in a church and you'll
[48:09] find a church in that atmosphere. He
[48:11] said that's the reason people come among
[48:13] the saints where they're praying
[48:14] believers. He said Paul said he didn't
[48:17] find any in the city only Timothy that
[48:18] was like precious faith that he had. He
[48:21] said the rest of them was all
[48:22] denominational. But when he got into
[48:24] that atmosphere, see he you find things
[48:26] going on that the atmosphere has
[48:29] created.
[48:30] &gt;&gt; Now think about that for a minute. So
[48:32] you get into among a group of people
[48:34] where faith is being preached. He said
[48:36] then he said that that creates an
[48:38] atmosphere among the people in that
[48:41] group and he said you find things going
[48:43] on that that atmosphere is created. You
[48:46] find people living by faith when you get
[48:48] into a place where it says my why the
[48:51] Bible is true.
[48:52] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[48:53] &gt;&gt; Right. That's a very simple thing isn't
[48:55] it? But it's just an atmosphere of faith
[48:57] that you can get into that you can say
[48:59] why the Bible is true. God heals. How
[49:02] many believe that tonight? Oh, if we
[49:04] could just get into an atmosphere of
[49:06] faith, whether we're here in the service
[49:08] or maybe you're watching in a in a
[49:10] hospital room or wherever that you're
[49:11] at, to get into that atmosphere of faith
[49:13] and say, "God is a healer. The Bible is
[49:16] the truth."
[49:19] &gt;&gt; He said, "You walk around their
[49:20] congregation, you find, well, I I was
[49:23] dying with cancer. I was healed."
[49:25] &gt;&gt; We've got some testimonies of that.
[49:28] &gt;&gt; I was once blind, I see. Hallelujah.
[49:31] &gt;&gt; And the stranger will say, "Woo, my what
[49:35] you mean? What was the matter with you?"
[49:37] And he said, "I'll show you on my
[49:39] record. Come home with me." Now, now you
[49:41] can't do this unless you meet together.
[49:45] &gt;&gt; Right? If you stay home, you can't do
[49:47] this.
[49:48] &gt;&gt; But if you come to the house of God, you
[49:50] can come in an atmosphere of faith. Now,
[49:52] you can have an atmosphere of faith in
[49:53] your home, but but it you can't you
[49:56] can't have the benefit of somebody
[49:59] else's testimony.
[50:01] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[50:02] &gt;&gt; Unless you actually meet that person.
[50:04] That's why it's important to go to
[50:06] meetings, to have meetings, to
[50:07] fellowship, not just in our church, but
[50:09] with other churches,
[50:11] &gt;&gt; right? Because it creates an atmosphere
[50:12] of faith. So, he said, he said, "Invite
[50:15] them over. Come eat dinner with me. I'll
[50:17] show you something. I got a record up
[50:18] there. My neighbors know I was in this
[50:20] kind of condition. and I was paralyzed
[50:21] for years and I was prayed for. See,
[50:23] what is it that word in that church,
[50:25] that group of believers has created that
[50:28] atmosphere?
[50:29] &gt;&gt; He said, "Now, how is the word in its
[50:32] simplicity but yet in its completeness
[50:34] ever going to grow into a place where
[50:36] knowledge overshadows that and says it
[50:39] can't be so?" So as long as the
[50:41] atmosphere of faith is there, as long as
[50:44] the people are getting together and
[50:45] talking about the things of God and
[50:47] testifying of the things of God, he
[50:49] said, "How is it ever?" Oh, church,
[50:51] that's what we want to be. We don't want
[50:53] to be in a church where that atmosphere
[50:54] of unbelief can never overshadow the
[50:57] atmosphere of faith.
[50:59] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[51:00] &gt;&gt; Where knowledge overshadows it. Since it
[51:02] can't be so, so it can't. So where
[51:03] knowledge is preached from a seminary,
[51:06] the children die.
[51:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah. But where faith is preached from
[51:10] the word,
[51:11] &gt;&gt; the children live.
[51:14] &gt;&gt; He said, "That's the difference. Life
[51:15] and death." Oh, if you find somebody
[51:17] that's alive, if you find a church
[51:19] that's alive, a family that's alive,
[51:21] it's because they're hearing the word of
[51:23] God and it's producing faith in their
[51:25] lives.
[51:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:29] Now, we know we we can only really
[51:32] receive what's being preached in the
[51:35] atmosphere of faith if it's the pure
[51:37] word.
[51:38] &gt;&gt; Right.
[51:38] &gt;&gt; Right. Cuz we're eagles. We don't eat
[51:41] We don't eat uh half dead or dead Karen
[51:44] from another age. We eat the fresh kill
[51:48] of the word.
[51:50] &gt;&gt; So, we know a preacher is telling us the
[51:52] truth when he preaches the word. That's
[51:56] simple enough, isn't it?
[51:57] &gt;&gt; Right. Yeah.
[51:58] &gt;&gt; And and I know the next question maybe
[52:01] that at least the question that I had
[52:03] and you forgive me for kind of taking
[52:05] this a little bit easy tonight, but it's
[52:07] a it's a good night I think to kind of
[52:09] dig into these things. You say, "Well,
[52:11] why don't you just read the Bible?"
[52:15] &gt;&gt; Right.
[52:16] &gt;&gt; Because you realize that there's some
[52:18] humanity in what I'm going to say, but
[52:21] if I just stood up here and read the
[52:22] scripture, there wouldn't be any.
[52:24] &gt;&gt; Right. It would be the it would be the
[52:26] literal word of God that would be being
[52:29] read to you and and and that would be
[52:32] good. It would be nothing wrong with
[52:34] standing up here and reading the Bible,
[52:36] but it's not what we are called to do in
[52:38] church or as preachers,
[52:40] &gt;&gt; though it's a part of what we do. In
[52:42] fact, it's a big part of what we do. I
[52:44] think we ought to use the scriptures and
[52:46] preach the scriptures and preach from
[52:47] the scripture.
[52:49] &gt;&gt; But every word in the Bible is inspired.
[52:52] How many believe that? Yes,
[52:54] &gt;&gt; every word. But the Bible is is a word
[52:58] is the word. But what preaching is is
[53:02] the word in due season.
[53:05] &gt;&gt; Right?
[53:06] &gt;&gt; So the Bible says a word fitly spoken.
[53:09] It's like apples of gold and pictures of
[53:11] silver. That that term fitly is timely.
[53:15] &gt;&gt; Right? So there's a time for it.
[53:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[53:18] &gt;&gt; You know that's true. even among your
[53:20] friends or your family, there's a time
[53:22] to say certain things,
[53:25] &gt;&gt; right? And a time to not say certain
[53:27] things,
[53:28] &gt;&gt; right? A word spoken at the right time
[53:32] is like apples of gold and pictures of
[53:34] silver. So all of the all of the
[53:37] scripture is inspired,
[53:38] &gt;&gt; but it's not all timely.
[53:41] &gt;&gt; And we aren't good judges of what we
[53:43] need.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; Right. We're human beings. Yeah.
[53:48] [snorts]
[53:48] &gt;&gt; So God puts gifts in the church
[53:51] &gt;&gt; to speak to us, to take the word and and
[53:54] pulls something out of it that's timely.
[53:57] &gt;&gt; That's what we need. And you might say,
[53:58] "Well, you know, we talked about that on
[54:00] the way to church or or maybe it's
[54:02] something you've been dealing with in
[54:03] your life, something that you've been
[54:04] struggling with understanding, and God
[54:06] just brings it out." And and you say,
[54:08] "What did that?" It wasn't because of
[54:10] some great preacher, but it's because
[54:12] you come in an atmosphere of faith and
[54:14] God brought a word in due season to you,
[54:17] &gt;&gt; right? So, it's the right word at the
[54:20] right time.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; So, the Paul told Timothy in 2 Timothy
[54:25] 2:15, if you want to go there and then
[54:28] we'll get second Peter chapter 1.
[54:31] 2 Timothy 2:15 says, "Study to show
[54:33] thyself approved unto God, workmen that
[54:36] needeth not to be ashamed, rightly
[54:39] dividing the word of truth." Rightly
[54:42] dividing the word of truth. Spurgeon
[54:46] said that that rightly dividing he said
[54:49] was like the priest. It was an illusion
[54:50] to the priest would actually take a
[54:53] sword and make straight cuts in the
[54:55] sacrifice because each portion was going
[54:58] to a different part of the Levites and
[55:01] they actually ate the sacrifices. You
[55:03] realize that the Levites ate of the
[55:05] temple and and they ate the sacrifice
[55:08] and they had a right to do that but he
[55:10] had to aortion it to each one and that's
[55:13] what he's saying. So it's rightly
[55:15] dividing the word of truth. Second Peter
[55:17] chapter 1 and verse 12, Peter says,
[55:19] "Wherefore I will not be negligent to
[55:21] put you always in remembrance of these
[55:23] things though you know them and be
[55:25] established in what? The present truth."
[55:28] Someone say that with me. Present truth.
[55:31] &gt;&gt; So there's there's a truth and then
[55:34] there's a present truth.
[55:37] &gt;&gt; There's a word and a word rightly
[55:39] divided,
[55:41] &gt;&gt; right? There there's food and then
[55:44] there's food that you need to help you
[55:46] right now at this moment in your
[55:49] journey. Are you with me so far?
[55:52] &gt;&gt; So, brother Brandham talks about that
[55:53] when he preaches Satan's Eden. He said,
[55:55] I wanted to speak to you something to
[55:58] bring something to enlighten you to the
[56:00] promise of God for this age. He said,
[56:03] "But I thought I would try to bring
[56:05] something to your mind with these
[56:07] scriptures I got written that would
[56:08] enlighten you to know that make you a
[56:10] better soldier in the field." How many
[56:12] want to be a better soldier? You fight
[56:13] the devil every day. You fight him at
[56:15] work. You fight him sometimes fight him
[56:17] even in our own families and even in
[56:19] [laughter] our own our own communities.
[56:22] We fight him all the time. The devil's
[56:23] always out to get you. So if you're
[56:25] going to be a a soldier, he said, "I
[56:28] wanted to give you something would make
[56:29] you a better soldier in this day." So he
[56:32] preached something to us that the a we
[56:34] wouldn't have heard in a Baptist church.
[56:36] &gt;&gt; We wouldn't have heard in a Methodist
[56:37] church or a Pentecostal church. We heard
[56:39] Satan's Eden from a prophet because it
[56:41] was a word that was spoken in the right
[56:43] time
[56:44] &gt;&gt; in the right place to the right people
[56:46] that we could receive it and take it
[56:48] home with us.
[56:50] &gt;&gt; So
[56:52] he said, "I I want to make you a better
[56:53] soldier in the field that you're
[56:55] fighting in now."
[56:57] Right? So you're fighting a certain
[56:58] battle. He said, 'Well, I love the word.
[57:01] I can read the word for myself. I can do
[57:03] all that for myself, but he said, 'I
[57:05] want to make you a better soldier in the
[57:06] field you're fighting in now. And God
[57:09] has a way of giving us what we need.
[57:10] Aren't you glad for that? So, he said,
[57:14] "So you can learn the tactics of the
[57:15] enemy so that you can block everything
[57:17] before it gets to you."
[57:19] So the Bible means just what it says,
[57:23] &gt;&gt; right? That's what it means. So what
[57:24] does the Bible mean? Well, it means just
[57:26] what it says.
[57:28] But it's got to be rightly divided,
[57:30] &gt;&gt; right?
[57:31] &gt;&gt; Right. Portioned into its proper place.
[57:35] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham says this. He said,
[57:37] 'You must not misinterpret the word.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I believe it means
[57:42] this." He said, "It means just what it
[57:44] says. It means no interpreter." He said,
[57:47] "And you must not misplace the word."
[57:50] Right? So, that's the things if you're
[57:51] writing it down. Some of you uh kids
[57:53] that are taking notes. Some of you adult
[57:55] you adults may be taking notes. It's
[57:58] don't [snorts] he said don't
[57:59] misinterpret the word. He said you must
[58:01] not misplace the word and you must not
[58:05] dislocate the word. He said if we would
[58:08] do either of these it throws the whole
[58:09] Bible in confusion and chaos.
[58:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; Right. And how many you know we've been
[58:16] around a while. How many cults have we
[58:17] seen raise up around the message
[58:20] &gt;&gt; because some man misinterpreted,
[58:22] misplaced or dislocated the word? God
[58:25] help us uh to not do that. And and that
[58:29] was uh what happened, you know, uh
[58:32] that's what happened with Ahab and and
[58:34] Micaiah. You remember the story. Ahab is
[58:36] going down to Ramoth Gilead to take
[58:38] over. It was written in the word that
[58:41] Ramoth Gilead was their property,
[58:44] right? That was their property. It
[58:46] belonged to them.
[58:48] &gt;&gt; And and the prophets of that day thought
[58:52] it would be advantageous to preach what
[58:54] the king wanted to hear, right? So they
[58:56] come out and said, "You can you're going
[58:58] to take it." And they had word to back
[59:00] it up. They preached from the scriptures
[59:04] that they were supposed to go take it.
[59:06] But they went down and found Micaiah.
[59:08] And Micaiah said, "I see all Israel
[59:10] scattered like a sheep without a
[59:12] shepherd." Right.
[59:13] &gt;&gt; Right. and and Ahab said you well you
[59:15] always prophesy bad to me. Every time I
[59:18] come to church I get rebuked. You know
[59:21] &gt;&gt; I I always disagree with what you're
[59:23] saying. Well, he didn't have an
[59:24] atmosphere of faith to receive it in.
[59:25] &gt;&gt; Right.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; Right. But but now what's happening with
[59:29] Ahab and Micaiah is Micaiah is not not
[59:33] just looking at the word but he's a
[59:35] prophet. So he's taking the word and
[59:38] making it present tense. Right? That's
[59:40] what a prophet does. He's the divine
[59:42] interpreter
[59:44] of the word.
[59:45] &gt;&gt; So, brother Brandham deals with Ahab and
[59:47] Micaiah. And he said a prophet means not
[59:50] only to speak the word but to foretell.
[59:53] &gt;&gt; He said a divine interpreter of the
[59:55] word. The divine word written the word
[59:57] come to the prophet. He said and when
[59:59] the prophet came on the scene then and
[1:00:01] could foretell things and it happened
[1:00:03] exactly like that. God said remember he
[1:00:05] said I'm with him. He said then when he
[1:00:07] revealed the word what the other prophet
[1:00:09] had said before him come to pass he said
[1:00:13] then they knew that was true.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; Oh my. So he was able to go back and see
[1:00:19] what Elijah said and Micaiah took what
[1:00:22] Elijah said he but but he put it in its
[1:00:25] right season and he recognized that Ahab
[1:00:28] was the one who was going to die.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; Right? What was it that brother Brandham
[1:00:31] did for us as believers? The Bible's
[1:00:34] still the Bible. He didn't change the
[1:00:36] Bible, but what did he do? He made it
[1:00:38] current. He He showed us who the
[1:00:40] Antichrist was and what that system was.
[1:00:42] He showed us who the believer would be
[1:00:44] and who the bride would be. And he he he
[1:00:47] portioned it all out in such a way that
[1:00:50] we could understand it. So,
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; are you with me so far?
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; So,
[1:00:57] Micaiah applied the word of Elijah to
[1:01:00] the present situation.
[1:01:02] Brother Brandham didn't change what Paul
[1:01:04] preached. Somebody know that
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; he said, "I preached what Paul
[1:01:07] preached."
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; But he took what Paul preached and
[1:01:10] brought it current.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; You let me give you an example. Paul
[1:01:14] said there would be a shout, a voice,
[1:01:16] and a trumpet. Right? The Lord himself
[1:01:18] shall descend with a shout. Right?
[1:01:20] That's the word. That's the truth.
[1:01:22] That's the That's the written word. It's
[1:01:24] the Bible. It's absolutely true. But a
[1:01:27] prophet of God stood up there and said,
[1:01:29] he said the shout was a message.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; Now, what's a prophet doing? He's
[1:01:33] looking. Brother Peter, what's going on
[1:01:34] right now?
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; Right. He's looking at what was
[1:01:37] happening in his own ministry.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; And realizing that God was fulfilling
[1:01:42] his word right then.
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; Oh my. So he stood there and said and
[1:01:47] said, "This day this scripture is
[1:01:49] fulfilled." Right?
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; He stood there and said and said the
[1:01:52] shout is is a message.
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; And that Paul didn't say that, but he's
[1:01:57] still preaching what Paul preached. He's
[1:01:59] just bringing it down to present tense,
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; So, he divided it to the current age.
[1:02:06] That was brother Brandham's job. Nobody
[1:02:08] else gets that job.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; Nobody else has that authority.
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; Right. That's brother Brandham's job.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad for a prophet?
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; Right. No one else has that authority to
[1:02:19] divide the word in that way and show us
[1:02:21] what age in the overarching view. God
[1:02:23] didn't call me to the whole age.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; Right. I have a message to the age and
[1:02:27] then I take that a and I preach that as
[1:02:31] faithfully as I can to my current
[1:02:34] congregation,
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; right, with their current needs.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; And God inspires that to a particular
[1:02:41] congregation, a particular person in a
[1:02:44] particular situation. And a person if
[1:02:46] they receive that in faith can say, "I'm
[1:02:48] healed. I've been saved. I've been
[1:02:50] delivered by the word of God." What was
[1:02:52] it? It wasn't me. It wasn't even brother
[1:02:53] Brandon. But it was the word of God
[1:02:55] working the way it's supposed to work.
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; Faith comes by hearing and hearing by
[1:02:59] the word of God.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; So
[1:03:06] again, as we said, you you know, if the
[1:03:08] Bible's all inspired, why don't we just
[1:03:11] read the Bible? Well, if the message is
[1:03:12] all inspired, why not just play the
[1:03:14] tapes? And I've got absolutely nothing
[1:03:16] against playing the tapes, right? I feel
[1:03:20] like Paul Paul said, "I speak in tongues
[1:03:22] more than you all." And uh I feel like I
[1:03:26] listen to tapes more than you all. Maybe
[1:03:28] Peter does. I'm not sure. Uh Peter plays
[1:03:31] tapes all night and I hear them coming
[1:03:33] through my vent, but uh that's his uh
[1:03:37] his the good part of Peter, you know,
[1:03:39] right there. He's done that for years.
[1:03:42] So I've heard a lot of tapes thanks to
[1:03:44] Peter. But I' I've listened to the tapes
[1:03:46] all my life and I still do. I do it all
[1:03:50] the time and and I believe in playing
[1:03:53] tapes. But why don't we just play the
[1:03:55] tapes in church? Well, let me ask you
[1:03:57] this question. Why did Peter not just
[1:03:59] read what the prophet Joel said
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; when he come out on the day of
[1:04:03] Pentecost?
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; Now, he did read it. He quoted Joel,
[1:04:07] right? Look at Acts 2:14.
[1:04:11] Peter standing up with the 11 lifted up
[1:04:12] his voice and said unto them, you men of
[1:04:14] Judea and all you that dwell at
[1:04:15] Jerusalem, be this known unto you and
[1:04:17] hearken. Now this is astounding
[1:04:19] statement. Hearken to my words.
[1:04:22] Now why would Peter say that? He said
[1:04:24] hear me,
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; right? Because what's he what's he going
[1:04:28] to say? He said, "These are not drunken
[1:04:29] as you suppose, seeing it's but the
[1:04:31] third hour of the day. But this is that
[1:04:35] this is that which was spoken by the
[1:04:37] prophet Joel." And what was He was
[1:04:40] making the word of God applied to the
[1:04:43] situation that was there. He didn't
[1:04:45] misquote Joel. He didn't make it
[1:04:46] something that wasn't right. But what
[1:04:48] did he do? He applied it to the present
[1:04:51] situation. And we know that God
[1:04:53] interprets his word by bringing it to
[1:04:55] pass. That's what he was doing. God was
[1:04:57] bringing Joel to pass literally right
[1:04:59] there among them.
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; Right? I will restore. Say all the
[1:05:02] things that Joel said. This is that
[1:05:04] outpouring of the spirit that Joel
[1:05:06] prophesied. Your sons and your daughters
[1:05:08] shall prophesy. The things that Joel
[1:05:10] prophesied were being manifested right
[1:05:13] there.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; And Peter says, "Hear me."
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; This is that.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; See, someone has to stand in the hour of
[1:05:21] fulfillment
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; and declare that this is that.
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; So God called a prophet to the age and
[1:05:31] he caused men with gifts not to
[1:05:34] supersede a prophet. They should never
[1:05:36] do that.
[1:05:37] Not to say something a prophet didn't
[1:05:38] say. They we should never do that.
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; But he caused gifted men to rightly
[1:05:44] divide the word to a specific
[1:05:47] congregation,
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; right? I give you an example. There's
[1:05:51] there's I could preach on just about
[1:05:53] anything, right? Because the message is
[1:05:57] full of stuff,
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; right? We've got a lot of material.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; So, I could preach anywhere from A to Z.
[1:06:03] We could preach faith. We could preach
[1:06:06] uh we could preach judgment. We could
[1:06:07] preach about the great white throne. We
[1:06:10] could preach about right. You could just
[1:06:12] pick a topic. And if I if I took my what
[1:06:15] I'm preaching on from a poll of the
[1:06:17] congregation,
[1:06:19] right, from something what the
[1:06:21] congregation's like, well, you know, uh
[1:06:23] we'll just decide what brother Ben's
[1:06:24] going to preach and and we'll tell him
[1:06:26] on Sunday morning. If we did that, you
[1:06:28] all couldn't agree on it
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; because you got different needs.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; Right. So the young people would say,
[1:06:35] "Speak to the young people. Preach to
[1:06:37] the young people." And the elders would
[1:06:39] say, "Preach something we can some meat
[1:06:41] that we can grab a hold of." Right? And
[1:06:44] the and some of the other folks, the
[1:06:46] married couples say, "Preach about
[1:06:48] marriage, you know, and preach at my
[1:06:49] husband." You know, [laughter]
[1:06:51] preach my wife,
[1:06:54] right? So we we've got things that we
[1:06:56] think somebody needs and and we would
[1:06:59] say that. We would want somebody to
[1:07:00] preach on that. And yet what happens is
[1:07:03] what we really need is what we actually
[1:07:06] get.
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; And we don't realize it sometimes.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; What we really need. Oh, come on. You
[1:07:13] say, "Well, I'm not getting preached to
[1:07:15] like I need to be preached to." Do you
[1:07:17] not believe God is sovereign?
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; You not believe he controls all things?
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; Listen, he can take a a donkey,
[1:07:24] [laughter]
[1:07:24] as some have said, and speak through a
[1:07:26] donkey and give a word that would be
[1:07:28] fitly spoken in due season.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; Right? If he could do that for a donkey,
[1:07:33] if a donkey could correct Balum, then
[1:07:35] how much more could God correct me
[1:07:37] through a preacher? How much more could
[1:07:39] he correct me through the word, through
[1:07:41] the church, whatever that is? Are you
[1:07:43] with me now?
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; Someone has to say this is that this is
[1:07:48] what we're talking about. So our job is
[1:07:51] to be inspired, not to just come and and
[1:07:53] preach something, but it's an
[1:07:55] inspiration. I don't preach by by
[1:07:58] knowledge. I don't preach by just coming
[1:08:00] out and say, "Well, this is what the
[1:08:01] church needs." I preach by inspiration.
[1:08:03] I'll be on vacation or somewhere. I I've
[1:08:06] got a notes app on my phone. I just jot
[1:08:08] something down. I've got hundreds of
[1:08:09] notes in there. And God inspires that to
[1:08:11] me. And then I come and preach that. And
[1:08:14] sometimes it takes a service, sometimes
[1:08:15] it takes 10, sometimes it takes 20, but
[1:08:18] it's because of inspiration. And even
[1:08:21] during that, God can even move a
[1:08:23] preacher off his notes to preach
[1:08:25] directly to the situation that you're
[1:08:27] dealing with right now.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; And it's hard for us sometimes
[1:08:36] because sometimes we don't even know
[1:08:37] what we need and what we're hearing is
[1:08:40] exactly what we need,
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; But it's just not what we want to hear.
[1:08:50] Now, God called again a prophet to the
[1:08:53] age, but he's called men with
[1:08:54] predestined gifts to rightly divide the
[1:08:55] word to a specific congregation.
[1:08:58] Ephesians 4:11. Go ahead and turn there
[1:08:59] with me if you got your Bibles
[1:09:04] and then we'll be going to Luke 12.
[1:09:07] Ephesians 4:11. He gave some apostles
[1:09:09] and some prophets and some evangelists
[1:09:11] and some pastors and teachers. It
[1:09:14] doesn't mean he gave some people
[1:09:15] apostles and some people prophets and
[1:09:17] some people evangelists. No, he gave
[1:09:19] some of the gifted men. Some of the
[1:09:22] gifts were apostles. Some of them were
[1:09:24] prophets. Some of them were evangelists.
[1:09:26] And some pastors and teachers for the
[1:09:28] perfecting of the saints. Word
[1:09:30] perfecting is not sinless perfection.
[1:09:32] Brother Brandon said the blood of Jesus
[1:09:34] Christ does that. But the perfecting of
[1:09:36] the saints is the maturing of the body
[1:09:39] to make the body grow. for the work of
[1:09:41] the ministry, for the edifying of the
[1:09:43] body of Christ. Verse 13, till we all
[1:09:47] come in the unity of the faith, of the
[1:09:50] knowledge of the son of God, unto a
[1:09:51] perfect man, unto the measure of the
[1:09:53] stature of the fullness of Christ. In
[1:09:55] other words, till we're all grown up.
[1:09:57] You say, "Brother Ben, when will that
[1:09:58] be?" When we're when our bodies change
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; at the fullness of adoption. That's what
[1:10:03] we've been preaching at, right? What
[1:10:04] we've been preaching on. So there come
[1:10:06] there's coming a time when we reach that
[1:10:08] point of the fullness of adoption, the
[1:10:11] measure of the stature of the fullness
[1:10:13] of Christ. Now we these ministry gifts
[1:10:17] are stewards of the word. So they're not
[1:10:20] they don't give they shouldn't give of
[1:10:22] themselves, but they should give of what
[1:10:26] they've been given. Does that make
[1:10:28] sense? So a minister is gifted with an
[1:10:30] ability maybe to study and to read or do
[1:10:34] something like that. They're not to give
[1:10:35] just of their own experience or what
[1:10:37] they are, but they're to give of what
[1:10:40] they've been given.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; So, a steward does not own anything.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; Right? Preachers don't own you.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; Right. A pastor doesn't own you.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; Right. Come on, church. A pastor is not
[1:10:52] literally your husband. I know that's
[1:10:53] been taught, but that's not the case.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; Preachers don't own you. Uh, nobody
[1:10:59] does. God does. Amen. We're his sheep,
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; right? But we are stewards of the word,
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; right? We've been given the word
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; to give to the people,
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; are you with me now? And we're
[1:11:12] responsible to that
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; to give each particular audience me in
[1:11:17] due season.
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; Right? Something that you can go with on
[1:11:21] Wednesday night, as brother Brandon said
[1:11:22] about Satan's eating. He said, "I want
[1:11:23] to give you something that you can fight
[1:11:25] the devil with." Right? And
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; so I want to give you something tonight
[1:11:28] that you can take home and fight the
[1:11:30] devil because the devil's going to be
[1:11:31] fighting you.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; So Luke 12 and verse 41,
[1:11:37] this is where Peter asked that question.
[1:11:39] I got a little ahead of myself earlier,
[1:11:41] but Peter asked Jesus the question,
[1:11:44] Lord, speak thou this parable unto us or
[1:11:47] even to all. He said, who are you
[1:11:48] talking about?
[1:11:51] Right? It just didn't make a whole lot
[1:11:52] of sense to him.
[1:11:54] And the Lord said, "Who then?"
[1:11:57] Now, he said, "This is who I'm speaking
[1:11:59] to." He says, "The one who's going to be
[1:12:01] a steward, right? Who then is that
[1:12:03] faithful and wise steward whom his Lord
[1:12:06] shall make ruler over his household to
[1:12:09] give them their portion of meat in due
[1:12:10] season? Blessed is that servant whom his
[1:12:14] Lord when he cometh shall find so
[1:12:18] doing." So, if he's given me the ability
[1:12:21] to read the word and to look into the
[1:12:23] word and to study the word to give it to
[1:12:25] you, he said, "I'll be blessed if when
[1:12:27] he comes, I'm still doing that."
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; Right. And and he said, "Of a truth I
[1:12:34] say to you, he'll make him ruler over
[1:12:35] all that he hath." He said, "But if that
[1:12:38] servant say in his heart, my lord
[1:12:40] delayeth his coming,"
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; right, and shall begin to beat the men's
[1:12:45] servants and maidens, we've seen this,
[1:12:47] too.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; Right. So if that servant who's been
[1:12:50] given made a steward over over the
[1:12:52] things of God, if he if he begins to
[1:12:55] mistreat the church,
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; are you with me now?
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; Then my Lord delays his coming. So it
[1:13:02] doesn't matter the way I treat the
[1:13:04] church. It doesn't matter how I preach.
[1:13:05] It doesn't matter what I say. Doesn't
[1:13:07] matter how I treat people. Watch what
[1:13:09] happens. He said, "And to eat and drink
[1:13:11] and be drunk. And the lord of that
[1:13:12] servant will come in a day when he
[1:13:13] lookth not for him and an hour when he's
[1:13:15] not aware will cut him in sunder and
[1:13:18] will appoint him his portion with the
[1:13:20] unbelievers.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; This is why Paul said he said he said I
[1:13:25] I keep under my body. You remember the
[1:13:27] scripture,
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; bring it under subjection, lest having
[1:13:30] preached to others,
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; I myself would be a cast away,
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; right? And what he means by that is not
[1:13:36] that he could not be in the economy of
[1:13:39] God, but he would be disapproved by God.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; Right? His portion would be with the
[1:13:44] unbelievers.
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; I don't want that to be my reward.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; And so I do my best not to beat the
[1:13:50] sheep. Right.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; Right. And that's as steward is to do
[1:13:53] that. So, when we're hearing the word of
[1:13:54] God, we've got to we need to hear from a
[1:13:57] faithful steward that is willing to just
[1:14:00] feed the sheep,
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; right? Feed the sheep on Wednesday,
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; feed the sheep on Sunday,
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; feed the sheep on Sunday night if we
[1:14:08] have church. Are you with me now?
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; Somebody who's willing to feed the
[1:14:11] sheep, not beat the sheep.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; So, the this kind of of a steward must
[1:14:18] be faithful.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; Faithful. 1 Corinthians 4:1, let a man
[1:14:21] sow account of us. So this is how people
[1:14:23] should view us
[1:14:25] as of the ministers of Christ, stewards
[1:14:28] of the mysteries of God.
[1:14:31] A steward is maybe in the old English
[1:14:34] household it'd be a butler be somebody
[1:14:37] who's in charge of the household.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; Right? He he he takes care of the
[1:14:41] servants. He takes care of all that goes
[1:14:43] on in the household so the master can
[1:14:45] leave him in charge and go away and it's
[1:14:49] not a mess when he gets back. But he
[1:14:51] don't answer to himself. He answers to
[1:14:54] the master.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; Right. So he said it's required in
[1:14:58] stewards that a man be found faithful.
[1:15:02] So and in that sense all of us are
[1:15:04] stewards of whatever we've been given.
[1:15:07] So you've been given the mysteries of
[1:15:09] God, some revelation of the mystery of
[1:15:11] God. Whatever that revelation is, it
[1:15:13] might be small, it might be large, but
[1:15:16] you're a steward of that.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; You're responsible for that. And brother
[1:15:21] Brandon said, "Now, while we're here
[1:15:22] together and all of us longing the same
[1:15:25] thing,
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; make us true stewards." Somebody could
[1:15:28] say amen to that tonight. Make us true
[1:15:30] stewards. I whatever revelation I've
[1:15:32] been given, I want to be a true steward
[1:15:35] of the mysteries of God.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; May we shape our lives by self-control.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; Now look at this. That's the same thing
[1:15:43] Paul's saying. He said, "I keep under my
[1:15:45] body. I'm going to bring myself under
[1:15:47] self-control. I'm not going to give in
[1:15:49] to the excesses of the flesh or give in
[1:15:51] to being a a fighter or or a debater.
[1:15:55] I'm not going to do that because I want
[1:15:57] to be a good steward. I'm responsible
[1:15:59] for the people that I preach to.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; So he said he said while we're here
[1:16:04] together all of us along the same thing.
[1:16:06] May we shape our lives by self-control
[1:16:08] that we'll know by the help of the Holy
[1:16:10] Spirit to have a full confidence that
[1:16:13] Jesus will say, "Well done, my good and
[1:16:16] faithful servant at that day." Isn't
[1:16:18] that the kind of confidence that we
[1:16:20] want? Like Paul said, he said, "I fought
[1:16:22] a good fight.
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; I finished my course.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; There's a crown waiting for me."
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; He said, "May we be upright, honest, and
[1:16:30] true.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; May we be the kind of Christian, oh,
[1:16:33] grant this to me, Lord. I don't want
[1:16:36] this just to be other people. I think
[1:16:37] preachers ought to ought to pray this as
[1:16:39] well. May we be the kind of Christian
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; that would be a credit to any community.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; May we be men and women such as you
[1:16:49] could lay your hands on and say, "My
[1:16:51] servant."
[1:16:52] So it's not just the men, not just the
[1:16:54] preachers, but men and women that he
[1:16:58] could lay his hands on and say, "My
[1:16:59] servant, behold, this is my servant in
[1:17:02] whom I'm delighted. I can send them.
[1:17:04] they'll go. They know how to speak and
[1:17:06] when to speak,
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; which is just as important as how to
[1:17:09] speak,
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; right? And I can be with them.
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham was praying for
[1:17:20] preachers one time. He mentioned several
[1:17:23] specific preachers and he says this,
[1:17:24] "God bless them men and anoint them with
[1:17:27] the Holy Ghost. Grant it, Lord. May they
[1:17:30] be good stewards having great success of
[1:17:33] calling the people out of darkness
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; into the marvelous light. Now what are
[1:17:38] stewards to be faithful in? To preach
[1:17:40] the word,
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; right? To preach the word. Second
[1:17:44] Timothy 4:2, preach the word.
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; Be instant in season, out of season.
[1:17:49] Rebuke, reprove, rebuke, exhort with all
[1:17:52] longsuffering
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; and doctrine.
[1:17:56] Right? If all that we do and I I read a
[1:17:58] lot, I know that I read a lot of quotes.
[1:17:59] I read a lot of scriptures because I
[1:18:01] want to be faithful.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; And not everybody does it like I do it.
[1:18:05] Brother Joel does it differently.
[1:18:06] Brother Stewart does it differently. But
[1:18:07] I want to be faithful,
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; right? And whatever God's given me and
[1:18:11] the ability that God's given me, if
[1:18:12] there is any, I want to be faithful to
[1:18:14] that.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; And and so if I'm faithful to that, I
[1:18:17] believe God will bless it. But he told
[1:18:19] me preach the word,
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; right? Just like he told you to go to
[1:18:23] church. Just like he told me to go to
[1:18:25] church. Just like he told us, "Ladies,
[1:18:27] don't cut your hair. Men act like men.
[1:18:29] Women act like women." Those are
[1:18:31] instructions from God.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; Right. He instructed us to do that. He
[1:18:34] told me as a preacher, preach the word,
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; right? Be instant in season, out of
[1:18:39] season, reprove, rebuke, exhort with all
[1:18:42] longsuffering
[1:18:44] and doctrine.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; Listen, he said it. The Bram said it's
[1:18:47] becoming to us as ministers today. So
[1:18:51] now we see the word, what what the Bible
[1:18:53] says about it. Now, we're going to see
[1:18:54] what a prophet said about it. It's
[1:18:56] becoming to us as ministers today to see
[1:18:59] that this word is preached, to see that
[1:19:02] it's done. And I believe that's not just
[1:19:04] preaching the Bible, but it's preaching
[1:19:06] the present truth of the Bible.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; Right? The revelation of the message of
[1:19:10] the hour. So, he said, "It's becoming to
[1:19:12] us to see that it's done. It's becoming
[1:19:14] to us a man of these hour that we're
[1:19:16] living in. We're not men of another
[1:19:18] hour. We're a man of this hour,
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; right? We're people of this hour. We got
[1:19:22] specific challenges for our church and
[1:19:25] our congregation and and our people that
[1:19:27] we're living around your family and my
[1:19:29] family. Specific challenge. Aren't you
[1:19:31] glad that God foresaw that before the
[1:19:33] foundation of the world and he gifted
[1:19:35] men in our age to speak directly to us?
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; That's right. Right.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:19:41] That's why you get to the point where
[1:19:43] you think, my goodness, I might not have
[1:19:46] made it in any other place, but I found
[1:19:49] See, God ordained that.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right? Someone that could speak to
[1:19:53] your specific situation, but maybe there
[1:19:55] are others that he couldn't speak to,
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; And that's okay,
[1:20:01] right? You can't preach to everybody,
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; But the Brandon was called to the age we
[1:20:05] were not as ministers. We're called to
[1:20:07] specific groups of people,
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; right? So, an evangelist would be called
[1:20:13] to the people that he preaches to. But
[1:20:15] you don't have to preach to everybody.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; Right. A missionary would be called to
[1:20:19] the whole world, but in a different way
[1:20:21] to call to bring them in,
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; right? An apostle to bring them in, to
[1:20:25] establish them
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; in present truth. A a prophet would be
[1:20:29] called to to reveal the word of God. A
[1:20:32] pastor's called to take care of the
[1:20:34] sheep
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; by feeding them the word.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Now,
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; it's a different gift, but we're we're
[1:20:41] preaching to specific audiences in
[1:20:44] particular places.
[1:20:48] Good.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, we ought to thank God
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; for the word that we've been given.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; And what I'm saying is that then we
[1:20:54] should receive that in an atmosphere of
[1:20:56] faith,
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; Say, Lord, I believe that this is a man
[1:20:59] of God preaching the word of God. And
[1:21:01] now, Lord, help me to receive it and
[1:21:03] help me to go. Now, that don't mean you
[1:21:05] don't check it out, but it means you
[1:21:06] receive it as the atmosphere of faith.
[1:21:09] And then you check it out to make sure
[1:21:10] that it is the word of God.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; And then if it is the word of God,
[1:21:14] you're responsible to it. right
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; to go and live it.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; So, brother Brandon says, "Becoming to
[1:21:22] us, man of these hour that we're living
[1:21:24] in," he said, "great men in the earth
[1:21:25] today." Oh, God, they're out there. Let
[1:21:27] them see it and grab the sword. No
[1:21:30] matter what the opposition, if God be
[1:21:33] for you, who can be against you? We
[1:21:36] don't care jeopardizing our social
[1:21:37] living. We don't care jeopardizing this,
[1:21:40] that, or the other. We want to get the
[1:21:41] water of life back. He was talking about
[1:21:43] David's mighty men that went down to the
[1:21:45] well of Bethlehem to get a drink for
[1:21:47] David. And he said he still longs for a
[1:21:49] drink of Pentecostal water.
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; The same water they had at the
[1:21:53] beginning.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; So what's he saying? It's time. It's
[1:21:57] time to preach.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; This is the time. If there ever was a
[1:22:01] time to preach, sir,
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; this is the time to preach. Why, brother
[1:22:05] Ben? Because this is the hour when the
[1:22:07] most when Satan's preaching. He hasn't
[1:22:10] called his ministry off the field.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; That his ministry of television, his
[1:22:15] ministry of of Hollywood, his ministry
[1:22:17] of evil spirits all over the place. He's
[1:22:20] got messengers everywhere that let us go
[1:22:22] forth as ministers of the gospel.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; He said, "Let us ministers be a flame of
[1:22:27] fire."
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; Preach the gospel.
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; This is the time to preach.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? I'm not just saying
[1:22:34] that. Brother Brandham, Brother Brandham
[1:22:36] said that. And he said, "Now in this New
[1:22:39] Testament age,
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; remember his job is to make it present
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; to show us this is that."
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; Right. In this New Testament age, the
[1:22:48] blood of Jesus Christ cleanses his
[1:22:50] church and sanctifies it that his Holy
[1:22:53] Spirit might continue to carry the work
[1:22:55] of God on through all ages.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; And he's just the same today.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; He said, "If it isn't, then we're false
[1:23:03] witnesses of this Bible." Yes, sir.
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; He said, "If that isn't true, then the
[1:23:07] Bible isn't true.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; It's time."
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; Look, what time is it?
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon, preach that sermon,
[1:23:14] sir. What time is it?
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon said, "It's time that
[1:23:18] men preach the gospel, sir."
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; He said, "Well, that's a different time
[1:23:25] now. If you can show me where Brother
[1:23:27] Brandham said that,
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; then I'll believe it."
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:23:31] See, but he said, he did say, "It's time
[1:23:33] that men preach the gospel."
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; It's time that the power of God was made
[1:23:38] known. How many believe that today when
[1:23:40] he that is trying to step on the word,
[1:23:42] don't you see what they're doing? They
[1:23:44] they they brought up just in the last 10
[1:23:45] or 15 years. Look how far Come on,
[1:23:48] church. You You if you ever needed to go
[1:23:50] to church, now's the time to go to
[1:23:52] church. If you ever needed to hear a
[1:23:54] preacher, now's the time to hear a
[1:23:56] preacher.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; Satan's after your kids. Satan's after
[1:23:59] your wife. Satan's after your husband.
[1:24:01] He's He's going coming as hard as he can
[1:24:03] come
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; against the people of God.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; I hope we can see that tonight. We We
[1:24:09] see anxiety and depression and suicide
[1:24:12] and and perverted sexual sins and all
[1:24:15] these different things coming in. Now's
[1:24:17] not the time to quit church.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; I know I'm preaching to the choir on a
[1:24:22] Wednesday night, but now's not the time
[1:24:24] to quit church. Now's the time to get in
[1:24:26] church. He said, "It's time for men to
[1:24:28] preach the gospel."
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; When he trying to step on the word, we
[1:24:33] need men like the Hebrew children. Our
[1:24:35] God is able to deliver us from this.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; He said, "That's right. It's time, sir.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; God remains the same."
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Preached that in a sermon
[1:24:44] called the unchangeable God.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:49] What did Paul say? How will they hear
[1:24:52] without a preacher?
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; It's God's provided way. Brother Brandon
[1:24:56] said, "He uses not the agency of any
[1:24:57] mechanical device, but the agency of
[1:25:00] man, a man that's surrendered
[1:25:02] and consecrated to God."
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; Now, how should we hear that word which
[1:25:09] is preached? If it's time to preach,
[1:25:11] it's time to hear.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; We should receive in an atmosphere of
[1:25:16] faith
[1:25:18] drawing through the filter of the Bible,
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; the word, right?
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; So, we want to know the word. We want to
[1:25:24] read the word
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; because brother Brandham was a word
[1:25:27] prophet.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; So what brother Brandham preached come
[1:25:30] out of the word.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; Right. So we want to know the Bible
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; so we'll know the message.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; Right. Remember when brother Brandham
[1:25:38] talked about he would talk about Moses
[1:25:40] or rather he would talk about Joseph and
[1:25:41] Mary. You remember you talk about how
[1:25:43] that they were sitting there reading the
[1:25:45] scripture right that that day
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; and it was reading Isaiah where it says
[1:25:50] a virgin shall conceive.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:25:53] And they begin to talk about it. He
[1:25:54] said, "When you talk about it, he comes
[1:25:56] around."
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; And that day, the angel met her
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; and said, "You're the one. Blessed art
[1:26:01] thou Mary, highly favored among women."
[1:26:03] And she said, "Be it unto me according
[1:26:04] to thy word." Why could she have that
[1:26:06] kind of atmosphere of faith to receive
[1:26:07] it? Because she'd been reading it.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon even talked about the
[1:26:13] disciples. He said when they were
[1:26:14] little, their daddies got them around,
[1:26:16] read them the word of God, read them the
[1:26:17] scrolls, and showed them where there was
[1:26:19] a Messiah coming. Somebody read the
[1:26:21] woman at the well. Don't think you're
[1:26:23] Listen, if you're reading your kids the
[1:26:25] scripture, you keep on doing that
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; because somebody read the the woman at
[1:26:29] the well that there would be a Messiah
[1:26:31] coming. She knew it.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; Somehow she had heard
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; and when she saw the manifestation of
[1:26:37] God, he said, he said, "I am he that
[1:26:40] speaketh to thee." She immediately ran
[1:26:42] into the city,
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; said, "Come see a man."
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; Her life completely changed. Why?
[1:26:47] Because she had she had heard the word.
[1:26:49] Kids, read the Bible.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; Teenagers, read the Bible,
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; right? And when you get the Bible, when
[1:27:00] you get it down, you really read the
[1:27:01] Bible, listen to the message, and the
[1:27:05] Bible become a new book to you.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; Read the Bible and pray. And then when
[1:27:11] you hear a prophet, it'll become fresh
[1:27:14] to you.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; You'll know what he's talking about.
[1:27:16] Right.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; I'm convinced a lot of people have quit
[1:27:20] believing that brother Brandham had the
[1:27:21] spirit of Elijah because they don't know
[1:27:22] who Elijah was.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; They just got brought into a message and
[1:27:30] just kind of fit in and did what
[1:27:32] everybody else did,
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; but they didn't see it in the word.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; God, help us to see it in the word so we
[1:27:38] can convey that to our children, to our
[1:27:40] children's children if the Lord carries.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; So, we're to we're to be in an
[1:27:44] atmosphere of faith. Can I have five
[1:27:46] more minutes?
[1:27:48] All right. I didn't even look to see if
[1:27:49] anybody gave it to me.
[1:27:53] Are are you okay tonight? Y'all wanted
[1:27:56] the pastor back. Then when the pastor
[1:27:57] comes back, then everybody's like, "Man,
[1:28:02] we want some of them evangelists." But
[1:28:04] I'm glad I'm glad God's got some
[1:28:06] evangelists.
[1:28:07] 1 John chapter 4 and verse one. Beloved,
[1:28:10] believe not every spirit,
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; right? but try the spirit. So that we
[1:28:14] have a responsibility beyond just
[1:28:16] listening,
[1:28:18] beyond just even comparing scripture
[1:28:20] with scripture and those things, but he
[1:28:22] said, "Believe not every spirit, but try
[1:28:24] the spirits whether they're of God."
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; So I know sometimes we reject the
[1:28:30] preaching of the word just out of hand
[1:28:32] because it challenges some idea that we
[1:28:34] have. Make sure we check our idea with
[1:28:36] the word.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; There you go.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; Right. And try the spirit of the man.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; Right? Because a man could say something
[1:28:43] wrong, but try the spirit of the man.
[1:28:45] What's his motive? What's his his
[1:28:46] objective?
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; Right? And we're not supposed to use a
[1:28:49] filter of our ideas, but a filter of the
[1:28:51] word.
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; So, and brother Brandon taught us to
[1:28:54] discern spirits. I don't have time to
[1:28:56] get through all this tonight, but we'll
[1:28:57] we'll skip on through it. But we're not
[1:28:59] supposed to discern spirits by whether
[1:29:01] or not a person agrees with us.
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; Right. Or goes to the same meetings we
[1:29:06] go to.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; Right. We're taught to discern spirits.
[1:29:09] Brother Brandon preached a sermon. It
[1:29:10] would be good for you to listen to it.
[1:29:11] He's called the discernment of spirits.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; Right. And it's how to discern spirits.
[1:29:16] He taught us that. He said, and he
[1:29:18] taught talked about it with ministry. We
[1:29:20] don't discern whether a person agrees
[1:29:22] with us. We don't discern if they have
[1:29:23] signs and wonders or how gifted their
[1:29:26] ministry is.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; He said, "Discern their motive and their
[1:29:29] objective."
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; Well, I wish more people would do that.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; Because we're all human beings,
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; right? But if we could find a person
[1:29:37] that had the right motive in bringing
[1:29:38] the word, was a good steward of the
[1:29:40] word, then we'd be okay.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; Now look, brother Brand said, I think
[1:29:45] it's a good thing for us as ministers to
[1:29:47] follow our order when we see such things
[1:29:48] in the world we see today. He said we
[1:29:51] have an order from God is for the
[1:29:53] discerning of spirits trying the spirit.
[1:29:56] He said, I believe that's a very great
[1:29:57] lesson. So it's not just for ministers.
[1:29:59] He said for the church today is to try
[1:30:01] the spirit of anything. have discernment
[1:30:05] of the spirit so we don't judge by
[1:30:06] denomination. He said we should never
[1:30:08] judge by denomination. We should judge a
[1:30:10] man by the spirit he has. He said we are
[1:30:12] to discern spirits. Watch what the man
[1:30:14] has in mind. What he's trying to
[1:30:16] achieve.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; Right. So he may get his his what is
[1:30:22] that? His uh words up.
[1:30:26] I don't even know if I said that right.
[1:30:28] He may get things backwards. Brother
[1:30:29] Brandham did sometimes. Right. But try
[1:30:32] the spirit
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; and see what his motive is. What is his
[1:30:36] objective?
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; Look what he's trying to achieve. Listen
[1:30:39] to this. He's got odd ideas to ours.
[1:30:43] Let's go to that next slide. He's got
[1:30:44] odd ideas to ours. That's perfectly all
[1:30:47] right.
[1:30:49] We can preach there for an hour, but we
[1:30:51] won't.
[1:30:53] He's got odd ideas. That's okay.
[1:30:56] Oh, surely not because my ideas are
[1:30:59] right.
[1:31:01] How do you know?
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; The truth is some people have made
[1:31:04] themselves God.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; And that's why they can't ever be
[1:31:08] crossed
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; or corrected
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; because they've literally made
[1:31:12] themselves a deity.
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; God help us tonight not to do that.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; But the only way we can become deity
[1:31:20] speaking, listen to me, church, is by
[1:31:23] completely surrendering ourselves to
[1:31:25] that that voice in the inside to the
[1:31:28] spirit of God.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah. So he said if you got odd ideas to
[1:31:32] ours and he said that's perfectly all
[1:31:34] right if he's trying to achieve
[1:31:36] something for the kingdom of God.
[1:31:37] Discern that in him. If he's wrong and
[1:31:40] true in heart God will bring him around
[1:31:43] to the truth of the thing.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; After a while
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; let him alone. He said let him alone.
[1:31:50] See what he's trying to do.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; See what he's trying to do. Again, he
[1:31:57] said, "I'd rather be wrong in my
[1:31:58] doctrine and right in my heart."
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; He said, "God will respect it more."
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; Now, to hear the word of God, then we we
[1:32:07] don't hear with suspicion, but we humble
[1:32:10] ourselves to the word.
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; Look at the difference in Acts 13. How
[1:32:15] the Jews and Gentiles receive the word.
[1:32:18] Acts 13:48.
[1:32:20] You can go ahead and turn there if you
[1:32:21] want. I I promise I'm not going to hold
[1:32:23] you all night. It's only 8:23.
[1:32:25] You already knew that.
[1:32:28] Acts 13:48. When the Gentiles heard
[1:32:30] this, would they hear the preaching of
[1:32:32] the word? They heard how God had turned
[1:32:34] to the Gentiles and they said, "Yes,
[1:32:36] Lord.
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; We love that." They were glad and
[1:32:40] glorified the word of the Lord. And as
[1:32:43] many as were ordained to eternal life
[1:32:45] believed.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; And verse 49, "And the word of the Lord
[1:32:49] was published throughout all the
[1:32:51] region."
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; Yes. But the Jews,
[1:32:55] now we have a different response,
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; right? So the Gentiles heard gladly.
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; But the Jews stirred up the devout and
[1:33:02] honorable women and the chief men of the
[1:33:04] city and raised persecution against Paul
[1:33:07] and Barnabas and expelled them out of
[1:33:09] their coast.
[1:33:11] What was it? Now the Jews said they
[1:33:12] believed the written word. The Gentiles
[1:33:14] didn't even know what the written word
[1:33:15] was.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; But the Gentiles received the word
[1:33:18] gladly, the present truth, and the Jews
[1:33:21] turned it down. Right.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; How should we hear the word? We should
[1:33:24] hear it like this. Acts 17:10.
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; The brethren immediately sent away Paul
[1:33:29] and Silas by night to Berea who coming
[1:33:32] there went into the synagogue of the
[1:33:33] Jews. These were more noble than those
[1:33:36] in Thessalonica. In that they received
[1:33:38] the word with all readiness. That word
[1:33:42] means forwardness or predisposition.
[1:33:45] It's a willing mind.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah. They receive the word with a
[1:33:49] readiness of mind and search the
[1:33:52] scriptures daily. So don't just don't
[1:33:55] just take what a man says for gospel,
[1:33:58] but receive it in an atmosphere of faith
[1:34:00] and then search the scriptures.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; And if you find something that's wrong,
[1:34:04] you just lay that aside, toss that out.
[1:34:06] Don't toss the man out because he might
[1:34:08] have the right motive and God will bring
[1:34:11] him around.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; Do you see what I'm saying?
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:34:15] So, Acts 17:12, therefore, many of them
[1:34:18] believed because they received the word
[1:34:21] with a ready mind and searched the
[1:34:23] scriptures also of honorable women which
[1:34:25] were Greeks and of men, not a few.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; I'm closing his musicians come. If you
[1:34:30] want deity in your midst, this is
[1:34:32] brother Brandon speaking in the church
[1:34:34] age book. He said, then welcome and
[1:34:36] receive the word.
[1:34:42] Do you realize why they rejected
[1:34:44] Christ when he came
[1:34:47] was because it was the word. It was
[1:34:48] God's wrapped gift in a package they
[1:34:50] didn't expect and didn't want.
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; It was different from the way they
[1:34:56] imagined it.
[1:34:59] How many people come through a church or
[1:35:01] come through the the message, they come
[1:35:03] to it for a while and it's different
[1:35:06] from what they imagined
[1:35:08] and because of that they leave and say,
[1:35:10] "Well, they're off the word. [music]
[1:35:11] It's a cult. something else because it's
[1:35:14] different, right? But it was exactly
[1:35:17] what God said it would be. He was the
[1:35:20] word when he came. He came exactly the
[1:35:22] way the word said he would come. But
[1:35:24] they had just missed the manifestation
[1:35:28] of it. They were okay with the written
[1:35:30] word. Every one of the scribes and
[1:35:32] Pharisees can quote to you, "A virgin
[1:35:34] shall conceive."
[1:35:36] But they couldn't believe it when it
[1:35:38] came because it was wrapped differently
[1:35:40] than the way they would have wrapped it.
[1:35:43] It came differently than what they had
[1:35:44] preconceived. But God interprets his
[1:35:47] word by bringing it to pass. So how
[1:35:49] should we receive the word the way that
[1:35:52] the shepherds receive the word? When
[1:35:54] they stood there on the hill and the
[1:35:56] angels came down and told them that he's
[1:35:59] born, what did they do? They ran to see
[1:36:02] if what the angels told them was
[1:36:04] correct. Oh, I think we ought to do
[1:36:06] that. That's what the Brians did. When
[1:36:08] they heard the word, they took what the
[1:36:09] messenger said and they said, "Let's run
[1:36:11] and see if he is the word made flesh.
[1:36:14] Let's run and see if he is a healer.
[1:36:16] Let's search the scriptures and see if
[1:36:18] he is what they say he is." And then
[1:36:21] they received it and believed it and
[1:36:22] were baptized in the Acts two story.
[1:36:25] They were baptized [music]
[1:36:26] because they received Peter's words. The
[1:36:29] brother said, "Don't ever let anyone or
[1:36:31] anything
[1:36:33] get between you and that word."
[1:36:36] What a challenge [music] to us.
[1:36:40] Again, he said, 'I wonder
[1:36:44] a church. I
[1:36:46] I can I say this this way? This has
[1:36:48] always stuck out to me. Brother Aaron
[1:36:50] McGary read this years ago at a men's
[1:36:52] meeting I was at and this quote just
[1:36:55] stuck with me
[1:36:57] because I know that there's many times
[1:36:59] I'm not sufficiently [music] impressed
[1:37:02] with the word. Say, "God, help me to be
[1:37:05] tonight."
[1:37:07] When we try in our own effort try to
[1:37:10] make something happen, he said, "Preach
[1:37:12] the word. Preach the word. It won't go
[1:37:15] out void. It'll come back to you." He
[1:37:18] said, "I wonder if we are sufficiently
[1:37:21] impressed
[1:37:22] with the word
[1:37:24] in our midst." Brother Brandham told us,
[1:37:26] he said, "If you don't like what's being
[1:37:27] preached," he said, "don't reject it."
[1:37:29] He said if it's he said when I eat a
[1:37:31] cherry pie he said I don't I don't spit
[1:37:33] the pie out refuse to eat the pie if I
[1:37:36] come across a seed. He said [music] I
[1:37:38] spit out the seed. If there's a seed
[1:37:40] spit it out. But we want to be like Mary
[1:37:43] said be it unto me according to your
[1:37:45] word. Whatever the truth is that's what
[1:37:48] I want. And I'll be willing to search
[1:37:50] the scriptures and receive it in an
[1:37:52] atmosphere of faith. [music]
[1:37:53] That's how to hear the word. Do you love
[1:37:54] him tonight? Amen. Let's bow our heads
[1:37:57] together.
[1:37:59] Heavenly Father, I'm so thankful, Lord,
[1:38:02] for your blessings. Seems like I'm so
[1:38:05] excited every time to come back when the
[1:38:07] people are I haven't seen them in a
[1:38:09] while. And Lord, it just means so much
[1:38:11] to us. And I pray that it wasn't too
[1:38:13] much, Lord, but that be something here
[1:38:15] we could grab a hold of. Lord, I thank
[1:38:18] you for all that you've [music] done for
[1:38:19] us. Lord, as I travel all over the
[1:38:22] country, I see different churches and
[1:38:23] the struggles [music] and things that
[1:38:25] people go through and and I'm thankful,
[1:38:28] Lord. Lord, I thank you for people that
[1:38:31] [music] hear the word with a ready mind,
[1:38:34] a willing heart. Thank you for that.
[1:38:36] [music] I pray that would continue among
[1:38:38] us, Lord, that we'd have an atmosphere
[1:38:40] of faith to believe whatever the prophet
[1:38:43] said, whatever the word said, whatever
[1:38:44] the Bible says, whatever whatever is
[1:38:47] preached, as long as it's with what the
[1:38:48] Bible says.
[1:38:50] as long as it's something that the
[1:38:52] prophet preached. I pray you'd help us
[1:38:54] to receive it, Lord. And thank you for
[1:38:56] that. I I pray that you'd you keep us in
[1:39:00] your word. The enem is on every hand
[1:39:03] trying to defeat the [music] people,
[1:39:05] trying to defeat me. But Lord, I know,
[1:39:07] oh God, that we can come by your word.
[1:39:11] We've been given a a sword to fight
[1:39:13] with, Lord, a shield of faith, Lord.
[1:39:16] Something we can defend ourselves with.
[1:39:18] I thank you for it, Lord. I pray that
[1:39:21] you'd move in a mighty way. Heal the
[1:39:23] sick tonight, Lord. I pray again for
[1:39:24] those that have lost loved ones, Lord.
[1:39:26] That you'd bless them immensely. We
[1:39:28] pray. We thank you for it tonight in
[1:39:32] Jesus name. Amen. God bless you [music]
[1:39:35] tonight. My voice is bad, but I just
[1:39:38] felt like bringing those things. I hope
[1:39:40] it was a blessing.
[1:39:43] &gt;&gt; Your life [singing]
[1:39:45] will never [music] be
[1:39:48] the same. Can we [singing] stand
[1:39:50] together?
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; And there's only
[1:39:57] one way
[1:39:59] to touch him. [singing]
[1:40:02] Hallelujah.
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, just believe
[1:40:07] when you call on [singing]
[1:40:10] his name.
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; I wanted to
[1:40:13] I wanted to say something before you
[1:40:14] sing it again. time. I uh mom had a
[1:40:18] little bit of a blood pressure emergency
[1:40:20] last night and had called the the
[1:40:22] ambulance. She probably don't want you
[1:40:24] all to know that, [music] but I wanted
[1:40:25] you all to be praying. And it's just an
[1:40:27] imbalance or something in her ear that's
[1:40:30] causing her to her blood pressure to go
[1:40:32] up. And we believe he's a healer. Do we
[1:40:34] believe that? Let's just all pray
[1:40:35] together. Mom has been such a precious
[1:40:37] part of the church. And I'm so glad to
[1:40:39] have my mother with me. There was a time
[1:40:41] when ministry kept us apart and I was
[1:40:44] unable to be with her and her with me,
[1:40:45] but we're able to be together now. And I
[1:40:47] thank God for that every day. And if
[1:40:49] your mother's living, it means a lot.
[1:40:51] And to have her close to you. And so,
[1:40:53] mom's a big help to us. And we just want
[1:40:55] to pray the Lord will heal her, whatever
[1:40:56] this is, and take care of it. Heavenly
[1:40:58] Father, Lord Jesus, we love you tonight.
[1:41:01] We thank you, God. I pray that you'd
[1:41:04] reach down right now, Lord, and heal my
[1:41:06] the body, Lord, of my mother. Lord,
[1:41:09] you're you're no respector of persons,
[1:41:11] but Lord, she's Lord, she's served you
[1:41:13] all of her life. And I pray, God, that
[1:41:15] you would help her and bless her [music]
[1:41:16] right now. Lord, we claim her healing.
[1:41:19] We believe that you're the same
[1:41:20] yesterday, today, and forever. We thank
[1:41:22] you, Lord, for doing it. And we ask you
[1:41:24] to come right now, Lord, in this
[1:41:26] presence. May maybe there be someone
[1:41:28] else here, Lord, in need of healing
[1:41:30] tonight. May your anointing go over them
[1:41:32] right where they're at, oh God. May they
[1:41:34] receive their healing. We pray. I thank
[1:41:36] you, Lord, for my mother. I pray you'd
[1:41:38] bless her. Take away every spirit of
[1:41:39] fear, Lord, every every anxiety, Lord,
[1:41:42] that would come. And I pray you'd heal
[1:41:43] her completely. We pray in Jesus name.
[1:41:47] Amen. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Thank you,
[1:41:50] Lord. Hallelujah. Life will never be
[1:41:56] the same. [singing]
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; Oh, you believe you can touch him
[1:42:00] tonight. And there's only [music]
[1:42:04] one way
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; to touch him.
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, just [singing] believe
[1:42:14] when you call on his name. Sing it one
[1:42:19] more time with all your hearts now. Oh,
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; touching Jesus. [singing and music]
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord.

[1:42:43] And there's only [singing]
[1:42:47] one way
[1:42:49] to touch him.
[1:43:05] A woman
[1:43:08] tried many [music and singing]
[1:43:11] physicians
[1:43:13] [music]
[1:43:15] and yet grew worse.
[1:43:18] sold [singing and music] to Jesus
[1:43:21] she came.
[1:43:24] [singing]
[1:43:26] And when the crowd
[1:43:29] Oh, they tried to
[1:43:32] restrain [singing] her.
[1:43:37] You [music] know, she whispered
[1:43:40] these words through
[1:43:43] her pain.
[1:43:46] Oh, [singing] touching [music]
[1:43:49] Jesus
[1:43:51] is all that really matters.
[1:43:57] [music] Oh, and then your life
[1:44:01] will never [singing] be
[1:44:04] [music] the same.
[1:44:09] Oh, [singing] and there's only
[1:44:12] only one way to [singing] touch him.
[1:44:19] Oh, just believe [music and singing]
[1:44:23] when you call on his [music and singing]
[1:44:26] name. I like this verse here. Oh, now I
[1:44:31] was bound
[1:44:33] when I knelt
[1:44:36] at that old altar. [singing]
[1:44:40] Oh, [music]
[1:44:41] but they said Jesus
[1:44:45] could [singing] meet every
[1:44:48] need.
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, and with this prisoner, [singing]
[1:44:55] I finally
[1:44:58] touched [music] Jesus. [singing]
[1:45:01] Oh, he set me free. [music]
[1:45:05] Oh, praise the Lord.
[1:45:08] Free indeed. [music and singing] Did he
[1:45:10] do it for you tonight? Oh, touching
[1:45:14] Jesus. [singing]
[1:45:16] Oh, that's all that really matters.
[1:45:22] [music]
[1:45:23] Oh, [singing]
[1:45:24] and then your life will never be never
[1:45:29] be the [singing and music] same.
[1:45:33] Oh,

[1:45:37] [music] one [singing] way
[1:45:40] to touch him.
[1:45:44] Oh, just be [music]
[1:45:48] when you [singing] call on
[1:45:51] his name. Sing [music] that second verse
[1:45:53] like you mean it now. I was bound
[1:45:58] when I knelt [singing]
[1:46:00] at that old altar.
[1:46:04] Oh, but they said [music] Jesus
[1:46:09] could meet [singing]
[1:46:10] every
[1:46:12] need.
[1:46:15] [music] Oh, and when this prisoner

[1:48:26] Praise [music] his name.
[1:48:29] The bad times
