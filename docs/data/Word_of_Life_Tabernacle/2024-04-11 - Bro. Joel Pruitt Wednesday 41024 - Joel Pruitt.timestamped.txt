[37:46] okay so uh but but uh we miss him when
[37:49] he's gone he's been those have you enjoy
[37:51] the series he's been on recently that's
[37:53] been really a blessing to us and and my
[37:55] goodness the service this Sunday that
[37:56] was just a outstanding services and and
[38:00] uh I I don't think I can top that I feel
[38:03] a little bit intimidated after uh coming
[38:05] in behind those types of uh sermons and
[38:07] preachers that of that caliber but but
[38:10] uh I'll just try to get myself out of
[38:11] the way and let the Lord speak to you
[38:12] tonight amen if you have your Bibles
[38:14] let's turn to Joel chapter 2 and verse
[38:18] 25 it's my favorite book if you didn't
[38:20] know Joel chapter 2 verse 25 and it says
[38:23] I will restore to you the years that the
[38:25] Locust hath eaten the Anor worm and the
[38:28] caterpillar and the Palmer worm my great
[38:30] Army which I sent among you and you
[38:32] shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and
[38:36] praise the name of the Lord your God
[38:38] that hath dealt wondrously with you and
[38:41] my people shall never be ashamed can you
[38:44] say Amen to that Jude chapter 1 if we
[38:47] could go there quickly before you're
[38:48] seated Jude chapter
[38:50] 1:3 beloved I gave all diligence to
[38:53] write unto you of the common salvation
[38:55] it was needful for me to write unto you
[38:56] and exhort you that you should earnestly
[38:59] contend for the faith which was once
[39:01] delivered unto the Saints and you may be
[39:04] seated if I could title this sermon
[39:07] tonight I would title it restored to the
[39:09] faith and I think that's what we're all
[39:10] looking for but I wanted you to notice
[39:13] there in verse 26 Joel 2 ver 26 he sh he
[39:16] said You shall eat in plenty and be
[39:18] satisfied so you know that there's going
[39:20] to be a famine for hearing the word of
[39:22] God in this hour we live in but if
[39:24] you'll read that verse there you'll know
[39:25] there's not going to be a famine for the
[39:26] word of God God but there's going to be
[39:28] a famine for the doers and hearing the
[39:30] word of God can you say Amen to that and
[39:32] so there is no shortage of the word of
[39:34] God in this hour if you want to hear the
[39:36] word of God you can hear the word of God
[39:39] Amen brother Brandon said it like this
[39:41] he said I came and he said I'm storing
[39:43] up food so that when I'm gone you'll
[39:44] have something to eat now that didn't
[39:46] mean that nobody can feed this to you
[39:48] but he said these ministers will pick up
[39:49] this message and carry it on until the
[39:51] coming of the Lord so that's what we're
[39:53] doing here tonight we're not trying to
[39:54] take his place we're not trying to to do
[39:57] something something that we're not
[39:57] called to do but what we want to do is
[39:59] take this message and just continue on
[40:02] with it until the coming of the lord we
[40:04] believe it's close at hand and and as
[40:06] brother Stuart would preach on on Sunday
[40:08] night about the signs we we've received
[40:10] the last sign to our generation and we
[40:12] know that the message has come and so
[40:14] we're not trying to bring a new message
[40:16] or a new idea but what we want to do is
[40:18] get this same message that's been
[40:19] preached and preach it to the people and
[40:22] let the word work on the people that
[40:24] need to hear it today I believe there's
[40:25] some people that need to hear the word
[40:27] word of God in this hour I believe
[40:29] there's there's some people here tonight
[40:30] that need to take this word of God and
[40:32] use it as its intended purpose and use
[40:35] it to kill some devils in your life
[40:37] there's a lot of you dealing with
[40:39] sickness there's a lot of you dealing
[40:40] with heartbreak but let me tell you this
[40:41] message can take care of that here
[40:43] tonight well come on somebody this
[40:45] message can take you can take this word
[40:48] and it will heal your disease you can
[40:49] take this word and it can restore your
[40:51] family back together you can take the
[40:53] word that's been preached and it can
[40:55] take care of any problem that you have
[40:57] in your life because it says you will
[40:59] eat in plenty and you'll be
[41:01] satisfied he said and then you'll praise
[41:04] the name of the Lord come on somebody
[41:06] you will praise the name of the Lord
[41:08] your God and that he hath dealt
[41:10] wondrously with you well he's there's
[41:12] been some bad days there's been some
[41:13] hard days there's been some hard times
[41:16] but in all the times that you've been
[41:18] through in the good times and the bad
[41:20] you can say he's been good anyway it
[41:22] doesn't matter what you've been through
[41:24] because though God slay me yet I'll
[41:26] trust God why because he's good no
[41:28] matter what the circumstances look like
[41:31] even in the worst of times God is good
[41:34] even when it looks like there's not an
[41:35] inch of daylight left and you think
[41:38] about the eclipse and there just a
[41:39] little bit of sun around the darkness
[41:41] but you could still see daylight what
[41:42] was it it's because there's still just a
[41:44] little bit of light left in this hour
[41:46] and I'm looking at a little bit of light
[41:48] in this hour when the world is
[41:49] completely in darkness and the world is
[41:51] in chaos there's a people who have
[41:54] received the message and the messenger
[41:55] for your hour and all we have to do is
[41:58] eat on that food and then we don't have
[42:00] to worry about what the world's going
[42:02] through and what our political system's
[42:04] going to do because that's not going to
[42:05] save you would you like to see a better
[42:07] president sure we want to see our
[42:09] country we want to see our country
[42:10] succeed and we want to see our
[42:12] businesses do better but that's not
[42:14] going to save you church that's not
[42:15] going to help you in your spiritual walk
[42:17] but what's going to help you is to feed
[42:19] on the word of God that has been given
[42:21] in this day because you can eat in
[42:24] plenty and be satisfied why because
[42:27] because it's a restoration message it's
[42:29] to take you back to what you have need
[42:31] of it's to take you away from the things
[42:33] that are trying to drag you down this is
[42:35] not to restore you to just a a tongue's
[42:38] interpretation this is not just to
[42:40] restore you to a gift of the spirit but
[42:43] it's to take you all the way back to
[42:45] where the Holy Ghost can move in your
[42:47] life again and you'll act just like they
[42:49] did on the day of Pentecost that's the
[42:50] restored back I want to be and I believe
[42:52] he has a bride on the earth that can be
[42:55] the exact same church that was here when
[42:57] the acts the book of Acts was written
[42:59] why because he said he would raise up
[43:01] another group of people and in this day
[43:03] and in this hour under her messenger you
[43:05] will be the final voice to the final age
[43:08] why because the word of God is Not Just
[43:10] on tape but it's in you you have ate the
[43:13] word of God you have taken of the word
[43:15] of God well I wish you'd preach with me
[43:16] here tonight you have taken and tasted
[43:19] of the things of God and all you have to
[43:21] do is put it into action and take this
[43:24] word of God and take it to your children
[43:26] give it to your children I'm not talking
[43:27] about forcing your children because you
[43:29] can't force them to be saved but if you
[43:31] give them an opportunity to hear the
[43:34] word of God in this hour it can change
[43:36] your
[43:37] life brother Joel how do you know it can
[43:39] do it cuz it did it for me how do you
[43:41] know it can do it cuz I took some kids
[43:42] over there to Youth Camp I see your sign
[43:45] buddy thank you they got an amen sign in
[43:47] the book in the booth back there and I I
[43:49] tell you what that's the loudest amen
[43:50] I've heard all night let me tell you
[43:53] something I took some kids over there
[43:54] and I saw god get a hold of some kids
[43:56] well was it wasn't no workup and some
[43:58] emotional experience but it was God in
[44:01] his word revealing that you can still
[44:04] have the Holy Ghost
[44:06] today and so you we want to go on back
[44:09] here and I I want to just go down
[44:11] quickly I'm running out of time already
[44:12] to be and to be restored and this is a a
[44:15] translation here that I pulled up it
[44:17] says to give back and to return and to
[44:20] put or bring back into existence or use
[44:23] it says to bring back or to put into a
[44:26] former or original state to put again in
[44:30] possession of something so this is not
[44:33] something that that that is not good
[44:35] anymore but it is to use again it is
[44:37] something that is a possession it is a
[44:39] possession of something you've got to
[44:41] possess the Holy Ghost in This
[44:43] Hour you've got to there's no there's
[44:46] not an option to get out of here if you
[44:47] want to get out of here alive you got to
[44:49] have the Holy Ghost and that's the only
[44:51] way you're going to do it and if you go
[44:53] by way of the Grave let me tell you it's
[44:54] a lot better to die with the Holy Ghost
[44:56] because you don't want to come to the
[44:58] Judgment church but let's go ahead and
[44:59] be judged right here by the word of God
[45:01] and let it let it change us and let it
[45:03] get us ready for a Rapture and you say
[45:05] well the Rapture may not happen well let
[45:07] let it get you ready for heaven anyway
[45:09] let it get you ready for what's coming
[45:11] why because this message will change
[45:14] your life brother bam says I will
[45:16] restore sayi the Lord I will restore all
[45:18] the days of the caterpillar I'll restore
[45:20] all the blessings that the Lutheran had
[45:21] and the Baptist had and the Methodist
[45:23] had I will restore sayith the Lord a
[45:26] tree that won't stand stiff but when the
[45:28] Holy Ghost Falls they're flexible we
[45:30] need some flexible trees again amen he
[45:32] said and you he said we might be green
[45:34] but we're flexible that's one thing
[45:36] about us we may not be doctors of
[45:37] divinity and we may not have all the
[45:39] theology but we're green enough to bend
[45:41] to the power of God and rejoice and have
[45:44] a real good oldfashioned Holy Ghost
[45:47] meeting that's what we need today
[45:48] brother more than anything else sweeping
[45:51] the
[45:52] worlden well they got quiet but let me
[45:54] say it again we need a good oldfashioned
[45:56] holy meeting more than anything else
[45:59] sweeping the world you can say well we
[46:01] need more teachers I I think there's a
[46:03] there's a place for teaching and and I
[46:05] I'm I thank the Lord for teachers I
[46:07] learned from them but I think in this
[46:09] hour what we need is the holy ghost
[46:11] moving upon people again because this
[46:13] hour is an age of all kinds of Darkness
[46:16] on us and if you don't have the light on
[46:17] the inside of you it will overtake you
[46:19] in this day and there'll be no way to
[46:22] overcome Darkness except by light right
[46:25] and so brother Rand said what we have he
[46:27] says he said he said brother that's what
[46:29] we need more than anything that's the
[46:31] way an old-fashioned Revival is when you
[46:33] reach down and get a better hold step
[46:35] off of that old cor cold formal deed
[46:37] over here and get over here on the vine
[46:39] of the Lord and go to eating the fruits
[46:40] and the grapes off the vine of the Lord
[46:42] he said I will restore sayith the Lord
[46:44] so he's telling you what you need but he
[46:46] also tells you what what what is here
[46:49] what he's got here is a storehouse full
[46:51] of everything that you would need for a
[46:52] spiritual diet everything you would need
[46:54] to be taught everything you would need
[46:56] to be preached
[46:57] everything that you would need to
[46:58] overcome leoa is in the word of God it
[47:01] is your spiritual diet for today now the
[47:04] reason that people don't eat this
[47:06] spiritual diet enough the reason you see
[47:08] people that are not listening to the
[47:09] tapes anymore the reason you see people
[47:11] that are not hearing the message on a
[47:13] regular basis regular basis or reading
[47:15] their Bibles like they should is is is
[47:17] because it has got an age of deception
[47:20] to where they think it's going to be
[47:21] okay if they don't do that it's it's
[47:23] going to be okay but did you ever try to
[47:25] quit eating for a while and see how you
[47:27] feel in a couple days that's right if
[47:29] you and and and the same thank you buddy
[47:32] and if you keep doing that think about
[47:34] it if you quit eating you start losing
[47:36] weight you're starving to death it's the
[47:38] same way when you quit coming to the
[47:40] house of God it's the same way when you
[47:42] quit picking up your Bible and reading
[47:44] it it's the same way when you quit
[47:46] hearing the message of the hour why
[47:47] you're starving yourself spiritually but
[47:49] church I think it's time to be restored
[47:51] back to where we want to hear the
[47:53] message again I think it's time we're
[47:55] restored back to where we want toar here
[47:57] and we want to read and we want to get
[47:58] into the things of God I think more than
[48:01] ever we need to be a church on fire that
[48:03] wants what God has for us well I'm going
[48:05] to preach whether you're here or not but
[48:07] I think tonight I think there's some
[48:08] people here I I know I know it's
[48:10] Wednesday night I know you're tired but
[48:12] I wonder if we could just take a few
[48:14] moments to step on the devil of leosia
[48:16] and say I'm not going to be a lukewarm
[48:18] and a cold church member what I'm going
[48:20] to be is a is a person is on fire for
[48:23] God I want to be so on fire that when
[48:25] people see me they want what's wrong
[48:27] with me because I look so crazy to them
[48:29] but I want to be able to everywhere
[48:31] Jesus said I would the men everywhere
[48:33] were were were praying and lifting up
[48:34] holy hands why because you'd be a little
[48:37] crazy to the world but now if you've got
[48:39] a coworker that don't even know you're a
[48:40] Christian or if you got somebody in your
[48:42] family that don't know what you believe
[48:44] I think you need to get on fire enough
[48:46] to create a Revival in your home and
[48:48] create a Revival for your children
[48:50] create a Revival for your church let a
[48:53] Revival start in me and let me be
[48:55] restored to the Joy that I have need of
[48:58] brother Bram said restore what all the
[48:59] beauty that she was at one time now he
[49:02] uses the word beauty there but he says
[49:04] the character of the church is the
[49:06] beauty or excuse me the beauty of the
[49:08] church is the character of the people
[49:11] it's not about how beautiful your church
[49:13] is it's the character of the people
[49:15] that's what makes the difference in a
[49:16] church that's why we want to have love
[49:18] one for the other that's why we want to
[49:20] have Holy G the Holy Ghost move in our
[49:21] services we're not trying to be
[49:23] different we're not trying to be better
[49:25] but we want to have a character a
[49:27] Christlike character where God would be
[49:29] pleased to come Among Us and dwell Among
[49:31] Us and move Among Us and work miracles
[49:34] Among Us well I'll tell you church I
[49:36] think it's time we wake up and go back
[49:38] to where we left him take a hold of what
[49:40] we have need of let God move in our
[49:42] families again let God come in Among Us
[49:45] let God cause us to act right and do
[49:47] right it's not a bunch of rules and
[49:48] regulations but let the Holy Ghost go to
[49:51] work
[49:52] again and when you say well well now
[49:54] I've got a little condemnation well let
[49:56] that condemnation change you let the
[49:58] word cause a change in your life and
[50:00] then when you change to match the word
[50:02] the condemnation will fall
[50:05] away David says here Psalms 51 and10
[50:08] create in me a clean hold a clean heart
[50:10] oh God and renew a right Spirit Within
[50:12] Me cast me not away from thy presence
[50:15] and take not thy Holy Spirit from me
[50:17] that ought to be our prayer here tonight
[50:19] and in verse 12 restore unto me the joy
[50:22] of thy salvation and uphold me with thy
[50:25] free spirit oh I think everybody ought
[50:27] to pray that restore unto me the joy of
[50:30] my salvation it's not what it used to be
[50:32] but I want my joy back it's not what it
[50:34] used to be why there's been something to
[50:36] eat at it there's been an age of
[50:37] Deception come after you there's been
[50:39] some denominational Spirits get on you
[50:41] and it's eating away your joy it's
[50:43] eating away your peace and I tell you
[50:45] what it's causing it's causing an age of
[50:47] neurotics and it's causing anxiety like
[50:50] it never has it's causing depression on
[50:52] the people like it never has well you
[50:53] know I'm telling you the truth here
[50:55] tonight but let me tell you what God God
[50:56] will do to you he will give you a spirit
[50:59] that will overcome those things he will
[51:01] give you a spirit of Joy he will give
[51:03] you a spirit of peace he will give well
[51:05] come on somebody you're you're say well
[51:08] brother Joel why you preaching at me on
[51:10] a Wednesday night I'm not trying to
[51:11] preach at you but I think we need Joy
[51:13] back in the house of God again I think
[51:15] we need to have you know you say well
[51:16] you want to feel good yes I want to feel
[51:18] good when I go to church there ain't
[51:20] nothing wrong with feeling good in
[51:21] church there's nothing wrong with having
[51:23] fun in the house of God there's nothing
[51:25] wrong with enjoying your salvation if I
[51:28] can get excited in the ball game I can
[51:30] get excited in the house of God if I can
[51:32] get excited over the newest movie that
[51:35] come out then why couldn't I get excited
[51:37] in the house of God because he is
[51:39] eternal I'm an eternal being and if
[51:42] we're walking together then we've got to
[51:44] agree with each other because two can't
[51:46] walk together unless they agree but when
[51:48] I come under subjection to the word of
[51:51] God then I can walk in peace with God I
[51:53] can walk in peace with my brother I can
[51:55] walk in peace with my sister why because
[51:58] I have found the joy that I once knew
[52:01] and I have been restored back to it well
[52:03] come on Church you know what I think
[52:05] tonight I think we could all use a dose
[52:07] of a refilling of the Holy Ghost I think
[52:09] every one of us in the sound of my voice
[52:11] including myself could use a good
[52:13] oldfashioned dose of the Holy Ghost back
[52:15] in our church again where we can have a
[52:17] little bit more joy and a little bit
[52:19] more freedom and let some chains be
[52:21] broken I tell you what Jesus didn't go
[52:23] there and lock us up but he set you free
[52:26] from the demons that would try to
[52:27] overtake you we have got a savior in
[52:29] this hour that has come and he set you
[52:32] free and then we had a messenger come
[52:33] and say you are a free people you have a
[52:36] right to live like little children
[52:38] before your father you are free so why
[52:41] not act like
[52:43] it why not act like
[52:46] children amen well we're going to get
[52:49] through this one way or the other come
[52:50] on now I'm going to pull you are you
[52:53] going to pull me but we're going to get
[52:54] through it one way or the other
[52:57] now there was these these worms that ate
[52:59] at this tree every one of these worms
[53:01] ate at something joy and and they took
[53:04] and they would cause a form of godliness
[53:06] and did you know that Satan didn't mind
[53:08] there being churches come up in those
[53:10] age as long as he could get them to go
[53:12] back to the way he wanted them to
[53:13] worship Satan didn't care if you had a
[53:15] church he don't care if you're here
[53:16] tonight as long as you sit there and you
[53:19] don't care that you're really here but
[53:20] if you'll actually enter in one time
[53:22] you'll find that Satan will fight you
[53:25] well you don't well I don't want to be
[53:26] no you do want to be fought by the devil
[53:28] you want to fight that Spirit of
[53:31] sleepiness on a Wednesday night why
[53:33] because that Spirit has come after you
[53:35] and tried to overtake you and keep you
[53:37] from a blessing here tonight but can I
[53:39] go ahead and tell you something you have
[53:40] to fight back and you if you can
[53:43] overcome that Spirit then God can move
[53:45] on you on a Wednesday night he can move
[53:47] on you on a Sunday night it don't matter
[53:49] what time it is if God is here then all
[53:52] things are possible to them that believe
[53:54] I was just reading the report before I
[53:55] come out about brother Danny and now
[53:57] they said they didn't see any cancer
[53:58] that had spread or nothing and I said
[54:00] praise the Lord God still works God
[54:03] still
[54:07] works you you've looked at many of you
[54:09] know brother Ron Spencer the man's had
[54:12] stage four cancer for what seems like
[54:14] years and yet you can stand there and
[54:16] see the man stand there and he's I tell
[54:19] you God give me courage like that and
[54:22] yet if we're a little tired we don't
[54:24] want to go to church let me tell you I
[54:25] want to stand here here I don't care how
[54:27] I feel I don't care what's going on I
[54:29] want to kill that devil of leoda and we
[54:32] be restored back to a church that would
[54:35] wait all night if they had to on the
[54:37] power of God to come down that's the
[54:39] kind of church I want to
[54:40] be that's what I want to be we're not
[54:43] going back to to to ausa Street 1906
[54:46] Pentecost but we're going all the way
[54:48] back restored all the way back this is a
[54:51] Biblical move we're a part of did you
[54:53] know you're in a Revival right now yes
[54:56] sir but what youve got to do is
[54:57] participate in it you're in the bride's
[55:00] Revival the bride's Revival has come
[55:02] with the opening of the word well come
[55:04] on Church the opening of the word came
[55:07] and that was the bride's Revival you
[55:08] could live again you have seen things
[55:11] that you could never see before let me
[55:13] tell you young people something you know
[55:15] when we say the opening of the word
[55:16] we're not just talking about uh we're
[55:18] not just talking about a a new book or
[55:20] or like a Book of Mormons would have a
[55:21] new book no this was not a new book it
[55:23] was actually the the book that was
[55:25] already written it was was the scroll
[55:27] that was already sealed up until the
[55:28] time of the end but the book has now
[55:30] been open so you can actually see what
[55:33] it says now you say is the book open to
[55:35] everybody no the book's not open to
[55:37] everybody this book is only open to
[55:39] those who have eyes to see and ears to
[55:41] hear well come on somebody it it's still
[55:44] as closed As It Ever Was if you cannot
[55:46] see the revealed truth of the hour why
[55:48] because if you turn it down you're still
[55:50] walking in darkness but this book would
[55:52] come open and the seals would actually
[55:55] come off of it when you accepted the
[55:57] message of the hour and now you can see
[55:59] things that you've never seen before
[56:02] well then why don't the Baptist see it
[56:03] like we do because the seal has never
[56:05] come off to them and the seal has never
[56:07] been broken to them but to us it was
[56:10] broken oh come on Church you say why was
[56:12] it broken to me it you must be bride is
[56:15] all I can tell you because he's got to
[56:17] call somebody out in this hour he's got
[56:19] to have somebody ready and you've got to
[56:22] have the word to get ready for a Rapture
[56:25] right amen so I saw it Illustrated one
[56:28] time and I won't illustrate it because I
[56:30] don't have a kid here that I want to use
[56:32] and I don't have a long enough neck tie
[56:35] but I I was listening to a minister one
[56:37] time and he was showing me I I didn't
[56:39] know what the opening of the word was I
[56:40] was younger and I didn't know never
[56:42] heard it preached on in my life and he
[56:44] took his necktie and wrapped it around
[56:45] that Bible he said now it's sealed up
[56:49] and then he took it off and he said now
[56:50] it's open well that's true
[56:54] except if you can't if you if if you're
[56:56] not willing to open it if you're not
[56:58] willing to read the contents of it and
[57:00] believe what it said then you'll never
[57:03] know that the book's actually open but
[57:05] if you'll actually read the book and you
[57:07] actually see what it said then you'll
[57:09] see a message that came and the opening
[57:12] of the word when it was started to
[57:13] reveal you'll start to see Christ
[57:15] unfolding himself as we heard Sunday
[57:17] morning you'll start to see Christ
[57:19] unfolding himself or maybe that was
[57:20] Wednesday night they all run together
[57:22] but but but but listen to me Christ is
[57:25] unfolding himself again he unfolded
[57:28] himself through a man called William
[57:29] Brandon we could see Christ in the
[57:31] aspects of his life you could see him
[57:33] reveal he was a son of man revealing the
[57:35] son of man but can you see him now
[57:38] revealing himself in a body called The
[57:40] Bride you are a restored body you are a
[57:44] word body you are you are a word bride
[57:47] you are everything that the Bible taught
[57:50] would come you are living it out now you
[57:52] are the generation you are the ones that
[57:54] was told to come well come on Church
[57:56] you are the you are the expression of
[57:59] the open book you are the revealing of
[58:02] the word of God you are this day the
[58:04] scripture is revealed why because you
[58:07] are living the word of God I've got to
[58:09] live the word of God and if you can be a
[58:11] written epistle and I could be a written
[58:13] epistle then what are we we are the word
[58:15] made flesh today sir well that's a
[58:18] little hard on me brother Joel you are
[58:20] the word made flesh but you got to walk
[58:22] in the light of the word you've got to
[58:24] you've literally got to do what the word
[58:25] say head why it's not just a rule well
[58:28] well brother Joel I don't know if I'm
[58:29] doing it well do what you do know and
[58:31] walk in the life that's been shown to
[58:33] you maybe it won't all be shown to you
[58:35] right away but as it's unfolded walk in
[58:38] the light now if you hold a flashlight
[58:40] down here at the floor and you look at
[58:42] that light you walk where that light is
[58:44] now you don't know what's coming up here
[58:45] you don't know what's over here and
[58:46] what's over here but you walk where the
[58:49] light has been shown why because you can
[58:51] see where you're going and it's the same
[58:53] way with the message when the message
[58:55] shines something on that Bible and it
[58:57] opens it up to you walk in that light of
[58:59] the word and every time it moves move
[59:02] with the
[59:03] light now that's what we need to do
[59:05] today now let me get on down here I
[59:06] actually haven't got anywhere yet but
[59:08] we're going to try to get you know
[59:10] sometimes our young people don't
[59:11] understand that that we use phrases all
[59:13] the time and maybe they don't understand
[59:14] what we're saying but I just want to say
[59:16] this the opening of the word was the
[59:17] message literally revealing what was on
[59:19] the pages of the Bible and it is coming
[59:21] to life today it is the word becoming
[59:24] alive again it is not a deadly letter
[59:26] because the letter kth but the spirit
[59:28] giveth life and the the the spirit has
[59:30] comeing this day to restore everything
[59:32] back everything that this one ate
[59:34] everything the Lutheran would take out
[59:36] everything the Baptist would take out
[59:38] everything the Wesley would take out
[59:39] it's restored it all back to an original
[59:42] church with an original seed well come
[59:44] on somebody and if you are one of them
[59:46] you can see what the word is doing in
[59:49] this hour and he said here he said I
[59:51] will restore say the Lord all the years
[59:53] I'll send back another church he said I
[59:56] will restore that original Power again
[59:58] in the evening time it shall be light
[1:00:01] can you say amen amen he said down in
[1:00:04] the heart of that tree no matter how
[1:00:05] many branches is pruned there will come
[1:00:07] forth the Royal Seed of Abraham I
[1:00:09] believe that's you here tonight and I I
[1:00:11] believe if I was you I'd say that's me
[1:00:13] why because you have got to be the Seed
[1:00:16] of Abraham now you may not look back in
[1:00:18] your family history and see Abraham in
[1:00:20] your family history you may not be able
[1:00:22] to say hey that was my great great great
[1:00:24] great great great 500 times Grandpa but
[1:00:26] what you can do is say it doesn't matter
[1:00:28] if he's there or not because my natural
[1:00:30] seed has no bearing on the spiritual
[1:00:33] seed and I can look back and say I see
[1:00:35] Christ in my in my family history I see
[1:00:38] Abraham I see Isaac I see Jacob why
[1:00:41] because you are the Royal Seed of
[1:00:43] Abraham through Christ and he said all
[1:00:46] down through there he said he said God
[1:00:48] promised it and God will do it he said
[1:00:50] he would do it I will restore all the
[1:00:52] years that the denomination heat I will
[1:00:54] restore all the years I the thing off
[1:00:56] but yet there will come a vine out of
[1:00:58] the heart of it and he'll be like a tree
[1:01:00] that's planted by the rivers of water a
[1:01:02] man that's planted by the rivers of
[1:01:03] water and that meditates in the word of
[1:01:06] God day and night not to a Creed not to
[1:01:09] a denomination come on somebody he said
[1:01:11] not to a denomination but meditates in
[1:01:13] the word day and night he'll be like a
[1:01:14] tree that's planted by the rivers of
[1:01:17] water branches shall not wither well I
[1:01:19] hope you hear me right there you can't
[1:01:21] dry up if you're planted by the rivers
[1:01:23] of water you can't be a dead church
[1:01:25] member if you're planted by the rivers
[1:01:27] of water you can't be formal if you're
[1:01:29] FL if you're sitting by and you're
[1:01:31] planted by the streams flowing with the
[1:01:33] spirit of God moving by you all the time
[1:01:35] why there'll be a breeze go by and
[1:01:37] you'll be green and be able to move with
[1:01:38] it why you're not going to be an old
[1:01:40] stiff tree that ever time the spirit
[1:01:42] moves you start to croak a little bit
[1:01:44] all right all right come on now well you
[1:01:47] can say am man if you want to but let me
[1:01:48] just tell you this we've got too many
[1:01:51] that have decided to make Church a
[1:01:53] formal Creed even in the message
[1:01:56] but I think it's time we recognize we're
[1:01:58] not just normal church members there
[1:02:01] ain't nothing normal about us we're a
[1:02:02] bunch of oddballs the very best of us
[1:02:05] the very best dressed the very quietest
[1:02:08] of you you're still just an oddball
[1:02:11] you're just an ugly duckling anyway you
[1:02:14] might as well worship and let the devil
[1:02:16] know whose side you're
[1:02:19] on he said he'll bring forth his fruit
[1:02:23] in the season now we believe in the
[1:02:26] season now and let me let me tell you
[1:02:28] what season it is Malachi 4 you all know
[1:02:30] the scripture Malachi 4:5 behold I will
[1:02:32] send you Elijah the prophet before the
[1:02:34] coming of the great and Dreadful day of
[1:02:35] the Lord and he shall turn the hearts of
[1:02:37] the fathers to the children and the
[1:02:40] Heart of the children to their fathers
[1:02:41] un lest I come and smite the Earth with
[1:02:43] a curse so this is the age of turning
[1:02:45] back this is a time of being restored
[1:02:47] this is a time where we can see things
[1:02:49] that you've never seen before this is a
[1:02:51] time of
[1:02:52] understanding things you've never
[1:02:54] understood before that's right he he
[1:02:56] said him that understandeth will I grant
[1:02:59] now he he goes on and I've been
[1:03:00] listening to uh uh the the the
[1:03:03] restoration of the brid tree and I think
[1:03:04] if you go listen to that message it'll
[1:03:06] really help you it's a long one so if
[1:03:07] you got to sit down and study it and
[1:03:09] figure it out but but that is a
[1:03:10] wonderful sermon it'll tell you where
[1:03:12] we're at right now it is showing you who
[1:03:14] you are as the bride it is showing you
[1:03:16] what what age we're in it is showing you
[1:03:18] that there is a time where the people
[1:03:20] have to recognize their God and say we
[1:03:23] are the generation that's not going to
[1:03:24] stop we are the generation that's not
[1:03:26] going to turn back we are the generation
[1:03:28] who not going to say when the Giants
[1:03:30] start coming that we're going to give up
[1:03:31] and go back no we haven't even seen what
[1:03:33] Pharaoh had and we don't want to go back
[1:03:36] because what we're looking back to is a
[1:03:38] Pentecostal blessing and that's what we
[1:03:40] want that's what we need well come on
[1:03:42] somebody what we need is a Pentecostal
[1:03:45] blessing in the church again you can say
[1:03:47] well I don't want to be Pentecostal you
[1:03:49] are a Pentecostal if you're an acts 238
[1:03:52] Christian that's
[1:03:54] right yeah some of you are saying well
[1:03:57] are you saying we you no you're a
[1:04:00] Pentecostal the devil will attack all
[1:04:02] kinds of names on a
[1:04:04] church I'm a Church of Christ I believe
[1:04:07] we should be but I like my
[1:04:11] music think about it the devil can use
[1:04:14] good names on a church that doesn't make
[1:04:16] the name wrong but the devil used it
[1:04:19] wrong but I mean you could say that uh
[1:04:21] you know you could say an assembly would
[1:04:23] be a bad word because some churches use
[1:04:25] it wrong I don't have any problem with
[1:04:26] assembly you can say the word church has
[1:04:28] been used wrong and it has it's become a
[1:04:30] soup supper brother Bram said and it's
[1:04:32] become a lodge and a place to play cards
[1:04:34] and and listen I have I believe in
[1:04:36] Fellowship I think a church ought to be
[1:04:38] so full of love for one another they
[1:04:40] can't wait to fellowship with one
[1:04:41] another but I think when when the main
[1:04:43] thing is no longer the preaching of the
[1:04:45] word then the church has lost its focus
[1:04:47] we have got to keep the word in front of
[1:04:49] the people we have got to keep well come
[1:04:51] on somebody we've got to keep the spirit
[1:04:53] of God Among the people we got to keep
[1:04:55] the word preached to the people you've
[1:04:57] got to know who you are and recognize
[1:05:00] your day and what you're living in so
[1:05:02] that you can see what you've got to go
[1:05:04] back to sometimes you get ahead of the
[1:05:06] you you get the cart ahead of the horse
[1:05:08] a little bit and say well I want my
[1:05:09] healing but did you ever go back to
[1:05:11] identify yourself with the
[1:05:14] Healer I need to identify myself with
[1:05:17] something and I am so proud to identify
[1:05:19] myself with the message of the
[1:05:21] hour it's not a cult it's not a lie I'm
[1:05:26] not worshiping a man but what I've come
[1:05:28] is to worship God in his fullness in
[1:05:31] this hour you say why did people laugh
[1:05:34] at me for believing like I do because
[1:05:35] they laughed at Jesus for believing like
[1:05:37] he was he was God in flesh and they
[1:05:39] laughed at him do you really think
[1:05:40] you're going to get it any
[1:05:43] easier they couldn't see God walking
[1:05:45] among them right they couldn't see a a
[1:05:48] prophet that lived a life in you you
[1:05:50] take brother brandom's life and and
[1:05:52] people couldn't put a finger on it and
[1:05:54] now you got some people sitting behind
[1:05:55] the the screen that are sitting there
[1:05:57] you know keyboard Warriors well what
[1:05:59] about this and what about that well God
[1:06:01] never revealed it to you intellectual
[1:06:03] faith God never revealed it to those
[1:06:05] that didn't have faith to believe in the
[1:06:07] first place he bypassed those types of
[1:06:10] people and gave it to you because he
[1:06:12] knew you had a seed to accept
[1:06:17] it yes it's going to be hard yes it's
[1:06:19] going to be uh it's going to be
[1:06:21] different because it's not what the
[1:06:22] world makes look common but what's come
[1:06:25] common to you is not the word of God if
[1:06:28] you're living in the things of the world
[1:06:30] listen we have to live among the people
[1:06:32] of the world we have to be around the
[1:06:33] people of the world that's that's part
[1:06:34] of your everyday life that's part of
[1:06:36] your job but you do not have to be
[1:06:38] partakers of the spirits that are in the
[1:06:40] world you can come to church and you can
[1:06:42] say Lord renew renew a right Spirit
[1:06:45] within me I I I got around the wrong
[1:06:47] crowd and I started doing things I
[1:06:49] shouldn't have said or shouldn't have
[1:06:51] said doing things I shouldn't have done
[1:06:53] I got around some bad people but I've
[1:06:55] come back here to lay down my life
[1:06:56] before you I'm not going to give in to
[1:06:59] the spirit of leosia but I'm here to be
[1:07:02] a worshipper in the house of God I'm
[1:07:05] here to say I'm on the Lord's Side and I
[1:07:07] would like to say tonight if you're on
[1:07:09] the Lord's Side I'd say come on over
[1:07:11] here where we can worship freely where
[1:07:13] we can say Amen in church where we can
[1:07:16] back the word of God unashamed because
[1:07:19] the Bible said I could rejoice and I
[1:07:22] could have peace and I would be
[1:07:24] unashamed in this day to declare the
[1:07:26] counsel of God to you why because I know
[1:07:29] without a shadow of a doubt I'm not
[1:07:31] looking through my carnal mind I'm not
[1:07:33] looking through eyes of what the
[1:07:34] internet has to say about the prophet
[1:07:36] but what I'm saying I've seen it in the
[1:07:38] word of God I saw where he's going to
[1:07:40] send Elijah the prophet I've seen in the
[1:07:42] word where there would be a man that
[1:07:44] would be here in this day that would do
[1:07:45] the same sign that Jesus did and he come
[1:07:48] and done it so I'm not worshiping him
[1:07:51] but he he didn't stop there he said that
[1:07:53] man would call out a bride that message
[1:07:56] that that man brought would call out a
[1:07:58] bride why Christ is the word and he
[1:08:00] brought the word of God with him and
[1:08:02] Christ come down and confirmed it and
[1:08:04] Christ didn't die in 1965 but he's still
[1:08:07] here
[1:08:08] tonight we don't have to we don't have
[1:08:10] to look back and say well well well what
[1:08:13] about brother Brandon what did he it
[1:08:14] look quit looking at the man look at the
[1:08:17] message look at the message he brought
[1:08:19] he was one of the greatest men I I I
[1:08:21] think I'd love to meet him I'd love to
[1:08:23] do that but that but that's not what I'm
[1:08:24] looking at I've never seen him but the
[1:08:26] Bible said blessed are you who have not
[1:08:28] seen and yet believe so I can say
[1:08:31] tonight even though I've never seen him
[1:08:33] I believe the message that he brought
[1:08:35] because it was a message of thus sayith
[1:08:37] the Lord it was a message of restoration
[1:08:39] and it has restored my heart back to the
[1:08:42] faith of the Pentecostal
[1:08:44] fathers I've not been restored to the
[1:08:46] Baptist I haven't been restored to the
[1:08:48] Methodist I haven't been restored to a
[1:08:51] modern-day Pentecost but I believe my
[1:08:53] heart is being restored all the way back
[1:08:55] to where I can worship without
[1:08:57] restrictions in the house of God I well
[1:08:59] come on somebody when he took you back
[1:09:01] to that age he's taking you back to a
[1:09:03] time where there's promises because in

[1:12:18] young people I can tell you there was a
[1:12:19] couple of them sitting there in church

[1:12:23] come back and told me I got the holy
[1:12:25] ghost I don't care what anybody tells me
[1:12:27] I'm just going to take them with their
[1:12:28] word and believe it why because I want
[1:12:30] to believe that God still works I want
[1:12:32] to believe that God still fills with the
[1:12:34] Holy Ghost I want to believe that God
[1:12:36] can still change a young person that is
[1:12:38] going astray and bring them back to the
[1:12:39] house of God and they can worship again
[1:12:42] and they can take complexes off of them
[1:12:44] and fear off of them well let me just go
[1:12:46] ahead and tell you for a minute God can
[1:12:47] still do what God's always done and if
[1:12:50] he ever gave the Holy Ghost to one he
[1:12:52] can still give the Holy Ghost today you

[1:15:28] sitting on the church pew that need to
[1:15:30] experience a refilling of the Holy Ghost
[1:15:32] I love to see people on fire for God

[1:15:56] time you had an experience of of God in
[1:15:58] the house of God again brother man would
[1:16:00] go on here he said you're lost undone
[1:16:01] cre creation of God dominated by the
[1:16:04] devil that's right but still your sons
[1:16:06] and daughters of God he's not willing
[1:16:08] that any of you should perish but all
[1:16:10] might come to repentance see he's done
[1:16:12] everything that lays possible for only
[1:16:14] God himself could do this to give the
[1:16:16] opportunities to the creature of his to
[1:16:19] accept and be what he wants you to be
[1:16:21] back in your right estate again he wants
[1:16:23] to restore you back to your right mind
[1:16:25] he wants you to lose the mind of the
[1:16:27] world and take on the mind of Christ it
[1:16:29] is a restoration process that's right
[1:16:33] glory amen brother brand said no person
[1:16:35] in the right mental status is in their
[1:16:37] right mental status until they've
[1:16:38] accepted the Lord
[1:16:40] Jesus they call us crazy am but but
[1:16:44] they're crazy if they haven't accepted
[1:16:45] what we've
[1:16:47] got amen listen church I I'm not putting
[1:16:50] anybody out because there brother
[1:16:52] Brandon made a statement there'll be
[1:16:53] some there that we don't think will be
[1:16:55] there and some there that we we thought
[1:16:57] would be there that won't be there I I'm
[1:16:58] not the judge but I'm going to tell you
[1:17:01] this I think you'll see a I I I I I
[1:17:03] believe this with all my heart I believe
[1:17:05] the bride will be doing the works that
[1:17:08] Christ did on the earth I believe
[1:17:09] that'll be the bride that doesn't have
[1:17:11] anything to do with someone being saved
[1:17:12] or the whosoever wills but I will say
[1:17:14] this the bride of Christ will be doing
[1:17:16] the works of Christ on the earth until
[1:17:18] is coming why because that is our job to
[1:17:21] do we have taken on his spirit and if
[1:17:23] you have the spirit uh if you had the
[1:17:25] spirit of uh uh well you just pick a
[1:17:27] person if you had the spirit of an
[1:17:28] Auctioneer you'd be Auctioneer and if
[1:17:29] you had the spirit of a of a Bill
[1:17:32] Gaither you'd write songs nobody knows
[1:17:33] who that is anybody you
[1:17:36] don't your grandma has not raised you
[1:17:39] right she does she does you just ask her
[1:17:43] she'll tell you exactly who that is but
[1:17:45] if you have the spirit of Al Capone you
[1:17:47] don't know who that is either that's
[1:17:50] good if you had the spirit of Jesus
[1:17:53] there you go
[1:17:55] I finally found somebody he knew about
[1:17:57] well that is the best one but if you
[1:17:59] have his Spirit won't you do his
[1:18:01] Works come on somebody we might as well
[1:18:04] have church while we're here I got a
[1:18:06] minute
[1:18:08] left listen we don't have to worry when
[1:18:11] we come to church and say well I wonder
[1:18:12] if the preacher is going to preach at me
[1:18:13] well you know what if your if your
[1:18:15] heart's right with God I don't care if
[1:18:17] the preacher starts preaching you say
[1:18:18] well that must have been for somebody
[1:18:21] else but if if the word does move on
[1:18:25] your heart if the word is trying to
[1:18:27] correct your life in some way it's not
[1:18:30] me it's not brother Ben it's not brother
[1:18:31] Stewart it's not any other brother that
[1:18:33] can come in here preach to you the word
[1:18:35] itself is what has to come into your
[1:18:37] life and it will change you it will take
[1:18:40] you back here's an old song take me back
[1:18:42] to the way it used to be take me back
[1:18:44] Lord take me back why because I want to
[1:18:46] go back to where I found him and go back
[1:18:49] and feel that experience all over again
[1:18:51] it's like a person that's been married a
[1:18:53] long time and maybe they maybe they
[1:18:54] maybe theyve they're not on their
[1:18:56] honeymoon no more and things have
[1:18:57] changed why you want to go back why
[1:18:59] because you remember what it was like
[1:19:02] when you when you first found that girl
[1:19:03] and she looked at you and she was pretty
[1:19:05] and she was young and and all those
[1:19:08] things and she's
[1:19:14] changed it goes both ways doesn't it
[1:19:16] brother
[1:19:17] Bill think about it I want to go back I
[1:19:20] want to fall in love with Jesus all over
[1:19:22] again I want to love him like I never
[1:19:24] had before I want to feel this presence
[1:19:27] like I've never felt it before why
[1:19:29] because there's something within me that
[1:19:30] when I get cold I got to come back
[1:19:33] that's why the Holy Ghost is important
[1:19:34] here tonight church it's not just so we
[1:19:36] can have a loud church because the Holy
[1:19:39] Ghost isn't always
[1:19:40] loud sometimes you'll sit there and
[1:19:42] you'll cry like a baby sometimes you'll
[1:19:44] raise your hands and scream I'll take it
[1:19:46] however he comes but I want his
[1:19:48] presence I want to be restored to that
[1:19:51] again I want that Restoration in my life
[1:19:54] I want wonder if we could everone say
[1:19:55] that tonight I want to be restored back
[1:19:57] to my first love I want to be restored
[1:19:59] back to a book of Acts church I want to
[1:20:01] be restored back to where I lose this
[1:20:03] cold formal well you know I just don't
[1:20:06] want to be the way I am no more I want
[1:20:08] to keep pressing forward and pressing on
[1:20:10] because it's not them that that that
[1:20:12] starts the race but it's those that
[1:20:14] finish the race it's those that can keep
[1:20:16] on keeping on and keep on with the ways
[1:20:18] of God why because brother Brandon would
[1:20:20] say it like this he said what is it
[1:20:22] enforcing give it back see that's it
[1:20:25] that's what it's talking about restore
[1:20:26] it bring it back to its right owner and
[1:20:29] he said and Satan has if Satan has
[1:20:31] robbed you of the privilege of being a
[1:20:33] son or a daughter of God we have a right
[1:20:36] by the Holy Spirit to enforce the claim
[1:20:38] of God and bring it back amen well come
[1:20:42] on somebody you have a right you say
[1:20:45] well I don't have any rights yes you
[1:20:46] have a right you've been given the
[1:20:48] spirit of authority you've been given a
[1:20:50] spirit of power why it's not your power
[1:20:52] it's not your Authority but is Christ
[1:20:54] Christ that has given you the authority
[1:20:56] it is his spirit in you doing the
[1:20:58] Greater Works it is his Spirit that'll
[1:21:00] bring a bride out of the Le of sea and
[1:21:02] take her on up in a Rapture why he said
[1:21:04] if he's Afflicted you and made you sick
[1:21:05] we have a right before God to enforce
[1:21:07] the laws of God by his stripes we are
[1:21:10] healed how many needs healing here
[1:21:11] tonight if you're if you're sick put
[1:21:13] your hand up to him say Lord I I want
[1:21:15] healing I'm enforcing my right to
[1:21:18] Healing here tonight what is it he said
[1:21:20] he said Satan turn him loose bring him
[1:21:22] back and turn him loose and you're
[1:21:24] taking out yonder of death and we claim
[1:21:26] him and bring him back he said that's
[1:21:27] the enforcement restore it back to its
[1:21:30] natural condition again a man is sick a
[1:21:32] baby is sick a woman is sick see they're
[1:21:34] out of their natural condition they're
[1:21:36] you're not listen church it's not
[1:21:39] natural for you to be sick it's not
[1:21:41] natural for you to be lost but it's
[1:21:43] natural for you according to the laws of
[1:21:45] God to be healed it's it's natural for
[1:21:47] you to come to the house of God and
[1:21:48] worship it's natural for you see it's
[1:21:51] unnatural to keep you away from the
[1:21:53] things of God but God has given you the
[1:21:55] spirit to overcome the unnatural
[1:21:58] affections of the things of the world
[1:22:00] and has given you a natural affection
[1:22:02] again for the things of God and the love
[1:22:04] of God he said he was wounded for our
[1:22:06] transgression with his stripes we were
[1:22:08] healed and now we have a right to
[1:22:10] enforce that law and the lawgiver the
[1:22:13] Holy Spirit himself is here the agent of
[1:22:17] God to see that it's done that way well
[1:22:20] I'd like to say this just in closing as
[1:22:22] musicians would come brother bandam said
[1:22:24] my min hisory is to declare he is here
[1:22:27] we heard it a camp when brother Andrew
[1:22:29] was preaching he said he read that quote
[1:22:31] over and over again my Ministry is to
[1:22:33] declare he is here and I would like to
[1:22:36] say that maybe that was brother
[1:22:37] Brandon's Ministry but as a minister of
[1:22:39] the Gospel I'd like to say this I want
[1:22:41] to stand here Time After Time and
[1:22:43] declare that he is here he's not listen
[1:22:47] we know the Corporal body's coming but
[1:22:49] his spirit is here we don't have to wait
[1:22:52] for the spirit to come in a special
[1:22:53] service we don't have to wait for a
[1:22:55] spirit to come but the spirit of
[1:22:57] restoration is
[1:23:00] here I wonder how many tonight would say
[1:23:02] Lord restore me back restore my joy
[1:23:05] again restore my health these are
[1:23:07] benefits of God that belong to you these
[1:23:10] are your inheritances that belong to you
[1:23:13] nobody can take them away why because it
[1:23:15] was written in the palm of his hand that
[1:23:17] you are his son you are his daughter and
[1:23:20] nobody can tell you it was written with
[1:23:22] blood and it cannot be taken away God
[1:23:26] has given you the authority to walk all
[1:23:28] over devils and walk all over the spirit
[1:23:31] of condemnation and walk all over the
[1:23:33] spirit of depression why because the
[1:23:35] spirit of depression has no hold anymore
[1:23:37] the spirit of look come on somebody the
[1:23:40] spirit of sickness has no hold on you
[1:23:42] you know what sickness is it's a devil
[1:23:45] cast him
[1:23:47] out come on somebody are you sick here

[1:23:59] is this well do we just do we just name
[1:24:01] it and grab it and I'll tell you what
[1:24:03] it's almost that simple if you can just
[1:24:05] come before God in the right attitude
[1:24:07] you can have whatever you need sir amen
[1:24:11] stand to your feet
[1:24:13] tonight brother BR said this in
[1:24:16] closing he said when he separated Eve
[1:24:18] from Adam Eve fell by disbelieving the
[1:24:20] word that's right that's where the
[1:24:21] church failed today disbelieving the
[1:24:22] word but in this case to the Royal seed
[1:24:25] called predestinated to eternal life the
[1:24:27] Royal Seed of Abraham they believe that
[1:24:29] word I don't care what comes or goes how
[1:24:31] much they laugh who says this that or
[1:24:34] the other they are ordained to eternal
[1:24:36] life and she goes right straight back
