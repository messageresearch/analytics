[51:12] Faith is a substance of things hoped for
[51:15] the evidence of Things Not Seen for by
[51:18] the elders obtain a good report through
[51:21] faith we understand the worlds were
[51:23] framed by the word of God so that things
[51:25] which are seen were not not made of
[51:27] things which do appear by faith a will
[51:29] offered unto God a more excellent
[51:31] sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained
[51:34] a witness that he was righteous God
[51:36] testifying of his gifts and by this he
[51:39] being dead yet speaketh but by faith
[51:43] Enoch was translated that he should not
[51:45] see death and was found because God
[51:47] translated him for before his
[51:50] translation he had a testimony that
[51:53] pleased God but without faith it is
[51:57] impossible to please
[51:59] him amen can we just bow our hearts one

[53:48] omnipresent he's here and and you know
[53:50] we've heard the prophets say those

[53:53] Brother David if he was a God that had
[53:56] all power power he was a God that had
[53:58] knew all things but he wasn't present
[54:00] and but I thank God tonight that we

[54:17] our present and he's got everything
[54:19] under his control nothing happens listen
[54:21] friends I I believe this brother Ben
[54:23] that that that that God is so far head
[54:26] of the enemy before the enemy ever
[54:29] thinks of a tricked and trapped and try
[54:31] to make in your life God's already knows
[54:33] what he's up to and amen that's a mighty
[54:36] God there's nothing that and I've said
[54:38] this many times we can never put God in
[54:40] Checkmate he's always a step ahead of
[54:43] the enemy and that's what kind of God I
[54:45] want to praise tonight amen I believe
[54:48] and his anchor that he's placed that is
[54:50] sure and steadfast in our hearts it's
[54:53] unremovable it can't be broken it can't
[54:56] be taken away from as an absolute of the
[54:59] Soul Heen it's not here today and gone
[55:02] tomorrow but it's an absolute it's here
[55:05] the weather every storm every hard time
[55:08] every grief every sorrow amen anything
[55:11] you as a Believer may go through listen
[55:14] friends God has placed something in the
[55:17] Holy Ghost that's going to take care of
[55:19] every one of your needs and if you go by
[55:21] the way of a grave They Ain't No Grave
[55:24] going to hold this body down either amen
[55:27] why because it's him it's not about who
[55:29] you are who I am or who brother Ben is
[55:32] or who brother Harvey is it's but God
[55:35] rich in Mercy yes sir it's God rich in
[55:38] Mercy it's not what I can do it's not
[55:41] what even our pastor over here can do
[55:43] but it's God rich in Mercy yes sir don't
[55:47] you love him what an
[55:49] absolute but I was thinking out this
[55:52] here here in Hebrews that if it was
[55:55] impossible to please God without faith
[55:59] what is it tonight if we had Faith cuz
[56:03] there's thousands of promises in the
[56:06] word of God and there's thousands thank
[56:09] you Lord of promises laying there
[56:13] brother Ben you care to get my Bible off
[56:14] the
[56:16] desk I've grabbed everything but my
[56:19] sword I'm in trouble
[56:21] tonight that's what these iPads will do
[56:23] for
[56:25] us and you know that's the first mistake
[56:27] I ever made in my life you believe
[56:32] that thank you brother Ben now I'm
[56:36] ready bud I don't even I've got
[56:39] everything in my notes but I don't like
[56:40] to come out here without my Bible and U
[56:43] I was getting excited back there hearing
[56:45] songs of Zion and and uh pacing in the
[56:48] spirit back there if you want to call
[56:50] that brother
[56:51] Ben but there's thousands of that's what
[56:54] made me thr I just going to lift my
[56:55] Bible up said there's thousand of
[56:57] promises in the Bible amen that's laying
[56:59] here for believer but without a way to
[57:02] release the power to bring it on the
[57:04] scene what happened what what good would
[57:07] it be yeah if we didn't have something
[57:09] that could release a power to bring it
[57:12] on the scene for you and I tonight and
[57:14] just like that day that night rather the
[57:17] in Egypt you know there was something
[57:19] there was a power release when they
[57:21] applied the token upon their their homes
[57:24] that no matter how hard the Death Angel
[57:26] tried he could never penetrate what a
[57:29] Believer did he obeyed his obedience to
[57:33] the word of God the voice of a king
[57:35] there was power behind that voice and
[57:38] there was a liberty behind applying the
[57:41] token of the doorpost of their homes
[57:43] there was a peace inside of that home
[57:46] that passeth all understanding and and I
[57:49] I thought about these things as I was
[57:51] thinking on these lines of of releasing
[57:54] of power a been what good would it be to
[57:57] have a God that gave all promises but he
[58:00] didn't give a way for a Believer to
[58:03] obtain
[58:05] them amen and I'm a firm believer
[58:08] tonight amen that for me and my house
[58:11] we're going to praise the Lord and amen
[58:14] if I come to church I want to praise the
[58:15] Lord amen if we take worship out of the
[58:18] church amen what kind of church do we

[58:40] what other churches says but they come
[58:43] with one mission is bring the fire of
[58:45] God down in the Tabernacle once again

[1:33:25] sister Janie with a loud
[1:33:28] voice they were worshipers G they was
[1:33:32] sounding with a loud voice they was
[1:33:35] singing they was worshiping they was
[1:33:38] praising sounds like a good Revival
[1:33:40] doesn't it sounds like a good meeting
[1:33:42] when everybody uh is getting ready for a
[1:33:45] great move of God a great brother being
[1:33:47] calls in a great man of God that's been
[1:33:49] preparing for months and our
[1:33:51] expectations is high yeah you know he he
[1:33:54] he don't have to say much and moves the
[1:33:56] people why because their expectation
[1:33:58] they're singing louder they're praising
[1:34:00] louder they're worshiping louder they're
[1:34:03] singing
[1:34:05] louder I just believe this was that type
[1:34:07] of Revival they was down there expecting
[1:34:10] God to do great things and they begin to
[1:34:12] sing and they begin to praise their God
[1:34:16] oh yes and the Bible says sister Jackie
[1:34:19] that they came down God came down and
[1:34:22] set ambushments
[1:34:24] against Mount seir and Moab and the
[1:34:26] children of Aon and yeah Ma they turned
[1:34:30] on one another they begin to destroy one
[1:34:33] another yes sir and this is this is my
[1:34:36] interpretation of it take it or leave it

[1:34:42] I thought they was down there
[1:34:44] and they heard a lot of noise going down
[1:34:46] there brother Ben but I just don't
[1:34:48] believe they could see it just like it

[1:34:52] of things going on but they didn't know
[1:34:53] exactly what was going on down there
[1:34:55] what is the Lord doing what there a walk
[1:34:58] of faith and and then some times elaps
[1:35:04] and Judah came down there and cl climbed
[1:35:07] up the wat
[1:35:08] Tower come on and Judah begin to look
[1:35:13] over and there was dead bodies laying

[1:37:51] by the time I'm done today I'm going to

[1:37:55] pizza and then when he got to the IR and
[1:37:57] so Mark he said you know what I'm
[1:37:59] probably looking like two
[1:38:04] pizzas but brother an would tell a story
[1:38:07] well it was actually uh something that
[1:38:09] happened in his life so there a
[1:38:10] testimony on the wings of a snow white
[1:38:12] dove and he begin to tell about the time
[1:38:15] I'm going to make this long story short
[1:38:17] because it's a powerful story and he
[1:38:19] begin but Sam he begins to tell how that
[1:38:21] the spirit of the Lord came to remember
[1:38:24] he had that stomach problem he wore for
[1:38:26] many many many years and he said you
[1:38:29] know and he he talk about that squirrel
[1:38:31] how he would jump down his mouth and
[1:38:33] tear his stomach up and the spirit of
[1:38:35] the Lord told him to go to the cattle in
[1:38:36] the mountains when he got to the the top
[1:38:39] and the spirit of the Lord told him to
[1:38:40] stop and he stopped and I'm paraphrasing
[1:38:43] and he said when he stopped and and he
[1:38:46] seen a squirrel den or something and he
[1:38:49] said all of a sudden out of that
[1:38:51] squirrel den here come that gray ugly
[1:38:52] looking squirrel he came down and came
[1:38:55] and jumped and hit his chest this time I
[1:38:59] hitting his mouth bounced off his chest
[1:39:01] hit some
[1:39:04] Cactus and the spirit of Lord wheed out
[1:39:07] of there and said your enemy is dead and

[1:39:45] him by prophetic gift and told him says
