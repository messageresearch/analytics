[33:23] foreign
[33:27] first Thessalonians chapter 5
[33:30] and verse 5.
[33:33] first Thessalonians 5 5 and then we'll
[33:36] read down through verse 8.
[33:40] portion of what we read this morning
[33:45] he says you are all the children of
[33:47] light
[33:48] and the children of the day
[33:51] we are not of the night nor of Darkness
[33:55] therefore let us not sleep
[33:58] he's saying it's pretty simple isn't it
[34:00] but he's saying we don't sleep because
[34:01] it's not night time
[34:03] we're not going to sleep spiritually he
[34:06] said let's do others but let us watch
[34:08] and be sober
[34:09] for they that sleep sleep in the night
[34:12] and they'd be drunken or Drunken In the
[34:15] Night
[34:15] let us who are of the day and again as
[34:19] we talked about this morning we're not
[34:21] just in the day we're not just we don't
[34:24] just see the day we are of the day we
[34:27] are the sons of Light the sons of the
[34:29] day be sober putting on the breastplate
[34:32] of faith and love and for a helmet the
[34:35] hope of Salvation I pray the Lord would
[34:38] add his Blessing to the word you may be
[34:40] seated this evening
[34:44] we left off this morning the the mighty
[34:47] angel of Revelation 10 has come down and
[34:51] and put his his feet one foot on the
[34:54] land and one on the seat and it
[34:57] signifies that all things someone say
[34:59] all things
[35:01] all things are under the authority of
[35:04] the word he is the word in Revelation 19
[35:09] it tells of how when he comes back as
[35:12] King in the third coming as he comes at
[35:15] the end of the tribulation period he
[35:18] said I saw heaven opened and behold a
[35:21] white horse and he that set upon him was
[35:23] called faithful and true or are is he
[35:26] faithful today is he true there's no
[35:29] songs that I call you Faithful and
[35:31] that's what we want to say tonight he
[35:33] said he was called faithful and true and
[35:35] righteousness he just judge and make war
[35:39] his eyes were as a flame of fire on his
[35:42] head were many crowns and he had a name
[35:44] written that no man knew but he himself
[35:46] and he was clothed with the vesture
[35:49] dipped in Blood and his name is called
[35:51] the word of God he's identified by being
[35:56] the word of God Amen and the armies
[35:59] which were in heaven followed him upon
[36:01] light horses clothed in fine linen white
[36:04] and clean so he shows himself as in this
[36:07] hour as the one who has supreme
[36:10] authority supreme authority
[36:15] but the realm says this about the the
[36:17] cloud that came that was more it was a
[36:21] sign of something a symbol of something
[36:23] the cloud picture that we have was more
[36:25] just saying well God is with his Prophet
[36:27] well that's true but that's not what it
[36:29] was all about it was Christ presenting
[36:32] himself to this age and it really
[36:35] doesn't matter how the cloud got up
[36:37] there although I believe it was the
[36:38] supernatural Cloud but it really doesn't
[36:40] matter whose face was in the cloud it
[36:43] was Christ and and he turned it to the
[36:46] right and the spirit told him to turn it
[36:48] to the right when he did he actually saw
[36:50] the face of Jesus Christ in the cloud
[36:53] and so the cloud then he said there he
[36:56] is with them Angels the message which
[36:58] was the seven breaking of them Seven
[37:01] Seals that revealed serpent seed and all
[37:03] these things here he says it shows it is
[37:06] his very covering it's his supreme
[37:09] authority
[37:11] supreme authority
[37:13] he is supreme and he is wigged or
[37:16] covered the Bible said he changed his
[37:18] countenance he changed himself in the
[37:21] word the word immoral Faith he said
[37:23] which means a Greek actor that plays
[37:24] many parts today is one thing and the
[37:26] next ACT is something else so in this
[37:29] hour he changed his mask
[37:33] he said he was God the father and one
[37:35] act God the son in another act and God
[37:37] the Holy Ghost in This act he said say
[37:39] see there he is his word is still
[37:42] Supreme
[37:43] Hallelujah he said we're living in the
[37:46] last days so he is the supreme authority
[37:49] of Our Lives could we could we
[37:52] acknowledge that today that he is the
[37:55] word and he is the supreme authority of
[37:59] Our Lives that means that he is has
[38:01] jurisdiction over every area of our life
[38:05] I I I'm working to preach tonight you're
[38:07] gonna have to preach with me he he has
[38:09] jurisdiction what that means is you know
[38:12] if you've got a traffic ticket you might
[38:14] have to find out what jurisdiction it
[38:16] was in to find out where to pay the
[38:18] ticket
[38:18] right you might have to go to Cherokee
[38:20] Village or he probably did if you drove
[38:22] through there you probably got a ticket
[38:23] but you might have to go wherever it is

[38:42] what's he saying he's saying I have
[38:44] jurisdiction over every area

[38:49] sea and he said I've got jurisdiction

[39:38] to be an overcomer
[39:41] hey man do you believe that today
[39:44] the Bible says as many as received him
[39:46] he gave power to become the sons of God
[39:50] even to them that believe on his name so
[39:53] he delegates his authority to you in
[39:55] Matthew 18 and 18 where verily I say
[39:57] unto you whatsoever you shall bind on
[39:59] Earth shall you be bound in heaven shall
[40:01] be bound in heaven whatsoever you shall
[40:02] loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven
[40:04] don't tell me you can't live a Christian
[40:06] Life
[40:07] don't tell me it's too hard it's not too
[40:10] hard why because he's given you the
[40:13] authority to do that
[40:16] he said again I say unto you if two of
[40:17] you shall agree on Earth that's touching
[40:19] anything someone say anything
[40:22] how many have to get you to repeat it
[40:24] all so you'll hear it
[40:25] but he said if two of you shall agree on
[40:27] us touching anything that they shall ask
[40:29] it should be done for them of My Father
[40:31] which is in heaven
[40:33] forward two or three we got more than
[40:35] that here tonight we're two or three are
[40:37] gathered together in my name there am I
[40:40] in the midst of them who the authority
[40:43] of the word
[40:44] the final judge
[40:48] Hallelujah
[40:50] that's good a winner doesn't have to
[40:52] does not have to worry about the judge
[40:55] he knows he won
[40:57] so if he's got a fair judge he's got a
[40:59] fair person at the end that's going to
[41:02] judge the results listen you and I have
[41:04] already won by the cross of Calvary
[41:06] we've already won so the judge comes in
[41:09] this hour to tell us you're a winner
[41:13] Hallelujah
[41:16] and so he separates the good from the
[41:18] bad and and the elect and the non-elect
[41:21] and he comes in rightly divides the word
[41:23] let's see how we live in
[41:26] so I want to ask you this morning
[41:28] this evening rather what is under your
[41:31] feet
[41:32] what is under your feet
[41:34] remember you're the body of Christ and
[41:37] the mighty angel had his feet on the
[41:40] land and on the seat
[41:41] now first and we alluded to it this
[41:44] morning but I want to dig into it a
[41:46] little bit and I won't hold you that
[41:47] long this afternoon
[41:48] but the first thing is you have
[41:50] authority over apostate religion
[41:53] you have authority over apostate
[41:55] religion look at Revelation Chapter 13
[41:58] Verse 1. we'll just go through it look
[42:00] it up in the in your Bible if you have
[42:01] one on your phone if you brought if
[42:03] that's the way you look at your Bible
[42:04] but look it up so you can so you'll have
[42:07] it there Revelation 13 and 1.
[42:15] excuse me
[42:17] he said I stood upon the sand of the sea
[42:20] and saw a beast rise up out of the sea
[42:23] having seven heads
[42:28] and I'm not sick I just don't have a
[42:30] voice
[42:31] I might jump with a Joe I talk too much
[42:33] today
[42:35] me and brother Joe both don't have a
[42:36] voice for the same reason
[42:40] now he said having seven heads and ten
[42:43] horns so a beast rise up notice out of
[42:45] the sea
[42:46] upon his horns ten crowns upon his
[42:49] head's the name of blasphemy and the
[42:52] Beast which I saw was likened to a
[42:53] leopard and his feet were as the feet of
[42:55] a bear and his mouth is the mouth of a
[42:57] lion and the dragon gave him his power
[42:58] and seat and great Authority we could go
[43:00] into what that Beast was and how in
[43:03] verse three he said I saw one of his
[43:04] heads as it were wounded to death his
[43:07] deadly wound was healed Pagan Rome
[43:09] became papal Rome
[43:11] all the world wandered after the Beast
[43:14] and even the ten crowns are the ten
[43:16] horns all those things that that went
[43:19] from the went into the Holy Roman Empire
[43:21] and all that still exists today
[43:24] in the form of the European Union
[43:26] and now and but it's just a it's a
[43:29] successor of that
[43:30] and but it's still a Roman system
[43:33] now he said who and they worshiped the
[43:35] dragon which gave power to the Beast and
[43:37] they worshiped the Beast saying who is
[43:39] likened to the Beast who is able to make
[43:41] war with him
[43:42] there was giving to him a mouth speaking
[43:44] great things and blasphemy he said power
[43:46] was given unto him to continue 42 months
[43:49] and he opened his mouth and blasphemy
[43:51] against God to blaspheme his name in his
[43:54] Tabernacle and then the dwell in heaven
[43:56] it was given unto him to make war with
[43:57] the Saints and to overcome them power
[44:00] was given him over all kindreds and tons
[44:02] and Nations and all that dwell upon the
[44:04] Earth shall worship Him whose names are
[44:07] not written in the Book of Life of the
[44:09] lamb slain from the foundation of the
[44:11] world he said If any man have an ear let
[44:13] him here he that lead us into captivity
[44:15] shall go into captivity either kill us
[44:17] with the sword must be killed with the
[44:19] sword here's the patience of the faith
[44:21] of the Saints but listen to me if you're
[44:23] the children of the day
[44:25] if you have heard the voice from heaven
[44:27] this Beast
[44:29] is under your feet
[44:32] Hallelujah the apostate religion of the
[44:35] end time is not going to overcome you
[44:39] it will not overcome those who have
[44:42] their name written in the Lamb's Book of
[44:44] Life
[44:46] who will not be deceived
[44:50] oh that that's not just me saying that
[44:53] it's not a hopeful statement but the the
[44:56] message of the hour the mighty angel
[44:58] came down and spoke through a prophet
[45:01] and said you cannot be deceived
[45:04] the word of the hour says you are the
[45:06] electrical you cannot be deceived
[45:13] watch
[45:14] said for their shall arise false Christ
[45:16] and that doesn't mean you won't be
[45:18] misled from time to time but he'll
[45:20] always correct you yes
[45:22] and watch he said there shall arise
[45:24] false Christ and false prophets shall
[45:27] show great signs and wonders and so much
[45:29] that if it were possible I love that
[45:32] they shall deceive the very elect
[45:34] 13 and 22 for false Christ and false
[45:37] prophets shall rise and shall show signs
[45:39] and wonders to seduce if it were
[45:42] possible
[45:44] even the elect
[45:45] it's not possible
[45:47] oh thank God for that I thank God for
[45:51] that it's not me that keeps me sane it's
[45:54] not me that gets me straight on the word
[45:56] but it's so it's coming under the
[45:58] influence of the mighty angel in our day
[46:00] coming under the influence of the word
[46:02] in her day this this message is more
[46:04] than just a prophet
[46:05] this message is more than just a man
[46:08] it's more than just somebody standing
[46:10] there and speaking things but it's God
[46:12] himself came down and showed himself to
[46:15] be alive
[46:16] yes
[46:18] to give us Authority
[46:21] isn't that wonderful
[46:23] you won't be deceived
[46:25] he said I heard Billy Graham say the
[46:27] other day in a message he said the
[46:28] elected has already deceived he said no
[46:29] no the election ain't going to be
[46:31] deceived no they won't be
[46:33] no church members will come on now but
[46:36] not the elected
[46:37] they was chosen from the foundation of
[46:40] the world
[46:41] they cannot be deceived
[46:44] oh aren't you glad for the word of the
[46:46] hour
[46:47] listen to what he's telling you he said
[46:49] you can't commit adultery you're already
[46:51] pregnant he's talking spiritually now
[46:53] you can't commit adultery you're already
[46:55] pregnant or he can't take a hold the
[46:58] womb of life is close to anything else
[47:00] you're already his by predestination
[47:03] that seed has come to life oh man that
[47:06] wonderful brother JT one day God got a
[47:09] hold of you and the womb was closed up
[47:11] yeah okay
[47:12] hallelujah oh that makes me feel good
[47:14] tonight the womb was closed up with
[47:16] Isaac you can't even eat anything else
[47:22] that's right but the womb has been
[47:24] closed up
[47:25] you may come through your mind but it
[47:27] can't stay there
[47:31] Hallelujah you're already his by
[47:34] predestination that seed has come to
[47:36] life no world can get in
[47:39] yeah I'm so glad for that today
[47:42] John 17 and 6 Jesus said of those his
[47:45] disciples he said I manifested thy name
[47:48] notice how positive this is I haven't
[47:51] manifested thy name unto the men which
[47:53] thou gavest me out of the world thine
[47:55] they were and thou gave us them me and
[47:59] they have kept Thy Word
[48:01] he said now they have known that all
[48:04] things whatsoever thou has given me are
[48:06] of Thee
[48:08] for I have given unto them The Words
[48:10] which thou gave us me I've given unto
[48:13] them the words what was it the entrance
[48:15] of light the entrance of the word it's
[48:17] the entrance of light
[48:19] I have given unto them The Words which
[48:21] thou gave us me and they have received
[48:23] them and have known surely that I come
[48:25] out from thee and they have believed
[48:26] that thou did send me
[48:29] he said I pray for them
[48:31] oh I love that
[48:33] I pray not for the world
[48:35] but for them which thou has given me
[48:38] for their time
[48:40] and all mine are thine and thine are
[48:43] mine and I am glorified in them
[48:45] now I am no more in the world but these
[48:48] are in the world and I come to thee Holy
[48:50] Father keep through thine own name Those
[48:53] whom thou has given me that they may be
[48:55] one as we are
[48:57] he said while I was with them in the
[48:58] world I kept them in my thy name those
[49:01] that thou gave us me I have kept
[49:06] think about that for a minute
[49:09] I know I'm hard to listen to tonight it
[49:11] hurts my ears too but
[49:14] oh my I have kept them
[49:18] through thine own name
[49:20] oh isn't that a wonderful testimony I
[49:23] have kept them he says and none of them
[49:25] is lost but the son of perdition
[49:29] that the scripture might be fulfilled
[49:32] now that's under your feet
[49:35] you don't have to worry about it
[49:38] and I'll say this why is why waste your
[49:41] time
[49:41] looking at everything on the internet
[49:43] and and looking at all these others see
[49:45] people just looking around at all the
[49:47] different theologies that are out there
[49:49] and stuff why waste your time with it
[49:52] I don't say you can be deceived by it I
[49:54] say why wasted your time doing it the
[49:57] scene is already entered into the womb
[50:00] and it's produced fruit in your life
[50:02] why would you why would you waste your
[50:04] time looking at all this other stuff
[50:06] the scripture the scripture has been
[50:09] fulfilled and you have been found to be
[50:12] the ones who cannot be deceived
[50:14] so now that is under his feet now watch
[50:17] the second thing let's look at back at
[50:19] Revelation 13 again
[50:22] Revelation 13 verse 11.
[50:25] he said I'll beheld another Beast coming
[50:27] up out of the Earth
[50:30] and he had two horns like a lamb and he
[50:33] spake as a dragon
[50:35] and he exercised this all I can't say
[50:37] that word he exercised
[50:39] all the power of the first Beast before
[50:42] him and causeth the Earth and then which
[50:44] dwell therein to worship the first Beast
[50:46] whose deadly wound was healed now this
[50:48] second beast comes up
[50:50] and the people perhaps thinking that
[50:52] they're worshiping something else but
[50:55] they're actually worshiping the first
[50:56] Beast
[50:58] they're actually worshiping a Roman
[51:00] Catholic system do you realize where we
[51:02] live
[51:03] right the people who worship this
[51:05] culture
[51:07] this American culture
[51:10] are actually worshiping the same Beast
[51:15] that was that come up out of the sea the
[51:17] same one or the same it's the same it's
[51:21] the same devil behind it now watch
[51:23] but it's it's a power the Beast is a
[51:26] power now he he exercised the power and
[51:30] he does great wonders verse 13 so that
[51:32] he make his fire come down from heaven
[51:33] on the earth in the side of men and
[51:35] deceiveth them that dwell on the Earth
[51:37] by the means of those Miracles which he
[51:39] had power to do in the sight of the
[51:40] Beast saying to them that dwell on the
[51:42] earth that they should make an image to
[51:43] the Beast which had the wound by a sword
[51:46] and did live
[51:47] so instead of worshiping the Beast they
[51:49] worship the image
[51:50] a Protestant denomination
[51:53] are you still with me now
[51:55] right and he said and he had power to
[51:57] give life unto the image of the Beast
[51:59] that the image of the Beast should both
[52:02] speak and caused it as many as would not
[52:04] worship the image of the Beast should be
[52:06] killed
[52:08] and he calls with all both small and
[52:09] great rich and poor free and bond to
[52:11] receive a mark in their right hand or in
[52:13] their foreheads that no man might buy or
[52:15] sell save he that had the Mark or the
[52:17] name of the Beast or the number of his
[52:19] name
[52:20] he said here is wisdom let him that hath
[52:23] understanding count the number of the
[52:26] Beast for it is the number of a man and
[52:29] his number is 603 score and six now
[52:32] watch
[52:34] brother Branham takes this
[52:36] 13. how many knows that brother Branham
[52:38] types the beasts to the or the America
[52:41] to the number 13.
[52:44] right he said it's in the 13th chapter
[52:45] of Revelations
[52:47] and he said it's a woman
[52:49] so he said 13 was was the 13th chapter
[52:52] of Revelation and it's a woman and it's
[52:55] America
[52:56] right so brother Brown types that to the
[52:58] culture there's more going on than what
[53:00] we realize
[53:02] right there's more going on than what we
[53:04] realize there there's a culture that we
[53:06] live in a world order which we call the
[53:09] cosmos which is the order of things the
[53:11] way things are done in the world there's
[53:14] a reason why we don't do things just
[53:16] because the world does them
[53:18] right because there's a world order
[53:19] there is a cosmos that that works and we
[53:23] have to work within that but we're not
[53:25] of that
[53:27] so now watch
[53:29] brother random talks about it he said
[53:31] now he said TV programs he said oh make
[53:33] female Flesh and Blood said they're not
[53:35] Gods they're not goddess but it sets
[53:38] America in exactly order to fulfill the
[53:40] scripture
[53:41] he said America's number is 13.
[53:43] America's Shrine is a woman always it's
[53:45] on her money it's on everything he said
[53:47] now it certainly brings him to a time
[53:49] that excuse me we're going to have an
[53:51] American goddess
[53:53] two not too far away he said you can see
[53:56] the handwriting on the wall
[53:58] he said look out on the street start
[54:00] downtown and just see it's a display of
[54:02] women how did they make themselves with
[54:03] clothes on that honest-to-goodness a
[54:05] woman not to be ashamed to stand in her
[54:06] dressing room like that amen
[54:09] he said walking out upon the street so
[54:11] tight little bitty clothes on out on
[54:13] these bathing beats just with these
[54:14] little he said bikinis or whatever they
[54:16] call it on such things as that and not
[54:19] knowing that in them is a spirit of evil
[54:21] when many of them singing choirs
[54:24] that's what Jesus said would take place
[54:26] but in them is a spirit of evil today
[54:29] they were these yoga pants in public and
[54:32] you think about it it don't make sense
[54:34] it's insanity
[54:36] public nudity
[54:38] we don't believe in public nudity
[54:41] right
[54:45] especially on somebody old enough to
[54:46] know better
[54:50] but now it's a spirit of evil on the age
[54:53] right and so now brother Brandon again
[54:55] he said so remember Jesus said as it was
[54:57] in the days of Sodom so shall it be at
[54:59] the coming of the son of man we see
[55:01] everybody will agree the world is in a
[55:03] Sodom condition
[55:04] he said I picked up a Los Angeles paper
[55:06] here not long ago and I think it's
[55:08] homosexuals on the increase of 20 or 30
[55:10] percent in Los Angeles each year
[55:12] increasing that much he said oh it's
[55:14] horrible and our government and
[55:15] everywhere everything just become a
[55:17] pervert he said that have we seen the
[55:19] Fulfillment of that
[55:23] well we've got a people in a high up in
[55:26] the government that uh 65 year old uh
[55:29] man that dresses like a woman
[55:31] and what's weird is it where's the dress
[55:35] and the women won't wear dresses
[55:41] now and so it says brother said the
[55:45] homosexuals on the increase in the
[55:47] government everywhere just become a
[55:48] pervert the whole thing the whole system
[55:50] church and everything else is perverted
[55:52] it's in a perverted age I want you to
[55:54] understand what you have authority over
[55:56] in this age
[55:58] right you don't have to be ruled by that
[56:04] first John 2 15 says love not the world
[56:06] neither the things are in the world
[56:07] that's the the cosmos the way the world
[56:10] does things the world order they do
[56:12] things a certain way we are not to be
[56:14] ruled by that just because everybody
[56:16] else does something doesn't go to church
[56:19] don't mean we have to not go to church
[56:21] just because everybody else lets their
[56:23] kids dress a certain way or dresses
[56:25] themselves a certain way don't mean we
[56:27] have to we are not bound by that we have
[56:29] we have come under the influence of the
[56:31] mighty angel
[56:33] of the word in our day
[56:36] nation is ruled by feminism you see that
[56:39] today
[56:40] I think I I don't have to repeat even of
[56:42] what a prophet said to say that you can
[56:44] see that just by looking out there
[56:47] it's ruled by feminism
[56:49] it's become so far now until it's turned
[56:51] in on itself
[56:53] towards feminism of men pretending to be
[56:55] women
[56:57] which doesn't make any sense
[57:01] it's women who want to be men and men
[57:03] who want to be women and it's not just a
[57:05] few places it's everywhere
[57:09] it's a power
[57:11] there's a power out there that's causing
[57:13] this
[57:14] you understand that it's it's not a
[57:16] little thing why in the world would sane
[57:19] people
[57:20] even worldly people why would you think
[57:22] they would do that why would they give
[57:24] in to that it's a power
[57:27] it's a power and it'll eventually take
[57:30] over completely
[57:32] now watch
[57:35] um brother Branham in the 20s and 30s he
[57:37] saw the flapper movement raise up and he
[57:39] said it one time he got up and showed
[57:40] his church he said this is the god of
[57:42] America
[57:43] the goddess of America
[57:45] and he preached as a sermon later on he
[57:47] calls it painted face Jezebel
[57:49] now he'd have to call it painted face
[57:51] Ahab
[57:55] it's a ridiculous age Church
[57:58] aren't you glad you got power over that
[58:04] we were and just being real with you
[58:07] tonight we were excited when Disney plus
[58:09] come out a few years ago because we
[58:10] thought well all the old cartoons would
[58:11] be on there and stuff we watched we were
[58:13] a kid we thought that'd be good that's
[58:14] not what it is exactly
[58:16] at least that's not only what it is
[58:19] we thought it'd be a source of clean
[58:21] cartoons almost you know what there was
[58:23] a their uh president of Disney uh was
[58:27] somebody by the name of Carrie Burke a
[58:29] couple years ago and she made a
[58:31] statement she said their goal was to
[58:34] have 50 of their characters to be lgbtq
[58:40] 50 percent
[58:42] was their stated goal as a company
[58:46] it's why would you do that 50 of the
[58:49] people aren't that way but they will be
[58:50] if they keep it up
[58:53] gifts shows that we let our kids watch
[58:55] uh when or maybe we watched when we were
[58:58] kids and they revive them you know and
[59:00] they come up in DuckTales and stuff like
[59:02] that Transformers
[59:05] got homosexuality on it
[59:08] I saw the other day where a famous
[59:09] Hollywood actress she come out and said
[59:11] all my children are queer
[59:13] wonder what the odds of that are
[59:17] I don't mean to be be harsh today but
[59:20] but we need to know what time we're
[59:21] living in
[59:23] this is the darkness that's out there
[59:25] every corporation is bowed down to it
[59:28] you're about to have pride month I get
[59:30] so sick of the media during this time of
[59:32] year because they spend a whole month

[59:39] group I saw or even Ford put out an ad
[59:41] with two trucks and I made one of the
[59:43] trucks a pride truck

[59:50] boycotting this and you know I've seen a
[59:52] bunch of Christians come out and boycott

[1:00:03] drinking in the first place
[1:00:07] wouldn't do my us much good the boy
[1:00:08] caught it
[1:00:12] but every political party
[1:00:15] all of them have bowed down to it
[1:00:19] every denomination is bowed down to it
[1:00:21] every organization oh there's a few that
[1:00:24] on the friends just try to fight it but
[1:00:26] it's overwhelming
[1:00:29] but you don't why don't you because

[1:01:39] it's time to recognize what hour we're
[1:01:41] living in
[1:01:43] he heard a voice from Heaven saying come
[1:01:44] out
[1:01:46] there will be
[1:01:48] an overcomer in this age
[1:01:50] let me believe that today
[1:01:52] somebody's got to do it
[1:01:54] right somebody's got to preach it
[1:01:57] somebody's got to live it don't you want
[1:01:59] to be one that lives it don't you be one
[1:02:01] want to be one if you're a preacher
[1:02:03] you'll preach it you said but if you're
[1:02:04] if you're not a preacher live your
[1:02:06] sermon
[1:02:07] amen let you be not partaker of her
[1:02:10] plagues he said I heard another voice
[1:02:11] from Heaven come out from her my people
[1:02:13] be an upper taker of her plagues there
[1:02:16] will be an overcomer the Bible says you
[1:02:18] are of God Little Children You are of
[1:02:20] God your children of the day he said
[1:02:22] have overcome them because greater is he
[1:02:24] that is in you than he that is in the
[1:02:26] world
[1:02:30] you're not helpless
[1:02:32] aren't you glad for that
[1:02:34] we're not victims
[1:02:37] we're not just Sitting Waiting on the
[1:02:39] World to come crashing down around us
[1:02:40] we've been given Authority
[1:02:43] the world may come crashing down but it
[1:02:45] will not come nigh our dwelling
[1:02:48] are you hearing me today
[1:02:49] Jericho is going to come crashing down
[1:02:52] but it will not crash down on you
[1:02:55] the world's gone crazy but you don't
[1:02:57] have to
[1:02:59] you've heard a voice from heaven
[1:03:02] you're not helpless you've been given
[1:03:04] Authority
[1:03:05] authority over the end time you'd be
[1:03:07] surprised and shocked how that thinking
[1:03:09] filters its way infiltrates anything
[1:03:11] into message circles
[1:03:13] the culture of this day you get young
[1:03:16] people that'll stream a certain sermon
[1:03:19] at a certain time and yet they're
[1:03:21] serving the devil yeah
[1:03:23] and have perversion everything else in
[1:03:25] their life but they think they're okay
[1:03:27] and and it's just it's just the spirit
[1:03:30] of the age
[1:03:31] But You Heard a Voice from heaven
[1:03:35] people go to church and shout and dance
[1:03:37] and everything else but I want to know
[1:03:39] that you overcome the spirit of the age
[1:03:41] that's what we need Church well it's
[1:03:43] good to have shouting and dancing but we
[1:03:45] need to know that there's an overcomer
[1:03:46] somewhere there's a young person
[1:03:48] somewhere who overcomes
[1:03:51] there's an elder somewhere that
[1:03:53] overcomes
[1:03:57] you're not helpless
[1:03:59] Authority
[1:04:00] Daniel 11 says such as do weekly against
[1:04:03] the Covenant shall he corrupt by
[1:04:04] flatteries but the people that do know
[1:04:07] their God shall be strong and do
[1:04:09] exploits if you go back to the original
[1:04:11] I preached on that one time if you go
[1:04:12] back in the original that word exploits
[1:04:14] is actually in italics in the King James
[1:04:16] version because it actually said they
[1:04:18] will be strong and they will do what
[1:04:20] that means is that they will actually
[1:04:21] perform what they were intended to
[1:04:23] perform they'll be a husband they'll be
[1:04:25] a wife they'll be a preacher there'll be
[1:04:27] somebody who's what God called him to be
[1:04:30] they will be strong and they will do the
[1:04:33] things and nobody thought they could do
[1:04:36] I want you to notice something to have
[1:04:38] five more minutes and then we'll close
[1:04:42] there's two places in Revelation that
[1:04:43] talk about a sea of glass if you ever
[1:04:45] notice that
[1:04:46] Revelation chapter 4 and verse 6.
[1:04:49] it said before the throne there was a
[1:04:50] sea of glass like under Crystal
[1:04:53] in in other words completely transparent
[1:04:56] oh I love that
[1:04:57] in the midst of the throne and round
[1:04:59] about The Throne are four beasts full of
[1:05:00] eyes before and behind but the brand of
[1:05:02] like exists to the the Brazen sea in the
[1:05:04] temple it was a brass sea and it was a
[1:05:07] place of judgment brass spoke of
[1:05:09] judgment
[1:05:10] he made a brass serpent the sin was the
[1:05:13] sign of sin already judged I'm skipping
[1:05:15] ahead here on on the quotes he said
[1:05:17] brass represented Divine judgment even
[1:05:19] Elijah looked at the sky and said the
[1:05:21] sky looks like brass Divine judgment
[1:05:23] Upon A rejected Nation
[1:05:25] he said and now we're at the labor
[1:05:28] and you notice this in Revelation
[1:05:30] chapter 4 the slaver these people who
[1:05:33] were standing there oh my this slaver
[1:05:36] was empty and was as clear as Crystal
[1:05:41] why this church had already been
[1:05:43] redeemed
[1:05:46] somebody overcomes
[1:05:48] in this age there was a sea of glass
[1:05:51] they were standing on that was clean
[1:05:55] Hallelujah
[1:05:56] your brother he said brother man you
[1:05:58] don't know what I've done in the past
[1:05:59] but the sea of glass that you're
[1:06:01] standing on when you come under the
[1:06:03] influence of this Mighty Angel when you
[1:06:04] hear the voice of predestination the sea
[1:06:07] of glass is completely clean
[1:06:11] Lord of God
[1:06:14] now look
[1:06:15] there's another
[1:06:17] see blast but look but look at this one
[1:06:19] real quick but the Miranda says we're at
[1:06:21] the labor as clear as Crystal church
[1:06:22] have been redeemed he says this
[1:06:24] invisible Union you're standing
[1:06:25] completely you never sinned at the first
[1:06:27] place God don't even know nothing it's
[1:06:29] in the sea of forgetfulness you never
[1:06:31] did do it you were accused of it by the
[1:06:33] accuser but really from the beginning
[1:06:34] you were predestinator to be a son and
[1:06:36] daughter of God you're standing there
[1:06:38] washed your old book of divorcement is
[1:06:39] put away it's dead absolutely out of
[1:06:41] existence even in the mind of God
[1:06:45] crystal clear
[1:06:48] haven't you ever wanted to be like that
[1:06:49] with God you are
[1:06:51] in this hour you're an overcomer
[1:06:53] by the blood of the Lamb
[1:06:55] look
[1:06:57] Revelation 15 2 another sea of glass I
[1:07:00] saw as it were a sea of glass mingled
[1:07:01] with fire
[1:07:03] and then the god in the victory over the
[1:07:04] Beast over its image over his Mark over
[1:07:06] the number of his name stand on the sea
[1:07:08] of glass having the hearts of God
[1:07:10] but Branham taught us this was the this
[1:07:12] was the foolish virgin or the church
[1:07:15] that goes to the tribulation
[1:07:18] brother Brandon says how do we come he
[1:07:19] said we got to come this Gentile Church
[1:07:21] to this word sea of glass water of the
[1:07:25] word
[1:07:26] he said listen to this we have to
[1:07:28] recognize the word the way it's written
[1:07:32] foreign
[1:07:34] you realize you can't be purged by a
[1:07:36] seed of discrepancy
[1:07:38] but you've got to recognize the word the
[1:07:40] way it's written and come to it he said
[1:07:42] even those even those foolish virgin
[1:07:44] have to recognize the word
[1:07:46] and come to it
[1:07:49] God recognize the word the way it's
[1:07:51] written not how you can twist it
[1:07:53] not how I can twist it to make it fit
[1:07:55] our own theology but the way it's
[1:07:57] written yeah
[1:07:59] yeah then the sacrifice is received and
[1:08:01] filled with the holy ghost from the
[1:08:02] inside shining through the light of that
[1:08:03] age
[1:08:04] and and in Revelation 15 3 said they
[1:08:07] sing a song of Moses the servant of God
[1:08:09] the song of the lamb saying great and
[1:08:10] marvelous how thy Works Lord God
[1:08:12] Almighty just endure thy ways Thou King
[1:08:14] of saints who shall not fear thee O Lord
[1:08:15] and glorify thy name for thou only
[1:08:17] aren't holy for all nations shall come
[1:08:19] and worship before thee for thy
[1:08:21] judgments are made manifest
[1:08:23] brother Brandon said they were Washed by
[1:08:24] the same Waters that you're being washed
[1:08:27] by now
[1:08:28] hearing the word
[1:08:31] you don't realize what it means to sit
[1:08:33] in the house of God
[1:08:35] and hear the word of God
[1:08:37] you don't realize what it means to get
[1:08:38] into the message of the hour when you
[1:08:40] hear the word you're being Washed by the
[1:08:42] Water of the word
[1:08:44] you're being washed now amen they were
[1:08:48] Washed by the same Waters that you're
[1:08:49] being washed by now hearing the word and
[1:08:52] the faith and power of Jesus Christ
[1:08:54] being the almighty he said it's the
[1:08:56] whole Revelation at the beginning the
[1:08:58] whole thing's wrapped up for the
[1:08:59] revelation of who Jesus Christ is that's
[1:09:01] why they said who shall not fear thee
[1:09:03] and glorify thy name amen
[1:09:05] now watch
[1:09:07] you are the overcomer
[1:09:10] how did you overcome
[1:09:13] well the Bible says by two things
[1:09:16] by the blood of the Lamb
[1:09:19] aren't you glad for the blood of the
[1:09:20] Lamb
[1:09:21] and the word of your testimony
[1:09:25] you're going to have a testimony you're
[1:09:28] going to have a testimony he's not going
[1:09:29] to leave you just with the blood of the
[1:09:31] lamb but you're going to have a
[1:09:32] testimony what's it going to be
[1:09:34] it's going to be I was an overcomer
[1:09:37] I was an overcomer my feet came over
[1:09:39] pornography My Feet stepped on stepped
[1:09:43] on the depression my feet stepped on
[1:09:45] sicknesses my feet overcame old age them
[1:09:49] one of these days sister Karen one of
[1:09:51] these days these bodies will be changed
[1:09:53] and we're gonna say my feet walked on
[1:09:55] all of these things why because I am the
[1:09:57] body of Jesus Christ I am Mrs Jesus
[1:10:00] Christ aren't you excited about that
[1:10:02] today doesn't that mean something to you
[1:10:04] doesn't that do something to your heart
[1:10:05] when you say I am the Bride of Jesus
[1:10:08] Christ I am Mrs Jesus Christ I overcame
[1:10:10] him by the blood of the lamb and by the
[1:10:13] word of Our Testimony
[1:10:16] Hallelujah by the word of my testimony I
[1:10:19] overcame my testimony
[1:10:21] yeah I love they love not their lives
[1:10:23] unto the death
[1:10:25] but the prayer until the musicians go
[1:10:27] ahead and come
[1:10:28] oh I wish I'd have had
[1:10:30] voice but God knows he makes every
[1:10:33] service
[1:10:34] just what it ought to be
[1:10:37] you got to stand in the water of the
[1:10:39] word to be washed
[1:10:41] and that what brother Branham tells us
[1:10:43] he said how are you going to be washed
[1:10:44] if you won't stand in the water of the
[1:10:47] word
[1:10:48] huh it's hard sometimes to come to
[1:10:50] church
[1:10:51] I know it is it's hard to
[1:10:53] drag your kids that you're being washed
[1:10:57] you've been washed
[1:10:59] by the water of the word
[1:11:01] so all the old ideas are going away all
[1:11:04] the old sins
[1:11:06] all the things of the past are all being
[1:11:07] washed away
[1:11:09] and as you are washed you're standing
[1:11:11] there with all things under your feet
[1:11:14] and you look down
[1:11:16] there's nothing there anymore just a sea
[1:11:18] of crystal
[1:11:22] God
[1:11:23] you say when brother Ben now
[1:11:29] those tribulation Saints have to stand
[1:11:31] on a sea of glass mingled with fire then
[1:11:33] because they have to be judged
[1:11:35] but you and I are judged here by the
[1:11:39] supreme authority
[1:11:40] by the wigged one who came down
[1:11:43] and you are saved now
[1:11:46] you are an overcomer now you stand now
[1:11:50] on a sea of glass at the opening of the
[1:11:52] seals at the word cut becoming flesh you
[1:11:55] stand on a sea of glass
[1:11:58] nothing there
[1:12:01] oh God
[1:12:03] I say thank you for making me your pride
[1:12:06] thank you for making me your child
[1:12:08] I'm standing there spotless Guiltless as
[1:12:11] though I never did it in the first place
[1:12:14] standing on the sea of glass
[1:12:17] with nothing between me
[1:12:19] and God
[1:12:21] you bow your head with me for just a
[1:12:23] moment
[1:12:24] you got to stand in the water of the
[1:12:26] word to be washed like that nothing else
[1:12:28] will do
[1:12:29] don't ever accept anything but the word
[1:12:31] of God
[1:12:33] it's the only thing that'll wash you
[1:12:34] it's the only thing that can change your
[1:12:36] life
[1:12:38] just acknowledge that it's true you're
[1:12:40] still a human being
[1:12:42] stand on a sea of glass
[1:12:44] you don't stand on a sea of glass
[1:12:46] mingled with fire because you've
[1:12:48] accepted the Judgment of God in your
[1:12:50] life you've been judged here so you
[1:12:52] don't have to be over there
[1:12:54] aren't you glad for that today
