Lord I pray you bless each one meet every need Lord if there's a need of sickness or healing Lord or need of of Salvation whatever it is I pray you'd meet that need tonight Lord I Thank you for all that you've done for us already I I thank you for healing Lord those that have been sick and and for helping brother Robert through this surgery and I pray that you continue to help him Lord and just bless each one we pray in Jesus name amen amen hallelujah love the Lord tonight it's good to be here in the house of the Lord Revelation 8 verse1 and we'll read just that verse and then Revelation 105 through 7 just standing here thinking how much I enjoy the music and the atmosphere that we have here in the church we ought to be thankful for what we have and what God has given us wonderful wonderful to be able to come and just relax in the presence of the Lord and Worship the Lord with all of our heart brother Paul Seymour it's good to see you back there my goodness you don't even look like you broke your leg we're not going to tell him to break a leg when we see him again next time but but thank you for being here tonight brother Paul and and I know uh different ones are watching and brother Joel's traveling brother Robert's in the hospital I went and saw him this morning and he's doing just as good as could be expected and and uh just seem to be at peace and doing good and maybe get to uh at least get out of the hospital hospital tomorrow so that'd be be good if we'll just pray that way Revelation 81 when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour and then Revelation 10:5 and the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the Earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created Heaven and the things that there in are and the earth and the things that there in are and the Sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets pray the Lord would add his Blessing to the word you may be seated I want to continue talking to you about the seventh seal to tonight uh I I would say that all of us uh would uh say that we live at the time of the end I think I could have agreement on that tonight I think that the world can even see that you can see time speeding up I've even watched uh nominal preachers denominational preachers that will uh recognize the hour that we're living in recognize time has sped up and and we're right at the close of things if you look at the wars and rumors of War they just keep coming faster and faster if you look at earthquakes if you look at uh pandemics if you look at things that are happening all over the world it ought to we ought to be awake and and recognize where we're at I don't know if you if you know it but when you say that we live at the time of the end you're saying that we live at the opening of the book sealed with Seven Seals that we're living in the time if we could say it this way of the opening the breaking of the seventh seal because then the book is open and so brother Brandon puts it this way he said we must remember that this seventh seal is the end of time of all things the end of all things he said that's right the things written in the seven sealed book sealed up of the Plan of Redemption because this book is the Plan of Redemption this is how God is going to redeem his elect from the Earth both the Jews and Gentiles so the entire Plan of Redemption is written in the scripture and then it was sealed up with Seven Seals and now that sealed book has been open and so the seventh seal is the end that's it of all things and it's like you've been sitting through the movie and you've watched it to the end and and the the the the letters have shown on it the end the seventh seal the end oh I think we're living at that time time and I think it ought to do our hearts good if you know where you're going and and you know in whom you have believed and you know that that you're you're a Believer the message of the hour it ought to it ought to do something for you to think that we're living at the end but I'm ready for it to be the end we're living at the end of all things but I know where I'm going I know I know my family's going to be there I know I'm going to be there it ought to give us hope today and as we as we get into these things the brand said it's the end it every bit ends it's the end it's the end of the struggling world it's the end of struggling nature it's the end of everything yeah he said in there it's the end of the trumpets it's the end of the vials it's the end of the Earth it's even the end of time now brother random takes that from Revelation chapter 10 and we're going to go there and deal with Revelation chapter 10 uh tonight uh uh for for a while and and kind of see where he took that from because he said it's the end of time you can't just say that uh it has to have been written in the scripture and it was Revelation chapter 10 we find that uh we we had a book that was sealed with Seven Seals and the lamb took the book in Revelation chapter five and open the seals in chapter 6 and chapter 8 but here is in in chapter 10 he said I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire now this is Christ he he comes from heaven so he's not an Earthly messenger this is Christ and I'll say this to you tonight this message has to be more than just William brandom it's got to be Christ you you have to be able to see a mighty angel coming down in our day amen I'm so glad that I'm so glad that he introduced me to Jesus Christ I I want to get ahead of myself so badly in these things but we're just going to have to get a little bit into it tonight and been studying these things and I just it just overwhelms me with the the grace that he's shown Us in this hour and I just want to live up to it I I just want to be that bride that's one with the groom I I just want to represent him in the age that I live in he comes from Heaven he's wrapped with a cloud I know some of you when we start preaching on these things you're sitting there thinking there he goes again but it matters to you and I believe we can make it simple enough and in fact I think what happens many times we just make it complicated but if we just preach the word I think many times it's simple enough the Bible said a fool won't air there in I think it's simple enough we can all understand it even our children and young people can understand and so there's something here for you tonight just just get a hold of it feed on it feed on it let it not not my words but the words of a prophet the words of the scripture let's just feed on this teaching now tonight now he's wrapped with a cloud and and we know that when he comes at his third coming he comes with clouds in Revelation 1:7 remember there's three comings of Christ his first coming when he come to the Earth his second coming is a Rapture his third coming as when comes and sets his or steps on the Mount of Olives this is his third comings we know that because it says every eye shall see him he said but he cometh with clouds and and every eye shall see him now we know on Mount Transfiguration there was a cloud in Mark 9:2 after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter and James and John and leadth them up into a high mountain apart by themselves and he was transfigured before them we could say he was separating the bride from the church and he and he brought them up into Mount Transfiguration and when he leads them up into a high mountain he was transfigured oh my I trust I'm going to have to stop I'm gonna get in trouble tonight but this message has to transfigure Christ to us right it has to change our view of Jesus Christ we have to see him as deity we got to see him as present we got to see him as as being real as being the same yesterday today and forever it's this message that does that for us so his reignment become exceed shining exceeding white as snow so it's no Fuller on Earth can WIP them and there appeared unto them Elias with Moses and they were talking with Jesus and Peter being being Peter he had to say something and he said to Jesus Master it's good for us to be here and let us make three Tabernacles one for thee and one for Moses and one for Elias he said we might as well just set up a a little denomination he said for he wished not what to say for they were sore afraid and there was a cloud that overshadowed them and a voice come out of the cloud saying this is my beloved Son right hear him so the cloud identified the presence of the Sun the word in their midst now brother brandom speaking of his coming with clouds he said he's coming how is he coming with clouds what kind of cloud clouds of Glory he said' not one of these thunderheads a raincloud but Clouds Of Glory he saidou watch what kind of a cloud he was enshrouded in when Peter and them saw his vision on Mount Transfiguration a cloud overshadowed him his rment shine he was enshrouded with the cloud the power of God so he's descending in Revelation chapter 10 from Heaven clothed with Glory clothed with power clothed in a cloud wrapped in a cloud and a rainbow Covenant over his head brother Brandon said now here is the angel on Earth and another Angel Mighty messenger come down he said see this Angel was an Earthly Angel messenger we all know who that was he said But Here Comes one down from heaven a rainbow Covenant only Christ it could be I just love the way he summarizes that only Christ it could be now the great question of the message and and I know you've been taught these things and I believe that probably you agree with me on these things but if you don't you're welcome to study it for yourself but the question that we would ask in the message then is has this Angel descended or it's just a future event and so brother Brandon preaches he doesn't really deal with the mighty Angel until 1962 in in a message called is this the sign of the end sir on the last day of the year in 1962 brother brandham begins to identify his ministry with Revelation 10 1-7 Revelation 10 1-7 he sees the the the seventh angel there in verse 7 and he begins to identify things taking place or that will take place and and he begins by telling the story of what happened at the river in 1933 he said as John the Baptist was sent forth to forun the first coming of Christ you're sent forth with a message to forrun the second coming of Christ right so there had to be there was a purpose in him coming and it was to forun the second coming of Christ so he tells about a vision and he goes into we don't have time to go into it tonight but he goes through a series of six dreams and which pred him to go west Go West Young man go west he's he he's he's being forced out of his comfort zone in Jeffersonville and told to go west he said six straight dreams and then a vision kept it and of course we know the vision of of the uh them tearing up his his road and in front of his house and doing those things and so the vision capped off the dreams and then he said when these things come to pass turn Westward turn Westward go west now and I don't want to bore you tonight but we got to lay this in here before we go somewhere we had a vision of seven birds that formed a pyramid and flew Eastward and and he talked about that and and he talked about the little birds and then some that were a little larger and then angels He said and in the vision he said I was at Tucson Arizona he made it so purpose that he didn't want me to fail to see where it was at I was picking a sandur off of me from the desert and I said now I know this is a vision I know I'm at Tucson I know them little birds there represent something they're watching Eastward all of a sudden they took a notion to fly way they went Eastward and as soon as they left the constellation of larger Birds came and they look like does with sharp pointed Wings kind of a gray color a little lighter color than what these first little Messengers was and they were coming Eastward swiftly no sooner than they got out of my sight I turned again to look Westward and there it happened he said there was a blast that actually shook the whole earth a blast he said I thought it sounded like a sound barrier ever what you call in plaines across the sound he said just shook roared everything said it could have been a great clap of thunder and lightning he said but it shook the Earth and when it did I was still looking Westward and way off into it eternity I saw a constellation of something coming it looked like it might have been little dots there could have been no less than five not more than seven in the shape of a pyramid like these Messengers coming when it did the power of almighty God lifted me up to meet them now he he talked about how and we're get into that another time he talked about how these little birds and the larger Birds and the angels represented the first second and third poll of his ministry and and he thought maybe it was his death it was his time to go this great blast would take him off the Earth but the Lord showed him it was not his death he said but a new commission and he begins to tie it to Revelation 10 and he says this he said now s he said as I entitled this is this the sign of the end time where are we living I think we could ask that question tonight where are we living what time of day is it as the weary wrestler through the night raising and turning on the clock look to see what what it is turning up the light have you ever been Restless at night it seems like the last few years of my life I've got more and more Restless at night and I find myself weary even though I'm I'm I'm I'm resting but I'm weary and and many of you probably experiened that and you're looking to see what time it is because you know the day is breaking eventually and so he said that's what it was like preaching this sermon what what what time of day is it where are we at and so he he knows the day coming but he don't know exactly when but something was coming and he said my prayer is God let us turn on the light and we know that Revelation 10:7 was the seventh angel messenger when he should begin to sound the seventh angel the mystery of God should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets he said now when he begins to sound the mystery will be finished he said then it's time for the seven seal voices of Revelation 10 to be revealed he said do you understand the congregation says amen he said when all the Mysteries someone say all all the mysteries of the book has been completed and the Bible said here that he would finish the Mysteries again he says and I'm skipping through this but you can go back and listen to the taper read it he said seven Thunders right in the Revelation here of Jesus Christ it's some mystery does not the Bible say this is the this is the revelation of Jesus Christ why there is some hidden Mystery then of it what is it the seven Thunders have it John was about to write and a voice came down from heaven and said don't write it but seal it seal it up put it on the back side of the book it's got to be revealed it's the Mysteries and so again he says time shall be no more he announces that time is over huh I wonder where we're living at church announces that time is over you know the how you view that depends on what you're looking for right time is over if if you're waiting on something to happen if you're waiting on something good when time is up that's a good thing if you're waiting on something bad to happen then when time is over you get nervous because you realize your time's running out you realize don't you realize that's the way we ought to be with anticipation we're not waiting on a squeeze we're not waiting on a we're not waiting on a on a a war we're not waiting on uh everything to blow up because we're going to be gone when that happens what are we looking for the change of our bodies where are we at we're just waiting on our change then then then what are we doing we're with anticipation we're saying time should be no more means that oh my it's over a and I know I'm getting close the Daybreak is coming right away now he said what happens could that be so now Brethren seriously think he said if it is then the pyramid is capped with the seven Thunders he goes through statue of a perfect man which by the way that's where uh Joe Coleman and them got the the Thunders Doctrine from uh that they went back and made that the virtues uh but brother Bram doesn't say the Thunders are the virtues he said it's like that he said it's like that the way he works for individual is the way he works in the church ages he said then if it that be so he's got seven Church ages he's had seven Mysteries that's been sounded away and they fought for it to bring back he said and now the headstone comes to cap off the church does the Thunders mean that my brother and sir is that where we're at now watch brother brandham talked about how that he said the church knows it's the truth the scientific world knows it's the truth and he talked about how that people that were sitting there and still living that were standing on the river when that voice spoke out and said as John was sent forth with the message of the first coming so is this the second message of the second coming and so there were people there that could have contradicted him but they didn't right right now he said if it's finished what did John do John was the one who said behold there's the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world that's him he said is the hour has it arrived my brother and I don't say it has I don't know but I'm asking you because brother brandom is not sure what exactly is going to happen but he's preaching prophetically he said I want you to think or will this be the time when will will it it will be again Behold the Lamb of God or the time of Malachi for to return the hearts of the children back to the the Faith of Our Fathers it's interesting that all of the things brother brandom mentions here is what happened at the opening of the seals and during the rest of his ministry that it was those divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turned the hearts of the children back to the hearts of the fathers and don't you realize that he doesn't even know what he's what he's saying he said could it be this could it be that could it be that and it was all of that amen I love the way God works and and we went through that recently the way a prophet God speaks to a prophet the prophet doesn't have to understand what he's saying for it to be thus sayith the Lord sir right it just has to be what God said whatever God said is thus sayith the Lord whatever God says is the absolute is that right it's just whatever God says now a and and so a prophet even though being human he could make mistakes but when when he spoke prophetically thus sayith the Lord that was God God speaking through a prophet and now he said when they see that Mighty blast sweep forth will it turn their hearts back to the father oh I believe today that our hearts have been turned back I think that's why you're here on a Wednesday night because you may have failed in your body you may have failed in your flesh you you might have this week you might have failed in some way but your heart's been turned back it wasn't your mind that got turned back because if you got talked into it you could get talked out of it but your heart got turned back we're living when that has already taken place brother JT good to see you back there buddy that that it's already taken place our hearts have been turned back to the father or was this the message already passed he said that should have done it I don't know he said this is the sign of the end time SS or is this the sign that is over he said it looks very scriptural to me I don't know was some angels there was a blast like a thunder That Shook the whole earth God knows I tell the truth just remember something is fixing to happen he said I don't know what it is but it could could it be this he said the reason I say this prepare yourselves let us pray pray how take our position in the army of his Believers prepare ourselves maybe later than we're thinking amen I it's easy to get caught up just in life it's easy to just get caught up and say well it's another Wednesday night it's another time to get together and and just have church but I think we need to recognize where we're at what day and hour that it is everything's coming to what it is every every seed that's been planted is coming to fruition in this age it's time for us to come to what we are amen oh my we've been preaching this for years this isn't the first time that someone's preached on the seven seal or the opening of the word as we know it this isn't the first time but we at some point we go we're not just preaching about it but we're manifesting it we're becoming what he said so he said it may be later than we're thinking now in February 1963 brother Brandon is hunting Havalina hogs in the Coronado Forest about 40 miles Northeast of Tucson I've been out there it's it's really not much to look at you know God does things he hides himself in Simplicity reveals himself in the same think about it God's going to Signal the end of time and the change over from Mercy to judgment which thank God there's still Mercy he's still on The Mercy Seat aren't you glad for that but there's a change coming there's a change over the the approach to Mercy the things have begun to change and and we begin to see that he signaled that by a a prophet who was hunting hogs picking a burr off of his off of his pants leg you said wh why would why would that happen like that see we don't realize the seemingly inconsequential moments of our lives but there will come a time when it be the the last time you ever brushed your teeth there will come a time it'll be the last time you ever got up to go to work there will come a time be the last time it's one of these days brother Joe it's going to be the last time and you look in the mirror and you begin to see loved ones coming behind you brother BR said we would be raised with our own generation the people that we knew and so they'll come up because they knew you and they'll begin to walk right in there with you and begin to see you begin to see them and all of a sudden you look down what's this Sudden Change he said a sweep goes over us and all of a sudden man amen we're changed we're taken up in a moment in the twinkling of an eye wh what's going what what what does that what what will be the all this momentous event that that precedes that you say well maybe we'll be in church or brother Ben will be preaching or maybe we'll be in church and and somebody I like to hear preach will be preaching or maybe there'll be a maybe there'll be a situation where I'll have a warning no it won't be any warning at all it'll just happen one day you might be brushing your teeth you might be you might be getting up you might be going to bed you you might be you might be in bed sleeping but it's going to take place just inconsequential moments sir of Our Lives don't you think we ought to always be ready just it don't matter but it does matter it's a ridge really to on or sunset Mountain just another place in the desert but it's the fulfill F of Prophecy brother brandham doesn't know it yet and so when he tells the story he begins to realize all everything that happened and they show him you know the cloud picture that was taken in Life Magazine which was just a confirmation of what took place but they show him the cloud picture and the angel said turn it to the right and you see whose face it was I I I really don't care what they say made the cloud but who's for form was it in form did it take it's Christ it's Christ and I believe that Seven Angels were his beard were his wig as brother brand says but prophecy is being fulfilled chch how do you know prophecy is not being fulfilled right now we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye I wish I could put you right on the edge of it I don't want us to lose our Edge I don't want us to think that it's just going to be like this forever because one of these days you're you're just going to walk off of this Dimension into that other dimension one of these days it's just going to happen and if you're looking for well it'll be a great Revival in the church well there there's a great Revival right now you're living in the time of the the greatest Revival that's ever been the bride Revival there's been an Awakening of the Bride what are we waiting on right you just forget me tonight but this is my heart you know we always looking for something to come and always looking for the next big preacher to come along or or the next meeting or something to come and I believe in meetings I we'll have them as long as we can I want as many people to come as can come but that's not what signals the Rapture it may not come at a meeting it may just be everyday life we're not going to be in one place on the Earth we're not even all going to agree on every little thing when it comes time for the Rapture there's going to be people I thought about this the other day Brother David you know there's going to be people that uh that I don't like that are going to be there sir you ever think about that one Landon's thinking of some people he don't like right now I can tell you realize there's going to be people go in the Rapture that you don't get along with because the bride's not all made in your image it's made in his it's not made in my image it's made in his I'm so glad for that today amen so now in July of that year 1963 or or rather in July of 1965 he preaches he preaches now he's preached almost to the end of his life which he passed away in December I believe of of 1965 and he preaches a message titled what is the attraction on the mountain what is the attraction on the mountain that's a good question and he talks about the attraction on Mount olives when Jesus fulfills prophecy by riding the donkey down off the mountain and he said about 1% of the population recogniz ized it and and begin to Rejoice because of what they saw I think that's us today we recognize what's happened and rejoiced what we saw but he talks about that he talks about Noah and how Noah uh there was a pounding going on what's this pounding on the what's this attraction on the mountain he he talks about different attractions and he talks about John in the river and talks about how the uh the the prophecy or or the attraction ch change from the prophet to his prophecy he talks about all those things and he he he finally talks about uh the the the Mountaintop experience on Mount Sunset and he says I started he's telling the story he said I started up the mountain running as hard as I could up the other side and all of a sudden I thought somebody shot me remember this is exactly what he prophesied would happen and it was several months later that it actually happened he said I never heard such a blast it shook the whole country when it did standing before me with seven angels in a cluster I met brother Fred and them a little after and said what was it I said that was it look a lot of being spiritual just recognized what recognizing what God's doing right just being able to recognize what God's doing that's a lot of the difference in in being spiritually minded and carnally minded just recognize that was it so now he said what what was it that was it what are you going to do return home for thus sayith the Lord the seven Mysteries has been hid in the Bible all these years these denominations and everything God is going to open up these seven Mysteries to us in the Seven Seals he said there was that Circle coming up from the earth like a Mist forming when it did it went Plum up into the mountain begin to circle on Westward from the way it came science found it after a while 30 mil high and 25 miles across just exactly in the circle of the pyramid he said the other day standing there turn the picture to the right there is Jesus as he was in the seven Church ages the white wig on he said showing Supreme deity he's Alpha and Omega GA he's the first and the last he's the Supreme judge of all eternity standing there to confirm the message of this hour oh my I don't have to confirm it he confirmed it right and and so just let me believe it right and he said there should be light about the evening time what's it all about what was it again he says what's happened upon Mount Sunset God confirming his word there's a time that God speaks it there's a time when God confirms it this is the hour of of confirmation we're not living in the hour when God is is uh is speaking by a prophet anymore but what are we living in the hour of confirmation there was one to an age there was only one who had the the sign of the son of man there was only one who who could bring these things a prophet to the age but now we're living in the hour when we're being it's being fulfilled what he said and I'll say this what's greater than the prophecy or the Fulfillment well without the prophecy there couldn't be a fulfillment but without the F fulfillment the prophecy is no good oh my so without you without you nothing can be done now look it's what's all this noise about what's happened on Mount Mount Sunset God confirming his word that's what all this noise is about notice it's God fulfilling his promised word again Revelation 10 1 to 7 and in the days of the sounding of the seventh Angel's message the mystery of God should be finished the hidden Mystery of Revelation 10 1-7 the last message to the last Church age fulfills exactly in this age the day when the son of man shall be revealed he said there shall arise false prophets and false Christ and show great signs and wonders in as much as it deceive the very elected possible the people still in doubt and as usual the church is just as puzzled he's talked about science being puzzled he said they're just as puzzled that Supernatural Halo hanging there yonder in the sky as it was when the Magi has come in folling a star saying where is he this born King of the Jews what was it God fulfilling his word there shall rise a star out of Jacob and the god of Heaven promised evening time would have he evening lights now I've read this to you often but but watch what's he saying God did what he promised to do sir yeah is this what it is Sir is this the sign of the end and it was emphatically answered yes sir this was the sign of the end three years ago this mystery was a prophecy sir what time is it sir but now it's history right it's past now the seventh seal is the end of all things think about it now what what is it it's ped the promise is fulfilled what time is it sir and what this attraction God fulfilling his word he's the same yesterday today and forever now the book was closed and now it is open the seven Thunders have been revealed the book that was sealed to Daniel and to John is now open when would it be at the time of the end seal it up to the time of the end now now let's look at verse two of Revelation chap 10 and I think we'll we'll take this very quickly and then we'll go but verse two it says he had in his hand a little book open now he never says books but a book and it's actually a scroll he has a scroll this is my scroll for our purposes tonight this is my scroll Melody this is this is my scroll tonight so this will be a scroll now a scroll is just a rolled up piece of paper right but it was a great invention because they could make a book what they would do is open it up and you could see what was on it now this was a scroll that was written on the outside and on the inside right you can't have one without the other it takes the written word and it takes Revelation takes the revealed word now you what you've got is a scroll and it's sealed right with Seven Seals I've got seven pieces of tape on my scroll right so what happens if I take one off broke a seal right now still got six on it now that scroll would have been a little different because you could pull back a part of it and see what that seal was but it's still clo a closed book right so we're going to take off another one see now it's got how many that is five right so I've taken two off I've got five left but the book isn't open yeah right I'm trying to just put this as simple as we can put it tonight took a little paper with it I took another one off we're going to have paper all over the floor too I took another one off oh now there's four know if we're going to get number five off or not five you didn't think you were going to the theater did you win me an Oscar right here that was hard to come off that's six that's tough man six but is it open or closed right so when we say this the seals have been open what are we saying the book is open right now now look at the mighty angel that comes down he has in his hand a little book open what that means is the seventh seal at this time has been opened that was a tough one right so he has in his hand oh I love this a book you can understand right one you can read this message is something you can understand right God did something opened up the book I'll say this the message it it has to be scriptural because the book in this instance the book is many things but the book is the Bible brother Bram says the Bible had to be open so now it's open what that means is you can understand it so now you understand how many things do you understand that you didn't understand before the message think about it some of you were raised in the message I was raised in the message but the message had to come to me so there's a lot of things I understand today that I didn't just automatically understand I understand the godhead I understand serpent seed I understand uh most of it anyway I understand now now all of us don't understand at the same level but it's open so we can understand it's open so I can preach if the book is still rolled up I got nothing to preach with Alan there's no there's nothing to preach because and we might as well just go back into a denominational church because there's a lot of things they do well right if we're not going to and you wonder why do I preach from quotes why do I why do I come from I know I read too much but but this is my this is the message we're not preaching a a Pentecostal message we're not preaching a a message of another day this is it the book is open I have something to say what is it what a prophet said because that was the revelation oh God the words of a prophet in this hour is the revelation of the opening of the word now watch now brother BR said not when he begins this ministry but not when he starts he said but when he begins his ministry right so there there was a time he had a progressive revelation he had to learn but we know that now the book is open we can go study it for ourselves we can feed on it for ourselves I challenge you every one of us can understand it just as good as a preacher can now you may not be able to rightly divide it but you have the benefit of hearing a preacher you you have the Ben oh my you have the benefit of hearing the five-fold ministry that can take the word and God's got them today but you also have the benefit of being able to check us out with the word find out if it's right or not take what I've said tonight study the message and see the book is either open or Clos it can't be both right so now it's open and he cried with a loud voice when a lion Roth when he cried seven Thunders uttered their voices when the seven Thunders had uttered their voes about to write Heard a Voice from Heaven saying to me seal up right so it had to be unsealed seal up those things which the seven Thunders uttered write them not the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the Earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven and the things that there in are and the earth and the things that there in are and the Sea and the things which are therein there should be time no longer and you might say brother Ben what are we doing here if you go look at that in any other version other than the King James version it literally says there's no more delay that's what the Greek word means time no longer there's no more delay we understand time no longer meaning when that happens and time's over that's not what he's saying there will be no more delay in the Fulfillment of the Divine Pro purposes respecting the church on the Earth oh my I want you to notice one more thing before we close you know one of the signs of the end is false Christ false anointed ones how many know that right how do we know that by the opening of the seals see but he didn't preach that in the opening of the seals now watch Matthew 24:24 said for there shall arise false Christ and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect why would the elect not be deceived you ever thought about that why why would the elect not be deceived because we have an open book if the book had not been open we could still be deceived but the book was open If the message is not complete then we have a problem because we're still subject to every wind of doctrine that comes along but if the message is complete and if a prophet did his job and if we're resting on the fact that he preached what Paul preached then I believe today that we know where we're at amen oh my why would the elect not be deceived now look with the r that Jesus tells you here now in Matthew 24 it would be a sign at the end time he said now if this sign is only to be known at the end time then it'll have to be after the opening of those seals see oh my it has to be after the book is open after the opening of the see it's a sign of the end that would be when those when these thing happens these things happens it'll be at the end time it'll be a sign now so the elected will not be confused in these things oh I I want so badly we would not be confused the elected in this hour do not have to be confused you say brother Ben there's a lot of confusion around the message well not everybody read the open book book not everybody's elect but the elect won't be confused in this hour I I believe we're living in the hour as musicians come and there's no more delay it's over in other words there's no more prophets to come there's no more there's no more Revelation in the sense of Revelation to be brought there's Revelation for us to receive everything we need is is here even for a Rapture what what am I supposed to do this I keep coming back to this but it's so simple at the end of the seventh seal brother brand says just go live a a Godly life plant your potatoes why why is he telling us that he said but brother Ben why why would you even tell us these things then he said the brother brandom tells us why he said the wise will understand and that understanding gives us the ability to not be deceived at the end time if the seven sealed book is not open we are not at the time of the end we can't even know the truth of false anointed ones at the end time how will we not be deceived I'm glad it's open I'm glad there's been more than just a a teaching but there's been an anointing released in our day that the mighty Angel has come down into our age and and we don't receive the Revelation and I'm getting ahead of myself but we don't get the Revelation from the hand of William Brandon we get it from the hand of the mighty Angel himself we receive it from the hand of Christ oh my I'm glad it's open don't you aren't you I'm glad there's no more delay this is the sign of the end sir oh my where do we live we should live every day just as close as we possibly can believe that today let's bow our heads [Music] together [Music] I was told one time that I had someone tell me said brother Ben I know why you smile While You Preach said because I met your congregation I thought what a compliment that is what a compliment they said they're such good people and care for people and things what are you doing you're manifesting the coming of the Lord to be an overcomer in this age means to be one who eats the word becomes the word manifests the word that's what I want to be I wanted to be more than just a Wednesday night bible study but I wanted to show in my life oh God let it show let me eat from it I want every day to be like today as I'm stud I was studying ahead and getting into some things that we'll be getting into in coming weeks and I just got almost beside myself but oh God you you've just given us so much to Feast on it's just so much to take in and I know sometimes it makes you feel like well I how could I possibly know these things and and still mess up like I do and still still get angry at people and not always have the right attitude but I say there's more for you today the power to live above sin is here it's been released in this age the ability to love God with all of your hearts been released yeah you live in a body of Flesh and you struggle absolutely till the moment you leave here but I I say for every one of us there's more for us there's a deeper walk there's there's somewhere we can grab something we can grab a hold of oh God let me love it like like I want to there's something in me that loves this message let me love it with all my heart with all my soul with all my with all my mind with all my strength brother BR said it's the flame of the hour let it be the flame of our hearts I pray that it would be so on a Wednesday night tonight that we could recognize more than just a prophet more than just a preacher more than a pastor more than a church we could recognize the message of the hour being a reality in our lives could we just do that tonight and just say Lord I I I want a deeper walk with you that's what I want I want My Worship to be more sincere what did he tell brother Brandon when he when he told him he showed him these things he he' come two-third of the way and he said there's over there is the land where all the promises lay he said and to to enter there to to to bind that demon of of death to bind that that snake that Mamba of death he said you got to be more sincere than what you are now I say oh God let me be more sincere than what I was when I came in let me walk forward let me press forward where I've been dilatory about things and let go of some things that I should have been grabbing a hold of let me grab a hold of them with all of my heart let may this message stir me again let it move me in a way that it hasn't maybe for years lost sight of of the depth of it I've lost the sight of where I was this is the time of the end Let Me Be Moved Lord oh God that's my prayer tonight Heavenly Father Lord I I ask you Lord to forgive me Lord and help me oh God we realize these things we at the time of the end Lord it alarms us when we see Israel going through what they're going through right now we see things going on all over the Earth we see men that don't know their men women don't know their women we see a prophet that prophesied it many years ago we see the situation of politics we we see the situation of the economy Lord we see the hour that we live in oh God help us not to be arrogant help us Lord not to be a people that just have a head knowledge of it but Lord may it become a reality in our lives oh God may your Holy Spirit just begin to move in our lives may you wake up each and everyone I realize Lord that just attending this church does not mean a person will go in the Rapture just coming and saying we're Christians or even we believe in a prophet will not get us there but Lord we want everyone to be there there must be a new birth in our life there must be a birth of the word there must be a change oh God let us possess that change let us possess that land today oh God starting with me Lord oh God forgive us where we failed you help us to rise in Faith Lord and in confidence of this message we can believe Lord that you're the same yesterday today and forever let us preach it oh God I know it's not popular today to preach these things but Lord I believe this is this is the bride food Lord may I may I preach it with all of my heart Lord may we receive it may we feed on it with all of our heart until that day that you come so thankful for that Lord we thank you for helping us in every moment of our life thank you for those seemingly inconsequential moments like on a Wednesday night when we think well nothing's going to happen Lord in those moment sometimes the greatest experiences of our life takes place Lord maybe this is the moment the last time we'll ever sit in church before the coming of the Lord maybe maybe the prophet picked many birds off of his off of his clothes in between the time that you made the prophecy and in between that time and the time that it happened but one day was the last one was the one Lord may it be so today may this be the service Lord when we're sealed away I pray you granted Lord fill everyone with the Holy Spirit Lord refill us oh God help us to walk with you every moment worship you with all of our hearts we thank you Lord thank you for saving us thank you for Mercy Lord Lord I just feel such a burden in my heart tonight Lord and but I'm thankful for Mercy thankful for a way out we could not do it on our own Lord on our own effort
