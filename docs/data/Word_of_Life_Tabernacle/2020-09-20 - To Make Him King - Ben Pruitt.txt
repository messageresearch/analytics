is meet here and say some words or it might be good but it wouldn't do anything supernaturally for us but god if you could come and anoint the word and just sink it down into our hearts lord there

don't you love him this morning turn with me to first chronicles chapter 11 and verse 10. it's good to be here today happy birthday to brother david he's escaping us back there but he's today's his birthday and he would usually be the one that would say that so i'll i'll do that for him this morning and then thank you to all of you for helping us to stay safe as a church to remain open that's what we want to do it's our desire and so i appreciate you all working with us and so many people had to be home today but but i know your heart's here with us and so we we appreciate you as well very much those that weren't able to come today um we've got some visitors here in the back and i want you to feel welcome this morning god bless you thank you for being with us this morning and uh we believe the word of god that's what we're that's what we base our doctrine on and what we believe and so we're going to turn to the word of god first chronicles chapter 11 and verse 10. it's good to have jason and emily with us and heavenly today and jason our brother david wants avonlea to come and i want jason to come so there i don't know where that leaves emily but but jason and i become really good friends and and we and we appreciate him very much first chronicles 11 and 10 and emily as well first chronicles 11 10. these also are the chief of the mighty men whom david had who strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom and with all israel to make him king according to the word of the lord concerning israel i want to take for a text those words to make him king and the lord add his blessing to the word you may be seated this morning david didn't feel much like a king but the bruce when he first got to the cave of adullum he'd become a fugitive saul wanted to kill him he had to beg food and a weapon from a priest he'd pretended to be insane to get away from the philistines if you go and read those chapters you find that he had been in a bad place it's not a very good start to a kingdom doesn't look like much of a kingdom the world today might say the same thing about jesus and his kingdom they did when he was on earth they they didn't realize that he was the king in fact they mocked him for it and isaiah in isaiah 53 and 1 prophesied that he would come that way he said who hath believed our report to whom is the arm of the lord revealed it's an incredible report that a man would be born in the earth and he'd be virgin born he'd be the son of god to be god wrapped in flesh that's an incredible thing to believe you know people say today well i can't believe in miracles well you can't believe in the virgin birth then and so you'd have to leave that out but jesus came that way who hath believed our report to whom is the arm of the lord revealed verse 2 for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of a dry ground he hath no form or comeliness when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him he is despised and rejected of men a man of sorrows acquainted with grief we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not he was homeless when he came to the earth in luke chapter 9 and verse 58 jesus said foxes have holes birds of the air have nests but the son of man hath not where to lay his head makes you feel better about your house doesn't it makes me feel better about mine brother brahma says this way he said he stooped that we might be lifted that's christ's likeness by the way stooping so someone else can be lifted he stooped that we might be lifted he become us that we through his grace might become him he come to the homeless and became homeless itself that we might have a home he come to the sick and was made sick himself that we might be healed he came to the center and was made sin himself that we might be saved aren't you glad that you have a god like that aren't you glad you serve a god like that oh you know i know sometimes there's just when there's a few of us we we kind of get a little bit nervous and you think well people notice me but don't that just take all the nerves out of you you just want to worship him you you want to say man you want to you you want your voice to be heard because that's your god he come for the sick that was me he made himself sick so we might be healed comes a sinner and he's made sin he did no sin but he was made sin we might be saved when he died they mocked him by calling him the king of the jews in matthew 27 and verse 29 it says when they had platted a crown of thorns they put it upon his head and a reed in his right hand and they bowed the knee before him and mocked him saying hail king of the jews they spit upon him and took the reed and smote him on the head you read on down in verse 36 it says sitting down they watched him there and set up over his head his accusation his accusation written this is jesus verse 37 this is jesus the king of the jews they mocked him by calling him a king but he was the king don't look at what it looks like in the world what it looks like to the world god doesn't view things the way we do the potential doesn't lie in a person's money or or how good they look or what they've done in the past or what they've been but the potential is in the seed the potential is in the seat and david was in a bad place in his life but he had been anointed to be king and he was elected and for ordained by god to take that place and so there's nothing that could keep him from taking that place and you might find yourself in a hard time of life this morning and speaking to those sitting here and you watching this morning but you may find yourself in a difficult place but remember you were anointed to be something to do something and god is bringing you through this time to bring you to a better place brother branham talked about this bad place that david was in in his life and he's sitting there he said he was sitting there his throat burning him was in the middle of summer the philistines was taking advantage of that split between david and saul i could stop there and preach for a while but whenever there's a split or what the bible calls a schism in the body satan takes advantage of that right and that's why we have to be of one mind one accord and as much as it's possible live peaceably together and learn how to get along with each other because satan takes advantage of that split and satan took advantage and saul looking for david everywhere he said in the philistines also and then the philistines looking for the israelites he said talk about a time of confusion just about like it is now a time of confusion he said david taking refuge in this little place in this little shelter everywhere he could get to the little strongholds that he could hold into then he got up on the mountain on that hot middle of the summer when the heat was tremendous his throat parching and frustrations and fears in his heart and wondering oh god how could it be he said you poured that oil upon me not because i chose myself but you chose me why did you call me from hurting the sheep out yonder told me that you give me this to serve your people and here you've got me between the fires everywhere he said that was going through his heart i think brother branham spoke of his own experience as well that in the heat of the battle you begin to think and say lord i remember those nights that i laid out yonder on that hillside he said i remember when i watched them stars amen he says how they moved up yonder and how god talked to my little boy heart all of us can remember those days when you seem like you were that close to god but remember the same god is with you today now he's dealing with us and i said this a while back and i but i think it's important he's dealing with us in a more mature way than he has in the past we're not babies anymore we're not playing church anymore so god is dealing with us in a mature way and so he's letting us deal with things in a mature way because god doesn't want just a bunch of babies running around but he wants men and women sons and daughters that can that can fulfill his word and so in doing that he has to reach a place of maturity and david had reached that place where he said he's got to be trained he's got to go through this time to become a king but he can remember what it was like before he said i can remember when i got in the spirit one day looking at the clouds the shady green pastures till i screamed out in the spirit and saying the lord is my shepherd i shall not want yea though i walk through the valley of the shadows of death i'll fear no evil for thou art with me he remembered that he said oh my here he was right in the jaws of death right then on both sides the a though i walked through the valley of the shadow of death them good old days when the spirit was with me when god was with me i sang his praises enjoyed him you remember what it was like to enjoy being a christian we should be that way today but things get in the way don't they in the heat of the battle sometimes it's hard to know what it was like to remember what it was like to enjoy being a christian and then you enjoyed being a christian so you had to wear a mask and you got chased away by a hurricane he got sick he got old some of you know what i'm talking about he enjoyed being a christian until you had to deal with real problems in the church then all of a sudden the enjoyment just seemed like it leaked out but he's still the same god and that joy can still be there unexplainable in the middle of everything that you're going through in the middle of all the problems in the middle of all the situations of life that joy somehow comes in and just settles down over you and you think here i am lord i'm not young anymore i'm dealing you're dealing with me in a mature way but i know you still love me and you feel the joy of his love you feel the joy of deliverance even though you're going through a hard time he said i enjoyed him i remember one time and i'm skipping through some of this to save time but much of this comes from the message brother branham preached called why little bethlehem he says i remember one time little old lion come up one morning and got one of my sheep he said and the spirit of god came upon me and i went out and grabbed him and cut him to pieces i remember that deliverance you know some people don't have any memories of deliverance because they've never been delivered but i remember what god did and it helps when you're going through a hard time to begin to remember what god did for you begin to remember that you you weren't always in this hard place but there was a time when god delivered you and if he delivered you once he can deliver you again if he brought you out once he can bring you out again he's the same yesterday today and forever so as we get older in our christian experience brother harvey it ought to make us that much more settled and solid because we've seen god do it before we're not scared because we've seen him do it before if he did it before he can do it again he will do it again he said i can remember that evening just before the sun went down a bear come in and got one and i killed him amen them great deliverances you can remember when satan come after your kids you pray and god delivered you remember when satan come after the church and you pray and you begin to seek god and god brought a deliverance if he did it once he can do it again great deliverances as i remember when i sang his praises in my childhood days when i herded my sheep he said oh god take me back to that place do you love him less than you used to there's a problem there these ought to be the best days of our lives yes we're going through hardship no we're not going to pretend that it's not hard to have to deal with the things we've had to deal with this year we're not going to pretend that the world's just not everything's fine everybody agrees no everything's not fine but we have a god that's the same oh god take me back to that place take me back to my first love amen take me back to my first love take me back give me back my shepherd's staff give me back my herd of sheep let me alone back there to worship you but see god had a different plan for david there was a time when that's how he dealt with him was with the shepherd's staff there was a time when he was out there by himself and he could he could make the psalms and all those things if you go and look at the psalms you find david talking about green pastures and still waters and all of a sudden you say he says they pierced my hands to my feet. god brought him through something so he could reveal something in him so he could manifest something in his life god brings us through something so we can manifest something in our lives he said sometimes we think that he said but we're in the heat of battle something has got to be done that's the time we live in something has got to be done we can't just lay down anymore it's not always going to feel good when we come to church it's not always going to feel good when we serve god there's going to be hardship there's going to be trial but remember he said i'm with you amen the same god that was with the sin is with us now he said we're in the heat of battle something has got to be done we were boys once we're grown up men now the fight is on he said i remember when the sawdust balled up on the floor and the people screamed and shouted and you couldn't get around the place nowhere here nowhere here for people he said but it's not that way today the battle is on and we want to feel good i want to feel good everybody wants to feel good but battles don't feel good war doesn't feel good but you remember he's still with you amen and i believe that during those times he'll just drop a handful on purpose just it's a little bit of joy a little bit of peace so that you can experience what you had back then it hasn't left you you're just at a different time in your life it's time for grown-up men to stand up and be what they were called to be and so brother brown says oh it's not william branham the little boy preacher anymore you know there was a time and i experienced that i started preaching when i was 12. i know what it's like for people to come hear you just because they never heard somebody that young preach but that's not the way it is anymore you got to produce something right at some point the rubber meets the road you know it's fine when you're young and and my my boy's 13 years old and he he can have his dreams and just take his time and decide what he wants to do it's too late for me i got to produce something there's got to be milk in the fridge got to be bread in the cupboard right at some point you've got to produce something and as mature christians and those of you watching as well as mature christians we have to produce something in our lives we're required to produce something in this hour and it's hard there's a battle but he said i'll be with you during the battle but now he said you got to produce something there's got to be something different the time is on the battle is on the heat is on the time to be delivered he said the people everyone is found written in the book now the time has come brother branham reached that place in his ministry where he couldn't just he couldn't just go along like he used to he had to say something maybe one time the people all flocked in and then he began to open his mouth and preach and teach the word and when he did people began to leave just like they did with jesus and the word become a fugitive that's the way he was when he was here the word become a fugitive everywhere he went they looked to kill him the word today in the earth is a fugitive the bible says that in the slavery in church age in revelations 3 and 20 he said behold i stand at the door and knock he said if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come into him and we'll sup with him and he with me why is he knocking he's outside the church the church nominal he's outside they won't let him in they don't want the word the word is a fugitive the word is fugitive the word is rejected the word is not wanted i pray it would never become that way in our churches so we have is the message if we get to where we don't we don't want the message anymore the word becomes a fugitive just tell us something good bump us up and everybody be excited we'll go home but the word becomes a fugitive smile to us tell us we're going to be prosperous tell us everything's going to be going good that the word becomes a fugitive he says they're knocking at the door but there is a people today that the will will believe the word will accept the word will stand with the word and there was a people there with david there was some men who gathered around him there at the cave when they began to gather around him what attracted them to him what was it that attracted there was something about it they believed amen they believed that he would be king oh it's easy to see why warriors would be attracted to saul because saul stood head and shoulders above the rest and saul used denominational methods to attract men to him you remember what he did he cut up the ox and sent it out to everybody he used denominational methods he he showed himself a strong man showed his strength and attracted the people david showed his weakness he's being hunted he's a fugitive the philistines won't take him the moabites won't nobody will take him and so he's running he goes into a cave when he goes into the cave men start to follow him why because they were attracted by something different than just a show of strength there had been many strong men there had been many warlords in that day there was many people who could show a show of strength and there's many people today in the land that can show a show of strength don't be discouraged because you're a little bride because there's many people that can show greater strength many people that can that can be a soul that can be a commanding leader but he's not looking for that he's looking for weakness that he can work through and it's not so much that he uses the weakness but the weakness creates an opportunity right the weakness creates an opportunity because when we're weak he's strong so it's easy to see where they would be attracted to saul maybe the philistine king had had all this money and these warriors it's easy to see why great men like goliath would be attracted to somebody like that but why david and remember david is the type of christ now they were attracted to david first of all because nothing else in their lives had worked out look at the kind of men that they were and we need to be honest about this and say well i have options well not if you come to christ people who come to christ are out of options look what kind of men they were first samuel 22 2 everyone that was in distress everyone that was in debt everyone that was discontented gathered themselves unto him and he become a captain over them and there were with him about 400 men that word distress means a confinement or disability anguish everyone that was anguished everyone that had a disability everyone that was in trouble in distress straightness they didn't know maybe they were being hunted themselves because of the unjust laws that that saul had made and saw was a man who liked to govern by fiat he'd say nobody's going to eat until i figure out why god won't speak to me all right you remember the story and david went down put his staff in the honeycomb and got some honey and i had the strength to fight and david and saul had disabled his own army because god wouldn't speak to him and brother branham type that to denominationalism and you look at it today and realize that that's still the case now here these men were in distress they were in debt and what that means is that they had there were usually the usury laws had not been enforced under the law you couldn't you couldn't put a man unfairly in debt you couldn't charge interest to a brother to another israelite you couldn't do it under the law but but somehow it was being done because under saul's system it didn't really matter you could still do it and so these men didn't fit under saul's reign they just didn't fit in with the laws that he had made and so now they didn't fit in and so their creditors were beating down the door that word means to to lend on interest or to give usury they were discontented and that means to be bitter they were angry bitterly discontented and they were bitter of soul and i like the way a commentator puts this he said not not desirous of new things not just because they were tired of saul not because they were merely dissatisfied with their present condition but those whose anxiety of soul came from the ever worsening condition of the kingdom under saul they could see things weren't going like they're supposed to be going they could see things just kept getting worse and kept getting worse and that drove them to a leader from whom for the future they might hope for better things and i wish you know what people say well where is that leader today i wish i could be that leader i wish someone else could be but that's not the way it works we are driven from leadership of men we're driven from denominationalism to christ the word because we are driven to a leader from whom we hope for the future better things there's nothing better coming out of denominationalism there's nothing better it's not the current condition that attracts us it's the promise that we know that if we stay under his leadership there's better days ahead it's not just well he's going to heal you he's going to take care of you everything's going to be fine no i'm thinking of better days i'm not just looking for healing in my body though i believe in that but i'm looking for complete healing of the body looking for a new body looking for a king to take his throne amen jesus said the same thing in mark chapter 2 and verse 15. it says it come to pass as jesus said at meet in his house many republicans and sinners said also together with jesus and his disciples for there were many and they followed him another place that said the common people heard him gladly they just didn't fit in with the pharisee system john 6 and 68 the disciples didn't fit in either simon peter answered him said lord to whom shall we go we're we're desperate men we've tried everything else thou hast the words of eternal life brother branham said here some time ago i went to an auditorium where another man a fine religious man a good brother famous teacher he said internationally known or nationally anyhow he was kindly opposed of divine healing he said he's changed his mind since then but that afternoon when 15 hundred people was sitting in the auditorium he preached on christ the savior of the world asked people if they'd come down and accept him and there was one woman walked down and shook his hand he said nothing against that he went out the audience was dismissed as congregation went out all nice well-dressed people intelligent looking people nothing wrong with them walking out the minister about his head to the people walked out in a dignified graceful way i thought my that's very nice but here come my group in mind come in on crutches wheelchairs straight jackets what did jesus say they that are whole don't need a physician those that are sick mine come in on crutches wheelchairs straight jackets that's a different thing for your face to buck something like that he says see just to say come down and accept christ and be saved and walk out that's not so bad but when you have to prove what you're talking about and the denominational church today they don't have to prove anything right they can just come and go to church and leave and and be in and some of them good people but they don't have to prove anything because you don't have to live any differently to be a member than you do to be in the world there's nothing to be proved but we we talk of a higher thing and see the thing is people point to bad things that happen to message people or to bible believing people we should say people who really hold to the word of god for this day there's bad things happen among us sure they do people fall people sin there's things that happen and people point to that and say that's awful but that's the way the rest of the world lives we're looking for something better we see something better yes these men were outlaws yes they had troubles financially yes they were distressed yes they had bitterness of soul but but they were discontented for a reason there's something better out there amen we believe that this morning this earth is not our home if coronavirus could teach us anything it ought to teach us that we shouldn't be scared out of our minds about it why because there's a better place there's a better home we're looking for something better david our king the son of david's taking his throne he said you have to prove what you're talking about he said when jesus christ comes down and makes he said but brother as long as it's in his gospel and he promised it don't let one thing shake you because he will do it do we believe that today it's in the gospel he promised it and don't let one thing shake you because he will do it he said he will do it yes sir the only thing you have to do is believe it and ask him to help you and believe that he will and he will take care of the rest of it so they were attracted to david because because they could see that david wasn't a part of that system they were looking for something better they couldn't fit in they didn't have other options they were also attracted to david because he was one of them it wasn't just that they didn't have any other options but david was like them he was being hunted and they were being hunted he was a fugitive they were fugitives saul had never been a fugitive he was always head and shoulders above the rest but david could be touched by their situation because he'd been there he'd become one of them he knew what it was like to be hunted he wasn't some man who couldn't know what it was like to be hungry to be thirsty he had experienced our sorrows aren't you glad that he has experienced christ has experienced our sorrows so if he ever become king he could enforce the laws that saul had refused or failed to enforce now listen they knew that if he ever become king the usury would stop if he ever become king men would stop taking advantage of other men because he knew what it was like to be taken advantage of if he ever become king there'd be worship in the temple again because david knew what it was like to worship if he become king there would be a difference in administration from saul there would be righteousness in the land amen oh church do you realize the same thing is true of christ that when he becomes king there'll be no more sickness when he becomes king there'll be no more death now he's our king now but there's coming a day when he'll establish his kingdom on the earth that's the son of david when he does there will be no more sin there'll be no more heartache there no be no more sorrow it'll be beyond perfection why he's different he's a different kind of administration than what we've experienced in the past this is satan's eden but we're looking for david to be king he was one of us so he knows what we're going through hebrews 4 14 he said seeing them and we have a great high priest that is passed into the heavens jesus the son of god let us hold fast our profession for we have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin he said let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace why do we come boldly because he was tempted like we are amen he could be touched by the feeling of our infirmities so now we can come boldly into the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need but see if we don't understand that and listen to me on this if we don't understand that and those of you streaming as well i know it's harder to listen at home i've had to do that first time in my life this year that i can remember i've had the stream of service from home not be able to go with what i had chronovirus and it's hard to listen but but just pinch your conscience for a moment because remember a lack of understanding about who he is in his priestly in his high priest office will keep you from receiving the holy ghost and it will keep you from receiving the benefits of the holy ghost do you know that you don't understand that he became you if you don't get that he was a man and so satan tried so hard to fight that and make him a second person or a third person of the trinity but he became us god become a man and then he lived in that body and he experienced those things now if you don't understand that it'll keep you from receiving the holy ghost and i take that from brother branham's message in 1959 he said lord he said if there's one here tonight that you've knocked at their heart's door they haven't received jesus yet let them know that you want to adopt them in the family of abraham you want to oh don't you feel that the choice even delivers you in church you stand there knocking let them know jesus wants you to come in he wants to come into your heart he wants he wants you to be a part of what he's doing in this hour he wants to be to live in your heart living your soul but but people just passed on by but he said if there's one here who hasn't received that let them know that you want to adopt them into the family of abraham and they say well i drink i smoke i gamble or i lie steal or something let them know that all those things are conquered through christ jesus because he was tempted to lie he didn't do it he was tempted to steal sure become poor he was even tempted with women the prophet taught us but he never sinned oh my he was tempted like we were but he was being guarded fleshy he did no sin and he died for us and that perfect one became sin for us and when he becomes sin for us he said let them know that you are tempted in all manner like we are amen and so i took that where you know it could keep you from receiving the holy ghost he said there's many here no doubt lord through frustrations and doubts and worries has failed to receive the holy ghost now think about that and so someone's seeking the holy ghost and i've watched this before and maybe they're even desperate for it and you should be but if you keep frustration in your mind and doubt and worry you'll fail to receive it because you don't realize he was made sin for you he wants to give it to you more than you want to receive it he was tempted in all manner like we are and so you become so concerned about what's going on in your life that you can't receive him well i i've got this this problem if i could ever quit smoking then he would come no he wants to give you a new desire if i could ever quit gambling if i could ever quit looking at the wrong things on the internet i i i'd come to him then no he was tempted in all like manner like you are to take your sin he said let them know he said that you are tempted you were tempted in all that manner like we are yet without sin you took our place and conquered the enemy by your righteous life he's imputed righteousness to us right it's not that we can do it on our own well i'll quit lying i'll quit drinking i'll quit smoking no he imputes righteousness to you and then you quit lying you quit drinking you quit smoking why because he lived for you and he died for you now look he said you took our place and conquered the enemy by your righteous life that we who are unrighteous can still have the victory as we believe on you and claim the promise so those fears and misunderstandings doubts worries frustrations can keep you from receiving the holy ghost because you don't realize he's already taken care of your sin now look they were attracted to david because he was one of them they had that understanding they were attracted to david because they believed so important they believed that he would be king and all they maybe heard was the story that the prophet had anointed him to be king but they held to that they couldn't prove it they didn't they didn't have any maybe they weren't even there probably probably none of them were these were gentiles gentile warriors who come with david but why were they attracted to him because they believed it amen they believed he would be king and what did what did peter say to jesus after he said to whom should we go he said and we believe john 6 69 we believe and are sure that thou art that christ the son of the living god we're sure we weren't there at the virgin birth we we didn't hear the angel speak to mary but we're sure amen why there's something there in the heart that can believe brother branham picks it up and why little bethlehem he said how in the world can it ever come to pass the devil on both sides driving at david we feel that way today don't we kind of pinch in between the devil on all sides sickness over on this side and here's the the world over on this side pressing on us and the politics and things coming on both sides the devil on both sides driving at david he said he had taken refuge in strongholds in the wilderness and in caves trying to hide out with a little band of faithful warriors just a few believing like him but those men believed god that that would be the king he said so is the believers today who's hid out from place to place but yet they know who is coming to be king and brother randall says this i think this is opportune for this time now he said this in 1958 when there was an election coming up in 1960 but he said who he said i don't care who is going to be president we know he's coming oh it's all right we can get excited about one or the other but he's coming i wasn't put on this earth to make a certain person president i was put on this earth to make him king are you with me now i don't care who's going to be president sure one one might be better than the other but i want him to be king we know he's coming and looks farther away than it ever did he said when science is trying to overrule and say they can build a man they can do this they can take a rabbit take the paul and make another rabbit and so forth trying to disprove god's word he's talking about cloning which i didn't even know existed back when this was written in 1958 but he said yet there is a people who believe god who stands just as pat as they ever did he said no matter what comes or goes they still believe god god is right they hold to god's unchanging hands in the midst of battle amen that's where we're at today in the midst of battle in the midst of tears in the midst of sickness and death and everything amen are you with me this morning church in the midst of sickness in the midst of battle in the midst of tears in the midst of everything they still hold to god's unchanging hand they know that he's coming king it's not just something they think is going to happen or they wish would happen but they know and so they don't get caught up in the things of the world because they know he's coming king i can tell you what i think is going to happen in the election but i don't know but we know he's going to be king i can tell you what i think is going to happen with the coronavirus what i think is going to happen with the church but we don't know but we know he's going to be king amen and we still hold to god's unchanging hand because we know that he is coming king why because the word of god says so and sons of god believe the word of god amen we know he's coming king they believed he would be king so the scripture our text said that they strengthened themselves to fight to make him king they strengthen themselves today we ask god for strength we want him to give us strength but we need to examine our modus many times why do we want strength is it to build a kingdom or to make him king why do we want strength i i want this church to be full every view her chair whatever i want it to be full sure we do why would we want anything less but why do we want strength we want to have an influence on our community but why is it to build our own kingdom to make the name of our pastor or the name of the church great in the community or is it to make him king is it to prove it that's why so many people get excited when something bad happens to somebody from another church just hang with me for a minute something bad happened to somebody else and people get all excited oh where that that man that'll bring them down so we can come up that's the way the gentiles work that's the cosmos that's the way this world works without the way christians work we're not building a kingdom here in this church we're making him king if that means i have to preach to 20 people or 50 people or 100 people doesn't matter i want to make him king my job here is not to make me king it's not to consolidate my power until i have power over the deacons in power over the trustees and power of the song leader that's not my job my job is to make him king to give him the preeminence amen to create an atmosphere brother david that's our job create an atmosphere so that the the king can come amen so the king can be in our midst we don't want to build our own kingdoms we want to make him king then when we enforce the laws when we when we have discipline whatever it is in the church we're doing it not for our own kingdom we're not doing just to make ourselves feel better to have power with the people we do it to make him king we want him to be king and he can't be king if we refuse if we just look and take sin and just leave it there no we've got to deal with it because we make him king the word is made king oh my that's why we want to be strengthened second samuel 23 and hey let's look at these men real quickly he said these be the names of the mighty men whom david had the tachmanite that said in the seat the word means the man full of wisdom the tachmanian chief among the captains so somebody had to be chief uh somebody had to be chief huh but they worked together now look chief among the captains the same was adino the s night he lift up his spear against 800 whom he sue at one time that's a pretty powerful ministry he's got but why did he do it what did he do what was he fighting for to make david king and so you find in verse 9 it says after him with eliezer the son of dodo the aoi one of the three mighty men with david when they defied the philistines that were there gathered together to battle and the men of israel was gone away euros and smote the philistines until his hand was weary god give us some men like these some men and women that'll stand for god until their hand gets weary he said his hand got weary and his hand claven to the sword he got home that night and he couldn't even he couldn't even release his grip because he'd held on for so long god help me to fight like that to fight the devil like that as buddy robinson said i'll i'll fight him till he said i'll bite him joey ain't got no teeth he said and then i'll gum him to death and so that's what we have to have that we have to have a will to do that he had a will to stand there wide to make him king notice the difference in these ministries the difference in the way it operated in these men here was a great man who stood with a spear against 800. here was a man who had a sword and his hand claimed to his sword and the lord brought a great victory that day and the people were turned after him only to spoil verse 11 after him was shamma the son of aegee the heroic and the philistines were gathered together into a troop where there was a piece of ground full of lentils that barley and the people fled from the philistines but he stood in the midst of the ground and defended it these other men maybe they got to go out and evangelize but this man stood in the midst of the ground through his position right in the midst of the barley he wasn't the greatest but he was needed he stood in the midst of the ground and defended it and slew the philistines and the lord wrought a great victory and these were the the chief men now these three men were special it says because three of the thirty chief went down and came to david in the harvest time into the cave of adullam that's the time when david was at his lowest point it's a time when he was being rejected by from all sides these men come down to see how he was spend some time with him when they got down there and begin to be around him see you've got to be around him to know what it is that you can do for him before you can be a real servant of the king you got to spend time in his presence and that's why brother branham taught us as ministers to shut ourselves off and take time away from everybody for a while before the service because while we do that we come out and and somebody new may not understand that but we come out when the they call us out because we want to take even if it's just a few minutes time to get along with god because you learn what he wants when you get near him right now they come down and the troop of the philistines patched in the pitch in the valley of rephain and david was then in the hold and the garrison of the philistines was then in bethlehem he was in the cave of a dolan a stronghold and david longed david longed it was a private moment but they were near enough to him by the jt that they could know what he what he desired god help me to be close enough to him see peter james and john i don't we don't know exactly why but somehow they become close enough to jesus that when the time come for him to go up to gethsemane he had him come with him maybe the others had things to do we don't know but he had them come they were close enough they leaned on his muslim and david long said oh that one would give me drink of the water the well of bethlehem which is by the gate brother branham does such a masterful job of preaching on this and they're talking about in during that sermon of why little bethlehem he said david in all his frustrations walking back and forth thinking oh this hot day he said oh it's so hot oh saul might come from this way the philistines from this way armies around everywhere and here we are sitting in the mouth of a cave and yet the anointing oil on me how can it be oh god how can it be oh i wish i had a drink and his mind goes back to way down there by the gates of bethlehem there was a well there was just no water like that water he said now his throat is going yet anointed he said oh if i only had a drink of water now his warriors he screamed out on his despair oh someone would bring me a drink again from that old well yonder at bethlehem he said oh after dreaming all of his childhood days and the victories and see him in the place where he's sitting here between the fires he screamed oh somebody could bring me water from bethlehem he didn't pick those men out to do it but they were there they were close somebody bring me a drink remember he's a type of christ he's a type of christ once you've had a drink of bethlehem is the water you don't want nothing else you see when jesus died and and he brought his spirit back on the on the third day and then he come on the day of pentecost and and separated himself into the hearts of the 120 men and women that were there and when he did they become his body and they began to offer to god the kind of fellowship that he'd never had before think about that even when he was with adam it was god and adam but now it was god in his people think about that he'd never had this kind of fellowship with human beings that he could come down and live in them redeemed bodies amen he could fellowship his brother brandon put it with his thoughts in a way that he couldn't had never been able to do before and so he's fellowshipping with them in such a way that when they went out even they passed by in the shadow of peter people would get healed they would go by and they would say silver and gold have i numb but such as i have i give and a lame men got up and walked in their services there was such a passion for god and such a a worship that would go up we don't know exactly what they had i don't know if they had drums i don't know if they had an organ or piano what they had i don't know what they have but i know this they worshipped they worshipped there was something about it they met in caves and they were persecuted and they they met in any place they could meet they wanted to be together they defied death to be together why because they wanted to worship god so we we should forgive people who you know if let me just tell you the heart as a pastor you know i hate i don't want to tell anybody not to come to church it goes against everything in my thinking i'll forgive people for wanting to come to church and messing up it's easy to forgive people like that maybe come to church when they shouldn't the problem you have is with people who don't come to church when they should but but but regardless it's you know because it's in our heart it's not something god they make us do it's not something that jesus made them do but he was in their hearts so they gathered together in spite of persecution and trouble and i know i'm not saying anything i'm the one that said stay home if you're sick and we have to do that but listen we have to communicate with god and we at some point we have to fellowship with one another we have to because there's a desire in our heart to do it he had a drink of that jesus that spirit that was when we got to fellowship with them in such a way purity of the word purity of spirit but it wasn't long until that church lost their first love the antichrist began to work immediately that church lost their first love the little bride that he had began to be spotted by denominationalism by man over man nicoleton teaching so now david's the type of christ david christ said oh that you would give me a drink oh then i would have a drink and the three mighty men break through the hosts of the philistines and drew water out of the well of bethlehem that was by the gate and took it and brought it to david and david wouldn't drink it but he poured it out into the lord which is a type again of christ amen jesus cried i thirst but he wouldn't drink he poured out his spirit on the day of pentecost what was it it was a desire that he had think about it he has not had that kind of fellowship listen to me now from that time until recently i hope we appreciate the message of the hour i hope we understand why the prophet said behold i send you elijah to turn the hearts of the children back to those pentecostal fathers very bad because elijah's message come to turn us back so he could have that drink again amen he looked for it all to the church ages he longed for it but elijah's message come to turn our hearts back he put a sword in his hand didn't he do it supernatural the word the king's sword put a sword in his hand what for to fight for the water are you with me now and brother said look at these men what were they doing they were making david king one day he'll be king he'll be on the earth but just for one service i want to make him feel like a king again are you with me this morning i want to make him feel like a king again i wanted i want him to know what it's like to have people waiting on him and listening for his very desire and to have it brought to him i want him to taste that pentecostal water again he said look at these men they pulled their swords what was it his desire was a drink of cool water he said david what a type today of our david christ amen it was they pulled their shorts notice he said we know he's called a holy roller he's cast off to one side a fanatic and everything rejected by the churches they've got their creeds and things drawn up this christmas he preached this at christmas time and this is from 1963 he preached the message twice but in 1963 he said we know that he said but we know that this word ever remains true he said it's got to be fulfilled and the desire of christ is for men warriors to stand and the prophet in our day stood up was given a sword right say well let him do it you know you know it might have been i don't know maybe the chief among them stood up because that's kind of man he was stood up i got a sword another man looked around and said well he i don't want him to go down there by himself this is what david really wants i got a sword another man said well i got a bucket somebody had to carry a bucket somebody got carry the water so they oh my he said they pulled their swords and that's the desire of christ for men warriors to stand he said oh come stand with me by my side he's not just talking to preachers he's talking to you he's talking to me somebody will stand by his side we're not standing by the side of this message we don't but we don't stand here to make brother branham king we stand here to make jesus king and we do that by following the prophet of the age the message that he brought because god gave him a sword now he said draw your swords amen hallelujah it may not have been their idea but they were sure willing to help out amen now look he said oh come stand with me by my side i'm standing in a terrible place listen i don't stand here because i want to preempt brother bryan i'm gonna take him out of the pulpit but i'm standing here because he's he's stood in a terrible place i want to stand with him and if that's not our desire if our desire is to make our own kingdom we might as well shut the doors because the baptists have a bigger kingdom and the methodists have a bigger kingdom and the catholics have a bigger kingdom we just go join them and they got 401ks and everything to go with it i mean not bad but there's many message preachers maybe not all of us but some of them that are really good they could probably go preach in another church you know preaching the message because that's where they make the most money you know you didn't join the or become a part of this church because you just like it was easy to go here because it requires more of you than than just being anywhere you want to be there's more required of those who would stand with him in this day but he said oh come stand with me by my side i'm standing in a terrible place i challenge today he said these tapes go over the world i challenge some man some warrior who loves jesus christ we got anybody here today lord jesus christ you there watching today do you love jesus christ then stand with the prophet of the hour stand with him amen he said that knows that these things has got to be fulfilled today brethren come stand by my side and pull the word of god forget these tried systems and stagnated denominations you're living in pull the fresh word of god he said let's give jesus a good drink a fresh pentecostal water that's his desire today back to original pentecost back to the word in the heat of the battle in the in the heat of laodicea that the word cries out oh for a drink amen the word cries out all for a drink of the water of bethlehem and there's some soldiers who'll stand there with the prophet of the hour and say i'll be one who will fight for him amen i'll fight with the prophet and i'll fight to make david king are you with me now because that's what he fought for now look that's his desire today he said it's prophesied that we do so amen it's prophesied we do so in malachi the fourth chapter return the faith of the children back to the fathers again who would stand this morning like david we know that david is coming into power jesus christ is going to take the world he inherits the earth he is going to be king over the earth he's rejected today he's a fugitive among his people of course he's a fugitive to the world always was but today he's a fugitive to his own church they reject him they love their creeds and big dignitaries instead of the word do you realize if it was put to a popular vote the word would lose in every municipality and every state in every country in the world if you put it to a popular vote no one will stand with him but he's still going to be king amen you see there's a garrison of philistines around the word today said they he said they won't let it be manifested he said they won't let it be preached in its power they've cut away from it just like the bible said they do in revelation 17. he said what are they going to do going up here today and all going in this council of churches catholicism and protestantism uniting together making the mark in the image of the beast and then on down he says oh you bethlehem dwellers hallelujah i call for men warriors is not afraid i don't care if there's 800 standing on one side 10 000 on the others the other i want warriors who will come with me amen and cut a hole through this sign of unbelieving philistines the world council has got garrisoned around the word of god trying to make it creeds and feed the people where's the man who could pull his sword and stand there with a prophet of the hour it's hard to do because men begin to strengthen themselves and begin to think hey i killed 800 at one time maybe i ought to be king hey i stood in the midst of the barley i've been here for 40 years maybe i ought to be king no their desire was to make him king amen god help us today he said there's a well you believe there's still a well today there's a well there's a fountain open in the house of david bethlehem for sin and uncleanliness brother he said sin is unbelief in his word who's the warrior that can see the millennium coming amen amen remember what jesus said he said when you see all these sites coming on the earth he said in the beginning of sorrow said you begin to see the birth pains coming on he said when you begin to see these sayings he said look up lift up your hands your redemption draweth die who's the warrior that can see the millennium coming people see riots they see trouble they see strife they see plagues we see the millennium coming amen there's a warrior that can see the millennium coming what warrior can see this great holy spirit come in the form of jesus christ oh my you don't need a bunch of people to be able to feel the spirit of god this morning we don't need a a house full to be able to know that he's still god oh why because we've got an innumerable company of angels amen there's more with us than be with them what warrior this morning could see the millennium coming and brother brown then told us worship him now as if you're already in this place as if you're already in that place what warrior can see the millennium coming what warrior can see this great holy spirit come in the form of jesus christ the literal body of christ brother that's what believers believe the literal body of christ amen to take over again stand with me amen stand by me he says what a call from the messenger of the hour stand by me let's cut a hole through this denominational creed let's get in there he's crying for a good fresh drink a pentecostal water he said original pentecost original pentecost not a bunch of carrying on screaming hollering here he said i mean a genuine holy spirit baptism that produces the life of jesus christ back into the person he had a drink like that with 120 that come from the upper room but that seed had to fall into the ground and die to produce another another fruit another bride tree a restoration of the bride tree that we could come today and give him a drink i'm closing sister mayor if you'd come and i appreciate sister mary playing the piano today we've lord's worked it out where every service even with all the troubles we've had we've had someone to play and i appreciate that they had to cooperate to make david king if you haven't heard anything else i've said today hear this they had to cooperate with one another to make david king one of them had to put down his sword just carry a bucket probably to make him king they couldn't say well i'll go this way you go that way no they fought together i took all three of them the the chief captain and the one standing with him and that's why brother brown said stand by me stand by me there's got to be somebody who will represent at this hour and stand for the word that he preached somebody's got to do that stand by me pick up your swords if you can't pick up a sword carry a bucket stand by me he deserves to have a drink a pentecostal water stand by me he said because christ deserves to drink we want to make him king it's not my church or yours let's make him king who is willing to take a sword and cooperate sometimes to make him king you've got to be willing to make yourself less sometimes to make him king you've got to lay down your own ministries and say lord what would you have me do your own talents your own desires what would you have me do lord where would you have me live where would you have me work where do you want me to go to church where where do you want me to you realize that we're making him king it's not just well i'll i'll take this job because because it'll be more money but it'll keep me out of church but but we've got to make him king i'll i'll go over here because it's more happy and i feel the spirit but we ought to feel the spirit but we want to make him king make him king in our lives what will it take that may not be coming here maybe going somewhere else it may be staying right where you're at standing in the middle of your field but you've got to make him king we're living in too late of a time when church is closing all around us because of this going on we're living in too late of time to be fighting one another let's make him king let's not fuss about who gets to carry the bucket who gets to carry the sword let's make him king heavenly father if you could play i cast all my cares upon you if you know that heavenly father we love you want to give you a drink lord i kind of sobered up here at the end because on purpose lord because i want us to get it [Music] i want us to understand we've got to work together maybe maybe we don't like how certain things are done but god we're not here to pet our feelings we're not here to feel better about ourselves we're here to make you king lord oh god help us to lay aside every way [Music] let us let us say aside every fatter lord that everything that would so easily every sin that would so easily beset us and help us to make you king we don't know these men served david with all their heart and all their life and they never had the notoriety that david did but i don't want notoriety the greatest thing you can say about a servant is he made his lord famous oh god [Music] lord may we be in a way as your bride lord may we be like that virtuous woman in proverbs who did all these things to make her husband famous in the gate oh god it speaks of more than just a natural woman but lord of your bride we could make you famous lord [Music] are we we want you to be able in this hour to have a drink the world may never see it but we want people lord that even look at them maybe they don't agree with it they can look at our lives and see there's a people who exist solely to make jesus king even in that first age with all the persecution and all the all the trouble that goes on went on around them oh lord during that time they were so like you that they called
