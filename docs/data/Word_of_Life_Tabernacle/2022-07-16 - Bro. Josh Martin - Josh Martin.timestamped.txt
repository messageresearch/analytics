[1:02:57] they've said to themselves if i can just
[1:03:00] get away
[1:03:02] to a quiet place all alone
[1:03:07] and while they're looking for a way
[1:03:10] to get out of town

[1:03:24] crowd stands alone

[1:04:18] and hate conquers love that a man in the
[1:04:22] crowd
[1:04:23] stands alone

[1:11:08] lord for that
[1:11:09] amen i've enjoyed the the past two
[1:11:12] sermons they've been wonderful i've been
[1:11:14] blessed by them have you all enjoyed
[1:11:15] them so far
[1:11:17] amen isaiah 59 and 19 before we read
[1:11:20] let's bow our heads
[1:11:22] dear heavenly father we want to thank
[1:11:24] you for your grace and your mercy lord
[1:11:26] god we've lord we've got so much out of
[1:11:28] the last couple services lord but this
[1:11:30] is a new service another opportunity and
[1:11:33] i asked lord that you would anoint me
[1:11:35] father as i lay myself aside speak
[1:11:37] through these lips of clay lord you see
[1:11:39] the needs that are in this building
[1:11:40] father the desires of the heart i ask
[1:11:43] lord that the word would go and meet the
[1:11:44] need father minister to the hearts of
[1:11:46] your people
[1:11:48] lord may you may the congregation leave
[1:11:50] themselves aside father and and receive
[1:11:52] the words of life this morning we ask
[1:11:54] these things in your precious name
[1:11:56] amen
[1:11:57] in isaiah 59 and 19
[1:11:59] so shall they fear the name of the lord
[1:12:01] from the west and his glory from the
[1:12:03] rising of the sun
[1:12:05] when the enemy shall come in like a
[1:12:07] flood the spirit of the lord shall lift
[1:12:09] up a standard against it amen you may be
[1:12:12] seated this morning
[1:12:14] it's got a simple subject this morning
[1:12:16] but if i had a title it would be a
[1:12:18] standard raised by the message and i
[1:12:20] want to start out by saying that this
[1:12:22] message ain't just for the adults it
[1:12:25] ain't just for the elders too many times
[1:12:27] we get in our in our minds you know
[1:12:30] me growing up i always thought the
[1:12:31] message was just for the preachers just
[1:12:33] for the adults just just for the the
[1:12:35] parents but this message ain't just for
[1:12:36] the adults but it's for a young people
[1:12:39] there's somebody on earth that's being a
[1:12:41] light at school and somebody on earth
[1:12:43] being a light at the job site there's
[1:12:45] somebody on earth that's proclaiming the
[1:12:48] life of jesus christ but i like how the
[1:12:50] bible puts that the enemy shall come in
[1:12:53] like a flood he's saying and not maybe
[1:12:55] so not not a hope so not not if the
[1:12:58] devil gets lucky but the enemy is going
[1:13:00] to come in
[1:13:01] like a flood but it didn't just stop
[1:13:03] there he says the enemy is going to come
[1:13:05] in but at the same time the spirit of
[1:13:08] the lord shall raise up a standard so it
[1:13:11] may look dark it may look bleak it may
[1:13:13] look impossible to live an overcoming
[1:13:16] life it may look impossible to live a
[1:13:18] victorious life but god's promise that
[1:13:20] there's going to be a power in this last
[1:13:22] day to rise above sin rise above lay out
[1:13:26] us here and i believe there's some young
[1:13:28] people today those proclaiming that this
[1:13:31] scripture is coming to pass in this last
[1:13:34] day this wasn't speaking of days gone by
[1:13:37] but it was speaking of this day this is
[1:13:39] the most evil day the most wickedest day
[1:13:42] but there's still somebody living a pure
[1:13:44] life an unadulterated life it's somebody
[1:13:48] on earth thus proclaiming the life of
[1:13:50] jesus christ you see the brother branham
[1:13:52] says there's going to be two spirits at
[1:13:54] work in this last day the spirit of god
[1:13:57] and the spirit of antichrist the spirit
[1:14:00] of the antichrist and both of these
[1:14:01] spirits are coming for your life for
[1:14:04] your mind for your body and you're going
[1:14:07] to give heed to one of those spirits and
[1:14:10] produce the actions of those spirits you
[1:14:13] look up you look at the world today
[1:14:15] there's evil but the way evil is known
[1:14:17] today is by summoning somebody producing
[1:14:20] evil somebody's life is smoking they're
[1:14:23] drinking they're doing these things
[1:14:25] their life is producing the spirit that
[1:14:28] they're under but if the spirit of the
[1:14:30] devil can cause somebody to commit
[1:14:33] suicide if the spirit of the devil can
[1:14:35] cause somebody to pierce their ears and
[1:14:38] to put tattoos on their body what will
[1:14:40] the spirit of christ do in a young
[1:14:42] people that surrendered oh come on
[1:14:44] somebody i don't believe we got to be
[1:14:46] bound to pornography i don't gotta i
[1:14:48] don't believe we got to be bound to
[1:14:50] smoking and they're drinking but there's
[1:14:52] a power on earth that can take control
[1:14:55] of your life and you can produce the
[1:14:58] actions of jesus christ but we gotta
[1:15:01] surrender to one of those spirits but
[1:15:04] you see this antichrist spirit is not
[1:15:07] just after it's not after the
[1:15:08] denominations he's already got him the
[1:15:10] methodists the baptists the pentecostals
[1:15:13] they're all consumed by their spirit but
[1:15:16] he's after the bride of jesus christ
[1:15:19] because you haven't pushed away the word
[1:15:21] of god but you've embraced the message
[1:15:23] of the hour that's why he's starting
[1:15:26] targeting your life you see brother
[1:15:28] branham says now remember this
[1:15:31] christ in the true church is a
[1:15:33] continuation of the book of acts notice
[1:15:35] how he says that the true church he's
[1:15:38] making a separation but the book of
[1:15:40] revelation shows how that the antichrist
[1:15:43] spirit will come into the church he's
[1:15:46] making a separation there's two spirits
[1:15:49] there's two groups but there's two
[1:15:51] different results the true church is
[1:15:53] coming under the spirit of christ and is
[1:15:56] producing another book of acts there's a
[1:16:00] power inside of the bride of christ to
[1:16:03] defeat everything the devil sins against
[1:16:06] us
[1:16:06] but i'm going to continue reading but
[1:16:08] the book of revelation shows how the
[1:16:10] antichrist spirit would come into the
[1:16:13] church defiling it making it lukewarm
[1:16:16] formal and powerless
[1:16:19] so there's two groups he's making a
[1:16:20] separation the church and the true
[1:16:23] church one of the message come to do it
[1:16:26] come to pull the true church out of the
[1:16:29] church brother branham says moses called
[1:16:31] a nation out of a nation that message
[1:16:34] made a separation and gave the children
[1:16:37] of israel an authority to march over the
[1:16:40] spirit that was inside of egypt and this
[1:16:44] message has given the bride of christ a
[1:16:46] group of young people the authority to
[1:16:49] march over the antichrist spirit that's
[1:16:52] proclaiming that it's real and it's
[1:16:54] proclaiming that it's powerful but
[1:16:56] there's a bribe that's resisting it and
[1:16:59] saying there's an authority inside of
[1:17:01] this message and i'm not going down
[1:17:04] defeated i'm rising up an overcomer i'm
[1:17:07] not going in the tribulation i'm going
[1:17:09] in the rapture i'm not going down but
[1:17:11] i'm going up
[1:17:13] but somebody's got
[1:17:15] somebody's gotta surrender itself to
[1:17:18] that spirit
[1:17:19] to revelation you see that the egyptians
[1:17:22] tried to follow the children of israel
[1:17:25] out of bondage
[1:17:27] but not everybody's gonna make this
[1:17:29] rapture the make-believers trying to
[1:17:31] make a rapture the unbelievers trying to
[1:17:33] make a rapture the hypocrites are trying
[1:17:36] to make a rapture but there's only one
[1:17:38] that's going in the rapture that's
[1:17:40] somebody that has surrendered themselves
[1:17:43] to the spirit of revelation which is
[1:17:46] coming by the message of the hour
[1:17:49] amen
[1:17:51] yes sir
[1:17:52] you see that the egyptians tried going
[1:17:55] through the red sea
[1:17:56] but they missed a step the only way to
[1:17:59] produce the message of that day was to
[1:18:02] come under the message
[1:18:06] i know this is a young people service
[1:18:08] but too many people is trying to produce
[1:18:11] the actions of the message without
[1:18:13] coming under the headship of the message
[1:18:16] come under the headship of the message
[1:18:18] and it'll produce an invincible army
[1:18:21] it'll produce more than a conqueror it
[1:18:24] will produce what god has for this last
[1:18:26] day
[1:18:27] you may say brother josh how do you come
[1:18:29] under the headship by surrendering your
[1:18:31] thoughts of what's right surrendering
[1:18:34] what you think and coming under the
[1:18:36] message and saying this message is my
[1:18:39] ultimate it may come against my thinking
[1:18:41] it may come against my ideas it may come
[1:18:44] against my reasoning but this message is
[1:18:47] the only way for a rapture so i'm going
[1:18:49] to come under the headship of the
[1:18:51] message
[1:18:52] so you see they tried going through the
[1:18:55] red sea but they missed the step the
[1:18:57] message says apply the token the message
[1:19:00] said apply the blood the message said
[1:19:03] but since they have their own ideas
[1:19:06] oh i'm going to preach this morning
[1:19:08] since they have their own thoughts they
[1:19:10] said no we don't need to do that
[1:19:12] i don't believe in that but i'm still
[1:19:14] going to go through the red sea
[1:19:16] but there was no power to overcome
[1:19:18] outside of the message of that day
[1:19:21] there's no power to overcome on the
[1:19:24] outside of the message for this thing
[1:19:26] you may say but the josh i don't believe
[1:19:28] that well the baptist is reading the
[1:19:30] same bible you're reading the
[1:19:31] pentecostals are reading reading the
[1:19:33] same bible you're reading the baptists
[1:19:36] are reading the same bible as your
[1:19:38] reading but they're not producing an
[1:19:40] overcoming life
[1:19:41] they don't know what it means
[1:19:43] they're under the wrong spirit but the
[1:19:45] message of the yahweh come to say no
[1:19:48] this is man's ideas or they say there's
[1:19:51] three gods but that's wrong
[1:19:53] they say do this but that's wrong the
[1:19:55] message come to pull you out of man's
[1:19:58] ideas and give you god's interpretation
[1:20:01] you see man's ideas ain't going gonna
[1:20:03] produce a rapture man's ideas ain't
[1:20:05] gonna produce a body change but the
[1:20:07] message of the hour will produce a body
[1:20:10] change produce a rapture produce a
[1:20:13] future home that's why i believe it's
[1:20:16] sticking with the message
[1:20:19] you may say brother josh that's just for
[1:20:20] the grown-ups i'm a young person that's
[1:20:23] come under the message and i can see
[1:20:26] what the power of this message will do
[1:20:28] in a 13 year old boy's life a 15 year
[1:20:31] old boy's life i don't care what age
[1:20:33] you're at
[1:20:34] the message can work through your life
[1:20:36] i was feeling the car to preach at 12
[1:20:38] years old and i was praying and asking
[1:20:40] the lord what to do and something spoke
[1:20:42] to my heart get into the message
[1:20:45] 12 years old that wasn't a boy's mind
[1:20:48] that wasn't a voice thinking that wasn't
[1:20:50] a boy's reasoning that was the call of
[1:20:53] god on my life saying you've got a
[1:20:55] purpose on her and the way to fulfill
[1:20:57] that purpose is to get in the message of
[1:21:00] the hour
[1:21:01] and you've got a purpose on your life
[1:21:04] every one of you have a calling but you
[1:21:07] got to come under the message of the
[1:21:08] hour so that that calling can be
[1:21:11] fulfilled
[1:21:14] you see moses had a calling on his life
[1:21:16] too
[1:21:17] but he couldn't fulfill it
[1:21:19] until he met the back side of the desert
[1:21:21] but the pillar of fire and i believe we
[1:21:23] got the pillar of fire on this last day
[1:21:25] that is commissioning us what to do you
[1:21:28] see moses trying to fulfill that calling
[1:21:30] in his own ability and he killed one
[1:21:32] egyptian
[1:21:33] there was no power inside of just his
[1:21:36] calling to fulfill the word he was
[1:21:39] prophesied he was elected he was he was
[1:21:42] ordained to be there but until he met
[1:21:45] the pillar of fire which gave him his
[1:21:47] commission he couldn't fulfill his
[1:21:49] purpose and until you meet the pillar of
[1:21:52] fire which is given the message of the
[1:21:54] hour you can't fulfill your purpose
[1:21:58] hope that's okay this morning but once
[1:22:00] he came under the pillar of fire heated
[1:22:02] to his commission oh you know what i
[1:22:05] like about the story was the pillar of
[1:22:07] fire was speaking out of the burning
[1:22:09] bush and it was quoting scripture it
[1:22:11] says i have
[1:22:12] i have heard the cries of my people and
[1:22:14] i've come to deliver them which was a
[1:22:16] scriptural promise
[1:22:18] so now we got scripture then there was
[1:22:20] the pillar of fire which is the holy
[1:22:22] ghost but did you this didn't just stop
[1:22:25] there but then a message came forth
[1:22:29] the message was proclaiming what the
[1:22:30] scripture was saying for that day
[1:22:33] we didn't just have a scripture a
[1:22:36] promise in this day but we got a message
[1:22:39] to proclaim that that scriptural promise
[1:22:42] can be fulfilled amen oh i hope this is
[1:22:45] okay this morning
[1:22:47] hallelujah but once he came under his
[1:22:49] commission there was no devil could
[1:22:51] stand in his way
[1:22:53] there was no there was no there was
[1:22:54] nothing that could stand in his way he
[1:22:56] came up with boldness he was a coward he
[1:22:59] was running away from the egyptians but
[1:23:01] once he come under the commission that
[1:23:04] god had for his life
[1:23:06] he wasn't a coward no more but he knew
[1:23:09] there was a greater authority backing
[1:23:11] him up
[1:23:12] and he would go up to pharaoh and say
[1:23:14] let my people go i don't care what
[1:23:17] you're saying i don't care what your
[1:23:19] strong codes are i've been commissioned
[1:23:22] to proclaim there's a liberty for the
[1:23:25] people of god
[1:23:26] and if there's somebody that can hear
[1:23:28] the commission this morning the message
[1:23:30] of the hour is saying you don't got to
[1:23:33] be bound no longer you don't got to be
[1:23:35] shackled no longer but your commission
[1:23:37] is to rise up more than a conqueror
[1:23:40] through christ jesus
[1:23:43] oh hallelujah but it was only under the
[1:23:46] message of moses you see god would speak
[1:23:49] through prophets throughout the old
[1:23:51] testament the way the people would hear
[1:23:53] god was through the prophets the bible
[1:23:55] says let me find the scripture here the
[1:23:58] bible would say that god spoke through
[1:23:59] prophets in ii peter first and 20
[1:24:02] knowing this first that no prophecy of
[1:24:05] scripture is of any private
[1:24:07] interpretation for the prophecy came not
[1:24:10] in old time by the will of man
[1:24:14] so it was flawed human beings bringing
[1:24:17] forth a message to the people it wasn't
[1:24:20] their own thoughts it wasn't the will of
[1:24:22] man but it was god relying his thoughts
[1:24:26] to a prophet then he would preach those
[1:24:28] words preach those thoughts you know
[1:24:30] what is a word it's a thought expressed
[1:24:33] so it was the thoughts of god then it
[1:24:35] would come into a prophet then it was a
[1:24:38] word but then that word had to
[1:24:40] materialize
[1:24:42] the word had to materialize so whenever
[1:24:46] moses said uh or whenever noah says
[1:24:48] there's going to be a flood
[1:24:50] it was the thoughts of god then it came
[1:24:52] unto the prophet and he spoke then it
[1:24:55] was the word of god then the word was
[1:24:57] going to materialize they didn't know
[1:25:00] when it was going to materialize but
[1:25:01] they just know if they stuck with the
[1:25:04] message it was going to materialize
[1:25:07] you look at uh you look at jonah jonah
[1:25:10] went up and he says repent or perish it
[1:25:12] was a thought then it came to the
[1:25:14] prophet then it was a word
[1:25:17] then the word started to materialize
[1:25:20] hope you're open you're you're following
[1:25:22] me this morning
[1:25:23] moses it was a thought then it came a
[1:25:26] word then the word started to
[1:25:28] materialize what i'm saying is it was
[1:25:31] the thoughts of god that came over
[1:25:33] william branham a prophet and he spoke
[1:25:36] the word and now it's materializing in a
[1:25:39] group of young people
[1:25:42] there's been thoughts for this last day
[1:25:44] that says you're more than a conqueror
[1:25:46] the gates of hell won't prevail against
[1:25:48] you but you will prevail against them
[1:25:51] those were thoughts now it's a word and
[1:25:53] now it's being materialized right here
[1:25:56] in a group of young people there's no
[1:25:59] devil there's no hell there's no spirit
[1:26:01] no antichrist spirit can keep you bound
[1:26:05] when you come under the thoughts of god
[1:26:10] come under the thoughts of god and it
[1:26:12] will produce the thoughts for this day
[1:26:15] oh you look at hattie wright
[1:26:17] hattie wright was hearing the thoughts
[1:26:19] of god brother branham was speaking of
[1:26:21] the third pool and too many people keep
[1:26:23] the third pool with the prophet but
[1:26:25] that's not the case that wasn't the
[1:26:28] thoughts of god the thoughts of god was
[1:26:30] for you to speak to this mountain
[1:26:33] then the thoughts of god came to a
[1:26:35] prophet then he proclaimed the word so
[1:26:38] he was speaking of the squirrels that he
[1:26:40] spoke into existence
[1:26:41] and howdy wright was hearing the story
[1:26:44] hearing the testimony hearing the
[1:26:45] thoughts of god come forth and she says
[1:26:48] my that's nothing but the truth that's
[1:26:51] not just for the prophet that's for me
[1:26:54] the knowledge certainly the same
[1:26:55] inspiration that was on the prophet came
[1:26:58] upon howdy right and let me shame they
[1:27:01] say this the same inspiration that came
[1:27:04] on malachi 4 the broader message is the
[1:27:07] same inspiration that can come on a
[1:27:09] group of young people and produce and
[1:27:12] manifest the message
[1:27:15] that malachi 4 broad you're not a
[1:27:18] powerless army you're not a powerless
[1:27:21] group of young people but you're more
[1:27:23] than conquerors through christ jesus
[1:27:26] through the message of the hour
[1:27:29] and so howdy writes this that's nothing
[1:27:31] but the truth
[1:27:33] there's something on the inside that's
[1:27:35] calling to me that's what the message
[1:27:38] does
[1:27:39] there's a seed on the inside we know but
[1:27:40] the random says only the elected can see
[1:27:43] this message
[1:27:45] so there's a seed on the inside that
[1:27:47] says that's nothing but the truth
[1:27:49] brother branham turned around and he
[1:27:51] says you speak the words
[1:27:54] so no longer was this ministry just with
[1:27:56] brother branham but the same authority
[1:27:59] that brother branham had was now given
[1:28:02] to hattie wright under his message
[1:28:07] and so howdy right you see the the the
[1:28:09] simplicity of hattie wright she looked
[1:28:10] at brother branham and says what do i
[1:28:12] say
[1:28:13] what do i ask for
[1:28:15] she wasn't looking for money she wasn't
[1:28:18] looking for prestige
[1:28:19] but she was looking for something that
[1:28:22] that that only only god could give her
[1:28:25] and so brother branham says you ask for
[1:28:27] a million dollars and it'll be right
[1:28:28] here
[1:28:29] you speak the the healing for your
[1:28:31] sister and it'll happen and she stopped
[1:28:34] and her boys were laughing at her there
[1:28:36] was two boys her two sons were laughing
[1:28:38] and making fun
[1:28:40] and she stopped and he says i want the
[1:28:42] salvation of my two boys
[1:28:44] and right there they were snickering
[1:28:46] they were laughing they were making fun
[1:28:48] they were in shackles but the mess has
[1:28:51] produced an authority you want to see
[1:28:53] your your kids safe stick with the
[1:28:55] message
[1:28:57] your opinions ain't going to get your
[1:28:59] kids safe
[1:29:00] your ideas ain't going to get your kids
[1:29:02] paid
[1:29:03] keep whip this a message and you'll see
[1:29:06] your young people become an invincible
[1:29:09] army
[1:29:10] marching over sin merchant over
[1:29:12] pornography marching over complexes
[1:29:14] merchant over anxiety there's an
[1:29:16] authority inside of this message
[1:29:20] young people you want to rise in power
[1:29:22] get inside of this message
[1:29:26] like i said this message ain't just for
[1:29:27] adults it's for young people
[1:29:30] but somebody's got to get into the
[1:29:32] message listen to the tapes
[1:29:35] study it for yourself i wasn't going off
[1:29:38] my daddy's revelation i was studying
[1:29:40] myself at 12 years old 13 years old 14
[1:29:44] years old and i can say as a witness
[1:29:47] this message has an authority to keep my
[1:29:50] life and it has an authority to keep
[1:29:52] your life
[1:29:53] under the message of the hour
[1:29:57] so all of a sudden those boys were
[1:29:59] laughing and snickering
[1:30:01] but they didn't realize the devil didn't
[1:30:04] realize that there was an authority
[1:30:06] being released to a parent
[1:30:10] the devil may think he's got you bound
[1:30:12] he may think you're shackled and on your
[1:30:14] way to hell but he don't realize that
[1:30:17] you've got some godly parents
[1:30:19] that's not under man's interpretation
[1:30:21] but is under the message of the hour
[1:30:25] and let me say this you may think you're
[1:30:27] having a great time out in the world you
[1:30:29] may think you're partying and having a
[1:30:31] great time but there's going to come a
[1:30:33] time where god's going to get a hold of
[1:30:35] your life
[1:30:36] and so you might as well save yourself
[1:30:38] some trouble and just give your life to
[1:30:40] christ
[1:30:42] because if you're elected god's going to
[1:30:44] get a hold of your life
[1:30:46] those boys tried everything they could
[1:30:48] do to resist the calling of god you may
[1:30:51] try to resist the calling you may sit
[1:30:53] here and say no i don't believe none of
[1:30:55] that but if god's got a calling on your
[1:30:58] life
[1:30:59] he's going to make sure you fulfill it
[1:31:02] then those boys fell over the moment's
[1:31:04] lap crying
[1:31:06] weeping what happened somebody come
[1:31:09] under the message and that produced an
[1:31:11] authority
[1:31:14] hope this is okay this morning
[1:31:16] you see you look at isaiah isaiah
[1:31:19] proclaimed a prophecy a prophecy and
[1:31:22] says a virgin is going to conceive
[1:31:24] and that was 400 years later that was a
[1:31:27] thought then it become a word through a
[1:31:29] prophet but there was going to come a
[1:31:30] time where that word was materialized it
[1:31:33] didn't matter what time how long it took
[1:31:36] if god said it was going to happen god
[1:31:38] was going to make sure it comes to pass
[1:31:41] you know we've heard it many times
[1:31:42] where's the rapture going to happen
[1:31:44] you've been preaching that for all these
[1:31:45] years it don't matter how long it's
[1:31:47] going to take god has pronounced his
[1:31:50] thoughts in this day it's going to
[1:31:52] materialize one of these days
[1:31:55] and so there came mary
[1:31:57] and you know what happened there was an
[1:31:59] angel a messenger that came to mary
[1:32:02] and started to pronounce scripture
[1:32:05] you look at when gabriel visited mary
[1:32:07] she was pronouncing there was probably
[1:32:09] 10 scriptures in his message he was he
[1:32:12] was a he was a given to her then he
[1:32:14] stops and he says you're going to have a
[1:32:17] baby so it no longer was just scripture
[1:32:20] but now it was a prophecy it was a
[1:32:23] message pronouncing that scripture was
[1:32:25] about to come to pass
[1:32:27] but it wasn't just message and bible but
[1:32:30] now was the holy ghost
[1:32:32] she says how can this be i know no man
[1:32:35] then the angel stops and he says the
[1:32:37] holy ghost is going to overshadow you
[1:32:39] you want to produce the word of god for
[1:32:41] this day
[1:32:42] there's the scripture the message which
[1:32:45] backs up scripture or the the scripture
[1:32:47] backs up the message then the holy ghost
[1:32:49] starts to produce it
[1:32:52] just like moses moses had the scripture
[1:32:54] have the message and the pillar of fire
[1:32:57] just like mary had scripture the message
[1:33:01] and the holy ghost what do we have in
[1:33:03] this day we got scripture the message
[1:33:05] comes out of scripture and we've got the
[1:33:08] holy ghost to make it live
[1:33:13] oh hallelujah
[1:33:14] and there was nobody that could keep
[1:33:17] that word from coming to pass
[1:33:19] there was no critic she was criticized
[1:33:21] she was made fun of but she was given a
[1:33:24] promise to produce the word for this day
[1:33:26] for that day you may be criticized you
[1:33:29] may be made fun of but you've been given
[1:33:32] a promise to produce the word for this
[1:33:35] day amen
[1:33:37] hallelujah
[1:33:38] well you look at you look at hope it's
[1:33:40] okay this morning you look at jesus
[1:33:42] jesus had a word concerning his life he
[1:33:45] was on earth to fulfill scriptural
[1:33:47] prophecy that was the only only reason
[1:33:50] he was on earth and the devil thought he
[1:33:52] could destroy the purpose in his life
[1:33:55] and so what happened herod says i'm
[1:33:57] going to destroy all the baby boys what
[1:33:59] was he doing destroying the young people
[1:34:02] he was trying to destroy the young
[1:34:04] people because they was the one
[1:34:06] fulfilling scripture
[1:34:08] why is the devil after the young people
[1:34:10] because you're the next generation of
[1:34:12] lawyers that's going to fulfill
[1:34:14] scripture
[1:34:17] but there was no devil as they as
[1:34:18] herod's uh as the army was going through
[1:34:21] the houses destroying baby boys jesus
[1:34:24] couldn't be destroyed
[1:34:25] he had a purpose for his life
[1:34:27] he had a calling on his life
[1:34:30] oh whenever whenever the the scraps and
[1:34:32] the pharisees were going to push him off
[1:34:34] the mountain remember and he disappeared
[1:34:36] they couldn't destroy him he had a
[1:34:38] purpose for his life
[1:34:40] god was going to make sure that his
[1:34:42] purpose wasn't going to be destroyed
[1:34:45] you may say wow he was invincible yeah
[1:34:47] so are you
[1:34:49] you've got a purpose on your life for
[1:34:51] this day just like jesus was invincible
[1:34:55] he couldn't be destroyed until his
[1:34:57] purpose was fulfilled you can't be
[1:34:59] destroyed until your purpose is
[1:35:02] fulfilled
[1:35:06] oh hallelujah you look at moses and go
[1:35:09] back to moses moses had a prophecy had
[1:35:12] up for his life and you notice he had
[1:35:14] some god-fearing parents brother branham
[1:35:17] says that an angel came to a jockey bed
[1:35:20] i believe the father and says you're
[1:35:22] going to have a son he's going to be the
[1:35:23] deliverer and so there was a godly
[1:35:26] parent there that didn't believe he was
[1:35:28] given serpent seed
[1:35:30] dad always told us that growing up
[1:35:32] god didn't give me serpent seed but god
[1:35:35] has a calling on your life
[1:35:37] and i believe there's still some parents
[1:35:39] today that's believing the same thing
[1:35:42] god hasn't given me serpenty
[1:35:44] but god has given me somebody that's
[1:35:47] elected for this day
[1:35:51] yes sir and so as the soldiers the same
[1:35:54] thing happened in jesus day pharaoh knew
[1:35:57] that there was a next generation rising
[1:35:59] up that was going to overpower him one
[1:36:01] day
[1:36:02] so what did he do he went out to destroy
[1:36:04] the next generation just like the devil
[1:36:07] knows there's the next generation of
[1:36:09] warriors rising up that's going to
[1:36:12] destroy his kingdom that's why he
[1:36:14] pornographies on the rampage
[1:36:16] lust and smoking and drinking at
[1:36:19] complexes he knows you're the next
[1:36:21] generation of warriors what happened
[1:36:25] what would have happened if all the
[1:36:26] mamas and daddies passed away if all the
[1:36:28] kids all the all the boys were destroyed
[1:36:31] there wouldn't have been the next
[1:36:32] generation so whenever mama and daddy
[1:36:34] passed away the children of israel would
[1:36:37] have become extinct
[1:36:39] there would have been no longer and so
[1:36:41] their wedding those scriptural
[1:36:42] prophecies concerning their life
[1:36:45] wouldn't have come to pass
[1:36:47] if there wasn't a next generation to
[1:36:49] fulfill them
[1:36:50] hope you're catching me this morning
[1:36:52] there's prophecies for this day the
[1:36:54] devil knows if mama and daddy go off the
[1:36:56] scene and you're not alive still by the
[1:36:59] holy ghost there's not going to be a
[1:37:01] next generation of warriors but i
[1:37:03] believe there's some young people that's
[1:37:05] not coming under that spirit that is
[1:37:07] under another spirit and see i'm here
[1:37:10] for a purpose
[1:37:11] and that's to be the next generation of
[1:37:14] warriors
[1:37:17] and so what happened they created an ark
[1:37:19] they put a little ark together and put
[1:37:20] moses in it and pushed him off in the
[1:37:23] nile river but the branham says god sent
[1:37:25] a thousand angels to make sure he
[1:37:28] wouldn't be destroyed there was
[1:37:30] crocodiles there was this there was that
[1:37:32] but there was nothing that could destroy
[1:37:35] moses because he had a purpose for his
[1:37:38] life
[1:37:39] and there's nothing that can destroy you
[1:37:41] because there's a purpose for your life
[1:37:45] oh hallelujah hope this is okay this
[1:37:46] morning but you see the reason why we i
[1:37:49] know i'm all over the place but the
[1:37:50] reason why we needed the message was to
[1:37:53] come and show us what truth really is
[1:37:55] like i said earlier the baptist is
[1:37:57] reading out of the same bible the
[1:37:59] methodist is reading out of the same
[1:38:00] bible the pentecostals is reading out of
[1:38:02] the same bible but have different
[1:38:04] interpretations
[1:38:06] this one believes there's three gods
[1:38:07] this one believes in sprinkling this one
[1:38:09] believes eve ate an apple this one
[1:38:11] believes this and that but there had to
[1:38:13] come somebody to say no that's not true
[1:38:17] because there's the standards they're
[1:38:19] living you see let me read the
[1:38:21] definition of a standard so i got ahead
[1:38:22] of myself the definition of a standard
[1:38:25] is somebody is something established by
[1:38:28] authority as a model or example and so
[1:38:32] we see the church world has become a
[1:38:34] model or example for the antichrist
[1:38:37] spirit and so god didn't want just
[1:38:40] examples for the devil he wanted
[1:38:42] examples for himself so he had to give a
[1:38:46] message to say no you're living the
[1:38:48] wrong example you're living the wrong
[1:38:50] life there's no overcoming power in
[1:38:53] man's interpretations
[1:38:55] so he sent this malachi 4 to turn our
[1:38:58] hearts back to the original word
[1:39:01] how do you touch god the bible says it
[1:39:03] is impossible to please god without
[1:39:05] faith
[1:39:06] now how do you get faith the bible says
[1:39:08] faith cometh by hearing and hearing the
[1:39:10] word of god
[1:39:12] so the only way to get faith is by
[1:39:15] hearing the word of god
[1:39:17] not man's interpretations
[1:39:20] so the only way to produce scripture for
[1:39:22] this day was for us to hear the word of
[1:39:25] god which is the message of the hour
[1:39:28] oh that just struck my heart the other
[1:39:30] day while i was preaching this and
[1:39:31] distract me faith only that made it was
[1:39:33] so simple to me
[1:39:35] that's why we had to have the message of
[1:39:37] the hour
[1:39:38] you can't be healed without faith you
[1:39:40] can't see the rapture without faith
[1:39:42] you're not going to get a body change
[1:39:44] without faith and faith only cometh by
[1:39:46] hearing the word
[1:39:48] not man's twisted ideas of the word but
[1:39:51] god's purely unadulterated word is going
[1:39:55] to produce faith
[1:39:57] and that is what the message come to do
[1:39:59] is to produce a faith so now we're no
[1:40:02] longer living under the antichrist
[1:40:05] spirit but we come under the spirit of
[1:40:07] revelation
[1:40:08] they're producing that spirit's actions
[1:40:11] but the bride is producing producing
[1:40:13] other actions we've come under the
[1:40:16] message and now we're producing
[1:40:17] different actions
[1:40:19] oh you see brother branham says just
[1:40:22] like god was in christ fulfilling the
[1:40:24] word christ is in the bride fulfilling
[1:40:28] the word
[1:40:29] for this day
[1:40:30] he says the living god takes the living
[1:40:33] word and personally vindicates it to our
[1:40:36] lives
[1:40:37] takes the living word not some fake idea
[1:40:40] but in the living word and now what's
[1:40:42] producing it in our lives
[1:40:45] you see just like christ was to make the
[1:40:48] word live when he was on earth the bride
[1:40:50] is on earth to make the word live you
[1:40:52] look at second corinthians 3 and 2 ye
[1:40:55] are our epistle written in our hearts
[1:40:57] known and read of all men first timothy
[1:41:01] 4 and 12 let no man despise thy youth be
[1:41:04] thou an example of the believers in word
[1:41:07] and conversation in charity in spirit in
[1:41:11] faith in purity known and read by all
[1:41:14] men beat out an example what's it what's
[1:41:17] the standard an example of a higher
[1:41:20] authority you see so the vindication of
[1:41:23] christ's ministry was him living the
[1:41:26] word because he stopped and he said
[1:41:28] search the scriptures for they testify
[1:41:31] of me
[1:41:32] his life was vindicating the message he
[1:41:36] had was the truth and i believe your
[1:41:38] life is a vindication that the message
[1:41:42] we've gotten this day is the truth you
[1:41:45] look at when jesus they asked for a sign
[1:41:47] and jesus says as jonah was in the belly
[1:41:50] of the well for three days so will the
[1:41:52] son of man be in the belly of the earth
[1:41:55] for three days
[1:41:56] so we know when he was crucified he was
[1:41:59] placed in the tomb he wasn't dead his
[1:42:01] spirit was alive the body was dead
[1:42:04] but there was a promise given that the
[1:42:07] body was going to raise up
[1:42:09] even though the spirit was alive but in
[1:42:11] order for the world to know he was alive
[1:42:14] the body had to raise up
[1:42:17] the spirit went to hell
[1:42:19] in the minister to the souls he went to
[1:42:21] paradise
[1:42:22] but he wasn't known on earth that he was
[1:42:24] alive because the body was still dead
[1:42:28] the spirit of god has been alive it's
[1:42:31] been here with power and authority but
[1:42:33] it needs a body to fulfill itself
[1:42:37] and say god's not dead he's alive but
[1:42:40] the body has to proclaim that it's alive
[1:42:44] and you're the body of christ on earth
[1:42:46] that's proclaiming to the world that
[1:42:48] god's not dead he's alive
[1:42:52] god needs somebody to realize we're on
[1:42:55] earth for a special purpose that's to
[1:42:58] proclaim that jesus christ is alive he's
[1:43:01] not dead he's not somewhere else but
[1:43:04] he's right here living in my skins
[1:43:06] living in your skins living in your body
[1:43:09] you're proclaiming to the world that god
[1:43:12] is alive
[1:43:13] he's alive
[1:43:15] you're proclaiming through your actions
[1:43:17] your actions is going to proclaim
[1:43:20] whether you're a christian or not
[1:43:22] that's what that's what the the the
[1:43:25] denominations don't realize
[1:43:27] their actions are proclaiming who they
[1:43:29] are
[1:43:30] your actions proclaim who you are and so
[1:43:33] the message come to say the actions that
[1:43:35] they've got are the wrong actions
[1:43:38] but the actions that you're supposed to
[1:43:40] produce is right here but god has given
[1:43:43] us his thoughts you see brother branham
[1:43:46] says it takes one person surrendered to
[1:43:48] god to his word jesus christ was god
[1:43:51] made flesh in order to die the word he
[1:43:54] was he the word was the same the word
[1:43:57] just
[1:43:58] flowed but just flew through him there
[1:44:00] was no doubt at all and god is trying to
[1:44:03] get somebody through the sanctifying
[1:44:05] power of christ to yield to that word
[1:44:08] that he and the word can become one
[1:44:11] again that he can use the word through
[1:44:14] that person
[1:44:16] just like hattie wright
[1:44:18] she yielded to the words then she
[1:44:21] started to manifest the same word the
[1:44:24] same authority that the prophet had
[1:44:27] i
[1:44:28] hope you're catching it this morning the
[1:44:30] same authority that christ had to
[1:44:32] produce the word is inside of some young
[1:44:34] people
[1:44:35] and the same power that he had to say
[1:44:38] search the scriptures they testify of my
[1:44:41] life the you young people's got the same
[1:44:44] power
[1:44:45] to say devil they're scriptures for this
[1:44:47] day
[1:44:48] and i'm producing them i'm manifesting
[1:44:51] them i'm showing to the world that god's
[1:44:54] alive through my life
[1:44:57] it's a standard that's been raised by
[1:44:59] the message of the hour but the brandon
[1:45:02] says another place we are made partakers
[1:45:04] of his holiness we in his image we are
[1:45:08] living images of god
[1:45:10] then dead to self raised with him
[1:45:13] now listen listen to this his word is
[1:45:16] made flesh again in us
[1:45:20] the word is made flesh again in us
[1:45:24] just like christ was word made flesh
[1:45:26] there's some young people that his word
[1:45:29] made flesh once again
[1:45:33] oh my
[1:45:35] he says oh brother neville look what is
[1:45:37] it not the mythical imaginary god
[1:45:39] setting out there but the living god
[1:45:41] what is the living god let's
[1:45:44] let a prophet answer it what is the
[1:45:46] living god the word in you making itself
[1:45:51] real
[1:45:52] it's the word in you making itself real
[1:45:57] so no longer is it just a thought it
[1:45:59] ain't just the word but it's a living
[1:46:02] word making itself real among some young
[1:46:05] people
[1:46:07] hallelujah the word is manifesting
[1:46:10] itself once again
[1:46:12] he says whoa glory to god oh i know you
[1:46:16] think i'm a holy ruler maybe i am but
[1:46:18] brother do you see it triumph over every
[1:46:21] denomination over every paganism a
[1:46:24] living god made manifest in a
[1:46:28] and the word of god which is god is made
[1:46:31] flesh in you
[1:46:33] the living god is no longer in the
[1:46:35] eternal realms but it's in some young
[1:46:38] people proclaiming to the world that
[1:46:41] jesus christ is alive and well he's not
[1:46:44] in a tomb he's not way off but he's
[1:46:46] right here in your skins in your flesh
[1:46:50] and you're producing the life of christ
[1:46:54] you're a standard you're an example of
[1:46:57] the power of god because of this message
[1:47:02] hallelujah amen oh hallelujah
[1:47:05] just like god have preeminence in christ
[1:47:08] and fulfill the word for that day christ
[1:47:11] the word is having preeminence in some
[1:47:14] young people and is producing the word
[1:47:16] for this day
[1:47:18] another quote hope this is okay this
[1:47:20] morning and that's exactly
[1:47:22] he says when the church and the word
[1:47:24] that that's exactly why the church and
[1:47:26] the word has to be won like jesus and
[1:47:29] god was one just exactly god was in
[1:47:31] christ reconciling the word to himself
[1:47:34] so will christ have to be have to be not
[1:47:38] maybe so not a hope so but christ has to
[1:47:41] be in the church and he says the
[1:47:44] anointed word to make everything
[1:47:47] fulfilled
[1:47:49] to make everything fulfilled how are we
[1:47:52] going to fulfill scripture for this day
[1:47:54] the anointed word coming on the inside
[1:47:57] of some young people inside of the bride
[1:48:00] and fulfilling everything that god has
[1:48:03] for this day
[1:48:04] john 14 12 very verily i say unto you he
[1:48:07] that believeth on me the works that i do
[1:48:10] shall he do also the greater works than
[1:48:13] these shall he do then he stops and he
[1:48:15] says because i go under my father all
[1:48:17] right
[1:48:18] and that you know i that just hit me
[1:48:21] yesterday when i was reading that he
[1:48:22] says the same works that i do you're
[1:48:24] going to do the greater works brother
[1:48:26] branham says not greater but more of and
[1:48:28] he says because i go to my father
[1:48:31] somebody's got to pronounce the word is
[1:48:34] alive
[1:48:35] somebody's got to show that god is on
[1:48:38] earth still
[1:48:39] i'm going to my father but i'm giving
[1:48:42] you an authority to produce the same
[1:48:45] life
[1:48:47] that i got you can produce
[1:48:50] somebody's going to be an example of the
[1:48:53] power of god
[1:48:55] [Music]
[1:48:57] somebody's going to be an example the
[1:49:00] enemy is coming in like a flood but god
[1:49:03] has raised up some young people and is
[1:49:05] proclaiming that god is alive
[1:49:08] another quote remember we are now as his
[1:49:10] bride impregnated with this spirit oh my
[1:49:13] the church bearing children seen
[1:49:15] impregnated by his spirit with his name
[1:49:20] eric his life bearing forth signs of his
[1:49:24] life evidence with the preeminent
[1:49:26] evidence of his resurrection showing
[1:49:30] that he's not dead but he's alive
[1:49:33] forevermore
[1:49:36] this is eternal life vindicated
[1:49:38] vindicates to the world that we're alive
[1:49:41] in him he goes whoa
[1:49:43] vindicating to the world that we're
[1:49:46] alive in him he's alive in us
[1:49:50] which is a great union show it to the
[1:49:52] devil you make up the baptist you may
[1:49:54] get the methodists you make up the
[1:49:56] pentecostals but god has raised up a
[1:49:59] standard in this last day that you can't
[1:50:02] touch
[1:50:03] you know but the brandon says that eve
[1:50:05] love believed in a god but she
[1:50:07] disbelieved one word
[1:50:09] and the same word that eve disbelieved
[1:50:11] this second eve is going to believe
[1:50:15] and she's going to produce the word no
[1:50:17] but it says in another place that god
[1:50:19] took six years
[1:50:21] to create a to create paradise to create
[1:50:23] eden and the devil had e fall in the
[1:50:26] middle of his eden and now the devil has
[1:50:29] taken 6 000 years to create his paradise
[1:50:33] to create his eden and god has another
[1:50:36] eve but she's not going to fall like she
[1:50:39] did in the beginning but she's going to
[1:50:41] rise
[1:50:42] and i believe you're a part of that
[1:50:44] church that bride that's rising in power
[1:50:48] rising in authority
[1:50:50] rising in dominion you're producing the
[1:50:53] word for this day that's why we get
[1:50:56] excited and shout and rejoice because
[1:50:59] we're seeing the scriptural prophecies
[1:51:01] being fulfilled in our lives look at on
[1:51:04] the day of pentecost there was
[1:51:06] scriptures prophesied for that day then
[1:51:09] this then they came under the holy ghost
[1:51:11] and they came out staggering like drunk
[1:51:13] men and somebody asked him are y'all
[1:51:15] drunk
[1:51:16] what's wrong with y'all and peter says
[1:51:19] now we're not drunk but this is that
[1:51:22] which was spoken by the prophet joel
[1:51:25] he started to produce the words for that
[1:51:29] day
[1:51:30] that's why he couldn't help but get
[1:51:32] excited he started to manifest the word
[1:51:35] it wasn't a passing emotion but it was a
[1:51:38] reality that anchored his soul
[1:51:42] you don't got to get a passing emotion
[1:51:44] the the the denominations has been on
[1:51:48] passing emotions for years but this
[1:51:51] bride ain't on a passing emotion but
[1:51:53] she's got a reality and is producing the
[1:51:56] words
[1:51:57] brother branham says but by god he's
[1:52:00] here god's vindicated revelation made
[1:52:03] plain to them he's speaking of the 120
[1:52:05] in the upper room they was happy about
[1:52:08] it god promised it here it was revealed
[1:52:11] to them vindicated to them amen here was
[1:52:15] the man standing there saying this is
[1:52:16] that and there it was being vindicated
[1:52:20] by the same signs
[1:52:23] the same signs the scripture spoke of
[1:52:26] they was producing
[1:52:29] and the same thing is happening today we
[1:52:31] see the word of promise being vindicated
[1:52:34] through our lives there's a bride that's
[1:52:36] come under scripture prophecies and the
[1:52:39] things we've been waiting on we're now
[1:52:41] producing you look at the woman at the
[1:52:43] well she was waiting for a messiah and
[1:52:46] jesus came and was talking to her and
[1:52:49] she was looking for someone to come she
[1:52:51] was looking for signs to come she was
[1:52:54] looking for an authority to come but
[1:52:56] then the same things she was waiting on
[1:52:59] jesus started to manifest
[1:53:01] but you noticed
[1:53:03] he needed somebody to manifest that
[1:53:05] through
[1:53:08] you know the story i'm talking about
[1:53:10] and she asked him i perceive you're a
[1:53:12] prophet
[1:53:13] for when the messiah comes he will do
[1:53:15] these things
[1:53:17] and he stopped and he says i am he but
[1:53:19] you notice what she says
[1:53:21] she ran and says come see a man who has
[1:53:24] told me
[1:53:26] me everything i done so the things she
[1:53:29] was waiting on was being manifested
[1:53:32] through her life
[1:53:34] did you catch that she was waiting for
[1:53:37] these things to come she was waiting for
[1:53:39] christ to come waiting for the messiah
[1:53:41] to come and when he came she was mad he
[1:53:44] was manifesting his power and authority
[1:53:48] through her life
[1:53:50] and she became an example
[1:53:53] she ran to the city brother branham says
[1:53:55] that she wasn't even allowed to be
[1:53:56] around the around the men she wasn't
[1:53:59] she wasn't allowed to go into the city
[1:54:01] around the people
[1:54:03] but then all of a sudden the people that
[1:54:05] shunned her was now believing her
[1:54:08] what happened she had become an example
[1:54:12] of the power that they was waiting on
[1:54:15] [Music]
[1:54:16] you get on fire with this message you'll
[1:54:19] become an example but what the world is
[1:54:22] waiting on
[1:54:23] they're wanting a living god they're
[1:54:25] wanting something with power they're
[1:54:27] wanting something to stabilize the soul
[1:54:30] and they're trying drugs they're trying
[1:54:32] alcohol they're trying this and that but
[1:54:34] there's nothing to stabilize the thirst
[1:54:37] but there's an example right here in the
[1:54:40] middle of hardy arkansas that can show
[1:54:42] the world that it's not in drugs it's
[1:54:45] not an alcohol but it's in the reality
[1:54:48] of jesus christ there's an example god
[1:54:51] has lifted up a standard
[1:54:54] and proclaiming to the world
[1:54:56] look what he's done in me
[1:54:58] [Music]
[1:55:00] come see a man
[1:55:01] who has told me all that i have ever
[1:55:05] done yes yes yes
[1:55:08] you look
[1:55:09] hope this is okay i'll close here in a
[1:55:10] minute but you look at moses i know i
[1:55:13] keep going back to moses but moses under
[1:55:16] inspiration
[1:55:17] says let there be flies let there be
[1:55:19] frogs let there be lives brother branham
[1:55:22] says if that was moses speaking his own
[1:55:24] words
[1:55:25] god didn't have to vindicate him
[1:55:27] he didn't have to back it up but he says
[1:55:30] but god gave his thoughts
[1:55:32] and moses was speaking god's thoughts so
[1:55:35] god was obligated to back it up
[1:55:40] but you notice
[1:55:41] god wasn't obligated just for moses
[1:55:44] but he was obligated for everybody under
[1:55:47] moses
[1:55:49] it wasn't just moses that went through
[1:55:51] the red sea
[1:55:53] i preached them this morning it wasn't
[1:55:55] it's not going to be just the prophet
[1:55:57] see the body
[1:55:58] changed it's not going to be just the
[1:56:01] preachers see a rapture it's not going
[1:56:04] to be just the adults see the rapture
[1:56:06] but there's some examples
[1:56:09] some young people under the message that
[1:56:13] is going to see the same things
[1:56:15] yes sir
[1:56:16] so you look
[1:56:18] you see
[1:56:19] you look at miriam
[1:56:21] miriam had seen moses called lies called
[1:56:23] frogs and caught turned water in the in
[1:56:26] the in the blood but it was never really
[1:56:29] personally to her because the
[1:56:31] taskmasters were still beating her
[1:56:33] she was still in bondage
[1:56:35] moses had the supernatural and that was
[1:56:37] wonderful but she wanted to see the
[1:56:39] supernatural for herself
[1:56:42] oh my
[1:56:43] but once she got across the red sea
[1:56:46] it wasn't just moses with the
[1:56:48] supernatural
[1:56:50] it wasn't just moses fulfilling the
[1:56:52] words but she turned around and seen the
[1:56:54] taskmaster the beater day after day
[1:56:57] month after month year after year it was
[1:57:00] no longer just moses with this authority
[1:57:04] but the same authority that moses had
[1:57:07] she was manifesting
[1:57:09] the egyptians that she's seen year after
[1:57:12] year were now dead
[1:57:15] the same authority that moses had miriam
[1:57:18] was experiencing
[1:57:19] the same authority that the preachers
[1:57:22] have you young people can experience
[1:57:25] the same authority that brother branham
[1:57:27] had you young people can experience
[1:57:32] you can speak to your mountain
[1:57:34] and doubt not to have to be removed
[1:57:37] you speak to your circumstance
[1:57:40] you speak to that addiction
[1:57:42] you speak it that authority is not just
[1:57:45] in the prophet but it's inside of young
[1:57:48] people under the message
[1:57:52] and then the children of israel became
[1:57:55] standards
[1:57:56] because you notice whenever they got
[1:57:58] into jericho what did rahab say
[1:58:01] what did rayam say she said the men's
[1:58:03] hearts
[1:58:04] were affected
[1:58:05] when we heard
[1:58:07] what john did to the egyptians
[1:58:10] oh
[1:58:12] they become standards
[1:58:14] he wasn't they wasn't just looking at
[1:58:16] the power of god but they had somebody
[1:58:18] to look to and say god through you
[1:58:21] destroyed the egyptians
[1:58:24] god through you split the red sea
[1:58:28] gone through you destroyed the giants
[1:58:32] they have become the examples
[1:58:34] oh hallelujah
[1:58:36] and i believe there's somebody here
[1:58:38] that the world can't just look at the
[1:58:40] prophet or look the preachers or or look
[1:58:42] through some
[1:58:43] uh some imagination but now they're
[1:58:45] looking at some vessels and say my
[1:58:48] goodness how are you doing it hallelujah
[1:58:51] how are you not bound to smoking
[1:58:53] how are you not bound to drinking how
[1:58:56] are you not laughing at these dirty
[1:58:57] jokes how are you wearing your skirts
[1:58:59] young ladies how are you wearing your
[1:59:01] lone care
[1:59:03] how are you
[1:59:05] you're now looking
[1:59:07] as an example
[1:59:09] not just gods
[1:59:10] but now they can see somebody
[1:59:13] that's what this message come to do
[1:59:17] to bring god out of the eternal realms
[1:59:20] so that some young people can now walk
[1:59:22] as christ walked on earth
[1:59:25] that the world can look at a living god
[1:59:27] in your skins
[1:59:29] out of living god through your skins and
[1:59:31] living god in your skins and you can say
[1:59:34] oh yes come see a man
[1:59:37] come see god
[1:59:38] he touched me and he can touch you
[1:59:41] i'm a standard
[1:59:44] i'm a standard
[1:59:47] i'm a standard of what god's power can
[1:59:49] do
[1:59:50] and he can do it for you as well
[1:59:52] one more last point before i close
[1:59:55] you look at david i know these are the
[1:59:56] simple examples
[1:59:58] but you look at david
[2:00:00] david was a little nobody a young person
[2:00:03] ready
[2:00:04] nothing for his stature but god called
[2:00:07] him for a special purpose
[2:00:09] but you notice
[2:00:10] that he wasn't just called
[2:00:12] but he was anointed
[2:00:14] he wasn't just anointed but his purpose
[2:00:17] was given to him
[2:00:19] on the back side of the door with the
[2:00:21] sheep samuel came up to him gave him a
[2:00:24] message and says you're going to reign
[2:00:26] as king
[2:00:27] but he didn't just give him a message
[2:00:29] but then he anointed him with oil
[2:00:32] so now he has the anointing to fulfill
[2:00:35] his purpose
[2:00:36] and so whenever he was coming to the to
[2:00:39] the battleground
[2:00:40] and goliath was making his big boast he
[2:00:42] was saying i defy the armies of the
[2:00:45] living god if there's somebody here that
[2:00:48] can destroy me let him come up and fight
[2:00:50] me
[2:00:51] but you notice there was bigger guys
[2:00:53] than david there were stronger guys than
[2:00:55] david there was more capable men from
[2:00:58] the natural life than david
[2:01:00] but they weren't anointed
[2:01:03] they didn't have a message telling them
[2:01:05] they were going to survive
[2:01:06] they didn't know if they were going to
[2:01:08] survive or not
[2:01:10] all they knew was that was a big goliath
[2:01:13] and he's going to destroy me
[2:01:15] but david was saying that's a big
[2:01:17] goliath but i've got a message saying
[2:01:20] i'm going to reign as king
[2:01:23] there's no goliath there's no bear
[2:01:25] there's no lion there's nothing that's
[2:01:28] going to keep me from fulfilling my
[2:01:30] purpose
[2:01:31] so he was a standard
[2:01:33] he was an example he was going up and he
[2:01:36] was like why are you hiding in the caves
[2:01:39] why y'all in your stance
[2:01:41] ain't this the army of the living god
[2:01:44] but you notice it takes the word to
[2:01:47] produce a living army
[2:01:50] they were dead they were dead while they
[2:01:52] lived the bible says
[2:01:54] that this day there's women that's dead
[2:01:56] why they live what's that they're dead
[2:01:58] in their sins
[2:02:00] even though they're alive but that's
[2:02:01] another subject but this this army was
[2:02:04] dead
[2:02:06] but david wasn't dead he was alive by
[2:02:08] revelation
[2:02:10] he had been anointed and the message
[2:02:12] proclaimed his purpose
[2:02:13] and so he ran up to goliath it says
[2:02:16] today i'm going to take your head off i
[2:02:18] don't care how big you are how bad you
[2:02:20] are how strong you are how much of a
[2:02:22] warrior you are you notice that david
[2:02:25] was a very young boy and that goliath
[2:02:28] was on earth a lot longer than david was
[2:02:32] just like you or some young people and
[2:02:34] the devil's been on earth a lot longer
[2:02:37] than you have he's got more experience
[2:02:40] than you that's why you needed somebody
[2:02:43] to tell you how to defeat the devil
[2:02:47] which was the message of the hour
[2:02:50] and so david says i'm going to take your
[2:02:51] head off he took but the random says he
[2:02:54] took five stones and found it with his
[2:02:56] five fingers faith in jesus and he slung
[2:02:59] that stone and i brought down the
[2:03:01] goliath but you know there's too many
[2:03:03] people stop right there
[2:03:05] too many times we come to church and we
[2:03:08] get a victory
[2:03:09] you know we get a victory god touches
[2:03:11] our life but we go home the same
[2:03:14] david david was going to make sure that
[2:03:17] that glass wasn't going to get back up
[2:03:19] too many times we come to church come to
[2:03:22] a youth meeting come to a youth camp
[2:03:24] knock the devil down we get back home we
[2:03:26] do cpr on it and bring that devil back
[2:03:29] to life in your life
[2:03:31] and you're still bound you're still
[2:03:33] addicted you're still in your your jail
[2:03:35] cell but david was going to make sure
[2:03:38] that this goliath wasn't going to bother
[2:03:41] him no longer there was an authority
[2:03:44] because of a message that was given by a
[2:03:47] prophet
[2:03:49] and let me say there's an authority
[2:03:52] inside of your lives where you don't got
[2:03:54] to go and stroke with addictions no more
[2:03:57] you're not gonna go back and those old
[2:03:59] devils plague your mind no longer what
[2:04:01] you need to do is draw your sword
[2:04:04] draw your sword david said nah this
[2:04:07] goliath has been plaguing us too long
[2:04:10] i'm taking the sword i'm anointed i've
[2:04:13] been given a message and i'm going to
[2:04:15] kept that devil's head off this morning
[2:04:17] you're anointed you've been given a
[2:04:19] message draw your sword and cuddle
[2:04:22] pornography turn off addictions turtle
[2:04:25] complexes anxiety whatever it is there's
[2:04:29] an authority
[2:04:30] inside of your life as the musicians
[2:04:33] come
[2:04:35] somebody's going to be an example
[2:04:39] but the story don't just stop there
[2:04:42] david turned around
[2:04:43] and he says hey guys
[2:04:45] i know you haven't experienced what i've
[2:04:47] experienced
[2:04:49] he picks up the head
[2:04:50] and says look i did it
[2:04:53] i know it looks impossible
[2:04:56] it looks impossible to live an
[2:04:58] overcoming life
[2:05:00] it looks impossible to live a life above
[2:05:03] complexes and anxiety it looks
[2:05:06] impossible guys but look
[2:05:08] i did it
[2:05:10] you can do it too and the bible says the
[2:05:13] children of israel seen what david done
[2:05:16] and got courage
[2:05:18] they seen a living god inside of a
[2:05:21] living young person and they realized if
[2:05:24] david can do it i can do it too
[2:05:27] and young people i did it you can do it
[2:05:30] too
[2:05:31] the same god that california my life can
[2:05:35] get a hold of your life
[2:05:37] the same message that gave me an
[2:05:39] authority can give you an authority
[2:05:43] i did it brother andrew did it this is a
[2:05:45] young man that's been four times since
[2:05:48] he was 16. god did it for him god can do
[2:05:51] it for you

[2:05:55] preaching since he was 13 14 god did it
[2:05:58] for him god can do it for you
[2:06:01] you may not be a preacher but god can
[2:06:03] get a hold of your life and the same
[2:06:05] authority that brother andrew gots that
[2:06:07] brother wendell gods brother ben gotch
[2:06:10] is the same authority that you can have
[2:06:12] in your
[2:06:15] let's life our heads this morning can
[2:06:17] notice something soft
[2:06:19] praise the lord dear heavenly father
[2:06:23] we love you
[2:06:24] lord
[2:06:25] this is what you placed upon my heart
[2:06:27] father

[2:06:31] that they're not just wannabes
[2:06:33] they're not just hope so's
[2:06:36] but this message has raised them up
[2:06:39] above the world
[2:06:41] they've got the advantage lord
[2:06:43] the pentecostals the denominations would
[2:06:46] love to be where they're at right now
[2:06:48] they will love the opportunity to live a
[2:06:50] life above sin
[2:06:52] but lord you've given these young people
[2:06:54] the opportunity
[2:06:56] and lord made they realize
[2:06:58] that you've given them something special
[2:07:01] lord may they get into the message for
[2:07:03] themselves
[2:07:04] may they get into these tapes for
[2:07:06] themselves
[2:07:07] not just mama's revelation or dad's
[2:07:09] revelation or the pastor's revelation
[2:07:12] but may they get a revelation for
[2:07:13] themselves lord

[2:07:18] name

[2:07:32] language my mind and that destruct me

[2:07:58] but god needs some dedicated young
[2:07:59] people
[2:08:00] inside of this message
[2:08:03] that's listening to the tapes studying
[2:08:05] for ourselves
[2:08:07] it's the only way it's going to produce
[2:08:08] the rapturing faith is on the inside of
[2:08:11] this message but brother branham says
[2:08:13] rapturing faith is on the inside
[2:08:16] of these tapes
[2:08:18] hearing comes by the word our faith
