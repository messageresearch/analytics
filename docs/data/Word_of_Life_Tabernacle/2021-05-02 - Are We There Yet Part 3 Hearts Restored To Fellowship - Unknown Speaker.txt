maybe you've got a need you'd like to make known by my uplifted hand i'm sure god sees every need and knows every heart heavenly father we're so thankful lord for each person that's here today and a member of your bride lord that would be gathered together on a sunday morning father i thank you for them and i thank you for your grace lord to them grace to me lord allow us to be here in communion with you lord i pray for every request every uplifted hand you know the reason behind it lord what they're going through what this part of their life means lord and what what the difficulties are and i pray god that you would just touch everyone meet every request this morning i know you can do that maybe there's a question that needs to be answered today you can do that through your word you can lord take me completely out of myself and what i would say lord and just speak directly to each situation i pray you would do that today thank you for all that you do we thank you for your blessings now in jesus name amen amen you love him this morning amen it's good to be in the house of the lord turn with me to joel chapter 1 and verse 4. joel chapter one and verse four uh keep remembering each of the those that are sick and several of the kids i know are are sick and colds and things like that in the church and uh different families couldn't be here today so be praying for them but i know they're watching this morning i want to continue on our thought of are we there yet but i want to speak this morning on hearts restored to fellowship and we need to also remember um the white camp family and keep them in our prayers as brother bill's lost his mother and sister sharon's had some complications with the procedure she had done on her heart and and so they need our prayers today and we need to keep them remember them today and then uh the church at galena and i was going to say brother brown's church but brother brown has passed on now and let's remember them in our prayers and and that they would it's hard we've been through that where you change from one pastor to another for whatever reason and and so it's difficult and so keep them in your prayers and then this afternoon we'll have communion it's always i know some folks can't be here but it's always a a blessing to have communion be able to do that and then we when we have the opportunity we should do that and you say brother ben i don't feel worthy to take communion well all you have to do is repent if you're a christian the only thing standing between you and taking communion is saying lord i'm sorry we can all do that amen amen joel chapter one and verse four that which the palmer worm hath left the locust eaten that which the locust hath left at the cankerworm eaten and that which the cankerworm had left had the caterpillar eaton i pray the lord would add his blessing to the word you may be seated this morning i don't have a lot of notes this morning i'm going to take my time and speak to you from my heart we um have been to several funerals lately and it just seems like those things kind of go in spurts and i went to speak at a funeral wednesday of a a young man he was 52 years old that seems younger all the time who had passed away unexpectedly and not really any reason for it it was just his time and but i hadn't been around those people in a long time and and some of them may watch this i know his wife and the family sometimes watch these services but i was around the family and i hadn't been around them in a long time and they had not had fellowship in a local church for a long time and i got to looking at that and i thought it makes a difference it makes a difference the fellowship matters the leaves on the tree are not something an added benefit they matter to the life of the tree and the health of the tree the tree is not cannot produce fruit unless it has leaves right it cannot be a tree it cannot provide shade it cannot it doesn't do any good you go and what do you what do you do when you see a tree with no leaves in the middle of the summer it's dead right you see that it's dead and and so i i was watching that and it really broke my heart because some of those kids i grew up with i spent 16 years with some of them and then come back 15 years later and and things have changed and i haven't changed i still serve the same god and preach the same gospel but things have changed and and i told you here not long ago a little boy that i grew up with i saw him went and spent the day with him in in church in a message church we grew up together kind of and he uh didn't know if he believed in god anymore and how do you get to that place with a steward where you don't even know if you believe in god well it begins it's because the cankerworm is eaten away and the caterpillar's eaten away and the locust is eaten away at the tree and there's no fellowship and there's no cooling and there's no there's no way to keep your life clean and and do the things that you need to do and and so that lack of fellowship matters and on the way when we were on our way to the funeral i was at steak and shake in west plains we stopped there to eat on the way by the jt and i saw someone there who i had known and who i grew up with and he had taken his family out of church and he may watch this as well but he'd taken his family out of church and just listens to tapes at his house and i've seen the results of that and when i saw him i could tell he was under conviction because he knew i was pastoring here now and and they hadn't been over and he was under a lot of conviction he begins to defend this to me and he was like abraham and you didn't have to have a church home and all these things and i began to think about these things and i thought and i was already planning on preaching this but i thought god i'm so grateful for the fellowship that i have so grateful to be able to gather with god's people if for nothing else because that's what he said to do but it's not just that it it it's not just an added benefit it's a it's something that's essential to the life of a christian brother branham says you can't be as good a christian and not go to church and so that's pretty straightforward i want to be a good christian don't you you don't want to be a halfway christian why would you want to be miserable anything halfway is miserable why be miserable why be in and out and up and down and when you can stay right there in communion you can stay right there in fellowship with god and so you would you would find as we were talking about are we there yet are we in a place where we are restored can we say that malachi 4 did what he came to do can we say that i believe he did what he came to do but the proof of that has got to be me right have i been restored am i am i are we there yet have i been turned back has my heart been turned back to fellowship with god and with the people now a lack of fellowship is a symptom as i've said before it's not a it's not the problem it's a symptom of the life that's been taken out of the tree but he takes it away and then he gets to the life now in first john 1 3 or actually we'll go to a quote here first in restoration of the bride tree brother branham says then this little fellow died out and he become a locust he said that was the next stage was the locust now what does the locust do the locust eats the leaves he said destroyed the leaves he said what's the leaves for he said he was destroying divine fellowship brother branham calls it divine fellowship now in first john 1 3 john says that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you that you also may have fellowship with us and truly our fellowship is with the father and with his son jesus christ so he's saying there and we've talked about this before but there's a vertical fellowship taking place it's got to be there before this horizontal fellowship can happen right we've went over that before but you know i want to dwell on that just for a moment that we've got to be in fellowship with god right not just know about god not just to know about a message of the hour and all the things that we know but to actually be in fellowship with god means that you're communing with him on a regular basis how do we have fellowship with god well first of all we were out of fellowship with god and that fellowship came by the blood brother badam said god only accepts a man through shed blood he said that's the only place of fellowship the only way across that chasm is not through religious organization not through idols not through towers not through holy places see you come to church because you're in fellowship with god but church itself doesn't make you in fellowship with god right but you come to church because you're in fellowship with god he said it's not holy places not through cities not through anything else but the shed blood that's the only way back amen and brother adam says this he said the preaching of the cross despised as it is it's god's provided way for sinners amen to come in fellowship with god or with each other so we can say we come to hear the preaching of the word because we want to be in fellowship with god if you're out of fellowship today if you're doing things that you know that is wrong you know that you shouldn't be doing that you can come in fellowship with god under the shed blood but how by the preaching of the word but brother a prophet of god stands there and tells you he said how can you be washed if you won't stay where the fountain is how can you be washed unless you listen how can you be washed unless you hear it amen how do you maintain fellowship with god unless you're willing to stay where the fountain is and the bible tells us that if we want to have fellowship with god we should not grieve the spirit and he tells us that in ephesians 4 30 but first john 1 and 6 says if we say we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth we say we have fellowship with him so i have fellowship with god but i walk in darkness he said if we but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship now watch what he says one with another and the blood of jesus christ his son cleanses us from all sin you can't be in darkness and say i'm saved i'm redeemed i'm walking in the light i'm in fellowship with god and i don't say that to condemn us this morning because i believe you're a christian this morning you come to the house of god or you're watching this morning you're a christian i'm not saying that to condemn you but if you're in darkness walk in the light it's a whole lot simpler than what people make it just walk in it just do it right you know what's what's the right thing to do you wake up you know what you should be doing but it's just doing it right it's just walking and how are you going to do that well you have to invite the spirit of christ into your life to be to be able to do it because otherwise you're gonna you're gonna fail in the flesh because the flesh is always against god and always will be never will be converted but yet there's something inside of you that will cause you to walk in the light because you have fellowship with that light now the random tells us in harvest time he said back he said now go back to genesis which is the beginning he said genesis means the beginning he said we find that god gave his family eternal life as long as they stayed in this word and lived by this word i want to slow this down because i want you to get this quote it's very important very important especially for those of us who are maybe growing up and in in faith and none of us are there yet we're not in the sense that we all have something to learn but part of what you have to learn is yourself how do i deal with myself right my biggest problem that i have to deal with is not some other pastor somewhere sometimes pastors can give you problems it's not some other person it's not any of you the biggest problem i've ever had is right here how do i deal with myself right and i suspect that your problem is the same person right itself now so brother branham deals with this he said his first family lived by this word but when they broke it just one link in the chain of promises death struck them which was a promise also right we talk about promises and we should believe the promises but death was a promise said if you eat thereof that day you'll die that was a promise god's promises are true right he said it's a chain you're hanging over hell with it i want you to get this image brother branham uses it hundreds of times he said you're hanging over hell by a chain that chain is the word of god right you're hanging over hell with it that's the only thing that'll carry you through nothing else will keep you from hell but the word right i love emotion i love good times i love to worship there's nothing that blesses my heart more than seeing people worship but that won't keep you out of hell nothing i love more than to be in church with all of you fellowship we go to the fellowship all this afternoon have a potluck dinner i love to eat but fellowship with the bride won't keep you out of hell right what does the chain of god's word right the chain of god's word is holding you amen amen he said you're hanging over hell with it he said now listen he said when the believer becomes a make-believer upon do that for a while because you can't come become something different in the seed but in your attitude you can right in your outlook when the believer becomes a make-believer and you say well that that can't happen well go back and listen to three kinds of believers brother branham gives an altar call to unbelievers and make believers to become believers that's what he does at the end of that sermon right and so all of us at on some level at different times in our life we've been an unbeliever a make-believer or a believer but on the inside it's what we really are but he said when the believer becomes a make-believer and lives on one word that's contrary to this word he cuts his fellowship with god one link broke that's why you better have the holy spirit right because who else is going to teach you the word how else brother joe are we ever going to know whether we're right because you could look through and try to study it and find out every little thing that you could find but the holy spirit has got to be there to convict you to to call you back to the word to bring you back into fellowship with god so he says your faith in this word is like a chain he said he said a chain is its strongest at its weakest link and this is the same quote just continuing he said that's right it's the strongest he said because that's all it'll hold right you don't have to break every link in the chain just one link that's all that'll hold now listen what he says he says if there's something in the word that's puzzling to you and i don't want you all to raise your hand and admit it but for me there's lots of things in the word that's puzzling to me sure it is but there's some things that maybe would bother you wouldn't bother anybody else you don't understand it i met a man one time that was just perplexed why brother branham would talk about shorts on men he didn't understand that and women could wear skirts right and he didn't understand that they just went below the knee why can't a man wear shorts below the knee and and you know there's we could go into an explanation and all of that but that was puzzling to him and almost made it where he couldn't believe the message just because of that right and it's puzzling there's something puzzling to you something that it's just you for some reason for whatever reason that was puzzling to him there may be something in the message something in the word of god that's puzzling to you you think maybe maybe you think well you know that word is true but it's not really for me my situation is different but he said if it's puzzling to you he said something that you've heard different right and so maybe you come in here and preach and you've heard it different all your life and you think well yeah that's true but i heard it this way so maybe this is okay as well he said but if it's puzzling to you and you've heard it a certain way all your life different he said but they said now who are they they is usually the people that get you into trouble is they because like i said you you got to conquer yourself and they may not know what's best for conquering self right they might say this is okay it's okay for you to do this you can do this they might come out and say well you can lead your family this way you can go to this church you can do that this side or the other but you gotta have that in your own heart right they said oh that was for the apostles them things was for days gone by he said when the scripture said jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever brother brown said don't let that be a weakness because it's puzzling to you you don't understand it maybe it's the way somebody treated you and you've been treated badly and and it becomes like a sore spot and you don't understand it but you know you should treat other people right you know when he was reviled he reviled not again but you just can't quite do it and then other people come around you on facebook they're especially good at this and oh we understand oh they shouldn't have treated you that way man you have a right to be upset you have a right to be angry you have a right to not go to church they said they said god don't really mean that god you'll be okay they said but what did god say because they said might be the weak and the weak link in the chain remember he said they said certain things but what did god say he said don't let that be a weakness fortify it hold it there's a saying in baseball i'm sure brother david's heard it that that don't you not let that you not you don't want to let certain people beat you so before they go to a game one game one team against another they say who do we not want to let beat us it sounds strange but it's like if we get beat by their best players or something wrong with our strategy because we can pitch around them we can walk them right so they fortify against the best players and if somebody else beats us they're just going to beat us but we're going to fortify against the guy we know we know what he can do if we don't plan for him that's our problem because we know he's a problem right we know he's going to get hit and the truth is there's some things in your life that you know that's a problem some areas some things in my life in each one of our lives that we know that's a problem and we know and you say what does this have to do with fellowship well look this is what keeps you from being in fellowship with god one link and we'll come back to this later because i want us to really understand it because it has to do with fellowship with one another as well but he said don't let it be a weakness fortify it take that very thing that is a weakness maybe it's just you have a hard time studying the word that's your weakness you just have a really hard time my dad was not a reader i was a reader i always loved to read my dad was not a reader well i found as i get older i don't read as much as i used to but and maybe i just knew him when he was old i don't know but my dad never read but you you have to study there's there's got to be a way you got to fortify that right for some people may be easy to take an hour and pray 30 minutes and pray whatever it is for other people that's difficult maybe the way you were raised and different things way that you come up it's hard to have family prayer it's hard to have a devotion it's hard to do that you've got to fortify that watch out for that spot because that's exactly where the devil's going to get you but the random says he has one punch coming at you right there's something in your life he said if it wasn't maybe it'll be a sickness maybe it'll be a certain mindset something or another he's got a pledge coming at you for brother branham he dealt with depression in his life he struggled with that every seven years brother branham dealt with depression people deal with things we're real people aren't we we're human beings but fortify that don't make excuses for it right that's the worst thing you could do not because i don't want to hear your excuses but because it's the worst thing you could do for you right the worst thing you can tell somebody is you're a victim because as soon as you realize you're a victim you begin to act like a victim even if you are a victim it's the worst thing you could ever realize about yourself he said fortify it hold it wrap your listen wrap your life into it well it's hard for me to go to church it's hard for me i don't like it people offend me it's hard for me to be in the house of god with people it's hard for me to take communion hard for me to do foot washing fortify that wrap your life into it if you know it's something you're supposed to do take that spot and fortify it are you with me this morning this meant so much to me because i've got those spots that i need to fortify he said wrap your life into it because that's the only thing that'll take you over the flames of hell now how do you maintain this fellowship well you don't grieve the spirit you fortify those spots what else do you do commit to communion i i appreciated brother allen's sermon wednesday night so much and it actually convicted me a little bit because we've got to be committed we've got to be committed to prayer we've got to be committed to the house of god we got to be committed as a christian amen and and you say well brother ben said i don't have to pray because i don't ever do anything wrong well good for you that's not why you pray huh who prayed the most in the bible look it up sometime the person the biblical figure who we who we see praying the most is christ and he never did anything wrong so it actually works like this obedience leads to prayer yes but prayer leads to obedience no one prayed more than than christ did and the more christ-like you become the more you pray not less so brother branham talks about that he said so children back to your god quickly oh if i could say that this morning word of life tabernacle back to god quickly not that you're some kind of sinner out here somewhere but every day it's a walk back to god quickly don't tangle with the world for anything stay out of this modern world stay out of these modern theologies just look to the lamb of god he said read your bible and pray all the time don't be weary be rejoicing happy for the redemption of the church's drawing nigh when we shall see him who died for us amen amen stay in that holy place where the man is fresh all right remember brother branham talks about and we'll read some from it but in the hidden life in christ he talks about how that there was a problem because when the people began to eat the manna that had been left over the manna that was provided for their health and their well-being made them sick right remember that they yesterday's man that made him sick brother branham in a very colorful comment calls it the campground cramps made him sick i apologize to those of you that are already sick today but it made them sick they couldn't they couldn't because there was leftovers they were coming in and out just getting the leftovers but he talked about how that there was a man that was kept inside the holy of holies and in the presence of the shekinah that manna never went bad amen and so you have to stay in that place you say well i don't understand every day it seems like i'm up and i'm down and i'm in and i'm out stay in the holy place and brother barron says i think that's what's the matter with our church today he said we got too many of those layovers he said that's right he said some people just eat enough manna to make them right good and hungry for some more he said they just you know it's like eating mcdonald's i've never eaten mcdonald's been full i guess it's the salt content but every single time i've ever eaten at mcdonald's i'm more hungry when i get done than when i started now about 30 minutes later i'm full but right then you want to eat more why because you just ate enough to make it right good and hungry for some more he said before one revival to another one you have to go out and get renewed again he said oh brother why don't you stop that nonsense and come into the holiest of holies by the blood of the lord jesus every bit of man outside of here just lets you last for tonight or tomorrow next week it won't work it dries up overnight right we want something that'll work we want to have something in our heart today that works for every day that doesn't just make us a little bit better versions of ourselves but changes us but keeps us that well let's just walk with him where we quit making excuses for how we are say well that's just the way my family was just the way i was no you can be like christ hey man you don't have to be like your family you don't have to be like me or anybody else you can be like christ do we believe that today amen i can be as committed as christ i can pray like him why because his spirit lives in me amen just as so flesh gets in the way but i can stay on the inside in that holy of holies i can stay in that place now look it's possible to grieve him but it's also possible to stay there he said it's impossible wait just a minute he says he said but if you'll ever consecrate yourself to come into where the man stays fresh day in and day out year in and year out in the holiest of holies he said you can meet that man that's ever walked in there he said i don't care if he hasn't been in revival for six months he's just as sweet as he was the day he was in the revival hallelujah he said that's right you could meet him on a shouty day amen i'm so glad for the shouty days but he said you could meet him on a shouty day or on a cloudy day hallelujah or whatever you want to he might be driving a tractor he might be driving a truck he might be working in a factory but you can meet him on a cloudy day or a shouty day it doesn't matter he's just the same because he's living in the glory of god amen he said he's living where the man is fresh all the time where it isn't a burden to get out he said notice him pray through today and pray through tomorrow now brother man it's not telling us not to pray through i heard a message preacher one time get up and preach and say you don't have to pray through anymore that's false you do have to pray through but you need to stay prayed through right because brother random makes some statements he said david didn't have didn't pray through before he went and fought goliath he was already prayed up right you don't have to go back and repray you can stay prayed up it's not necessarily even how much you pray but it's staying in that atmosphere staying in that place where whether it's a shouty day or a cloudy day while you prayed through that day you don't have to go out go get out and pray through today and pray through tomorrow he said brother stay with him all the time in the holiest of holies he said can a person live that way he said brother man that's impossible but a prophet of god because i was having this conversation the other day and like i said perhaps i'll listen to this but in this conversation with a man was obviously convicted and and i just i told him i said brother i didn't bring it up and you know i'm not the person that and i love that brother love him to death but you no one is exempt from the word right no matter how much we love each other and we i want everybody to be saved but nobody's exempt from the word and you can choose to go to church wherever you want to you go to the church of your choice but you got to go to church you say well if i lived in africa somewhere but you don't right maybe i won't be a little bit more blunt than i normally am but there's a reason for it because i see what happens to families when they get out of church and some of you make a real effort with your families and and i appreciate that i it does my heart good to see you here with your babies and the babies are maybe struggling and crying and things but it means the world because you're teaching them something my dad there's a lot of things my dad taught me wrong but he taught me one thing right go to church he taught me to go to church and we were always at church and so for me it wasn't hard for me to develop a habit of going to church i didn't have to do that as an adult because i was there as a kid and so it means the world to be able to do that because they it won't be a weakness in their life you understand it's less likely to be a weakness in their life if they did it as a kid but some of you weren't saved as a child you didn't go to church or your parents maybe didn't do that and and yet you come to church today why because the love of god's in your heart but but i'm not just preaching this at you and you understand but but to make sure we understand that we must do it it's not i'll do it because it's good and because i enjoy the preacher because we have the pastor i wanted or we have the person no it's not it's not dependent on that this is essential you just can't be as good a christian as you can if you go to church and i told the brother the other day he's like well you don't have to go to church to be saved and i said no i said but i'll tell you what dwight moody told his congregation he said you don't have to go to church he said you can you can get to england without getting on a boat he said but it's a long way to swim but it does affect people you might be saved but who are you affecting around you i don't want to have to stand at your funeral and look at what you've done and the decision you made not to be in church because i'll do it i'll i'll do it because i love people say brother ben why do you do it because there is people it could be god's people we don't know we don't know one from another but when you see him make decisions you see that decision directly lead to the things that have gone on in the in in a life or a family and you think god if they could only realize that they did this to themselves but but i want you to i want you to hear the warning today not not that you would do that but i just want you to hear the warning that that life wouldn't pass by with me never saying it that it leads you need to think about going to church more seriously than what we do sometimes more seriously because it is a serious thing it's the word and the word is that chain right and that's people come to me i can remember preaching sister brown years ago 90 something years old and she she'd come in the prayer line go oh brother ben i want to be closer to god i never knew anybody who lived closer to god than sister brown in my life but that's the way she would come i think we all ought to come that way sometimes now in the new testament the only people that we know about in the new testament who refuse to assemble with a local church this includes ministry by the way because even paul whenever he would go to a town he'd go to the local church and maybe there were several he went to all of them probably but he would go to the saints that were in that town all that would let him all that would allow him to come now the only people in the new testament who refused to assemble with the local church were apostates you can find that in first john 2 19. that's he said they went out from us because they were not of us they broke fellowship right and again i don't want to be harsh but we need to think about it seriously and because the fellowship is though that leaves that the locusts ate away brother brown said this and i want to take you through several quotes here and what i'm going to do is i'm going to try to convince you that brother branham believed in what the word says right and not that you haven't already been convinced but but just to bring that up in our minds and so there never be any question if anybody asked what why did brother branham believe about going to church and brother branham says this he said i pray that every sinner that comes in through these doors will be converted and will take a good church home he said there's some fine churches and fine ministers here and i would not say which one or where he said because if i was here i'd be in confusion which place to go brother brown was being so nice to the brothers there and said i wouldn't even know which one to choose he said there's just so many fine churches and find places he said you just take you one of your choice one right i don't care and i i'm serious about that and i have to surrender my own flesh to do that because i want you to come here right i want everybody i meet to come here but that wouldn't work right but i want you to come here but you need to go to one church right and then you can visit wherever you want right but go to one church he says find one of your choice but you be sure he said to be there every night the door is open and again i know some of y'all sick today and being convicted by that and i apologize i didn't intend that but it's just the way it is but it's not for you because you'd be here if you wanted if you could be i've known people who couldn't go to church physically unable to go god knows that but their heart was there and you watch that person i marvel sometimes at elderly people because elderly people are more faithful and some of that is just because they're less busy right you've got less to do but some of that is not that some of it's just because they they've lived and they know how important it is right to come to the house of god now um remember the steward you have a hard time preaching this afternoon i'm just looking forward to brother stewart this afternoon before communion bit look at this brother branham says be sure to be there every night the door is open he said and if you just love the lord real well you'll be there don't you want to love god he said well brother ben this is before the books and the tapes before the books and the tapes now we have the book states we don't have to do this anymore continue that quote this is this is the next quote he said now the tapes of the messages in the books he said they're all back at the back but you find a church home right now brother brown went to india in september 1954 and he had no cooperation in the sense that churches there was a person that sponsored him but it wasn't they didn't have any infrastructure in the country no churches to take the people to and so he gets over there and has all kinds of problems and yet he said that the meeting in bombay was his greatest meeting was the bombay meetings there was something like over in that meeting over half a million people we can even imagine that number of people in that meeting half a million people and he talks about 10 000 mohammedans being saved at the same time in one service because they saw a miracle of i believe a blinded eye opened and he talks about that being his greatest meeting greater than africa but you don't hear about india the way you do about africa when it comes to the message of the hour there's a reason for that because he didn't have any church to send them to there was no existing church infrastructure it's mostly a pagan country and so brother branham it's why he called a men's meeting and ended up preaching the sermon called taking sides with jesus but branham does that because he's disturbed by that india meeting by the events that took place because he realized and he says he'll say at different points to his ministry i don't know where any of them are he would say something like 50 000 people were saved he said i don't know where any of them are and because they didn't have any support you ought to patch yourself on the back this morning you don't realize what a great support you are to other christians just being able to gather together i know we're not large in number but just being able to gather together in in the house of god on a sunday morning or on a wednesday afternoon whatever it is you don't know what that means to other people what it means to me to see your face what it means to other people it gives you courage to keep going on these people didn't have it so they were converted they gave their hearts to christ and then they never heard anything about the gospel again many of them and think about what an opportunity we've had to hear it over and over and over he's still with me this morning i i know i'm wading through a little bit different water than usual but you just stay with me now brother branham says about that meeting he said he said i have learning a little better than that now he said every person that saved ought to have a church home and he was speaking about that india meeting he said every person that's saved ought to have a church home they ought to be in church and there every time that church has a service or every time you pass it brother brandon set a high standard here so you all just he said every time you pass it go and open the doors and go in and pray or do something now we don't make that a law but you understand what he's saying love the lord amen amen now he said again speaking of that same india meeting and jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever he said it's such a sad thing he said if we can get the ministers to cooperate so that the man when he's converted he can have a church home to go to if you turn him back out in the devil's pickpin then he'll become back again just like he was he said well if they're predestinated they'll make it god predestinated you and then put you in the church to help you you understand i made the statement the other night when brother brown had passed away i don't know that i would be here today standing here preaching to you if it wasn't for brother brown's ministry i don't know that and and you say well you're predestined you you've got a gift in your life no god allows the things to happen in your life that's all a part of the providence of god i don't know that i would be here you know that what they told him what they told brother branham when he got to the other side they said if you hadn't went we wouldn't have been here huh so there's a responsibility that's on us but i don't know if brother brown hadn't set that example for me as a young man of what a message ministry was in that time and day and hour that he lived in i i don't know that i would have made it and i've had other men like that in my life and i've been able to be a part of great churches that that helped me and some not so great but they still it helped me to go to the house of god if you turn someone out in the devil's pigpen he'll be come back again just like he was he said but if you get a place got a place you can direct him to he said something good he said like jesus with the samaritan he taken him to the end you realize that god even ha even uses pastors for those that he finds on the side of the road god finds them god arrests god gets a hold of them god takes them and binds up their wounds and takes them to the pastor what an awesome responsibility take some of the church what an awesome responsibility as the church he took him to the end and he said the good samaritan taking the fallen falling man to the end he said he said that's we got to have a place like that there's got to be somewhere where and brother random talks about that just meant so much to me he said he said he the the innkeeper he said the pastor received payment he did from god not money the pastor received payment he said he he received he received direction from god and wisdom and he received the gifts of healing and the things that he would need i thought god i'm so glad that you give us provide for us what we need to care for the people but here the end the the samaritan has to bring the man to the end he said we got to have a place like that again in 1959 in baum and gilead brother the brandon says i wish this above all things that you hear tonight that who believes in your heart that you love the lord and something has happened to you he said i wish this above all things he said promise to me that you'll find a good gospel church somewhere a church that teaches the full gospel the power of god his resurrection join up with those people and make yourself a church home he said don't just stray around loose on the streets go get a good church somewhere of your choice where the gospel and the power of god is made known and the science of eternal life is in there the signs that was in christ amen amen that's what we're striving for isn't it that's what we believe we have amen by the grace of god christ said i am the vine you're the branches and the first vine that come out of the branch brought forth a pentecostal vine that went forth preaching the gospel amen he said signs and wonders if the follow the lord jesus followed that church if that vine produced that kind of a branch the first one the next line will have to produce he said the next branch will have to be like the first vine and every vine that comes off of that branch will be like the first one you say well brother ben my church home is is my home and that's wonderful your home ought to be a sanctuary do i believe i would never limit god if the only place you have to worship is your home make it a place of worship make it sacred right maybe you're not able to come to church maybe you're physically not able i know there's people who watch our services there's some people who watch religiously that we've never seen here at the church and i pray that god would still continue to bless them i don't i don't want to count them out or or say that they're not christians but by the same token you have to you have to have a home somewhere and what did brother branham define a church home as because again and this goes back to what we said you've got things you don't understand he said don't let that become a weakness because you don't understand what a church is find out what a prophet said a church is what the word says the church is right find out what what happened in the bible be willing to to learn or that will become a weak spot in your life and the devil used it all your life to destroy you and your family because it keeps you out of fellowship so what does the church home consist of brother branham says every man ought to have a church home you ought to have a place not just to float about from pillar to post he said but have somewhere and number one that you go to church right he said you call it your church somewhere you pay your tithes and somewhere that you help support the cause right that's a pretty good definition i think somewhere that you go to church somewhere that you call it your church so you don't just float around say where do you go to church and like my brother joel at one time comically was and he's watching i'm sure this morning but he was comically telling someone i think he was that brother andrew someone said where did you go to church he was at one of the andrews meetings he said where are you preaching next weekend and and that's that's funny but at the same time some people actually do that but there's got to be somewhere you go to church and you call it your church it doesn't mean sometimes you'll get sick and not be able to come sure you will there will be times you'll be on vacation that's that i'm not going to come digging you know digging at you because you go on vacation i'm going to take a vacation this year i don't want you calling me every day telling me i should be back unless there's a real issue right but you but you know you but you understand i you know you got to have some place he said but it's not perfect well it's only as perfect as god can make it and you're not perfect either right but somewhere you go to church somewhere you call it your church somewhere you pay your tithes somewhere that you help support the cause brother brown says take your choice but then don't never disfellowship the other man because he doesn't belong with your group that's denominationalism don't ever disfellowship the other man because he don't belong with your group what if you disfellowship people because you're a little offended by them or because they fellowship with certain people you don't fellowship with or because they maybe they even believe something a little different than you do now i'm not talking about out and out apostasy i'm talking about they just a little different and you just fellowship with them over that what's the difference in you in a denomination tell me what the difference is you're going to be like the church of christ and say we're not a denomination denomination say why well because we said so right i mean that's the only reason they're not a denomination they say we're not a denomination well it's got all the trappings of a denomination in fact maybe more denominational in mindset than anything else and that's where in the message we can get in trouble because oh we're not denomination but but do you cut people off because they don't agree exactly with the way you think it ought to be right he said don't disfellowship the other man because you don't belong with your group discern his spirit now watch this brother random taught this we should look at the spirit of a man even more than his doctrine we should look at his doctrine but more than that we should look at his spirit discern the spirit and see if he because his doctrine he could be corrected maybe he's wrong maybe he don't understand but if he's got the wrong spirit the wrong motives and objectives there's nothing you can do for him right he just needs a heart change you understand only god can do that but the doctrine can be corrected he said discern his spirit and see if he's got the same purpose in heart you got fellowship one with another and if we both want to see souls saved we ought to be able to have fellowship right we both want to gather under the blood we ought to be able to have fellowship and i hear this argument all the time that people say well when brother branham said that about going to a church home he was just being nice he was just saying what the preachers wanted him to hear what an awful thing to say about a prophet what a disrespectful thing to say about a prophet was he just telling us what we wanted to hear how can i have confidence in anything else he said right but listen what would you let brother branham tell you what he meant when he was telling people to have a church home brother brown said did you ever hear me when i'm making an altar call he said i say when i get them up there and get them saved i say now you go to some good full gospel church and get you a church home now we read four or five instances of that there are dozens well brother branham says that he said have you heard me say that how many have ever heard me say that sure he said why why would i send them there then would i be a hypocrite to send my own children to death far be it from me oh sir brother branham wasn't a hypocrite he was telling us the truth and that's what the word says assemble yourselves together even more as you see the day approaching now and and you say well i just have a hard time doing it but there's your weakness and you're hanging over hell by that right that that's you've got to guard that yes i know it's hard for some people some people just don't get along in crowds some people are introverts i know it's difficult but you're hanging over hell by that word and the bible says therefore to him that knoweth to do good and doeth it not to him it is sin now if you know to have a church home and don't do it the chain is broken i don't know what else to tell you say well brother brother ben i felt led you may have felt led but the spirit that led you against the word was wrong it was an evil spirit let's move on i i don't want to ever get to a place where i'm comfortable preaching uh hard things you understand i have to say it but i want to always be able to say it because i have the right motives in my heart you understand because i love you i don't ever get comfortable with just getting up and cutting people we got to have fellowship not just with the church our church but with the body of christ with the body of christ john 13 34 says a new commandment i give unto you that you love one another as i have loved you you also love one another by this shall all men know that you're my disciples if you have loved one to another if people had to judge you whether you were a christian or not based on your love for other message people in your area would they know you were a christian let that sink in and i'm not saying we you can't do everything for everybody you can't be everybody's close friend you understand you have a responsibility to your own church you can't fellowship with everybody but the desire ought to be there by this the love we have one for one another we'll travel overseas and i can't explain to you the difference and i think it's because they go through so much financially and physically that they just love one another and the churches tend to fellowship together more and there's a closeness that you're just all together and we're just piled up on top of one another i'll be honest sometimes i don't have you in my home maybe we've been living in a small place we're moving to a bigger place and i hope to invite you all over maybe not all at once but we'll have you all over but and maybe we will all at once son let's just plan that we get into this house but but when you're when you're together like that i was in manila in brother malevo's house and he watches some of these services as well but the closeness of it because his living room is about the size of this piano and but the pastors the other pastors would come in we had a the first marriage banquet that they'd ever had while i was there and it was 120 degrees or something like that we all dressed up everybody dressed up and i was about to die but they ate and had a marriage bank we went upstairs and i gave a a little talk to the married couples that were there was a wonderful time but the closeness of that fellowship you just don't get forth all that effort and gathered together there in just a tiny little place and i i'll never forget sitting in the in the pastor's house and and it's hot because there's only one room air conditioned that was mine and i wanted to get up there but i felt bad leaving those people and so everybody's sitting here in that in that space and in the house and i'm sitting there just just crammed together waiting on church to start i thought my goodness i'm going to see some of these people again i may never see them again i don't speak some of their language i don't know their name but i'm going to see them again and the closeness that i have here is going to be so much more over there and i got to i read my heart really went out to those people i thought i want to be around them i want i have there's something in me i want to be there and ever since i left i wanted to go back africa the same way i want to go back not because i could do something great for them but because i want to be around them and they said it's that kind of fellowship couldn't we be that way with each other they say familiarity breeds contempt but not with the holy ghost not with the people of god brother branham said this and i know i've probably taught you this before talked about it before but just bear with me a moment bear with me in my folly like paul would say the weather's real hot did you ever see sheep they won't separate themselves and one be at one place and one at another right in the heat of the day the sheep will all stand together i thought about that sitting there in manila in the pastor's home sitting there with all those people crammed in a room amen right in the heat of the day those countries where it's that much harder they fellowship that much more i talked to a man i want to go to his church sometime in the philippines that it i'll preach a youth a tent meeting there or a meeting in a tabernacle they're outside and this man had traveled seven hours by bus a pastor to be there in that meeting and was going to go back that saturday night and go back and preach i believe to his people and he made an effort to be there but right in the heat of the day they get that much closer together right in the heat of the day the sheep will all stand together you know what they're doing they're making shade one for another they're having fellowship and wouldn't it be good if all god's sheep when the heat was on would stand together when the trials are real hard and the heat is on and everything going on everywhere if all of god's little sheep would just stand together we'd have the coolness of the shade of each other the comfort to lean upon each other he said now someone said is that necessary brother branham it certainly is is that necessary it certainly is what we do as a church is necessary not just the services by the way but our fellowship together is necessary don't cut it short and i know some people there's always some people in every congregation that never want to go to the meal or something like that and it's okay you don't have to it's not a requirement but it's such a benefit to the body of christ to be able to stand in the shade and fellowship one with one with another he said there's nothing like having a good dependable friend he said that when the troubles are blazing the heat's on you can go to this friend and sit down and just explain it to them talk it over in personal confidence and then kneel down and pray together and know that this person is a god a good god-saved man or woman that you can put confidence in he said oh it's good to do that come let us reason together say it's the scripture and i love the way brother brandon puts this he said or come let us stand together i don't want to say anything i'm just going to stand with you you've been through a hard time you've lost a loved one i don't have to say anything i'll just stand there with you you realize what that means i'll just stand there with you and and just me standing there just me being there just you being in the service just you being at the function or whatever the fellowship the meetings that we're gonna have and and just you being there bring shade to somebody come let us stand together amen oh if we could only do that today stand together just be there he said and i noticed another thing when i see sheep in a cold country when the all the sheep he said the blizzards come to break the wind all those little sheep will come from one side of the field to the other huddle up together he said it keeps each other warm the warmth from each body helps warm the other and i think when the church gets real cold and indifferent god's sheep ought to kind of huddle up together and pray for each other how to pray for each other when i was a kid at brother brown's we used to sing when you when i pray or when you pray will you pray for me for i need his love and his care when i pray i will pray for you for you need his love and his care amen amen if we could just make that effort to come it means so much to pray for one another in the heat or the cold when he said the warmth of real good christian fellowship oh it means so much david spoke of it in the first psalm and said blessed is the man that said it's not in the seat of the scornful standeth in the way of sinners and brother brown types is to fellowship we think about it as someone who doesn't do bad things but brother brother said it's more than that blessed is the man who doesn't walk in the way of the ungodly what does that mean he's walking with the godly right if he don't sit in the seat of the scornful it means he's sitting with the people of god he's not standing in the way of sinners he's sitting there with the redeemed but his delight is in the law of the lord and the law does he meditate day and night and he shall be like a tree that's planted by the rivers of water and his leaves shall not wither whatsoever he doeth that shall prosper are we restored back i've got written down here conclusion my daughter got a hold of my sermon and she wrote here there is no conclusion the sermon never ends but we are going to close this morning you see there's something about a christian that is only satisfied by fellowship with other believers let me leave this with you this morning romans 15 24 i'm becoming less of an evangelist all the time you all forgive me romans 15 24 he said when so ever i take my journey into spain this is paul speaking and to kind of set the scene he's he's going to take an offering from the gentile saints to the jewish believers in jerusalem to the poor jewish believers who are in a famine during that time and being persecuted as well and he said whenever i take my journey into spain i will come to you for i trust to see you in my journey not just to leave this here with you you know brother branham wanted to do certain things he wanted to get a tent and put and pitch it in jeffersonville he wanted to do that paul wanted to go to spain you know he never did just because the prophet wants to do something doesn't mean it's to saith the lord right paul never went to spain but he said i will come to you for i trust to see you in my journey and to be brought on my way the other word by you if first i be somewhat filled with your company that's kind of a difficult phrase but paul was saying that i want to make sure i'm there long enough to fill up the the desire that i have for fellowship it's like i got a bucket and it needs to be filled up with fellowship and if i'm not there long enough he said i want to make sure i'm there long enough that i can be somewhat filled because i can never be fully filled he leaves the the idea that i can never be fully filled up with fellowship until we get over there there's just not time and plus we live in this flesh it hurts makes it hard to sit in church makes it hard to fellowship makes us gripe at one another right but he said i want to be at least somewhat filled by your company i just want to be close to you i want to spend some time with you now it's interesting because paul would have grown up being taught to hate the romans it would have been like a boy from the extreme deep south going to a a person a black person from the hood and this boy from the south has been taught to maybe from the deep south and i know it's not as prevalent as people think it is most of us you know are not raised that way we're not raised as much a racist but there are people who are raised that way to hate people of another color and he's he's coming from this deep south mentality where this deep racist mentality where he's like he's like i i've been taught to hate this person and coming together with this guy that come right out of the hood and he's coming together with him and saying oh i just want to be close to you i just want to be around you i want to spend some time with you what would make a man do that what would that why would he do that the leaves were on the tree in that early church the leaves were on the tree the fellowship hadn't been taken away and so there was a desire in the heart of paul why because they served the same god they had the same the same focus the same same goals to see others saved and he hears about this group in rome and he writes them a letter and he says i've never been there but i want to go and when i get there i want to make sure i get filled up with your company why did he want to see them so badly he had a longing for fellowship he could be somewhat filled by fellowship over here realizing that that fellowship could never really be perfect but it will be over there i read a poem wednesday musicians go ahead and come i read a poem on wednesday called walk slowly with grief and part of it was that you you have to give yourself time to grieve and you've got to give other people time to grieve and you've got to forgive yourselves yourself for conversations that you wish you had made wish you'd had and phone calls that you wish you'd made and never did because there's there's times there's things and i'm sure every one of us can go back in our own memories in our own mind and think of places where we should have talked to somebody more i had that with brother brown and he was always there when i called him but i've been meaning to call him for a few months and get to talk to him before he passed away that's my fault and yet you got to forgive yourself for that because there's coming a time of perfect fellowship there's going to be a day in a place where you can fellowship without any reservations the leaves are going to be on the tree but you know what i believe they're here now the restoration prophet come why why can't we have fellowship if malachi 4 and that's the great question is malachi 4 fulfilled in our time if it is then our hearts have been restored back to fellowship amen can we play in moments like these let's bow our heads together you forgive me a little tired today but i just wanted to talk to you about these things [Music] we serve a very real god and we we are very real people maybe there's something in your life today that you can look at is that that weakness that maybe it's going to church maybe it's not maybe it's something else maybe you just have a hard time getting along with people it's just something in your nature it's just that way [Music] maybe you have a hard time forgiving people forgiveness will unforgiveness will destroy you bitterness will destroy you in everything you touch don't let that be a weak place hear what a prophet of god was telling you not me but a prophet of god was speaking to you and telling you don't let that be a weak place maybe you have a problem where you you don't read your bible enough you don't pray that whatever it is don't let that be a weak place guard that spot do what you have to do to take care of that because the chain is only as strong as its weakest link i don't want no weak links in my fellowship with god i want to be exactly the kind of christian that he wants me to be and this is why we come to church we come to be washed out to be cleansed we come to hear from god i was convicted wednesday night even by the sermon the things that brother allen was saying and just repented a little bit in my own heart lord i want to be committed maybe this morning you feel the same way you raise your hands with me and say i i i want to guard that weak place i want to make sure i wrap myself in the word i want to make sure that i'm not responding out of the flesh but i'm doing things because god wants me to do them heavenly father lord jesus i have my own hands raised this morning lord and i'm sure there's some sitting in their living room or wherever lord of different families that couldn't come lord maybe they're raising their hands as well we're at that time lord where we want to be right lord we know the leaves have been restored back to the tree by malachi 4 may we be restored may our heart be turned back lord every day by your message that's why you sent it lord if there's a weak spot if there's something there a weak link in that chain oh god there's something puzzling to us something maybe we don't really understand help us to guard that spot make sure it doesn't become something that'll take us out of the house of god something that'll destroy our lives destroy our families oh god i pray for these that have lost loved ones lord some of them i just stood there with them that's all i could do i don't know what to say but lord if you would just come as only you can and comfort those families oh god i prayed lord as your prophet said that family was like a wheel and every time someone is lost it's like a spoke it's gone out of the wheel when we get to the other side we want that wheel to be complete again oh god we just we just think about the families the different ones lord i want all of my family to be there oh god somehow i don't see how you can do it but i know you can lord maybe i don't have enough faith to envision it lord but you you're able to do it lord and so i trust you today you'll take everyone that's lost every spoke that's missing lord and somehow it'll be there on that day somehow in your great mercy lord i'm so glad that you know more than we know i'm so glad lord that you reach farther than we can reach so glad you've forgiven away lord that we could never forgive because you don't just forgive our sin you forget about it you put it in the sea of your forgetfulness and so it never happened in the first place we're so grateful for that lord and even in your mercy lord you you provide a way even for those maybe that didn't do right didn't live right but god somehow even the ones maybe we think won't be there i pray there will be grace for them on that day but oh god as we serve you today we want to serve you with a whole heart we don't want to fall into hell lord because our families fall apart because that weak link in the chain was us oh god i pray you'd help us to take a stand for the word and to stand together lord in this end time heat lord may we stand together and provide shade to one another the leaves back on the tree i pray you'd grant it today deal with every heart deal with us lord oh god don't i don't want to pass this up lord but just just deal with our hearts root out may your holy spirit root out every every root of bitterness everything lord everything that would stop up the fellowship between us and you lord so we can be completely whole thank you for what you do today thank you for your word thank you for this church i pray you bless each one
