amen we've got we've got an announcement to make on the air condition system we're going to ask brother david to come and make that then we'll take up the prayer request and then the tithe and the offering we are going to replace the two old units so we was able to purchase one and it'll be in the next couple three weeks they'll start replacing it it was 87 87.67 was installed and everything so that'll be about what we can afford for the time being so we'll replace one unit and uh and get that done here in the next couple of weeks and that is coming down the general fund so uh if anybody would want to give towards that we'll be saving up to try to get the other unit replaced as quick as possible because they're hitting about 23 years old so we're going to try to get them replaced so just looking forward to that amen and keeping us cooler and maybe they won't die during our meetings next time amen amen we appreciate the air conditioning right you know i was talking to brother ben and brother joel after they got back from their mission trip and it's kind of sad i was telling them when i went i didn't go near as far as they did but i went to alaska in the middle of nowhere and those people walked to church in blizzards you know they've had kids get lost on the way to church and it's like i come back to america which i was in america i said that several times just forgetting that the lower 48 is you know it's it's up there with russia alaska is but it's still part of the united states and and you know i come back i was like man i just was mad at myself i was mad at other americans you know we're just so lazy and relaxed and you know but that's what we've gotten used to right you know we begin to talk about that you talk about people uh you know there's no doctors up there so their faith was a little bit more because that's all they had to rely on you know and you know sometimes i i wish that my faith could get there to where that was just what i wanted to rely on amen was him but we definitely love the lord we appreciate god giving us this building the air conditioning we i'm not complaining i don't want to go walk in a blizzard i want the air conditioning unit so so we appreciate that but if you want to give just let the trustees or the deacons know they'll take up the pray requests now this is from sister robin her grandpa's having a hard time being away from his home while he's in rehab it's making things very stressful on brother bill so just they just need peace and guidance so just be praying for brother bill and them there that god would just give them peace and guidance through this and and just help them along the way if you have an unspoken request if you want to just make it known by the uplifting of your hand we'll have our brother joel just come and take these needs for us and pray over the ties and the offering just play something softly sister mary let's bow our heads together if you have a knee just hold it before

yes what god has in store for us did you enjoy the service wednesday night yes amen just especially enjoyed that and appreciated the word there but let's sing this as a few times through as we invite him to come this morning [Music] jesus [Music] those precious bloodstains were made there just for me [Music] for all my sins my sickness and my pain when i need healing i just claim those precious

precious [Music] oh for all my sin every bit of it oh my sickness [Music] [Music] amen let's bow our heads together for a word of prayer heavenly father we're so grateful that we can claim the blood this morning what would we do without the all-sufficient blood the lord that was shed for our sins and not just the blood lord the human blood of someone that died long ago lord the blood of god that had the power in it to forgive sin and then when that blood cell was broken the spirit came back lord on us that we could be filled with the holy ghost or we could have the token in our day and walk with you every step of the way we're so grateful for that lord you give us power to live a victorious life we're so grateful for that today lord we can't do it without you we pray for healing today we claim healing over every every situation every every person lord in the hospital in the nursing home or these people that are here those that are watching lord and those that are on vacation lord you see the the needs that are out there oh god you see lord and even sometimes it looks like everything's going right but but there's a deep knee lord on the inside and i pray god you would meet that need this morning i pray you bless each and every one under the sound of my voice lord may they may they hear more than a man today move me out of the way and speak directly to your people we pray in jesus name amen amen amen do you love the lord this morning let's go to hebrews chapter 11 again hebrews chapter 11. we'll read verses 1 and 2 and then verse 31. it's good to have all of our visitors today and we got several of the home folks gone on vacation i trust they're having a good time but maybe some of them are watching and so we miss you today and then there's several out sick as well we'll be praying for them and believing that they'll receive their healing as the word goes forth this morning and of the presence of the lord uh hebrews chapter 11 and verse 1 tonight i will have our communion service and brother stewart's going to be speaking uh for us in that service we haven't heard him in a little while so we're looking forward to that but the joel's going to walnut ridge after the service tonight and their service starts at 6. i probably won't make it down there but if some of you want to and can handle three services in a day then you're more than welcome to go hear him down there as well we're proud of all of our young ministers and and i believe the lord is raising up he would not leave us without ministry in this day uh he doesn't god doesn't do that he doesn't leave his work incomplete at the end time but he has somebody who will stand for the message of the hour amen hebrews chapter 11 and verse 1 it says now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen for by it the elders obtained a good report and then i want to go down to verse 31 by faith the harlot rahab perished not with them that believed not when she had received the spies with peace amen i pray the lord would add his blessing to the word you may be seated this morning as we've been preaching about faith and the sixth sense and how to have the faith to uh to overrule these five senses of the of the flesh and the five senses of the spirit and we we want to be uh ruled by that inner man don't we we want we want the word to rule in our lives and yet we all live in these bodies and we have to learn how to yield ourself to that influence that comes from the inside now when paul begins to list these heroes of faith these ones who are able to ignore that's what a hero of faith is it's someone who's able to ignore the the things that are coming from the five senses of the body able to ignore the things coming from the five senses of the spirit and able to just look at the word and say lord the word is true it doesn't matter how i feel it doesn't matter what i see it doesn't even matter what i'm hearing if i hear the word i believe it but if what i hear is not the word i don't have to believe it i don't have to stand for it but if what i hear is the word i believe the word above all else i believe that the word is true and my body's not telling me the truth my mind won't tell me the truth my even my own heart the bible said very deceitful but if i hear the word i believe the word above everything else can you say amen to that today i believe the word and so paul lifts these heroes of faith who are able to do that and he finishes with rahab and it's interesting that he does that and and also that he doesn't just say rahab and he doesn't put her in her lineage if we know that she become the the mother of boaz but he actually and ends up in the lineage the natural lineage of christ but he calls her the harlot rahab yes the harlot rahab and and i want to lay this little foundation before we move on this morning that we want to deal with condemnation today because that's one of the six senses of the inner realm is conscience conscience and so that conscience is what brings condemnation right you have a conscience there's something there that tells you you've you're bad you've been bad and you have a memory right and there's very little you can do to forget in fact it's not in human capacity to forget and so paul knew when he was writing to the hebrews they would still know her as the harlot rahab yes they would still know about what she did they would still know about her story and how she had done these things the bible doesn't cover anything up it doesn't try to put anything in and say well they didn't do it anything like that but what it does is it actually highlights the testimony and so but it's not within human capacity to forgive and forget but it is to forgive because we're commanded to forgive right we can forgive we must forgive jesus says when you stand praying forgive me if you don't forgive you won't be forgiven you know how serious that is you cannot enter heaven with unforgiveness in your heart you've got to let go you've got to forgive no matter what somebody did you've got to forgive and yet yet we can't forget on our own you can't say i'm going to forget that you just remind yourself of it no you can quit thinking about it you can you can every time that thought comes you can you can reject it you can throw it aside but it's still there and someday there'll be a memory will spark and that conscience will spark and you'll feel guilty all over again you might be the best christian in the world you might have lived an exemplary life from that time that you got saved but when that that thing that happened you can't get that out of your memory so you've got to learn to ignore it i hope you're hearing me today you got to learn to let go of it let the past be the past paul says forgetting those things which are in the past and it doesn't mean that but but it's an active forgetting it's a it's choosing to forget and it'll come back up because that's memory that's conscious you still live but i choose to let those things go and press toward the mark of the high calling in jesus christ i choose to let today be today and not let to not yet not let yesterday mar today's experience are you with me now so now brother branham tells us the word justified as though you've never done it at all when you say i've been justified i've been saved how many of you have been saved this morning you believe you're saved that means that you're justified right i've been justified as though i've never done it all at all i've accepted the blood of christ as my substitute so now he said justify he said and then the blood of jesus christ cleanses us so from sin oh my till it's put in the book of god's forgetfulness he's the now watch he can do it he's the only one who can do it sometimes we we have condemnation because we can't forget and we feel bad about ourselves if i was really a christian i could let that go but the truth is you live in a body of flesh but you've got to learn to move on in spite of that yes there will be memories there'll be times and that's why i tell our young people you don't want to go out and get a testimony by leaving and going to the world no stay with god while you're young if i could just tell these young people sitting on the front and over here stay with god what a benefit it is to be able to stay with god and have that life that you know yes i didn't go into the world but i still know i was a sinner that needed a savior and when i needed a savior there was one there for me and then i don't have to worry so much about that condemnation coming over me because i know i've lived for god but yet even the best christian can feel condemnation and we have to learn to go to go past that so now brother branham said he's the only one that can do it we can't we can forgive but not forget i could forgive you but i'll always remember you done those evil things he said oh that's terrible brother ben you shouldn't be like that it's a human being men knew rahab had been a harlot yes they knew her life's story but oh my when you reach a point where you say i i can't forget it people can't forget it no one has been able to let my past go when you reach that point remember you have to trust in someone who can forget yes think about the greatness of god who knows everything yes he knows every time every flea and how many times it batted its high he knows every sparrow that ever fell to the ground he knows everything levi about your life everything that's ever happened and yet if you've repented of your sin he does not know it now that's the scripture he does not know it that thing that you're beating yourself up about that thing that you live under every day he does not know it he knows everything but he does not know what's under the blood or we could we could just end the service right there he does not know what's under the blood he does not know what's in the past other people know it the preacher knows it the deacons know it the people know it but he does not know it so i got to put my confidence in him i got to put my faith in him i got to give my life to him he does not know my sin i wish i could preach it he doesn't know it oh i know it but he doesn't so i trust him yes oh my now men knew she'd been a harlot god knew she was the mother of boaz he doesn't know your past but he does know your future now there are times and i've got to lay this foundation before we move on there's times when a good report or what the people know is it's necessary and this is why again to tell the children you want to serve the lord you want to serve the lord god can keep you from certain things so you can do that because there's times when a good report is necessary to do certain things like preach or be a deacon there's times it's necessary the bible tells us that speaking of a pastor or a bishop he must have a good report of them which are without i like the amplified version of that he said furthermore he must have a good reputation be well thought of by those outside the church why is that important because we deal in trust that's that's the currency of of ministry is trust people don't trust you they won't listen to you and and i will say that if you let a man preach that would split the church beca if you preach because his reputation is so bad to be pastoral malpractice but the man may be completely forgiven because a man who has truly returned to christ or a woman who's truly returned to christ is justified so they never did it in the first place but we deal in trust that's it we have a duty a fiduciary duty to the church you understand what that is we've been placed in something that it's bigger than us right we've been putting trust of something let's hold that with our lives let's hold on to our morality let's hold on to our standards as ministers and officers of the church brother brandon put it this way he said the preacher's called to preach is his sermon and to live it too if you can't live it stop preaching it you say well he's justified he never did in the first place he needs to stop preaching if he can't live it but you're supposed to live your sermons that's all of us hey man you can't change the past right sometimes even if you do your best to live a life above reproach when you go to do a work for god or even try to be a christian you feel condemnation some of you feel condemnation even when you testify to somebody because you know you were worse than them one day yeah sure but that ought to highlight the grace of god in your life that ought to just express yes i was i was a fraud i was i was outside the grace of god i was an unbeliever but i'm where i am today by the grace of almighty god but you feel this condemnation because you know how important the work is and so you might say even preachers sometimes what if i fail what if i'm not really as good a christian as the people think i am what about the mistakes that i've made we all make mistakes man he's going to be baptized today but many will make mistakes these young people sometimes they get baptized boy i'm a christian now i'm going to live for god now but they live in the flesh they're going to make mistakes but remember greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world he's still bigger than your mistakes don't ever no matter how big the mistake is don't ever neglect to turn right around and say god i know that you are bigger than that i know you can forgive me i know you will oh my now but your conscience will continue to chirp at you to chirp at you you remember pinocchio the story of pinocchio didn't start with walt disney it's an old story an old fable story pinocchio what did they make the conscience of pinocchio a cricket boy i don't have anybody to watch that when they were kids praise god you know jiminy cricket remember jiminy cricket he's always chirping at pinocchio he wasn't a very good conscience he was a conscience he made some mistakes but see that's your conscience but your conscience sometimes is wrong now in that movie they tell you let your conscience be your guide but that's sometimes wrong but you know it's that cricket that keeps you up at night when we were in egypt brother wilson woke up one morning and i mean he's dead to the world he just he didn't sleep and he walks out he's grumpy and excuse me brother wilson if you watch this but he was he was upset he was grumpy and what in the world happened to brother wilson well all night long there had been a cricket in his room and that thing every time he tried to sleep that thing chirped it talked to him every time he tried to sleep here he is in in a foreign land trying to do mission work and it's quick it's crickets peter's gotten used to that peter my son he lives in our basement so peter's gotten used to that peter's only 15 i hope you don't live in the basement very much longer but but he's gotten used to them crickets brother wilson couldn't handle it all night long that thing kept him up i wonder how many times we let crickets that's your conscience it keeps you up at night but see there's things that are under the blood yes that our conscience still bothers about us about see your conscience lies to you yes it sure it tells you you're still guilty of that you you haven't really repented you're not a real christian but if you've confessed your sin and you cl your heart is clean as we used to say your conscience is clear but remember your conscience it'll still come back because you have memory yes you remember it but god doesn't right yes sir you know brother wilson should have done to that cricket stomp it walk over there put your heel on it now you can't do that to your conscience but you can rule it by the word when the cricket gets to chirping you can say lord you're the god who gives your children sleep you're the god who who's forgave me you're the god who put my sin in the sea of your forgetfulness i'm not gonna let jiminy cricket keep me up at night are you with me now and so many good christians are afraid to do what they should do because their conscience chirps yes now watch but that's one of the senses of the spirit realm now you have to let the word be your guide not your conscience the bible says if our heart condemn us god is greater than our heart and knoweth all things rahab how did the heart at ray have who never could get over that reputation you think about it there's no way it was too public it was too much how could she believe in that instance that's what fascinates me about this story that she'd have so much faith because she wasn't believing in herself oh god she had confidence in the cord that was out the window she had confidence in that scarlet cord that token and the word of joshua's messengers that come to her and said we will not destroy you if you this token is on display we will not destroy you yes oh god and she had confidence in that so by faith rahab became the mother of boaz now listen to what she says joshua 2 and 9 she said to the men i know that the lord hath given you the land and that your terror is fallen upon us that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you now it's interesting what she says i know she didn't just say i've heard she didn't just say i what she had heard that's how the faith came but she didn't say i've just heard they had she had her that's the next verse but she had not go back to that previous verse first nine it says and she said unto men i know how did she know it was revealed to her yes right see for you to really believe for you to really have faith it's got to be a revelation brother madam deals with that in a message called perfect faith it also deals with it in works this faith expressed how that you have to have a revelation faith is a revelation by faith by faith abel offered a more excellent sacrifice than cain how did he do that it was revealed to him it was blood yes and it wasn't your blood or my blood it was the blood of a lamb a substitute amen the blood of thee lamb do you believe that today i know she says i wonder how many of us could cry out i know the lord has given you the land i know that the message of the hour is true no matter how many books i get in the mail no matter how much internet tries to take it away from me no matter how many people fail around me it doesn't matter i know that the lord has given you the land we can say that this morning i know there will be a rapture i know there will be a there will be a coming of christ i know that there will be a time when my body's going to be changed i know how do you know about revelation i know not because i've been a good person she could not rest in being a good person i hope you hear it today she could not rest in having done everything right and kept the commandments oh have you kept the commandments of the lord she could not say that she had the rich young ruler could and he denied christ walked away from him but here was the woman who had done everything wrong who'd been in the worst places you could possibly be and she said i know yes sir i know that the lord has given you the land glory why did you know for we have heard verse 10 of the lord dried up the water of the red sea for you faith comes by hearing the word of god amen faith come by here in joshua 2 11. he said and i'm trying not to keep you very long so we'll just move through these things quickly i'm trying not to hold you very long so we've got the baptism and then communion tonight now she said as soon as we had heard these things our hearts didn't melt neither did there remain any more courage in any man verse 12 says now therefore i pray you swear unto me by the lord since i have showed you kindness that you will also show kindness unto my father's house give me a true token not based on how i made my living in the past but i heard the message how many have heard a message today i've heard the message not my message a message god sent by prophet but it wasn't the prophet's message the message is christ amen we heard a message we heard a voice yes and she said i've heard a message i believe the message give me a true token yes i want something that'll keep me i want something that'll make my house stand when others fall oh that's what you need today when you see the world going going down when you see public schools becoming what they are and my kids are out there among that i see that and i see how they become more and more worldly less and less like like christ the world is they're just becoming more and more worldly because they don't have no bible no more they don't have no teaching anymore and i've told you stories about my kids some of them didn't even know what a bible was the kids they go to school with they didn't know anything about it my kids try to talk to them about the word they don't even have a basis for it because they don't believe anything that's the world we live in today but in a time like that you need something that's going to keep your children in a in a world like that in a culture like jericho's you need something that's going to make your house sin when the world is shaking around you there's got to be something what's going to do it it's not going to be a preacher or because you go to a certain church or how many tapes you listen to but it's because there's a scarlet cord hanging out the window sir amen you have a true token the holy spirit in your life yeah you know you're gonna make it hallelujah hallelujah amen now let's look how do you deal with condemnation in your spirit number one you turn from every action which is condemned by the word if you're doing something that's wrong stop yeah oh but i can't brother ben stop if you can't you need to pray to the one who has the power ask him to help you i know you can't do it in the flesh but then with the spirit of god we can do all things yes first john 3 21 he goes on to say beloved if our heart condemn us not then have we confidence toward god so if you're doing things no and here's the problem you can't overcome that condemnation when you're doing something you know is wrong and it afflicts your conscience and then you can't overcome that condemnation because the word won't back you up right now the memories of past sins that's been forgiven you can overcome that by the word but when you're doing something you know it's wrong that's why people are so miserable when they're backslid because they're doing things they know is wrong yes i know i'm supposed to be in this place or do this thing and i'm just not doing it and so they get so miserable because they can't overcome that by the word because the word is constantly preaching at them right it's not the preacher or the tape they listen to or the stream that they're watching it's the word that does it but see the word oh my the word doesn't have to condemn you the word offers forgiveness the word offers grace but you've got to be willing to let go of the things that you're doing that's repentance turn around not just say i'm sorry but turn around walk a different direction stop trying to worship under condemnation it's just a show you're trying to worship god and you can't seem like it and sometimes people can't move in church and can't seem like they can ever put their hands up can't seem like they can ever worship why because they got such condemnation stop trying to worship under condemnation if the condemnation is coming and you have word to back you up get rid of it and if there's no word to back you up get rid of the sin you say how can you do that there's a place you can leave it oh my you can leave it at the foot of the cross today it takes a moment to repent of it but don't try to worship under condemnation it's impossible you'll never get what you need under condemnation you've got to come out of that and embrace the scripture it says there is therefore now no condemnation you've got to embrace the cross grab hold of it it's mine but if there's things in your life i obviously need to be made right and everybody knows it make it right not harsh that's just the truth make it right do the right thing yes young people do the right thing oh but you don't understand my past do the right thing you know what's right do justly love mercy walk humbly before god do the right thing jesus tells us if you bring a gift to the altar and remember that your brother hath ought against thee leave your gift before the altar and go your way first be reconciled to thy brother and then come and offer the gift because if you offer the gift under condemnation it doesn't do you any good right you can't have a clear conscience brother branham in the message perfect faith deals with the disciples and the epileptic child and deals with this in matthew 17 and 19 is where it is in the scripture and and they had failed to cast out this demon that was in the child of epilepsy and the child jesus came and he rebuked them oh you have little faith and he cast the devil out and they come to him afterwards and said master why could we not cast him out and jesus said unto them because of your unbelief yeah i said wait a minute now watch these men had been given power they'd been given the ability to cast out devils by the word but they couldn't have the faith to do it in this case he said because of your unbelief he said verily i say unto you if you have faith as a grain of a mustard seed he said if you even have the slightest bit of real faith you could move a mountain with it oh you said brother ben i need more faith what you need is faith it's a grain of a mustard seed it'll move a mountain but what you need is pure faith mustard seed is pure it's not mixed yes right you have faith as a grain of a mustard seed you should say to this mountain remove hence to yonder place that shall remove and nothing should be impossible nothing let me say nothing this morning nothing howbeit this kind goeth not out by but by prayer and fasting now watch how he ties it to their lives yes now he says you've been given power but now here you don't have faith and it's because this kind don't go out but by prayer and fasting he said now remember they had the power jesus had given them power to heal the sick to raise the dead to cast out devils just a few days before that they had the power but not the faith to use the power he said now there's the branham tabernacle there's the church the bride today how many believe you're the bride well brother branham's identifying why sometimes we can't cast these things out he's saying it's because we have the power we're not looking for the power we're not waiting on a tent meeting we're not waiting on another time we're not waiting on some big preacher we're not waiting on something else what do we have we have the power who has it you have it yes right right melody has it right by the word joel has it by the word brother bill has it by the word you have it you have the power the power's not in the preacher you have the power the word gave you the power how many believers do we have in here today raise your hand be proud if you're a believer if you're a believer you have the power your belief gives you the power to cast out devils the fact that you're a believer that places you in the class where that word goes to work for you now watch but if you're a believer but you've got to have that perfect faith to be able to use that power yes are you with me now but the man said that there's the church the bride today the holy spirit is here with the power but you haven't got that faith to move it see what i mean it takes faith to move it he said here i got a shell that i hand loaded he said i know what it'll do by ballistics like the word but i've got to fire the gun you hunters all understand that better than i do but he said i've got to fire the gun the fire has to get to the powder i know this i used to be with brother nolan noley's totally was named after brother nolan you may not want me to say that publicly but i believe that's the case and brother nolan he used to pack his own shells and we would go out and shoot his shells were never as good as the original out of the box you always get a lot more hate say that about a good brother but there's a lot more uh blanks a lot more problems now but he could make them even more powerful if you put enough powder in them and that's all i know about shells just watching him do that right never done it myself but the powder's got the power it's got to have fire yeah oh god oh that's what we need today we've got the power what we need is the fire the fire of faith we need the fire we've got the power but we need the fire he said the powder's got the power but it's got to have the fire to light it off and the same thing the powder's in the shell but it needs faith to charge it and throw it out that's what it takes see perfect faith are you with me this morning perfect faith to ignite the power of the holy spirit which we have now he didn't say we're waiting on it we're oh arms and limbs will be spoken on one day right now you have the power if you can believe all things how many things are limited when you say all none of them that's right all things are possible see he said perfect faith that's what it takes perfect faith to ignite the power of the holy spirit which we have now since he's come upon us faith to ignite to see great things again he said the disciples had power jesus gave them power to heal all manner of sickness to cast out devils to cleanse the lepers to raise the dead he gave them power but they didn't have faith to operate the power that they had and then they questioned jesus and said well now why couldn't we do it he said now remember they had the word and the word was flesh then and the word told them i give you power they had the power but they didn't have faith to operate the word that was in them yes i hope you hear me today jesus had he was the word he had faith that what he said would happen he said oh bring him here how long will i suffer you he had faith with his power he said how did he he said i can do nothing in myself well he was virgin born and he still had to ignore the flesh are you hearing me his five senses didn't want to go to the cross his five senses told him he was hungry his five senses told him he couldn't make it his senses told him that just like yours does he had the same outlet he had five senses of the flesh five senses of the spirit he was human like we are but he was virgin born but he was made in a manner like us he was god's creation but he was a man yes i hope you hear me today he had the power but he said i do nothing in myself he said he relied upon what he was yeah i love this he relied and not on how he felt right but he relied o god he relied in knowing that he was the word right glory he had faith in god who made him the word he was god i'm fixing to shout for all of you he was god the word and they was in him and that gave him faith now watch he's talking about they he's listed some scriptures that was in him and he said he was god the word and those scriptures was in him yes gloria's got to come more than just off the page it's got to come in us i got to calm down i'm going to get in trouble look he was god the word and they was in him and that gave him faith because he understood his position he knew what he was not what the people say him that's what rahab knew i'm not what the men say that i am i'm not what the king of jericho says i am i'm not what the people say i am i'm who god says i am sir glory can you hear that today i'm who god says i am i belong to him not to these others and jesus knew who he was he knew what he was amen he said he relied upon what god had made him and if he did that can't we rely upon what god made us as believers these signs shall follow them that believe he said he had faith in what he was and if you are a believer you have faith in what you are you are a believer and if you've got faith in god the bible says if our hearts condemn us we can't have faith but if our hearts don't condemn us and we have faith we have confidence towards god he said but as long as you're doing things that's wrong you can't have confidence towards god that's it you realize once you're saved doing something wrong doesn't make you a sinner right you can't sin what it does is it tries to eat at your confidence yeah sure and knowing that who wouldn't want to do the right things he said but brother ben i can't again you're a believer you have the power you just have to have the faith to operate it yes so but if you're doing these things that are wrong you can't have confidence towards god you automatically that's why people are so condemned oh god help us today and again you got to be able to separate that because there's some people i watch some of the most condemned people that i deal with some of the most are the best saints the ones who pray the most and they're under such conviction all the time am i doing wrong you'll see them at the altar praying you'll see they'll come and talk to me am i doing wrong is there something wrong with me but but it's satan he comes into that memory and that conscience and he comes down and tries to destroy that confidence you've got to be able to separate that but if you are doing things that are wrong yes you can't have any confidence that's right because you got no word to back you up he said you'll automatically know that you're wrong you automatically put now watch you're not a sinner but you put yourself as a sinner yes yeah boy i hope this helps you it doesn't mean because i'm a preacher i'm a pastor sometimes i feel like a sinner let's be honest with you and it's not because of anything that necessarily that i've done is conscious memories right now you either are a christian or you're not right you take communion tonight some people refuse to take communion they just won't take communion because they feel like well i'm not worthy of it well have you repented well you say well no no well why don't you well wherever right now yes sir you don't have to tell somebody else about it unless it's something you've done to somebody it needs to be made right there's a place for that but if it's something that you've done and it's between you and god you got to make that right with god how long does that take you can do it in the song service you can do it right now you can be ready for communion tonight why because you believe god you believe god over yourself my mind tells me that i'm not right my body tells me but my faith tells me i'm a believer hallelujah my faith tells me i'm eligible to be married to christ oh god oh i'm telling you what your reputation might make you ineligible for some things but it'll never make you ineligible to to marry christ oh god because what he he can forgive and forget and you could be just as much the bride as anybody else ever was get away from that old legalist to think well i don't know if i can be the bride or not you need to let go of that you need to believe that god called a harlot rahab and put it right in the lineage of god you need to believe that god called tamar and put her right in the limits of the lineage of god you need to believe that god called women there in the new testament and a woman who was accused of committing adultery was caught in the very act and jesus said i don't condemn you that's right you need to believe that but then i do believe that then let the condemnation go yes and you how do you do that we'll show that in a minute i'm getting way ahead of myself maybe that's a good thing because i'm almost out of time hey man i might just get past some of this brother robert you're gonna have to try to find me jesus knew who he was without a shadow of a doubt he knew he was the son of god he knew it for the word identified the word of god identified who he was he said if i do not the works of my father don't believe me but if i do then believe the works for they are the manifested word promised he said oh if you could just wake up to that a minute you see the word itself identified him who he was and he said who can condemn me of sin well i love it in other words who can show me that my life and my works don't fulfill exactly what messiah should do nobody could say nothing for he was glory that's the kind of life he wants us to live you can't do that on your own that takes the holy ghost he said then he had faith to believe then of whatever he said it would happen then he turned around and said the works that i do show you also a little while the world says no more yet you shall because i'll be with you even in you take no thought what you shall say for it's not you that speak it's the father that dwelleth in you he's the one who does the speaking amen rehab had been a heart of but something changed in her house her faith caused her to perform the works of a believer she didn't keep living that way but she believed and james 2 25 tells us that rahab was justified by works do you know that now he's presenting the other side of it brother branham said brother brown said paul saw what god sees yes amen james saw what man sees and so now he says likewise also was not ray have the harlot justified by works when she had received the messengers and then sent them out another way as the body without the spirit is dead so faith without works is dead also works for the brandon said is faith expressed you ever thought about that title works is faith expressed when the word is revealed to you that moment you act on it and your own action of faith gives you confidence in god's word brother said the actions that they took shows us that they believed that they had a revelation of faith the fact that she hid the messengers shows us she had a revelation of faith amen now notice so you you if you're doing something wrong quit yeah stop making excuses but secondly when you know you have believed the message of the hour and the token is on display take every condemning thought and put it under arrest right bind it yes you can't help but have it but you can bind it the scripture says cast down imaginations and everything that exhausts itself against the knowledge of god and brings into captivity every thought we don't guard our thought life enough right the problem is unguarded moments you realize some people trying to be spiritual leave their mind unguarded because they want to be spiritual they want to they want to have all this uh these great spiritual happenings and i believe in those things but sometimes in doing that you leave your mind and heart unguarded and so you end up under condemnation because satan brings thoughts in those quiet moments if you're in a quiet moment make sure you're meditating on the word otherwise you'd be better off working because if you leave yourself open that's why there's always got to be a balance in our lives if you leave yourself open to those things especially young people if they're idle these things come into their mind and begin to work on them begin to don't be idle find something to do i'm glad i grew up when i left home i was poor mostly self-imposed but i was poor and i had to work i thought such a terrible thing to have to work and to have to preach and and to have to get ready to get married and working three jobs and trying to get ready to get married and and then get engaged and plan for a wedding which i didn't really have any part of anyhow and all those except to be there and all those things that we had to do you know and and i thought oh that's so terrible i can't wait for a day but you know when you have more time you have more thoughts so i believe in keeping kids busy i told somebody if my kids show up in my house and i'm there i feel like it's my job to give them something to do that's why they like going to school but now look we got to bring into captivity those thoughts you're going to have them how many brother ben every thought but it feels good to have that thought take the thought bind it listen you men are going to deal with lustful thoughts that's part of being a man bind it oh i'm under condemnation i had a lustful thought find it cast it out yes get rid of it well that was what rahab had to do she had to because she lived that way yeah she'd been there those memories would come but she bound them i'm not who i was are you with me now yes oh god why could she do that because she knew joshua had honored the token right now watch there's got to come a confidence in your life in a time this is growing up in christ there's a moment when you display the token and then you have to have confidence that god honored that you've grown up you've seen the bill and sister karen know that you've seen that down through your life that token was on display god honored it and no matter what other people say god honored my token are you with me now but jt knows that you elderly elderly people i don't want to call all of you out that but you know that sister betty you know that god there's to come a point in your life god honored that token you put it on display and when you did you you got rid of the things that were wrong and and your life changed you cleaned up and the holy spirit come in your life and then one day something happened and seemed like everything shook around you but you didn't shake seemed like everybody else left everybody else gave up maybe a church full of people that you went to church with you knew you were young but now you look back and you're old and hardly any of them in church but you still are why are you still in the house of god why are you still standing after extreme difficulty why did you come back after making mistakes because there was a token and god is honoring that token oh god you are not destroyed oh god he honors that applied token in my life see he honored it yes i don't really care if you do or not all right when it comes to this you understand there's positions in the church things where you have to watch what you do and all of this but when it comes to the word who i am in christ yes i don't care who else honors me yeah the token honors me yeah god honored the token you could say you can believe anything you want to believe say what you want but has has god honored the token in your life look she perished not with them that believed not now brother branham said anyone knows anything about the bible knows that harlot was predestinated yes oh glory to god she sure was she perished not with them and believed not but she believed the message of the hour no he said the same oath is today the same oath i promised brother andrew i wouldn't preach on it but we've been talking about the first see what brother branham said the mighty angel said stood up there i'm going to put his foot on land and see and he stood up there and he raised his hand toward heaven and brother brown said he presented a sworn affidavit to the church yes he made an oath the bible says he swore by himself glory he did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son amen that's why that was his sworn affidavit i will not let you perish that's my oath he says amen romans 8 let's read it before we go romans 8 28 we know we know there it is there's a revelation we know that all things work you might think it you might hear it but you got to know it we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are called according to his purpose for whom he did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate then he also called whom he called then he also justified whom he justified them he also glorified he didn't leave one who shall what shall we then say to these things if god before us who can be against us are you hearing me today who can be against rahab he despaired not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things who shall lay anything to the charge of god's elect it is god that justify it yes oh glory who is he that condemneth it is christ that died they say well you did this prove it you can't prove it by the judge amen because he come down as a wig to judge a judge in this hour showed himself he went through a prophet's ministry and showed that he would he would separate the right from the wrong what is it it's god that justifies who is he that condemneth it's christ that died hey rather that has risen again it was even at the right hand of god who also maketh intercession for us who shall separate us from the love of christ tribulation i've heard this before hear it again and know it get a revelation of it oh let it sink down into your heart who shall separate us from the love of christ show tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter nay and all these things we are more than conquerors someone say more than conquerors more than conquerors to him that loved us amen i'm one more than overcome hallelujah we are more than conquerors to him that loved us i am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels no principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor death nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord hallelujah do you believe that today amen now listen god didn't just save rahab can we get to this before we close he gave her a home brother brandon said through a conversion and through her unfailing faith in god it brought her from a prostitute house to a beautiful home in bethlehem that's the way it does all of us from a house of unbelief and frustrations and immoral acts and everything to a place position in christ which is most beautiful and we find out they had a lovely home in bethlehem a salmon had established it and it would become a great place and the fertile lands now watch can you imagine someone coming to bethlehem years after rahab has set up her house she's living as a housewife she don't look like she used to yeah let me tell you find a home in bethlehem you won't look like you used to she didn't look like that no more she didn't look like a harlot she didn't have a reputation in that area but say someone would come and they would come down and they would come knock on the door looking for hospitality rahab opens the door she looked at her and said i think i've seen you before wait a minute didn't you used to have a house in jericho many years ago didn't you used to be a harlot oh god could you imagine how it must make her heart feel the condemnation that she might have felt and then my teller said whoa what did you do to deserve all of this did you tell your husband the truth does he know what if he found out and she might have said he already knows he knew me before i did it but joshua honored my token joshua means jehovah's savior it's a it's a hebrew form of jesus amen he honored my token i don't live in a house of prostitution anymore but i want to tell you though that is quite a story if you think about it it would never happen do you know why it would never happen in her home in bethlehem turn to joshua 6 21. you see oh god she lived in a city that had been destroyed everything she ever did was in her old home you're a new creature in christ everything you ever did was in your old home come on i wish i i'm just going to take off running around the church and y'all yes everything she did was in jericho and jericho was utterly destroyed see if you if you if you have a probably think well maybe i'm not really saved but just make sure that the fire of god has gone down to the old home and destroyed all the evil habits destroyed the atmosphere destroy the don't you realize that's going to happen one day to this earth that all the atmospheres of remembrance all the things that would come you won't even they won't be able to come in heaven and say didn't i know you weren't you the one who did that weren't you the one oh my that stepped out of the grace of god they won't know because you're in your new home all right come on they were utterly destroyed every person that could have stood an accused term right glory to god i saw this yesterday my wife was cleaning the church she'd come in there she said what's wrong with you i couldn't tell her i did it in my old home yes but i got a new home and if this earthly tabernacle be dissolved i have another one waiting already waiting in the heavens oh wait do you see my new home hey bad but joshua said to the two men that despite out the country going into the harlot's house bring out vince the woman and all that she has is he swearing to her it was just her and her family all of her accusers were dead yes i never thought about that before all of her accusers were dead what did what did the bible say would happen to you you have to read the book of revelation you say well there's going to be this plague in this plague let's see what the bible says at the end of all of that oh when all these things are over remember he said i heard a loud voice in revelation 12 10 saying in heaven now has come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our god and the power of his christ for the accuser that accusing city yes that city full of accusations has been brought down oh my the city has been brought down the accuser of my brethren is cast down which accused him before our god day and night as long as she lived in jericho there was always accusation there was always condemnation but when she made her home in bethlehem then there can therefore now be no condemnation anymore for those who walk in the not after the flesh but after the spirit that's the one who lives in bethlehem hallelujah what did they overcome him by he accused him before our god day and night but they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony they believed amen and the blood of the lamb becomes effective when you put your faith in it amen the only thing in bethlehem yes that could condemn rahab was her own memory yes and one day that won't even be a problem wipes away all memory of sin as we said the woman caught in adultery she come jesus stood there and here she was and all the men had drifted away because he said the one without sin let him cast the first stone in their conscience convicted all of them he said woman where are the accusers and she said does any man accuse he said no man lord and jesus said to her neither do i condemn me the only one who could condemn you there won't go and sin no more there is therefore now musicians go ahead and come no condemnation no condemnation doesn't that sound pleasant sound like a good place to live build your home in bethlehem live for god go to church be a christian a real christian there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus who walked not after the flesh but after the spirit would you bow your heads with me maybe you find yourself this morning in that class of people who have condemnation because of things they're doing right now if that's the case why don't you just
