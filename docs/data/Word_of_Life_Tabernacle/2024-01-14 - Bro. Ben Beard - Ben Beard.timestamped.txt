[37:14] blessing to us and uh we certainly
[37:16] appreciate it every time he comes our
[37:18] way and and so we we felt like maybe

[37:37] greetings from our little local assembly
[37:39] there at Galina we dismissed some our
[37:42] services this morning so I believe we've
[37:44] got a few of our own Home Folks
[37:46] streaming this morning so I want to say
[37:48] God bless them as well this morning amen
[37:51] so we'll turn our attention right here
[37:53] to the word this morning and uh 2
[37:56] Corinthians chap 11: 2 we'll read one
[37:58] verse of scripture there then we're
[38:00] going to turn over to Romans chap 11 and
[38:03] we'll begin reading with verse one there
[38:05] but to open let's read here Paul
[38:07] speaking he says for I'm jealous over
[38:10] you with Godly jealousy thank the Lord
[38:14] for I have espoused you to one husband
[38:17] that I may present you as a chased
[38:21] virgin to Christ oh yes amen then Romans
[38:25] chap 11
[38:27] verse
[38:30] one I say then hath God Cast Away his
[38:34] people God
[38:36] forbid for I also am an Israelite and
[38:39] the Seed of Abraham of The Tribe of
[38:43] Benjamin God hath not Cast Away his
[38:46] people which he fornew oh thank you oh
[38:50] my what ye not what ye not what the
[38:54] scripture saith of Elias how he maketh
[38:57] intercession to God against Israel
[38:59] saying Lord they have killed thy
[39:02] prophets and dig down thine altars and I
[39:05] am left alone and they seek my
[39:08] life but what saith the answer of God
[39:11] unto him I have reserved to myself 7,000
[39:16] men who have not bowed the knee to the
[39:19] image of Baal even so then at this
[39:23] present time
[39:24] also even so then at this present time
[39:29] also there is a Remnant according to the
[39:31] election of Grace and if by Grace then
[39:35] it is no more of Works otherwise Grace
[39:39] is no more Grace but it but if it be of
[39:42] works then it is no more grace otherwise
[39:45] work is no more work what then Israel
[39:48] hath not obtained that which he seeketh
[39:51] but the election have obtained hath
[39:54] obtained it and the rest
[39:57] were blinded God bless you you can have
[39:59] your seats for just a little while this
[40:02] morning I'd like to take a thought if we
[40:05] may this morning if it'd be pleasing to
[40:07] the Lord and I'd like to look at a
[40:10] thought and call it a bride of his own
[40:13] choosing all right a bride of his own
[40:17] choosing now we realize that as we begin
[40:19] to look at this thought and we begin to
[40:21] just lay a little Foundation this
[40:24] morning just a little disclaimer of to
[40:26] the uh to the cameramen back there I'm
[40:29] not much of a Pulpit preacher so you're
[40:31] going to get have your work cut out for
[40:33] you so I apologize for that in advance
[40:35] but uh this morning as we begin to lay a
[40:39] little Foundation we realized that a a
[40:42] that that that a young man we realize
[40:44] that the prophet of God would say he'd
[40:46] say that that God chooses his bride and
[40:49] as a young man would choose his bride
[40:52] amen God also chose His Bride and we
[40:55] realize amen that that that that a young
[40:58] man as he would be amen he would be
[41:00] looking amen for a bride and and he
[41:03] would there would be many different
[41:04] women there would be many different
[41:06] young ladies that would no doubt cross
[41:08] his path amen there would be many no
[41:10] doubt that would would maybe uh uh come
[41:13] across his path but but there would only
[41:15] be one ultimately that would would turn
[41:18] his head amen and and we realize that
[41:21] Christ amen he would he would uh he
[41:23] would uh elect a bride he woulde
[41:26] destinate a bride before the foundation
[41:28] of the world Amen brother Brown said in
[41:30] the invisible Union of the bride of
[41:32] Christ in 1965 he says now that's my
[41:35] message to you Church you that's a union
[41:37] a spiritual union by the word that
[41:40] you're dead to these old husbands and
[41:43] you're born a new don't try to dig him
[41:45] up he's dead if you're born again in
[41:48] Christ that little germ that was
[41:50] predestinated to you it's word coming on
[41:53] word on word on word on Word word and it
[41:57] come into the full stature of Christ
[41:59] that's right so so he can come get his
[42:02] bride he says now we're ready for one
[42:04] thing and that is the coming of the Lord
[42:08] amen we got this one waiting on that one
[42:10] and this one's waiting on this and that
[42:12] and that I'm not waiting on anything
[42:14] other than the coming of the Lord amen
[42:16] you begin to realize amen as we look
[42:18] around the world today amen the world is
[42:21] falling apart amen the world around us
[42:23] amen there there's wars and rumors of
[42:25] wars earthquakes and this and that and
[42:27] the other but look up little bride cuz
[42:29] your Redemption is drawing nigh amen so
[42:32] we realize now that as as we would begin
[42:34] to look we realize amen we we we
[42:37] remember the story that the prophet of
[42:39] God would tell amen of that young lady
[42:41] that and the and the the Rancher's boss
[42:44] how that he would come and he would look
[42:46] for a bride amen and he would come and
[42:48] all of these Brides these young ladies
[42:50] they would be sitting there amen and
[42:52] they would say all the bo the ranchers
[42:55] the the bosses son is coming amen and
[42:58] they would begin to get themselves ready
[43:00] and they would put this on and they
[43:01] would put that on Amen and they would
[43:03] they would stand there in the frill of
[43:05] everything and they would say I'm going
[43:07] to be that one amen that would be
[43:09] elected I'm going to be that one that
[43:10] would be chosen amen and he would walk
[43:13] in and he would begin to see everything
[43:15] that all that them young ladies had done
[43:18] and he would look and it would actually
[43:19] turn his stomach he would say this isn't
[43:21] what I'm looking for amen I'm not
[43:23] looking for the the the the the the the
[43:26] the lights and all of the frill but I'm
[43:28] looking for a genuine honest heart I'm
[43:31] looking for character I'm looking for
[43:33] something that goes much deeper than ski
[43:36] amen so he would begin and it we realize
[43:38] that the prophet of God would say he
[43:40] walked outside and he begin to he seen
[43:43] this young lady walking barefooted and
[43:45] she was washing the dishes come on
[43:47] somebody he was washing the dishes amen
[43:50] and as she was washing the dishes she
[43:52] would be begin to sing a song and
[43:54] something in out side of him identified
[43:57] with something inside of her amen what
[43:59] was it he saw that there was a bride
[44:02] there amen there was something there
[44:04] that was bride
[44:06] materialen so he would come and he would
[44:08] begin to talk to her and he would say he
[44:10] would introduce himself and all my
[44:12] brother Ben she would begin to stutter
[44:14] and she would begin to stumble over
[44:16] herself amen why is the boss's son
[44:18] talking to me I'm not worthy of that I'm
[44:21] not worthy that he would come to my
[44:23] place I'm not worthy that he would talk
[44:25] to me but there was something inside of
[44:27] her that identified with what was inside
[44:30] of him and he come to her and he begin
[44:32] to talk to her and she begin to say I'm
[44:35] not worthy no you're not worthy but he
[44:38] is worthy I don't know where you're at
[44:40] this morning but if you need something
[44:43] from God today is your moment it's your
[44:47] time in the presence of the
[44:50] master amen so he'd begin to talk to her
[44:53] amen and she'd begin to stumble and she
[44:54] would begin to amen she would begin to
[44:57] uh uh uh uh uh uh say what are you doing
[45:00] here why are you talking to me and he'd
[45:01] say I'm not after all of this out here
[45:04] yeah but I'm after something that has
[45:07] character yeah yes sir amen so he would
[45:10] begin to talk to her amen and he would
[45:12] say look he would say I want to tell you
[45:15] something I've seen all of this out
[45:18] there but I'm telling you I'm going back
[45:21] home come on but when you start seeing
[45:23] the the the the the the flow flers out

[45:33] that time when the when the trees begin
[45:35] to bust I'm coming back for you and what
[45:38] was it he said the prophet of God said
[45:40] amen as every day she would begin to as
[45:43] that time would get near and the the
[45:45] trees begin to Bud forth look up little

[45:50] Israel when that when that fig tree

[45:57] begin to see how that Israel amen where
[45:59] they're at today amen and what they're
[46:01] dealing with what is it it's nothing
[46:04] more than prophecy being fulfilled

[46:09] little bride amen that is ready and
[46:12] willing to take a Rapture oh yeah amen
[46:15] oh my what a happy people we should be

[50:30] message theologians all right that's
[50:32] okay you got too many message
[50:34] theologians amen and they got this and
[50:36] they got that and really all it is is

[50:43] building a kingdom for myself but I'm
[50:45] interested in adding to the kingdom of
[50:48] heaven glory to God I'm not interested

[50:58] about cry the the the getting the bride

[1:00:13] this choosing of the bride was purposed
[1:00:16] within himself oh yes Ephesians 1:9 says
[1:00:22] having made known unto us the mystery of
[1:00:24] according to his good pleasure which H
[1:00:27] he hath purposed in himself in Romans
[1:00:29] 9:11 it says that that the purpose of

[1:01:43] carefully now and see this before there
[1:01:46] ever was a speck of
[1:01:49] Stardust before God was
[1:01:52] God glory because God is an object of
[1:01:55] adoration no one was there for to
[1:01:58] worship him so he was at the time only
[1:02:00] potentially God and he was known only as
[1:02:03] as an eternal spirit but the bride was
[1:02:06] already in his

[1:05:44] behavior we have studied that and proven
[1:05:46] that already God is infinite in his
[1:05:48] ability so therefore he he he as God
[1:05:51] must be omniscient and if is omn ient
[1:05:54] then he is not now learning nor is he
[1:05:56] taking counsel even with himself nor is
[1:05:59] he at any time adding to his knowledge
[1:06:02] can I say something here in other words
[1:06:05] God can't have a new
[1:06:06] thought or a wrong thought yes sir God
[1:06:11] didn't make a mistake when he thought of
[1:06:15] you come
[1:06:16] on God didn't make a mistake when he
[1:06:19] thought of you
[1:06:21] [Music]

[1:06:33] daughter of God now stand up and act

[1:06:45] addressing the Queen of Heaven that's
[1:06:47] going to set at the Throne of heaven and
[1:06:49] stand in the Judgment seat no devil I'm
[1:06:52] not going to be judged I will will be in
[1:06:54] the Judgment seat glory to God I said no
[1:06:59] devil I'm not standing in the Judgment
[1:07:01] but I'll be standing there
[1:07:04] judging why because I'm an eternal
[1:07:06] thought yes sir from the mind sir thank
[1:07:10] you
[1:07:11] Lord all right thank you Lord Jesus
[1:07:15] wonderful oh thank you Jesus
[1:07:18] hallelujah oh glory to
[1:07:21] God that's good Jeremiah 29:11 says for
[1:07:26] I know the thoughts that I think sir
[1:07:28] toward you sayith the Lord th a beace of
[1:07:31] not of evil to give you an expected
[1:07:35] somebody say expected
[1:07:37] expected now that wasn't worth a
[1:07:40] hoop somebody say
[1:07:43] expected
[1:07:44] end that's better see I'm an audience
[1:07:47] participation preacher come on preach I
[1:07:50] kind of require it brother
[1:07:52] Joel amen
[1:07:56] yes sir for I know the thoughts that I
[1:07:59] think toward you sayith the Lord
[1:08:01] thoughts of peace and not of evil to
[1:08:03] give you an expected end if he can add
[1:08:06] to his knowledge and he is not
[1:08:07] omniscient but he's the best he could
[1:08:09] say is that sometime he will be but that
[1:08:13] is not that's not spiritual he is
[1:08:15] omniscient he has never had a new
[1:08:17] thought about anything because all his
[1:08:20] thought he has always he he has always
[1:08:22] had and always will have and God knows
[1:08:25] the end from the beginning because he is
[1:08:27] God thus thus the thoughts of God are
[1:08:30] Eternal and they are real they are not
[1:08:34] simply like a man with a blueprint he
[1:08:36] has drawn up and which one day will be
[1:08:39] translated into substance and form but
[1:08:41] they are already real an eternal part of
[1:08:45] God yes they are already a real and an
[1:08:48] eternal part of
[1:08:50] God oh thank you Lord wonderful
[1:08:55] see how this works God always had his
[1:08:57] thoughts for Adam Adam and his thoughts
[1:09:00] were yet expressed Psalms 13915 and 16
[1:09:04] will give you a little idea of this my
[1:09:06] substance was not hid from thee when I
[1:09:08] was made in secret and curiously rough
[1:09:10] in the lowest parts of the earth Thine
[1:09:13] Eyes did see my substance yet being
[1:09:16] unperfect and in thy book were all my
[1:09:19] members written glory to God and in that
[1:09:23] book were all all my members all my
[1:09:25] members written which is which in
[1:09:28] continuance were fashion when as yet
[1:09:31] there was none of them oh thank you Lord
[1:09:35] that as I said was not written about
[1:09:37] Adam but it gives you the idea and the
[1:09:40] knowledge that the thought was there in
[1:09:42] his mind and that thought was eternal
[1:09:45] and it had to be
[1:09:47] expressed oh yeah all right yes
[1:09:50] sir it had to be expressed yeah
[1:09:55] you are an
[1:09:57] expression Brother David that's right of
[1:10:01] Christ yes oh thank you

[1:10:37] yeah by the fire yes sir and we realized
[1:10:41] that as that refiner would begin to take
[1:10:43] that

[1:10:47] fire and he would grab a hold of that
[1:10:48] chunk of gold brother Ben and he would
[1:10:50] begin to beat that gold yes sir you say

[1:13:23] that gold would take that man that
[1:13:25] refiner would grab a chunk of that gold
[1:13:27] and he would pull it out and he would
[1:13:28] begin to beat that
[1:13:30] gold that's right but St what would
[1:13:33] happen as he would beat that gold more
[1:13:35] of this would come out and more of that
[1:13:37] would come out yeah come on Amen and and
[1:13:40] and he would hit it again and something
[1:13:42] else would come out that complacent
[1:13:45] devil that just set you on a
[1:13:48] Pew come on it says you're going to make

[1:14:07] now you know what I like about the word
[1:14:09] that comes right to your house you know
[1:14:12] the word was passing by underneath a
[1:14:13] sycamore tree one day and there was a
[1:14:16] little man by the name of zachus that
[1:14:17] was up in that sycamore tree and he
[1:14:19] thought he had himself all hid you come
[1:14:22] in and you think you got yourself hid

[1:14:38] there was zakus he thought he was this
[1:14:39] he thought it was that amen but but he
[1:14:42] he thought he was hid up there he was
[1:14:44] hid in his message
[1:14:46] theology yeah oh my come on is that
[1:14:50] okay amen but when the word come by
[1:14:54] the word stopped right under his tree
[1:14:56] yeah yes sir the word stopped right at
[1:14:59] his Pew yeah yes it did and it looked
[1:15:03] right at him on and said
[1:15:06] zachus I'm coming to your house today
[1:15:09] yes sir I wonder how many in the
[1:15:12] building and say God come to my house

[1:15:19] know sometimes it gets pretty real when
[1:15:21] he comes to your house yeah all right
[1:15:23] yeah come on good come on sir that's why
[1:15:27] we don't invite him often come on now my
[1:15:31] prach come
[1:15:34] on huh why because the word is a
[1:15:38] discerner sir of the thought and the
[1:15:41] intent of the
[1:15:43] heart sir I'm leaving that alone come
[1:15:48] on I know my
[1:15:51] boundaries come on
[1:15:55] amen but that refiner would take that
[1:15:57] gold and he would begin to beat on
[1:16:00] it my and as he would beat this would
[1:16:03] come out and that would come out but all
[1:16:04] he was trying to do was see his own
[1:16:07] image within that piece of gold that
[1:16:10] whole time he he beats and he refines
[1:16:12] and he and he works that gold what's he
[1:16:14] doing he's looking for an image one
[1:16:17] liken to his own he's looking for
[1:16:20] something as he looks in there and he
[1:16:22] begins to realize amen that that that
[1:16:24] that as he as as that image becomes
[1:16:26] clear he's no longer looking at the Gold
[1:16:29] but he's looking at himself all right
[1:16:31] amen and when you become amen think it
[1:16:34] not strange the fiery trial that come to
[1:16:37] test you and to try you what he doing
[1:16:39] he's producing a
[1:16:43] bride yes
[1:16:44] sir that's good oh yes that okay yeah
[1:16:50] good he
[1:16:52] says
[1:16:57] Adam he
[1:16:59] says then Adam becomes God's
[1:17:03] thoughts
[1:17:05] expressed and those Eternal thoughts
[1:17:07] were now made
[1:17:09] manifest down through the centuries we
[1:17:12] could go we find a Moses a Jeremiah a
[1:17:16] John the Baptist and each one of these
[1:17:18] were God's Eternal thoughts expressed in
[1:17:21] its season yes sir then we come to Jesus
[1:17:24] the logos he was the perfect and
[1:17:27] complete thought expressed and he became
[1:17:30] known as the word that is what he is and
[1:17:35] forever will be now it says he had
[1:17:38] chosen Us in him
[1:17:41] Jesus Oh Thank You Lord wonderful right

[1:17:48] means that you've

[1:19:19] was cold I was tired come on and it
[1:19:23] would have been a lot
[1:19:25] easier for
[1:19:26] me to lay in
[1:19:29] bed and the church
[1:19:32] said
[1:19:35] amen but something inside of you come on

[1:19:56] you come on PR it's just the truth
[1:19:59] because you didn't want to be
[1:20:00] here but something inside of you desired
[1:20:04] the things of God so
[1:20:07] bad my until it overcame this outer
[1:20:11] man and it pulled him under subjection
[1:20:13] to the
[1:20:16] word glory to God it pulled him under
[1:20:20] subjection to that word and said come on
[1:20:22] you're going to church yes sir on you

[1:20:26] want to give up I'm never going to

[1:20:31] never doing that but there's something
[1:20:32] inside of you that will allow you to
[1:20:35] stop there's something inside of you
[1:20:37] that keeps you pressing every
[1:20:40] day you say I'm not going to church no
[1:20:42] more I'm not going to I'm not going to
[1:20:44] read the message I'm not going to do
[1:20:45] this I'm not going to do that but
[1:20:47] Jeremiah said it was like a fire shut up
[1:20:49] in my bones he said I'm not going to
[1:20:52] prophesy the name of the Lord no more
[1:20:54] but it was like a fire shut up in my
[1:20:56] bones and I couldn't help but begin to
[1:21:00] speak oh come on I'm not going to go do
[1:21:02] this I'm not going to live right no more
[1:21:04] but it's like a fire shut up in your
[1:21:06] bones and it causes you to come under
[1:21:09] subjection to the word oh thank you Lord
[1:21:12] what is it oh come on God's expressed
[1:21:16] thought yes sir being
[1:21:19] manifested yeah in you come on
[1:21:24] oh thank you Jesus yeah it's
[1:21:27] good wonderful amen good preaching
[1:21:33] yes oh
[1:21:36] yes now I read a
[1:21:39] lot and the reason I read a
[1:21:41] lot is because my words will
[1:21:45] fail that's right come on yes sir but
[1:21:49] his words will never fail
[1:21:51] right amen I'd rather tell you what he
[1:21:55] said yeah all
[1:21:58] right amen that's what he didn't say
[1:22:02] yeah come on
[1:22:06] prach he has chosen Us in him Jesus
[1:22:09] before the foundation of the world that
[1:22:11] means that we were right with him in the
[1:22:14] mind and the thoughts of God before the
[1:22:16] foundation of the world that gives an
[1:22:18] eternal quality to the
[1:22:21] elect I'm going to read that
[1:22:23] again he said that gives an eternal
[1:22:27] quality that's good to the elect sir
[1:22:30] yeah yes sir I'm telling you do we know
[1:22:35] who we are oh help us Lord I'm on good
[1:22:39] come on now you know who you are on now
[1:22:41] oh come on I preached this long and I
[1:22:44] preached it hard at
[1:22:46] home and I've been on it I've been on it
[1:22:48] for a while why because I believe if you
[1:22:51] watch the prophet's Ministry right
[1:22:53] toward the ending of his ministry he
[1:22:55] started pointing toward a bride yeah
[1:22:57] that's right come on somebody you say
[1:22:59] well he pointed toward Christ and yes he
[1:23:01] did but when he pointed to a bride he
[1:23:02] was pointing toward Christ yes sir come
[1:23:05] on somebody and he be to if you watch
[1:23:08] the ending of The Prophet's Ministry he
[1:23:10] took and he he took a a magnifying glass
[1:23:12] as it were and he began to say this is
[1:23:15] you that I'm talking about he be to say
[1:23:18] this is you this is the
[1:23:20] one that God was trying to get to
[1:23:24] yes you watch the ending of that
[1:23:26] prophet's Ministry brother and it what
[1:23:28] was it it was an emphasis on Christ in
[1:23:31] you all right why because they had
[1:23:33] already tried to make him God yeah come
[1:23:35] on they had already tried to make him
[1:23:37] God they had already said that he was
[1:23:39] God they'd baptize in his name they'd do
[1:23:41] this in his name but he would say I'm
[1:23:43] not
[1:23:44] God he wouldn't receive Worship in any
[1:23:47] Angel you realize when that angel came
[1:23:48] to John John got down the bow before him
[1:23:51] and he said get up John
[1:23:53] yeah why cuz he wouldn't receive worship
[1:23:56] right that's
[1:23:59] right is that what it said that's
[1:24:02] right amen and and they and they they
[1:24:05] get so hung up now look I believe amen
[1:24:08] that in a prophet and I believe in that
[1:24:10] message but there's much more to it than
[1:24:12] God sent a
[1:24:13] prophet there's a fulfillment of the
[1:24:16] scripture and the prophecy yes yes sir
[1:24:19] yes and the the best that I can tell he
[1:24:22] said that the bride would
[1:24:24] have thus sayeth the
[1:24:28] Lord that's what he said
[1:24:31] yeah come on so where I ask you does the
[1:24:34] word of the Lord lay yeah yeah come on
[1:24:38] I'm not preaching to you anything that's
[1:24:40] foreign I'm just reminding you yes sir
[1:24:42] you've heard these things you know these
[1:24:44] things amen but sometimes it does good
[1:24:46] to come around and
[1:24:50] focus that's good
[1:24:54] if I was preaching to you something new
[1:24:56] then you ought to be scared yeah yeah
[1:24:58] come on yeah
[1:25:01] true huh good
[1:25:04] preach he
[1:25:06] said that gives an eternal quality to
[1:25:08] the elect you can't get away from that
[1:25:11] let me inject a little thought here even
[1:25:13] our natural birth is based on Election
[1:25:15] the female ovaries producing many eggs
[1:25:19] but why is it that a at a certain time a
[1:25:22] certain egg come down and not another
[1:25:24] one and then amongst the male sperm so
[1:25:26] for for for no for no known reason a
[1:25:29] certain germ attaches itself to an egg
[1:25:31] While others could have have just as
[1:25:33] easily attached them themselves or had a
[1:25:35] better opportunity to do it so to do so
[1:25:38] did not do so and perish there is there
[1:25:42] is an intelligence behind all of this
[1:25:45] otherwise what determines whether the
[1:25:47] baby is boy or girl blonde or Bernette
[1:25:49] light or dark type eyes Etc with these
[1:25:52] thoughts in mind think about Joshua and
[1:25:54] Caleb did not Jesus say in in in John
[1:25:57] chapter 6:49 your fathers did eat mana
[1:25:59] and the Wilderness are dead those
[1:26:01] parents that did E that died were NE
[1:26:04] necessary for the forefathers of the
[1:26:06] people to whom Jesus was speaking they
[1:26:09] perished yet were in the election of God
[1:26:11] naturally and Joshua and Caleb were
[1:26:14] spiritually Joshua and Caleb were
[1:26:16] spiritually in the election of God you
[1:26:19] realize that out of two million strong
[1:26:21] only two when he
[1:26:23] yeah yeah that's right yeah come on good
[1:26:26] they came out of Egypt two million
[1:26:27] strong amen and only two went in all
[1:26:31] right come on yeah it's
[1:26:35] good come on only two receive the word
[1:26:40] right yeah that's right do you realize
[1:26:42] how
[1:26:44] small the elected group of God is going
[1:26:46] to
[1:26:47] be hello that's true on Amen but the
[1:26:51] only two went in all the rest of them
[1:26:53] have died
[1:26:54] off amen but two went on to possess the
[1:26:57] promise yeah but the problem is is so
[1:27:00] many times we'll stop short of the
[1:27:01] promise yes yes come on is that okay
[1:27:05] we'll stop
[1:27:07] short of the promise brother Allan what
[1:27:10] do you have me
[1:27:12] of yeah don't stop short of the
[1:27:16] promise come on preach it's good you
[1:27:20] want deliverance from that that devil of
[1:27:22] depression don't stop short of it yeah
[1:27:25] come on don't come in and let the devil
[1:27:27] tell you that it's not for you it's for
[1:27:28] this one or it's for that one or it's
[1:27:29] for this one or but not for you no you
[1:27:32] you don't stop short of it because
[1:27:33] you're an expression of Christ come
[1:27:37] on and by very by commission you were
[1:27:40] commissioned to cast out Devils yeah
[1:27:43] that's right hello come on you were
[1:27:46] commissioned brother B to cast out
[1:27:49] Devils all right we've gotten so afraid
[1:27:53] yeah oh come on of the power of God in
[1:27:55] our churches yeah prach now come
[1:27:59] on you know what I like to
[1:28:02] see well there's a few things come
[1:28:07] on I like to see a genuine move of
[1:28:11] Goden oh yeah now I am not Pentecostal I
[1:28:14] don't
[1:28:16] believe I don't believe that we come in
[1:28:18] here and we and we we we run the aisles
[1:28:20] and we shout and we do all of these
[1:28:22] things though there's a place for that
[1:28:25] come on I mean I'm not talking about an
[1:28:26] outward emotion but I'm talking about
[1:28:28] the word coming so alive in our
[1:28:30] hearts until finally we become that word
[1:28:34] come on somebody there's going to be an
[1:28:36] expression of Christ you say brother
[1:28:38] being what about all of these things
[1:28:39] that all of the emotion and those things
[1:28:41] are fine I don't I'm not against those
[1:28:43] things but you better know what you're
[1:28:45] shouting
[1:28:47] about that's right I've seen I've seen
[1:28:50] the real and I've seen the fanaticism
[1:28:53] I've seen both that's
[1:28:55] right come
[1:28:57] on and I'll tell you what you can have a
[1:28:59] you can have a shou and service and it
[1:29:01] be nothing more than an emotional
[1:29:03] workup come on that's true come on that
[1:29:07] ain't popular is it come on prach Amen
[1:29:10] and that is nothing that's a sickness
[1:29:13] yes sir you sat there and you're grieved
[1:29:15] and you're Spirit why because because
[1:29:17] you see all of this but then there is
[1:29:19] real among that yes there's somebody
[1:29:22] that's laboring it out at the altar and
[1:29:24] maybe they're crying maybe they're
[1:29:26] weeping but they're weeping their way to
[1:29:29] Christ

[1:30:18] Holy Ghost since you
[1:30:20] believed that's right come on yes sir we

[1:31:40] Eternal thoughts of God which were the
[1:31:42] to were to be expressed in flesh in
[1:31:44] their du seas and but these same elect
[1:31:47] are called by another name oh my these
[1:31:51] same elect are called by another name
[1:31:54] Romans 4:16 says therefore it is of
[1:31:58] faith that it might be by grace to the
[1:32:00] end the promise might be sure to all the
[1:32:03] seed not to not to that only which is of
[1:32:06] the law but to that which is also the
[1:32:09] faith of Abraham who is the father of us
[1:32:12] all Romans 97-113 neither because they
[1:32:15] are the Seed of Abraham are they all
[1:32:17] children but in Isaac they shall be thy
[1:32:20] sh seed shall be called that is what
[1:32:23] they which are the children of Flesh
[1:32:25] they are not the children of God but the
[1:32:27] children of the promise are counted for
[1:32:29] the seed Oh Glory to God for this is the

[1:33:37] at the beginning and the other was not
[1:33:40] right one was an expression of Christ
[1:33:42] and the other was not right that's right
[1:33:46] so he would stand there by forn
[1:33:47] knowledge and he would say Jacob have I
[1:33:48] loved es now neither
[1:33:50] boy had done
[1:33:53] anything that's right neither boy had

[1:34:04] done anything wrong Jacob hadn't done
[1:34:06] nothing good yeah and really if you look
[1:34:08] at it amen Esau was a better man than
[1:34:11] Jacob yeah all right he was come on he
[1:34:13] simply was Esau would you would come and

[1:34:24] than a liance or
[1:34:25] Planner yeah that's right Jacob was a
[1:34:28] deceiver so you would look at him Joel

[1:35:54] would stand there and and and Jacob
[1:35:57] looked like he was a hopeless cause he
[1:35:59] would lie he would walk down a path that
[1:36:02] it would look so awful it would look
[1:36:04] like there was no hope for him but yet
[1:36:07] through the eternities of God he was a
[1:36:09] chosen vessel oh yes thank you Lord he
[1:36:13] had a name change
[1:36:15] coming had a change of name coming
[1:36:20] Glory this out here is deceiving yeah
[1:36:24] what you see is deceiving what I look at
[1:36:27] deceiving but let me tell you something
[1:36:30] like I said a moment ago I had Esau as
[1:36:32] the man but Jacob was the one that was
[1:36:34] with God in the beginning yeah from God

[1:37:17] a deceiver Esau would no doubt be the
[1:37:19] better man yeah amen but it did not
[1:37:22] change the fact that Esau was not in the
[1:37:24] election of
[1:37:25] God he was not a part of him amen but
[1:37:29] because of Jacob I'm going to say this
[1:37:30] and I hope you take it right but because
[1:37:33] Jacob was in the election of God Jacob
[1:37:36] could
[1:37:38] not oh come on Jacob could not miss
[1:37:43] eternity

[1:39:33] about staying on my notes
[1:39:35] today
[1:39:39] bless
[1:39:41] amen Galatians 3 chapter 16 says now to
[1:39:46] Abraham and his seed were the promises
[1:39:48] made he saith not
[1:39:51] and to see he he saith not and and to
[1:39:54] seeds as of many he saith not and to
[1:39:59] seeds as of many but as one as of one
[1:40:02] and thy seed which is Christ Galatians 3
[1:40:06] and 29 says and if ye be Christ then ye
[1:40:09] are Abraham's seed and HS according to
[1:40:12] the promise and if ye be
[1:40:16] Christ oh yeah then ye are Abraham's
[1:40:19] seed and HS of according to the promise
[1:40:24] oh thank you according to Romans 4 16 we
[1:40:28] find that that God has given a sure
[1:40:30] promise to all someone say all of
[1:40:34] Abraham's seed and Paul puts himself and
[1:40:37] all believers under the this uh this
[1:40:40] this designation because under that
[1:40:42] designation because he says Abraham who
[1:40:45] is the father of us all then he goes on
[1:40:49] not he goes on to not only narrow down
[1:40:51] his defin this definition he says but
[1:40:54] rather to finalize it for in Galatians 3
[1:40:57] he's identified the seed
[1:41:00] singular there'll be a Seed of Abraham
[1:41:04] with G he says with Jesus encounted the
[1:41:07] seed of CH the seed children as children
[1:41:10] of promise and promises and promise of
[1:41:13] as having as having to do with election
[1:41:17] or the choosing of God what are we
[1:41:19] talking about a bride of his own
[1:41:21] choosing he says the choosing of God and
[1:41:24] that is exactly what we have been saying
[1:41:26] there he says these who are the of the
[1:41:28] royal seed are the elected of God are
[1:41:31] the predestinated forn of God and were
[1:41:34] in the mind of God in his thoughts in in
[1:41:39] very plain language the true bride of
[1:41:42] Christ was in the mind of God eternally
[1:41:45] though not expressed until each came
[1:41:48] forth in the designated decreed season
[1:41:51] as each member came forth it became
[1:41:54] expressed and took its place in the body
[1:41:57] thus the bride is the literal spoken
[1:42:01] word seed
[1:42:03] bride thank you Lord thus the Bride
[1:42:08] come thus the
[1:42:11] bride BR Ben than thus the bride is the
[1:42:15] literal spoken word seed
[1:42:19] bride Glory
[1:42:22] come on wonderful God have
[1:42:25] mercy oh thank you Lord It's
[1:42:29] good well yes sir it might not excite
[1:42:33] you one iota oh come
[1:42:36] on but let me tell you right now this
[1:42:39] Pulpit is getting wet let me tell you
[1:42:42] right
[1:42:44] now come on this is who you
[1:42:49] are
[1:42:51] good it's who you
[1:42:53] are this is your identity and when this
[1:42:57] Revelation sinks down I believe that
[1:43:00] you're one Revelation from a Rapture
[1:43:02] come on and I believe this is it I said
[1:43:05] I believe this is the Revelation that
[1:43:07] until we get this revelation of who we
[1:43:10] are until we realize brother Stewart who
[1:43:13] we are yeah oh come on yeah but once
[1:43:17] that be that word becomes a reality yeah
[1:43:21] yes all of a sudden we realize that that
[1:43:24] we're not an heir amen of of of our
[1:43:26] fleshly uh uh uh lineage yeah amen that
[1:43:30] man in the mirror amen it's not what you
[1:43:32] are that man in the mirror it was
[1:43:34] nothing more than a it it's it's dying
[1:43:38] it started dying from the time it took
[1:43:40] breath out of its mother's womb yeah but
[1:43:43] that man behind the man in the
[1:43:48] mirror oh come on it never began and
[1:43:50] it'll never end
[1:43:55] yes oh thank
[1:43:58] you
[1:43:59] amen it is the literal spoken word seed
[1:44:04] bride sir yes and though she is feminine
[1:44:07] in designation she is also called the
[1:44:10] body of Christ it is a very it is very
[1:44:13] apparent that the sought to be that that
[1:44:16] that she s she ought to be called that
[1:44:19] for called that for she was
[1:44:22] predestinated in him yeah and came from
[1:44:25] the saint listen to this she was
[1:44:28] predestinated in him and came from the
[1:44:32] same
[1:44:36] Source I know this ain't I know I know
[1:44:39] that some of this stuff don't make you
[1:44:40] just run the aisles but I ain't here to
[1:44:42] make you run the aisles I'm here to lay
[1:44:43] the word
[1:44:45] in
[1:44:47] good it's good hey man I I believe that
[1:44:50] there comes a time that you go come on
[1:44:53] somebody I I believe that there there's
[1:44:55] a time when it's time to all of those
[1:44:57] services are good when you can preach
[1:44:59] the word and and it just it it brings
[1:45:01] them people up like that but there comes
[1:45:03] a time whenever you've got to take and
[1:45:05] you've got to get into the meat of the
[1:45:06] word and you've got to start preaching
[1:45:08] the meat of the word why because now
[1:45:10] you're standing as a mature and elected
[1:45:12] bride you're not a baby come on somebody
[1:45:15] you're not a baby down here that had to
[1:45:17] be bottle fed and milk fed but now you
[1:45:19] can be sustained Eagle
[1:45:21] food you can be sustained on something
[1:45:24] amen when you were born amen you were
[1:45:26] fed by by milk yeah right that's okay
[1:45:30] you were fed by milk that that your
[1:45:32] mother would feed you with milk but as
[1:45:34] you matured as you grew you be needed
[1:45:36] something a little bit more sustainable
[1:45:38] something that would sustain you a
[1:45:40] little
[1:45:41] better hey look I believe in all of it
[1:45:45] you got some that just want to preach
[1:45:47] you a state that's thick and never want
[1:45:48] to give you any trimming
[1:45:52] come on
[1:45:56] right and then you got some that just
[1:45:58] wants to give you a b of mash ters
[1:46:02] yeah now I like
[1:46:04] ters told the church last weekend I said
[1:46:06] I like ters brother B I'll tell you what
[1:46:08] if you don't believe I if you don't know
[1:46:10] I think I like taters ask my kids
[1:46:13] because they ask what's for dinner and
[1:46:14] we'll tell them what's for dinner with
[1:46:19] potatoes ters with a side of
[1:46:22] ters man so I believe in all of those
[1:46:24] things I like those things when you let
[1:46:26] sit down brother Allen to a meal amen
[1:46:28] you don't want one
[1:46:30] thing amen but a minister ought to be
[1:46:32] able to minister to the needs of each
[1:46:34] person in the building we're called to
[1:46:37] minister to the children he said feed my
[1:46:41] sheep man so you begin to realize
[1:46:44] brother Joel amen that that it's not
[1:46:45] about the steak that's this thick
[1:46:48] yeah amen but it's about all of it
[1:46:51] together feeding and bringing up her
[1:46:54] bride into maturity of who she
[1:47:00] is that okay that's
[1:47:07] good
[1:47:12] amen I lost my
[1:47:16] spot the children of the promise and
[1:47:18] having to do with the election of of the
[1:47:20] choosing of God and that is exactly what
[1:47:22] we've been saying seems like I read
[1:47:27] that very plain language God in in the
[1:47:30] mind yeah I'm read that I'm sorry you
[1:47:33] know these tablets they're great but if
[1:47:35] you just take your hand and you graze
[1:47:37] across
[1:47:38] them it
[1:47:42] goes and you're sitting there going what
[1:47:44] do I
[1:47:47] do he says th the bride is literally
[1:47:51] spoken word seed bride and though she is
[1:47:53] feminine in designation I read that too
[1:47:55] but I'm going to read it again the body
[1:47:57] she is called the body of Christ it is
[1:47:59] very apparent that she ought to be
[1:48:01] called that for she was predestinated in
[1:48:03] him and came from the same source and
[1:48:06] was eternal with him and now manifesting
[1:48:09] God in in a many membered bride in a
[1:48:12] many membered body excuse me whereas
[1:48:15] once God was feminine was manifest in
[1:48:18] one member even our lord Jesus Christ
[1:48:21] now there now now then here we are
[1:48:24] coming to the conclusion as the Eternal
[1:48:26] logos God was manifested the son and in
[1:48:29] Jesus dwelt all the fullness of the
[1:48:31] godhead bodily and the Eternal one was
[1:48:33] the father manifested in the flesh and
[1:48:35] there thereby gained the title of son
[1:48:38] even so we Eternal even so we Eternal in
[1:48:42] his thought in in our turn in in our
[1:48:46] turn became the many membered spoken
[1:48:48] word seed manif ested in flesh and those
[1:48:52] Eternal thoughts now manifested in flesh
[1:48:55] are the sons of God even as many as we
[1:48:58] are socalled we did not seed we did not
[1:49:01] become seed by the rebirth we were seed
[1:49:05] and therefore were reborn for only the
[1:49:08] elect can be reborn because we were seed
[1:49:12] in the re is the reason we could be
[1:49:14] quickened is non in non seed there is
[1:49:17] nothing to be quickened he said we were
[1:49:19] re born we were quickened because why we
[1:49:22] were seen there was something there to
[1:49:25] Quicken us to regenerate us to reor bir
[1:49:27] us but if there is nothing in there to
[1:49:31] receive life then there is nothing to
[1:49:34] come to life when the s o in hits it
[1:49:37] that's why when you came into contact
[1:49:38] with this message amen something all of
[1:49:40] a sudden begin to come in and spring up
[1:49:43] why because you realize that there was
[1:49:45] something in there and it was a part of
[1:49:47] you it begin to speak to the same
[1:49:50] language that you were speaking it be
[1:49:53] glory to God it be to talk the talk that
[1:49:56] you were talking and something inside of
[1:49:58] you came to life and you realize that
[1:50:00] this is
[1:50:02] that this is that come
[1:50:05] on wonder come on now yeah that's
[1:50:10] good Peter would stand there on the day
[1:50:13] of Pentecost and he would come
[1:50:15] out
[1:50:17] right David and he' come out and he
[1:50:19] would would run out there and they would
[1:50:21] be they they was having a meeting
[1:50:23] brother Ben yeah they they were rolling
[1:50:26] out of the
[1:50:27] windows that's right they were rolling
[1:50:30] out of the
[1:50:31] doors they come out in there and and and
[1:50:34] Peter got up on that on on his his
[1:50:36] little soap
[1:50:37] box and he begin to preach yeah and he
[1:50:42] said oh my this is that all of a sudden
[1:50:46] Peter would stand there and he would
[1:50:48] begin maybe as Peter was a little little
[1:50:50] boy sitting on his mother's knee his
[1:50:52] mother would begin to talk to him and
[1:50:54] she would read him the stories the
[1:50:55] Scrolls and and Joel would be she would
[1:50:58] begin to read the scroll and she would
[1:51:00] begin to read that how that Joel would
[1:51:02] say I'll pour out my spirit upon All
[1:51:04] Flesh and all of a sudden Peter amen as
[1:51:07] a little boy he would sit there and he
[1:51:09] would remember what his mother had
[1:51:10] taught
[1:51:11] him and all of a sudden when he was
[1:51:13] sitting there in the upper room he
[1:51:15] wasn't scared of what he would
[1:51:18] received he wasn't scared brother joela
[1:51:20] what he would received but all of a
[1:51:22] sudden the word was quick to his heart
[1:51:25] and he realized that this is what the
[1:51:27] prophet of the Prophet had had had had
[1:51:30] begin to express and he says this is
[1:51:33] that all of a sudden the reality came to
[1:51:36] Peter and he realized all of a sudden
[1:51:38] I'm the Fulfillment of his
[1:51:41] prophecy glory to God all of a sudden he
[1:51:44] realized I was the one that he was
[1:51:46] talking about all them eons of years ago
[1:51:49] the one that Joel begin to speak up I'm
[1:51:52] the one I'm the Fulfillment of the
[1:51:55] prophecy come on glory to God he'd stand
[1:51:59] there and all of a sudden he'd stand up
[1:52:01] and he'd say these aren't drunk on new
[1:52:02] wine but this is that yes
[1:52:09] sir I imagine he I would have took off
[1:52:13] running to realize that I was the one
[1:52:16] that the prophet was talking about yeah
[1:52:19] all right and I fulfilling

[1:52:36] right prophet of God said that 3,000
[1:52:39] would be be added to the we realized
[1:52:41] that 3,000 Souls were added to the
[1:52:43] kingdom and the prophet of God said that
[1:52:45] the devil never rolled out of rolled
[1:52:46] about out of his bed or something to
[1:52:48] that effect I don't have that for B but
[1:52:50] basically never never even moved he said
[1:52:53] the the devil didn't mind that he said
[1:52:55] they don't mind you doing a little
[1:52:57] shouting yeah that's right he don't mind
[1:52:59] all of those he said he never moved when
[1:53:01] those 3,000 Souls were out of the
[1:53:02] Kingdom he said but when Peter and John
[1:53:04] went down to the gate called
[1:53:05] Beautiful come on
[1:53:08] right and they walked up there being and
[1:53:10] there was that man there sitting there
[1:53:12] and they be and that man no doubt had
[1:53:14] had many men come by and give him this
[1:53:16] and give him that and give him this and
[1:53:18] give him that but there was only one man
[1:53:20] that could give him what he had need of
[1:53:22] all right amen and they just happen to
[1:53:24] be a carrier of that
[1:53:26] [Music]
[1:53:27] yeah amen but he said he said he never
[1:53:30] battered an eye when those 3,000 Souls
[1:53:32] were out of the Kingdom he said but when
[1:53:33] Peter and John come down the gate called
[1:53:34] beautiful and said Silver and Gold Have
[1:53:36] I None but such as I have I give unto
[1:53:40] you he said all hell begin to take no
[1:53:42] said notice why because there was
[1:53:44] somebody producing the
[1:53:47] word there was somebody producing the
[1:53:50] word and they would stand there and all
[1:53:51] hell begin to realize hey we got a real
[1:53:53] problem on our hands yeah come on we had
[1:53:56] it in one but now it's in many sir sir
[1:54:01] he broke a part of him down a part of
[1:54:04] him off amen and he began to condence in
[1:54:06] in the spirit in the in the form of the
[1:54:08] Holy Ghost and you got some and you got
[1:54:10] some and you got some man what is it
[1:54:12] it's a many membered Bri
[1:54:15] body right he said whenever Peter and
[1:54:18] John would walk up there and they would
[1:54:19] say Silver and Gold Have I None rise up
[1:54:21] to your feet and walk he said all hell
[1:54:22] begin to take notice why yeah because no
[1:54:26] longer was somebody just talking about
[1:54:28] it yes that's
[1:54:30] right it's good but somebody had yielded
[1:54:34] themselves enough to
[1:54:37] it to become
[1:54:39] it
[1:54:41] that's it's good we're so scared yeah
[1:54:46] come on now understand this isn't
[1:54:49] something that you can just obtain to
[1:54:51] this isn't something that you just you
[1:54:52] work up and you do this and you do that
[1:54:54] no you cannot do that you're a sheep
[1:54:57] doesn't walk out in the field and say I
[1:54:59] must bear wool yeah but a sheep just
[1:55:02] naturally Bears wool but let me tell you
[1:55:04] something if life Bears on the inside of
[1:55:06] you of Christ it will produce Christ yes
[1:55:10] you come out here and you plant an apple
[1:55:12] tree an apple seed in the ground and
[1:55:14] that seed is going to produce an
[1:55:16] apple and let me tell you something that
[1:55:18] seed will never produce any more apples
[1:55:20] than what was already in that seed right
[1:55:22] that's
[1:55:23] right every Apple that it ever produced
[1:55:26] it will be in that
[1:55:27] seed is that not true that's
[1:55:32] right amen but but what is it see the
[1:55:34] life of the vine is an Apple so it's
[1:55:36] going to produce an apple amen and
[1:55:38] that's why whenever you look at people
[1:55:40] and they begin to Proclaim one thing
[1:55:42] amen but their lives are proclaiming
[1:55:44] another thing yeah that's right you say
[1:55:48] brother Ben now that's judgmental no
[1:55:49] that's inspecting
[1:55:55] fruit yeah that's
[1:55:58] good I I don't walk out
[1:56:04] here if there's an apple tree out
[1:56:07] here I'm not going to walk out here and
[1:56:09] judge whether it's apples I'm just going
[1:56:11] to inspect
[1:56:12] it yeah that's
[1:56:16] right yeah that's true and if it's got
[1:56:19] the life of an apple it's going to
[1:56:21] produce this little red
[1:56:25] thing that's sweet and not
[1:56:28] better come
[1:56:31] on there's such a thing as a sour apple
[1:56:35] too bless God I ain't going to get on
[1:56:39] the sour apples today because I don't
[1:56:41] like
[1:56:44] them
[1:56:48] amen but you walk out there and what is
[1:56:50] it because there's life being produced
[1:56:53] and man you can look at it and you can
[1:56:55] see just exactly what it is yeah that's
[1:56:58] right
[1:57:02] yeah good we leave that alone I'll tell
[1:57:06] you what you guys have got so many
[1:57:07] gadgets up here I'm knocking water off
[1:57:09] I'm knocking microphones
[1:57:12] off brother being thinking man get him
[1:57:15] out of there before he tears my Pulpit
[1:57:18] down
[1:57:20] amen I'm
[1:57:26] quitting he
[1:57:28] says no for real I am quitting he says
[1:57:32] now
[1:57:33] then here we are coming to a conclusion
[1:57:36] prise the Lord going to slow it down
[1:57:38] just for a moment and I'm going to read
[1:57:40] this
[1:57:43] again he says now then here we are
[1:57:46] coming down to a conclusion yes sir as
[1:57:49] the Eternal logos God sir was manifest
[1:57:53] in the
[1:57:54] Sun and in Jesus dwelt all the fullness
[1:57:56] of the godhead bodily and that Eternal
[1:57:59] one was the father manifested in flesh
[1:58:03] yes sir and thereby gained the title of
[1:58:07] son even so we Eternal in his
[1:58:11] thoughts in our
[1:58:14] turn became the many membered spoken
[1:58:17] word seed all right
[1:58:20] manifested in
[1:58:21] flesh and those Eternal thoughts now
[1:58:24] manifested in flesh
[1:58:27] are the sons of God even as we are so
[1:58:31] calleded oh yeah we did not become seed
[1:58:34] by the
[1:58:36] reir we were seed and therefore were
[1:58:39] reborn for only the elect can be
[1:58:44] reborn because we were seed is the
[1:58:47] reason we could be quick
[1:58:50] in nonseed there is nothing to be
[1:58:55] quickened all right Wonder thank you
[1:58:57] Lord what am I saying I'm saying it is
[1:59:00] not by chance that you are here today
[1:59:03] right that's good but it is by the forn
[1:59:06] knowledge of God
[1:59:08] yes yes there has been such an attack on
[1:59:12] this message in the past few
[1:59:15] years
[1:59:17] yes and we knew that that would come
[1:59:20] yeah sure
[1:59:24] sure but what it is it is it is this it
[1:59:28] is it is God beginning to REM Jehovah
[1:59:31] Eagle beginning to remove the feathers
[1:59:33] from The
[1:59:34] Nest yeah come on we've got this one
[1:59:37] walking away and that one walking away
[1:59:39] and this one walking away I'm going to
[1:59:41] make a statement here
[1:59:43] amen and and I hope it it doesn't come
[1:59:46] across wrong amen but you're never going
[1:59:48] to walk away away from who you are come
[1:59:52] on so if you walk away it never
[1:59:55] was yeah come
[1:59:58] on there was never a seed there to be
[2:00:02] regenerated right come on
[2:00:04] preach come on is that right yeah there
[2:00:07] was never anything there that could be
[2:00:09] quickened to life amen so we realize
[2:00:12] that as they walk away what is it we're
[2:00:14] at the Harvest time now what is it at
[2:00:17] Harvest Time everything is producing
[2:00:19] after its own kind yeah you look at the
[2:00:22] world today and you begin to see how
[2:00:24] that everything is it is just a mess
[2:00:28] amen this is opening up and that's
[2:00:30] opening up this one's coming out and
[2:00:31] that one's coming out I'm being very
[2:00:33] vague this morning amen but you realize
[2:00:35] that all of hell has been tore off the
[2:00:37] lid has been tore off of hell but I'm so
[2:00:40] thankful that I that we have a prophet
[2:00:42] that told us that when all of Hell begin
[2:00:45] to come up all of Heaven begin to come
[2:00:48] down amen but there's somebody that'll
[2:00:50] stand there amen and they'll live this
[2:00:52] word and they're standing there and you
[2:00:54] look at this one for manifesting and
[2:00:56] that one's manifesting and this one's
[2:00:59] manifesting but at the same time that
[2:01:01] the devil's doing something God is doing
[2:01:04] something there is a bride on this side
[2:01:07] also that is coming to full maturity of
[2:01:10] who she is and she begin to stand up in
[2:01:13] the full maturity of what she was always
[2:01:15] called to be the devil's come on
[2:01:18] somebody the devil's manifesting who he
[2:01:21] is but now we're seeing a many membered
[2:01:23] bride body begin to produce Christ
[2:01:27] again what is it when the devil's doing
[2:01:30] something God's doing something oh
[2:01:34] yeah
[2:01:35] wonderful we to spend so much time
[2:01:38] looking at what the devil's doing and we
[2:01:39] miss what God's
[2:01:41] doing yeah H that's right we look and we
[2:01:44] see all that the devil's doing brother
[2:01:45] being and we we spend so much time doing
[2:01:47] that amen but we miss what God doing
[2:01:49] when all of Hell amen when the lid gets
[2:01:51] tore off of Hell amen all of Heaven
[2:01:53] comes down too amen what is it at the
[2:01:56] Harvest Time all seeds will produce
[2:01:58] after their own
[2:02:01] kind oh my that's right and this bride
