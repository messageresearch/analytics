[15:09] everywhere I went everywhere I've gone
[15:11] in the world brother Harold was there 20

[15:17] so thankful for that and and he did work
[15:20] behind the scenes that there will be a
[15:22] great reward for a love like that for
[15:25] this message and for spreading it around

[16:42] his time also he has set the world in
[16:46] their heart so that no man can find out
[16:49] the work that God maketh from the
[16:52] beginning to the end I pray the Lord
[16:54] would add his Blessing to the word you
[16:55] may be seated this morning
[17:01] when you came into this world you had
[17:03] almost nothing to do with it it would
[17:06] have been impossible for you to plan
[17:09] your
[17:10] entrance just as impossible as it is to
[17:12] plan your
[17:14] exit and the truth is that when you came
[17:18] into the world you uh you could not even
[17:22] think you didn't have the capacity to
[17:25] think and then one day you were born and
[17:28] you took that first breath and many of
[17:30] us were there with our children when
[17:32] they took that first breath of life and
[17:35] and they were waiting uh for that and
[17:38] and they come out of the womb and and
[17:40] they're there they're alive they take
[17:42] that breath they they can't think to
[17:44] take it it's not something that they
[17:46] plan it's not something that was uh
[17:49] could be thought out and and figured out
[17:52] but it just happened come on now it just
[17:54] happened and yet during that time you
[17:56] have to realize that you're f first
[17:59] breath was actually planned by God that
[18:03] he actually knew when your first breath
[18:05] would be and he knew what what family
[18:08] you would be born into many of us if we
[18:11] could choose what family we would be
[18:12] born into we would be born into riches
[18:15] we would be born into wealth we would be
[18:17] born into good looks right if we could
[18:20] choose that we would we would be born
[18:22] just how we wanted to be born but yet we
[18:24] had no choice in that we we were born
[18:27] some of us into different ult situation
[18:29] some into money some into poverty some
[18:32] into situations where we had mothers or
[18:34] fathers that loved us some into
[18:36] situation sadly where there was no
[18:38] mother or father present and maybe
[18:40] giving up for adoption or or worse yet
[18:42] having an uncaring parent that was there
[18:45] in in many situations but yet you're
[18:47] here this morning you're here in the
[18:50] house of the Lord and you love the
[18:52] message of the hour and you love the
[18:54] God's word and there's something about
[18:56] it though you the your path of life and
[18:58] your birth path brought you up a certain
[19:00] way but yet you can look back and say
[19:02] what would I be unless God had made me
[19:05] what I am so you could say like Paul did
[19:07] by the grace of God I am what I am I had
[19:10] no choice in taking my first breath but
[19:13] yet here I am today believing God's
[19:16] word so there were and you go through
[19:20] life and I want to speak to you today
[19:22] because there's a there's a spirit on
[19:24] the age of depression and there's a
[19:27] spirit of of suicidal thoughts and
[19:29] things that come on people's minds and
[19:33] and it causes you to actually get
[19:35] despair so much of your own life that
[19:38] you begin to think well you begin to
[19:40] plan your last breath and you say well
[19:42] Christians don't do that well brother
[19:44] brandom did and we find actually that
[19:47] Elijah did in the juniper tree
[19:49] experience he said it' been better if I
[19:51] hadn't been born we find that job did
[19:54] that as well when he come to a time
[19:56] where every he lost everything and
[19:58] everything was had gone out from under
[20:00] him and he lost his children and his
[20:02] family and everything else and we find
[20:03] that job cried out to God and he said oh
[20:05] I wish I'd never been born right amen I
[20:09] wonder if we were honest this morning
[20:10] how many of us would maybe have said the
[20:12] same thing at some point in our life
[20:15] right amen some of you have hurt so bad
[20:18] at some point that you wish you'd never
[20:20] been born that's right some of you have
[20:23] hurt emotionally that's right so bad
[20:27] yeah right that you wish you'd never
[20:29] been
[20:31] born but you didn't have control yeah
[20:35] over your first breath yeah and the one
[20:38] that did all right yeah chose you to be
[20:42] here sir right all right I hope you're
[20:45] hear me today yes sir we have this
[20:47] illusion of control over our lives right
[20:50] and especially as new Christians and and
[20:53] we have some new Christians and and some
[20:55] young people that are coming up we need
[20:57] to remember that we don't have control
[20:59] yeah he does we don't get to control our
[21:03] lives in every little a yes we want to
[21:05] plan we want to do right we want to live
[21:07] right but yet we've got to lay on the
[21:10] mercies of God to trust in the strength
[21:12] of the arms of Jehovah that we can look
[21:14] at him and say Lord I realized when I
[21:17] take my when I took my first steps I I
[21:20] that wasn't a planned event it was just
[21:22] somehow I had the strength and the
[21:24] ability to take my first steps and when
[21:26] I take my last steps that won't be a
[21:28] planned event but it'll be somehow
[21:30] orchestrated by you to take me off of
[21:33] the earth and so I'm when I'm walking in
[21:35] between as I'm stepping my way walking
[21:38] my way through life I can't plan every
[21:40] event some of you look ahead so far down
[21:42] the road and you worry about things that
[21:44] are coming tomorrow but Jesus said take
[21:47] no thought for tomorrow sufficient to
[21:49] the day is the evil thereof so you don't
[21:53] know what's coming tomorrow there might
[21:54] be death in the future there might be
[21:56] pain but there might also be Rapture
[21:59] yeah there might all heyen I believe
[22:01] there's Rapture in our future I believe
[22:03] there's a there's a body change in our
[22:05] future I believe that there's joy in
[22:07] your future there's there's Health in
[22:09] your future and yet at the same time it
[22:11] might not be but the one who
[22:13] knows the one who plans your birth knows
[22:16] what you're going through and why yes
[22:19] that's good brother amen David in the
[22:23] Bible went through some difficult times
[22:25] oh come on look at Psalms chap
[22:28] 22 and you'll find in this scripture
[22:30] that David God had to bring David into
[22:33] such a place in his life for the Joel
[22:35] that he he actually felt yeah so badly
[22:40] as to say the words that Jesus would say
[22:44] on the cross yes so in order to get
[22:47] David to cry out in Prophecy yeah God
[22:51] didn't put him in a good service yeah
[22:54] and anoint him and make him run the
[22:56] aisles right that's right yes sir in
[22:59] order to get David in the place where he
[23:02] needed him to be he let him go through
[23:05] and David did dance he did run the house
[23:07] but he had to get him in such a place
[23:09] where he felt like everybody was against
[23:11] him yes sir and he felt like he was
[23:12] being persecuted and he felt so low that
[23:16] he cries out my God my God why hast Thou
[23:20] forsaken me and not knowing that's
[23:22] exactly what needed to be said because
[23:25] it would be a prophecy of the son of
[23:27] David who would come on the cross and
[23:28] say the same thing yeah amen yeah
[23:32] there's a reason sometimes for what we
[23:34] go through that's right and so David in
[23:37] this great Psalm 22 if you go and read
[23:39] the whole thing maybe later you'll find
[23:42] that it's a great Psalm of of the death
[23:45] of Christ on the cross and a prophecy of
[23:48] that event and it says in verse 7 all
[23:51] they that see me laugh me to scorn they
[23:54] shoot out the lip they shake the head
[23:56] saying he trusted on the Lord that he
[24:00] would deliver him let him deliver him
[24:03] seeing he delighted in him but notice
[24:07] how David Comforts himself and this may
[24:10] be a simple thought this morning but I
[24:12] just want us to to ponder it to dwell on
[24:14] it for a moment as we're here in the
[24:16] house of the Lord he said Thou Art he
[24:20] that took me out of the womb yes had no
[24:24] control over
[24:25] that right there's nothing I could do to
[24:28] keep myself alive
[24:30] right I couldn't think yeah you
[24:33] understand when I'm talking about
[24:34] there's nothing I could do I couldn't
[24:35] prepare or plan or think I'm going to
[24:38] breathe right right my first breath I
[24:42] never thought I'm going to breathe yeah
[24:45] you realize living a Christian Life is
[24:47] much that same way yes right you're not
[24:49] sitting there saying well I'm going
[24:50] breathe I'm going to do right I'm going
[24:53] to walk I'm going to do right but it's
[24:55] it's a natural breath yes you walk in
[24:58] the spirit yes you walk with the Lord
[25:01] you go to church you you hang out around
[25:03] God's people you fellowship with God's
[25:06] people you work for God and you do the
[25:08] things that you you know to do but you
[25:10] can't you don't know but when that
[25:11] Breath of Life comes into your life all
[25:13] the sudden you just begin to do yes
[25:15] that's right right when my my kids were
[25:17] born when Peter was born he took a
[25:19] little bit of roughing up from the
[25:20] doctor but eventually he started to cry
[25:23] and when he started to cry he never
[25:26] quit
[25:28] it took a while for him to quit but what
[25:30] was it it was it was natural and when he
[25:33] had need of something oh hope we can he
[25:35] today see we're completely dependent on
[25:38] Jesus I don't care if you've been in the
[25:40] message for 40 years if you've been a
[25:42] Christian Hall of your life you are
[25:44] completely this morning dependent upon
[25:47] Christ yes sir and so when you're
[25:49] completely dependent on him what happens
[25:51] is that that you go through and you find
[25:54] yourself in a difficult situation what
[25:56] can you do about it well brother tells
[25:57] us there was found no better way than
[26:00] than to cry for it yeah you could he
[26:02] said you could ring a teach them to ring
[26:04] a bell you could teach him to speaking
[26:06] great words but God said when when a
[26:08] baby had a need that he would just cry
[26:10] for it yeah and that's what you and I he
[26:13] wants to us to learn to do is just cry
[26:15] when we have a need just ask for it
[26:18] yeah amen amen you took me out of the
[26:23] womb notice thou did make me hope
[26:28] I love this when I was upon my mother's
[26:31] breast in other words you gave me hope
[26:33] there was hope of a future yeah not by
[26:36] my own
[26:38] effort are you hearing me now not by my
[26:41] own effort but I had hope when I was a
[26:44] baby amen yes oh God if you could
[26:47] realize how good God had been through to
[26:49] you through your whole life we'd never
[26:50] have to tell you to raise your hands yes
[26:52] sir we never have to tell you to sing we
[26:54] never have to have to try to work people
[26:56] up to dance we never have to wor people
[26:58] up to worship God why because God was
[27:00] there when you were born he was there in
[27:03] the room when you were born and he was
[27:05] there when you took your first breath
[27:07] don't you believe he's there with you
[27:08] now if he was there with you before you
[27:10] ever made a move toward God before you
[27:13] ever said Lord I love you before you
[27:15] ever did anything for God he was already
[27:17] there if he was there for you then he'll
[27:19] be with you trust in that today Church
[27:22] yes sir trust in that don't get caught
[27:24] up well I can't do this I can't do that
[27:27] I can't live like they do I can't work
[27:29] like they do I can't preach like he does
[27:31] I can't sing like she does no you you
[27:33] stay focused on him he's with you this
[27:36] morning yes sir yes sir amen prise God

[27:44] when I was upon my mother's breast I was
[27:47] cast upon thee yes I love this I I was
[27:51] cast upon thee from the womb yes what
[27:55] does that mean I I couldn't keep myself
[27:57] myself alive yeah right I couldn't make
[28:00] myself who I am then you I'm going to
[28:02] figure it all out when I get it all
[28:03] figured out then I'm going to trust God
[28:06] nonsense you don't even know how you
[28:08] were born you don't even know how you're
[28:10] alive you don't know why you were
[28:12] driving down the road one day and a semi

[28:20] have been on that same road would not
[28:22] have made it you don't know how you
[28:24] would get Co end up in the hospital and
[28:26] everybody else ended up on a later
[28:27] brother David but you come out that same
[28:29] day and God begin to work in your life
[28:31] you don't understand why that happened
[28:33] the way it did but he said I was cast
[28:35] upon you from my mother's womb right yes
[28:39] you see our total dependence on God
[28:41] today I was cast upon you from my
[28:44] mother's womb Thou Art my God not from
[28:47] when I was
[28:49] baptized not from when I received the
[28:51] Holy come on are you with me this
[28:53] morning not from the moment that I that
[28:56] I said Lord I'm going I'm going to serve
[28:57] you I'm going to preach your gospel I'm
[28:59] going to live for you but from my
[29:01] mother's
[29:02] belly yes
[29:04] sir Hallelujah all right on
[29:08] Amen Hallelujah Psalm 71 verse 5 for
[29:13] thou art My Hope Oh Lord God yes look at
[29:17] the Hopeless day but JT that we live in
[29:19] today we've talked about it many times
[29:21] look how hopeless it looks but if he
[29:23] could take care of you when you were a
[29:25] helpless baby yes yeah
[29:28] how much more could he take care of you
[29:32] today and some some people you know as
[29:34] you get older you get more and more like
[29:36] that you become more and more helpless
[29:39] but if he would you were cast on him
[29:41] from your mother's womb yes why don't
[29:43] you cast your cares and burdens on him
[29:46] today your whole life is there you're
[29:49] there because he chose for you to be
[29:52] there you're in this service this
[29:53] morning because he chose you he said but
[29:55] I don't I don't understand the difficult
[29:57] difficulties of life but it's in those
[29:59] difficulties that's the moment you you
[30:01] reach up like David did and said I was
[30:03] born and when I was born you were
[30:06] there amen right you were there at my
[30:10] first breath psalm 71:5 for thou art My
[30:13] Hope Oh Lord God Thou Art my trust from
[30:17] my youth yes amen by thee have I been
[30:22] holding up from the
[30:25] womb he was propping me
[30:27] up in this world yes sir you don't
[30:31] realize when you were born it wasn't
[30:33] just the doctor that took hold of you or
[30:36] the Midwife it wasn't just the it wasn't
[30:38] just your mother that grabbed you and
[30:40] put you in her arms right but when you
[30:43] were born David said you took me yeah
[30:46] can you get a picture of that today when
[30:49] I was born David said you took me and
[30:52] you held me thou art he that took me out
[30:55] of my mother's bowels literally from my
[30:57] mother's
[30:58] heart amen my praise shall be
[31:03] continually yes of
[31:06] thee Oh my he said I am as a Wonder unto
[31:10] many they don't understand David was a
[31:14] Wonder because of how God blessed him
[31:16] and because of what he went through
[31:18] right huh yeah he wasn't just a Wonder
[31:21] because God blessed him but he was a
[31:22] Wonder because of what he'd been through
[31:24] but look at the testimony listen David
[31:27] was God's thinking that was what God
[31:29] wanted as we've been preaching at Saul
[31:31] about Saul on Wednesday night Saul was
[31:34] what the people wanted yeah but David
[31:36] was what God wanted and there was
[31:38] nothing that could keep him out of the
[31:40] throne room yes he didn't have to take
[31:42] it into his own hands when he could have
[31:44] killed Saul and taken the kingdom for
[31:47] himself he refused to do it why because
[31:49] he didn't have to manhandle the people
[31:52] he didn't have to take it in his own
[31:53] hands but he trusted God yes I'm a
[31:57] Wonder to many how many can say Amen to
[31:59] that today I'm a Wonder to many my
[32:02] family don't all understand it the
[32:04] people around me don't all understand it
[32:06] the preachers and the other folk in the
[32:08] denomination they don't understand it
[32:09] I'm a wonder why are you still in the
[32:11] message of the hour why do you still
[32:13] believe in Malachi 4 why do you still
[32:15] come on church are you with me this
[32:17] morning why do you still believe what

[34:08] allowed you to be born and he said
[34:10] that's enough for me to worship you just

[34:13] I get old yeah I know we've got some
[34:16] folks that are getting up there and you
[34:18] get to a place like I said where it gets
[34:20] more and more that you're dependent on
[34:22] on other people to help you through life
[34:24] you're dependent on others you think
[34:26] what am I going to do if I get old and
[34:28] I'm by myself what am I going to do but

[34:32] of old age forsake me not when my
[34:34] strength faileth let me tell you this
[34:36] morning if he did not forsake you when
[34:38] you were helpless coming out of the womb
[34:40] then he will not forsake you when you're
[34:42] helpless in a nursing home if you're
[34:44] helpless at home if you're helpless in
[34:46] the hospital he will not forsake you in
[34:48] your old age if he did not forsake you
[34:50] with your first breath he will not
[34:52] forsake you with your last breath amen
[34:55] amen Hallelujah listen Psalm 139

[35:30] down art acquainted with all my
[35:34] ways there is not a word in my tongue

[36:06] me such knowledge is too wonderful for
[36:10] me it is high I cannot attain unto it

[40:34] up in the morning and people use this
[40:36] many times of abortion but look at it in
[40:38] the sense of an adult now that's true

[40:47] him I'm not worth nothing yeah I'm
[40:50] worthless I'm I'm unbelievably bad right

[40:57] be but there is a
[41:02] remedy there is a remedy and no he
[41:05] didn't cause you to be unbelievably bad
[41:07] but he allowed it yeah he was there when
[41:11] you became bad the first time you ever
[41:15] took a cookie from the cookie jar he was
[41:17] there that's right yeah you get under
[41:20] condemnation many times think about this
[41:23] some of you ladies maybe and you
[41:25] backside and you cut your hair off you
[41:27] knew better you knew better at least by
[41:30] head knowledge but he was there yes when
[41:33] you did
[41:35] it that's good brother he he was there
[41:39] on he knew about it maybe he had to show
[41:41] you that you were
[41:42] broken so that you could come back to
[41:44] Christ
[41:46] yeah are you with me he allowed you to
[41:49] do that to take that make that choice
[41:51] but he's also giving you a way back yeah
[41:54] amen called repent repentance yeah and
[41:57] when you repent and are Justified it's
[42:00] as though you never did it in the first
[42:04] place yes
[42:06] sir you never smoked you never drank you
[42:10] never committed adultery you never cut
[42:12] your hair you never wore makeup you
[42:14] never did any of those
[42:17] things yes sir oh I hope you can see it
[42:21] tonight I I'm fearfully and wonderfully
[42:23] made marvelous are thy works and I am a
[42:26] work of God Amen yeah right you are too
[42:30] that my soul that my soul knoweth right
[42:32] well my substance was not hid from thee
[42:37] when I was made in
[42:39] secret and curiously wrought in the
[42:42] lower parts of the earth yes oh my when
[42:46] that first when that the the first germ
[42:49] of life ever was awakened and The Germ
[42:52] and the the the egg come together he was
[42:55] there
[42:56] he was with you then as he is with you
[43:00] now he said and and Thine Eyes did see
[43:04] my substance yet being unperfect in
[43:07] other words he knew what you would be he
[43:09] knew what every bit of your DNA how it
[43:12] would be manifested how it would be
[43:14] expressed but and to know that he would
[43:16] not only have to know who you were but
[43:18] what you would do yeah because your DNA
[43:22] actually is an expression who you are
[43:24] comes out as an expression but that
[43:26] expression can be changed by your
[43:29] environment right it's why some people
[43:31] can have the same DNA and act in
[43:33] completely different ways it changed by
[43:35] environment right you could have a twin
[43:37] and the two twins become almost
[43:39] completely different because they're
[43:40] almost exactly the same but they're just
[43:42] some little variance and so then you
[43:43] could have two people who were Twins and
[43:45] raised in the same house but yet had
[43:47] different experiences as adults they
[43:48] would be different yes right but God
[43:51] knew about that he wasn't unaware of
[43:54] that he said you saw my substance who I
[43:56] am yet being unperfect and in thy book
[43:59] all my members were written that's why
[44:02] brother brand could say for the bill
[44:04] that he said he said I haven't lost a
[44:09] hair where'd your hair go he said I
[44:11] haven't lost one of them yeah where were
[44:13] they before I got
[44:14] them well they were in the mind of God
[44:16] he knew how many hairs I had on my head
[44:19] right he's able to count them now look
[44:21] he said which in continues were
[44:23] fashioned and when is yet there was none
[44:25] of them so as this working was going on
[44:28] as this life come into my body and as I
[44:30] was growing in my mother's womb you
[44:32] already knew me what I would be
[44:34] everything that I would be so if you've
[44:37] had a stroke or or you've had a heart
[44:40] attack or you've had something that's
[44:42] changed you and yet you look at that and
[44:44] you're frustrated by it you think well I
[44:46] can't be what I was but God knew what
[44:48] you would be even the things that would
[44:50] go
[44:52] wrong you're still here this morning
[44:54] yeah amen
[44:56] that's right amen
[44:58] hallelujah how
[45:01] precious also are thy thoughts unto me
[45:04] oh God how great is the sum of
[45:09] them You' got to think about God like
[45:12] that yes you can't sit there and think
[45:13] Lord if you could have only made things
[45:15] go differently but each one of his
[45:17] thoughts are precious yes everything
[45:20] that you've been through is precious to
[45:22] God the Bible says even the death of the
[45:24] Saints is precious in the sight of God
[45:27] yes his thoughts are precious how
[45:30] precious are thy thoughts unto me oh God
[45:32] how great is the Su of them if I should
[45:34] count them they are more in number than
[45:36] the sand when I awake I am still with
[45:41] thee brother Brandon put it this way he
[45:43] said your birth here was pre-planned
[45:46] yeah you didn't plan it but somebody
[45:50] did did you know that your being here
[45:53] never originated just as a myth or a
[45:55] thought everything was all pre-planned
[45:58] by God before the foundation of the
[46:00] world that you would be here he said the
[46:03] infinite God know and to be infinite he
[46:06] had to know every flea I love this that
[46:08] would ever be in the earth and how many
[46:10] times it would bad its eye
[46:13] yeah he never reached the spot where the
[46:16] G where he said that's too
[46:18] much I don't need to know that have you
[46:21] ever been there somebody be telling you
[46:23] a bunch of stuff he said wait
[46:26] that happens in counseling a lot by the
[46:28] way because people's problems are a lot
[46:30] simpler than what they think they are
[46:33] the truth is the problem solver gave his
[46:35] word to us to live by and His holy
[46:38] spirit in us to guide us yes yes so many
[46:41] times that the complex things that we
[46:43] have and and sometimes I'll tell people
[46:45] I didn't need to know that
[46:47] yeahuh I just didn't need to know that
[46:49] but there's nothing that God don't need
[46:50] to know and nothing that he doesn't know
[46:53] that's right amen
[46:56] when Bo When you pray to him he already
[46:58] knew as you're struggling for the right
[46:59] words he already knew oh God what you
[47:04] would
[47:08] say and so much so that brother Bram
[47:10] typed to the faith of a young child who
[47:12] was sitting there praying his ABCs yeah
[47:15] and I said what are you doing he said
[47:17] I'm praying he said well he said well
[47:18] why are you just saying your ABCs he
[47:19] said well he said I don't know how to
[47:21] pray but I believe that God knows how to
[47:23] put it together yeah
[47:27] oh the important thing is not the words
[47:29] that are said but it's the action of
[47:32] prayer amen it's doing what God Said
[47:35] many times the important thing you say
[47:36] well I want to go to church when I feel
[47:38] like it no the important thing is not
[47:39] how you feel when you come to church but
[47:41] it's the fact that you're there yes sir
[47:44] and by being there you're honoring the
[47:45] word of God and God honors you with his
[47:47] presence yeah amen amen everything was
[47:50] pre-planned by God before the foundation
[47:53] of the world that you would be here yes
[47:55] the infinite God knew it to be infinite
[47:57] he had to know every flea that would
[47:58] ever be in the Earth how many times it
[48:00] would bat its eye he said that's
[48:02] infinite he said our little Minds cannot
[48:04] fathom what infinite means the infinite
[48:07] God he knew all things therefore there's
[48:09] nothing out of cater yes sir it's hard
[48:14] to wrap our minds around but it's
[48:16] absolutely the truth now the new birth
[48:19] is the same
[48:22] way God was there when you took your
[48:26] first breath
[48:27] yeah yeah as a christianen your first
[48:32] breath you have to acknowledge that well
[48:34] I got to figure it out for the been he
[48:36] was
[48:37] there and you couldn't make yourself yes
[48:41] sir take your first breath that's right
[48:44] as a
[48:45] Christian you could do everything he
[48:47] said you could pray you could come down
[48:49] to the altar I still believe in altar
[48:52] Clause I believe God moves that way
[48:53] don't you I still believe in the mov
[48:55] moving of the Holy Spirit yeah I believe
[48:57] if you have a pull in your heart whether
[48:59] you're saved or unsaved filled with the
[49:00] Holy Ghost you should come that's right
[49:02] if you feel in your heart that you
[49:03] should come you should come but yet God
[49:06] God already he was there yeah and and
[49:08] all of your effort could not make you a
[49:11] Christian you could not become a
[49:13] Christian by putting forth and exerting
[49:15] all of the oh I'm going to come to
[49:17] church I'm going to pay my tith if you
[49:19] were not in the mind of God you can't
[49:21] get blood out of etern it brother BR
[49:23] tells us in things that are to be you
[49:24] can't get blood out turn of you can't
[49:26] make something that God if it wasn't God
[49:28] he said if you were ever God you were
[49:30] always Gods you were in the mind of God
[49:33] before the foundation you cannot make
[49:35] yourself a Christian but you can follow
[49:37] when he said repent be baptized in the
[49:39] name of Jesus Christ you shall receive
[49:41] the gift of the Holy Ghost you can trust
[49:43] him that he'll do what he said yes but
[49:45] you can't that you're not making
[49:47] yourself a Christian because that first
[49:49] breath is a Christian come from God yes
[49:52] amen just as much as your first breath
[49:56] as a human being yes all right come from
[49:59] God isn't that a wonderful
[50:00] moment if you remember when your
[50:02] children were born maybe you remember
[50:04] when you were born but I kind of doubt
[50:07] it maybe somebody does I I'm going to
[50:09] say no one remembers when they're born
[50:11] but you know maybe maybe someone does I
[50:13] hope
[50:16] not but but maybe you remember when you
[50:20] were
[50:21] born and but you you couldn't do that
[50:24] for yourself you couldn't think now I'm
[50:26] going to breathe right I'm GNA be a
[50:30] Christian I'm going to be
[50:32] born you can't make yourself
[50:35] that let me let me go a little bit
[50:37] further your first breath your final
[50:41] breath you also can't control your next
[50:48] breath one of these days I'm getting a
[50:51] little bit ahead of myself here but I
[50:53] believe the spirit of the Lord is here
[50:54] this morning and we'll go on a little
[50:56] further but look one of these days
[50:59] you're going to take a
[51:01] step and the next breath
[51:06] you you're in a new
[51:09] body God
[51:11] Amen well what did I do to put myself
[51:13] there you made yourself
[51:16] ready but you can't put the Press of
[51:20] Life
[51:22] yeah you just
[51:24] breathe
[51:25] right you just breathe that's how you
[51:27] get through life you can't by your own
[51:29] effort put yourself in a Rapture if you
[51:31] weren't in the mind of God you'll never
[51:32] be there right right but you have to
[51:35] believe I am in the mind of God yeah I
[51:37] was there before the foundation of the
[51:39] earth and if I was there I'll always be
[51:41] there there's nothing out of cater and
[51:44] one day I'm going to step and I'm going
[51:45] to breathe I'm going to breathe out yes
[51:48] sir that's it
[51:54] come listen you can't even control how
[51:58] you become a Christian Paul couldn't
[51:59] control it Galatians 1:15 he said but
[52:01] when it pleased God when it pleased
[52:04] God who separated me from my mother's
[52:08] womb yeah right he already chose me to
[52:10] be a prophet to the Gentiles he already
[52:12] chose me to be who I am but one day it
[52:15] pleased
[52:16] God hallelujah and you think well that
[52:19] day I decided to go to church no there
[52:20] was something on the inside of you that
[52:23] was calling you to the house of God
[52:25] thought it was your own thoughts but
[52:26] there was something inside of you God
[52:28] chose a day amen so don't look back at
[52:31] your life and think oh I've wasted my
[52:33] life I've done no God chose the day you
[52:37] go when it pleased God you go who
[52:41] separated me from my mother's womb and
[52:42] called me by his
[52:44] grace Hallelujah to reveal his son in me
[52:48] that I might preach him among the
[52:49] Heathen he said I confer not with flesh
[52:51] or blood why because I couldn't make
[52:53] myself an apostle I can't give myself
[52:55] the Revelation yeah are you hearing
[52:58] me Paul said I didn't go learn it from
[53:00] the Ancients he'd already learned all
[53:01] that stuff yeah but I went down in to
[53:04] Damascus I went into Arabia returned to
[53:07] Damascus 1 Corinthians 15:9 for I am the
[53:10] least of the Apostles I'm not meat or
[53:13] fit to be called an apostle because I
[53:15] persecuted the Church of God but by the
[53:18] grace of God how many can say that this
[53:20] morning with honest heart you can say
[53:22] this morning by the grace of God I am
[53:25] what I am it pleased God one day that I
[53:28] would be saved it pleased him to give me
[53:30] the Holy Ghost it pleased him to call me
[53:32] into whatever service I'm in it pleased
[53:34] him
[53:36] yes that's why you'll never be able to
[53:38] do away with preachers that's right it
[53:40] pleased God separate them from his
[53:42] mother's womb their mother's womb amen
[53:45] you can't brother brandom said those
[53:46] five gifts were predestined look it up
[53:49] they're predestined by God to be in the
[53:50] church yes you can't separate that it's
[53:53] you don't make yourself a preacher
[53:55] all the study you could do all the
[53:57] you'll never have a supernatural element
[53:59] in your ministry unless God separated
[54:01] you sir and he called you and when he
[54:03] called you you may not be able to speak
[54:05] very well you may not have a lot up
[54:08] here I know I I know a doctor looked at
[54:11] my head the other day and said I've
[54:12] never seen so much fluid in a person's
[54:16] head there may not be much up here in
[54:18] the way of brains but I'll tell you this
[54:21] man I was separated from my mother's
[54:23] womb how do you know because when I
[54:25] preach God and God Honors that yes sir
[54:29] right and he he gives us the ministry we
[54:31] don't give ourselves the ministry but it
[54:33] gives us the ministry in our families
[54:35] and our churches and the people around
[54:37] us that's the fruit of it that's right
[54:39] the proof is in the pudding so to speak
[54:41] not because I say I'm a preacher anybody
[54:43] could say that
[54:45] yeah right or anybody else what's the
[54:47] fruit of brother rand's Ministry we'll
[54:48] get to that in a moment what was the
[54:49] fruit of his ministry he was separated
[54:51] from his mother's womb to be a prophet
[54:53] and you are the fruit yeah
[54:56] Glory the bride on the Earth today is
[54:58] the proof of brother
[55:04] Min he says he said by the grace of God
[55:07] I am what I am and his grace which was
[55:09] bestowed upon me was not in vain but I
[55:11] labored more abundantly than they all
[55:12] that's what Grace will do for you yeah
[55:14] it'll make you work for God yeah it'll
[55:16] make you serve him with all of your
[55:17] heart yes he said yet not I but the
[55:19] grace of God which was with
[55:21] me look what job says about Last Breath
[55:25] see you can't control that either put
[55:27] them thoughts of suicide out of your
[55:29] mind thoughts of depression yeah well
[55:32] I'm just going to quit put that out of
[55:34] your mind he didn't call you to
[55:37] quit you were born to win not to
[55:41] quit quit thinking about quitting right
[55:45] well I'm just going to quit it's a long
[55:46] ways to church and it's hard and I'm
[55:48] just going to quit listen about the time
[55:49] you're about to give up there's going to
[55:51] be something come on the inside of you
[55:53] that's going to raise you up maybe it's
[55:54] maybe it's this morning maybe as you
[55:56] listen to the word being preached there
[55:57] going to be something I was going to
[55:59] quit after today I was going to give up
[56:01] listen I preached the last sermon for
[56:03] some people I know what that's like but
[56:05] you can't control
[56:08] that sir I've told you before I preached
[56:10] a sermon I'll never forget it to a lady
[56:12] who walked into the church that morning
[56:14] and she' come off and on to church she
[56:15] wasn't there every every service but but
[56:17] she was a a part of the church and a a
[56:20] member as far as I knew a Godly person
[56:21] and she come in and set I'll never
[56:23] forget it back on the back pew I was
[56:25] preaching at brother Ivy that Sunday
[56:27] morning on the back pew that woman come
[56:29] in and sit and she sat there all that
[56:31] morning tears coming down her face and
[56:33] she'd come up to be prayed for and I
[56:35] prayed for her and she left and she went
[56:38] home and she got in a spat with her
[56:40] husband and for some reason her husband
[56:42] picked up a gun and blew her away the
[56:44] next
[56:44] day
[56:47] yeah and I thought about that moment sir
[56:51] there's nothing could keep me out of the
[56:53] pulpit yeah
[56:56] because I had a job to
[56:58] do and then every time I preach I don't
[57:00] know I have no clue yes sir who I'm
[57:03] going to preach to for the last time
[57:05] yeah are you with me yeah that haunts me
[57:09] today think about that what what could I
[57:10] have said differently but it was a
[57:11] pre-ordained moment God called her to be
[57:13] there at that
[57:14] moment in that time God's called you to
[57:16] be here at this moment in this time
[57:18] that's right job says man that is born
[57:19] of a woman is a few days and full of
[57:23] trouble yeah everybody get say amen yes
[57:26] he cometh like a flower and is cut down
[57:29] he fleeth also as a shadow and
[57:31] continueth not a man lasts just about as
[57:33] long as a flower out here in the
[57:34] churchyard with the kids running
[57:37] around they pierc for a while and they
[57:40] cut it down yeah right that's way my
[57:42] flowers are at the house for years said
[57:44] leave the flowers alone they'll only be
[57:46] there a little while you cut them down
[57:48] you bring them in you shorten their
[57:50] lifespan oh God that's what happens when
[57:52] we get our hands on our own life we want
[57:55] to control
[57:56] things yeah we can't control it yes sir
[58:01] he said th thou open Thine Eyes Upon
[58:02] such a one bringeth to him me into
[58:04] judgment he says with thee who can bring
[58:07] a clean thing out of an unclean not one
[58:09] seeing his days are determined sir the
[58:11] number of his months are with thee thou
[58:14] Hast appointed his bounds that he cannot
[58:18] pass yeah that's the word of God turn
[58:22] from him that he may rest till he shall
[58:25] accomplish as a
[58:27] hirling his day David tells us just
[58:31] about what those boundaries are he said
[58:33] the days of our years are three score
[58:34] years and 10 I'm sorry for everybody
[58:36] over 80 over
[58:38] 70 and if by reason of strength they be
[58:40] four score Years sir yet is their
[58:43] strength or the best part of it is labor
[58:45] and sorrow for it is soon cut off and we
[58:48] fly
[58:49] away we're told by the scripture that
[58:52] life passes quickly I'm sorry if I'm
[58:53] depressing you this morning just just
[58:54] hang with
[58:55] me he said behold thou has made my days
[58:58] as a hand breath yeah they measured
[59:02] things by hand breath it's the smallest
[59:03] unit of measurement my day is a hand
[59:05] breath my age is as nothing before thee
[59:09] rarely every man at his best fate is
[59:11] altogether vanity I thought about you
[59:13] sister Fritz when I when I uh when I uh
[59:16] wrote this or when I when I put it down
[59:19] when I was reading this I thought about
[59:20] sister Fritz cuz she told me one time
[59:22] that she heard the president I believe
[59:24] it was at Pearl Harbor over the radio
[59:26] announced or the people announced the
[59:27] newsman announced that Pearl Harbor had
[59:29] been
[59:30] hit think about that that a long time
[59:35] ago right some of y'all lived about that
[59:38] long huh you've lived your
[59:41] days right anything every day is a gift
[59:44] now every day is a gift but your day is
[59:47] just like a hand breath there's not been
[59:49] it's just like it passed like that and
[59:52] these people that are elderly could tell
[59:53] you that they could look back and say my
[59:54] days were just like that make them count
[59:57] Church yeah
[59:59] amen you'll you you'll never
[1:00:02] regret spending time with your family
[1:00:05] spending time with the family of God
[1:00:07] loving people but you will regret every
[1:00:09] moment that's
[1:00:12] true that you spent
[1:00:15] worrying hating
[1:00:18] yeah with bitterness yeah yes sir waste
[1:00:23] yes yeah the Bible says verily every man
[1:00:27] at his best state is altogether vanity
[1:00:30] Psalm 1444 man is like to vanity his
[1:00:32] days there as a shadow that passes away
[1:00:35] James 4:13 says go to now you that say
[1:00:38] today or tomorrow we will go into such a
[1:00:40] city and continue there a year and buy
[1:00:41] and sell and get gain so you make a
[1:00:43] plans for for trade and to do things he
[1:00:46] said whereas you know not what we shall
[1:00:48] be on tomorrow what is your life it is
[1:00:50] even a vapor or a Mist appears for a
[1:00:54] little while while and like the fog that
[1:00:55] burns off in the morning it just goes
[1:00:58] away one day you look where did Brother
[1:01:00] Where did so and so go they're not
[1:01:05] there Jesus tells the story of the rich
[1:01:08] man who who brought forth plentifully
[1:01:11] and he thought within himself saying
[1:01:12] what shall I do because I have no room
[1:01:14] where to bestow my fruits that's a rich
[1:01:16] man he said this will I do I'll pull
[1:01:19] down my Barns and build greater and I'll
[1:01:21] bestow all my fruits and my goods I will
[1:01:25] say to my soul soul thou has much Goods
[1:01:27] laid up for many years take thine ease
[1:01:31] eat drink and be married but God said
[1:01:32] unto him thou fool this night thy Soul
[1:01:35] shall be required of thee then who shall
[1:01:38] those things be which thou H has
[1:01:39] provided yes amen so is he that layeth
[1:01:42] up treasure for himself and is not rich
[1:01:45] sir toward God yes talking about brother
[1:01:47] hildbrand thinking about him this week
[1:01:49] that man was rich toward
[1:01:51] God what about you today what have you
[1:01:53] put over there
[1:01:55] right I plan on taking a trip this
[1:01:57] summer overseas and and brother Joel may
[1:01:59] go with me and I we haven't got it
[1:02:01] completely set yet so I don't want to
[1:02:02] tell you where just yet but and what
[1:02:04] it's going to be but but we uh planning
[1:02:06] on taking that trip and as I look
[1:02:08] forward to it and I think but you know
[1:02:10] what what why would we go I get thinking
[1:02:12] about that what what would be a
[1:02:13] successful trip if we're going to spend
[1:02:15] thousands of dollars and and fly
[1:02:17] overseas what what would be a success
[1:02:19] what would be a success if one
[1:02:22] Soul made a move move towards
[1:02:26] God that would be successful that's
[1:02:30] right that would be worth more than the
[1:02:32] thousands of dollars more than because
[1:02:34] the place where we're going it's very
[1:02:36] difficult to to preach and and to be in
[1:02:38] public as a minister it's like how what
[1:02:40] what would be worth it yeah it would be
[1:02:43] worth it if one person God sir what
[1:02:46] would be worth it I thought about that
[1:02:48] about my own Ministry what would make
[1:02:50] the years worth it I've spent I'm young
[1:02:52] but I've spent a quarter of a century in
[1:02:53] the pulpit that's right makes it sound
[1:02:55] longer if you say it that
[1:02:59] way I've spent 25 years
[1:03:02] preaching this year be 25 years what
[1:03:06] makes it worth it one Soul
[1:03:10] yeah one Soul if one person
[1:03:13] yeah what makes your life worth it have
[1:03:16] you got things here on the Earth but
[1:03:18] have you gathered up riches in heaven I

[1:03:38] been a friend to David David's been a
[1:03:39] friend to him and I thought well that's
[1:03:41] something that that's a a leading
[1:03:43] there's something there because there
[1:03:44] could be eternal life bestowed through
[1:03:46] that friendship there could be a there
[1:03:48] could be life given something could take
[1:03:50] place and and I thought about that and I
[1:03:52] thought Lord help me to be a friend yeah
[1:03:55] help me to be a a person what's what's
[1:03:57] it worth One Soul would be worth 10,000

[1:06:22] our Wednesday Services the one he
[1:06:24] preaches in Jeffersonville he preaches
[1:06:25] it twice but in the rejected King he
[1:06:27] said I had a wonderful afternoon talking
[1:06:29] to a famous doctor in Louisville he said
[1:06:32] they heard about the Glorious things of
[1:06:33] the Lord the nurse he said her father
[1:06:35] was a doctor and she'd come over and sit
[1:06:37] in my room most the afternoon come in
[1:06:38] dropped in a wonderful person he said a
[1:06:40] little hard some of those around the
[1:06:42] message he said kind of staunch real
[1:06:45] Presbyterian to start with met some of
[1:06:47] those too he said but left with tears
[1:06:49] running down her cheeks yes he said
[1:06:51] God's got them just everywhere in
[1:06:53] doctor's office officers and
[1:06:55] nurses he said I don't believe there's a
[1:06:57] nurse in Norton's infirmary Infirmary
[1:06:59] Hospital that I didn't testify to about
[1:07:02] having the Holy Ghost this convicted me
[1:07:04] man yeah I remember I got in the
[1:07:07] hospital one time for a week and I got
[1:07:10] put in the hospital I had a strep and I
[1:07:12] let it go too long refused to go to the
[1:07:14] doctor like some other people I know I
[1:07:16] refused to go to the doctor and I I let
[1:07:18] it go too long end up in the hospital
[1:07:20] almost died and and I finally got a
[1:07:22] little better and I was Gra man after
[1:07:24] that first or second day I wanted to go
[1:07:26] home I was tired I didn't realize they
[1:07:27] come in there and stuck you every day in
[1:07:29] your stomach you know with that stuff to
[1:07:30] keep your the blood clot from Foreman I
[1:07:32] hated that man I hated everything about
[1:07:35] it and at some point I I got in there
[1:07:36] and I got so frustrated and at some
[1:07:38] point I just began to pray Lord I can't
[1:07:40] do anything about it what am I going to
[1:07:42] do and I just and the Lord spoke to me
[1:07:44] he said make the best of it said okay
[1:07:47] what what can I do I can pray for these
[1:07:51] people sitting there feel sorry for for
[1:07:54] myself when nobody's coming to see me
[1:07:55] nobody I didn't tell nobody about it so
[1:07:57] it's a little bit difficult for people
[1:07:58] to come see you when you don't tell
[1:08:00] nobody it's been several years ago I
[1:08:03] sitting there feeling sorry for myself
[1:08:04] and Lord just said make the best of it
[1:08:06] I'm sitting there what can I do what can
[1:08:07] I possibly do and I've told you the
[1:08:09] story before my wife ended up going home
[1:08:11] and the alternator went out on my truck
[1:08:12] as she was driving home she was left on
[1:08:14] the side of the road her phone was dead
[1:08:15] she was on the side of the road dark on
[1:08:17] a four-lane road in Jonesboro Arkansas
[1:08:19] and a woman stopped by there who's she's
[1:08:20] friends with to this day a woman out of
[1:08:23] a nominal Church stopped by the
[1:08:24] recognizer to be a Christian took the
[1:08:26] kids there and I thought what if God put
[1:08:27] me in the hospital so that my wife an
[1:08:30] alternator could go bad in my truck so
[1:08:31] that my wife would be on the side of the
[1:08:33] road so that somebody would give her a
[1:08:35] fresh cup of cold water so they could be
[1:08:37] saved there you go
[1:08:40] [Applause]
[1:08:42] Amen brother Brandon was in the hospital
[1:08:44] for whatever reason that he was there
[1:08:46] and in the doctor's office and he said I
[1:08:48] asked her ask her if she was baptized in
[1:08:50] the name of Jesus not a doctor i' come
[1:08:52] in contact with anywhere he he said tell
[1:08:54] them about it we ain't got much time
[1:08:56] brother no matter how hard it seems here
[1:08:59] just wait till you cross that last
[1:09:01] breath Yonder and see you wish you had
[1:09:03] done it he said yester don't wait till
[1:09:05] that time let's do it right now this is
[1:09:06] the hour he said oh they might disagree
[1:09:09] and fume and fuss a little about it but
[1:09:10] they don't mean it they really don't
[1:09:13] mean it they're all right they go to
[1:09:14] fussing at you remember they don't
[1:09:15] really mean it they don't mean it they
[1:09:17] just maybe been taught something they
[1:09:18] just hang to that you can see their idea
[1:09:20] I wish we had this kind of patience with
[1:09:22] each other yeah with other message
[1:09:24] people with other people we go to church
[1:09:27] with they get to fuss with you they
[1:09:29] don't really mean it oh God just be
[1:09:32] patient God will lead them if they're
[1:09:33] God feel they'll he'll bring them to it
[1:09:36] amen and so they he said don't fuss with
[1:09:38] them don't fuss with no one don't fuss
[1:09:40] with no one but just love them right
[1:09:42] into
[1:09:43] it see the Bible says the fruit of the
[1:09:45] righteous is a tree of life and he that
[1:09:48] winth Souls is
[1:09:51] wise when the time comes you want
[1:09:54] that last breath to be real you want it
[1:09:56] to do something you want to be in a
[1:09:59] condition that you're ready to go but
[1:10:02] the brandom tells us that man-made
[1:10:03] theories will not stand when you're
[1:10:04] coming down to the last breath of this
[1:10:06] body I want you to think about
[1:10:09] it man-made theories will not stand when
[1:10:12] you come down to the last breath of this
[1:10:13] body this life he said it's good to live
[1:10:15] by those things but you can't die by
[1:10:17] them yeah he said I guess for my age in
[1:10:20] the ministry I probably stood by as many
[1:10:22] dying people as anyone of my age because
[1:10:24] I've been much called on to the dying
[1:10:27] and he talks about these two young
[1:10:28] ladies you've heard the story but he
[1:10:30] talked about the two young ladies and
[1:10:31] one of them was from his church and one
[1:10:33] of them was went to a liberal church
[1:10:34] that didn't teach the Holy Ghost and
[1:10:36] things like that and and the pastor told
[1:10:38] her she was going to heaven because she
[1:10:39] was a Sunday school teacher and he
[1:10:41] talked about this woman as she come to
[1:10:42] the hour of her death something had
[1:10:44] happened it was a a veneral disease it
[1:10:46] was it was because of the life that she
[1:10:48] lived and and the pastor was there and
[1:10:51] he stepped outside to smoke out of in
[1:10:53] the hall and when death struck the girls
[1:10:56] she began to get
[1:10:57] hysteric and she said listen she didn't
[1:11:00] call for a pastor she said where is that
[1:11:02] girl yes right they said what girl she
[1:11:05] said here's all of your class she said
[1:11:07] I'm not talking about them I'm talking
[1:11:09] about that girl called her name that's
[1:11:10] from up there at the Tabernacle that
[1:11:12] used to speak to me about my soul
[1:11:15] yeah said go get her y they went to the
[1:11:18] pastor and he'd come running in he said

[1:11:28] men I'm lost and going to hell because
[1:11:31] you taught me that and the girl died and
[1:11:33] went out to meet God lost crying for the
[1:11:35] girl that had tried to tell her what was
[1:11:38] right oh
[1:11:40] God yeah see you can't do anything about
[1:11:43] when your last breath is but you can do
[1:11:45] something about where your next breath
[1:11:47] is Sir listen you can't do nothing about
[1:11:50] when you can do something about
[1:11:52] where yeah that's right if the next
[1:11:56] breath is your last
[1:11:58] breath and you are God's if I could say
[1:12:01] it that way you're filled you're sealed
[1:12:03] by the Holy Spirit Paul tells about you
[1:12:06] he says behold I show you a mystery go
[1:12:10] to that next that next scripture behold
[1:12:12] I I show you a mystery we shall not all

[1:12:45] going to happen that's right but I want
[1:12:46] to be ready amen yes so that so that if
[1:12:50] it happens that quickly I'm just ready

[1:13:35] swallowed up in Victory amen oh death
[1:13:40] where is thy steam oh grave where is thy
[1:13:44] Victory Paul is sitting in Chains about

[1:13:56] Victory where is your
[1:13:58] sting brother brandom told us how that

[1:14:03] it stung that body of the Son of God it
[1:14:06] couldn't sting anymore yeah the fear of
[1:14:08] death was gone and so Paul said oh death
[1:14:12] where you at death yeah you got no sting

[1:14:45] dreaming he had several dreams that he
[1:14:46] tells about there and he raised up and
[1:14:48] sat against the headboard this is from
[1:14:50] that same sermon where brother brother
[1:14:53] brandom talks about uh a rejected King
[1:14:57] the rejected King and he tells this
[1:15:01] story and he he'd been he'd been
[1:15:03] dreaming he raised up and he was
[1:15:05] thinking about half of his appointed
[1:15:07] time he said at least half was gone
[1:15:09] because he was 50 years old yeah and so
[1:15:12] he was sitting there and he said I
[1:15:14] looked and I heard something kept saying
[1:15:18] you're just
[1:15:21] starting praise God see the opening of
[1:15:24] the seals the opening of the word all
[1:15:25] those things be we're we're coming right
[1:15:28] right all those great things that we
[1:15:29] look at now as the as the capping Stone
[1:15:32] of his ministry the Pentecostals thought
[1:15:33] he was washed up that's right we look at
[1:15:35] that as the Capstone of his ministry he
[1:15:37] said he said you're just starting press
[1:15:40] the battle yes sir amen just keep
[1:15:43] pressing and there it come again said
[1:15:46] just keep pressing oh my if you only
[1:15:49] knew what was at the end of the road
[1:15:51] that's it and you'll see that I'm
[1:15:52] skipping some of these paragraphs as I'm
[1:15:54] going down to save time but you just
[1:15:55] hang with me today you go back and read
[1:15:57] it for yourself but he said I heard
[1:15:59] something say would you like to see just
[1:16:02] beyond the
[1:16:03] curtain well I'm so glad he showed a
[1:16:05] prophet behind the curtain now he was
[1:16:07] sitting there and he talks about how he
[1:16:09] that song beyond the curtain of time was
[1:16:12] in his mind he was thinking about it he
[1:16:13] said I could like I could hear him sing
[1:16:15] it but the gr snailing he said I could
[1:16:16] hear him sing it and here he's thinking
[1:16:18] about it and and they the voice said
[1:16:20] would you like to see just beyond the
[1:16:22] curtain yes sir I said it would help me
[1:16:24] so much amen and I looked in just a
[1:16:28] moment I don't know what this means to
[1:16:30] you church but I believe this amen I
[1:16:32] believe this if I didn't believe it I'd
[1:16:34] give up right now and quit preaching
[1:16:35] yeah but I believe this really happened
[1:16:37] yes sir yes and I looked in just a
[1:16:39] moment he said one breath had come in
[1:16:42] now notice it he said I in one breath
[1:16:45] one breath
[1:16:48] yeah he's thinking about these things
[1:16:50] and he
[1:16:52] breathe he breathed out yep he said and
[1:16:55] in one breath I'd come into a little
[1:16:57] place slanted he said I looked back and
[1:17:00] there I was laying on the bed yes sir
[1:17:03] and I said this is a strange
[1:17:08] thing oh God and he was showing him
[1:17:11] something that would be by the
[1:17:14] way yes and you realize when brother
[1:17:17] brandham died in a car
[1:17:19] wreck yeah you remember he at some point
[1:17:23] point he is in the car wreck and he was
[1:17:25] in the hospital and at some point after
[1:17:27] about a week or two weeks whatever that
[1:17:28] it was he at some point he's in there
[1:17:31] and he
[1:17:33] goes that's it no more breathing they
[1:17:37] said he's gone yes
[1:17:40] sir but when he took his next breath
[1:17:47] yeah he was back yeah yes sir hey like
[1:17:53] to feel sorry for people that pass away
[1:17:55] that's right just think about it and I
[1:17:58] looked and young women maybe in their
[1:17:59] early 20s 18 to 20 they throwing their
[1:18:01] arms around me and screaming our
[1:18:02] precious
[1:18:04] brother amen I stopped and I looked and
[1:18:07] I was young I looked back at my old body
[1:18:09] laying there with my hands behind my
[1:18:10] head and I said I don't understand this
[1:18:13] and and you remember this is the place
[1:18:14] because Jesus and read in a minute Jesus
[1:18:17] wasn't there but there will come a time
[1:18:19] when when he'll come back with him and
[1:18:22] they'll meet us in the air and and and
[1:18:24] again I'm not going to explain all of
[1:18:25] that this morning it's not the purpose
[1:18:26] of this sermon even if I could explain
[1:18:29] it but you understand that that the
[1:18:31] Saints the dead in Christ rise first
[1:18:34] well this is where they come from that's
[1:18:36] right right is where he went yeah that's
[1:18:39] why I say he went back yeah right and
[1:18:42] when we go into rapture we go into that
[1:18:44] Dimension until the into of the marriage
[1:18:46] supper and and we come back here right
[1:18:49] yeah amen with them now look now he he
[1:18:53] said they said our precious brother here
[1:18:54] come young men in the Brilliance of

[1:19:03] oh our precious brother you think they
[1:19:05] weren't
[1:19:09] emotional that's it oh you think it

[1:22:09] love to enter there there was no
[1:22:12] jealousy there was no tiredness I know

[1:22:32] even
[1:22:33] know it' make it difficult for me to
[1:22:35] work at a funeral home because it just
[1:22:37] it's difficult for me I I I tend to
[1:22:39] empathize in that way but there will
[1:22:40] come a day I'll never cry another tear
[1:22:44] yes Oh my he said it was one Joy said oh
[1:22:47] my precious brother and they took me up
[1:22:50] and set me on a great big high place I
[1:22:53] thought I am not dreaming I'm looking
[1:22:54] back on my body laying down there on the
[1:22:56] bed and they set me up there and I said
[1:22:58] oh I shouldn't sit up here Oh my he said
[1:23:01] and then that voice that was speaking
[1:23:02] from above me he said you know it is
[1:23:04] written in the Bible that the prophets
[1:23:05] were gathered with their people and I
[1:23:07] said yes I remember that in the
[1:23:08] scriptures he said well this is when you
[1:23:10] will gather with your people I said then
[1:23:13] they'll be real and I can feel them he
[1:23:15] said oh yes yes yes Glory Glory I said
[1:23:20] but there's Millions amen there not that
[1:23:22] many brandom and that voice said they're
[1:23:24] not brandom there means your converts
[1:23:26] yes that's the ones you've led to the
[1:23:28] Lord yeah you know I I've been led to
[1:23:31] the Lord by this the message of the hour
[1:23:33] that's right amen by the message that
[1:23:35] William Brandon preached and I all of us
[1:23:37] could say that because he was the
[1:23:38] messenger to the age that's
[1:23:40] right I don't believe that we each
[1:23:43] Pastor will have our own individual
[1:23:44] group we may we'll know who each other
[1:23:46] are and I'll be judged for what I
[1:23:48] preached to you but I'm as long as I
[1:23:51] stay under that message of message of
[1:23:52] the age I go in under that promise so
[1:23:55] how important it is for me to say what
[1:23:57] he said amen right not what he said plus
[1:24:00] what somebody else said but say what he
[1:24:03] said because if I say what he said then
[1:24:05] that's and understand that what him
[1:24:07] being a word prophit that he was
[1:24:08] scriptural right and that takes me back
[1:24:11] to the Bible then I can preach the Bible
[1:24:12] like we did this morning and I'm
[1:24:14] preaching the message of the hour yes
[1:24:17] right now look he said then he said you
[1:24:20] know it's written that prophet gather
[1:24:22] with the people he said yes I remember
[1:24:23] that in the scripture he said well this
[1:24:24] is when you will gather with your people
[1:24:25] they'll be real I can feel them I said
[1:24:27] but there's Millions there's not that
[1:24:28] many brandom Bo said they're not brandom
[1:24:29] them is your converts they're the ones
[1:24:31] that you've led to the Lord I said some
[1:24:32] of them women there that you he said
[1:24:34] some of them women there that you think
[1:24:35] is so beautiful were better than 90
[1:24:37] years
[1:24:40] old sister Fritz I don't mean to pick on
[1:24:42] you this morning but I don't remember
[1:24:43] what you look like I've seen a few
[1:24:44] pictures of when you were younger but I
[1:24:45] don't remember what you look like one
[1:24:47] day I'm going to
[1:24:50] know we were both the same message we're
[1:24:53] going to be gathered in the same group
[1:24:55] yes you understand and be gathered and
[1:24:58] and and and there's a lot to that I
[1:25:00] understand that but we I believe that I
[1:25:01] believe we'll know each other we're the
[1:25:03] Overcomers of the L ofan age yes
[1:25:06] sir that's right yes sir but the Brandon
[1:25:09] was an overcomer of the lat of c and age

[1:25:12] blood that we are yeah he was an
[1:25:14] overcomer of the lat of c and AG yeah
[1:25:16] but he went on he waved the flag dust
[1:25:18] said come on it can be done there's some
[1:25:20] sons of God on the Earth again he didn't
[1:25:22] die to promote his own Ministry he
[1:25:24] didn't live his life to promote his own
[1:25:26] Ministry but he said there's more coming
[1:25:28] yeah are you with me now there's more
[1:25:31] coming I he can say I was a sinner saved
[1:25:34] by grace and I come to a place amen
[1:25:36] where the Holy Spirit could speak
[1:25:38] through my life listen to me he wasn't
[1:25:40] the only one the third pole was not just
[1:25:42] for brother Brandon but it was for the
[1:25:43] ones that could speak the word and say
[1:25:45] it's nothing but the
[1:25:48] truth hallelujah come on now that's

[1:26:38] your teaching yes sir and look where

[1:27:14] like this yes oh my I said then I
[1:27:17] preached every word that they preach
[1:27:19] every word that they preach I never from
[1:27:22] it one side to the other where they
[1:27:24] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ I
[1:27:26] did too where they taught the baptism of
[1:27:28] the Holy Ghost I did too whatever they
[1:27:31] taught I did
[1:27:33] too don't you realize the importance of
[1:27:35] staying with that word if a prophet
[1:27:37] didn't go back to his own Supernatural
[1:27:40] experience but he went back to the word
[1:27:41] and said I taught what Peter taught I
[1:27:44] taught what Paul taught yeah oh my what
[1:27:46] it ought to do to us today I can come
[1:27:48] under that same message today and say I
[1:27:50] taught what a prophet taught I taught
[1:27:51] what Paul taught I taught what Peter
[1:27:53] taught I taught what was in the
[1:27:55] scripture and I can't let nobody take me
[1:27:58] off of those grounds much as I might
[1:28:00] love somebody what their last name might
[1:28:01] be what their first name might be if
[1:28:03] they were in my own family or somebody
[1:28:04] like that I cannot move myself from what
[1:28:06] a prophet taught thank amen can't do it
[1:28:11] because if I do that I won't come in
[1:28:13] under that blessing I have to be judged
[1:28:15] separately
[1:28:17] yes
[1:28:19] yeah you be judged according to the word
[1:28:21] that you preached amen oh

[1:28:43] will there be a literal time when he
[1:28:45] introduces us to Christ personally I
[1:28:47] don't know there may be but I do know we
[1:28:50] have been introduced to Christ by the
[1:28:51] word
[1:28:52] that's already taken place this message
[1:28:55] introduced us to Christ he said now he
[1:28:58] said you will guide us to him all
[1:28:59] together you will guide us to him and
[1:29:01] all together we'll go back to the Earth

[1:34:33] he said but oh that wasn't it he talked
[1:34:35] about how that he he was reassured by
[1:34:37] the doctor he was in good shape he said
[1:34:39] but oh that wasn't it that isn't it it's
[1:34:43] something within here this corruption he
[1:34:46] quotes Paul got to put on incorruption
[1:34:49] yes this Mortal has got to put on
[1:34:53] immortality yes musicians go ahead and
[1:34:56] come
[1:35:02] I many of you have been there for
[1:35:05] someone's Last Breath yes but did you
[1:35:07] ever think about their next
[1:35:15] breath I've as as a minister you end up
[1:35:19] with George in two more death rooms than
[1:35:21] you want to be in I remember I had
[1:35:24] pastored that little church at branville
[1:35:25] and it one of the hardest things I ever
[1:35:27] did was go watch a man sit with a man
[1:35:29] who was struggling with cancer brother
[1:35:30] HL gay was struggling with cancer right
[1:35:32] after my dad my own father passed away
[1:35:36] and I sat there in the room with my dad
[1:35:38] and and you know you can't those
[1:35:41] emotions are going to get to you you
[1:35:42] can't help it I had cried and the day
[1:35:45] before
[1:35:46] he I think it was a day before two days
[1:35:49] before right before he slipped into
[1:35:50] unconsciousness he had told us that he
[1:35:53] was sorry for some things and dad was a
[1:35:55] hard
[1:35:58] man I
[1:36:02] spent the last few minutes of his life
[1:36:06] I'm just trying to be real this morning
[1:36:07] church just just bear with
[1:36:09] me thinking about the times and the
[1:36:11] breasts that we' used with one another
[1:36:14] we spent hundreds of hours arguing with
[1:36:18] each other
[1:36:20] hundreds
[1:36:22] and I at that moment I I sit there and
[1:36:25] thought what does it all
[1:36:27] matter I wish I'd have just given in
[1:36:29] sometimes not to not to believe anything
[1:36:31] wrong or do anything wrong but just let
[1:36:33] him have his
[1:36:36] say what did it
[1:36:38] matter was there in know in a moment
[1:36:40] that was real and I got thinking about
[1:36:42] that I wasted way too many days and
[1:36:47] hours and since that time I've thought
[1:36:49] about that a lot and I thought Lord
[1:36:52] I don't know but but sometime before
[1:36:54] that and I've told you before I had an
[1:36:55] experience with the Lord and He allowed
[1:36:56] me to really forgive my dad really let
[1:36:59] some things
[1:37:01] go and there at the end I forg forgave
[1:37:04] him before he ever apologized to me but
[1:37:07] he apologized it meant so much to me but
[1:37:09] I'll never forget laying there or or
[1:37:11] sitting there beside his bed kneeling
[1:37:13] beside his bed and he's struggling to
[1:37:16] breathe and at that moment I I felt
[1:37:18] guilty for thinking it but my only
[1:37:21] thought was just
[1:37:22] go just go you're hurting too bad
[1:37:26] there's too much
[1:37:27] pain and I thought I felt guilty for
[1:37:30] thinking that and I'm standing there and
[1:37:32] or or kneeling there and and I had a
[1:37:33] hold of his hand and my brother Samuel
[1:37:36] was there my brother Jonathan had not
[1:37:37] made it in yet and the younger kids were
[1:37:39] in the other room my sisters are here
[1:37:42] this morning were not very old and I'm
[1:37:44] sorry for bringing this up this morning
[1:37:45] but it just meant so much to me here
[1:37:47] we're not very old when dad passed away
[1:37:50] but he was was in the they were in the
[1:37:52] other room in the waiting room family
[1:37:54] waiting room mom was with them Sam went
[1:37:55] to tell them that he was he looked like
[1:37:57] he was about to pass and I put my hand
[1:38:00] on his and he he kind
[1:38:04] of catch his breath you know they do and
[1:38:07] prob
[1:38:09] goes was
[1:38:10] [Music]
[1:38:12] it never exhaled he never took another
[1:38:16] breath this world I thought about that a
[1:38:19] lot we wasted so much breath
[1:38:22] arguing but I believe that the next
[1:38:24] breath that he
[1:38:26] took was in that
[1:38:30] place and he didn't do much to get
[1:38:32] himself there he's a hard man
[1:38:37] contrary had a lot of things
[1:38:40] that but he was my
[1:38:43] dad and I believe that he made it I
[1:38:45] believe he made things right with God
[1:38:46] and he made it he was a preacher all of
[1:38:48] my life but I believe at the very end he
[1:38:50] made things right with God being a
[1:38:51] preacher don't mean you're right with
[1:38:52] God by the
[1:38:54] way you want to be right with God get
[1:38:55] right with your
[1:38:57] family get right with your church get
[1:38:59] right with people around you you can't
[1:39:01] treat them evil and be right with God
[1:39:05] but I'll never forget that he his hands
[1:39:09] the movement stopped the pulse stopped
[1:39:10] everything
[1:39:12] stopped but I saw
[1:39:15] this but his next breath
[1:39:19] was amen
[1:39:22] all the pain of spending a year with
[1:39:24] bladder cancer was gone just like that
[1:39:27] yeah listen I don't know if you'll go by
[1:39:29] way of the Grave or going to Rapture but
[1:39:31] one day you'll take your last
[1:39:32] breath that's that's it there's no more
[1:39:36] you can't buy
[1:39:37] anymore yeah you you couldn't purchase
[1:39:40] it on the market that'll be it what did
[1:39:41] you do with your time yeah what did you
[1:39:44] do with your time but if he was there at
[1:39:47] your first breath yes amen if you you
[1:39:51] were God you might have made a lot of
[1:39:52] mistakes but he was there when you took
[1:39:54] that first breath into life he was there
[1:39:57] when you took your last one yes he was
[1:39:59] there all the way down through all the
[1:40:01] breasts in between yes he'll be there
[1:40:03] for your next breath
[1:40:05] yes go into a better place into another
[1:40:08] body one day we'll be just walking
[1:40:10] brother Joe I believe it's my generation
[1:40:12] I believe me and brother Joe's going to
[1:40:14] see it it's our generation we're going
[1:40:15] to see it by the steward we're going to
[1:40:17] be walking one day we're going to be
[1:40:18] walking like like you know walked with
[1:40:21] God one day you're going to be maybe at
[1:40:23] the bank where they I don't know I don't
[1:40:24] know if it'll be in church I kind of
[1:40:25] think probably not because it said to
[1:40:27] will be in the field I I don't know
[1:40:28] where it'll be I don't know how early
[1:40:29] you get to the bank but sometime in the
[1:40:31] morning maybe you'll be there at the
[1:40:32] bank you'll be sitting there and and and
[1:40:35] just sitting there doing your work and
[1:40:37] going over the books and things like
[1:40:38] that and you take a
[1:40:40] breath yes that's
[1:40:43] it but don't you want to be ready when

[1:41:09] conviction in your heart as there has
[1:41:10] been in mine this morning as I think
[1:41:11] about these things that think about my
[1:41:13] own father my relationship with him and
[1:41:16] and different things that you've been
[1:41:17] through I know I use that quite a bit
[1:41:18] because that's my own story but you know

[1:41:22] situations and things and you live in
[1:41:26] different places and and and you've had
[1:41:28] to deal with different things and you're
[1:41:29] sitting there and you're thinking here's
[1:41:31] a breath that I could have used
[1:41:32] differently here's a moment that I could
[1:41:35] have used differently but God knew he
[1:41:37] had it all in his hands but why don't
[1:41:40] you just talk to him today and say Lord
