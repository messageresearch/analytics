[9:57] of bowers or on the feet ask root sit
[10:01] under me faster first

[17:57] me
[17:59] joe you agree
[18:01] it was the devil
[18:02] and i'm telling you it was the devil
[18:06] diablo
[18:09] it was the devil
[18:12] but the devil was not able to redeem
[18:15] melody
[18:17] because he was not worthy
[18:25] he was not jesus christ when the devil
[18:29] failed godly diabetes
[18:31] this is how jesus said i am worthy of
[18:34] this sweet in you
[18:36] i don't want to give you the quote
[18:38] because maybe the preacher is going to
[18:39] give it to you
[18:48] it was the devil because he is not
[18:50] worthy he doesn't have enough
[18:54] to the
[19:01] amen

[19:47] god has put in his heart
[19:50] a pressure since he came back from south
[19:53] africa
[20:00] to leave and go somewhere else
[20:05] we will continue to pray for him

[20:31] facial evangelistic
[20:38] and she was the one
[20:40] in charge of all the technology

[22:02] i think i've preached this once in 2011.
[22:07] cc in four hours
[22:10] regarding redemption
[22:13] and um
[22:15] i
[22:17] added that also in my mind
[22:21] and when the brother lunda started
[22:23] preaching i said brother just
[22:27] take your time
[22:35] because that's what god has put in
[22:38] heart and that's what he has put also in
[22:39] you have my
[22:42] his heart
[22:45] the plan of redemption is very very
[22:48] important

[29:00] rich chappie cat ruth chapter four
[29:13] we're going to take verse 1 to 6 today
[29:20] then went boaz up to the gate and set
[29:23] him down there and behold the kinsman of
[29:26] whom bose
[29:28] was a
[29:29] spec came by
[29:30] unto him unto whom he said ho
[29:33] such a one turn aside sit down here and
[29:37] turn and you turn aside and sat down and
[29:40] it took ten men off the elders of the
[29:43] city and said sit here down here and
[29:47] they sat down and he said unto the
[29:49] kinsmen now to the kingsmen naomi that
[29:52] is come again out of the country of the
[29:54] moab settler a self apostle of land
[29:58] which was our brother elima lex
[30:02] and i thought to
[30:04] advertise these saying but buy it before
[30:08] the inhabitants and before the elders of
[30:11] my people if thou will redeem it redeem
[30:14] it but if thou will not redeem it then
[30:17] tell me that i may know for there is
[30:20] none to redeem it by beside thee
[30:23] and i am after thee and he said i will
[30:27] redeem it then said bose
[30:30] what the
[30:31] what thou buyers defeat
[30:33] what what day thou bias the field of the
[30:37] hand of naomi thou might buy it also of
[30:41] ruth the moabitess the wife of the dead
[30:44] to raise up the name of the dead
[30:47] upon his
[30:48] inheritance and the kinsmen said i
[30:51] cannot redeem it for myself lest among
[30:55] my own inheritance
[30:57] redeem thou my right to thyself for i
[31:00] cannot redeem it
[31:02] [Music]
[33:07] you have inspired these words
[33:12] and their anointing
[33:17] we can hold together
[33:21] and uh us speaking and
[33:36] knowing that the devil does not like
[33:38] this day
[33:40] but we are more than pressured
[33:43] he has no power because it's been
[33:46] anything
[33:47] bless thy people that have gone
[33:50] give them the anointing
[33:53] as we commit the service unto you or
[33:54] know the senior jesus in the name of
[33:56] jesus christ amen amen
[34:00] thank you may you may be seated
[34:06] and i greet you in the name of the lord
[34:07] jesus christ
[34:11] you can also greet one another may god
[34:13] bless you richly
[34:30] it is good to be in the house of the
[34:32] lord
[34:46] and now
[34:54] [Music]
[35:14] possibly a preacher cannot take all the
[35:17] angles for as much possible
[35:20] sentence
[35:26] the holy ghost
[35:28] teacher can open to us even more
[35:34] you can see barbara branham preaching
[35:36] arrow shall restore the divine
[35:38] presence
[35:39] he goes somewhere else he preaches the
[35:41] same presence
[35:56] your friends are somewhere else so he
[35:58] goes a little bit deeper than other
[36:00] places
[36:01] amen amen
[36:07] today we're going to see the four
[36:08] conditions or requirements
[36:14] the four requirements of redemption
[36:18] condition
[36:21] the four
[36:22] requirements to be a kinsmen redeemer
[36:43] automatically we redeem everything that
[36:45] belongs to naomi van gaal
[36:47] as we just read it in the bible boaz
[36:50] montal apart boaz went to the gate
[36:58] [Music]
[37:06] know when the person asked if they had
[37:09] to ask questions or not hey lisa what do
[37:11] you know and people say no he said
[37:13] i said
[37:16] people are afraid of what huh
[37:19] don't be afraid
[37:35] in chapter three
[37:38] ruth went to the feet of balls
[37:44] and she said to boys
[38:32] but she had the revelation that this man
[38:34] had declared righteousness
[38:37] but she had to go with humility
[38:41] said humility and when bulls saw that
[38:44] humility is
[38:56] [Music]
[38:58] but you came to my feed to say that i
[39:01] have had the right of to redeem a guest
[39:03] is a person but what happened boaz uh
[39:06] the boys avi and levi
[39:09] the bulls are removed on his skirt
[39:27] chris you don't lose sentence
[39:29] god christ gives the holy ghost to the
[39:31] church regardless
[39:34] to keep the church in the right portfol
[39:36] garden
[39:39] to keep you straight and fair hey
[39:51] because this robe served to our route
[40:09] ourselves amen amen
[40:12] us and we're living in the age of us the
[40:16] last one
[40:18] valedictory as the bible would say
[40:22] the devil is roaring like a lion he'll
[40:24] share a key illusive seeking who to
[40:26] devour
[40:28] who he cannot seduce you
[40:31] he doesn't want you to get to the right
[40:34] to play this technique he has a multiply
[40:36] all these traffic light media with media
[40:38] like television television let's steal
[40:41] and a style le mans and uh fashion
[40:43] eleven
[40:45] he really got to the point
[40:50] because he knows that these things can
[40:51] capture people's mind
[40:54] television and uh this is today's tv
[40:59] show the devil uses so much of these
[41:01] things but then we don't know the

[50:38] prosperity he has to be the kin and the
[50:40] nearest kinsman doc
[50:45] now for somebody to redeem
[50:52] cat recon
[50:58] he must be the nearest kinsmen
[51:01] brush
[51:02] nearest
[51:43] now we're going to see with all those
[51:44] requirements that god puts for somebody
[51:46] to be a kingsman
[51:48] we'll
[52:14] he must be an upright man
[52:18] or adjustment
[52:26] he must be a nearest
[52:28] kinsman
[52:29] he must be an uprising or just
[52:33] a
[52:34] antagonist or to be uh
[52:37] upright to just second law
[52:42] and now we must not find even a small
[52:45] blame ahmed amen

[53:29] don't
[53:30] do etherish you must be rich sif is a
[53:32] marriage you have to be enough rich
[53:38] and then the last condition a particular
[53:40] person
[53:48] the man has to be enough right now
[53:52] the person has to be rich enough a
[53:54] president
[53:56] after filling those three requirements
[54:00] and the fourth
[54:02] to dua a president you must be after
[54:05] that ten year people come up to make a
[54:08] public testimony
[54:15] i think that you write it like that
[54:18] don't publicly
[54:20] public a public testimony
[54:35] now let's go slowly
[54:36] hey end question
[54:39] what happened
[54:40] boaz balls
[54:43] savvy tutsi condition knew all those
[54:45] requirements
[54:47] and the boss knew that
[54:50] naomi
[55:03] you cannot have a naomi without having
[55:05] uh you cannot have rude without having
[55:07] nothing else
[55:10] because it was naomi that was tied to
[55:12] the family of boa naomi naomi
[55:15] ellie miller his her husband was
[55:18] eliminated
[55:30] naomi coming back into the land
[55:45] but since i cannot do it
[55:49] because there's a more nearest
[55:52] man
[55:53] you can be in the family yeah
[55:55] there was probably the elder that has to
[55:57] do it
[55:58] that's why he says
[56:15] kinsmen that's a passage that was
[56:17] already a check
[56:18] and tag he must be just better
[56:21] probably he would go through
[56:24] but he must have enough money remarkably
[56:27] notice what he says here
[56:51] when the opportunity was given to him
[56:53] tonight you have to redeem it
[56:55] he said
[56:56] luigi
[57:24] before i cannot redeem it
[57:27] amen amen amen
[57:30] that a redeemed no shame sorry no i
[57:32] cannot dua to pedophile you can do it
[57:37] because i'm not able to do it forever
[57:42] no rules are represented
[57:44] represents you
[57:46] when adam fell
[57:48] no
[57:49] it's our fathers who failed
[57:52] and we fell with them met enough but now
[57:56] can we rested and set conditions we
[57:57] didn't have to stay in that condition
[58:01] and the devil had the first made them
[58:05] and he had everybody locked up in prison
[58:08] now he requires somebody
[58:12] must be a nearest kingsman
[58:15] he required a man
[58:17] to be right and tagged and to be
[58:19] faithful
[58:20] not
[58:38] [Applause]
[58:47] i speak with you face to face amen amen
[58:51] but you will not be able to do it
[58:52] bhaskar because
[58:56] because birth killing set in luala del
[58:58] amor and this law of death
[59:01] to redeem it sir exigent
[59:14] he must be a nearest a person
[1:00:27] gracious grace by christ
[1:00:30] he is reconciling the world
[1:00:34] it's god the spirit that's just said he
[1:00:37] made the flesh
[1:00:39] he has the flesh like you and i jesse
[1:00:42] chris jesus christ

[1:00:50] attention tempted like you and i live
[1:00:52] fully he wanted basketball
[1:01:08] and when he declared it
[1:01:10] lord may see the men here
[1:01:14] then he had the right of redemption for
[1:01:16] naomi
[1:01:18] he could not do it he'll defer to the
[1:01:20] patronage he said the unless our mama my
[1:01:23] own inheritance
[1:01:24] i cannot redeem them
[1:01:26] and now you boys you fell after you can
[1:01:28] do it hello

[1:03:12] there's no way for me to be lost
[1:03:27] [Applause]
[1:03:29] come to him in hell too
[1:03:32] unless if i was not the son of god
[1:03:34] amen amen amen
[1:03:36] hello and then
[1:03:38] i'm continuing
[1:04:11] became man
[1:04:15] that man man might become god
[1:04:18] yes
[1:04:19] a god became men

[1:04:55] took our sins upon him
[1:04:58] knowing no sins stepped under elected a
[1:05:01] person yet was a sinner but second
[1:05:03] oppression

[1:07:28] the word
[1:07:30] faith
[1:07:33] made
[1:07:34] to a human being deva empire became a
[1:07:37] kinsmen he defended he becomes a man oh
[1:08:36] but the devil could not redeem us pascal
[1:08:38] remembers the tempest because the devil
[1:08:40] himself is a sinner
[1:08:43] and he doesn't
[1:08:44] repent at all
[1:08:46] the devil does not repent at all
[1:08:53] when you see somebody who doesn't know
[1:08:54] how to ask for forgiveness
[1:08:58] there's only the devil does not repent
[1:09:00] at all
