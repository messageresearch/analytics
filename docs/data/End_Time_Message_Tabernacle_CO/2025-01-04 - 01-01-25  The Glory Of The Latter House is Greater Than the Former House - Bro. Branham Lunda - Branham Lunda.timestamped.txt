[14:48] short though I have a lot of
[14:52] things I will try to be
[14:55] short we see here in the scripture we
[14:58] just read
[15:00] Prophet a prophet AI
[15:04] talking he was speaking to
[15:07] zerel it was the time of the
[15:15] building you know God told David not to
[15:18] build the
[15:21] house because it was a bloody man in
[15:27] war he say your son Solomon will build
[15:30] the
[15:34] temple and Solomon buil wonderful
[15:39] Temple and dedicated the
[15:42] temple but it was
[15:46] destroyed when Israel went to captivity
[15:48] in the time
[15:49] of those are the things that you
[15:55] know to save time way I want to score
[15:59] against the
[16:02] devil we see when he was about to
[16:05] rebuild the Temple
[16:07] of Israel had a lot of
[16:10] trouble they had a lot of
[16:13] discouragement and that didn't almost
[16:16] work and sometime that's what happened
[16:18] to us sometime life maybe you have a
[16:21] project a
[16:24] plan it may happen that that
[16:27] fails but
[16:31] says the
[16:35] failures some time it's a part of our
[16:39] success
[16:41] says I I will be with you as I was with
[16:45] Moses he say I would rather have
[16:49] somebody that can make mistake and keep
[16:53] trying that A man that is afraid to
[16:56] tackle the problem amen amen
[17:00] failures is a part of our lives
[17:04] but but we have to learn from our
[17:10] mistakes our
[17:12] blessings our
[17:16] future does not depend of our
[17:23] failures even the future of this
[17:26] church does not depend of his past
[17:28] [Music]
[17:29] [Applause]
[17:34] God knows how he will take this church
[17:36] to
[17:36] Perfection but if we made
[17:39] mistakes we can learn from our
[17:43] mistakes to move
[17:45] forward and
[17:47] Israel there were Samaritan that will
[17:50] come and they will try to discourage the
[17:53] people but after
[17:56] that they took courage
[18:00] and you

[18:22] building as the temple that will be
[18:25] carried away as God gave the the vision
[18:27] to Moses

[23:25] anything it just s blessed Israel
[23:29] can you

[23:42] confirm to vindicate it was beyond this
[23:45] work hallelujah

[23:52] brother you have to love this pill of
[23:54] Fire or the
[23:56] cloud This Cloud
[23:59] this pill of
[24:00] fire is God
[24:05] himself in some Churches you don't have
[24:07] pictures like
[24:10] this he said he had such a pictures in
[24:13] his
[24:14] church he had it in his office
[24:20] why is God allowing himself to be
[24:23] photographed in this
[24:25] age it didn't start today

[24:31] Solomon when the glory filled the house
[24:37] listen the people were
[24:39] happy they were in
[24:41] Joy no
[24:44] remember uh later one
[24:48] day the prophet
[24:51] Jonah find himself in
[24:55] trouble in the belly of the whale
[25:01] he remembered the prayer of
[25:04] Solomon he was there in the belly of the
[25:09] Bo he didn't know where was the South
[25:11] the east and west but he just
[25:15] remembered I
[25:18] remember day when Solomon consecrated
[25:21] the temple he
[25:24] said even if the people far away
[25:28] they were not even
[25:30] Hebrews they in trouble
[25:34] somewhere and they turning toward the
[25:38] temple and they
[25:41] pray may he got answered from
[25:45] [Applause]
[25:48] heaven and Jonah was answered in the
[25:51] belly of the
[25:52] fish to
[25:55] confirm that was a great Glory
[25:59] how come the prophet will
[26:01] say the glory of the letter
[26:04] house will be greater than that one the
[26:08] for this
[26:10] night this
[26:13] year the glory that you had last
[26:18] year the glory that you're going to have
[26:20] this time will be greater
[26:23] amen if that pass
[26:25] Glory the presence of God
[26:29] will make such a
[26:31] way the priest couldn't even enter they
[26:35] even were not able to
[26:38] work and Paul is
[26:42] saying the glory to
[26:44] [Music]
[26:47] come will be greater than the former one
[26:51] amen
[26:52] amen you will
[26:54] notice Israel
[26:58] when they received Jesus
[27:02] Christ That Glory that came down in the
[27:06] temple one day Simon in
[27:09] Temple he could see that Glory but this
[27:13] time it wasn't in the form of the CL but
[27:17] it was in the form of a baby when he
[27:19] could touch the baby the
[27:22] baby was the glory
[27:26] ofina was God made
[27:29] manifest people
[27:31] forgot they did not
[27:35] understand that the god that came down
[27:37] the
[27:38] temple was no longer in the
[27:41] temple it was in the baby
[27:46] Jesus only the elect could understand it
[27:50] that is why Simon
[27:52] said mine eyes have seen the
[27:55] glory let your servant go in peace
[27:58] hallelujah
[28:00] hallelujah when that
[28:02] God died at the
[28:05] cross let me manage the
[28:13] anointing hallelujah
[28:21] hallelujah when
[28:24] Jesus when Jesus died the cross
[28:28] you know in the the Old
[28:31] Testament nobody was baptized in the
[28:33] Holy
[28:35] Ghost the Holy Ghost was in the New
[28:37] Testament amen
[28:41] amen that is why the glory of the
[28:44] letter will be greater than the for
[28:48] one because then back then was the
[28:51] physical Temple God could come down but
[28:56] now the God that was descending in the
[29:00] church now he will come down in the
[29:02] church that is you he wants to come down
[29:05] in us and when I'm
[29:08] walking it's God
[29:11] walking
[29:12] saying when a
[29:15] Christian has the Holy Spirit he's
[29:21] saying is the deity walking on the earth
[29:25] when he's
[29:26] walking his life
[29:29] will start shouting
[29:32] holy holy of the Lord of hosts
[29:36] why that
[29:39] God will enter in
[29:41] you and the glory this
[29:45] Glory will be greater than the former
[29:47] one hallelujah
[29:49] hallelujah that is why
[29:52] tonight God help us to
[29:55] understand that we are that Temple in
[29:58] this end
[30:01] time which is the temple that will have
[30:04] much
[30:05] Glory we shouldn't be remain kids
[30:08] children the say let
[30:13] work so that this glory to be manifested
[30:16] we have to
[30:18] work I'll go quickly because I could see
[30:22] people getting
[30:25] tired we have to work that's why the
[30:28] Bible saying the Bible say let's
[30:31] work so that this
[30:33] glory be
[30:35] real as the Pastor
[30:40] said what good that will do to
[30:44] us the guy that was better back
[30:48] then if it's not better
[30:52] today will serve us to have a holy
[30:55] spirit that back in the day
[30:59] change people's
[31:03] life they shout they
[31:06] spoke but their life was
[31:10] changed what good Shall Serve to us such
[31:14] a
[31:15] spirit being us that doesn't change our
[31:17] lives amen
[31:20] amen that wouldn't do us any good
[31:24] because the prophet
[31:26] says when Hebrew
[31:30] 138 Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[31:32] today and
[31:33] forever
[31:37] said it's not the literally body of the
[31:40] Lord the men the men of Galilee
[31:43] no is the same yesterday today
[31:47] forever accept his physical
[31:50] body that means the same
[31:55] yesterday based of his character
[32:00] if it change prostitute back
[32:04] then and it doesn't transform Pro today
[32:08] then it's not the
[32:09] same for him to remain the
[32:12] same the effect of the last one has to
[32:16] manifest himself today that is why
[32:20] tonight if you still
[32:24] sinner God can still give you the Holy
[32:26] Spirit
[32:31] That Glory should be in you hallelujah
[32:34] hallelujah when Jesus
[32:37] died we know
[32:40] that he went up and sent down the Holy
[32:43] Spirit
[32:47] but the holy spirit that came down the
[32:49] day of the
[32:52] Pentecost the day of the Council
[32:56] of it was released by
[33:02] denominational that why the church
[33:04] remained without
[33:05] gift there was no
[33:08] life the only thing remained was
[33:11] religion but there was no more
[33:13] life there was a scripture in Zariah
[33:16] that
[33:18] said about the evening time there shall
[33:21] be
[33:22] light there was still a scripture in Jo
[33:26] 2 that was say
[33:29] will restore that say the
[33:31] Lord everything that the
[33:35] Conqueror the the the
[33:37] the that
[33:40] destroyed my great Army will
[33:43] restore that was scriptures written
[33:49] there and the time in which those
[33:51] scriptures will
[33:52] be this is the time those scriptures
[33:55] should be fulfilled amen amen brother
[33:58] says here in this
[34:04] message the almighty God unveil before
[34:09] us you know I love I love my old
[34:13] way the paper
[34:16] book now we have a
[34:18] electronic uh
[34:20] format which is not
[34:23] wrong but I prefer this one it's better
[34:25] amen amen
[34:28] are you sleeping
[34:31] or I understand you're
[34:34] tired
[34:35] but in this time in this
[34:39] time I think you should be better
[34:43] awake better the end of the things than
[34:45] the beginning thereof is it the
[34:48] truth say glory to

[58:46] salvation are you with the
[58:49] prophet just check your

[59:09] Vine one Vine from the Devil the wicked
[59:13] one and the vine of

[1:00:18] Faith to raise you from The Mark of the
[1:00:21] earth and then I have to ask myself a
[1:00:23] question

[1:00:33] porn I'm always there trying to have bad
[1:00:38] friends now I even becoming
[1:00:41] gay I call myself I still call myself
