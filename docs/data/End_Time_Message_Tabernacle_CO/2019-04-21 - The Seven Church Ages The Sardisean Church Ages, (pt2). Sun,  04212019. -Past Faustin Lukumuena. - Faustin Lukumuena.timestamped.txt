[10:18] maybe I the name I cannot read it
[10:27] [Applause]
[10:28] so this was a we we spoke about
[10:56] different subjects
[11:01] the first service was on Wednesday even
[11:06] Nicosia where we spoke about about Jesus
[11:11] in the Garden of Gethsemane and then the
[11:17] second night was the debate or the
[11:26] second night was Jesus at before
[11:31] Caiaphas and before Pilate second unit
[11:35] is in the home Caiaphas is even polite
[11:39] he was a community we spoke about
[11:56] showing that first we had in the message
[12:12] in the message I know I'll miss as you
[12:15] see fog of 68 I'm just gonna I know 68
[12:31] it takes it's taken her up 68 he will
[12:42] just skip to where I highlighted it's
[12:47] taken its M&A and so you cannot talk
[12:56] about it in a pack if you don't talk
[12:59] about money and you don't talk about so
[13:05] to celebrate in a pack you have to come
[13:09] first
[13:26] we said that the Garden of Gethsemane
[13:29] was the place he made his final decision
[13:36] as we read in the message the communion
[13:38] paragraph 46 it was in the Garden of
[13:45] Gethsemane City does not indicate emoney
[13:47] that Jesus felt the most pain of his
[13:51] life in contact when it is envy and we
[13:55] said also that each one of us has to
[13:58] experience experiment is a propagate see
[14:03] money and when you experience it come
[14:05] with the experiment about to get some
[14:06] money you cannot blame anybody the
[14:09] public I cannot don't to point the
[14:11] finger to anybody knocks on the door
[14:13] look at Jesus he was innocent a Latino
[14:17] so he was arrested in eternity and what
[14:20] made him he's gets em any more painful
[14:25] anything gets money to try to please
[14:28] kiddos because brother but in that great
[14:37] crucial don't see CLO until he suffered
[14:43] knowing all things is meticulous Sufi
[14:46] oniisan to choose until the water and
[14:48] the blood is separated in his body he
[15:00] [Music]
[15:07] died more death in Gethsemane than he
[15:11] did on the cross so that means Calvary
[15:21] even with all the nails all the cause or
[15:24] the pain electively clue to die more in
[15:32] the Garden of Gethsemane now I want you
[15:37] to understand this unique you companies
[15:39] I see what caused his death
[15:41] in the Garden of Gethsemane more than on
[15:44] the course click on Mouse out in the
[15:47] kitchen Monique aliquot somebody can
[15:49] beat you ok came to fatty cannon nail
[15:51] you know Chloe sometimes you know the
[15:55] pain you don't feel it a default upon I
[15:57] dunno because it's already too much a
[16:00] pancetta beaucoup but the best the
[16:03] hardest death that Jesus had in the
[16:06] garden of gethsemane 2010 getting money
[16:09] it's because city comes thinking it was
[16:12] in the garden of gethsemane teams are
[16:14] dedicating money that Jesus felt he was
[16:16] betrayed by his own brother sister keep
[16:25] this in mind in sec you'll get the money
[16:28] Righetti money is when you are gonna be
[16:31] betrayed essay contest comes every ke
[16:33] and the betrayal will not come from
[16:36] somebody far
[16:45] enjoy Jesus was for second the course a
[18:24] illa llah which means my father my
[18:31] father so putting all these things
[18:35] together meant to say that was more pain
[18:38] in the garden of getting money we knew
[18:47] some people they get some witchcraft
[18:52] witchcraft they goes to steal - they
[18:58] know that if they arrest you
[19:00] hae-sun kihyun's ahead they will be - as
[19:03] some kind of witchcraft complain they
[19:08] don't fill it in some time

[19:16] are gonna die more on the course feels
[19:21] really the Bride of Christ when is the
[19:38] following Christ a key sweet crystal
[19:40] must also experience we wanted to see
[19:43] show you see so from that we move to the
[19:46] next night talking about Jesus before
[19:53] first he went before Caiaphas and then
[19:58] before Pilate Pilate and we say that
[20:02] pilot in the pillar is the governor say
[20:06] something to save that man vacations
[20:08] over Satan but instead nimoy he took the
[20:13] water in a pillow to wash his and then
[20:17] we said in the blood of Jesus listen
[20:20] disease because when he washes up on us
[20:36] don't you know not only upon myself as
[20:39] you know on our to see that's why every

[21:28] the last Church not hot Oh Pasha no cold
[21:41] neutral neutral Network that's the
[21:47] position of opposition de la DC so that
[21:51] was the second night it was Jesus
[21:57] crucified he and then we saw the
[22:02] crucifixion on Friday night and now I
[22:09] have a question we said that Jesus died
[22:13] on Friday is that three days hey Joe
[22:29] I'm just asking he died Friday 3:00 p.m.
[22:35] yeah cancel but Sunday morning he
[22:40] resurrected material ethnicity by the
[22:43] VA's ICU just doing this question came
[22:47] for three days and three nights
[22:54] is that why you were 20
[23:32] did not even come to Sunday to start
[24:12] this morning it was early one morning
[24:32] they kept his body in the ground over
[24:35] the Sabbat a song called on his soul
[24:39] which was a customary that they wish but
[24:44] I cannot follow you they didn't do
[24:51] anything on this Sabbath so he died
[24:57] Friday afternoon at 3 o clock a limo in
[25:00] front so I can say and hose up real
[25:03] early Sunday morning my turn no no I
[25:08] want to settle this question I tell you
[25:11] that you know why you are here this
[25:13] morning in this sunrise service
[25:15] Pinocchio said you see my service
[25:17] deliberately many people says this on
[25:20] diesel
[25:21] how comes then that he said that he
[25:25] would he was in the grave in the common
[25:28] pleas of disability don't that tombow
[25:31] three days and three nights
[25:33] why should convey what I'm saying gee he
[25:36] never said he will do that I didn't as a
[25:38] medical explanation he said within these
[25:43] three days what is it well will I raise
[25:47] up my body system uncle
[25:50] now the reason he did that is because
[25:54] deputy said the kid Nevada region one
[25:57] place in the scripture I will not leave
[26:01] his soul in hell his soul in Hell
[26:08] neither will I suffer my Holy One to see
[26:12] corruption support emotions of
[26:14] corruption and he knew that corruption
[26:17] is a regular cohesion set in human body
[26:20] after 72 hours it's a regular
[26:22] coefficient of Italy comea precept on
[26:24] these three days and night when we and
[26:27] sometime it within that three days and
[26:34] night the sequential economy God was
[26:38] going to raise him up a Jew Davila
[26:40] necessity so he died on Friday afternoon
[26:44] in silly moment register at 3 o clock at
[26:47] congeal and rose up early Sunday morning
[26:50] thank you madam amen
[27:00] so that all they think we our Easter
[27:05] service and we thank God for it
[27:12] in unison opposition and we said on the
[27:15] third day and I want you to enjoy Jesus
[27:19] on Calvary gzo kasnia why did he die on
[27:23] Calvary did you know what was the
[27:27] purpose equally beat Jesus in dying in
[27:32] on Calvary she was showing us one lesson
[27:38] Stepan's upon doin lesson that Cal what
[27:41] anyway what is the meaning of Calvary
[27:43] because we cannot just rejoice for he
[27:45] died on Calvary we must have a personal
[27:52] revelation we said that Calvary men
[27:59] continue to live for others Jesus life
[28:06] going to Calvary the village is a alone
[28:09] Calva was not for himself apollomon it
[28:12] was for you and he put a puma he bought
[28:15] myself a lobotomy Faldo all my lies all
[28:19] my iniquities he took all of this in a
[28:25] plea to Cena so that he can open up a
[28:27] way for you and I to be saved in value
[28:30] that was of it God why that day on
[28:33] Calvary when he died only more this son
[28:42] the creation shame to see the Creator
[28:46] naked on Diwali 80 on youth and the
[28:51] rocks from the mountain was in pieces in
[28:54] addition a on day and the veil of the
[28:57] temple was opened yet only disunity
[29:00] showing that you have now free access if
[29:06] you are not safe if it's your own wheel
[29:10] blood when Jesus died on Calvary
[29:13] bail was open negative to show that that
[29:16] Holy of Holies where in the past only
[29:22] the high priest could access open silly
[29:25] Somali civil insanity a vaccine and when
[29:27] the high priest was going in that place
[29:30] in Sacramento they had a cord attached
[29:33] to his leg ASAP because if he died
[29:38] nobody can go there - they will just
[29:43] move this the code athina and if they
[29:47] see him moving unify a boozy the
[29:50] congregation were happy confuse
[29:52] interceding for my when they move me :
[29:56] bujji no action connection he's dead
[29:59] anymore they will just put would have
[30:11] been in the fight in the face of the law
[30:15] it event go to the University senior so
[30:19] and the high priest would Molly into
[30:21] there once a year
[30:23] Salman cases in for felony but since
[30:27] that day on Calvary positional calcium
[30:29] we don't have annual remission of your
[30:35] sins if you only see single patient just
[30:44] to go fix it that's why would they don't
[30:47] bring the lamp anymore I mean Phil I
[30:50] knew because Jesus was the perfect
[30:53] landscape in a new town faith the only
[30:55] thing to do less anxious affair is to
[30:57] accept I mean so since that day in the
[31:02] position they fail being open let me do
[31:05] that brother you have access to you
[31:12] don't need high priests to take your
[31:15] sins and go over experiment fishy og in
[31:22] the Old Testament going in there Antonia
[31:26] was deaf
[31:28] today so each one of us so there is
[32:10] knowledge sometimes you have to
[32:46] sacrifice yourself in certain mother may
[32:54] but you accepted laxity just for the
[32:57] sake of somebody maybe weak just pull a
[33:00] cold not when some poetry fabulous
[33:01] because if we have to fight the veil was
[33:09] open
[33:11] so that we can follow him I think you
[33:13] know personally see that was the meaning
[33:15] of Calvary so that we can follow
[33:18] efficiently Steve and Christ dying on
[33:21] Calvary he showed us a way that we have
[33:29] to live for others in the pool is not
[33:32] living for not to live for those who are
[33:40] doing wrong to you
[33:41] pues aquí who fed you mal but you are
[33:43] living for those who hurt you no
[33:48] confetti mal that's what Christianity I
[33:54] mean not living for my own any
[33:57] particular Pullman pop but living for
[33:59] others even policing because if Jesus
[34:01] was that low that much selfish impulses
[34:04] a desicion attend you go selfish we
[34:09] could not be saved me so he sacrificed
[34:12] his life and I sacrifice my V so that
[34:15] you can leave I think you appreciate
[34:16] this one
[34:17] amen so you to lose you see you have to
[34:22] learn how to sacrifice your life for
[34:24] somebody to give us a key vodka via
[34:27] Pookie not concern vivo that's why can
[34:34] you find that code living for others not
[34:38] to live for those who do good unto you
[34:41] the privacy of the confetti
[34:43] bunches you buddy to live for especially
[34:46] those who hate you
[34:47] maybe if my special mapaseka was a
[34:49] Haitian and we said that what eternal
[34:51] life is alleged to have eternal eternal
[34:54] life the eternal is to live for
[34:56] Liverpool Azad don't be too selfish in
[35:00] Etobicoke hit Jesus if Jesus could be
[35:03] selfish just a little bit cheaper
[35:05] veggies infinitely great you could not
[35:09] be saved
[35:10] it was in the message that they want
[35:12] Carver go a little bit someone said how
[35:22] can you stand and let anybody call you
[35:24] such bad names ok Kennedy community wish
[35:27] I can see the jobs a brilliant L know
[35:29] that L know you don't live for yourself

[35:40] veneer ism and the trouble of it is is
[35:43] it hoobly the church has forgotten they
[35:46] were sons this outbreak is a dead
[35:48] official you are sons visit the feast
[35:51] you are taking Christ place
[35:53] we need a plastic priest you are sons at
[35:56] the feast so don't live for yourself
[35:58] alone evil men live for others result
[36:02] well brother branham wealth Capernaum I
[36:06] can live for this brother a GP

[36:31] a second theology they killed him on you
[36:33] at you and he died that we might save
[36:36] Thank You pesetas Pookie jump aside
[36:38] cassava that's when you get that's in
[36:43] your bosom Adam focus on you are facing
[36:45] heaven then objet Faisal CL but you
[36:49] sacrifice your own things to fill up
[36:51] openSUSE give them up like the Sheep
[36:54] gives its lool a donate to silicon you
[37:02] look on toward Culver mechanical valve
[37:05] so that's eternal life society needs to
[37:08] live for somebody somebody who does good
[37:11] to you like a king q50 if somebody does
[37:13] good to you and Jesus was those people
[37:22] who hated to see key lies they spilled
[37:25] on his own conscience who they beat him
[37:27] they criticized Jesus said Father
[37:31] forgive no bitterness in the penalty
[37:36] no fighting back pass the baton on
[37:39] jealousy but I shall see not if
[37:40] self-defense I'm a pain self-defense no
[37:43] no Jesus said major Zod this is what
[37:46] that day on Calvary is a key to local
[37:49] ignition if the church ceremony please
[37:52] they believer the quail can have eternal
[37:54] life eternal
[37:56] we will not see all the bite biting back
[38:01] that's why I'm doing this exalt
[38:04] themselves so much is exact
[38:45] if we are actions when they ask listen
[39:28] to the accusation it could Leo's
[39:29] accusation kalmo sometimes that wisdom
[39:36] is just quiet
[39:40] they say that you said it you are God Oh
[39:42] nad cubes that g-shot also uncouth my
[39:45] point you said it Lavie did being called
[39:50] names let this Easter I mean that's
[40:09] Christianity and select facility so as
[40:12] we started last Sunday on the seven ages
[40:18] we are going to
[40:20] with the seven churches age 50
[40:29] Thank You mr. should be every day wait
[40:50] until when the world declared this day
[41:02] that took Jesus out of the grave if it's
[41:08] it will take you also out of the
[41:12] nomination out of your out of your
[41:17] tradition to follow crystal I think I
[41:26] will not be longer since some people
[41:28] were here since a long time we are in
[41:37] the book of Revelation chapter 3 we are
[41:43] just going to read the first two verses
[41:45] and for title I will speak on the seven
[41:54] spirits of God and the Seven Stars and
[42:02] unto the Angel of the church in Sardis
[42:05] write these things said he that as the
[42:09] seven spirit not is capital S the seven
[42:17] spirits of God and the Seven Stars I
[42:20] know thy works that thou has a name that
[42:24] thou leave us and our dead
[42:59] but those who have diversion invisible
[43:04] they said a Cree a large delegate the
[43:07] title was his second D v de jure Silvia
[43:13] Oh sod sorry for C second e silica ELISA
[43:22] test we did you ele set at one je
[43:25] connais deserve
[43:26] Jessica Terry Pascoe at Aviva atrium or
[43:30] you will notice those who have ELISA go
[43:36] the translation is different in English
[43:43] it says I know thy works and that thou
[43:49] has a name that our livers and our dead
[43:54] a name that you live but you are dead
[44:00] yeah but that better predict our
[44:03] translation but those weevil Rhys ago
[44:06] the word name is not in the Bible I want
[44:13] you to notice that it so you can be
[44:15] small things but it is a very meaningful
[44:20] because as we continue to thank you
[44:23] brother we continue to preach you will
[44:26] see we will put a lot of emphasis on the
[44:29] word name and when you have your own
[44:34] research on Bible you will not see the
[44:37] word name because they they have a name
[44:42] that they are they leave us but they are
[44:44] dead be watchful and strengthen the
[44:50] things which remain they are ready to
[44:53] die for I have not found thy works
[44:56] perfect before God amen
[45:07] may the Lord are the blessing to the
[45:09] reading of the scripture so I will
[45:13] certainly continue with the seven church
[45:15] ages but I will make a bridge to touch
[45:20] also some aspect of Easter this way we
[45:29] get all the two parts so in the message
[45:34] this audition church age fog of
[45:39] twenty-eight when brother Bonham preach
[45:42] it it was ended at night say now tonight
[45:46] we are beginning on the fifth church age
[45:51] which is the church age of Saudis and
[45:56] that church age began in 1520 and ended
[46:00] in 1750 and that age of what we call
[46:10] Reformation age so the fifth church age
[46:17] if you can recall what we wanted to
[46:22] those are the seven church ages
[46:27] before that it was the Pentecost when
[46:32] Jesus was crucified and he was ascended
[46:39] to heaven he sent down the holy spirit
[46:44] this holy spirit that came on the day of
[46:47] Pentecost started the church ages for
[46:51] the Gentile so from the first the first
[46:56] to church ages where they aged the
[47:00] missionary age to reach out to people
[47:04] with the fire of the Pentecost the next
[47:09] two edges where the Dark Age this is
[47:14] where the Catholic Church was created
[47:16] and many Christian also were killed but
[47:22] when we come to the fifth church age
[47:24] which is where we start studies and the
[47:29] next church age those are the edges of
[47:33] Reformation and the following will be a
[47:39] prophetic age with the full restoration
[47:45] so here we are talking about a 50 church
[47:48] age with Luther as the messenger and we
[47:57] according to the Bible the seven church
[48:01] ages
[48:02] teaching is a great mystery because the
[48:10] forum the book of Revelation chapter 1
[48:13] verse 20 you know you read the book of
[48:18] Revelation it's talking about mystery
[48:21] mystery mystery but the mystery must be
[48:24] unfold the mystery of the Seven Stars
[48:29] which thou sawest in my right hand
[48:36] when talking about the right and is the
[48:38] mighty power of God and a seven golden
[48:44] candlesticks the seven stars are the
[48:49] angels of the seven churches so that
[48:55] means every church age as a star and a
[49:01] star is a messenger so according to the
[49:05] Bible the period of the Gentile is
[49:10] divided in seven Church ages number
[49:15] seven which is which is the fulfillment
[49:18] all of the plan so all the time given to
[49:22] the Gentile in a seven period and for
[49:28] each period they add a star and these
[49:33] seven stars are the angels of the seven
[49:36] churches so that means every church age
[49:42] they add a messenger somebody who
[49:46] received a message from God to give to
[49:50] the people
[49:52] that's why the Bible said the mystery of
[49:55] the Seven Stars the seven messengers or
[50:01] the seven stars is a mystery why a
[50:06] mystery a mystery is something that is
[50:09] written in the Bible where a
[50:12] supernatural element is attached to
[50:16] despite the revelation that is given
[50:20] they can tell you this is what it is
[50:24] there is a still a supernatural element
[50:28] that requires God to come and reveal to
[50:31] you this is how God is known God is not
[50:38] known intellectually God is not by
[50:41] revelation
[50:43] that's why Jesus there Holly's ministry
[50:47] even though he was with the disciples
[50:49] one day he was looking at them those
[50:53] people are good they attended church but
[50:57] I don't know if they have the revelation
[51:00] of what coming to church me therefore he
[51:05] said one day what do you say I am
[51:11] question this one said oh you are
[51:15] Jeremiah because they think we are
[51:17] talking like Jeremiah are you are Isaiah
[51:23] because it's a fulfillment of the
[51:25] prophecy of Isaiah somebody said you are
[51:29] one of the Prophet Jesus said no you are
[51:34] just guessing
[51:39] till one day I have to preach a message
[51:41] why Peter when it said the group of the
[51:49] people the disciple it's always a Pete
[51:54] always a Peter to deny Peter the keys
[52:00] Peter why Peter to yourself why Peter
[52:13] so Peter didn't read what you say
[52:16] always the Peter Peter said you are
[52:20] Christ the Son of the Living God
[52:24] hallelujah jesus said what you say
[52:29] perfect
[52:31] it's not the blood or the flesh or
[52:38] seminary or hitting books and tapes
[52:44] even total things are good but the
[52:47] revelation don't come that way it's
[52:51] coming from my father
[52:53] therefore Peter I will build my church
[52:59] upon that all the Catholics and Peter is
[53:05] the first pope but let me tell you Peter
[53:10] according to history Peter never been to
[53:13] work number two
[53:15] Peter was a married man if you read the
[53:20] Bible Jesus pray for the poor Peter
[53:23] Madison no but you st. Peters of the
[53:27] first pub non pub is married so that you
[53:32] miss it
[53:33] what religious I said I build my church
[53:37] upon that revelation that PETA ad of
[53:42] womb Jesus worse damage the church is
[53:47] built upon the revelation of who Jesus
[53:52] is amen
[53:55] not the revelation of a pop or a prophet
[54:00] no the revelation of who Jesus is and
[54:05] then Jesus said once that church is
[54:09] built upon that revelation the gates of
[54:14] Hell will never prevail what does it
[54:19] mean that means the gate of hell will
[54:23] fight that revelation of who Jesus is
[54:27] that's why you see in many churches they
[54:32] try to substitute the center of Jesus to
[54:39] put somebody else where ever I am told
[54:42] us
[54:44] all the revelation that latest
[54:47] revelation is the supreme deity of the
[54:52] Lord Jesus Christ because that the
[54:55] foundation of the church you can put the
[54:58] seven seals you which whatever you want
[55:01] but if in your revelation Jesus Christ
[55:06] deity Iza neglected that revelation is
[55:12] wrong
[55:14] amen so that's where the church was
[55:17] founded amen and Peter was an apostle
[55:27] peter was a prophet
[55:30] that's why the Bible said we are built
[55:39] upon the foundation of apostles and
[55:47] prophets so prophet and apostle that's
[55:55] our foundation amen so we see here as we
[56:03] read a mystery revelation 1:20 this is
[56:09] the mystery the seven stars that means
[56:14] the seven messenger it's a mystery
[56:18] I always challenge anybody any Bible
[56:23] scholar you can say you know the Bible
[56:27] but when I give you revelation 1:20 the
[56:32] mystery of the seven star the seven star
[56:36] the seven stars are the angels what are
[56:40] the angel the angel are messengers that
[56:44] means every church age
[56:46] on the top we have the seven church
[56:50] edges on the top we have this top seven
[56:55] Church ages seven messenger that means
[56:59] every church age as its own messenger I
[57:04] have heard many preachers from any
[57:08] denomination I never heard one trying to
[57:13] tell the people the first star is a porn
[57:19] the second is so-and-so no they don't
[57:23] touch it
[57:24] why it's a mystery but we thank God
[57:29] because revelation 10 at the voice of
[57:34] the seventh angel when he will start
[57:37] sounding all the mystery what is the
[57:42] mystery nice the mystery of God revealed
[57:47] when Christ will come and a seven angel
[57:51] begin to sound all the mystery will be
[57:55] unfolded and I challenge any prophet I
[57:59] any minister to give me the name
[58:02] according to him and we will take the
[58:06] name we will go check eastery if you
[58:10] come with Saint Patrick I will tell you
[58:13] now San Martin was better you can with
[58:17] Polly cup or we say no he was leaning a
[58:21] little bit more to what denomination
[58:24] amen only the Holy Ghost came in william
[58:29] branham ministry to show him the first
[58:34] messenger is the paul ii stirred etc so
[58:44] all the messengers after Paul they must
[58:49] be dragged upon
[58:51] that's why Paul the first messenger he
[58:55] was courageous by centering the people
[58:59] the gospel I preached I'm not the shame
[59:03] of it if an angel from heaven come and
[59:09] say something contrary let him be
[59:13] accursed
[59:14] whether you better know who you are Amen
[59:18] if there is another ministry they give
[59:23] them mystery name you say or maybe the
[59:27] first messenger was Peter Peter was to
[59:32] the Jews back to the Gentile in support
[59:38] amen and a policy you know even the big
[59:42] part was never with Jesus but the Peter
[59:49] he was with Jesus he Jesus experienced
[59:53] that's why I don't care or I was with a
[59:57] brother branham it's a good experience
[59:59] but what is your present tense
[1:00:01] hallelujah we want to see your
[1:00:04] experience today
[1:00:05] oh brother when I or brother you know
[1:00:07] when I was in the tabernacle whatever
[1:00:10] when I'm told me something special told
[1:00:14] me something special that's you I don't
[1:00:19] care for me he said what is on the tapes
[1:00:24] what he told you special is your
[1:00:28] speciality amen
[1:00:31] so Paul said if an angel come and preach
[1:00:36] something different let him be accursed
[1:00:40] amen
[1:00:41] so Paul knew what he was speaking and in
[1:00:46] the book of Acts Paul said I know after
[1:00:50] me qu and wolf will come
[1:00:55] and that's why we've seen the history
[1:00:58] after poll in the Pergamon church age
[1:01:03] the accrual wolf came 325 the Nicene
[1:01:09] council they gathered they crucify the
[1:01:13] world and that start a duck age but from
[1:01:21] the fifty-eight we see the reform study
[1:01:27] amen so the same important from this
[1:01:33] first messenger must follow the rest of
[1:01:37] the messengers so every messenger that
[1:01:42] anybody will appoint make sure you line
[1:01:46] up with a pole amen
[1:01:49] pull open the aged in the last days
[1:01:54] there should be only another star we
[1:01:58] will close the edge and in order to know
[1:02:02] him look at the pattern of Paul Paul was
[1:02:07] a sinner trying to persecute the
[1:02:10] believer but one day on his way to
[1:02:15] Damascus he made a pillar fire so if you
[1:02:21] say you are the last messenger so as the
[1:02:25] purifier
[1:02:28] [Music]
[1:02:30] not your so-called pillow fire but the
[1:02:35] pillow fire that will be certified by
[1:02:41] the FBI
[1:02:45] lesyk George came he studied a picture
[1:02:50] that was taken in 1950 with the bureau
[1:02:55] fire they studied they say it's genuine
[1:03:00] amen so the last messenger must be like
[1:03:05] Paul Paul open the aged and a last
[1:03:12] messenger after close the edges amen
[1:03:20] Paul and a pillow fire the last
[1:03:24] messenger we must see also the pillow
[1:03:28] fire Paul said the gospel I preached I
[1:03:33] did not study it in seminary even though
[1:03:38] Paul was a student of Gamaliel Paul
[1:03:44] tonight is teaching of Gamaliel he said
[1:03:48] what I'm teaching I receive it from God
[1:03:52] the last messenger said I never went to
[1:03:57] school all that I'm teaching from the
[1:04:02] Holy Ghost amen
[1:04:05] Paul said even an angel come don't
[1:04:11] listen to him
[1:04:13] the last messenger came repeat what is
[1:04:17] on the table because I preach like Paul
[1:04:24] so if you bring me a name of a messenger
[1:04:28] I will not have any problem but I have
[1:04:32] to listen to everything that many said
[1:04:34] until I will hear that we push like you
[1:04:38] pork now if we can hear her and say I
[1:04:44] also put drag Paul we will say what is
[1:04:47] your vision because of Branham who pitch
[1:04:53] like a pole there was a vision we are
[1:04:58] resting on that a man shall the people
[1:05:06] from the edge of Paul be judged if they
[1:05:11] will be mine also will be because I
[1:05:16] preach like Paul and there was a
[1:05:18] multitude and they say are they all the
[1:05:21] banner oh no they are your converts
[1:05:26] their people who believe your message
[1:05:29] Amen that the people that will be
[1:05:32] gathering somewhere blessed be the name
[1:05:36] of the Lord so the spirit of the message
[1:05:40] that's what we are hitting here in the
[1:05:43] Bible do you think first verse one verse
[1:05:50] chapter three and the angel and unto the
[1:05:55] Angel of the church in Sardis you see
[1:06:01] the even the scripture when there is a
[1:06:05] letter written to the age it's singular
[1:06:10] I'm to the angel one person singular
[1:06:16] angel not to the Angels Oh John also
[1:06:20] Andrew Oh pastor to ensure no no no no
[1:06:24] no no the Bible is clear one angel you
[1:06:28] better find that angel and in order to
[1:06:31] find that angel you go to revelation
[1:06:33] 1:20
[1:06:35] to unfold that mystery amen
[1:06:39] but we thank God because he came himself
[1:06:42] he revealed that mystery he clearly said
[1:06:46] whether he was not ashamed he said
[1:06:51] clearly first messenger Paul I Venice
[1:06:56] Martin :
[1:06:59] Luther Wesley and me amen he was not
[1:07:07] ashamed now you show me somebody
[1:07:11] he made Clem he's a messenger
[1:07:14] this is the real messenger let him give
[1:07:18] the names but don't copy the name and
[1:07:23] tell us how you see because the one I'm
[1:07:27] speaking of when he was preaching had
[1:07:33] himself the angel came and wore the same
[1:07:36] picture what a supernatural vindication
[1:07:42] blessed be the name of the Lord so the
[1:07:46] seven Spirit of God the Bible said he
[1:07:52] that had the seven spirits of God and
[1:07:56] the Seven Stars now what are the seven
[1:08:00] spirits of God what are the seven Spirit
[1:08:04] of God that means God has a seven spirit
[1:08:08] let me tell you what the Bible said what
[1:08:12] he says because at the opening of every
[1:08:15] age Christ introduces himself so here in
[1:08:21] the age of Saudis he introduced himself
[1:08:25] as the one who has the seven spirits of
[1:08:30] God and the Seven Stars who had the
[1:08:35] seven Spirit of God and the Seven Stars
[1:08:39] what are the seven spirits the seven
[1:08:43] spirit are all Irina's
[1:08:48] that the sever Spirit of God in other
[1:08:51] words it's the same Holy Spirit that God
[1:08:57] has given to the church ages will take
[1:09:06] the message here in the Saudi a sedition
[1:09:27] church age paragraph 73 now from the
[1:09:35] salute of the church age of Ephesus or
[1:09:38] Saudis we are going to read this further
[1:09:46] 73 now the salute yes
[1:09:52] now they salute now the seven spirits
[1:09:57] are the seven spirit and notice the
[1:10:03] spirit is always capital S and the seven
[1:10:09] stars seven stars there is no capital S
[1:10:13] in the stars that earthly stars Paul
[1:10:22] Iranians etc but a seven spirit that was
[1:10:27] put into the seven stars those the seven
[1:10:32] spirits are the Holy Spirit of God and
[1:10:37] Branham said their spirits was the
[1:10:42] angels that went to the star which were
[1:10:46] messengers
[1:10:50] seven spirits 7ty are seven different
[1:10:55] times their holy spirit would anoint a
[1:11:00] messenger which was a star in his day so
[1:11:09] do you understand the seven spirit it's
[1:11:13] the seven times that the Holy Spirit has
[1:11:17] anointed a vessel on the earth with the
[1:11:23] same spirit that fall on the day of
[1:11:27] Pentecost and start the world in the
[1:11:30] pole this is how God in salute the
[1:11:34] Church of Sardis a spirit is eternal and
[1:11:40] a star that was made for a purpose to
[1:11:46] reflect light in the dark of this church
[1:11:51] edges where candles and stars are
[1:11:58] representing the angel the spirit was
[1:12:08] the one that went to be star and
[1:12:12] reflected the light of the holy spirit
[1:12:15] through his daddy sister to that church
[1:12:19] age then you wonder who the seven
[1:12:27] spirits are as we read in the Bible
[1:12:32] those seven spirit what are the seven
[1:12:35] spirits it's the seven messengers
[1:12:40] of the seven church ages see and each
[1:12:46] time that the stock came in on the scene
[1:12:52] the Holy Spirit came down and anointed
[1:12:58] that star and kept it just exactly like
[1:13:03] the first one was that means the
[1:13:09] subsequent messengers must be lined up
[1:13:13] with the spirit that was on Paul the
[1:13:17] same spirit that fall on the day of
[1:13:19] Pentecost amen
[1:13:24] now let me confirm that to you Paul said
[1:13:29] if you want to know what kind of a star
[1:13:31] it was because remember Satan is a star
[1:13:39] to Satan as his messengers sent an
[1:13:45] unwanted show is the people that's why
[1:13:49] you see some people you can really
[1:13:52] discern this is not the normal thinking
[1:13:54] this is not the Spirit of God
[1:13:57] this is not the Spirit of Christ it's a
[1:14:00] spirit of center how do you know Jesus
[1:14:04] said by his food when you see too much
[1:14:08] bitterness too much anger too much
[1:14:12] jealousy you know I tell none writings
[1:14:15] but when you see the spirit was upon
[1:14:18] Paul upon Brennan he said over there
[1:14:24] only perfect love will enter no
[1:14:29] bitterness watches regardless of what
[1:14:33] somebody has done to you you have no
[1:14:36] right to the root of bitterness
[1:14:40] unless you are from the seed of K men so
[1:14:48] now notice Paul who believed he was a
[1:14:52] star to the Ephesus church he said if
[1:15:00] you want to know whether is - or not
[1:15:03] in relation 1:8 Paul said speaking there
[1:15:09] that after the time would come and gave
[1:15:14] us worlds and so forth if an angel come
[1:15:19] down from heaven and touched any other
[1:15:23] gospel regardless from which
[1:15:26] denomination he came from
[1:15:29] regardless which level of education he
[1:15:32] has if he preaches something different
[1:15:37] than Paul preached let him be accursed
[1:15:42] and Branum in the last days with the
[1:15:48] biggest question of marriage and divorce
[1:15:52] because when you read a Bible the Bible
[1:15:56] said a man and a woman should be married
[1:16:01] only once you cannot get married if you
[1:16:09] have a living spouse if you want I can
[1:16:16] give you the scripture rather give me
[1:16:18] Luke Luke chapter 16 verse 18 the Bible
[1:16:25] said whosoever look 1618
[1:16:39] David is not there no he's nobody there
[1:16:42] so open your Bible brothers in the look
[1:16:49] chapter 16 the Bible said verse 18
[1:17:06] whosoever put us away his wife and
[1:17:11] married another committed adultery
[1:17:17] that's the Bible and Apollo said nobody
[1:17:22] can add nobody can take away even if an
[1:17:28] angel come from heaven he cannot change
[1:17:31] this we should ever put away his wife
[1:17:35] and marry another one committed adultery
[1:17:41] whosoever married her that he put away
[1:17:49] from her husband committed adultery
[1:17:53] that means you marry somebody you are
[1:17:58] living in adultery and no adulterous
[1:18:01] person can ever eternal life that was
[1:18:05] the Bible there is no way around so with
[1:18:10] this the world was found in a condition
[1:18:13] of disgrace because of their false
[1:18:20] teaching we have found men married many
[1:18:23] times even women many times
[1:18:27] so therefore heaven door was closed Paul
[1:18:34] it comes in first Corinthians chapter 7
[1:18:38] Paul said now it's me not the Lord
[1:18:44] hallelujah oh you will say oh brother we
[1:18:48] have to stay with the Bible a messenger
[1:18:52] get authority from the one who send him
[1:18:58] policy now it's not the Lord it's me if
[1:19:04] you are married with somebody and you
[1:19:08] are satisfied continue away let all the
[1:19:14] bottom comes oh I have a lot of friends
[1:19:18] they come to me asking me brother
[1:19:22] Branham we heard your sermon what shall
[1:19:25] we do
[1:19:25] what a bang Brian who was going to the
[1:19:29] tapes he said I'm ready to separate with
[1:19:33] my wife when I said wait until that
[1:19:38] angel the same angel who gave me the
[1:19:42] Commission when he will tell me then I
[1:19:45] will tell you when I'm a witch
[1:19:47] when I'm rich since 1933 I don't know
[1:19:51] but now knowing that his time is up
[1:19:56] February 21st 1965 he said now I'm going
[1:20:03] to preach on the question of marriage
[1:20:06] and divorce
[1:20:07] you listen to this and pay attention
[1:20:11] because of the same cloud that descended
[1:20:16] into shock they not told me to tell you
[1:20:20] stay where you are you are forgiven go
[1:20:24] your way if you are happy raise your
[1:20:27] children but tell your children never to
[1:20:31] do such a thing
[1:20:33] amen who's that man he said Moses
[1:20:38] address the question of marriage and
[1:20:40] divorce that's what they said Jesus what
[1:20:45] do you think Moses talked about the
[1:20:48] divorce letter what do you say Jesus
[1:20:51] said whosoever will put away his wife
[1:20:56] and take another or the case of Moses
[1:21:00] was even better Paul okay we talked to
[1:21:04] you about the last group that's why I
[1:21:08] said show me another star will come to
[1:21:14] give a message to the people about what
[1:21:17] they have done therefore this is a
[1:21:20] message of grace God has forgiven you go
[1:21:24] to the way you are now you have the
[1:21:29] knowledge regardless of what the men do
[1:21:32] regardless of the wife does there is no
[1:21:36] divorce we don't believe in divorce
[1:21:39] amen if you divorce
[1:21:42] stay like that there is no grace coming
[1:21:46] because there is no other messenger
[1:21:48] after oh you should love the Lord for
[1:21:55] the forgiveness he look at your
[1:21:58] condition according to what was written
[1:22:01] in the book of look many people were
[1:22:05] excluded but for this age God is
[1:22:10] descended given forgiveness for our
[1:22:14] benefit therefore you the children
[1:22:17] before you get married make sure because
[1:22:22] you know in the marriage vow when they
[1:22:26] marry the people I marry you for good
[1:22:32] and worse when we see worse that's what
[1:22:40] you promise before God my worse is worse
[1:22:46] no goddamn you and you have to stick
[1:22:50] with it not only that only death we
[1:22:55] shall be departed that means if you
[1:22:59] decide to depart before death you have
[1:23:03] no right to remain because you said
[1:23:09] before God and before the people only
[1:23:13] death so you have to wait until the
[1:23:19] other person die if the person has a
[1:23:22] longer life you have a longer try let us
[1:23:30] put it that way
[1:23:33] amen because before God even since the
[1:23:37] Garden of Eden he created female and
[1:23:41] male God doesn't permit divorce divorce
[1:23:52] is name of the devil that's why the
[1:23:57] young people before you get married make
[1:24:01] sure you know what you are doing if you
[1:24:05] are not sure wait
[1:24:07] don't let the pressure of the flesh and
[1:24:10] guide you you go with the pressure of
[1:24:14] the flesh you will get married just to
[1:24:18] have some pleasures tomorrow you are
[1:24:22] gonna hate that woman
[1:24:25] you are gonna hate that man and we will
[1:24:28] start looking around but in your
[1:24:31] marriage vows when you say for good and
[1:24:35] worse in the sickness in good health in
[1:24:39] hitches in poverty that was your vows
[1:24:44] Amen so if the men become poor you have
[1:24:50] to stay oh Jesus
[1:24:53] social
[1:24:55] unless in your vow you said only death
[1:25:00] and sorcery
[1:25:02] then we will if you did not say it then
[1:25:08] you cannot bring a new white light this
[1:25:12] is to tell the young people to think
[1:25:16] twice before you go because it's like
[1:25:22] what you see on the highway one way you
[1:25:27] go just this way if you take another
[1:25:31] opposite direction you will be killed
[1:25:35] right away because all the car will meet
[1:25:38] you and your car will be smashed because
[1:25:44] it's a one-way marriage is one way the
[1:25:52] Bible said in the book of Proverbs 2025
[1:26:00] David Webb 2025 the Bible said it's a
[1:26:08] snare so don't just be oh I'm gonna get
[1:26:12] married the person doesn't want me to
[1:26:15] get married maybe the bus is trying to
[1:26:19] help you knowing what is before you when
[1:26:26] the purpose of love this friend I have
[1:26:28] no explanation I just say no because
[1:26:33] it's a snare the Bible said it is a
[1:26:36] snare to the man who devoured that which
[1:26:41] is holy marriage is holy and after vows
[1:26:51] to make inquiry people started thinking
[1:26:55] after they make the vow think before you
[1:27:01] make the vow
[1:27:05] sometimes people go with high-speed they
[1:27:08] say okay everything is fine you can talk
[1:27:12] they talk today they took the second
[1:27:15] their first talk is to break the ice the
[1:27:27] ice soon break broken the ice is the
[1:27:32] broken then they take the high speed
[1:27:35] train within a month I think we will
[1:27:42] have six children conversation shift
[1:27:47] talking about children and they get into
[1:27:51] sex that's how you don't see you don't
[1:27:56] know the person but you are influenced
[1:28:00] by the person sex that's what we see a
[1:28:05] lot of young sister today they make a
[1:28:09] lot of statement brother they don't know
[1:28:12] how to talk which is sometimes - they go
[1:28:17] to talk even partly monotony always how
[1:28:22] are you doing what did you eat what did
[1:28:26] you cook he come another day god bless
[1:28:30] you what did you cook what do you eat
[1:28:32] they go how they can like you even if
[1:28:36] their sister had a good disposition to
[1:28:42] do if they cook and I need somebody know
[1:28:49] how to talk look at you I like your
[1:28:53] outfit when you are in this very well
[1:29:02] when God was creating when he came to
[1:29:06] you six hour overtime
[1:29:10] to shape you that's what they like
[1:29:15] whether you have to know how to talk a
[1:29:24] superficial conversation all the time
[1:29:28] when you go talk you are not going to
[1:29:31] preach you know we are in the c57 church
[1:29:36] is that from when and where because they
[1:29:39] say that the husband is the husband of
[1:29:41] the church you start asking the question
[1:29:46] to you no no the wife will say no talk
[1:29:51] what is your vision of me I'm gonna buy
[1:29:57] all over for you that's what they want
[1:30:00] to listen you know I have a 800 score of
[1:30:05] credit that means I can buy over for me
[1:30:14] as I will marry you your labor is going
[1:30:18] to finish I cannot accept you to work
[1:30:22] the way you are working I will take more
[1:30:33] than that not only your knee dad your
[1:30:38] mom your siblings they will go to
[1:30:41] Harvard University hallelujah that's
[1:30:45] what they want to hear even if it's a
[1:30:48] lie and I'm telling you those who are
[1:30:51] successful are those who know how to lie
[1:30:55] the good brother they come with the fear
[1:30:58] of God by God's grace I will do my best
[1:31:07] that's the question
[1:31:08] reminder people they don't want to hear
[1:31:12] do i God's grace they want to hear a
[1:31:14] good life if you find a good liar and
[1:31:19] I'm telling you we have some in the
[1:31:21] group
[1:31:23] when they talk they are not low-level
[1:31:29] people they don't talk maybe a lot just
[1:31:38] what they call the catchy would not pay
[1:31:47] attention to all that you will discover
[1:32:02] him I was thinking you are together we
[1:32:18] went to get a light when you lie both to
[1:32:22] the past when the past will ask you did
[1:32:28] you talk you know they always ask that
[1:32:32] question I'm telling you swear never
[1:32:38] give him the answer because if you give
[1:32:40] him that you did I'm tell you he's not
[1:32:43] gonna I will not so lie you teach him to
[1:32:56] teach her to lie next person she's gonna
[1:33:06] lie - he's going to lie to you - lets go
[1:33:15] with the messengers
[1:33:19] going down to paragraph 77 this addition
[1:33:27] church age if you notice this this is
[1:33:35] what here the writer no look the seven
[1:33:41] spirit what capital S Holy Spirit only
[1:33:50] one of them so their spirit the seven
[1:33:54] messengers the seven spirit it's only
[1:33:58] one spirit and that the Spirit of God
[1:34:02] which is called the Holy Spirit so he
[1:34:06] sent the Holy Spirit to this angel to
[1:34:11] the next angel to the next angel it's
[1:34:14] always the same spirit we are built upon
[1:34:19] the same spirit the Holy Ghost cannot
[1:34:24] choose Martin Martin Luther and you come
[1:34:30] tomorrow with somebody else and say no
[1:34:34] well the Martin Luther this is somebody
[1:34:38] else but if you look at the three works
[1:34:41] of grace its justification
[1:34:46] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:34:49] and it's go look in history what was the
[1:34:54] teaching of Luther the teaching of
[1:34:57] Luther in this age was then just shall
[1:35:01] live by faith it's not your works you
[1:35:07] are saved by grace
[1:35:10] amen so show me somebody who preach that
[1:35:15] because their first work of the
[1:35:18] restoration of salvation justification
[1:35:25] and then Wesley came to preach on
[1:35:30] sanctification being justified to have a
[1:35:35] faith in God what Luther said is okay
[1:35:39] but besides that we need to be certified
[1:35:43] the church must be clean the believer
[1:35:48] must be clean that means inside you must
[1:35:55] be pure in your search
[1:36:00] you must be pure not somebody coming to
[1:36:03] church wearing dark glasses when they
[1:36:08] say let us pray the ice is always on the
[1:36:11] single system no no no that's not how
[1:36:15] you get married you must be pure
[1:36:19] jesus said Moses says don't commit
[1:36:23] adultery people say ah it's hard you
[1:36:28] made in all my life I have to live with
[1:36:30] one wife I have to live only with one
[1:36:33] man that's right in a marriage about are
[1:36:40] you going to forsake all others marriage
[1:36:45] well you have to forsake all with the
[1:36:51] eyes on Kathy Janet and so forth that's
[1:36:58] a forcible a real bow I'm coming to you
[1:37:02] all my love to you I will not look
[1:37:05] anywhere that's what Moses says and the
[1:37:11] people said that's too hard all those
[1:37:13] Moses like that
[1:37:15] Oh Jesus came a Savior let's go ask him
[1:37:20] the same question
[1:37:21] Jesus you know Moses told us we have
[1:37:26] wanted to live with one will show ever
[1:37:34] will look upon a woman
[1:37:44] Moses was even better because we could
[1:37:47] not do it physically but we could always
[1:37:51] take those multitude of women in our
[1:37:55] mind and satisfy our self that's why the
[1:38:00] sisters the way you present yourself to
[1:38:05] cover completely your body because they
[1:38:10] are so many men without the Holy Ghost
[1:38:14] they look at you they love you they take
[1:38:18] you where you are they take on their
[1:38:20] mind
[1:38:21] and they take you to the room if that
[1:38:27] happened because of your negligence that
[1:38:32] man is gonna be responsible for sin of a
[1:38:36] daughter and that adultery will not be
[1:38:41] with a tree will be with you that's why
[1:38:48] if I was a woman listen to this if I was
[1:38:53] a woman every day when I dress a dress I
[1:38:58] look at myself in the mirror if I was a
[1:39:21] woman I will be playing like that with a
[1:39:24] bunch of men lasting
[1:39:26] I don't want to be presented at the
[1:39:30] judgment bar that will be a big surprise
[1:39:35] summertime is coming you wear those
[1:39:39] alight clauses they show you under
[1:39:44] underneath clauses Oh tight clothes
[1:39:49] showing all your body all the things
[1:39:53] before all the sinners you will be
[1:39:59] surprised you're going to work with that
[1:40:01] manager and you change work all the time
[1:40:10] that was my manager to Walmart that was
[1:40:16] my manager was my manager not only that
[1:40:24] that was a brother in the church the one
[1:40:30] wearing always dark glasses that was the
[1:40:34] purpose of the dark glasses this way
[1:40:37] when the eyes are moving you can see but
[1:40:42] you cannot see the only guarantee is for
[1:40:47] you to pray Lord is it your will the way
[1:40:52] I'm like those people so that nobody can
[1:40:59] see today they are happy when they say
[1:41:27] it's a huge responsibility same way with
[1:41:32] the brothers if you are not safe
[1:41:36] it's time for you to sit for salvation
[1:41:39] with the beauty of all the women without
[1:41:45] the Holy Ghost
[1:41:50] you will last even after your story in
[1:41:57] the Bible with Tamar it's the spirit
[1:42:10] asked for you to be safe and I believe
[1:42:15] there was a man walk on this face of the
[1:42:27] there was plenty of a woman before if
[1:42:36] that spirit without that spirit is
[1:42:52] forcing people into something they are
[1:42:54] not tell the priest don't get married
[1:43:01] that's our doctrine you want to become a
[1:43:04] priest
[1:43:05] no marriage want to be coming on no
[1:43:09] marriage
[1:43:09] sometime people go there for good
[1:43:11] position better living
[1:43:14] money and so forth but they are not
[1:43:17] converted therefore they are the first
[1:43:21] one to last this is the truth you have
[1:43:28] to check it with yourself married or not
[1:43:33] married if you have that spirit you have
[1:43:38] to fight that's what the altar is I will
[1:43:44] not be happy to go to church every day
[1:43:47] with that spirit and I don't do anything
[1:43:51] about it no no that's deaf today Easter
[1:43:59] that's what the Bible said give me the
[1:44:02] scripture I'm gonna close here woman
[1:44:05] chapter 8 verse 11 the Bible says but if
[1:44:17] the spirit of him that raised up Jesus
[1:44:24] from the dead dwell in you he that
[1:44:28] raised up Christ from the dead shall
[1:44:32] also quicken your mortal bodies by his
[1:44:37] Spirit capital S that dwelleth in you
[1:44:43] today we celebrate Easter oh he came out
[1:44:48] of the gate as I say early this morning
[1:44:52] Jesus could not come out of the grave
[1:44:56] because when he was killed they took his
[1:45:01] body they put it in the grave and the
[1:45:05] scribe said make sure you put enough God
[1:45:13] to protect that term because that
[1:45:17] imposter was saying destroy this body I
[1:45:23] will bring it back in three days put a
[1:45:28] lot of God there at least for the next
[1:45:32] three days and we'll see how he will
[1:45:35] come out but the Bible said an angel of
[1:45:40] the Lord came in from heaven came down
[1:45:45] and when he came down he holding a stone
[1:45:50] and there was an earthquake
[1:45:54] to prove the stone why because there
[1:46:01] should be a power the body of Jesus that
[1:46:06] was in the grave it was a dead body
[1:46:11] because the spirit left Jesus in the
[1:46:17] Garden of Gethsemane amen
[1:46:20] there was a spirit he was judging the
[1:46:23] mechanic and the mechanic could not come
[1:46:27] out of the game
[1:46:30] it required a dynamic dynamic which is
[1:46:34] the power and that's why the angel came
[1:46:38] with that power they're resurrecting
[1:46:42] power to go into the body and to bring
[1:46:46] him out and the blood of what I'm saying
[1:46:51] it was the day the dynamic that came to
[1:46:58] join into the mechanics that's why Jesus
[1:47:01] came to the resurrection now the Bible
[1:47:05] is telling us if the same dynamic that
[1:47:09] raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you
[1:47:15] it's shallow quick and your mortal body
[1:47:18] as well that means brother sister in
[1:47:23] order for you to leave the resurrection
[1:47:29] you must have that dynamic you must have
[1:47:34] the Holy Ghost because the way you are
[1:47:38] without the Holy Ghost it's just a
[1:47:42] mechanic called after coat rather well
[1:47:46] I'm said the Bible said you can have all
[1:47:49] those knowledge that's a mechanic and I
[1:47:53] can tell you where I put my condition
[1:47:58] you need the dynamic
[1:48:01] to be put on the mechanic pot this way
[1:48:05] the coach you know the Bible verse you
[1:48:09] know will be quickened by the Holy
[1:48:13] Spirit in order to subject this to flesh
[1:48:17] hallelujah to his win with the Holy
[1:48:23] Ghost it's just a form of religion
[1:48:31] completion that mechanic but with this
[1:48:36] with this with this morning Easter
[1:48:59] morning direction you have to look for
[1:49:03] that spirit when I will get married I
[1:49:12] will it's a big life you can be with
[1:49:16] your wife but you are not there
[1:49:19] you may be with the men you are not
[1:49:23] there because you have a spirit a
[1:49:27] lasting spirit that's why you see men
[1:49:30] and wife in their own bedroom watching
[1:49:35] pornography you see the men in the room
[1:49:41] watching mother come over and he's
[1:49:47] trying to go somewhere and when mother
[1:49:49] coming and the man is looking bringing
[1:50:03] demons in your home
[1:50:07] brother sister even if you are married
[1:50:11] you have no right to look at the
[1:50:14] nakedness of anybody that's why even
[1:50:22] people we are good friends good sisters
[1:50:26] you take shower rose your door I don't
[1:50:30] need to see your body and I don't want
[1:50:32] you to see mine
[1:50:33] same thing with men amen
[1:50:37] I don't have time to read the Bible
[1:50:39] about it it's your privacy when you see
[1:50:45] the men and the women naked posting on
[1:50:50] pornography to make movies that's devil
[1:50:55] in action you turn the television in
[1:50:58] your room you open the door for all the
[1:51:02] spirit to come that's why your situation
[1:51:06] will never change your problem will
[1:51:09] never be solved the sickness at home
[1:51:13] your children will be sick yourself
[1:51:16] because of the spirit your players are
[1:51:20] going nowhere
[1:51:23] we need the Spirit of God if the same
[1:51:29] spirit of him that raised up Jesus from
[1:51:33] the dead that raised up Christ from the
[1:51:41] dead shall also quicken your mortal body
[1:51:47] our body need to be quickened that's
[1:51:53] what Easter is about that's why the
[1:51:56] seven star and the seven spirit are
[1:51:59] about it's God sending is spirit among
[1:52:03] their people and the most hypocrite
[1:52:07] other people who look Saint on the
[1:52:10] outside but inside they are dead and the
[1:52:16] other people Jesus we are talking about
[1:52:20] what do they say white sepulcher
[1:52:23] whatever they are sepulchre in the
[1:52:32] outside painted in white you look and
[1:52:37] say a good term but if you open it
[1:52:41] they aren't stinking bones and that's
[1:52:46] the image Jesus used to preach to the
[1:52:48] people and that's what is among many
[1:52:52] people and that's what the gospel must
[1:52:55] attach those aspects to put those who
[1:53:00] are predestinated that's a holy man but
[1:53:05] there is no holy man oh that's a good
[1:53:08] man there is no good man
[1:53:11] that's what Jesus talked to that time
[1:53:13] each guy why do you call me good
[1:53:16] they're usually one good one good is God
[1:53:19] to be a good man to be a holy man to be
[1:53:24] a good woman to be a holy woman God must
[1:53:28] be in you that's why the Transfiguration
[1:53:32] Mountain they said it was a holy
[1:53:35] mountain it's not because the mountain
[1:53:38] was fully but it's because the holy God
[1:53:41] was on the mountain if the holy God is
[1:53:45] in you then you are a holy man all those
[1:53:50] desires are gone you look at your
[1:53:53] brother as the brother
[1:53:54] you will not default them you are not
[1:53:58] lying on their behalf no because you are
[1:54:02] good God is good is in you hallelujah
[1:54:05] and a good woman will look at the man
[1:54:09] only my husband I belong to my body this
[1:54:14] for him No may God bless you let us
[1:54:18] stand
[1:54:21] [Applause]
[1:54:23] we need the Holy Ghost we can do
[1:54:28] whatever we can
[1:54:30] giving sacrifices showing how we do good
[1:54:35] works for the church which is good but
[1:54:40] get him first because without him let's
[1:55:12] go now because my voice is a special if
[1:55:16] there say
[1:55:18] Spirit that raised Christ from the dead
[1:55:25] [Music]
[1:55:26] you
[1:55:29] if the same
[1:55:33] that lifts us from the belly
