========================================

[Music] when my [Music] [Applause] [Music] the yes [Music] there'll be no [Music] oh [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] shall see [Music] is [Music] one [Music] amen gracious seventy father personalist we just come to surrender ourselves to you [Music] so that you can use that use us in the way that you want i thank you to lisa don't you we are just uh vile vessels no some come the vice version father we come before you so that you can shape us okay touch no more there you can mold and to the statue of a perfect man you see in us juveniles bad habits certain movies have been true and you have sent the word voice to cut them off from our life and we pray this morning [Music] that the holy spirit listen to me burn every bad habit in every one of us real shack movies so that we can continue to grow in the holy spirit i'm thankful to continue our grandiose on this sentence please look at your children this morning i got this on franco mata they come for a purpose somewhere newport not to see a man in the power i know not to hear from a man about under denim not to build up the mechanics the nepal construction mode but we are looking for that dynamic dynamic which is the power of the holy spirit there are prisons decent and without the dynamic father son said dynamic father we cannot do anything it will be our ideas it will be our way of seeing things not professional issues but when the dynamic comes it's your way that's what we are looking for cleans our life this morning once again virifino visso madame and the bless your people benediction for your glory with us on the monday in jesus christ's name amen amen amen you may be seated as i greet you all in the name of the lord jesus is you amen first i want to correct something i said during the the preaching here i've been talking about uh the word back biting backbiting yeah i was taking it literally that to go buy it in the back yeah but uh i look also in the dictionary and i heard brother martin uh interpreting last wednesday jean jupiter so backbiting in in english means to talk behind somebody uh backbiting on anglais on francis a video parliament you go talk you bite somebody on his back usually that's not a good habit anyway or if you don't if you somebody does something to you and you want to hurt them back it's not a good habit to still seek the person bon appetit and i think we come to church please to get rid of those habits and uh believe by god grace during this series did you john god is going to show unto each one of us where we had still a bad habit do you montreal whiskey nose amount to the movies brother bonham said i think i saw one of the quotes uh what we need to understand our christian journey seeking devon compounded if we don't pay attention to certain bad habits on patterns uncertainty those habits will also continue to grow caesar between continuing grandiosi and brother that's very very critical critique you can have a certain spirit uncertainty god is speaking to you in various ways juve paula do many are different and if you always overlook at those habits a c who may please this is abitude that's a demon send them on it's a life satan v unless you stop it by repentance by confession but unconfessional by exposing that demon an exposency demo it will never leave you in the backyard it will continue to grow the continuation so as we come to church brother bonham said in uh the message the church order sister hope i think that will be a big confusion from where i'm reading maybe it's uh page four uh brother bonham said we believe in justification by faith roman 5 1. we believe that after a person being justified by faith in person he has peace with the lord jesus christ but it's a possible message that this same person recipient person could have habits avoid this attitude such as drinking gum while smoking for me doing things that he should not do fairly skinny develop affair filthy habits of the flesh the movies salsa between the share when i start looking at all the things currency comments are regarded to tissues i remember the quote we read last wednesday that you are here for the healing of your boy jose paul aguirre is underwater and for the healing also of your daughter devoted you see and you are looking for the baptism of the holy ghost if women we should actually but them descent is free if see you can get rid of those hobbies god is going to give you the baptism of the holy ghost and he is also going to heal your son and your daughter he will get it i will see what official fear so brother we see that certain habits are the cause of the healing sun la cause the reason and also the cause that you cannot come to the baptism of the holy ghost so as we come to church i look a new venus please we become justified justification means you believe in the lord jesus christ but the fact that you said you believe that's not all seneca you still carry certain habits a boy born in a muslim family and on foreign will carry some habits of the muslims evaporate between the family museum etc and the brother problem continues then we believe that the blood of jesus christ sanctifies this person this is a purificated person for the service of the lord holy service designer we believe in sanctification according to hebrews 13 12 and 13. where jesus also wishes you see that he might sanctify people with his own blood it was something suffered without the gate skipping a little bit and we also believe in kuala lumpur that after the person has been sanctified april a person here and the clean habits has gone from the person disability and a person he is a believer on the lord jesus christ jesus and his habits are gone this is some party we believe that that he is a candidate for the baptism of the holy ghost present candidate by term descent speech brother you cannot become candidate to the baptism of the holy ghost candidate but i'm descent to speech with certain habit have acceptance between them those habits have to leave is abit you do have patience but how they can live my commands if they are not identified see and in some parts they must be identified you do have identified and you must be aware of those habits would they be able to conceal this is attitude and when you become aware a composite concern then you have to work on the vehicle because the baptism of the holy ghost is very important ask your bottom descent is important that's even the key for the rapture long live amen so that's uh how we need to approach our own life since we believe in by faith and then we need to be cleansed sanctified sanctified with the blood of christ avec the son of the christian to the word we are listening to dave and once we become so sanctified then god will be able to fill us because the holy god cannot come in a dirty heart basket and send you new people down amen amen so i also want to thank you for those who didn't pray for me even i did not ask for uh james you could tell last wednesday because it was a prayer i could not really do a lot of effort i know the creation but my nose was stuffy monet and i was wondering what is what am i going to do on sunday really demonstrate because when you have a certain thought you don't want to cut off the spirit basket and uh by god to grace he balagasted you uh from friday he started opening up uh apartheid and i think this morning god is gonna help us again he knows amen so now we will come to the end of the summertime do you know the day i would like to have a small barbecue next sunday after church god willing not to eat downstairs but outside we can have some uh i don't know grilled barbecue we know some men they know uh this is a special occasion man when i need the baptism i just called brother eldest he got the bad history he does all these things to choose i call him the manager of the baptism [Applause] being himself the first one of being baptized here in the pool yeah so god bless you brother hell this brother tell him you know how to grill right bring it christina also say we are gonna have a barbecue yeah barbecue and our sisters they sir uh you work in a team trying to bring some stuff down so that we can have a barbecue and enjoy the bum oh my the bbq enjoy the end of the summer together hey appreciate that ensemble is it a good idea yes okay let us have a so the little boy little girl you can run freely after you eat yeah and i have some activities outside yeah work certainly it's activity there amen amen so we are going to continue with the thought we had from last sunday to see god on the move what you an action yeah we want really to see the power of god working among us because god is still alive we cannot just be happy to have some kind of a religious format but we want really to see god into action sir we would like to see jesus where is he where is he the lord god of brahmanam we don't live we are witnesses we have seen what god has done his ministry do you have faith on so many stairs now people are asking me now is not supposed to be where is that god who don't see you the best answer reponsor is to see god in your own life as you come to face your own jordans god must open the children this way brother you will be so happy brother you can talk about god who heals foreign i have seen that god in my life you talk about a god who can deliver the jokey deliverer i have seen that god in my life jv say proper geode you have talking about god who can feel valediction please i have seen a god in my life and if all of us will come with that attitude is it nutrition attitude brother i think no sick person no feeble person will be among us sometimes we pray louder but where is that god may we say dear i didn't want to talk about uh elijah in the mount carmel de lis carmella he said we want to see that god will answer by fire no vulva you know that song right when he says oh father let the fight oh father give me that key oh father let your fire fall father let your fire fall fire emmanuel you know that oh fire for father [Music] fall fire fall fire fall father let your fire fall father let your come on [Music] [Music] let us sing a little bit we want to see the fire of god falling amen amen i know how to sing but without music because if they give the key i am on a [Music] [Applause] oh father let your fire fall [Music] father let your fire fall fire fall fire for father let your fire fall oh father let the fire fall father [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] amen why didn't we need a fire why we need that fire to burn all the dirty habits in us so this morning bring all your dirty habits all the worldly dirty filthy things in our life you said movies shows monday that's what elijah did with the four hundred prophets on prophecy if your god begotten [Applause] and you are the best sacrifice exactly mayor sacrificer and put yourself on the altar and say father we need to prepare come yeah in the fire down refer and destroy and the tree amen amen blessed be the name of the lord so we are going to open up our bible in the book john chapter 14. jean-chappie cartelson verses 12. 214 cut dogs john 14. jean cutters it's the lord jesus speaking so the senior jesus christ very very i say unto you he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also and the greater works than this shall he do because i go unto my father amen shalom yes we are many uh come to some cinema there will be many words your eyes see the condom forever performing here this one performing elijah they said first song because god remained god dear verse 13 and whatsoever you shall ask in my name that will i do that the father may be glorified in the sun amen a quiet if you shall ask anything in my name i will do it and this morning whatever your heart desires ask the monday god the promise he will do it do you have committed affair and let me tell you ellison you can ask for money you can ask for a job convert them onto the cover one day i'm sure it's gonna remain to sit down but if you ask for the baptism that's the power that will take you out of the graveyard that's the power that will change your whole being say la questions give a transformative vote and bring you into the rapture hey it was a minute on a level we will add with uh ephesians chapter 5. verse 27 verses because we are preparing ourselves for the rapture and god said that there might be there will be a bride a jedi to your highness that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle neonitas nerd or any such thing on the sunblock but that is should be holy and without blemishes may i think a few center a report may the lord add blessings to the reading of the spirit i should have been addiction you may be seated oh there's goddess promised there would be a glorious church jehovah committed your high negligence glories without a spot santosh without a wrinkle there would be a bride your eye in a pose in a spotless dress a white robe in roblox a pure robe in hoppy without wrinkles sorry without spots but completely [Music] clean my complete monitor that's the baptism of the holy ghost is sorry about them descent and that's what we are after the second overshock amen so in order to have that hope hey i found it said don't set cover all the dirty habits must be wiped out so that that rob will be spotless a funko said robbie santa because even in the natural basketball natural a bride coming for the ceremony in the avengers ceremony if she sees some sports clvo kakatosh she cannot accept it any paper accepted so the baptism of the holy ghost is like the oil say come real inside of the lamb i don't tell y'all there are lamps that produce some uh cleaning material to wipe up all the spots amen amen so that's why brother bahnam said in the message what was the holy ghost given for a message it is absolutely that finny that's why sepoko in this time of preparation for the rapture don't sit on the preparation to know all the signs of the time it's wonderful uh we know this is going to happen next in savannah this is taking place in jerusalem this is a passage this is taking place with russia this is a passage catholic church is doing this all the this catholic facility to know all these things is wonderful but where are we with our preparations and the key of our preparations as the natural bride is preparing for the weddings and that's the reason why brother bonham said we read it last sunday in the message a total deliverance message he said you did we don't want to be a halfway church noble empire calling a glitch a missionary we don't want to be a halfway christian part of the cultural mission if we don't want to be christians that's fine say marvel then let's go do everything the world is doing hello month montfaire but if we want to be christian medicine then they will let us stop everything that christians don't do aloha return developers and do only what christians are supposed to do more we need a total delivery deliverance total from our sins they know from our evil thinking they no more responses a christian to be a christian you have to that's how sometimes you see somebody walking on the street you see why he's talking to himself we are in the fight the song doesn't come back sit and get out of my mind hey satan saw them upon saying you are walking through sit and visit your mind sir thank you visit whatever you know even brother branham came to that spot you will find yourself you consume all these bad things over consumers response responses and you keep going every country and sometimes for a day a perfect program a week jesus went too fast forty days and forty dollars we're not eating again when he came late eventually the devil the devil a good person in banter jesus christ you know what jesus i know you are scriptures i cannot do anything for the glory of jesus nothing for his glory but very often the devil will give you a scripture amen amen blessed be the name of the lord so that's what branham said what evil thinking a demon says from evil doing no more visactions form our negligence acceptance [Music] we and that's what we want the second order that's what the brother was to the sundance i met my car something will happen kirkus shows us if we want to see the hand of god cinevolo vallamente the supernatural natural because god is a supernatural pastor and judaism occasions for the failure of somebody polar fights they can we eat as individuals uh two person comments why don't i have to do my best you don't fail my power to bring my contribution a damn [Applause] if we cannot put our heart together for brother sister your problem probably your individual issues whatever happened then for security forgive [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you have to obey the offices of the churches and the pastor and the pastor also you're the person that's to obey god and if each person doing his past follow the fire brother the fire is going to fall okay you're really fake you have the sound then the god works through the past [Applause] hello into the church and and that's what we are looking for this is second order section and the burnham continues what i'm continuing you know uh with the same thought survey i recognize he said keep that code the devil want to offer compromise you are the only one good tracer it's not gonna work you are going to be a hindrance yours to yourselves and there will be consequences hey you had a consequence that's what brother but i'm concerned that's the way the devil wants a christian to come here you can contribute to the group by just joining to the church and watch history but don't you never forgive jones many pardon asia mayor jones what will be the purpose not to forget it will be all right if you can bring if you can go etcetera [Music] mount of allah brother people they think like lying is only when you no brother you have to come correct don't lie even to the government no mountain poor government to get food stamps it's a lie like any other lie say yeah immigration lie it's the same as any other situation if you don't stop those habits even after examination it's going to build up services that the spirit is going to grow that's how no i want to find the fault of my life when the world is presented i'm not an inspector unexpectedly to find the fault on everybody nobody fought downtown don't know all those they are habits those shows on disability we become so would ever need this experience you have you become very sensitive to the fault with the venezuelan zebra down the photo but your own fault never proper thought it's under the blood what's a song back biting etcetera you may design and see the street so brother if we can get rid of all this got it see on pc then we will see jesus in the sermon sir we would like to see jesus and to see jesus is that men who work in galilee galilei deliver the captives and he is here in the form of the holy spirit to cease to form the center space because he said vascular i will not leave them fatherless i will be with them even in them in memory [Music] that is the purpose say satsang in the form of the holy spirit you form the sentence and now when you do something you heard somebody i may not come for fedema like i can't if that person has the holy spirit personally brother you are hurting the holy spirit now this greek we are not looking for a lecture as i said a few moments ago they were not looking for that in your research they were not looking for entertainers you never shake shape out they developed they wanted to see him even the person jesus christ the person the jersey christian they long to see him because they had heard of him basket zone tons of power 61. they never said you know [Music] [Music] today we will come to explain everything in the scriptures if i speak it to them they said it is we come novena we want to see jesus new volume vouchers don't explain to us jesus today with great intellectual messages and intellectualism we can't explain it till you can see the picture reveal i but i'm continuing but that isn't what they were looking for tonight we are not looking for the mechanism and what we need now is to see that a second what is this what uh we have been taught all these years is it the truth or it is not celebrity brother that's your showdown you want to ask yourself the question all these messages we have heard those years do some messages on the season about what god has done i proposed a secretary is that true or not ask us you must get the answer yourself would they be a valid possibility you must be convinced yourself and in which way they can mania all the word to god and stand for andrew and john pastor should take a jeffrey paul on twitter i want to call jesus on my sins over and over and over and over this year two different seminaries and churches is a glisten city street until we are looking to see who this person amen is my title this morning allah almost is my time the holy ghost is the dynamic of the church the scientists dynamics the holy ghost is the dynamic the church is there they preach the existence that the church is not called to stand still merry christmas the church has been called to go into the rapture apparently but all the mechanics of the church cannot bring the church up matthew [Music] to get a glorified body full reservoir and cognition that requires a certain power stellar exhaustion certain croissants a certain dynamic in certain dynamics what shall i do with jesus called christ jesus christ the church has to go the and the believer must be transformed electron do i have to get concentrated to be changed with the vertical transform listen to brother he said he did a powerful statement oh in declaration he said the dynamics of this church let dinner make the set of glasses will be a refilling of the holy spirit and wrong places that we have worked in a small measure but the fullness of them make the dynamic mela le compre la la dynamic complex the full power of the holy ghost love with sons complete the sentence will raise her up violent just exactly like that just exactly mindset even the dead in memory more that's dead in like uh in christ set you some christian for hundreds of years ago will rise in the beauty of his holy spirit and take a flight to the skies here the dynamics latin america this is the holy spirit era brother we have seen this several times

paso love one two three four five six seven seven steps i love set it up so coming from porn so this is a small measure of the holy ghost saying patrick measure the scientists play but now this is the mechanic cecila mechanic you cannot go pump vapor the head stone must come la pia de ferto the holy ghost here hmm santa's family so the holy ghost is the uniting power cellar prisons initiative that will make this body perfect because the way the body many angles come down one two under three but the headstone mela pierre defense is perfect not perfect number of gods number in order for this body to become to perfection this headstone must be united when it matches perfectly what the the dynamic of this church latin america the mechanic is good the mechanic i know here the faith here the phrasing is by the holy spirit separate sentence in a smaller nation then virtue die holy ghost the dynamic of this church the dynamic there is my brother without the dynamics dynamics there is no rapture in your father without the holy ghost you came out to be changed without the holy spirit you cannot do anything [Music] of this church the certain glaze the dynamics will be a revealing of the holy spirit that we have worked in a small [Applause] remember he said the sound as he descended communism and the science elections taken the picture photography for which you purposefully to unite with the rest of the holy spirit to take the bride into glory they pose down a little more that's the dynamic of the choices amen amen why the headstone is coming down to unite with the body conduct the sample when you feel directly called but when that head my concert call and the body unite together is a call in your ensemble what will happen just give our revenge then they're full of power plenty the representative of the holy ghost the santa's friend will raise her vale level up just exactly like that exactly more and see even the dead a memory more than [Music] as a town citizen the church has grown up the greaser country to this level as an evil end here ac without bodily love someone like moved down there whether you cannot cause without [Music] we don't need a teaching permission we have for that yes no but we need the god of elijah of course the god who ends up by failure [Music] god's word right regardless of jesus amen amen that's the dynamics you are you need to die your mechanic is what one mechanism without a dynamic you cannot go in there with all your religions look at where you are you are with a good religion long sleeve for much longer but your thoughts responsible but your thoughts may have upon say how do you what do you think the quote-unquote always evil jolly malo evil thought the more responsible you are quiet was it conclusive you don't you think like this oh no sister you too and that's the mystery guard as hidden amen because if god could release that yes see jay pouvex possessed her the brother in love will be killed hmm maybe but there will be just a small group of people yes that's true pedestrian pity coup de jean that may be the person you have been thinking he doesn't like me in memphis he hates me when they see the thoughts just forgive me ah you have been thinking good today you're always praying for me that's right god it's he's seventeen oh that's a severance put it behind la cashel but one day all the secret will be to lose secrets i want to expose that's why if you want to get that power absolutely fight your own thoughts think right about your breath think good about your sister reach the best of the world yeah [Applause] is amen [Music] men know when we are going to start them come on also both of them look like look just like bianca rodriguez brother we can have the same mechanical

nice haircut a bunch of shaved but nah there is one of them don't have any spark yeah lambda kinapa then tesello any firing power by the prisons that image in other words whatever it's a dead mechanic on the chest in mechanic marker on the chest shadow dead mechanic sitting on the chest in mechanic mortar sees on the shelves what do you say the power is in the gasoline in the brother sunscreen but i don't care how much power is in the gasoline remember coming unless there is a spark there to manifest that power signal upon manifested set results oh you will say everything is fine to but the gasoline is here with me my lookout behind some cities i have the holy ghost unless there is a spark there to manifest that the power i want to hear an internship [Music] it might it just might as well be water separate to see being called the lord yes yeah but you can say whatever you want but ready to schedule it but we want the power of god to move out only when you say a prayer convergence put too much stress on the mechanics yes news about copenhagen solar mechanics and nothing on the dynamics a party to solar america we try to brag our mechanics [Music] we need to see the god of fire bringing results amen amen he needs a dynamic power of god he'll follow up with something that make the jedi the resurrection power of jesus christ it might be in the gasoline cage the petra doesn't beat on their sons yes where could it still be worse but the only proof of it put this life on it say that you appreciate this that's true that's the world brother even even when we have to face demons fell faster them all but at the demon they know the gasoline they know god he serves you dear and they know the children of god establish unfounded amen a man and when they see them they can't illegal they move out allah is cute lassen and if you are not a civilized partner say we cast you out and the demon spoke who are you okay give me act chapter 19. the name of actress therefore the demon speaks let them all palace but if you even when you pray for the people you can't see the people as not the people you are the person you are praying for whoever personally which verse i need to go start with acts chapter 19. let me see here yeah go from verse 13. that's it then certain of the vagabond jews like exorcists took up them to call over them which add evil spirit the name of the lord jesus saying we are joined you by jesus whom paul preached kazan who see the jewish exos they were seven sons of one siv shiva a jew a chief of the priest which did so i said they said face the shiva drift principal sacrifice it was not the pagan people and the evil spirit answered and said jesus i know brannam i know but who are you jesus the devil is speaking the jobless parlor yes sir and you know after they ask the question next verse 3 and the man in whom this evil spirit was lived on them and overcame them and prevailed against them so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded that's a shame islam which power do you have kelp with sons of evil in what you are doing are you with god over you don't think it was fair to ask a dream because i was that different that's where we need the dynamics and brother what i'm saying is if the devil doesn't jump on the people to wound them they see the devil and they start passing legend sometimes the devil is just sitting and laughing at they follow jabretta scientology you come to the platform we've been alex oh not the jesse oh in the name of jesus the devil is not afraid of that exactly he will look at all of us also
