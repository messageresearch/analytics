[26:12] i was about 26 when i first came to
[26:15] america
[26:16] and uh
[26:23] and i was sitting in the congregation
[26:25] like that
[26:26] was in congregation
[26:27] and i was the only african in the
[26:29] congress
[26:31] and brother jerry rose said uh i want

[27:26] of course
[27:29] and brother rowe was giving a testimony

[28:17] world
[28:21] his mother was dying with cancer in
[28:23] charlotte north carolina submersible
[28:25] concert
[28:26] north carolina
[28:27] then she heard that god had sent a
[28:29] mighty prophet
[28:33] prophet
[28:34] and this prophet was having services in
[28:36] erie pennsylvania is a prophet
[28:40] pennsylvania july of nineteen fifty one
[28:43] minutes
[28:44] and they traveled all the way to aries
[28:49] everybody was discouraging them
[28:52] why would you drive from charlotte north
[28:54] carolina to erie pennsylvania because
[29:00] that prophet only prays for a handful of
[29:03] people and then he gets slain in the
[29:04] spirit
[29:05] prophet praise jesus
[29:09] but by faith they went to erie anyhow
[29:14] and by the grace of god
[29:17] she was about the third or fourth person
[29:19] in the prayer line
[29:23] and the prophet said sister put your

[29:48] shows that can stop that
[29:52] it's your face
[29:55] praise the name of the lord
[29:58] and uh
[30:00] so
[30:02] he said i want my son billy paul to look
[30:04] at this
[30:07] and brother billy paul came and looked
[30:08] at the hand his father's hand
[30:10] believed
[30:12] and that sign on his hand he received
[30:15] something and he was weeping brother
[30:16] bill paul was
[30:18] playing and then
[30:21] and then the sister took off out her
[30:23] hand a lawless said la sallander
[30:25] said brother earned baxter put your hand

[30:51] he said see the sign is gone
[30:54] yeah you think some party that cancer is

[31:36] and in about 30 days yeah i prayed
[31:38] control she was so perfectly healed
[31:42] there was not even a trace of cancer
[31:48] [Music]
[31:56] and then a few years later i put kickers
[31:59] brother jerry rowe himself he was a
[32:01] truck driver elephant jeremy memory
[32:04] failed the cameo then he had a wreck a
[32:06] lawyer

[34:32] carolina's time
[34:34] i am going to throw this case out of
[34:36] course
[34:38] and brother jerry went home free from

[49:57] uh 14.
[50:01] just a quick word of prayer
[50:03] precious lord
[50:05] it is good for us to be here
[50:08] for the saints of god for to be
[50:10] assembled
[50:23] to give you the praise and the honor
[50:27] for we ask it in jesus name
[50:30] amen amen
[50:32] and jesus answered and spake unto them
[50:35] again by parables and said
[50:40] the kingdom of heaven is like unto a
[50:42] certain king which made a marriage for
[50:44] his son
[50:46] blah blah blah
[50:49] and sent forth his servants to call them
[50:51] that were beaten to the wedding and they
[50:53] would not come
[50:55] out
[51:00] again he sent forth other servants
[51:01] saying tell them which are beaten behold
[51:04] i have prepared my dinner and my oxen
[51:07] and my fatlings are killed and all
[51:09] things are ready come on to the marriage
[51:22] but they made light of it and went their
[51:24] ways one to his farm another to his
[51:27] merchandise
[51:34] and north
[51:36] and the remnant took his servants and
[51:38] intruded them spitefully and slew them
[51:41] a result
[51:46] but when the king heard thereof he was
[51:48] rough and he sent forth his armies and
[51:51] destroyed those murderers and burned up
[51:54] their city
[51:57] um
[52:03] then save heat to his servants a wedding
[52:05] is ready but they which were beaten were
[52:08] not worthy yes
[52:16] therefore into the highways and as many
[52:18] as you should find bid to the marriage
[52:21] [Music]
[52:28] so those servants went out into the
[52:30] highways and gather together all as many
[52:33] as they found both bad and good and the
[52:36] wedding was furnished with guests
[52:48] [Music]
[52:56] bring them in yeah
[53:00] and when verse 11 and when the king came
[53:02] into this in in to see the guests
[53:05] he saw there a man which had not owned a
[53:09] waiting garment
[53:16] and he said unto him
[53:18] friend how camest thou in heather not
[53:22] having a wedding garment
[53:24] and he was speechless uh
[53:34] then said the king to the servants
[53:37] bind him hand and foot
[53:39] and take him away and cast him into
[53:42] outer darkness and there shall be
[53:45] weeping and gnashing of teeth
[54:05] may the lord bless the reading of his
[54:06] word
