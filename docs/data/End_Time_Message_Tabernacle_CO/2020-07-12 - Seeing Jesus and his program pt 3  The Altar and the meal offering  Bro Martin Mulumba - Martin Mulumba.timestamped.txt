[41:27] different components they stirred and
[41:29] disturb looking at the life different
[41:33] commissar come from Levin if you're more
[41:35] that's why faith support that overcometh
[41:37] the world
[41:39] welcome Peter a palliative appear and
[41:42] said and brethren look I think you do
[41:44] not strange for the fairy trials that

[42:05] or the trials that befall as a defeat in
[42:07] V on the vernal are strange to be
[42:09] something instead they are a blessing on
[42:13] to a messenger at the example and when
[42:15] we see all those trials
[42:17] this is which once upon a time the
[42:19] calculations we looked at a rock again
[42:22] as a curse so mean malediction as
[42:24] something to boast about as much as of
[42:26] our behavior no contracting then we
[42:28] start on with stuck desiring coma so did
[42:32] you get an entrance balionte to get an
[42:35] entrance or an entree into another
[42:38] sister not my sister and this system
[42:40] here between the two world demo here now
[42:44] comes the way that is open unto others
[42:47] music reaches the offering here of God
[42:50] and this offering has to come driving it
[42:55] has to be made according to what God had
[42:59] in his mind arose upon say you cannot
[43:03] bring this offer about this is the way
[43:05] is you make it up yourself a sort of
[43:08] level mix every manner because when you
[43:12] start making up in yourself as a
[43:14] conqueror mixes it shows me ma'am then
[43:16] you become like OSA I love de venir con
[43:18] Musa you wanna help God to Vader I did
[43:21] you say God did here in this situation
[43:24] situation even if they say ma'am CDs
[43:27] even if they catch me with on with me on
[43:30] my hands every time I come back my man I
[43:32] will not have Grecian singer Paco but a
[43:35] God made you he is seeking you chefs of
[43:38] a humble heart and care Andrew a hot and
[43:42] curl that can believe him people require
[43:45] that when he says it a technology that
[43:47] you harden not your heart can anticipate
[43:49] powerful girl and that's the key is a
[43:52] Sierra
[43:53] that opens everything we felt bad John
[43:56] said humility before God humility will
[43:58] never see him whom the very shy man
[44:00] that's why the Roman soldiers listen
[44:04] Dharma came to him something yet and
[44:06] beat him up a rough cup and say tell us
[44:09] it didn't who beat you I couldn't see
[44:11] anything but then the woman made a fire
[44:15] with the bleeding issue a regular person
[44:17] when she understood well accompany this
[44:20] man that the Tommies had this secret a
[44:23] very humble assassin to mediate when the
[44:28] prostitute colic understood them how
[44:31] come she went down and she started
[44:33] crying - now come on say yes but you
[44:36] militant of such a militant was the key
[44:39] it'll actually open the mystery room is
[44:42] there of the offering there of God and
[44:46] this offering of God was given
[44:49] accordingly the law not human is no
[44:53] human help designed that offer Baraka
[44:55] normal a fabric is a set of God that's
[44:58] what people got offerings that of God
[45:00] who never be burned near a bad cup green
[45:03] walk could never be often if I back off
[45:06] any place any procurement but any place
[45:09] Mela Plus that was chosen get to be off
[45:13] that cover all these steps that I'm
[45:19] taking who say dr. Schaefer says it
[45:22] does't abdul-jabbar is to show that
[45:24] anyone out it is crucial for most
[45:26] attract we see as to know who notice of
[45:29] approach of course we come from a system
[45:34] with another system we understand
[45:36] there's a program new confrontation
[45:38] poker understand there's a wave of
[45:40] combined academics then in between
[45:41] somewhere on track a capella there is
[45:44] something to be done yeah crashes to do
[45:46] I prefer and there is a way to approach
[45:48] yeah I'm wearing the up crochet for
[45:50] getting oubli on that thinks that which
[45:52] are of the past the shark is on the
[45:54] prestressed world
[45:56] I don't know that from somewhere the
[45:57] marks of the higher calling the
[45:59] beautification celesta and this God
[46:02] allows it is offering oh God after an
[46:05] offering
[46:06] you know Conda you do not pay for even
[46:08] have a pair books you do not pay for
[46:10] week written up a paper paper paper
[46:13] Priscilla an authoring love Condor is
[46:17] something that is given freely because
[46:21] even the ingredient basket memories
[46:23] anchor
[46:24] listen gradient losing credit or the
[46:26] spices there's a piece order the content
[46:29] of this offering is it of consequence it
[46:33] is chosen site issue is it not by you
[46:35] powerful but back garden apology
[46:38] remember all these details this is it a
[46:41] very important lesson to bring to the
[46:44] people that God sees himself what is
[46:49] self sufficient nobody else are coming
[46:52] to help imagine divinity and as you see
[46:55] a congregation you approach it of course
[46:57] you need to do exactly the facts of what
[47:00] he tells you certainly did affair one
[47:03] thing of ensures though ensure schedule
[47:06] a cons that's it allows it doesn't open
[47:08] the wings and new prepare a sermon
[47:10] that's why what a brand I'm saying when
[47:12] I'm in the message or a massage but most
[47:15] vision the vision Department he Salem is
