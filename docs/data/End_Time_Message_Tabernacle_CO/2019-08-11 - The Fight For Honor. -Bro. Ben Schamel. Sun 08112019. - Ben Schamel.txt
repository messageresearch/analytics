Benny so I would like to speak on a little bit of Esther my family has heard me preach this I'm ready to let them off or not you could jump lucious you sir but I'd like to type the spiritual wheat millet to be fearless seven Church ages elicit actually Glee's and I know with your pastor you probably have have been preached to this before is just delicious but we don't come to preach anything new men deliver new publisher movin so we just come to encourage you in the work who don't watch it up on everything we preach should stay with the whole new person Buddhist our life should line up with the word be broken you never perhaps the loot should be the word absolute Filippov only we heard on the radio that there was a statistic the other day he's our guru given statistic that Millennials kill Emily no Domini no Don Kelly should you sit - 94 96 % uu Calvin Calvin got got to ingest an assessable song no longer believe in an absolute truth no quite blew up invade the absolute what do they base their lives on I love me not get skinny bastard of this you what makes things right what makes things wrong let's get food just give let what makes things good what makes things just boy secure movie all they know is to depend on themselves to give something deep oq amendment do you see the mixing that Satan has gotten into in the same middle school student the doctrine of balaam has has taken over and I go to develop my pilipenko nothing is white nothing is black here two billion won everything is great so again and we see this happening back way back in the world curse after balance about brother Branham saw way back trouble available bossy the John in Revelation saw way back I know Jean de la revolucion Ibaka this level above all bossy but we see how a wheat starts with a seed maneuver could do bleep most of all that you see man that seed is planted in the ground it's it's the most polluted no out there and then that that that seed has to die to itself it's the motor Dumoulin element and once it dies it cracks it lifted mr. deshield and that life starts producing in the ground I look at would be the research to grow some room a second if I put it in a scene and it starts shooting forth a blade it's not the Muslim so tell me like TVs are for long issues into a stop and also and then it's got a tassel its kind of shocked LaBelle and inside that shock as they see a link to the ballet Ellis emotes and we see the same thing happened with the church a new vocalist we started the times of Christ did it don't don't this and we start stair stepping up the seven churches does it actually give got Ephesus Smyrna Pergamum and we start climbing these statuses it Dublin up to the toward the top is just good be small and brother branham said that lady osya is the pinnacle aid a human and we could only leap if we could realize that this morning uncle is loose in my den that we are living in the pinnacle age to play but I love you blue kills for men a man we know that each age is built on the past church a usable to chuck a ship go Lucy will kill applause mr. Don now when that life began a put forth analyst is that victim was assaulted right there for a time that blade had life in it duties la pampa Navidad though that blade was Green these attempt aver that stock was green if they're in a belly dump event for a while that tassel was green but then dumped in a don't go vet it had life in it happen I'd be like they don't and we see that throughout the church ages the Lord would be in this church age they denominator around the holy store would have to move and it would go to the to the tassel and now it's going in back to the seed age I love the pinnacle age and a lady Asya that's you submitted I would you see a man I'm in the entire purpose under the big complaint of that plant descent Butler was to bring forth Sinitta poppy the original seed life Decimus oh you should never bring it up past the blade the purpose that the villa bring it up past the tassel possibility they put it into that see that it might produce that same life so it would be remembered it Dumbo so why would we look at our lives and expect anything different was shown in Jesus Christ himself men weren't anything different than what was in brother branham's life okay so before the secret don't because we are here to manifest something super when this same see gene life momentum nope that was in that see don't think the more food Abdullah the scripture says the qgs science shall follow them that believe you think Apple by numbers of gold please we are here to manifest that scripture people money for synthetic Petula if you're a believer he wasn't it how many believers do we have here this point then we have seed bringing forth light news of Elizabeth Gaddafi another purpose for that plan and no two-bit with that blah blah is to take a single seed to the put in filthy mouth and when it grows and it brings forth enough girl gonna be a boatload it would have no purpose if it brought forth one seed I'll still upon the beach the instruments uppity no to Samos there would be no game but again with the benefits but that seed must bring forth multiple green the program the scripture says greater works than these shall you do I know that not that we would do greater works than what Jesus nor the blue globe would have a multitude of evil enmity with that same see gene light if it the memberships living through their life he built over the no-fee that would be producing poor Jews are the Word of God not followed the Jew not some wishy-washy bucket there solutions like the word of Jesus max on the jitter their life look familiar no feet we should have people looking at our lives and be able to identify that they are Christians they could identify maybe don't they have been with Jesus Messiah double just you amen amen that's what they were producing back and look at the apology burgers are booked and they could identify that they had been with the double kiss can they do that with us don't baby them embrace the Lord some attempts are Benny hallelujah so I'd like to take our our thought from Esther this morning I love gonna be someone good person leave that stuff to Matt down Esther is a very common story to us as believers hello you start this there's a boom oh come come in for me new and there's a lot of focus on Esther herself epic ordered attacks on me as their element because she's a type of the brightest good HTP feely pulls the crystal mmm and I would like to look at it a little bit different and instead of looking at at at Esther I would like to look at Mordecai I love Melinda Doolittle us there's a measure to Lagos you because Mordecai is is a type of the believer but muggle should apply you and I believe that there are some lessons in here that we can take a look what evolution super bullzooka that would help us in our walk with you our go to Mass Effect live down there so if we look at Mordecai you'll see the good our model here is the uncle of Esther it did not lead us there he was a strong believer in it wasn't wishy-washy make the public they wasn't going to school and put me loose and then turn around in on Sunday morning it'll be motion about their say another thing you do not watch shows trying to be a chameleon they say that facility of my Bakula Mangla and when I'm in the green video way I dream I'm in the brown I turned brown specific good boy you see what that's a wishy-washy don't let my ability that's that's what Balaam one of your Israelites who that Israel it we're not to lose some pop but let's mix it couldn't ever know that's what happened with the Catholic Church particular disbelieve that faith and we see where it his brother su zombunny but regardless of the circumstances good book the Sikkim snows Mordechai believed God mothership he do it didn't matter what was happening I won't miss a bus another V Mordecai believed Johanna Shipley don't you the government comes in and takes his is this this girl that he took for his daughter yeah Mordecai didn't get upset mother sooner said before she he didn't hate their king you know by you know what he knew that God had a plan they said yeah and regardless of the circumstance so mystical stoic I believed God he could take God's Word Suffolk you pull up over the to apply it to his life today it's not jewelry not just put it back in the days of Moses the Muslims with employees not just put it back in the days of Adam no but someone shoot that dog but he had the Word of God being available for his day he tells you and that he me and his family it's tough for me it's fulfilling scripture for his day it feels like ability to pull else who a man I'm in so they take Esther out of his home no it's not a live inside my zone and he knew that it must be for good a Sabbath the scriptures say all things could you do could work together for good people who love yet for then that love him keeping popular sick to them and keep his Commandments this is Cooper music yeah I'm Jackie Dvorak I was a believer on this then why you kept God's can be the gossip woman what did you and the Bible says ability that God will be there to serve Allah if you're his sermon that song shall be good hey man I'm in no Haman me no I'm um he's the type of the devil I'm absolutely Jabba he was the son of a gag hello either do love a god and a gag was the king of the Amalekites I gotta to do what is a Malaga Maliki and you see the Amalekites should have been completely annihilated I when I'm elected the bed could be completely hundreds of years before yeah there's something then they are gone if you look back in your scripture is super guy delivers attitude Saul should have annihilated and also the village de Cobo of the Amalekites dude is a Maliki because God told him to kill them all men women children animals oh this and everything do because they were an abomination that's it that you know boom this one well it down then but now here's a sin from the past you know what's the opposite that that could be done about that has come creeping up it is like because they didn't take care of it long ago a brand preaches a sermon called doors in door open up or teleport and people don't mind giving the hearts of the Lord let me say Lord come in come in and yeah make yourself comfortable up more you could come in this room but he knows that you're coming that bit

he's sick he said deep bassy and he said Mordecai had saved the life of the king another service to Villa did you walk we're getting something I lose I don't talk about but Haman hated it Mordecai he said because he wouldn't bow basically the Satan hates the believer I'm so happy because the believer will not bow to tourists one of the best things in before you hey man I'm in and so more I'm sorry Haman I know Amin didn't want to kill just Mordecai you know Villa but you just model he wanted to kill Mordecai he relate to your model he wanted to kill his family if I meet him up here cousins if the entire nation do planisphere the mother she because the acts of one man I cause his evidence alone Heyman thought it was worthless I know I'm not perfect at this if indeed to kill Mordecai just yet Matlacha soon and you're wondering why do I have all these problems Vudu pockets due to su problema well if Satan can't get to you then he'll find another route and he'll start working on someone else Ivanka both of us we've got conduct to try to get to you who is that game try to get to your children that was also try to get to your husband or wife Maria the pump will pump because he hates you basket you knew who improved so where it comes to Esther only probably nice there that Haman had devised to kill all of the Israelites I'm an ability that you do this writing so she invites the king and Haman to a private banquet I know a little bit I mean why doesn't banquet and they say so what do you want you guys tell you the boy says come back tomorrow and I'll tell my boy I didn't do much to do it Oh tough the pride of Haman I don't see my money to do video copy he thought he was overcoming a new prosecutor body goes ankle I am the next in line because he don't leave oh I'm just below the case even the wife did not the King likes me as a member so on the way home I know he meets with his wife Jezebel he's gone cult of except for me since I've been and he starts bragging iike most of all most researchers too long yeah you know I've got all this King Wars it to throw you I've got all these children juices on phone I've got all these riches to be shared but he says you know what he did you sick what none of that matters because on the way home but the one time I was reminded of that believer again don't go villainous because everybody was bowing he wouldn't listen to me and that destroys all my joy he took my blood and I create such hatred it's a good day hmm this is Esther five and eleven we know what some sites their Cinco owns oh how the devil must feel this morning okoma schooler de basanti Semak damn he's down in hell complaining to Jezebel you didn't about oh no fell onto the second division I've got the United States oh dude okay if it does you mean I've got the Congo JLo Congo I've got all of Africa to Duffy I've got the entire world you know more than thing wrapped around my fingers too much too much there so confuse you so tell about comfy they don't even know which restroom to use in a sudden impact at 24 Chile's a but there's one mania there's a believer in my own and he takes the Lord's word una probably all of that if this wasn't mean anything don't be sick in Xalapa boy hey ma'am I'm in so I posted you a question I looked you up wasn't guess yo why would it bother the devil so much because the firm idea to Deborah tell him when he has everything under his control I'm looking at three months we only one or two oh wow didn't even buy thinking me but we must trace that all the way back to Matthew 4 I don't know much about to look for Ida glue the gut because he had faced this same exact situation of emphasis in the body of Jesus Christ so this is reduced he took him out to the wilderness you know me too though the desert and he tempted him he that thought this I don't give you popularity sure to not make you King she lit the fair walk I'll give you all the food you want to the riches you wanna sister tree whatever you want but what you have to do in return oh it is bow to me then clearly vermois worship me not do live walk but Jesus Christ could not do it by the fair because he knew he was about to purchase and then he goes down to you go to hell a boy don't fair and Jesus knocks on that door Susan plumb the answer and you will feel the devil says ah hi ha ha why does it do you I knew I could overcome just recursively Bank but what happened miss cos if I see Jesus Christ grab those leaves a billet of hell in the grave and now they are no longer in us overcoming being the Christian life Ventura because they have no hold on the believer even Buddha so soon acquire and you are that the devil's you you are losing the devil's reminder lose that Kiki's a bit luck that day with Christ he loved it when he was overcome no still I beat up a few so now when he sees you and you are bowing and a little work of Lulu thinking upon that scar that happened in his flight you've got to see I've been off the battle right when Jesus Christ had overcome this anxiety begins to reach out just get worried hey come on something know what happens if they are healthy so dude say this year praise the Lord not you amen so he just tries to present it as a nice package I know if this local means really I do brother Branham says it's like a miracle if anyone else in contempt he says you stay in there as long as you have breath in your body and say I refuse to have it who did that bulletin every that the two hostage overseas that Wow how are you feeling almost guru so did wonderful hallelujah
