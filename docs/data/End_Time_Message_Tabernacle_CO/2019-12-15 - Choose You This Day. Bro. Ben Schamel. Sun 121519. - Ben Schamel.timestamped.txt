[11:00] secretive little physical freedoms and
[11:03] Monty cumali Schuster's affair we don't
[11:08] just wake up in the morning and get
[11:10] married in the evening Paula Martin
[11:14] numerous well there is a certain process
[11:17] here push issues that vada Bonham as
[11:22] outline kept on swinging and I believe
[11:26] in every local church is a quirky bond
[11:29] psychically local each pastor has also
[11:32] tried to make it fit the need of his
[11:37] people
[11:38] Chuck pastor or if you're lucky a
[11:41] complete vision but we see the same road
[11:44] map
[11:46] [Music]
[11:47] but the bottom said in the marriage of
[11:49] the Lamb now marriage in one sense is a
[11:56] type people the earthly marriage here he
[12:02] is a type of the heavenly marriage
[12:05] ility tomorrow Celeste so whenever we
[12:08] celebrate marriage on the earth as
[12:11] Africans le polymerization idea it's a
[12:15] type of the spiritual marriage between
[12:17] Christ and the bride sylheti
[12:20] polymerization
[12:23] to twist Christ up like easterly's
[12:28] that's why we were called the bride she

[13:11] answer is clear right there a man and
[13:16] they say well it's a custom say well on
[13:20] occasion a Battuta
[13:22] but everything is a spiritual
[13:25] implication such shows implication
[13:29] spiritual part of 82 brother bottom said
[13:32] in marriage AMD with spiritual or
