this direction what will be more [Music] so talking about baptism what a baptism it's a god requirement selection we all have to go through allah because this is the first principle vasquez we came to this world knew that we suppose not to do suppose yeah in his love has opened up a way for us and this is a god provided way this is about you and we have to do it in the correct way in the volume correct before it's too late uh god giving the opportunity opportunity don't say that what about the one who died at the course [Music] you have to consider this would they be considered and uh even those who have been already baptized a meme say undersea and we know sometimes some baptisms have been done wrong [Music] oh you have been struggling ah it doesn't hurt uh to make sure that you have done it the correct way the way god wants people have baptized in many ways i know in a long time people have been arguing who should baptize the minister the minister should baptize himself you get in the water down low you're dipping in need to be pronounced in the correct name the name of the lord jesus christ they know the senior of jesus christ and if you are not sure steven is passionate make sure when they still there is still an opportunity called opportunity amen so this is the way to heaven don't despise it [Music] take hold of you ever say this oh he has been a long time oh sorry he has been in the message for a long time [Music] where you stand with your own baptism experience would they never experienced about them and every time the water is filled hey grandpa it should give us an opportunity so i don't need the opportunity to think about the ponzi schedule and after this yeah you see there is a promise your information to be filled with the baptism of the holy ghost directly and sometimes we may wonder why i don't have the baptism of the holy ghost because your neighbor but them just was your confession correct ask about the confession to correct because we don't just take the people and put them in their words only trumpet down low i spoke with uh sister sarah to explain to her what is baptism uh you speak about them and to encourage her to make confessions [Music] wherever she thinks you have done something that was not appropriate [Music] [Music] [Music] in jesus christ and whatever we do later just kidding [Music] if you can go and catch the water i went in all the water too low and bring it to me then i will believe you i love you that my sins are still here give me but if you cannot you ask me why i am happy to give her that song so i just [Music] who ask me where they are [Music] forgetfulness [Music] because [Music] i [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] me [Music] christian [Music] [Applause] is [Music] [Music] forgetfulness that's good enough for me praise god praise god my sins are gone [Music] my sins are gone you got me into trouble but jesus got me [Music] as darkness [Music] that's good enough for me praise god [Music] to speak about uh maybe people ever questions or whatever on the finances we spoke about i'm not going to make another sermon there oh you know but i'm just going to give people the opportunity with their questions uh i want girls and uh boys as well if they want girls i'm going down to age 17 and up because most of the questions i received was the former 17 years old brother don't see the people
