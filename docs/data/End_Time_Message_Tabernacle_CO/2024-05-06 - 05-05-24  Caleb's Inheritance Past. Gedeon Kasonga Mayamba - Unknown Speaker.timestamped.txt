[1:11:01] yes yes uh Grace kalala Grace kalala is
[1:11:07] uh one of
[1:11:08] our children
[1:11:12] here uh I have received Grace kalala
[1:11:16] here when she was I think four years
[1:11:23] old uh to complete her bachelor in
[1:11:33] nursing uh it should be really an
[1:11:37] opportunity for me to be there and
[1:11:45] support but
[1:11:47] unfortunately raes is a Jesuit school
[1:11:56] this is where I graduated
[1:12:00] also uh they have to do it on

[1:12:38] accounting uh we thank God for
[1:12:42] them and we pray for
[1:12:44] them for the biggest
[1:12:48] [Music]
[1:12:51] Milestone the coming milestone
[1:12:59] uh for them to be graduated to go to
[1:13:07] heaven uh I think in
[1:13:10] 19 2014 I preach a sermon on graduation
[1:13:28] uh the thing that we look at the
[1:13:33] nature in order to
[1:13:37] graduate you have to put a lot of
[1:13:41] effort and when you go to the
[1:13:44] ceremony they give some with some
[1:13:48] graduate with
[1:13:53] honor some without
[1:13:57] honor but where we are
[1:14:00] going we will have a big graduation
[1:14:06] ceremony and you want to be there with
[1:14:09] the greatest distinction that has ever
[1:14:16] existed and there is no graduation if
[1:14:19] you get 99%
[1:14:26] we have to be 100% with the
[1:14:31] word let's be the name of the amen amen
[1:14:37] uh and also I would like to announce
[1:14:40] that next Sunday after church God
[1:14:45] willing I want to have a
[1:14:49] meeting with the Sunday School teachers
[1:14:55] and the parent who have children going
[1:14:58] to Sunday
[1:15:02] School uh because we
[1:15:06] realize that uh our
[1:15:09] children we have to prepare them also
[1:15:12] for the greatest
[1:15:16] graduation and taking the children just
[1:15:19] to school to
[1:15:22] church it's good thing
[1:15:26] but it's not
[1:15:29] all the pressure in this
[1:15:33] country is so
[1:15:36] big that if there is no
[1:15:41] effort on the family
[1:15:44] side and the church
[1:15:47] side we will be sorry to raise those
[1:15:50] children in the church
[1:15:56] many will tell
[1:15:59] you I'm just home because of the
[1:16:07] age once I turn
[1:16:11] 18 nobody can tell me
[1:16:16] anything I used to teach Sunday
[1:16:20] school when I used to go to another
[1:16:23] church here
[1:16:26] most of the kids that were in my
[1:16:30] class when I asked about
[1:16:35] today the majority have been in
[1:16:41] prison many became mothers without being
[1:16:48] married this country
[1:16:51] America don't take it as granted
[1:16:56] you can feed your
[1:17:00] children clothe
[1:17:04] them but the biggest
[1:17:09] reward is to take them to
[1:17:12] Heaven sir and if as
[1:17:16] parents we are
[1:17:18] negligent that's the reason why brother
[1:17:20] Bram
[1:17:22] said it's not children who are
[1:17:26] delinquent it's the
[1:17:28] parent in order for the children to come
[1:17:31] to Sunday school for
[1:17:35] example it takes the effort of you
[1:17:40] parents if you parent you are
[1:17:43] negligent you give priority only to your
[1:17:48] job you are going to be
[1:17:52] disappointed I you remember one of the
[1:17:55] day I played the video
[1:17:59] here uh of what was taking place in
[1:18:03] Congress here in America about Tik
[1:18:11] Tok I don't know if many have gone back
[1:18:14] to listen to that
[1:18:19] debate it's very very all our kids they
[1:18:22] know the problem here
[1:18:26] the children with interaction with
[1:18:30] Public
[1:18:32] Schools they know more than us
[1:18:36] parents and this is the
[1:18:39] truth don't count on them when they come
[1:18:41] with their
[1:18:44] stuff they they can speak a language
[1:18:49] here myself and most of the parents we
[1:18:53] will not understand it
[1:18:55] they know what I'm saying is
[1:19:00] true sister is that true sister is it
[1:19:06] true your African parents they are
[1:19:09] limited in
[1:19:13] knowledge so it will require
[1:19:18] us as the
[1:19:20] church to prepare also to have also a
[1:19:24] counter
[1:19:26] [Music]
[1:19:28] attack the devil is not
[1:19:32] playing even from the very very little
[1:19:37] age they have put in place a curriculum
[1:19:41] with even the
[1:19:48] cartoons you
[1:19:51] see they put the children they are teach
[1:19:54] teaching them things that we don't
[1:19:59] understand preparing their little mind
[1:20:02] to become lesbians and
[1:20:08] gays telling them in the
[1:20:11] cartoon you have to choose your own
[1:20:14] gender later
[1:20:19] on but as parent we are
[1:20:23] busy put the
[1:20:25] cartoon leave the child and you do other
[1:20:29] stuff he's learning it's a
[1:20:34] seed plant the seed when they are
[1:20:39] little so that when they grow
[1:20:42] up they will challenge their own
[1:20:45] parents so the parent who think like
[1:20:48] Sunday school is not
[1:20:53] relevant uh just pay attention
[1:20:58] now brother Bram was telling
[1:21:02] us I want to read a portion of that the
[1:21:05] blessing
[1:21:09] Prophet parag
[1:21:12] 33 brother was talking back
[1:21:20] then on how our children are victim
[1:21:26] they are victim of this
[1:21:30] environment they are victim of this
[1:21:33] educational socalled educational
[1:21:39] system you take them to
[1:21:42] school they spend more than 8 hours
[1:21:46] without
[1:21:48] you with teacher with perverted teachers
[1:21:57] I don't want to use the appropriate
[1:22:01] word welcome
[1:22:03] Papa I was thinking like I will
[1:22:05] introduce you to but you were here the
[1:22:07] other day God bless
[1:22:09] you brother Bram
[1:22:15] said par 33 toward the
[1:22:20] middle to see this young women coming
[1:22:28] this young
[1:22:31] women
[1:22:33] weeping life before
[1:22:35] them they are at the Cross
[1:22:40] Road Cross Road means you don't know if
[1:22:43] you should go left right or continue or
[1:22:50] backward they are a victim of
[1:22:53] circumstances
[1:22:56] the decision they are making in this
[1:22:58] country about school about what what
[1:23:03] what make those children
[1:23:07] victim do you
[1:23:10] realize old
[1:23:12] men when we were
[1:23:15] boys our
[1:23:18] boys no has got 10
[1:23:22] times the temptation that we
[1:23:29] had when I was a young
[1:23:31] boy I did not have a
[1:23:34] phone there was no
[1:23:37] whatsappapp there was no Tik Tok all the
[1:23:41] thing did not
[1:23:43] exist but those children
[1:23:45] today in the days of William
[1:23:48] Bram Temptation was 10
[1:23:52] times from then to now
[1:23:57] it can be 100
[1:24:01] times and as parents we don't
[1:24:06] know sister do you
[1:24:09] realize that your
[1:24:11] daughter as 10 time the Temptation you
[1:24:14] had when you was a
[1:24:20] girl what will her daughter have
[1:24:27] if we don't do something for Our
[1:24:29] Generation
[1:24:30] here what they are going to be it will
[1:24:34] be shame after shame on the family and
[1:24:37] on the
[1:24:40] church we want to do our
[1:24:43] part but we need their participation of
[1:24:48] parents sometimes you see Sunday school
[1:24:51] children not present for maybe three
[1:24:54] four five session they give their
[1:24:57] homework they don't
[1:25:03] do and parent you expect them to be
[1:25:06] better
[1:25:09] tomorrow let me close up that page so we
[1:25:12] will speak more God willing next
[1:25:17] Sunday and I would like the Sunday
[1:25:19] school teacher also to prepare some
[1:25:22] material based on the experience
[1:25:25] interaction with the
[1:25:32] children the kind of music those
[1:25:35] children you see here what they
[1:25:39] know and the type of
[1:25:42] dances you will be
[1:25:46] amazed the type of language keep the
[1:25:50] Lang
[1:25:54] so let me stop
[1:25:56] here so uh speaking about uh the July
[1:26:02] meetings uh we are going to have as we
[1:26:05] said already from July 3rd to July
[1:26:12] 7 uh meeting with a special
[1:26:17] guests uh there will be about four
[1:26:21] speakers
[1:26:25] and uh I
[1:26:27] think I want
[1:26:29] to give them a theme they will be
[1:26:33] talking
[1:26:36] about will be on the bride
[1:26:40] Revival at the end of Gentile
[1:26:45] dispensation because brother bam said at
[1:26:48] the end of every dispensation it should
[1:26:50] be Revival
[1:26:55] and Revival is not to bring new people
[1:26:57] in the
[1:27:00] church Revival is to revive those you
[1:27:03] have
[1:27:09] already those who don't have oil in the
[1:27:12] lamp to go look for
[1:27:15] it that's really the program we
[1:27:20] have and uh we have also uh on the
[1:27:24] Church
[1:27:27] website uh the registration that started
[1:27:31] last uh
[1:27:34] Tuesday uh for people who going to
[1:27:36] participate for the banquet
[1:27:41] only uh young people from age
[1:27:45] 17
[1:27:48] up and we will also join married couple
[1:27:54] from 1 to 10 years old of
[1:28:00] marriage brother said most of the
[1:28:02] marriages breaks within the first 10
[1:28:12] years so to register I think we said for
[1:28:16] the banquet because it's
[1:28:20] outside single will pay $50
[1:28:26] for the meal that will be
[1:28:29] served and the couple will pay $80
[1:28:33] because it's two
[1:28:36] people and uh whatever will be
[1:28:39] paid I think the difference will be
[1:28:42] added by the
[1:28:45] church uh and the registration will end
[1:28:49] by the end of this month
[1:28:54] May
[1:28:55] 31st uh last time we saw people coming
[1:28:58] last minute we don't want to accept it
[1:29:00] this
[1:29:05] time and mainly we do it for our local
[1:29:08] church so don't wait pass the delay ask
[1:29:11] for
[1:29:20] exemption because we need to pay the
[1:29:23] hotel and tell them the number ahead of
[1:29:28] time yes so two weeks ago I have asked
[1:29:32] for volunteers who want to help in
[1:29:35] different
[1:29:41] capacities so there are some people who
[1:29:43] have
[1:29:46] requested and the those others like uh
[1:29:49] they wait last minute but we cannot wait
[1:29:57] yeah so we will have the we will need
[1:30:00] help with uh this uh
[1:30:07] commissions uh I will ask the people
[1:30:09] want to work for a special
[1:30:14] commission uh to
[1:30:17] gathers and choose the one will be in
[1:30:20] charge themselves
[1:30:25] but uh for
[1:30:27] cleaning we have a brother Junior
[1:30:31] mavinga uh and he is saying by the way
[1:30:34] that those who want to help with a
[1:30:36] cleaning they can see him after
[1:30:43] church and uh for
[1:30:46] food I think it was sister Solange and
[1:30:49] sister
[1:30:52] patience uh and for the general
[1:30:57] coordination we will have brother
[1:31:01] Maita assisted by Brother Emmanuel
[1:31:05] Chima and uh they will also look for
[1:31:08] option for lodging and
[1:31:15] Transportation uh I'm going to ask you
[1:31:17] if you have a home available that you
[1:31:20] can host a guest
[1:31:28] uh please let the commission
[1:31:32] know uh we want to give more priority
[1:31:35] for people coming far
[1:31:39] away not the people living in
[1:31:43] America compared to those coming

[2:02:08] earth he has to stay with the
[2:02:11] church be in each and every one of

[2:02:55] book swallow the
[2:02:59] book eat it
[2:03:01] up don't just look at the

[2:03:06] say the book that John
[2:03:09] took was not another
[2:03:13] book was the same book that Elijah
[2:03:17] had the the book that had gave to the
[2:03:21] seven angel
[2:03:22] it the very same book that John is
[2:03:26] taking and the same book the same
[2:03:31] deity has to have the same
[2:03:35] effect am

[2:04:12] things they didn't say prophesy in
[2:04:14] French they didn't say prophesize again

[2:04:22] French to prophesy a
[2:04:27] new that you you're saying you
[2:04:29] prophesying the second time but you
[2:04:30] saying another thing by prophesying

[2:04:41] [Music]

[2:05:02] message when you are messenger of the
[2:05:05] same message the same

[2:12:18] Faith paragraph 64
[2:12:21] he's speaking of Jesus
[2:12:23] Christ now listen how he's going to
[2:12:26] conclude he said Jesus had Faith with
[2:12:29] his
[2:12:30] power how did
[2:12:32] he he said I cannot do nothing in myself
[2:12:37] why he relied upon what he
[2:12:41] was are we
[2:12:46] together he RI in knowing that he was
[2:12:49] the word
[2:12:51] even before
[2:12:53] Lazar he
[2:12:56] remembered it was written of
[2:12:58] him he was the life and
[2:13:03] Resurrection now he's standing before
[2:13:06] death he remembered is the life and the
[2:13:10] resurrection that anoint
[2:13:12] him and he said Lazarus come
[2:13:16] out because he was conscious
[2:13:23] death cannot resist before life and
[2:13:26] Resurrection most of the
[2:13:29] time even when we fall before
[2:13:32] Temptation it's because we forgot who we
[2:13:35] we we we
[2:13:36] are before the greatest
[2:13:39] temptation just put your your chest out
[2:13:43] remember who you are amen

[2:13:49] Victory you walk on Temptation amen amen

[2:13:57] sisters he
[2:14:00] trusted he had faith in God he know what
[2:14:02] he was the
[2:14:03] word he had faith in
[2:14:06] God who made him the word amen
[2:14:11] amen he was God the
[2:14:13] word and he was in
[2:14:16] him and that gave
[2:14:19] him even Jesus needed
[2:14:24] Faith but his faith came from the
[2:14:27] knowledge of who he was am
[2:14:30] amen
[2:14:32] because he understood his position am
[2:14:37] amen if you don't know your position in
[2:14:39] the
[2:14:40] land you won't have any
[2:14:42] faith you know the position of Joshua
[2:14:46] what about your
[2:14:47] position said you know what God Said
[2:14:52] about me and
[2:14:54] you but what has been said about
[2:15:02] you he understood his
[2:15:05] position he knew what he
[2:15:09] was because the scripture had said he
[2:15:12] was this
[2:15:14] amen and paragraph
[2:15:17] 68 said now
[2:15:23] now the only thing you have to do then
[2:15:27] the only thing how
[2:15:29] many the only thing that you have to do
[2:15:35] then is have faith in where you
[2:15:41] are to have faith in who you
[2:15:46] are a son of
[2:15:48] God I love to say this way
[2:15:52] Jesus said I'm a Son of God and when he
[2:15:56] said
[2:15:56] that the phes took the stones he wanted
[2:16:00] to Stone him out it's not
[2:16:04] true but today we say we Son of
[2:16:08] God it doesn't uh irritate or upset the
[2:16:11] devil nobody Stones
[2:16:15] us there's a problem
[2:16:19] somewhere when Jesus
[2:16:21] when Jesus said I'm a son of he didn't
[2:16:23] say I'm God he said I'm a Son of
[2:16:26] God the devil got mad he wanted to Stone
[2:16:29] him he said why are you stoning me why
[2:16:32] wrong did I do but today we say we Son
[2:16:35] of God he doesn't upset the devil no
[2:16:38] demon is
[2:16:39] upset nobody's stoning
[2:16:43] us we saying why we saying the same
[2:16:45] thing as
[2:16:46] Jesus there's a problem
[2:16:49] somewhere I don't know if you noticing
[2:16:51] it as me that we have a
[2:16:54] problem we have to fix
[2:16:59] it the phes
[2:17:01] said because you are a man you making
[2:17:05] yourself
[2:17:06] God therefore Son
[2:17:08] of
[2:17:14] God but we when we say we're Son of God
[2:17:16] we don't know who we
[2:17:19] are demon that we don't know what we
[2:17:21] talking
[2:17:22] about that is why they don't even get
[2:17:26] mad I'm a Son of God I'm a Son of God
[2:17:30] the devil look at you now he just
[2:17:32] repeating
[2:17:33] scriptures there's nothing
[2:17:35] there that is why they
[2:17:38] [Music]
[2:17:39] quiet but the day we see as Jesus was
[2:17:43] saying with a profound
[2:17:46] Revelation with a deep
[2:17:48] conviction because in reality let me
[2:17:51] tell
[2:17:52] you God doesn't have 50 Sons he doesn't
[2:17:55] have 600 Sons the Bible says the only
[2:17:58] begotten
[2:18:01] son God only had one son is the only
[2:18:07] son you become son when the son comes in
[2:18:15] you when the son divid himself and get
[2:18:20] in you
[2:18:21] that's when you become son you don't
[2:18:24] you're not Son by
[2:18:27] yourself that's why we don't have to
[2:18:28] upset the
[2:18:30] devil because we make ourselves
[2:18:34] son without having the son in
[2:18:37] us because when the son is in us the
[2:18:40] Bible
[2:18:41] says I
[2:18:44] said you are
[2:18:48] God amen amen
[2:18:51] amen
[2:18:53] amen you are
[2:18:56] Gods if we have that deep
[2:19:00] Revelation and we identify ourselves to
[2:19:02] that the world will
[2:19:04] change things will
[2:19:06] change even our lives will change we
[2:19:09] will have
[2:19:11] victories and we go from Victory to
[2:19:13] Victory amen yes my brothers and sister
[2:19:17] this is the exact
[2:19:19] truth the only thing you got to do is to
[2:19:23] have faith in who you are let me say it
[2:19:26] this
[2:19:26] way you can have faith in brother BR
[2:19:30] amen
[2:19:31] amen that can help you until a certain
[2:19:35] level when you in front of a tri in
[2:19:38] front of Temptation in front of a
[2:19:41] problem you have to have faith in who
[2:19:43] you
[2:19:47] are let me repeat this
[2:19:51] you can have all the faith in one
[2:19:56] brother but when you of a real trial
[2:20:00] real
[2:20:01] problem the god of gram will not Happ
[2:20:04] you he has to become your own
[2:20:08] God are we
[2:20:10] together if it doesn't become your own
[2:20:12] God you are speaking of the god of
[2:20:15] is he won't help you
[2:20:22] and we are in the time where as the
[2:20:24] pastor the devil doesn't play around as
[2:20:26] we play he just boosting his
[2:20:30] power when he's going up we are
[2:20:34] distracted let us come up amen
[2:20:39] amen let us know what God said about
[2:20:45] us are we together
[2:20:49] [Music]
[2:20:52] God will not judge you for what he did
[2:20:54] with William Bram no
[2:20:57] no he will not judge
[2:21:00] you or for what he asked abam to
[2:21:04] do he will judge you for what he asked
[2:21:07] you to
[2:21:10] do we my yes my brothers and sisters
[2:21:12] amen amen oh oh John eat the
[2:21:17] book swallow the book
[2:21:21] prophesy again amen
[2:21:23] amen testify again amen
[2:21:27] amen said the only thing you can
[2:21:32] do is to have faith in who you
[2:21:36] are have
[2:21:39] faith in what the word says you
[2:21:45] are
[2:21:48] amen have faith in that
[2:21:51] amen
[2:21:54] amen in what the word says you
[2:21:58] are
[2:22:01] says Jesus had faith in the word of God
[2:22:04] that said what he
[2:22:06] was that is why he could say it's
[2:22:08] written of
[2:22:09] me what is written of you
[2:22:13] then that is what Caleb said to Joshua
[2:22:16] you know what God says about me
[2:22:23] Cale was a courageous
[2:22:27] believer he started by himself he didn't
[2:22:29] start by what God said about
[2:22:31] Joshua he said you
[2:22:33] know what God said about me and about
[2:22:37] you first about me
[2:22:42] amen the Believers today they afraid to
[2:22:45] say that oh my friends and oh my
[2:22:47] brothers and sisters oh oh my
[2:22:51] beloved paragraph
[2:22:56] 167 now you
[2:22:58] see Jesus knew what he
[2:23:01] was that's why he had Faith
[2:23:06] 77 and he's saying this in the message
[2:23:09] perfect
[2:23:10] Faith perfect Faith
[2:23:13] then it's not faith in somebody
[2:23:17] else the perfect faith
[2:23:20] it's the faith in who you
[2:23:28] [Music]
[2:23:29] are Faith could produce when he knew
[2:23:33] what he
[2:23:35] was when you know who you

[2:52:04] had sincerity that he
[2:52:08] had the power of God that went along
[2:52:11] with
[2:52:13] him we're not even
