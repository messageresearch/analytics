[30:09] rush but we
[30:12] pray that you could bring your
[30:16] understanding in the quietness of the
[30:18] spirit to
[30:23] us bless the
[30:26] service take me out of the
[30:30] [Music]
[30:31] way and come speak to
[30:36] us so that we can be right in your
[30:41] sight with the payment of our
[30:47] duties shall it be tight or
[30:54] taxes even credit card
[30:58] even our home
[31:00] [Music]
[31:02] payment Lord we want to honor thy
[31:07] word speak to our heart
[31:11] now in Jesus Christ name we
[31:16] ask amen
[31:19] amen may God bless
[31:22] you may God bless
[31:24] you amen you may be seated while
[31:30] as I greet you also in the mighty name
[31:32] of the Lord
[31:38] Jesus brother nille is it
[31:41] okay uh brother nille as a change the
[31:46] microphone uh you know when you are not
[31:48] used to
[31:51] something I feel like there is something
[31:53] ping hanging
[31:56] here but uh it's a for better reception
[32:00] for them to be able to control the
[32:08] sound amen amen we thank the Technology
[32:12] Group for all their input and
[32:19] effort amen amen so we spoke last Sunday
[32:24] on uh tight is based on the increase
[32:32] and uh
[32:34] tonight it's going to be part
[32:40] 50 uh there are so many things that I
[32:43] can keep
[32:47] going but I think 50 services on just uh
[32:52] blessings it's uh
[32:56] enough
[33:00] and uh for the
[33:03] remaining we pray that God continue to
[33:06] bless each one of
[33:09] you and uh for us to see the
[33:13] materialization of this Ser becoming
[33:17] real in everyone's
[33:24] life the purpose was to see God's people
[33:27] people to be
[33:31] blessed not to be
[33:34] cursed to come to the
[33:38] understanding that
[33:43] um we
[33:45] cannot be confused between blessings and
[33:54] curses because very often when we talk
[33:58] we think like we are blessed but in
[34:00] reality there is no blessing if we don't
[34:02] obey the word of
[34:05] [Music]
[34:10] God so as I said I'm going
[34:15] to stop on part
[34:21] 50 and I will take uh the lesson on
[34:24] Sunday just on
[34:26] offerings
[34:31] because if I want to make it also
[34:36] longer but I I pray that uh the Holy
[34:41] Spirit can reveal unto you more than
[34:44] what I have U
[34:51] brought and uh in your
[34:54] life uh since you become aware that TI
[34:58] is pay on
[35:05] increase you have to make attention in
[35:08] your life that everything that is
[35:10] happening is it really an increase to me
[35:13] or
[35:20] not because when you look even at uh the
[35:24] tax
[35:26] law
[35:28] there are so many many aspect they draw
[35:31] from the
[35:35] Bible you know that when you have you
[35:38] owe somebody
[35:42] something maybe to the credit card
[35:47] company and uh and the credit card
[35:49] company forgive you that
[35:56] Deb
[35:58] you know that the portion that has been
[36:00] forgiven is taxable
[36:10] income yes it is that's what you receive
[36:14] the form
[36:15] 1099 C for debt
[36:25] cancellation so if the legislation does
[36:29] a certain thing like
[36:30] [Music]
[36:33] that I'm not telling you everything but
[36:36] I'm telling you the the necessity for
[36:38] you to be aware on how to handle this
[36:42] matter
[36:51] regarding questions that can happen in
[36:54] common
[36:56] life
[36:58] maybe inheritance is it an
[37:05] increase your dad
[37:07] die he left you as a beneficiary of
[37:11] 100,000 in the
[37:16] bank is it taxable
[37:22] table life insurance
[37:26] benefit
[37:30] accident benefit they hit you in the
[37:36] car it was not even hard but you make it
[37:43] harder you went to see the doctor my
[37:46] back because there is no treatment for
[37:48] the
[37:50] back and then they pay
[37:52] you question
[37:54] mark so there are so many many
[37:58] aspect but I cannot cover
[38:01] all but for
[38:04] tonight let us stand as we read the
[38:08] scripture Malachi chapter 3
[38:12] always from verse
[38:17] 6 and I will take my subject from Roman
[38:20] chapter
[38:25] 13 for I am the Lord I change not
[38:29] therefore ye sons of Jacob are not
[38:38] consumed even from the days of your
[38:41] fathers ye are gone away from mine
[38:44] ordinances and have not kept them return
[38:48] unto me and I will return unto you said
[38:51] the Lord of host but he say wherein
[38:54] shall we
[38:56] return
[39:10] will a man hope God yet he have HED me
[39:14] but he say wherein have we hop thee in
[39:18] tithes and
[39:26] offerings so this is the topic we are
[39:29] addressing tight and
[39:34] offerings and if we don't do it
[39:37] correctly that means we don't pay it the
[39:40] way it should
[39:43] be don't pay more or don't pay
[39:48] less just
[39:51] 10% and the 10% of
[39:54] what 10% of what God has prospered
[40:01] you amen amen so I'm going to take also
[40:05] Roman chapter
[40:09] 13 from verse
[40:14] 6 Roman
[40:18] 13 uh you know Roman 13 is talking about
[40:22] us to obey authorities etc
[40:26] etc
[40:30] and among what we need to obey for to
[40:35] authorities we have to pay our
[40:39] tribute uh the Bible said for this cause
[40:43] pay tribute also for they are God's
[40:47] ministers attending continually upon
[40:50] this very
[40:56] thing
[41:00] render therefore to all their Jews
[41:04] tribute to whom tribute is due custom to
[41:08] whom custom Fear To whom fear honor to
[41:19] [Music]
[41:23] whom listen now to verse
[41:26] eight
[41:27] oh no man
[41:31] anything oh no man
[41:36] anything but to love one another for he
[41:41] that loveth another as fulfill the law
[41:44] keep it just
[41:50] [Music]
[41:54] that my my subject is
[41:58] oh no man
[42:02] anything especially to
[42:06] God may the Lord bless the reading of
[42:09] the scripture you may be
[42:14] seated oh no man
[42:19] anything
[42:21] if the Bible is
[42:24] saying oh no man anything
[42:29] now as we are studying the tight and
[42:34] offering if from one
[42:39] another oh no man
[42:42] anything how much more if we have to owe
[42:51] God are you with
[42:54] me it's just a reflection
[42:58] the Bible
[43:00] said owe nothing to anybody to any
[43:04] man that brother and
[43:08] sisters we are we are in love for one
[43:13] another that's what the Bible said oh no
[43:17] man
[43:19] anything but to love one
[43:23] another because if you love one
[43:26] another
[43:28] a favor that my brother has done unto
[43:32] me he gave me some
[43:35] money with the promise to pay him
[43:40] back but if there is a real
[43:44] love I have to put myself in his
[43:49] position not to feel yourself like only
[43:53] me only me only
[43:56] me
[43:58] you take you feel
[44:01] good you decrease your
[44:06] brother but it's normal if we can take
[44:10] and pay
[44:14] back but it's bad if we can take
[44:19] it and we don't pay
[44:22] back we start getting our
[44:26] pay
[44:27] but we feel like the money is
[44:30] good and it's good for not even for me
[44:34] not to pay
[44:37] back this is a lack of
[44:41] love it's too much
[44:46] selfishness and we don't want us to be
[44:48] in that
[44:52] condition I may have not
[44:55] something I can go sister L help me with
[45:00] this I'm going to pay you and when I go
[45:04] pay
[45:06] back I have to keep my
[45:10] word and in the previous lesson I I read
[45:13] The Book of
[45:17] Leviticus or the book of
[45:19] Deuteronomy when you learn money to your
[45:23] brother in the faith don't charge them
[45:26] interest
[45:29] and we don't want to take advantage of
[45:32] that because there is no
[45:35] interest I'm not going to pay oh brother
[45:39] Friday Friday no no no no no no this is
[45:45] the point I'm going
[45:47] to heat a little
[45:51] bit with the thought on the
[45:55] tight
[45:58] if God can tell human
[46:01] being don't owe other
[46:05] people don't you
[46:08] understand that God is our
[46:12] priority if we should not owe to one
[46:17] another therefore we should not also oh
[46:25] God
[46:28] you like money I'm talking about
[46:31] money about paying the
[46:34] debt even the credit card
[46:38] companies that
[46:41] company it has it
[46:50] owner they need to make
[46:52] money and you take
[46:54] it and I'm not going to pay
[46:57] but when you took the credit
[46:59] card you knew that there is a payment
[47:04] plan if you cannot afford
[47:08] it brother don't overwhelm yourself with
[47:16] debt because a lot of
[47:18] debt will make you live a life of uh
[47:22] left right left
[47:25] right Z when the Creditor is after
[47:30] you you will be tempted to
[47:34] lie oh I was in the hospital or they did
[47:37] not pay me I lost my
[47:41] job it's not good and I think when we
[47:45] come to the church all later
[47:48] on when I will talk about the function
[47:51] of the
[47:54] trustees administrator the truste are
[47:57] people who are going to watch over the
[48:04] church not to enter into
[48:08] programs let us buy this let us buy this
[48:12] let us buy this to the extent you start
[48:15] putting more pressure on the people to
[48:20] contribute contribute on this we want to
[48:23] buy a airplane for the
[48:25] church really the church need the
[48:31] airplane so there should be the
[48:34] people before they engage the
[48:38] church they should do it on something
[48:40] that is
[48:43] important not wake up
[48:46] tomorrow oh brother you know what let us
[48:49] demolish this
[48:52] building and build another one with a
[48:55] balcony
[48:58] because all the new churches have
[49:02] balcony so there should be people who
[49:04] know what they are
[49:07] doing and same thing with our
[49:10] family the head of the
[49:13] house must be something who know what
[49:16] they are doing with their
[49:19] finances because the money that God
[49:21] gives
[49:23] us we have to use it
[49:25] wisely
[49:28] not going to buy oh I need a this car I
[49:32] need also this car you find yourself
[49:35] with five
[49:36] cars this one payment 1,000 a
[49:39] month this one 2,000 a month how much
[49:43] money do you
[49:45] make and the five car for which
[49:50] purpose so with this in our
[49:54] mind brother NE I think this thing is
[49:56] battling me
[49:59] is I'm in pain
[50:04] some
[50:10] sorry
[50:12] okay I think they are going to adjust
[50:15] it yeah so if God said oh no
[50:22] man he did not say in that
[50:25] scripture oh
[50:30] me no he's just teaching you if you love
[50:34] one another don't owe to each
[50:39] other this doesn't mean that we cannot
[50:42] contract debt
[50:45] no we contract the debt that we can
[50:50] afford and we have to respect our
[50:54] engagement and this is the love from one
[50:59] another and if we love
[51:01] God we will do the same way we cannot
[51:05] owe
[51:06] God we have been taught to pay our TI to
[51:11] pay our offering and we have to pay them
[51:14] timely
[51:18] also if you don't pay it when it's
[51:23] do you owe now
[51:25] God
[51:27] sometimes the debt towards god with our
[51:31] TI and
[51:32] offering is taking
[51:35] month
[51:37] weeks
[51:39] Years brother you are a
[51:42] Believer you make
[51:45] money five years in the church you don't
[51:49] pay your ti one
[51:52] year no no the first thing we have to do
[51:58] is to pay our TI let me go with William
[52:02] Bram in August 15
[52:07] 1965 I did not give you that
[52:14] quot 65 look at the message and know it
[52:19] not preach August 15
[52:25] 1965
[52:27] paragraph
[52:29] 280 and you know sometimes as
[52:33] preachers you can come across a
[52:35] something that come when you are
[52:40] preaching you just mention
[52:42] it maybe without going into much
[52:46] detail and the people who understand
[52:52] it and they will that will cause
[52:54] sometimes problems
[52:57] when brother B was preaching this
[53:00] message this was August
[53:04] 15 so there was a
[53:06] Sunday he said this and people they came
[53:10] with a lot of
[53:12] questions and the next
[53:15] Sunday that I will give you the next
[53:17] quote that was preached August 22nd
[53:24] 1965 just a week later
[53:27] where brother trying to clarify
[53:30] it but what he said he was telling
[53:34] people clean your lives
[53:38] up clean your life
[53:41] up in which way to to clean up your
[53:46] lifeam say pay your
[53:50] debt oh no
[53:53] man that's what Jesus said
[53:57] amen amen let us remove
[54:00] it go to the next quot so as a preacher
[54:04] he was saying brother his mind was on
[54:08] people cleaning up their
[54:14] life pay your
[54:17] debt with one
[54:20] another pay your ti to God
[54:24] also which is the to
[54:28] God clean your
[54:30] life that means if you owe people
[54:34] money you live a dirty
[54:41] life oh amen you don't like
[54:46] it it's a dirty
[54:48] life you will be a
[54:51] hypocrite you will be a liar you will be
[54:54] a cook
[54:59] because when you get the first
[55:02] loan they give to you in order to get
[55:05] the next
[55:07] one you have to say something
[55:12] sweet and that sweet thing is not
[55:18] always so go in the next quod the first
[55:22] one I gave you that brother preach the
[55:25] next
[55:28] Sunday Christ is revealed in his own
[55:33] word par
[55:37] 12
[55:39] now now I see laying
[55:44] here there had been many requests this
[55:47] last
[55:50] week what he said last
[55:53] Sunday people came with a lot of request
[56:00] on what I said last Sunday on the
[56:05] message I believe I forget what I titled
[56:09] it
[56:12] on that was that message and know it
[56:16] not but I said something about paying
[56:20] your
[56:22] debt and you know no matter what you
[56:27] say it's misunderstood by
[56:33] many no matter what you
[56:36] say no matter what you
[56:39] say brother we are not in a theology
[56:43] school where I have to do the think or a
[56:46] preacher say think
[56:51] methodically whatever you say people
[56:54] will misunderstand it
[56:57] but the best
[56:59] attitude if you
[57:02] misunderstand approach your
[57:05] brother approach your
[57:08] sister don't go and start talking on the
[57:13] side did you hear what he said what did
[57:16] he meant maybe it's something that slip
[57:19] out of his
[57:25] mouth
[57:27] they don't want to misunderstand
[57:33] it if they don't do it also as I don't
[57:37] want to understand it
[57:40] no but you just simply misunderstand
[57:47] it and now someone
[57:49] said should we buy a
[57:53] car here brother was trying maybe one of
[57:56] the question somebody
[57:59] asked shall we buy everything
[58:03] cash do you know that the Jehovah
[58:05] Witnesses they don't take
[58:10] debt hello I'm teaching you Jehovah
[58:14] Witness
[58:17] Doctrine they are not for
[58:19] that you want to buy something save your
[58:23] money save your money go pay it cash
[58:28] but us that's not what brother is
[58:31] teaching
[58:32] us you can't take a
[58:34] debt as long as you can afford and pay
[58:37] it
[58:42] correctly that's why he said now that
[58:47] isn't what Jesus spoke
[58:53] of all the Bible there
[58:56] that said oh no man
[59:00] nothing it's that lingering debt that
[59:03] you could
[59:08] pay that's what Jesus was talking
[59:11] about the long
[59:14] debt you take money from your
[59:17] brother I pay you tomorrow tomorrow
[59:22] tomorrow no that's what the Bible is
[59:25] talking
[59:27] oh no man in that
[59:30] way pay
[59:34] them that owing no man
[59:40] nothing it doesn't mean oh my we owe our
[59:47] rent our telephone
[59:49] bill yeah we buy we use the
[59:52] telephone on a debt
[59:55] basis at the end of the month we go pay
[59:59] we stay in our
[1:00:01] apartment at the end of the month we go
[1:00:04] pay we use the car at the end of the
[1:00:07] month we go pay as long as we
[1:00:11] pay it's okay but what Jesus was
[1:00:16] talking that is
[1:00:19] clarifying is those things that you can
[1:00:24] pay and you don't want to
[1:00:26] pay among us if we go into
[1:00:33] records brother it will be a
[1:00:36] shame to the extent this one ow this
[1:00:40] one this one ow this one not on a single
[1:00:47] basis but on a regular
[1:00:51] basis a date that last a long time
[1:00:56] [Music]
[1:00:57] and it seems like you don't care
[1:01:02] yourself and you are claiming that I'm
[1:01:04] going into the
[1:01:06] Rapture said don't go in the Rapture
[1:01:10] with something hanging on your
[1:01:15] neck clean up your
[1:01:17] life pay your debt in order to
[1:01:21] successfully pay your
[1:01:24] debt manage your debt
[1:01:28] correctly take the debt you can
[1:01:31] afford not because that one bought that
[1:01:35] car I need also that
[1:01:37] car and Trouble In The
[1:01:40] Family the wife telling
[1:01:46] husb this time if I give birth you have
[1:01:49] to buy the car for me no and you the
[1:01:52] wife you are putting pressure on your
[1:01:55] husband
[1:01:57] and today he can have a
[1:02:00] [Music]
[1:02:02] stroke because of
[1:02:07] pressure we are getting
[1:02:09] old spare the pressure on one
[1:02:14] another I have also to have that I have
[1:02:18] to have this and to the
[1:02:20] extent people coming to church they are
[1:02:24] coping one another
[1:02:26] this one buy this I have
[1:02:29] also do you have the the same money with
[1:02:34] that no that's not my
[1:02:41] problem my time are you a Christian or
[1:02:44] are you a
[1:02:49] pan hello hello and that
[1:02:54] pressure will put the family in big
[1:02:58] debt to the extent now they can no more
[1:03:02] pay the debt
[1:03:04] tight no the money coming is just enough
[1:03:09] to cover what people can
[1:03:15] see because if they take the house they
[1:03:19] take the
[1:03:20] car ah it's going to be
[1:03:23] embarrassing therefore let us put God uh
[1:03:28] behind but the same God is the one who
[1:03:31] said oh no man
[1:03:34] nothing don't owe to the
[1:03:40] dealer don't owe also to
[1:03:44] Heaven amen
[1:03:46] amen Bram continu
[1:03:51] continue he's talking about those
[1:03:53] hanging depth
[1:03:57] but an old lering
[1:04:02] debt that you could be paying
[1:04:05] on pay it
[1:04:08] off see now don't go with anything
[1:04:13] hanging on you like
[1:04:22] that don't go with anything hanging on
[1:04:25] you like
[1:04:34] that is the the translation correct I
[1:04:38] think paragraph 13 brother who is
[1:04:42] teaching us the
[1:04:44] things is giving now his
[1:04:47] testimony I remember a time when I was
[1:04:51] sick once when I was a
[1:04:54] boy I came out of the hospital owing
[1:04:58] about
[1:05:03] $2,000 and used to be a drug here Mr
[1:05:10] swaner I owe him about three or $400 a
[1:05:15] medicine
[1:05:19] Bill he didn't even know

[1:52:35] families now about the
[1:52:37] churches the churches has got into the
[1:52:41] same thing out of social
[1:52:46] life they brought it into the
[1:52:50] church their social life
[1:52:53] and their
[1:52:54] politics and their other things until
[1:52:58] they have got to the
[1:53:00] church so confused that he doesn't know
[1:53:04] what to
[1:53:08] do they brought politics in the
[1:53:12] church they brought also social
[1:53:15] life their social
[1:53:18] activities the church is to preach the
[1:53:21] word of God
[1:53:24] the rest of the
[1:53:25] activities all birthday all
[1:53:31] showers
[1:53:33] secondary but if you place them ahead of
[1:53:36] the
[1:53:37] word you come in
[1:53:39] trouble
[1:53:41] Bingo and
[1:53:46] B those are things oh there is a new
[1:53:50] company go put the money
[1:53:55] get a lot of money what if that doesn't
[1:53:58] happen over what they call
[1:54:01] it and this sers and dances and so
[1:54:06] forth in the house of the
[1:54:09] Lord why it's a
[1:54:15] pity you say well that isn't that's on
[1:54:21] the annex
[1:54:24] the annex is the house closer to the
[1:54:28] church remember it was the annex also
[1:54:32] that Jesus beat the merchant out with
[1:54:36] their
[1:54:42] merchandise oh we are just in the lobby
[1:54:45] here we can make noise we can make buies
[1:54:50] remember it's the house of God
[1:54:52] [Music]
[1:54:58] are you reading with
[1:55:00] me it's written my father's house is
[1:55:04] made a house of
[1:55:07] prayer as soon as the service is
[1:55:11] over maybe somebody praying in the
[1:55:14] [Music]
[1:55:16] basement in the
[1:55:20] lobby making a lot of
[1:55:25] how many times shall we talk about it
[1:55:27] and you have made it a den of
[1:55:34] theves see it's wrong I don't care where
[1:55:39] it's
[1:55:41] at as long as the
[1:55:44] church the church is not so much the
[1:55:48] building it's the people in the
[1:55:51] building
[1:55:54] let's skip
[1:55:56] here now we find out that the
[1:56:00] churches two are always promising
[1:56:05] something like television and so
[1:56:08] forth that they never get to the thing
[1:56:12] they
[1:56:15] promis you promise your children you
[1:56:18] promise your husband you promise the
[1:56:20] wife you promise the
[1:56:22] the pastor promise the
[1:56:24] congregation things they can never come
[1:56:27] to
[1:56:29] accomplish don't you do
[1:56:33] that when you give your
[1:56:37] vow your
[1:56:39] promise try to do it you take something
[1:56:42] from
[1:56:43] somebody you
[1:56:45] cannot come talk to the person
[1:56:50] nicely to extend the person can really
[1:56:52] see that you are
[1:56:55] sincere but when they come as I'm
[1:56:58] reading here I think maybe there will be
[1:57:01] a lot of things that will happen
[1:57:07] after know just forgive me as the in the
[1:57:10] heart there is no
[1:57:13] sincerity that's why you continue to
[1:57:16] live in that
[1:57:20] mess as I have often
[1:57:33] said you can take the note and go read
[1:57:36] it
[1:57:37] yourself sking to paragraph
[1:57:41] 60 that's even become in Pentecost in
[1:57:44] the
[1:57:47] churches here tonight I say it even in
[1:57:50] the message Church
[1:57:56] people take debt they don't
[1:57:59] pay they promise think they cannot
[1:58:02] accomplish you promise your your dad
[1:58:05] your your daughter I will have a
[1:58:07] graduation
[1:58:10] party is there graduation King The
[1:58:12] Garden or your University which
[1:58:16] graduation are you talking University
[1:58:18] Kingdom Garden it become into the
[1:58:20] Pentecostal real
[1:58:25] that they are always promising something
[1:58:27] they never get
[1:58:31] to it's always that every fellow has a
[1:58:35] different sensation and make it whether
[1:58:38] it scriptural or
[1:58:40] [Music]
[1:58:45] not they are promising something that
[1:58:48] they never get to
[1:58:51] E
[1:58:53] until it seems
[1:58:56] like it's got to a place to
[1:59:01] where there doesn't seem to be any
[1:59:09] sincerity brother give me this I pray
[1:59:11] you
[1:59:12] tomorrow it's like a a
[1:59:19] slogan they never get to it
[1:59:24] the people don't get down to that real
[1:59:26] canel of
[1:59:33] sincerity the very English word of
[1:59:38] sincerity has lost its value to the
[1:59:43] people brother forgive
[1:59:46] me I I will I did not pay you but I will
[1:59:49] pay
[1:59:49] you but in the meantime you have money
[1:59:53] in the pocket brother first pay
[1:59:59] that oh by the people way of
[2:00:04] living it lost its sincerity to
[2:00:09] them
[2:00:11] sity now they don't seem to understand
[2:00:15] it paragraph 61 bam said even to our
[2:00:21] confession
[2:00:24] there is no
[2:00:25] confession even to our
[2:00:32] confessions conf we confess the same sin
[2:00:35] but there is no
[2:00:39] sincerity you lie because they CAU you
[2:00:43] forgive me but are you sincere in your
[2:00:47] heart sincerity means you recognize
[2:00:51] first
[2:00:53] that what I did was
[2:00:55] wrong second I go see the
[2:00:59] person for
[2:01:01] forgiveness then I turn to
[2:01:04] God with a promise that if you forgive
[2:01:08] me by your grace help me not to do it
[2:01:13] again a real confession must lead you to
[2:01:17] promise that by God's grace I will not
[2:01:19] do
[2:01:20] it
[2:01:24] like a sister was
[2:01:26] saying uh I always commit
[2:01:30] adultery he knows
[2:01:33] that if I do that I come back to him and
[2:01:36] ask for foress
[2:01:38] normal do you think it's a
[2:01:41] confession there is no nothing showing
[2:01:44] that you are
[2:01:46] sorry that's why you continue to do
[2:01:50] it let me with
[2:01:53] I want you people that are coming
[2:01:57] here or on the
[2:02:00] tape I want you to listen closely now
[2:02:03] for a moment to this
[2:02:08] quotation unless you are deeply
[2:02:14] sincere and you cannot be sincere until
[2:02:17] you are positive
[2:02:20] understanding
[2:02:27] sking to
[2:02:29] 63 you can read it in this
[2:02:34] message paragraph
[2:02:37] 63 I think one of the things that keeps
[2:02:40] our people from being
[2:02:46] healed is the lack of
[2:02:50] confession the lack of sincere
[2:02:55] confession when you go borrow things
[2:02:58] from your
[2:03:00] brother be sincere and if you cannot pay
[2:03:05] it and you go ask for
[2:03:08] apology be also deeply
[2:03:13] sincere and if you are not
[2:03:15] sincere even in your
[2:03:18] confession there will be no
[2:03:20] result and the thing that pre brother
[2:03:23] you know we pray a lot for the
[2:03:25] people and you don't see sometimes
[2:03:29] result it's the lack of sincere
[2:03:34] confession last line on this
[2:03:38] paragraph I have to skip all
[2:03:41] these said I believe in
[2:03:46] confession is straightening up
[2:03:50] also
[2:03:54] I did
[2:03:59] something for it's good to do that said
[2:04:03] I believe in
[2:04:05] confession is straightening up
[2:04:10] also if I that means if I
[2:04:15] stole I am sincere I ask for
[2:04:19] forgiveness I have to restore the thing
[2:04:21] I
[2:04:23] stole that's what he called
[2:04:25] straightening
[2:04:28] up not I did
[2:04:34] something
[2:04:36] when
[2:04:38] telephone he went to

[2:04:45] to the
[2:04:47] creek in that place he was to
[2:04:50] pray he prayed he prayed and he said
