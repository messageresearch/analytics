[50:15] know many Christian believe that it's a
[50:18] good on Good Friday that he was

[50:25] sad they think about what
[50:29] [Music]
[50:34] happened I'm so also happy because I see
[50:37] today people came uh in great number in
[50:39] the
[50:42] church and I believe the Lord Jesus Will
[50:45] Bless You amen
[50:47] amen you know
[50:51] Muslims they are very serious in their
[50:55] religions
[50:58] when they have
[51:04] Ramadan they you see them
[51:09] fasting and you see them going to work
[51:11] but still
[51:16] fasting and they observe every
[51:18] instruction given to
[51:22] them yet they don't have the truth that
[51:24] we
[51:25] have
[51:27] but in this moment as for the
[51:34] Easter it's the time that true Christian
[51:37] can even forsake his work and
[51:42] come because this is even the meaning of
[51:50] Christianity Catholic church and other
[51:52] denomination the the the the the
[51:55] celebrate uh Christ
[53:02] crucifixion we know well in that our
[53:04] scene
[53:07] here when he went up to that mountain
[53:10] called
[53:10] [Music]
[53:14] Olive after coming with a great uh feast
[53:17] in
[53:18] Jerusalem he was sitting on the the the
[53:21] on the top of
[53:24] the because it was the time of
[53:29] Passover he have to
[53:31] enter great uh Triumph in
[53:36] Jerusalem while he was
[53:45] eating Jesus was speaking to disciple
[53:48] the suffering that will come very
[53:51] soon and that
[53:55] night
[53:57] Jesus went away to that
[54:00] mountain and the disciple followed
[54:02] him and when he got
[54:05] there he started
[54:09] praying he prayed prayed
[54:14] again he knew what he was waiting he was
[54:19] expecting he prayed never
[54:22] before to the point
[54:25] where
[54:27] an angel came to comfort
[54:33] him after you understood what would
[54:35] happen in his
[54:40] life he understood that it was a time to
[54:43] die for the all
[54:45] [Music]
[54:47] Humanity every sin that is been
[54:50] [Applause]
[54:52] committed either by Christian or pagans
[54:57] the the sin of the every disease every
[55:00] sickness every wrong thing
[55:03] happening all that was upon
[55:06] him and it was so
[55:09] heavy and while he was
[55:12] praying he felt that
[55:15] suffering to the point when when he was
[55:19] praying the tears become like a
[55:23] blood he suffered so much when he was
[55:26] praying
[55:27] to the point where he said oh Lord
[55:32] father
[55:34] possible take away that
[55:37] cup take away that suffering from me
[55:40] it's
[55:41] painful
[55:43] but in
[55:47] reality he didn't have to
[55:51] die because he didn't he didn't do
[55:53] anything
[55:55] wrong
[55:58] was holy holy holy the Lord of
[56:00] hosts he never committed any
[56:05] sin but here he gave himself to as a
[56:10] sacrifice for the sins of all of us
[56:13] because
[56:14] the because the law was
[56:17] saying when Adam
[56:19] sinned the Lord was
[56:23] saying they saw that that sin the same
[56:27] shall
[56:29] die for that soul to be brought
[56:34] back it took the very same kind of
[56:42] Adam there was no one under born in
[56:47] under that could take the place of
[56:52] Adam to claim the Lost race of
[56:58] that is why God Of
[56:59] Heaven the great
[57:02] elim the one who existed by
[57:09] himself he he
[57:11] came became flesh
[57:15] to and he was given the name of
[57:19] emuel and the Lord Jesus Christ was 100%
[57:23] God and was 100% man
[57:27] here in this
[57:30] scripture while he was praying there in
[57:36] GE that was the
[57:41] manaying you cannot kill
[57:44] God you cannot kill
[57:47] God Jesus was
[57:55] 100%
[57:57] he had to go
[57:59] to the anointing left
[58:02] him the father left him that is why
[58:07] here as a
[58:10] man he started feeling the
[58:13] pain he started
[58:15] understanding that it's
[58:19] hard that is why he was able to
[58:22] say if it possible father
[58:28] nevertheless not my
[58:31] will done be
[58:34] done why he accepted
[58:37] it because he didn't have any
[58:40] choice because he loved
[58:42] you because he loves
[58:45] us before the foundation of the world he
[58:48] saw
[58:51] us and there was nobody to take that
[58:55] place he had to do
[58:59] it now the Bible just told
[59:04] us we will discover things that we have
[59:09] done I know those are things that we
[59:11] already
[59:14] know we won't have time to go
[59:18] deep because I know we already know
[59:20] these
[59:24] things if they did this things to
[59:28] Jesus who is a green
[59:33] tree what will happen to the dry
[59:40] tree if Jesus went through all this
[59:46] suffering him who was 100% man 100%
[59:50] God but God did not spare
[59:54] him if he had to enjoy
[59:58] that there is a cross for you and mine
[1:00:02] amen amen
[1:00:07] get speaking
[1:00:11] of thinking about the test and
[1:00:20] trials it was what brother called the
[1:00:23] final test for a son of God
[1:00:27] and each and every one of us has a test
[1:00:30] amen
[1:00:32] amen you know life is
[1:00:39] complicated tests or trials can come in
[1:00:42] various
[1:00:44] ways in our
[1:00:51] trials there's one thing that comforted
[1:00:54] me so
[1:00:55] much
[1:00:58] when Jesus was feeling the pain the
[1:01:00] suffering the Bible
[1:01:03] says an angel came to
[1:01:06] him to comfort him amen
[1:01:11] amen an angel
[1:01:13] came to comfort
[1:01:15] him
[1:01:17] why
[1:01:20] because when somebody's going through
[1:01:25] hardship
[1:01:28] God had to send an angel to comfort
[1:01:32] him trials are in various
[1:01:37] ways a single person like
[1:01:42] me you can think you need to get
[1:01:47] married single person has his own

[1:04:33] communion
[1:04:37] communion bam is showing
[1:04:43] us you know trials and
[1:04:51] test when Jesus was
[1:04:54] feeling What would happened to
[1:04:57] him as a human being he said this I
[1:05:03] cannot take
[1:05:05] it but never let your will be
[1:05:11] done and for
[1:05:13] him it was the final
[1:05:16] test
[1:05:18] said if God didn't SP the Lord Jesus
[1:05:24] himself
[1:05:36] April 18
[1:05:39] 19 paragraph
[1:05:48] 22
[1:05:52] 22 okay now
[1:05:56] no this great hour has approached our
[1:06:01] Lord one of the most trying time of all
[1:06:06] of his he joury was just a
[1:06:17] [Music]
[1:06:20] hand broken English don't mind my broken
[1:06:24] English
[1:06:27] you can read along with me and he
[1:06:30] said testing
[1:06:33] time Jesus had to go through
[1:06:38] testing just as we go through
[1:06:44] testing do you see that Jesus go to
[1:06:48] tting as we go
[1:06:54] toting the Bible said that every son
[1:06:58] that come to
[1:07:00] God must first be
[1:07:03] tested trained
[1:07:08] corrected now many
[1:07:10] people is it a showdown when the testing
[1:07:14] time
[1:07:18] comes it is a time of a uh providing
[1:07:24] place
[1:07:28] and the Bible says if we cannot stand
[1:07:32] the
[1:07:36] testing then we become illegitimate
[1:07:44] children we are professing God to be our
[1:07:49] father and then he's not our
[1:07:53] father for if we have correctly and with
[1:07:59] all of our heart received the Lord Jesus
[1:08:03] as our personal
[1:08:09] savior there is nothing in this earth or
[1:08:13] in all dark eternity can ever separate
[1:08:17] us from the love of God that is Christ
[1:08:24] Jesus
[1:08:30] amen amen amen
[1:08:34] amen that was the final test for
[1:08:39] Jesus we all going through the same
[1:08:44] testes paragraph
[1:08:50] 24 it's different it's
[1:08:54] different
[1:09:01] I'm using uh the voice of God
[1:09:08] version okay let's continue
[1:09:14] 24 I'm ased in this
[1:09:19] day and have always been when people
[1:09:22] profess to be
[1:09:24] Christian
[1:09:27] and the first little try come
[1:09:30] on they fall by wise
[1:09:35] side it goes to show that it was
[1:09:39] intellectual conception of
[1:09:44] Christ that's the reason so many doesn't
[1:09:48] hold out
[1:09:53] today is because it intellectual
[1:09:58] conception
[1:10:00] intellectually you could believe
[1:10:04] it but it goes further than
[1:10:10] that to accept
[1:10:14] Christ is to accept the person of
[1:10:19] Christ
[1:10:22] amen when the test comes
[1:10:26] [Music]
[1:10:29] as the Bible says trials are precious
[1:10:31] more than
[1:10:33] gold when God is sending us
[1:10:36] through he has a
[1:10:39] purpose you know God knows us
[1:10:43] better it's not trials comes to kill
[1:10:47] us trials will
[1:10:50] come but you shall not
[1:10:54] die has a purpose for everything that
[1:10:57] you're going
[1:11:00] through God can send you to the bed of
[1:11:04] Affliction so that when he's going to
[1:11:06] heal
[1:11:09] you you will have something to tell the
[1:11:11] devil that God
[1:11:14] [Applause]
[1:11:15] Amen continues by
[1:11:19] saying in the same
[1:11:21] mess paragraph 28 and Jesus was here
[1:11:26] conforting the greatest test that he had
[1:11:30] ever had
[1:11:33] getson
[1:11:41] him where that once a h once and final
[1:11:47] all CZ test must
[1:11:54] come where the burden of entire
[1:11:59] world laid upon his blessed
[1:12:04] shoulder there was no one in all Heaven
[1:12:08] and Earth could ever stop
[1:12:16] him and to know that all of the
[1:12:21] sins listen to this and to know that all
[1:12:25] of the
[1:12:26] sins of the
[1:12:29] past and the
[1:12:31] present and the
[1:12:33] future rested upon his
[1:12:37] decision so if he didn't make that
[1:12:42] decision then we don't have any
[1:12:46] forgiveness praise
[1:12:48] God and it was one of the most greatest
[1:12:53] victory that Christ ever
[1:12:56] [Music]
[1:12:59] won Pro his
[1:13:00] [Applause]
[1:13:02] gra M and words he said that to
[1:13:07] [Laughter]
[1:13:11] God my
[1:13:13] will that be
[1:13:17] done oh my that was the greatest Victory
[1:13:22] he has ever won
[1:13:28] all the
[1:13:29] demon of
[1:13:31] T was around to T
[1:13:35] him and to try him and when he get right
[1:13:40] and when we get right with
[1:13:44] God when our
[1:13:46] hearts become pure and the Holy Ghost
[1:13:51] has taken its place in our
[1:13:54] hearts it's the most glorious thing to
[1:13:57] have
[1:14:00] testing the Bible tell
[1:14:02] us that our testing and trials are more
[1:14:08] precious to us than silver and gold in
[1:14:12] this
[1:14:16] world so we are should be
[1:14:22] [Music]
[1:14:24] thankful let somebody tell
[1:14:27] God Lord I Thank you for my trials amen
[1:14:32] hallelujah I thank you for the
[1:14:35] trials I know behind the trials you

[1:14:50] hly he was more than
[1:14:54] the
[1:14:57] than he was more than the queen
[1:15:00] of
[1:15:04] Britain but he didn't look at his
[1:15:07] quality his
[1:15:09] position but he accepted the
[1:15:12] shame to the point
[1:15:14] where the King of
[1:15:17] Kings the creator of
[1:15:20] heav died on the cross
[1:15:24] naked
[1:15:28] amen he died there stripped
[1:15:31] naked
