[44:47] bit before I take the scripture tonight
[44:57] I want to remind the vision that Willam
[44:59] bam saw about the
[45:04] bride was in
[45:08] 1964 he saw the bride going to in front
[45:11] of
[45:13] him see that bride was
[45:17] perfect she was going with uh you know
[45:20] the uh the steps of the
[45:23] word and then she was going in front of
[45:26] him
[45:31] and after after the bride he also saw
[45:33] the he saw other people coming as
[45:36] well he said that those people were
[45:41] horrible or they resemble to
[45:44] prostitute and he started to
[45:48] cry he said his heart almost stopped he
[45:53] said Lord
[46:00] is this the result of my work and my
[46:02] colleagues work to prepare the
[46:05] bride as he was
[46:08] weeping a voice told him and I'm going
[46:10] to say to the birth
[46:14] pain January 24
[46:19] 1965 and the voice told him the bride
[46:22] will come
[46:24] again I like the word to come again
[46:29] again you know the churches when they
[46:31] walked in they didn't go back
[46:36] again when dation fall it will never
[46:38] rise up
[46:40] again amen when the church went the
[46:44] bride
[46:45] went she had to go back again the second
[46:49] time he said paragraph
[46:52] 143 and
[46:55] 144 and
[47:01] suddenly I heard that sweet music that
[47:04] was coming
[47:06] back I I like the word coming
[47:09] back and
[47:14] see the same little bride was coming
[47:18] back it's not
[47:21] another it's the same bride that was
[47:23] going in front of

[49:48] here that the elah of Malachi
[49:54] 4 was not just sent for the the first
[49:57] coming of the
[49:59] Lord but also for the coming back of the

[51:25] days as they turn the Child Jesus stried
[51:28] behind in Jerusalem and Joseph and his
[51:30] mother knew not of it but they suppos
[51:33] they supposing him to have been in the
[51:36] company when a day uh a Day's Journey
[51:39] and they sought him among the king's
[51:41] folk and acquaintance and when they
[51:45] found him not they turned back again to
[51:48] Jerusalem seeking
[51:53] him I want I want to tell in re uh
[51:58] researching Jesus or looking for Jesus
[52:00] you may be
[52:01] seated looking for
[52:05] Jesus but just keep the vision that in
[52:07] your in your
[52:13] mind the Revival start when you notice
[52:17] that you are not with Jesus
[52:19] Anymore are we together I
[52:25] repeat the Revival starts when you begin
[52:28] to notice that you don't have Jesus with
[52:33] you you can walk without him without
[52:36] knowing or notic that the Bible
[52:40] says the day was long
[52:44] gone and Mary and Joseph didn't see him
[52:50] amen you know days went
[52:53] by they thought they had Jesus with them

[53:01] them and at least they noce that you
[53:05] know it wasn't with
[53:09] them amen it was the grace of God for
[53:12] them to notice that they didn't have
[53:13] Jesus with
[53:15] them because if you don't have
[53:18] him and you think you have
[53:21] him you're not going to look for
[53:24] him but when you know is that you don't
[53:27] have
[53:27] him you're going to look for
[53:30] him and what's good with
[53:33] Jesus when you living
[53:36] somewhere it's not going to go anywhere
[53:38] else it's still going to be at the same
[53:41] place if you go back where you found him
[53:47] amen that's why we we talking about
[53:49] looking for
[53:51] Jesus we cannot find him somewhere
[53:54] [Music]

[55:57] someone can be very
[55:58] sincere thinking that he is with Jesus
[56:01] while he's not with them amen

[56:08] stop to
[56:10] verify and to notice that you're not
[56:14] with
[56:15] him you're going to go and look for
[56:18] him that's why they had to go back to go
[56:21] look for

[56:26] telling someone
[56:28] tonight don't think that you are with
[56:32] Jesus be sure that you are with Him amen
[56:37] my brother and sisters he said Mary and
[56:39] Joseph you
[56:41] know when they was up to the
[56:44] feast Jesus had 12 years
[56:47] old they
[56:49] thought
[56:51] presuming he was with
[56:53] them but he wasn't
[56:56] do you understand what I
[56:59] mean don't presume that you are with
[57:03] him be sure and certain that you are

[57:13] same
[57:14] thing they think they have
[57:17] Jesus while they don't have
[57:21] him these people that organized in this
[57:23] Council of churches
[57:27] these people in this
[57:29] organization they think they're good
[57:31] they're doing good
[57:32] [Music]
[57:36] thing they presuming is with them when
[57:38] they're not
[57:41] see many
[57:47] people think that he was with them when
[57:50] they shook hands with the
[57:53] preacher and put the name on the book
[57:58] when they counting among the
[57:59] members when they go and Sh the hands of
[58:02] the
[58:03] pastor thought they had
[58:08] Jesus they
[58:11] didn't many people
[58:14] thought when they were
[58:16] sprinkled
[58:19] confirmed baptized in the name of father
[58:22] son Holy Ghost they thought they they
[58:24] had him
[58:27] said the good
[58:29] people Mary and
[58:33] Joseph was good
[58:35] people but the fact
[58:38] was he wasn't
[58:42] there said do not presume anything
[58:47] amen I imagine Joseph and Mary they were
[58:52] talking since the scripture talk in
[58:54] Matthew 18
[58:57] verse
[59:01] 20 whatever two or three are Gather in
[59:03] my name I shall be in the
[59:04] me he say since we are
[59:08] together we believe according to the
[59:10] scripture he is with
[59:12] us I want someone to notice
[59:15] something that the presence of Jesus
[59:19] Christ it's very it's way far than the
[59:23] Scripture it is a reality
[59:27] there were two as the scripture
[59:30] said and Jesus was not with them do you
[59:34] understand what I
[59:35] mean just the fact to be two or
[59:38] according to the
[59:40] scripture it's not the fact that Jesus
[59:43] is with
[59:44] you you only have the the
[59:47] scripture you're just repeating the
[59:50] script that is not with you and many
[59:54] times we say
[59:57] or we are Jesus is with
[1:00:00] us I want us to understand another
[1:00:03] another
[1:00:05] way I don't want us to just repeat the
[1:00:10] scripture Jesus was not with
[1:00:14] them while they were two as the
[1:00:17] scripture say amen
[1:00:20] amen his presence is a
[1:00:23] reality it's more than a scripture

[2:06:47] presence
[2:06:49] somewhere along the journey
[2:06:51] [Music]
[2:06:53] you lost that
[2:06:54] [Music]

[2:07:35] think come to
[2:07:37] [Music]
[2:07:40] pass I could go to bed and dream
[2:07:43] spiritual
[2:07:49] things since a certain time

[2:08:04] me where I left
[2:08:07] you and by your

[2:08:15] courage to turn and go where I left
[2:08:19] Jesus
[2:08:22] he is a merciful
[2:08:25] god he's there waiting for
[2:08:29] you he want that power that you had
[2:08:37] once to be
[2:08:43] restored is there
[2:08:46] anyone who feel that way

[2:08:59] hand this is the absolute
[2:09:02] [Music]
[2:09:03] truth I have left you

[2:09:10] made
[2:09:14] tonight not anyone called
[2:09:18] me but you did
[2:09:21] and if it's
[2:09:24] you hear my
[2:09:26] [Music]
[2:09:28] prayer restore me

[2:10:27] story they
[2:10:30] went not paying attention to
