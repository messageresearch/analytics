[42:35] go on to the vessel and drink of that
[42:38] which the young men have drawn
[42:42] universally
[42:56] amen amen
[43:01] it's always a privilege to be in the
[43:03] presence of god
[43:05] experiment
[43:07] experienced and wrote it
[43:10] in
[43:23] because if you're still alive it's
[43:24] because god has hasn't done with us yet
[43:28] that's why we want to thank him for that
[43:33] always like to thank our pastor every
[43:35] time i stand here
[43:41] and especially with this uh subject that
[43:43] i didn't want to preach
[43:48] [Music]
[43:49] the
[43:50] the fair commercial conduit i feel like
[43:52] the way he has given us the liberty to
[43:55] do his god
[43:56] lebanese
[43:57] may god bless him so richly
[44:00] amen amen
[44:06] i don't know if this little subject has
[44:08] blessed someone
[44:10] amen amen
[44:18] we are also waiting tonight to hurt
[44:20] something
[44:37] the four steps of root that the perfect
[44:39] type of a gentile church amen amen
[44:44] we have seen those four steps
[45:02] we had opera
[45:08] rit
[45:09] and ruth
[45:15] and we are sin
[45:16] que
[45:30] because in the gentile church
[45:35] there are those that backslide
[45:38] which is oppa
[45:40] retrograde the backslidden uh believer
[45:44] amen
[45:58] a
[46:06] by speaking about this story
[46:08] length answer the dear the intent of god
[46:11] anus
[46:12] by sending us the message
[46:16] is to typify us as a man amen
[46:21] and we've seen ruth elevate about
[46:24] decision she decided she decided first
[46:28] of all
[46:32] and we have seen the decisions that
[46:34] represent the justification
[46:40] and we have seen the serving the working
[46:42] of ruth or the service
[46:47] the service the service
[46:51] of only apocalypse
[46:54] we
[47:13] as the four steps of redemption for the
[47:15] gentile church
[47:18] [Music]
[47:20] and we have seen
[47:21] ruth resting
[47:23] de boers at the feet of bulls
[47:29] sec
[47:32] which represents the baptism
[47:35] the scientists pray of the holy ghost
[47:39] and the fourth step
[47:42] is the reward of ruth
[48:00] which is the adoption
[48:29] we have a justification
[48:47] if everybody was here in the church
[48:53] as we know each other as a member of the
[48:55] church
[48:58] justification
[49:01] at the uh justification or
[49:03] justification
[49:09] uh i spoke about it for two days but
[49:12] there's still something that but that's
[49:13] still bothering me of
[49:56] exactly the plane of redemption
[49:59] that represents
[50:00] it up the steps
[50:03] of redemption
[50:05] as the church of the gentiles amen
[50:08] that is why god analysis during
[50:38] equals to christ
[50:43] and we are seeing naomi
[50:46] naomi naomi
[51:21] leviticus
[51:29] and then he uh redeemed naomi
[51:33] that's what jesus did
[51:53] [Applause]
[52:30] preaching to the gentiles
[52:32] and brother burnham said
[52:35] now for the gentiles
[52:41] decision
[52:43] to bring the church to the decision
[53:26] uh
[53:40] [Applause]
[53:44] to fulfill the complete plane of
[53:46] redemption
[53:47] [Applause]
[53:48] the brothers are set out of evil in this
[53:50] time that we're living
[53:52] a lot of people in the message
[53:59] [Music]
[54:23] the time is over
[54:24] nozzle only a second problem this we are
[54:26] going to read what brother branham said
[54:29] in the order of the church
[54:33] sorry
[54:35] in 1958
[54:37] 10 seconds
[54:39] uh just check what brother branham said
[54:41] here
[54:43] pagar sank faban md
[54:45] paragraph seven
[54:47] illegal cece he said this
[54:50] nuclear
[54:53] we believe in the justification by faith
[54:59] scripture romans chapter
[55:02] seven verse
[55:04] chapter five
[55:05] roman chapter five
[55:07] first verse
[55:11] we believe when the person is justified
[55:13] by faith
[55:16] he has peace with the lord jesus
[55:18] amen
[55:58] we have to take the decision
[56:00] the justification
[56:12] [Applause]
[56:14] lord jesus set it up
[56:17] that's their brother branham called it
[56:19] just mentioned but then
[56:21] probably it's possible
[56:24] for the very same person
[56:27] you still have the habit of drinking
[56:30] water smoking
[56:32] a fair day the the the show's a sad
[56:35] doing filthy habit
[56:41] if you're still noticing these things in
[56:43] your life
[56:45] in this message
[56:48] it's very are you uh
[56:51] you lie to yourself okay
[56:53] it's very important for me to know how
[56:54] to tap the like steps of grace
[57:31] i believe everybody took a right
[57:33] decision amen
[57:35] if they are still people
[57:37] have a pretty decision correct
[57:41] [Music]
[57:52] strength to reach the adoption amen amen
[57:56] and he continues
[57:59] jesus
[58:00] sanctification and we
[58:02] we believe that the blood of jesus
[58:04] sanctifies the person alvi de la merced
[58:14] and today i'm going to speak about the
[58:16] the second step let's
[58:18] read the serving word
[58:50] william all the life of william branham
[58:53] his life was sanctified
[58:56] he said okay
[59:01] he's a tender against
[59:10] [Music]
[59:30] in
[59:43] until 12
[59:45] but
[59:47] just uh fight with your thoughts
[59:51] try to live a sanctified life
[59:54] totally a person negative in a way that
[59:56] all the negatives
[1:00:13] but to nestle
[1:00:15] it's always focused on christ
[1:00:18] i always turn to the message
[1:00:21] the word prayer brothers say something
[1:00:24] like this sanctify life dancing when
[1:00:40] they
[1:01:08] criticizing
[1:01:37] argument we fight with debate
[1:01:41] for doctrine and every other thing
[1:01:44] what about the sanctified life
[1:01:47] amen amen
[1:01:51] where is the sanctified life basket
[1:01:53] innovation defense because they
[1:01:55] sanctified life most of us as you you
[1:01:57] know jesus jesus
[1:01:59] jesus was just passing by illy passes he
[1:02:02] was just passing by
[1:02:04] you will
[1:02:18] man of god
[1:02:20] just noticed
[1:02:22] a transgender there is a strange
[1:02:24] presence
[1:02:26] in such a way that
[1:02:27] man started crying
[1:02:30] what are you doing here
[1:02:31] what are you doing
[1:02:44] god can help us see the pen
[1:02:55] even those few problems useless problem
[1:02:57] will go away
[1:03:00] diablo
[1:03:53] for the service of the lord
[1:03:56] amen amen
[1:03:58] that's stopped by the justification
[1:04:03] opportunity to read let me read it
[1:04:07] gives the scriptures
[1:04:19] he might sanctify the people with his
[1:04:22] own blood i suffer all about suffered
[1:04:24] without the gate
[1:04:27] and listen to brother brother
[1:04:30] sanctification and we believe
[1:04:33] that the sanctification is the thought
[1:04:35] in the new testament
[1:04:37] but listen now carefully
[1:04:52] living
[1:04:54] today
[1:04:56] we have to preach the sanctification
[1:04:58] amen amen
[1:05:03] one day when i was preaching somewhere
[1:05:05] yeah listen this person said allah
[1:06:02] that after the

[1:06:34] i will be sincere with god see the
[1:06:36] second if i know
[1:06:38] the sanctification it feels like i'm
[1:06:40] still struggling with jesus
[1:06:42] i'm still the son of god amen amen
[1:06:53] because in this step of justification
[1:06:55] remember sanctification given to this
[1:06:57] notification
[1:06:58] depending
[1:08:36] by number continue but the bottom
[1:08:38] continues paragraph awaits paragraph
[1:08:40] eight
[1:08:42] comes
[1:08:43] as i thought so many times
[1:08:48] it's like picking up a glass out of the
[1:08:50] chicken yard
[1:08:53] justification
[1:08:55] with the fact of picking it up pray
[1:08:59] ready for the use avec and with a
[1:09:02] purpose
[1:09:18] the justification
[1:09:31] is
[1:09:44] he still has a lot of filthiness
[1:09:46] my brother
[1:10:00] when you come this glass is too good
[1:10:05] i will take it
[1:10:06] they get to press out once you take it
[1:10:09] justification that's the justification
[1:10:10] amen amen justification that's
[1:10:13] justification messenger
[1:10:47] [Applause]
[1:11:10] even
[1:11:24] oh
[1:11:31] [Applause]
[1:11:33] you give yourself freely to god tell me
[1:11:36] in such a way
[1:11:50] be happy
[1:11:52] [Applause]
[1:12:07] of view problem this becomes a problem
[1:12:13] especially if it's uh unfortunate
[1:12:18] it might happen
[1:13:02] because
[1:13:43] [Applause]
[1:14:12] the one that is
[1:14:14] got a way to justify him dear pelipe god
[1:14:16] can lose him uh no
[1:14:19] sorry
[1:14:24] he can miss the heavens
[1:14:26] he can miss the rupture
[1:14:28] silver
[1:14:30] if he makes mistake here
[1:14:35] because abba is sovereign
[1:14:40] but the one who's in adoption
[1:14:43] god is in him medan called fable but in
[1:14:46] a weekly body
[1:14:48] body
[1:14:49] he'll be committed
[1:14:51] he can make mistake
[1:14:52] amen amen may say louis
[1:14:58] [Applause]
[1:15:05] the mistake that the person that can do
[1:15:08] at that step of adoption be careful
[1:15:12] if you make fun of them those mistakes
[1:15:16] it can be complicated for your life
[1:15:21] that's the reason why we see the
[1:15:22] deepening nowhere the type of noah
[1:15:24] malgreen
[1:15:26] despite being
[1:15:27] said
[1:15:28] but what he has said
[1:15:31] realism it happened
[1:15:34] amen
[1:15:36] amen
[1:16:19] objective you had a person
[1:16:21] because you wanted to use it
[1:16:24] and nobody's burned yet
[1:16:30] god wanted to use us amen
[1:16:47] after cleansing it secular what happened
[1:16:50] say proper it's clean now amen amen
[1:16:56] but you cannot use it right away amen
[1:16:59] amen say prop it's clean before
[1:17:13] it's it's a glass that had a dirtiness
[1:17:17] on it second was that effect
[1:17:20] you're going to take that glass
[1:17:25] are you going to burn it
[1:17:27] remember
[1:18:21] there was a heart who has uh had a
[1:18:23] serpent inside eh
[1:18:38] that's what produces evil when we we
[1:18:41] born amen amen
[1:18:43] what happened

[1:19:45] church
[1:19:48] but when he sees god blessing another
[1:19:50] brother
[1:19:50] he starts saying ah

[1:19:55] why only him
[1:19:58] i studied this word before but why only
[1:20:00] here
[1:20:01] you see

[1:21:15] to see because
[1:21:17] that person was promoted
[1:21:19] he started singing
[1:21:21] really
[1:21:23] he did he buy a house
[1:21:41] he prefers nearly you can spend years in
[1:21:44] the church
[1:21:47] rise up again
[1:21:48] that won't change
[1:21:50] that serpent needs to be killed
[1:21:54] that is why we need a fire divine fire

[1:23:42] objective that is the purpose of god
[1:23:45] when god called us loses defeat he
[1:23:48] justifies network he cleans us
[1:23:51] and he wants to use you
[1:23:53] to lose he wants to use the level
