[0:30] the bible says
[0:36] blessed is the man that walked not in
[0:38] the counsel of the ungodly
[0:40] no standeth in the way of
[0:42] sinners nor seated in the seat of the
[0:45] scornful
[0:47] but his delight is in the law of the
[0:50] lord
[0:51] and in his law that they meditate day
[0:54] and night
[0:56] and it shall be like a tree planted by
[0:58] the rivers of water
[1:00] that bring us forth his fruit in his
[1:02] season
[1:03] his leaf also shall not wither
[1:06] and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper
