[38:04] we support it
[38:08] meditate they meditate so that it
[38:11] becomes life
[38:13] second Chronicle chapter 29 The Chronic
[38:17] shape of an effort
[38:22] uh we're just going to take chapter
[38:26] verse 10 and 11.
[38:32] second Chronicle chapter 29 the
[38:34] colleague
[38:36] verse 11 actually 10 and 11.
[38:40] now it is mine heart to make a covenant
[38:44] with the Lord God of Israel
[38:46] that his first Wrath may turn away from
[38:51] us
[39:00] be not be not now negligent
[39:04] for the Lord has chosen you to stand
[39:07] before him to serve him and that you
[39:10] should Minister unto him and burn
[39:13] incense
[39:24] we read second Peter chapter one
[39:29] verse 12 to 16 the verse says
[39:36] wherefore I will not be negligent to put
[39:39] you always in remembrance of these
[39:41] things though you know them and be
[39:44] established in the present truth
[39:47] is
[39:54] yeah I think it meet as long as I am in
[39:58] the Tabernacle to stir up
[40:00] to stir you up by putting you in
[40:03] remembrance
[40:11] knowing that shortly I must put off this
[40:14] my Tabernacle even as our Lord Jesus
[40:16] Christ has showed me
[40:24] moreover I will endeavor that you may be
[40:27] able after my disease to have these
[40:30] things always in remembrance
[40:36] so we have not follow cunningly device
[40:39] Fable when we made known unto you the
[40:42] power and coming of our Lord Jesus
[40:44] Christ but we are witness of his
[40:47] majestyles
[41:01] amen amen you may be seated
[41:04] take the comfort of your seat
[41:08] Well I remain standing yeah
[41:12] [Laughter]
[41:17] um
[41:18] it's almost seven uh say press cage is
[41:21] never
[41:22] uh
[41:24] we're speaking of decision
[41:27] and decision is uh something very
[41:31] important
[41:32] for us Believers we will know choir as
[41:36] we spoke about Samson
[41:39] and we spoke about Joseph Joseph and
[41:43] there is just so many examples in the
[41:45] Bible if you are a Bible reader yes
[41:51] and I hope
[41:53] that all that we have found in the word
[41:56] of God
[41:58] you can go and dig deeper
[42:03] deeper to understand
[42:06] because the Bible is not just a history
[42:09] of the Jews
[42:15] God wrote for us
[42:18] so it's not something that you read you
[42:21] remember it years and years and years
[43:00] but I just want to add a little bit of
[43:02] something in there
[43:05] what hinder a Christian to make a good
[43:10] decisions
[43:16] it's good to make decisions
[43:19] what hinders a Christian passionately
[43:22] you make decisions
[43:24] everything that we spoke about
[43:27] making the right decision
[43:31] but there is certain things in our lives
[43:35] there is quite a few but I'm just
[43:37] picking up one yeah
[43:40] and that thing or that element or item
[43:44] whatever you want to call it settlements
[43:48] it's called negligence
[43:52] negligence is one of the things
[43:56] when it comes into a Christian Life
[44:00] or in any human being
[44:03] it will cause you to make wrong
[44:06] decisions
[44:09] always full-time wrong decision more
[44:12] first decision once you become negligent
[44:15] and many times as Christians
[44:18] will become negligent
[44:20] without knowing that that Spirit already
[44:24] got you wrapped up hey
[44:28] but we see in chronicle here the king
[44:31] Hezekiah is telling his people and
[44:34] foreign
[44:35] [Music]
[44:56] [Music]
[45:16] don't forget the reason that God called
[45:20] you foreign
[45:38] this is the reason you are calling
[45:40] yourself the Bride of Jesus Christ
[45:48] it's given to you for a purpose
[45:55] I'm a husband
[45:59] I'm a teenager yesterday
[46:04] you are not just there for the sake of
[46:07] being there
[46:09] Avengers to feel the Earth
[46:12] no no no no no no no there is a purpose
[46:15] yeah and Peter God did not make you an
[46:18] insect Journey
[46:20] God did not make you a fly and for love
[46:24] he made known a fly
[46:26] whatever that is
[46:49] [Applause]
[46:49] [Music]
[47:14] [Music]
[47:25] they will chase them in somebody
[47:56] do you believe that is
[48:55] [Music]
[48:57] you serve him
[49:07] attitude of considering something not
[49:11] important
[49:14] that's not important you might not say
[49:17] it but your action will prove
[49:21] it's not important negligence
[49:27] develops carelessness it's a Developers
[49:32] carelessness
[49:34] someone just become careless
[49:37] I don't care what comes what goes
[49:41] that's not an attitude of a Christian
[49:44] a Christian is careful down and he cares
[49:48] about everything
[49:50] amen amen negligence
[49:53] comes from discouragement
[49:56] [Music]
[49:57] when someone is become negligence
[50:03] it's because they were discouraged about
[50:07] something
[50:09] and discouragement
[50:11] brings them to the state of negligence
[50:16] amen amen what causes discouragement
[50:20] I can follow this stuff way back from
[50:23] prayer but I don't have the time to go
[50:25] all the way
[50:27] discouragement is caused because by
[50:32] unfulfilled events in your life the pal
[50:35] effect
[50:35] shows I was trying this is
[50:44] said yeah
[50:45] as soon as you say that
[50:48] that's discouragement I don't feel like
[50:51] trying anymore
[50:56] I try everything
[51:01] nothing happened
[51:03] whatever comes comes
[51:07] this that discouraged
[51:10] once you get there
[51:13] negligence
[51:17] and whatever happens
[51:20] you don't care
[51:22] because I tried never worked and many
[51:26] times that's where many of us believe
[51:29] are in is
[51:34] founded to be one of the worst thing
[51:37] that can happen to a Christian
[51:41] when someone backslide it's
[51:50] when someone does not uh uh or start to
[51:55] fail in school
[51:57] discouragement something happened once
[52:02] you are discouraged you become negligent
[52:05] value for liver you can't read anymore
[52:08] but it does not mean anything then I
[52:12] don't like that
[52:13] why you don't like the teacher because
[52:16] you are discouraged
[52:19] amen amen negligence will develop
[52:23] laziness
[52:26] and laziness is someone who's not firm
[52:30] confident
[52:33] someone who's not settled
[52:37] and when you become a lazy
[52:41] you become irresponsible for definitely
[52:44] responsible towards the situation you
[52:48] start blaming others
[52:51] because of them
[52:54] you are a liar you made your own
[52:57] decisions
[52:58] stop blaming people
[53:00] stop being a child
[53:04] grow up God you say take on the
[53:07] responsibility
[53:10] man I carry the responsibilities

[1:01:20] amen let's move on the Bible says in
[1:01:25] Acts uh
[1:01:27] let me jump this
[1:01:30] we we found here in the book of um
[1:01:33] uh Exodus
[1:01:36] something very important
[1:01:39] Exodus chapter 32.
[1:01:41] just to give you a background of what
[1:01:44] happened
[1:01:47] from Exodus 24 are part of the Exotic to
[1:01:52] Exodus 31.
[1:01:55] God Called Moses
[1:01:58] and he called the uh the the elders he
[1:02:02] called Aaron and
[1:02:06] abiu and 70 elders
[1:02:10] he says come up on the mountain and I
[1:02:13] will talk to you
[1:02:16] yesterday
[1:02:18] and Moses called all the elders and they
[1:02:22] went up the mountains and as they were
[1:02:24] going
[1:02:26] to take three people
[1:02:33] and the 70 elders
[1:02:36] but as they were going Allah Moses added
[1:02:40] Joshua um
[1:02:43] this is a very important I'm not going
[1:02:45] to go into that
[1:02:47] he I took Joshua with him
[1:02:51] that that means it was a little bit of
[1:02:54] trust there is
[1:02:57] God did not call Joshua God was clear
[1:03:02] but Moses also made a decision
[1:03:06] Joshua Joshua come with me
[1:03:09] because there were certain things that's
[1:03:12] potential only you should know okay
[1:03:15] and they went up they got to a certain
[1:03:19] place on the mountains
[1:03:21] Moses tells the elders and the
[1:03:24] three-year-old Aaron and Abby you
[1:03:26] another
[1:03:30] um
[1:03:33] I will go further and he grabbed Joshua
[1:03:37] both of them went up and if you read the
[1:03:41] story and that's when God started to
[1:03:44] talk to Moses about the Tabernacles
[1:03:58] because Moses was there for 40 years
[1:04:01] foreign
