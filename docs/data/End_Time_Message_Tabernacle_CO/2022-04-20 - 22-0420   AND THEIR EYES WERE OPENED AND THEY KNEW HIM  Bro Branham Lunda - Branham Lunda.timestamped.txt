[37:06] ministry
[37:34] all the influence
[38:13] today we're gonna read in luke chapter
[38:15] 24.
[38:30] we read in the name of lord jesus christ
[38:43] allah
[38:54] and it came to pass as he said admit
[38:57] with them he took bread and blessed it
[39:00] and break it and gave it gave it to them
[39:04] and their eyes were opened and they knew
[39:07] him and he vanished out of their sights
[39:12] you may be seated
[39:16] the blessing of the reading of the word
[39:18] amen amen calisthenics
[39:21] may the lord bless you jerusalem
[39:24] in the name of lord jesus christ
[39:27] mercy
[39:28] opportunity
[39:31] thank you for the opportunity to be
[39:32] alive again tonight
[39:36] may the glory and honor goes to our lord
[39:39] merciful
[39:43] thank you thanks again to our beloved
[39:45] pastor uh
[39:50] for always to have that coaching spirit
[39:53] letter to give us
[40:08] repeat what brother brenham said
[40:18] this message uh and the eyes were open
[40:20] and they recognized them amen
[40:33] just to help us tonight to carry on the
[40:36] journey
[40:39] benediction
[40:40] i believe it's going to be a blessing
[40:42] for everyone
[40:44] because brother burnham said
[40:50] it just depends of your attitude
[40:56] the bible says everything is possible to
[40:59] god
[41:01] and to the one that believes
[41:04] yes and i always cut it simple
[41:07] i always say
[41:08] possibly
[41:11] everything is possible to you if you
[41:13] believe
[41:16] because god has already done everything
[41:47] we make the promise of god to be
[41:49] fulfilled for you amen amen
[41:52] therefore tonight we're here
[41:56] we want god to speak to us a little bit
[41:58] uh
[42:00] certainly
[42:10] when the pastor asked me to say
[42:12] something disabled
[42:28] people married
[42:30] [Music]
[43:11] no he's no longer here
[43:17] that fellow looked like a man but he was
[43:19] a heavily heavenly angel
[43:23] he told them like the master is known
[43:25] yeah
[43:26] he's already risen
[43:30] and the woman left the tomb
[43:33] they went to this the disciples hey
[43:35] elizabeth and they told the disciples
[43:38] our
[44:06] he went all the way to the tomb
[44:08] and you see really
[44:11] the thing was real amen amen
[44:17] peter was among the the elders
[44:34] with experience
[44:48] he
[45:03] some people
[45:06] that spend a lot of time in the lord
[45:09] not with a bad testimony
[45:13] by the people that you know that they
[45:15] have the holy ghost they live correct
[45:30] it's true god can use us
[45:36] unprecedented the experience that
[45:39] for people that uh before us
[45:43] we need to respect that amen amen
[45:47] this is the law of god
[45:49] that's the only way to be blessed
[45:53] we don't want to see someone who just
[45:55] started
[45:56] and then you say wow
[46:09] elisha that was talking about that
[46:11] typified the church
[46:26] accepted the coaching of the elder
[46:29] cellar developer
[46:32] he had to take 10 years
[46:35] so that they are known
[46:37] because they are known
[46:38] from one person to another you can only
[46:41] give what you have
[46:44] the anointing that was upon elijah
[46:47] went to elisha
[46:48] [Applause]
[46:49] if elisha said ah no no no
[46:52] don't i have my guess
[47:09] gift
[47:10] that's a complaint to complete each
[47:12] other
[47:12] a gift
[47:14] to coach another gift says
[47:17] always been like that
[47:20] you're gonna take moses
[47:22] [Applause]
[47:36] i don't know why i'm talking about this
[47:39] survived i i believe that will have
[47:41] something joshua
[47:44] was the moses servant
[47:47] why moses has to be moses servant joseph
[47:50] servant
[48:04] listen
[48:07] he doesn't do nothing for no reason
[48:11] we found out later on yeah
[48:15] god looked he did not he said no
[48:18] i found
[48:31] take
[48:32] joshua because he was always on your
[48:35] side
[48:36] he was subjected to what you were doing
[48:40] this is why
[48:42] joshua
[48:45] is
[48:51] [Applause]
[49:00] because the soldiers romans soldiers
[49:06] actually they were there to keep the the
[49:08] tomb
[49:11] they had the courage to go
[49:14] and he saw that he wasn't there
[49:17] and then he could come back and tell the
[49:18] people it's true that it is risen amen
[49:21] amen
[49:23] and people with discrimination
[49:25] since people were discouraged allah said
[49:28] you ship
[49:56] a prophet
[50:09] the message lfc
[50:12] and the eyes were opened and they knew
[50:15] him

[50:38] 1990 of
[50:49] i want to read
[50:50] the
[50:51] paragraph third
[50:53] something that brother venom is saying
[50:59] everything that jesus promised
[51:02] and it's the word of god
[51:04] if he said get down
[51:06] the
[51:20] the world that we see
[51:48] a super connected spiritually they are
[51:51] not spiritually connected let's just
[51:53] spiritual the spiritual eyes the perfect
[51:55] pathways they cannot see jesus

[52:01] world
[52:07] [Applause]
[52:39] [Applause]
[52:41] [Music]
[53:12] and i believe
[53:18] we are people that didn't make a choice
[53:20] to be condemned
[53:22] but for those
[53:24] who would come
[53:26] and hear the words
[53:54] just park in this building
[53:58] you never come just to be seen amen amen
[54:04] i didn't care i didn't come here just to
[54:05] listen
[54:07] i also believe you didn't come to be
[54:08] seen but i'm continuing
[54:12] on in my own eyes
[54:16] sensei you've come with a sincerity of
[54:18] your heart
[54:20] a pleasant team i think it was a walk
[54:22] with god okay these are men let somebody
[54:25] say amen
[54:26] this is why you live away from here
[54:31] personally
[54:33] a better person than you was when you

[54:46] it's always been my prayer before going
[54:48] to church
[54:49] lord speak to me
[54:51] amen amen basket because
[54:55] [Music]
[54:57] it's always when we're waiting on him
[54:58] and we will see a manifesto
[55:00] that's when it appears to us amen amen
[55:03] from what i'm continuing with
[55:32] amen amen
[55:36] on sunday
[55:39] it happened that they were a great
[55:41] anointing
[55:45] and something came to me
[56:08] [Applause]
[56:23] i'm telling you it was terrible it was
[56:26] tremendous
[56:43] from you know brother branham said
[56:47] benny visit every time one god visits

[57:03] that's why tonight
[57:06] i want to raise the faith in your life

[59:16] is
[59:27] all your problem has to disappear but
[59:29] never decides brother branham said
[59:44] to bring
[59:57] there's much result
[59:59] se per second it's because legends
[1:00:02] people are used to avec le pastel
[1:00:07] of brenham tabernacle
[1:00:09] and tonight
[1:00:11] i want us to understand
[1:00:39] may god help us to understand this
