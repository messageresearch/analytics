[7:15] it's not something that is granted
[7:20] advance
[7:21] many people have traveled boku dejan on
[7:25] viaje and never had an
[7:27] opportunity to see again their family
[7:30] members
[7:32] opportunity they reward their family
[7:34] they are accidents all over the places
[7:37] and things yeah
[7:41] but we thank god for his protection in
[7:45] remembrance of protection
[7:47] we did really it was a
[7:50] quick
[7:52] travel
[7:54] voyage
[7:56] and uh things did not work the way
[8:00] we planned
[8:05] so we end up
[8:07] doing a lot of travels between our
[8:10] friends and the belgium
[8:12] finish
[8:14] and california
[8:16] and that really made us very very tired
[8:20] of fatigue
[8:22] and i have also made a commitment that
[8:25] last sunday i had to preach it
[8:29] somewhere in paris
[8:35] but i did it but it was not easy with
[8:38] the travel we have to do
[8:42] it
[8:46] but by god grace it was done
[8:51] and uh many brothers and sisters ever
[8:54] signed their great things to you
[8:56] a book would affect yourself
[9:00] and um
[9:02] we thank god for traveling mercies
[9:06] our
[9:08] and i thank also brother branham for
[9:11] taking the services
[9:14] foreign
[9:18] [Applause]
[9:23] but it's not an easy job
[9:26] facile it takes a lot of sacrifices even
[9:29] for my ministers to prepare
[9:32] supplements
[9:40] he came from work i believe
[9:43] uh working saturday until a sunday
[9:46] morning
[9:48] travail
[10:07] sometimes personally i feel very very
[10:10] bad to
[10:12] ask
[10:13] the local ministers to bring the word
[10:17] the former oceania
[10:19] maldives
[10:22] knowing what they go through
[10:27] some they don't sleep all night
[10:30] certainly
[10:45] so
[10:46] tonight i felt also myself very very
[10:50] tired
[10:54] and i could not bring the word professor
[10:58] i really wanted to rest
[11:01] my mind
[11:02] so tonight
[11:05] we are going to listen to the message
[11:10] a sermon that we have
[11:12] already listened here essentially
[11:17] on the rapture
[11:19] level
[11:20] and uh
[11:22] god has placed that in my heart
[11:25] j a places
[11:28] knowing the time we are going through
[11:31] connie sanlletta mannequins and passes
[11:34] uh brother sisters
[11:37] further sir we are going through a very
[11:40] very challenging time no
[11:43] trending
[11:48] you have to look around the world
[11:50] regardless
[11:52] to see what is taking place around the
[11:55] world the regard
[11:59] you will see things are moving in a
[12:03] way that uh
[12:05] you cannot understand us
[12:08] shows
[12:14] as you stay at the same spot
[12:20] you don't see what is taking place
[12:23] around the world
[12:28] you will say well it's just the normal
[12:31] routine
[12:34] normal but
[12:36] the way things used to be
[12:40] it's no longer the way it's going to be
[12:45] the world was a
[12:47] shaken without the
[12:50] pandemic le monde tesla pandemi and i'm
[12:54] telling you many things are taking place
[13:00] but all that is taking place
[13:03] it's just a response
[13:07] that
[13:08] the
[13:08] bride has to pay attention to
[13:11] reports
[13:16] there are many things
[13:18] when i was uh in the first in belgium
[13:25] pastor muy i was in the hospital
[13:29] and i was supposed to meet him in
[13:40] and i have to go back to
[13:43] where they are in normandy
[13:48] to visit him
[13:50] to the visible visit
[13:53] but to get into the hospital in the
[13:56] river
[13:57] they require
[13:59] the test
[14:00] existed test
[14:04] in france now
[14:05] advancement now even to go eat at the
[14:08] restaurant memphis
[14:10] restaurant they call it the pass is a
[14:13] personal pass you have to have a proof
[14:16] that you have been vaccinated
[14:20] and there were many groups of people
[14:23] trying to
[14:25] uh stand against the government position
[14:28] he have a
[14:37] and i'm pretty much sure it's going to
[14:40] expand to the entire world asia is
[14:49] even if you are a citizen memphis
[14:52] vosseter american they require the pcr
[14:56] test in demand to your letter
[15:00] and
[15:01] in some countries i heard like canada
[15:05] antonio complete canada they are not
[15:07] requiring a test but they are looking
[15:10] for a full vaccination in norman
[15:13] publishing the test my research
[15:16] is on
[15:17] complete my vaccine but in all of this
[15:20] medium to cc there is a message behind
[15:23] the message there
[15:25] they squeeze
[15:28] the depression the oppression is coming
[15:32] it can tend to veneer that's why i feel
[15:35] like
[15:36] we have to be
[15:38] completely prepared what happens
[15:43] and the things that are taking place
[15:48] we have to have the spiritual
[15:51] discernment
[15:53] spiritual it's no longer a matter of
[15:57] signs since nepean problem descending
[16:00] but it's a matter of preparation satan
[16:03] problem the preparation how do you
[16:05] prepare yourself
[16:19] so tonight
[16:21] says we are going to listen to
[16:24] a message that was preached to us here
[16:27] by brother ben schamel
[16:34] if the projection is ready we can listen
[16:37] to that sermon
[16:43] uh i think it's going to be a blessing
[16:45] for each one of you tonight
[16:48] examples
[16:51] try to
[16:52] understand the content popular
[16:54] confrontation
[16:56] and that's the bottom line
[17:00] the rapture
[17:02] level may god richly bless you
[17:05] forever i'm happy to see sister
[17:08] beatrice boson
[17:13] and uh nicole bosunga sylvie bosunga and

[18:27] amen we just praise the lord
[18:30] we thank you brother for the opportunity
[18:32] to speak with you this morning
[18:35] appreciate the songs and musicians thank
[18:38] you
[18:40] and if you have your scriptures i'd like
[18:42] to just kind of dive into the
[18:45] word right away
[18:49] and i'm still young i get nervous
[18:53] so if i'm going too fast
[18:55] just raise your hand and say slow down
[18:57] slow down
[19:02] amen if you would uh turn with me in
[19:04] your scriptures to romans chapter 8.
[19:20] about a rapture time for the bride amen
[19:25] something that we can really look
[19:26] forward to yeah
[19:28] i was listening to a message this
[19:30] morning
[19:32] and brother branham was talking about
[19:33] how many people don't like talking about
[19:35] the end times
[19:50] it's a happy
[20:03] and it reads like
[20:04] this there is therefore now no
[20:07] condemnation to them which are in christ
[20:10] jesus who walk not after the flesh but
[20:13] after the spirit
[20:26] for the law of the spirit is life in
[20:28] christ jesus
[20:30] for the law of the spirit of life in
[20:32] christ jesus hath made me free from sin
[20:36] free from the law of sin and death
[20:45] and what the law could not do
[20:48] in that it was weak through the flesh
[20:51] god sending his own son in the likeness
[20:54] of sinful flesh and for sin
[20:56] condemned sin in the flesh
[21:12] that the righteousness of the law might
[21:15] be fulfilled in us
[21:17] who walk not after the flesh but after
[21:19] the spirit i thank you like jesus
[21:28] for they that are after the flesh do
[21:29] mind the things of the flesh but they
[21:32] that are after the spirit the things of
[21:34] the spirit
[21:42] for it to be
[21:43] carnally minded is death but to be
[21:46] spiritually minded is life and peace
[21:54] because the carnal in mind is imminent
[21:56] to because the carnal in mind is enmity
[21:59] against god for it is not subject to the
[22:01] law of god neither indeed can be
[22:20] but you are not in the flesh but in the
[22:22] spirit
[22:24] if so be that that spirit of god dwell
[22:26] in you
[22:27] now if any man have not the spirit of
[22:29] christ he is none of his
[22:32] mess
[22:34] who would have made on his faith
[22:48] and if christ be in you the body is dead
[22:51] because of sin but the spirit is life
[22:53] because of righteousness
[23:01] but if the spirit of him that raiseth up
[23:04] jesus from the dead dwell in you
[23:07] he that raised up christ from the dead
[23:10] shall also quicken your mortal bodies by
[23:13] his spirit that dwelleth in you is silly
[23:18] more i beat them
[23:33] lord we come before you this morning
[23:48] but your
[24:03] not just to prove to other people that
[24:05] we're good message believers
[24:08] but lord we've gathered ourselves
[24:10] together today
[24:13] lord that purpose is to grow closer to
[24:15] you
[24:20] the minister's job is to help the
[24:22] christians to grow closer to you
[24:28] and those that aren't christians to make
[24:30] them so ashamed of themselves
[24:37] that's why we're here this morning
[24:40] lord we've read your word
[24:43] we just asked that you would open it to
[24:44] us this morning
[24:46] lord that we wouldn't be blind as the
[24:48] denominations
[24:51] but that we might be able to see you
[24:52] through our scriptures
[24:55] that we wouldn't be reading it as a
[24:56] newspaper
[25:04] we might be able to read these
[25:05] scriptures as they pertain to us today
[25:10] we ask all these things in jesus
[25:11] christ's name
[25:14] amen amen amen you may be seated
[25:18] again we just want to say thank you to
[25:19] brother fosten for the opportunity to
[25:21] come
[25:25] we understand that he's
[25:27] going to a funeral out in new york or
[25:29] somewhere out there
[25:33] but as the scriptures say we don't weep
[25:35] as others that weep
[25:40] because we know that there will be a
[25:41] resurrection
[25:43] for the believers amen
[25:46] amen so
[25:47] here we are a couple days into 2021
[25:53] many of us are very thankful that 2020
[25:56] is in the past
[25:59] year in the year of forgetfulness
[26:04] hey man it was a hard year for me
[26:07] many people when it becomes midnight on
[26:10] january 1.
[26:13] we hear that saying new year new me
[26:18] or as we hear this saying turn a new
[26:20] leaf
[26:22] write
[26:36] we don't want to be the
[26:57] but now we have our our new name of
[26:59] jesus christ
[27:01] amen praise the lord he just ran away so
[27:04] we're not looking for just a new leaf
[27:07] we're looking for a new life
[27:10] amen praise the lord
[27:12] so how will that change come
[27:14] on
[27:15] the scripture says that change will come
[27:17] by his spirit
[27:22] amen and we know that there is a rapture
[27:24] coming for his church
[27:28] and we know that brother branham talks
[27:29] about that change
[28:01] the rapture
[28:03] amen and if that rapture comes
[28:05] then how do we know that we will not
[28:08] miss that right
[28:11] amen amen so brother branham talks uh
[28:14] lots and lots about the seventh church
[28:20] and uh he says in the message rapture
[28:24] in uh december fourth sixty-five
[28:30] so he says now we're living in the
[28:32] seventh church
[28:36] and when the bible said that
[28:39] the seventh church age the city
[28:41] please when the messenger of that 7th
[28:43] church age begins to sound his message
[28:49] that the mysteries of all these things
[28:51] that's been twisted
[28:55] down through the
[28:56] age would be revealed in that time
[29:02] here we see it
[29:04] the son of man coming among his people
[29:09] and doing just exactly
[29:13] confirming his message
[29:16] as he said he would do it
[29:18] and we find it in this last stage
[29:23] amen so we know that that satan can see
[29:25] where where we are
[29:28] satan satan knows that his time is
[29:30] drawing sure
[29:32] so he's doing everything he can to
[29:35] distract us
[29:37] he's doing everything he can to try to
[29:39] draw you away from gatherings
[29:43] last year was such a great example
[29:47] the government shutting down churches
[29:51] saying you can't gather together in the
[29:52] name of
[30:06] in the presence of the lord
[30:09] it's just a distraction from satan
[30:12] we see many churches across the land
[30:16] even message churches
[30:18] they had to shut down
[30:46] coming down through the seven churches
[30:54] because my scripture says
[30:57] it doesn't say uh uh don't come to
[30:59] church
[31:01] or just listening to tapes at home
[31:17] so we should be excited for those prayer
[31:19] meetings
[31:26] [Music]
[31:30] praise the lord do we believe that
[31:33] who got quiet there for a second
[31:36] amen praise the lord he just started
[31:38] away
[31:40] so god so satan can see what god is
[31:42] doing and he will try to distract us
[31:43] allah said satan people
[32:12] see that's satan trying to separate
[32:16] creating division
[32:21] amen brother branham says in the uh
[32:23] flashing red light of his coming
[32:53] we walk across the street and start
[32:55] talking to a neighbor
[32:58] but then you see the flashing red lights
[33:02] and that arm begins to come down
[33:06] what do you know
[33:08] it's a sign
[33:09] [Music]
[33:57] is
[34:18] amen
[34:25] this is 63 june 20 23rd uh
[34:30] says but all of a sudden we see
[34:32] something happen
[34:37] [Music]
[34:41] and when the arm goes down and the light
[34:43] begins to flash
[35:13] you better throw that bag of peanuts
[35:14] down i love the vegetables
[35:17] you stop you're talking
[35:19] you grab your suitcase
[35:22] and you get ready
[35:23] or you're gonna be left behind
[35:26] cause he's just stopping locally for a
[35:28] few moments
[35:43] amen if we flip over to our scriptures
[35:47] he goes to luke chapter 17.
[35:52] and he starts with uh verse 26
[35:54] sacramento verse 7
[35:56] says and this is jesus speaking
[36:00] and he says as it as it was in the days
[36:02] of noah eddie
[36:05] so shall it be also in the days of the
[36:07] son of man and sincerely
[36:22] and the flood came and destroyed them
[36:24] all
[36:39] but that same day that lot was
[36:41] went out of sodom
[36:44] it rained fire and brimstone from heaven
[36:49] and it destroyed them all
[36:52] here we go
[36:54] verse 30
[36:56] even thus shall it be in the day when
[36:59] the son of man is revealed
[37:04] the seventh age lucita
[37:08] amen amen
[37:12] so it took us a profit to show us we're
[37:15] in the seventh age hello city uh
[37:20] university we know
[37:34] before he sends
[37:54] amen the prophet then takes us down to
[37:56] matthew 24.
[38:00] and uh he talks about how the disciples
[38:02] asked jesus three questions
[38:06] and it's incredible to me
[38:09] that when you are listening to the
[38:10] message
[38:12] when he's going through the scriptures
[38:15] he says the disciples asked him three
[38:17] questions
[38:19] and jesus answered their three questions
[38:21] in order
[38:23] but when you go back and you read the
[38:25] scriptures
[38:27] you read verse
[38:28] three
[38:30] where they ask the questions
[38:32] and then he jumps all the way to verse
[38:33] 32.
[38:36] jesus is answering all these questions
[38:40] you see the denominations are blinded to
[38:42] those things
[38:44] so i figured
[39:18] [Music]
[39:39] he knew that you would see the flashing
[39:41] lights
[39:42] and you would drop those peanuts
[39:46] of the world they showed them all and
[39:47] you would run to the stage
[39:50] my lord is coming
[39:52] and i am here ready
[39:53] prepare to go
[40:08] and as he jesus sat at the mount of
[40:10] olives
[40:13] the disciples came into him privately
[40:15] saying
[40:18] number one
[40:20] tell us when these things shall be the
[40:22] new conception
[40:35] three questions
[41:18] even at
[41:32] we've already seen israel gathered in
[41:34] her homeland
[41:36] we see that the sleeping giant of russia
[41:38] getting ready
[41:41] the king of the north
[41:44] getting preparing herself
[41:47] brother branham talks about god has a
[41:49] bride
[41:51] and she's getting herself ready
[41:53] satan also has a bride
[41:55] he's getting herself ready
[41:57] so when you see that other bride is
[41:59] getting herself
[42:14] so shall also the coming of the son of
[42:16] man be and sister
[42:19] and then the prophet takes us all the
[42:21] way back to genesis chapter 6
[42:26] if you want to go through these
[42:28] uh message by message
[42:31] a couple of messages that i would
[42:33] recommend
[42:35] is the rapture
[42:37] the flashing red light of his comments
[42:40] the marriage uh uh of the lamb uh the
[42:44] and the secret going away of the church
[42:49] if you listen to all of those just kind
[42:51] of one after the others
[42:54] so incredible
[42:56] because
[42:57] brother branham just points out where we
[42:59] are today
[43:01] the signs of where we are
[43:03] this was 50 years ago
[43:08] and so look at where we are
[43:21] and then the president gets assassinated
[43:24] the catholic president
[43:35] we've got a so-called goddess as vice
[43:37] president in
[44:06] don't fear communism
[44:24] okay so now we see rome the catholic
[44:26] church
[44:28] making a deal with the jews
[44:32] and then they're going to renege
[45:00] see satan thinks he is
[45:16] because my scripture
[45:24] [Music]
[45:32] so there must be obstacles
[45:36] so that's the bride
[45:38] can become overcomers
[45:41] that's true
[45:42] what does james say uh
[45:58] praise the lord
[46:00] so brother branham takes us back to
[46:02] genesis chapter 6
[46:06] and he says and it came to pass
[46:12] when men began to multiply on the face
[46:14] of the earth
[46:17] and daughters were born unto them
[46:20] and the sons of god
[46:22] saw the daughters of men that they were
[46:24] fair
[46:27] and they took them wives of all which
[46:29] they chose
[46:34] and uh let's go to verse 4.
[46:37] and there were giants in the earth in
[46:39] those days
[46:44] when the sons of god came into the
[46:46] daughters of men
[46:47] did you feel they knew
[46:49] that they bore children
[46:53] the same became mighty men
[47:21] but yet god made sure
[47:28] [Music]
[47:34] why would god say these three or four
[47:36] things
[47:40] because he knew that you
[47:41] saw who would be looking for the sign of
[47:44] his coming
[47:46] so he had to bring a prophet
[47:48] to bring us back to the scriptures
[48:04] then you can know that your redemption
[48:06] is nice
[48:07] i'm sorry
[48:08] so brother branham goes through these
[48:10] things
[48:12] he says when man began to multiply
[48:14] [Music]
[48:16] it's scientific we're multiplying like
[48:18] never
[48:23] mankind is duplicating at a rate
[48:25] you mentioned
[48:28] just as it was in the days of november
[48:31] it's so simple
[48:39] and the sons of god saw the daughters of
[48:41] men that they were fair
[48:46] brother
[48:59] the girls in high schools these days
[49:02] they they can't compare uh
[49:07] to the girls in just school
[49:11] the the women just keep getting prettier
[49:12] and prettier
[49:23] and the sons of god came in unto the
[49:26] daughters of men
[49:30] when the sons of god
[49:34] came in unto
[49:35] the daughters of god
[49:38] sorry the goddess of man
[49:41] is defeated
[49:42] and brother branham says that's not
[49:44] taking them as a wife
[49:48] that's just living with them
[49:50] without the marriage
[49:56] just look at america now
[49:58] just look at the world now
[50:01] that it's so accepted
[50:07] now it's starting to be come to the
[50:09] place is
[50:11] where people don't even think it's
[50:12] important to get married
[50:17] i've heard people tell me
[50:20] what's the point of getting married
[50:23] you can live together we've been so
[50:25] impressed you can raise the family
[50:27] why get married
[50:31] just as it was in the days of noah
[50:34] amen just exactly exactly more
[50:43] amen so
[50:45] multiplying upon the earth
[50:47] women getting prettier and prettier
[50:51] and the sexual uncleanness
[50:54] [Music]
[51:04] he says now something else i had wrote
[51:06] down
[51:20] he said as it was in the days of sodom
[51:23] city
[51:24] remember
[51:26] that
[51:27] men had misused women in such a way
[51:32] until the natural act of life was no
[51:34] more desire
[51:38] he says oh it's awful to say this from
[51:40] from the platform
[51:44] but if there ever was truth
[51:47] it ought to go from here
[52:01] on the increase everywhere
[52:16] to
[52:29] until the desire of it is falling fastly
[52:34] i'll say within another 10 or 15 years
[52:42] it's the way it's increasingly done
[52:54] you'll probably go to jail if you go
[52:55] down to downtown denver and start
[52:56] preaching against it is
[53:26] we must
[53:41] oh no oh no no no no no no
[53:45] there's young people today dealing with
[53:47] homosexual spirits
[53:49] inside the churches
[53:54] and if you don't preach against it it
[53:56] will overcome
[53:59] brother branham says weak pulpits that's
[54:01] the problem
[54:04] juvenile delinquency
[54:06] is
[54:17] we're getting the people nervous in the
[54:19] congregation
[54:19] [Music]
[54:21] we need to forget what people think
[54:36] closer to him
[54:49] amen so we see as it was in the days of
[54:52] noah
[54:56] and we can see ourselves in that day
[55:00] and so it was in the days of noah
[55:03] there was also an enoch
[55:43] enoch was the seventh from adam and now
[55:46] to the city
[55:47] amen you can read that in genesis 5 and
[55:50] 6.
[55:52] that the six
[55:54] generations before
[55:56] generation had all died
[55:59] tomorrow there was only one left yeah
[56:01] the dentist the seventh from adams
[56:05] a perfect type of the church agency
[56:09] that the six ages before
[56:13] they all died
[56:19] [Music]
[56:26] is
[56:55] he says now it's the seventh age that
[56:57] takes the rapture
[57:01] all the other six died
[57:04] but enoch was translated
[57:07] [Music]
[57:09] he was not found
[57:16] [Music]
[57:38] oh this is
[57:40] which we are bearing record of that age
[57:48] amen so can we all agree we're in the
[57:50] seventh church
[57:52] and sometimes
[58:30] amen
[58:32] it took a profit to say that this this
[58:34] translation this rapture
[58:40] for the bride
[58:42] the rapture will only be for the british
[59:01] but you must realize that it's it's the
[59:03] bride that gets herself ready
[59:05] [Music]
[59:08] if we think of a marriage
[59:12] and and the bride is
[59:14] is waiting in anticipation for that
[59:16] wedding
[59:29] well i'll show up oh as soon as it
[59:31] starts
[59:34] no that's what everybody else is doing
[59:37] as soon as i see the the the ceremony
[59:39] starts
[59:41] then i'll get myself ready
[59:43] then it'll be too late that's what our
[59:46] prophet kept pointing out
[59:48] you must see the signs
[59:50] you must see that flashing red light
[59:53] before the train is there
[59:56] because if you wait till the the sight
[59:57] that the literal train is there
[1:00:01] then by the time you run across the
[1:00:02] street
[1:00:05] to the entrance
[1:00:08] it's gone
[1:00:10] he's going to come in the in the
[1:00:11] twinkling of an eye
[1:00:25] she doesn't wait for the preacher to get
[1:00:26] ready and i don't buy him
[1:00:28] for somebody else
[1:00:34] she's got the dress picked out
[1:00:36] [Music]
[1:00:39] she can't wait to get dressed in that
[1:00:40] dress
[1:00:42] the metal said in anticipation
[1:00:46] and when that wedding day comes
[1:00:49] she will make sure
[1:00:51] that she is ready
[1:00:53] amen that's what we're doing today
[1:00:58] revelations 19.
[1:01:02] and uh verse 6.
[1:01:06] and i heard as it were a great voice of
[1:01:08] a great multitude
[1:01:15] and the voice of many waters a community
[1:01:18] console and as the voice of many
[1:01:20] thunderings they coming for default
[1:01:35] and give honor to him
[1:01:38] for the marriage of the lamb is come in
[1:01:42] and his wife have made herself ready
[1:01:46] and to her it was granted
[1:01:50] that she should be arrayed in fine linen
[1:01:54] clean and white
[1:01:56] for the fine linen
[1:01:58] fella is the righteousness of the saints
[1:02:03] and he sayeth unto me
[1:02:06] blessed are they which are called unto
[1:02:09] the marriage supper of the lamb
[1:02:16] now i want to i'm going to get here in a
[1:02:18] second
[1:02:31] are they which are called into the
[1:02:32] marriage supper
[1:02:46] okay and he saith unto me these are the
[1:02:49] true sayings of god
[1:02:53] so who brought this message to them
[1:02:56] let's find out
[1:02:58] and i fell at his feet to worship him
[1:03:06] and he said unto me see thou do it not
[1:03:08] immediate
[1:03:09] affair for i am thy fellow servant
[1:03:13] brethren
[1:03:21] for the testimony of jesus is the spirit
[1:03:24] of prophecy
[1:03:28] so we see it wasn't god in his flesh
[1:03:30] that was telling john
[1:03:37] so here's our messenger
[1:03:40] in revelation
[1:03:42] telling us
[1:03:44] blessed are they which are called under
[1:03:45] the marriage suffering
[1:03:48] blessed is the bride
[1:03:53] amen amen
[1:03:56] but we can uh can look back in in uh
[1:03:58] matthew 25.
[1:04:02] and he gives a parable of the 10 virgins
[1:04:06] you must have oil
[1:04:09] breathe
[1:04:13] there's the story of that young man from
[1:04:15] chicago
[1:04:18] he comes here to colorado up in the
[1:04:19] mountains
[1:04:22] what was he doing
[1:04:23] he was looking for a bride
[1:04:27] were there not girls in chicago
[1:04:30] oh yeah there were where you have it
[1:04:32] but that wasn't what he was looking for
[1:04:35] they had been denominated already
[1:04:38] so he came to this age look i love him
[1:04:40] you don't see
[1:04:41] it goes way up in the mountains
[1:04:44] and what does he find
[1:04:47] a bunch of the other girls just like
[1:04:49] they were in chicago
[1:04:51] chicago
[1:05:08] [Music]
[1:05:15] [Music]
[1:05:33] shared the same name
[1:05:47] somebody that had the characteristics
[1:05:50] that he was looking for
[1:05:54] amen amen but she was doing all the
[1:05:56] dirty work visited
[1:05:59] so he comes and and he says i will be
[1:06:01] back in a year
[1:06:28] all those floors that she's washing all
[1:06:30] of those
[1:06:41] [Music]
[1:06:58] the two becoming one
[1:07:00] ah
[1:07:01] amen do we believe that
[1:07:03] yeah
[1:07:06] i'll try to
[1:07:07] move on here pretty quickly
[1:07:11] all right so we know we're in the
[1:07:12] seventh age
[1:07:14] you know there's a rapture coming yeah
[1:07:16] all right let's talk about taking the
[1:07:18] rapture
[1:07:21] first thessalonians chapter 4.
[1:07:26] verse 13
[1:07:30] it says but i would not have you
[1:07:31] ignorant brethren concerning them which
[1:07:33] are asleep that ye sorrow not even as
[1:07:36] others that have no hope
[1:07:44] for if we believe that jesus died and
[1:07:46] rose again
[1:07:47] even so them also which sleep in jesus
[1:07:51] will god bring with him
[1:08:08] arose from the dead
[1:08:11] it created a resurrection
[1:08:14] in fact let's let's let's flip there
[1:08:16] real quick and we'll read it
[1:08:19] matthew 27 my juvenile
[1:08:30] and it says jesus when he had cried
[1:08:32] again with a loud voice yielded up the
[1:08:34] ghost
[1:08:38] and behold the veil of the temple was
[1:08:40] rent and twain from the top to the
[1:08:42] bottom and the earthquake
[1:08:44] and the earth did quake and the rocks
[1:09:32] and many bodies of the saints which slap
[1:09:35] arose
[1:09:38] and they came out of the graves
[1:09:41] after his resurrection
[1:09:43] and went into the holy city
[1:09:46] and appeared unto many people
[1:09:52] so they've already resurrected
[1:09:56] brother branham said that they went with
[1:09:57] him
[1:10:00] with with jesus in that rapture
[1:10:03] okay so here we are in first
[1:10:05] thessalonians
[1:10:08] and uh verse 14.
[1:10:11] for if we believe that jesus died and
[1:10:12] rose again
[1:10:16] so them which sleep in jesus will god
[1:10:19] bring
[1:10:21] with him
[1:10:25] so he's already seen it once
[1:10:28] and he knows it's going to happen again
[1:10:36] for this we say unto you by the word of
[1:10:38] the lord
[1:10:41] that we which are alive and remain
[1:10:45] until the coming of the lord jesus
[1:10:47] christ
[1:10:48] shall not prevent
[1:10:50] okay
[1:10:51] says that word prevent means
[1:10:56] it
[1:11:10] yeah for the lord himself shall descend
[1:11:14] from heaven with a shout listen
[1:11:18] with the voice of the archangel
[1:11:20] and with the trump of god
[1:11:23] and the dead in christ shall rise first
[1:11:28] then hello we which are alive and remain
[1:11:32] shall be caught up together with them in
[1:11:35] the clouds
[1:11:38] to meet the lord
[1:11:42] [Music]
[1:12:05] that phrase to be caught up
[1:12:11] it means to cease
[1:12:15] or to carry off by force
[1:12:19] it's to claim as one's self eagerly
[1:12:24] to claim for oneself
[1:12:31] so that means god is going to come and
[1:12:33] snatch
[1:13:14] and if you wouldn't have specifically
[1:13:15] called lazarus
[1:13:26] it's incredible that the prophet can can
[1:13:29] pull these things old testament new
[1:13:30] testament
[1:13:38] so we remember what happened about
[1:13:40] lazarus
[1:13:42] we could preach a sermon upon sermon
[1:13:44] about lazarus
[1:13:58] it's that
[1:14:05] [Music]
[1:14:12] the chapter before
[1:14:33] [Music]
[1:14:40] and here's those pharisees condemning it
[1:14:44] for another time
[1:14:47] but
[1:14:48] but jesus says in john 5 28.
[1:14:54] he says marvel not at this
[1:15:00] you see
[1:15:01] for the hour is coming
[1:15:05] in the which all that are in the graves
[1:15:07] shall hear his
[1:15:14] isn't that interesting it doesn't say
[1:15:16] the graves shall hear his shout out
[1:15:21] scriptures are perfect every time
[1:15:25] and shall come forth
[1:15:27] and they that have done good and to the
[1:15:29] resurrection of life
[1:15:33] and they that have done evil until the
[1:15:35] resurrection of damnation
[1:16:16] sometimes we need to kind of slow down
[1:16:18] divine
[1:16:46] he says and we are living in that day
[1:16:50] praise be to god
[1:16:52] the revelation
[1:16:54] of the mystery of himself
[1:16:58] he says
[1:16:59] the rapture is what we're talking about
[1:17:03] it's only for the bride remember
[1:17:07] the bible said
[1:17:08] and the rest of the dead lived not for a
[1:17:11] thousand years
[1:17:28] what
[1:17:50] amen
[1:17:52] hallelujah so we know there's going to
[1:17:54] be a rapture in this age i don't want
[1:17:56] you all to
[1:18:08] so if there's going to be a rapture how
[1:18:10] do we know we're going to be in that
[1:18:11] rapture
[1:18:15] it's not a guessing game
[1:18:19] god doesn't just uh i'll take this one
[1:18:23] just randomly
[1:18:24] uh god takes his own
[1:18:28] he's coming for a bride
[1:18:30] one that he loves
[1:18:32] one that will be flesh of his flesh
[1:18:35] here we go
[1:18:37] uh
[1:18:39] paragraph 93 of the rapture
[1:18:42] brother branham says so then how do we
[1:18:44] get into this body
[1:18:47] first corinthians 12.
[1:18:50] by one spirit we're all baptized into
[1:18:54] this body doesn't sell especially
[1:18:56] but they perform and said
[1:18:58] one holy spirit baptism doesn't sell by
[1:19:01] them
[1:19:02] that if you want to put that down first
[1:19:04] corinthians 12 13 civil rights
[1:19:18] amen which he was the word seed brings
[1:19:21] the seed to life
[1:19:28] do you get it
[1:19:30] if that life is laying in the seed
[1:19:34] then the baptism of the holy spirit
[1:19:40] it is bound
[1:19:42] to bring that seed light
[1:19:44] fox
[1:19:47] so we can imagine those seven church
[1:19:48] ages coming up
[1:19:52] first it's two blades uh poking out of
[1:19:54] the ground i see you see this monster
[1:19:57] solo and then it starts to grow
[1:19:59] we have the stock alonso
[1:20:01] [Music]
[1:20:13] and then the shock
[1:20:16] the covering
[1:20:21] amen and then we then then we can see
[1:20:23] the seedlings
[1:20:26] let's go back and read first corinthians
[1:20:27] 12 13.
[1:20:29] and then we'll uh we'll have one more uh
[1:20:32] one more quote and then we'll try to
[1:20:34] wrap up
[1:20:38] first corinthians 12 and 13.
[1:20:42] for by one spirit we are all baptized
[1:20:45] into one body
[1:20:49] whether we be jews or gentiles
[1:20:54] whether we be bombed or free
[1:20:58] and have been made to drink
[1:21:01] into one spirit
[1:21:07] now if you're just reading this bible
[1:21:08] with no profit
[1:21:11] and we've been made to drink into one
[1:21:12] spirit
[1:21:15] what is he talking about
[1:21:18] he's talking about that gene of god
[1:21:22] inside his bride
[1:21:25] needs the holy spirit water
[1:21:39] in hebrew it's baptizo
[1:21:44] and there's two words that are very
[1:21:46] similar
[1:21:53] baptizo is not to
[1:21:59] the clearest example that shows the
[1:22:01] meaning of baptism
[1:22:06] is actually from a greek poet and
[1:22:08] physician um his name was uh
[1:22:12] nikander
[1:22:15] and physicians
[1:22:18] he lived about 200 years before christ
[1:22:23] and he actually wrote a recipe for
[1:22:26] pickles
[1:22:29] and he uses both of these words in that
[1:22:31] recipe
[1:22:34] just so we can understand what the word
[1:22:35] baptized is
[1:22:40] so nikender says in order to make a
[1:22:42] pickle
[1:22:47] the vegetable should first be dipped as
[1:22:50] in bapto
[1:22:52] vegetable
[1:22:55] into boiling water
[1:22:59] and then it must be baptized as in
[1:23:02] baptism
[1:23:05] in the vinegar solution
[1:23:09] both of these verbs concern immersing
[1:23:12] the vegetables in a solution
[1:23:17] the vegetable is
[1:23:31] is the act of baptizing the vegetables
[1:23:35] that produces a permanent change
[1:23:42] so when it's used in the new testament
[1:23:43] the word often refers to a a union
[1:23:58] so for example mark 16-16
[1:24:07] christ is saying it's more it's it's
[1:24:10] it's more than just an intellectual
[1:24:11] ascent a christian
[1:24:14] in fact
[1:24:25] there's all kinds of pickles there's
[1:24:26] sweet pickles there's dill pickles right
[1:24:28] we're making a pickle
[1:24:30] you have to start with a cucumber
[1:24:34] you have to boil that cucumber
[1:24:38] so you dip that cucumber
[1:24:41] in the boiling water
[1:24:45] then you take the cucumber out i love
[1:24:48] resorting
[1:24:49] is it a pickle
[1:24:50] especially
[1:24:52] it's a soggy cucumber
[1:24:55] right
[1:25:11] so you pull it out it's the same
[1:25:14] that's what people are looking for with
[1:25:15] these new year's resolutions
[1:25:19] their nature hasn't been changed
[1:25:22] they're still a cucumber
[1:25:24] they're looking to
[1:25:27] [Music]
[1:25:39] [Music]
[1:25:51] so we've still got a cucumber it's
[1:25:52] boiled down
[1:25:55] it's a soggy cucumber
[1:25:59] brother brandon said you can have the
[1:26:01] holy spirit every day of your life and
[1:26:03] still go to hell
[1:26:10] [Music]
[1:26:32] but when you take that pickle
[1:26:34] who finished the coffee
[1:26:48] but it is now a pickle
[1:26:50] and then when you pull that out
[1:26:53] it's not like before
[1:26:56] when you pull it out
[1:26:57] it goes back to a cucumber
[1:27:00] no because once it's a pickle
[1:27:04] it's always a picture
[1:27:06] hallelujah
[1:27:08] our nature has been changed
[1:27:10] so once you're born a son of god
[1:27:14] there's no returning background
[1:27:55] his desires are changed
[1:28:12] so it's not he that believes and is
[1:28:13] baptized dipped in water
[1:28:17] but is he that is baptized completely
[1:28:20] changed
[1:28:23] we realize we're not covered by jesus's
[1:28:26] blood
[1:28:30] but we have jesus's blood flowing within
[1:28:33] us
[1:28:37] but it's just that it's there on the
[1:28:38] inside
[1:28:40] so when jesus goes up in the rapture
[1:28:43] we are a part of him
[1:28:45] because his life is in us
[1:28:48] so we can't help but take the response
[1:28:52] [Music]
[1:28:54] if
[1:29:11] but when the body moves
[1:29:14] the entirety of the body
[1:29:16] [Music]
[1:29:22] if our arm is cut off
[1:29:26] and brother branham says and and another
[1:29:28] arm is put on a mechanical arm
[1:29:33] that arm is not a part of us
[1:29:50] the citrus tree
[1:29:58] and and how it produces oranges
[1:30:01] but you can graft in other fruits
[1:30:18] and what does the bible say buy their
[1:30:20] fruits you shall know
[1:30:23] now if that branch
[1:30:24] is said
[1:30:25] let's say the lemon branch
[1:30:30] puts off a sub branch it is
[1:30:37] so it doesn't matter if you're first
[1:30:38] baptist oh
[1:30:41] second baptist design baptista
[1:30:43] southern baptist uh
[1:30:45] batista
[1:30:55] but if that tree ever puts forth a new
[1:30:57] branch
[1:31:00] if that tree ever puts forth a new
[1:31:02] branch
[1:31:04] it will produce the original fruits
[1:31:09] and in the last days there shall be a
[1:31:11] church rise up
[1:31:14] and it will write another book of acts
[1:31:18] just like it was in the beginning
[1:31:22] amen hallelujah
[1:31:24] that original life
[1:31:28] praise the lord so we've been completely
[1:31:30] changed we're not covered by his name
[1:31:32] this is some complete motion
[1:31:35] but his blood now flows through us
[1:31:38] we are a part of him
[1:31:41] amen we can't miss that rapture
[1:31:56] not anointed
[1:32:09] rapture 148.
[1:32:14] and when it comes to an oh glory i got
[1:32:16] the anointing
[1:32:18] [Music]
[1:32:21] and he says and it's the genuine
[1:32:23] anointing hello
[1:32:36] but that didn't have nothing to do with
[1:32:39] this issue
[1:32:42] inside alan
[1:32:44] unless that's god's seed
[1:32:49] his gene from the beginning
[1:32:52] predestinated
[1:32:56] [Music]
[1:32:59] amen amen
[1:33:01] so it must be god's life living in us
[1:33:06] inside
[1:33:18] but it is now christ living in us
[1:33:34] everything
[1:34:03] that little cousin that was waiting for
[1:34:04] that that man from chicago to come back
[1:34:10] all those sisters were always making fun
[1:34:12] of her
[1:34:14] oh he's just like all these other guys
[1:34:15] he's just making fun
[1:34:28] it didn't matter how long he was
[1:34:32] she was getting herself ready
[1:34:35] she was getting herself dressed as sabi
[1:34:38] he should be here any moment
[1:34:40] because this is the day that the lord's
[1:34:42] coming
[1:34:44] so should his church
[1:35:05] [Music]
[1:35:14] [Music]
[1:35:26] amanda we believe that this morning
[1:35:30] let's all stand up
[1:35:34] [Applause]
[1:35:39] i just thank god for his message
[1:35:43] because just reading through the
[1:35:44] scriptures there's no way that we would
[1:35:46] understand
[1:35:47] what he's telling
[1:35:48] us
[1:35:57] amen amen
[1:35:59] i think this was a blessing to us
[1:36:01] tonight
[1:36:06] it's not about the signs
[1:36:10] producing
[1:36:12] we have been taught about science those
[1:36:15] are interesting yesterday
[1:36:18] but now it's not about knowledge of the
[1:36:21] science nationally
[1:36:28] [Music]
[1:36:33] in the light of all the signs that you
[1:36:36] know the
[1:36:41] what is your response she goes to
[1:36:43] reports
[1:36:45] what how are you ready
[1:36:47] they can manipulate how are you making
[1:36:50] yourself ready
[1:36:55] god is not going to ask
[1:36:58] jenny demanded her
[1:37:01] how much you know conveying to say
[1:37:04] but he's looking at how much
[1:37:07] you are how already you are evilly
[1:37:10] regardless
[1:37:12] that pray
[1:37:14] natural things the show's not your head
[1:37:17] are the reflection of the spiritual so
[1:37:20] in reflection they show spiritual
[1:37:24] that cousin sikuzela that cousin said
[1:37:28] cuzinda was making herself ready
[1:37:33] but the rest of the people were making
[1:37:35] fun melee restaurants
[1:37:38] we have to accept it
[1:37:39] they won't accept it we have to accept
[1:37:42] people to make fun of us
[1:37:45] particularly
[1:37:46] they know
[1:37:55] but as long as you know what you are
[1:37:58] doing
[1:38:00] thank you for connecting
[1:38:04] this is what is more important
[1:38:06] is important and the time we are living
[1:38:09] also
[1:38:13] there are a lot of distractions
[1:38:15] distraction satan knows that his time is
[1:38:18] up satan
[1:38:22] he doesn't want to go to hell by himself
[1:38:24] he never laid an affair a remember
[1:38:27] that's why we see the advance in
[1:38:29] technology
[1:38:31] guarantee technology you don't need to
[1:38:34] go buy a ticket to go watch a movie into
[1:38:36] the barbecue in dallas
