I love J I love him how I love Jes so how I love Jesus because he first [Music] love father we love you and we cannot even express our love toward you but we believe that you are omnicient you are omnipotent and you can see what is in our heart regardless of our ups and down regardless of our weaknesses but something inside is always telling us that you are here and you love us and you are the one who love us first and that's why father we are coming tonight to express our love to you bless us father and bless each one of us and bless the word we are about to read take me out of the way and come with a special visitation special anointing to bless your people if they have any request anything be the answer for I ask in Jesus Christ name amen amen as we are standing let us uh open our Bible in the book of Hebrews Hebrews chapter 9 just to save some time those who have in French they can be reading directly from their Bible we will just because it's a little bit longer read reading uh from this reading it's showing in the Bible there are three uh compartment in the sanctuary and uh we want to speak tonight about uh the principles of the glory atmosphere I mean we have been talking since uh Sunday about uh the principle of the atmosphere in for the third pool and then we said that atmosphere is what bring result and I believe with all our needs our problems we need to come to understand that it's just the atmosphere just atmosphere the atmosphere is what is going to produce whatever you need we can pray it's good but if we are praying in a wrong atmosphere nothing can happen as we spoke about the principle with the egg that have to hatch so that we are going to continue because we believe there is a special secret place where the atmosphere has to be stop this first part God willing on Sunday sometimes it takes a lot of may be very helpful for yes but we will still continue with the subject afterward Hebrews chapter 9 verse uh verse 1 to2 then verely the first Covenant had also so ordinances of divine service and a worldly Sanctuary for there was a tabernacle made the first wherein was the Candlestick and the table and the shoe bread which is called the sanctuary and after the second Veil The Tabernacle which is called the holiest of all which had the golden sensor and the Ark of the Covenant overlaid round about with gold wherein was the golden pot that had mana and Aon road that bed and the tables of the Covenant and over it the cherubin of the of Glory shadowing The Mercy Seat of which we cannot now speak particularly now when the things were thus ordained the priest went always into the first Tabernacle accomplishing the service of God but into the second went the high priest alone once every year not without blood which he offered for himself and for the error of the people the Holy Ghost this signifying that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest while as the first Tabernacle was yet standing which was a figure of the time then present in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices that could not make him that uh did the service perfect as pertaining to this conscience weave stood only in meats and drinks and diverse washing and caral ordinances imposed on them until the time of reformation but Christ being come on high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect Tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building neither by the blood of goats and cves but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy Place having ordained Eternal Redemption for us may the Lord bless the reading of the scripture you may be seated so from uh last Sunday we said that uh uh brother bam said in the message humble thyself and uh saying that it takes of all of us together that's in the message humble thyself paragraph 74 and just capitulating if you can go as I go a little bit F to go out earlier he said and it takes all of us all together if we want to see the third pool really do something for God it's a coordination with everyone of us together to Humble ourselves before God and confess our wrong and pray and believe God for these things so what we are saying it's really a reality if we can coordinate with one another in Perfect Harmony and uh humble ourselves before God and confess our wrong we are going to see these things and uh as we said the Tabernacle has three pieces part so the in a court where everybody sit and the holy place but there has also the holiest of holy and uh that's the place with the principle of uh God if you want enter in that place you will never be the same that's a principle if you don't get in you will remain in the outer court and you will still continue to have your ups and down and you will be worried about things of this world and uh we'll never be satisfied you may be a little bit happy today but tomorrow there is a problem you will be complaining and it will be always like that but God works always with principles and if we want to receive something from God we have just to follow his principle if you want really to be changed the veil of the temple was rented leaving giving free access to whosoever Will and the principle is Once you walk into that inqu and the veil falls behind you you are sound proof and because you become sound proof you are in the presence of God and in such presence ask what you will and it's going to happen the problem is with our prayers sometimes our prayers become even a recitation because we do those prayers in the court we where there is a lot of noise and that's the reason why you might be praying but your mind is not connected with God you are distracted while praying you are thinking about your job you are thinking about your bills maybe something that somebody did to you then you feel still offended but once you are in the inner Court you are connected sound proof you don't even know what happened those who think that you are missing they think you are lacking doesn't mean anything to you anymore amen amen so brother said in the message paragraph 10 he said because it's always the atmosphere that brings the results it's always the atmosphere that brings results if you need results the only thing you have to look for is the atmosphere atmosphere and continue paragraph 11 can lay a seed out there in the ground no matter how much that seed is gered and lay it there it got to have an atmosphere to have it live amen amen when you plant a seed regardless of how many chemicals regardless of how many things you will do it will only gerti according to God's principle and that principle is the atmosphere and rain water Sunshine is part of God's principle to make it grow outside of the principle nothing can work it's the same with us we can be planted regardless of the church regardless of the Tabernacle it will take the atmosphere and the first room of the atmosphere is what is in you amen if inside of you you cannot have an atmosphere they can take you sit you in the BAM tab nothing is going to happen because the brother himself recognized wherever people are gathering wherever there are three category of people amen amen so regardless there are the three category so your category can only change depending on the atmosphere coming out of yourself same thing with the cup the sun has to come to a certain power before bring it to a certain atmosphere atere so the sun heating the crop will produce atmosphere because without atmosphere it will not grow and continue talking about an egg as to have an atmosphere or it won't h no matter how fertile it is got to have that atmosphere no matter how fertile the ground the dirt can be it takes the atmosphere amen amen also in the message the Inner Man paragraph 61 brother said let their faith just meet that condition and it will be for thou has said as thou has believed in thy heart so shall it be and I pray that you will grant that tonight and make the whole atmosphere here Lord a creative atmosphere an atmosphere creative of One S one mind one Accord one purpose Grant it Lord so if I have that atmosphere in me you have that atmosphere in you and all together with the same atmosphere we don't need prayer result will come and that was the atmosphere in the upper room one mind one Accord everything together one purpose and brother said Grant it Lord hear my prayer I pray this that you will grant it to us in the name of Jesus Christ thy beloved Son amen and he continue by saying my heart so aners to see that atmosphere after the prayer he said my heart so anger to see that atmosphere see see the atmosphere is what brings it and that atmosphere is very important wherever we be in our home in ourself in the church workplace in our fellowship if there is that atmosphere brother Bram said the newspaper will be packed saying that something happened but the contrary of that at atere you know complaining complaining complaining is also an atmosphere which is contrary to the atmosphere of Faith amen Amen brother those are principles I know the Bible said God give me don't give me too much because sometimes when you get too much you will forget God and I think that will be in the second part when I come to the principles sometimes we we say we are humble or we are nothing sometimes it's because we don't have but let us have then we will find out who is really humble amen amen and that's the book of proverb if I don't have sometimes you can be a good Christian but the lack of certain things can cause you to complain too much Lord why I'm trying to BU it's not working my kids not working my wife my husband things are not working and if you don't watch the atmosphere your result will never change you will get into a negative atmosphere of complain complain and sometimes you will ass associate yourself with people who are complaining and a bunch of complainers will not change the result because we need to be associated with a people of faith I'm lacking I'm lacking but I'm associate with somebody who got faith somebody who can help me lift up the faith oh brother you know what you are going through I was also a young man I was also single but look at what I did I kept the faith and today all the things are behind it going to it's going to help you but if you associate yourself what else to do in this world you victim like me and we even don't know if God still answer prayers when you get into such an atmosphere you are done so atmosphere is something to watch when brother is saying the atmosphere will bring result I believe it if brother use all those example of the egg to hatch that that's a message and he preached several sermon on the Supernatural and you know they C I'm reading the supernatural in the message Supernatural they other title for that message is a spiritual atmosphere if you are in the correct spiritual atmosphere will bring results if the atmosphere is not correct regardless of what you do there is no result the egg will never hatch so we have to watch it correctly see the atmosphere is what bring it if every person here will get in one Perfect Harmony Perfect Harmony it will settle it it will be settle amen amen so brother sometimes we don't have to complain looking solution elsewhere if you be part of it you be part of it I am part of it with one mind one Accord brother every meeting will be special God is Duty Bound by his principle and Bram said the egg to hatch is to put it under the H and it will hat because it's the atmosphere and toward the end put it in an incubator you put it they put in America all the eggs they put them in the machines it's h anyhow see it's the atmosphere that brings forth the result amen amen in the message super the supernatural I think we read it Sunday but I want to touch it a little bit again paragraph 20 he said he has been talking about atmosphere atmosphere it's not the atmosphere of the building it's the atmosphere of the people in the building that's what I want to stress out but it the attitude of the people that brings the results that's the reason at Pentecost they had to go to an upper room and pray until the Holy Ghost came because they got in one place and one Accord it's the atmosphere that brings the results and they say in the upper room we got a promise we are here together to make that promise come to happen Peter one mind Mary one mind each one of them not fighting but it was one mind Lord you promise we are here to be witnessed and after while people came from the street what are what happening here speaking in different tongues why because that's what the atmosphere does and Bram said you believe that let every man and woman in this building this morning boy or girl get every from their mind but the Lord Jesus and believe that he is standing present right now if right now we can have that in our mind everything else out but have Christ in our mind that Lord you promise Lord you promise Lord you promise and let this happen am Bram said you will see something happening that will cause headlines in the newspaper in the morning that's right it's atmosphere atere and he said I don't believe in joking from the pulpit because he said this in connection to the sense of humor that brother B of um he said if you take a egg you put it under the body of a puppy I don't have it don't have to be under the hand it can be under the it could be in an incubator it's the atmosphere atere and it's the atmosphere that brings the miraculous wonders and power of God Among the people it's the atmosphere of the people it's not the atmosphere of the building it's not the atmosphere of the preacher the preacher will bring the cat for you but we have all together to be in that atmosphere and it's the atmosphere that will bring the miraculous and that's why last Sunday I touch about applying the token uh you know some things some many things are the things that kill the atmosphere and sometimes we don't know they are many things that kill the atmosphere atere it's not just a simple uh bad conversation but within yourself even the thing we dress can bring certain atmosphere brother talks about names that we give to our children he said if you give him a name of Ricky that means that will create a certain atmosphere of Ricky's spirit I don't want to read that quot but I think many of you you know it the name you give to somebody has an impact father how do you explain that I believe it not only name also even the toys we give to our children it can impact clothes you put certain clothes you know in con I saw somebody wearing a t-shirt they call it s but if you look it closely it's seen bad you know it can be some of the name it can be as easy even what our parent has given to us if your the meaning of your name is something that is wrong rather change it brother bam said if it's not so why then God changed the name of Jacob why God changed the name of sa why God change the name of Abraham to Abraham because he have to be the father of nation so the name we give to our children have meaning and sometimes Believers in the message a lot of zeal we don't want to name our kid Sarah anymore Rea or it old names they start looking for names I saw one in the Congo baz it's a last name it's good Neville Neville is not the first name his name was nille but we take it as it's not bad but I found in a con all those name we have to dig in the message somebody name his child because it's in the brochure it's in the books but have you trace down the life do you know and I don't want to tell you what it is my point is to make you think what you give be sure it's not I'm finding a name to impress the people you know all those Sarah Rea Ruth has been given all the time I want to find something special pray for it because the name has impact and Bram said if you have a bad name change it not only name even toys clothes on the people even us we want to dress up you know most of the men the suit we wear the label they put here it's not for us to show off they put it in the R to make differences but for us you buy anything you find a label dolls and gabana do you know do and gabana do you know those people actually they are homosexual brother we have to be careful in what we are doing what we are putting on because all those things brother understand it the way you want but my point is about the atmosphere if that thing is not going to help create a good atmosphere atmosphere you know what to do Gucci oh grief grief grief oh no the brain the brain the brain it's like somebody wearing a Halloween costume amen amen they are costume or something to impress the people all those things create a certain atmosphere they take the candy at school they give to the kids and they eat those things but we have to be very very selective and in addition Even in our home what we bring in have to have to be censored because you can have a little things maybe a little St statute oh somebody gave me what was the purpose what that statute represent I don't know if I don't know get rid of you have to know exactly when you come to my home you find this picture you ask me what is it I will tell you you find this picture you ask me I will tell you and in my mind I believe those things create a certain atmosphere but in the same mouth they cannot come hot water and cold water you have this and you have naked woman on the wall it's not it's not going to work it's going to fight atmosphere and if we talk about our home we have to watch also people visitors in our home excuse me but let me tell you this not everybody I have to welcome you we are not saying against Hospitality but I know what I'm saying even the hotel room you know what people go to do in the hotel room it's not all always about sex no you know what happened a few years ago in Las Vegas there was a guy buying guns all kind of guns putting in the hotel room he come go out he buy guns until the day he shoot how many remember the shooting in Las Vegas he was they found it different type of gun so people go in the hotel room for different purposes and per personally I never walk into a hotel room and sleep do whatever I do without praying first to cast out those spirit because there are Spirit left there there are people going for witchcraft purpose they call upon many demons and the demon respond they do whatever they have to do and they leave and leaving those spirit in the room and you walk in and you turn the TV to watch pornography which atmosphere you work out with and welcoming people in the house sometimes I I I start finding it becoming a little bit nasty people want to everything always free free free free uh sometimes we have to if you can respect a little bit yourself you go visit a brother there is a wedding somewhere if you don't have any way to go stay or I have to travel you have some place for me to sleep even in your living in your kitchen no no no no no it goes with our personality and sometimes your behavior will reflect on where you are coming from oh brother find even even in your toilet and then oh I will look for a place for you to go somebody here I will recommend you what is all these things welcoming people in our home and as going to any home it should not be a correct [Music] habit we have to excuse me but that's the reality all since you get free ticket on the standby stand by stand by you run every state what are you looking for I don't say that you can not to stay at the brother I don't say that but you have to find the middle yourself even if you receive guests in your home pray for them Lord I'm fulfilling the word because he say in so doing I can even Lodge Angels but not everybody is an angel as you receive Angels you may receive also somebody who's the contrary of the Angel when you are sleeping he's going to deposit a lot of spirit and he leave this happen this happen I don't know but uh I heard also one of U the pastor in South Africa pastor Beck he made a big study about those things say brother I don't allow myself and my kid to go sleep in all the houses no more and I don't take anybody in my house all the every time he's not the prophet but it's spoken out of a certain experience so that's the reason why Bram said we have to apply the token and to move out all the trash I'm in the message token paragraph 369 then what do you do when you apply it to your house we have to apply the token in our home therefore if we have to watch the little things uh the television out short skirt out even certain human being out move on the trash out get all the short skirts and the shorts the cards the cigarette televisions whatever more and kick them out of the door when you go apply the token won stand still for it yes sir take it out all the dances brother a prophet remain a prophet and sometimes we say we believe the prophet we believe the message but actually we don't because those things about the high heel the short skirt those uh artificial wigs and stuff has spoken about it what do we do with it those things cause a certain atmosphere and when we pray in our home sometimes our prayers go nowhere because of the atmosphere created by those things we thank God for the prophet all the dances and the parties and rock and roll and today we have rock and roll if was living in this day he could mention some of the the modern dances and all the vgar newspapers and the stuff that's of the world kick it out out the door say we are cleaning out this place around here let us clean our home and the same thing clean the church why do we have those pictures I have heard several people saying oh you know in America if you visit many churches they are afraid to put those pictures they say if a visitor walk in they will be stumbled but in theam Tabernacle it is in amen amen if there is a seed he will ask you what is it and you will break down if it's not a seed are you are worshiping a man and I'm not going to come back that's fine the bride will remain a minority all of us we were born not knowing the things one day they showed us the things depending on the day we could have criticized it but because of the seed God brought it back and we love it we believe it and brother even said since I always have one of this picture with me in my office in my car personally even in my wallet I always have one of the small picture of the cloud not all all all together the uh the identity card and so forth because the think create an atmosphere atere and if you understand it create an atmosphere don't do anything contrary to that when you have it because it become a curse you have this picture in your home but in the meantime you have a pornography that become a curse you are putting that cursed thing on the top of what is supposed to bring a good atmosphere amen amen in the message why are people so TOS about now brother start talking about the glory paragraph 18 d 7 in this holy Place Aon went once a year the congregation watched him he was dressed right he had you see when you go in that Holy place the way you dress matter he was dressed right he had to be anointed right which kind of anointing are you taking in that place he had to work right blessed be the Lord dress right walk right anoint right he had a bell and a pomegranate on His Garment and he walked they played holy holy unto the Lord he taken before him a charg of blood the blood of the Lamb the blood of the atonement and he was anointed with the rose of Sharon and you know we call Jesus The Rose of Sharon [Music] because it's that flower that was pressed to get the perfume that the high priest has to be Anointed with which was the type of God pressing Christ on the calvary so that the blood can come so that we can be Anointed with that blood when we come to worship because within ourselves we are not worthy that the anointing that help us into the presence of the Lord and the anointed roll of his beard Plum to the HS of his skirt he was walking into the in a court in the presence of God and when he went behind there the veil fell behind him and he was shut out he was hid from the outer World praise be to God there is a hiding place Abiding Place brother call it Abiding Place it's it's a place where you have to rest to dwell the rest of your life this is where the right atmosphere is and that's the atmosphere that will produce the third pole not to be in and out but a Abiding Place a secret place so as we are talking about the principle there is a principle of the secret location the principle of the sh Glory once you get into that place you are completely disconnected disconn with the rest of the world either you are hungry or not you have a job or not you have a wife or not you have money in the bank or not you are settled that's the Abiding Place and brother said in the Old Testament to get into that place meant death but in the New Testament since Jesus died on the cross the veil of the temple was right and said not to enter is death so that's why we are talking about the atmosphere of the sh glory and that's the atmosphere where you and I we need to be in order to be prepared for the rapture amen the main problem we have we have a lot of people in the out coat talking about the message discussing about the message if you enter that in a place you are a different person that's the principle if you enter that place you are different nothing will bother you criticis is not going to bother you they can point you the finger but it's like you are not existing you are dead to yourself and that's why the next series I will start with the principle of Resurrection because Resurrection it's a principle if you don't die you will not come into the resurrection there is a principle you have to abide by God principle in order for you to be in the morning of the Resurrection you have to die first and be buried otherwise you will never come into the resurrection and not coming into the resurrection you are where are you going to stand in this life things can happen we may sleep before the Rapture but it's not a problem but if you are in the secret location there is a principle you see that principle of Resurrection works everywhere with the sun in the morning it rises travel and said buried the next morning always in the East never West never North never South because it's the principle of God amen amen and when the sun set it's always in the west look at the travel of the Gospel it started with Ephesus going to Europe and where the sun set in the west America even in America Tabernacle was in the East but God said you have to go to the west and the sunet mountain amen it's not by it's the principle the principle of resurrection and you cannot get the principle of Resurrection if you don't go with the principle of humility humility is a principle if you want to go high see how low you can get it's a principle and that humility has to come from your heart not because I don't have a job I start blaming the people who have a job job is a Satan a car is a Satan blessing is sat it's good but when you get to the spot where your brother is maybe with the money he has then we will know who is really humble and the two mil is when you can Rec you can confess your faults not being caught but from the inside then you have a principle there amen am let's continue with brother paragra 19 so he said there is a hiding place Abiding Place we we can walk in the presence of God and be hid from the things of this world you you don't hear them no more it sound proof Hallelujah sound proof and said and a man that wants walk into God and the veil drops behind him shutting off the things of the world he is in the presence of God eating the man no wonder 12:00 9:00 or anything is living in the presence of the king amen no wonder every day is f for him not when you see a snow you start even cursing the Creator be happy with the snow be happy with the sunshine because the Creator think it's right at the appointed time and be us being his subject we have to glorify him therefore there is no reason to complain if it's too cold cover up that's it and praise the Lord amen amen that's why brother said no wonder every day is fine for him see look where he's at he has found the secret place Glory place it's a secret place it's the place where the real atmosphere is if you can have access to the glory the atmosphere is always right sign and wonders will be with you amen amen we can preach anything but the main purpose is to get people behind the if you have a lot of people in the outer Court you will have a lot of complaints some people will never be satisfied let me tell you the place of satisfaction is behind the ve when you get there you are satisfied snow rain Sunshine whatever whatever you are satisfied and you can see some people they never be satisfied you can't tell by their life anything happen always on the negative side complain after complain why you didn't do this if you say hello why you did not say God bless you when you say God bless you which kind of blessing are you always on the def but take the same person let that person get into the glory then you can talk amen amen the doors is closed behind him he don't see nothing of the world do was made Sun proof by the Sheep SK God's skin and this is made some proof by the baptism of the holy [Music] spirit that hide the Man in Christ there he becomes a new creature and walk daily before him in this manner Amen brother said once you find that place listen to the next paragraph he said what a beautiful picture of the believer in the presence of God all things are his dead all things was given to Christ all that was uh that God was he put into Christ and all Christ was P into the church and that day you will know that I am in the Father the father in me and I in you all the privilege that the believer has if they only could accept it amen amen that's the principle that's the principle get into the behind the veil and nothing happen then God is no longer God amen amen Unity between Christ and the believer and brother bam said once you get into that place all things are his all things are yours all things are yours job is yours marriage is yours money is yours anything is yours so the key is get into that place hidden man the hidden place and in that place you should not be afraid even of sources because the S cannot get there amen if a s get in he become your brother amen amen in the that's the principle you will never be the same some changes must happen oh brother since I believe the message I never changed I never had this I never had an experience this is as this is valid until you want to know how to enter into that hidden Place brother when you get in brother bam said you become a special person somebody can spit on your face you can just wipe it and move on and no bitterness no and that's you can test yourself but if somebody criticize you or they say something you are ready to blow up to roll over your sleeves or if you don't do it maybe because the brothers and sisters are there but inside say I'm going to get you one day that means you never been to that place Jesus in that place you slap here why don't you slap in the message is Supernatural brother said paragraph 31 and the man who walk in there when the high priest went in beyond that Veil that Veil that separated the holiest from the holiest of holies when he walk in there the veil dropped behind him it was even soundproof and man or a woman that ever walk in that sh glory of God the whole world shut off behind him all the bar all the music dance it's shut but the problem when you see you can tell by the taste the life of the people that this person has been or not you can tell when worldly music is a priority no matter what the devil says you don't pay any attention to it and he's living in a different atmosphere he live in there where they can put Aon Road amen amen and it was nothing but a old Dead stick off of a olive tree but once laid in the presence of God it yielded what it was supposed to be in the beginning and brother said in one night time it bed blossoms and almonds amen amen that's the same way that a Believer or a sinner is ever laid in the presence of almighty God under the influence of the Holy Ghost he becomes a new Creator right then his life becomes fruitful Fresh Life comes in and he yield what he was supposed to be a Son of God skipping a little bit but if you believe and lay in his presence it will produce the same thing to you you will realize that you are born Sons and Daughters of God and will yield the fruit of the spirit but you can't do it out there on the court you got to do it in here on the inside hid away amen that's the key is talking you know they took all the 12 rods and put it in a certain atmosphere God told Moses let them write their the name of their tribes on every road and they put it in the presence of God and Aaron Rod was put on the tribe of Levi and they were dead stick and overnight just in one night period Hallelujah One Night in the presence of God this is a principle said somewhere in another message that Moses in the burning bush it was a 5 minute experience 5 minutes with the Burning Bush Moses was changed amen as Aon Rod overnight it bed and blossomed and bring fruit overnight what did it and why others did not it was a predestinated h and a predestin right atmosphere brother you are going to bear fruit you are going to be changed if you don't change that means you never find that place amen amen and the thing that cause people not to find that place are the things of the world brother if we can clean ourselves clean up our home clean up our mind and stay in the correct atmosphere you speak the word and it will come to pass in the message identify with Christ brother said here's what causes a lot of it is our news stands full of V magazines our homes are full of pin up pictures what do we have in in the worldall sometimes you go to a store you find a nice picture and you say it's going to decorate my house nothing wrong with it but if you study what it is hello hello and did you sensor to know that think which kind of atmosphere it's going to bring oh it's a big picture from a African mother and you see African mother with just a cover here all the top Naked Brother even if you are a philosopher promoting African women has a negative atmosphere get rid of it and he said our news screens are never censor what is passing on your screen in your home the YouTube all those things what do you what is passing on your phone they are wide open can crack any kind of jokes or do things that are that's terrible brother say when I was a little boy I read a book of T and apes you know brother was reading the book and you know what
