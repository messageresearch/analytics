[1:07] chapter
[1:09] [Music]
[1:10] five really my physio
[1:15] [Music]
[1:24] and uh
[1:28] before we read the bible
[1:31] let's just have a word of prayer
[1:35] precious heavenly father
[1:38] it is good for

[1:50] no man can change another
[2:04] under the hospice of the holy spirit
[2:08] and we thank you for gathering these
[2:10] saints of god
[2:13] and lord it's ruined my lord to read a
[2:15] few things here for your people
[2:19] and i just pray the holy spirit will
[2:20] give to each and everyone as we stand in
[2:23] need of it
[2:26] this year lord god bless our pastor
[2:29] fosten for this wonderful initiative
[2:48] i just
[3:16] i'm going to begin at verse 21
[3:18] in zola verse 17. submitting yourselves
[3:21] one to another in the fear of god
[3:24] wives submit yourselves unto your own
[3:27] husbands as unto the lord for the
[3:30] husband is the head of the wife even as
[3:33] christ is the head of the church and he
[3:35] is the savior of the body
[3:38] therefore as the church is subject unto
[3:40] christ so let the wives be to their own
[3:44] husbands in everything
[3:46] husbands love your wives even as christ
[3:49] also loved the church and gave himself
[3:52] for it
[3:53] that he might sanctify and cleanse
[3:57] it with the washing of the water by the
[4:00] word amen
[4:03] that he might present it to himself
[4:06] what kind of a church
[4:11] i probably did something amen a glorious
[4:14] church
[4:15] not having spot
[4:17] no wrinkle
[4:19] or any such thing
[4:21] but that it should be holy and without
[4:23] blemish
[4:25] so ought meant to love their wives as
[4:27] their own bodies amen he that loveth his
[4:30] wife loveth himself amen for no man ever
[4:34] yet hated his own flesh
[4:36] but nourisheth and cherished it
[4:38] cherisheth it even as the lord the
[4:40] church for we are members of his body
[4:43] and of his flesh and of his bones for
[4:46] this call shall a man leave his father
[4:48] and mother and shall be joined unto his
[4:50] wife and they too shall be one flesh
[4:53] this is a great mystery but i speak
[4:55] concerning christ and the church
[4:57] nevertheless let every one of you in
[4:59] particular so love his wife even as
[5:02] himself and the wife see that she
[5:04] reverence her husband amen may the lord
[5:08] bless the reading of his word
[5:22] love your wife
[5:36] amen amen so i'm thankful to be here
[5:39] with my entire family
[5:44] and
[5:45] sister sarah and her husband
[5:48] brother steve they flew from dallas
[5:50] texas
[6:00] and i thank the lord for each and every
[6:01] one of you
[6:04] praise the
[6:19] sharon
[6:20] uh
[6:21] and uh and i see brother emmanuel
[6:27] and we're talking about
[6:28] couples
[6:31] and they are couples too
[6:44] we give thanks to god
[7:00] that was
[7:28] and
[7:42] god
[7:56] it's totally
[8:36] exactly the same way that christ loves
[8:39] the church exactly
[8:42] do you believe that yes
[8:47] so now i want to look into master peace
[8:53] and
[8:55] so
[8:56] it's in paragraph
[8:59] let's get um

[9:35] and he saw how that michelangelo had
[9:37] done it great work
[9:45] and he had made a statue of moses step
[10:02] and just like god before he did anything
[10:04] he had a vision in his mind he had a
[10:07] thought it comes uh
[10:12] and so
[10:14] for years michelangelo began to work on
[10:16] this
[10:29] and everything
[10:58] he never left that vision he never lost

[13:47] because you've returning from the main
[13:49] purpose
[13:50] uh
[13:52] that god gives you a wife for the big
[13:54] principle
