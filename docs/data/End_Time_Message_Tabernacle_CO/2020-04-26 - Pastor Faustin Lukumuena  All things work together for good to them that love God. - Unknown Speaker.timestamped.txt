[31:25] school children for the last I don't
[31:29] know how many weeks four or five weeks
[31:33] we did not have the opportunity to have
[31:36] gatherings in this sanctuary therefore
[31:40] there was no opportunity to have a
[31:42] Sunday school but Sunday school children
[31:46] I wanted to let you know this morning
[31:49] that you are loved and you are not
[31:53] forgetting and we do care for you and
[31:56] that's the reason why before the service
[31:59] this morning I want to address your
[32:02] little group and in order to do so I
[32:06] want all the sunday school children in
[32:10] your home to stand up on your feet as I
[32:15] want to sing with you this song jesus
[32:20] loves me let us sing with all our voices
[32:25] and clap as much as we can to show God
[32:30] that we love him because of his love

[32:53] but he is strong yes jesus loves me yes
[33:03] jesus loves me
[33:08] yes jesus loves me
[33:13] their Bible tells me so
[33:19] Jesus loves me he will die heaven's
[33:25] gates to open what he will wash away my

[35:00] Bible tells me so
[35:06] amen amen amen amen
[35:09] may God bless you you may be seated for
[35:13] a while thank you each one of you and
[35:19] let me ask you a few questions here are
[35:22] you all doing well the family doing good
[35:29] how are you spending your time during
[35:32] this time where there is no church there
[35:37] is no Sunday School
[35:40] there is no sunday school homework
[35:42] either and there is no school let me
[35:48] tell you something that this is an
[35:56] opportunity for me and I even say it's a
[35:59] greater privilege just to let each one
[36:02] of you know that we care for you we
[36:06] cannot spend all this month just playing
[36:13] but a bottom tapes and having services
[36:19] may be sermon with the grown up without
[36:21] addressing the little one from our
[36:25] Sunday school the entire week as I said
[36:28] has been a huge burden as I start
[36:32] meditating I say what about the
[36:34] the ones we need to tell them something
[36:36] we need to address them as well we need
[36:39] to let them know that we always bear
[36:43] them in our mind and pray for them and I
[36:46] believe also that you also pray for the
[36:50] pastor way for the offices of the church
[36:54] the deacon the trustees these song
[36:58] leaders the Sunday School teachers the
[37:00] musician and the entire congregation
[37:02] because the little ones they are very
[37:06] closer to God and when they play God
[37:10] always listen so we thank God for each
[37:13] one of you and this morning I want hour
[37:17] before addressing the grown up group to
[37:21] say a few words to your attention and
[37:25] without any doubt I believe you have
[37:29] been each one of you a good child a good
[37:33] character like the name most of you have
[37:36] from the Bible and a message character
[37:39] so without further delay I want to read
[37:45] a portion of the scripture for the young
[37:50] people to know what the little
[37:53] responsibilities are let us turn as the
[37:58] sunday school kids can stand for the
[38:02] reading of the Bible as we open our
[38:05] Bibles in the book of Proverbs proverbs
[38:10] the very first chapter
[38:16] proverb chapter one I want to read from
[38:23] verse seven if you find it from your
[38:29] Bible you can say Amen so that your
[38:32] parent can know you are now in
[38:34] activities you are serving God you are
[38:38] reading your Bible and you are paying
[38:41] attention to the lesson going on this
[38:43] morning as I'm making this audio for the
[38:47] Sunday school kids so from verse 70
[38:51] Bible said the fear of the Lord is the
[38:54] beginning of knowledge but fools despise
[38:58] wisdom and instruction my son hear the
[39:03] instruction of the father and forsake
[39:07] not the law of thy mother made a lot add
[39:12] a blessing to the reading of the
[39:14] scripture you may be seated
[39:17] so my little message for you today is as
[39:21] you all see what is taking place this is
[39:26] something they never be opened before
[39:28] this is to show that we are at the end
[39:32] of the time this is a sign that our this
[39:36] world is dying if you can go outside for
[39:42] those who have the opportunity or look
[39:44] through the window you can see the
[39:47] street completely empty those who have
[39:52] the privilege to go to the shop to store
[39:55] you can see that it's like a dead City
[40:00] this is to tell you that the time to go
[40:04] home is close don't despise your u4h but
[40:12] instead lift up your head to know that
[40:17] they're going home time is here
[40:21] we have so far been trying to do our
[40:24] best to educate you to show you the way
[40:27] to
[40:28] serve the Lord but we don't know for our
[40:32] long steel we will be on this earth I
[40:34] own listening to me are you paying
[40:37] attention we don't want to be distracted
[40:40] and don't distract others please sit
[40:44] down relax pay close attention and don't
[40:48] sleep down to talk you may be some of
[40:53] you may be looking say well we know that
[40:55] voice we are trying to look where is he
[40:58] yes I'm just making the audio not a
[41:01] video just to communicate through this
[41:05] system you can hear my voice speaking to
[41:09] you so coming back to our topic
[41:11] so the going home time is close so we
[41:17] need to prepare ourself so as young
[41:21] people don't take this time or you know
[41:24] there is no school there is no homework
[41:27] there is no sunday school activities so
[41:30] what you have been doing let me ask you
[41:34] the question what have you been doing
[41:38] during this time without school without
[41:41] a church have you been praying have you
[41:46] been serving the Lord have you been
[41:49] helping your parent have you been
[41:52] obedient to your parent and today older
[41:57] or elders elders in your families if you
[42:01] want to make the rapture those who
[42:04] questions need to be addressed you don't
[42:09] need to come to Sunday school in order
[42:11] to be a good Christian but wherever you
[42:15] are whatever you are who you are doing
[42:18] always keep the Lord in mind that Jesus
[42:21] Christ is watching so therefore you need
[42:26] to continue to obey your parent
[42:29] respecting them respect the rules of the
[42:32] house and during his time give some
[42:36] hands to your parent your especially the
[42:40] girls have your bed
[42:41] you always affixed clean up the sisters
[42:45] in the kitchen helping the mom with the
[42:51] food cleaning up the dishes cleaning up
[42:54] the room especially during this time of
[42:57] crisis with the virus going on we need
[43:01] to maintain our home clean if we can
[43:07] disinfect our kitchen our bedroom our
[43:11] bathrooms so that germs cannot come and
[43:15] attack the family and above all to be
[43:18] clean ourselves to wash our hands and to
[43:24] be very careful in everything we are
[43:26] doing not to go on the street to shake
[43:29] people hands you know all the things we
[43:32] have to be very very careful and I trust
[43:36] that that's what you have been doing so
[43:40] may God richly bless you
[43:42] coming to the scripture we've had the
[43:45] Bible said the fear of the Lord is the
[43:49] beginning of knowledge so if you want to
[43:54] grow in the fear of the Lord and the
[43:57] knowledge of the Lord rather you have to
[44:00] learn how to fear the Lord it's not time
[44:03] to read magazines to play with the forms
[44:08] and have no time at all for prayer yo
[44:12] that's not right
[44:13] I want to exhort you this morning and
[44:16] going forward every day read your Bible
[44:21] well if you pray in a family that's
[44:23] great but most likely when you have your
[44:26] free time leave your sibling from time
[44:30] to time go into your bedroom kneel down
[44:33] pray and come out and do the rest of the
[44:36] thing and the from time to time go back
[44:40] into your room somewhere kneel down
[44:43] raise up your hand like Daniel in
[44:46] Babylon and pray God is certainly going
[44:50] to appreciate it and God is going to
[44:52] answer your prayer and
[44:55] will strengthen your household that will
[44:57] also strengthen their family so the next
[45:05] verse verse eight say my son I can
[45:07] adhere my son or my daughter here always
[45:12] the instruction of the Father dot verse
[45:16] eight the father is the head of the
[45:18] household
[45:19] he has instructions for you he will tell
[45:24] you what to do if your dad tell you go
[45:28] heat go pray go meditate please obey
[45:33] please do it and respect because the
[45:39] Bible said where we had the fear of the
[45:41] Lord is the beginning of knowledge so
[45:44] when you do that God sees what you are
[45:48] doing certainly God is going to bless
[45:51] you and the Bible said my son here the
[45:54] instruction of thy father and they add a
[45:59] contraction and forsake not the law of
[46:04] thy mother so God has given you a father
[46:09] to give you instructions and have also
[46:12] given you a mother to instruct you weave
[46:16] law and the teaching and directions on
[46:22] how to serve the Lord
[46:25] so my the main portion of my message is
[46:31] also to let you know that I know some of
[46:36] you can say well we don't listen to the
[46:39] voice of the pastor we don't see the
[46:41] pastor now we are playing tapes we are
[46:45] playing tapes sometimes we don't get it
[46:47] sometimes this sometimes that let me
[46:50] tell you brother Branham is our prophet
[46:54] the one God has sent to us with a
[47:00] special message with instructions and
[47:05] laws for us to be
[47:08] prepare for the rapture so in order for
[47:12] the father the mother to give you
[47:15] instruction they have to take it from
[47:18] the Bible and today the voice of Malachi
[47:22] 4 brother Branham the Prophet according
[47:25] to Malakal for our prophet is the
[47:29] breakdown or the way God has made it is
[47:36] simple for us to understand the Bible
[47:41] today is through the message so when we
[47:44] listen to the tape is means we are
[47:50] listening straight from God through the
[47:54] mouth of his prophet and this is how the
[47:57] Bible is made we see the Bible said Paul
[48:03] wrote Moses wrote this book and all
[48:07] these different writers they have
[48:09] written the Bible and when we read the
[48:12] Bible we said Paul said it's not really
[48:15] Paul saying it's God saying through the
[48:19] lips of porn and when we listen to the
[48:23] message is God speaking to us through
[48:26] the lips of brother branham so let me
[48:30] tell you those tapes every greater value
[48:35] everything the pastor preaches
[48:38] everything the Sunday School teachers
[48:41] preaches tells you they get them from
[48:45] the tapes and the books from brother
[48:49] Branham so at home when it's time to
[48:53] listen to the message just pray first
[48:57] and say note I don't want to be
[48:59] distracted Lord I don't want to add my
[49:02] mind elsewhere lord help me focus
[49:06] because now that the past has spoken to
[49:10] us when we listen to the tape it's God
[49:13] speaking through the lips of brother
[49:16] Branham oh my god let me listen to the
[49:19] voice of God
[49:20] let me listen to what God has to tell me
[49:23] today in different sermons that brother
[49:26] Bonham has ad preached do you get it let
[49:32] me say it in a very one more simple way
[49:35] so we need to be very reverent and
[49:40] focused when we are playing tapes and
[49:43] keep keeping in mind it's God speaking
[49:47] to us through the lips of brother
[49:51] Branham and whenever we go to church the
[49:54] pastor is preaching we know the pastor
[49:56] is speaking from what the prophet has
[50:01] spoken
[50:02] and what if prophet is a spoken--
[50:05] coming from God so let me tell you just
[50:09] be very very reverent we be very focused
[50:13] and one is time for service please
[50:16] respect the time please respect to the
[50:20] service let's say if we have a service
[50:22] Wednesday night or we are going to
[50:25] listen to a tape just be prepared the
[50:29] service starts at 7:00 p.m.
[50:30] let us by 6:30 p.m. we all read all
[50:35] already in the living room or wherever
[50:38] whom you gather in the family to pray
[50:43] take a seat those who know how to write
[50:47] take a piece of paper with a pencil or a
