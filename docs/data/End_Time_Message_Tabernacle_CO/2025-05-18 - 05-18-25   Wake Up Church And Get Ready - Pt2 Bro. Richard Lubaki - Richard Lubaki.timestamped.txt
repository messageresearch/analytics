[5:22] May God bless you this morning. If we
[5:25] can please stand.
[5:30] Psalm 143 from
[5:32] [Music]
[5:42] 1-6. Lord, hear my
[5:44] prayer. Listen on my cry for mercy. In
[5:49] your faithfulness and righteousness,
[5:51] come to my relief. Do not bring your
[5:55] servant into judgment. For no one living
[5:59] in is righteous before you. The enemy
[6:03] pursued me. He crushes me to the ground.
[6:07] He makes me dwell in the darkness like
[6:11] those long dead. So my spirit grow faint
[6:15] within me. My heart within me it is May.
[6:19] I remember the day of long ago. I
[6:23] meditate all your works. I consider what
[6:27] your hand has made. I spread out my hand
[6:31] to you. I pray for you like a purchase
[6:35] land. Amen.

[7:24] [Music]

[25:40] [Applause]
[25:43] [Music]
[25:51] Heavenly
[25:52] [Music]
[25:56] Father, we're with our heads bowed this
[26:00] morning and our arms
[26:05] raised as a soldier going to
[26:08] war. And when a certain
[26:11] time when the
[26:17] battle when the battle heightens, they
[26:20] could drop the their guns and raise
[26:22] their arms.
[26:25] Yes, Father, we're in a
[26:28] battle. We're in a
[26:30] [Music]
[26:31] journey and it sometimes
[26:35] happens that we can get tired and the
[26:38] devil can start doing
[26:40] But this morning we come with our arms
[26:44] raised to say,
[26:47] "Oh, that you take our
[26:50] arms and you take each of us,
[26:53] Lord and strengthen
[26:56] [Music]
[26:57] us. Thank you for the good
[26:59] health, for the breath of
[27:02] life. We thank you
[27:05] Lord. Your grace is always there for us.
[27:09] It strengthens
[27:11] us. But sometimes when we
[27:14] fail may what a wonderful
[27:17] God. We're so unworthy,
[27:20] Lord, we're worth
[27:22] nothing. But as William Brandham
[27:30] said, so that that we should come lay
[27:32] our hands on the
[27:34] lamb because that lamb is you, Jesus
[27:37] Christ.
[27:40] this morning with
[27:41] faith. Take your arms unworthy
[27:45] hands and place them on the
[27:48] lamb. William Brandham
[27:51] says, "It's not to look towards
[27:54] yourself, but it's to look towards the
[27:57] lamb."
[27:59] And if the lamb was found
[28:02] perfect, it's no longer about you.
[28:05] But that's why by
[28:08] faith, may the devil go
[28:10] back in Jesus Christ's
[28:13] name, we take our hands of
[28:16] faith on the
[28:18] sacrifice, the Lord Jesus
[28:21] Christ, the one who already
[28:24] died. And we don't want
[28:29] at
[28:32] that declare that the child of our
[28:34] brothers in Jesus Christ's name, oh God
[28:37] of
[28:38] grace, if it was it was if it wasn't for
[28:41] your
[28:43] grace, but we're here by your
[28:46] grace because of that
[28:53] bloodach be found in good health.
[28:59] We come to adore
[29:01] you. We don't come to worship a
[29:04] man, but we come because there's
[29:06] something in us that draws us towards
[29:09] you. Accept us
[29:11] as each
[29:15] woripper and may the sacrifice
[29:17] of beg agreeable unto
[29:20] you. Oh beloved
[29:22] father, thank you for this wonderful
[29:25] song as we've just
[29:29] sang regardless
[29:32] of no
[29:38] matter the design of God in
[29:41] our such a a mighty God like
[29:44] you. Now heavenly
[29:47] father service as we recommend this
[29:50] service to
[29:53] May you accept the
[29:57] song token of our appreciation towards
[29:59] you. You
[30:01] love May you bless the service from
[30:03] beginning to
[30:04] end. May you bless the tits and offering
[30:07] your may you remember our pastor
[30:11] that's as he's going there
[30:14] for strengthen him.
[30:17] May
[30:18] you may you give him a long
[30:21] way so that he could always
[30:24] be him the watch man that you've given
[30:27] to
[30:27] us. Help him Lord.
[30:31] May you give him more
[30:32] life and raise him
[30:35] up so that he could do nothing but
[30:38] your blessed
[30:41] servant. We want to hear from
[30:44] you because the word coming from you
[30:47] gives
[30:48] life but
[30:51] words only bring confusion. May you
[30:55] anoint so that the words he says give us
[30:59] life.
[31:01] as it's later than we
[31:03] think. We really need the Holy
[31:06] Spirit so that we can be
[31:09] good. Lord, if you're
[31:11] here that have these days, but they are
[31:16] tired, Lord, strengthen
[31:21] them. May you remember your bride all
[31:23] around the
[31:25] world. May you remember
[31:28] the remember
[31:30] Israel as we commit ourselves unto him
[31:33] humbly.
[31:35] in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen.
[31:37] Amen.
[31:44] God bless you. Amen. Are you ready to
[31:46] worship him this morning? Amen. Love
[31:49] lifted
[31:56] me. Oh, I was
[32:00] sinking deep in sin.
[32:04] Far from the peaceful
[32:07] show. Oh, very
[32:12] we stand with him, singing to rise no
[32:18] more.
