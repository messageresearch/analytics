[0:09] true will reveal himself and it will be
[0:15] by my process oh yes that is so that's
[0:20] aggravation 1070 and in the days of the
[0:24] voice of the seventh messenger when it
[0:28] shall begin to sound in other word
[0:31] that's showing you the mystery of its
[0:35] Babylon in how is destroying wonderfully
[0:38] the mystery of God should be finished
[0:42] why are all this happened why are all
[0:46] these things happened why are we facing
[0:48] it
[0:49] are we not the sons of God are we were
[0:52] supposed to be the ones who's just come
[0:54] and worship and live with yourself
[0:56] but then when his men come he has to why
[1:02] are all these things are taking it goes
[1:05] into Isaiah it shows you that this man
[1:08] has been in his heart was doing that and
[1:13] it shows you how we came about in
[1:16] destroying wonderfully in the case of
[1:21] Manuel the angel came down logically in
[1:24] the case of our office Joseph and Mary
[1:26] he came through the dream we do it for
[1:30] you question mark and even if the God
[1:35] comes to them immensity of the devil and
[1:37] tell them a lot

[2:02] it gets here it goes out there they hold
[2:05] on to the revelation keeps no light upon
[2:09] light until all of the revelation is
[2:12] opened before wandering eyes because
[2:16] they understand and of the ages comes
[2:19] the seal
[2:20] I love the seals of the trumpets are the
[2:22] trumpets reveals
[2:28] they know in a period of time there is a
[2:31] mr. behind me there is a reason why
[2:34] those things are happening and the god
[2:36] is flowing the trumpet to let them know
[2:38] what kind of mysteries that and also you

[2:44] people will have a few so this is your
[2:45] law just as as they're shown as just as
[2:48] is the kill shows us has all the Bible
[2:50] shows that renders it after they've done
[2:53] all the services that they ever
[2:56] destroyed but you alter they've tried to
[2:58] to break you down and you stand as a
[3:10] mighty by him as a mighty man of the
[3:12] white computer the new commandment that
