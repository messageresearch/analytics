to the Village if God gives you the opportunity to come in Africa you are more than welcome in my church where about Tabernacle I love you and uh yeah with the posterity yesterday the pastor was answering me back while we were eating at the table is he said uh this guy moved really uh difficult uh we have hard time to move around is a company I understand that he was telling me that it will not come soon to be right he shouldn't be expecting people to come we had really good time continuity I'm trying to speak about the law of continuity it's a dream it's one of the law by which God is ruling over the universe it's God who created this universe hey it is raining over this you all Universe by his laws remember introduction they start giving it it's even an expression of his dead hello in the world says continue with it one of them laws is the law of continuity uh of it I read it is I said job had the same perspective of that law of the nature we will see the prophet him also the prophet IC yeah now continue with the the Lord he said there was there is a continuity of the law of the nature like continuity the last few the continuity of the action of the spirit of God will continue with the LA parole the continuity of the word of God see continuity if I can recap the law of the continuity of the nature shows those are things that are leading us what's up you can see it if you throw a rock in a lake of water you can see the waves spreading from where you drop the rock uh it will go uh indefinitely Mala temperatures there is a spreading of that movement all the way to far away from you all that I'm saying is a prophet who's speaking about it and see never lost it's the same thing about every motion that we are doing yes sir concert when I move like this it's gone [Music] this movement is spreading and it's moving around the whole universe without sneezing strategic for example [Music] it's the same way when Kane killed Abel the Lord came after he told him where is that brother he had a very weird answer am I the keeper of my brother a socialist satanic that's a satanic Style I'm not my greatest keeper [Applause] but the devil he doesn't think he can watch over somebody his work is to destroy the other person he cannot have somebody to walk come on come on somebody's house experience a country like this when he stays in my My Brother's Keeper told him [Music] the voice of the blood of your brother is crying unto me amen [Music] [Music] [Music] and keep on going all the way [Music] there's none of our words that disappear Ed let me tell you a lot of certain shows about certain things everything that is fear or a prophet does is to get into the nature he'll pay um he can hear your voice [Music] by the nature structures everything that you see against somebody sandwiches forever you will never be disappeared know that the love continuity works on that Falls that's where the strength of the blood of Jesus Christ it's only the blood of Jesus that can take a evil action and take it away if it's not through them everything that we have already done things that we already said it's in the universe it's never lost look have in in Syria he had to go uh to war with against the Assyrians [Music] it took a Jonathan the king of Judah if we believe in injury foreign [Music] [Music] foreign I have knowing that the Lord said if you go come back alive I don't want to address myself as a king because when I come back people can see me [Music] if a guy when he was King neighbors the nature saw him killing that man [Music] [Music] everything that we say and react upon it it's a very deep love hello he told Jonathan you dress like he's a king and in the nature there was no evil action of Jonathan he was an innocent man [Music] [Music] to my neighbor because I'm not dressing as a king [Music] [Music] [Music] went exactly to him and that was it everything that we do to schedule everything that we say is nothing that disappears there is only a one way that makes things to disappear if we can just dip it don't understand in the blood of the Lord Jesus they said that means confesses confess your wrong upon the blood [Music] unfortunately for me it's already the next thing yeah this is the law of continuity I don't want to hurt you I don't like to see you with this face by the law of continuity Works amen thank you Lord many things that I believe the Holy Ghost can speak to you it says to complete you are alone that's how we can tell a man come to your best son go when you were five you did this week when you were 18 or only where are we reading it amenity cycle kittens living one city going to another city will not erase your sin he let the shall capture the Parliamentary it's already been caused by the nature lucky for us God is giving us another chance I've seen yes is there any possibility yes because [Music] Beyond any resurrection and they cannot come back but this morning I would like if God grant me his grace definition according to this law of continuity it continues it's God which is action is continues his word is uh continue continues [Music] chapter eight every week [Music] the Bible said this from the first verse capital the secondary now of the things which we have spoken and tell the surveillance certificate this is the sum we have such high priests [Music] who is that on the right hand of the Throne of the Majesty in the heavens I love this is Century of the true Tabernacle which the law pitched and not a man Japanese I bless God for a such a high priest who stayed at the right end of the Majesty of Heaven done this year in heaven communist registructure as a minister of the century for every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices wherefore it's of necessary that if this man have somehow also to offer some White household to offer we basket because we established this high priest the sacrifices of her is to offer sacrifices and offerings because we also we have a high priestess prison he also had to have something to offer tools all the high priests in the past could present the gods of honeybees as sacrifice the offering that he presented wasn't an animal by us of himself [Music] [Music] think that they are priests that offer gift according to the Lord that's where I draw my in my thoughts they offer offering according to the law the girl and guilt this is the example is a high priest on the earth illustriable and killed the serve the service emerge um a shadow of heavenly things as Moses was abdomished of God lord when he was about to make the Tabernacle a Christian Refugee and what was to talk to Moses amen be careful be careful to do everything according to the power guitar in the mountain he showed him something and Moses the very reputation had to build on the earth until the time in give it details this pattern this model that is built on the earth the great vision was given unto him to look up to heaven and to see something and to reproduce the same things and it was ordained by God be careful oh the first two to do all things according to the parents show today I'm reading the seventh Angels William Branham 13 [Music] . Jewish the dedication of uh age July 8th when the Venom stays then God brought Moses [Music] on the burning a mountain declares whether it's the light was shining and thunder was thundering is Dwelling Place he wanted to dwell on the earth therefore is Moses took as a moral for the terrestrial Tabernacle circular what is so in heaven Earth A Century of the Lord and what was that Century in a world of success all them things were announcing Christ amen sister still even the tools kill yourself everything spoke of Christ God brought Moses to the mountains it showed him 20 to clear Christmas [Music] that means the Tabernacle of Moses what's the image was the Shadow the kiss of Christ [Music] [Music] [Music] we're not it was a moving Tabernacles there was a hobby and that was the person of Christ the century of the Lord please tell us Christ the perfect Century Of God all the furnitures oh la la is this Tabernacle speaks of Jesus of Christ I'm cheating a little bit young Vista I think that it's a little breach for me hello I'm bringing you back to the Bible where I will draw my little lessons for today Numbers chapter four chapter four if you can go along with me uh we're just gonna read few verses they were about to move the Tabernacle wow there were instructions and the Numbers number four uh verse five energy parasam it says for example and when the camper set it forward is [Music] shall come and his son they shall take down the covering there is because that Tabernacle is three parts of holy Muse it's where you sitting here you are in our court a lot and the outer is the uh holy place and the prophet is the Holiness of holy Julius to live to move from the holy to a holiest place there was a covering a veil [Music] [Music] [Music] extend above it Andra on tierma de tough blue I and they shall spread over the clothed holy of blue okay and they shall spread over it foreign had to be covered fully [Music] with a sheet of blue color everything spoke of Christ don't forget that verse seven verse the third verse 7 is and probably depends and upon the table of shoe bread they shall spread the clothes of blue and call and God bless you another blue cloth that is coming back set for this regular doubly dependent proposition this time it's upon the true bread positions and the table of shoe bread was in the holiest of Holy Spirit and they put there on the dishes the spoons and the Bloods and all the so forth totally dependent proposition the whole table of shoe bread convertible was covered by blue clothes and I retain this because all the Furnitures of the Tabernacle the spoke of Christ verse 9. [Music] everything had to be covered by a blue [Applause] is tied to a blue color [Music] speak of God of the blue color there is a relationship that attract Christ in the blue color currently Four Corners when he had to be moved on envelope he has to be covered with the blue color also the plus of the three dollars we are moving along with him in the blue color had a vision of the glory of God yes and we can read the glory of God in Ezekiel chapter 20 28 no no first chapter Ezekiel Ezekiel first chapter is our reader from verse 26 juskovan tweet to all the way to 28. the Bible says verse 26. and above the firmament that was over the heads the heads of the living uh beings there was something this is the the the appearance of the Southfield Stone can Castro's the thumb something in the likeness of suffered Stone and formed the throne in form of the likeness of Thrones don't let Throne may not miss the throne setting in Pierre was like a stone in Pierre de safety it's a few Stone the throne the likeness of the appearance of the men above upon him we know the one sitting on the throne in heaven is the Lord Of Glory Allah [Music] it's the stone of a beautiful blue totally blue angelibly and a beautiful blue if there's somebody in Heavens oh my police [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] within it [Music] and from the appearance of the loans even downwards as soon as it was the appearance of the fire is fully surrounded by lightning a brightness it's fully within the fire fully within the lights from the lowest upward the Reformation foreign as the as the appearance of the boat that is in the cloud in the day of rain on your own the light that was around him and come lock is like a Ark IE [Music] that is in the cloud in the day of rain we all know that is in the heaven in the clouds the Lord comes here it's a rainbow [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] he's surrounded by the Light of the rainbow one of the light is the blue color when you have to represent the plasma in the moment of his moving foreign and I want to ask foreign that is where I read in Hebrews 6 and 7. the Blessed of Peter's sister said Hebrew chapter 6 7 Bank of something paragraph 1 24. I love the word journey I love the Lord Jesus he says this is this great Forerunner went before us okay it's the truth you know that not true sovereign [Music] the list [Music] the great Fountain of

I'm repeating the Bible and the message now listen the Bible says he has been cast down the accuser of the bread the bread the one who was accusing them day and night that means every day every night
