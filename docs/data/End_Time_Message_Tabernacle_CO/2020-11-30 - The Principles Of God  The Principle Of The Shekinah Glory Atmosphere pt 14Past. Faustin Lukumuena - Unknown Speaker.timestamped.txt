[4:05] visitation special
[4:08] anointing to bless your
[4:10] people if they have any
[4:13] request
[4:15] anything be the
[4:17] answer for I
[4:19] ask in Jesus Christ
[4:22] name amen amen as we are
[4:27] standing let us uh
[4:30] open our Bible in the book of
[4:34] Hebrews
[4:35] Hebrews chapter
[4:38] 9 just to save some
[4:42] time those who have in French they can
[4:45] be reading directly from their
[4:50] Bible we will just because it's a little
[4:53] bit longer read
[4:56] reading uh from this reading it's
[4:58] showing in the
[5:01] Bible there are
[5:03] three uh
[5:06] compartment in the
[5:10] sanctuary and uh we want to speak
[5:13] tonight about uh the principles of the
[5:18] glory
[5:25] atmosphere I mean we have been talking
[5:28] since uh Sunday about uh the principle
[5:31] of the atmosphere in for the third
[5:37] pool and then we said that atmosphere is
[5:40] what bring
[5:43] result and I believe with all our needs
[5:46] our
[5:49] problems we need to come to
[5:52] understand that it's just the atmosphere
[5:56] just
[5:57] atmosphere the atmosphere is what is
[6:01] going to produce whatever you
[6:06] need we can pray it's
[6:10] good but if we are praying in a wrong
[6:14] atmosphere nothing can
[6:17] happen as we spoke about the principle
[6:21] with the egg that have to
[6:26] hatch so that we are going to continue
[6:29] because we believe there is a special
[6:33] secret place where the atmosphere has to
[6:46] be stop
[6:48] this first part God willing on
[6:56] Sunday sometimes it takes a lot of
[7:05] may be very helpful
[7:10] for yes but we will still continue with
[7:13] the subject
[7:18] afterward Hebrews chapter 9 verse uh
[7:21] verse 1
[7:25] to2 then verely the first Covenant had
[7:29] also so ordinances of divine service and
[7:32] a worldly
[7:33] Sanctuary for there was a tabernacle
[7:36] made the first wherein was the
[7:40] Candlestick and the table and the shoe
[7:43] bread which is called the sanctuary and
[7:46] after the second Veil The Tabernacle
[7:49] which is called the holiest of all which
[7:52] had the golden sensor and the Ark of the
[7:55] Covenant overlaid round about with gold
[7:59] wherein was the golden pot that had mana
[8:03] and Aon road that bed and the tables of
[8:08] the Covenant and over it the cherubin of
[8:13] the of Glory shadowing The Mercy Seat of
[8:17] which we cannot now speak particularly
[8:20] now when the things were thus ordained
[8:23] the priest went always into the first
[8:26] Tabernacle accomplishing the service of
[8:29] God but into the second went the high
[8:32] priest alone once every year not without
[8:37] blood which he offered for himself and
[8:41] for the error of the people the Holy
[8:44] Ghost this signifying that the way into
[8:49] the holiest of all was not yet made
[8:52] manifest while as the first Tabernacle
[8:56] was yet standing which was a figure of
[9:00] the time then present in which were
[9:03] offered both gifts and sacrifices that
[9:07] could not make him that uh did the
[9:10] service perfect as pertaining to this
[9:14] conscience weave stood only in
[9:19] meats and drinks and diverse washing and
[9:23] caral ordinances imposed on them until
[9:27] the time of reformation but Christ being
[9:31] come on high priest of good things to
[9:34] come by a greater and more perfect
[9:37] Tabernacle not made with hands that is
[9:40] to say not of this building neither by
[9:44] the blood of goats and cves but by his
[9:48] own blood he entered in once into the
[9:52] holy Place having ordained Eternal
[9:55] Redemption for us may the Lord bless the
[9:59] reading of the
[10:01] scripture you may be
[10:04] seated so from uh last
[10:08] Sunday we said that
[10:12] uh uh brother bam said in the message
[10:15] humble
[10:18] thyself and uh saying that it takes of
[10:21] all of us
[10:24] together that's in the message humble
[10:26] thyself paragraph 74 and just
[10:33] capitulating if you can go as I go a
[10:36] little bit F to go out
[10:43] earlier he said and it takes all of us
[10:48] all
[10:49] together if we want to see the third
[10:52] pool really do something for
[10:58] God
[11:00] it's a coordination with everyone of us
[11:10] together to Humble ourselves before
[11:14] God and confess our
[11:18] wrong and pray and believe God for these
[11:23] things so what we are saying it's really
[11:27] a
[11:27] reality
[11:30] if we can coordinate with one
[11:34] another in Perfect
[11:38] Harmony and uh humble
[11:42] ourselves before God and confess our
[11:46] wrong we are going to see these
[11:50] things and uh as we
[11:54] said the Tabernacle has three pieces
[12:01] part so the in a court where everybody
[12:07] sit and the holy
[12:10] place but there has also the holiest of
[12:15] holy and uh that's the
[12:19] place with the principle of
[12:23] uh
[12:25] God if you want enter in that place
[12:30] you will never be the
[12:32] same that's a
[12:35] principle if you don't get
[12:38] in you will remain in the outer
[12:43] court and you will still continue to
[12:45] have your ups and
[12:48] down and you will be worried about
[12:51] things of this
[12:53] world and uh we'll never be
[12:57] satisfied you may be a little bit happy
[13:01] today but tomorrow there is a
[13:04] problem you will be
[13:06] complaining and it will be always like
[13:09] that but
[13:11] God works always with
[13:15] principles and if we want to receive
[13:18] something from
[13:19] God we have just to follow his
[13:23] principle if you want really to be
[13:27] changed the veil of the temple was
[13:32] rented leaving giving free
[13:36] access to whosoever
[13:39] Will and the principle is Once you walk
[13:43] into that
[13:46] inqu and the veil falls behind
[13:50] you you are sound
[13:54] proof and because you become sound proof
[14:00] you are in the presence of
[14:02] God and in such
[14:05] presence ask what you
[14:08] will and it's going to happen the
[14:11] problem is with our
[14:14] prayers sometimes our prayers become
[14:16] even a
[14:19] recitation because we do those
[14:23] prayers in the
[14:27] court we where there is a lot of
[14:30] noise and that's the reason why you
[14:33] might be praying but your mind is not
[14:37] connected with
[14:39] God you are
[14:41] distracted while praying you are
[14:44] thinking about your job you are thinking
[14:47] about your bills maybe something that
[14:50] somebody did to
[14:51] you then you feel still
[14:55] offended but once you are in the inner
[14:57] Court you are connected sound proof you
[15:02] don't even know what
[15:04] happened those who think that you are
[15:08] missing they think you are lacking
[15:11] doesn't mean anything to you
[15:14] anymore amen amen so brother said in the
[15:20] message paragraph
[15:27] 10
[15:31] he said because it's always the
[15:34] atmosphere that brings the
[15:39] results it's always the
[15:43] atmosphere that brings
[15:45] results if you need
[15:47] results the only thing you have to look
[15:51] for is the atmosphere atmosphere and
[15:55] continue paragraph 11 can lay a seed out
[16:00] there in the
[16:03] ground no matter how much that seed is
[16:10] gered and lay it
[16:14] there it got to have an atmosphere to
[16:17] have it
[16:20] live amen amen when you plant a seed
[16:25] regardless of how many
[16:27] chemicals
[16:30] regardless of how many things you will
[16:34] do it will only
[16:38] gerti according to God's
[16:41] principle and that
[16:43] principle is the
[16:46] atmosphere and
[16:47] rain water
[16:50] Sunshine is part of God's
[16:53] principle to make it
[16:56] grow outside of the
[16:59] principle nothing can
[17:02] work it's the same with
[17:04] us we can be
[17:06] planted regardless of the
[17:10] church regardless of the
[17:13] Tabernacle it will take the
[17:16] atmosphere and the first room of the
[17:21] atmosphere is what is in
[17:24] you
[17:25] amen if inside of you
[17:29] you cannot have an
[17:32] atmosphere they can take you sit you in
[17:35] the BAM
[17:37] tab nothing is going to
[17:41] happen because the brother
[17:44] himself
[17:46] recognized wherever people are
[17:49] gathering
[17:51] wherever there are three category of
[17:55] people amen amen so regardless
[17:59] there are the three category so your
[18:02] category can only
[18:05] change depending on the atmosphere
[18:08] coming out of
[18:11] yourself same thing with the
[18:15] cup the sun has to come to a certain
[18:21] power
[18:23] before bring it to a certain
[18:27] atmosphere atere so the
[18:30] sun heating the
[18:32] crop will produce
[18:36] atmosphere because without
[18:39] atmosphere it will not
[18:41] grow and continue talking about an
[18:47] egg as to have an
[18:50] atmosphere or it won't
[18:53] h no matter how fertile it
[18:57] is got to have that
[19:01] atmosphere no matter how fertile the
[19:04] ground the dirt can
[19:07] be it takes the
[19:11] atmosphere amen
[19:13] amen also in the message the Inner
[19:18] Man paragraph
[19:21] 61 brother said let their faith just
[19:26] meet that condition
[19:30] and it will
[19:31] be for thou has
[19:33] said as thou has believed in thy
[19:38] heart so shall it be and I pray that you
[19:42] will grant that
[19:46] tonight and make the whole atmosphere
[19:51] here Lord a creative atmosphere an
[19:55] atmosphere creative of One S
[19:59] one mind one Accord one purpose Grant it
[20:06] Lord so if I have that atmosphere in
[20:10] me you have that atmosphere in you and
[20:14] all together with the same
[20:18] atmosphere we don't need
[20:21] prayer result will
[20:23] come and that was the atmosphere in the
[20:26] upper room
[20:29] one mind one Accord everything together
[20:35] one
[20:36] purpose and brother said Grant it
[20:40] Lord hear my prayer I pray this that you
[20:45] will grant it to
[20:48] us in the name of Jesus
[20:52] Christ thy beloved Son
[20:55] amen and he continue by saying
[20:59] my
[21:00] heart so aners to see that
[21:06] atmosphere after the prayer he said my
[21:10] heart so anger to see that
[21:15] atmosphere see see the
[21:19] atmosphere is what brings
[21:24] it and that atmosphere is very important
[21:30] wherever we
[21:32] be in our home in
[21:35] ourself in the church
[21:38] workplace in our
[21:40] fellowship if there is that
[21:44] atmosphere brother Bram
[21:46] said the
[21:49] newspaper will be
[21:51] packed saying that something
[21:54] happened but the contrary of that at
[21:59] atere you know complaining complaining
[22:03] complaining is also an
[22:08] atmosphere which is contrary to the
[22:11] atmosphere of
[22:14] Faith amen Amen brother those are
[22:21] principles I know the Bible
[22:24] said God give me don't give me too
[22:29] much
[22:32] because sometimes when you get too
[22:35] much you will forget
[22:38] God and I think that will be in the
[22:41] second part when I come to the
[22:48] principles sometimes we we say we are
[22:52] humble or we are
[22:55] nothing sometimes it's because we don't
[22:57] have
[22:59] but let us
[23:00] have then we will find out who is really
[23:06] humble amen amen and that's the book of
[23:11] proverb if I don't have sometimes you
[23:14] can be a good
[23:16] Christian but the lack of certain
[23:20] things can cause you to complain too
[23:25] much Lord why I'm trying to BU
[23:29] it's not working my kids not working my
[23:34] wife my husband things are not
[23:38] working and if you don't watch the
[23:42] atmosphere your result will never
[23:46] change you will get into a negative
[23:51] atmosphere of complain complain and
[23:56] sometimes you will ass associate
[23:59] yourself with people who are
[24:03] complaining and a bunch of
[24:07] complainers will not change the
[24:10] result because we need to be
[24:14] associated with a people of
[24:17] faith I'm lacking I'm
[24:20] lacking but I'm associate with somebody
[24:22] who got
[24:24] faith somebody who can help me lift up
[24:27] the faith
[24:29] oh brother you know what you are going
[24:31] through I was also a young man I was
[24:34] also single but look at what I did I
[24:38] kept the faith and today all the things
[24:41] are
[24:42] behind it going to it's going to help
[24:45] you but if you associate
[24:48] yourself what else to
[24:51] do in this world you victim like me and
[24:57] we even don't know if God still answer
[25:00] prayers when you get into such an
[25:04] atmosphere you are
[25:08] done so
[25:10] atmosphere is something to
[25:13] watch when brother is
[25:15] saying the atmosphere will
[25:19] bring result I believe
[25:24] it if brother use all those example of
[25:28] the egg to
[25:32] hatch that that's a
[25:35] message and he preached several
[25:38] sermon on the
[25:41] Supernatural and you know they C I'm
[25:43] reading the
[25:45] supernatural in the message
[25:48] Supernatural they other title for that
[25:51] message is a spiritual
[25:54] atmosphere if you are in the correct
[25:57] spiritual
[25:59] atmosphere will bring results if the
[26:02] atmosphere is not
[26:05] correct regardless of what you
[26:08] do there is no
[26:10] result the egg will never
[26:14] hatch so we have to watch it
[26:17] correctly see the atmosphere is what
[26:20] bring
[26:22] it if every person
[26:25] here will get in
[26:28] one Perfect
[26:32] Harmony Perfect
[26:35] Harmony it will settle it it will be
[26:39] settle amen amen so brother sometimes we
[26:42] don't have to complain looking solution
[26:49] elsewhere if you be part of
[26:52] it you be part of it I am part of
[26:56] it with one
[26:59] mind one Accord
[27:02] brother every meeting will be
[27:08] special God is Duty Bound by his
[27:15] principle and Bram
[27:17] said the egg to hatch is to put it under
[27:21] the
[27:25] H and it will hat
[27:28] because it's the
[27:30] atmosphere and toward the end put it in
[27:33] an
[27:35] incubator you put it they put in America
[27:38] all the eggs they put them in the
[27:42] machines it's h
[27:44] anyhow see it's the
[27:48] atmosphere that brings forth the
[27:52] result amen amen in the message super
[27:55] the
[27:56] supernatural
[27:58] I think we read it Sunday but I want to
[28:00] touch it a little bit
[28:04] again paragraph
[28:06] 20 he said he has been talking about
[28:10] atmosphere
[28:12] atmosphere it's not the atmosphere of
[28:15] the
[28:17] building it's the atmosphere of the
[28:19] people in the
[28:22] building that's what I want to stress
[28:25] out but it the attitude of the people
[28:29] that brings the
[28:33] results that's the reason at
[28:37] Pentecost they had to go to an upper
[28:41] room and pray until the Holy Ghost
[28:45] came because they got in one
[28:49] place and one Accord it's the
[28:54] atmosphere that brings the results and
[28:57] they say in the upper room we got a
[29:01] promise we are here
[29:03] together to make that promise come to
[29:08] happen Peter one
[29:11] mind Mary one mind each one of them not
[29:17] fighting but it was one mind Lord you
[29:21] promise we are here to be witnessed and
[29:26] after while
[29:27] people came from the street what are
[29:30] what happening here speaking in
[29:33] different tongues why because that's
[29:37] what the atmosphere
[29:40] does and Bram
[29:43] said you believe
[29:46] that let every
[29:48] man and woman in this building this
[29:53] morning boy or
[29:55] girl get every from their
[29:59] mind but the Lord
[30:01] Jesus and believe that he is standing
[30:05] present right
[30:08] now if right now we can have that in our
[30:13] mind everything else out but have Christ
[30:18] in our mind that Lord you promise Lord
[30:22] you promise Lord you promise and let
[30:25] this
[30:26] happen am Bram
[30:30] said you will see something
[30:34] happening that will cause headlines in
[30:37] the newspaper in the
[30:41] morning that's right it's atmosphere
[30:46] atere and he said I don't believe in
[30:49] joking from the
[30:52] pulpit because he said this in
[30:56] connection
[30:58] to the sense of humor that brother B
[31:05] of um he said if you take a
[31:09] egg you put it under the body of a
[31:15] puppy I don't have it don't have to be
[31:18] under the
[31:21] hand it can be under
[31:26] the it could be in an
[31:30] incubator it's the atmosphere atere and
[31:33] it's the
[31:35] atmosphere that brings the
[31:38] miraculous
[31:41] wonders and power of God Among the
[31:45] people it's the atmosphere of the
[31:50] people it's not the atmosphere of the
[31:55] building it's not the atmosphere of the
[31:59] preacher the preacher will bring the cat
[32:02] for
[32:04] you but we have all together to be in
[32:08] that
[32:10] atmosphere and it's the
[32:13] atmosphere that will bring the
[32:16] miraculous and that's why last
[32:20] Sunday I touch about applying the
[32:26] token
[32:28] uh you know some things some many
[32:32] things are the things that kill the
[32:37] atmosphere and sometimes we don't
[32:41] know they are many things that kill the
[32:45] atmosphere
[32:47] atere it's not just a simple uh bad
[32:55] conversation but within yourself
[32:59] even the thing we
[33:01] dress can bring certain
[33:08] atmosphere brother talks about
[33:12] names that we give to our
[33:15] children he said if you give him a name
[33:18] of
[33:20] Ricky that
[33:22] means that will create a certain
[33:25] atmosphere of Ricky's
[33:31] spirit I don't want to read that quot
[33:34] but I think many of you you know
[33:38] it the name you give to
[33:42] somebody has an
[33:44] impact father how do you explain
[33:47] that I believe
[33:51] it not only
[33:55] name
[33:58] also even the toys we give to our
[34:05] children it can
[34:08] impact
[34:10] clothes you put certain
[34:14] clothes you
[34:16] know in con I
[34:19] saw somebody wearing a
[34:23] t-shirt they call it
[34:25] s
[34:27] but if you look it
[34:30] closely it's seen
[34:43] bad you know it can be some of the name
[34:47] it can be as
[34:50] easy even what our parent has given to
[34:55] us if your the meaning of your
[34:59] name is something that is
[35:03] wrong rather change
[35:05] it brother bam said if it's not
[35:09] so why then God changed the name of
[35:14] Jacob why God changed the name of
[35:20] sa why God change the name of Abraham to
[35:25] Abraham
[35:27] because he have to be the father of
[35:30] nation so the name we give to our
[35:34] children have
[35:36] meaning and sometimes Believers in the
[35:40] message a lot of
[35:43] zeal we don't want to name our kid Sarah
[35:48] anymore Rea or it old
[35:52] names they start looking for
[35:55] names I saw one in the
[35:59] Congo
[36:01] baz it's a last
[36:04] name it's good Neville Neville is not
[36:09] the first
[36:11] name his name was
[36:14] nille but we take it as it's not
[36:18] bad but I found in a
[36:22] con all those name we have to dig in the
[36:25] message
[36:27] somebody name his
[36:33] child because it's in the brochure it's
[36:36] in the
[36:37] books but have you trace down the
[36:45] life do you know and I don't want to
[36:48] tell you what it
[36:49] is my point is to make you
[36:53] think what you
[36:55] give be
[36:58] sure it's not I'm finding a name to
[37:01] impress the
[37:04] people you know all those Sarah Rea Ruth
[37:08] has been given all the
[37:11] time I want to find something
[37:15] special pray for it because the name has
[37:20] impact and Bram said if you have a bad
[37:24] name change it
[37:27] not only
[37:29] name even
[37:32] toys clothes on the
[37:34] people even
[37:37] us we want to dress
[37:40] up you know most of the men the suit we
[37:46] wear the label they put
[37:51] here it's not for us to show
[37:54] off they put it in the
[37:58] R to make
[38:02] differences but for us you buy
[38:06] anything you find a
[38:10] label dolls and
[38:12] gabana do you know do and
[38:15] gabana do you know those
[38:19] people actually they are
[38:25] homosexual
[38:29] brother we have to be careful in what we
[38:32] are
[38:34] doing what we are putting
[38:37] on because all those
[38:40] things
[38:42] brother understand it the way you
[38:45] want but my point is about the
[38:49] atmosphere if that thing is not going to
[38:52] help create a good
[38:55] atmosphere atmosphere you know what to
[39:00] do
[39:06] Gucci oh grief grief grief oh no the
[39:09] brain the brain the brain it's like
[39:11] somebody wearing a Halloween
[39:15] costume amen amen they are
[39:18] costume or something to impress the
[39:21] people all those things create a certain
[39:25] atmosphere
[39:27] they take the candy at
[39:29] school they give to the kids and they
[39:32] eat those things but we have to be very
[39:35] very
[39:37] selective and in
[39:41] addition Even in our
[39:44] home what we bring
[39:46] in have to have to be
[39:51] censored because you can have a little
[39:54] things maybe a little St
[39:57] statute oh somebody gave me what was the
[40:01] purpose what that statute
[40:04] represent I don't know if I don't know
[40:07] get rid
[40:09] of you have to know exactly when you
[40:12] come to my home you find this picture
[40:15] you ask me what is it I will tell you
[40:19] you find this picture you ask me I will
[40:21] tell you and in my mind I believe those
[40:26] things
[40:26] create a certain
[40:28] atmosphere but in the same mouth they
[40:32] cannot come hot
[40:33] water and cold water you have this and
[40:38] you have naked woman on the
[40:40] wall it's not it's not going to work
[40:44] it's going to fight
[40:46] atmosphere and if we talk about our
[40:50] home we have to watch
[40:52] also
[40:55] people visitors in our
[41:00] home excuse me but let me tell you
[41:04] this not
[41:07] everybody I have to welcome
[41:10] you we are not saying against
[41:14] Hospitality but I know what I'm
[41:17] saying even the hotel
[41:20] room you know what people go to do in
[41:23] the hotel
[41:24] room it's not all always about
[41:28] sex no you know what happened a few
[41:30] years ago in Las
[41:34] Vegas there was a guy buying guns all
[41:38] kind of
[41:39] guns putting in the hotel room he come
[41:44] go out he buy
[41:46] guns until the day he shoot how many
[41:50] remember the shooting in Las
[41:53] Vegas he was they found it different
[41:56] type of
[41:58] gun so people go in the hotel room for
[42:02] different
[42:03] purposes and per
[42:05] personally I never walk into a hotel
[42:09] room and sleep do whatever I do without
[42:14] praying
[42:15] first to cast out those
[42:20] spirit because there are Spirit left
[42:25] there there are people going for
[42:27] witchcraft
[42:30] purpose they call upon many
[42:34] demons and the demon
[42:36] respond they do whatever they have to
[42:39] do and they leave and leaving those
[42:43] spirit in the
[42:45] room and you walk in and you turn the
[42:49] TV to watch
[42:55] pornography which atmosphere you work
[42:57] out
[43:00] with and welcoming people in the
[43:05] house sometimes I I I start finding it
[43:08] becoming a little bit
[43:13] nasty people want to everything always
[43:16] free free free
[43:20] free uh sometimes we have
[43:22] to if you can respect a little bit
[43:25] yourself
[43:28] you go visit a
[43:30] brother there is a wedding
[43:33] somewhere if you don't have any way to
[43:37] go stay or I have to
[43:42] travel you have some place for me to
[43:46] sleep even in your living in your
[43:50] kitchen no no no no no it goes with our
[43:55] personality
[43:58] and sometimes your
[44:00] behavior will reflect on where you are
[44:03] coming
[44:07] from oh brother find even even in your
[44:15] toilet and
[44:18] then oh I will look
[44:21] for a place for you to
[44:25] go
[44:27] somebody here I will recommend
[44:31] you what is all these
[44:33] things welcoming people in our
[44:36] home and as going to any
[44:40] home it should not be a correct
[44:44] [Music]
[44:46] habit we have to excuse me
[44:51] but that's the
[44:54] reality
[44:56] all since you get free ticket on the
[44:59] standby stand by stand by you run every
[45:07] state what are you looking for I don't
[45:10] say that you can not to stay at the
[45:12] brother I don't say
[45:14] that but you have to find the middle
[45:19] yourself even if you receive guests in
[45:21] your
[45:24] home pray for
[45:27] them Lord I'm fulfilling the
[45:31] word because he say in so
[45:34] doing I can even Lodge
[45:38] Angels but not everybody is an
[45:43] angel as you receive
[45:45] Angels you may receive also
[45:49] somebody who's the contrary of the
[45:52] Angel when you are sleeping he's going
[45:55] to deposit a lot of
[45:58] spirit and he
[46:01] leave this happen this
[46:03] happen I don't know but
[46:07] uh I heard also one of U the
[46:13] pastor in South Africa pastor Beck he
[46:17] made a big
[46:19] study about those things say brother I
[46:23] don't allow myself and my kid to go
[46:25] sleep in all the houses no
[46:28] more and I don't take anybody in my
[46:31] house all the every
[46:36] time he's not the
[46:38] prophet but it's spoken out of a certain
[46:43] experience so that's the reason why Bram
[46:46] said we have to apply the
[46:49] token and to move out all the trash I'm
[46:53] in the message
[46:54] token paragraph
[46:57] 369 then what do you do when you apply
[47:00] it to your
[47:03] house we have to apply the token in our
[47:07] home therefore if we have to watch the
[47:11] little
[47:12] things uh the television out short skirt
[47:18] out even certain human being
[47:24] out move on the trash
[47:27] out get all the short
[47:31] skirts and the
[47:33] shorts the cards the cigarette
[47:37] televisions whatever more and kick them
[47:41] out of the
[47:43] door when you go apply the
[47:46] token won stand still for
[47:50] it yes sir take it out all the dances
[47:57] brother a prophet remain a
[48:00] prophet and sometimes we say we believe
[48:03] the
[48:04] prophet we believe the message but
[48:07] actually we
[48:08] don't because those things about the
[48:11] high
[48:12] heel the short
[48:14] skirt those uh artificial wigs and
[48:19] stuff has spoken about
[48:22] it what do we do with it
[48:27] those things cause a certain
[48:31] atmosphere and when we pray in our
[48:34] home sometimes our prayers go
[48:38] nowhere because of the atmosphere
[48:41] created by those
[48:43] things we thank God for the prophet all
[48:47] the dances and the parties and rock and
[48:52] roll and today we have rock and roll
[48:56] if was living in this day he could
[49:00] mention some of the the modern
[49:05] dances and all the vgar
[49:09] newspapers and the stuff that's of the
[49:13] world kick it out out the
[49:17] door say we are cleaning out this place
[49:20] around
[49:22] here let us clean our home
[49:26] and the same thing clean the
[49:29] church why do we have those
[49:31] pictures I have heard several people
[49:34] saying oh you know in
[49:37] America if you visit many
[49:41] churches they are afraid to put those
[49:45] pictures they say if a visitor walk
[49:49] in they will be
[49:51] stumbled but in theam
[49:54] Tabernacle it is
[49:57] in amen
[50:00] amen if there is a
[50:03] seed he will ask you what is
[50:06] it and you will break
[50:08] down if it's not a seed are you are
[50:12] worshiping a
[50:13] man and I'm not going to come back
[50:16] that's fine the bride will remain a
[50:22] minority all of us we were born
[50:26] not knowing the
[50:27] things one day they showed us the
[50:31] things depending on the day we could
[50:35] have criticized
[50:37] it but because of the
[50:40] seed God brought it
[50:42] back and we love it we believe it and
[50:47] brother even
[50:48] said
[50:50] since I always have one of this picture
[50:53] with
[50:54] me in my office in my car personally
[50:59] even in my
[51:02] wallet I always have one of the small
[51:07] picture of the cloud not all all all
[51:11] together the uh the identity card and so
[51:17] forth because the think create an
[51:21] atmosphere atere and if you understand
[51:23] it create an atmosphere
[51:27] don't do anything contrary to that when
[51:30] you have
[51:33] it because it become a
[51:39] curse you have this
[51:41] picture in your home but in the meantime
[51:46] you have a
[51:49] pornography that become a
[51:54] curse you are putting that cursed thing
[51:58] on the top of what is supposed to bring
[52:02] a good
[52:07] atmosphere amen amen in the message why
[52:11] are people so TOS
[52:13] about now brother start talking
[52:16] about
[52:19] the
[52:23] glory paragraph 18 d
[52:28] 7 in this holy Place Aon went once a
[52:35] year the congregation watched
[52:38] him he was dressed
[52:42] right he had you see when you go in that
[52:46] Holy
[52:48] place the way you dress
[52:53] matter he was dressed
[52:57] right he had to be anointed
[53:01] right which kind of anointing are you
[53:03] taking in that
[53:06] place he had to work
[53:09] right blessed be the Lord dress right
[53:14] walk right anoint
[53:17] right he had a bell and a pomegranate on
[53:21] His
[53:24] Garment
[53:27] and he walked they played holy holy unto
[53:30] the
[53:33] Lord he taken before him a charg of
[53:40] blood the blood of the
[53:43] Lamb the blood of the
[53:46] atonement and he was anointed with the
[53:49] rose of
[53:51] Sharon and you know we call Jesus The
[53:53] Rose of Sharon
[53:55] [Music]
[53:57] because it's that
[53:59] flower that was
[54:01] pressed to get the
[54:05] perfume that the high priest has to be
[54:08] Anointed
[54:10] with which was the type of God pressing
[54:16] Christ on the
[54:18] calvary so that the blood can
[54:21] come so that we can be Anointed with
[54:24] that blood
[54:26] when we come to
[54:27] worship because within
[54:30] ourselves we are not
[54:32] worthy that the
[54:35] anointing that help us into the presence
[54:38] of the
[54:40] Lord and the anointed roll of his beard
[54:44] Plum to the HS of his
[54:52] skirt he was walking into the in a court
[54:55] in the presence of
[54:59] God and when he went behind
[55:03] there the veil fell behind
[55:07] him and he was shut
[55:11] out he was hid from the outer
[55:16] World praise be to God there is a hiding
[55:22] place Abiding Place brother call it
[55:26] Abiding
[55:29] Place it's it's a place where you have
[55:32] to rest to dwell the rest of your
[55:36] life this is where the right atmosphere
[55:41] is and that's the atmosphere that will
[55:44] produce the third
[55:47] pole not to be in and
[55:50] out but a Abiding
[55:54] Place a secret place so as we are
[55:58] talking about the
[56:00] principle there is a
[56:03] principle of the secret
[56:06] location the
[56:08] principle of the sh
[56:11] Glory once you get into that
[56:14] place you are completely
[56:18] disconnected disconn with the rest of
[56:21] the
[56:22] world either you are hungry or
[56:26] not you have a job or
[56:28] not you have a wife or not you have
[56:32] money in the bank or
[56:34] not you are
[56:37] settled that's the Abiding
[56:41] Place and brother said in the Old
[56:45] Testament to get into that
[56:48] place meant
[56:51] death but in the New
[56:53] Testament
[56:55] since Jesus died on the
[56:57] cross the veil of the temple was
[57:01] right and said not to
[57:05] enter is death so that's why we are
[57:09] talking about the
[57:11] atmosphere of the sh glory and that's
[57:15] the
[57:16] atmosphere where you and I we need to be
[57:20] in order to be prepared for the
[57:23] rapture
[57:25] amen the main
[57:28] problem we have we have a lot of people
[57:31] in the out
[57:33] coat talking about the
[57:35] message discussing about the
[57:40] message if you enter that in a
[57:44] place you are a different
[57:47] person that's the principle if you enter
[57:51] that place you are different nothing
[57:55] will bother you criticis is not going to
[57:59] bother you they can point you the
[58:03] finger but it's like you are not
[58:06] existing you are dead to
[58:10] yourself and that's why the next series
[58:13] I will start with the principle of
[58:18] Resurrection because
[58:20] Resurrection it's a principle if you
[58:23] don't die
[58:25] you will not come into the
[58:28] resurrection there is a principle you
[58:31] have to abide by God principle in order
[58:34] for you to be in the morning of the
[58:38] Resurrection you have to die first and
[58:42] be buried otherwise you will never come
[58:46] into the
[58:47] resurrection and not coming into the
[58:51] resurrection you are where are you going
[58:53] to stand
[58:56] in this life things can happen we may
[59:01] sleep before the Rapture but it's not a
[59:05] problem but if you are in the secret
[59:09] location there is a
[59:13] principle you see that principle of
[59:16] Resurrection works
[59:18] everywhere with the
[59:20] sun in the morning it rises
[59:25] travel and
[59:28] said buried the next
[59:31] morning always in the East never West
[59:37] never
[59:38] North never South because it's the
[59:41] principle of
[59:43] God amen amen and when the sun
[59:47] set it's always in the
[59:50] west look at the travel of the Gospel
[59:56] it started with
[59:58] Ephesus going to
[1:00:00] Europe and where the sun
[1:00:04] set in the
[1:00:06] west America even in
[1:00:10] America
[1:00:12] Tabernacle was in the
[1:00:14] East but God said you have to go to the
[1:00:18] west and the sunet
[1:00:21] mountain amen it's not by
[1:00:25] it's the principle the principle of
[1:00:30] resurrection and you cannot get the
[1:00:32] principle of
[1:00:35] Resurrection if you don't go with the
[1:00:37] principle of
[1:00:40] humility humility is a
[1:00:43] principle if you want to go high see how
[1:00:47] low you can
[1:00:48] get it's a principle and that humility
[1:00:53] has to come from your
[1:00:55] heart not because I don't have a
[1:00:58] job I start blaming the people who have
[1:01:00] a
[1:01:01] job job is a
[1:01:04] Satan a car is a Satan blessing is sat
[1:01:09] it's good but when you get to the spot
[1:01:12] where your brother
[1:01:15] is maybe with the money he
[1:01:18] has then we will know who is really
[1:01:22] humble and the two mil
[1:01:26] is when you can Rec you can confess your
[1:01:32] faults not being
[1:01:35] caught but from the
[1:01:38] inside then you have a principle
[1:01:42] there amen am let's continue with
[1:01:45] brother paragra
[1:01:47] 19 so he said there is a hiding
[1:01:51] place Abiding Place
[1:01:56] we we can walk in the presence of
[1:02:00] God and be hid from the things of this
[1:02:04] world you you don't hear them no
[1:02:08] more it sound proof
[1:02:12] Hallelujah sound proof and said and a
[1:02:16] man that wants walk into
[1:02:20] God and the veil drops behind him
[1:02:25] shutting off the things of the
[1:02:27] world he is in the presence of
[1:02:30] God eating the man no wonder
[1:02:36] 12:00 9:00 or
[1:02:39] anything is living in the presence of
[1:02:42] the
[1:02:43] king amen no wonder every day is f for
[1:02:49] him not when you see a
[1:02:53] snow you start even cursing the
[1:02:58] Creator be happy with the
[1:03:02] snow be happy with the
[1:03:05] sunshine because the
[1:03:07] Creator think it's right at the
[1:03:11] appointed time and be us being his
[1:03:16] subject we have to glorify
[1:03:18] him therefore there is no reason to
[1:03:23] complain
[1:03:25] if it's too
[1:03:26] cold cover
[1:03:29] up that's it and praise the
[1:03:32] Lord amen amen that's why brother said
[1:03:37] no wonder every day is fine for
[1:03:40] him see look where he's
[1:03:44] at he has found the secret
[1:03:49] place Glory
[1:03:52] place it's a secret place
[1:03:55] it's the place where the real atmosphere
[1:03:59] is if you can have access to the
[1:04:03] glory the atmosphere is always
[1:04:08] right sign and wonders will be with
[1:04:14] you amen amen we can preach
[1:04:17] anything but the main purpose is to get
[1:04:21] people behind

[1:10:27] there when the high priest went in
[1:10:30] beyond that
[1:10:32] Veil that Veil that separated the
[1:10:35] holiest from the holiest of
[1:10:41] holies when he walk in
[1:10:44] there the veil dropped behind
[1:10:49] him it was even
[1:10:52] soundproof and man or a
[1:10:55] woman that ever walk in that sh glory of
[1:11:01] God the whole world shut off behind
[1:11:06] him all the bar all the music dance it's

[1:11:15] can tell by the taste the life of the
[1:11:20] people that this person has been or
[1:11:26] not you can
[1:11:31] tell when worldly music is a
[1:11:39] priority no matter what the devil
[1:11:43] says you don't pay any attention to
[1:11:47] it and he's living in a different
[1:11:52] atmosphere

[1:12:00] Road amen amen and it was
[1:12:04] nothing but a old Dead

[1:12:43] way that a Believer or a sinner is ever
[1:12:48] laid in the presence of almighty
[1:12:52] God under the influence of the Holy
[1:12:56] Ghost he becomes a new Creator right

[1:13:14] be a Son of God skipping a little bit
[1:13:19] but if you

[1:13:25] it will produce the same thing to
[1:13:28] you you will
[1:13:30] realize that you are born Sons and
[1:13:33] Daughters of
