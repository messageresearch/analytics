[35:30] as we just read in the bible
[35:33] if we can open uh take genesis genesis
[35:38] genesis chapter 38 in belly stuart
[35:41] a beautiful story about tamar over
[35:44] threes
[35:45] from the verse 13.
[35:50] about the story of tamara with judah
[35:54] to save time
[35:57] we're going to read from verse 13.
[36:24] foreign
[37:21] saying behold that father-in-law goes up
[37:24] to timnah to share his
[37:26] ship
[37:27] and she pulled she put a widow's garment
[37:30] off
[37:31] from her and covered
[37:33] covered her with a veil
[37:35] and wrapped herself and said in an open
[37:38] place which is by the way of timna for
[37:41] she saw that sheila was grown and she
[37:43] was not given unto him to wife
[37:46] when judah saw her he told it that he
[37:49] told her to be a harlot because she had
[37:52] covered her face
[37:54] and it turned on to her by the way and
[37:57] said go to a predi
[37:59] let me come come in unto thee for he
[38:02] knew not that she was his
[38:04] daughter-in-law
[38:05] for she said what would that give me
[38:08] that that means come mean unto me
[38:11] and he said i will send the kid from the
[38:13] flock and she said will that give me a
[38:16] pledge till that send it and he said
[38:19] what place should i give d and she said
[38:22] thy senate
[38:23] that brussley and that stuff and
[38:26] that is in that hands and he gave it to
[38:28] her and kim came in onto her and she
[38:31] conceived by him
[38:33] so whenever we see i remember here
[38:36] do you have a promise
[38:38] judah promised and uh everything else
[38:42] and but she asked something else from
[38:46] and later on
[38:47] by tsunami judah sent his friend
[38:52] his friend got there
[38:55] he didn't find the harlot
[38:56] of their seventh one and in verse
[39:38] he was thinking when he was go he's
[39:40] going to send
[39:47] but look at the wisdom of this woman he
[39:49] can't elaborate on me but when he sent
[39:52] his friend avec
[39:53] with the kid tsunami
[40:24] he knew that as that woman is holding
[40:26] women
[40:28] once she just showed that thing to
[40:30] everybody
[40:32] everybody will accuse him
[40:35] he's being accused
