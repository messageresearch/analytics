[4:56] something from you we ask it in Jesus
[4:58] Christ's name Amen
[5:01] alrighty so before we jump into our
[5:06] lessons to pray I just want to take a
[5:08] few seconds for you guys to sit back and
[5:10] kind of try to remember what we talked
[5:12] about last week know it's been just a
[5:16] week but um just try to remember and
[5:19] talked about so we did talked about we
[5:24] talked about time and how to manage our
[5:27] time and he talked about how the Chi and
[5:29] how to number I dates all the life that
[5:31] we live in and the number of data we
[5:36] have on earth you have to spend it by
[5:38] serving God and giving my best to God if
[5:40] you can remember that so our Leslie
[5:43] today is gonna go not really about also
[5:46] time but we're just gonna tell a little
[5:48] story if you want to follow along with
[5:52] me it's in the Book of Luke Luke chapter
[5:54] 16 and we're gonna start from verse from
[6:02] verse 19 so Luke chapter 16 verse 19 so
[6:08] make sure you have your Bible it's
[6:09] always a good thing to have your Bible
[6:11] with you for every Christians have your
[6:12] own Bible I know if you're old enough to
[6:15] read or you can't read yet and we can
[6:16] have a Bible alone someone can helping
[6:19] you learn how to read but it's always
[6:21] good for Christians have their home
[6:22] Bible
[6:23] so anyway we're gonna start with Luke
[6:25] chapter Luke chapter 16 verse 19 and
[6:29] it's talking about a rich man and here
[6:33] they call him the yeah the rich there
[6:36] was a certain young rich man and the
[6:39] Bible said that this man was always well
[6:41] dressed and he was cold and fine linen
[6:43] purple so he's the way the color purple
[6:45] the color purple and the days of the
[6:47] Bible meant you know you are someone of
[6:49] great wealth or royalty or something
[6:51] like that so this man was a rich man and
[6:54] he lived in a wonderful place you know
[6:57] the great life he had whatever he wanted
[6:59] all the riches and all the great things
[7:01] of this world and right outside of his
[7:04] gate there was a beggar who was sitting
[7:06] there and this beggar name was Lazarus
[7:08] Lazarus and Lazarus was a beggar who sat
[7:13] right just that he came and Lazarus has
[7:16] soared all over his body stories are
[7:18] like little like little what can I say
[7:22] little aches all over his body that used
[7:25] to hurt him and he was taught to scratch
[7:26] himself and they were doing and what he
[7:29] was just he was just in really painful
[7:31] conditions and the Bible said that dogs
[7:33] used to come I and when they were lives
[7:36] were sitting at the gate they would come
[7:38] and start licking his soil
[7:39] Oh imagine you know being steak or a
[7:42] baker and sitting there and dog coming
[7:44] it's looking and licking your sword
[7:46] so the Eliezer is the Baker he didn't
[7:49] have you know good clothes or money and
[7:52] food to eat so he would just say at that
[7:55] key and movie wonder when he saw the
[7:57] rich man passed by he'd be like please
[7:59] can you please give me something to eat
[8:01] even a little bit of even a little bit
[8:04] of bread or a little bit of crumbs the
[8:06] Bible's have used to wait even for the
[8:08] crumbs coming from there from the rich
[8:10] man's table and he would be happy for
[8:12] just to get even those crumbs so as time
[8:16] went by the rich man died and raz
[8:20] Blasio's also died so what happened to
[8:23] the Baker the Bible says in verse 22 and
[8:27] it came to pass that the beggar died the
[8:29] beggar died and was carried by the
[8:32] Angels into Abraham's bosom
[8:35] man also died and was buried and was
[8:37] buried so we see that the beggar Lazarus
[8:41] he died and who if he went to heaven
[8:42] right he wants to go Rex and Abraham's
[8:45] problem in heaven but the rich man she
[8:51] did not go to heaven let's see the Bible
[8:53] says in verse 23 and in how she lifted
[8:56] up his eyes being in torments and see if
[9:00] Abraham afar enlarges and his bosom so
[9:04] we see the Bible says here that the rich
[9:07] man went to hell and hell is a horrible
[9:11] place he was tormented and tormented
[9:14] means like he's disturbed he was an
[9:16] agony he's in pain he was not in P so he
[9:21] looked up to heaven and he sees a
[9:22] far-off he sees Abraham and Lazarus in
[9:25] his bosom and the rich man because he
[9:27] did so much to him and so much pain the
[9:30] place where he was so horrible he said
[9:33] Abraham Lazarus to you at least this
[9:35] pick the tip of your finger just the
[9:38] very tip of your thing will dip it in
[9:39] water just barely tap it in water and
[9:41] put it on my tongue because I'm so
[9:43] thirsty and I'm so tormented and I just
[9:46] want and it's so hot here and I just
[9:50] want just a little drop of water just to
[9:52] know moisturize my tongue a little bit
[9:54] and Abraham said well remember when you
[10:00] are on earth when you're on earth and
[10:02] you were living you had all these great
[10:04] things yeah but that you drink the best
[10:06] drink
[10:06] you ate the best food you were the banks
[10:09] closed you live a luxury you live the
[10:11] luxurious life and Lazarus who's here in
[10:14] heaven to live to pay a painful life in
[10:16] his tormented all the time but now it's
[10:20] the opposite right now you're the one
[10:22] who's tormented and we're in peace and
[10:26] he said yes I understand but I just want
[10:27] a little bit of water just not even a
[10:29] cup of wild not even a slipper whatever
[10:31] just your finger just to put this to
[10:34] moisturize my lips and Abraham said well
[10:36] where you are and where I am there's a
[10:39] big gap there's a big distance a big
[10:41] space between us and I can get to where
[10:43] you are and you can't come to where we
[10:45] are and he was in so much pain and
[10:49] tormented in agony and he said Abraham
[10:51] can you at least give her a chance I
[10:53] have five brothers why so on earth and
[10:55] neither of them know the Word of God
[10:58] neither of them have the word to know
[10:59] have the Word of God it's a way for me
[11:02] to go back on earth or defend someone to
[11:05] go talk to them and to you know cuz I
[11:07] don't I don't want them to come to how I
[11:09] don't want them to come to this horrible
[11:10] place
[11:11] and Abraham told and he's like well your
[11:14] brothers on earth they have Moses and
[11:16] the prophets so they have the Word of
[11:17] God if you want to believe they should
[11:19] open up the Bible and they should open
[11:21] up the scriptures and read it for
[11:23] themselves and let's see they have Moses
[11:29] and the prophets and verse 30 says and
[11:33] he said nay father Abraham but if one
[11:35] went unto them from the dead they will
[11:37] repent and he said unto them if they
[11:40] hear not Moses and the prophets neither
[11:43] will they be persuaded though rose from
[11:46] the dead so he tells him that the only
[11:49] way in to read mugs in the pub if they
[11:51] don't believe in order from the pub and
[11:53] the pocket then they won't even believe
[11:55] the dead man they won't believe a dead
[11:57] man who came back to come back on Isaac
[12:00] tell them so what are you just showing
[12:01] that simulation the storytelling that's
[12:04] in relationship to what we talked about
[12:05] maybe last week it's just saying that
[12:08] you know we can live our life you know
[12:11] on earth you can have all the the riches
[12:13] and all the benefits you can live our
[12:15] best life you can have all the best you
[12:17] know the best clothes we can have the
[12:19] best of friends you can have the best
[12:21] car we can wear the best shoes but the
[12:25] end of the day is that really what's
[12:26] important to us
[12:27] no the Bible says that it is what will
[12:31] the proper me if I gain the whole world
[12:32] but lose my soul the soul is the most
[12:35] important thing to us and we have to
[12:38] feed our souls our heart our spiritual
[12:40] thoughts more than we feed our flesh in
[12:42] this physical life so by spending our
[12:45] time in prayer by spending our time
[12:47] reading the Bible on our own we're
[12:49] feeding our soul and we're treasuring
[12:50] what God has given to us is it the most
[12:52] important thing it's not going to
[12:55] benefit us much if we say ok on earth
[12:57] I'm just gonna be happy I'm gonna party
[12:59] all the time I'm gonna go to ball games
[13:00] I'm gonna make the best
[13:02] then at the end of the day God is gonna
[13:05] say well I don't know you know you can't
[13:08] enter into heaven because you universe
[13:11] spent time for me you never gave me here
[13:13] never came to church maybe or when even
[13:15] when he did come to church you didn't
[13:16] give me your best you know so we have to
[13:19] make sure that we're spending our time
[13:20] my time on this right that God has given
[13:22] to us like we said last week we don't
[13:25] know how long you think that we have on
[13:26] earth but make sure that every second we
[13:28] have every moment that we have we are
[13:31] thinking about what God wants us to do
[13:33] God all constantly in our heart we can
[13:36] be asking God God is by the way I'm
[13:37] living proven to you is what I'm doing
[13:40] cleaning - you are my thoughts pleasing
[13:42] to you are my actions please enjoy my
[13:45] word the word that come out of my mouth
[13:46] are they pretty to you because we want
[13:49] constantly to walk and to please God
[13:51] right even if it means that on earth you
[13:54] can be torment that we can be made for
[13:55] us maybe we can be mocked
[13:57] maybe we won't be beggars like Lazarus
[13:59] but maybe our friends won't like us
[14:01] because we activate our friends won't
[14:03] want to hang out with us because we
[14:05] can't do certain things yeah we can
[14:07] separate in be like I wish to be I had
[14:09] good friends who can like me it was
[14:11] faith and I wish that I wish I didn't
[14:13] have to make be made fun of because of
[14:14] the way I dress or I wish I didn't have
[14:17] to be made fun of because of going to
[14:19] church but that's gonna be worth it one
[14:21] day one day we have a promise that God
[14:23] has created heaven he has created a
[14:26] mansion for us and one day we're gonna
[14:28] forget all the problems of this world
[14:30] and we're just gonna be in heaven
[14:32] rejoicing with the saints excuse me
[14:35] the Joyce thing was thanks being in
[14:37] God's presence having the peace and the
[14:40] joy that we can never have on this world
[14:43] so that's just to tell you that today
[14:46] let's just try your best to push towards
[14:48] that having the calling to live our best
[14:50] deliver I bet to try her back to live
[14:52] for God and to reach that reward we also
[14:55] have another story a short story in the
[14:57] book of David's in the book of Matthew
[15:00] yes it's also talking about another rich
[15:05] man another rich man who came in Saudi
[15:09] and came to Jesus one day either what
[15:12] can I do
[15:12] it was just let me tried to find it here
[15:16] all together so we're reading the book
[15:18] of mark sorry I'm sorry it's in the book
[15:21] of Mark chapter 17 so in the book of
[15:30] Mark chapter 10 verse 17 it says hmm and
[15:35] when he was gone forth in the way there
[15:38] came one running and kneeled to him and
[15:39] asked him good master what shall I do
[15:42] that I may inherit eternal life and so
[15:46] there was a man another rich young ruler
[15:47] he came to G listen if there Jesus what
[15:49] can I do to have eternal life what can I
[15:51] do to the however lasting life and Jesus
[15:54] told him well take all your goods and
[15:56] all your belongings and all the things
[15:59] that you possess and sell it to the poor
[16:01] and the actually before I gets that part
[16:06] he said he said Jesus said well he said
[16:10] well Jesus I been since I was a little
[16:13] boy I know the Ten Commandments a 10th
[16:15] commandment says thou shalt not kill
[16:16] thou shalt not steal thou shalt not
[16:19] commit adultery thou shall not covet and
[16:21] he said I've done this I know all these
[16:23] things and I've lived this and Jesus
[16:25] said well you have to take all your good
[16:27] in all your position to sell it to the
[16:29] poor and he said well he probably deep
[16:32] down inside he was like I don't know if
[16:34] I can do that that's too much Jesus is
[16:36] asking you for too much but that was his
[16:39] way to have eternal life by giving up
[16:40] all his possessions all he's good
[16:42] but he refused to do that and you look
[16:45] that it was hard for a rich man to enter
[16:48] into heaven it's easier for a camel it's
[16:52] like right they great camel games with
[16:54] little needles I a little needle you
[16:57] know those little meals I can cook you
[16:58] it's easier for a big camel to get into
[17:00] that than for a rich man to get into
[17:02] heaven so what is the mean by Richmond
[17:04] today let's apply it to ourselves by
[17:06] original when Jesus called us to give us
[17:08] to give up all our belongings to follow
[17:10] him maybe to give up all the stuff that
[17:12] we like doing that or not
[17:13] maybe godly to give up maybe all the
[17:16] games that we spent hours and hours
[17:17] playing or the movie that we can spend
[17:20] hours and hours watch and you have to
[17:22] give that up to God give that up and
[17:24] take our and and follow Jesus it's hard
[17:28] to follow you know to say ok I'm gonna
[17:30] when I spend all my time doing this
[17:32] listen to and then I'll give a little
[17:33] time to you know God wants to give up
[17:35] everything everything completely and to
[17:38] follow him so just a little reminder so
[17:42] from last week we talked a lot of time
[17:44] how are we spending that time let's
[17:46] spend the time try to do our best to
[17:49] spend our time in God's presence all
[17:51] right thank you very much and we're
[17:53] gonna go to Shalom if you had anything
[17:54] bad for us
[17:56] Thank You Sharon yeah just just a
[18:00] comment of what she said that it is so
[18:03] important like the Bible says to set
[18:05] your affections on the things above
[18:06] rather than the things on earth because
[18:09] all the things on earth even the riches
[18:11] that this young man had when he died and
[18:14] he went to how he couldn't take it with
[18:16] him you know you could have all your
[18:18] favorite items toys whatever gadgets and
[18:23] you you treasure it so much but at the
[18:26] end of the day when you go to heaven you
[18:28] won't take it with you when you die you
[18:30] won't take it with you we came into the
[18:32] earth with nothing and when we leave the
[18:34] earth we will go with nothing and if we
[18:36] set our hearts and our desires and
[18:39] whatever we want to do towards the
[18:40] things of God those things will never
[18:42] never never perish let's say for example
[18:45] you brought someone closer to the Lord
[18:47] that one will never perish why because
[18:49] you can see that person that happened
[18:51] one day right compared to maybe you
[18:55] achieve some big goal here down on earth
[18:57] even though those are not wrong and
[18:59] we're supposed to do them when you get
[19:01] to the other side they won't mean
[19:03] nothing to you right because even in the
[19:05] Bible when Abraham if you go back to
[19:08] where Abraham was telling that rich
[19:11] young ruler who was crying out to him
[19:13] like please father Abraham give me even
[19:15] a little bit of water and he says
[19:17] remember in your lifetime when you were
[19:19] down there you enjoyed all the good
[19:22] times you were you were enjoying your
[19:24] money and all the riches that you had a
[19:26] Lazarus you were suffering he wasn't
[19:29] going through a good time it wasn't a
[19:31] happy thing but now he's at rest now
[19:33] he's at peace now look at you right
[19:35] where did all his riches and all the
[19:37] time that he had and all the
[19:39] youthfulness where did it go it was all
[19:41] spent on basically nothing
[19:43] and how Jesus told him hey so all you
[19:46] have give it to the poor and come follow
[19:48] me cuz that was his problem right
[19:50] because he had too many riches and he
[19:52] couldn't follow Jesus and he turned away
[19:54] he couldn't follow you he couldn't
[19:56] follow Jesus so that's what Jesus is
[19:57] asking for us today is to leave all
[19:59] those things behind not physically you
[20:02] know like you know depriving yourself
[20:03] from certain things no but setting your
[20:05] heart and your desires towards the
[20:07] things of God which will never never
[20:09] perish in your your own soul because
[20:11] that's what your gonna take to heaven
[20:13] this body it's gonna go into the ground
[20:16] or if we go in the rapture we'll have a
[20:17] different body right so we want to take
[20:20] care of what we have on the inside
[20:21] sometimes we focus too much on the
[20:23] outside what we eat we dress how we
[20:25] sleep or what we do how much fun that we
[20:28] have right but we never really pay so
[20:30] much attention to the soul on the inside
[20:32] you know it's just like a little blood
[20:34] if you water it or a little a little
[20:37] child if you give them food and drink
[20:39] and let them sleep but they will grow
[20:40] right the same thing with your soul on
[20:42] the inside so focus what's on the inside
[20:44] more than on the outside you know
[20:46] there's the you know the full armor of
[20:50] God that you have to have like in order
[20:53] to fight the devil basically remember
[20:54] the stature of the perfect man and all
[20:56] the fruits of the spirits that we always
[20:58] talk about love joy peace patience you
[21:01] know making sure that you have all those
[21:03] together in your heart engage making
[21:05] sure that you are filled with the holy
[21:07] spirit and that you're not just walking
[21:08] around and then when the rapture would
[21:11] happen or when the time for you to go
[21:12] you are not ready right because we want
[21:14] to make sure that our we are ready on
[21:17] the inside it's just like the story of
[21:18] the foolish version and and the wise
[21:20] version right the wise virgins they had
[21:23] their lamps and their oil was ready for
[21:25] to meet the bridegroom but what happened
[21:27] to the foolish virgins the foolish
[21:29] virgins they went to sleep right and
[21:30] then when they heard that the bridegroom
[21:32] was coming they started to wake up and
[21:34] be like oh can we have a little bit of
[21:35] your oil for our lamps because we were
[21:38] not ready sorry we were sleeping like
[21:39] heat please can we borrow but it was too
[21:42] late for them right the rice version
[21:43] says go o for your own oil we got our
[21:46] own oil we were already
[21:47] we were waiting you guys went and went
[21:49] to sleep you know if I oh I'll do it
[21:51] later right we don't want to be like
[21:53] that we want to be ready whenever the
[21:55] time will come back on
[21:57] to use us or whenever he wants to take
[21:59] us home so that's basically it
[22:01] and I hope you guys enjoyed and got
[22:03] something out of this Sunday School
[22:05] lesson that will help you one day in the
