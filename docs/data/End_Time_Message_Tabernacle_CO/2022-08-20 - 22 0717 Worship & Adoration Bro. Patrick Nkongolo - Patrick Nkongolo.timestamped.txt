[35:56] lord understanding the steps
[36:00] to take the decision
[36:02] a decision to come and labor in the
[36:04] field further we need have a donation
[36:06] lord as it was with nehemiah can you
[36:09] come sit down
[36:10] he came into the field he lived in the
[36:12] ocean and he labored in the world
[36:14] foreign
[36:16] the tool in one hand
[36:18] the
[36:20] man and the sword on the other side
[36:38] with a stick in his hand avec le baton
[36:41] de samara to go to take over father
[36:43] ponderos
[36:46] lord jesus christ
[36:48] ruth coming to work lord with venom
[36:52] lord as
[37:06] when lord of moses had labored
[37:10] he went back low father god gathered
[37:11] with his parents with his fathers
[37:30] and here we are no
[37:32] no no father got some historical events
[37:36] historic but our lives load menu
[37:40] our decisions no decision
[37:43] has proven further
[37:46] that we are ruthless
[37:48] we are the one
[37:50] seller that you have to we you have
[37:52] chosen us
[37:55] before the foundation of the week
[37:58] as jesus could say to us
[38:00] that i had joy with you before the
[38:03] foundation of the world
[38:05] foundation
[38:06] lord jesus

[38:18] lord as we are leaving it
[38:20] [Music]
[38:21] we don't want to put emotions into these
[38:23] things

[38:30] objective we want to embrace the cross
[38:33] father
[38:35] we want to look for that carry it with
[38:37] joyfun

[39:40] [Music]
[40:00] ruth didn't take the decision to follow
[40:03] naomi to be popular
[40:07] to become a new partaker of a new family
[40:14] because we who have to become heir of
[40:16] the salvation
