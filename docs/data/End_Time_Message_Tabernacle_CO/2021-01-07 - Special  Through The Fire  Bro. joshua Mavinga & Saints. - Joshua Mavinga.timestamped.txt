[0:16] [Music]
[0:23] so
[0:24] many times i've questioned
[0:28] certain
[0:30] [Music]
[0:41] many times
[0:46] weakness blurs my vision
[0:49] and my frustrations get so
[0:53] out of hand
[0:58] but it's then i am reminded
[1:03] i've never been forsaken
[1:06] and i've never had to stand
[1:13] alone that's when i look at all the
[1:18] victories

[1:51] oh he never offered
[1:56] our victories

[2:23] [Music]
[2:34] just
[2:36] you through the fire again
[2:41] [Music]
[2:44] i know within myself
[2:50] perish but if i
[2:53] trust the mighty hand of god
[2:56] he'll shield the flames again
[3:02] again
[3:04] [Music]
[3:08] he never promised
[3:11] that the cross would not get heavy
[3:15] and the year would
[3:21] [Music]
[3:29] without fighting but he said hell
[3:33] would always
[3:41] just remember when you're standing
[3:47] [Music]
[3:54] says
[3:57] just hold
[4:01] [Music]
[4:12] again
[4:14] [Music]
[4:26] oh
[4:28] [Music]
[4:33] [Applause]
[4:36] again
