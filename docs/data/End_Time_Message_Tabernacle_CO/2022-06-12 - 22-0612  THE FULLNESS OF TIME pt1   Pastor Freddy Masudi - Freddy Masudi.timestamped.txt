[19:11] make it to our country
[19:16] and
[19:17] we went out there to the church
[19:34] and we went to the mountain i preached
[19:36] the daughter out there
[19:50] i've preached a lot on the mountain
[19:52] sunset where they come where the cloud
[19:53] has come down
[19:55] hello uh
[20:02] it was a privilege for me to see the
[20:04] actual mountain sunset on a tela we were
[20:07] there and the sun was here
[20:09] canyon and we went to sabino canyon
[20:12] if we on our
[20:14] viewers amazon like the prophet and we
[20:17] visited the perfect soho home
[20:29] i went to los angeles to see the road

[20:49] mrs a simple function a word that you
[20:52] they spoke a lot about
[20:55] voila
[21:00] and therefore we hear it's already a joy
[21:05] [Music]
[21:08] therefore this morning pastor foster has
[21:10] given me his pulpit uh
[21:22] we were very very blessed by his
[21:24] welcoming
[21:33] [Music]
[21:39] and we felt really at home nothing is
[21:41] lacking
[21:42] um
[22:07] and probably i'll try to exalt it a
[22:10] little bit
[22:21] i tried everything when i was thinking
[22:24] of pastor foster's church
[22:27] [Music]
[22:30] but i saw that god was straining me from
[22:32] all of those
[22:46] that's why i thought that probably you
[22:49] so it might look like a teaching but
[22:51] actually it's an exhortation
[23:01] i think that the sound is good enough
[23:11] [Music]
[23:16] of the sound system back home we used to
[23:18] be shouting all the time
[23:28] uh we're speaking to a church but israel
[23:30] is we oh we're talking in the open air
[23:33] this is a circumstance
[23:37] but here it seems as if like i don't
[23:38] have to shout
[23:41] yes
[23:45] but also like i don't like to uh to
[23:48] preach like a priest from the catholic
[23:50] church who come and profess at the
[23:52] university also as if i was a professor
[23:55] from the university
[24:00] i don't like it could you make them
[24:02] pretty my god helped
[24:15] it is my job
[24:29] [Music]
[24:30] people
[24:40] i had time to see him right yes
[24:43] uh
[24:48] [Music]
[25:12] a
[25:14] [Music]
[25:25] pastor dick
[25:26] in france he was consecrating a wedding
[25:29] or blessing a wedding
[25:34] in that wedding
[25:35] he was talking about the insert uh
[25:38] uncertainty of uh
[26:12] civilization brings along many many
[26:15] other issues like in social life
[26:20] [Music]
[26:22] a
[26:50] we're not here just as if people who are
[26:52] hopeless or helpless
[26:58] the problem the difficulty
[27:00] despite of what may happen issues and
[27:03] hardships
[27:10] but we know that we have god
[27:12] problems

[27:27] the solution there's no one problem that
[27:29] does not have a solution
[27:31] question
[27:50] [Applause]
[28:14] better among the public probably the
[28:17] lack of papers
[28:27] lack of papers
[28:41] to get a new nationality or citizenship
[28:44] in the bible
[28:49] paul had a roman citizenship for him to
[28:52] preach the gospel hello
[28:55] come with hitler
[28:59] [Music]
[29:06] [Music]
[29:20] it may seem like as if i'm just spinning
[29:22] around wasting time but i know that
[29:24] people have issues
[29:26] i'm attending today
[29:38] i have a bunch of requests that my
[29:40] people have requested brought me along
[29:42] with it to sunset sabine canyon and

[29:50] to do the problem therefore a people is
[29:52] always a needy people the company part

[30:08] there will always be a problem no
[30:09] someday we human beings
[30:12] know some of this
[30:14] human beings
[30:18] therefore we have issues as men and
[30:22] therefore if it's not money
[30:25] and probably it's another thing
[30:29] probably if it's not work it's probably
[30:31] marriage another one the problem we have
[30:33] problem my impulsively problem foolish
[30:36] energy but for all those issues we have
[30:39] to bring them to god

[41:59] to be compared with the glory we shall
[42:02] be revealed in us
[42:12] for the creature was made subject to

[42:18] the earnest expectation of the creature
[42:20] waited for the manifestation of the sons
[42:23] of god
[42:33] for the creature was made subject to
[42:36] vanity not willingly but by the
[42:39] by reason of him who have subjected the
[42:41] same in hope

[45:46] bring us back
[45:55] therefore the plan of redemption was put
[45:58] in place because god has to bring us
[46:00] back because we were his children
[46:12] right
[46:14] therefore when the devil in his angel uh
[46:16] two third actually when they fell
[46:20] yes
[46:26] when he felt the
[46:29] [Music]
[46:43] because with the devil he didn't know he
[46:45] he there's nothing to give win back me
[46:49] but man is a son of god wait lord
[46:52] maurice satan unfounded he is a child of
[47:23] fontaine the great fountain
[47:25] amen amen a less salty the the granted
[47:30] spring and therefore he came out of the
[47:32] great spirit
[47:35] logos and if god took a body called
[47:38] logos
[47:41] and when you look at god in that form
[47:44] he looks like a man
[47:47] he has hands like a man
[47:50] he
[48:29] he was not god yet he was just a great
[48:31] spirit
[48:48] depending on how his creation will have
[48:50] to move forward
[48:54] therefore the first day you say they let
[48:56] light be they have the truth
[48:58] let's say he said on the second day
[49:14] but
[49:20] i know that god is very serious but
[49:21] there at that time he became more
[49:23] serious
[49:26] therefore he said let's make amends
[49:57] and child is really his choice of
[50:02] a child of god is god himself
[50:05] he has the potential that god hates
[50:09] he has the potential that god has
[50:12] amen
[50:15] he has the power that god has
[50:17] come visiting her therefore when you
[50:19] say you don't have to look down at
[50:22] yourself
[50:23] you are sons of god
[50:25] amen
[50:27] you are sons of god amen amen
[50:30] [Applause]
[50:32] fundamental foreign fundamental from
[50:34] foundation for faith
[50:38] i don't know if those are projects
[50:41] i believe paragraph 12 who ventures
[50:47] in front of you that the man is the son
[50:50] of god important
[50:52] regardless
[51:50] regardless of no matter what statement
[51:53] is in
[51:56] front of you he is still a son of god
[52:00] be important
[52:02] regardless if he is sinful
[52:08] regardless of how far he has fallen
[52:13] back house of his fallen son men
[52:16] separated
[52:44] wonderful
[52:47] therefore adam was a son of god
[52:51] therefore when he failed
[52:53] god has left heaven
[53:11] it's at that time that he probably gave
[53:13] the promise of a messiah amen amen
[53:18] continue
[53:19] therefore the plan of redemption carried
[53:21] on may take command but adam was how
[53:25] adam have a total priesthood
[53:38] [Applause]
[53:40] you know from the beginning god didn't
[53:41] name the animals
[53:48] he gave that responsibility
[53:51] exactly
[53:52] can we give a japanese
[54:08] when a tree was moving
[54:12] and you would say like you know stop
[54:13] there
[54:14] and the tree would stop
[54:16] [Applause]
[54:19] when the wind was shaking dished usage
[54:22] then
[54:49] but the man was not falling
[54:52] the man was not growing you didn't know
[54:54] that
[54:55] today we have gray hair we have one of
[54:57] the brothers
[54:58] before then we didn't have any brains
[55:00] what's the second pressure is that this
[55:02] is the cause of sin on the view of yeah
[55:04] we
[55:17] but god didn't leave men alone
[55:22] he had made a promise the face is the
[55:24] lafayette they which are the son of the
[55:26] woman
[55:28] will come and bruise the head of the
[55:30] serpent ah man amen
[55:38] was laid out for six thousand years six
[55:40] million data there's six seven six
[55:42] thousand years economy
[55:45] now and when the plane was moving
[55:46] forward about two thousand years ago
[55:49] and the thing that filled this job
[55:52] and the devil is corrupted
[55:54] you follow i know they are victory and
[55:57] they forgot that they destroyed
[55:58] everything uh truly pressure they got
[56:00] destroyed taken away
[56:02] it says only remain only nowhere in his
[56:05] children
[56:08] here comes him
[56:10] and afterwards
[56:13] and the world carried
[56:14] on cut camilla a prayer four thousand
[56:18] years afterwards
[56:20] and the lord had come along
[56:27] it's on him that the plan of redemption
[56:29] was based upon
[56:31] a fair expediency then he was coming to
[56:34] do the atonement that totally didn't
[56:36] experience the fullness of the atonement
[56:40] that's how he was born from a virgin
[56:42] amen amen
[56:47] he was bringing back the men to where he
[56:49] was before
[56:53] he came so that the man can become back
[56:56] what he was don't
[57:10] did you take the hardship of a man jesus
[57:14] nope did you just say that this is not a
[57:15] man no he led jesus he said jesus is god

[58:16] only dealt with the jews
[58:18] er enough patriot african cell on the
[58:21] nation he didn't deal with no man from
[58:23] the gentiles mechanism
[58:25] but jesus went jesus christ
[58:28] and the jew rejected him
[58:34] and god also started calling us gentiles
[58:36] now
[58:38] come and say
[58:40] from this church that started there in
[58:42] pentecost you know
[58:44] or from the upper room japanese
[59:03] god has to call a gentile through this
[59:05] dispensation of grace
[59:14] that when jesus said that the holy
[59:16] spirit will come and will fulfill his
[59:18] promise amen amen
[59:22] easier to call his church okay
[59:27] it's a through this holy spirit that god
[59:29] wills couldn't prefer
[59:37] you can only do it through the holy
[59:39] spirit
[59:41] without the holy spirit
[59:43] successful all that you'll do is wrong

[1:20:58] essence
[1:21:07] what are things that are in heaven say
[1:21:09] chris the women it's christ himself
[1:21:12] david
[1:21:22] all things are the angels that were in
[1:21:24] heaven christians
[1:21:26] christ has brought them down if we went
[1:21:28] to know and now
[1:21:35] the things that are in heaven
[1:21:37] it is the christ in heaven
[1:21:40] and everything that was in heaven
[1:21:44] but now the things that are on earth say
[1:21:45] william it's william brennan
[1:21:48] a new kid
[1:21:49] and us who are here
[1:21:51] jacques
[1:21:52] revelations

[1:22:38] the zones where they were angels they're
[1:22:40] certainly in this in that class
[1:22:45] and there that's where he was given the
[1:22:46] seven seals message
[1:22:49] i believe that you say amen today
[1:22:56] that's where time was swallowed in
[1:22:58] eternity
[1:23:01] and jesus coming with eternity
[1:23:29] i want you to understand the things very
[1:23:31] clearly
[1:23:47] william branagh william branham avec
[1:23:49] with us
[1:23:51] eternity
[1:23:53] the lord jesus christ alexis angela with
[1:23:55] his angel
[1:23:57] with his pillow fire
[1:23:59] initially
[1:24:27] [Applause]
[1:24:28] don't
[1:24:44] we can probably do this
[1:24:47] but it is a time
[1:24:49] it's an additional time
[1:24:55] and a goddess abort this time from
[1:24:57] eternity
[1:25:00] that's why you can see a man stopping a
[1:25:02] bulls
[1:25:06] you can see a man stopping the the the
[1:25:09] stone don't say it
[1:25:13] it's a part of eternity that is borrowed
[1:25:17] amen can you say amen to them
[1:25:23] there's an eternal thing in us
[1:25:26] what i'm saying
[1:25:29] in the stage of a perfect man
[1:25:32] he says that
[1:25:33] john cena
[1:25:34] started
[1:25:35] what i'm teaching in the stage of a
[1:25:37] perfect man says
[1:25:52] [Music]
[1:26:04] a church in which god is living jesus is
[1:26:07] living in amen amen the same woman and
[1:26:09] come and say i live let me start reading
[1:26:12] now escape
[1:26:14] you say amen to that no
[1:26:16] no no
[1:26:18] in my teaching this is
[1:26:20] i am
[1:26:25] we are living in the fullness of time
[1:26:28] now let them tell me time is no more
[1:26:30] amen amen
[1:26:34] in a borrowed time message
[1:26:36] the greece can you solve but this type
[1:26:38] of church that we are say deep the
[1:26:40] gliese cannot serve this type of church
[1:26:42] that we are say take this allah this
[1:26:45] church says coming impossible it's not
[1:26:48] like any other church super complex
[1:26:52] it's not like the pentecostal church
[1:26:58] we cannot die
[1:26:59] no no

[1:27:02] feed we cannot feed huh
[1:27:05] let's put this jesus christ we cannot
[1:27:07] feed the bread of jesus christ every
[1:27:09] clip decoratives and we forever with the
[1:27:12] pentacles
[1:27:13] sir because with this message separately
[1:27:45] tradition
[1:27:47] to lead it are you an authentic
[1:27:50] expiation to air of the true genuine
[1:27:54] atonement
[1:27:56] amen amen are you authentic expiation to
[1:28:00] a genuine uh uh atonement mechanism
[1:28:05] but what is that atonement
[1:28:08] christ is the crisis
[1:28:10] person
[1:28:12] are
[1:28:39] [Music]
[1:29:07] it's the truth
[1:29:08] no no
[1:29:12] boy
[1:29:13] pascal the holy spirit you know from
[1:29:16] senior center sweden
[1:29:18] teaches the holy spirit he says okay the
[1:29:20] only paragraphs
[1:29:22] 50
[1:29:35] is a proportion to the word
[1:29:51] the shadow of the holy spirit is a weak
[1:29:56] failure
[1:29:58] small okay okay
[1:30:01] the
[1:30:02] westlake in uh westley's scientific
[1:30:26] [Music]
[1:30:42] and the shadow becomes a little bit
[1:30:44] greater may allah
[1:30:57] [Music]
[1:31:01] very small but not as much
[1:31:05] but when brother bottom comes
[1:31:09] it's the fullness of the world
[1:31:13] it's the third pool
[1:31:27] of christ coming
[1:31:29] our lord and therefore
[1:31:32] so with the things
[1:31:34] you say
[1:31:37] with the seals amen amen not resent the
[1:31:41] spirit our holy
