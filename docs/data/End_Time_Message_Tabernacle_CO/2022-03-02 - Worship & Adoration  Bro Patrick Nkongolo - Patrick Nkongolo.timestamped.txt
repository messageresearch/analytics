[0:00] have sunday's uh
[0:02] morning or sunday night and i'll take
[0:03] the other service and he'll have
[0:04] wednesday and i'll have tuesday or
[0:06] something like that or i said we'll go
[0:08] right ahead with the services and i said
[0:09] i'll get a new job and go to work
[0:11] i did
[0:12] i got my job brother woods back there
[0:14] moving houses so i just went to work got
[0:17] me a job
[0:18] it hurt my wife and billy they said
[0:21] billy said dad i'm sure you're doing
[0:22] wrong i said no i'm doing right i keep
[0:24] my promise
[0:25] i told him i said my promise no matter
[0:28] what it is if a man is not as good as
[0:30] his word i don't wanna you can't trust
[0:32] him because he's not no good
[0:34] you know and so um
[0:36] that's one thing and a person must
[0:38] always be that's honest
[0:40] be tell things so that that you can go
[0:43] back and tell it a million times it'll
[0:45] be the same thing you see just be honest
[0:47] no matter if it's bad or whether it's
[0:49] good be honest
[0:50] and if it's against you say it anyhow or
[0:53] keep still don't say it at all
[0:55] and um so then
[0:57] i i feel that way that god will bless an
[1:00] honest heart and knowing the position
[1:03] that i stand in to defeat sickness and
[1:06] stuff for people in prayer to the lord
[1:08] jesus according to his
[1:10] divine uh word and his uh
[1:14] and his calling then i must be honest
[1:17] and hard to do that because
[1:19] the devil knows whether you are or not
[1:22] he won't penalty i don't care how loud
[1:23] you holler how much you make up he won't
[1:25] pay attention to you
[1:27] right but god will if you're on
[1:31] so i said i'll tell them when to get the
[1:33] air zone i actually left california i
[1:35] didn't have the nerve so i had to
[1:37] i said well in new mexico and on and on
[1:40] to i told him something right down here
[1:42] and again
[1:43] well they they understood it pretty well
[1:45] billy didn't get it too well he said
[1:47] daddy i think you're making a mistake
[1:49] but i went home tired weary upset crying
[1:53] went to bed that night and after wife
[1:54] got to sleep i went in the room knelt
[1:57] down said dear jesus i don't know what
[1:59] i'm going to do
[2:00] here i am right back where i started
[2:02] from again
[2:03] i guess i made a failure
[2:06] about two hours the man he appeared to
[2:08] me
[2:10] and he showed me a vision of such a
[2:12] panoramic view of people i've never seen
[2:14] i was talking to my wife in division
[2:17] now you people that know me know i'm not
[2:19] a fanatic i don't say these things
[2:22] unless they're the truth that's right
[2:25] uh i've seen it and i've seen brother
[2:27] oregon by standing there and i went up
[2:28] to him he said brother billy said we'd
[2:31] give out all the prayer cards and
[2:32] everything's ready now for the meeting
[2:34] we got a way of taking in and out i said
[2:36] thank you brother orton wright i walked
[2:38] over to some more brethren and there's
[2:40] another brother preaching i said who's
[2:42] he
[2:43] they said they put him up and i said
[2:44] who's they and they just turned around
[2:46] walked away and the man they just
[2:49] dismissed the audience let them all go
[2:50] and i said oh he shouldn't do that
[2:52] because there is there's no altar call
[2:55] oh he said another fellow spoke up and
[2:57] said we don't tuck up the offering
[2:59] i said when is the offering more
[3:01] important than souls before christ and
[3:04] at that the angel lord taking me out
[3:07] then
[3:08] and he take me to a real bright stream
[3:10] of water the most beautiful blue water
[3:13] and great fish was swimming around then
[3:16] he said i will make you a fisher and he
[3:19] said now cast your lure into the water
[3:21] when you pull it slow
[3:23] first time next time just give it a
[3:25] little jerk up too hard and the next
[3:27] time that you're hooked for the catch
[3:30] and i started promote lying in the water
[3:32] i pulled everybody into rejoicing and
[3:34] that's wonderful that's wonderful i got
[3:37] all excited and jerked it hard on the
[3:39] next move out i pulled a fish and all
[3:42] out of the water and what it was is a
[3:44] little bitty fish in it just about size
[3:46] the lure
[3:47] and i got my line all tangled up and i
[3:50] straightened out the line and the man
[3:51] which was talking behind me walked
[3:53] around in front of me
[3:54] dressing palestinian clothes a turban on
[3:57] his head in a white robe
[4:00] you said brother brandon
[4:02] that's it
[4:04] i said i know i didn't do right i said i
[4:07] jerked it when i ought to he said don't
[4:09] get your lines tangled up in these kind
[4:11] of times
[4:12] and i said well i'm running as straight
[4:14] as i can i'll be very careful and he
[4:16] said now the first time
[4:19] i spoke with you you put your hands on
[4:22] the people and told them what was wrong
[4:24] with them
[4:25] and the second pull
[4:27] while when you did you would know the
[4:29] secrets of your heart and i made you
[4:31] sear before the people but she was
[4:34] always trying to explain it
[4:36] you ought to have done that said you've
[4:38] made a public show out of it
[4:41] i said i'm very sorry and he's taking me
[4:43] from there
[4:45] and i've seen a great
[4:47] huge tent
[4:48] i've never seen such a attempt it was
[4:51] packed in line everywhere with people
[4:54] and i walked out to the look like i was
[4:56] standing above the people looking down
[4:58] where just made an altar call and
[5:00] hundreds and hundreds of people were
[5:02] weeping and rejoicing after they had
[5:04] accepted the lord jesus as their failure
[5:08] i looked and then i heard a man get up
[5:10] and say call the prayer line and people
[5:12] began to line up over on this side the
[5:15] left from where i was looking down
[5:16] towards the platform and they're lying
[5:18] all the way up and down the street for a
[5:20] prayer line now notice to my left which
[5:22] have been to my right if i was on the
[5:24] platform
[5:25] a little wooden building
[5:27] and i've seen that light
[5:30] that oh they have a picture of you know
[5:32] it's always in the meeting i've seen
[5:34] that light leave me and go to that
[5:36] building and go in that building
[5:39] and a voice said to me i'll meet you in
[5:42] there that'll be the third full i said
[5:45] why he said well it won't be a public
[5:49] show like the hell is
[5:51] and
[5:53] i came too
[5:55] and i now at the beginning of this new
[5:58] year back to my tabernacle where it
[6:00] started from and
[6:02] back to the beginning where i started
[6:04] i am very grateful to god for these
[6:09] things and many of you know that just
[6:11] before
[9:49] somewhere in the service that you'll in
[9:51] your heart
[9:52] say yes lord this is the day when i take
[9:55] my make my decision to serve you the
[9:57] rest of my life
[10:00] it's a wonderful day
[10:02] i'm sure over our eyes has been just
[10:06] available even believers who we can't
[10:09] see just what's going on around us you
[10:11] see and
[10:12] many times spiritual lead people are
[10:15] misunderstood
[10:16] and they don't to the peoples of the
[10:19] world because it's such a strange and an
[10:22] odd life to live a full
[10:25] surrendered life to the lord jesus
