[12:03] certain treatment
[12:08] and i think last year
[12:13] in convention i was in congo in
[12:15] lubumbashi for a convention
[12:21] and after the convention i felt that i
[12:23] wasn't feeling well
[12:29] i told myself maybe it was the work
[12:30] because i really worked hard
[12:33] maybe i needed to take a real response
[12:36] i took
[12:39] but it got worse my condition got worse
[12:45] and then toward the end of the year
[12:48] it became very worse
[12:54] i wasn't even able to stood up for five
[12:56] minutes
[12:58] i couldn't understand it just happened
[12:59] that way
[13:04] and after a couple weeks
[13:08] i wasn't able to sit down
[13:11] i couldn't sit down
[13:14] i was always i i needed to be late to
[13:17] lay down syrian shares alongside
[13:31] at the end of the year i was sitting
[13:34] a period upon me because when it was a
[13:37] pandemic or mother champion and in

[14:08] until i was really completely down well
[14:12] mafia increased the sun and they took
[14:14] some blood tests
[14:18] and it looks like i didn't have enough
[14:20] blood in me
[14:23] and i went to emergency in the hospital
[14:28] and the hospital where i went to they
[14:30] were
[14:31] done

[14:46] getting drugs i was getting was not
[14:48] appropriate
[14:54] i was getting a little high uh quantity
[15:11] and he really destroyed the blood
[15:14] the defense and i couldn't uh have
[15:18] my immune system was down voila
[15:21] impossible it was very impossible
[15:24] medicine according to medicine because

[32:31] amen amen
[32:35] situation is very explicit
[32:38] it's very serious that we can think
[32:40] about it can you listen to it i see that
[32:42] negligence you sitting next to
[32:44] an affair but you're going to hell
[32:47] that's why my brothers and sisters
[32:51] we have to take things
[32:53] with a lot of seriousness amen amen amen
[32:58] the important things
[33:01] that god has given to a man
[33:03] it's his soul amen amen
[33:07] everything else is vanity commander
[33:37] at that leg list there are few people in
[33:38] the church
[33:40] they are my friends sister brothers and
[33:41] sisters
[33:42] in the church
[33:45] but they are going to hell
[33:49] what up in conferences sir that's why my
[33:51] brothers and sisters know some that's in
[33:53] the book we are in that age
[33:58] where we cannot uh uh joke around with
[34:00] the play with the words se le poke it's
[34:03] a time
[34:19] why
[34:20] aleppo because back in the day
[34:24] we took so much time
[34:27] because the message was not in the end
[34:31] because people thought
[35:44] we are in the edge
[35:47] where we have to preach uh
[35:53] every single time when you're coming to
[35:55] church i'll offend you after after
[36:20] nobody can go and really touch the
[36:22] deepness of god amen amen okay nobody
[36:48] that's why a christian has to pay
[36:49] attention to what he's saying amen amen
[36:52] did you say
[37:06] a man can feel that he has reached
[37:09] be careful
[37:12] it's the enemy that's really next to you
[37:16] it's just to uh to finish here
[37:18] are you with me
[37:20] it's very important
[37:32] why are we in this place
[37:49] talking about a homeless and then it was
[37:52] somewhere
[37:54] he didn't know where he was coming from
[37:56] secular
[37:57] what he was doing
[37:59] and where it was going
[38:02] position
[38:03] it's a terrible position to be in in for
[38:05] set the spread the closure you
[38:08] know you don't want the homeless spirits
[38:11] to get in people's in the membership
[38:13] people said the member of shawn
[38:15] that announcing
[38:16] the
[38:57] you have to receive revelation first
[39:00] if you do something without revelation
[39:03] just because other people are sure
[39:06] just because your parents are in the way
[39:09] like this if you're just saying things
[39:10] because people are saying
[39:13] it's not going to be profitable to you
[39:15] amen amen
[39:17] you have to receive that revelation
[39:20] for what you're coming to trump amen
[39:21] amen
[39:23] why only this message
[39:26] what is the second
[39:40] we want god to reveal himself to us
[39:44] because without revelation
[39:46] revelation without revelation to march
[39:48] or something you're going without a
[39:50] break
[39:52] amen amen
[39:57] you know with that even being uh when
[39:59] this church started amen amen
[40:02] i can tell you without being religious
[40:04] just take it down
[40:06] that the people that were here in this
[40:08] church are not no more
[40:11] confirmation
[40:16] because i am a pastor that's what i know
[40:22] because when a person is doing something
[40:24] with that revolution
[40:25] even a small wind valley this
[40:27] stabilization will destabilize them and
[40:30] also even uh
[40:33] will destabilize them
[40:35] interpretation a wrong interpretation in
[40:38] the first interpretation of false
[40:40] interpretation then actor of an action
[40:44] beneath it we'll just shake them amen
[40:47] amen
[40:48] amen amen
[41:05] [Applause]
[41:36] [Music]
[41:40] think about a woman in the bible jesus
[41:44] god has treated her as a dog
[41:47] wow
[41:48] brothers
[41:55] i cannot take the food of it
[41:57] and give it to dogs sausage
[41:59] that's that's not
[42:14] that's why you have to have revelation
[42:16] amen
[42:17] it's true amen
[42:22] to get revelation amen
[42:25] personally may god reveal himself to you
[42:28] personally
[42:29] so you can understand why you are here
[42:32] amen are you with me
[42:34] i was telling your brother
[42:36] a lot of people are coming today
[42:40] they say they thought they're calling
[42:41] pastor my passion
[42:55] are you with me
[42:57] come to the academy
[42:58] pastor when you're telling someone you
[43:00] are my person
[43:01] what the bible is saying
[43:04] in the life of a man
[43:06] there are two choices
[43:08] major choices there's a choice of a
[43:10] woman
[43:39] or feminism she will be me
[43:41] as a female pastor
[43:43] the pastor is told
[43:46] now i'm talking about the truth
[43:49] the truth of the church is the choice of
[43:51] eternity
[44:18] the choice of a pastor
[44:35] that doesn't mean
[44:37] you can do great things that's fine
[44:39] christians are doing this
[44:42] but the important things i have in me
[44:45] i'll give it to you pastor say my name
[44:47] this is my soul and you name
[45:04] and then someone is talking bad about
[45:06] this person are you listening
[45:09] to your question and someone is talking
[45:10] uh he's insulting him and you're
[45:12] listening
[45:13] to the fact that that person is bringing
[45:15] your soul in front of that
[45:42] so that you can be happy and happy amen
[46:12] it was just you know uh nothing the the
[46:14] defund the shots in italy it was nothing
[46:17] second
[46:18] the world is just when when someone is
[46:20] stranded
[46:22] that's when the men
[46:24] is lack revelations
[46:55] just believe that what god has given you
[46:57] is the best amen amen yes sir

[55:59] in the bible
[56:09] i just don't take it from one place amen
[56:12] amen amen
[56:17] you cannot base your faith upon one
[56:19] scripture
[56:21] are you with me it's just a syrian
[56:22] referendum just one reference no no sir
[56:25] it is he says this it is
[56:42] right straight
[57:05] but if it doesn't coincide with the rest
[57:08] of it in there it's pointing to the
[57:10] bible
[57:11] are you listening to me
[57:14] you can develop a subject yeah a really
[57:16] good one
[57:20] the church is like a woman
[57:22] a motive
[57:24] a woman is uh
[57:26] he has a lot of emotions she's been
[57:28] created that way
[57:30] you can develop herself
[57:37] are you with me it is
[57:43] [Music]
[57:45] if it didn't coincide with the rest of
[57:47] the scripture
[57:48] amen
[57:50] you know throughout amen amen
[58:08] and all scripture will fit together if
[58:10] it's right quickly and together
[58:12] it's just like a big gym
[58:15] i'm going to stop here amen amen you
[58:18] know
[58:19] he's telling us
[58:20] the info we cannot base our faith in
[58:23] doctrine our doctrine inquires uh
[58:28] just upon one scripture just to study
[58:30] negativity just once upon a scripture
[58:34] even if he was preaching
[59:01] when it's breaking it's pretty
[59:03] you have to stop you're here you
[59:05] have to pray basket down said to me
[59:08] because in this bible that we have
[59:10] message
[59:11] you know including the the entertainment
[59:14] very techies
[59:15] there are not two truths that are
[59:31] that we need to take consider
[59:33] to uh to believe that those are the
[59:35] truths
[59:36] the scripture said no we have to leave
[59:38] it aside
[59:41] because this scripture this bible
[1:00:25] it's a false perception of the thing the
[1:00:27] secretary is a combatant scripture don't
[1:00:29] fight each other amen amen
[1:00:33] when they're bringing the scriptures
[1:00:36] you don't have to uh defend the sound
[1:00:38] from the scripture
[1:00:40] before you take that scripture just get
[1:00:41] you did about the cell called the
[1:00:43] present what are you saying about the
[1:00:44] scripture that's been brought to you
[1:00:47] amen amen
[1:00:51] because there are not two truths that
[1:00:52] are foreign
[1:01:04] [Applause]
[1:01:23] we are making the prophet a false
[1:01:25] prophet
[1:01:27] and we know he's the true prophet
[1:01:30] prophet
[1:01:31] the greatest prophet of all ages
[1:01:34] you believe like me amen
[1:01:49] oh let's give a clap to god
[1:01:52] amen
[1:01:58] now we're going based on this
[1:02:02] because we're talking about the bride's
[1:02:03] revival foreign
[1:02:19] now we are in the revival
[1:02:22] it's the ego revival
[1:02:26] that we just read in memphis
[1:02:29] where there will be uh
[1:02:30] wherever the caucus is
[1:02:32] there will
[1:03:01] it already perish and we cannot eat it
[1:03:02] amen amen on the mounds of us
[1:03:05] we cannot eat what was contaminated
[1:03:09] because it would bring diseases
[1:03:12] yeah and when did you come to a man
[1:03:14] forever
[1:04:01] they're pushing you to accept it
[1:04:03] are you listening to me get to this
[1:04:06] moment yeah they want you to say my
[1:04:08] beauty
[1:04:09] by high pressure can you wish that group
[1:04:12] yes sir they want you to make it your
[1:04:14] own it's become your own demonstration
[1:04:17] my suffering
[1:04:19] my uh my trials
[1:04:22] are you with me
[1:04:24] yes it shows negative they want you to
[1:04:26] be uh to make it your own
[1:04:29] but the brand was saying somewhere
[1:04:32] that's the devil's language
[1:04:37] negative everything that's negative it's
[1:04:39] appropriate they show the negative to
[1:04:42] make them appropriate
[1:04:45] to make your own
[1:04:46] appropriate it's the demonstration
[1:04:49] even if it's there
[1:04:51] you know with all the centers
[1:05:19] there's only two
[1:05:20] things are you with me
[1:05:24] all the diseases will die and you live
[1:05:28] continue
[1:05:29] to communicate you're not going to keep
[1:05:30] working with the disease oh my god my
[1:05:33] brother my high pressure
[1:05:58] are you with me is the church with me
[1:06:00] amen

[1:07:30] when a man eats it
[1:07:33] he will bring disease to him
[1:07:37] and the purpose of a disease
[1:07:40] is to kill that person amen amen
[1:07:44] are you with me
[1:07:47] you know as you are staying here we are
[1:07:49] doubting amen amen
[1:07:54] because uh brothers uh brother barnabas
[1:07:56] preached something about the inner man
[1:07:58] amen amen
[1:08:01] what are you seeing right now it's the
[1:08:02] experience
[1:08:05] but there's also a inner man
[1:08:07] are you with me amen
[1:08:36] there's not another choice can't you
[1:08:38] muslim nurture spiritual when you eat
[1:08:40] spiritual food
[1:08:42] which are contaminated perished second
[1:08:45] seven
[1:08:46] enter yes it will kill that inner man in
[1:08:48] you amen emma
[1:08:50] lovely
[1:09:15] we have the influence of that
[1:09:17] denomination
[1:09:33] defined the church as an individual amen
[1:09:35] amen
[1:09:38] it's one man it's a man man
[1:09:40] people who are coming here amen amen
[1:09:44] they are supporting this ministry
[1:09:46] with their presence
[1:09:48] their prayers lord themselves they
[1:09:51] typhoon offerings
[1:09:54] they those are the people who have that
[1:09:56] they have said
[1:09:58] individuals you now you you realize that
[1:10:00] a church
[1:10:08] now the denomination is also someone
[1:10:10] it's not wonderful
[1:10:12] as we are here amen amen that the
[1:10:37] we're just going to give you something
[1:10:39] that will help us
[1:10:41] very loudly and our work towards
[1:10:43] amen towards heaven amen
[1:10:48] the importance of
[1:10:50] a pride revival
[1:10:57] why do we have to pay attention you know
[1:11:00] to the denominational revival first
[1:11:02] there's uh brothers and sisters
[1:11:05] we have to pay very attention amen amen
[1:11:10] sometimes we look at the prophets
[1:11:18] brother branham had a
[1:11:20] mission
[1:11:22] he had a commission was that
[1:11:24] are you
[1:12:07] because of mixing things
[1:12:09] today
[1:12:16] and we don't even recognize the woman
[1:12:18] that we recognize in the beginning
[1:12:19] across the melange because of mixing
[1:12:21] things
[1:12:23] set especially
[1:12:25] the rare species
[1:12:28] the malachi cattle of malachi foreign
[1:12:36] protected by the angel of the lord amen
[1:12:39] amen
[1:12:41] you know the people of the world they're
[1:12:42] copying jesus
[1:12:45] there's a species that are being
[1:12:46] protected the bible says
[1:12:48] the
[1:13:23] and you can see that with a woman
[1:13:26] that's what the prophet says
[1:13:29] when you go inside
[1:13:30] what
[1:13:43] is able to tune in
[1:13:46] it's a way god is giving to a man
[1:13:49] but a woman cannot
[1:13:53] so we're going to be able to deal with
[1:13:54] but it's amazing that's what the bible
[1:13:56] says a wise woman will build his house
[1:14:40] we believe the message when we had the
[1:14:42] president called mobutu many people
[1:14:44] in that time the president republican
[1:14:49] at that time the the the president has
[1:14:51] uh forbid for these are people who come
[1:14:54] in this
[1:15:06] regardless of the general
[1:15:38] in the name of revelation
[1:15:40] we are fallen
[1:15:42] amen
[1:15:43] are you with me church
[1:15:46] in the name of reference
[1:15:49] we ever
[1:15:50] lifted up our barriers amen amen
[1:15:56] and we have let any kind of spirits
[1:15:58] among us
[1:16:00] and today
[1:16:04] and we cannot even cast away those
[1:16:06] spirits
[1:16:08] but we are we are we must do it amen
[1:16:11] amen
[1:16:14] demarcation and because he has to have a
[1:16:16] different situation between person
[1:16:18] christian messiah
[1:16:32] has been an exceptional
[1:16:34] society
[1:16:37] there's been a people put apart
[1:16:40] that's the word that's what the prophet
[1:16:41] said it's a people put a party
[1:16:44] who's not leaving
[1:16:46] was
[1:17:13] the rest of the world
[1:17:28] that we have to examine ourselves
[1:17:32] that we have to examine ourselves
[1:17:35] for what we have become today
[1:17:38] in the name of revelation
[1:17:42] you know people
[1:18:06] god has taught us you know discipline
[1:18:08] brotherly discipline

[1:18:38] we became

[1:20:20] we are ready i don't need the secretary
[1:20:22] to give scripture the prophet
[1:20:27] because god the prophet has given us the
[1:20:29] scriptures the father

[1:27:21] denomination
[1:27:23] you continue our sympathies

[1:29:36] for you
[1:29:39] you have to think about yourself
[1:29:42] ever since you believe
[1:29:43] in tradition the message becomes a
[1:29:45] suggestion
[1:29:46] it's just a tragedy
[1:29:48] not just a habit
[1:29:50] custom tells

[1:36:05] when it's descended
[1:36:07] that's when it's proclaimed in this
[1:36:08] world
[1:36:36] to see how the
[1:37:18] oh

[1:39:32] bennies rishimore
[1:39:36] a lot of things has been said yeah
[1:39:38] currently
[1:39:44] and if that is going to bless somebody
[1:39:47] else si se la va benia que kendo
[1:39:50] is not going to do good to you sereno
[1:39:53] but i believe god has spoken to each one
[1:39:56] of us individually
[1:40:00] the new individual
[1:40:02] and that was the reason why
[1:40:04] i had that pressure
[1:40:06] to
[1:40:08] call for this service
[1:40:10] because i said question
[1:40:13] services
[1:40:15] i had a big burden on my heart javier
[1:40:18] grant
[1:40:20] that uh regardless
[1:40:22] the magray
[1:40:25] we are gonna have it friday service my
[1:40:28] goodness i want to join
[1:40:35] and i believe god knew why israel could
[1:40:38] do something
[1:40:39] and may god bless each one of you who
[1:40:42] came with a heart to receive something
[1:40:45] mega could you benefit from the
[1:40:46] vocabulary and curse the rocket casuals
[1:40:53] we have to read between the lines
[1:40:58] i felt that pressure just sometimes but
[1:41:02] i did not talk to pastor robert she
[1:41:04] remember
[1:41:05] pastor robert until two days ago just
[1:41:08] dejo
[1:41:09] when he came to boston cailla river
[1:41:11] boston this is when i asked him pastor
[1:41:14] we have scheduled an unusual service on
[1:41:17] friday
[1:41:19] and service
[1:41:22] because we want to take benefit of your
[1:41:25] stay among us
[1:41:28] he did not come really for us he came
[1:41:30] for the blood in boston
[1:41:35] and we have to find a small spot to
[1:41:39] invite him
[1:41:43] and i believe this is going to be a
[1:41:45] blessing
[1:41:47] addiction and it has been a decision
[1:41:50] because i believe god has spoken to your
[1:41:52] heart
[1:41:55] and he's going to continue to speak
[1:42:12] we have to drop all the unnecessary
[1:42:14] things the only celestials necessary and
[1:42:17] each one to focus on your individual
