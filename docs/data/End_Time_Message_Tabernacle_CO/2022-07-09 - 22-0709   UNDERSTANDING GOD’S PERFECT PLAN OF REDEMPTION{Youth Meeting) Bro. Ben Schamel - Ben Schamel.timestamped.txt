[1:05:48] but your prayer changes things for
[1:05:51] prayer
[1:05:53] so when you come tired you make the
[1:05:55] preacher tired
[1:05:57] of fatigue
[1:05:59] fatigue when you are on fire the
[1:06:01] preacher is on fire

[1:13:28] everybody happy to be in the house of

[1:13:31] [Music]
[1:13:43] i believe that worship is pleasing unto
[1:13:45] the lord
[1:13:47] i believe that when songs are saying
[1:13:52] and it's not just words that are coming
[1:13:53] off of our lives
[1:13:55] and it's real praise coming from our
[1:13:57] hearts
[1:14:12] and administrators
[1:14:15] they've been praying for these meetings
[1:14:17] and they told me ben
[1:14:19] i've prayed for those meetings
[1:14:22] god is going to do great things
[1:14:25] so we believe that god is going to do
[1:14:26] great
[1:14:28] shows have we been blessed so far
[1:14:31] amen but there is more for us
[1:14:34] so we're just very privileged and
[1:14:35] thankful
[1:14:39] if you would uh we'll go ahead and we'll
[1:14:41] jump into the scripture reading
[1:14:45] and we'll let you be seated
[1:14:50] you have your scriptures and you would
[1:14:51] turn with me to john chapter three
[1:15:05] it would be god's perfect plan of
[1:15:07] redemption
[1:15:15] that's john chapter 3 starting with
[1:15:18] verse 1.
[1:15:21] if you don't mind brother i'll read a
[1:15:22] verse and then you can read a verse and
[1:15:24] we'll go back and forth you got it
[1:15:26] and there was a man of the pharisees
[1:15:28] named nicodemus a ruler of the jews
[1:15:37] jeff yeah
[1:15:38] the same came to jesus by night and said
[1:15:40] unto him rabbi we know that thou art a
[1:15:42] teacher come from god
[1:15:44] for no man can do these miracles that
[1:15:47] thou doest except god be with him give
[1:15:50] your punishment
[1:15:58] jesus answered and said unto him verily
[1:16:00] verily i say unto thee except a man be
[1:16:03] born again he cannot enter into the
[1:16:05] kingdom of god
[1:16:14] nicodemus sayeth unto him how can a man
[1:16:16] be born when he is old can he enter the
[1:16:18] second time into his mother's womb and
[1:16:20] be born nicodem
[1:16:28] jesus answered verily verily i say unto
[1:16:31] you except a man be born of water and
[1:16:33] the spirit he cannot enter the kingdom
[1:16:35] of god jesus
[1:16:42] that which is born of the flesh is flesh
[1:16:44] and that which is born of the spirit is
[1:16:46] spiritual
[1:16:51] marvel not that i say unto you you must
[1:16:53] be born again
[1:16:58] the wind bloweth where it listeth and
[1:17:00] thou hears the sound thereof but can't
[1:17:02] not tell whence it cometh and whether it
[1:17:05] goeth
[1:17:06] so is every one that is born of the
[1:17:08] spirit
[1:17:24] and as moses lifted up the serpent in
[1:17:26] the wilderness
[1:17:28] even so must the son of man be lifted up
[1:17:37] that whosoever believeth in him should
[1:17:38] not perish but have eternal life
[1:17:44] for god so loved the world that he gave
[1:17:46] his only begotten son
[1:17:48] that whosoever believeth in him shall
[1:17:50] not perish but have everlasting life
[1:17:53] amen
[1:17:56] i
[1:18:01] for god sent not his son into the world
[1:18:03] to condemn the world
[1:18:05] but that the world through him might be
[1:18:08] saved amen do you understand
[1:18:18] your gracious heavenly father
[1:18:20] celeste lord we just come before you yet
[1:18:24] lord we come with humble hearts
[1:18:27] but we're coming with great expectations
[1:18:30] lord we're not gathering out of
[1:18:31] tradition
[1:18:34] but we're lord we're expecting
[1:18:37] lord we've sang the songs of zion
[1:18:40] lord we believe your spirit is here
[1:18:43] lord we just ask that you would have
[1:18:44] full preeminence
[1:18:47] lord we just ask that you would get the
[1:18:48] speaker out of the way
[1:18:52] lord that you would get the hearer out
[1:18:53] of the way
[1:18:56] but lord our spirits might hear directly
[1:18:57] from heaven
[1:19:00] lord we just ask that you would come
[1:19:01] together
[1:19:03] that there wouldn't be anything said
[1:19:04] that's that's displeasing unto you lord
[1:19:17] amen you may be seated and superfly
[1:19:22] so again we're just very privileged and
[1:19:24] thankful to be here this morning
[1:19:28] again we want to say thank you to our
[1:19:30] our pastor faustin
[1:19:33] for the opportunity to speak to the
[1:19:34] young people
[1:19:36] because i myself i'm a young person
[1:19:40] so in in preparing for this service
[1:19:43] i was thinking to myself
[1:19:46] i was uh going what can i say that would
[1:19:48] help the young people
[1:19:51] deletion and the lord just said well
[1:19:52] what what
[1:19:53] helps you
[1:19:55] what helps you in your walk
[1:19:59] so that's just what we'll share this
[1:20:00] morning
[1:20:03] and understanding god's perfect plan of
[1:20:06] redemption
[1:20:09] because we understand there are very
[1:20:10] many of us here
[1:20:14] and each one of us is at a different
[1:20:15] phase in life
[1:20:43] many of our influences are put there by
[1:20:45] our parents
[1:20:47] all of our standards are put there by
[1:20:49] our parents
[1:20:52] but as we begin to grow
[1:20:56] we must learn to create those standards
[1:20:58] for ourselves
[1:21:01] a wise man once told me a
[1:21:03] a wise man told me
[1:21:06] when i was very young
[1:21:08] he said then you must study he might
[1:21:09] adventure dwight and you study
[1:21:11] that you might show yourself approved
[1:21:15] you need it you need to study the words
[1:21:18] so that when you get older you are
[1:21:19] anchored in the words
[1:21:23] no you're no longer tossed about
[1:21:26] and when
[1:22:08] by how the world would like to push us
[1:22:12] that's why you see so many young people
[1:22:15] when they get to be our age
[1:22:17] they start to question the message
[1:22:20] because they never studied for
[1:22:22] themselves
[1:22:36] but it must go further than just brother
[1:22:37] brennan
[1:22:39] and it must be a direct word from god
[1:22:44] and it must rest in your heart
[1:22:48] if i could say it this way
[1:22:50] we must have
[1:23:17] the
[1:23:18] scientific world the monster
[1:23:20] thought that the bible had messed up
[1:23:21] somewhere
[1:23:24] when the scripture says
[1:23:25] the man's heart he thinks
[1:23:28] don't care
[1:23:29] because all the mental faculties are in
[1:23:31] the mind
[1:24:03] [Music]
[1:24:14] that's not just something that you think
[1:24:15] in your mind
[1:24:18] but it's something that you truly
[1:24:19] believe
[1:24:22] do we understand
[1:24:25] so we must must bathe ourselves in the
[1:24:28] god's words
[1:24:51] and as soon as they enter that little
[1:24:53] seat of doubt
[1:24:55] what may feel good
[1:25:07] out of the word of god
[1:25:12] so if we don't study now as young people
[1:25:17] when are we going to study
[1:25:20] we're at a crossroads of our life muslim
[1:25:22] doesn't care for the novi many of us
[1:25:24] here a year from now may be married
[1:25:29] we'll have families and responsibilities
[1:25:32] but as of now
[1:25:33] no you're gonna have the least amount of
[1:25:35] responsibility in your life now
[1:26:42] so through this message god has showed
[1:26:43] us the perfect plan of redemption
[1:26:47] is
[1:27:02] nature
[1:27:09] [Music]
[1:27:33] so the prophet tells us
[1:27:35] god often works through numbers
[1:27:39] and we can see that he works in threes
[1:27:41] and sevens and 12.
[1:27:45] and brother branham talks many times
[1:27:46] about the number 3.
[1:27:49] and he instructs us and says that god is
[1:27:51] made complete in the number 3.
[1:27:55] he is made perfect in 3.
[1:27:58] and we are also made perfect in the
[1:28:00] number three
[1:28:01] antoine
[1:28:03] god as your element we know him
[1:28:05] look at his song is father
[1:28:07] son
[1:28:08] holy spirit
[1:28:10] us as a human
[1:28:18] so we know even that the natural life
[1:28:20] shows the same thing
[1:28:23] whenever a new baby is born
[1:28:25] first there is water
[1:28:36] and it is through this that god has been
[1:28:38] showing us
[1:28:40] the perfect
[1:28:54] come
[1:29:20] and some of us
[1:29:21] are going to go on to the holy ghost
[1:29:27] so if you have your scriptures and you
[1:29:28] would turn over with me
[1:29:31] we're going to read from revelations
[1:29:35] and we'll we'll read a little bit of
[1:29:37] scripture here
[1:29:39] you see revelations chapter 21
[1:29:44] this is john speaking this is jean paul
[1:29:47] he says and i saw a new heaven and a new
[1:29:49] earth
[1:29:50] for the first heaven and the first earth
[1:29:53] were passed away and there was no more
[1:29:56] see
[1:30:07] and i john saw the holy city new
[1:30:09] jerusalem coming down from god out of
[1:30:11] heaven prepared like a bride adorned for
[1:30:14] her her husband amen
[1:30:18] i will send an evil
[1:30:34] but we are heavenly creatures
[1:30:36] this world is not our home
[1:30:39] we're just a passing throne
[1:30:43] verse 3.
[1:30:45] and i heard a great voice out of heaven
[1:30:47] saying behold the tabernacle of god is
[1:30:49] with men and he will dwell with them and
[1:30:52] they shall be his people and the god
[1:30:55] and god himself shall be with them
[1:30:58] and be their god amen
[1:31:14] so we can uh illustrate some of these
[1:31:16] things
[1:31:19] because god's plan of redemption is
[1:31:20] perfect
[1:31:23] and it's the same plan
[1:31:25] from the beginning of history
[1:31:28] throughout
[1:31:34] so if we were to draw the
[1:31:36] tabernacle this is you are all going to
[1:31:38] be familiar with this it was familiar
[1:31:41] the tabernacle in the wilderness had an
[1:31:42] outer court
[1:31:46] it also had an inner court
[1:31:49] and then it also had the holy of holies
[1:31:54] and we had a prophet come and tell us
[1:31:55] what each of these phases are
[1:32:19] [Music]
[1:32:24] and as we said the other night
[1:32:27] the light in this area is from the
[1:32:29] earthly sun
[1:32:34] so you are affected by all of the
[1:32:36] earthly elements
[1:33:20] had the same manner it is
[1:33:23] in the outer court
[1:33:25] as what was in the holiest of holies
[1:33:31] but all of the manna that the children
[1:33:33] of israel would eat methuselah
[1:34:02] and that's what happens with many young
[1:34:04] christians right now
[1:34:07] they go to a camp meeting
[1:34:10] they go to a banquet evol doesn't
[1:34:12] banquet they go to special meetings
[1:34:14] and the manna for them
[1:34:43] christians in past ages could only walk
[1:34:46] that far
[1:34:50] but that's why it was so important that
[1:34:51] this message came in
[1:34:55] that god didn't block us out
[1:34:58] and keep us in
[1:35:09] so then we come into the inner courts
[1:35:12] the light there is a manufactured light
[1:35:16] fabric
[1:35:17] it's a light of golden candlesticks
[1:35:21] and brother branham said that
[1:35:23] they will smoke
[1:35:26] they will fume
[1:35:44] he said why do i feel like i love the
[1:35:46] lord so much on one day
[1:35:51] and then the next day
[1:35:53] i feel like i love the world
[1:35:57] it's because you're on this phase of
[1:35:59] your christians
[1:36:02] we're at a crossroads right
[1:36:05] now don't give up
[1:36:07] but continue your walk with the
[1:36:34] [Applause]
[1:36:36] our pastor
[1:36:50] god
[1:36:53] and one eye on the world
[1:36:55] and when you do that you because
[1:36:59] you're
[1:37:00] questioning your eyes get crossed then
[1:37:01] you see more than one
[1:37:05] many times we see the god head like this
[1:37:08] comes to see
[1:37:10] god the father
[1:37:12] almost unreachable we've never seen him
[1:37:16] i'm not saying this is how it is this is
[1:37:18] how he says
[1:37:27] and then here's the holy spirit
[1:37:30] and that's what we have access to
[1:37:46] but that is only because we're looking
[1:37:48] at it on the earthly horizontal view
[1:37:50] basically
[1:37:53] but this is not how god looks
[1:37:56] god looks at it from a heavenly view
[1:37:59] of celeste and when you look at it from
[1:38:00] the heavens celeste then it looks
[1:38:04] just like how brother branham
[1:38:06] put it
[1:38:08] but you see the rings like this
[1:38:13] so now this is the father
[1:38:21] so these these are not three different
[1:38:23] persons
[1:38:26] but it is one person
[1:38:28] in three
[1:38:56] we have a soul
[1:39:00] so when you only accept the word of god
[1:39:02] out here on the flesh
[1:39:06] that will only take you so far
[1:39:10] if you only take it to the the uh the
[1:39:13] second layer of the minister
[1:39:16] then you become legalistic
[1:39:19] and you're following the rules of god
[1:39:22] only because they're lost
[1:39:38] hello
[1:39:53] those same temptations may come
[1:39:57] but now the believer is at rest
[1:40:00] they're no longer struggling
[1:40:05] but they have the true revelation of
[1:40:07] faith
[1:40:09] and they're at total rest
[1:40:12] that's why you can see some christians
[1:40:14] it seems like thing after thing happens
[1:40:19] but they never wavered
[1:40:29] and that is because they're living in
[1:40:31] the holiest of holy see basketball don't
[1:40:33] send their son
[1:40:48] okay and i just want to point out how
[1:40:50] this even even the world itself goes
[1:40:52] through the same process
[1:40:59] so by these scriptures that we just read
[1:41:01] in revelations 21. don't know
[1:41:28] he says by these passages one might
[1:41:30] think
[1:41:45] earth
[1:41:47] see that the heavens will be gone
[1:41:51] and the earth will be gone
[1:41:53] completely annihilated
[1:41:56] but he says
[1:41:59] and with the help of the holy spirit
[1:42:01] we can see the truth of this
[1:42:05] that it's what we're going into
[1:42:10] it's only the atmospheres around it says
[1:42:48] and he says every two thousand years
[1:42:49] something will happen
[1:42:52] so the first 2 000 years
[1:42:54] purged
[1:43:22] just like the first earth
[1:43:26] was covered in water
[1:43:28] it annihilated all the sin in that day
[1:43:34] with fire
[1:43:36] that will return it back to its original
[1:43:38] state
[1:43:40] so we can see here
[1:43:43] and brother
[1:43:44] mentions this in the future
[1:43:48] that john and peter both saw the same
[1:43:50] thing
[1:44:03] and hopefully this isn't too slow and
[1:44:05] methodical for you but you can follow
[1:44:08] me
[1:44:09] because when we see the big plan of god
[1:44:12] start to see how much god cares about
[1:44:15] you hey
[1:44:17] and god didn't just do all of this for
[1:44:19] happenstance
[1:44:22] but it's a pattern because he loves you
[1:44:26] and we'll get to that in a minute
[1:44:31] second
[1:44:32] peter 3.
[1:44:35] let's start with verse
[1:44:37] verse 3.
[1:44:39] knowing this first that there shall come
[1:44:41] in the last days scoffers walking after
[1:44:43] their own lusts
[1:44:50] and saying where is the promise of his
[1:44:52] coming emotion
[1:44:57] since the fathers fell asleep all things
[1:45:00] continue as they were from the beginning
[1:45:02] of the creation
[1:45:07] and brother branham uses that scripture
[1:45:09] right there
[1:45:11] to prove to us
[1:45:14] that we are living on the second earth
[1:45:18] not a different earth is in framework
[1:45:23] it has been purged by the waters
[1:45:31] verse six this is cease whereby the
[1:45:33] world
[1:45:34] that then was being overflowed with
[1:45:37] water perished
[1:45:42] a
[1:45:45] this is a perfect type of the believer
[1:45:47] this is
[1:45:49] now when he is purged with water
[1:45:53] parlor when he is baptized
[1:45:56] in the correct
[1:46:24] now it is purged
[1:46:55] [Applause]
[1:47:32] hopefully this is all right just because
[1:47:34] if i preach anything that's different
[1:47:35] than what
[1:47:36] you know your pastor preaches then you
[1:47:38] follow what your pastor said
[1:47:42] but this is just something that helped
[1:47:43] me
[1:47:44] make more when i could see the big
[1:47:46] picture of what god is trying to lose
[1:47:50] and see that he's doing it just for me
[1:47:54] he put me in this age he made me don't
[1:47:56] sit down after the seventh messenger has
[1:47:58] come apart
[1:48:00] so that i could catch the revelation
[1:48:27] [Applause]
[1:48:30] to cover me in his blood i bet so soon
[1:48:32] that all those things
[1:48:35] all things are coming
[1:48:38] and that he's going to destroy this
[1:48:39] entire earth
[1:48:52] do you see how much god loves them
[1:49:01] so the anilusian world was purged by
[1:49:03] water
[1:49:06] purging it from all the sin that was on
[1:49:08] the earth
[1:49:11] now the framework of the earth
[1:49:16] was not destroyed
[1:49:19] but it was only cleansed on the outside
[1:49:24] we're still here
[1:49:27] then the blood comes and silos
[1:49:30] so we can enter into the inner corner
[1:49:34] and then the fire comes it looks
[1:49:35] dissolved and and and you can come into
[1:49:38] aloe vera
[1:49:40] the holiest of holdings
[1:49:42] this is why god had to die it's a book
[1:49:44] this is why he had to send his son
[1:49:47] because that veil
[1:49:49] had to be read
[1:49:51] and once that the veil is written
[1:49:54] that allows
[1:50:08] but i believe there is a difference
[1:50:09] between being anointed with the holy
[1:50:11] spirit your working defense on earth
[1:50:14] when you sent us plea as being
[1:50:16] uh filled and sealed with the holy
[1:50:18] spirit
[1:50:21] yes sir brother branham said that you
[1:50:22] can have the holy spirit every day of
[1:50:24] your life
[1:50:26] and you can still go to heaven
[1:50:29] but once you are seated
[1:50:36] that
[1:50:55] [Applause]
[1:51:00] amen that's right but before that we
[1:51:02] have not come into the manifestations of
[1:51:04] the sons of god
[1:51:19] i know i put it in my hand is your
[1:51:20] message to my man i can feel the water
[1:51:22] until low i can see the water
[1:51:25] now my body is wet
[1:51:26] i am affected by the water
[1:51:29] hey man praise god picture brother but
[1:51:31] when i drink the water
[1:51:40] one may make me feel good look for my
[1:51:42] family
[1:51:43] when i go swimming it may be fun
[1:51:46] it may
[1:52:05] [Applause]
[1:52:06] [Music]
[1:52:21] if we do not take the holy spirit within
[1:52:24] ourselves
[1:52:26] then you will not fully overcome this
[1:52:28] world
[1:52:51] but this is why god sent the message
[1:52:54] do not be ashamed
[1:52:57] [Applause]
[1:53:10] so
[1:53:11] [Applause]
[1:53:19] but i'm supposed to be able to overcome
[1:53:21] this people out of the land
[1:54:02] [Applause]
[1:54:06] we have to read
[1:54:35] the rules of this world are not our
[1:54:36] absolutes
[1:54:38] absolutely we don't only not kill people
[1:54:42] because the law of this land says it's
[1:54:44] wrong
[1:54:47] but you look out into the world
[1:55:07] many many people are upset about that
[1:55:13] oh you're taking away a constitutional
[1:55:14] right
[1:55:17] [Applause]
[1:55:30] is
[1:55:56] you're always going to struggle with all
[1:55:58] these worldly things
[1:56:00] because you have not been washed by the
[1:56:02] fire of god you've never paid the love
[1:56:04] about the food you have not been purged
[1:56:07] you have not been transferred
[1:56:09] from me
[1:56:10] that's right with the fire of god
[1:56:12] battlefield
[1:56:26] ye transform me
[1:56:28] thrust for me by the renewing of your
[1:56:30] mind
[1:56:32] that you may prove what is good and
[1:56:34] acceptable
[1:56:38] and perfect
[1:56:56] then we would have a different love for
[1:56:58] ourselves
[1:57:01] then forgiveness wouldn't be so hard in
[1:57:03] our lives
[1:57:05] and all this brother wrongs me
[1:57:07] well this person did that too
[1:57:10] or he said something wrong to me about
[1:57:11] some uh to someone else
[1:57:15] and start harboring bitterness
[1:57:21] so far to say
[1:57:40] [Applause]
[1:57:50] forgave
[1:58:03] we are being transformed
[1:58:07] for me amen
[1:58:09] so i like how the scripture says in
[1:58:11] revelations 21.
[1:58:14] the tabernacle
[1:58:16] of god the tabernacle of the jew is
[1:58:46] that god thought enough of you
[1:58:50] let me tell you a little bit about this
[1:58:51] tabernacle listen
[1:58:54] this tabernacle the holy of holies
[1:58:57] you had to be a high priest
[1:59:28] that we might be able to live together
[1:59:30] could be some people every day
[1:59:33] and if god be for you is it
[1:59:35] if god before you did your vote then who
[1:59:38] can be against you
[1:59:40] so the next time the devil comes to you
[1:59:43] man you allah love the things of the
[1:59:44] world oh touch him it shows demon no no
[1:59:46] i don't no you're not much embarrassed
[1:59:48] that's called a temptation it's a
[1:59:50] position
[1:59:51] it's not a desire
[1:59:53] that's a temptation
[2:00:11] so we see how those diagrams all line up
[2:00:14] one come on don't say croqueta
[2:00:16] the the big picture of the even the
[2:00:18] earth itself
[2:00:21] water low blood the sun spirit
[2:00:53] said it foreign md he drew two hearts
[2:00:56] he said if the heart of man
[2:00:59] has a snake in it
[2:01:02] then it's going to be perverted
[2:01:06] but if that heart of man this is a curd
[2:01:09] alone gets transformed and closed for me
[2:01:12] and now it has a dove
[2:01:14] in colombia
[2:01:16] then it will start to change the man
[2:01:20] not from
[2:01:26] [Applause]
[2:01:34] so before we get into the holy of holies
[2:01:37] we keep trying to change ourselves like
[2:01:39] this who says something should they want
[2:01:40] to the next day yeah i'm going to try to
[2:01:42] quit cussing
[2:01:46] quit looking at pornography
[2:02:00] because the inside man is not changed
[2:02:10] [Applause]
[2:02:23] just like brother branham says they come
[2:02:24] from an embled if you take an orange
[2:02:26] tree
[2:02:28] and you graft in another life
[2:02:43] [Applause]
[2:02:57] is going to be born on that branch
[2:03:02] will be the same exact fruit
[2:03:06] that was in the original trees
[2:03:08] [Applause]
[2:03:10] so now we can see how the church of our
[2:03:12] age is
[2:04:21] i don't want to put on that dress one
[2:04:23] should vape
[2:04:24] it's going to be too much work oh it's
[2:04:25] just good
[2:04:26] i can't do all the things that i want to
[2:04:28] do in there
[2:04:30] the inner man has not been changed
[2:04:39] hey man
[2:04:42] where was i second peter 3
[2:04:47] and verse 6
[2:04:50] where whereby the world that then was
[2:04:53] being overflowed with water perished
[2:05:00] but the heavens and the earth which are
[2:05:02] now
[2:05:04] which brother branham said is the earth
[2:05:05] we're living in foreign
[2:05:09] by the same word are kept in store
[2:05:14] reserved unto fire against the day of
[2:05:17] judgment
[2:05:33] that one day is what the lord is a
[2:05:35] thousand years
[2:05:38] in a thousand years as one day
[2:05:42] the lord is not slack concerning his
[2:05:44] promise
[2:05:58] not willing that any should perish
[2:06:02] but that all should come into repentance
[2:06:05] amen
[2:06:08] so god died for the world and she
[2:06:10] dreamed
[2:06:11] of democracy
[2:06:14] he would that none would perish
[2:06:17] but man we have free moral agents
[2:06:23] it's your choice
[2:06:27] it's your choice which road you take
[2:06:34] he didn't start working for the lord
[2:06:36] when he was 16 17 years old
[2:06:40] can you imagine
[2:06:42] he brought thousands and thousands to
[2:06:44] the lord
[2:06:46] given millions to the lord
[2:06:48] and that was in his time
[2:06:50] imagine the millions that are in the
[2:06:52] message
[2:06:55] of those rubies and jewels that will be
[2:06:56] in his group
[2:06:59] and he said i have one regret
[2:07:01] that i didn't start serving the lord
[2:07:05] i know that there are many temptations
[2:07:09] but we must serve the lord now
[2:07:23] they can't do as much affair
[2:07:26] many times you can see when a revival
[2:07:28] breaks out in a church
[2:07:31] it breaks out among the young people
[2:07:33] first
[2:07:34] of all
[2:07:35] when a new fire is stirred up
[2:07:38] and those young people have a burning
[2:07:39] desire
[2:07:42] and that fire doesn't just stay inside
[2:07:45] but that fire begins to smile
[2:07:49] they'll start witnessing all those
[2:07:50] things
[2:07:52] and that
[2:07:53] [Applause]
[2:08:18] we've seen what the devil can do with
[2:08:20] them
[2:08:21] [Applause]
[2:08:34] but in the day of the lord will come as
[2:08:36] a thief in the night.
[2:08:40] in which the heavens shall pass away
[2:08:45] with a great noise
[2:08:47] up
[2:08:48] and the elements shall melt with fervent
[2:08:50] heat
[2:08:53] the earth also and the works that are
[2:08:55] therein shall be burned up
[2:09:00] this fire that's going to purge the
[2:09:01] earth
[2:09:24] [Applause]
[2:09:29] brother branham said even all of the
[2:09:31] water that's on the earth
[2:09:34] think of how deep the sea is imaginable
[2:09:37] many of you have never been overseas
[2:09:39] many have traveled overseas
[2:09:42] flying in an airplane
[2:09:44] [Applause]
[2:09:59] hmm
[2:10:00] it will completely change what is on the
[2:10:02] face
[2:10:06] and god is doing that for yourself
[2:10:10] that is how much change we feel
[2:10:28] [Applause]
[2:10:55] thank you lord came out
[2:10:59] second peter 1-1
[2:11:02] uh
[2:11:03] simon peter a servant and a possible of
[2:11:05] an apostle of jesus christ
[2:11:10] to them that have
[2:11:12] obtained like precious faith
[2:11:15] with us through the righteousness of god
[2:11:17] and our savior jesus christ
[2:11:36] christmas grace and peace be multiplied
[2:11:39] unto you through the knowledge of god
[2:11:41] and of jesus christ our lord amen
[2:11:49] according as his divine power hath given
[2:11:52] unto us all things that pertain into
[2:11:54] life and godliness through the knowledge
[2:11:56] of him that hath called us unto glory
[2:11:59] and virtue amen
[2:12:02] to
[2:12:03] contribute
[2:12:33] you said this is a buddha
[2:12:34] but he said that salvation is for all
[2:12:37] that would be like
[2:12:40] and all that would accept it by faith
[2:12:55] he said if you had enough faith you
[2:12:56] could create a world and go live
[2:13:02] amen
[2:13:04] so now we see that
[2:13:06] we are amateur gods
[2:13:09] and we have the right to change the
[2:13:11] atmosphere in our life
[2:13:25] [Applause]
[2:13:29] that's right
[2:13:30] so because you have the power of god
[2:13:32] living inside of it
[2:13:36] creating a world and going and living on
[2:13:37] it is not out of the question
[2:13:41] but you are now living in that godly
[2:13:43] atmosphere
[2:13:46] not on a different world
[2:13:49] on the same earth
[2:13:52] in a different world
[2:13:56] do you
[2:14:01] many times we just try to put things out
[2:14:03] into the future
[2:14:06] oh we will have the faith to go create a
[2:14:07] world
[2:14:10] said you already have
[2:14:35] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[2:14:38] great
[2:14:49] you might be partakers of the divine
[2:14:53] nature
[2:14:59] praise god
[2:15:01] this is our nature
[2:15:06] when we are born again
[2:15:09] brother branham says we receive a new
[2:15:10] nature
[2:15:13] without a new nature
[2:15:15] we can't get along with our neighbors
[2:15:18] we can't get along with our pastors
[2:15:20] you can't even
[2:15:35] that's what peter is telling us
[2:15:40] are they done downstairs
[2:15:43] okay we'll we'll we'll wrap this up real
[2:15:45] quick
[2:15:48] that you might be partakers of the
[2:15:50] divine nature africa
[2:15:55] having escaped the corruption that is in
[2:15:57] the world through lust
[2:16:02] existing
[2:16:06] wherefore the rather brethren
[2:16:09] give diligence to make your calling and
[2:16:11] election sure
[2:16:31] i got so pointless then it's no longer
[2:16:33] up down up down instead of what about
[2:16:35] what about about but you can take rest
[2:16:38] you can rest
[2:16:40] you have faith in him
[2:16:43] yes we may struggle
[2:16:56] amen thank you lord
[2:17:04] so i hope that we can see that even from
[2:17:05] the beginning
[2:17:08] god had you in his mind
[2:17:11] and throughout this great portrait that
[2:17:13] he is painting
[2:17:16] he had you on his mind
[2:17:18] for your salvation
[2:17:20] all the things that happened throughout
[2:17:21] history
[2:17:23] just for you sit this simply
[2:17:28] if christ had to come again and die all
[2:17:30] over again just for you because
[2:17:33] we would do it just for you
[2:17:36] it's time we quit living below our
[2:17:37] privileges
[2:17:40] but we step
[2:17:42] and we start to take our place as the
[2:17:44] bride of jesus christ
[2:17:48] there's many young people in here yeah
[2:17:50] and we realize we're all at different
[2:17:52] phases
[2:17:53] of the first difference
[2:18:04] if some of you are justified and you're
[2:18:05] in the sanctification phase she said
[2:18:22] to respond
[2:18:36] now we don't have to come up to the
[2:18:38] altar no no
[2:18:39] no
[2:18:40] if you want to
[2:18:41] we can pray for you
[2:18:45] but i believe even in your seat
[2:18:47] lost
[2:18:50] [Music]
[2:19:04] baptisms of water about them do
[2:19:07] in baptisms of the fire of the holy
[2:19:10] ghost
[2:19:12] if you have a desire in your heart
[2:19:16] brother branham said that god wants to
[2:19:17] give it to you probably
[2:19:25] [Music]
[2:19:32] the bottom
[2:19:35] is less than the pressure that god wants
[2:19:36] to give you everyone could a person
[2:19:38] could give up
[2:19:40] think about it that's why he painted
[2:19:42] this picture
[2:19:45] he didn't want to live in paradise all
[2:19:46] by himself
[2:19:49] that he wants a bride
[2:19:52] he wants a beautiful bride
[2:19:54] that's dressed just like he wants it
[2:19:58] that talks just like he wants her to
[2:20:00] talk
[2:20:50] [Music]
[2:21:38] bring them to the redemption
[2:21:42] bring them to the fountain of life
[2:21:45] they might drink of the fountain of ever
[2:21:46] living waters
[2:21:50] lord those that are searching for the
[2:21:51] holy spirit
[2:22:06] your spirit
[2:22:17] [Music]
[2:22:38] [Music]
[2:22:47] before we hear those chains
