[52:21] a.m. uh the Lord has decided to take our
[52:25] precious brother Billy Paul
[52:32] home after a
[52:35] long uh pain with uh fighting
[52:45] cancer again our conges community I
[52:50] think we are we have
[52:54] problems
[52:56] uh before Billy Paul passed
[53:00] away uh there were messages posted
[53:07] everywhere that Billy Paul passed
[53:10] away and I remember that
[53:13] Wednesday pastor called me and say did
[53:17] you hear that Billy Paul passed
[53:23] away I told
[53:25] I did not hear anything I'm going to
[53:31] check I called the secretary at the Bram
[53:37] Tabernacle of course not telling her
[53:40] that I heard Billy Paul passed
[53:45] away I just say sister uh how things
[53:49] going here with a Billy
[53:54] Paul
[53:56] uh she told me just to refer to what has
[53:59] been posted on the official Bram uh
[54:14] website voice of God but as cones it was
[54:19] everywhere Billy Paul Billy Paul Billy
[54:21] Paul but those statute that people want
[54:23] to post to post to post we have to
[54:29] [Music]
[54:35] stop because somebody can pass away in a
[54:38] certain
[54:41] family and they try to manage the
[54:43] situation before they inform certain
[54:46] family
[54:49] [Music]

[55:14] his nephew who passed away in Congo she
[55:16] was not yet
[55:24] informed
[55:27] I think we have
[55:30] problems we have serious
[55:33] problems but as
[55:35] Believers when we identify something
[55:38] that is not
[55:41] right let us make a
[55:45] change amen amen people want to I'm the
[55:49] first one who knew what are you going to
[55:54] receive
[55:59] which is
[56:01] salary minister of
[56:06] information no no so uh brother bil
[56:12] Paul
[56:19] son he has uh gone through a lot of
[56:23] things in his life
[56:27] uh starting with losing his mother at a
[56:31] very early
[56:35] age and uh younger
[56:38] sister and the mother in passing
[56:43] away the mother passing
[56:46] away told Brother
[56:49] Bram take care of
[56:51] Billy since
[56:53] then Billy Paul born September 13
[57:03] 1935 which I memorize because it's 10
[57:06] days after my birthday of
[57:12] course since then brother brother branam
[57:16] was the father and the mother of Billy
[57:23] Paul
[57:25] if there is anyone closer to brother BR
[57:29] Ministry I don't know anybody better
[57:40] than at age 12 Billy Paul saw the angel
[57:44] of the
[57:50] Lord and 145 he smoked a little
[57:53] bit
[57:56] to show that brother whatever you can
[58:01] see who is your
[58:05] dad you have to go through your personal
[58:10] experience and Billy Paul had his own
[58:15] experience with
[58:19] God
[58:21] personally things that I could not
[58:24] understand about the
[58:28] message or I wanted a little bit
[58:33] light I always called Billy
[58:36] Paul he was always always
[58:41] available you leave him a
[58:43] message he's going to call you
[58:49] back this is a big
[58:53] asset
[58:56] AV that we have
[58:59] lost but we could have question about
[59:03] certain things about certain
[59:08] things you call
[59:11] B you will receive
[59:13] help even though they were very very
[59:18] advised uh not to give opinion on the
[59:23] doctrines
[59:25] they will say go to the
[59:28] tape but I remember one
[59:31] time I really push him push him push
[59:36] him because I wanted
[59:39] um to
[59:41] understand how brother Bram managed the
[59:45] finances of the
[59:50] church I told Brother Billy
[59:53] Paul
[59:55] I know you were not only the
[59:59] treasure but you were brother bam
[1:00:02] secretary so you should
[1:00:04] know and he gave me the
[1:00:07] answer finally and I hold it for myself
[1:00:11] I share it with some other
[1:00:14] [Music]
[1:00:16] pastors so that somebody we used to go
[1:00:23] to
[1:00:25] very very
[1:00:27] humble there are people who took
[1:00:29] pictures with Billy Paul
[1:00:33] here uh my mom when she came from Congo

[1:00:38] was H Billy Paul prayed for
[1:00:41] her she felt

[1:00:46] picture he took with Billy
[1:00:50] Paul he was very very
[1:00:53] friendly
[1:00:57] so that's somebody we are going to miss
[1:01:05] greatly and this
[1:01:07] morning in order to pay tribute to
[1:01:12] him uh I want to share with
[1:01:16] you one of his uh healing
[1:01:23] experience cancer took

[1:07:41] this this
[1:07:46] this I don't want to know

[1:08:01] for they are human being like you and
[1:08:05] I they can do
[1:08:07] mistakes don't never focus on their

[1:09:05] that you
[1:09:09] see regardless of the
[1:09:12] mistakes regardless of even the
[1:09:14] differences on in

[1:14:52] your
[1:15:28] done a biopsy when he came back he
[1:15:31] called me there and he said Mr BR I
[1:15:32] can't believe this he says but he said I
[1:15:36] wouldn't even believe it he said but
[1:15:38] we've done 12 biopsies and 10 of them
[1:15:40] was
[1:15:42] positive he said you're completely full
[1:15:44] of
[1:15:47] cancer you say what does that
[1:15:51] mean until they tell you
[1:15:54] you don't know what I'm talking
[1:15:56] about it scared me so bad not that I was
[1:16:00] scared of dying but just scared me so
[1:16:04] bad and I couldn't even move he told my
[1:16:07] boy David he said I've told a lot of
[1:16:08] people that they had cancer he says but
[1:16:11] I've never seen anybody take it as hard
[1:16:13] as your daddy I couldn't move and he
[1:16:15] said I'll go get your wife so he got the
[1:16:17] wife and brought her
[1:16:19] in and anyway he told me you know said
[1:16:22] you know we how long you know how they
[1:16:24] do all that that wasn't what was
[1:16:26] bothering me just I just didn't want to
[1:16:29] go I just didn't just didn't know how to
[1:16:31] accept
[1:16:33] that but you know Satan knows how to
[1:16:35] give you a lie like our brother said
[1:16:37] when he opens his
[1:16:41] mouth but he don't tell you all the
[1:16:43] truth like it tell you about Babe Ruth
[1:16:46] he hit 73 714 home runs but they don't
[1:16:50] tell you that he struck out 13300 times
[1:16:52] either
[1:16:54] so
[1:16:56] anyway I'd been working on a tape up at
[1:16:58] the voice of God and I come out and I
[1:17:00] got on the phone and I called my brother
[1:17:03] and I told him it was pouring down rain
[1:17:05] it was a
[1:17:06] Friday and I I tell you the truth that
[1:17:08] was scared me to death when I come out
[1:17:11] he said bu we'll just keep before the
[1:17:13] Lord so we had prayer and we been to the
[1:17:15] chapel and prayed and I went back up at
[1:17:17] the office and I told my children that
[1:17:19] day I said I don't want you to feel bad
[1:17:21] for d I don't want you to be I want to
[1:17:23] be right up in front with you I said
[1:17:25] with it this bad I said it probably
[1:17:26] won't be wrong it doesn't matter I said
[1:17:30] one moment from here I'm going to be
[1:17:32] where I want to be all my
[1:17:34] life no question about that so I went on
[1:17:37] home and the wife says what are you
[1:17:39] going to do I said I'm going to voice of
[1:17:41] God and she said no don't go up there
[1:17:43] we're they're closed on Friday she said
[1:17:45] don't don't go up there Billy I said
[1:17:46] I've got to I just want to go pray so I
[1:17:49] went in the office and I prayed I come
[1:17:51] back and I turned on the tape I wanted
[1:17:53] to hear a tape I want Daddy I wanted to
[1:17:55] hear daddy say
[1:17:57] something I wanted to hear him pray for
[1:18:00] somebody and say you got prostate
[1:18:03] cancer there was a tape on there that
[1:18:05] I've been working on for several days
[1:18:08] questions and
[1:18:10] answers on the
[1:18:13] seals we came down to the end of it and
[1:18:16] we don't Gap the part where he's in a
[1:18:19] Praying like he says God bless you God
[1:18:21] bless you God bless you so I'd already
[1:18:23] closed the tape off that's all there was
[1:18:27] left and I couldn't find nothing so I
[1:18:30] just pushed the button daddy said God
[1:18:33] bless you Sister God bless you brother
[1:18:35] and he prayed for you know hundreds like
[1:18:37] that and it went on for maybe 20 or 30
[1:18:40] minutes and I turned the tape off and I
[1:18:41] was so
[1:18:43] discouraged then something down inside
