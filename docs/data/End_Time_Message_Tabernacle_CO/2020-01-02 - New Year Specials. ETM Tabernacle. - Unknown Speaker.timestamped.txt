[5:21] of
[5:26] I just want to say thank you to God so
[5:30] this year has been really rough lost six
[5:34] of my childhood friends this year to gun
[5:40] violence
[5:41] I had a cup of teammates I'd played in
[5:44] school with they were murdered as well
[5:50] it made me angry person in our vein but
[5:55] you know after the dedication most
[5:58] importantly when Pastor yoga spoke here
[6:03] about self-assurance Hill about lady
[6:06] last year homes and that really broke
[6:08] the mold for me it's a floppies age
[6:12] because I really closed myself in if
[6:15] estimated on our home family on one man
[6:17] time to conceive me here at church I was
[6:19] really angry I was really tough
[6:22] I was no tough of myself and my mom can
[6:25] tell you my sister could tell you know
[6:28] the kids could even see it and I'm just
[6:30] thankful to still be here and to have a
[6:33] church family that supports me that
[6:34] motivates me to be the best that I can
[6:36] be
[6:37] and think for the pastor because for us
[6:39] it's been 11 years almost I've been in
[6:43] this church since I was 9 years old and
[6:45] she's just always told me to just keep
[6:47] digging to keep digging that was one of
[6:49] my favorite preachings before I left for
[6:51] college and I finally managed to finish
[6:53] school this year I've graduated early
[6:55] and you know my life is on a great path
[6:58] you know to set a future not just for
[7:01] myself but for my sister's kids and for
[7:05] everybody's kids so that we can be an
[7:07] example to look up do I cry because I'm
[7:11] sad it's just it's just the love of God
[7:26] it's just the love of God it's great
[7:28] it's wonderful you know God is good he's
[7:30] always good you know when we travel is
[7:33] it something sometimes we may ask where
[7:35] is he where's Italy but you know when I
[7:38] travel and I go places you know go to
[7:39] play you guys are always in my heart you
[7:41] know I'd do this for you
[7:44] so go ahead and do now is go ahead and
