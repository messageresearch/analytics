[15:26] israel
[15:27] was passing by upon the war they cried
[15:30] the woman
[15:30] unto him saying help my lord
[15:33] o king and he said if the lord do not
[15:37] help thee
[15:38] when shall i help thee i love the bound

[31:13] life that we ever give
[31:14] that has even been given to a man
[31:16] developed to live fastest elephants
[31:21] it is the end time and the contraction
[31:25] history is telling us what we have read
[31:44] find out today there is not so many
[31:46] tales of the history
[31:48] that is written
[31:52] because i don't think it will happen
[31:54] those great events
[31:57] oh go into the blending of everything

[1:25:29] of us done

[1:25:51] well then it will be different i might
[1:25:53] be able
[1:25:54] to stay a month but work on a small
[1:25:57] scale

[1:26:01] radio program
[1:26:02] no nothing else i feel free to go just
[1:26:05] where the lord will let me
[1:26:07] and drop in here and stay a few nights
[1:26:09] over there a few nights
[1:26:11] down near a few nights in a church
[1:26:14] wherever it might be it doesn't matter
[1:26:17] and i don't need nothing but just will
[1:26:19] close
[1:26:20] aware
[1:26:24] and say oh by the way some lady gave me
[1:26:26] a suit of clothes while i was here
[1:26:29] and i sure appreciate that my dear
[1:26:31] friends
[1:26:32] ever it was the lady back in the back
[1:26:36] god bless you it's no no that does
[1:26:40] that's the errors that's a lot of flesh
[1:26:44] for the good shepherd verse six chapter
[1:26:48] paragraph six le bomb belgian good
[1:26:50] shepherd
[1:26:52] fifty seven fifty seven i love six
[1:26:55] second
[1:26:56] fifty-seven okay
[1:27:00] we learn a lot of things by sheep
[1:27:04] if we just notice listen
[1:27:07] we learn a lot of things by sheep
[1:27:10] if we just notice them and watch their
[1:27:13] action
[1:27:14] and a ship is a sacrificial sacrificial
[1:27:18] animal little innocent fellow
[1:27:21] is totally helpless when he's lost i
[1:27:24] think that's why jesus lacking
[1:27:26] us onto sheep because the just can't
[1:27:28] seem to find their way around
[1:27:30] they have to depend on somebody leading
[1:27:32] them
[1:27:33] and they cannot lead one another they
[1:27:36] just won't do it
[1:27:38] and that goes to show me one thing if we
[1:27:40] are lacking to ship in god's heritage
[1:27:43] then we cannot lead one another we are
[1:27:47] helpless we got to depend on the great
[1:27:50] shepherd of the sheep
[1:27:51] yes the lord jesus and i noticed
[1:27:55] at this laundry house once someone was
[1:27:57] speaking to me
[1:27:58] about how this lord of the sheep and
[1:28:01] when they want the sheep to come out of
[1:28:03] the coral and grab the shoots
[1:28:05] where they kill the sheep a god leads
[1:28:08] them up
[1:28:09] there they'll follow the gods
[1:28:12] and this goat will lead them up to the
[1:28:13] place where the killing takes place
[1:28:16] and then it will jump over the side and
[1:28:18] let the ship go right onto their death
[1:28:21] that's just the nature of the goats
[1:28:24] and if a fellow doesn't know his ship
[1:28:26] real well
[1:28:32] listen carefully to about what i'm
[1:28:33] saying it's a goats
[1:28:37] a man in a baby oh it's brain and
[1:28:40] do they slaughter
[1:28:54] that's correct
[1:29:17] [Music]
[1:29:24] as a model as a role model not a model
[1:29:27] our role model is just because he's the
[1:29:29] lord jesus christ
[1:29:51] man or that person like this
[1:29:54] he'll bring him to the slotted house as
[1:29:56] the bible was talking about souvenir
[1:30:00] always remembers the ghosts
[1:30:03] bring the ship to the slaughter house
[1:30:29] okay and i'm gonna talk to you about it
[1:30:32] and i'm gonna talk to you about
[1:30:33] something it doesn't matter to me
[1:30:37] if my shoes along with my pants affect
[1:30:41] my vest
[1:30:41] oh if my pants go along with myself i
[1:30:44] need my experiences
[1:31:03] there is something to match your
[1:31:04] experience with much experience with
[1:31:06] amen i've accepted the poll with witch
[1:31:08] of paul ammon
[1:31:09] amen don't know that's what we need
[1:31:14] today
[1:31:16] it is time to match our experience with
[1:31:18] people of the bible so
[1:31:19] i'm not an example that's our example
