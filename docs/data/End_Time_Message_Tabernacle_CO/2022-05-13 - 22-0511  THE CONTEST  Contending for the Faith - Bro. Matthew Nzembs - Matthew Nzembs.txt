faith contending for faith i believe that we in the days where the contest is in all the fields ultraviolet at work at school puts out the kumba [Music] brought him to fight well would have a connected tactic you have to know your opponent's tactics of your adversary somebody that was a fighter and uh springer has to find it to be as uh they had to know what a feat they were using to be crochet was he using an apricot or are doing uh hulk's elite scale a and what eye does he use i to spare with somebody that was uh that's spied of his opponent when he was uh facing that person he thought that his trainer his coach was hurting him but he was actually preparing him to fight a david angel and david one day he had to face somebody called goliath therefore i'm going to ask for your attention i believe by god's grace please david i would like to speak more about david where my uncle [Music] le combo para gothen f park paragraph at the contest paragraph nine minute foreign like to

minutes in about a 15 minute mpt contest mpt tester a little contest or a little fight i'd like to title the contest and now listen carefully and come back and i like to use this moment to speak about the greatest contest of the tournament is what is taking place between the church and said set the ground the first distance in this great fight of satan de la and we want to speak of the great strength of god in his church now the philistines guarded the armies of tobaro and they guarded her together at sokkov which belonged to judah he'll compare anthrax and pitch between sokkov and seoul and the men of israel gathered together [Music] [Music] coach was uh 5 000. and uh the stuff of his prayer was uh sincerely the fair and his parents had awaited us 600 [Music] [Music] they say that's what the devil tells us describe the message that we are slaves or servants of the message why obey to the message why to and many times the devil doesn't understand that we have a guard he was an overcomer since the mouth of god [Music] you say that i'll fight i challenge them i defy the armies of israel this day versus western illidan you said give me a man in that women may fight together yes when soul and all israel heard that those words of philistine they were dismayed i'm greatly afraid if you notice carefully they didn't say that david was among them in fact some pepper one style once uh soul was with his face they heard that the words of this man goliath the bible said we're afraid la perce now david was the son of ephrathite of bethlehem judah no me izayi whose name was this and he heard sounds and the men went among men and for an old man and the three elder sons of just went and followed solo to the battle and david was the youngest and lost and the three elders who followed so david but david went and returned from saying his father's ship at bethlehem and the philistines drew near mourinho [Music] and presented himself for 40 days imaginable and uh there was nobody that could challenge this man even listen to the awakening now listen to what they had has weapons therefore there was nobody there to challenge you for 40 days morning and night it was really ashamed for the armies of israel [Music] and they take these 10 laws and run to they came to their brethren and carried this 10 cheese onto the captain of the thousand of israel were in the valley of sheila fighting with the philistines therefore the fight that has lasted longer they didn't have any victory at least that's why goliath became a little bit arrogant he started defying the army of israel david silva de bombardier david uh rose up early in the morning elizabeth and left the ship with a keeper just had commanded him and he came to the trench as a host was going to be able to mike and shouted for the battle israel for israel and the philistines army against army and david left his carriage in the hand of the keyboard and they ran into the army and as he talked with them behold they came up the champion the philistine of gath goliath by name out of the armies of the philistines and spake according to the same words and david heard them say jesus and all the men of israel one day when they saw the man fled from him and was so afraid and then the men of israel said have you seen this man je veg and all the men of israel when they saw the men fled from before from him and we're so afraid now listen carefully although i'm the man of israel they were unable to withstand goliath the person can you have to keep trying it you have to try you have to try again [Music] up secretly and you shall be that the king will enrich him with great riches and israel and will give him his daughter and make his father's house free in israel i believe that when david heard that he was happy and david speak to the men that stood by him i believe that he heard that david david speak to them that stood by him that killed this philistines and taken away the reproach from israel and who is this philistine in december it's a second question what shall be done to the men who shall kill them and who is this man he first wanted to be sure about his adversary and he said that this uncircumcised fool answered that it should defy the armies of the living exhaustive sweets these were really insults and the people answered him after this moment to the men that killed him i heard and he didn't just come to see the battle and when the words were heard by looking at small boys [Applause] because of this philistine that thy servant will go and fight with this philistine saudi arabia and saul said to david tina is a youth we got to come ali malee and look at how the devil is very cunning he start by discouraging you people affair you can do it you are just a child [Music] if david wanted to uh probably wouldn't if he had to work with group of people probably you would have nominated me but this is summer demands this world that's my request tonight encourage yourself despite its people for segments despite these people for saying that encourage yourself with faith the faith gives courage amen in the grand person he has overturned if david could compare him he was that man inaudible he wouldn't do nothing physically but you started to show him what he did as a young man overseas [Music] he was mocking david elizabeth he knew that david wouldn't do nothing probably tonight the world might think that you can do nothing hey and he said to and david put them off him secondly that's what the believer has to do allah saul was with those things before goliath david was nothing merigadela picked the shows but look at the worst things he came and gave to david those things the bible says that david tried to walk [Music] and is of simon before any spirit of this world amen amen verse 41 and the philistine came on and drove and the men at that bear they shall wait and when the philistines and so david young and already and they were fair countenance and many times that's what the devil does to us come with that divine situation when you face a good situation you don't know what to do yeah he started uh despising you and the bible says that when goliath looked at david and we cannot he only saw a young man blonde if already [Music] many times that's the good thing to say to the devil situation you're presenting me and all israel shall know that the lord has a god wow this is a great declare statement the whole either assembly will know that the bride has god shall know that the lord saileth not with sword and spear god unto the lord himself the bible says that he fell all upon his face to the earth in other words he was ashamed the challenge he faced at the armies of israel this so david prevailed over the philistine with a sling and smote to the philistines [Music] but there was no sword in the hand the david with and when they feel like he's alive champions were dead they fled me let it be so for your enemies amen and the men of israel and jude arose and shouted out of joy one day you're going to crash out of joy i'll offend the lab at the the [Music] and the children of israel returned from chasing after the philippines and they spoiled the tents la force the strength that they didn't have i caused their number because of a man illusion repeated they got back the carriage and david took the head of the philippines jerusalem and brought it to jerusalem the sign of victory just swept david go forth against the philistines illegita abner the stripling is angel one day legend jiro people will say the kivuset who are you from essentially because the lord god will fight for you versus it verse 57 the world will know your identity [Music] where people have to kill one another how would were they doing it elizabeth they had a record hello people have to stand on both sides to win that's the same way as the devil tried to do illinois he did the devil didn't know who he was challenging since he tell us jesus if he knew who the lord jesus christ was saying he would have even asked for forgiveness before starting but i'm saying in the contesting contending for the faith this is commenting in jude where we just read bieleme beloved [Music] faith that was once delivered onto the saints exactly that was uh actually 33 years after the monday transmission and now it was requested unto them to content for the faith that was once delivered to the sanctions there was a awakening since then for the faith that was once delivered to the saints not for once for the faith and so some of us would think that it's our church that happens i believe that we i hope that we haven't executive but now let's search the scriptures to see if our church is fighting for the faith not at least our church is fighting for the faith and examine our faith by the faith that was once delivered today then if we find out that the like is like i'll find out then we believe that we have the faith that was once delivered let's look the great men of the bible they are the elders the great man of the bible david david samson simpson jonas jonas all determine what you will end up [Applause] [Applause] it was because of the faith the judas for the faith david because david had the faith you look at that day you look at god he was looking listen for this i don't know problem the children of israel are shamed without any help sons exploits without any hope some folks without friends ain't necessarily fair and he did they didn't know what their faith is [Applause] and he will [Applause] the character they will also speak your name will be written somewhere your name would be written upon the rules even where the hell would not take it away and by god's grace your name is written in the book of lies even uh hell cannot take it away jesus and then we'll see what we're talking about jesus christ presented to the world have faith [Music] [Music] of the hour jesus stripped him from everything when he died on calvary california when he died on calvary he let you all [Music] the man singer for me if the the word said that you will be the head in your family if god said that you will remove the shame from your family remove the shame from your family god said that you'll remove the shame from the church you'll remove church they shall shut you up people may like it or not that is written it is predecessor it's got science are you the head of this church it is already written was that like now you have to know how to battle to contest or to content oh man oh my god church [Music] if i see is something that insists on the same thing oh then i say well no there we are now now i see now where we are there are probably a few questions in the church now and now now forget the little questions above it all listen s as long as we believe get juice that's all just because the blood of jesus christ oh my god such a profound this is deep you know if the woman that is saying or the men is sitting if they don't believe that jesus christ oh my oh my god that jesus christ has come back in a physical form foreign even if we do not agree with him single executive on the scriptures memphis on up and celebration but let's have the church move forward forever that's because that's how we are meeting other people mechanically but when the church is not in harmony hello then then we're hurting the church when the church is not in harmony legally we heard in the church despite of your ways of saying things no difference despite our differences harmony but let's walk in harmony then let the lover sit down commute that's when the devil will be cornered against the wall but one of them says in the shows but when we can agree upon them that the blood of jesus christ cleanses us from all right and all when we are under the blood of jesus christ no divergence despite of our differences very important of us despite of our ways of doing things making the suffer but we have to know it no combat in cell cause we just have to contend for one thing and what is the cause i'm a police justice to win the souls to jesus christ there is no salvation outside of the god of heaven does not deal with groups of people in person but it deals only with one person see the video get who are courageous because jesus christ says [Applause] the kingdom of heaven is for the the violence not uh lazy people not the women despite your lobby benji the bible says say tommy my test the men came on morning and evening for 40 days not 40 days today left you look at the time circumcision it's
