[32:59] [Music]
[33:01] then we find that in the in that day
[33:03] that all of the world was going to be
[33:05] destroyed by a flood that God made the
[33:09] preparation I want to tell you God is a
[33:11] just
[33:13] God he's really even the sense of
[33:15] justice he
[33:18] isn't God cannot destroy the unjust and
[33:21] the just at the same
[33:24] time that's the reason why God always
[33:27] made a prep
[33:29] preparation to allow the just to be
[33:35] saved a preparation for what
[33:39] cause to preserve his
[33:43] purpose he did it in the days of
[33:45] Noah and he's doing it today
[33:52] amen he has made the preparation to
[33:54] conserve to his own purpose
[33:58] amen he will conserve a
[34:00] church he will and you are a part of
[34:03] that
[34:04] church he will conserve a

[34:13] God he will conserve subject for his
[34:15] great
[34:17] [Music]
[34:19] domain amen that death cannot
[34:23] destroy you are you are the the subject
[34:26] of God
[34:30] you are sub the subject of God if you
[34:32] can understand
[34:34] it before you were born here on
[34:37] Earth we were in God's thoughts God's
[34:41] mind as
[34:44] attributes for an attribute is a thought
[34:47] that it's not
[34:49] expressed and when God expressed
[34:52] it it becomes a
[34:54] word glory to God thank you Lord
[34:59] God has a purpose for all of
[35:01] us and the purpose of God for
[35:06] us all the power of hell can speak
[35:10] against but they would not be able to
[35:13] Prevail
[35:16] amen all the power of
[35:20] hell oh they can come against the
[35:22] purpose of
[35:24] God that will never Prevail amen
[35:28] because God is
[35:30] powerful God is more
[35:32] powerful glory to
[35:34] God the uh the purpose of
[35:40] God there's somewhere the ability to see
[35:42] the purpose of God it's God himself
[35:49] amen it's the purpose of God to really
[35:53] take care of it so that nothing can
[35:56] Destro the reason why we
[35:59] are that nothing can destroy the purpose

[36:04] God it doesn't depend on me
[36:08] amen it doesn't depend on you yes

[58:17] fulfill what he
[58:21] promised that's why I want to talk about

[1:06:34] Jonah supposed to be someone to talk
[1:06:37] about
[1:06:38] Resurrection it was God's
[1:06:42] plan and that happen again
[1:06:48] today one scripture can have two side of

[1:08:35] and nothing can defeat it my brothers
[1:08:37] let me tell you something as children of
[1:08:43] God because the Covenant that
[1:08:49] God before God has a covenant with ad it
[1:08:53] was a conditional Covenant and
[1:08:57] after God had a covenant with
[1:09:01] Abraham it was an
[1:09:04] Abraham it was an unconditional
[1:09:09] Covenant it's a powerful
[1:09:13] word but you cannot do anything my
[1:09:15] brothers and
[1:09:16] sisters to be lost amen God is
[1:09:21] God God will do everything to save you
[1:09:24] yes sir
[1:09:26] that's the reason
[1:09:27] why when you
[1:09:30] refuse to walk in the right
[1:09:33] direction you will always be
[1:09:36] miserable because
[1:09:40] God he will do everything to save
[1:09:45] you it's an unconditional Covenant yes
[1:09:48] sir it's very powerful but it's the
[1:09:51] truth that's the reason
[1:09:54] why to be sure to be in the
[1:09:58] truth in the right
[1:10:01] way because God cannot lose
[1:10:05] you oh let's take the example of theal
[1:10:08] son there a message prodal
[1:10:13] son good when he was living with his
[1:10:18] parents and then he was actually uh
[1:10:21] eating with all those animals
[1:10:25] he decided to go back to his
[1:10:27] place we have a
[1:10:31] prophet brother said it didn't just
[1:10:34] happen that way just
[1:10:38] ordinary you can you can verify that in
[1:10:41] the
[1:10:43] message
[1:10:47] said the father and the mother of the
[1:10:49] prodal
[1:10:51] son they were praying constantly for the
[1:10:54] their son
[1:10:56] and
[1:10:58] sometime God sent an
[1:11:02] angel brother Braham said it was an
[1:11:04] angel who was giving those advice you
[1:11:07] can verify that in that
[1:11:09] message it was an angel that God
[1:11:13] sent and the angel told
[1:11:16] that don't don't stay in that kind
[1:11:20] of your your father and mother are
[1:11:23] waiting for you
[1:11:26] it's
[1:11:27] actually to go back and your par that's
[1:11:30] the reason
[1:11:33] why you saw that the prodal son got that
[1:11:37] decision because it was
[1:11:39] God's God cannot
[1:11:42] lose he will do
[1:11:44] something to bring him back to the right
[1:11:47] way yes
[1:11:48] sir nothing can hinder you oh hinder
[1:11:52] God's plan amen
[1:11:56] thank you
[1:11:59] Lord I'm going to take two example
[1:12:03] again and the Apostle
[1:12:07] John who wrote the
[1:12:14] [Music]
[1:12:15] Revelation you can look at Revelation
[1:12:20] 4 God has a
[1:12:22] purpose God had a plan
[1:12:26] according to God's
[1:12:28] purpose according to God's
[1:12:32] purpose he wanted to give us the Book of
[1:12:35] Revelation to God in that
[1:12:38] time there a lot of
[1:12:42] persecution and John was the pastor of
[1:12:44] that church glory to
[1:12:47] God when a Time
[1:12:51] came of God to give us the Book of
[1:12:54] Revelation
[1:12:56] in God's
[1:12:58] plan in order to get that book of
[1:13:02] ration the time or the place that
[1:13:05] God God chose was the island of pmos oh
[1:13:10] God is really
[1:13:11] unusual the island of
[1:13:20] pmos criminal it was a island where they
[1:13:23] were sending all those people people who
[1:13:25] were against uh uh who were in trouble
[1:13:29] with the
[1:13:30] law in that zone or that
[1:13:34] place they had so many kind of
[1:13:37] snakes they had
[1:13:41] crocodiles it was not a good place to
[1:13:43] live but in God's
[1:13:47] plan according to God's
[1:13:50] purpose to give us the Book of
[1:13:53] Revelation it was that place God is
[1:13:57] really
[1:13:58] unusual nothing can
[1:14:01] defeat brother and sister if you don't
[1:14:05] understand you even see that Satan is
[1:14:08] not even the because God is more
[1:14:13] powerful for God to go and fulfill his
[1:14:16] plan John was there he was the pastor of
[1:14:20] the
[1:14:21] church God did something one day they

[1:14:27] killing Christians they took
[1:14:32] Dr and they put him in a they put him in
[1:14:36] somewhere and they put oil and they put
[1:14:40] John

[1:14:52] inside Satan thought that he was
[1:14:54] destroyed destroy
[1:14:56] god with
[1:14:57] fire but
[1:15:00] says you have to see the
[1:15:03] oil John the the prophet of
[1:15:06] God he had the Holy
[1:15:10] Spirit and the Holy Spirit is
[1:15:13] fire fire cannot destroy fire and
[1:15:18] contrary the fire
[1:15:21] inside it
[1:15:23] was who created the natural
[1:15:26] fire do you see
[1:15:29] that but it was God's
[1:15:32] plan God
[1:15:34] an he was to give us the Book of
[1:15:37] Revelation while don't see these
[1:15:40] things and then they they labeled
[1:15:43] John they labeled John as a witch and

[1:15:49] him and they put him in the island of
[1:15:52] Patmos
[1:15:55] and he spent two years over
[1:15:58] there in 85 95 after
[1:16:04] Jesus two years where there were
[1:16:06] crocodiles where they had some bad
[1:16:09] snakes you can say what
[1:16:12] happened while John was under
[1:16:15] God's it was God's plan for him to be
[1:16:19] there according to God's
[1:16:22] plan John was supposed to be there
[1:16:25] to receive the
[1:16:26] Revelation so that we can have today the
