[46:36] follows in the mathematic of
[46:39] God all the numbers are
[46:43] perfect but the number

[47:59] prophesied lot went out from Sodom and
[48:03] gorra no went to the
[48:05] ark and Enoch was raptured that's number
[48:09] three it's going to take us to the
[48:12] Rapture or we
[48:15] went all the C and we went to the word
[48:18] of God and it's going to bring us to
[48:21] Heaven

[52:10] things faith hope
[52:15] charity but the greatest of this is
[52:18] Charity now in this
[52:22] message the fundamental Foundation of
[52:24] Faith the prophet says paragraph
[52:27] 1 he said remember last night the human
[52:32] the Revelation the
[52:34] vision now he
[52:37] says this
[52:39] is this is
[52:41] Hope The Human Side he said The Human
[52:44] Side this is
[52:47] hope this is this is
[52:51] Faith the Revelation that's
[52:53] Faith you know that right
[52:57] said ration the faith is
[53:01] revelation and that said the Lord that's
[53:05] charity now listen to what says I don't
[53:08] want to read
[53:11] everything you have you can have faith
[53:13] on on it can happen or
[53:16] not you can have Revelation what says
[53:20] you
[53:22] are if you keep the
[53:24] re once you lose your faith
[53:28] healing will
[53:30] also but said the
[53:33] Lord may you believe it
[53:40] believe it will
[53:43] happen it doesn't doesn't require your
[53:47] faith
[53:49] God and it's going to fulfill
[53:52] it he
[53:54] told that said the Lord
[53:57] that man will see and you know
[53:59] the and the
[54:02] see he says since that man said he lost
[54:06] his he came back brother I lost

[54:51] his sight because it was that said the
[54:52] Lord
[54:54] amen with the revelation
[54:57] it can work or
[55:00] not if you read the the book uh Hebrews
[55:04] chapter
[55:05] 7 first
[55:08] part there's a family that left B
[55:11] Tabernacle the man and his family was

[55:53] and say just leave her alone
[55:58] after all she went to trouble and she
[56:00] had a lot of
[56:01] trouble because she was not well taught
[56:04] the Bible
[56:05] says you will you will you will put your
[56:09] hands on sick and they will beill that's
[56:10] the Revelation because God said in this
[56:14] B it's not all the sick people who going
[56:17] to be
[56:18] healed if said the Lord then it will
[56:22] happen
[56:23] amen now the prophet is going on
