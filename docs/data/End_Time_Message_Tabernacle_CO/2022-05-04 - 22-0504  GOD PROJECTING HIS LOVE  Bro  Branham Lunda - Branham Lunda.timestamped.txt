[35:03] at that time we the one losing amen amen
[35:08] but if we put it all together

[35:23] is here
[35:26] god projecting his love
[35:57] we don't really need all kind of all
[35:59] those things that as we think of amen
[36:01] amen
[36:05] we do not need other things as much as
[36:07] we think
[36:11] all these other things
[36:13] our emotions let down our gifts some
[36:16] melville they are wonderful
[36:20] and to god we give you praise amen no no
[36:22] no it's excluded we're not going to
[36:24] exclude them no longer we thank god for
[36:26] those meh but she said

[36:32] governed or released
[36:36] therefore they're not effective
[36:38] amen
[36:46] [Applause]
[36:52] [Applause]
[37:02] [Applause]
[37:06] that's the reason
[37:28] [Applause]
[37:34] by the
[37:39] [Applause]
[37:54] [Applause]
[37:58] the love has to govern our
[38:01] houses
[38:15] love is the greatest power that has been
[38:17] placed in the hands of man
[38:20] oh i love blood
[38:22] do you love love
[38:24] the love of god
[38:29] a home that's not disciplined by love
[38:31] nepa fy is not as much as the home
[38:36] family
[38:38] if the husband and wife doesn't solely
[38:41] love each other
[38:51] that's why i think that instead of
[38:52] resting our faith upon some emotions
[38:55] which is all right oh sir end or some
[38:58] gift secrets which is still all right
[39:07] that we think of
[39:09] saying
[39:10] that we have the holy ghost when we do
[39:12] these things
[39:13] [Applause]
[39:21] but if we would come back to the
[39:23] principle
[39:24] love first
[39:26] a sweet
[39:38] i think our church will progress a lot
[39:40] faster
[39:48] [Applause]
[39:51] amen the church amen
[39:53] amen the church of god
[40:22] will show you more
[40:50] thinking that we have the
[40:54] [Applause]
[41:02] thinking that this is the evidence of
[41:04] the holy ghost
[41:07] instead of resting our faith
[41:11] i believe we should first seek the love
[41:13] of god
[41:15] where the burnham says
[41:17] if the love of god is in our church
[41:20] notre eglise progresses
[41:23] our church will progress a lot faster
[41:26] and don't return in other words
[41:30] if the love is not in the church
[41:32] which is progressive of the church to
[41:34] progress
[41:36] the church would
[41:37] regret amen the great amen
[41:44] even up to our precious brothers
[42:01] uncertainty if the love is the center in
[42:03] this life
[42:05] the love in myself
