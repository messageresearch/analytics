[14:14] you know
[14:31] this saturday was really difficult for
[14:33] me
[14:36] and i understood by then
[14:41] when they told me about the pastor who

[14:46] they told me about not a servant of god
[14:51] they told me about one man who was
[14:54] healthy he just fall fell and died
[15:04] and started telling me vanity and vanity
[15:07] everything is just vanity
[15:16] you'll see the first chapter the first
[15:18] verse
[15:20] ecclesiastes saying
[15:23] uh
[15:38] vanity of vanities say the preacher
[15:40] vanity of vanities eating all this
[15:43] vanity

[15:52] which he has taken under the sun
[15:54] generation
[15:56] one generation passed away
[15:58] and another one generation coming
[16:01] but the earth abided forever let's go
[16:03] for company

[16:35] top
[16:37] about her
[16:39] few years
[16:40] that generation
[16:44] and the little kids that you would find
[16:46] their way now
[16:48] they now take your
[17:44] certainly
[17:45] you know ecclesiastes it's a book of
[17:48] wisdom

[27:11] say yeah then said the bible in this
[27:14] bible
[27:16] we see david killing somebody he's still
