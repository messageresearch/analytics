[1:06] when i cry unto thee
[1:08] when i lift up my hands toward the holy

[1:27] according to the weakness of their
[1:29] endeavors
[1:31] give them after the work of their hands
[1:34] render to them their desert

[1:40] not the operation of his hands
[1:43] he shall destroy them and now build them
[1:46] up
[1:47] blessed be the lord because he has heard

[1:55] and my shield
[1:57] my heart trusted in him
[1:59] and i am helped therefore

[2:04] and with my son will i praise him
[2:07] the law is the strength and he is the
