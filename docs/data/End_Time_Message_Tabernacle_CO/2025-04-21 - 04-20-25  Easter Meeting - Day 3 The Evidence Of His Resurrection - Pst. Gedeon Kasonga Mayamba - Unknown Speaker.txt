Since you want me to come back, you should wish also him to come to see [Laughter] us. Do you agree? When I need him, you got to send me. May God bless you. Before reading my scripture of this morning, let read uh the rising of the sun. I want us to read paragraph 31. before we take the message of this morning who was here at 6:00. I I already took part of this service in many occasions but this morning was wonderful for me. I thought it was over but he wanted us to come back. I don't know why. While everything was already said, wonderful. Are we ready? Back there. The rising of the sun. Paragraph 31. I wanted to read. Therefore, if God raised up Jesus from the dead, did he raise him up for a memorial? Just a memorial. Just a th and then it's over. resurrection. And this resurrection morning, is it just a certain year day of a year or a certain day that we celebrate this? Or are we beneficiary of his resurrection? What does he mean to me? Resurrection. What does he mean to you? It has to have a meaning for me and for you. Now you believe by faith that he raised from the dead. What has that got to do with me that went 2,000 years ago? What has that got to do with me? That day has to have something with youirect, a direct meaning to you. Amen. Amen. Do you believe it? Then we're going to stand and take Act chapter 1 from verse one to verse three. Luke, the one who wrote this book, the former trees have I done, oh theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach. until the day in which he was taken up after that he through the Holy Ghost had given commandments unto the apostles he had chosen. to whom also he showed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proof being seen of them 40 days again speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God our father our king I commit these scriptures unto your hands as few bread and few fishes that were given to you. Bless them, Father, so that they can feed your people. Let everybody live full and be full of uh basket as testimonies. Anoint us, Father, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for your own glory. Amen. Amen. You may be seated. I would like to speak about the proof of the or the evidence of his resurrection. Amen. Amen. In the two books of uh Luke because there's a gospel of Luke and the the book that he wrote. Those two books I sent to a certain person. He was sending to Theophilus. To Theophilus. Are we together? And to means a friend of God or he that loves God. He sent to you. If you love God, Luke is talking to you. Amen. Amen. Luke start by reminding them that love God the the content of his first for what what Jesus started teaching and insisting by the fact that Jesus was a savior resurrected savior is precising Jesus gave to apostles the evidence that he was alive. Are we together? And the terms alive is the key of success of his the resurrection. Being alive. On Friday the apostles were witnesses of his death. Everybody was witnesses of the death of death of Jesus. But the Sunday morning, they have to go tell people that he was resurrected, the people that saw him dying. They saw him how he was buried. Jesus said, they will be in trouble. I need to give them evidence. Are we still together? They will not just go to say he that died is risen. No. That is why it took care of telling them showing them many evidence that is resurrected. They had to have a convinced evidence. the evident evidence to prove people that saw him dying proving them that he's not dead but is alive. Amen. Amen. They need uh convince evidence or proof of this extraordinary event. We saw that the death of Christ brought us salvation. That was a great thing. When we were speaking of death on Friday, we have the impression that death was enough. But Saturday, we saw that if the the body was not buried, his death wouldn't mean anything because it's when he was buried that our sin were carried away from the sight of God. But this morning, I want to tell you If he was dead and stay in the tomb, his death wouldn't mean anything. It wouldn't be an ordinary death. If you stay in the tomb, even in wouldn't mean anything. What seal everything was the resurrection. Resurrection. The resurrection. prove that he could fulfill what he said. He said, destroy this temple. And in three days, I will rebuild it again. Amen. Amen. And his resurrection was the greatest event. The greatest victory that I ever fought in in this world. It's the resurrection that gives strength to death because even the day many people were dying or are we together when he was buried many were buried with him. You will tell me Lazarus was resurrected but I will tell you he went he died again but Christ since he was resurrected he's alive forever. Amen. Amen. Yes, my brothers and sisters, this is the exact truth. Living. He loved me. Dying, he saved me. Buried, he carried my sin far away. I resurrected. Justify me freely forever. Amen. Amen. living living Christ and the and the message and their eyes all were opened and they recognized him. uh April 57 says this in in virtue of the authority of the word of God and according to what I feel in my soul I declare the same spirit the Holy Spirit is right here in this time in the virtue of the word of God. Amen. Amen. I declare, the same spirit, the Holy Spirit is right here in this side among his people. Are we together now? I declare he's risen from dead. I declare he's alive forever. I declare he's the same yesterday, today and forever, the same in principle, the same in power, the same in everything except his physical [Music] body who is seated in glory in the right hand of God. The Holy Spirit is way here opening working, accomplishing, doing the very exact thing, the work that Jesus was doing when this is the evidence of his resurrection. When the Holy Ghost that he released on the cross comes back in the church and does the same thing That's the evidence that he's resurrected. Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah. Yes, my beloved brothers. It shows us the father. Show us what says our paragraph 18. I'm talking about the evidence of his resurrection. I know I won't be long. I don't even feel like taking long. I look just seeking a place where God will take over and leave the meeting and that will be over. I believe when you can see the power of [Music] God sweeping through a meeting. Are we in a meeting? I repeat, I believe I think when you can see the power of God through a meeting, it means this that Jesus is living somewhere. Hallelujah. It says hallelujah. The same godly ghost power that raised them up on the day of Pentecost and give them the blessing of God. That power is still in existence somewhere when you can see a church that is together with God. Amen. Amen. What a marvelous thing. Amen. Amen. When you see a spirit of God pouring out in the meeting because the spirit of God will pour. Amen. Amen. He was with us this morning. He never left. He's here. I know he's here. And you know that as well. When you see that, that means Jesus Christ is alive. He appeared to them alive. And gave them many evidence that he was a Christ resurrected Christ. Amen. Amen. Yes. My beloved brothers, in the message there, the greatest red flesh, he said the paragraph 96. No matter what the man says. Only what God says that what matters. Are we together? Man still a manipl. No matter how many diploma he has, though he's a prophecy all the specialist he remains a man what it says a man doesn't matter only what God says matter amen tell me it's not a word see where we are look around you and you see how we dying say wake up and shake yourself go back to the Easter exper experience. My prayer this morning, let let Easter not be just coach. Let Easter not be just a teachinger. Let Easter be an experience, an experience, a personal experience. Easter in your heart, Easter in your life. Whatever says, go back to Easter experience of the resurrection, showing that Jesus Christ lives today. He's alive now forever more. He's the same yesterday, today. Amen. Amen. Certain people as if Easter was just a history. Easter is just history. Easter is a living reality. Easter is an experience. Amen. Amen. It's just a me. It's not just a memorial that we have to celebrate. It's not an affair that we saw this morning. Easter is more than that. Easter is the manifestation of the Lord Jesus Christ. Let somebody say with me, amen. Amen. Amen. Easter, the resurrection. It's not a historical affair. It's an experience, a reality. Amen. Amen. And the weakest men of the city says paragraph uh 89 96. He says this, let it be white or black, yellow or brown, poor or rich, slave or free or men and women. God is seeking somebody that will serve him. Let me repeat. letting me black or white, yellow or brown, poor and rich, slave or free, men and women that is looking for a man that will serve him. Why? Because is in need today. Amen. Amen. He needs to be washed. No matter the organization that we got, no matter the man that we are training, the the school that we building, God needs somebody to serve him, somebody that will live a life, somebody that will testify that he got the Holy Ghost to live a clean life. said that's true that someone that can live a life that can produce. Now listen, he needs people that speak of Jesus and then that produce Jesus. God is looking for somebody that speak of Jesus and that can produce Jesus, that manifest Jesus. that's speaking of him and they can manifest it and they can produce it. Not just speaking of him, but you have to produce it because this is the very evidence of his resurrection. Amen. Amen. Yes, my brothers and sisters. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I'm just placing foundation. The expert of faith paragraph 81 second part he says in remembering of our lord Jesus Christ who is risen from dead who standing here among us he's saying among us am us means amand us. Amen. Amen. who standing right now among us manifesting miracles and wonders of his resurrection. The infalluable evidence that is risen from death that is not dead is alive in his church by miracles and pro wonders. Christ is giving infallible evidence that is not a dead Jesus. He's a living Christ this morning. We are not worshiping in history. We are not here in the name of history. We are not here to remember history. But we are here to worship a living one, the resurrected one, the same yesterday, today and forever. [Music] We infallible evidence of his resurrection. I'm speaking about an infallible evidence. I'm not just going to speak of it. The morning of the first Easter when he was risen, he is the only one who gave the evidence that he was resurrected this morning because he's the same yesterday, today, and forever.

Oh ho [Music] he to worship you. Dear heavenly father, we want to be grateful to you. for these wonderful meetings. True Lord. Two Lord. It's two when we say special meetings. It's because you the special God is was present and if you came father we are praying now so that we can see with our own eyes the evidence of your resurrection for which we are beneficiaries. Father, we don't have much word, but we want just to ask one thing for the situation of each one of us that you do something special where each one will remember and say this only can be God. Especially those who have report from the medical doctors. Father, if I can know some cases, you know all the cases. We are inviting you on the scene. It's not important or necessary necessary to talk about the god of history. It's good to lift up people [Music] face. But once the faith has reached the top, it must release the supernatural and let the supernatural be produced and we go from testimony meeting to testimony meeting. Yes, Lord. As the shepherd, I know things that I cannot do. I know what the doctors have declared and have faith. Father, I have seen you when the doctor declared that we could not have children. But today you came on the scene and we can look back. This was only God. But you are not the God of yesterday. You are the same. If you could have done it for one person and the next person who could approach you in the same condition they are here. Father, let the same result [Music] be manifested. [Music] Testimony that has been given, let more to come. I commit them into your hands. And I'm asking again that when the word of God is preached, people may be excited, faith can be boosted. But if it's not maintained to go and continue to testify and believe the same way, the devil will come and rob it. and we will come back to the same condition. I ask Lord that you do something that faith could be maintained until result will be seen. I pray for many cases of sicknesses from the youth to the adults from the babies, teenagers, all ages, father, any disease for which you pay the price on Calvary, let it go. and every sick person to hold on to the promise of healing. Grant it, Lord. And we want to remember that time and confess it. Only God has done it. Bless your servant, the rest of his dream. his family, his churches, his plans keeping keep him in good health so that he can be a blessing if there will be tomorrow and wherever he will be, let him be always a blessing. We pray also for his traveling mercies and also those who came out of state to visit us. Give them their heart desires and bless their trip going back. If there is anyone who is not yet saved, father Let this season bring salvation to their household. We thank you above all the words we could express in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. [Music] [Applause] You may be seated. Uh we want to do a baptism service. If also there is anyone maybe you did not think about taking the Baptist you don't have any schedule. You don't know what tomorrow is reserving for you. The word of God said, I believe in the book of uh Hebrews, I believe, Hebrew 3:15. If you hear his voice, while it is said today, if you will hear his voice, harden not your heart as in the provocation. tomorrow does not believe uh belong to you. And also in the book of Matthew after the disciple walk with Jesus to the end of the supernatural sign he operated. He broke the bread. It was the sign of breaking the seven seals. But that sign he did, he did it before before the crucifixion. You remember Thursday he had communion and Sunday when he resurrected he walked with the disciples and coming somewhere as pastor Gideon was beautifully explained it. He wanted to continue but they hold him master come. When he came, he broke the bread. And that's only one sign reminded the disciple, the sign that was done before crucifixion and that was the thing that opened up their eyes and they recognized that was him. Now in your condition, you know what you have heard. what you have seen him doing for other people. Maybe let another sign be done for you your eyes to open and recognize it him. So after he done this, I'm in Matthew 28 verse 16. [Music] Then the 11 disciples went away into Galilee into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them. And when they saw him, they worshiped him, but some doubted. saying, "All power is given unto me in heaven and in [Music] earth. Go ye therefore and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you. And Lord, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world. Amen. So I want you to notice verse 19. He said, "Go ye therefore and teach all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the father." And I want you to notice the name is singular. You know, after Easter, he gave a commandment to the church. Go ye therefore and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost. [Music] And here you know if you follow the story in the Bible, it was Jesus speaking. He said the name in singular the name that name is valid for the father for the son and for the holy ghost. But he did not disclose that name. And the disciple have to wait until Pentecost when the Holy Ghost fell to understand what that name was. But in the meantime, from the time Jesus spoke these words, no one was ever baptized in the Bible in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost until when the Holy Ghost fall. And then Peter was the first one to tell the people which name that was. And 3,000 people were baptized thereafter. And this is what we see the continuation of the scripture. And today, brother Bam told us don't baptize the people just in the name of Jesus Christ because there are so many people called Jesus. But there is only one who get the name of Jesus Christ and who is the Lord. In other words, who is the boss? And is that in that name that the real baptism need to be performed? So brother and sister take he this opportunity in this uh Easter morning. If you are not ready to consider the water of baptism, if you are questioning about the baptism you have received, don't be ashamed and say, you know, I've been baptized, but I'm not sure which kind of baptism that was. the water is ready. You don't want to cross on the other side and find out that you did not do the right thing. Even if you have been baptized somehow, if the word of God, if God the boss is speaking to you saying you have to reactivate your baptism, Don't hesitate anyone candidate anyone. I'm not pushing anyone but I'm just giving the opportunity. So we have brother Joseph who want to redo his water baptism. I don't know how long he has been baptized but he feel like I have to be do it and uh anyone among us don't just uh say well I'm okay uh if something is speaking to you we have a spare closes so in the meantime though you have already changed musician give us our music I [Music] Oh mercy rule my life hallelujah God's mercy re My love we I should have fallen my soul down by mercy my way mercy Mercy, mercy, oh river my life. Halleluah. God's [Music] mercy re my life. [Music] way I should have fallen. My soul cast down by mercy reward my love. All my hope is in Jesus. [Music] Thank God I go away and all my sins are forgi and I been washed. by the blood. Oh my hope. Oh my hope is in Jesus. My oh thank God the yesterday is [Music] gone and all my sins are forgi and I've been washed by the So we pray dear heavenly father we are performing this service to honor your commandment. We are here with brother Joseph. He want to rededicate his life by renewing his water baptism. you know everything that is in his heart. I pray father that you give him that favor and to fill him with the Holy Spirit to stand and walk closely with you. I commit him into your hands. I pray in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. Brother [Music] Joseph, you want to give your life to the Lord Jesus Christ. Yes sir. You know what came to you and bases based on your uh commitment and your conviction here. I'm baptizing you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Oh, can't you see why I'm so happy? [Music] Oh, have accepted the word of the Lord. Where the referee where thou was [Music] spoken by the prophet of my Amen. Amen. Mothers really they love their babies. [Music] the dad just do it and walk [Music] away. So it's a big responsibility responsibility especially in the country we are living in where America with the children has a lot of problems. Uh sometimes we are so tough on our children but they are the best. Many are in the world reaching just age of 18. Uh they rent their own apartments living with girlfriend, boyfriend, doing anything. It is grace to see you all of you uh serving the Lord. My own personal experience when I came here in America uh more than 30 years ago, the church I was uh going to, I was teaching Sunday school for teenagers. But among all the people for my class, I heard them saying, "Oh, this thing I'm not there. I'm just waiting once I turn 18. I will get my social security card and I go work and done with the church." I was telling the pastor and the parent today there is only one child [Music] who is married who is still in the faith and serving God. When I ask what about this one he is in jail. What about this one? She had uh a certain number of babies and she's in the world brother. A lot of things but we want to appreciate all our young [Music] [Applause] people. Keep it up. Uh we want to be the trophy of the ministry. Amen. Amen. So we are done. Once again I want to thank you all for your sacrifices sacrifice. And there is one person I want to especially [Music] thank is brother Neville for the job he has done with the interpretation. [Music] He was the mouth the mouthpiece for brother Caleb and all those who don't understand our Spanish. So God bless you. Where is Sharon? Where? Oh, go tell Sharon to be to give you a big fufu. God richly bless you. And I believe uh next Sunday, God willing I have another guest speaker. So, I don't know what to do during the week, but uh I want to have a prayer service just to learn how to maintain what we have received. May God richly bless you. [Music] [Music] Ital feeling angry.
