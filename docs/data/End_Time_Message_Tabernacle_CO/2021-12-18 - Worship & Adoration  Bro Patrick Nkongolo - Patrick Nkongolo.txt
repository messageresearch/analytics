========================================

right today begin in genesis genesis means the beginning we find the catholic church in the beginning nimrod the founder we find in the middle of the bible we find kind of bring in women preachers in the beginning of the bible but worshiping little statues made out of roots how many red houses too bad history all right find out in these history they had a woman as you remember even jacob stole his father's god and his daughter hit him and took him out there in the wilderness to file the camp later on all right let's read your not just now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the lord god had made and he said that to the woman as god said ye shall not eat of every tree of the god the woman said unto the serpent we may eat all the fruit of the trees of the guard but all the fruit of the tree in the midst of the garden god has said he shall not eat of him neither shall you touch it lest you die and the serpent said unto the woman he shall not surely and you shall be as gods knowing good and evil see how these fellas and when the woman saw that the tree was good or blue and that it was pleasant to the eye and tree to make to be desired to make one wine she took of the fruit syrup and did eat and gave also to her husband with her and together and made them now there's got to be a beginning of everything you had a beginning now here's where i want to base the whole thing on now we talked about these last two meetings in the year now this morning we went back and dramatized in the bible that when god was making the earth that when he was forming gas and then those gases become calcium potassium and different things he was making he was laying the building out like a great master builder like a contractor laying out his material to build a housing project he was making your body and he had it laying there he knew just exactly in his mind what was going to be done god made that hand before he and going back to the earth god made them he laid it all out in his great blueprint his program now when he went to making the earth he made the man and the man doesn't look just right now creatures of the earth to find out that missing link what it is himself so he made him a health mate tucked her in from the side closed up the gash and made a helmet and man in his spirit was both man and a woman be just to him as part of him that's the reason you have so many scruples in the marriage is because you've got to see some girl with pretty brown eyes or blue eyes or something like that and some pretty figure and you fall far first time she has her first baby them keith comes out and she gets wrinkled and old and then you want to kick her out and some of you women find some little farther than hair sleep down his name is large can't have dumped on it it'll all fall out i know a woman if you have is the woman to your bosom and taken her for your wife and you she makes an imprint on you we'll sit like this so you understand and any other woman against that person down and yet you call it mother daughter slept she's got more morals i have the women of jeffersonville scotland and you call it old and she's not she's a lot more that's true man when he was created god separated his spirit and he took a piece off the man inside and made a woman out of it and then he took the feminist deity something wrong with that when god made a man he made him one thing and he made a woman something else and when god dresses the man he dressed in one with a woman something else and the bible said it's an abomination for a woman that put on a garment that pertains to a man hungary that's right the bible said it's an abomination what's the matter we're going to find out god bless america with a cigarette out of the corner [Music] [Music] guess how
