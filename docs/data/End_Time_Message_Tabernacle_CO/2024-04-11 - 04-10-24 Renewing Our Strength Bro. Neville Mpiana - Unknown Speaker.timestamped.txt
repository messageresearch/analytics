[21:39] today Pastor Peter
[21:43] Chandler pet Chandler from uh London
[21:48] the I know him personally because we
[21:51] preached to one of the convention I
[21:53] think in
[21:57] k
[22:00] today was
[22:03] Wednesday he was in the church office
[22:06] preparing for the
[22:11] service and one of the
[22:14] Asher came and found him
[22:20] dead so what we say he's not
[22:25] dead he has been promoted to Glory
[22:31] amen amen he has a different type of
[22:34] body tonight as we
[22:38] are yeah I think it's uh his daughter
[22:43] who was married by Brother
[22:51] Christian PE to his
[22:54] soul amen amen amen amen this is to say
[22:59] you and I we need to be
[23:04] ready can take your
[23:08] Bible I'm going to meditate for my last
[23:14] sermon or whatever you do work go to the
[23:21] market can be your last
[23:25] ride the last
[23:27] ride
[23:31] each one of
[23:32] us will have a last
[23:35] ride each of our
[23:38] preachers each preacher will have his
[23:41] last
[23:43] sermon so
[23:45] today uh we are going to
[23:48] have um a special
[23:57] speaker
[23:59] it's uh brother
[24:03] Neville who's going to bring the word to
[24:05] us
[24:08] tonight I know that uh he has been here
[24:11] for almost three
[24:16] years but before he came
[24:22] here as uh he was talking to
[24:27] Sharon
[24:29] uh Pastor uh Simon Peter from New York
[24:34] Pastor Sim the New York uh he told me
[24:36] you are going to have a good
[24:43] son-in-law uh I have observed
[24:47] him he has
[24:50] something to preach the
[24:54] gospel but for the last three
[24:57] years
[24:59] uh I have
[25:00] to give the opportunity to myself to see
[25:04] how he is
[25:10] acting and I think I have uh it somebody
[25:14] who really love the
[25:19] Lord uh he does a lot of thing in a
[25:24] secret uh I have seen him many many
[25:27] nights here in the sanctuary praying
[25:34] overnight and uh even the interaction he
[25:38] has with many people among
[25:43] us I think he has a very good testimony
[25:46] as
[25:48] well and the last time Pastor Simon
[25:51] Peter was preaching here at my uh
[25:54] birthday last
[25:57] year
[26:00] uh he was asking him did you start
[26:02] preaching
[26:05] yet he said not
[26:08] yet even the parent uh sister Elise and
[26:15] uh brother
[26:17] Greg they said since his
[26:21] youth they notice he has something for
[26:25] serving the
[26:27] lord a testimony even within the
[26:33] family he is like the pastor of
[26:37] their sisters brothers even
[26:43] parents and then uh tonight I think
[26:46] after many many opportunities I was
[26:49] talking with
[26:52] him he did really impress me in many
[26:57] ways he never come to tell me I have a
[27:03] call but observing the
[27:07] people I noticed
[27:09] that and
[27:12] uh spoke with Pastor Simon
[27:16] Peter say
[27:19] yes but uh you know we are
[27:24] going we are
[27:27] passing we have also to think about
[27:32] tomorrow and I don't think that he's the
[27:34] only one
[27:37] here uh we want to give them the
[27:40] opportunity to
[27:45] expresss and uh the opportunity doesn't
[27:48] make somebody when you preach once that
[27:51] you become uh what we call ordain
[27:55] confirm whatever mean is to know
[28:05] it's just the beginning
[28:07] and it's our job to continue to monitor
[28:11] how you are
[28:16] progressing and uh the monitoring is the
[28:18] key
[28:25] part it's not a guarantee that because I
[28:28] have preached that I become a preacher I
[28:30] can go anywhere no I
[28:34] don't there is a call and there is a
[28:38] time that you have your commission and
[28:42] you come to a certain
[28:47] maturity and the maturity will humble
[28:51] you and uh as you start
[28:57] exercising exercising
[29:00] your you cannot impress people with your
[29:04] preaching on the
[29:10] pulpit but what is more impressing
[29:15] impressing is your life out of the
[29:19] pulpit when there will be some issue
[29:22] where people are arguing fighting
[29:27] disu
[29:31] this is where the ministry will
[29:34] play what is your
[29:37] interaction when people are doing
[29:39] certain bad
[29:41] things how do you
[29:44] react if you is it is he bringing people
[29:48] to the word or he's even diverting
[29:51] people out of the
[29:57] word the things are part of our
[29:59] observation and
[30:03] prayer so without any further
[30:07] delay we are going to bring him to the
[30:09] platform
[30:11] tonight I will ask you to pray for
[30:15] him uh I think all the ministers one day
[30:18] they add their first
[30:22] [Music]
[30:26] sermon it's the most
[30:30] [Music]
[30:31] challenging you have to encourage
[30:34] them and uh let us stand as we bring uh
[30:38] brother Neville Piana to the
[30:43] platform
[30:49] platform

[41:03] here um that brother I think I heard
[41:06] Brother Richard was saying it couple
[41:08] service
[41:12] ago I prefer to sit back there or if
[41:16] possible serving at the
[41:22] back even interpreting I think one time
[41:25] the pastor called me I was sitting there
[41:31] I was trying to run away but the pastor
[41:33] just called me brother n come and help
[41:37] us and if I'm interpreting today I think
[41:40] I was pushed by I had a little push by
[41:42] Brother
[41:46] Martin he will come and even if it was
[41:49] supposed to
[41:51] preach I mean to
[41:53] interpret Brother Martin will just
[41:56] disappear
[41:59] and I I won I didn't have any choice
[42:01] just to come up and
[42:04] interpret so just to tell you like I
[42:06] don't really like to stand
[42:10] here and uh since I'm very blushful
[42:15] person I'm very shy
[42:18] person and I was reading brother bam was
[42:22] talking about brother young Preacher
[42:24] Brother
[42:26] r
[42:28] uh that brother he told Brother every
[42:30] time I stand in front of
[42:35] people uh I can't
[42:37] talk I feel like my my heart is about to
[42:40] come
[42:42] out and brother benam told him you know
[42:46] when you feel like your about your heart
[42:48] is about to come
[42:51] out uh just swallow
[42:53] back and speak in the name of the Lord
[42:57] uh that's why I don't know if there's
[42:59] water
[43:00] here so if I feel like my heart is about
[43:03] to come
[43:05] up I'll take a seep of
[43:09] water I'll swallow
[43:12] back bam
[43:15] advice and I'll speak in the name of the
[43:18] Lord yeah like I was
[43:21] saying I've been running away from this
[43:23] for a long
[43:26] time but you know brother brother bam
[43:29] said The more you run away from
[43:33] it the more trouble you
[43:36] get and he was saying like about talking
[43:39] about
[43:40] Jonah he said
[43:42] Jonah Jonah when God is after
[43:47] you you might as well give
[43:54] up because uh you not let you in
[43:58] peace you'll be more you'll be desperate
[44:01] you'll be more in
[44:03] trouble this is just the little advice I
[44:06] can give to my fellow young
[44:11] people God can trust you with
[44:16] something with a gift with a talent
[44:20] don't try to run away from
[44:23] it because the more you run
[44:25] away the more trouble you
[44:28] get you will never
[44:30] Prosper until you get come back to
[44:33] God the prophet says you might as well
[44:36] just give
[44:40] up you might have
[44:43] ambition no I want to be a basketball
[44:46] player I want to be a big
[44:50] somebody I want to serve I want to do
[44:52] like I want to be an
[44:54] engineer those are good but but until
[44:57] you get back to God and serve
[45:00] him you will not
[45:04] Prosper that's why uh we are here for me
[45:08] it's a way to give
[45:11] up and my wife was telling me a couple
[45:14] weeks
[45:16] ago maybe a lot of problem that you
[45:19] have is because you've been running
[45:22] away and when I spoke with the
[45:25] pastor the pastor asked me told me like
[45:28] I was going to
[45:30] preach I wanted to tell the
[45:33] pastor maybe
[45:36] later I feel like I'm not
[45:39] ready uh but I just like before saying
[45:42] something I just need to
[45:45] pray and
[45:48] until couple days
[45:51] ago uh I was reading I just find a
[45:54] random
[45:55] message
[45:58] uh I couldn't even think like from this
[46:01] message I can get something I was just
[46:03] like let me just read because I was
[46:09] praying and there brother bham was
[46:12] saying uh I think it's the message
[46:18] investment uh I just fell into that b
[46:21] paragra
[46:23] 47 he say if you've got something
[46:27] in your heart for
[46:31] God and you won't express
[46:34] it and so forth and you just keep uh
[46:38] putting it
[46:41] off well later later
[46:45] on and that little desire that you once
[46:50] had to serve God will be taken from
[46:55] you the will come in and steal die away
[47:00] from
[47:02] you then you won't have any desire to
[47:05] serve
[47:07] it I was like God help
[47:10] me I think for me it was a a little
[47:14] sign that it was a
[47:17] time uh therefore that's why we're
[47:20] here and uh that's what I'm counting on
[47:22] your
[47:23] prayers uh it's a big turn
[47:29] I don't know where the Lord will take
[47:32] me but uh I'm just counting on on the
[47:35] grace of
[47:37] God uh the prophet was also saying he
[47:40] was happy to see young people serving
[47:46] God and uh it's always not easy to
[47:50] preach to the family or to stand before
[47:52] the
[47:55] family but I believe they're happy
[47:57] they're so TR to see me standing
[48:03] here and I can see people that saw us
[48:05] growing I can see papa
[48:10] mama they saw us
[48:13] growing our ups and
[48:16] down but seeing us serving the
[48:19] lord I think they should be
[48:23] TR yeah so um I'm just counting on your
[48:28] prayers like I was
[48:30] saying and uh hopefully that you're
[48:34] going to continue to pray for all of us
[48:36] young
[48:38] people do you promise you're going to
[48:40] pray
[48:42] for well just in case you
[48:47] want like one of my friend was
[48:50] saying I made sure I call my two
[48:54] mothers I made sure I call my two
[48:58] mothers I told them I was going to
[49:01] preach I was going to say
[49:04] something and I was counting on the
[49:07] prayers so if you
[49:09] don't I know there's mothers somewhere
[49:12] praying for
[49:13] me know what the prophet say about the
[49:16] praying
[49:20] mothers but I'm sure you all going to
[49:22] pray for
[49:23] me you are my
[49:25] mothers my brothers my
[49:29] fathers and I'm certainly counting on
[49:34] them um I just today I just wanted to
[49:38] just give a little
[49:42] encouragement uh especially after this
[49:45] great time that we had with the
[49:50] Lord uh I've been really uh blessed for
[49:54] couple
[49:55] month
[49:58] you know starting with the the the
[50:00] series of on the blessings and
[50:05] curses like I said it was that time that
[50:08] God gave us a
[50:11] son and then there was a time the pastor
[50:13] was also preaching about the
[50:18] levite and one time I was talking to the
[50:21] pastor I was like this is one of the
[50:23] reason I don't want to
[50:25] preach
[50:28] because there's a lot of responsibility
[50:30] there's a
[50:32] lot I was just given
[50:36] excuses but the pastor told me when you
[50:39] called by God God will take care of
[50:43] it therefore it was really a blessing
[50:46] to to hear all this uh
[50:51] series wow and we had a wonderful Easter
[50:55] meetings with uh man of God brother
[50:59] lunda and brother
[51:01] Richard I was telling Brother Richard I
[51:03] was really
[51:05] blessed and I believe there's something
[51:07] going on in the
[51:10] church something is happening I don't
[51:13] know about you I feel like there's
[51:15] something happening
[51:17] in you just look around
[51:20] you see how God is dealing with the
[51:24] church and you know the same the way the
[51:27] angel told
[51:30] Abraham next
[51:32] year around the same
[51:34] time you will have a
[51:37] son and Elijah said the same thing to
[51:39] the
[51:42] woman next year around the same time you
[51:46] will have a son and I feel like saying
[51:49] the same
[51:51] thing next year around the same time B
[51:56] will be
[51:58] consecrated around the same
[52:01] time God will bless the
[52:03] church testimony will be
[52:06] given that's what I
[52:08] believe amen
[52:10] amen and like I was saying I just going
[52:13] to give a little
[52:16] encouragement uh about renewing our
[52:22] strength in the book of Isaiah where
[52:25] Isaiah where we read
[52:28] every time I say isah my wife said no
[52:30] you you should say
[52:35] Isaiah we African sometime
[52:38] the
[52:43] always so um in the book of
[52:47] Isaiah uh Isaiah was talking to the
[52:49] children of
[52:51] Israel he said uh verse 27 isah
[52:59] 40:27 uh in another uh version they said
[53:03] why would you ever complain oh
[53:10] Jacob saying God has forgotten
[53:14] me he has lost track of
[53:18] me he doesn't care about what happens to
[53:22] [Music]
[53:23] me you can say I've been praying
[53:27] I've been waiting for
[53:29] something it's been
[53:32] years it seems that God have for has
[53:34] forgotten
[53:36] about my
[53:38] claim my
[53:40] prayers my right is pass
[53:45] over no one pays attention to
[53:49] me all
[53:50] alone I lost all my
[53:53] strength so it happens to everybody
[54:00] was why this God you you forgotten about
[54:04] me I'm I'm losing all my
[54:08] strength so losing
[54:11] strength is a part of human
[54:14] life sometime we get to the point where
[54:16] we lose
[54:19] strength no strength to carry
[54:22] on no energy to press
[54:25] on
[54:27] you you just have no strength to to to
[54:30] press through to press through a
[54:36] sickness maybe you've been sick for a
[54:38] long
[54:41] time
[54:43] praying you've been seeing
[54:46] doctors and you get to a point where
[54:48] you're just
[54:49] tired I've seen that with a lot of uh
[54:52] maybe um sick
[54:55] people some sometimes they feel like you
[54:57] know I'm
[54:59] tired Lord just take my
[55:02] life I'm tired I can't
[55:05] continue so this is just it happens to
[55:08] everybody uh struggling sometime to meet
[55:19] hands you're just struggling to to have
[55:22] a stable
[55:23] [Music]
[55:24] job maybe a stable
[55:28] relationship you know for for a preacher
[55:30] or for a
[55:32] pastor sometimes they struggling to see
[55:34] a church
[55:37] Prosper maybe they've been preaching for
[55:39] so
[55:40] long they sacrifying their
[55:43] life but they can't see the church
[55:47] prospering church turning in C
[55:50] Circle and then they get
[55:53] tired they say Lord why this why I can't
[55:56] see my
[55:58] church can't see the thing that
[56:02] preaching be manifested in
[56:05] people you know it's a pressure on the
[56:08] people you know even the pro the prophet
[56:11] said this has no limitation of
[56:16] age it's not because you are young
[56:18] people that you cannot get tired it's
[56:21] not because you're old you cannot get
[56:24] tired it has no limitation
[56:28] no limitation of
[56:32] color it's not because you white
[56:35] or that you can't have
[56:38] pressure so it's it has no limitation of
[56:41] size rich or
[56:44] poor in the message letting off the
[56:49] pressure parag
[56:51] 34 pring
[56:55] may3 the prophet
[56:57] sayet so then I
[57:00] thought I will speak to this
[57:03] congregation why they probably train
[57:09] right maybe that's that's probably the
[57:11] case here you know after this series
[57:14] this
[57:16] teaching really well
[57:18] trained no doubt about it but there's a
[57:22] pressure on the
[57:24] people preach about off the
[57:29] pressure say he has no no age
[57:34] line he has no respect of
[57:38] person it's on the young and
[57:43] old good or bad it's on
[57:47] everybody the
[57:49] pressure you know the the prophet says
[57:51] it happens to
[57:54] anybody no one is spare from it
[57:58] even the prophet
[58:01] job he said one time since he was having
[58:05] a lot of
[58:06] pressure he said Lord I might have just
[58:10] a
[58:12] request if you please just God crush
[58:17] me and then I will lose his hand and
[58:20] come me
[58:23] off it just it was asking God to just
[58:26] cut him
[58:28] off and his wife came
[58:30] along he said just Curse God and
[58:34] die he was tired the prophet job the
[58:39] same thing with
[58:40] Moses they wor Fed Up
[58:44] leaders the Fed Up leader the we leader
[58:47] the the prophet F Prophet F uh he was
[58:52] tired he was facing a lot of complaint
[58:54] from the people
[58:56] after helping
[58:58] people he was tired the people wouldn't
[59:02] be
[59:04] grateful and he said in the book of
[59:07] number chapter
[59:08] 11 he said the burden is too heavy for
[59:13] me if you will treat me like
[59:16] this kill me at
[59:18] once if I find favor in your
[59:21] sight that see I might not see my
[59:25] righteousness
[59:31] he even smoke twice the
[59:34] rock
[59:35] tired so it happens to
[59:39] anybody either you are
[59:41] Prophet or you just a normal person
[59:45] sometime you get to a point where you're
[59:48] tired elah the
[59:50] prophet he ran the Bible said he ran
[59:53] under the jiper
[59:55] tree
[59:57] you know uh the the after bringing the
[1:00:00] fire from the
[1:00:01] heaven the mighty Prophet
[1:00:05] Elijah you know he challenged the
[1:00:08] world but after a while he was sh down
[1:00:11] by a woman
[1:00:15] Jezebel the mighty
[1:00:17] Prophet started running he ran under the
[1:00:20] Jenifer
[1:00:22] tree he started
[1:00:24] dra he started
[1:00:28] crying he said Lord it's
[1:00:31] enough now Lord take my
[1:00:33] life I'm not better than my
[1:00:37] fathers that's what we feel sometimes
[1:00:41] when we have a lot of problems we feel
[1:00:43] like we're not better than
[1:00:46] anybody you know sometimes as young
[1:00:48] people you feel like you know I'm not
[1:00:51] better than my
[1:00:53] friend why Prosper I cannot Pros
[1:00:57] where they can they can they can succeed
[1:01:00] at school I cannot
[1:01:02] succeed I'm not better than
[1:01:05] anybody a young lady can feel like I'm
[1:01:07] not beautiful
[1:01:11] enough that's why maybe I'm not getting
[1:01:13] married nobody's looking at me you know
[1:01:17] I'm not smart
[1:01:19] enough strong
[1:01:20] enough and that you feel like you're
[1:01:24] useless
[1:01:27] everyone makes fun of
[1:01:29] me I can't achieve
[1:01:32] anything that's why I'm encourage your
[1:01:34] father's
[1:01:37] parents please encourage your
[1:01:41] children you don't know why they're
[1:01:43] going through a
[1:01:45] school everybody's probably making fun
[1:01:47] of
[1:01:48] them they think like they they're not
[1:01:51] beautiful enough because they're wearing
[1:01:54] skirt
[1:01:56] but you we should be encouraging
[1:01:59] them telling them they're
[1:02:02] beautiful they're
[1:02:04] smart you know sometime that's why even
[1:02:07] bullying is not
[1:02:13] good you know sometime you know even at
[1:02:17] school you know between
[1:02:19] siblings we bullying each
[1:02:22] other that leads to
[1:02:24] depression
[1:02:27] and that that's why you see like the
[1:02:30] Bible
[1:02:30] says Elijah ran under the Jour
[1:02:34] tree you see some people they isolate
[1:02:39] themselves because they feel like
[1:02:41] they're not
[1:02:43] useful there's no room uh in a Christian
[1:02:47] faith for
[1:02:51] bullying
[1:02:52] people we should be people we should be
[1:02:56] people that uplift
[1:02:59] others encouraging
[1:03:02] others not bringing them
[1:03:04] down don't be the reason someone is
[1:03:07] going through
[1:03:11] depression of someone is going to a
[1:03:18] breakdown that's why I want to tell some
[1:03:21] of our young people
[1:03:24] today God loves you
[1:03:26] you are
[1:03:27] beautiful you are
[1:03:29] smart it doesn't matter what people say
[1:03:32] about
[1:03:33] you what thinks of
[1:03:36] you saw the beauty in
[1:03:38] you saw the value in you why chose you
[1:03:43] he didn't choose them just watch them
[1:03:46] after a couple
[1:03:48] years after taking
[1:03:54] drugs they don't they can't they look
[1:03:56] like
[1:03:58] weird but you look at you after many
[1:04:01] years you know you still a beauty in
[1:04:04] front of
[1:04:05] God undermining
[1:04:11] yourself so that's why the prophet was
[1:04:13] saying
[1:04:14] in the message what
[1:04:18] [Music]
[1:04:21] he paragraph
[1:04:24] 58
[1:04:26] Elijah was on his nerve on the
[1:04:31] age nerves was ready to
[1:04:36] break then he ran under the
[1:04:40] Wilderness so that's what sometimes
[1:04:43] that's what
[1:04:44] happened after a lot of problem a lot of
[1:04:48] Trials you know you being
[1:04:50] attacked you just feel like running
[1:04:53] away you isolate yourself
[1:04:56] I don't want to talk to nobody I just
[1:04:58] want to take my time
[1:05:00] off because you are
[1:05:02] tired so you just I just want to tell
[1:05:05] you you you're not alone you're not the
[1:05:07] first person to feel that
[1:05:10] way the same
[1:05:12] thing the prophet say Elijah went
[1:05:14] through
[1:05:17] depression and the prophet
[1:05:19] says and the the prophet says the
[1:05:22] prophet all that experience of A J Tree
[1:05:27] there many of us find ourself under the
[1:05:30] Jer
[1:05:32] tree I get myself many
[1:05:37] times to a place that you don't know
[1:05:40] what to
[1:05:42] do you're
[1:05:44] frustrated
[1:05:45] frankly I'm right under it right
[1:05:54] now people under the jiper
[1:05:58] tree the prophet said they like to
[1:06:02] sleep sometime you don't feel like
[1:06:04] working
[1:06:06] anymore you just feel like
[1:06:09] sleeping you see when you see somebody
[1:06:11] sometimes
[1:06:13] sleeping too quick to
[1:06:16] judge maybe they're going through a
[1:06:19] lot encourage them sometime they just
[1:06:22] need a little
[1:06:24] encouragement Prophet says they like to
[1:06:27] sleep I preach to more people tired than
[1:06:31] anybody in the
[1:06:34] world so
[1:06:36] tired they went in such a nervous
[1:06:39] [Music]
[1:06:40] condition until they don't know what to
[1:06:44] believe they don't know what they
[1:06:47] want you I realize that today a lot of
[1:06:50] young people leaving the
[1:06:54] message they are tired of being in the
[1:06:57] message feel like we been in the
[1:07:02] message maybe there's no power they feel
[1:07:04] like there's no power there's no this
[1:07:06] there's no that and they are so
[1:07:09] tired they don't know what to
[1:07:13] believe the prophet continues
[1:07:15] saying and then they go to drink it you
[1:07:18] can't drink it
[1:07:20] off you can't drink it
[1:07:24] off
[1:07:29] you can't shut it
[1:07:31] off you see you can you can try to drink
[1:07:34] as as much alcohol you
[1:07:37] want take the depression out of
[1:07:40] you drink it
[1:07:43] off the only thing you
[1:07:46] need no matter how much you
[1:07:49] drink that W help
[1:07:52] you you know the prophet says you could
[1:07:54] take a thousand s and try to sleep it
[1:08:00] off maybe I'll take a
[1:08:03] nap I'll be fine after a
[1:08:06] while no you won't be
[1:08:08] fine you know until you meet
[1:08:11] God then you'll be
[1:08:14] fine oh Elijah the prophet he said oh

[1:08:21] die
[1:08:23] 67 the prophet says I have had those
[1:08:28] feelings you know he said
[1:08:31] 71 sometime I feel like one time put a
[1:08:35] pistol against my
[1:08:39] head to commit
[1:08:42] suicide but I couldn't do it I took my
[1:08:45] glove
[1:08:48] off to lay on the voltage
[1:08:52] line but I couldn't do it something
[1:08:56] still
[1:08:57] held the same God with
[1:09:00] Elijah that same God
[1:09:03] today you might seem to be under the
[1:09:05] jiper
[1:09:06] tree you tired you want to you want take
[1:09:10] away your
[1:09:11] life but as long as if you're child of
[1:09:14] God God will not let you do it the same
[1:09:17] time the same thing the same way all the
[1:09:21] prophet he will ow you
[1:09:24] too
[1:09:26] he see he seen me under the jiper
[1:09:29] tree my wife and baby laying y in the
[1:09:37] grave and
[1:09:38] old I was just about
[1:09:41] gone myself I've laid under the Jer
[1:09:46] tree it's
[1:09:48] hard it's hard to be under the
[1:09:52] Jour you are so tired you feel like
[1:09:56] nobody understands
[1:09:57] you nobody pays attention to
[1:10:00] you you try to explain
[1:10:03] it will get
[1:10:07] it I tried to take a
[1:10:11] gun my brains
[1:10:13] out he wouldn't do
[1:10:16] it you know God wasn't finished with
[1:10:20] me he will always take care of
[1:10:23] you you know you may feel like you
[1:10:27] alone right there under the Jer
[1:10:31] tree God will take care of
[1:10:34] you amen amen so um I was trying to find
[1:10:38] out like what is the causes of the
[1:10:41] reason why people lose
[1:10:47] strength why people lose the
[1:10:50] strength so medically
[1:10:53] speaking uh you can lose
[1:10:56] strength due to
[1:11:00] malnutrition age
[1:11:03] genetics or certain medical
[1:11:07] condition you know
[1:11:09] malnutrition it's it's the fact that
[1:11:11] you're not eating
[1:11:14] well eating
[1:11:17] less or
[1:11:20] overeating still a
[1:11:23] malnutrition you see some sometimes
[1:11:24] that's what happen you know when you eat
[1:11:28] less you feel
[1:11:30] tired because you don't have immune
[1:11:34] system and then you you're so just weak
[1:11:38] and then if you
[1:11:39] overeat you're also going to feel
[1:11:42] weak like the prophets was saying you
[1:11:45] saw people sometime when they come to
[1:11:47] church before coming to
[1:11:51] church that's why you sleep in the
[1:11:54] church you feel
[1:11:56] tired the prophet says because your
[1:11:59] brain I was talking to Mama the other
[1:12:02] day because your your
[1:12:04] blood goes to your
[1:12:07] stomach you know your brain can
[1:12:12] work that's why you feel
[1:12:14] tired but when you have an empty
[1:12:18] stomach cl to your
[1:12:21] brain you can stay focused and the
[1:12:24] prophet says
[1:12:26] That's The Power of
[1:12:29] fasting the reason why we fast god
[1:12:31] sometime Place some of the thing in
[1:12:34] US is to teach us
[1:12:37] something so when when we don't eat we
[1:12:40] fast
[1:12:42] focused you can't eat a lot and
[1:12:46] pray you're just going to feel
[1:12:49] tired you can't pray in that
[1:12:52] way so another reason it's a taste of
[1:13:00] time you know where over
[1:13:03] time you know the more time
[1:13:06] passes you get
[1:13:08] tired you can't you can't stand it no
[1:13:12] more maybe you you were waiting for
[1:13:15] something but since it's taking so
[1:13:19] long you move on to another
[1:13:23] thing I'm just going to go quickly
[1:13:26] at old age you lose strength because of
[1:13:29] old
[1:13:31] age
[1:13:33] trials can make you
[1:13:36] lose you know that you feel like you you
[1:13:39] over you over
[1:13:46] tried you feel like the TR is too
[1:13:50] much remember God
[1:13:53] says he will not tempt you
[1:13:57] what you can
[1:14:01] end there's no trials that above
[1:14:05] you another reason it's a lot of attack
[1:14:09] from the
[1:14:10] devil it's like in the
[1:14:14] boxing the more attack you receive the
[1:14:16] more punches you
[1:14:18] receive the weaker you
[1:14:21] get so the best way to stay strong
[1:14:26] is to avoid as much punches as you
[1:14:30] can that's why there was the prophet was
[1:14:33] saying I want to teach you to be
[1:14:36] soldiers so you can
[1:14:39] avoid as much punches as you
[1:14:43] can being
[1:14:45] touched you know sometime we feel like
[1:14:48] everybody saying things against us you
[1:14:51] can't control what people say
[1:14:54] about what you can
[1:14:56] control it's how it affects
[1:15:00] you if you let what people say about you
[1:15:03] affect
[1:15:06] you that's why you become
[1:15:09] weak you feel like you know in this
[1:15:12] church they always talk about
[1:15:15] me uh you know they always say things
[1:15:17] about
[1:15:18] me I'm tired of going to that church
[1:15:22] because you're letting what people say
[1:15:24] affects you
[1:15:26] you cannot control what they
[1:15:28] say you cannot control how the enemy is
[1:15:33] punching you just have to learn how to
[1:15:36] dodge
[1:15:38] punches amen
[1:15:42] amen another reason it's
[1:15:46] Sin Sin wears you
[1:15:50] out in the book of PSM chapter
[1:15:53] 32
[1:15:57] verse the Bible says when I refuse to
[1:16:00] confess my
[1:16:03] sin my body wasted
[1:16:07] away I grown all day
[1:16:16] long you see like when you have
[1:16:20] sin you feel
[1:16:22] tired because that guilt
[1:16:26] is heating you
[1:16:28] up the only way to
[1:16:32] help is to confess
[1:16:35] it there's a little story I read
[1:16:39] somewhere there was a a girl it was she
[1:16:42] was very smart
[1:16:44] [Music]
[1:16:45] girl she she she she was raising the
[1:16:49] nice
[1:16:51] family and she went to school she met
[1:16:55] she met a
[1:16:57] friend and they became best
[1:16:59] friend and one day her friend came to
[1:17:03] her and said I I have a secret to tell
[1:17:06] you but promised me
[1:17:08] first that you're not going to tell
[1:17:11] nobody and she said yeah I promise I'm
[1:17:15] going I'm not going to keep your
[1:17:17] secret
[1:17:19] well I killed my
[1:17:22] dad she couldn't believe it
[1:17:25] she thought the friend was
[1:17:28] lying because the dad just died there
[1:17:31] was an
[1:17:33] investigation and then the lady just
[1:17:36] confessed to that
[1:17:40] girl killed her
[1:17:43] dad and then since she already promised
[1:17:45] to her
[1:17:46] friend that she will not tell nobody she
[1:17:49] had to keep that
[1:17:53] guilt and then she she was very smart
[1:17:56] getting all the grade A and
[1:18:01] school all of a
[1:18:03] sudden they starting seeing a great
[1:18:09] dropping she couldn't focus no
[1:18:12] more she couldn't pay
[1:18:14] attention she couldn't
[1:18:16] sleep and then she went after while she
[1:18:19] went to
[1:18:21] drug the parents couldn't understand
[1:18:23] what's going on
[1:18:26] and then after while they took her
[1:18:28] somewhere and then she was really at the
[1:18:31] end had to confess it once she confessed
[1:18:36] it free so you see
[1:18:41] Guilt can hit you can destroy
[1:18:44] you only reason for
[1:18:47] you to get out of it is to
[1:18:51] confess sometime people you feel like
[1:18:54] you don't you don't feel like
[1:18:56] praying because there's a sin somewhere
[1:18:58] in your life you trying to keep it but
[1:19:02] don't try to keep it confess it and God
[1:19:06] says Come Ye unto
[1:19:09] me he have every
[1:19:12] Laden I give you rest confess lay down
[1:19:17] everything take my
[1:19:19] yoke my yoke is
[1:19:21] easy you know sometime we keep things
[1:19:24] that we don't have to keep
[1:19:27] it
[1:19:29] that but the prophet says God can save
[1:19:33] the vest of
[1:19:36] Sinners no matter what you have
[1:19:39] done confess it don't keep it in your
[1:19:43] heart the prophet says sin will take you
[1:19:45] further than you can
[1:19:48] imagine come back and confess
[1:19:51] it you can move on but the more you keep
[1:19:55] it that's why you drawing
[1:19:58] it you can't walk you you can't even
[1:20:01] pray because your your your mind your
[1:20:04] conscience is
[1:20:06] guilty amen amen but as we
[1:20:11] read the Bible
[1:20:13] says they that wait upon the
[1:20:16] Lord shall renew the
[1:20:19] strength but how can I renew my
[1:20:21] strength I can I renew my strength
[1:20:25] watch the
[1:20:26] ego that the ego the Bible say even
[1:20:29] David and Isaiah they're saying the same
[1:20:33] thing they're talking about the E you
[1:20:36] know what happened what other eego does
[1:20:39] the ego you knew his
[1:20:42] strength how when the eag gets
[1:20:46] old there's a crust over his
[1:20:53] face there's a over his face he can't
[1:20:57] see no more he can't fly no more he
[1:21:00] can't do nothing because he's dying he's
[1:21:04] getting old he can't do nothing but this
[1:21:09] only his only
[1:21:13] help is to find a
[1:21:17] rock even if he getting old he's
[1:21:19] [Music]
[1:21:20] dying he will say I would have my life
[1:21:25] ride I have my last
[1:21:28] flight I will fly for maybe the last
[1:21:32] time find the rock
[1:21:34] somewhere and when he finds The Rock he
[1:21:38] will start beating his head against The
[1:21:41] Rock beit his head against The
[1:21:44] Rock but we have a
[1:21:46] rock we have a rock in the r
[1:21:49] land the Rock of Ages that was C to us
[1:21:54] the only thing we have to do is to find
[1:21:57] the rock if you feel like you're tired
[1:22:01] tonight you can't find the
[1:22:03] rock just come there's a rock in the
[1:22:08] land amen amen that's why what the
[1:22:10] prophet was saying he's getting
[1:22:13] old he can't walk no more he can't fly
[1:22:17] no more sometimes you feel like you
[1:22:19] can't read the Bible no
[1:22:21] more tired you can't pray no
[1:22:23] more you can't you can't live a
[1:22:25] Christian Life no more you're
[1:22:28] tired in the message letting off the
[1:22:33] pressure the prophet says I know a
[1:22:37] rock amen amen a rock that the can beat
[1:22:42] his
[1:22:47] head himself in
[1:22:51] prayer till all the crust of the world

[1:22:57] the sh of is broke
[1:23:04] loose a man can beat himself in
[1:23:08] prayer that still every sin shle is
[1:23:11] broke away from
[1:23:13] him I know where a prostitute can beat
[1:23:17] till become
[1:23:20] Ladi I know where
[1:23:23] drunker
[1:23:25] can beat till they become
[1:23:28] God of God I know
[1:23:31] Rock that Rock is Christ

[1:24:05] Rock pray that's why Prayer Changes
[1:24:09] Things prayer is the
[1:24:11] key if you are
[1:24:14] desperate you are going through
[1:24:18] depression if you
[1:24:21] sick
[1:24:23] sad you can't take it no
[1:24:27] more you know you you you want you want

[1:24:42] for your wife pray for your children
[1:24:45] pray without
[1:24:47] season the prophet says Christian don't
[1:24:51] realize the power
[1:24:54] strength they have when they pray prayer
[1:24:59] is the key prayer is the
[1:25:02] answer prayer is the
[1:25:05] most powerful
[1:25:07] weapon that was ever put in the control
[1:25:10] of the human
[1:25:12] being no atomic
[1:25:15] bomb hydrogen
[1:25:17] bomb powerful as
[1:25:20] prayer prayer will change the mind of
[1:25:23] God
[1:25:24] you know you may think God say something
[1:25:26] about
[1:25:29] me maybe because I've
[1:25:31] sin since the Bible says the wage of
[1:25:35] sin is death but when you
[1:25:39] pray I can change the mind of God there
[1:25:42] there was a king
[1:25:45] ezekiah God sent the prophet to tell
[1:25:49] him but he prayed he prayed and his
[1:25:53] prayer
[1:25:54] change that say the
[1:25:56] Lord your prayer can change the mind of
[1:26:00] God
[1:26:01] Amen brother says he gave us the
[1:26:05] strongest
[1:26:06] weapon the reason all the
[1:26:09] world that's prayer prayer changes
[1:26:13] things the Christian doesn't
[1:26:16] realize what force we are talking about
[1:26:19] renewing our
[1:26:21] strength chran doesn't realize the power
[1:26:25] they have when they pray when you kneel
[1:26:30] down before your almighty God but what
[1:26:34] is a
[1:26:35] weapon without a
[1:26:38] bullet what is a
[1:26:40] weapon without a bullet a weapon without
[1:26:44] a bullet is a
[1:26:47] toy a weapon without a bullet it's
[1:26:52] useless a prayer
[1:26:55] without the name of
[1:26:57] Jesus it's useless
[1:27:00] noise the prayer without the name of
[1:27:04] Jesus it's a tinkling
[1:27:13] symbols the prayer without the name of
[1:27:16] Jesus Remember
[1:27:19] David had a
[1:27:23] slingshot
[1:27:25] but without the
[1:27:27] stones it was useless and the prophet
[1:27:31] says five
[1:27:33] stones are the name of
[1:27:36] Jesus saw the prayer use the name of
[1:27:40] Jesus the prophet went
[1:27:43] somewhere there was a woman they were
[1:27:45] practicing
[1:27:48] spiritualism the power of
[1:27:51] demon they they had a table that was
[1:27:53] hanging
[1:27:58] and they were challenging
[1:28:00] people who will bring that table
[1:28:03] down and they they call out Four Strong
[1:28:06] young
[1:28:08] men they tried to pull that table
[1:28:12] down the prophet say they fell
[1:28:15] down they couldn't do it but they call
[1:28:19] they told the prophet you call yourself
[1:28:21] you're a man of
[1:28:22] God do something
[1:28:24] and the prophet came and he said table
[1:28:29] in the name of the
[1:28:31] church
[1:28:33] fall nothing happen in the name of the
[1:28:36] big
[1:28:38] Pastor nothing happen in the name of
[1:28:42] this nothing happen but once he
[1:28:46] said
[1:28:48] table in the name of the Lord
[1:28:53] Jesus just the table
[1:28:56] fell but it
[1:28:58] crushed so I feel like this
[1:29:01] evening disease if you have a problem
[1:29:04] hanging just come in
[1:29:07] prayer in the name of Jesus that table
[1:29:10] will
[1:29:11] fall that disease will fall that problem
[1:29:15] will fall no matter how hard it is no
[1:29:18] matter how impossible it is just speak
[1:29:21] the name of
[1:29:22] Jesus the name of Jesus can change
[1:29:25] anything the name of Jesus can bring
[1:29:27] life to
[1:29:30] life amen what a powerful name we
[1:29:34] have the prophet says I'm going to close
[1:29:38] here prayer changes death to
[1:29:43] life you know I realize in the message
[1:29:47] sometime we don't pray too
[1:29:49] much
[1:29:51] denominational they pray a lot sometimes
[1:29:54] they have intense night of
[1:29:57] prayer Jesus all his life is was about
[1:30:01] prayer he said the secret that I have my
[1:30:04] of my
[1:30:06] Ministry it's because of prayer and we
[1:30:10] don't pray now
[1:30:12] denominational they pray because and
[1:30:15] they don't have the
[1:30:18] word and Jesus said if my words abide in
[1:30:22] you then you can
[1:30:25] pray you cannot pray without the
[1:30:28] word but we have the word but we don't
[1:30:31] pray what a
[1:30:33] tragedy we should be the people that
[1:30:36] pray too
[1:30:37] much the tragedy of
[1:30:39] today it's not unanswered
[1:30:44] prayers it's unoffered
[1:30:49] prayers we don't offer
[1:30:52] prayers we don't
[1:30:55] pray and We complain that God doesn't
[1:30:57] answer pray and brother says pray until
[1:31:02] God
[1:31:03] answers if he doesn't answer stay there
[1:31:07] until he answers your prayer I'm not
[1:31:10] going to leave here until you answer my
[1:31:13] prayer don't content yourself with a
[1:31:15] half
[1:31:19] answer I think brother brother Richard
[1:31:21] was saying it sometime you pray you are
[1:31:25] asking for big things and after a while
[1:31:28] since you're getting tired you're trying
[1:31:30] to bargain your
[1:31:32] prayer maybe you asking for

[1:31:37] give

[1:31:41] it uh 5,000 don't bur your
[1:31:47] prayer possible ask big

[1:33:38] be
[1:33:40] done I don't want to do it I want
[1:33:43] another person to do
[1:33:45] it when the other person will do
[1:33:48] it then I will find
[1:33:51] mistakes then I can criticize but to

[1:33:56] another especially when we get to that
