opportunity to speak with you this morning appreciate the songs and the musicians thank you character musicians and uh if you have your scriptures i'd like to just kind of dive into the the word right away and i'm still young i get nervous so if i'm going too fast just raise your hand and say slow down slow down amen if you would turn with me in your scriptures to romans chapter 8. we'll take a very familiar scripture to the message believers and we'll be talking about rapture i was listening to a message this morning and brother brandon was talking about how many people don't like talking about the end times to them it's something scary it's something that's unknown there's mysteries about it oh yeah for the bride it's a happy time we believe that this morning romans chapter 8. we're gonna read verses one through eleven and it reads like this there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for the love the spirit is life in christ jesus for the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus hath made me free from sin free from the law of sin and death and what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh god sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the flesh i continued that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit i thank you like jesus exists here completely unknown for they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit song for to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace because the cardinal in mind is enmity to because the carnal in mind is enmity against god for it is not subject to the law of god neither indeed can be but you are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that that spirit of god dwell in you now if any man have not the spirit of christ he is none of his messiah and if christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness but if the spirit of him that raiseth up jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you is your gracious heavenly father lord we come before you this morning and once again lord just thanking you for your goodness and your mercy lord you look down and you see that we're all humans but lord we've gathered ourselves together today with a purpose the minister's job is to help the christians to go grow closer to you and those that aren't christians to make them so ashamed of themselves lord that's why we're here this morning lord we might be able to read these scriptures as they pertain to us today we ask all these things in jesus christ's name in the morning amen amen amen you may be seated again we just want to say thank you to brother fosten for the opportunity to come we understand that he's uh going to a funeral out in new york or somewhere out there but as the scriptures say we don't weep as others that weep amen so here we are a couple days into 2021 oh newborns many of us are very thankful that 2020 is in the past year in the year of forgetfulness amen it was a hard year for many i lost many people when it becomes midnight on january 1. we hear that saying new year new me or as we but now we have our our new name of jesus christ [Music] the scripture says that change will come by his spirit amen and we know that there is a rapture coming for his church and we know that brother branham talks about that change that rapture will come in the seventh age i want to talk about three main points this morning so amen amen so brother branham talks uh lots and lots about the seventh church and uh he says in the message rapture he don't miss out on level in december 4 65. so he says now we're living in the seventh church and when the bible said that the seventh church age the city of the legalized when the messenger of that seventh church age begins to sound his message economy is such a system that actually that the mysteries of all these things that's been twisted up the son of man coming among his people and doing just exactly confirming his message as he said he would do it and we find it in this last stage amen so we know that that satan can see where where we are satan satan knows that his time is drawing sure so he's doing everything he can distract us he's doing everything he can to try to draw you away from galaxies last year was such a great example the government shutting down churches saying you can't gather together in the name of the lord yeah and they can do it under the facade of a virus safety of it all you can't come to church we see many churches across the land even message because there was seed that was thrown out some fell on rocks fell on good grief we believe that we have good grief prepared for us even from the beginning don't come to church sanji pani vine pali gliso or just listening to tapes at home or by yourself but it says draw yourselves forsake not the assembling together more so as you see who got quiet there for a second amen praise the lord did you start away so god so satan can see what god is doing and he will try to distract us oh we see all the political unrest that's going on right now satan trying to divide believers financially amen brother branham says in the uh flashing red light of his coming up he talks about how we're getting ready to get on a train we don't know buy a bag of peanuts he said when you see that flashing red light when you see that arm coming down then you know that the train is in the block you know that he is close and he'll be showing up not is but blessed are the messages amen you can find that in the scriptures foreign brother branham says this is 63 june 20 23rd uh and when the arm goes down and the light begins to flash okay he said what is it the train it's in the blocks though you can't [Music] train you better throw that bag of peanuts down i love the vegetables you grab your suitcase and you get ready or you're gonna be left and he starts with uh verse 26 and this is jesus speaking it comes and he says as it as it was in the days of noah eddie so shall it be also in the days of the son of man they did eat they drank they married wives they were given in marriage until the day that noah entered into the ark even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed amen amen so it took us a profit to show us we're in the seventh age hello where god will show his prophets the things to come [Music] so without this message we wouldn't be able to look at what's happening around the world without this message we wouldn't be able to see that flashing red light amen the prophet then takes us down to matthew 24. our holy prophet news amen and he talks about how the disciples asked jesus three questions and it's incredible to me that when you are listening to the message when he's going through the scriptures he says the disciples asked him three questions and jesus answered their three questions in order but when you go back and you read the scriptures and then he jumps all the way to verse 32. jesus is answering all these questions you see the denominations are blinded to those things it shows but god sent a prophet to show us those things amen god's so merciful to us that's pretty exciting my lord is matthew 24 verse 3 and as he jesus sat at the mount of olives the disciples came into him privately saying number one premier tell us when these things shall be dino constitutes number two what shall be the sign of thy coming and number three and of the end of the world three questions and then brother branham flips us all the way down to uh verse 32 oversight where jesus says now learn a parable of the fig trees and he says that israel is that fig amen when his branch is yet tender a [Music] this generation shall not pass tell those things be fulfilled we've already seen israel gathered in her homeland we see that the sleeping giant of russia getting ready the king of the no getting preparing herself brother branham talks about god has a bride and she's getting herself ready satan also has a bride satoshi is getting herself ready so when you see that other bride is getting herself you better watch it and he says verse 37 but as in the days of noah no way so shall also the coming of the son of man be and sister and then the prophet takes us all the way back to genesis chapter six if you listen to all of those just kind of one after the other and then the president gets uh assassinated the catholic president he never finishes his turn it's almost as if god passed time and now here we are again today we've got a catholic presence we've got a so-called goddess as vice president and we have have the catholic church building up a business organization that the catholic church would be behind it all don't don't fear communism control the the money of the world the jews think they do they stay on the paper it is only rome has the goal i love that's true okay so now we see rome the catholic church making a deal with the jewish and what don't get distracted by all these things little does he know he's playing right into the hand [Music] because my scripture says that in the last days there shall be overcomers well if everything went smooth if everything went smoothly what would there be to overcome alone so there must be obstacles covered so that's the bride can become overcomers [Applause] so brother branham takes us back to genesis chapter 6 and he says and it came to pass saw the daughters of men that they were fair violence and they took them wives of all which they chose and uh let's go to verse four oh hello and there were giants in the earth in those days and also after that when the sons of god came in and to the daughters of men did you feel they knew that they bore children unto them the same became mighty men since you feel like which were of all the jadiso men of renown now i want you to notice something remarkable was six chapters why would god say these three or four things because he knew that you saw who would be looking for the sign of his coming so he had when we start seeing the things happening here mankind is duplicating at a rate just as it was in the days of november just comes with you don't you know way it's so simple but yet it took a prophet to take us back to the world number one and the sons of god saw the daughters of men that they were fairly he said they can't hold a candle to the the the girls in high schools these days they they can't compare uh to the girls in in just school oh they feed them the women just keep getting prettier and prettier just as it was in the days of knowledge and it says in verse 4 and the sons of god came in unto the daughters of men when the sons of god came in unto the daughters of god are the daughters now it's starting to be come to the place where people don't even think it's important to get married i've heard people tell me what's the point of getting married you can live together with viva you can raise a family why get married just as it was in the days of noah amen so multiplying upon the earth women getting prettier and prettier and the sexual uncleanness [Music] brother branham says in uh paragraph 128 of flashing red light of course he says now something else i had wrote down remember lot's two daughters yes we remember that down in the city of sodom jesus said here in luke 17 he said as it was in the days of sodom remember that men had misused women in such a way jesus until the natural act of life was no more desired he says oh it's awful to say this from from the platform but if and it's so bad today tell there's tens of thousands times thousands of them because the natural use of human life to reproduce themselves upon the earth has been so mistreated and so gone on in the way it has you'll probably go to jail if you go down to downtown denver and start preaching against it doesn't the scripture say that what we call good will be they'll call bad bones it's not hate speech preaching against this love speech because love is correct there's young people today dealing with homosexual spirits inside message it's not juvenile we're getting the people nervous in the congregation and start preaching what god thinks it's his word anyways we're not here to preach what we think amen praise the lord amen so we see as it was in the days of noah in voyage and we can see ourselves in that day and so amen there's an enoch yeah and anoka enoch was the seventh from adam and now amen you can read that in genesis 5 and 6. that the six generations before [Music] ages before they all died in the denomination their message was preached and they denominated but this seventh age mess brother branham says in the rapture he says now it's the seventh age that takes the rapture all the other six died but enoch was translated all the rest of them don't hate them all he said but the end time bride will be called out the rapturing love more without death amen so can we all agree we're in the seventh church we're at the end times so there will be a rapture it's been promised amen so i amen i believe i'm looking at people [Music] amen it took a profit to say that this this translation this rapture for the bride the rapture will only be for the british and we'll get into this a little bit deeper from there but you must realize that it's it's the bride that gets herself ready if we think of a marriage and and the bride is is is waiting in anticipation for that wedding and the wedding day finally comes what does she do okay lay on the couch and yes as soon as i see the the the ceremony starts oh there because if you wait till the the side the the literal train is there then by the time you run across the street to the to the entrance it's gone along [Music] but the bride gets herself ready she doesn't wait for the preacher to get her ready for somebody else she's waiting she's got the dress picked out monsters verses and i heard as it were a great voice of a great multitude israel coming for din full numbers and the voice of many waters a community console and as the voice of many thunderings saying hallelujah hallelujah for the lord god omnipotent let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb is come in and his wife have made herself ready it's a farm and to her it was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linens for the fine linen is the righteousness of the saints the son of jesus is their son and he sayeth unto me right blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb still on that have already and he says unto me these are the true sayings of god so who brought this message to them let's find out and he said unto me see thou do it not. for i am thy fellow servants that have the testimony of jesus worship god for the testimony of jesus is the spirit amen amen but we can uh can look back in in matthew 25. and he gives a parable of the 10 virgins you must have oil there's the story of that young man from chicago he comes here to colorado up in the mountains what was he doing he was looking for a bride were there not girls in chicago oh yeah there were well but that wasn't what he was looking at a bunch of the other girls just like they were in chicago chicago but he found one she was doing all the slave labor she had the same last name brother branham said as those other five girls they were they were daughters of the manager [Music] they felt like they had part ownership of this big ranch yes [Music] [Music] there was someone that was living the life that christ wanted somebody that had the characteristics that he was looking for amen amen but she was doing all the dirty work mad visit to citra so he comes and and he says i will be back in a year did she quit washing the dishes did she quit doing the laundry to her it didn't a year from now enough where it says we will be heirs and i'll try to move on here pretty quickly all right so we know we're in the seventh page you know there's a rapture coming up all right let's talk about taking the rapture first thessalonians chapter 4. verse 13 it says but i would not have you ignorant brethren concerning them which are asleep that ye sorrow not even as others that have no hopes for if we believe that jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in jesus will god bring with him now with this scripture keep in mind matthew 27. in fact let's let's let's flip there real quick and we'll read it oh don't know much [Music] and it says jesus when he had cried again with a loud voice yielded up the ghosts and behold the veil of the temple was rent and twain from the top to the bottom and the earthquake and the earth did quake and the rocks rent rant [Music] and this this gets very deep we won't we'll we'll just hit the highlight [Music] and the graves were opened and many bodies of the saints which slept arose and they came out of the graves after his resurrection that they went with him with with jesus in that rapture okay so here we are in uh first thessalonians and uh verse 14. for if we believe that jesus died and rose again even so them which sleep in jesus will god bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain until the coming of the lord jesus christ shall not prevent the brain says that word prevent means [Music] the resurrection of the dead and then the rapture yeah for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout out with the voice of the archangel and the dead in christ shall rise first then hello we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord oh that's me right there that's you right there in the scriptures thousands of years ago because he thought so much of you so that that that phrase to be caught up it means to cease or to carry off by force oh it's transported by fox it's to claim as one's self eagerly to claim for oneself eagerly so [Music] that's the same voice he said as that cried to lazarus lazarus and if he wouldn't have specifically called lazarus he's come forward then the resurrection would have happened back there it's that same voice it's incredible that the prophet can can pull these things old testament new testaments so we remember what happened about lazarus we could preach a sermon upon sermon about lazarus and how it was that same mary memory just after lazarus raises from the dead it's that same mary that washes jesus and here's all those pharisees if you actually knew what kind of woman and they're sitting there condemning [Music] [Music] christ raised her brother from the dead and here's those pharisees condemning him that's for another time but but jesus says in john 5 28 maybe he says marvel not at this you see for the hour is coming in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice isn't that interesting it doesn't say the graves shall hear his shout our nest all right so we've got the the shout the voice and then the trumpet the trumpet is the feast of trumpets or the lamb supper brothers and brother branham says in that in same uh rapture message and he says and when the bride is being called out how are you going to put it out come on it's the revelation of the manifestation of the word made truth manifestations those are a lot of big words in there okay it's the revelation of the manifestation of this word made true modern events made clear by problems then the next paragraph or the next uh sentence he says and we are living in that day praise be to god the revelation of the mystery of himself he says indeed the rapture is what we're talking about it's only for the bride remember the bible said and the rest of the dead lived not for a thousand years [Music] this great rapture if there's not a rapture friends where are we at what are we going to do because i don't fail what age are we living in what promise do we have there's going to be a rapture the bible says there will be only for the elective [Music] amen hallelujah so we know there's going to be a rapture in this age it's so clear it's been prophesied not only the last 50 years but for thousands of years so if there's going to be a rapture how do we know we're going to be in that rapture it's not a guessing game god doesn't just i'll take this one just randomly god takes his own he's coming for a bride one that he loves one that will be flesh of his flesh corinthians 12 and quran tenduzo by one spirit were all baptized into this body doesn't sell espionage but disappear for women said quote one holy spirit baptism doesn't sell by them that if you want to put that down first corinthians 12 13. and by one spirit we're all baptized i want to say and the spirit of the life of christ amen which he was the word seed brings the seed to life do you get it if that life is laying in the seed then the baptism of the holy spirit is upon it it is bound to bring that seed light see lava forks so we can imagine those seven church ages coming up first it's two blades uh poking out of the ground and then it starts to grow we have the stock alonso toothless castle tassel or the uh where the seed the where what that produces the seeds oh it is amen and then we then then we can see the seedlings let's go back and read first corinthians 12 13. and then we'll uh we'll have one more uh one more quote and then we'll we'll try to wrap it up first corinthians 12 and 13. for by one spirit we are all baptized into one body whether we be jews or gentiles whether we be [Music] now if you're just reading this bible with no profit and we've been made to drink into one spirit and we want to say what is he talking about he's talking about that seed gene of god inside now here's here's something that i found very interesting look up that word baptized and there's two words that are very similar the clearest example that shows the meaning of baptism for example is actually uh from a greek poet and physician um his name was uh nikander says he lived about 200 years before christ and he actually wrote a recipe for pickles [Music] and he uses both of these words in that recipe this would be says in order to make a pickle in the kendrick on the fells vegetable should first be dipped as in bapto [Music] into boiling water and then it must be baptized as in baptism in the vinegar solution both of these verbs concern immersing the vegetables in a solution [Music] so when it's used in the new testament the word often refers to a a union or an identification with christ amen do we believe that so for example mark 16 16. for example he that believes and is baptized shall be saved christ is saying it's more it's it's it's more than just an intellectual ascent chris intellectual but it's a union with him okay so we have a cucumber alonso who here likes pickles there's all kinds of pickles there's sweet pickles there's dill pickles right we're making a pickles you have to start with a cucumber you have to boil that cucumber so you dip that cucumber in the boiling water then you take the cucumber out i love recipe is it a pickle especially this is not it's [Music] changed they're still a cucumber they're looking to be dipped in water thinking that they'll be changed but the problem is their nature has not been changed amen are you with me so we've still got a cucumber it's boiled down it's a soggy cucumber [Music] brother brandon said you can have the holy spirit every day of your life and still go to health statements what is he talking about he's talking about an anointing [Music] but it's not a change the nature of that cucumber begins to change it goes back to a cucumber so once you're born a son of god you can't become a cucumber his nature has changed so baptized means completely so it's not he that believes and is baptized dipped in water but it's here that is baptized completely changed but is a complete but we have jesus's blood flowing within us is so we can't help but take the [Music] but when the body moves the entirety of the body [Music] that arm is not a part of us it's attached to us so it can get the benefits of us but it's still not [Music] and and how it produces oranges but you can graft in other fruits you see these denominations are grafting in to this fruit everywhere i lost v but it is not producing the same fruit and what does the bible say by their fruits now if that branch let's say the lemon branch [Music] so it doesn't matter if you're first baptist oh science facility second baptist design baptista but if that tree ever puts forth a new branch if that tree ever puts forth a new branch it will produce the original fruits and in the last days there shall be a church rise up and it will write another book of acts just like it was in the beginning amen hallelujah that praise the lord so we've been completely changed we're not covered by his name this is some complete motion but his blood now flows through us but you must be filled with the holy spirit and when it comes to an oh glory i got the anointing oh glory oh god just rewind and he says and it's the genuine anointing remember and he prophesied so did balaam have it hello unless that's god's seed amen amen so it must be god's life living in us inside us now you can say to that mountain be moved now you can have that thing why because it's not us that's difficult but it is now christ living in us nothing in our fleshly ability but it is christ in us everything so we're looking for that wedding that little cousin that was waiting for that that man from chicago to come back all those sisters were always making fun of her oh he's just like all these other guys he's just making fun of him you're not pretty enough what did she do make us cafe she kept getting herself ready she was getting herself ready she was getting herself dressed as sabi he should be here any moment we should be getting ourselves ready looking for that wrap up [Music] who's coming out we must get into christ amanda we believe that this morning let's all stand up [Applause] i just thank god for his message [Music] because just reading through the scriptures there's no way that we would understand what he's telling us but his brother branham gave the illustration when he would write letters to his wife and when she would write letters back to him he said i can see these words between the lines young people that didn't live with brother brown we don't have to read this message as it was yesterday in the 40s 50s 60s so we can apply it to 2021 because we how blessed we are amen amen let's let's bow our heads dear gracious heavenly father because you've passed our days lord we just come before you once again lord when we look at ourselves we just see faults and failures [Music] lord and the prophet told us what justified men justified means that we've never done it in the first place as your prophet said how are you going to forgive someone that's never done something wrong when we are called up in that rapture your holy spirit living in us not just an anointing that will take us in a rapture the prophet said the prophet the [Music] lord we just ask if there's anyone here that's not sure if they have the holy spirit that they would make themselves sure this morning if there's any questions that they could just reach out to you this this morning and then you would just give them the holy spirit lord that you would change their nature not have the old sin nature a new nature but that we would have your nature that our desires would be your desire [Music] it's [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] amen amen [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] can we say this lord if this day is the day of the rapture do it remember [Music] is the rapture would you please remember me don't miss it [Music] you [Music] tried and true [Music] me [Music] for you [Music] [Applause] [Music] flies [Music] me [Music] that's great [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] oh
