========================================

[Music] I stood on the banks on the wide raging River try I'd get across and I made my way through some valleys and deserts believing that I'd never get lost I've been at the foot of what feel like M Everest knowing i' have Str for the cloud but through every trial it's chest and Temptation one thing is sure every time over and over again and again God is faithful over and over again and again and through it all he's made me aable to stand and survive to come through aive when it sure look like I couldn't win Jesus is with me so I claim the victory over and over again [Music] yeah if you ask me why I have no hesitation God does what he says he will do and that's pleas say every battle has taught me there's nothing he won't help me [Music] through so why should I dwell on the hardships and struggles when Beyond them I look and I see the way this will end is with great celebration and deep in my heart I believe over and over again and again God is faithful over and over again and again through it all you made me aable to stand and survive to come through aive when it should look like I couldn't wi Jesus is with me so I claim the victory over and over [Music] again over and over again and again God is faithful over and over again and again through it all he's made me aable to stand and survive to come through alive when it sure look like I couldn't win Jes Jesus is with me so I claim the victory over and over over and over over and over again [Music]
