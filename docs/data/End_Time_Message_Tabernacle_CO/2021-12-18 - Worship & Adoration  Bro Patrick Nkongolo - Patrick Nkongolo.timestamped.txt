[0:00] right today begin in genesis
[0:03] genesis means the beginning
[0:07] we find the catholic church in the
[0:08] beginning
[0:11] nimrod the founder
[0:13] we find in the middle of the bible
[0:16] we find kind of bring in women preachers
[0:18] in the beginning of the bible
[0:20] but worshiping little statues made out
[0:22] of roots
[0:24] how many red houses too bad
[0:26] history
[0:28] all right
[0:29] find out
[0:30] in these history they had a woman as you
[0:33] remember even jacob stole his father's
[0:36] god
[0:37] and his daughter hit him
[0:40] and took him out there in the wilderness
[0:41] to file the camp later on
[0:45] all right let's read your not just
[0:48] now the serpent was more subtle than any
[0:51] beast of the field which the lord god
[0:54] had made and he said that to the woman
[0:57] as god said ye shall not eat of every
[1:00] tree of the god
[1:02] the woman said unto the serpent we may
[1:05] eat all the fruit of the trees of the
[1:07] guard
[1:10] but all the fruit of the tree in the
[1:12] midst of the garden
[1:13] god has said he shall not eat of him
[1:16] neither shall you touch it
[1:19] lest you die
[1:21] and the serpent said unto the woman he
[1:23] shall not surely
[1:33] and you shall be as gods
[1:36] knowing
[1:37] good and evil
[1:38] see how these fellas
[1:52] and when the woman saw that the tree was
[1:54] good or blue and that it was pleasant to
[1:57] the eye
[1:58] and tree to make to be desired to make
[2:01] one wine
[2:02] she took of the fruit syrup and did eat
[2:04] and gave also to her husband with her
[2:06] and
[2:17] together
[2:19] and made them
[2:25] now there's got to be a beginning of
[2:27] everything
[2:29] you had a beginning now here's where i
[2:31] want to base the whole thing on now we
[2:33] talked about these last two meetings in
[2:35] the year
[2:37] now this morning we went back and
[2:40] dramatized in the bible
[2:42] that when god was making the earth
[2:45] that when he was forming gas
[2:47] and then those gases become calcium
[2:50] potassium and different things he was
[2:54] making
[2:56] he was laying the building out like a
[2:59] great master builder like a contractor
[3:01] laying out his material to build a
[3:02] housing project
[3:04] he was making your body
[3:07] and he had it laying there
[3:08] he knew just exactly in his mind what
[3:11] was going to be done
[3:14] god made that hand before he
[3:31] and going back to the earth
[3:33] god made them
[3:34] he laid it all out in his great
[3:36] blueprint his program
[3:38] now when he went to making the earth he
[3:40] made the man
[3:41] and the man doesn't look just right now
[3:57] creatures of the earth
[4:13] to find out that missing link
[4:16] what it is
[4:41] himself so he made him a health mate
[4:44] tucked her in from the side closed up
[4:46] the gash and made a helmet
[4:48] and
[4:49] man in his spirit
[4:51] was both man
[4:53] and a woman
[5:09] be just to him as part of him
[5:12] that's the reason you have so many
[5:14] scruples in the marriage
[5:16] is because you've got to see some girl
[5:18] with pretty brown eyes or blue eyes or
[5:20] something like that and some pretty
[5:21] figure and you fall far
[5:23] first time she has her first baby them
[5:25] keith comes out and she gets wrinkled
[5:27] and old and then you want to kick her
[5:28] out
[5:29] and some of you women find some little
[5:30] farther than hair sleep down his name is
[5:33] large can't have dumped on it
[5:35] it'll all fall out i know
[5:47] a woman
[5:51] if you have is the woman to your bosom
[5:53] and taken her for your wife and you she
[5:56] makes an imprint on you we'll sit like
[5:58] this so you understand and any other
[6:01] woman against that person
[6:32] down and yet you call it mother daughter
[6:34] slept
[6:37] she's got more morals i have the women
[6:39] of jeffersonville scotland
[6:42] and you call it old
[6:45] and she's not she's a lot more
[6:59] that's true
[7:15] man when he was created god separated
[7:18] his spirit
[7:20] and he took a piece off the man inside
[7:23] and made a woman out of it
[7:26] and then he took the feminist deity
[7:54] something wrong with that
[8:22] when god made a man he made him one
[8:23] thing and he made a woman something else
[8:26] and when god dresses the man he dressed
[8:28] in one with a woman something else
[8:30] and the bible said it's an abomination
[8:32] for a woman that put on a garment that
[8:34] pertains to a man
[8:52] hungary
[9:04] that's right the bible said it's an
[9:05] abomination

[9:20] out

[9:38] of the corner
