[28:50] [Music]
[29:02] starting from Verse 18 come on
[29:07] Jeremiah 8.
[29:19] when
[29:21] when I would comfort myself against the
[29:24] soul my heart is faint in me
[29:31] oh my consolations
[29:35] behold the voice of the guy of the
[29:38] daughter of my people because of them
[29:41] that dwell in a far country is not the
[29:46] Lord in Zion is not her King in her why
[29:51] have they provoked me to anger with
[29:54] their graven images and weave strange
[29:57] vanities
[30:15] this summer is ended and we are not safe
[30:23] for the hurt of the daughter of my
[30:26] people am I hurt

[30:33] Me

[30:46] there no physician there why then is not
[30:49] the health of the daughter of my people
[30:52] recovery applications
[31:05] Lord are the blessing to them
[31:12] this is a question
[31:15] and I believe sometimes as Believers we
[31:19] have also questions
[31:26] why this is
[31:30] taking place
[31:42] I was here he preached it was a sermon
[31:45] several times
[31:48] but my thoughts tonight
[31:52] is to give to help somebody find the
[31:56] answer to this question is
[32:04] there no bomb in Gillette
[32:09] is there no physician there yeah
[32:14] is there no promise in the Bible about
[32:17] Divine Healing yeah
[32:21] is there no prophet in the last days
[32:29] your condition is still important
[32:32] conditioning to you why
[32:35] there is no answer
[32:37] in the message
[32:40] there is no answer in the Bible
[32:44] don't you read the message
[32:57] and I believe you the answer
[33:01] should be with each one of us the event
[33:04] connection
[33:10] as we move forward
[33:13] we have questions from time to time the
[33:16] communication detention even the little
[33:19] kids namely pleasure
[33:21] was telling a story of a little kids
[33:26] she was afraid when he goes to the
[33:29] bedroom to sleep
[33:32] and especially when it was raining it is
[33:36] there was lightnings
[33:41] and he put a blanket over
[33:44] the mom I'm not comfortable
[33:52] are the kids
[33:56] and the mother wanted to go
[34:00] I'm gonna pray for
[34:02] people and then God will be with you
[34:04] the baby said
[34:06] I don't want that invisible guys
[34:14] shame amen amen and sometimes as
[34:17] Believers we don't want to talk about
[34:20] imaginary guide
[34:22] but you want to talk about a god who's
[34:27] lead the present tense of God not God
[34:31] all you
[34:32] know when I came to the message
[34:35] I was on fire
[34:37] yes but where is that fire where is that
[34:42] God was it you now you are sometimes in
[34:44] big difficulties
[34:47] [Music]
[35:01] said in this message
[35:12] he starts talking about the Prophet
[35:14] Jeremiah
[35:17] foreign
[35:23] [Music]
[35:42] 14.
[35:56] of the same message
[36:00] [Music]
[36:01] then why is the daughter of my people so
[36:05] sick what's gonna feed them on purpose
[36:07] in my life isn't there a physician there
[36:10] to minister this is
[36:14] to minister this
[36:16] foreign
[36:56] foreign
[37:33] bless the Lord O my soul and all that is
[37:37] within me bless His holy name is
[37:45] bless the Lord O my soul and forget not
[37:49] all his benefits
[37:54] amen
[37:57] give us
[38:02] of thy diseases in the department
[38:10] he is the Lord who heals all your Jesus
[38:18] so therefore there is no disease
[38:21] for which there is
[38:28] so when the Prophet Jeremiah
[38:30] [Music]
[38:32] was speaking to the people of Israel
[38:36] it was the time that Israel
[38:39] beautiful sake God
[38:43] and that was the time the trouble was
[38:46] set in the
[38:47] Lord
[38:49] and one of the daughter was sick
[38:53] the question was
[38:56] why why why
[38:58] because if you eat the entire chapter of
[39:03] Germany
[39:04] before we get to the conclusion of verse
[39:07] 22.
[39:09] you will notice that it was really a
[39:12] time where
[39:22] and I'm not about the daughter of the
[39:26] Goddess people
[39:29] The Zone but I'm talking about you and I
[39:33] tonight
[39:37] why my prayers are not answers
[39:42] why my petition or my requests don't
[39:46] find Solutions
[39:50] I have said so many prayers
[39:54] but it seems like some of those prayers
[39:58] there is no answer
[40:01] and I'm going to ask to ask where is God
[40:11] because he never changed
[40:14] yesterday today and forever
[40:28] there is another person
[40:30] coming under the same circumstances
[40:33] under the same conditions
[40:38] [Music]
[40:40] God is under obligation
[40:44] to give the solution
[40:50] the problem is
[40:52] the problem is
[40:55] why
[41:14] [Music]
[41:16] coming back to the message
[41:22] [Music]
[41:27] [Music]
[41:41] the conditions
[41:43] [Music]
[41:44] with the condition of the people in the
[41:47] church
[41:50] they are they have the medicine is on
[41:52] the medicama they have the perfect they
[41:56] have the Bible they have everything they
[41:58] don't do but why there is no solution
[42:05] is going to tell us
[42:10] today yeah it's just like this
[42:13] circumcision
[42:15] a man dying on the door steps of of a a
[42:20] doctor's office enormous
[42:26] experience
[42:42] and you know the doctors
[42:44] I don't see that here usually but in the
[42:48] Congo
[42:49] medical doctors the doctor they have a
[42:52] sign his own thing of the separate you
[42:55] say boom
[43:03] they get that from the Bible
[43:08] showing that in the Bible
[43:11] when the children of Israel said God is
[43:16] a serpent
[43:18] is only under the disappointed and once
[43:21] you are beaten by the serpent do you
[43:24] said multiple you don't need to
[43:26] go to the hospital
[43:27] you are just to turn your look
[43:31] at the judge the serpenters
[43:46] regardless of your sickness
[43:48] if you come to my office
[43:54] [Music]
[43:58] doctors in the world can do that see the
[44:01] doctor don't remove
[44:02] how much more the doctor in the
[44:06] spirituality the greatest
[44:09] regular medicine
[44:10] the compassionate Jesus
[44:19] [Music]
[44:30] I have a
[44:32] ble to hear
[44:34] and today he was hungry whether we can
[44:36] give many testimonies
[44:39] of many many cases
[44:48] and when God heals he comes you again
[44:51] it's a perfect it's a buffet
[44:54] my own mother here my papa mama is he
[44:56] she came here about 18 years or 19 years
[44:59] ago
[45:01] this is
[45:08] one of the biggest killers
[45:13] again
[45:15] what a world in the back
[45:18] he had cancer on the news
[45:22] God healed him again
[45:26] through prayer all the cancer dried out
[45:32] we don't have a god of History
[45:35] we have a living God
[45:39] which case God cannot resolve this is
[45:46] the hardest cases
[46:10] two people
[46:13] they don't ever maybe what if it is
[46:18] but they ever born to fall for children
[46:25] you don't you cannot lie to me
[46:30] the only thing is
[46:34] still alive
[46:36] but let us ask ourselves
[46:39] which kind of approach we are taking
[46:41] against
[46:43] Holy Ghost
[47:03] also for you
[47:09] foreign
[47:19] [Music]
[47:36] [Music]
[47:45] deliver
[47:46] y
[47:48] bondage of a certain Spirits please
[48:01] [Music]
[48:05] the woman
[48:13] is more than able to set you free agents
[48:24] is there no problem
[48:27] there is no Prophet yes
[48:31] he's not the
[48:37] going back
[48:46] he said you know there's the people
[48:49] today
[48:50] it's just like this circumcision
[48:52] a man dying on the step of
[48:57] a doctor
[49:00] is
[49:05] the cure for his disease
[49:09] foreign
[49:17] you know when you do you see the doctor
[49:21] they give you a prescription
[49:23] prescription
[49:25] the dosage must be correct
[49:33] if you take more
[49:35] it can damage your kidneys
[49:40] if you don't take enough
[49:43] they don't kill the bacterials
[49:47] and that's the reason why is
[49:50] medically speaking
[49:52] they when they do medical research
[49:56] they
[49:59] don't rush and try it on human being
[50:05] because it can have side effects
[50:15] they try on the animals
[50:18] they study the dosage
[50:21] if it works
[50:23] then we know it's gonna work
[50:26] but the medicine we are talking about
[50:28] tonight
[50:34] they try it on their own human beings
[50:51] and he came back
[50:54] [Applause]
[50:56] into working celebration
[50:59] destroy this body
[51:01] every three days
[51:07] [Music]
[51:17] that's why he made this statement
[51:26] he said
[51:29] Isaiah 55 century
[51:41] but he was wounded for our transcription
[52:07] do you already
[52:14] to get your Solutions
[52:25] [Music]
[52:57] [Music]
[53:02] but if he refuses refused take his
[53:05] medicine
[53:08] he will die on the doorstep
[53:26] because he has done everything for you
[53:32] but now where is the problem is that
[53:36] with the prescription
[53:40] prepared
[53:46] [Music]
[53:56] they will be baptized
[54:02] that prescription
[54:18] you can take that question
[54:22] you are foreign
[55:02] stubborn to take him along
[55:06] and the problem is using the word
[55:10] you can go see the best physician here
[55:13] in
[55:14] America
[55:16] he gave you the prescription
[55:20] but the doctor May the doctor will not
[55:23] come to your home
[55:25] to say in the morning
[55:28] unless you are in intensive care units
[55:30] so you don't understand
[55:34] unconscious that he will

[58:03] spiritual applications

[1:16:03] a chicken bigger massage no I just shoot
[1:16:06] it up
[1:16:08] even innocent who will die
[1:16:12] but there are so many things God has
[1:16:14] done in our life
[1:16:19] showing that he cares
[1:16:21] and at the stage of the journey
[1:16:24] God is still caring for you he wanted to
[1:16:28] be filled
[1:16:30] amen amen whatever what I'm saying
[1:16:36] [Music]
[1:16:40] unless the world repents
[1:16:45] and confession
[1:16:47] is what the world needs
[1:16:49] names
[1:16:50] his honest confessions
[1:16:53] that's what we cover on Sundays
[1:16:56] and we are going to go forward now
[1:17:03] but
[1:17:05] if you get you did your confession
[1:17:10] God is at the obligation to heal you is
[1:17:14] an obligation to field
[1:17:17] and the obligation to do anything that
[1:17:20] your heart is
[1:17:24] like medicine for disease
[1:17:32] what kind of medicine it is
[1:17:36] and what disease
[1:17:45] I'm going to apply that light to the
[1:17:49] Bible
[1:17:59] just read in the directions
[1:18:15] he used to be in this church
[1:18:18] I was a Sunday School teacher
[1:18:21] back home I have read the Bible from the
[1:18:26] beginning
[1:18:32] so that was just knowledge unless it is
[1:19:04] instead of each episode
[1:19:11] in our case we don't take what the
[1:19:15] remedy says
[1:19:29] sincerely and you are making sure
[1:19:33] there is
[1:20:03] response
[1:20:07] the trouble is that in our case
[1:20:10] we don't take the remedy what the Emily
[1:20:15] says
[1:20:26] we we got the remedies
[1:20:29] they do notice all his Capital was
[1:20:36] they do notice his Capital
[1:20:39] which remedies
[1:20:41] we got the remedies
[1:20:43] but we won't take it
[1:20:47] and you say it also
[1:20:51] you see it with the capital
[1:20:54] look I think I thank God as much as good
[1:20:57] we say we do
[1:20:59] because we can read it
[1:21:02] but to really take it hello
[1:21:06] hello
[1:21:09] but to really take it we don't do it
[1:21:15] the gospel is the same way
[1:21:20] in this case
[1:21:25] if they're patient
[1:21:29] and the rest the family has been proven
[1:21:32] to cure the patience
[1:21:35] and a patient is all about the discovery
[1:21:38] of this drug is
[1:21:43] and they know every ounce of medicine
[1:21:46] that is
[1:21:53] the scientist name that found this
[1:21:55] certain black International
[1:22:01] vaccine and so forth
[1:22:05] if we know only worry about it you know
[1:22:09] but refuse to take it
[1:22:19] 77.
[1:22:21] and then how we say
[1:22:24] but we took it and if you say you took
[1:22:28] it is
[1:22:37] now we are talking about results
