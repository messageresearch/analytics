[2:30] after the water bricks
[2:32] serpenteth my soul after thee o God
[2:35] my soul turneth for God

[2:40] When shall I come and appear before God
[2:43] my tears have been my meat day and night
[2:47] while they continually say unto me where
[2:50] is thy God
[2:52] when I remember these things I poured
[2:55] out my soul in me
[2:57] for I had gone with the multitude I went
[3:00] with them to the house of God with the
[3:03] voice of joy and praise with a multitude
[3:06] that kept holy day
[3:08] why are thou cast down or my soul and
[3:11] why are thou discreeted in me
[3:14] hoped out in God for I say yet Praise
[3:17] Him for the help of his kindness amen

[50:51] when he came to the platform
[50:54] he mentioned that
[50:56] there was the thing to be done

[51:13] [Music]
[51:26] [Music]
[51:32] [Applause]
[51:42] [Music]
[51:52] uh because this name platini is one of
[51:56] the biggest soccer player in France
[52:05] he made our day
[52:09] yes so last Wednesday we could not have
[52:14] a service
[52:17] yeah because of uh there's no this is
[52:20] the season City
[52:24] and I believe that each one of you had a
[52:28] wonderful service at home
[52:33] is that right
[52:35] how many edit services
[52:43] the rest of the people what do we do uh
[52:49] let me ask the children because they
[52:51] will tell you always the truth
[52:55] what about the Solomon did you have a
[52:58] service Wednesday at home
[53:06] sometimes
[53:07] before
[53:09] Shekinah
[53:11] look at me don't look at anywhere
[53:13] regardless
[53:19] when we have no service I believe we
[53:22] should always
[53:23] uh every service
[53:30] so after this morning service I will uh
[53:34] have a quick meeting with uh the people
[53:37] I send a text message to uh
[53:49] yeah so we have uh another trouble here
[53:52] with uh water it was a problem
[53:58] the repetition thank you musicians
[54:04] [Music]
[54:05] so I believe finally we are gonna get a
[54:09] new
[54:10] [Music]
[54:11] how do you call it a new way
[54:14] a new line with a new pipes yo
[54:22] just to solve it once forever because
[54:30] all the pipes I believe they are really
[54:33] old and they get uh
[54:35] a lot of trouble
[54:37] um
[54:44] and this morning I saw the people who
[54:47] came they do are they gonna start the
[54:50] work yes
[54:54] they will start this week
[54:59] okay
[55:03] um
[55:07] it's a lot of work thank God
[55:13] it's not anybody's fault
[55:17] but we need the money
[55:22] yeah this time you know I'm always shy
[55:24] but uh
[55:27] yeah I think that they are gonna charge
[55:31] us just for the material about eight
[55:33] thousand dollars
[55:39] between eight and ten thousand that's
[55:41] the outside people we need to do it
[55:47] in the next area
[55:50] and in addition to this hey
[55:53] um what's your place uh we have a big
[55:56] water bill
[55:58] in Grand Factory
[56:01] manual how much do you think
[56:04] Emmanuel convenient
[56:12] thousand the other day the other year
[56:14] they charged us about ten thousand and
[56:17] they splitted in two remember
[56:22] foreign
[56:23] that was the first one but the recent
[56:26] one
[56:27] we don't know yet
[56:32] usually usually we try to cover all of
[56:36] this but if it's a very very excessive I
[56:39] believe I have to
[56:43] um
[56:51] amen amen
[56:54] amen
[57:05] so uh I know we don't want to do this uh
[57:11] regularly but there are situations that
[57:14] happen we have no control
[57:24] we cannot push but it's what it is
[57:32] this is what is gonna bring blessing
[57:37] when you do it with
[57:40] a pure hot it will effective appear I
[57:44] know there are many people who are doing
[57:46] a lot of sacrifices may God bless them
[57:52] but you need to be also part of those
[57:55] blessings
[57:58] amen amen or sometimes you wonder a lot
[58:02] of situations
[58:03] why maybe God is not moving
[58:07] they both the situation
[58:10] but it's the way you treat that God
[58:17] sometimes you see
[58:20] complicated situations
[58:26] amen amen so
[58:29] uh Brother Richard and uh brother
[58:32] Matthew are in Belize if you can
[58:36] remember them in prayer foreign
[58:52] you don't know the culture you don't
[58:54] know the people you don't know the
[58:56] spirits
[58:59] but they have to depend on our prayers
[59:03] you have separation up here
[59:06] of them in prayer until God willing they
[59:08] will be back yes
[59:17] a couple weeks ago
[59:21] I married a couple here in the sanctuary
[59:27] you are not I think they are Indians
[59:31] so India
[59:34] they get contact with our sister Rachel
[59:37] is
[59:40] they wanted to get married if they say
[59:43] Maria but they don't they did not have
[59:45] money to pay the preacher
[59:50] yeah that was the ceremony ceremony the
[59:54] man was 24 years old my favorite cartoon
[59:58] and the girl who was 21.
[1:00:01] foreign
[1:00:38] that was it okay too and I look at the
[1:00:42] young people
[1:00:44] what make it so complicated yes
[1:00:50] hello
[1:00:51] hello
[1:00:54] very easy
[1:00:56] you don't need a complicated stuff the
[1:01:01] show's complicated but what you need
[1:01:05] is God failure to guide you
[1:01:09] and they really they think that uh push
[1:01:12] me to do the services
[1:01:18] it was because the past okay
[1:01:22] when I asked them few questions
[1:01:25] because this day you cannot marry people
[1:01:28] don't know like that
[1:01:29] um
[1:01:34] you have to make sure the man is a real
[1:01:37] man
[1:01:39] and the woman is a real woman
[1:01:45] and number two you know I don't know
[1:01:48] however there are County License is
[1:01:52] available
[1:01:55] the parents were okay
[1:01:59] and when I checked they never get
[1:02:01] married they were never married before
[1:02:07] and I asked them
[1:02:09] did you live together
[1:02:13] we don't even know each other yet
[1:02:22] those people they shallah they get
[1:02:26] married
[1:02:27] without touching one another sunset
[1:02:33] and you call them denominations
[1:02:37] as with the Revelation
[1:02:41] look at the struggle in regardless
[1:02:46] if you cannot leave the message
[1:02:50] God will have somebody somewhere to be a
[1:02:54] witness yes
[1:02:58] amen and it was the first time they
[1:03:02] kissed one another here
[1:03:06] so brother we don't need always to spend
[1:03:09] a lot of money for marriages
[1:03:16] because after marriage there is a life
[1:03:22] there is a life after marriage
[1:03:25] sometimes we go depth after death depth
[1:03:28] after death and after the funds are on
[1:03:32] the the death and death they are praying
[1:03:34] if you have a lot of money that's fine
[1:03:38] but if you cannot
[1:03:41] just leave the correct way
[1:03:44] find a nice person with a inborn person
[1:03:48] and you can even have the wedding
[1:03:50] ceremony at your own time
[1:03:57] amen amen so really I encourage the
[1:04:00] young people
[1:04:11] what advice do you give to a couple who
[1:04:14] plan to get married foreign
[1:04:31] [Music]
[1:04:40] [Music]
[1:05:04] desirable
[1:05:08] they are not the trees
[1:05:11] be flexible that's why you flexible if
[1:05:14] you try to be tough tough tough tough
[1:05:18] decisions it will be like the monkey who
[1:05:21] missed details
[1:05:31] so you you are gonna extend the thing
[1:05:34] for no reason I'm saying it with all my
[1:05:36] friends okay
[1:05:40] when I see pictures like this
[1:05:43] image comes and say and I think about my
[1:05:47] people she passed the mission I see
[1:05:50] I say maybe we did not preach right
[1:05:58] and the girl also
[1:06:00] you don't need to turn people down all
[1:06:03] the time
[1:06:09] worry about it
[1:06:11] and move on
[1:06:17] we cannot
[1:06:19] for no valid reason refuse
[1:06:26] bless and guide each one of you
[1:06:31] amen amen yeah
[1:06:38] when his brother doc came and said I
[1:06:42] have a couple they want to get married
[1:06:44] but they don't have money to pay the

[1:07:13] if a girl is under age even 17 years old

[2:18:29] about the finance how we are in this
[2:18:32] building because we've got to pay for it
[2:18:35] and I felt like us as a church
[2:18:39] we are trying to do something yes God
[2:18:42] will bless us for what we're doing
[2:18:45] we we should have done more foreign
[2:19:21] [Music]
[2:19:46] this is not a blessing for us
[2:19:49] God will bless them
[2:19:54] and then he's saying
[2:19:59] the tight money was put to pay the
[2:20:02] deficit because we wouldn't be able to
[2:20:03] pay the house

[2:20:57] to pray overnight to bring all the
[2:21:00] requests of each and everywhere

[2:21:18] the tenth of the what you have to give
[2:21:21] to God

[2:21:29] pocket to give it to us certainly sure
[2:21:31] it's a good thing

[2:21:36] saying in between us
[2:21:38] it's not always a good blessing for us
[2:21:43] I believe if we decide
[2:21:51] where the Burnham says
[2:21:54] once you have something
[2:21:56] one tenth it's not your money just give
[2:22:00] it to them
