[11:43] you may be seated i'll continue uh what
[11:45] i was saying on sunday
[11:49] russia about the requirement of
[11:51] redemption
[11:52] basque citrus important because it's
[11:54] very important
[11:59] as brother burnham says
[12:02] [Music]
[12:06] when the people don't know anything
[12:15] [Music]
[12:17] somebody can mess around with you
[12:19] because you don't know what you're
[12:20] talking about
[12:23] and you know today with the message
[12:28] nobody anybody can come with uh
[12:30] miscourts
[12:34] especially if he knows that you don't
[12:36] read you don't know anything you get a
[12:38] manipulation he can manipulate you man
[12:40] gracious
[12:41] my grace be to god
[12:45] god is ascendant
[12:49] and god that spoke to us about the whole
[12:51] bible
[12:52] uh says the existence you see the
[12:54] requirements here
[12:57] is important
[12:58] are very important to know them
[13:02] so that our worship to be perfect
[13:10] today there's a lot of people saying uh
[13:12] william branham is our god
[13:14] worship the truth is because of all
[13:16] these things
[13:18] amen
[13:28] you have to be a kiss to the family says
[13:36] those are the requirements god wanted to
[13:38] manifest
[13:41] as we read in the book of ruth
[13:47] we have seen
[13:48] foboas whisper mariage rita to take ruth
[13:52] as his wife
[13:56] in reality ruse was not a jews la person
[13:59] que teste
[14:03] the one the jewish one that had to be
[14:05] with him was naomi
[14:09] naomi was the one to be redeemed
[14:15] because naomi was a jews
[14:24] and by elimelech was the husband of
[14:26] naomi and uh
[14:54] when you redeem something that belongs
[14:56] to a person
[15:00] you have to redeem everything that
[15:01] belongs to the person
[15:04] and the reason why khan boaz rashed now
[15:07] when bo was redeemed naomi automatic ma
[15:10] you rasheed
[15:34] when the pastor wanted to ask questions
[15:36] if to see if people understand or not
[15:38] malaysia
[15:52] i saw even simple thing people were not
[15:54] able to answer them
[16:00] i felt like
[16:02] i didn't do anything people didn't
[16:04] understand what i was preaching
[16:06] man but
[16:11] i think that boasts represent the
[16:13] christians boasts represent christ
[16:19] naomi represents the jewish church
[16:23] [Music]
[16:25] and ruth represent the church of nation
[16:32] and brother william is saying in plenty
[16:34] messages
[16:41] a perfect plane of redemption that
[16:43] represented in the book of ruth amen
[16:45] amen
[16:48] what is happening with ruth
[16:52] that's the same thing that's happening
[16:54] with us
[16:56] talking about the plane of redemption
[17:00] i'm saying this message
[17:12] i really love this book
[17:16] as the belief this message you know the
[17:18] feasts are defeated here as sons and
[17:19] daughters of god
[17:21] shaken
[17:23] every one of us at home for me
[17:26] in the family we need to have this book
[17:28] and to cast a certain leaf this is a
[17:31] book
[17:33] that you cannot like at your home
[17:36] company
[17:37] and today we're going to understand that
[17:39] this book
[17:40] no tradition
[17:42] our inheritance is found in this book
[18:04] and god required a kingsman redeemer
[18:09] and he must be a human
[18:40] as we see in the top of boas boaz
[18:44] was a king's men redeemer
[18:48] because it was a king's fault to
[18:49] eliminate
[18:56] he was the one who has the the the right
[18:58] to redeem
[18:59] everything that belongs to elimelech
[19:02] in the same way
[19:07] we deem naomi
[19:18] that's the same thing god did with the
[19:20] church
[19:21] now me naomi
[20:02] when you place them on the yoyo
[20:32] heart
[20:34] he had eternal life
[20:36] he had a joy tonight
[20:39] he didn't have any misery
[20:43] the wonderful plane of god met question
[20:46] what happened i'd not have accepted it i
[20:48] had them with that inheritance no suffer
[20:50] not enemy we know our enemies
[20:53] the devil came back
[20:56] by uh uh
[20:58] life
[21:00] disciples what
[21:14] he lost
[21:25] when you you buy your land members if

[21:32] tarot care test that uh
[21:35] yeah that that land belongs to people

[21:47] belongs to this person
[21:50] literally reigns on us

[22:50] [Applause]
[23:34] the ownership of adam

[23:39] that slide into from the hands of the
[23:41] secretary

[24:19] authorities authority
[24:22] let the existing second seller that took
[24:25] requirements
[24:28] that took a kingsman amen amen emperor
[24:33] prosthetic the king's men close to adam
[24:35] dog you have their sexists they had
[24:37] requirements their condition conditions
[24:41] so the enemy
[24:42] totally have the authority back that is
[24:46] why
[24:47] conditions first requirements
[24:53] the one that was will be able to redeem
[24:55] edward okay
[24:58] foreign
[25:28] [Applause]
[25:40] he
[25:56] but the angel never failed
[25:58] he says
[26:00] that satan
[26:02] expressed difference he's a different
[26:04] kind of being
[26:05] called different he has a different body
[26:21] [Applause]
[26:36] don't thought i would never continue
[26:41] and every man on the earth was born of
[26:43] sacrifices
[26:49] this way it came from le pesce even sex
[26:52] the the sin came from sex
[26:56] that means the one that has to be
[26:58] accused
[27:01] he doesn't have to be born by sex amen
[27:04] amen
[27:20] he has to be upright man a man and
[27:23] justin
[27:25] desjardins
[27:28] it seems it means like that person they
[27:30] cannot be condemned by the problem of
[27:32] sin
[27:45] because that's where sin started
[27:51] 135.
[27:56] he must be a kingsman
[27:59] now you see energy
[28:28] when we see these things
[28:32] people like i don't remember everybody
[28:35] couldn't do it because it fell yes it's
[28:38] here moses came mal gray first of all
[28:40] despite that he made god's faith
[29:03] as he's born out of sex disconfirmed
[29:05] disqualified john baptist john the
[29:08] bastard
[29:09] the one that jesus said let's
[29:23] because every prophet spoke about the
[29:25] language i tested every person he was
[29:27] the one who had to present him they call
[29:29] me leonard palace but since he was born
[29:31] out of physical fear he was also
[29:33] disqualified a precious yeah and jesus
[29:36] died
[29:37] jesse louis jesus himself kailene when
[29:41] he was born said
[29:42] yesterday he was god the spirit
[29:49] that sent the word by the angel
[29:52] to
[30:05] i cannot leave my children
[30:20] he got to marry
[31:15] except that it was with sinless amen
[31:18] amen amen
[31:19] and patience without sins
[31:22] without any condemnation
[31:26] that's our prayer kingsman
[31:29] amen
[31:45] redeem the wonderful yeah
[31:47] he had to be a man yes
[31:50] sex but he didn't have to be born out of
[31:51] sex therefore like a young woman but now
[31:54] see god himself
[31:56] be become a flesh
[32:25] even when he was growing up he let his
[32:27] sister a model he was just an example
[32:31] he was living a life in a video model a
[32:34] life of an example
[32:36] that means
[33:26] [Music]
[33:35] that gave birth to jesus
[34:15] he says i was born from a dad called
[34:18] shaw bruh
[34:29] that is born from a man and a woman he
[34:31] cannot be a kingsman
[34:35] [Applause]
[35:29] affect the same as yourself we are in
[35:30] the serpents
[35:33] you see the sin is in the blood
[35:37] the sin was in the blood
[35:40] to be uh enough wealthy foreign
[36:05] [Applause]
[36:23] but when they see that scene
[36:26] who's worthy
[36:27] who's worthy
[36:29] the angels
[36:31] they never knew any sin menu
[36:34] but we just went with you really say
[36:35] some posters they bow down allah
[36:42] [Applause]
[36:57] [Applause]
[37:06] we would have been lost so secondly
[37:08] story written
[37:10] that's the story of what the story of
[37:11] ruth is
[37:14] saying
[37:15] you see or see
[37:17] virginal or also in the virgin birth
[37:20] lesentes
[37:32] jesus was not a gentile jessie
[37:36] jesus was god exactly that exactly
[37:44] his blood didn't come from any sex acts
[37:47] [Music]
[38:01] he was the holy created blood of god
[38:07] and we are now saved by juice blood
[38:10] priest
[38:13] neither are we saved by gentle blood no
[38:16] summer survivor
[38:18] we are saved by the blood of god
[38:21] that's according to the bible that's the
[38:23] second ability that's what the bible
[38:25] says amen amen set on the kingdom please
[38:28] say condition this man that fulfill all
[38:31] the requirements
[38:36] that man that fills all the equipment
[38:39] the men that call goel
[38:41] go
[38:44] just
[38:52] is the mind that fills all the
[38:54] requirements to redeem and no matter
[38:57] amanda the king's men an integral a
[39:00] upright man just
[39:03] just said
[39:05] the man who's wealthy enough
[39:11] he has to testify publicly
[39:15] after being a close kinsman a pretty
[39:18] little integra after being upright men
[39:21] are pretty less if he's a marriage after
[39:23] being enough a rich
[39:25] public he has to testify publicly
[39:29] that is what you see
[39:31] when god says
[39:33] he was worthy to take the blame
[39:35] he was worthy
[39:37] of people
[39:38] because he testified publicly upon the
[39:40] kingdom of god
[39:52] before the coming of jesus personally
[40:36] even when jesus was resurrected
[40:39] when people went to see the truth
[40:42] they saw that the rock was the place
[40:45] it was empty
[40:49] was resurrected for years
[41:04] amen
[41:17] [Music]
[41:42] in most of the case they are not saved

[43:23] only god could be a kingsman redeemer he
[43:26] says
[43:29] he'll never enter a prayer affair he
[43:31] must be willing to do it yeah he'll
[43:32] never eat an emperor there must be a
[43:34] kingsman and plush next to the king's
[43:36] movie
[43:37] to do it hey

[45:04] person he is himself he's a senior
[45:05] people say sovereign he cannot save
