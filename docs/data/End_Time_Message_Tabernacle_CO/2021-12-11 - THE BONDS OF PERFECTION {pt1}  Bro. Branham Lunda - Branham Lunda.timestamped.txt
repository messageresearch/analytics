[18:16] whether be knowledge it shall vanish
[18:18] away for we know in part and we prophesy
[18:21] in part but when that which is perfect
[18:24] is come and that which is part shall be
[18:26] done away amen

[18:48] Christ we always happy to be in the
[18:50] presence of the
[18:55] Lord we thank God for giving us the
[18:57] opportunity to be counting among the
[19:01] living I also thank our
[19:07] pastor for giv
[19:09] us this opportunity to speak to you the
[19:12] people of
[19:17] God I always say we honored to bring the
[19:20] word of
[19:27] God
[19:29] brother say when somebody trust you you
[19:31] can deceive the
[19:39] person of
[19:42] TR we don't we don't want abuse it let
[19:48] us may God keep us not to abuse
[19:57] it
[19:59] I didn't want really to preach it's just
[20:01] exhortation I would like to share with
[20:09] you if God's willing let us lead us to
[20:14] pray a lot and to examine
[20:25] our I ask for forgiveness to God back
[20:28] always I run away from this job today I
[20:31] wanted to call the pastor to
[20:37] apologize and somebody something told me
[20:40] like who are you what problem with
[20:46] you may the Lord forgive
[20:53] us we believe God will bless us even
[20:56] with one
[20:57] word
[21:02] I don't really have a topic to title to
[21:04] give
[21:08] M I believe God willing on Sunday we're
[21:11] going to have a topic a
[21:16] t but today I just want entitle
[21:20] this the bonds of perfection amen
[21:26] amen this is just a little
[21:33] exaltation I know we are the children of
[21:38] Mal we love the prophet amen
[21:45] amen because the prophet sent to
[21:51] us to help us to know to understand the
[21:57] Bible because if you try to understand
[21:59] the Bible on our
[22:01] ways we will not understand
[22:04] it the Bible is like a
[22:07] Wilderness like a great
[22:10] forest and if you're not used to you
[22:13] will get
[22:17] L it Tak someone who's know is born
[22:20] there to know to show you the
[22:22] way like a
[22:26] guide if you go this way there mountains
[22:35] there's start leading you go let's go
[22:37] this way let's
[22:39] go this is why you know with this
[22:44] Bible it brought a lot of theology a lot
[22:50] of Glory to God this same Bible brought
[22:53] us a
[22:56] prophet we so grateful because we now in
[22:59] confusion amen
[23:02] amen Inus where we
[23:06] read we see that it's a law in the Old
[23:12] Testament people in the Old Testament
[23:15] they were living by
[23:19] laws and here was the law that God gave
[23:22] to Moses he told
[23:26] Moses if am you somebody
[23:33] sin so for me the Lord to forgive that
[23:40] person he has to bring a
[23:45] ram he has to bring the ram to the
[23:51] priest and that real should be
[23:56] blemished
[23:58] it doesn't have to have blish
[24:01] body it has to be a perfect
[24:05] lamb and then that person will present
[24:07] to the
[24:09] priest and the priest has to examine
[24:12] this
[24:15] lamb
[24:18] happening and The
[24:22] Sinner was putting his hand upon the
[24:26] lamb
[24:28] because the land was representing the
[24:32] person how things were happening in the
[24:34] Old
[24:38] Testament as I was saying I won't be
[24:41] long just few
[24:47] words that was just a
[24:50] law by brother bham
[24:55] says despite that law
[24:59] but you notice that
[25:01] lamb it's just a lamb just it doesn't
[25:05] have
[25:06] soul a lamb doesn't have a
[25:09] soul but as a
[25:12] human we're created after the image of
[25:15] God we
[25:16] have this is the reason
[25:20] why the type that God showed in the Old
[25:24] Testament we
[25:26] despite
[25:30] it was just the shadow that things to
[25:33] [Music]
[25:36] come despite that the worshiper will
[25:39] bring the
[25:42] lamb the sin was not completely
[25:49] atoned because the blood of the animal
[25:52] is not comparable with the blood of
[25:56] human
[26:00] that the man will come and
[26:03] say I've done
[26:07] this I did
[26:12] this brought for the remission of my
[26:17] sin the priest will examine the
[26:21] land is without
[26:24] blemish and they will slay the lamb
[26:27] despite that
[26:29] fact men will go
[26:33] back but he still had the desire to do
[26:35] the same
[26:37] thing because in that
[26:40] blood there wasn't any
[26:43] power to deliver us amen
[26:47] amen but we will understand
[26:54] today it was just the shadow that things
[26:56] to come through
[26:59] this is why we have to examine
[27:02] ourselves to know that if back there was
[27:04] the
[27:07] shadow because the lamb typify Jesus
[27:11] Christ Jesus Christ is the Lamb of
[27:18] God presented him like a lamb of God
[27:20] that take away the sin of the
[27:23] world and today
[27:26] believers when we do
[27:29] evil we come to
[27:38] Jesus the work of Cal on Jesus Christ
[27:41] the Lamb of
[27:46] God because the king's man
[27:50] Redeemer when he
[27:53] forgive it's for for for for brother bam
[28:00] says the Sinners doesn't have to have
[28:03] the the desire of sin in the Old
[28:07] Testament you confess your sin you bring
[28:10] the
[28:13] L but you always come back with the same
[28:15] desire to do the
[28:17] same but back there they didn't have any
[28:20] power it was just a
[28:22] shadow
[28:25] say that blood could not take away
[28:29] just
[28:32] cover Here Comes Jesus
[28:36] chist Jesus Christ is nothing
[28:39] but because he
[28:41] saw because he saw
[28:45] that a human being that
[28:48] [Applause]
[28:53] fell he he needs to be Redeemed by his
[28:56] kins
[29:00] the blood that has to redeem
[29:02] us according to the
[29:05] r he has to be a
[29:07] king he has to be a man like
[29:12] me he has to be someone without
[29:16] blame somebody doesn't have to go
[29:18] through
[29:23] sex have the power to redeem the person
[29:25] that fell
[29:27] and nobody could do
[29:30] it even the prophet could
[29:33] come Moses for
[29:38] example somebody who go go to the
[29:40] mountain spend 40 days and 40
[29:43] nights he was also the type of Christ
[29:46] but he could do
[29:48] nothing because he was born through sex
[29:51] amen amen yes
[29:56] sir and we find out that God
[29:59] so according to his own
[30:02] law because that God doesn't go away
[30:05] from he's not like
[30:07] us I can create a
[30:10] law and tomorrow I change
[30:13] it he doesn't go away from his according
[30:16] to his own
[30:19] law he saw the person that has to
[30:22] redeem he has to be a
[30:25] wealthy he has to be a man born without
[30:28] sin he has to be
[30:31] just nobody could be that there is the
[30:34] reason
[30:37] why himself
[30:40] God the superal
[30:43] God created that cells in
[30:46] Mary cells created iny the blood
[30:51] cell Jesus Christ was
[30:54] born it was nothing but Jesus
[30:58] that is why brother
[31:00] say and the blood that was in
[31:04] Jesus it wasn't the human
[31:08] blood it wasn't the Jew
[31:12] blood it wasn't the blood of
[31:16] Joseph it was the the blood of God
[31:22] himself you not Redeemed by Jew
[31:26] blood
[31:28] by the blood of God
[31:30] himself the reason why
[31:33] today when we come to
[31:36] Jesus we confess our
[31:40] sins if it's really God who convince
[31:43] us our sins
[31:46] are not just washed
[31:49] away even the desire of sin hallelujah
[31:54] hallelujah has to die
[31:58] completely and tonight we have to find
[32:01] out if we
[32:03] confess and that
[32:06] desire still
[32:08] there then we have to
[32:11] know who redeemed
[32:14] us are we did we confess really
[32:18] [Music]
[32:19] well brother bam say in this
[32:24] message Christ is not welcome
[32:35] I believe it preached in
[32:41] 1955 the unwelcome
[32:46] Christ welcome
[32:51] Christ let me skip few things
[32:56] here
[33:03] paragraph let me skip a few things
[33:12] here then the land was
[33:20] slay uh the land died so
[33:25] that
[33:33] August
[33:34] 22 Yeah
[33:39] 28 why he has
[33:42] the birth
[33:46] right because the lamb the lamb has the
[33:49] birth
[33:52] right they never examine
[33:54] the they examine the lamb
[33:59] the priest looks at the
[34:01] lamb now you Bible
[34:06] readers know that under the laws of
[34:11] redemption in the New
[34:16] Testament no matter what's wrong with
[34:18] you amen
[34:25] amen
[34:28] brother was talking about like here in
[34:30] the Old Testament was just
[34:32] Shadow you
[34:36] commit you bring a lamb Without
[34:41] Blame to the
[34:44] priest and the
[34:49] priest that's why we can call today the
[34:52] pastors the Ephesians
[34:55] 4
[34:58] and the pastor will examine the
[35:01] lamb that has to be blemish Without
[35:10] Blame slay the lamb and do the service
[35:12] for the remission
[35:15] of this is why you find out in the Old
[35:23] Testament people has a full
[35:25] consideration to the priest that's right
[35:27] amen
[35:29] amen because this is the law of
[35:35] God you cannot go by yourself to the
[35:37] holiest
[35:39] of because in the Old
[35:42] Testament for God to forgive your
[35:45] sin there was a
[35:49] procedure the worshiper who commit
[35:53] sin because for God to forgive you he
[35:56] has to see the blood you bring your
[36:01] lamb the man of God the priest will take
[36:04] the
[36:05] lamb he will wash the
[36:08] lamb which is the type of the baptism
[36:11] water he will slay the
[36:13] land and the blood will come out and he
[36:16] will take the
[36:17] land and put it in the
[36:20] little
[36:22] amen and this is our God who established
[36:25] that order
[36:27] you cannot go by
[36:28] yourself he has to be the
[36:31] priest he take the
[36:33] blood himself the
[36:38] priest he will take the blood and bring
[36:40] in the holiest of
[36:43] holy and if God agree your
[36:48] forgiveness and there in the Holiness of
[36:53] holy will come to consume the sacrifice
[36:58] he will burn the blood to
[37:01] say I the Lord have forgiven sir amen
[37:08] [Applause]
[37:12] amen and the holiest of holy and the
[37:15] outs
[37:16] C and the in the old
[37:22] test people have high esteem to to the
[37:25] people that were working in the church
[37:31] and today people that know God have high
[37:33] consideration to the
[37:36] priest because if you play with the

[40:38] perfect and you know
[40:40] why God me to read this uh scripture in
[40:44] First
[40:45] Corinthian First Corinthian he
[40:49] says prophe will
[40:52] Sease even the preaching will seize one
[40:55] day
[40:57] because now we know in little
[40:59] in when the perfect will
[41:02] come which is little will done away
[41:06] brother bam
[41:08] says the perfect is always Jesus Christ
[41:12] the perfect is The
[41:14] Headstone the perfect is the Divine
[41:18] love
[41:19] now let me get inside my
[41:25] preaching bam
[41:30] says can you find any fault in him no
[41:37] no
[41:39] God doesn't look at you looks at the
[41:43] lamb so if there's no fault in the
[41:47] lamb there's no fault with
[41:51] you
[41:53] how I I'll be looking at my brother
[41:57] because God himself when he's looking at
[42:00] me
[42:02] Hallelujah as he
[42:05] knows
[42:07] I I've already put my My Hands of Faith
[42:11] at
[42:13] calary upon the
[42:15] lamb the lamb who is Jesus
[42:19] Christ the one the one who went to the
[42:21] cross for my
[42:23] sins when he look at me it says you
[42:28] perfect but when you see your brother
[42:31] when you see your brother your sister
[42:33] how do you see the brother and your
[42:36] sister how do you see
[42:39] them you see them that they're
[42:45] perfect when God sees
[42:47] USF are we really
[42:50] perfect amen
[42:52] amen are we really perfect about
[42:57] I know by myself I'm not
[43:02] perfect this is why I'm always running
[43:04] away from job I'm unw
[43:07] worthy every day
[43:09] I I'm not
[43:12] worthy but because of the blood of Jesus
[43:15] Christ when he sees me look at me he
[43:19] doesn't see me anymore he sees the Lamb
[43:21] of if doesn't have
[43:24] any then you perfect
[43:28] why
[43:28] me as a Son of
[43:31] God why I wouldn't also see as
[43:34] perfect why I wouldn't see my sisters
[43:37] perfect in other
[43:40] words because the bond of
[43:42] perfection says it's the Divine love and
[43:47] brother bham
[43:49] says when the the
[43:54] love and Serv Grace takes
[43:59] place this is why give punches to the
[44:02] devil the devil can
[44:04] preach this is why you
[44:08] see I will not go to heaven because I'm
[44:13] preaching I will not go to heaven
[44:15] because I speak
[44:17] Tong nor because I'm
[44:20] somebody I'll go to
[44:22] heaven if I have the Holy Ghost amen
[44:25] amen
[44:27] and
[44:28] now if God himself by looking at me he
[44:33] says you
[44:34] perfect the
[44:37] love
[44:40] why I wouldn't see my brother is
[44:43] perfect because when God sees
[44:46] me he said why he so
[44:49] M because he has the
[44:51] land I see confessed you perfect
[44:57] but when the devil goes to the father
[44:59] you didn't see what he has
[45:00] done God told the devil you didn't see
[45:05] that he
[45:07] repented but you the devil you never
[45:11] repented since you
[45:13] existed you never
[45:17] repented this is
[45:19] why
[45:20] today I I wanted just to
[45:24] say
[45:28] is
[45:31] unworthy but when God sees
[45:34] me sees me
[45:36] perfect not because perfect but because
[45:40] of the
[45:42] Lamb why
[45:45] then I don't to consider my brother and
[45:48] my sisters
[45:49] perfect in other words as
[45:54] chistian why I have to see
[45:58] only the wrong side of that
[46:01] person why do I have to FOC the
[46:05] wrong a mistake that he has
[46:08] done not to see the good side of that
[46:12] person and let
[46:14] tonight the bonds of love the Perfection
[46:18] let it be divine
[46:20] love to bring us
[46:23] us as children of God
[46:27] see the same thing as our father amen
[46:36] Amen brother

[46:43] lamb he didn't just die for your
[46:48] healing plenty blessing that for which
[46:51] he has taken your
[46:53] place and today you have the privilege
[46:56] to claim it amen
[46:59] amen not just for your
[47:01] healing not just for your forgiveness
[47:06] to for everything that the devil
[47:10] has even
[47:13] poverty even
[47:16] sickness any other
[47:19] link can let it be
[47:22] seen Christ has taken our place

[48:21] nobody would see
[48:23] him brother bam say
[48:30] this is the thing that lack in the
[48:31] church
[48:35] today is delaying the Rapture think
[48:41] about brother bham
[48:45] says we now wait for the
[48:49] church

[48:58] come I'm saying we're not going to
[49:02] wait call churches to come close the

[49:24] thinking going to ask for forgiveness to
[49:26] this
[49:28] brother God has given us
[49:31] time God has given us
[49:34] time I wanted to read a lot of things
[49:37] here
[49:38] now God will help
[49:45] us in the message perfection in
[49:54] 1956 Jun 10
[49:58] notice I said this for you to
[50:06] understand paragraph
[50:10] 15 today in the
[50:15] world the Bible has predicted
[50:19] it there three kind of
[50:23] people one of them
[50:27] there's a cold
[50:29] people formal formal formal
[50:33] indiffer and
[50:36] different they just go
[50:40] ahead is no more than belonging to a
[50:44] l they go to
[50:50] church talk a little about this that and
[50:53] the Lord and so forth
[50:56] and come
[51:01] back but no actual Born Again
[51:04] experience amen
[51:14] amen formal and different people they go
[51:16] to
[51:19] church they talk a little bit about this
[51:22] and about the Lord and other things
[51:26] and they go back
[51:29] home but no
[51:33] actual notice brother bam said the
[51:36] actual again
[51:43] experience someone who has like a born
[51:46] again experience will hat his brother I
[51:49] don't believe
[51:53] that some of them
[51:56] claim do you love the
[52:01] prophet or some of them claim
[52:06] it but their life proves that it's not
[52:11] [Applause]
[52:14] so now that's over one
[52:19] side one way it's another side The
[52:24] Fanatic
[52:26] and the real true
[52:29] church didn't finish
[52:31] his Jesus said
[52:34] so they will be so
[52:37] closed together it will deceive the very
[52:43] elect I was reading brother bham in the
[52:46] lamb book of the the lamb
[52:50] book that the life L
[52:54] book in this hand
[52:57] time the
[53:03] seduction if it wasn't Go I mean if God
[53:06] didn't cut off the
[53:09] days if there wasn't any
[53:13] elect the seduction will be very
[53:18] great in such a way even for the very
[53:20] elect will be difficult for
[53:24] them
[53:28] seduction it's just here in on the world
[53:31] but the seduction is even
[53:33] here you're thinking you're talking
[53:35] about of Jesus but who who gave up the
[53:39] message it
[53:41] was with a great
[53:43] Pastor who was God himself the Creator
[53:47] but despite
[53:49] that somebody sell the message in the
[53:54] church but I love the attitude of our
[53:57] Lord
[53:58] Jesus the Lord Jesus
[54:01] Christ oh God give me your
[54:04] spirit he knew the person he was living
[54:08] with he never kick him out of the
[54:12] church he never gave him to the hand of
[54:15] the
[54:24] devil
[54:27] they will be very close he will deceive
[54:30] the very
[54:35] elect now many people as soon as they
[54:37] see the fanatism mix up with the
[54:41] real are the there's nothing to
[54:46] it you see
[54:48] that
[54:50] beloved this message is the
[54:54] truth
[54:57] but there's also Fanatics that came
[55:00] along they call themselves
[55:03] Brothers they call themselves sisters
[55:06] amen
[55:08] amen this is
[55:11] why it looks
[55:14] like when some people
[55:16] come when they see those
[55:21] fanatic because they don't know why why
[55:23] they came that's why the
[55:27] backslide you have to
[55:30] know told you in this
[55:33] [Applause]
[55:35] message where you do you stand where as
[55:38] brother preached last
[55:39] Sunday because we believe in
[55:42] this you don't I mean you won't notice
[55:45] that even myself talking to you I'm not
[55:48] saying that the
[55:50] case I can do
[55:52] something that can deceive that can
[55:54] disappo
[55:56] I'm human
[55:58] being but if you don't know why you
[56:01] coming
[56:02] here you don't know why you believe the
[56:05] message you go back to the
[56:08] wall
[56:10] today this is the time that we should
[56:13] know why I'm in the
[56:16] message why am I doing
[56:19] here did I follow a
[56:21] movement did I follow someone
[56:26] or I just follow
[56:30] like so one thing will stop one
[56:34] day may God help us they
[56:39] say there's nothing
[56:42] there this church Fanatics there's
[56:45] nothing
[56:46] there they go ahead you
[56:50] see that the same thing the
[56:53] done
[56:57] Satan doesn't fool with trying to
[56:59] pervert
[57:02] that he's trying to per this
[57:10] truth how does the devil will try to per
[57:13] this
[57:15] Truth by from the pastor from
[57:20] theal by from the brother
[57:23] from by the brother from the
[57:34] message yeah the
[57:41] followers if there's not that actual
[57:44] Born Again
[57:46] experience one day you be the one that
[57:50] will pervert the
[57:52] truth tonight
[57:57] let God bring down the love divine love
[58:02] amen more than able to
[58:05] consume
[58:08] consum desire make help
[58:14] us he's trying to pervert this
[58:21] truth and this Fanatics here is trying
[58:24] to personate the truth
[58:29] see this where your danger line lies
[58:33] right
[58:35] there he us to stay
[58:41] spiritual a fanatic
[58:44] spirit will not should not have a place
[58:47] in your
[58:50] life the spirit that try to per the word
[58:54] should not have
[58:56] a unfortunately it will still be there
[59:00] because those two spirits will go
[59:02] along and they can try to SCE even their
[59:06] very if it was
[59:12] possible the very will not be
[59:16] deceived they will always be
[59:20] fanatic there will always people trying
[59:23] to imitate imp personate
[59:26] the
[59:27] very the very Daughters of God they will
[59:31] stay with the
[59:38] word it behooves us to stay
[59:40] spiritual read the
[59:47] word
[59:49] anything anything that rises outside
[59:52] contrary to the word then cast it aside
[59:55] amen yes sir amen
[59:58] amen everything that is not in the word
[1:00:01] cast it
[1:00:02] aside
[1:00:07] Lord there's the reason why I'm too hard
[1:00:10] on woman
[1:00:11] preachers brother says there's a lot of
[1:00:14] things
[1:00:15] here let me just skip few
[1:00:22] things God is showing us shadows in the
[1:00:25] Old
[1:00:26] Testament but you
[1:00:31] know Christ was slain before the
[1:00:34] foundation of the
[1:00:36] world when God look at on upon the
[1:00:42] Earth he saw the only thing that could
[1:00:44] save a man
[1:00:49] lost I don't know if in this word I mean
[1:00:52] terms but it could be something like
[1:00:54] that
[1:00:59] man could not be
[1:01:01] saved he will
[1:01:06] [Music]
[1:01:08] se but let me look at I just see
[1:01:11] thousand of sincere heart
[1:01:16] coming I see thousand of people trying
[1:01:19] to be
[1:01:23] Sav
[1:01:26] and they wouldn't want to experience the
[1:01:28] the horrible Destruction for the devil
[1:01:31] and his
[1:01:35] angels and they have to go to the
[1:01:40] perpetual and sincere people will see
[1:01:43] it and I will have a man by the name
[1:01:47] of be
[1:01:49] born there will be another one in the
[1:01:51] name of
[1:01:53] jacobob Jacob will
[1:01:57] be he won't be very good to start by but
[1:02:01] in his
[1:02:03] heart he will love things of
[1:02:06] God this is why I will choose
[1:02:13] him trying to say
[1:02:15] here God is in for
[1:02:18] knowledge he saw
[1:02:21] us he saw the age of
[1:02:25] he saw who was going to be the
[1:02:30] prophet he saw the age of the that go
[1:02:33] forward until
[1:02:35] now he saw
[1:02:37] us he saw
[1:02:42] you he saw that you love
[1:02:45] God you believe his
[1:02:49] word he also saw the person that W
[1:02:52] believe but it could be
[1:02:58] be it could be
[1:03:00] somebody a normal
[1:03:02] person that's is why brother
[1:03:05] says we have to be
[1:03:09] balanced the people like really
[1:03:14] fundamental they think being that
[1:03:17] fundamental that
[1:03:18] one that's
[1:03:20] wrong there
[1:03:23] people they're not
[1:03:25] fundamental they're very
[1:03:29] extremist they think by trying to be
[1:03:32] extrem that will save them
[1:03:35] no God saw
[1:03:39] us so who will really
[1:03:44] believe he saw who will give himself to
[1:03:47] God all
[1:03:49] his he saw that who will just come to
[1:03:53] impis as is God he so
[1:03:57] INF he knows
[1:04:00] everything every
[1:04:02] thought every
[1:04:04] project everything he
[1:04:07] knows and when he saw
[1:04:09] everything he saw in that brother he
[1:04:12] loves God he he
[1:04:15] know he doesn't
[1:04:17] question that sister the
[1:04:20] same and
[1:04:23] then and he said that
[1:04:26] person since the foundation of the world
[1:04:29] I won't mind about
[1:04:31] his I know because when he does
[1:04:34] that he will come back to
[1:04:37] repent and then he for ordained things
[1:04:40] amen
[1:04:41] amen and the great God Of
[1:04:44] Heaven who loves us so
[1:04:48] much and he came and took our
[1:04:50] place to die at the cross that's why he
[1:04:55] chose
[1:04:57] Jacob and he
[1:05:00] hated when you
[1:05:02] see he looks
[1:05:06] correct a good
[1:05:08] brother if the pastor sees
[1:05:13] the
[1:05:15] TR have somebody to trust in the
[1:05:18] church this a good
[1:05:21] sister he respect his H her husband
[1:05:25] works but in his
[1:05:28] heart he didn't have any desire of
[1:05:31] God he didn't have any
[1:05:34] desire to come to surrender to
[1:05:39] God the other
[1:05:42] one maybe sometime you always
[1:05:46] fall sometime I come God help
[1:05:50] me God I want to try I want but when God
[1:05:54] sees the desire God say I will help
[1:05:59] you do you know God didn't come for only
[1:06:02] the Saints the
[1:06:06] holy God came to seek people that cannot
[1:06:09] save
[1:06:11] themselves another
[1:06:15] part when God came for the
[1:06:19] Sinners he didn't come for them not to
[1:06:22] stay Sinners amen
[1:06:26] amen God came for the
[1:06:29] Sinners he came for me
[1:06:32] Sinners so that I cannot be sin
[1:06:35] anymore Save Me by his
[1:06:39] grace because I've done
[1:06:42] something it's not because I'm good no
[1:06:45] amen
[1:06:47] amen may God help
[1:06:51] us
[1:06:53] says he saw
[1:06:58] you he know that you wanted to be
[1:07:02] saved so he
[1:07:04] said the only thing I can do is to go
[1:07:08] down
[1:07:09] myself and have a son
[1:07:13] born or a body of Flesh and be be made
[1:07:17] like
[1:07:18] them oh
[1:07:21] that say God himself
[1:07:24] he became
[1:07:26] sin so that he may pay the
[1:07:37] price because he will take the highest
[1:07:39] thing there is to lift the man from The
[1:07:41] Lost
[1:07:44] condition the the highest place he
[1:07:47] was he came
[1:07:52] down just trying to find
[1:07:57] how and God who loves us with such a
[1:08:02] love he did that for us to save others
[1:08:06] right amen
[1:08:10] amen may God help
[1:08:18] us let me read maybe the last
[1:08:22] thing
[1:08:39] same
[1:08:41] preaching paragraph

[1:08:54] uh of things to
[1:08:59] come the having a
[1:09:05] Shad it's not the exact image of things

[1:09:12] things it was just a shadow of
[1:09:16] theage what will happening in the whole
[1:09:18] test
[1:09:20] was that's why took the
[1:09:26] over the world in the Golden Age of
[1:09:28] Israel what was he the
[1:09:38] shadow let me skip few
[1:09:42] things we see here and we see the
[1:09:46] shadow men and wom who profess to be
[1:09:49] Christian and live like the world they
[1:09:53] said
[1:09:55] oh I belong to church what difference
[1:09:57] does it
[1:09:59] make a Shad of the
[1:10:05] dece from the garden of
[1:10:08] heden who pretended to be
[1:10:12] good who pretended to have
[1:10:15] light who pretended to have
[1:10:19] wisdom was a
[1:10:22] Deceiver
[1:10:25] that's the way men and women does today
[1:10:27] amen
[1:10:30] am let let us not be wise on our
[1:10:35] eyes let count on the mercy of
[1:10:41] God do not crucify
[1:10:44] someone just because he did something
[1:10:47] wrong amen
[1:10:49] amen because
[1:10:51] youself you have a lot of mistake that
[1:10:55] but if you
[1:10:57] confess God look at you he says you

[1:11:05] brother do the same thing for your
[1:11:08] sister give him that
[1:11:10] Grace so that he could be
[1:11:18] saved that's why men and women
[1:11:22] does
[1:11:26] those that call upon the name of Jesus
[1:11:30] Christ and doesn't depart from
[1:11:33] sin that's what they
[1:11:43] do for shadowing the punishment that
[1:11:46] they will receive
[1:11:50] with Jesus said to the religious phares

[1:11:59] devil I hope that you understand
[1:12:03] this I hope that that sink wild in you

[1:19:40] you that's the reason why he's sending
[1:19:42] the
[1:19:43] word that is the reason why he died on
[1:19:45] the
[1:19:47] cross if you really go to to that's your
[1:19:51] own problem because has provided all the
[1:19:54] way so that you could not goell somebody

[1:21:30] case there had to be a shadow of the
[1:21:33] real Lamb of God that was come was
[1:21:36] coming to take away the sin of the
[1:21:40] world which has been for spoke before by

[1:23:28] God and that love of God when it comes
[1:23:31] in our
