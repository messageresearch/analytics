[9:31] it's like all of us when we have a
[9:33] preacher coming in our city we want to
[9:35] listen to him
[9:43] you know
[9:45] what the denomination do
[9:47] services
[9:49] forum
[9:50] every five years they rotate pastors
[9:54] jacques sengal in fond la rotation de
[9:56] pasteur de la paris because they say
[9:59] this after five years people become used
[10:02] to the ministry
[10:07] and uh
[10:09] it's become like uh oh same same thing
[10:12] he said
[10:15] but we are not a denomination depending
[10:17] on some pain denomination and we cannot
[10:20] take that road in papua new guinea but
[10:24] the word told us
[10:27] every time you come to church make it
[10:29] like it's a new opportunity
[10:35] opportunity
[10:36] i was surprised even one day i was
[10:39] preaching to
[10:40] uh in shekinah
[11:15] we have to be consecrated and serve the
[11:18] lord regardless
[11:24] amen amen
[11:26] so um i have been uh
[11:30] i did not have a rest for a long time
[11:34] panda intercello uh sometimes you travel
[11:37] yada muma voyage you spend a lot of time
[11:41] this this this
[11:45] district
[11:46] but i'm praying so that god can give me
[11:49] grace this time to have really a place
[11:52] to rest asia
[11:54] joe
[12:07] young boys saying
[12:09] the girl and the mom you you travel what
[12:12] about us they never travel you know
[12:22] they know
[12:23] vayaspa
[12:24] the girls and the mom they like all the
[12:27] wedding parties but the boy they are not
[12:29] interested at all
[12:36] i have a promise this time i will go
[12:38] with the boys asia for me
[12:43] i don't know when but
[12:46] even somebody gave me five hundred
[12:48] dollars for hotel room
[12:50] uh you'll see
[13:06] amen amen so
[13:09] after service after your service i want
[13:12] to have a quick meeting with the young
[13:15] people who went to the camp
[13:18] in
[13:30] some of them they wrote to me they gave
[13:33] me their report i read them but i want
[13:35] to spend time with them
[13:43] so that we can go over their
[13:46] notes
[13:50] so that will be in the sanctuary after
[13:52] preaching cersei daniels
[13:56] and i will also ask the rest of the
[13:58] group to go
[13:59] spend time in the meantime in the
[14:02] basement
[14:12] when i walked in last night a kanji
[14:15] marshall
[14:17] the kitchen look really
[14:19] messy
[14:20] or la cuisina resemble
[14:24] the rest of the basement the chairs
[14:26] everybody shift the table since we had
[14:29] the last fellowship
[14:31] the rest of the
[14:33] the shares the
[14:34] the tablet would say they pick what
[14:37] is available
[14:39] so if you can uh
[14:42] we need to keep that place after
[14:45] we have a fellowship in order for the
[14:47] next fellowships
[14:55] foreign
[14:58] no interpretation
[15:04] and uh so that will be after service
[15:07] it's a service
[15:09] and uh next sunday god willing
[15:13] questions
[15:14] i will have a meeting with
[15:18] the couples
[15:21] especially the young married
[15:24] especially regulation marie
[15:28] i want to have time to speak with them
[15:33] you know even brother branham when he
[15:35] married people
[15:36] and foreign
[15:40] always went secretly to try to see how
[15:42] they are living is that right
[15:49] is that right brother
[15:52] david so when i come i'm not coming like
[15:55] a father-in-law no
[15:58] no i'm coming as the pastor if you call
[16:01] me pastor
[16:03] discreetly
[16:04] it's great now
[16:07] but um that's a parenthesis so say in
[16:10] parentheses but uh the purpose for the
[16:12] meeting
[16:14] objective
[16:15] is trying to help those young people who
[16:18] get married there are certain topics
[16:20] that we cannot address on the pulpit
[16:31] if you look in the message
[16:38] there are certain things that brother
[16:39] barnum has spoken yeah they say
[16:42] foreign which i want to extract from
[16:46] there and go a little bit in more detail
[16:54] you may not understand but
[16:56] that's the reality
[16:59] of reality people burn for marriage
[17:02] marriage married
[17:13] i was thinking it's like this and upon
[17:15] say come see i was thinking it was like
[17:18] this
[17:20] but now you are in the field meant now
[17:23] that's really shocked you are going to
[17:24] face certain realities
[17:29] and some of the realities yes attend
[17:31] this reality if it's not properly
[17:34] addressed
[17:40] it can lead to a big problem
[17:45] some of the problems can be solved just
[17:47] by
[17:48] a nice advice
[17:50] certain problem
[17:54] because sometimes even men and husband
[17:57] basketball wife and husband
[18:01] family
[18:02] even some who are already married for a
[18:04] certain number of years
[18:09] there is something there that you have
[18:11] to break between wife and husband
[18:17] to come to a the fullness of confidence
[18:20] that revere la plenty de la confidence
[18:23] that if there is something somebody i
[18:26] should talk to openly that's you see
[18:34] and vice versa vice versa if it's not
[18:38] if you don't know those things
[18:54] and i will also ask the old
[18:57] couples
[19:00] if you want to participate that's fine
[19:03] participation
[19:05] it may be from your experience some
[19:08] people can learn all yourself also you
[19:10] can learn
[19:12] experience
[19:18] i don't want to go in detail now so
[19:21] just be prepared for
[19:23] next sunday god willing
[19:33] if we can plan on
[19:35] ordering pizza
[19:41] this way we can talk
[19:44] easily they said manila on paper
[19:47] facility yeah because sometimes you
[19:50] marry people ask at the moment relation
[19:53] after five years a person come you will
[19:56] know that the very basic stuff they
[19:58] should have known they don't know
[20:06] and sometimes you see them having kids a
[20:08] performing boulevard
[20:10] but they don't know certain things in a
[20:12] south part that shows
[20:14] those who are married is that true say
[20:17] like somehow yes
[20:19] those who are married is that true
[20:22] yes
[20:24] is that true but uh
[20:27] yeah it's true
[20:29] so we trust that god is gonna help us

[23:34] la maniado

[24:11] voice or if it was a thought ella shows
[24:14] i didn't know

[24:36] the morning of
[24:37] wednesday
[24:40] so nothing was working for me
[24:43] i was like should i call the pastor or
[24:45] not
[24:47] okay let's see
[24:48] the voila i just listened to that uh
[24:50] inner voice
[24:53] and i arrived

[25:00] coughing a little bit
[25:02] meh a prela predication but after the
[25:04] preaching

[25:51] god you can see god sometimes in a very
[25:54] little things

[26:00] have a problem sometimes god allowed us
[26:02] a problem to show how great he can
[26:05] suffer
[26:36] must always depend on your inner voice
[26:42] and i believe god is still speaking
[26:47] and we have to have that sixth sense in
[26:50] the voices
[26:56] to tell you uh to see god in every
[26:59] aspect of life
[27:03] when something happened
[27:25] amen
[27:26] so i'm going to start this uh little
[27:30] series here you would recommend
[27:32] seriously
[27:35] that i'm going to speak on the
[27:37] time of a preparation for the rapture
[27:40] palestine
[27:44] and
[27:45] i will have
[27:46] the first part
[27:48] of the premier party
[27:50] that i will title the wedding job
[27:53] uh
[27:58] the wedding hope oh les
[28:09] there was a wedding robes
[28:13] different style
[28:15] the difference still different size
[28:18] different
[28:20] different thai et cetera a cd suite
[28:25] so the last series i preached the daniel
[28:31] it was on discerning times time and sign
[28:34] satisfied
[28:37] spoke about clay iran showing that
[28:41] the statute was completely destroyed
[28:51] so we have known all kind of signs
[28:58] we spoke about israel as a sign
[29:01] ladies
[29:03] and gentlemen we spoke about the seven
[29:06] visions that
[29:08] had in 1933
[29:15] we are experiencing the big sign of the
[29:18] pandemic
[29:20] like the program since
[29:25] and then uh we saw kamala in the office
[29:28] who's ava vika malaki mr president uh
[29:33] can you project me that picture
[29:37] how many so pretty president biden
[29:40] falling on the stairs one day
[29:49] the president is not really in a good
[29:52] health the president nepal and mambon
[29:54] sante and this article said
[29:57] articulated the woman kamala harris
[30:02] camalaris may soon be
[30:05] the usa president
[30:12] joe biden will be forced to resign for
[30:15] health problems joe biden sergeant for
[30:18] sale
[30:20] the missionary cause the problem of the
[30:22] center
[30:25] are you with this at the vo of xc
[30:28] so they are talking about joe biden
[30:32] by then he was going on this the stairs
[30:38] and then he slides and falls
[30:42] and he stood up he said
[30:45] he fall down again
[30:47] almost three times prepare two for which
[30:50] kind of president occasionally done
[30:54] so soon
[30:58] will be a big it will not be a surprise
[31:01] since i suppose and some are talking
[31:03] about his
[31:05] mental condition something like that
[31:12] so if something happened to him
[31:17] automatically kamala will be the
[31:19] president of the u.s automatic
[31:21] montgomery deviantart daisy
[31:24] so this is
[31:26] the picture
[31:28] laying ahead of us
[31:34] and also you will see
[31:36] speaking about the corona virus biology
[31:39] called aviaris
[31:41] the way the disease started
[31:51] everybody was focused on the disease
[31:55] vocalization
[31:57] but the way we are standing today
[32:02] i think we start looking at the picture
[32:04] differently
[32:09] so it started with
[32:11] the disease it's a common service
[32:14] and the people praying for
[32:17] solutions
[32:19] solution and the solution came in
[32:23] now
[32:24] now we have a people who have been fully
[32:27] vaccinated with the two doses
[32:30] completely vaccinated those
[32:33] but we have heard recently they are
[32:35] talking about the third
[32:38] dose
[32:40] 120
[32:43] who have received the third one
[32:45] yadda yadda does but if we go with the
[32:48] third for elsinoza vehicle attraction
[32:51] there will be a fourth you're in
[32:53] catherine now question yourself nadia
[32:56] mandevo what is this disease okay let's
[32:58] say maladie that in order to be cured
[33:02] you have to go to one two three
[33:04] number of vaccines
[33:12] i don't know
[33:13] you can say but
[33:15] lately in france it's a man first they
[33:19] are calling that thing um
[33:29] so that means before you go eat at a
[33:31] restaurant we will turn it three times
[33:33] in different restaurants
[33:45] no no
[33:48] and then my wife reminded me hey money
[33:50] we can use the vaccine we took two
[33:54] days ago to go visit the past and we are
[33:56] in the hospital
[34:01] and we took it
[34:03] that's where we were able to eat it
[34:08] but what's the point behind it
[34:12] you hope
[34:14] you cannot go to restaurant
[34:16] or restaurant without the vaccine some
[34:18] vaccine
[34:20] and the soon am i bientot and hope was
[34:23] telling me that i want to take a class
[34:26] but
[34:26] they said in order to be on campus you
[34:28] need to be vaccinated
[34:46] i'm not a scientist you're super
[34:48] scientific but i'm a preacher
[34:52] brother i think there is something
[34:54] behind those vaccines
[34:57] there you say vaccine
[35:02] up to this point
[35:05] up to this point uh just a point uh i'm
[35:08] not led to be vaccinated
[35:11] super conductor vaccine
[35:13] yeah and i'm still surviving
[35:17] the same god who healed me the moment
[35:20] i have a faith in him is your family but
[35:23] if it's the way god wants to take me
[35:25] home is my sister
[35:28] we will go
[35:30] but i will take that vaccine major
[35:32] progressive vaccine unless it becomes
[35:35] mandatory
[35:38] let me tell you the next target let's
[35:41] say what we do
[35:43] simpler portion now you cannot go to
[35:44] school now with the palladia call it's
[35:47] not the major it's in the past you
[35:49] cannot go to restaurants
[35:52] it's not the major personality problem
[35:54] the major is the problem a when do we
[35:57] say california you cannot attend the
[35:59] church
[36:04] then you become different
[36:08] all of these brothers and sisters to say
[36:10] foreign
[36:18] those signs that they were talking about
[36:21] you cannot sell you cannot buy you
[36:23] cannot do this it's visible
[36:30] it started like a
[36:32] a disease
[36:35] and then they say solution solution
[36:38] vaccine
[36:39] alone is only the solution only vaccine
[36:41] but to look at the direction the vaccine
[36:43] is taking when i regarded that direction
[36:45] that i cannot leave
[36:46] if you are spiritual she was a spiritual
[36:49] ah read between the line before learning
[36:52] and i'm not blaming those who are taking
[36:54] vaccine either
[36:57] like a friendly vaccine but you have to
[36:59] be
[37:00] to know what is taking place they would
[37:02] ever connect her sick is a person and i
[37:04] can tell you also this person
[37:07] from the disease
[37:09] de la maladey you know what to follow
[37:12] seki sweet it was
[37:14] cure cure cure
[37:17] but finally my final amount they
[37:20] injected something is all in shaytan
[37:23] people who don't have spiritual
[37:25] understanding lesion on pain
[37:27] comprehension spiritual they do stuff to
[37:30] blind them if on the shoulder
[37:34] you remember few months i was telling
[37:36] you i was completely completely against
[37:39] the stimulus
[37:46] but i think today everybody understand
[37:48] it everybody has seen the effects of the
[37:51] stimulus on the economy
[37:56] stimulation economy
[38:00] everything the price double
[38:10] we are now talking about four dollars a
[38:12] gallon in some spa
[38:19] the little stuff they used to buy for
[38:21] this match the price went completely up
[38:24] liberty
[38:30] what is the consequence
[38:33] is the stimulus say stimulus
[38:36] people are spend they have spent a lot
[38:38] of money
[38:41] now we come to a spot where
[38:44] announcement
[38:47] even the minimum wage mainly
[38:50] minima
[38:51] they used to pay people eight dollars an
[38:54] hour but now you cannot pay nobody eight
[38:57] you have to start at least 15 and up is
[39:00] available
[39:07] everything will go up
[39:11] and we are getting into a cycle in the
[39:13] sunshine and trade only circle and when
[39:16] they see
[39:17] price up it comes alive
[39:21] the governor will say we are going to
[39:23] increase the minimum wage
[39:28] minimum and then the price of
[39:30] commodities will go up
[39:34] the price of housing go up early
[39:38] the price of everything up it shows
[39:42] vague
[39:43] and then
[39:44] it's pushing in something that is alley
[39:47] to a point it's just a point where the
[39:50] government is going to give up
[39:54] we cannot afford this
[39:57] fare fast as you see
[39:59] because those who have a little theory
[40:01] of economy
[40:02] like young deputy economy the currency
[40:06] is based on gold la money
[40:34] that situation is called inflation the
[40:37] situation
[40:38] inflation and the contrary is deflation
[40:41] in a controversial deflation and the
[40:43] situation we are in is inflation
[40:45] illustration
[40:47] inflation prices are going up
[40:51] the prices are going up they pre-augment
[40:53] because the government passed
[40:56] but i can tell you this government has
[40:57] given a lot of money
[41:03] i'm not talking about the 1400 stimulus
[41:06] they give to individuals
[41:13] i can tell you this is something to make
[41:15] you sleep
[41:19] those who got the money they say lucky
[41:21] online
[41:22] those who got demanded stimulus package
[41:24] says
[41:25] stimulus
[41:27] and stimulus are the companies on the
[41:29] company the company has get
[41:32] associated millions
[41:42] and the situation is not going to get
[41:44] better
[41:50] soon it will come to the point where uh
[41:53] giving twenty dollars to somebody is
[41:56] nothing
[42:00] even
[42:08] now it's getting like to feel the tank
[42:11] is taking one hundred dollars

[50:11] but the churches melis themselves has
[50:15] become rich in san diego sierra except
[50:18] it's i accept us right i'll exception
[50:22] brother let me open a parentheses here
[50:25] it seems like
[50:26] we are not even able to pay for the
[50:28] building now
[50:36] people who contribute for the building
[50:38] they are very very limited
[50:43] we have asked you just for one hundred
[50:45] dollars a month to cover the mortgage
[50:52] the mortgage if i ask how many are
[50:55] paying brother you will be ashamed you
[50:57] will be surprised
[51:04] it's a commitment we took all together
[51:10] and we are sitting here you know
[51:13] we pay for the electrical bill
[51:18] electricity water toilet etc
[51:24] how comfortable you can be brother
[51:26] sister come on with the vettel
[51:28] comfortably first as well you never pay
[51:30] any penny
[51:34] and you say let anybody else do well
[51:39] this one will say let every any
[51:40] everybody else do
[51:47] it's not gonna work and how you will
[51:51] even feel comfortable addressing a
[51:53] prayer to god
[51:56] comfortably
[52:00] how comfortable are you getting money
[52:12] people who came here they say oh you
[52:13] have a nice sanctuary you have a nice
[52:15] place
[52:30] to complain if there is no word in the
[52:32] toilet we are going to complain senior
[52:34] padilla
[52:36] complained but who are you going to
[52:38] leave that burden onto me
[52:43] we dress well
[52:45] no perfume yeah
[52:47] nice cars like they're born over there
[52:49] but our duty as believers may not have
[52:53] the warranty
[52:55] we have to pay
[53:00] if i ask how many pairs brother it's a
[53:03] shame cj demand the combine pay for
[53:06] saturn want i can understand from time
[53:09] to time we may have problems we cannot
[53:11] it's understandable
[53:20] which kind of christian life are you
[53:22] living
[53:25] we are not forcing people for money for
[53:28] somebody
[53:29] because we know god will take care of
[53:31] and he has been taken care of
[53:36] but it's for your own benefit to to have
[53:39] your problem solved
[53:54] oh
[53:57] and then we are expecting to go into the
[53:59] rapture
[54:04] and we want god to help us
[54:09] you know i don't want really to talk
[54:11] about it go let's go back to this that
[54:13] was a nice parenthesis
[54:22] where is the code i was reading it
[54:25] okay
[54:26] so the churches have money earlier
[54:30] pretty near the wealth of the world say
[54:33] the bible
[54:35] appropriately la valor
[54:43] and that's why russia ran her out
[54:50] that's what we saw recently
[54:54] but the bottom line may uh lead my face
[54:57] oh thank you
[54:59] my my thought is my ponce
[55:02] this country is heading toward asking
[55:05] money from home cp
[55:08] level demand
[55:12] the more stimulus they will be generated
[55:15] yeah please invest
[55:18] the more this country is going to be
[55:20] broke
[55:24] and i don't know if you have heard this
[55:26] story
[55:28] one day enjoy
[55:30] you go you you do your tax refund the
[55:33] way you do
[55:34] the tax returns
[55:36] and they give you a paper
[55:40] we owe you
[55:41] forever
[55:43] the government is going to just give you
[55:44] a paper we owe you another
[56:08] it's like your child come to you say
[56:10] comfort my face give your voo i need
[56:12] this i need this
[56:15] you
[56:17] that come to the federal government
[56:22] but you will know that what i'm talking
[56:24] and what brother balam said is the
[56:25] absolute truth
[56:28] is
[56:33] even your million you have in the bank
[56:35] in your savings
[56:39] you will reach a spot you cannot ever
[56:41] access who's
[56:52] you are doing this you buy a lot of
[56:54] things
[56:56] it's not bad uh investigation
[57:01] but also they will see invest in the
[57:04] kingdom
[57:07] when they tell me we don't have money to
[57:09] pay for the place
[57:16] and uh we have to search somewhere to
[57:18] find the money and pay for
[57:22] example those who contribute efficiently
[57:25] see lucky contributor if you can smell
[57:28] god has a
[57:30] promise
[57:31] yeah you promise
[57:32] god will never owe you journey
[57:37] come on brother neville you did not take
[57:47] but the rest will never pay me
[57:51] amen
[57:52] but i think about this we have uh they
[57:54] told me sir we need to remind the church
[57:56] we need to remind each other say leave
[57:58] them alone
[58:05] but if out of 4 thousand that we have to
[58:08] pay the more to get utility insurance
[58:10] etc you may see on the wall they say
[58:12] that
[58:14] four thousand the carter
[58:16] utility
[58:18] only maybe five people paying one
[58:20] hundred dollars a month
[58:27] is where is it coming from
[58:31] but in the meantime
[58:34] it's also doing us good to invite other
[58:36] ministers to preach
[58:42] some we do pay the ticket for them we
[58:44] pay their hotel we feed them certainly
[58:50] i never asked the church we have a
[58:52] brother son so give the money so that we
[58:54] can give him an envelope
[59:00] our local ministers same thing no
[59:03] minister no code i'm sure they are doing
[59:05] their work before they travail we have
[59:07] to give them something to know they have
[59:09] also done so enjoy the sermon
[59:13] but you don't want to pay even
[59:16] more
[59:25] my business
[59:27] my faith amen amen
[59:30] but can you belong
[59:41] you also look at me
[59:44] otherwise it will be tomorrow if you
[59:47] come i put a bottom tape but
[59:49] no more visiting ministry you will be
[59:51] complaining
[1:00:06] but this church what are you doing for
[1:00:08] this church
[1:00:11] we start giving god the tips
[1:00:18] god doesn't need tips
[1:00:20] you take your engagement
[1:00:22] i don't know why i did not think about
[1:00:24] talking about this um
[1:00:32] amen amen
[1:00:36] how comfortable you will be even to bow
[1:00:38] your head to speak to god come on
[1:01:00] they never paid a title and offering
[1:01:03] since a long time so they don't know
[1:01:04] where to start
[1:01:06] from
[1:01:10] okay close that let us go to the message
[1:01:20] and the same problem is everywhere i
[1:01:22] travel
[1:01:40] i told them you know i can preach that
[1:01:42] don't think at your place a lot of
[1:01:44] education people probably they say they
[1:01:46] say
[1:01:47] what happened in my own church i am very
[1:01:50] shy
[1:02:03] because if i don't say it nobody else is
[1:02:06] going to do
[1:02:07] season 8
[1:02:10] and tomorrow
[1:02:17] tomorrow you will be saying why you
[1:02:18] didn't tell us this so we could pay the
[1:02:21] water and everything because it's cut
[1:02:23] off
[1:02:24] no
[1:02:25] i think the holy ghost is going to help
[1:02:27] each one of you is your fault especially
[1:02:35] with a good mind so this area i want to
[1:02:38] go with is the time of preparation for
[1:02:41] the rapture
[1:02:44] preparation
[1:02:46] and in order to prepare ourselves
[1:02:49] objectively
[1:02:50] as i said on wednesday
[1:02:53] i will be heading toward the baptism of
[1:02:56] the holy ghost and showing the mark of
[1:02:58] the beast as well
[1:03:00] about them to send
[1:03:03] because we have spoken all kinds of
[1:03:05] signs
[1:03:07] of the scene but knowledge of science is
[1:03:10] good
[1:03:12] but that knowledge must produce
[1:03:14] preparations
[1:03:26] and we read the bible in the book of
[1:03:28] revelations chapter 19. in uh biblically
[1:03:31] libra the apocalypse
[1:03:34] verses seven and eight verses
[1:03:37] let us be glad and rejoice and give
[1:03:40] honor to him
[1:03:42] for the marriage of the lamb is come and
[1:03:45] his wife has made herself ready
[1:03:56] and to her was granted that she should
[1:04:00] be erased in fine linen clean and white
[1:04:04] for the final linen is the righteousness
[1:04:07] of saints
[1:04:14] [Music]
[1:04:19] amen amen so that's the hope we are
[1:04:22] talking about may god bless the reading
[1:04:24] of the scriptures
[1:04:30] you may be seated
[1:04:34] the wedding robe
[1:04:37] how many know that the wedding hope is
[1:04:39] the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:04:45] that's what is taking place the sake is
[1:04:47] a past man and god has taught the church
[1:04:50] in many ways
[1:04:54] with a practical example of vectors
[1:04:57] example particle and when there is a
[1:05:00] wedding
[1:05:04] the bride less
[1:05:06] always comes with a white robe viento ju
[1:05:10] aveca in rob blanche we've never seen a
[1:05:14] wedding a bride coming with a yellow
[1:05:17] pink uh
[1:05:18] whatever color they have chosen nunavun
[1:05:25] [Music]
[1:05:36] they give you different colors
[1:05:39] but those colors are only for the
[1:05:42] decorations
[1:05:45] to dress the the bride made
[1:05:48] the
[1:06:02] no white paint but the pantalon
[1:06:05] blanche
[1:06:07] no
[1:06:08] no white skirt
[1:06:10] by the
[1:06:11] uh
[1:06:12] the ship launch
[1:06:14] but always a robe
[1:06:24] because it's the righteousness work of
[1:06:26] the saints basketball
[1:06:30] and you will see that rob
[1:06:32] said rob is always spotless at it
[1:06:37] have you seen a bride walking with a
[1:06:39] white robe they have evil deja vu in a
[1:06:42] pose martial viking of black will stain
[1:06:44] on the back blue yellow pink avec
[1:06:48] no spotless this is sometimes that's
[1:06:51] what the bible is saying
[1:06:54] in the last days
[1:06:55] according to ephesians 5 ephesians
[1:07:09] is what god has been working for all
[1:07:11] those years is he said
[1:07:15] that he might present it to himself a
[1:07:18] glorious church
[1:07:20] until remember in english glorious
[1:07:22] not having a spot no nepal
[1:07:26] detached
[1:07:33] but it should be holy and without the
[1:07:35] blemish do i present a song
[1:07:40] some blam
[1:07:54] and why
[1:07:56] now if i asked those recently married
[1:07:58] nasi she demanded six somalia
[1:08:01] sharon where is your
[1:08:02] uh
[1:08:03] white robe
[1:08:06] what uh
[1:08:07] what
[1:08:08] where is it
[1:08:13] huh
[1:08:14] sisterhood
[1:08:15] where's your white home
[1:08:18] of the closet
[1:08:20] i saw sharon white robe somewhere is in
[1:08:23] the house
[1:08:29] so that means we need that white robe
[1:08:32] it's a verdict
[1:08:33] based on the setup
[1:08:35] after i pray the
[1:08:46] but look at the effort that was made
[1:08:49] regardless
[1:09:04] you go to the closet you look at the
[1:09:06] hope
[1:09:08] and it closes
[1:09:10] the day i will be in leisure
[1:09:12] so that's showing that the mind of the
[1:09:15] bride is in the hopes
[1:09:19] so the mind of the spiritual bride is in
[1:09:22] the baptism of the holy ghost the spirit
[1:09:24] the
[1:09:25] spirituality that they but them do you
[1:09:26] send this today god is going to give me
[1:09:29] the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:09:32] you sent this prayer that's
[1:09:56] it takes a lot of work surface that the
[1:09:58] man
[1:09:59] you have to work for have to get that to
[1:10:01] work
[1:10:04] all the girls they totally fear they go
[1:10:07] find the best hope they can find you
[1:10:09] someone trained
[1:10:11] i'm looking for the best of the best
[1:10:18] so this is really what the church is
[1:10:20] after it says
[1:10:22] something in my second legislature a lot
[1:10:25] of effort
[1:10:26] therefore sleepless oh son so maybe
[1:10:30] they stepped all the years sleeping
[1:10:33] sleeping no sleep dude
[1:10:38] i want that hope
[1:10:42] but to look at all the effort may
[1:10:44] regardless therefore
[1:10:46] in one day that's enjoyed all the effort
[1:10:49] over there's the four sofini you take
[1:10:51] the robe
[1:10:53] dump it
[1:10:55] and the other thing about their wedding
[1:10:57] home eh you know
[1:10:59] [Music]
[1:11:00] i was teasing maybe with sharon you
[1:11:02] don't really thank you
[1:11:04] oh those robes are very expensive why
[1:11:06] don't you take julia oldham
[1:11:09] tell me
[1:11:24] the bride of christ needs a genuine
[1:11:26] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:11:31] the sentence
[1:11:33] not a second and hope i can show the
[1:11:36] second man everybody is longing for the
[1:11:39] right genuine hope
[1:11:44] yeah
[1:11:45] so the hope
[1:11:48] is what is really important in
[1:11:51] the salvation secretary
[1:11:55] amen amen so let me get into a parable
[1:11:59] here in the same one and praying daniel
[1:12:01] does
[1:12:02] see uh let's take our bible
[1:12:06] in the book of matthew chapter 22. then
[1:12:08] laylee for the matches
[1:12:10] you are gonna find some what i'm why i'm
[1:12:12] talking about the white house
[1:12:17] matthew chapter 22 matthew
[1:12:22] there was a parable you have been
[1:12:24] powerful
[1:12:26] that jesus spoke
[1:12:32] from the first verse
[1:12:36] and this is the core of my message
[1:12:42] and jesus answered and speak unto them
[1:12:46] again by parable and said jesus
[1:13:03] and you will see how brother branham
[1:13:05] interpret this parable for us
[1:13:10] the kingdom of heaven is like a certain
[1:13:13] king which made a marriage for his son
[1:13:18] [Music]
[1:13:30] god is that king
[1:13:33] and his way he's willing to make a body
[1:13:36] for his son jesus
[1:13:40] put some faces jesus
[1:13:42] and his son jesus has to have a bride a
[1:13:45] sophisticated developer in a puzzle and
[1:13:48] like every wedding party they come that
[1:13:50] shack fed to the mariachi you invite the
[1:13:52] people it was in vitalization but
[1:13:54] sometimes maybe four some of the mvps
[1:13:58] certainly
[1:14:06] and he sent forth his servant to call
[1:14:09] them that were beaten to the wedding and
[1:14:12] they would
[1:14:22] again he sent forth other servants
[1:14:25] saying
[1:14:25] tell them which are beaten behold i have
[1:14:29] prepared my dinner
[1:14:31] my
[1:14:33] oven and my uh uh
[1:14:36] faithlings are killed and all things are
[1:14:39] ready come into
[1:14:50] [Music]
[1:14:54] wait a minute here go back to that first
[1:14:55] four just let me double check here
[1:15:09] they said dinner
[1:15:12] brother said
[1:15:15] here it's not a matter of dinner this is
[1:15:17] a prime problem the dna eat a matter of
[1:15:20] supper say them problem day it's a
[1:15:22] wedding supper
[1:15:25] it's not a breakfast it's nepali it's
[1:15:27] not a lunch
[1:15:28] it's a mother of supper uh satan problem
[1:15:31] day super next verse universe
[1:15:34] but they made the light of it and went
[1:15:37] their ways
[1:15:38] one to his farm another to his
[1:15:41] merchandise
[1:15:50] and the remnant took his servant and
[1:15:53] untreated them uh spitefully and slew
[1:15:57] them
[1:16:04] but when the king heard thereof he was
[1:16:07] rough and he signed forth his armies and
[1:16:11] destroyed those murders and burned up
[1:16:14] their city
[1:16:16] every day
[1:16:23] then he said he to his servant
[1:16:26] their wedding is ready but they which
[1:16:29] were beaten were not worthy allah is
[1:16:40] therefore into the highways and as many
[1:16:44] as you shall find bid to the
[1:16:53] so those servants went
[1:16:56] out into the highways and gathered
[1:16:59] together all as many as they found
[1:17:02] both had
[1:17:04] both bad and good and the wedding was
[1:17:07] furnished with guests
[1:17:18] and when the king came
[1:17:20] in to see the guests he saw that
[1:17:24] he saw there a man which had not a
[1:17:27] wedding garment
[1:17:38] and he said unto him friend how comets
[1:17:40] thou in higher not having a wedding
[1:17:43] garment and he was speechless
[1:17:56] then he said a king to the servant bind
[1:17:59] him
[1:18:00] hand and foot and take him away and cast
[1:18:03] him into the outer darkness there shall
[1:18:06] be weeping and gnashing of teeth hello
[1:18:34] it's about what is taking place with the
[1:18:36] wedding
[1:18:38] is
[1:18:40] so the king had a party for his son
[1:18:44] infected post office
[1:18:47] his son has to get married with a bride
[1:18:49] from this device in my awkwardness
[1:18:52] and then they noticed the party what's
[1:18:53] going on
[1:18:56] they add all the meat
[1:18:58] all the food already
[1:19:00] everything ready but i have to fly you
[1:19:02] have to fly i chose it everything was
[1:19:04] ready
[1:19:05] and then they allowed the
[1:19:13] it's like
[1:19:15] you start the service they come with
[1:19:16] come and sell your services those who
[1:19:18] supposed to be in the service they are
[1:19:20] not there
[1:19:49] the show's the machine he got mad
[1:19:51] you you say
[1:19:52] and then
[1:19:54] he sent the army
[1:19:56] like me
[1:19:57] no more the servant
[1:20:00] but he said the army
[1:20:03] and is killed others visitors you had to
[1:20:05] wait to the visitor and then oh yeah
[1:20:07] they started wondering
[1:20:09] why does this thing happen like this
[1:20:12] is a person come see
[1:20:13] so they keep asking they keep asking
[1:20:16] what's going on
[1:20:22] sometimes we are negligent to the
[1:20:24] invitation god is sending to us they
[1:20:27] found some negligence invitation
[1:20:30] and the brother said
[1:20:56] [Music]
[1:20:59] is explaining the way the wedding
[1:21:01] happened in the oriental the february
[1:21:04] speaker
[1:21:07] in oriental halloween when we invite the
[1:21:10] people to the wedding confidence

[1:21:41] the park
[1:21:43] so that when you get into the party guns

[1:21:51] ah this one dress very well seriously
[1:21:54] this one is not very well this one is
[1:21:56] not very weird
[1:21:58] that's what people do in the the
[1:22:01] our side is a second legion they're not
[1:22:03] talking that's why in the time of the
[1:22:05] bible
[1:22:07] when we invite the people to the wedding
[1:22:09] with the invitation
[1:22:10] but those things are the type of the
[1:22:12] spiritual first sessions only tip of the
[1:22:15] spirituality
[1:22:17] number two
[1:22:18] one day we invite the people to the
[1:22:20] wedding comes in vitiligo it's the
[1:22:38] when god invite the people for jesus
[1:22:40] wedding can join with example
[1:22:43] it's god providing the hope
[1:22:47] and that to obey is the baptism of the
[1:22:49] holy ghost he said to blasted by them
[1:22:51] you sent us
[1:22:53] you have to enter by the door
[1:22:57] and the bible said
[1:22:58] jesus christ is the dog
[1:23:04] amen so everybody a child in order to
[1:23:07] get to the wedding party
[1:23:10] you have to have your white love develop
[1:23:13] what a robber
[1:23:14] and that white hope must be provided by
[1:23:17] god except for blasphemy
[1:23:19] which is the type of the baptism of the
[1:23:22] holy ghost just yelling deeply about
[1:23:23] them you said and everybody has to eat
[1:23:26] by the door
[1:23:28] now during the party may not pander as
[1:23:31] he send the people go grab the mvp
[1:23:36] did not show up elizabeth
[1:23:39] and then he sent a healing campaign
[1:23:45] the healing campaign only they gave his
[1:23:47] own yeah because they said
[1:23:50] because the nvidia did not show up come
[1:23:52] listen to some people go now look for
[1:23:55] the sick people
[1:23:59] my life their people
[1:24:11] now i'm going to give the opportunity
[1:24:14] to the rest of the people the
[1:24:16] restoration and the bible says
[1:24:19] good and bad
[1:24:23] amen amen so the good and the bad they
[1:24:25] came
[1:24:26] in
[1:24:28] after they seated the table i'll break
[1:24:30] his
[1:24:30] situation now the king started passing
[1:24:33] by every table
[1:24:37] i'll be the best by passing by every
[1:24:39] table
[1:24:41] and he's a
[1:24:42] job sure that everybody in the room was
[1:24:46] dressed
[1:24:53] everybody has the white robe
[1:24:56] and he finally discovered somebody if
[1:24:59] not my laptop
[1:25:00] with a different kind of coat avec uh
[1:25:03] the situation
[1:25:04] caught
[1:25:05] the vest
[1:25:08] then he went yeah
[1:25:39] see
[1:25:40] your son but over there somebody eat by
[1:25:42] the door
[1:25:45] and then jesus said hey
[1:25:47] take him
[1:25:49] bind him by the foot and then the
[1:25:50] enemies
[1:25:52] and
[1:26:06] amen i mean so that's what happened in
[1:26:08] the orientation
[1:26:11] so if it has to happen here
[1:26:14] you see every good a shack mario you
[1:26:16] must buy for the wife uh white wolf
[1:26:20] [Music]
[1:26:33] you go buy the dress for me
[1:26:37] we have to go back in the time of the
[1:26:38] bible
[1:26:42] the government's to buy for the hope
[1:26:46] because the group is the
[1:26:48] provider
[1:27:03] throwing the coat all the time the
[1:27:04] pastel that looks so good meant nasa
[1:27:08] god bless you your business
[1:27:10] this is the adoption time
[1:27:12] adoption
[1:27:14] let's go back to the the prophet
[1:27:59] they are still leaving them same custom
[1:28:03] that they did then continue
[1:28:07] now
[1:28:08] in this place now you see the way the
[1:28:10] example was made
[1:28:12] not
[1:28:15] matthew 22 gives a very good description
[1:28:18] of it
[1:28:20] description of the salah this is where
[1:28:22] we read matthew 22 i love only my
[1:28:24] traveling now brother is explaining to
[1:28:27] us that
[1:28:30] he said
[1:28:31] if you go to the eastern you go to
[1:28:33] israel then the bible become a new book
[1:28:40] because the way we read we understand
[1:28:42] the things here is different completely
[1:28:44] from the context of the bible
[1:28:51] and that's why we have a prophet he's a
[1:28:53] conservative
[1:28:54] that he said in the book of matthew call
[1:28:56] me didn't matthew vendee
[1:29:00] that there was a king who edison
[1:29:03] and rocky avenphis
[1:29:05] and he made a supper for his son
[1:29:07] felix
[1:29:30] that the king of heaven was having a
[1:29:32] supper for his son christ jesus kelly
[1:29:36] what
[1:29:51] jesus possible
[1:29:52] and if you would watch the setting as we
[1:29:55] try to dig into it
[1:30:00] and and find the setting the way they
[1:30:03] suffer and to be arranged
[1:30:15] it's a very beautiful picture of the
[1:30:17] coming of the son of god
[1:30:20] image
[1:30:22] defeats the deer and the wedding supper
[1:30:24] that we are all going to one of these
[1:30:27] days
[1:30:31] so that means the wedding is happening
[1:30:33] we are going into one of these days
[1:30:39] there is a door yeah important and there
[1:30:41] is a wedding
[1:30:46] we are born again of the spirit of god
[1:30:49] you summoned the nouveau avec let's pray
[1:30:50] that you beautiful try again amen
[1:30:56] now
[1:30:57] he said
[1:30:59] the first thing they
[1:31:09] are allowed to come in to come to the
[1:31:12] supper unless they are invited
[1:31:28] how do you respond to the invitation
[1:31:34] you have to be invited first before you
[1:31:37] go to any dinner of that time
[1:31:42] i ended
[1:31:48] i'm just old-fashioned enough to believe
[1:31:52] it is still supper
[1:31:55] they do not
[1:32:13] [Music]
[1:32:52] you would not go anyhow
[1:32:55] important you are a poacher was that a
[1:32:59] and for them and that wouldn't be right
[1:33:03] you would be disqualified you say regis
[1:33:06] califia
[1:33:17] that when he is going to have a great
[1:33:20] support set
[1:33:24] to a celebration for his son the lord
[1:33:27] jesus who has pleased him in every way
[1:33:30] in celebration
[1:33:33] jesus
[1:33:36] and god the father is inviting those who
[1:33:39] he chooses
[1:33:44] jesus said yes
[1:33:46] no man can come to me except my father
[1:33:48] invite him first
[1:33:54] that's right
[1:33:56] no man can come to me except he has an
[1:33:59] invitation for my father
[1:34:23] you must be happy that god has extended
[1:34:26] his invitation
[1:34:44] but once the invitation is extended to
[1:34:47] you
[1:34:50] it's a matter of joy setting problems
[1:34:53] you did not feast yet
[1:34:56] you did not eat yet

[1:35:55] in the message than a message

[1:41:20] of the holy ghost
[1:41:22] you sent his spirit in this time of
[1:41:23] preparation
[1:41:25] the preparation every believer you shall
[1:41:28] acquire whatever you are painful to give
[1:41:30] you have to work for the baptism of the
[1:41:32] holy spirit
[1:41:35] baptism for the holy spirit
[1:41:37] you sentence you will not enter
[1:41:40] and if you manage to enter somehow
[1:41:57] so the way god has been prepared
[1:42:02] it's the white hope say la hover blind
[1:42:04] sure as we do the wedding i look in the
[1:42:06] face
[1:42:07] you'll see the bride coming in the white
[1:42:09] house
[1:42:12] that the
[1:42:24] you have to be prepared and that's the
[1:42:26] thing we need
[1:42:53] saying that the water is going to quite
[1:42:56] require the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:43:02] tradition
[1:43:04] the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:43:07] is coming to a divine vaccine
[1:43:10] then vaccine divine amen amen and their
[1:43:13] prescription was a great what energy
[1:43:15] that prescribed their fetter by the dog
[1:43:18] dr simon peter apparently doctor simon
[1:43:20] peter says the prescription is for you
[1:43:49] for the holy spirit
[1:44:03] tomorrow he's behind the woman the the
[1:44:06] man that they really fight i questioned
[1:44:08] that baptism was the holy spirit the man
[1:44:09] they said about them you said because
[1:44:11] the baptism of the holy ghost asked me
[1:44:12] about them you said it is the person of
[1:44:14] christ in you sell a person
[1:44:17] i don't see christ after woman asian
[1:44:20] vapor christian the really family no no
[1:44:22] they're here the baptism of the holy
[1:44:24] ghost the very table about them you sent
[1:44:25] this after the inspector you say they're
[1:44:28] yellow inspector as the inspector
[1:44:31] watches your life they can't expect a
[1:44:33] regard for that why not listen to the
[1:44:35] message you've heard okay
[1:44:38] we are here just to talk a little bit so
[1:44:40] concentrate to listen to the message
[1:44:44] to the messiah that's the most important
[1:44:46] thing the last show is
[1:44:59] amen amen and when you say amen become
[1:45:02] vegetarian you are being receiving god
[1:45:06] there is a what you done
[1:45:08] amen amen
[1:45:11] sometimes rather
[1:45:13] when we come we have to be very very
[1:45:15] concentrated because
[1:45:18] three concerns like sometimes it
[1:45:19] disturbs the preacher
[1:45:23] so uh let me go to the scripture
[1:45:27] god's provided way love
[1:46:07] [Music]
[1:46:09] that's the reason why
[1:46:22] everybody come here for their purpose
[1:46:23] you can visit objective and that's the
[1:46:26] main thing
[1:46:28] there will be little interaction to
[1:46:30] strengthen some people
[1:46:34] but you come also for your own son first
[1:46:55] he found one there without a wedding
[1:46:57] garment
[1:47:00] why that's very typical
[1:47:04] in the oriental times
[1:47:19] that's the way it is
[1:47:21] in this affair too
[1:47:25] the wedding serpent we are going to let
[1:47:28] them know
[1:47:30] nobody is going to bring their own hope
[1:47:32] this young person
[1:47:34] and then
[1:47:38] [Music]
[1:48:02] there
[1:48:06] because sometimes without the baptism of
[1:48:08] the holy ghost the basket the first

[2:38:54] of
[2:39:21] there will always be
[2:39:36] you be a servant of christ

[2:40:22] garments ready
[2:40:24] for be praying amen amen that's the main
[2:40:28] thing today
[2:40:29] people get a lot of confusion in their
[2:40:31] minds
[2:40:46] which is the baptism of the holy ghost
[2:40:50] you will get the power of the battle you
[2:40:52] will get the baptism
[2:40:54] that never happens
[2:40:58] to the time of preparation
[2:41:00] from
[2:41:05] [Music]
[2:41:10] and that's what this preparation is
[2:41:11] about
[2:41:13] you can change churches
[2:41:16] if you don't change yourself it will
[2:41:18] transfer to a church changing
[2:41:21] it's like men changing addresses
[2:41:25] you will still remain the same
[2:41:27] remember i've seen a brother jeffy and
[2:41:30] friend in the message that's a message
[2:41:31] he changed the church he last changed
[2:41:33] please hey he moved he died he went to
[2:41:35] jeffersonville
[2:41:36] oh pastor pastor i got the car
[2:41:39] and the brother joseph prayed for the
[2:41:40] car yeah
[2:41:42] after a certain
[2:41:56] oh
[2:42:10] make your
[2:42:11] steady a forfeit of preparation bread
[2:42:15] and then we will continue with the other
[2:42:17] type of preparations
[2:42:21] when you do a real preparation
[2:42:23] very tableau paper it's like that woman
[2:42:25] in the bible second set from the bible
[2:42:27] when she realized a piece was missing
[2:42:38] she took a book
[2:42:53] the rapture will take place
[2:42:56] am i going
[2:42:59] to do i have the white robe
[2:43:03] oh i am a bride mate
[2:43:07] i'm here
[2:43:09] accompanying the bride yes
[2:43:12] i say my amen
[2:43:14] i pay my tithe
[2:43:16] i pay my offerings
[2:43:17] just for one break it's just a poor
[2:43:19] insulin think about
[2:43:58] you can call the church any name fair
[2:44:00] poverty listen important people are
[2:44:03] changing the name of the church
[2:44:16] it doesn't do anything
[2:44:18] marion what is more important
[2:44:21] you in christ
[2:44:23] doing a constant inventory
[2:44:27] so the white robe
[2:44:30] is the real baptism of the holy ghost
[2:44:34] and i thank god by god's grace
[2:44:38] in that direction
[2:44:40] direction
[2:44:41] to wake up people poop over revelation
[2:44:43] to start seeking the real baptism
[2:44:48] and if you said i got the baptism
[2:44:52] there a way to check yeah
[2:44:55] number one you know
[2:44:57] make sure that's your review
[2:45:28] which kind of holy ghost you can
[2:45:30] challenge this oh i received the lord
[2:45:31] only caused a long time jerusalem
[2:45:34] the holy ghost
[2:45:36] never even forgive anybody
[2:45:40] you do something to me
[2:45:51] you know me for a long time i don't like
[2:45:53] this thing i cannot
[2:45:54] bear that
[2:46:09] that god forgave yes
[2:46:12] as forgive
[2:46:14] about those
[2:46:15] always ready to forgive you prayer
[2:46:18] regardless of he doesn't await different
[2:46:21] sins
[2:46:32] and you can check it yourself you put
[2:46:34] your face over me how do you react
[2:46:37] maybe that person said do a certain
[2:46:39] experience other guys
[2:46:41] maybe he killed your son
[2:46:43] he killed your daughter maybe you are
[2:46:44] only begotten
[2:46:48] maybe they are only begotten uh
[2:46:50] joseph
[2:47:04] is satanic speech
[2:47:09] questions
[2:47:11] that's a question about holy ghost
[2:47:13] sentence
[2:47:15] regardless of you
[2:47:18] forgive me brother pardon my father
[2:47:20] father i forgive you with all my heart
[2:47:22] the flesh depends on your tumor care
[2:47:24] even before you ask for forgiveness
[2:47:27] there is no bitterness in your body the
[2:47:29] heart where the holy ghost dwells
[2:47:45] for which god forgive me every day
[2:47:50] god forgive me
[2:47:52] and when god forgive me
[2:47:53] the bible said that people you have to
[2:47:55] forgive others
[2:47:57] that's not the holy ghost
[2:47:59] that means you receive something
[2:48:00] different
[2:48:02] the holy ghost
[2:48:04] is the deity in you
[2:48:06] god in you
[2:48:08] if god forgives you
[2:48:10] forgive yourself
[2:48:12] forgive your husband
[2:48:29] that's the evidence that's an if you
[2:48:31] dance
[2:48:32] that came into my mind i said give me
[2:48:34] the money
[2:48:35] ah god
[2:48:37] is your life worthy of the gospel
[2:48:39] i don't know
[2:48:41] i think paragraph 62 something a
[2:48:43] paragraph sunday evidence of the holy
[2:48:46] ghost leave you dance with yourself
[2:48:49] you have to cope with every word
[2:49:12] just type uh cope with uh
[2:49:15] the word love your enemy
[2:49:18] that's what that kept just in my mind so
[2:49:21] that's the evidence of the holy ghost
[2:49:23] that's a levity
[2:49:24] don't be confused that's why confused if
[2:49:26] you are not sure it's the genuine
[2:49:28] baptism of the holy ghost you will not
[2:49:30] pass through the
[2:49:31] battle sentence
[2:49:32] through a certain experience that passed
[2:49:34] by certain experiences it's an
[2:49:36] invitation
[2:49:38] look for the
[2:49:46] without the sensation sun sensation and
[2:49:49] you know the story of uh
[2:49:51] george smith we're going to say started

[2:50:23] without a real experience first
[2:50:26] of all experience your your baptism of
[2:50:28] the holy ghost oh what about but then

[2:51:20] you willing to if you have the holy
[2:51:21] ghost you will not
