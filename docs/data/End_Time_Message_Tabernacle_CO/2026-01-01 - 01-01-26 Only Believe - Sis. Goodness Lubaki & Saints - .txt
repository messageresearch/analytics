TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Sometimes [singing and music] we pray, "Father, let [music] this cup pass from me. But [singing] now we cry out just once more [music] Lord on bended [singing] knees. Lord [singing] we see just [music] one touch of the hem of your [singing] garment. It brought [music] change and full deliverance. So I'm [singing] casting off the air, but [music] there's power in prayer. [singing] Only believe. Only believe. [singing] [music] You'll let nothing stand in [singing] your way. All issues of blood, [singing and music] all troubles and confusion will have [singing and music] to go back through hell's gates. You [singing and music] put your feet on the necks of these kings [music] and look [singing] to the bleeding lamb that was slain. and only believe. [singing] [music] Just trust and confess it and you'll [singing] receive. [music] Our prophets long, saints, [singing and music] we long to see that seventh above. Lord, now we [singing and music] long for you to come [singing] fill us now. [music] Sweet Holy Spirit, sweet [singing] heavenly [music] dove, root over us. Lord, [music and singing] find your resting place in our hearts. [music] And we only believe [singing] you let nothing stand in [music and singing] our way. All [music and singing] issues, the blood, all troubles and confusion will have to go back [singing and music] through hell gates. We put your [music and singing] feet on and answer these gates. [singing and music] We look to the bleeding lamb that was slain and only [singing] believe. Just trust [music] and confess it and will receive. [music] The Lord is my rock, [singing] my light and salvation. In him I [music] believe and by [singing] his blood I rebuke all lying vanities for host shouldn't camp against me to release fear and insecurities Yet I stand confident, Lord, that you will [music and singing] keep and deliver me. Oh Lord, may I only believe you let nothing [singing] stand in our way. All issues of blood, all troubles and [music] confusion. Who have to go back through hell? Who will put your feet [singing and music] on and answer these things? We look to the [singing and music] bleeding limb that was laid and we only believe. Just trust and confess it [music] and you'll [singing] receive. The dove is saying shalom, shalom, [singing] shalom, [music] peace [singing] be unto you. Troubles all are over. &gt;&gt; Shalom. Shalom. Shalom. [singing] On [music] the wings of that seven [singing] dove. I hear her hear him saying [music] shalom. Shalom. [singing] Shalom. Peace be unto [singing and music] you. New year. &gt;&gt; Shalom. Shalom. [singing] Shalom. On [music] the wings of the [singing] seventh, I hear him [music] saying, &gt;&gt; "Shalom, shalom, shalom. [music] Peace be unto [singing] you." Troubles all are over. &gt;&gt; Shalom. Shalom. [singing] Shalom. [music] On the wings [singing] of that seven. On the wings. &gt;&gt; On [music and singing] the wings of that seven. On the wings. On [singing and music] the wings. &gt;&gt; You are the only &gt;&gt; [applause and music]
