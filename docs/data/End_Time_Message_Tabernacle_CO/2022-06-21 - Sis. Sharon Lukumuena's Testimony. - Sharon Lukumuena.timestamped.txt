[0:00] make up the seasonings I just want to
[0:06] thank the Lord for what he's done in my
[0:08] family
[0:09] pupils like love based on what about me
[0:12] he's truly done miracles and wonders in
[0:15] my family in me like a birthday or not
[0:18] about me as many of you know my parents
[0:24] were sick behind him a lot and I just
[0:27] want to kind of relate how it all
[0:29] started in how God healed them hey come
[0:33] suck it open also come on Julie's are
[0:34] getting so it all started a couple
[0:36] months ago she wants to get the apostate
[0:39] Justin my kid was a cold
[0:41] hey somebody comes to that you're saying
[0:43] if you have much just like we have the
[0:45] regular cool that's what it was my
[0:47] latitude but as time went on a retention
[0:53] rate
[0:53] they just weren't healing from the cold
[0:55] hey mr. Gillis it but you said malady
[0:57] and it just seemed like the symptoms are
[0:59] getting worse and worse
[1:00] anyways ridiculous them don't stay some
[1:03] period we started trying to treat our
[1:05] home with Tylenol and all the
[1:09] medications no comedy nothing was
[1:17] getting better yeah okay so at that
[1:20] point I believe mom was the one who was
[1:22] really worst at that time I believed at
[1:26] that time mom was getting worse really
[1:27] bad at that time there's a bucket so we
[1:32] decided to call the doctor and see what
[1:34] we can do we can prepare and just like
[1:38] they're telling people just stay home
[1:40] don't come under needless telomeres only
[1:43] variable we don't have any treatment for
[1:45] you or anything stay home then I want
[1:48] buddy medicine they may become approval
[1:49] on his own but the medicine at home
[1:51] wasn't helping middle America Makino's a
[1:54] few animals only depart so we took her
[1:56] to the hospital alone is all about money
[1:59] I love you Doug since we don't we're
[2:00] allowed to go in me and dad waited in
[2:02] the car and she was in the hospital
[2:03] skinning they jump up tell me don't slow
[2:06] down
[2:07] kill my mobile after a while I go
[2:09] checking her doing different exams
[2:11] different different tests on her I play
[2:13] keys on Facebook we do they come enjoy
[2:15] well they just said that you know
[2:16] there's nothing we can do for her
[2:18] you're gonna be in you're gonna just go
[2:20] home and continue cheating it the way
[2:22] you were cheating it
[2:25] they gave us they give us a medication
[2:27] he's not gonna give me come on when I
[2:29] looked at the medication they can't
[2:31] really call this a medic and the
[2:32] symptoms that she was having a meal of
[2:35] it he had nothing to do that the
[2:36] medication was completely wrong they
[2:38] made a medical might've come out of the
[2:41] elderly diamond a symptom caliphate so I
[2:44] kind of lost my faith in the hospital
[2:46] like they're making mistakes to giving
[2:47] people the wrong medication every month
[2:50] on this opportunity Hyundai mobis made
[2:52] it made it come on so we just continued
[2:54] at home watching giving them treatment
[2:56] you know somebody's telling me they do
[2:59] not admit this team and I notice also
[3:00] dad started getting worse anyways
[3:03] am i picking my belt my daddy says on
[3:05] coffee OC and we decided to go I decided
[3:08] to say both of them to the hospital they
[3:13] did the same thing you don't put a
[3:14] Memphis x-rays images trying to see
[3:17] what's going on as long as they don't
[3:18] like out there sticking out your paw and
[3:19] I believe they saw some kind of you know
[3:23] something going on in the lung some kind
[3:25] of pneumonia it shows no need for more
[3:28] it just gives some kind of small
[3:29] breathing treatments although there's so
[3:31] many come on Pumas give us you know and
[3:33] they sent us back home where time is on
[3:36] a home it just felt like I would call
[3:39] different doctors different nurses what
[3:41] can I do
[3:42] alum is not ability doctor lady yeah
[3:48] everyone was coming up with their own
[3:50] suggestion give them this give them that
[3:54] so I tried everything that anyone told
[3:58] me they just a circular saw my baby
[3:59] mother they fell and it just seemed like
[4:01] nothing was getting better
[4:03] he felt like it getting any more now on
[4:05] stay

[8:36] mother come off every little minute
[8:38] and he prayed for mom before going to
[8:40] the hospital and he put the prayer cloth
[8:44] also on her hey did you see the flop on
[8:48] a memory level and then we went to the
[8:50] hospital they decided to keep her there
[8:53] the money be like I'll be alone I came
[8:56] back home in the next morning I went
[8:58] there tonight I miss all the times
[9:00] people
[9:01] I called her first before going there
[9:03] and she told me bring me this sort of
[9:05] stuff that she was forgetting and
[9:06] something to eat mystical ability
[9:09] element I mean it on I brought it to the
[9:11] hospital
[9:12] badal and when I arrived today to make

[9:31] visitors you can get contaminated in
[9:34] Maldives you start the policy on Tracy
[9:36] to come visit other contamination so we
[9:38] went back and forth back and forth to
[9:40] come style a little cool they do they
[9:42] just didn't let me go in uniform minutes
[9:44] don't play so I I left the hospital and
[9:47] on my way out I got a call I love dr.
[9:50] Peter Kahn just off the on my plate it

[9:54] nurse they let me do not let me get I
[9:57] told you that I told you what just
[9:59] happened
[10:00] and she told me she's like I told you
[10:03] not to take her to the hospital Monday
[10:05] nearly powerful they don't want to get
[10:07] to see her because they know what
[10:08] they're gonna do to her in a third
[10:10] bucket which the opposite sounds like
[10:11] him I felt they're probably just trying
[10:13] to kill her and they don't want you to
[10:14] see like your pocket which wall so I was
[10:18] I was panicking at that point I was like
[10:20] okay I don't you take bunny came to do
[10:23] okay so they're just probably gonna
[10:25] carved a few days and tell me that she's
[10:27] gone if one's just a mop it up okay so I
[10:29] made a kill em all so I came back home
[10:31] that day mr. solo
[10:33] checking on dad the girl know she'll be
[10:35] on my bail he lost so much weight they
[10:39] have a belt you for magic wall I saw him
[10:41] even though he was he stood up hey Nick
[10:44] and he had to hold his pants like this
[10:47] because I saw actually his pants can I
[10:50] stay up they want only people your
[10:53] company please
[10:53] so I was I was looking at everything I
[10:55] just started crying to God
[10:57] Gela God that to stop the other belt you
[10:59] like why are you allowing this Medusa
[11:02] shows what's gonna happen to us
[11:06] yes given ozaki Bay you just gonna take
[11:09] them both one by one
[11:10] that's why I just don't wanna learn I'll
[11:12] learn absolutely and the devil is always
[11:14] there alone someone called and chose
[11:17] telling me a story she's like oh did you
[11:19] hear on the news of family they died for
[11:21] people back to back nothing I mean lit
[11:27] up a lot and I was like that's what's
[11:28] gonna happen to us too you mean you just
[11:30] think one was a liability
[11:32] but at that time I was receiving phone
[11:35] calls I feel like the videos at Bell
[11:38] text messages people were sending me
[11:41] songs and at that time I was the only
[11:45] thing that kept me going that gave me
[11:47] faith that special scheme agape and I
[11:50] truly want to thank each and every one
[11:51] of you who were at that time praying for
[11:53] us encouraging us because that's all we
[11:57] needed and then it was on Friday the
[12:09] first thing that I usually did was to

[22:04] we read in the Bible how he walked
[22:12] brought light to their darkness when the
[22:18] way grew so lean how great it would be
[22:25] to have his steps leave
[22:29] mine and to walk with
[22:34] stuff
[22:35] Oh
[22:40] when trials come
[22:44] and F is
[22:48] I just search for the master he said

[23:44] till a star passes by
[23:48] so why should I
[23:54] and why should I see when the very same
[24:00] Jesus he stays always near he lives in
[24:08] my heart any tears when I cry I call on
[24:16] his name till the storm passes fine
[24:24] I should
[24:27] and why should I see when the very same
[24:34] Jesus he stays always me he'll is
[24:42] [Music]
[24:43] and here's when I cry I call on his name
[24:52] till the storm passes
[24:57] I call on his name
[25:05] till the storm passes by
[25:10] [Music]
[25:15] [Applause]
