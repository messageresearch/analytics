Everything for thy own glory in Jesus Christ's name we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you happy to be here tonight? &gt;&gt; Are you happy? &gt;&gt; Amen. And if you are happy, &gt;&gt; say hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; So, greet someone. God bless you. Good to see you. &gt;&gt; Good to see you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Lord is so good for us. Is so good for us. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; We don't have to complain. The fact that we are alive in good health is so good for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And we are so grateful. So we thank the pastor for giving us the opportunity to stand tonight and uh minister the word and thank you also for coming in the house of the Lord. And we do believe uh you're going to get something if you expecting to get something. &gt;&gt; So uh let us take our Bible. We're going to read in Revelation chapter 3 from verse 14 to 22. So I'm going to read quick in English. So for the French you can follow on the the screen. &gt;&gt; And unto the angel of the church of louditions, right? These things say the Amen, the faithful and the true witness, the beginning of the creation of God. I know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot. I will thou wet cold or hot. So then because thou are lukewarm and neither cold nor hot, I will spew thee out of my mouth. Verse 17 is where is our thought tonight. Because thou sayest, I am rich and increased with goods, and have need of nothing, and knowest not that thou are wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked. I counsel thee to buy of me gold dry in the fire, that thou mayest be rich, and white remnant, that thou mayest be clothed, and that this the shame of thy neck, thy nakedness do not appear, and anoint thy eyes with eyes, that thou mayest see. As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten. &gt;&gt; Be jealous, therefore, and repent. 20 Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If any man hear my voice and open the door, I will come into him, and I will s with him and he with me. To him that overcomemeth will grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and sat down with my father in his throne. He that had here, let him hear what the spirit said unto the churches. May the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word. You may be saved. So as I said uh our major thought it in verse 17 where it speak about the condition of the church. The church doesn't know it condition. So it worries our thoughts because thou sayest, I am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not. So the condition of the church, the church is ignorant of his condition. When we talking about the church, it's not about this building. But we talking about the individual, right? You are the church. I am the church. So when we say about church, don't see end time message, but see yourself as the church we're talking about. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we're going to take again another scripture here &gt;&gt; in Luke Luke. &gt;&gt; Luke chapter 15. Verse 8 to 10. &gt;&gt; Either what a woman having 10 pieces of silver, if she lose one piece, do not light a candle, and sweep the house and seek diligently till she found it. And when she had found it, she called her friends and and her neighbors together, saying, "Rejoice with me, for I have found the peace which I had lost." Likewise, I said unto you, there is joy in the presence of of the angels of God over one sinner that repented. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So if we have a thought tonight, &gt;&gt; we will be speaking for this short time about &gt;&gt; the importance of selfawareness in a Christian's life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you there with me? the importance of selfawwareness in a Christian's life and my inspiration will be self inventory. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So if you understand the subject, you're going to have a major idea about what we'll be talking tonight. the importance of selfawareness in a Christian's life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So where we read in the Bible in Revelation, the Lord saying the church is naked, &gt;&gt; poor, &gt;&gt; but the church doesn't know about it. The church thinks he's rich. is clothed but it's the contrary of that but the church doesn't know the condition which he is. So again when we say about church we're talking about you as individual. So as the church doesn't know his condition it very important for you as a church &gt;&gt; to know your condition. &gt;&gt; Because if you know your condition, you're going to know what to do next. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you are ignorant of your condition, you're not going to go anywhere. You're not going to know what to do. Amen. Amen. That's why when even you go to the hospital, To see a doctor, a good doctor, before to do anything, he has to do an exam first and see what's wrong with you. &gt;&gt; Once he's aware of your situation, then he can prescribe a medicine. Are you there with me? Amen. &gt;&gt; So it is very important. &gt;&gt; The selfawwareness in a Christian's life is a very very important. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And for you to know, you have to check yourself up, you need to do a self inventory. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. For you to know your condition, for you to be aware of your condition, you have to do the inventory. Are you there with me? Do you understand? &gt;&gt; Is that clear? We are at the end of the year, isn't it? I think in one week or two we're going to turn the page of 2025. But if you go those who working for the company or those who have companies, when we reach December 31st, they need to close the book for 2025. Why? because the company has to know how the business was doing for the entire year. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Even those who have a stock in their storage, doing business, buying, selling, buying. So you only writing your book I bought this amount I sold this amount. Yeah but that's what what you are writing on the paper but the reality you have to go check physically because you don't know maybe a thief stole something but you in your book oh I bought 100 I sold 50 that means I have 50 left. start the book. &gt;&gt; But the reality you need to do inventory. So when you do the inventory, then you're going to be aware of the true situation. Are you there church? And the businesses the accountant people in this period they are busy and until next year they are busy closing the book. They need to report to the stakeholders the prospect investors the situation of the business. So when everything is done then you have the knowledge of the true situation of the business. Are you there with me church? And us also Christians as the year ending it's not about turning the page. &gt;&gt; Oh 2025 is finished. Now is 2020 26. &gt;&gt; No. We have to know how I have walked through this 2025 as the years ending knowing my situation, my weaknesses. How did I work? Am I in the Lord or am I outside? What is not going good with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And we do that through the word of God. The word of God is the mirror. So we heard the word of God the entire year. All the knowledges that we have. Now we have to do some reconciliation because if you don't know your true situation, &gt;&gt; you're not going to do some corrections, do some adjustment. That's why people of the business they do some inventory. They said then when they find discrepancies the difference between what they have on the book and what they have in in reality physically. If they find some differences, they have to do the adjustment, some correction. But to do that, you have to know, you have to be aware of the true situation. Are you there with me church also as a Christian as the yet ending? We don't just turn the page. Amen. Amen. We have to be aware. Am I really a Christian? Am I really a Christian? Am I doing some progress? Am I moving with the Lord? I'm backsliding. Are you there with me church? So tonight we are calling upon each and every one of us to do self inventory. Amen. As the year ending, how was the year 2025? Did I live Christian life? Did I progress with the Lord? Did I regress with the Lord? &gt;&gt; Amen. And when you find that true situation of yourself, when you are aware of your situation, then you can adjust where you find yourself short. Are you there, church? This year, I didn't pray like I was supposed to. Lord help me 2026 I have to dedicate myself in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This year I didn't pay my tithe. Lord I am a thief father. Oh father forgive me. Oh father I promise help me. 2026 I have to be a genuine Christian and pay my dues. Lord, this year I was running away from the church. This year I was not a dedicated Christian, Father, but you have given me grace. You have kept me alive until today father as the yet ending. I am a promising if you help me father I'm going to adjust my life. &gt;&gt; Are you the church? Oh father, I find myself this year. I had a lot of problems. Oh father, I have a lot of enemies. I didn't talk to my brother. I'm not getting along with this one. Getting along with that one. Father, as the year ended, I am a promising Lord to fix my life, to see my brother to fix it, to see my sister fix it. And I am promising, Father, if you keep me, if you protect me, 2026, I'm going to do my best to live as a Christian. Amen. Amen. But to come to that conclusion, you have to be aware. Are you there with me, church? We just don't turn page like that. That's why Jesus in the Bible in the revelation is blaming the church. &gt;&gt; Us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So if you are not aware that means you are suffering with amnesia. Are you there church? For you to act, you have to know. That's why they said information, knowledge is power. &gt;&gt; Are you there? And you knowing your true situation, where you are standing with the word of God, when you know it, it's going to help you to adjust where you find yourself short. Do not be happy. Oh, 20 2026 is coming. Yes. But are you going to enter in that new year like that? Always the same. Yes, we do make mistake. But we have to do some inventory. Realize I fell here. I fell here. I fell here. I fell here. I didn't do this correctly. But Lord, I am promising if you help me, I am aware of my situation. &gt;&gt; I want to be a better Christian. And to be aware, take every word that you know and compare our life. Are you there, church? Do you understand where we heading to? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; The yet ending. Yes, I believe all of us we're going to enter in 202 that there is no doubt about it. But despite that, we don't know what 2026 keeping for us, we don't know. Amen. Amen. We are not Christian here in the church but outside living a worthy life. No, &gt;&gt; it is a time &gt;&gt; to pose as the year ending. We're calling on all of us, myself included. &gt;&gt; How was 2025? Are you there, church? Anything can happen anytime. We don't know. What waiting for us in 2026? Anything can happen in 2026. &gt;&gt; In 2025, all of us we going it. We already going there, but we don't know what's waiting for us in 2026. Amen, brother. It the end of the year. Are you there? Are you there? If those worldly people, those businesses need to pause and realize and be aware of their situation. As as a Christian, we need also to be aware. Are you there, church? Are you there? Remember there is two person that you can never lie. God and yourself. You know if you are a Christian or not. You know yourself. &gt;&gt; And remember we've seen I think two weeks ago about the question who am I a prisoner? To whom am I a prisoner? Even for you to answer that question a self inventory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When you do the inventory then you can respond to that question. &gt;&gt; I am a God prisoner or the devil's prison. And remember said, you're not going to live for yourself. You are bound to be one person's prison. You can't be prison of God and prison of the devil at the same time. No. And you can't be neutral. There is no neutral because there are only two powers &gt;&gt; controlling this world &gt;&gt; and you have to belong to one of those. Where are you standing at? &gt;&gt; How was your Christian experience in this year 2025? So it require &gt;&gt; to do self inventory. &gt;&gt; Are you there with me? Tonight church we are called as the word of God is moving. Let us get inside ourself and do our inventory wherever we find ourselves. Then we ask for God's mercy as this year's ending. &gt;&gt; If I never been a good Christian, father, I would like to be one in 2026. Father, please help me. Are you there church? Are you the church? &gt;&gt; But brother Richard, you talking about selfawareness. self awareness. According to the dictionary here, what selfawwareness means in general? Selfawareness is the ability to see yourself clearly and objectively through the reflection and introspection. General itility from the inside that ability to see yourself clearly. And how are you going to see yourself in the glass of the weight of God? in the mirror of the word of God. Amen. Amen. You take the word which is a mirror and you look through it to see yourself where am I standing clearly and you can do that only yourself alone. Only you and God know that. Amen. Church, &gt;&gt; are you there with me? Please, my brothers and sisters, this world, it's ending. It's already ending. Whatsoever we have lost. As you read in Luke, as we're going to read as well, Anything that you have lost, how are you going to realize that I lost this? I lost my prayer life, I lost my fellowship with God, I lost this, I lost that. If you to do self inventory, even this woman here in the Bible, for her to start searching and sweeping, she has to be aware of what she has lost. She has a face to be aware of a situation. of her situation I'm losing this then you can take the action of sweeping the thing that you have lost my brothers and sisters what have you lost this year as the years ended What have you lost? Are you aware of what you have lost? Are we right with the Lord? If the rapture takes place even tonight though we know but I'm saying it's between 6 and 9 in the morning which time I don't know [laughter] which time America time Africa time eastern China time I don't know but what I know between 6 and 9 whatever the case brother If that takes place, are we ready? &gt;&gt; Richard, are you ready? &gt;&gt; Goodness, are you ready? &gt;&gt; Are you ready? &gt;&gt; Are we ready? &gt;&gt; What have we lost? Are you the church to find what you have lost? You have to be aware of your situation. I am insisting here. You cannot progress if you don't know what you're doing. That's why even the businesses they don't run only like that. The objective is to make the profit. They have to make sure [screaming] that they are making the profit. Otherwise, the business doesn't make sense. &gt;&gt; And how did they do that? They have to do the report of how the business was run for the entire year. Are we there? Am I scaring you? This &gt;&gt; must help us. I can preach to you about faith is good. But what next? [snorts] What next? We we not going just spoke. You supposed to preach us. We are tired. You have to encourage us. Encourage. Yes, I can encourage you. So what next? What next? Let us pause. Let us be on the ground. What is the true situation of our life? Where are we going? How our business is doing? Are we progressing? Are we back? Are we backsliding? Are we are we stopped somewhere? To be aware to be aware. When you are aware then you can take the action like this woman in the Bible. She was aware that I have lost this virtue. Which virtue have we lost in this year? If we realize, if we are aware of our true situation, then we can take the action. Otherwise, we're going to move like a blind like that and we're going to be surprised. &gt;&gt; Are you there, Steven? Steven, &gt;&gt; there is a time. &gt;&gt; Yes. The parent they taking you to church. &gt;&gt; How old are you? &gt;&gt; 11. &gt;&gt; With 11 years old, &gt;&gt; you're not going to get in heaven behind the parent. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Only when you are you are not conscious of the reality of life. And those small those small there they don't know what they do. Their conscience is not really aware of what they doing. Then they are innocent. But at 11, oh the tape was already recording what you are doing for so long. So everything you are doing is recorded. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; That means you have to take conscience of yourself as you coming to church. Are you there? Even when you go to school, you have to be Christians. Don't say I'm 11. I'm old enough to be judged. To be judged. If we talk about 11 years old, what about us big mama and big papa? &gt;&gt; They knew the grandma, the grandmama, the grandpa. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother, let us pose. &gt;&gt; Let us see the reality. &gt;&gt; We don't want to be running business pork pop like that. Where are we standing? But give us faith brother. Then then after then next faith will take you to to rapture. If there is not a Christian life in you, &gt;&gt; faith &gt;&gt; without work is dead. &gt;&gt; Faith &gt;&gt; without work is dead. &gt;&gt; Are you there, brother? &gt;&gt; The ending. &gt;&gt; Amen.

Do you understand? I think the way I explain it, it is enough for everyone to understand what you need to do. Isn't it clear? It is clear. It is simple. We have to realize our true situation. I am not doubting of your Christian life. No, no, &gt;&gt; I don't have &gt;&gt; I don't have a scale. &gt;&gt; I change the &gt;&gt; I don't have [laughter] that.

Are you there? Are you there? Wherever we find ourselves short we need to fix it. If we are not getting along I have a problem with my sister there my brother there. What if that person you hear not this year, this year we already closing. What if you hear next year, the very same person is no longer there in your heart. &gt;&gt; If you didn't love that person, I wonder maybe one of you one one will not be there. I don't know. So as we are leaving, let us get along. Ready to forgive. Ready to forgive. No matter what you have done unto me. Yes, I may cry. I may feel like. Yeah. But the end of the day, I am a Christian. I have to forgive. Are you there church? I have to forgive. I am forced by the word to forgive. And the forgiveness becomes a part of our life. What will I do? Just forgive. But don't take that. You can do evil to your brother and tell me brother the word said you must forgive. No, you are another side. Don't do that. The brother can forgive you but will not forget as a human being what you are. that that that's not good. But when it happened by mistake, we didn't plan it. We always remember we are Christians. We are bound to live together. We are bound to forgive one another. Amen. If we want the Lord to forgive us. Sudden secret going away of &gt;&gt; preaching 58 October 12. &gt;&gt; I'm going to read uh paragraph [clears throat] six. &gt;&gt; And we ask that this is brother's prayer. us that will just look upon us as we speak as and speak to us that who are here this evening should take inventory of our own situation. Are you brother? And we ask that you just look upon us and speak to us that we who are here tonight should take inventory of our own situation. Say to me, say one of the prophets &gt;&gt; and try me and see if there be any evil in me. And then Lord in searching if you find that there is evil in us, purge us Lord as we humbly confess our sin and our evil doings. Are you there church please? and ask only that you remember us as you look at as you look at Jesus thy son who died to be a prosperation for our sins and our iniquity as we confess that we believe that he died for for this purpose and rose again. That would have the great privilege of doing this. Grant it Lord and speak to us through thy written word as we wait further to hear from you. In the name of Jesus, we pray amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; The seal of God. &gt;&gt; Preaching 54 May 14. So you see there saying we take inventory for our own situation. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So when we do that and we find our our shortcomings, we cry to the Lord that the correction that we doing. But you cannot cry if you don't know your your true situation. You cannot cry to the Lord for help even to ask a help. You have to know that I'm short here. Then I need help. Even to ask a brother to help you, you have to know because you have to tell him what help you need. You have to be aware of your situation for you to ask help because help me help me. Yes, I'm here. What do you want me to help you with? So if you don't know what you need help about, how the Lord can help you. &gt;&gt; So to know what you need to be aware of your situation, you need self inventory as businesses are doing that prepare all their financial report. us also as the year is ending. Let us do inventory to be aware of our Christian. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Paragraph 289. &gt;&gt; I know you say he said you are rich and had a need of nothing. talking to the church said you said I'm rich I have a need of nothing we are greater organization and you don't know what you don't know that you are wretched poor &gt;&gt; miserable blond naked and they don't know it if a man is in that fix and knows it, he will help himself. If you are in that condition and you know it then you can be helped. Is this bad? For you to know your situation, then you need to do the inventory. You need to check your life through the mirror of the word as the earth ended. But &gt;&gt; when you are that way &gt;&gt; and don't know it &gt;&gt; and Christ said that the churches in this day will be that way and would know it. Are you there church? Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you the church &gt;&gt; 290? &gt;&gt; P your spiritual being. P your spiritual being my dear my dear dear brother. P your soul as it was with a prayer and a saying.

And the tablet that the church is possessed to where is found in Galatians 5 which is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, goodness, meekness, gentleness, patience that the tablet that supposed to be worn in the church, brotherly love, kindness, fellowship ship. &gt;&gt; And this woman when he must have been along about the duck that she realized that she had lost one of the coins. So the big thing is about realizing are you there church? &gt;&gt; Because you you're not going to seek for something that you don't know that you lost. to try to fund it. You have to recognize that selfawareness that they have lost this &gt;&gt; then you're going to find it. &gt;&gt; Are you there church 60?

They looking at me. You are the problem. That's why the brothers are looking at me. Oh, those brothers, they are wly brothers. They are lasting sisters. How they cannot last? Because you you just open your body like that. You think the eyes you may be Christian, you may be brother. But when the eyes is there to see the bad thing is the second look. So let us hide our body. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. That's the way you are. Even myself, I preach you. I preach to myself. &gt;&gt; I'm not saying I preach you.

He's the one who knows everything. That's why sometimes sometimes you don't have to give any explanation because God said Lord &gt;&gt; you know &gt;&gt; you know &gt;&gt; you know [clears throat] women immorally dressed wearing clothes that they to wear in their own dressing room out on the treat before public and the brotherly love a king that passing almost.

Notice if that little deer when he get away I'm closing now. In case you think it's time, but when that little deer can't get away, what happened? When he got bleeding, he goes to test. He's got to find water. What David said as a heart test of the the water book is wounded. His life is bleeding out of him. Heart test for water. My soul taste after thee. God, if that little can find water, he's going to die. But if he can find water, he will survive it. Oh God, I will every soul in here tonight see the wound of Satan.

Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you there? &gt;&gt; Well, you are wounded. &gt;&gt; Does your soul taste for God? &gt;&gt; You see, as that heart is wounded, he has to run to find water. Pastor Pastor F has explained it so many times. When the the deer is wounded, find water for you to run and find water. You have to be aware that I am a wounded &gt;&gt; the run to find water because it's wounded because he's aware that I am wounded. If I don't find water, I'm going to die.

He's running to find help because he's aware that I am wounded. But us Christian, the devil has wounded us. We are not aware. If you are not aware, how are you going to find help? Are you the church? Self inventory. When you do self inventory, then you're going to be aware of your situation. And when you are aware of your situation, you're going to find help. Are you the church? The year is ending. I've preached the service of the year and so many years I know years this kind of things while the years ending don't fly let us get on the ground but all these things has the end if the reality is a different to our dancing.

What we need today is a real genuine cleaning up &gt;&gt; Holy Ghost fil church backed up with the Holy Ghost ready filled and with God's Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. I believe that. If we fail to preach it, if we fail to preach it, God will raise up the Baptist or Presbyterian or somebody to do it. &gt;&gt; He certainly will have a church there without spot or wrinkle. He will do it. So brethren, let just shake ourselves and rise out and rise out. Rise out of the dust and shake ourselves and get in the great all the gospel way. and match up the highway.
