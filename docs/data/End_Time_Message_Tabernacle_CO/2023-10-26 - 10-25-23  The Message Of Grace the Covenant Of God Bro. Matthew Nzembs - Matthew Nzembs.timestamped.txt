[49:04] hearts may you give it to us

[49:14] church under their
[49:16] control in the name of Jesus amen
[49:24] amen
[49:28] I want to ask you
[49:31] something may you really bear with me
[49:36] tonight sometime it's not
[49:41] easy to speak in front of big people
[49:44] like you are
[49:49] tonight sometime the Devil comes and
[49:51] fights you here and
[49:54] there but we know the Bible
[49:57] says we are overcome by the blood of
[50:00] Jesus
[50:02] am sometime we come to preach you the
[50:06] word we're not coming here to attack
[50:12] you it's like our pastor always says
[50:16] it sometimes someone can come with a
[50:20] subject but God knows the desire in the
[50:23] heart of
[50:24] people
[50:27] and God answers according to each our
[50:29] hearts
[50:33] desires and sometime people say why are
[50:35] you preaching like that do you think
[50:36] you're a
[50:38] pastor like Brother Richard
[50:41] said and I always believed
[50:45] it I'm don't I'm not saying that because
[50:47] the pastor is
[50:49] here I will say from the depth of my
[50:54] heart in this church the God cannot put
[50:58] someone two people the same
[51:02] level when God called the man of
[51:06] God he always give him a place to the
[51:11] Tower and there's not other man more
[51:14] spiritual than
[51:17] him when you also come here we're not
[51:19] coming to attack
[51:22] anybody but we always ask God
[51:26] to put something in our
[51:29] hearts that will bless people people
[51:33] sometime it can it can
[51:37] happen we can be inspired through his
[51:40] preaching it's really
[51:45] normal you can take Luke 6 verse
[51:51] 40 Luke
[51:54] 640
[51:58] may you watch what the Bible
[52:06] says the Bible say the disciple is not
[52:09] above his
[52:11] master perfect shall be as his
[52:14] master it's very
[52:20] deep a disciple cannot be above his
[52:24] master
[52:26] by a disciple will
[52:28] fulfill will be as his
[52:32] master he can also do the work that his
[52:35] master
[52:37] does that's even the age of
[52:44] adoption let's go to Zechariah Chapter
[52:50] 4 zear chapter
[52:54] 4
[52:56] verse
[53:04] one the Bible
[53:08] [Music]

[1:01:44] doors what
[1:01:47] says
[1:01:52] 59 159
[1:01:57] so when he went

[1:02:40] me and I told him to get out of myself
[1:02:45] cell the only man that can pardon
[1:02:50] me and I told him to get out of
[1:02:53] my
[1:02:55] when the governor went
[1:02:56] out he
[1:02:58] said he made his
[1:03:02] choice if you notice everything that we
[1:03:07] do we have to make our
[1:03:09] choices it's
[1:03:13] true and the last word of that

[1:03:27] him when they pull the Rope up and tied
[1:03:31] put the mask over
[1:03:33] him he said think of
[1:03:38] it during that time his conscience
[1:03:40] starting to talk to
[1:03:43] him and the governor stood in my
[1:03:47] cell and have pardoned
[1:03:51] me if I hadn't turned him down
[1:04:01] says we can also reach a certain
[1:04:07] situations when someone can Inspire
[1:04:10] someone to speak to us we reject
[1:04:14] it and also we can reject our
[1:04:18] Grace and the the the guy said the boy
[1:04:21] said think about it
[1:04:25] the governor stood in my
[1:04:29] cell and brother said tonight there's a
[1:04:33] governor who's more than all the
[1:04:35] governor
[1:04:36] amen is the Lord Jesus
[1:04:39] Christ he is in your cell
[1:04:41] tonight is in front of your
[1:04:46] heart can't you listen to
[1:04:49] him can't you receive
[1:04:52] him can't you speak speak to
[1:04:55] him he is the king of
[1:05:01] kings and that Governor can take a form
[1:05:04] of a
[1:05:05] brother he can take a form of a
[1:05:09] sister he or she can tell you brother
[1:05:12] sister why are you behaving this
[1:05:18] way the pastor after many series about
[1:05:21] curses and blessings
[1:05:25] God who knows how to lead his
[1:05:28] service we bring him and say reconcile
[1:05:34] yourself but some people would not want
[1:05:36] to reconcile with
[1:05:38] others it's very
[1:05:42] painful you can reject Jesus Christ in
[1:05:45] your life for the last
[1:05:47] time and
[1:05:50] says when the grace is presented to you
[1:05:54] if you're not receiving that
[1:05:58] Grace but Grace that Grace becoming a
[1:06:04] disgrace how do we know
[1:06:08] tonight that the governor is not
[1:06:10] standing by our it was in the morning
[1:06:12] there when you preached but tonight I'm
[1:06:16] talking don't turn him away if you
[1:06:19] haven't never
[1:06:20] Reed not only the
[1:06:23] governor the
[1:06:25] king the only one who can pardon
[1:06:30] you he may be standing by that
[1:06:35] little that you've been living in for a
[1:06:38] long
[1:06:43] time why don't you just let him in if
[1:06:46] you haven't haven't done
[1:06:50] it if you haven't made a complete
[1:06:52] surrender to him
[1:06:58] somay you'll find out that this little
[1:07:00] humble
[1:07:04] way that you might think is just a bunch
[1:07:08] of a bunch of people that don't know
[1:07:11] what they're
[1:07:12] talking you'll find
[1:07:15] out the governor is here tonight
[1:07:22] amen the
[1:07:25] in zear where we just
[1:07:33] read there's something that really
[1:07:35] struck my heart with this great servant
[1:07:37] of God he
[1:07:42] said zear
[1:07:46] 41 he said the angel that spoke to me
[1:07:49] came
[1:07:52] back
[1:07:54] and wake me as a man that is waken out
[1:07:57] of his
[1:07:58] sleep you know when someone is
[1:08:02] sleeping it's very hard to control
[1:08:06] yourself and he said he said unto me
[1:08:10] what SE
[1:08:14] thou and I say I have looked and behold
[1:08:17] a Candlestick all of
[1:08:19] gold with a bowl upon the top of
[1:08:21] it and there seven lamps
[1:08:26] and seven pipes to the seven
[1:08:29] lamps which are upon the top there
[1:08:35] on he said the
[1:08:38] cand represent the seven
[1:08:41] ages seven Church
[1:08:43] ages what saying something in the
[1:08:46] message of
[1:08:47] Grace but
[1:08:50] says we all know this scripture
[1:08:54] we are Bible
[1:08:58] readers we knew it was a time of
[1:09:01] preparation of building the
[1:09:05] temp zel was a great Chief among the
[1:09:10] people they have put the um foundation
[1:09:14] of the build
[1:09:16] building and
[1:09:19] now now you will notice
[1:09:22] that
[1:09:25] is
[1:09:33] asking I want you to cover up yourself
[1:09:35] with a spiritual understanding while I'm
[1:09:40] [Music]
[1:09:43] speaking saying this great Chief had a
[1:09:45] touch to build a a
[1:09:48] temple and when he was doing
[1:09:51] it the one that uh put the first
[1:09:55] stone when we read
[1:09:58] far and we see that God
[1:10:03] said the hands of
[1:10:05] Z put the first
[1:10:09] stone he will he will also put the the
[1:10:13] cup
[1:10:14] Stone and I also want you to
[1:10:17] notice he never
[1:10:20] said he shall bring forth the
[1:10:22] Cornerstone
[1:10:25] he shall bring forth the
[1:10:30] headone and we know that the scripture
[1:10:32] says that Jesus is the chief cor and
[1:10:35] it's also The Headstone
[1:10:38] yes now if we if we will think for a few
[1:10:42] minutes
[1:10:48] says was to restore the faith of the
[1:10:51] children back to the fathers in other
[1:10:55] words rebuild the
[1:10:58] church again under the power of the
[1:11:00] spirit not by power not
[1:11:05] by by my spirit said the
[1:11:08] Lord not by
[1:11:10] organization not by
[1:11:13] denomination God will bring forth the
[1:11:15] church in the last
[1:11:20] days in this last
[1:11:22] days
[1:11:24] God didn't send him to build
[1:11:27] churches when they talk about churches
[1:11:29] they see
[1:11:32] building God has brought him to build
[1:11:37] individuals
[1:11:39] now according to the
[1:11:43] prophecy he said The Headstone will
[1:11:46] come I want you to
[1:11:48] notice when the head
[1:11:52] com the chief that will proclaim the
[1:11:55] mess will say Grace Grace
[1:11:59] Grace because it's by grace that we are
[1:12:03] saved say it's
[1:12:05] not by our
[1:12:08] work so that nobody will puff
[1:12:13] up the message of Grace has been tramped
[1:12:16] under the
[1:12:18] feet until it's become a
[1:12:22] disgrace
[1:12:24] when you reject the message of the
[1:12:26] hour that becomes disgrace for
[1:12:32] you some of
[1:12:36] them runs out
[1:12:40] of uh some runs in
[1:12:44] everything but the true message of
[1:12:47] Grace Remains the Same
[1:12:52] amen
[1:12:55] and there's where Satan tries to knock
[1:12:57] it out from the
[1:13:00] church but it's the it's the grace of
[1:13:03] God that we are all saved by and
[1:13:06] now the deity of Jesus
[1:13:10] Christ if the Lord God could come
[1:13:13] here and confirm that that is the
[1:13:16] truth not only
[1:13:19] that but by his
[1:13:22] word confirms it's the
[1:13:25] truth and by signs and
[1:13:29] wonders he confirm it's the
[1:13:32] truth then also
[1:13:34] Grace is the truth
[1:13:40] amen my beloved brother and
[1:13:43] sisters the grace is the
[1:13:48] truth
[1:13:52] why

[1:13:59] that Grace is
[1:14:01] wrong that we saved by
[1:14:04] works we are saved by
[1:14:07] grace that true
[1:14:09] faith not by
[1:14:13] works works shows that you have been
[1:14:16] saved but what saves
[1:14:18] you is the grace of
[1:14:21] God works
[1:14:25] it's what you
[1:14:27] do to show
[1:14:30] appreciation of what God did for
[1:14:33] you by grace are you
[1:14:36] saved some people
[1:14:40] thinks because I go join a
[1:14:42] church I put my name on the book that's
[1:14:45] all I have to
[1:14:47] do some people
[1:14:49] think because I shout that's all I have
[1:14:52] to do all those things because I speak
[1:14:55] in Tong that's all I have to do some
[1:15:02] things because I got power to that's all
[1:15:05] I got to do it's
[1:15:08] not the grace of God
[1:15:11] that God's Amazing
[1:15:16] Grace I cannot trust in any merits some
[1:15:20] said oh oh there's a great man that
[1:15:27] man I've heard him stand up and do
[1:15:31] this I've heard him stand up and do
[1:15:35] that Paul said in 1in
[1:15:40] 13 though I speak with tongue of men of
[1:15:44] angels though I have
[1:15:46] discernment though I have
[1:15:51] gift I take all my goods to feed the
[1:15:55] poor though I can move mountains with to
[1:15:58] understand all things I am
[1:16:02] nothing till love comes in which is
[1:16:05] Grace
[1:16:07] amen God has to do
[1:16:11] it you can do all these things and still
[1:16:15] be lost that's right it's Grace that
[1:16:18] saves
[1:16:20] you God's grace to the human
[1:16:24] think about him
[1:16:28] amen says I was thinking of that
[1:16:34] immediately after that appear Friday
[1:16:37] morning just at the break of
[1:16:40] day up there in that
[1:16:42] field when I said at the L
[1:16:46] later and later
[1:16:48] on tears come down in my
[1:16:51] eyes say
[1:16:54] I told oh
[1:16:56] God Your Grace has stoed to save
[1:17:02] me why did you ever have such pity
[1:17:06] theate rich like
[1:17:13] me how did you ever come down to our
[1:17:15] humble little
[1:17:22] Tabernacle people of low Walk of Life
[1:17:26] poor have nothing of this
[1:17:28] world and still your
[1:17:31] grace PR in our heart by the holy
[1:17:36] spirit that you
[1:17:38] heal our sickness our people so that you
[1:17:42] can treat with us deal with us and
[1:17:45] then I I thought about
[1:17:49] David when he had the idea to build a a
[1:17:53] uh Temple for for the Lord he
[1:17:59] said it's not right for me to leave in
[1:18:01] the house of
[1:18:03] Cedar I'm just putting a
[1:18:08] foundation and the Ark of the Covenant
[1:18:10] of my
[1:18:12] God under
[1:18:14] shipin under ship skin and the
[1:18:16] Tabernacle God told the
[1:18:20] prophet go tell my servant David
[1:18:24] I took him from the
[1:18:27] ship from feeding them few sheep out
[1:18:29] there your
[1:18:33] daddies and I thought about the grace of
[1:18:37] God and how did he do
[1:18:41] that to the
[1:18:45] uttermost and then will take a PO like
[1:18:49] myself and give me the opportunity to
[1:18:52] preach the gospel
[1:18:56] and to see others
[1:18:58] saved see them
[1:19:01] healed see homes have been broken
[1:19:04] up straighten up
[1:19:07] again see lives that been
[1:19:10] ruined made right
[1:19:12] again and to give me
[1:19:14] Grace I thought
[1:19:17] oh it's amazing
[1:19:21] grace then come to a
[1:19:24] degraded L scur Hunter out into the
[1:19:29] woods and from himself in the form of
[1:19:32] the
[1:19:33] red which means a
[1:19:37] covenant with a
[1:19:39] message that he gave me to
[1:19:42] preach and form it
[1:19:44] there in a
[1:19:47] covenant that is behind
[1:19:51] it it be behind
[1:19:54] it because the message is of Jesus
[1:19:57] Christ and His
[1:20:00] glory this message that you believe
[1:20:03] in is the message of Jesus
[1:20:06] Christ it's not the message of brother
[1:20:09] BR it's not a message of a
[1:20:11] man it's a message of God himself
[1:20:19] amen
[1:20:21] says it's not not by
[1:20:24] knowledge it's not by
[1:20:28] theology it's by the spirit of God
[1:20:32] that it's a spirit of God that heal
[1:20:35] people it's the spirit of God that gives
[1:20:37] the message to
[1:20:39] people it's the spirit of God that
[1:20:41] confirms the
[1:20:46] word but you have to have humility in
[1:20:50] God so that his word can be manif
[1:20:55] show that Jesus Christ is the same
[1:20:56] yesterday today and
[1:20:58] forever you have to have a humble heart
[1:21:02] and you have to be consecrated to
[1:21:04] God to bring God in the prison time
[1:21:08] amen what
[1:21:10] says you have to have a humble
[1:21:13] heart a humble that's
[1:21:17] consecrated to bring Jesus Christ in the
[1:21:19] present
[1:21:20] time we are not Liv believing in the
[1:21:23] Jesus
[1:21:25] Christ the Jesus Christ of 2,000 years
[1:21:29] ago we believe in Jesus Christ in the
[1:21:31] present
[1:21:33] tense is the same yesterday today and
[1:21:36] forever
[1:21:41] says if we have to get
[1:21:44] theology what are we talking
[1:21:47] about Methodist and
[1:21:50] Baptist Catholic and so forth
[1:21:54] we wouldn't have a chance as poor
[1:21:58] unlearned
[1:22:00] people I'm
[1:22:03] saying if God could choose Great
[1:22:06] Men great
[1:22:08] theology
[1:22:11] andian all the
[1:22:15] Pentecostal where could we find ourself
[1:22:17] unlearned
[1:22:19] people but it's only his
[1:22:21] grace
[1:22:23] and I believe that that same Grace is
[1:22:25] here

[1:22:28] done for

[1:24:06] you it hasn't been given to anybody else
[1:24:10] everybody
[1:24:16] says
[1:24:19] God didn't go to
[1:24:23] the high
[1:24:26] priest unless would have been condemned
[1:24:29] by
[1:24:30] him but he took a
[1:24:34] Sinners poor
[1:24:36] people who were living ordinary
[1:24:39] Liv and he revealed himself to
[1:24:42] them and
[1:24:44] said follow
[1:24:47] me I make you fishes of
[1:24:51] men
[1:24:56] so that his grace still reach down
[1:25:02] even to call the people for his name in
[1:25:05] this last
[1:25:06] days as we just been true it Amazing
[1:25:11] Grace How Sweet the
[1:25:13] Sound the grace of God is
[1:25:18] old Grace is as old as the world
[1:25:24] Grace was first shown to
[1:25:26] the to the human
[1:25:29] race when we had the beginning of the
[1:25:31] human
[1:25:34] race when the human race was first
[1:25:37] created in the Garden of
[1:25:39] Eden on that dark
[1:25:45] morning when the little woman had
[1:25:47] stepped across the
[1:25:49] sep and had gone against God's
[1:25:51] commandment
[1:25:53] and her husband to do the same
[1:25:57] thing then the law was
[1:26:04] broken the law must have a
[1:26:07] penalty or it isn't no
[1:26:13] law Prophet said the day that you
[1:26:16] eat thereof that day you shall trly
[1:26:20] die that's why God told to Adam and
[1:26:24] Eve says
[1:26:26] now
[1:26:28] remember and remember
[1:26:32] this remember this and keep
[1:26:38] it remember the first judgment
[1:26:41] seat was upon the Earth and it was in
[1:26:44] the Garden of
[1:26:45] Eden
[1:26:47] says and the last judgment
[1:26:50] seat will be uh the the white
[1:26:54] Throne will be upon the Earth at the end
[1:26:58] time
[1:26:59] amen that's really
[1:27:04] deep in Genesis chapter 15 where we just
[1:27:09] read Bible
[1:27:12] says the Lord talk to
[1:27:17] Abraham I am the one that took you from
[1:27:20] Earth C
[1:27:24] to give you this land to inherit
[1:27:27] it
[1:27:32] says uh in our
[1:27:35] God in his thought he has
[1:27:39] laws
[1:27:41] says he said the first law is the law of
[1:27:46] death he said the second law is the law
[1:27:49] of
[1:27:51] life and there's also many other
[1:27:55] laws that God has said the law of
[1:28:00] seed or the law of
[1:28:03] reproduction there's also another
[1:28:06] law it's the law of uh
[1:28:10] impunity the law of
[1:28:13] seed it's the law that depending on your
[1:28:17] choice so if you go
[1:28:19] and and you're going to get
[1:28:24] you're going to have corn
[1:28:26] back it depends on your choice if you do
[1:28:30] good you're still going to have good
[1:28:32] back it depends on your
[1:28:35] choices but there's a Cho there's a law
[1:28:38] of
[1:28:39] impunity and that law of
[1:28:44] impunity God doesn't Let It Go
[1:28:48] by you know later sooner or later
[1:28:52] that La will catch up to you examp
[1:28:57] example uel host me in his
[1:29:02] house I go and and abuse his his
[1:29:06] children and I go and uh repent myself
[1:29:09] to
[1:29:10] God God will not leave me that
[1:29:14] way God will punish me because of the
[1:29:18] ACT but host me to his house
[1:29:23] and I'm starting flirting with brother
[1:29:25] emanuel's
[1:29:27] wife the god of Heaven won't leave me
[1:29:29] that
[1:29:30] way one day when I will be
[1:29:33] married someone someone else will
[1:29:36] come this is the law of
[1:29:40] impunity God doesn't leave that law just
[1:29:43] like
[1:29:47] that regardless of
[1:29:50] repentance
[1:29:52] God will not leave the law of impunity
[1:29:54] go
[1:29:57] VI remember what happened with
[1:30:01] David David went and took
[1:30:05] B you know what God
[1:30:08] Said God severely punished
[1:30:12] David look what happened in David's
[1:30:16] house what God he
[1:30:20] is that's why you have to remember
[1:30:23] you you have to always think before
[1:30:26] doing
[1:30:26] anything
[1:30:29] says in the place of God worship that
[1:30:32] God paragraph
[1:30:37] 24 I'm saying deom means two
[1:30:40] lows the word
[1:30:43] Deuteronomy and God is two
[1:30:46] lows one is the law of
[1:30:50] death by Disobedience to the
[1:30:55] word if you disobey to the word of
[1:30:58] God that law will catch up to
[1:31:02] you we see that
[1:31:05] Eve disobeyed to God's
[1:31:07] word and that brought
[1:31:10] death it's one of his
[1:31:12] laws the day that shall you shall
[1:31:17] die and he also has another law it's the
[1:31:20] law of life
[1:31:23] by
[1:31:24] obedience what am I telling you
[1:31:27] tonight you have to obey to the word of
[1:31:29] God to
[1:31:31] live if you don't do this or that and
[1:31:36] then if you if you observe his word or
[1:31:39] you keep his word you will
[1:31:42] leave says you say according to
[1:31:47] me that it's coming to two things either
[1:31:53] You observe or you keep his word
[1:31:56] or or you disobeying his
[1:32:02] word one of his was given in the
[1:32:05] mount and one was
[1:32:08] given that one that law that law was the
[1:32:12] law of
[1:32:15] death the other law was given to the
[1:32:17] Mount of
[1:32:20] calvary
[1:32:24] that's where the law of life was given
[1:32:26] by Jesus
[1:32:28] Christ it's that it's according to that
[1:32:30] law that I want to talk about the law of
[1:32:34] Grace it also has two
[1:32:37] covenants he made a covenant with
[1:32:41] Adam the first man that lived on
[1:32:44] Earth and that Covenant was
[1:32:48] conditional if you do this or that
[1:32:52] I will do this or that for
[1:32:55] you Adam had to do certain
[1:32:59] things in order to maintain
[1:33:03] this he had to work in God's way he had
[1:33:07] to keep all his
[1:33:09] words to not disobey one of his
[1:33:13] words but he also did another
[1:33:16] Covenant that
[1:33:17] one was with
[1:33:19] Abraham that Covenant
[1:33:25] was not abiding
[1:33:28] with but the Covenant was
[1:33:31] unconditional God gave the Covenant to
[1:33:34] made the Covenant with Abraham without
[1:33:37] conditions it was an unconditional
[1:33:40] covenant not that I will do
[1:33:44] I I already done
[1:33:48] it it's through that same Covenant that
[1:33:51] the Christian should live by
[1:33:54] it a Christian should live by the
[1:33:57] Covenant that God has made
[1:34:00] AB it's not depending on what we
[1:34:03] do it's regarding what he has done for
[1:34:07] us the only thing you should do is to
[1:34:10] believe
[1:34:12] him is to believe what he has
[1:34:15] done Christ was already
[1:34:18] sacrificed it's not that he will do
[1:34:22] he already been
[1:34:24] sacrificed it's already a done
[1:34:28] work God cannot do a work without being
[1:34:33] accomplished God will always do etal
[1:34:36] work a Grace to have a God Like Jesus
[1:34:39] Christ he has
[1:34:41] lived he he died and
[1:34:45] resurrected he went on
[1:34:49] Earth and came back in the form of of
[1:34:51] the
[1:34:52] Holy to live inside men or Believers
[1:34:56] what a
[1:34:59] Grace
[1:35:04] says it's a work
[1:35:08] done Christ who didn't know
[1:35:11] sin he became a he became
[1:35:14] sin so that I can take his place he took
[1:35:18] my
[1:35:19] place I was with him
[1:35:22] when he
[1:35:24] died I had to die there with
[1:35:27] him so that I
[1:35:30] may as the law of death and
[1:35:33] life is inside the
[1:35:35] body you have
[1:35:38] to so that you can be reconciled with
[1:35:41] him
[1:35:43] amen it's not concerning what I'm going
[1:35:46] to
[1:35:49] do it's not according what my dead is
[1:35:52] done it's because of his
[1:35:54] grace because he took my place
[1:36:00] amen
[1:36:03] says he said the faithful
[1:36:07] Abraham
[1:36:09] says he say observe this watch this he
[1:36:14] said this little
[1:36:17] umer he said those goat and all those uh
[1:36:22] he said three different
[1:36:26] species he said the pure
[1:36:30] sacrifices he said those little
[1:36:33] pigeon and ABR took all those
[1:36:36] animals and cut them into
[1:36:39] two and put them towards looking at each
[1:36:45] other but the
[1:36:47] pigeon he didn't cut
[1:36:50] that
[1:36:58] says that means that the healing is
[1:37:02] already
[1:37:04] there the dispensation will
[1:37:08] change he say the the Divine Healing
[1:37:10] will never
[1:37:12] change it's already abiding with your
[1:37:14] faith you
[1:37:17] see he said don't cut the pigeon
[1:37:23] he said the the the
[1:37:25] sacrifice the and everything else and
[1:37:28] the sickness it's the same
[1:37:32] thing it's always rest upon fa your own
[1:37:36] faith and
[1:37:39] then and when Abraham done
[1:37:41] it and he
[1:37:44] said when he has
[1:37:48] done he said all those uh um
[1:37:54] and starting to mess up with those
[1:37:56] sacrifices and Abraham cast them
[1:38:00] out until the down the day and now
[1:38:05] listen they had three
[1:38:07] elements they had they were
[1:38:11] threaten there were Darkness there where
[1:38:13] Abraham
[1:38:14] was and after a
[1:38:17] while he saw a great
[1:38:20] furnace
[1:38:21] and after that he saw
[1:38:25] flames and what that was
[1:38:30] represented that little FL was going
[1:38:32] through all those little
[1:38:34] pieces of
[1:38:36] sacrifice confirming the Covenant of
[1:38:40] ABR there's nothing that Abraham has
[1:38:44] done amen that was the grace of Covenant
[1:38:47] for Abraham without
[1:38:50] condition not because you
[1:38:53] want
[1:38:56] says it's what I've
[1:39:02] done not that if you
[1:39:05] do or if you do
[1:39:07] this it's what I've done what I've
[1:39:10] already
[1:39:12] done that's what he will do he will show
[1:39:14] in
[1:39:15] Christ showing the
[1:39:18] sacrifice just a
[1:39:20] moment I'll get to
[1:39:23] it
[1:39:25] first the
[1:39:27] darkness that's
[1:39:29] death every
[1:39:33] man though I walk through the valley of
[1:39:35] shadow of death
[1:39:38] next a smoking furnace that's hell where
[1:39:42] every sinner
[1:39:43] belongs but after
[1:39:46] that comes a little light oh God
[1:39:51] grace Amazing
[1:39:53] Grace lighting up the
[1:39:57] way making a

[1:40:26] the

[1:40:30] that with
[1:40:31] Christ he put Christ to Calvary BR to

[1:40:42] to
[1:40:43] Darkness and there were a lot of
[1:40:46] uh tunders gruning and
[1:40:49] everything God took the body of
[1:40:52] Christ and uh uh cut it into
[1:40:58] two the type of sacrifice that Abraham
[1:41:01] had amen

[1:41:10] Abraham the Glorious son of the great
[1:41:12] son of Abraham and T it
[1:41:15] apart and pulled the spirit
[1:41:18] out and took it away

[1:41:28] sins

[1:41:54] am amen that same spirit that that was
[1:41:57] in Christ to be in the
[1:42:00] church the same holy ghost that dwelt in
[1:42:03] Christ DW in
[1:42:04] us and when the Rapture
[1:42:07] comes them two pieces has to come to the
[1:42:10] church that Christ died
[1:42:13] for
[1:42:15] says all your
[1:42:18] denominations won't mount to that
[1:42:23] your little differences
[1:42:27] and and so forth of baptism
[1:42:32] forward he said say will not get you
[1:42:35] anywhere
[1:42:38] says if God has said
[1:42:41] it that's the Covenant that
[1:42:43] God he uh split Christ he split
[1:42:49] Christ and took his took body and set it
[1:42:52] on the right side
[1:42:54] of and sent the other part of the Holy
[1:42:59] Ghost down to the
[1:43:01] Earth to baptize the church with the
[1:43:04] same
[1:43:06] Faith give them the same faith that he
[1:43:10] had give them the same work that he
[1:43:13] accomplished you do the same work as
[1:43:16] well when Christ died on the
[1:43:19] cross said oh my father everything has
[1:43:22] been
[1:43:23] done all your
[1:43:25] sicknesses all your
[1:43:28] problems God has
[1:43:30] taken to
[1:43:33] Calvary it was the uh the work of
[1:43:37] Grace it didn't depend on what you were
[1:43:42] doing I always uh putting a
[1:43:47] foundation
[1:43:48] talking paragraph 56
[1:43:55] now a complete separation with
[1:43:59] unbelief and uh
[1:44:02] remember
[1:44:09] Abraham ABR wasn't completely
[1:44:15] blessed if he didn't fulfill completely
[1:44:18] what God has told
[1:44:19] him and never
[1:44:22] never we will be
[1:44:25] blessed and we have
[1:44:30] blessings if we don't obey to what God
[1:44:33] has told us to
[1:44:34] [Music]
[1:44:35] do if you want to be
[1:44:39] blessed if you want to receive
[1:44:43] blessings you have to obey to what God
[1:44:45] has asked you to
[1:44:49] do say another thing I want you to
[1:44:53] notice in chapter 12 of Genesis where we
[1:44:59] read said that Covenant was
[1:45:03] unconditional God is not giving you a
[1:45:06] covenant
[1:45:08] with because you are uh
[1:45:11] um the because you are the posterity of
[1:45:15] Abraham when God gives you the
[1:45:19] Covenant give you a covenant without
[1:45:22] conditions what a Grace to have a God
[1:45:25] Like Jesus
[1:45:28] Christ
[1:45:30] says it was without
[1:45:33] conditions he say
[1:45:35] I not if
[1:45:40] you and if was
[1:45:43] excluded because I already done
[1:45:47] it he said I gave the Covenant to Abram
[1:45:50] that now you
[1:45:53] know with the covenant made
[1:45:57] with it was if you
[1:45:59] don't then I will do this
[1:46:03] but but if you touch
[1:46:06] it then I would have done
[1:46:09] this you
[1:46:12] see that was uh resting
[1:46:16] upon and with this
[1:46:19] Covenant with the Covenant of
[1:46:24] Abraham I already made you a father of a
[1:46:27] multitude of
[1:46:28] people and he
[1:46:32] said he uh this Covenant is
[1:46:35] unconditional this
[1:46:38] covenant What Covenant is
[1:46:40] it says it is
[1:46:44] Grace it's a Grace in his
[1:46:47] Purity
[1:46:48] Grace it's nothing
[1:46:55] the only thing that he want he was
[1:46:57] supposed to do to keep that
[1:47:01] Covenant is to stay in the
[1:47:06] land and then all the blessing attached
[1:47:10] to the Covenant will be following him
[1:47:13] the only thing he has to
[1:47:15] do was to stay in the
[1:47:18] land and then we are
[1:47:21] noticing they went to
[1:47:24] Egypt and they lost their
[1:47:29] blessings
[1:47:33] say when the children of Israel went
[1:47:36] from Canan to
[1:47:38] egy that's where they lost their
[1:47:42] blessings when you leave the message of
[1:47:44] the
[1:47:46] hour and then you go to the
[1:47:49] world
[1:47:51] that's why you're going to lose your
[1:47:53] blessings you know the little advice I
[1:47:55] have for
[1:47:56] everybody stay in the message of the
[1:47:59] hour stay in the message of the
[1:48:02] hour it's to accomplish or to fulfill
[1:48:05] what the the message is asking us to
[1:48:07] do and then we won't lose our
[1:48:11] blessings they lost their
[1:48:13] blessings but
[1:48:16] not that's a good news for you
[1:48:19] tonight
[1:48:21] you may have lost your
[1:48:23] blessings but your Covenant is still
[1:48:26] with
[1:48:27] you the Covenant was still with
[1:48:30] them they lost the
[1:48:32] blessing but not the
[1:48:35] Covenant because the
[1:48:37] Covenant was the grace without
[1:48:42] condition your
[1:48:44] Covenant it's Grace without
[1:48:48] condition says
[1:48:51] and exod chapter
[1:48:53] 19 I'm not going to read
[1:48:57] it it say Israel made one of the
[1:49:00] greatest they've never done
[1:49:03] before when they refus
[1:49:06] Grace and accepted
[1:49:10] law look what Grace has
[1:49:14] done Grace and look what
[1:49:18] Grace Grace and furnish them a a
[1:49:22] deliverer and
[1:49:24] said and watch what Grace had
[1:49:29] done great opened the Red Sea for
[1:49:34] them great given them
[1:49:38] deliver Grace had brought them a
[1:49:41] prophet with a pillar of
[1:49:44] fire and that same
[1:49:47] Grace has come tonight
[1:49:50] look at what the Grace has
[1:49:52] done Grace has given us a major prophet
[1:49:56] a powerful
[1:49:58] Prophet not because of our
[1:50:01] might by his spirit said the
[1:50:04] Lord
[1:50:06] say given them a
[1:50:10] prophet and given them a
[1:50:13] deliverer Propet and give them a great
[1:50:16] prophet with a pillow of
[1:50:18] fire to
[1:50:21] V and then there was a sacrificial
[1:50:26] lamb Grace had give them a great
[1:50:32] Revival Grace had brought them
[1:50:36] through open up the Red
[1:50:39] Sea brought them across
[1:50:42] that deliver them with signs and
[1:50:46] wonders all by
[1:50:49] grace but they wanted
[1:50:53] something so they could make themselves
[1:50:56] some big
[1:50:57] names
[1:50:59] now that's just isn't the people
[1:51:02] today it's just the same
[1:51:05] thing they got to they got to be
[1:51:10] man man has got to get itself involved
[1:51:15] somewh there is where that Israel made
[1:51:18] it great
[1:51:20] when he rejected
[1:51:22] Grace and instead of that they took the
[1:51:26] law and
[1:51:29] then still by the
[1:51:32] Covenant was still
[1:51:35] unconditional it's still the same thing
[1:51:39] today the Covenant that God has made
[1:51:41] with
[1:51:43] you it's an unconditional
[1:51:47] Covenant
[1:51:48] Abraham
[1:51:50] was a great prophet of
[1:51:52] God but he went through many
[1:51:57] trials said the
[1:51:59] trials in the Christian
[1:52:02] life means that God
[1:52:05] trust when God
[1:52:07] sent that means god is
[1:52:11] trusting and that was the condition of
[1:52:15] job God has sent Tri to
[1:52:18] job because in your only
[1:52:22] job was supposed to Bear those trials
[1:52:25] and
[1:52:26] tonight God is
[1:52:29] sending because you are the only one
[1:52:32] that can bear it not another person not
[1:52:35] the
[1:52:36] prophet but the grace of God in this end
[1:52:40] time has given us a
[1:52:42] prophet with the pit of
[1:52:45] fire said the P of
[1:52:48] fire it's always to
[1:52:50] vindicate that it is the true
[1:52:53] Prophet this message is the
[1:52:55] truth it's the message coming from
[1:52:58] God David regardless of his
[1:53:02] mistakes regardless of all his done the
[1:53:06] grace of God was always with
[1:53:08] him that's what I like with our God he
[1:53:12] said
[1:53:13] David it's not you is going to build a
[1:53:15] temple for but I
[1:53:18] promise
[1:53:22] hi the Lord I will give you a house and
[1:53:24] brother
[1:53:26] say the temple that God has promised to
[1:53:30] David was not a a building made by human
[1:53:35] hands that's why when Jesus talk in John
[1:53:40] 14 he said in my in my in my father's
[1:53:42] house there's many
[1:53:45] uh there's many
[1:53:47] mention and brother say
[1:53:50] I don't believe that there in
[1:53:52] [Music]
[1:53:53] Heaven There are buildings made in
[1:54:00] bricks I don't believe that Immortal
[1:54:05] beings can live in
[1:54:09] humans in in houses made by
[1:54:13] hum but God has promised us a house a
[1:54:17] place that means a body
[1:54:21] and to go inside that
[1:54:23] body we have to be
[1:54:26] prepared we have to change our
[1:54:29] Ro like God has T
[1:54:32] Moses to the children of
[1:54:35] isra change
[1:54:37] their so that I the God would speak to
[1:54:41] them what a Grace to have a
[1:54:44] prophet he's showing us
[1:54:47] things that we didn't know before
[1:54:50] [Music]
[1:54:53] things that out to be the prophet
[1:54:55] says in the
[1:54:57] [Music]
[1:54:58] beginning in the beginning of the
[1:55:01] world when
[1:55:04] God and took the uh took the waters from
[1:55:09] the
[1:55:12] earth as is DED in the
[1:55:16] sea a world was created
[1:55:20] what says
[1:55:24] yes and people started to live in
[1:55:28] it after God has placed
[1:55:32] it and there they started to
[1:55:36] sin and they were
[1:55:39] baptized in immersion in Noah's
[1:55:44] time and they was sacrificed through the
[1:55:48] blood uh of the
[1:55:50] Creator who uh was
[1:55:54] given and
[1:55:56] then it's through that
[1:55:59] way that you came to
[1:56:02] justification believing in
[1:56:05] God you were
[1:56:07] baptized so that after
[1:56:11] repentance for the remission of your
[1:56:14] sin you have repented to Christ to God
[1:56:19] and he has forgiven
[1:56:21] you and you've been
[1:56:24] baptized to show that you
[1:56:27] had that you had been
[1:56:31] forgiven confessing to people and
[1:56:33] showing to the world that you believe
[1:56:36] that Jesus Christ died for
[1:56:38] you and he took your place and
[1:56:42] now you stand in his place he became
[1:56:47] you that you might become become him
[1:56:50] what a
[1:56:51] Grace God Of
[1:56:54] Heaven he left
[1:56:57] heavens and came to become a
[1:57:01] sinner so that you can become a holy or
[1:57:04] a holy
[1:57:05] person what a great news
[1:57:08] amen the message of
[1:57:11] Grace God Of
[1:57:18] Heaven

[1:57:23] the habits of your
[1:57:25] life and take out all those
[1:57:29] habit you used to smoke

[1:58:00] wrong or something that's not
[1:58:03] wrong and you say wait a minute pardon
[1:58:08] me I didn't mean to say like
[1:58:11] that see the devil got
[1:58:15] TR but if you're a true
[1:58:18] Christian you have the
[1:58:20] grace to come up to yourself and say I
[1:58:25] was
[1:58:26] wrong yes
[1:58:29] now now the next
[1:58:31] thing that you have
[1:58:33] received the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:58:36] and Fire now
[1:58:40] God when this Millennium is
[1:58:45] over God is going to give the world a
[1:58:48] baptism of Fire
[1:58:50] it's going to blow the whole things
[1:58:54] up it's going to blow the whole thing
[1:58:57] up
[1:59:00] says and you will say wait a minute
[1:59:04] forgive
[1:59:05] me I wasn't supposed to
[1:59:08] say says
[1:59:14] oh
[1:59:18] 65

[1:59:22] Fall because he come through
[1:59:25] sex he come through
[1:59:29] disobedience in the
[1:59:33] beginning was born here to
[1:59:35] sex to the
[1:59:37] [Music]
[1:59:39] fall and he must go right back the same
[1:59:44] way but the one who is trying to prepare
[1:59:48] now can
[1:59:51] fall is making it
[1:59:53] so
[1:59:55] says what
[1:59:57] if what
[2:00:00] if we just had to stay in this kind of
[2:00:04] body ex aren't you glad there's such a
[2:00:07] thing as congregation says amen Now
[2:00:11] isn't it strange isn't it strange but
[2:00:14] now say for instance a few years ago I
[2:00:19] was a little
[2:00:21] boy and now I'm a middle-aged
[2:00:25] man I got a friend sitting right
[2:00:30] here
[2:00:33] Mr and is 93 years old a few days ago
[2:00:38] look at him now
[2:00:41] now 40 or 45 years years that will be me
[2:00:48] now
[2:00:50] put another 40 years on him where would
[2:00:53] you
[2:00:55] go think a little bit brother
[2:01:00] says he say example here brother
[2:01:03] Walter how old is
[2:01:06] he give him another 40
[2:01:09] years he say after 40
[2:01:12] years where would it
[2:01:16] be he has to go somewhere what does it
[2:01:20] mean we're coming from
[2:01:23] somewhere and we're going
[2:01:26] somewhere and to go that
[2:01:29] place we have
[2:01:31] to to have a
[2:01:34] God will send us a
[2:01:37] message and that message will show us
[2:01:40] the
[2:01:44] way that that me will show us the
[2:01:48] way
[2:01:50] and the way that God has shown us today
[2:01:52] it's Malachi
[2:01:54] 4 it's William
[2:01:57] Bram is the one who knows the
[2:01:59] way is the one who
[2:02:02] knows and God is the way that he
[2:02:06] prepared and that way is called the way
[2:02:08] of
[2:02:09] Grace regardless of your
[2:02:12] condition regardless of your
[2:02:15] situation God has provided a way the
[2:02:18] grace
[2:02:20] uh unconditional
[2:02:23] Grace uh the grace of God it's brought
[2:02:26] us from the
[2:02:28] world has made us what we are today what
[2:02:31] a
[2:02:33] Grace oh he left many people great
[2:02:35] people on in the
[2:02:38] world and came to redeem
[2:02:40] us what a
[2:02:43] Grace that's the reason why brother
[2:02:47] says Grace is graceful for someone we
[2:02:49] receive it as a Grace
[2:02:56] amen I think I have to
[2:03:01] stop sometime I will prepare many
[2:03:05] things and sometime you don't have
[2:03:07] enough
[2:03:11] time God knows
[2:03:14] everything receive the
[2:03:17] grace
[2:03:20] said that Grace is Grace when you
[2:03:21] receive it as
[2:03:23] such
[2:03:27] says the same camels that uh Rebecca
[2:03:32] water it's the same camels that brought
[2:03:35] him to his house to her house the same
[2:03:39] message that you will
[2:03:43] take with value is the same message that
[2:03:46] will take you home you have to be ready
[2:03:50] there's no more
[2:03:54] time live like you're going to live for
[2:03:56] only 10 more hours
[2:03:59] left live a Pure
[2:04:02] Life speak about Jesus
[2:04:05] Christ and work speak about Jesus
[2:04:09] Christ and the same God who gave Grace
[2:04:12] to Abraham he going to give us the same
[2:04:15] Grace may God bless
[2:04:17] you
[2:04:27] the
[2:04:29] lord it's a message of
[2:04:33] Grace and that's all that we
[2:04:37] are uh it's really a very
[2:04:41] complex uh
[2:04:46] topic uh but I want to help you as you
[2:04:49] go home for your personal
[2:04:55] study yeah brother Matthew took uh
[2:04:58] Genesis chapter
[2:05:02] 15 uh this is the fifth time God was
[2:05:06] dealing with
[2:05:10] Abraham uh he started in Genesis
[2:05:15] 12 asking him to leave
[2:05:19] and uh Genesis
[2:05:21] 133 still Genesis
[2:05:23] 12 he came second time in a
[2:05:28] vision and later on he asked him to be
[2:05:31] separated with
[2:05:34] lot and uh Genesis I believe the next
[2:05:39] chapter uh I think
[2:05:42] 14 uh this is where after the fight he
[2:05:45] received a he gave
[2:05:47] communion
[2:05:49] but in
[2:05:50] Genesis
[2:05:52] 15 that was the fifth time God dealing
[2:05:56] with
[2:05:57] [Music]
[2:05:59] Abraham and in that fifth
[2:06:02] time it was God now willing to give a
[2:06:07] confirmation of the
[2:06:10] [Music]
[2:06:11] Covenant and uh in the old
[2:06:14] time to give a
[2:06:17] confirmation
[2:06:19] uh they used to take like a piece of
[2:06:21] paper they cut in
[2:06:24] two you keep one I keep
[2:06:28] one that's the
[2:06:30] confirmation but in case of
[2:06:33] Abraham the way God did
[2:06:36] it he told him to bring three
[2:06:41] beasts plus two
[2:06:45] birds the three Beast where the the
[2:06:51] Hyer
[2:06:53] Hyer
[2:06:57] R and the
[2:07:02] goat and he told them to cut the
[2:07:06] three
[2:07:08] animals to cut them and to put them side
[2:07:13] by
[2:07:15] side but he could not cut the
[2:07:20] bird the toal Dove and the
[2:07:25] pigeon because they two represent Divine
[2:07:31] Healing and you cannot cut Divine
[2:07:36] Healing but only the three
[2:07:39] animal as he cut them in
[2:07:42] two you have to put them side by
[2:07:46] side and wait until till the
[2:07:50] night the
[2:07:52] dark which is the type of
[2:07:57] death and then then when the other birds
[2:08:00] come to
[2:08:02] eat Abraham is chasing
[2:08:06] them because that was the kind of
[2:08:09] confirmation of the
[2:08:12] Covenant I don't want to go further
[2:08:14] because of the time
[2:08:17] anyway
[2:08:19] I think I was understanding it more than
[2:08:21] I believe most of the people that's why
[2:08:23] I give you this little
[2:08:29] summary and if you can take the message
[2:08:32] Jehovah where explaining the those
[2:08:38] animals and the the darkness
[2:08:43] coming and then the light
[2:08:47] came this is is the type that after
[2:08:50] death there will be a resurrection
[2:08:54] Etc that was the sign God gave to
[2:08:57] Abraham through those animal
[2:09:03] cat
[2:09:04] cut that this is how you we were
[2:09:09] separated how Christ was cut at the
[2:09:12] calvary
[2:09:14] Etc I think for your own benefit you can
[2:09:17] go home and study it you will understand
[2:09:20] really the confirmation of the
[2:09:24] [Music]
[2:09:27] Covenant because with
[2:09:30] Abraham it God wanted this time to
[2:09:33] confirm the Covenant he had with
[2:09:38] Abraham and that's why it was those
[2:09:41] animal bird etc
[2:09:44] etc so let us stand on our feet
[2:09:49] and
[2:09:53] uh bow our head each one
[2:09:56] to speak a little word based on what you
[2:10:00] have
[2:10:04] learned what you want God to help you do
[2:10:08] in your
[2:10:11] life to realize your confirmation of the
[2:10:15] grace that you have
[2:10:17] received
[2:10:19] this
[2:10:20] message is a message of
[2:10:23] Grace all that we are it's Grace and let
