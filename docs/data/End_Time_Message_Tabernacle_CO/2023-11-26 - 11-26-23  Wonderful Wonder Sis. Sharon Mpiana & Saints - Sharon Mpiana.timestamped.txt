[0:00] may God bless you
[0:02] all so um this morning we just want to
[0:06] thank God for what he's done for
[0:11] us um as many of you know we have our
[0:15] first baby
[0:20] boy um and I just want to testify of
[0:24] what God has done for
[0:28] us um as many of you know it's been a
[0:31] little over two
[0:37] years that we we've been
[0:41] married and as any couple when we first
[0:44] got
[0:48] married uh we expected that you know God
[0:51] would give us a
[0:54] baby and after some time went on and
[0:58] on and we realized it wasn't
[1:03] happening um we I started questioning
[1:07] and
[1:09] wondering and being in the medical
[1:14] field I started wondering already what
[1:17] it could have been what could be the
[1:24] problem um and then I went to go I was
[1:28] discussing it with my husband
[1:30] [Music]
[1:32] and he told me just be calm be
[1:36] patient it will happen in God's
[1:39] time we'll just pray about
[1:42] it so after praying for some more
[1:47] time um I got impatient
[1:51] again and I told my husband that we
[1:54] should just go see a
[1:57] doctor um at first he was just like no
[1:59] no we'll pray about it let's
[2:04] wait and it kind of brought some back
[2:07] and forth between me and my
[2:10] husband because every time I would
[2:13] discuss I would want to ask him about
[2:16] it he just was so calm about it so
[2:21] relaxed and I told him I'm like at a
[2:24] certain point I even questioned
[2:26] him I was like do you even want to have
[2:29] children
[2:31] because every time you're just so calm
[2:33] about it's like you don't care
[2:39] like so after I kind of forced him back
[2:44] and we finally went to go see a
[2:48] doctor the doctor pretty much didn't
[2:51] tell us anything we couldn't find
[2:53] anything
[2:56] wrong they told us you're still young it
[2:58] will happen
[3:00] give us some general advice maybe it
[3:02] could be this it could be
[3:06] this so it was at that time that we
[3:10] realized that you know it's only God who
[3:12] gives
[3:14] life so we went into
[3:18] prayer and I remember at the time of the
[3:21] it was the July
[3:24] meetings uh we went to go see the pastor
[3:27] to pray for
[3:28] us
[3:31] it was a time that we were actually
[3:32] going through a lot of hardships a lot
[3:37] of but um we went and we bought him our
[3:43] offering and he prayed for
[3:45] us and after praying for
[3:48] us he told us don't
[3:52] worry you're going to have
[3:55] children you will have
[3:58] children yeah so so I kept that word in
[4:01] my mind what he
[4:03] said and every single time he kept
[4:06] encouraging us don't
[4:09] worry and he was always there supporting
[4:13] [Music]
[4:14] us so going through this time it was
[4:17] really
[4:19] tough it may only be two years but I
[4:22] feel like we went through a lot during
[4:23] that
[4:28] time
[4:30] sometimes as you know it is in our
[4:34] community people always ready to make
[4:36] comments at
[4:39] you what's wrong with
[4:41] you don't you see people who got married
[4:44] after you are already having
[4:46] children what's taking you so long not
[4:50] knowing what someone might be going
[4:53] through and I remember even one day I
[4:56] was teaching Sunday
[4:58] School
[5:01] and one of my kids said to
[5:04] me they're like sister Sharon we always
[5:06] see you carrying other people's
[5:10] babies but when are you going to carry
[5:12] your own
[5:14] baby so I felt bad in my heart but I
[5:17] just told
[5:18] them I said don't worry just pray for me
[5:20] I'm going to have a
[5:24] baby so and then I remember there was a
[5:27] time when brother OED came here brother
[5:34] and he really encouraged us with his
[5:37] testimony he spoke to us he prayed for
[5:42] us and um it was during that time that
[5:44] God really started dealing with us with
[5:46] me and both of us as a
[5:52] couple and um we were really in
[5:56] prayer there was times that we would
[5:58] come to church
[6:01] sometimes my husband would stay and
[6:02] sleep at the
[6:05] church we really created that atmosphere
[6:08] around
[6:10] us and then I remember there was a day I
[6:12] was feeling discouraged it was a
[6:17] Wednesday and I didn't feel like coming
[6:19] to
[6:22] church um and I remember telling God I'm
[6:26] like anyway what did I gain I've been
[6:28] coming to church
[6:30] never missed a
[6:33] service but still you're not blessing
[6:36] me but at the end I we spoke with my
[6:39] husband he ended up just convincing me
[6:41] to go to
[6:44] church and it was I remember it was a
[6:46] Wednesday evening brother Richard was
[6:50] preaching he was talking about the book
[6:53] of
[6:55] Rememberance so I remember um after the
[6:58] service it was really touching for
[7:02] me and the following day I came back to
[7:07] church and I started
[7:09] praying reminding God of all that I did
[7:12] for
[7:14] him all that my husband has done for
[7:18] him I told God that we walked in the
[7:21] right
[7:22] way we got married in the right way we
[7:25] honored the
[7:27] church we honored your word
[7:31] I dedicated my youth from the time that
[7:33] I was a
[7:37] teenager I started teaching the
[7:40] kids my husband since he was young
[7:43] everywhere he's been he's always served
[7:47] you so I remember being so
[7:52] desperate and I told God that I've been
[7:54] serving other people's
[7:58] kids I want to have my own
[8:01] children so after praying and crying out
[8:04] to
[8:07] him I opened the
[8:10] Bible and I remember the scripture I
[8:13] don't remember exactly what the
[8:15] reference
[8:17] was but I got an answer that
[8:21] said you will conceive and you will bear
[8:24] a
[8:25] son and I felt like that was God
[8:27] speaking directly to me
[8:31] and from that time on I held on to that
[8:35] word and I told my husband that we're
[8:37] going to have a
[8:39] son so um I I started building my
[8:45] faith um I had we have an empty room in
[8:48] our
[8:51] house and I started buying baby clothes
[8:54] and hanging it in the
[8:58] room
[8:59] we started discussing our baby names
[9:01] with my
[9:05] husband and we we continued in
[9:09] prayer um I remember there was also a
[9:12] fellowship that we had at our
[9:15] place we invited some of the young
[9:18] Brothers I remember it was brother
[9:20] brandham was
[9:22] there brother John was there brother
[9:25] Matthew M and they started sharing
[9:28] testimonies after
[9:31] testimonies and after they said a prayer
[9:33] for us in our
[9:36] home and I remember the atmosphere in
[9:39] that
[9:40] house I know that God heard that
[9:44] prayer because after just a little
[9:46] [Music]
[9:47] time I found out that I was
[9:52] expecting the day I found out it was
[9:54] just a shock to
[9:57] me at first I was in denial I couldn't
[10:01] believe I could even tell my
[10:04] husband until I went to confirm with the
[10:08] doctor and then we came and we I told
[10:11] him about
[10:14] it
[10:16] um after I discovered that I was
[10:21] expecting as the doctors always have
[10:23] something to
[10:26] say they told me that you have you know
[10:29] a lump on your side
[10:32] here maybe it might affect your
[10:34] pregnancy Maybe
[10:37] not maybe you might make it to fullterm
[10:39] maybe
[10:41] not so it it built a big fear in my
[10:48] heart and even though we were
[10:52] excited the devil came with fear in
[10:56] me telling me that I won't make it
[11:00] I'm going to miscarry the
[11:02] baby and I kept having dreams
[11:08] nightmares that I was losing the
[11:12] baby and I remember it was around the
[11:14] time that we went to
[11:17] Camp I think around three
[11:21] months um and we went and I was praying
[11:25] at the
[11:27] camp and I was like delivered from that
[11:33] fear so we thank
[11:35] god um that he gave us our
[11:39] son firstly I also want to say thank you
[11:42] to my
[11:45] husband because he was supportive of me
[11:48] the whole
[11:49] time he never once tried to stress me
[11:53] out he was always trying to encourage
[11:57] me and try to keep me
[12:00] calm I also want to thank God for our
[12:04] pastor for the ministers in our
[12:07] church for your prayers and for our
[12:11] encouragements thank God for our
[12:13] families both
[12:16] families who are always also encouraging
[12:18] and praying for
[12:20] us and also thank God for the church our
[12:23] church
[12:25] family because I know many of you were
[12:27] praying for us
[12:30] yes and we thank God that today we have
[12:31] our son
[12:35] [Applause]
[12:41] Shiloh so as we prepare our song um you
[12:45] can come forward for the special um the
[12:48] meaning of Shiloh is
[12:50] um a gift from
[12:53] God we got that that name in prayer one
[12:57] day brother brandham was talking about
[13:02] Shiloh as being the place where we
[13:05] received the
[13:08] blessing um and it's also meaning the
[13:12] promised one the
[13:15] Messiah is the place where Hannah and
[13:19] Hannah received her answer for
[13:25] Samuel so that's why we thank God
