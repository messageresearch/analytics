[0:07] I want to give a testimony about
[0:08] something that happened to me in the
[0:10] month of
[0:16] August uh one day I had my old manager
[0:19] who was
[0:27] black and since he was fired from the
[0:29] job we had a white manager who came
[0:37] in and when he came about two days
[0:42] later it was a
[0:48] Wednesday and that morning he suspended
[0:51] me from
[0:57] work um and since I work for the
[0:59] government they said that we'll send you
[1:01] the
[1:03] paperwork uh from all of the accusations
[1:06] from the
[1:08] [Music]
[1:12] boss and I told myself when it starts
[1:15] like this here in the US that's
[1:23] it and I told myself having another job
[1:26] isn't impossible but it's a whole
[1:28] process uh yeah certain
[1:36] there are other brothers who called me
[1:37] and I told them about that and other
[1:40] brothers told me we would pray about
[1:42] it it was a
[1:47] Wednesday I was so defeated in my In the
[1:53] Flesh and I said that that day I
[1:55] wouldn't be able to come up to the
[1:57] pulpit to
[1:58] interpret
[2:04] and I had brother Neville who had sent
[2:06] me the a message saying that you're
[2:08] going to
[2:13] interpret and I told myself after all
[2:15] the hits I've taken will I really be
[2:17] able
[2:18] to Something Told
[2:26] Me Something told me that you have to go
[2:29] up there might be the devil trying to
[2:31] discourage you but you have to go do
[2:33] God's
[2:34] work I got up
[2:40] here and that day I interpreted and
[2:42] people told me that that day was really
[2:48] good and I
[2:50] said and I said you don't know exactly
[2:53] what I'm going through but it's God that
[2:55] allowed it to be
[2:58] so I I started looking for other
[3:02] jobs after one week I
[3:08] prayed and I asked other brothers to
[3:10] pray with
[3:18] me um and um I was told that there was a
[3:22] meeting and uh with other bosses and I
[3:24] was supposed to be pres of
[3:28] thatting
[3:31] and during that time I didn't really
[3:32] have any access to the government
[3:39] systems and at the meeting they I was
[3:41] surprised they actually said no you can
[3:43] come back to
[3:48] work you have to sign all of the
[3:50] paperwork saying that you shouldn't do
[3:52] this you shouldn't do
[3:53] that I said no
[3:58] problem
[4:04] and well to backtrack I'm the only black
[4:08] person on
[4:10] [Music]
[4:19] the and I noticed some discrimination
[4:21] amongst the team uh seeing some habits
[4:24] that weren't good amongst members of the
[4:27] team and as we were listening to the
[4:36] word I said given the circumstances I
[4:39] have I could only show love towards
[4:42] these
[4:43] people and pray for
[4:49] them and we it went like this
[4:56] to um problem after problem saying that
[4:59] today won't work and tomorrow won't work
[5:05] either and I noticed after a certain
[5:07] while God had taken control of the whole
[5:14] situation and the people that were
[5:16] causing me problems were people that
[5:18] were now supporting
[5:24] me and during that time while I was
[5:27] looking for jobs I did multiple
[5:29] interview that they didn't hire me
[5:39] for and uh after a certain while with
[5:43] all that going on um I figured that that
[5:47] was the will for of God for
[5:50] me the reason why I'm
[5:53] testifying it's just a little
[5:56] experience when you go through diffic
[5:58] difficult moments
[6:00] if you have a work of God to do continue
[6:03] to do
[6:04] it if someone persecutes
[6:08] you love them and you will come out
[6:11] [Music]
[6:14] [Applause]
