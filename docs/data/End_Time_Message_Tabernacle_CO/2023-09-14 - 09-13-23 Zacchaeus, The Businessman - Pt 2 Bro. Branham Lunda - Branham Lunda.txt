Eden [Music] we thank you for that [Music] we have come hungry we have situation we have problems foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen we are going to open our Bible scripture Our scripture that we read uh Luke chapter 19. he knows 10 years as a Christian we are going to read in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I foreign foreign foreign and Jesus entered and passed through Jericho and behold there was a man named zakaris which was the chief among the Publican and it was a it was rich Jesus and he was and cool enough for the Press because it was leader of statue and you ran before and climbed up onto the sycamore tree to see him for he was to pass that way and when Jesus came to to the place he looked up and saw him and said unto him zacarius make Houston come down for the day I must abide at that house and he made Houston came down and received him joyfully and when they saw it they all murmured and say that it was going to be guests with a man that is sinner as the cures too then said unto the Lord behold Lord the half of my goods I give to the poor and if I have taken anything from any man by false accusation I restore him full fold and Jesus said unto him this day his salvation come to his this house forever so much as he also is the son of Abraham for this son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost amen amen you may be splitted and may God bless his word richly uh according for the place once more we want to thank the Lord for giving us another day because as I always said our Prophet told us every time every day when we wake up it's a miracle there's a purpose for that amen amen um and we shouldn't get used to it like when we wake up it's just as usual when God wakes us up we have a purpose for us uh the number in second just keep me in front of it foreign will ask us to bring the word again today we are so grateful for that amen amen as I always think it's a very hard work s the day before yesterday I was thinking God if it's possible you can take away a Ministry a call from somebody I was going to be the first person to ask for that but I don't know if I can do such a thing is [Music] it's very difficult to be a minister and much more the second has a problem with everybody with the education with the background as a comprehension maybe everybody has their own understanding a it takes God to do such a work amen amen in terms of time as the Pastor Peter preached last time we have always to pray for our pastors it's very important I'll go straight to the point was a little stature man he was taking care of the business he had business that he was taking care of uh but his wife has a chance to go listen to Jesus Christ is [Music] she saw how Jesus was Healing The Sick he was truly the prophet uh the prophet for what this the scripture spoke about Rebecca we said that his wife her name was Rebecca even though the Bible doesn't say it clearly the glass of the scripture the Bible gave us the name of his wife a Rebecca was praying a lot to see her husband believing the same message she believes she was interested and busy to think about the salvation of her husband amen amen the Notre family to think about the salvation of our fathers mothers and our beloved ones Rebecca when she was going to the meeting the meetings of Jesus when she was coming back home she used to explain to to tell her husband everything that was happening it happened that zacharius was a skeptical man he was always doubting about once again despite everything that the husband and the wife was telling him he did not pay attention to anything just to at least go and listen show your own conclusion hey in one day whose wife was talking to him all the time but he was not interested and Rebecca said now I have to pray for my husband and she prayed all night long foreign change the mind of her husband he was listening from foreign [Music] shaking the heart of the husband and you look for atmosphere God always hear them from four three well-dressed when he left home that's where we uh you went down it took the straight way amen amen foreign Street what does it mean s Affairs straight in your business you want to find him be honest be sincere amen amen be straight with God and with men be straight with your neighbor Allah then you are sure that you're going to find him amen amen if you want to find Jesus be straight with others let not be anything that will hinder youth Christians think they always have to be good with brothers and sisters in the church now when you go in the neighborhood life was in South Africa this brother is not a good brother if you want to find Jesus it's in a straight way you have to be honest then you're going to find amen amen foreign right thing just always be thinking right always be thinking right and I have a little slogan as he says Jesus do right that's your jury to God says Jesus think right that's your duty to yourself and you are bound to come and write amen amen to find Jesus it's on this straight Street and the the rights [Music] means we have to be right in everything right in our relationship right between the brothers and sisters right among the brothers [Music] he really blessed [Music] everybody will Reverend him alone because the one who confined the man not reform our faith is based on God Alone amen now what gives us the favor it's the case because of that position he became very ugly when his wife was giving him advice and presenting him uh you became like Jose's Aussies God blessed him God gave him a good position but one day when you acted wrong and the priest told him you shouldn't do that eh [Music] [Music] but we don't understand it says [Music] [Music] and when he got there some of those great people were standing there is a place to get up to see him they were hanging on the walls and everywhere you know there's something about it that when Jesus comes around it's always attracts somehow Elizabeth didn't know what I was doing was happening when he was seeking where should I stand was to see Jesus [Music] a he said I will stand by this tree as it's coming from this side coming on my way you'll see me one idea you just wanted to see Jesus I won't be able to climb up because he wasn't short because what should I do foreign well I won't be able to stand up maybe you'll be working working on the street with body bodyguards and you see the attitude that he has a point where he says but I do not believe that is a prophet is you know time hasn't changed those spirits still exists maybe there's some people coming there expectative is not under expectations he just comes to church because it's just we don't come to church because we feel like we can't be because we want God amen amen instead of taking the turn Okay uh foreign [Music] [Music] upon that tree [Music] [Music] was working uh [Music] it took the garbage pill it is [Music] and the garbage fell on him somebody was well dressed foreign foreign thank you foreign [Music] foreign when you are decided to meet Christ your blessing [Music] I will be able to see him foreign this is something different oh [Music] let me read it hi foreign [Music] sometimes discouragement happened in our Christian Life and the devil can use not people not even uh beloved brothers and sisters even my mother my sister for example for myself when I believe this message to discourage me and they wouldn't give me any food left these fees they wouldn't pay my students leave the message that was the devil it wasn't them critique and the critics and everything that can come away decided to see Jesus even if he has to be treated in all kinds of names they wouldn't be discouraged he'll do anything to see him if you are determined you wait your turn you'll do everything that you can just to see him from the people please I think the church should be more salted more than today and become an organization they exist that's right but you gotta have favor in itself it's the salt cellar the strength of Christ Living in you don't la force we will make him thirst to be like you amen amen [Music] that's the way we fail to forget Who We Are perfect sometime in front of situations somebody who wanted to believe the message maybe he was taking you as an example he told me the message I was living in the neighborhood with the family that believed the message I'm telling you people from the message you know the Bible these people were telling us we're in a denomination we are first God doesn't recognize us they're the only one who received the truth personally I started believing them but what I was still deciding to go to the church that's where I said in this world there's no increase in the message in the influence he says let's pay attention to our actions because we always influence somebody else without knowing it is maybe somebody is taking you in his example without telling you can't remember maybe in your family maybe in the church you influence somebody else but now I'm acting differently that foreign [Applause] [Music] when a man sees Christ Living in you say la Selah Louisiana you'll make him thirst to be like you stay alive he will make him see Jesus in you'll make him see God amen amen yes God will always be manifested through us how did they know Moses was of God and they know that God was with him amen amen may God help us continues [Music] you see that I hope every person here that hasn't met him yet Akinator and will he not convinced that is really born of the spirit of God you are standing on the limb tonight amen amen I hope you are staying where we are trying to see the Curious gods [Music] [Music] there's always something different uh compared to any other men if you you hear him talking you'll be like that Soldier Roman soldiers no man has ever spoke like him the priest spoke about things what you will do in the future amen amen that's that's the nature of things that's a human nature he always praise God for what he had done and he will praise God for what he will do in the future because you sent Jesus At The Cross but he said ignoring what he's doing [Music] [Music] [Music] we have to be grateful amen amen foreign did your work right now is identify you with them people back then because of good work I'm doing Jesus look at them you have the father of the for the fathers and we are in the test guard for what he did but we want to examine what we is doing today [Music] you could have been a good Christian all your life alone [Music] the present s the nature of men always acts like that but once a man look at Jesus once a man look at Jesus Christ he'll never play the man is no longer the same amen amen is no longer the same he can see manifested that's the reason why Muse the Holy Ghost let's Source the truth he still is both sides of the paper down to the distance both coming and going they can still talk The Life of Christ reflecting in darkness that was the purpose that the church might continue his work man but foreign the curious foreign but [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] he should be different from what we used continues he said and the bread has to be prepared foreign [Music] he says this what was the case maybe it's now Rebecca praying for you maybe it's a mother who went on acrossed another side of the curse the truth maybe a prayer still there at the house of God foreign [Music] Creed elections people in the message can have a Creed without knowing it yeah [Music] but no life that's a Creed [Music] he knows reverse [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] without him knowing [Music] [Music] because today [Music] [Music] even though that's right I have Assurance there's nothing to fear yes let's finish by reading the prophet he said this oh message maybe you believe the message because of the prayer of the mother who's who's gone already upon those prayers he said is the case went home repenting [Music] [Music] let this story first the more energy to win others [Music] yes I have to do this you became what he became okay amen amen may God grant us their Grace let us be salty foreign [Music] bless you foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] your heart [Applause] is [Music] [Music] [Music] and I do [Music] as he is [Music] and he [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] to see the queen [Music] [Music] [Music] let my faith stop you okay [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] he heard your prayers [Music] to bring a solution [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] thank you [Music] foreign [Music] foreign foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] I was me alone with our head about I think the eyes close to lose your family [Music] God beloved creator of heavens and earth novices [Music] humble [Music] receive our prayer forgive our just passes [Music] one way or another foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] do not look at us to [Music]
