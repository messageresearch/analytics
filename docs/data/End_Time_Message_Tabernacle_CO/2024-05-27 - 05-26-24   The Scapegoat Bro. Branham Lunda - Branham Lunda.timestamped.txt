[48:10] around we thank you we thank him so
[48:15] much we also like to to thank you for
[48:18] coming in the house of
[48:22] God I was meditating upon this scripture
[48:36] you know when the preacher is asked to
[48:38] preach uh he meditating upon a lot of
[48:40] scriptures here and
[48:42] there
[48:46] but but only God knows the needs of his
[48:52] people that is why we like to wait upon
[48:55] the Lord in the
[48:57] prayer to
[49:01] know in the midst of all the scriptures
[49:05] coming what does he want us to
[49:11] say when I was down
[49:18] there and I I heard the song that the
[49:21] song leader uh sang in the beginning of
[49:23] the
[49:25] service I said
[49:29] this is the confirmation of my message
[49:32] amen
[49:36] amen we always have to be under
[49:41] expectation and you the one
[49:45] preaching in another term another word
[49:48] it's your
[49:51] preparation that will make God to anoint
[49:53] the
[49:55] preacher no matter who
[49:59] preaching it all depend of what you are
[50:02] looking for amen
[50:06] amen and this morning I would like to
[50:10] exalt about the scap
[50:14] goat the scap
[50:21] goat says we read in the book in The
[50:24] Book of Leviticus chapter 16
[50:27] this is the Old
[50:31] Testament that's God speaking to
[50:34] Moses he said to
[50:38] Moses for the atonement of the
[50:45] people let them come and you going to
[50:47] take two
[50:48] goats tellon to take two
[50:54] goats the Two Goats will serve as an an
[50:58] atonement for the
[51:00] people one goat will be
[51:04] killed and they will take the blood of
[51:06] that
[51:08] goat will be uh poured on another
[51:15] goat and the second goat will be the
[51:18] es it will be freed in the
[51:21] wilderness away from the people are you
[51:24] with me
[51:29] while he will be wandering in the
[51:34] wilderness he will be the
[51:38] scapegoat and that will be the
[51:40] Forgiveness of your sins amen
[51:43] amen therefore there's one
[51:47] goat that is considered as a goat of
[51:53] guilt the goat that is guilty
[51:57] that represents
[51:59] sin there's another
[52:02] goat that is AAP
[52:09] goat to make the atonement of the other
[52:16] goats when I tried to compare the
[52:19] version of the Bible
[52:21] [Music]
[52:30] I'm using uh the other version called l
[52:33] in French the one I'm
[52:37] using another version is theames King
[52:40] King James James King
[52:44] James he's talking about the skap
[52:48] goat or the the sending goats the the
[52:51] messenger goats or the scap goats it's
[52:54] the same thing
[52:56] [Music]
[52:59] it's a synonym
[53:01] word it's a
[53:03] Escape it's a goat that has been
[53:06] taken to make the atonment for the
[53:10] sin and we are going to see
[53:13] together the Bible and the
[53:17] prophet and that go scap
[53:20] goat it's nothing less than the Lord
[53:23] Jesus
[53:25] Christ do you love the Lord amen amen
[53:30] amen we know that the
[53:38] go it's a ill Fame
[53:46] animal if you read in the Book of
[53:49] Matthew chapter
[53:54] five this is how Jesus is speaking about
[53:57] the
[54:04] goat is considering the the the goats as
[54:07] a people that don't don't do good
[54:10] they're not
[54:12] Believers Matthew chapter
[54:21] 25 if you can only take verse 32 or 33
[54:27] listen what the Bible is telling
[54:32] us and before him shall be gaed all
[54:35] nations and
[54:40] listen will it shall separate them one
[54:43] from the
[54:46] other as the shepherd divides his sheep
[54:49] from the
[54:53] goat he shall set the sheep on on his
[54:56] right
[54:58] hands but the goat on the
[55:03] left why the goat on the
[55:08] left because they are lost they are
[55:13] condemed now the Bible is explaining us
[55:17] that God in the end time in the time of
[55:21] judgment them people that don't want to
[55:23] receive Christ
[55:25] [Music]
[55:27] them that have no faith good
[55:30] faith God considers them as
[55:34] goats Sinners God takes them as
[55:38] goat and takes the True
[55:42] Believers and consider them as sheep are
[55:46] you with
[55:47] me therefore a
[55:50] goat it's something that is not
[55:53] good but here we find out
[55:57] God is telling Moses take take two goats
[56:01] and the
[56:05] goats he could say take a Ram or
[56:09] something but he said take the
[56:12] goat why the
[56:15] goat that represent everything that we
[56:18] just
[56:19] saw and why Jesus
[56:24] Christ has to identify himself as a
[56:29] scapegoat oh I really love the prophet
[56:33] he
[56:34] said in
[56:36] reality the Lord Jesus
[56:39] Christ is the more
[56:42] righteous is the holiest person on the
[56:46] earth is the person that never committed
[56:49] any sin that is why when he was on the
[56:52] earth he could tell the Pharisees
[56:57] who will convince me of sin no
[57:02] one therefore Jesus has not to be
[57:05] considered as a goat amen
[57:09] amen he's considered as a
[57:16] perfect he was 100% a man and 100%
[57:20] God but the reason
[57:23] why here
[57:26] is considered as a
[57:28] goat escap
[57:31] goat it's
[57:34] because him being the Lamb of
[57:37] God being the righteous of God to save
[57:42] me and to save
[57:46] you he had to leave that position
[57:51] of he had to leave that perfect position
[57:57] and to become a
[57:59] goat because goat
[58:03] represents when he becomes
[58:05] sin he becomes God hallelujah
[58:09] hallelujah when he become a
[58:13] God then is escap
[58:17] goat the one that at the sin hallelujah
[58:23] hallelujah bham said

[1:01:49] Judgment all the sins of the
[1:01:52] world had to lay upon him

[1:02:00] longer now he's considered as a
[1:02:03] goat to take your
[1:02:05] place and to take mine amen

[1:02:31] things when I saw how brother was
[1:02:34] explaining them I said oh wow this
[1:02:39] message this message is so
[1:02:43] wonderful in the same message living
[1:02:48] dying preach April
[1:02:53] 3rd parag 38
[1:02:59] in that uh
[1:03:02] [Applause]
[1:03:04] bearing it was represented in the Old
[1:03:09] Testament whether what they were doing
[1:03:11] in the Old
[1:03:15] Testament where go when God ordained to
[1:03:17] Aaron to take two
[1:03:20] [Applause]
[1:03:23] goats it was the preview of for
[1:03:26] Redemption of the New
[1:03:28] Testament you
[1:03:32] know the Old Testament is the shadow of
[1:03:35] the New
[1:03:37] Testament that means it was just the
[1:03:40] shadow but the true
[1:03:44] reality will happen in the New Testament
[1:03:46] amen
[1:03:48] amen the Old
[1:03:51] Testament that
[1:03:54] go despite that he was doing the
[1:03:57] atonment
[1:03:59] but the sin was not taken
[1:04:04] away the sin was just covered that's
[1:04:08] right it was not cleansed taken away it
[1:04:12] was just covered
[1:04:16] why because the Old Testament was the
[1:04:19] shadow he was
[1:04:21] foring he was just showing later on
[1:04:26] there will be a
[1:04:28] reality that will come for the
[1:04:30] Forgiveness of the sin and the
[1:04:34] Forgiveness will not be just a
[1:04:37] cover will be wiped away amen
[1:04:42] amen that is say
[1:04:45] here in the Old
[1:04:50] Testament there was The Bu that
[1:04:52] represented in the Old Testament
[1:04:56] they had
[1:05:01] two they had a sin offering at the
[1:05:04] cleansing of the
[1:05:07] sanctuary and that sin
[1:05:12] offering was that they taken two
[1:05:16] goat and one goat was
[1:05:18] killed and the
[1:05:23] other and the other goat had sin that
[1:05:26] was placed upon the dead
[1:05:29] boat put upon the Lov one or the living
[1:05:34] one do you follow me my young people do
[1:05:38] you
[1:05:43] follow sisters you
[1:05:48] good you're the people that Pastor
[1:05:50] always ask
[1:05:52] questions because he knows us better
[1:05:56] I want to make sure everybody gets it
[1:05:58] because if you understand this you know
[1:06:01] the Bible
[1:06:02] says Jesus was the one saying I praise
[1:06:06] you
[1:06:07] father because you have hidden these
[1:06:09] things to the wise and the
[1:06:13] prant and Jesus had
[1:06:15] it and it happens that they can preach
[1:06:21] and and people don't understand it why
[1:06:28] it's the devil that makes people not
[1:06:30] understand because Jesus
[1:06:32] said because if they
[1:06:34] understand they will
[1:06:37] repent and if they
[1:06:40] repent and God will be obligated to
[1:06:42] bless
[1:06:43] them and God the the devil doesn't want
[1:06:46] you to be blessed that is why when we
[1:06:48] come to
[1:06:49] [Music]
[1:06:51] church we try to understand why God is
[1:06:54] telling to tell us
[1:06:58] because that's where the secret of our
[1:07:00] blessings amen
[1:07:03] amen therefore in the Old Testament what
[1:07:05] was
[1:07:07] happening if you
[1:07:11] sinned uh the the the Lord uh the Lord
[1:07:14] acquired the blood for the
[1:07:17] Forgiveness therefore if I
[1:07:21] sinned normally I had to give up my own
[1:07:24] life
[1:07:26] then how was I going to give my own
[1:07:28] blood if I was going to die and God said
[1:07:32] in this
[1:07:34] case the children of
[1:07:36] Israel let them come with
[1:07:40] animals and very specific
[1:07:45] case he said the worshippers will be
[1:07:48] represented by Two
[1:07:51] Goats so the Sinners comes with the
[1:07:53] books
[1:07:56] and the goats represent the Sinner and
[1:07:59] when they were killing
[1:08:01] theat the animal had to be
[1:08:05] washed which is the type of the baptism
[1:08:07] of water are you with
[1:08:10] me and the worshiper will touch the
[1:08:13] animal and they will slow the
[1:08:16] animal that means the
[1:08:19] animal was making the atonment for
[1:08:23] you because the blood the law requires
[1:08:26] the blood
[1:08:28] Hallelujah then the
[1:08:31] blood the blood of that
[1:08:35] animal that kind of the blood that will
[1:08:37] bring they were they were bringing in
[1:08:39] the
[1:08:40] sanctuary and in this case of the
[1:08:44] goats The Sinner that comes with his
[1:08:48] goat that represent himself The
[1:08:52] Sinner they will take the blood of that
[1:08:54] goat
[1:08:58] and they take another goat alive are you
[1:09:01] with
[1:09:03] me the other goat is not
[1:09:06] dead but they take the blood of the Dead
[1:09:09] one and they'll put it on the live
[1:09:13] one let's go
[1:09:16] slowly this keep the
[1:09:21] quat remember
[1:09:24] Jesus was a
[1:09:27] sheep he was a
[1:09:31] lamb but in this
[1:09:34] case he became a
[1:09:39] goat he was rightousness because he was
[1:09:43] God the
[1:09:45] Sheep but he came a
[1:09:49] goat he became sin
[1:09:57] that he might be the sin offering for me
[1:09:59] and
[1:10:02] you from a sheep to a
[1:10:10] goat and Jesus was represented in both
[1:10:14] the
[1:10:15] animals do you follow

[1:16:42] [Music]
[1:16:43] true and the most surely the
[1:16:47] truth

[1:16:58] all those great things were Beyond human
[1:17:01] Expressions amen
[1:17:04] amen that produ forg forg that's the
[1:17:08] reason why
[1:17:12] beloved if you see in your
[1:17:18] life you still a liar today you repent
[1:17:21] tomorrow it comes back today you li
[1:17:25] ask yourself that
[1:17:27] [Music]
[1:17:29] question have you really received the
[1:17:34] scapegoat is Jesus a scap goat for
[1:17:38] you because if it's a scap
[1:17:41] goat he will deliver
[1:17:44] you there's
[1:17:46] nothing that will be in your
[1:17:51] life without God
[1:17:53] deliver now
[1:17:56] there's a
[1:17:58] theory of Seventh Day
[1:18:03] Adventist with the leader Dr
[1:18:07] Smith he misinterpreted the
[1:18:12] Bible say if there's an Adventist here
[1:18:15] for
[1:18:19] me I'm not here to speak evil against
[1:18:22] that man
[1:18:23] [Music]
[1:18:24] but I just want to express what I feel
[1:18:26] or what I
[1:18:28] believe the doctor John
[1:18:30] Smith he's teaching people
[1:18:39] that the goat of the
[1:18:43] atonement he said the goat that goat was
[1:18:45] the Lord
[1:18:47] Jesus and the
[1:18:50] escapegoat is the
[1:18:52] devil because he's going in the
[1:18:54] wilderness
[1:18:57] and Dr John
[1:19:00] Smith is saying according to his
[1:19:02] understanding said that's the devil the
[1:19:05] devil that's a
[1:19:08] mistake I thank the prophet some of us
[1:19:11] here we don't even know the
[1:19:14] Bible this
[1:19:16] Bible even people going in the
[1:19:21] Seminary they're trying to to place
[1:19:23] calendar in the Bible
[1:19:27] but but it
[1:19:31] happens when they don't even get to
[1:19:34] understand what it means by
[1:19:36] calendar but the Bible itself
[1:19:44] says God does not do anything before
[1:19:47] revealing his secret to his servant the
[1:19:50] prophet that means the
[1:19:53] Bible it's the Great Wilderness of
[1:19:58] forest or if you don't know the forest
[1:20:00] you can be
[1:20:04] lost it takes the guide who's used to
[1:20:07] live in the forest
[1:20:14] jungle and the prophet is the guide that
[1:20:17] is used with the atmosphere of
[1:20:22] God he's the one that interpret what God
[1:20:26] said said in this
[1:20:30] message question answer number
[1:20:38] one
[1:20:40] 23rd uh
[1:20:42] August 64 it says
[1:20:53] this or paragra
[1:20:55] paragraph
[1:21:00] 105 Prophet
[1:21:06] says no more than Dr
[1:21:09] Smith on the Seventh Day
[1:21:13] Adventist on the sacrifice
[1:21:21] goats he said one goat that was uh there
[1:21:25] was they killed one two
[1:21:27] goats on the day of sacrifice the day of
[1:21:30] the
[1:21:31] atonement one goat was
[1:21:33] killed and the other were turned loose
[1:21:36] and
[1:21:40] then and then he said the God that was
[1:21:42] killed represented
[1:21:45] Jesus our sin
[1:21:48] Bearer you
[1:21:49] [Music]
[1:21:51] see that died
[1:21:56] but the goat that was turned
[1:21:59] loose represented the
[1:22:03] devil that bears our sins and goes away
[1:22:06] into eternity
[1:22:07] with when you don't have the
[1:22:11] prophet you won't understand this Bible
[1:22:14] amen amen for
[1:22:19] him he said the the the God that was
[1:22:21] turn loose in the wilderness
[1:22:25] it's the devil that went away with our
[1:22:28] sins if the devil is running away with
[1:22:31] our
[1:22:32] sins that means we don't have
[1:22:35] forgiveness are we are you with me joh
[1:22:38] Smith for the do John Smith he
[1:22:43] said and the
[1:22:45] sacrifice represented
[1:22:48] Jesus and the
[1:22:50] scapat represented the
[1:22:53] devil say no you
[1:22:57] see you
[1:22:58] see to my
[1:23:03] opinion if this ever gets back to
[1:23:06] Adventist
[1:23:08] brother I'm not saying nothing about
[1:23:11] this that great man Dr
[1:23:16] Smith we are not here to criticize men
[1:23:20] of no matter who he is Catholic or not
[1:23:25] we are not against them
[1:23:28] people we are just against the spirit
[1:23:30] after them am
[1:23:32] amen say say the same thing
[1:23:35] here he was he was a smart
[1:23:40] Christian a intelligent fine culture man
[1:23:44] believer but you
[1:23:46] see to
[1:23:47] [Music]
[1:23:49] me it doesn't make
[1:23:51] sense when you do that
[1:23:56] you are sacrificing to the devil amen
[1:23:59] you
[1:24:00] see for the
[1:24:02] prophet
[1:24:06] prophet he said they both represented
[1:24:09] CHR
[1:24:12] burial and the resurrection of Christ am
[1:24:16] amen the B God in the oldest
[1:24:21] represented death
[1:24:26] resurrection of
[1:24:28] Christ Contin
[1:24:30] say he also died for our
[1:24:34] sins and carried our sins far
[1:24:38] away both of them was
[1:24:42] Christ we see Christ in the Old
[1:24:45] Testament we see Christ in the New
[1:24:48] Testament both of
[1:24:50] them New and Old Testament
[1:24:54] speak of the same
[1:24:56] God that is why
[1:24:59] say Jehovah of the Old
[1:25:02] Testament Jehovah Jesus in the New
[1:25:06] Testament it's just the god that changes
[1:25:08] his
[1:25:09] form he doesn't change his ways
[1:25:13] Hallelujah may his name be
[1:25:15] blessed our
[1:25:18] scapegoat it's the Lord Jesus
[1:25:21] Christ is the one who died for my sin
[1:25:26] is's the one who died for your
[1:25:28] sin now you
[1:25:30] know the
[1:25:33] sin it's
[1:25:36] unbelief and you see the devil with
[1:25:40] that there's a lot of things attached to
[1:25:44] the curse is attached to sin is it
[1:25:49] true
[1:25:52] C if they can there's a curse it's
[1:25:56] because of
[1:25:57] sin if we can say
[1:26:00] there's sickness it's because of sin if
[1:26:03] we can say there's a poverty it's
[1:26:05] because of
[1:26:07] sin but the
[1:26:09] scapegoat when he
[1:26:11] comes he swall all that to free
[1:26:16] you he goes into the
[1:26:20] Wilderness it's to give you Victory
[1:26:23] Deliverance amen

[1:26:28] blessed now
[1:26:40] listen in them time in the Old
[1:26:44] Testament the
[1:26:47] goat the attonement that that was done
[1:26:55] that couldn't take away the
[1:27:02] sin look what men were capable of doing
[1:27:06] back
[1:27:08] then I'm in this
[1:27:13] message God is hiding and reveal himself
[1:27:15] in
[1:27:16] Simplicity he
[1:27:20] said paragraph uh 41
[1:27:29] said Moses under the blood of
[1:27:34] bulls and
[1:27:40] goat with his confession in the word of
[1:27:47] God and God could take that simple
[1:27:52] man and put his word in his
[1:27:57] mouth I want the church to understand
[1:28:02] this and God had to take his own
[1:28:07] word put it to put it in a mortal being
[1:28:10] like you and
[1:28:11] I in them
[1:28:13] days
[1:28:18] where the cleansing of sin were done
[1:28:20] with bulls and
[1:28:22] goats then
[1:28:26] Pro he had proven that he was the
[1:28:28] servant of
[1:28:30] Jehovah
[1:28:32] for he could walk
[1:28:38] there and Je spoke to him by vision and
[1:28:43] he walked out
[1:28:48] there and stretch his hands toward the
[1:28:51] east
[1:28:54] and stretch his button his Ro toward the
[1:28:57] East and he
[1:28:59] said now
[1:29:02] remember God spoke to
[1:29:05] him God that's God's
[1:29:08] thoughts God uses
[1:29:11] man God spoke to him it's right he
[1:29:19] said go straight that road in your hands
[1:29:23] toward the east
[1:29:26] and
[1:29:27] say
[1:29:30] flies and mes under the blood of the
[1:29:36] sheep walked out there and took that
[1:29:40] stick reached toward the East and
[1:29:45] said thus say the Lord let be flies
[1:29:58] while Moses was speaking they never
[1:30:00] heard any
[1:30:02] fly now
[1:30:06] listen is taking us
[1:30:10] somewhere to lift up our
[1:30:13] faith so that you
[1:30:15] understand that you're not just
[1:30:21] anybody and he said the Lord
[1:30:24] Let There Be
[1:30:26] flies never heard a
[1:30:29] fly Moses pronounced the word he said he
[1:30:34] take his stick he look to the
[1:30:37] east say the Lord let it be
[1:30:41] flies the next
[1:30:44] minute not even a
[1:30:46] mosquito not even a
[1:30:52] fly you think when he said that got Den
[1:30:56] act now
[1:30:58] listen when he pronounced the
[1:31:01] word Moses
[1:31:04] left he was sure about who he
[1:31:08] was and then he said and he
[1:31:13] left it's already
[1:31:17] spoken it's already been
[1:31:20] spoken for Moses it's done
[1:31:26] deal but for the

[1:45:42] here there was
[1:45:45] somewhere they took a young
[1:45:50] boy and he he was taken in the SL
[1:45:55] y he was taken in
[1:45:59] slavery when he was taken in
[1:46:02] slavery that
[1:46:04] man that little young
[1:46:06] man he was lifted
[1:46:09] up it was raised in a Christian
[1:46:14] family oh we used to
[1:46:16] say it happens to me
[1:46:20] sometime some of you that born in the
[1:46:22] message
[1:46:23] your father and mother in the
[1:46:26] message you are born in the
[1:46:30] message sometime you don't understand
[1:46:32] the importance of the message but let me
[1:46:34] tell you
[1:46:35] here let me take your
[1:46:38] defense that little
[1:46:41] [Music]
[1:46:44] boy he was born of the parent in the
[1:46:47] message his father and
[1:46:51] mother gave their life to Jesus
[1:46:54] Christ and the mother was teaching to
[1:46:56] the
[1:46:58] child the mother was teaching him Bible
[1:47:03] stoies there was one scripture she loved
[1:47:06] to
[1:47:07] read that was Isaiah Isaiah 53 and the
[1:47:12] the
[1:47:15] child that led a foundation in that
[1:47:19] child is to encourage you when you have
[1:47:22] your
[1:47:24] child speak to them about
[1:47:27] God
[1:47:30] because even if you think they don't
[1:47:32] understand it it's the word of God it's
[1:47:36] not your
[1:47:38] word the word that you keep repeating to
[1:47:40] your
[1:47:42] child let me tell you that the same word
[1:47:45] that created the
[1:47:47] world even if the child seems to be
[1:47:50] stubborn stubborn
[1:47:53] job just
[1:47:55] repeat it is
[1:47:59] written the Bible says hallelujah
[1:48:02] hallelujah and one day that
[1:48:06] word will create something in
[1:48:10] him in this
[1:48:12] message the the
[1:48:15] pardon
[1:48:16] says and one
[1:48:19] day I was told this a certain story
[1:48:23] that really helped
[1:48:25] me me
[1:48:27] too that really helped me a lot you
[1:48:31] know this message is in such a way
[1:48:36] that even if you read a
[1:48:38] scripture it's been a
[1:48:41] while and you read it
[1:48:44] again I don't know what happens with
[1:48:48] God it's it's like the day you're
[1:48:50] reading it
[1:48:54] you have the impression that you never
[1:48:55] read it before
[1:48:58] why because the word of God
[1:49:01] is God will never
[1:49:03] fail the holy
[1:49:06] scriptures always have
[1:49:09] life and that really helped
[1:49:12] me and I believe that will help you
[1:49:18] too and beginning of my first days
[1:49:23] a boy was taken
[1:49:28] away all of you had taken Bible stories
[1:49:33] history and taken the history of the
[1:49:38] church I believe it was the
[1:49:42] fox it wasn't it was the N
[1:49:46] fathers stri or the life of St Patrick
[1:49:50] St patri or St Patrick
[1:49:55] that was just a man the name given to
[1:49:58] him his name was
[1:50:04] suat he was kidnapped by a bunch of sea
[1:50:10] Rovers and was hired out as a o
[1:50:19] Razer and this story goes that this k
[1:50:22] was kidnapped and taken aboard on the
[1:50:26] ship and he was working his way amen
[1:50:30] amen he was working his way in the boat
[1:50:34] where he was
[1:50:36] taken while he was
[1:50:39] working as a
[1:50:41] slave one
[1:50:43] day the old
[1:50:45] Captain the the the
[1:50:48] captain he fell
[1:50:51] sick when he fell
[1:50:54] sick he was about to
[1:50:57] die and then he
[1:50:59] said what am I going to do
[1:51:02] here way far in the
[1:51:05] sea maybe I don't know there's no
[1:51:09] physician around
[1:51:11] here but he realized that he was about
[1:51:13] to get to die when he realized
[1:51:18] that he called all the the
[1:51:21] crew all two members come here come here
[1:51:25] they came
[1:51:26] along he said listen
[1:51:28] up I'm
[1:51:31] dying maybe in a few minutes in a few
[1:51:35] seconds I will certainly
[1:51:37] die but
[1:51:39] now I need the word of
[1:51:42] God
[1:51:44] beloved maybe for
[1:51:47] you the fact that you just came to
[1:51:50] church you feel like it's very
[1:51:56] annoying the fact that you you listening
[1:51:58] the
[1:51:59] word you feel you you feel like it's
[1:52:01] very
[1:52:03] annoying the pastor may ask you to do

[1:52:10] to do oh
[1:52:12] brother the day you
[1:52:14] get you get close to
[1:52:17] death that's where you will
[1:52:20] realize if I really had time

[1:52:27] time let's work for the glory of
[1:52:30] God while you have the Breath of
[1:52:32] Life young Brothers young sisters the
[1:52:35] Bible
[1:52:37] says rejoice in your

[1:52:47] it God will hold you
[1:52:50] responsible while we have the Breath of
[1:52:52] Life
[1:52:54] that work for the
[1:52:57] master if we have to do something for
[1:53:00] God let us do it
[1:53:03] correctly or don't do it at all amen
[1:53:08] amen if I have to play
[1:53:10] music I have to consecrate myself in
[1:53:13] such a way that when I
[1:53:16] play I know the
[1:53:18] anointing and that can heal somebody
[1:53:20] hallelujah hallelujah
