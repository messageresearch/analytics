========================================

[Music] i know that you love me that's the greatest love story [Music] full restoration [Music] for redemption that's why seven angels in a clown destined [Music] let's all stand please [Music] [Music] i know that [Music] that's the greatest [Music] [Music] longer than [Music] me [Music] to be a sanctuary [Music] try [Music] oh i'll be [Music] here [Music] this is our [Music] really tried and [Music] [Applause] [Music] i'll be earlier [Music] dear heavenly father we want to thank you for the privilege and opportunity you have given to us tonight to come into your presence lord with a desire in our heart to comply with your word we pray father that you give us a special grace as we are speaking your word so that something come and reveal unto us what we need to do for our hearing for our deliverance so that we can know because you are the holy god you are the creator of heaven and earth there is no demon that can stand into your presence you know exactly what each one of us has to do in order to obtain the healing we have seen many many examples in the bible some place you have just to spill on the count and take the mud and anoint eyes for the eyes to be opened we have seen incident instances where you will allow just a person to come and touch your garment and be healed father you have made a lot of circumstances and we pray for us to tonight that you create something in the faith that can touch you in a special way bless the reading of thy word and bless what will be said all for your own glory and honor we are asking in jesus mighty name amen amen may god bless you you may see it we are going to continue with our principles the principles of god and last sunday we spoke about the principle of confession showing that confession is something very important bonham has shown us many examples that you can cry you can scream but if your life doesn't lie doesn't line up with the word review and i believe during this series everything that every example every case just take it personally to the example and the claim in that principle because god cannot work outside of his principles [Music] he could see a vision for my case god could show him something for my case can be possible that possible would not be possible also because if you listen to brother barnabas he will say you know i only do what god showed me jesus himself said the same thing jesus i only do what the father showed me and you will see brother when i'm skipping many people see that person over there [Music] i think in one of the message record and learn the massage i just give you messages to go listen you have done some of the message because as a human being i cannot tell you everything that i come across in hong kong that means there is somewhere where you need the faith faith will kick in and that will come by the hearing of the word as you give yourself one and you will have what you are looking for and you see brother panama was uh listening uh this morning the tape diseases disease and afflictions but as he come to criticize the community but just come believing and just say lord if it did not happen yesterday it's a new amen amen so from uh sunday message the message we said we saw that uh brother banam saying that don't even come into the prayer line of wife if see you don't have faith to believe stephen have a palace if you have you don't have condemnation in your heart you even have a party condemnation just come believing just as they need quiet all things are possible and uh from uh what brother bonham which what we spoke about last sunday i think we closed up with uh the case of that woman called she was a married woman in from marie she was a sunday school teacher and uh he was going insane over 10 years and uh nothing could have done to help her vienna and uh we saw that even brother branham came and they met that woman somewhere again on the streets there was no result why why because there was to sin basketball confessing that god principles as the concept that year you can say oh if i could be in the william branham meeting i cannot believe even if you could be in jesus meetings with your unconfessed scene confessing you will stay with it how many were resurrected in the jesus ministry combined the bible said multitude in the military and abraham told us multitudes over two thousand say depleted jesus came talk just to one person like one person heal that person and so the important thing is important is for you individually individual to follow the principles god will not act outside of his principles so speaking about that woman they said to them brother came and prayed a second time nothing yeah and that woman he said foreign spend a lot of money in the psychiatrist in louisville she could have traveled everywhere changing [Music] patient confesses your situation will be worse what a situation for some period and that woman could go until she will be completely crazy somewhere but i'm asking you about your which level is that i can lick my voice she has to try everything they are like 2a but she was still feeling something is missing i'm no longer me what do i need to do but i'm even praying saying here in the message faith without works for to regardless of the case malgrelica but there is that sparking things yes it shows that you do have me and that's why we are preaching the way we are doing it to help someone god in his mercy you don't have misery has revealed what your trouble is amen amen and that's what we want really to see say second form of war god in his mercy you don't god came in his mercy then he's recorded and he should give a vision he had the name vision and in that vision he don't say division god show brother branham on what the unconfessed scene was say and as soon as that woman fix it okay said before miscellaneous and she fixed it the way the word said you should fix it and if you fix it otherwise you will say i fix it mr but if that doesn't meet the principle of god my sis because if you follow that story when brother told her to go fix it [Music] and when you follow that principle then it will work allah after he told her a picky lady and she went and fixed it with the husband and the husband was also in the same case he also fixed his condition he knows he missed our condition they come together with one mind one accord if we agree with some of that then god will act hello because there is between you and somebody don't continue with your offering continue perfect leave it less less go first and fix it then come here otherwise god will not accept your sacrifice among many principles of god that may please your precipitate so after confession then we brother had a prayer of faith that was that prayer of faith that delivered that woman he had delivered that to produce the healing so for tonight as we continue along those is welcome to continue for title the principle of a prayer of faith after confession appella confess you in the divine healing [Music] yeah there is a principle of a prayer yeah i'm conceived yet we cannot dis uh um despise the prayer on a paper denigral up here but which prayer prayer it's a prayer of faith and you cannot ever pray of faith if there is a condemnation in your condemnation about the girl if there is a condemnation you see a condemnation you can be a prayer but don't talk about the prayer of faith amen amen you see the bible voila give me james the name of jacques chapter 5. we read it on sunday james 5 verse 14. i want you to know these days the bible says is any sick among you let anointing him with oil in the name of the lord will only the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the lord shall raise him up sovereign we'll forgive your sins pardon have a passion and the next verse versus river confess your fault one to another confess [Music] one for another um amen so for title tonight the principle of a prayer of faith the principal appearance after confession a prayer confession in divine healing not like arizona and we are going to take our texts tonight in second kings yes second kings chapter 20. i know that uh we have read this scripture in many ways uh that's the same scripture also that the brotherhood used very often uh from the book of isaiah 38. i say we'll see under but i want to use the one in second king chapter 20. regarding hezekiah concerning second king chapter 20. we read verses one to seven verses in those days was hezekiah sick unto death and the prophet isaiah the son of amos came to him and said unto him just say the lord set thine house in order for thou shalt die and not leave your life done then he turned his face to the wall and prayed unto the lord saying he is i beseech thee oh lord remember now how i have walked before thee in the truth and with a perfect heart and have done that which is good in thy sight and ezekiel wept as and it came to pass before isaiah was gone out into the middle court that the lord of the word of the lord came to him saying turn again and tell hezekiah the captain of my people just said the lord the god of david thy father i have heard thy prayer i have seen thy tears behold i will heal thee on the third day thou shalt go up and to the house of the lord and say the letter and i will add unto thy days 15 years and i will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of assyria and i will defend the city for my own sake and for my servant david's sake [Music] foreign and isaiah said take a lamp of figs and they took and laid it on the boil and he recovered [Music] and before we go further i want you to notice the solution the solution and that's the reason why i prefer to read in the second king then in isaiah because in uh isaiah they said it towards the end it will be a long reading but i want you to know this javed just take a lump of figs in a mass defeat and they took it and laid it on the boil and he recovered he the is of what need to be done for your problem and here the bible i heard the bottom out and saying you'd say yeah in a friendship of hamart and in english they call it boil an angle on a pencil boil but brother bonham said it was not a boy but if you go back to the first verse the bible said just uh something swollen who was just in grocery because something that's just a swollen basket yeah they just that could have been started like a simple buoyancy and then it progressed if we say and it become like a cancer it's a divine command can say so that was the case as the kaya was dealing with so that was not something uh a simple disease sente by in malady symbol i mean we can talk about the blind bartimaeus we can talk about the other blind the born blind but those were not sicknesses leading to death messenger but when we are dealing with cases today mechanus returns like the kawajordu of divine healing de la garison living we are going to the extreme nozzle extreme disease touching death like uh cancer can say like uh uh maybe in the time of the bible leprosy we want to know to read the first brother because what i said is what exactly what he said this exactly in the message god doesn't call men to judgment without first warning paragraph 41. as a king maybe he was uh walking around his palace maybe he fell around the fence and then uh he got a cat he better and uh it's swollen a little bit it's a loud conflict and uh it continued continuing until it becomes like a cancer illegitimately the new command can say and then he realized that his life was threatening to death but in that condition maidan said condition as we said about principles maybe he started taking the medicine in his uh house of pharmacy and then he went to see the doctors if we live while the doctor by the way somebody was telling me you know when trump got the virus they looked the entire floor is all made to turn it alive the entire floor in the hospital is on the best doctors the major doctor and they say he's a treatment cost we don't know how much money in this zone that was the president of the united states and i was also yesterday looking on the internet internet i saw the air force one larger view living presidency air force one air force one i was going through they have a hospital in the in the airplane lopita the president of the united states the president is unique they have the best equipment it's only mayor's equipment i saw the operating room in the plane down last year with the best doctors i think the mayor doctor best is uh uh surgeon avec le mayo so the trump is traveling i know trump can't even it's not only about the trump it's all the president so when they are traveling i look at the picture the operating table i look at the monitors you can travel with the president all the places president if the president is not sick philip is done upon my life you have nothing to do with a very nice look at the paycheck paycheck probably we are in the wrong job so probably some examples but that's what it is message can say with the virus i think trump was five days in the hospital that was it somebody at that age he received the best treatment now what the criticism are not secular critics the virus killed a lot of americans research america they never tried all those diseases how does the treatment operate oh that treatment is not yet approved oh no say that is not yet approved so i'm saying this rejecting to show you the case of ezekiel when his sickness was getting worse constantly the bodyguard le garduko was saying dizzy because pascal you know some of the presidents certainly the president they have religious councillors is on the conservative ah so ezekiel is a dialect of them prophet and at that time yesterday it was the prophet elisha prophet ely oh no he was the prophet uh isaiah prophet one of the greatest prophets learn the pluton prophet who wrote the 66th book of the bible et cetera so they said a.d isaiah you're the big prophet oregon prophet go tell us what the matter is so when they saw isaiah everybody was running isaiah isaiah they wanted to know the condition of uh maybe uh the chief of staff chef the cabinet prophet prophet what about the president just say the lord you know when you know everything that said the lord's a villain and for the prophet isaiah hello the prophet is there was no doubt did you ever do he got the yes he was halfway illegal god did not look at how long his sickness has been in lady hezekiah turned against the world and he made his confession confession and he the tears came down you see the impact of sincere repentance who will impact the unconfessional senses the impact of confession impacted the confession that will produce a prayer of faith and that's and you move if which your power maybe a few minutes you were still in the court called like that question in the prayers this is what the prayer does the second second fellow prayer doesn't change that said the lord strong i have seen his prayers the views of the year go back again because i cannot send somebody through because if i send somebody a decision this one is right after there is no big authority in your power plug no big authority in uh the word plugin if all the curses [Music] is [Applause] after confession [Applause] amen amen that's what we are here because it's a principle and at the end we will outline in the case of ezekiel which principle was used to [Music] when the prophet told him godly prophet you he cried prophet was going el prophet the bodyguard prophet prophet they called you antapel what is the condition of our president condescending god said the lord is was halfway maybe two hours if not less that prayer changed god's mind the prayer of faith this and i'm a god of princesses i have to follow my own principles because the king basically have to follow the principles that's revealed therefore i am obligated this was obligated to respond and then he went to the prophet prophet isaiah isaiah said the lord and see the listener he's gonna leave aviva isaiah is the prophet a prophet and prophet he's just the mouth of god what god put second you ready what do you want me to do let's get your vacation first we some people they didn't want even to create a person when he came to the king the king knowing what he has been going through that i've been praying for yeah i have done all that i needed your faith two seconds i will follow every principle as soon as he saw the prophet prophet something stole him like that's it and the prophet is looking prophetic just say the lord receding you are gonna leave you have evil and in three days they don't wash you you will even be in church worship you say remember god doesn't call men to judgment without first warning 41. i was told to make ready and get ready because that he had to meet his maker now did you notice his plea here hey market supplies are so supple you see lord i beseech you to consider me please consider hey i have a work before you with a perfect heart eventually rather to get to a divine healing divine your heart is and the brother said when he said it and he like this he was telling god he decided i've walked before you with a perfect heart god did not blame and yet god changed his mind about him he wanted to do something and god said he would give us the desires quality just do i want to be healed because that i have a big face no no there should be a right motive is that objective if lord you know when you have to say with my sickness condition like conditions sometimes it's hard to go even to church but for some difficulties sometimes it's hard to go even do something for you perform difficult if that motive is correct system motif correct god will quickly help you would you ever happy tomorrow's a day but if your motive is save automotive he said he got a cancer on him a lady like you the conceptually or something another okay and they call it a boy on a pencil in that day but we know boys don't regularly kill you they just get well they say this but it was perhaps a cancer and it opened up like a boy is it a sort of communion pool because the bible said that's gonna be blessed hezekiah was sick and to death [Music] because a thank god for the prophet but it was perhaps a cancer veteran and it opened up like a boy and the guy told isaiah said hey judea is go up there [Music] you got to be a you got to be a reason for it it's just like this scripture that i so often referred to if you say to this mountain mountain be removed and they don't doubt but believe me that's all together controlled automotive and objectives you are god don't give you gift just to play with it you know if we don't palate don't just oppose you avec amen amen brother the gift that god has given to each one of us if you are do not shake it down tonight it is not for sure and spectacular it is not for myself one member is not for me to you know you are against my gifts that contraband no no a real gift amen amen so parker for the fight as i was saying a while ago that's the secret says before god can use you mightily be a prisoner to him why are you looking for divine healing objectives why do you go to the church i go to church i can't find a husband or a wife and if i don't find it i'm gonna leave yes we more no matter no matter how much you want to tell that guy he's wrong because you say and what this that or the other who says he will say love you hold this deal till god says there are some things you don't have to say there are certain shows you have to say it until god allows you to develop then when god says so he can't do a decency then you can come with that said the lord until that jesus just godzilla just forget about it amen amen so my patience and confessing therefore brothers don't affair what i told you sunday because of zadie demons with a lot of pain in my heart it's the truth celebrity wave and confess to see the patient confessing you cannot have the prayer of faith is what changed the will of god so if you don't want to confess you cannot the effectual fervent prayer of righteous men a violent match oh if you only knew she said that in your hand because christ gave us the authority with his name by by being a christian the most powerful weapon the world has ever known it even changes everything sasha's mammoth ii and you see every time brother branham said that a prior change he thinks he's always going back to hezekiah he is one of the strongest type in the bible they learn the typical plus of a prayer of faith that can't even change the plan of god change he said it will change the mind of god it is a challenge it did do it after death was pronounced to a man [Music] in the message expectation expectative the one preaching 1961. celebration on these nerf sounds for something yeah paragraph nine paragraph nerf brother what man calls great god calls the foolish ezekiel my pelegrant you are pencil of fuller and what man called the foolish god calls great the secret lord loma pele follicular pellegrino so what we have got to do second or something fair we have promoted our own wishes and all the plans [Music] that was ever put in the control of human beings there is no atomic bomb oh no hydrogen bomb as powerful as the prayers where you will change the mind of god the priesthood shall happen now what prayer is it talk about the prayer of faith after confession well there is no condemnation in the heart allowing you to condemnation if you'll be that will change even god said the lord jesus angel and cd listen here even if he can't change that said the lord jesus and sydney listen yeah what about what the source has done on faith the saucer came one day oh this boy the principle of prayer of faith will break the kingdom of the devil whatever they have a plan two seconds don't play whatever they have decided you think it's a some destiny day how many witchcraft combined celery whatever they have even planted in your home memphis on plants with their prayers they get a lot of gifts he's only boku do kadoo and among their gifts hey pamela caddo one of the gift was alan de cadute a witchcraft that they uh the lamazi would love celery they gave to them they lived on the name and they put it in the house by the purpose of that witchcraft do they say that they said society it was that statute you put somewhere this is that you get your medical just check it out brother sometimes we pray a lot but we have to have the approach of the prayers the prayer that god can reveal to gift or whatever there was a brother those who know him he's the one who sold his uh uh plot to shekinata bernanke he was uh one of the brothers affair went with me when i went to pay the dowry for my marriage i call him always there was a somebody expert in the witchcraft yeah they could think it experience of ciliary that you never james it always states and maybe people didn't pay attention by himself he knew maybe what was going on one day that brother i told you papa francois stay brother did not get it completely until just a second he revealed himself this is statutes that you see nobody nobody personally that means you must have power [Music] amen amen so let's go back here and close it let us read here so prayer every day you pray of faith it's like more than an atomic bomb it's a blue scalable but to make that bomb that wasn't said in japan 1945 it is never sunken until today it is still effective [Music] and confess your sister a confession for come is on the prayer lines attached i was just not just the past just the perspective because you believe what the problem says and look at the testimony but when you come they come with any i'm not saying that the praying is wrong but the word of god is a two-edged sword today we tell you this shows amen amen so now brother burnham continues i'm gonna skip here a little bit and i can't imagine imagining that i'm saying i can't imagine all the celebrity at the gate dude the peasants out at the outer court when they went in said they consumed what will become of our king they cannot do nothing i said a lot and see the lesson here he's going to die if our movie went out to the soldiers the party valley soldiers oh great prophet oh god prophet what does the lord say about our kingdom that said a lot because he did the same year he's gonna die amen amen he got it that said the lord he has nothing else to say there is no negotiation i know i'm the perfect prophet lord listen here lord god senior dear ibc to you to consider me i walked before you with a perfect heart i need 15 years longer to get my kingdom in conditions he was a king he knew that if i die like this could have happened to my kingdom a prayer looks like that god would have wanted to say anything they come see jovule with director he would have told him while he was talking to him but god has ways of doing this you have to come god's way would have had veneer of what they do and god's means of doing things don't do fellow shows as long as we try to get it ourselves then it won't work we have to try maybe in many ways and we just can't pardon after one another oh because that brother did this we can't pardon after one another we have god to live individually before god no they want vivid individual mothers and very often that's our common mistakes they say results are not true because that's why that did this come jesus christ amen amen brandon continue when i'm continuing now the greatest man in the land legally that was the king facing the greatest person in heaven which was god so please that was his prophet and he said go tell him every day that i've heard his prayers and i'm going to spare him uh him them 15 years i call the second zone he's the one who asked for 15 years look at the monday and god promised to give us the desire of our hearts whatever your heart desires is what god promised to give us that the prophet must have been embarrassed because the prophet saying coming right back what are you coming back for prophet prophet it was not him it isn't he was nobody was the you he's going amen amen brother sister that's the principle the sally principle the principle of prayer of faith after confession confession in the divine healing allah [Music] [Music] and see the lesson you're even moving god said the lord he's gonna die because he didn't send you the lord he's gonna die but the prayer came everything changed in the message israel and the church israelis part four with cathedral party paragraph grafton 184 sankhya thousand card look at old isaiah regardless you know sometimes us as ministers must have a performance as a christian communicator yeah we we we don't want embarrassment but some of the embarrassment is god's perfect will my performance is put yourself in the position of the great prophet isaiah you come now that said enough he listened here and if that thing did not happen did i is it kind of die is it can say but he was that said the lord may tell him and you come back again yonko i told already those people is it this idea says that he's gonna die giveaway but now my man no if i go again seizure run concur and tell them he's gonna leave ivan murray to judge me commercials you have nothing to defend of your own variant of the woman as long as you are at the guard wheel oh still on top of volunteered some of the embarrassment certainly for his club and the brother i'm saying look at that old isaiah regardless of you is he goes up and tells the prophet hezekiah invited you prophet isaiah set your house in order met amazon you are going to die that said in a couple hours don't calculate you regardless he can tell you isaiah the prophet he is the hillary prophecy the lord and he left in the two hours he went back iran conquered me as a prayer turned his face to the world basket ezekiel first controlled me and wept bitterly amen amen and the tears run down amen god has already sealed his doom do you have it just silence our son but prayer change things like reactions to the shows amen amen blessed be the name of the lord being swollen and if you take your bible in isaiah uh isaiah 38. and after he was healed what does ezekiel do is a casa the writing of hezekiah king of judah when he had been sick and was recovered of his sickness in other versions they said the praises of hezekiah [Music] and what is a character doing let us escape to verse 18 verse is written he started saying god said those people who are in the grave say john like they cannot come and worship you right there is somebody to worship you can't do it for whom you have done a word let me worship you yes for the grave cannot praise thee death cannot be celebrated to celebrate that go down into their peace cannot hope for thy truth they're living living they're living living he shall preside amen amen the father to the children shall make known thy truth therefore a we will sing my songs to the single instruments amen amen for isaiah as he said he is what is the sign that i shall go up to the house of the lord if you read uh uh isaiah 38 the manchester is say that the lamp of fig they say the fig lamas the fig that was the only thing as he prayed he said can you pray yes he pray come and please he prayed raw in a must defeat just take it use the process put it where there is the boy that's it what produced that yes he was the faith of isaac yes maybe brother sister with that fairy sir you can go to see doctors you can go see all the witchcraft they will tell you drinking shows go do this go do this that's it a very simple thing he's just doing so and my point is we have to look for that little thing but in our need we have to ask god under the monday we have to change different ways yeah what shall i do what shall i do and if your faith is anchored a okay and god shows you what you have to do if you ever want to sacrifice something even if it's hard to say difficile just do it it's just a settler why because it's the provided way of god here just go get a lump of figs just a laypress defeat just a lump of fish just to must the figure if that's still valid yes it's elected to jova leader we will we have a found remedy for cancer remedy for the medical policy but somebody mckelkin all the principles through the principle i'm going to follow i'm going to find the lamp of fig i'm going to put in my all my sicknesses and they pray apa the prayer of faith like yes and the god if you are still the same situation yesterday yeah today and forever i want my healing margarita amen amen so therefore my brothers the uncomfortable what principle we draw here it was a positive attitude in the sickness in attitude positive malady in your condition now what a condition don't envy nobody now the young person don't blame nobody person just have a right mental attitude he ain't multitude mental correct all the time that's the principle withdrawal in this case yes and they keep that again regardless of who may be the cause the important keypad they can say to your auntie cannot support her i have always the right mental attitude toward that auntie on their side don't hate that person it doesn't matter that's an important part of always the right mental attitude somebody who doesn't want always to discourage you okay give it to you negativity important negativity confession with tears the confessions like the lamb lord what i have done in your second your faith was wrong if they fall forgive me the power of the mother you know when you ask for forgiveness a real forgiveness don't if you do your part he will fail oh you don't want to do your part none of my business okay i'm important to pray for you and move forward and after that confession then if we have a prayer of faith foreign may god bless you god of principles you're the principal he doesn't act outside of his apprenticeship or they say principle we want to bring all the principles to the principle but there are some principles they are simple if i had the principle somebody hates you that can't give you hair don't find a reason to hate the bag you are following you are you are being influenced by his attitude personality but use the correct principle may choose a principal you
